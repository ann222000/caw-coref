An Upside-Down World

Published February 23, 2007; Page A10

LONDON -- "The other day Ken Livingstone, the mayor of my hometown of
London, organized a conference on Islam and the West. It was a
carefully rigged affair in which handpicked speaker after handpicked
speaker stood up and announced that the democracies were to blame for
the tidal wave of murder sweeping the world.

Yes how could they possibly think that our friendly neighbourhood
jew/zionist/israeli would do anything but what is best for fellow citizens.

And he wants to complain about the lord mayor.

Like to say a few words on israeli behavior towards anyone in israel who
does not fall in line with jewish/zionist zealots who are apparently in
control of the whole jewish/zionist/israeli block at present?

AND THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT LONDONS LORD MAYOR???

Yes and you have no quarrel with the US?
They dont have to, they use their army to shoot, run over and mistreat
physically and sexually helpless children. What can a Palestinian do when
the mighty money contributing yanks cannot protect their citizens.

Christian homes being knocked down???
The new homes were built by a group of limited income Palestinian Christian
families who banded together as the Arab Orthodox Housing Project to build a
new life. They obtained a 99-year lease from their Church, the Greek
Orthodox Church, 22 years ago and then began the agonizing process of
organizing and saving enough money to start construction.

"We were renters for 40 years," Dalal Awad, a mother of five told me. "We
saved for 22 years and built this home with our neighbors. It cost $42,000.
We built it with our hearts, our own labor. Now the Israelis want to kill
our dream."

(Wanderer, Oct. 12, 1989, p. 7; National Review, March 16, 1992, p. S-5).

Israeli soldiers can beat up a priest on the West Bank, then shoot up his
church during Mass, and only the Catholic press takes note...If Christians
had done such a thing to a synagogue, anywhere, it would have been
front-page news, everywhere. (Wanderer, Oct. 12, 1989, p. 7; National
Review, March 16, 1992, p. S-5).

He escaped and fled to Israel only to discover that the anti Semitism and
bombings had been engineered by his fellow Zionists to dupe Iraqi Jews into
going to Israel. An ancient community was deprived of its wealth and reduced
to second-class citizen status in Israel, replacing Palestinian labor. See

In a letter to the conference host, UNESCO Director-General Koichiro
Matsuura, the protesters said the  Wiesenthal center, "under the deceitful
cover of  the   struggle against anti-Semitism, is on the contrary
encouraging intolerance  and   racism in our societies."

The SS was particularly enthusiastic in its support for Zionism. An
internal   June 1934 SS position paper urged active and wide-ranging support
for   Zionism by the government and the Party as the best way to encourage
emigration of Germany's Jews to Palestine.

The Jewish Agency delegation headed by Golda Meir (Meirson) ignored a
German
offer to allow Jews to emigrate to other countries for $250 a head, and  t
he
other Jewish groups  made no effort to influence the United States and the
32 other countries attending the conference to allow immigration of German
and Austrian Jews.

It's no secret that Zionism embraced political expediency to advance
the cause of carving Eretz-Israel from the land of its native
inhabitants. In his 1983 book, Zionism in the Age of the Dictators,
Lenni Brenner shows that 20th century Zionists observed shockingly few
limits to that expediency. Not surprisingly, the book received little
coverage in the American media.

http://sf.indymedia.org/news/2002/12/1553622.php
http://www.marxists.de/middleast/brenner/index.htm

Now, in 51 Documents, Brenner has compiled a wide variety of letters,
statements, articles, and judgements?some of which appeared in his
earlier  book?by a broad array of activists and authors, that documents
Zionist
cooperration with the Nazis.

On the face of it, the notion seems absurd. However, Brenner
presents the case?made in many Zionists? own words?that the Nazi
agenda of expelling the Jews from Germany fit nicely with the Zionist
plan for enticing those Jews into settling in Palestine and creating a
new Jewish nation.

In addition to introductory and concluding chapters, the book is
organized into five sections which lead the reader through early,
pre-Zionist documents; pre-Holocaust ideological factions; the
Holocaust era itself; and a chapter on the Stern Gang and the Nazis.

Readers should note that a few documents are not indicative of
collaboration in and of themselves, but provide the background to
others written in response.

These latter do indicate levels of collaboration between Zionists and
fascists, both the Nazis in Germany, and those in Mussolini's Italy.
Brenner's brief explanatory notes at the beginning of each document
are helpful, as are the glossary and index.

51 Documents assumes a certain knowledge of Zionist history, and
requires a close reading and some deconstructive efforts on the part
of the reader. Those willing to commit the time and effort, however,
are rewarded with some stunning revelations. The reason some Zionists
eschewed the boycott against Hitler?s Germany, for instance, is that
http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-060706mideast,1,7895295....
oll=chi-news-hed&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true
they had a financial deal?Ha'avara?with Germany allowing Jews to
exchange their wealth for goods to be exported to Palestine at less of
a loss, as an incentive to emigrate. Those wondering why Zionists
today are so organized and experienced in their public relations
efforts discover that these battles have been fought before. Moreover,
the section on Nazi and Zionist understandings of 'nationality' versus
citizenship reveals how German and Israeli practices are based on the
same concept.

51 Documents also sheds a whole new light on the term Holocaust
guilt, frequently understood to mean Western, non-Jewish guilt for
not acting against the Holocaust earlier. However, these documents
make it clear that Holocaust guilt began with those Zionists who made
the undoubtedly difficult, but politically expedient choice to place
Eretz-Israel at the top of their priorities, above the lives of their
threatened European brethren.

From a Zionist Executive Meeting speech by Yitzhak Gruenbaum on Feb.
18, 1943:

And when some asked me: Can't you give money from Keren Ha Yesod
(Palestine Foundation Fund) to save Jews in the Diaspora? I said:
?No!  And again I say no....And, because of these things, people
called me an anti-Semite, and concluded that I'm guilty, for the fact
that we don't give ourselves completely to rescue actions.(p. 211)

However difficult it may be, the reader must confront some rather
disturbing conclusions. The most unsettling realization for this
reviewer is that pre-Holocaust Zionists were able to politically align
themselves with the Nazis because both groups fundamentally saw race
as an important dividing line?and, moreover, were determined to keep
it that way.

The most notorious case of Nazi-Zionist collaboration is
that involving Rudolf Kastner.

Most Jewish people have never heard of Rudolf Kastner.
Those who have, are generally under the impression that
there is some "controversy" about negotiations he undertook
for "the purchase of Jewish lives for money and military
equipment," but that he was "fully rehabilitated" by the
Supreme Court of Israel.

The Accusations

Briefly, the accusations against Kastner are as follows:

Dr. Rudolf Verba, a Doctor of Science now serving at the
British Medical Research Council, was one of the few
escapees from Auschwitz. In his memoirs published in
February, 1961, in the London Daily Herald, he wrote:

I am a Jew. In spite of that - indeed because of that -
I accuse certain Jewish leaders of one of the most ghastly
deeds of the war.

While I was prisoner number 44070 at Auschwitz - the number is still on my
arm

Eichmann not only agreed, but dressed Kastner up in S.S.
uniform and took him to Belsen to trace some of his friends.

LINKS THAT WERE BROKEN
2 SNOWY HAIRED 7 AND 8 YEAR OLD KIDS , A GIRL AND A BOY PLAYING IN THE
CONFUSION THAT WAS EUROPE  DURING WWII CAME ACROSS A LARGE BLACK MAN SITTING
VERY QUIETLY AND STARTED TO SPEAK TO HIM AND PLAYFULLY TOUCH HIM.
HE CAME TO LIFE AND CHASED THEM OFF STILL NOT MOVING JUST BY YELLING AND
WAVING HIS ARMS. THE KIDS MOVED TO WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS A SAFE DISTANCE
STILL TEASING HIM AS PLAYFUL STUPID 7 AND 8 YEAROLDS WILL.
THEN THE MAN HAVING APPARENTLY FRIGHTENED THEM OF TO A SAFE DISTANCE BLEW UP
INTO THE AIR SO FRIGHTENING THE 2 KIDS THEY RAN OF IN A PANIC TO TELL THEIR
MOTHER WHO WAS RESTING WITH OTHER REFUGEES .

THAT WAS THE LAST OF THE INCIDENT FOR THE KIDS ANYWAY TILL I WAS TALKING TO
THE RELATIVES NOW GROWN UP ADULTS AND REALISED WHAT HAD POSSIBLY HAPPENED.

WITH  AN EXSERVICEMAN FATHER THERE WAS ONE LANDMINE IN WWII THAT I BELIEVE
YOU KNEW YOU HAD TRIGGERED WHEN YOU HEARD THE CLICK. THE NEXT SOUND YOU KNEW
YOU WOULD HEAR WOULD BE THE EXPLOSION WHICH WOULD IN ALL  PROBABILITY KILL
YOU.

THAT IS ONE OF A THOUSAND STORIES THAT SHOULD HAVE CEMENTED RELATIONS
BETWEEN AMERICANS AND EUROPEANS IN THAT A LOT OF THE AMERICAN SERVICEMEN
TOOK HOME WIVES  FROM EUROPE CEMENTED ON DANGEROUS MEETINGS LIKE THAT
DESCRIBED ABOVE THAT MIGHT HAVE SAVED THE SERVICEMANS LIFE.

HOWEVER THE FIRST TING THE EUROPEAN FOUND ON ARRIVING IN ANY OF THE WESTERN
DEMOCRACIES  WAS THAT  THE WATER HAD BEEN NICELY MUDDIED SO THAT WHEN YOU
INNOCENTLY CAME OUT WITH THE TRUTH AS YOU KNEW IT IN EUROPE HAVING LIVED
THROUGH IT, YOU WERE TOLD THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
AND HAD BEEN BRAINWASHED BY THE NAZIS BECAUSE THE JEWISH GROCERS AUNTY TOLD
HER ALL ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED .

A key piece of Holocaust evidence is the "confession" of former Auschwitz
commandant Rudolf Höss. In a sworn statement, and in testimony before the
Nuremberg Tribunal on April 15, 1946, he declared that between May 1940 and
December 1943, while he was Commandant of the camp complex, "at least two
and a half million victims were executed and exterminated there by gassing
and burning," and that "at least another half million succumbed to
starvation and disease, making a total dead of about three million" during
that period alone. [7] Although it is still widely cited as solid proof for
the Auschwitz extermination story, this "confession" is actually a false
statement that was obtained by torture.

Many years after the war, British military intelligence sergeant Bernard
Clarke described how he and five other British soldiers tortured the former
commandant to obtain his "confession." Höss himself privately explained his
ordeal in these words: "Certainly, I signed a statement that I killed two
and half million Jews. I could just as well have said that it was five
million Jews. There are certain methods by which any confession can be
obtained, whether it is true or not." [8]

Casualties in WW2
Not including the documented  5 million non Jewish  in concentration camps
who far out numbered the suspected true number  (700,000 ODD) of Jewish
victims. And this is without lies and exaggerations about non jewish
cassualities. And freedom for any historian or amateur history buff to
examine and point out flaws without fear of castigation or jail terms.
And no one is going around asking for special favors and sympathy because of
these immense casualities. And certainly don't look like getting anything
from jewish interests who by lies have swollen their numbers to higher than
these. AND BEGGED ALL SORTS OF FAVORS AND REPARATIONS WITH THOSE EXAGERATED
FIGURES. WHILE USING THEIR STORIES TO CAUSE AN IMMENSE SPLIT BETWEEN NON
JEWS IN EUROPE AND AMERICA.
WHILE OF COURSE QUITE FREE THEMSELVES TO ASSOCIATE WITH THEIR FELLOW JEWS IN
Germany, EUROPE AND ARAB COUNTRIES.

The Bush administration's evacuation of Americans in Lebanon has been
disorganized and lagged behind the efforts of other countries. As of
yesterday, only a few thousand had been able to evacuate, and they departed
"two days after the first Europeans left on ships." Denmark, for example,
"evacuated more than 4,000 of its citizens" by Thursday.
Conservatives have reacted to this incompetence by attacking the evacuees:

WAR CRIMES

Israel accused Friday, 3 November, 2000 - Israel has always sought to escape
responsibility for what was done in Khiam
OPENING GRAVE WOUNDS / EVIDENCE OF ISRAELI ATROCITIES DURING THE 1967 WAR
WITH EGYPT THREATENS THE COUNTRIES' FRAGILE TIES FREDERICK PAINTON REPORTED
BY AMANY RADWAN/CAIRO AND ERIC SILVER/JERUSALEM - The fury aroused in Egypt
by the apparent proof of massacres was fueled by the press, which matched
wartime photos with imaginative illustrations showing Egyptian soldiers
surrendering, being ordered to dig their graves, then being executed.

"The saving of the Jews in Europe did not figure at the head of the list of
priorities of the ruling class. It was the foundation of the State which was
primordial in their eyes."
http://www.al-shia.com/html/eng/books/miscelleneous/the-founding-myth...
raeli-politics/part3.htm

"The masses of Jews from Hungary's ghettos obediently boarded the
deportation trains without knowing their fate. They were full of
confidence in the false information that they were being transferred to
Kenyermeze.

The Nazis could not have misled the masses of Jews so conclusively had
they not spread their false information through Jewish channels.

The Jews of the ghettos would not have trusted the Nazi or Hungarian
rulers. But they had trust in their Jewish leaders. Eichmann and  others
used this known fact as part of their calculated plan to mislead  the Jews.
They were able to deport the Jews to their extermination by the help  of
Jewish leaders.

The false information was spread by the Jewish leaders. The local  leaders
of the Jews of Kluj and Nodvarod knew that other leaders were  spreading
such false information and did not protest.

Those of the Jews who tried to warn their friends of the truth were
persecuted by the Jewish leaders in charge of the local 'rescue work'.

The truth is that somewhere between 700,000 and 1,500,000 people died in
German work camps in 1944 and 1945. Most of them were Jews. Many were not.
Most of them died in the last six months of the war from disease and hunger
caused by America's bombing of Germany and subsequent destruction of her
infrastructure. There were some atrocities but very few. Few people realize
that
the International Red Cross had a field office in Auschwiz from 1942 until
the end of the war.
That office never reported or recorded any atrocities (Several years ago
international Jewry forced the Red Cross to apologize to the Jews -
apologize for not seeing something that never happened.)

Clearly, the German authorities were at pains to relieve the dire situation
as far as they were able. The Red Cross are quite explicit in stating that
food supplies ceased at this time due to the Allied bombing of German
transportation, and in the interests of interned Jews they had protested on
March 15th, 1944 against "the barbarous aerial warfare of the Allies" (Inter
Arma Caritas, p. 78). By October 2nd, 1944, the ICRC warned the German
Foreign Office of the impending collapse of the German transportation
system, declaring that starvation conditions for people throughout Germany
were becoming inevitable.

To provide a spurious air
of balance, the organizers invited a few people who dissented from the
line of the Muslim Brotherhood and its British allies. Agnès Poirier,
a French feminist, was one of them, but she pulled out because
although there were no special facilities for Christians, Hindus and
Jews, Mr. Livingstone had provided separate prayer rooms for Muslim
men and Muslim women.

She wanted to know: Does Ken Livingstone's idea of multiculturalism
acknowledge and condone segregation? It clearly does, but what made
this vignette of ethnic politics in a European city worth noting is
that commentators for the BBC and nearly every newspaper here describe
Mr. Livingstone as one of the most left-wing politicians in British
public life. Hardly any of them notices the weirdness of an apparent
socialist pandering to a reactionary strain of Islam, pushing its
arguments and accepting its dictates.

Mr. Livingstone's not alone. After suicide bombers massacred Londoners
on July 7, 2005, leftish rather than conservative papers held British
foreign policy responsible for the slaughters on the transport
network. ("Blair's Bombs," ran the headline in my own leftish New
Statesman.) In any university, you are more likely to hear campaigns
for the rights of Muslim women derided by postmodernists than by
crusty conservative dons. Our Stop the War coalition is an alliance of
the white far left and the Islamist far right, and George Galloway,
its leader, and the first allegedly "far left" MP to be elected to the
British parliament in 50 years, is an admirer of Saddam Hussein and
Hezbollah.

I could go on with specific examples, but the crucial point is the
pervasive European attitude to the Iraq catastrophe. As al Qaeda, the
Baathists and Shiite Islamists slaughter thousands, there is virtually
no sense that their successes are our defeats. Iraqi socialists and
trade unionists I know are close to despair. They turn for support to
Europe, the home of liberalism, feminism and socialism, and find that
rich democrats, liberals and feminists won't help them or even
acknowledge their existence.

There were plenty of leftish people in the 20th century who excused
communism, but they could at least say that communism was a left-wing
idea. Now overwhelmingly and everywhere you find people who scream
their heads off about the smallest sexist or racist remark, yet refuse
to confront ultra-reactionary movements that explicitly reject every
principle they profess to hold.

Why is the world upside down? In part, it is a measure of President
Bush's failure that anti-Americanism has swept out of the
intelligentsia and become mainstream in Britain. A country that was
once the most pro-American in Western Europe now derides Tony Blair
for sticking with the Atlantic alliance. But if Iraq has pummeled Mr.
Blair's reputation, it has also shone a very harsh light on the
British and European left. No one noticed it when the Berlin Wall came
down, but the death of socialism gave people who called themselves
"left wing" a paradoxical advantage. They no longer had a practical
program they needed to defend and could go along with ultra-right
movements that would once have been taboo. In moments of crisis,
otherwise sane liberals will turn to these movements and be reassured
by the professed leftism of the protest organizers that they are not
making a nonsense of their beliefs.

If, that is, they have strong beliefs to abandon. In Europe and North
America extreme versions of multiculturalism and identity politics
have left a poisonous legacy. Far too many liberal-minded people think
that is somehow culturally imperialist to criticize reactionary
movements and ideas -- as long as they aren't European or American
reactionary movements. This delusion is everywhere. Until very
recently our Labour government was allowing its dealings with
Britain's Muslim minority to be controlled by an unelected group, the
Muslim Council of Britain, which stood for everything social democrats
were against. In their desperate attempts to ingratiate themselves,
ministers gave its leader a knighthood -- even though he had said that
"death was too good" for Salman Rushdie, who happens to be a British
citizen as well as a great novelist.

Beyond the contortions and betrayals of liberal and leftish thinking
lies a simple emotion that I don't believe Americans take account of:
an insidious fear that has produced the ideal conditions for
appeasement. Radical Islam does worry Europeans but we are trying to
prevent an explosion by going along with Islamist victimhood. We blame
ourselves for the Islamist rage, in the hope that our admission of
guilt will pacify our enemies. We are scared, but not scared enough to
take a stand.

I hope conservative American readers come to Britain. But if you do,
expect to find an upside-down world. People who call themselves
liberals or leftists will argue with you, and when they have finished
you may experience the strange realization that they have become far
more reactionary than you have ever been."
