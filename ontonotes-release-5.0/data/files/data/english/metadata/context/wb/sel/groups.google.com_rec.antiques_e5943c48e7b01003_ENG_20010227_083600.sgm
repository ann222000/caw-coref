I hope this is not a problem to make this request, but I need help
placing value on an old porcelain (sp?) Gulf sign. It belongs to my
mother, and a man wants to buy it from her and we have absolutely no
idea what value it has. Its a large sign that hung outside the old Gulf
stations. Its a round sign with a diameter of approximately 6 feet.
The porcelain has many bad places in it with the rusty metal showing
through. To make matters worse, someone in the past tried to make a
table of it and welded a piece to the center of one side. I'm not sure
you could remove the welded piece without burning a hole in the sign
itself.

I know the damage to the sign will depreciate it greatly, but I don't
want her to give it away for nothing either.

I'll be checking this newsgroup for a few days although I'm not a
regular subscriber. If you'd rather reply by email that will be fine as
well...but be careful of the spam filter in the reply to address.

Thanks for any help yall can give.
Sam

"/> Well, look. We try to keep it to stuff at least 50 years old, and since
I'm the teensiest bit over 50 and used a lot of Gulf stations... Well,
you see? (Your's could certainly be older than that. Gulf was around for
a long time.) Also, values you solicit on a newsgroup may be anywhere
from a guess to deliberately misleading. We try to discourage value
requests, too.

But, I think I lead this into something more broad. I'm not up on the
current values of oil company signs. There are certainly collectors and
folks who just like them, as well as decorators who plaster them on the
walls of questionable eateries. One of the things that seems to be
happening in the last couple of years is that a lot of people have
become very picky about condition.

Sources like e*B*a*y have made it possible to find just about anything
in mint or near mint condition. Used to be, a lot of people didn't get
much chance to see many examples of things they were interested in. They
were pretty much limited to shops, shows, and maybe a collector's
newletter or magazine in their field. The range of pieces available to
them was somewhat limited.

With the Internet making hundred of thousands of item available
anywhere, any time, it doesn't take much looking to find very fine
examples of those things that didn't turn up locally. Granted, a
six-foot sign isn't really an object for Internet sales. Shipping would
kill it. And condition has always been important.

So, your market is almost strictly local. A buyer might drive some
distance for one in very good condition or might even pay the shipping
for a near perfect one (Past performance on online auctions suggest they
won't, though - some nice ones have gone begging for $50 because they
would have to be picked up), but I don't think they're going to travel
far for one in fair to poor shape, especially with the welding damage.
If you don't want to keep it, and the offered money will buy you
something else you'd like to have more, I think you're okay. You won't
be giving away a real prize or anything, and no one's going to make a
killing by reselling it.

Yuo can take a look at this guy's site:
http://www.oilsign.com/

It's a collection, so the conditions are generally quite good, but it
might give you an idea of where yours falls in the range of designs and
sizes. Keep in mind, though, that everything you see there *hasn't* sold
at that price and most likely will sell, if it does, for less than
asking. He's going to have a hell of a time moving most of them at those
prices, but he doesn't have to move them fast, either.

Gerald,
I'm sorry that I didn't follow your rules when posting this request. The
group downloaded over 2500 messages and I didn't look through them all for a
rules list.

That said....I appreciate your comments and especially the link to the sign
collection. Thats exactly the kind of page I was looking for. At least that
gives me a good idea of where we stand. I just didn't want Mom to sell a $300
sign for $25 or anything like that.

Thanks again.....Sam

"/> That does look really weird on his page but I must say we favour 8's in our
pricing. Our favourite prices are 18, 28, 38, 48 etc. etc. this is just
something that has evolved over the years. Stores that price things at 19.99
for example always seems tacky and we don't like pricing things in odd
numbers or in multiples of 10 (20, 30 etc.). Although when we get into the
hundreds we tend to price things to the odd 5, like 465 or 775.

Does anybody else have strange habits in this respect.

May I commend Gerald on his excellent reply to Sam?

Sam was very polite in his request and his subsequent reply made it clear
that for anyone subscribing first time to (this) newsgroup is faced with a
huge initial download - I had to stop a gardening newsgroup download that
was offering me over 14,000 messages - even just headings would be
overpowering.

I think our newsgroup policemen do an excellent job and mostly the
persistent spammers are deterred. An innocent first request for value,
however, I think warrants a sensitive reply and, I am sure, will make us
more friends and potential contributors. Certainly, as with the oil signs
link, it can open up some interesting sites and discussion.

Thank you Sam and Gerald.

I think you just like to hide in your mountain fortress where you can

Mike B. and Tish had ideas, too, about the 88s. I think I would like a store
that had prices like $16.47 or $72.11 (especially if I would have been willing
to pay $22.69 or $91.31 for those items, respectively). But the seemingly
random pricing would also indicate that the person in charge may be willing to
negotiate, right?

&gt;Damn it, Charley, everybody who reads regularly know that ball bouncing
&gt;between you and Fayette is a game you two play (only I thought it was
&gt;shuttlecock, not tennis.) And anybody who doesn't read us regularly
&gt;isn't around long enough to form an opinion.) Nothing you said then
&gt;made us think less of you or her. All of us sometimes make the mistake
&gt;of posting a smart-aleck remark to the wrong person. Don't make it send
&gt;you into penitential exile. We'd miss either of you if we lost you for
&gt;more than a brief vacation.

Charley,

I've only been hanging out here for a short time and haven't got to know all
the characters as yet. I read the message when it was first posted and even
to a newbie it was apparent that it was without malice and obviously part of
on-going banter.

Don't feel too bad, we all screw up sometimes.

Mike.

&gt; Charley,

&gt; Your contributions are among the best reasons I drop in on this group
&gt; from time to time. You would be missed if you decided on self-exile.

deal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with a big family problem and found today that I had hurt a part of
our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; own RA family here. About 10 days ago I sent a message to
Foolabaloney
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which was part of an ongoing verbal tennis match that has endured for
at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; least 3 years. I thought I had deleted the RA address but obiviously
I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hadn't. No excuses, no late night vino-just screwed up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whatever we swat over the net in our Game should never have been made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; public. Fayette, AKA Little Fairy, is a brillant, clever, and
charming
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; person with an intellect at least the equal of anyone here. Her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decision/determination to go to Law School and the scores she must
have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; made on the LSAT are a public testimony to that. She attacks any
issue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the ferocity of a bear defending her cubs, yet she didn't shread
my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; posting, probably sensing it was a Brain Fart from a Geezer. That
grace
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and gentleness alone is a great endorsement of her character. I will
miss
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you and I will miss her, but I will return sometime.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm going to take some time off from RA after whatever comments come

"/> The incident read like a cockpit error. No lives were lost and I'm not
even sure that any drinks were spilled. Surely an air pocket does not
constitute just cause for grounding a pilot.

Keep flying,

"/> Oh hell Charlie, I just got used to the idea of you being around again. You've
made an apology and I, like most of the regulars realized that you must have
just made a slip up when posting.
