My goodness, gone 4 days without internet access and I'm behind 260+
messages and I read that there was a quiet day with only 3 or so messages!!!
You guys rock and I've missed you!

CKC was a lot of fun, a learning experience and I'm just gonna have to go to
one where I can actually get around to visit the other booths!  We were so
busy!  We did very well and I hope to be there again the next time they are
in Ft. Lauderdale.  It was my first CKC, I'd never even been to one as a
conventioneer and I found it very different from a Scrapbook Expo or a
Memories Expo. Because of my knee I mostly sat at the Make n Take table,
though I did work hard setting up and at the end taking final inventory! I
had prepared 320 hybrid (digital/papercraft) cards for the make and take,
and I'm pretty sure that we went through close to 220 in 12 hours with only
2 people sitting down at a time!  Anyone who knows me already has figured
out that I had prepared more than one model, in fact I thing I designed 10
different ones.  Truth is that I could have sold dozens of card kits if I'd
had them ready! A lot of people came back two or three times to see if I'd
changed cards and sat down to make the next one.  Honestly I had a great
time and I got to meet Judith K one of the South FL RCS members!
Unfortunately I didn't get much of a chance to speak with her, we were so
rushed, but it was nice to put a face together with the name!

On the subject of cards, based on the requests I've had, I will be coming
out with some card kits and redesigning my business website to sell them.  A
lot of people took my card and I'm hoping to have a few people call me for
classes and crops!  It's time to get back out there and play, it's been a
very long year for me, just hoping to paddle hard enough not to sink.
Hopefully this next year will be operation and problem free and I'll be able
to get into the swing of things, both here with my RCS friends and  in the
other parts of my life that have been so very neglected!

Yeah... glad it went well for you! Our LSS ran out of discount entry
tickets and I decided not to go... the LSS had a back-room sale this
weekend so I went there instead and got $70 worth of assorted stuff
for $25. It wasn't as big a sale as they had last year, but I did well
enough...

I'm glad you got some good scrappin stuff at a good price, but I would have
loved to see you again!  I wish I'd known about the discount tickets,
though.  I had the template and could have sent it to you.  Another lesson
learned!  Next time,  I'll put the ticket up somewhere for people to go and
download!

Sounds like you were really busy and had a wonderful time. Good luck with
your card kits, I know they will be very successful.

Sounds like it was a good trip, and very productive!!!  I knew you'd do well
(or is it good?)!  I'm so happy it was a successful trip for you.
Now, rest that knee and then get to work on straightening up....you need to
take a breather.
