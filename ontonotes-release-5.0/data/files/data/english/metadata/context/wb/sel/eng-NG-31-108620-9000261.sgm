This is actually quite remarkable, I've been waiting for this for a
little while. First there was a false alarm out of the Indian desert,
and then there was this bolide that supposedly hit a hard granite cliff
in Switzerland, leaving a mark, but if this pans out, here we have it.

This is great stuff, people, they need to get some scientists out there.

No proof yet that it was caused by a meterorite.  There has been talk
about vulcanism, but that hardly explains the light in the sky.

Well, we have multiple witnesses reporting an incoming fireball, and
they quickly investigated, and discovered a smoking hole in the ground.

Sounds like pretty solid evidence to me. I'm a scientist (unlike you)

Yes, an I see the 'fetid fumes' have already been identified as mass

confronted with inconvenient truths, like global warming, or rocks from

In fact, this is exactly what I initially thought (and still think
might have happed).  People saw a bolide.  A simultaneous underground
natural gas pipeline explosion happend.  The pipeline, like many such
pipelines carried &quot;sour&quot; gas, ie, raw natural gas mixed with H2S (they
occur a lot together).  H2S is very toxic and in low concentrations
smells like rotten eggs but in higher concentrations destroys your
ability to smell it.  People smelled some H2S and other odours from
the gas.  The sickness was caused by the H2S.
Supposedly, &quot;scientists&quot; very quickly said it really was a metoerite
which makes me skeptical.  How would they determine this? Some are
distinctive being fairly heavy but hemitite is often mistaken for
meteorites.  When a crater is formed, you would not expect to find
pieces of it lying around on the ground.
The story simply did not add up and still does not.

Not if it's solid enough the punch into the ground; the water in the
crater show that the water table is very close to the surface where the
impact occurred, so the ground was probably pretty soft.
Whatever it is, it's down inside the hole, and someone will probably go
down and have a peek at it shortly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I still like my errant Peruvian Scud missile theory; it fits the crater
size, matches the description of something flaming falling from the sky,
Jane's says they may have acquired Scud missiles in 1995-96, and all the
sickness is due to the fumes from the propellant, IRFNA:
http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/envs/scud_irfna.htm
There were reports of people gathering up metallic debris in the area,
thinking it was valuable, and getting skin lesions.
If you handle metal with IRFNA on it, you are going to get skin lesions.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Why can't usenet science crackpots grasp the most basic of concepts?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, i did see somewhere that it had

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, an I see the 'fetid fumes' have already been identified as mass
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; hysteria and hallucination, it happens all the time, especially when
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; confronted with inconvenient truths, like global warming, or rocks from
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; space, or stronger and more frequent hurricanes, sea level rise, and the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; secret prisons, torture or even the imminent collapse of the US economy.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Here in redneck land, &quot;guarantee&quot; pronounced &quot;guaranDamntee&quot; means &quot; I
&gt; &gt;&gt; assert the truthfulness as being near certain&quot;.  Based on the initial
&gt; &gt;&gt; reports, that could not be possible.  Most of us have seen bolides and
&gt; &gt;&gt; the superposition of such with a gas pipeline explosion or similar
&gt; &gt;&gt; event might make credulous people (ie, KY, I mean KT) think of LGM, or
&gt; &gt;&gt; toxic meteors.

&gt; &gt; In fact, this is exactly what I initially thought (and still think
&gt; &gt; might have happed).  People saw a bolide.  A simultaneous underground
&gt; &gt; natural gas pipeline explosion happend.

&gt; The odds of that are pretty slim at best.

&gt; &gt;  When a crater is formed, you would not expect to find
&gt; &gt; pieces of it lying around on the ground.

&gt; Not if it's solid enough the punch into the ground; the water in the

I post a quote from the NYT:

The local official who confirmed the meteorite strike also said that
the water in the crater was boiling for 10 minutes, a detail that
first emerged from witnesses in what appears to be the first English-

Mid-sized meteorites are not hot. I'll say it again: Mid-sized
meteorites are not hot. First, meteoroids are naturally cold. They've
been out in the frigid blackness of space for many billions of years -
these rocks are cold down to their very center. Second, because of its
size there's a good chance that this meteorite was originally part of
a larger meteor that broke up anywhere between 60 and 30km above the
surface. If that is the case, the larger meteor's cold interior would
become the smaller meteor's cold exterior. Since hardly any surface
heating takes place lower than about 30km, this cold surface doesn't
warm up by any appreciable amount. Some meteorites, located soon after
landing, have actually been reported to have frost on the surface due
to their still cold interior.

I also thought the report of boiling seemed to either be contrived or
evidence of non-meteoric origin.  Also reports discuss a &quot;sulfurous&quot;
odor, clear evidence of H2S from decaying organic matter or geologic
origin.  I'd say the meteoric hypothesis is falling apart.

When I read that detail, and people getting skin lesions from handling
&quot;lumonus substance&quot; around the impact site:
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid;=aM4JoplTwAWI
...the first thing that came to mind is that this was the remains of a
radio isotope generator (RTG) or actual nuclear reactor off of a
satellite that reentered, like the Soviet Cosmos 954 RORSAT that fell on
Great Slave Lake back in 1978: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos_954
The reactor would be massive enough to come down pretty fast also.
If that's the case, then we'll know about it very quickly, as people are
going to start keeling over from radiation exposure from handling parts
of the debris.
They've been saying that nothing in the area is radioactive, but RTG's
use isotopes that emit heat and alpha radiation, which doesn't carry
very far...God help you if you pick some up in your bare hand though.
And that would indeed make the water boil, as the isotopes can be at a
thousand degrees or more.

David Morrison recently sent out a compilation of news stories on this:

NEO News (09/20/07) Peru impact crater

There have been many press stories during the past two days dealing with
the possible fall of a large meteorite in the altaplano of Peru.
Apparently a large crater was formed, and local residents asserted that
gases from the crater had made them ill. Because the crater is located
in a remote region, much of the information has been fragmented and
inconsistent, generating considerable skepticism. These doubts have not
all been cleared up, but the most recent reports seem to confirm that
this is indeed a meteorite crater. If so, this represents a very unusual
event, larger than any known meteorite fall since the 1947 impacts of
the Sikhote-Alin metal object in Siberia. Below are printed several
press stories and comments in reverse chronological order, showing how
the story has has shifted over the past two days.

METEORITE LIKELY CAUSED CRATER IN PERU

By Monte Hayes, Associated Press Writer
September 20, 2007

LIMA, Peru - Peruvian astronomers said Thursday that evidence shows a
meteorite crashed near Lake Titicaca over the weekend, leaving an
elliptical crater and magnetic rock fragments in an impact powerful
enough to register on seismic charts. As other astronomers learned more
details, they too said it appears likely that a legitimate meteorite hit
Earth on Saturday - a rare occurence.

The Earth is constantly bombarded with objects from outer space, but
most burn up in the atmosphere and never reach the planet's surface.
Only one in a thousand rocks that that people claim are meteorites turn
out to be real, according to Jay Melosh, an expert on impact craters and
professor of planetary science at the University of Arizona.

Melosh was skeptical at first, initially calling it a &quot;non-meteorite&quot;
and suggesting that the crater might have possibly come from below as a
volcanic eruption. Then scientists learned of more details about the
crater, as well as witness descriptions of a thunderous roar and a rain
of smaller rocks coming down. &quot;It begins to sound more likely to me that
this object could indeed be a meteorite,&quot; Melosh said Thursday.

Such impacts are rare, and astronomists still want to do other tests to
confirm the strike. Other details don't add up, they said - such as
witness accounts of water in the muddy crater boiling for 10 minutes
from the heat. Meteorites are actually cold when they hit Earth,
astronomists say, since their outer layers burn up and fall away before
impact.

Experts also puzzled over claims that 200 local residents were sickened
by fumes from the crater. Doctors who examined them found no evidence of
illness related to the meteorite, and one suggested a psychosomatic
reaction to the sight and sound of the plunging meteor.

More details emerged when astrophysicist Jose Ishitsuka of Peru's
Geophysics Institute reached the site about 6 miles from Lake Titicaca.
He confirmed that a meteorite caused a crater 42 feet wide and 15 feet
deep, the institute's president, Ronald Woodman, told The Associated
Press on Thursday.

Ishitsuka recovered a 3-inch magnetic fragment and said it contained
iron, a mineral found in all rocks from space. The impact also
registered a magnitude-1.5 tremor on the institute's seismic equipment -
that's as much as an explosion of 4.9 tons of dynamite, Woodman said.

Local residents described a fiery ball falling from the sky and smashing
into the desolate Andean plain.

Doctors told an Associated Press Television News cameraman at the site
that they had found no sign of radioactive contamination among families
living nearby. But they said they had taken samples of blood, urine and
hair to analyze.

Peasants living near the crater said they had smelled a sulfurous odor
for at least an hour after the meteorite struck and that it had provoked
upset stomachs and headaches. But Ishitsuka said he doubts reports of a
sulfurous smell.

Meteor expert Ursula Marvin said that if people were sickened, &quot;it
wouldn't be the meteorite itself, but the dust it raises.&quot; A meteorite
&quot;wouldn't get much gas out of the earth,&quot; said Marvin, who has studied
the objects since 1961 at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in
Massachusetts. &quot;It's a very superficial thing.&quot;

Peter Schultz, a meteor crater specialist at Brown University who is
eager to visit the Peruvian site, said the latest details suggest this
might be an unusual type of meteor strike, and that given the crater's
size, the original meteoroid had to have been at least 10 feet in
diameter before breaking up. &quot;With everything I see reported now, it
seems to me like we just got hit,&quot; Schultz said.

Justina Limache, 74, told the Lima daily El Comercio that when she heard
the thunderous roar from the sky, she abandoned her flock of alpacas and
ran home with her 8-year-old granddaughter. She said that after the
meteorite struck, small rocks rained down on the roof of her house for
several minutes and she feared the house was going to collapse.

Modesto Montoya, a member of the medical team, told El Comercio that
fear may have provoked psychosomatic ailments. &quot;When a meteorite falls,
it produces horrid sounds when it makes contact with the atmosphere,&quot; he
said. &quot;It is as if a giant rock is being sanded. Those sounds could have
frightened them.&quot;

Associated Press writers Seth Borenstein in Washington and Monte Hayes
in Lima contributed to this report.

IN PERU, A CRATER AND QUESTIONS

By Mike Nizza
New York Times, September 20, 2007

Reports on a small Peruvian town's plight over the past few days include
more than a few elements to boggle the mind - and then to make you
wonder whether an episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; is playing out in real time.
(To set the spooky mood, just watch this short video.)

On Saturday night, a fiery object fell from the sky. Stunned residents
said they tracked it to a fresh hole in the earth that was more than 60
feet wide, 15 feet deep, filled with boiling water and steaming with
noxious fumes, according to a statement from the Health Ministry. And
then people started getting sick: more than 150 reported symptoms like
dizziness, vomiting and skin lesions, according to a government
statement quoted by Bloomberg News.

The Associated Press reports that a local official confirmed through
tests that a &quot;rocky meteorite&quot; created the crater. But a meteorite
expert at the Natural History Museum in London, who was interviewed by
BBC News, said that &quot;increasingly we think that people witnessed a
fireball,&quot; which she said would not be uncommon, and that the hole in
the ground was unrelated.

After seeing the fire in the sky, the local people &quot;went off to
investigate, and found a lake of sedimentary deposit, which may be full
of smelly, methane-rich organic matter,&quot; Dr. Caroline Smith suggested.
&quot;This has been mistaken for a crater.&quot;

A NASA scientist interviewed by Space.com agreed, saying of the steaming
pond that &quot;statistically, it's far more likely to have come from below
than from above.&quot; Adding to the confusion, the scientist concedes that
the meteorite explanation was not impossible, but he would expect it to
be a metal one, not the rocky one identified by tests at the scene. A
well-informed blogger also raises the possibility of a mud volcano and
voices more doubts that a meteor was responsible.

The local official who confirmed the meteorite strike also said that the
water in the crater was boiling for 10 minutes, a detail that first
emerged from witnesses in what appears to be the first English-language
article about the incident, from Agence France-Presse. &quot;And this is
where the story falls apart,&quot; a blogger at Wired writes, adding to that
explanation in a post that started off, &quot;Shades of the Andromeda Strain!
How cool is this!&quot; He continues:

heating takes place lower than about 30km, this cold surface doesn't
warm up by any appreciable amount. Some meteorites, located soon after
landing, have actually been reported to have frost on the surface due to
their still cold interior.

Leave it to Pravda, Russia's state-run a Russian newspaper, to be first
to report the most political explosive hypothesis for the hole in Peru.
The crater, according to Russian Military Intelligence Analysts, was
created when the United States Air Force shot down one of its own
satellites, the paper says.

You see, the satellite was spying on Iran, and destroying it helps the
United States lay the groundwork for an invasion, Pravda says. For a
good conspiracy yarn, go read the rest of the article, which manages to
tie together 9/11, the briefly missing nukes from a few weeks ago, and more.

Radiation from the supposed satellite's fuel cell is what sickened all
those people, Pravda asserts. According to Living in Peru, radiation is
indeed

&gt; this object could indeed be a meteorite,&quot; Melosh said Thursday.

&gt; Such impacts are rare, and astronomists still want to do other tests to
&gt; confirm the strike. Other details don't add up, they said - such as
&gt; witness accounts of water in the muddy crater boiling for 10 minutes
&gt; from the heat. Meteorites are actually cold when they hit Earth,
&gt; astronomists say, since their outer layers burn up and fall away before
&gt; impact.

&gt; Experts also puzzled over claims that 200 local residents were sickened
&gt; by fumes from the crater. Doctors who examined them found no evidence of
&gt; illness related to the meteorite, and one suggested a psychosomatic
&gt; reaction to the sight and sound of the plunging meteor.

&gt; More details emerged when astrophysicist Jose Ishitsuka of Peru's
&gt; Geophysics Institute reached the site about 6 miles from Lake Titicaca.
&gt; He confirmed that a meteorite caused a crater 42 feet wide and 15 feet
&gt; deep, the institute's president, Ronald Woodman, told The Associated
&gt; Press on Thursday.

&gt; Ishitsuka recovered a 3-inch magnetic fragment and said it contained
&gt; iron, a mineral found in all rocks from space. The impact also
&gt; registered a magnitude-1.5 tremor on the institute's seismic equipment -
&gt; that's as much as an explosion of 4.9 tons of dynamite, Woodman said.

&gt; Local residents described a fiery ball falling from the sky and smashing
&gt; into the desolate Andean plain.

&gt; Doctors told an Associated Press Television News cameraman at the site
&gt; that they had found no sign of radioactive contamination among families
&gt; living nearby. But they said they had taken samples of blood, urine and
&gt; hair to analyze.

&gt; Peasants living near the crater said they had smelled a sulfurous odor
&gt; for at least an hour after the meteorite struck and that it had provoked
&gt; upset stomachs and headaches. But Ishitsuka said he doubts reports of a
&gt; sulfurous smell.

&gt; Meteor expert Ursula Marvin said that if people were sickened, &quot;it
&gt; wouldn't be the meteorite itself, but the dust it raises.&quot; A meteorite
&gt; &quot;wouldn't get much gas out of the earth,&quot; said Marvin, who has studied
&gt; the objects since 1961 at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in
&gt; Massachusetts. &quot;It's a very superficial thing.&quot;

&gt; Peter Schultz, a meteor crater specialist at Brown University who is
&gt; eager to visit the Peruvian site, said the latest details suggest this
&gt; might be an unusual type of meteor strike, and that given the crater's
&gt; size, the original meteoroid had to have been at least 10 feet in
&gt; diameter before breaking up. &quot;With everything I see reported now, it
&gt; seems to me like we just got hit,&quot; Schultz said.

&gt; Justina Limache, 74, told the Lima daily El Comercio that when she heard
&gt; the thunderous roar from the sky, she abandoned her flock of alpacas and
&gt; ran home with her 8-year-old granddaughter. She said that after the
&gt; meteorite struck, small rocks rained down on the roof of her house for
&gt; several minutes and she feared the house was going to collapse.

&gt; Modesto Montoya, a member of the medical team, told El Comercio that
&gt; fear may have provoked psychosomatic ailments. &quot;When a meteorite falls,
&gt; it produces horrid sounds when it makes contact with the atmosphere,&quot; he
&gt; said. &quot;It is as if a giant rock is being sanded. Those sounds could have
&gt; frightened them.&quot;

&gt; Associated Press writers Seth Borenstein in Washington and Monte Hayes
&gt; in Lima contributed to this report.

&gt; =============================

&gt; IN PERU, A CRATER AND QUESTIONS

&gt; By Mike Nizza
&gt; New York Times, September 20, 2007

&gt; Reports on a small Peruvian town's plight over the past few days include
&gt; more than a few elements to boggle the mind - and then to make you
&gt; wonder whether an episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; is playing out in real time.
&gt; (To set the spooky mood, just watch this short video.)

&gt; On Saturday night, a fiery object fell from the sky. Stunned residents
&gt; said they tracked it to a fresh hole in the earth that was more than 60
&gt; feet wide, 15 feet deep, filled with boiling water and steaming with
&gt; noxious fumes, according to a statement from the Health Ministry. And
&gt; then people started getting sick: more than 150 reported symptoms like
&gt; dizziness, vomiting and skin lesions, according to a government
&gt; statement quoted by Bloomberg News.

&gt; The Associated Press reports that a local official confirmed through
&gt; tests that a &quot;rocky meteorite&quot; created the crater. But a meteorite
&gt; expert at the Natural History Museum in London, who was interviewed by
&gt; BBC News, said that &quot;increasingly we think that people witnessed a
&gt; fireball,&quot; which she said would not be uncommon, and that the hole in
&gt; the ground was unrelated.

&gt; After seeing the fire in the sky, the local people &quot;went off to
&gt; investigate, and found a lake of sedimentary deposit, which may be full
&gt; of smelly, methane-rich organic matter,&quot; Dr. Caroline Smith suggested.
&gt; &quot;This has been mistaken for a crater.&quot;

&gt; A NASA scientist interviewed by Space.com agreed, saying of the steaming
&gt; pond that &quot;statistically, it's far more likely to have come from below
&gt; than from above.&quot; Adding to the confusion, the scientist concedes that
&gt; the meteorite explanation was not impossible, but he would expect it to
&gt; be a metal one, not the rocky one identified by tests at the scene. A
&gt; well-informed blogger also raises the possibility of a mud volcano and
&gt; voices more doubts that a meteor was responsible.

&gt; The local official who confirmed the meteorite strike also said that the
&gt; water in the crater was boiling for 10 minutes, a detail that first
&gt; emerged from witnesses in what appears to be the first English-language
&gt; article about the incident, from Agence France-Presse. &quot;And this is
&gt; where the story falls apart,&quot; a blogger at Wired writes, adding to that
&gt; explanation in a post that started off, &quot;Shades of the Andromeda Strain!
&gt; How cool is this!&quot; He continues:

&gt;     Mid-sized meteorites are not hot. I'll say it again: Mid-sized
&gt; meteorites are not hot. First, meteoroids are naturally cold. They've
&gt; been out in the frigid blackness of space for many billions of years -
&gt; these rocks are cold down to their very center. Second, because of its
&gt; size there's a good chance that this meteorite was originally part of a
&gt; larger meteor that broke up anywhere between 60 and 30km above the
&gt; surface. If that is the case, the larger meteor's cold interior would
&gt; become the smaller meteor's cold exterior. Since hardly any surface
&gt; heating takes place lower than about 30km, this cold surface doesn't
&gt; warm up by any appreciable amount. Some meteorites, located soon after
&gt; landing, have actually been reported to have frost on the surface due to
&gt; their still cold interior.

&gt; Leave it to Pravda, Russia's state-run a Russian newspaper, to be first
&gt; to report the most political explosive hypothesis for the hole in Peru.
&gt; The crater, according to Russian Military Intelligence Analysts, was
&gt; created when the United States Air Force shot down one of its own
&gt; satellites, the paper says.

&gt; You see, the satellite was spying on Iran, and destroying

Neither do I, from what I understand, some are hot and some are cold,
depending upon the circumstances, but as with craters, fresh falls are
rare. It's not that they don't occur, but they are rarely witnessed.

This baby was fast and hot. Really, I wouldn't get anywhere near a hot

Yes, but the nonsense from the geologists and psychologists invoking all
sorts of volcanism and mass hallucination, that's just hilarious to
those of us who keeps a constant vigil out for phenomena as yet
unwitnessed, but broadly accepted as fundamental truth.

Hypervelocity impacts are one of those realities.

Mine too. I'm still trying to peel my eyebrows off the ceiling! I find the
idea of meteorites being frosty just after impact to be interesting all the
same. I'd be curious to know the size and density ranges in which this could
be expected to occur..?

http://stason.org/TULARC/science-engineering/space/20-Computing-Crate...
have a formula that suggests a 65m crater (just under one kiloton) would
require a chondrite with ~2.5m diameter, given a mean measured chondrite
density of 2.7kg/litre documented by Veverke et. al. (2000: see
http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt;=1500548 ). That seems very small
to me.

What terminal velocity do you think it might have had given size and
density?

That would depend on its shape; if it's basically spherical, it will
fall faster than if it were of a oddball shape that caused it to tumble
as it fell.
The newest reports seem to suggest it was a nickel-iron one, or at least
had a lot of iron in it.
Chondrites tend to break up (or outright explode) in midair due to their
fairly low structural strength.
The fact that it made a loud bang when it hit may suggest it was
supersonic, but I think that's unlikely.
Maybe around 400-600 mph?
Much faster than that and it would start creating a shockwave ahead of
it, which would stop its acceleration.
Small gravel-like debris was reported falling on houses in the vicinity,
although it's a open question if this was from the meteor itself or
debris from the creation of the crater.

Probably closer to 2m than 2.5m in diameter.

So significant speed loss may imply significant heat accumulation. After
all, the energy has to go somewhere. Maybe not a hot potato, but certainly
hot...

Given the fact that what we are looking at is a *hypervelocity impact*,
since all the evidence thus far points to that, the nickel iron seems a
lot more probable, and more likely this thing was coming almost straight
down. Nickel iron meteorites may also has some rock mixed in with them.

I repeat, all the evidence, the boiling fuming pit, the lack of an
appreciable debris apron, the reports of sickening, everything here
points to a hypersonic impact event. So go ahead, make my day.

It puzzles me that people are assigning so much credence to &quot;a Blogger
on Wired&quot;. Following links, that blogger is Patrick Di Justo.

http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/09/meteorite-makes.html

Googling I can see he's a free-lance writer. Can't find a C.V.

The stuff he writes sounds true of most meteorites we've observed.

But if this is a meteorite, it's larger than previously observed
meteorites. With a lower surface to volume ratio, it would hit the earth
at a higher velocity. Kinetic energy is 1/2 m v^2.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If it had a significant content of ammonia or methane ices in it (almost
&gt; like a tiny comet) then those could cause the &quot;boiling&quot; in the water as
&gt; they warmed up and vaporized after being submerged, the way dry ice
&gt; does; that could also account for the bad smell.
">

Volatile rich objects tend to have little crushing strength and would be
smashed in the upper atmosphere.

At this point I believe it's a larger than normal meteorite that hit at
a high velocity. For a large chunk to remain intact it'd have to be
metallic or a hard stony. I believe the shape of the meteor can also
work for or against it chances of reaching the surface in one piece.

If the water table is high it's possible the region is swampy with lots
of organics. A fast meteorite depositing heat into such a place could
well make surrounding people sick.

The exterior would get hot on entry into the atmosphere, but to some
extent that works like a ablative heat shield on a spacecraft; it burns
off and takes a lot of the heat with it as it vaporizes. It shouldn't
have enough heat in it to make water boil for ten minutes by any means.
I don't know if you could heat a block of iron of a meter or two in
diameter till it was red hot all the way through and have it make water
boil for ten minutes. Although it would have a lot of heat left
internally, its exterior would cool down to below the boiling point in a
fairly short time.
In the case of a meteorite, only the outer couple of inches would have
had time enough to get fully heated up by atmospheric friction on entry,
and they would have been cooling off as it freefell through the
atmosphere on the terminal phase of its descent and the air flowed over
them at high velocity.
I still think there's a good possibility that the &quot;boiling&quot; was some
sort of very cold ammonia or methane ices in the meteorite vaporising as
they were warmed by the water, creating bubbles like happen when dry ice
is placed in water.
It that's the case, then when they ever do get to the bottom of the
hole, the thing they find might look quite porous.
The vaporising ices would neatly account for the bad smell also. There's
a outside possibility that the meteorite was almost all ices of some
sort, and there's nothing much left at the bottom of the hole, as the
whole thing has boiled away, or simply melted into the water.

Yes, but lower surface to volume ratio means there's also less area to

Considering the reported rain of pebble-sized debris associated with the

at fairly high altitude. Methane and ammonia ices may not have much

Anyway, there's bound to be something interesting at the bottom of the

imply that what ever it was, most of it ether converted to gas or simply
melted in the water.
I just wish someone would give the definitive answer to what it was made
of - so far it's either a stony meteorite, a nickel-iron meteorite, or a
chondrite meteorite.
Which are the three basic types of meteorites. :-)

The water in the hole looks mighty dirty, that's for sure.  But I think
what happened wasn't that the area was swampy as such (video of the area
around the hole shows fairly barren flat grassland), but rather the
water table was pretty near the surface.
Here's today's wacky theory, regarding the case of the shrinking crater:

Most of the heated exterior is torn off by atmospheric friction. The
short duration of the trip through our atmosphere doesn't give much time
for heat to conduct through the interior.

If the object lands on the ground at ordinary terminal velocity, most of
the asteroid's interior will be the same temperature it was in space.
Atmospheric friction imparts little heat to a meteorite that reaches the
ground. In most cases Di Justo is correct, meteorites are cold. But warm
meteorites are possible, I believe. Not all meteoroids have cold
interiors while they're in space.

I'm not trying to argue a burning hot meteoroid from the inner solar
system made the water boil. I only argue the possibility of warm
mid-sized asteroids as one reason why I question Di Justo's authority.

A larger meteorite can impact with higher terminal velocity. An impactor
striking the earth with great velocity would generate a lot of heat at
point of impact.

We used to hurl all sorts of projectiles at each other when we were
kids. I'll use these to describe my mental models of meteorites.

We'd wear thick jackets in the winter time. A snow ball thrown at the
jacket would splat and not hurt too much. This is a comparable to a
small comet splatting harmlessly on the earth's atmosphere before it
reaches the surface.

Ditto dirt clods. These are comparable to  loose-aggregate-of-gravel
asteroids.

Rocks hurt.

Dirt clods with a rock inside are comparable to loose aggregates with a
monolithic stone inside. (On a few occasions I accidentally threw these
at my big brother &amp; friends).

It's possible a dirt-clod-with-a-rock-inside meteorite could rain
pebbles as well as thud a good size rock into the ground.

It's not likely (I believe) for a rain of pebbles to strike the earth
with a high terminal velocity. A rain of pebbles couldn't cause water to
boil.

All this is true.

However you still aren't taking into consideration the higher terminal

resistance cancels gravity.

On a lark, I ran a object of 2.5 meters diameter through the cratering
program: http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/impacteffects/
...Giving it a impact speed of 1 km per second.
Unfortunately they don't have soil as a choice of a impact medium, so I
had it slam into sedimentary rock in a vertical fall, and had it made
out of iron to get maximum energy via high density.
Here's the results:

Your Inputs:
Distance from Impact: 1.00 km = 0.62 miles
Projectile Diameter: 2.50 m = 8.20 ft = 0.00 miles
Projectile Density: 8000 kg/m3
Impact Velocity: 1.00 km/s = 0.62 miles/s
Impact Angle: 90 degrees
Target Density: 2500 kg/m3
Target Type: Sedimentary Rock

Energy:
Energy before atmospheric entry: 3.27 x 1010 Joules = 0.78 x 10-5
MegaTons TNT
The average interval between impacts of this size somewhere on Earth
is less than 1 month.

Atmospheric Entry:
The projectile lands intact, with a velocity 0.549 km/s = 0.341 miles/s.
The energy lost in the atmosphere is 2.29 x 1010 Joules = 0.55 x
10-5 MegaTons.

Major Global Changes:
The Earth is not strongly disturbed by the impact and loses
negligible mass.
The impact does not make a noticeable change in the Earth's rotation
period or the tilt of its axis.
The impact does not shift the Earth's orbit noticeably.

Crater Dimensions:
What does this mean?
Transient Crater Diameter: 34 m = 111 ft
Transient Crater Depth: 12 m = 39.4 ft
Final Crater Diameter: 42.5 m = 139 ft
Final Crater Depth: 9.05 m = 29.7 ft

The crater formed is a simple crater

The floor of the crater is underlain by a lens of broken rock debris
(breccia) with a maximum thickness of 4.2 m = 13.8 ft.
At this impact velocity ( &lt; 12 km/s), little shock melting of the
target occurs.

Thermal Radiation:
What does this mean?
At this impact velocity ( &lt; 15 km/s), little vaporization
occurs; no fireball is created, therefore, there is no thermal radiation
damage.

Seismic Effects:
What does this mean?
The major seismic shaking will arrive at approximately 0.2 seconds.
Richter Scale Magnitude: 0.8
Mercalli Scale Intensity at a distance of 1 km:

Nothing would be felt. However, seismic equipment may still
detect the shaking.

Ejecta:
What does this mean?
Most ejecta is blocked by Earth's atmosphere

Air Blast:
What does this mean?
The air blast will arrive at approximately 3.03 seconds.
Peak Overpressure: 755 Pa = 0.00755 bars = 0.107 psi
Max wind velocity: 1.77 m/s = 3.97 mph
Sound Intensity: 58 dB (Loud as heavy traffic)

That's got a lot of variables in it, but it would seem to indicate that
whatever fell on Peru, had a lot less energy that the object I entered
because the crater is only around half the size the program predicts.
So whatever it was wasn't that big, heavy, or fast, or some combination
of those factors.
However, change the meteorite's composition from iron to dense rock, and
the crater starts to resemble the one in Peru:

Your Inputs:
Distance from Impact: 1.00 km = 0.62 miles
Projectile Diameter: 2.50 m = 8.20 ft = 0.00 miles
Projectile Density: 3000 kg/m3
Impact Velocity: 1.00 km/s = 0.62 miles/s
Impact Angle: 90 degrees
Target Density: 2500 kg/m3
Target Type: Sedimentary Rock

Energy:
Energy before atmospheric entry: 1.23 x 1010 Joules = 0.29 x 10-5
MegaTons TNT
The average interval between impacts of this size somewhere on Earth
is less than 1 month.

Atmospheric Entry:
The projectile lands intact, with a velocity 0.221 km/s = 0.137 miles/s.
The energy lost in the atmosphere is 1.17 x 1010 Joules = 0.28 x
10-5 MegaTons.

Major Global Changes:
The Earth is not strongly disturbed by the impact and loses
negligible mass.
The impact does not make a noticeable change in the Earth's rotation
period or the tilt of its axis.
The impact does not shift the Earth's orbit noticeably.

Crater Dimensions:
What does this mean?
Transient Crater Diameter: 16.4 m = 53.9 ft
Transient Crater Depth: 5.81 m = 19.1 ft
Final Crater Diameter: 20.5 m = 67.3 ft
Final Crater Depth: 4.38 m = 14.4 ft
The crater formed is a simple crater
The floor of the crater is underlain by a lens of broken rock debris
(breccia) with a maximum thickness of 2.03 m = 6.66 ft.
At this impact velocity ( &lt; 12 km/s), little shock melting of the
target occurs.

Thermal Radiation:
What does this mean?
At this impact velocity ( &lt; 15 km/s), little vaporization
occurs; no fireball is created, therefore, there is no thermal radiation

Richter Scale Magnitude: 0.0
Mercalli Scale Intensity at a distance of 1 km:
Nothing would be felt. However, seismic equipment may still
detect the shaking.

Ejecta:
What does this mean?
Most ejecta is blocked by Earth's atmosphere

Air Blast:
What does this mean?
The air blast will arrive at approximately 3.03 seconds.
Peak Overpressure: 288 Pa = 0.00288 bars = 0.041 psi
Max wind velocity: 0.679 m/s = 1.52 mph
Sound Intensity: 49 dB (Easily Heard)

Change it to porous rock and it blows up in midair:

Atmospheric Entry:
The projectile begins to breakup at an altitude of 24900 meters =
81800 ft
The projectile bursts into a cloud of fragments at an altitude of
22800 meters = 74900 ft
The residual velocity of the projectile fragments after the burst is
0.41 km/s = 0.255 miles/s
The energy of the airburst is 5.10 x 109 Joules = 0.12 x 10-5 MegaTons.
No crater is formed, although large fragments may strike the surface.

Doing the same thing with ice also ends up with it breaking up:

Atmospheric Entry:
The projectile begins to breakup at an altitude of 34300 meters =
113000 ft
The projectile bursts into a cloud of fragments at an altitude of
31300 meters = 103000 ft
The residual velocity of the projectile fragments after the burst is
0.55 km/s = 0.341 miles/s
The energy of the airburst is 2.85 x 109 Joules = 0.68 x 10-6 MegaTons.
No crater is formed, although large fragments may strike the surface.

Dropping the meteorite's size to 1 meter resulted in a crater smaller
than the one observed in the case of dense rock, but pretty smiler in
size for one of iron:

Crater Dimensions:
What does this mean?
Transient Crater Diameter: 11.3 m = 37.1 ft
Transient Crater Depth: 4 m = 13.1 ft
Final Crater Diameter: 14.1 m = 46.4 ft
Final Crater Depth: 3.01 m = 9.89 ft

Which suggest that whatever we are dealing with is probably around 2-3
meters in diameter and made of stone or 1-2 meters in diameter if made
of iron.
This may rule out carbonaceous chondrites as they tend to break up
before impact under the stress of deceleration.
One interesting thing here....the sound at 1 km even with the big one,
isn't all that loud.
The reports from Peru said it was quite loud... does that, in
combination with the &quot;gravel fall&quot; indicate something that blew up at
high altitude and only a fairly small piece hit the ground?
This video show damage to a building that appears to be related to the
fall: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPY6gY_5gsw&amp;mode;=related&amp;search;=
And of course if it broke up in midair, then the ice one and chondrite
are back in the running.
If it was made of methane or ammonia ice and blew up, that would account
for the smell, as the area could have had a rain of ice chips descend on it.

Thanks for the extra detail. The human body being as fragile as it is, I'd
imagine that excessive exposure to high concentrations of gases such as
ammonia could lead to skin lesions and some severe respiritory problems.
Especially if people are sweating while in contact with the gas, or
otherwise loitering in places prone to higher concentrations...?

The inputs I used on my spreadsheet:

Density fluid (kg/m^3)          1.2
Density Ball (kg/m^3)           2750
gravity (meters/sec^2)          9.8
Drag coefficient                0.4

A ball has volume 4/3 pi r^3 and cross section pi r^2

Using this I get .432 km/sec Vt for a ball with a 1.25 meter radius.

Using the UofA calculator it tells me my rock blows up several miles
above the ground. Setting entry angle at 1 degree allows it to hit the
ground at .212 km/sec

I am sure the UofA models are much more informed than mine.

This leads me to doubt my earlier belief that boiling water was caused
by impact generated heat. However the UofA folks have a disclaimer at
the top of their page noting their model is based on limited
understanding and there are large uncertainties. So the jury's still out.

&gt; And of course if it broke up in midair, then the ice one and chondrite

&gt; If it was made of methane or ammonia ice and blew up, that would account

&gt; it.

I'm currently subscribing to David Brin's model of cometary evolution.
His models show if a comet is big enough and doesn't have a perihelion
too close to the sun, it can accumulate an insulating mantle and thus
keep a volatile icey interior for a long time.

A smaller comet has it's insulating exterior blown off when ices
sublimate at perihelion. A smaller comet with a higher surface to volume
ratio and virtually nonexistent gravity will completely disintegrate in
a short time.

So small chunks of ice in our neighborhood seem unlikely to me. I hope
I'm wrong as such objects could be a valuable space resource.

There have been numerous reports of ice meteorites, but data on them is
scant... there was a reported fall of one in China in 1995:

There's a pdf here about possibly searching for ice meteorites in
Antarctica: http://www.sci.u-szeged.hu/eghajlattan/akta01/051-068.pdf

This is encouraging to me. I seem to recall a conversation with John
Schilling where he noted most &quot;water rich&quot; NEOs are about as water rich
as concrete and volatiles would be difficult to extract. This left me
wondering if my Kuck Mosquito daydreams were unwarranted optimism.

I wish the pdf you cited would've talked about what might keep ices from
sublimating in a vacuum when they're in our neck of the woods.

Maybe they only get into our neck of the woods fairly shortly before
they hit the atmosphere, being bits of the cometary matter from the Oort
cloud that only get into the warmer section of the solar system on
highly elliptical orbits that bring them in at a very high velocity.
The SOHO solar satellite shows a lot of very small comets falling into
the Sun that are never seen from Earth, yet sprout tails as the get near
the heliosphere.
As far as insulating the ice, I can picture the following scenario: A
fairly large object (a hundred or more feet in diameter) made of dust
and ice from the Oort Cloud starts inwards toward the sun, and the ice
begins to volatilize and drift away from it. But the dust remains, and
due to electrostatic attraction and the microgravity of the mass starts
building up as a layer on its exterior as it shrinks.
Heat is conducted through this layer and causes the ice under it to
continue to volatilize, until a fairly thick layer of porous dust lays
over the surface of the ice, acting a lot like the silica tiles on the
Shuttle - the outer crust is warmed by the sun, but the heat doesn't
conduct down very far into its interior, and at the core lies ices
shielded from the light of the sun, rather like it's in a near-perfect
vacuum bottle.
Then it hits the atmosphere the dust burns off (it may fall off via
tidal stresses prior to hitting the atmosphere) and the inner ice ball
fragments and  either falls as chunks of ice, or simply melts on the way
down.

And now for today's Peruvian Meteorite update; the hot meteorite boiled
arsenic-containing water, and the people got gassed:

Kind of puts you off on drinking well water in Peru, doesn't it? :-)

Or maybe it didn't, but it arrived at several times the speed of sound:

Would the Smithsonian or National Geographic Society just send someone
