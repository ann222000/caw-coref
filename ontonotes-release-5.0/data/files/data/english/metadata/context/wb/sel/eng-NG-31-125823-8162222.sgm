Churchill's funeral train being returned by club
By Jennifer McLain Staff Writer

INDUSTRY - The railcar that carried the body of late British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill will return home after nearly 30 years at
the Industry Hills Golf Club.

The 50,000-pound funeral railroad coach was purchased in 1965 by
former Industry Councilman Darius Johnson for $980 while he and
Majestic Realty CEO Edward Roski Jr. were in England.

&quot;The railcar was going to be auctioned off basically for scrap, so we
ended up purchasing it,&quot; Roski said.

It was shipped to Long Beach and remained in storage until 1979, where
it went on display at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Course at the Industry
Hills Golf Club. The golf club was a partnership between the city of
Industry and Majestic Realty.

Now, as part of a restoration effort led by a British nonprofit
organization, the Swanage Railway Trust, the funeral car will return
back to its homeland.

&quot;It's come full circle,&quot; Roski said. &quot;But if we didn't purchase it, I
don't know if it would have survived until today.&quot;

The coach, which carried Churchill's body on Jan. 30, 1965, will leave
Tuesday to the Port of Long Beach, and then will depart Aug. 21 to
England.

Representatives from the Swanage Railway Trust originally said they

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----
would pay to ship it. But their fundraising efforts failed, and
instead the city of Industry said they would take care of the cost.
&quot;Even though we paid for it, it does belong in its mother country,&quot;
Industry Mayor Dave Perez said. &quot;We all agreed it deserves to go
home.&quot;

The city is paying $67,000 to return the coach, including $17,000 to
rig it and $50,000 to ship it.

The Swanage Railway Trust has been trying to get the coach back to
England for nearly one year. It will be restored to running order for
use on the Swanage Railway, a six mile-long heritage railway in
Dorset, England.

It was reported in 1965 that the wooden coach served as a baggage car
for the London Great Western Railway before it was taken over by
British Railways. In 1940, the coach was earmarked for destruction,
but was spared by Churchill, who was then prime minister.

The car was preserved because it was used to carry the body of British
nurse Edith Cavell, who was executed by the Germans as a spy during
World War I, according to newspaper reports in 1965.

Since then, the coach was preserved at the golf course and was used to
create an English theme for decoration at the St. Andrew's
restaurant.

At one point, the train attracted many English visitors, Roski said.
Eventually, however, interest waned.

&quot;I don't think it was a destination point, to be quite honest,&quot; Perez
said. &quot;But it was part of the theme of the golf course.&quot;

It had been repainted in Pullman livery in 1963, then kept hidden away in
Stewarts Lane shedunder strict instructions that it was not to be used under
any circumstances whatsoever until authorised - neither BR nor Pullman staff

It'd be interesting to reunite it with 34051 at some point- perhaps

They sure do.  There are still some steam locos in American scrap yards that
there's no money, or will so it seems, to save.

They have even scrapped at least one restored to operation condition steam
loco.  Sometime in the late 1970s IIRC.  All because they couldn't raise
enough money to save it.  This, the so-called richest country in the world.

I wonder what happened to all of the UK railwayana that the now
defunct Victoria Station restaurant chain bought up? Many years ago
(1980s?) I remember seeing a huge quantity of ex-SR station totems at
the Boston VS Restaurant (inside a bunch of old US baggage cars opp.
the now closed Computer Museum on a wharf somewhere).

Then there is the original Victoria Station destination board in LA? I
bet that was scrapped when VS when bankrupt.

I recollect it was a Southern Railway van, possibly built on an underframe
recovered from a London and South Western motor coach. I remember the
funeral, as it was the day of my tenth birthday- can't say that Churchill
was particularily revered in my home town, as he'd sent in the army to stop
a riot/strike of railway workers in 1911, but it still made for a somewhat
sombre day for a ten year old.

The destination board was in the Victoria Station restaurant in the
Universal Studios theme park complex. I think that one was genuine.
You ate in railway carriages which were part of the Flying Scotsman's
train when it visited the USA - I had dinner in a Thompson full brake
which had been painted black and lettered for the LBSCR. This was
maybe 15 years ago.

&gt; &gt;That stuff about the van carrying Edith Cavell's body and being

&gt; The journalist was confused. The Edith Cavall van is at Tenterden.

Very interesting thread.  Have put the following post on my local
forum, Dover Forum, as a consequence.  Hope I've got it right:

A recent news item concerning the railway carriage which conveyed the
body of Winston Churchill has attracted my attention since it states
that Winston Churchill ordered it to be preserved during WW2 as it had
been used to convey the body of Nurse Edith Cavell after WW1.  This
appears to be incorrect.

The article is in the San Gabriel Valley Tribune.  With the usual
British attitude to preserving our history, Winston Churchill's
funeral carriage had been earmarked for scrapping after the funeral
but was purchased by an American and has been on the Industry Hills
Golf Club course in California ever since.  They are now paying for it
to be shipped back to England to be preserved on the Swanage
Railway.

The statement in the article that the carriage had previously been
used to carry Edith Cavell appears misinformed as this carriage is
preserved on the Kent and East Sussex Railway.

Nurse Edith Cavell was the focus of worldwide outrage when she was
executed by a German firing squad during WW1.  She had been matron of
a hospital in occupied Belgium and assisted two hundred British
soldiers to escape to Holland after they were isolated behind the
German lines after the Battle of Mons. Following her execution, the
German Medical Officer said &quot;She was the bravest woman I had ever met,
and was in every respect the heroine her nation had made of her.  She
went to her death with a poise and bearing which it is quite
impossible to forget.&quot;

After the war, her body was exhumed and returned to England.  It was
carried from Ostend to Dover on a Royal Navy destroyer and put onboard
SECR luggage van No.132 at Dover Marine Station.  It was taken under
military escort to a service at Westminster Abbey and thence to re-
interment at Norwich Cathedral.

A mountain in the Canadian Rockies was named after her, as was the
&quot;little sparrow&quot; Edith Piaf.

The carriage was later used to convey the remains of Captain Fryatt
via Dover Marine Station.  He was also the focus of national outrage
being a British Merchant Navy master who had been executed by the
Germans for attempting to ram a German submarine.

Later still, the carriage was used to transport the body of the
Unknown Soldier from Dover Marine Station to Victoria for interment in
Westminster Abbey.
