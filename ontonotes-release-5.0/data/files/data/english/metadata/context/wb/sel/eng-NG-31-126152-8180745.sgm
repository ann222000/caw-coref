Summing Up: How Much of Leadership Is About Control, Delegation, or  Theater?
_ http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5718.html
_ ( http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5718.html ) Summing  up the many responses, Jim
Heskett says that the mix of control, delegation, and  theater employed by
successful leaders depends on timing and circumstances. &quot;The  strongest messages I
received were that if leadership involves control, it is  only over setting
an organization's course and priorities.&quot;

Good afternoon -

Has anyone worked with Nassau Inn in Princeton? It's a historic hotel
property that, from the website, looks lovely, but I'd prefer someone's
personal opinion to their own! I am looking for an upscale location for
a small (20 person) dinner/meeting in September in or near Princeton but
have very little knowledge of the area.

Can anyone help please? Thank you!

This might not be close enough for Princeton
but....You could try the Lambertville house--
http://www.lambertvillehouse.com/
(NOT to be confused with the Lambertville Inn)I sited
it for guest rooms only for my wedding-- we had
several &quot;high maintaince guests that stayed there.
They loved it.

Lambertville NJ /New HopePA are on the opposite sides
of the Delaware river--many NJ pharmas use LH when
their European reps are visiting -- its a walking kind
of town. There are several resturants in walking
distance from the LH( so enjoying  your wine is not a
driving kind of liability at least) The French Bakery
on the PA side of the river is just Awesome!

This is one of my favorite places on earth...I start
to decompress just thinking about it.

Hi MiForum ...

We're holding a series of regional dealer meetings in October &amp;
November.  Looking for audio-visual company recommendations in (or near)
the following cities:

*
Mystic, CT
*
Indianapolis
*
Orlando
*
Las Vegas

We don't need a large production company; our requirements are pretty
simple, but will include some basic lighting.

No suppliers please; planner recommendations only.
Thanks much.

Hi Listers',

I need centerpiece ideas for dessert stations.  Here is what I know thus
far:

The event: Consulting Business Re-Launch Party (my client has redesigned her
logo and has been in business 7 yrs.  This will be the first reception/event
she has had for her clients and business associates).

Event title: Spoil Your Dinner

The food stations will be primarily desserts (themed Desserts Around The
World).  The dessert stations will be:

American

South of The Border

French Station

Italian Station

There will be an 'anchor station' with a few hot hors d'oeuvres (not related
to the theme)

I would like to make sure the countries are properly represented at each
station and easily identified without table cards.  Any help identifying
inexpensive ($10 - $20 per table) centerpieces or table 'art' for the food
stations would be helpful.

Thanks

Laura
