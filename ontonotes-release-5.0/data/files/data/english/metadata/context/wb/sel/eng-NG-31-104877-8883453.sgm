The Toy's The Thing Wherein I'll Catch The Attention of My Kids

Last week on vacation I reported purchasing a &quot;Shakespeare action
figure&quot;.  Without even opening it, this has fascinated my children.
&quot;Mommy bought Daddy a toy?  Are you excited, Daddy?  When do you think
Mommy will let you play with it?&quot; and so on.  Suddenly it's like I'm
one of them.

The best part, though, came the day we got home.  While unpacking,
Mr. Shakespeare was left sitting on the kitchen table, and was still
there while we had lunch.  That's when the real questions came.  &quot;Yes,
but Daddy, who was Shakespeare?&quot; my 5yr old asked.  &quot;What did he do?&quot;

&quot;Well he wrote stories,&quot; I said.

&quot;What kind of stories?  Were there any girls in the stories?&quot;  My two
oldest are girls, you see.

&quot;Oh sure, he wrote stories about girls all the time.  There's that one
about the girl named Miranda on the island that I've told you about,
Shakespeare wrote that one.&quot;  Speaking of The Tempest, by the way.

&quot;The girl on the island is a princess!&quot; my 3yr old pipes up.

&quot;As a matter of fact she is a princess,&quot; I confirm.  &quot;But she doesn't
know it yet.  A long time ago she was forced to leave her kingdom with
her father, who was a very powerful magician named Prospero, when the
bad guys came and took over the kingdom.  Miranda and her father
escaped on a boat and ended up on the island.&quot;

&quot;A boat?  Are there pirates in this story?&quot;

&quot;You know, there are pirates in this story, I'm glad you asked.  Two
pirates named Stephano and Trinculo were washed up onto the island
when their ship crashed.  There they met the sea monster named
Caliban, and together they tried to take over the whole island!&quot;

...and so on.  This went on, off and on, all day.  Over dinner my 5yr
old asks, &quot;Was Caliban nice to Miranda and her Daddy?&quot; and from down
the hall in the bathroom I hear my 3yr old yell, &quot;Are you talking
about Shakespeare?&quot;

I turned to my wife and said, &quot;You realize I'm in absolute bliss right
now, right?&quot;

By the way, I'm not supposed to get the toy (which has disappeared
from the kitchen table) until Christmas.  But after seeing results
like that I might buy them their own!  There was another series of
smaller, almost &quot;Little People&quot;-esque figures called &quot;Lord Crumwell's
Oddfellows Genius Collection&quot; that might be worth investing in,
especially if I can come home one day and find my 3yr old playing with
Shakespeare and Beethoven alongside her Barbies.

MM:
Very interesting, Lyra.  I suppose children could grow up with the
Shakespeare toys, then read his canon, later.  Thomas Carlyle wrote
&quot;Sartor Resartus,&quot; and he mentioned that anyone reading it would have
a &quot;bond,&quot; with him.  It's a similar process with reading the
Shakespeare canon.  A bond with a son of God is a good thing to have.

One could tell them Titus Andronicus is coming to get them when
they're
naughty. Saves getting those dang dumb Supernannies. I mean, really,
locking a child in the bathroom? And why is that so much better than
locking them in cupboards or cellars, like those child-abusing parents
used to do?
Years ago I tried to read my son the German
Grimm's tales, and he threw the book across the room and screamed
at me when he saw the story about the boy who had his finger-tips
cut off because he was lazy, or whatever that story was about. So
Titus won't be much different. Of course, Titus wasn't the actual
meanie, was he.

Buy kids Charles and Mary Lamb's Shakespeare's Tales, like I and
hopefully
every kid had as children.

A Shakespeare Geek's Dream

[I just realized that this story from the other day ended up on my
other blog...]

The other day I blogged about how bringing home a Shakespeare action
figure kicked off a whole round of telling my 3 and 5 yr olds stories
from Shakespeare.

Yesterday I hear my 3yr old playing and she says, &quot;The girl was on the
island, and then the witch threw her in the dungeon.&quot;

&quot;What's the witch's name?&quot; I ask, nodding at my wife to &quot;Watch
this...&quot;

&quot;Sycorax,&quot; says my daughter.

Love it.

The best part is how she knows about Sycorax (the witch from The
Tempest, by the way) in the first place is even better.  I don't tell
them about her, because she's not really crucial to the main
storyline.  &quot;Daddy,&quot; asks my 5 year old, &quot;How many girls are in this
story?&quot;

&quot;Just one.  Miranda is the only girl.&quot;

&quot;But in my book, I saw somebody else with long hair, and I think it's
another girl.&quot;  I may have mentioned that I have a comic book version
of The Tempest kicking around.

&quot;That's probably one of the pirates,&quot; I tell her.

&quot;I don't think so,&quot; she says, and goes to get the book.

Sure enough, she's looking at a picture of Sycorax.  So I have to
explain how that's the witch Sycorax, who ruled the island until
Prospero came and kicked her off. And how she was Caliban's mom, and
mean to Ariel and put her in a tree, until Prospero rescued her.

Struwwelpeter
by Heinrich Hoffmann
[translated by Mark Twain]

See this frowsy &quot;cratur&quot;
Pah! it's Struwwelpeter
On his fingers rusty,
On his two-head musty,
Scissors seldom come;
Lets his talons grow a year
Do any loathe him? Some!
They hail him &quot;Modern satyr -
Disgusting Struwwelpeter.&quot;
.................................
The Story of Little Suck-a-Thumb
http://www.fln.vcu.edu/struwwel/daumen_dual.html
.
One day, Mamma said, &quot;Conrad dear,
I must go out and leave you here.
But mind now, Conrad, what I say,
Don't suck your thumb while I'm away.
The great tall tailor always comes
To little boys that suck their thumbs.
And ere they dream what he's about
He takes his great sharp scissors
And cuts their thumbs clean off, - and then
You know, they never grow again.&quot;
.
Mamma had scarcely turn'd her back,
The thumb was in, alack! alack!
.
The door flew open, in he ran,
The great, long, red-legged scissorman.
Oh! children, see! the tailor's come
And caught our little Suck-a-Thumb.
.
Snip! Snap! Snip! the scissors go;
And Conrad cries out - Oh! Oh! Oh!
Snip! Snap! Snip! They go so fast;
That both his thumbs are off at last.
Mamma comes home; there Conrad stands,
And looks quite sad, and shows his hands;-
&quot;Ah!&quot; said Mamma &quot;I knew he'd come
To naughty little Suck-a-Thumb.&quot;

Struwwelpeter (From Wikipedia)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struwwelpeter
.
&lt;&lt;Struwwelpeter has been translated into several languages.
The first English translation appeared in 1848.
One English translation is due to Mark Twain.
.
Struwwelpeter is somewhat notorious for its perceived brutal
treatment of the erring children. Despite (or perhaps because
of) this, it has been influential on many later children's
books, most notably Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
.
There is a Struwwelpeter museum in Frankfurt, Germany.
.
Peter's frightful appearance is intentionally mirrored in that of
the titular character in the 1991 film Edward Scissorhands, unable
to groom himself due to having been created as an artificial man
with scissors instead of hands, and having similarly messy hair to
Peter's, and sharp scissors where Peter had untamed fingernails.
.
Adolf Hitler was parodied as a Struwwelpeter caricature
in 1941 in a book called Struwwelhitler published
in Britain under the pseudonym Dr. Schrecklichkeit.
.
This book was carried around by the poet Dylan Thomas.&gt;&gt;

Grimm..... and Grimmer
http://www.exulanten.com/grimm.html
.
&lt;&lt;Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were above all else scholars.
They began their work at a time when Germany was divided into
many tiny principalities and duchies, many overrun by the French
under Napoleon, who sometimes suppressed the local culture.
This troubled the brothers Grimm, and they undertook a folk tale
collection to preserve the endangered oral tradition of Germany.
The single major unifying factor for the Germans at that time
was a common language.
.
The folk tales that the Grimms collected had not originally been
considered children's stories. The brothers tried to keep the stories
in a form as close as possible historically to the original mode.
In the original 'Snow White,' for instance, the evil stepmother is
forced to dance in red hot iron shoes until she collapses and dies.
Other characters are stripped, tortured, and thrown in nail studded
barrels. Doves peck out the eyes of Cinderella's stepsisters, and
in 'The Juniper Tree' a woman decapitates her stepson. In 'Hansel
and Gretel' the witch ends baking alive up in the oven. In Snow White
alone, one finds cannibalism, hanging, stabbing, strangulation and
poisoning, not too far off from today's news stories. These gruesome
punishments inflicted on the Grimm villains caused some discomfort
toward the stories. The brothers initially refused even to consider
illustrations, instead preferring scholarly footnotes. Later, when
they realized that children were actually reading them, they often
rewrote versions considered appropriate for the time, especially
when the folk tales often could be quite sexually explicit...
'Rapunzel' really did let down her hair!
.
The Allies occupying Germany after World War Two, having effectively
incinerated millions of civilians in brutal bombings, embarked upon
the &quot;re-education&quot; of Germans to eliminate violence from their
culture.
The Grimm Fairy Tales were among thousands of books banned and burned
during this psychological experiment lest the folk tales exert a 'bad
influence.' Some very old and rare editions of the works were lost
forever in the process, leaving only the sanitized versions available
in the land of their creation. The Grimm tales still cause
controversy.
However, the intent of the brilliant Grimm brothers was not to shock,
degenerate or inspire people to violence, but to record and preserve
an important part of the German language and cultural history at
a time it was in danger. No truer thoughts could possibly exist.
...................................................
Beyond Grimm: Their home was their Kassel
.
Now, Here is a REALLY scary story...
Kassel as such is first mentioned in 913 as Chasella and it was
a fortification at a bridge crossing the Fulda river. In 1567,
the landgraviate of Hesse made Kassel its capital, and it
became a center of Calvanist Protestantism with Catholic-proof
fortifications. Kassel became a refuge for 1700 Huguenots in
1685, the year Joseph Schaitberger was exiled from Salzburg.
In the late 18th century, Hesse-Kassel langraves sold their
soldiers as mercenaries to the British.
.
When the Brothers Grimm lived in Kassel, they collected and wrote
most of their folk tales shortly before Napoleon annexed it in 1807,
and it became the capital of the Kingdom of Westphalia under
Napoleon's brother Jerome. Next, it was annexed by Prussia in 1866,
and soon Kassel ceased to be a princely residence. Its illustrious
past would be no match for the night of hell that waited to pounce.
On the night of October 22, 1943, British bombers feigned an attack
on Frankfurt so as to catch Kassel unprepared. Five minutes later,
569 Bombers instead turned and aimed their forces at Kassel and
destroyed 90% of the ancient city center, killing over 10,000 people
in a firestorm comparable to the one in Hamburg 3 months earlier
which had successfully murdered 40,000-50,000 people. For 80
minutes, waves of bombers dropped at least 1,800 tons of high
explosives and incendiaries in  bombing was so intense that
bombs fell with a density of up to two per square meter.
Every building in the city center was hit by at least two liquid
incendiary bombs and 460,000 &quot;firesticks&quot; rained on the city
creating a firestorm with temperatures of 1500?C and above,
consuming nearly all oxygen as it pulled fresh air into the fire.
People trying to escape the fire zone were caught in the ensuing
100 mph wind and sucked back into the fire. Those who fled into
cellars suffocated. The attack on Kassel  destroyed 76 % of the
houses and 85 % of all dwellings. Most of the casualties were
civilians or wounded soldiers recuperating in local hospitals,
whereas Kassel's heavy weapons factories survived the attack
almost undamaged. It instantly left 150,000 families homeless.
. The attack on Kassel included one of the most accurate target
markings since the Hamburg firestorm raid because the RAF
introduced Operation Corona on the night of the raid to confuse
the German nightfighters, making the raid a complete 'success.'
.
Kassel, which had a pre-raid population of 236,000 in 1939, burned
for 7 days. It took weeks to collect all the corpses from the streets
and out of the ruined cellars. When Americans, the folks who would
later ban the Grimm brothers' stories for &quot;violence,&quot; captured
the city in March 1945, only 50,000 people were living there.&gt;&gt;
........................................................
&lt;&lt;Other Treasures of Terror for the Young of Heart and Sound of
Thumb....DER STRUWWELPETER More than one hundred years after he hit
the marketplace, psychologists, academicians, writers, scientists
and teachers are still in a stew over Slovenly Peter, the story of
a boy who had bad manners, and this broth gives intellectuals an
excuse for summits, sabbaticals, studies, conferences and grant
requests to yak in depth about the effects of simply dispensing
with thumbs as a cure for the dreaded thumbsucking. Another book
banned for violence by the sainted and non-violent Allies was DER
STRUWWELPETER. Still controversial, the gory lessons are simple
and honest: if one teases dogs one might get bitten, playing with
fire might result in death. Now we have car-jackings carried out
by people who never heard of Slovenly Peter and perhaps should have.
In 1844, Frankfurt doctor and lunatic asylum supervisor Heinrich
Hoffman, 18O9-1894, who was tired of boring children's books,
composed the book known in English as Slovenly Peter, a collection
of &quot;cautionary&quot; tales
