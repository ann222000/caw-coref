Spotted today in Rome, NY:

Weather conditions about 15F, spotty snow, streets ICY in many spots

Dude on Yellow colored Vespa style scooter approaching me from opposite side
of intersection while I was stopped at a red light

He was on ice.  He had to stop somehow for red light.  As soon as I saw his
hand touch the brake lever, scooter went sideways and he landed (skidding)
on his left foot.  Did not low-side though.  Had the entire weight of
scooter plus rider on one leg.

I wish I could ride my motorcycle, but this weather is just a bit too
extreme for two-wheeling for my tastes.  :)  -Dave

If I lived up in the frozen north... I'd forget Vespa and get a Honda
Reflex with ABS.  Even then, I'd imagine you still will have problems
with ice traction on turns, even with ABS.

I can't imagine how friggin' scary riding on ice must be.  It seems
more like "insane" to me.  "Hardcore" as in "hardcore insane".

Here in Florida it rains alot.  Hard rain.  I have ridden in a few
rainstorms.  It isn't too bad, but then I have decent tires and I don't
push it at all (in fact I usually slow the hell down, usually about 5
mph below the speed limit, even if it probably pisses other drivers).
I usually prefer not riding in heavy rain, especially if the streets
have been dry for days, but I don't have anything against riding in a
light rain.  A scooter is better in the rain because of the
splashguard.  On a motorcycle in a heavy rain my boots will get soaked,
my pants get soaked... it's pretty nasty.  In fact I'm thinking if I
keep that up I'll probably sell my motorcycle and go scooter only- way
more comfortable on chilly days and in the rain.  Some of the bigger
motorcycles like the Concours look awesome because they have a big
faring that looks like it would keep alot of the weather off your legs.
But then it is a really big bike and would be overkill.

But ice, gravel, sand, etc. sound to me like they'd really, really
suck.

There's a guy that does a blog and he rides a Baron (Chinese)
scooter.  He lives up in Minnesota and rides around all year.  He
crashes all the time.  I forgot his name but "The Baron in Winter"
should show up on Google.

You do not have to do that.  Modern tires have plenty of traction in
the rain as long as they aren't bald.

Here in Oregon it also rains a lot, if you want to ride you have to learn
to ride in the rain.

The only time it's bad is the first few days of rain in Sept. following
a long string of hot days.

Not agreeing or disagreeing with anyone, but on the subject of rain, I've
ridden through many rainstorms (moderate to heavy rain) and the secret is
full fairing, windscreen and full-face helmet, and KEEP MOVING.  As long as
you can keep near the speed limit, you get kind of an air bubble around you.
The rain will hit your helmet, and your knees stick out into the rain if you
are lazy.  But the helmet is good protection, and who cares if the knees get
a little wet?  Other than that, you stay pretty dry if you keep
oving.  -Dave

Aint that the truth?

I see "The Ped Boys" tear arseing around in ALL weathers and at all times of
the day or night with fuck all in the way of protective clothing and more
often than not, not even a coat on.

Hard as nails or thick as pigshit, I don't know and I don't care, they're
hard bastads and no mistake.

I can live happily with most weather, but I draw the line at riding on roads
that are covered in ice, or likely to get that way in the immediate future.
Riding isn't the problem it's the stopping.

I wish I'd known all that before I went to Holland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden

see ANYTHNG except rain and lightning for 3 solid 12 hour days. No fairing,
no windscreen and a flip front lid. It was fucking superb.

I had good tyres and a good textile jacket, plus a pair of waterproof pull

I like what

http://www.ridetowork.org/baroninwinter/

says about the scooter:

| Let’s review the advantages of a scooter over a motorcycle
| for this mission:
|
| 1) Light weight, means less inertia if we get out of
| control, and easier to stop.
|
| 2) Low ride height, means that I can put my feet down with
| knees bent, to help maintain control.
|
| 3) Low power, so the rear wheel has less tendency to spin.
|
| 4) All controls are on the handlebars, so I can wear big,
| warm boots and use my feet as outriggers without
| compromising braking.
|
| 5) Lots of plastic covering critical components, so
| corrosion isn’t as bad.
|
| 6) Small motor, which is easy to kickstart and runs off a
| magneto, so keeping the battery charged isn’t so important.
|
| All of these points proved out, over the course of the
| Winter.

IMHO, usually a scooter rider rides daily and has more
practical experience with bike, so he understands all the
nuances of its handling in differing conditions, versus the
the weekend warrior.  Investment in a small scooter is less,
so he/she is willing to take chances others would decline on.

Also, one who has a scooter may not have other pieces of
transportation (economy is greatest motive), so they are
forced to ride under all sorts of conditions that would faint
a weekend warrior.

Since they are lighter in weight, when dropped they tend to
not develop as serious damage like one does with a heavy
expensive bike, which builds confidence.

Also being light weight, probably make them a decent trails
bike, as long as one watches for chuck holes.

Buy a mud flap for the Rebel's front fender.  I did for my
Savage, makes a big difference. A lot of that boot spray is
due to the "bobbed" front fender, which looks cute but does
little in the way of curtailing road splash from the front
tyre.

Probably the most practical rain warrior is the humble Honda
90 cc Cub, which is not available in US unfortunately.  It
has a decent front splash guard.

I have heard that the 250 cc scooters are a step up from the

Speaking of scooters, the smaller motorcycles in similar vein
make excellent scooters.  Back in the late '70s, early '80s
as a college student, I thoroughly thrashed my only
transportation, a 1971 Honda CB100.  It got close to 100 mpg,
was low cost on insurance and with a set of ABS hard saddle
bags and luggage rack, had all I needed to get around.  I
took it everywhere on and off road.  I wore out 3 sets of
tyres on it before leaving Hawaii.

Nowadays my daily rider is my 1987 Savage.  There is
something to be said about daily riding.  I have had times
where I have encountered a slick portion of road, like just
after or during a rain storm.  Bike would start to slide and
I would quickly recover.  One also learns to carefully
control the throttle.  Bike becomes so familiar, it is like
an extension to one's soul.

I did it one winter with a 250 two stroke single, weighing in
about 300+ lbs. Think motard/enduro. Two strokes are
also way easier to start in the cold I think.

Crashing in snow and ice is no big thing as long as you've
got the road to yourself. You slide a little, then typically
hit a snowbank, pick yourself up and carry on. The most
important thing you can do to protect yourself is stay
out of traffic.

If you're really getting drenched in the rain, it's because you
haven't got the right gear. Good motorcycle boots and
apparel are designed to keep you dry and can do a pretty
good job of it these days.

Fuckin' scooter riders are nuts. There are swarms of them in LA. And while
I'm layered they are wearing shorts, flip flops and tank tops. The sight
almost makes me glad we have helmet laws.

Now, did you know that in Nevada if you ride a motorcycle, you must wear a
helmet. But, scooter riders are exempt?
Now that's just nuts, as well.

Luckly that guy was on a scooter, and not on some big heavy Rune, or
something.

&gt;&gt; I wish I could ride my motorcycle, but this weather is just a bit too
&gt;&gt; extreme for two-wheeling for my tastes.  :)  -Dave

&gt; I rode Tuesday...  It wasn't quite THAT cold, but I also had a 35 mile,
&gt; highway commute each way...

&gt; Good reason though as my bike was needed for a photo shoot.

&gt; for work as it's probably blatant non-work stuff.

outer space.

Why not just shove a steel bar up your ass and locate the other end in your
helmet? That way at least your bike will look less embarrassed:)
