Patrick Carpentier gets Cup ride for road course at Watkins Glen
at 13:12 on August 7, 2007, EST.
JENNA FRYER

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Fresh off a second-place finish in his stock
car debut, Patrick Carpentier on Tuesday got another job in NASCAR:
He'll race the Nextel Cup event at Watkins Glen.

Carpentier, from Joliette, Que., will replace Scott Riggs in the No.
10 Dodge this weekend. The car is not inside the top 35 in points, so
it is not assured a spot in the field and Carpentier will have to
qualify it on speed to make Sunday's race.

Based on his first foray last weekend, it should be no problem for the
former open-wheel star.

Carpentier paced almost every practice session for the Busch Series
race in Montreal, then won the pole, led 14 laps and finished second
in Saturday's race. It came just six days after the Quebec native
tested his very first stock car.

I hope he does as well but I not sure he can on a track he's never raced on
before. Or maybe he did get a chance with the IRL, but they would have used
the long course.

Well, he’s not an IRL has been either. He drove (and did pretty well)
one season for Eddie Cheevers who took his place when he returned behind
the wheel. He would have been rookie of the year that season if he had
not retired himself from the contest arguing that he had raced in too
many Champ Car race to be considered a rookie.

Not to mention the spectacular barrel roll/multi-flip he did at Road America
when Michael Andretti tipped him.  Patrick later said, with his usual
infectious grin, &quot;All I saw was grass... sky... grass...sky...&quot;
Any video of that one?

Wasn't that the race where he promised he would run naked around the track
if he won???  And hed did it, at least for a few hundred feet, albeit draped
in the checkered flag.

IMO, Patrick has all the talent in the world, and he could have been a Champ
Car/CART superstar, but he was too busy having fun.  He had to sit out part
of an otherwise promising season more than once due to broken limbs suffered
while karting, biking, hang-gliding.... even once while moving homes if I
recall correctly.
And that's one of the reasons he's one of my all-time favorites.  He loves
to race, and he loves to have fun, so unlike the cookie-cutter professional
drivers of the 21st century.... they may be more successful, but Patrick had
a lot more fun!  And he has been a lot more fun for his fans, too.

Mid Ohio was where a checkered flag draped Patrick Carpentier
fulfilled his promise.
A talented driver who disappeared (as so many do) into the abyss of
the IRL for a while.  Some recover, some just enjoy a sort of
terminal invisibility there.  :-)
