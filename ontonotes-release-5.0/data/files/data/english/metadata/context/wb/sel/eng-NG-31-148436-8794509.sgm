Hi Tom

We are planning to be there and are willing to consider heading across and
up the Pine River to somewhere like Tinchi Tamba Wetlands Reserve for
dinner. When we paddled passed there back to Dohles Rocks the other night
there was a boat ramp, lights, a BBQ area, shelter and loos -

I will be at Fort Lytton this PM - hopefully this will not create a clutter
for time.

Susan

G'Day everyone,

I was wondering how many contenders there might be for tonight's night
paddle.

Does anyone have any local weather / water conditions ahead of tonight's
night paddle?  Is a paddle up the Pine River a valid alternative?

Dear all,

I am unavailable tonight.  I will be at an upmarket wedding at Coolum.
With the weather the way it is I may even have more fun than you after
all.

Brian.

Mark,

The distance last time was very close to 30 km.  As the tide is similar
it should be pretty well identical this time.

Mark,

Last time I did it the trip was 31.2 Km and here's the map with track.  I
paddled counter-clockwise to make the best use of the tides.

For those who are interested, pics from Saturday night's paddle are on
www.kayakdiary.net

As for who had the most fun Brian, at least we didn't have to dress to
impress.
