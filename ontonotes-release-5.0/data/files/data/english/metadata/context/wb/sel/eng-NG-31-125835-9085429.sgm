My neighbour has just had a large brick garage built within 2 meters of our
house (6 meters from his house) - They have run the rain water guttering for
this to drain at the back of the garage (our side) - It doesn't go into a
drain or a soak away but just drains straight onto the soil

We are also building an extention (for which i have permission) - And i am
ordered to build a soak away for the rain water a minimum of 5 meters from
the house

I am concerned about the rain water from his garage undermining my
foundations - what should I do?

None of them are required. The amount of water coming off the garage roof
will be the same as the amount that has been falling on the soil anyway. It
will be concentrated on to one small spot, but it's his spot, and this will
make no difference in practical terms.

Let me try. ok?
While you are correct in saying the ammount of water is the same, its
a case of it all being directed to a &quot;hot spot&quot; less than 2 metres away
from the OPs property. Therefore, this 2 metres is not only getting IT'S
share of rainfall, but being added to by the downspout from neighbours
garage.
As the OP also stated, he has been ORDERED to install a soakaway
for his extension, which indicates a local problem (heavy clay soil perhaps?)
Ask yourself why the OPs neighbour installed the guttering to drain on the
OPs side of this garage. Not wanting his garden turned into a quagmire
perhaps??

ok. This &quot;hot spot&quot; as you call it, is only 2 metres from the OPs
property,as you rightly observe. However, the rain falling there has only
been directed a couple of metres from where it would have fallen anyway,
it's not like it's been piped across the property.

Also, being ORDERED to install a soakaway does not indicate a &quot;local
problem&quot;, it's the norm when building an extension.

Ask yourself why the neighbour installed the guttering to drain on the OPs
side of the garage? Well, he installed it to the side of the garage anybody
would have, by the fence rather than in the middle of his garden. I would
have done the same. The OP isn't claiming any sinister intent here.

The water coming out of this downpipe is almost certainly going to find its
way to the same exit from the property as it does now, since the OP doesn't
mention anything to contradict this, just slightly quicker due to a few
square metres of soaking-in area being denied to it.

As for the quagmire, well did the OP mention any such problem? No I don't
think so. The bottom line is the same amount of water is going to land on
the neighbour's garden as it does now.

Nice try though.

Nope - To extend your logic - no building needs guttering - and if that's
your argument - i'm not interested

you wouldn't be playing semantics if it was your house

&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me try. ok?
&gt;&gt;&gt; While you are correct in saying the ammount of water is the same, its
&gt;&gt;&gt; a case of it all being directed to a &quot;hot spot&quot; less than 2 metres away
&gt;&gt;&gt; from the OPs property. Therefore, this 2 metres is not only getting IT'S
&gt;&gt;&gt; share of rainfall, but being added to by the downspout from neighbours
&gt;&gt;&gt; garage.
&gt;&gt;&gt; As the OP also stated, he has been ORDERED to install a soakaway
&gt;&gt;&gt; for his extension, which indicates a local problem (heavy clay soil
&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps?)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ask yourself why the OPs neighbour installed the guttering to drain on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; OPs side of this garage. Not wanting his garden turned into a quagmire
&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps??

&gt;&gt; ok. This &quot;hot spot&quot; as you call it, is only 2 metres from the OPs
&gt;&gt; property,as you rightly observe. However, the rain falling there has only
&gt;&gt; been directed a couple of metres from where it would have fallen anyway,
&gt;&gt; it's not like it's been piped across the property.

&gt;&gt; Also, being ORDERED to install a soakaway does not indicate a &quot;local
&gt;&gt; problem&quot;, it's the norm when building an extension.

&gt;&gt; Ask yourself why the neighbour installed the guttering to drain on the
&gt;&gt; OPs side of the garage? Well, he installed it to the side of the garage
&gt;&gt; anybody would have, by the fence rather than in the middle of his garden.
&gt;&gt; I would have done the same. The OP isn't claiming any sinister intent
&gt;&gt; here.

&gt;&gt; The water coming out of this downpipe is almost certainly going to find
&gt;&gt; its way to the same exit from the property as it does now, since the OP
&gt;&gt; doesn't mention anything to contradict this, just slightly quicker due to
&gt;&gt; a few square metres of soaking-in area being denied to it.

&gt;&gt; As for the quagmire, well did the OP mention any such problem? No I don't
&gt;&gt; think so. The bottom line is the same amount of water is going to land on
&gt;&gt; the neighbour's garden as it does now.

&gt;&gt; Nice try though.

&gt; Nope - To extend your logic - no building needs guttering - and if that's
&gt; your argument - i'm not interested

&gt; you wouldn't be playing semantics if it was your house
">

To extend the other way - The 2' x 2' slab my dustbin sits on needs a
soakaway - And if that's your argument I'm not interested.

I'm not arguing semantics, I'm trying to apply a bit of common sense. And
common sense says that the most likely thing to happen as a result of this
garage guttering is  -
Nothing.

For my money the OP has just got the hump because he had to put in a
soakaway and the neighbour didn't.

All right, back to practicalities. What I would do is this - Wait until it
rains, it shouldn't be a long wait, and see what happens. If the area gets
to be a big puddle, suggest he gets a water butt, and run the overflow from
it to a point suitable for you both. You can even get them for nothing if
you don't mind them being not exactly pretty. Loads of people are now having
condensing boilers put in, which depending on the type of system used, can
liberate the big tank from the loft. The plumbers will let you have these
for nothing, since it saves them having to landfill them. I've got several
on my allotment. When I see the telltale signs I just go and have a word
with them, I've not been turned down yet. If the neighbour is a gardener
he's probably thinking of  something like this anyway.

Jethro,

Does the rainwater from the garage drain directly onto your property?

If it does, then you can insist that he alters the drainage system so that
it does not.

If it drains onto his property and naturally 'soaks away' into the ground
before crossing your boundary then you have little chance of doing anything
about it unless you can prove that the water actually comes from that source
(using a coloured dye) and that it is causing damage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That is a requirement of your permissions and it must be accepted.  Garages
under a certain size, construction and distance from a boundary do not need
building reg approval.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There will be no danger from that amount of water either from subsidence,
rising damp or flooding if your extension is correctly built - now 'ponding'
water in the garden is another matter!

Richard,

It's on a little island called Margarita just off the Venezuelan coast!

As a matter of interest, white rum is £3 a litre, there's no road tax or MoT
test and the island is predominantly tax free but with a high inflation rate
(2,150 Bolivar equals just 51 pence).

Oh and it's bloody hot!

Yup, that was my most favourite place.  We anchored off Pampatar -
lovely beach, with beer 5 US cents a bottle at the beach kiosks.
Diesel at that time (1980's) was 5 US cents a US gallon.

Absolutely brilliant society as well, with some of the most friendly
people I have ever come across.

You are right about inflation - prices on items in supermarkets were
being changed almost every day.  And nobody bothers with centivos, any
change under a Bolivar was given in sweets.

Quite a few small islands around Venezuala have no permanent (human)
inhabitants - nice if you want to &quot;get away from it all&quot;.  We stayed a
couple of days on Los Testigos.  Immigration formalities are DIY - a
small wooden hut with a book that you sign in &amp; out (if you feel like
doing so).

Another brilliant island is St Helena (still a British island, except
for a couple of acres that belong to France), though that is
*extremely* isolated, with no commercial transport to speak of going
to the island, so the only &quot;tourists&quot; are trans-Atlantic yotties.

Do I require permission for a garage?

You will not require permission if the garage is more than 5 metres
from your house, unless you live in a listed building. You must,
however, comply with Rules L - O below.
Note 7 - A garage will be treated as an extension and Rules A - F in
Section 1,
&quot;Building an Extension&quot; will apply if -
i. your house is in a Conservation Area; or,

ii. the garage is to be within 5 metres of your house (see Note 3).

Otherwise Rules L - O apply (see Illustration 6).

Rule L. The garage must be used for domestic purposes only.

Rule M. No part of the garage should be nearer to any road than the
part of the original house nearest to the road.

Rule N. The height of the garage must not be more than 4 metres high
if it has a ridged roof, or 3 metres in any other case.

Rule O. The ground area covered by the garage and any other buildings
within the boundary of the property (excluding the original house)
must not be more than half the total area.
