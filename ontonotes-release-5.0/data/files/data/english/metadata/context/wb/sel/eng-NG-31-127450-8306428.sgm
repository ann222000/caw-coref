Forbes: Damon's a `Bourne' moneymaker

1 hour, 34 minutes ago

NEW YORK - Matt Damon is Hollywood's best investment, says Forbes. com.

For every dollar he was paid for his last three roles, Damon brought in
$29 of gross income, the site calculated.

That put the 36-year-old &quot;Bourne&quot; star atop a Forbes list of 22 film
heavyweights, ranked by the same financial formula.

The first two &quot;Bourne&quot; movies grossed an estimated $850 [million]at the
box office and in DVD sales, Forbes said. The third installment, &quot;The
Bourne Ultimatum,&quot; opened last weekend and raked in $70.2 million at the
box office. It was the biggest August film opening ever.

I thought they were two names for the same guy, like David Johansen/Buster
Poindexter, or Garth Brooks/Chris Gaines....

Or, closer to the point, Tobey Maguire/Topher Grace....r

Ah, that's a new one on me. I always thought they were lovers.

I gotta admit, I do enjoy the Bourne stuff.
