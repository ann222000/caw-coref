As we all know, as the years passed Tolkien began to worry about the fact
that Orcs seemed to be irredeemably evil, since such a concept contradicted
his Catholic faith. Whereas he earlier had been content to say that the
question was irrelevant since they were only creatures in a fairy-story, he
now tried to devise various ways to evade having irredeemably evil, sentient
beings in his books. One of his suggested solutions was that the Orcs were
simply soulless automatons. However, from what we see of the Orcs in LotR,
it is very hard to perceive them as so depersonalized . There is also this
statement by Gorbag in &quot;The Choices of Master Samwise&quot;:

&quot;Grr! Those Nazgûl give me the creeps. And they skin the body off you as
soon as look at you, and leave all cold in the dark on the other side&quot;.

To met, that sounds like a definite statement about a soul that can be
separated from the body.
Of course, I think Tolkien could have got out of the trap by simply saying
that it was quite possible that after death, Orcs were given a second chance
and sent to some kind of purgatory.

Part of the problem is the question: what were the Orcs?

Some Orcs, in particular their &quot;great captains&quot; were, at times, stated
or implied to be embodied Maiar.

In some conceptions, Orcs were made from stone. If this sounds like
something that would be said of Dwarves, well, yes, it was said of
Dwarves and survived (for Dwarves) as an erroneous belief of Men.

The dominant conception was that Orcs were perversions of Elves and/or
Men. This, of course, reflected the determination that even the
mightiest Vala could not actually create life (note that the Dwarves
were created by Aule and given life by Eru).

Actually, whether the Orcs derived from Men is unclear: if Orcs
appeared before Men appeared, then that seems unlikely, although
Orc-Man matings might have been treated as Orcs.

If Orcs are perverted Elves, then their fear are Elven fear and, after
the death of the body, they go to Mandos (Elvish section) were they
are, indeed, subject to purgation, much as Feanor, but perhaps longer.

If Orcs are perverted Men, then they should share the fate of Men,
whatever that may be. If there is a purgatory for Men, it is beyond
the Wall of Night, and so the Orcs would go there as well.

If Orcs are perverted mixes of Elf and Man, then they should be
treated as Elves. It might be thought they had a choice, but Elwing
had no choice, her brothers had no choice, Dior Thingol's Heir had no
choice: choice of Elf or Man appears to be limited to Elros, Elrond,
and Elrond's children.

I do not doubt that JRRT was bothered by this problem. But, as I have
said before, he presumably believed that God provided souls to people
like Hitler and Stalin, and so should not have been bothered by the
idea that Eru provided fear to Orcs -- who in /The Hobbit/ and /LOTR/
are depicted as clearly lower-class, crude in speech and habits,
forming the worst sort of army to be in, desirous of slipping away and
founding their own very petty little totalitarian states.

My understanding is that the original orcs were Firstborn
corrupted by Melkor. Later on, orklings born into the Skid Rows
and ghettos of Beleriand and raised in single parent families
by thieves, pimps and gang members (such as the Morgul Mobster
Disciples) found it hard to break out of the cycle of crime
and poverty.

However, even the aristocracy were subject to irredeemable evil
and corruption. An example of this can be seen in Oscar Wilde's
novel, _A Picture of Dorian Gnome_, where Dorian seems unable
to do anything decent and every step he takes leads only to ruin.

That's not necessarily true.

&quot;'My dear tender little fools,' hissed Grishnakh, 'everything you have,
and everything you know, will be got out of you in due time: everything!
You'll wish there was more that you could tell to satisfy the Questioner,
indeed you will: quite soon! We shan't hurry the enquiry. Oh dear no! What
do you think you've been kept alive for? My dear little fellows, please
believe me when I say that it was not out of kindness: that's not even one
of Ugluk's faults.'&quot;

This is not just grammatically correct; it's practically public-school.
Note the usages like 'shan't' and 'my dear little fellows,' as well as the
Brit-nob circumlocution 'please believe me when I tell you.' This is not
working-class at all: one could almost imagine Grishnakh stroking a white
Angora cat!

If anything could be said to characterize this speech it's that it is
*modern*- a very 20th-century idiom: and Tolkien seemed to like playing
with modern faux-politeness and language affectations wrapping evil
intent, as with Smaug, Chrysophylax, and that Ur-modernist Saruman.

In fact, reviewing the chapter /The Uruk-hai/, I see nothing in the speech
of Isengarders, Northerners, or the Lugburz contingent which can be marked
as 'lower-class.' Shagrat and Gorbag are slightly more slang-y, but
nowhere near as colloquial as the rural Hobbits.  The only Orc we meet, in
fact, whose speech comes across as remotely 'debased and corrupted' is the
tracker, Snaga, who is lower-class even by Orc standards- and his diction
isn't shared by his big Uruk companion.

I'm amused frankly by one critic who went on about &quot;Cockney&quot; Orcs,
&quot;dropped Aitches and all&quot;....when in fact there is not one single elided H
or deformed vowel-sound anywhere in Tolkien's Orc-speech- the fact that
the critic *heard* them that way with his mental ear says rather more
about the critic's class-assumptions than Tolkien's!

I don't have the book readily available; I do recall some harsh
language between Orcs. I may also be confusing the book with the film,
where intonation and facial expression may have influenced my opinion.

On the other hand, I seem to vaguely recall a note somewhere where
JRRT stated that the actual language of the Orcs was far fouler than
he portrayed it -- in other words, what we have is considerably
cleaned up. That may have influenced my impression as well.

You know, there's a part of the Fate and Free Will thread that might bear
on this (for us; I don't think it occurred to JRRT).  Remember where
Aquinas in the Summa concludes that men are incapable of even the least
good act but for Divine grace?  St Tom then goes on of course to argue
that therefore some level of grace is available to all, since even pagans
and unbelievers plainly do behave virtuously.

But what if we explored the other fork of the argument?  Shippey has
pointed out that Orcs clearly do have a moral sense- they have a set of
values which most would agree are 'good:' but apparently *always* fail to
act upon them.

Could Orcs therefore be seen as those who are utterly without Divine
grace, and therefore incapable of the least good action?

Mythologically, I suppose, one might see the Orcs as having been descended
from those Men who were first seduced by the Dark, and went deepest into
its service; perhaps its priests and Levites, the one who seized others
for thaie sacrifices: their condemnation was thus even worse than that
accorded to other Men, their dupes and victims. These Men were denied any
scrap of Grace: whereas Men (in M-E and, to a Catholic, in our world) have
an inborn propensity to sin, these Men &gt; Orcs would be *guaranteed* to
sin, at all times. (After all, as a Catholic Tolkien *shouldn't* have had
a problem with the heritability of sin!)

At some point in the past, I was pointed to a bit of Aquinas on-line
in which &quot;building a house&quot; was given as an example of &quot;a good deed&quot;.

Consider the Goblins in the Hobbit: have they not created, if not a
house, then at least a home? They have a society, a warm fire, a food
supply and, for all we know, women and children. (Actually, we /do/
know they have children hanging around -- we are told that Gollum ate
them when he could catch them -- and so they must have had women there
as well). Would these not be &quot;good things&quot; requiring some measure of
grace?

Most of the Orcs we encounter close-up in LOTR are in military
service, which is why they are all male (at the time it was written,
this was very nearly true of most of our armies). While I suspect that
non-military Orc culture was rather crude, the military version
appears to move beyond crude into nasty. And yet, even in this
context, the fact that lower-ranking Orcs follow orders [1] (at least
some of them, some of the time) is, in military terms, a &quot;good thing&quot;
-- again requiring some measure of grace.

Note that this has nothing to do with the dialect of English used to
portray their speech. It has to do rather with the content of their
speech -- and so with the content of their thought.

I think JRRT just thought himself into a box on this point, and could
not find his way out again.

[1] Indeed, the mere fact that they recognized that they were supposed
to follow orders is a &quot;good thing&quot;, and the fact that some of them
fought others on whether or not to do so or whose orders to follow is
even more of a &quot;good thing&quot;.

Another indication of the same thing is that Gorbag's statement (or was it
Shagrat's?) that &quot;the Elvish warrior&quot; accompanying Frodo had simply left him
to his fate was followed by the comment: &quot;Regular Evish trick&quot;, even though
Shagrat mentions an even more appalling act of callousness by the Orcs
(&quot;Remember old Ufthak?&quot;, and so on) in the same chapter. Orcs also liked to
accuse others of &quot;treachery&quot;, something they themselves were very prone to.

Just keep in mind that Orcs did not speak English, and that JRRT
(IIRC) stated explicitly that he cleaned up their language when
translating it.

Perhaps its just living in the USA rather than, say, GB, but when I
say &quot;lower class&quot; I am not referring to diction, grammer, and
pronunciation but rather to the concepts expressed and thoughts those
concepts reveal. And I probably should not say &quot;lower class&quot; at all,
but instead describe the culture directly.

Do the concepts conveyed by the example above, to your mind, sound

At the risk of sounding like a smartass, I'd say that they speak like Orcs.
There are lots of growls and snarls such as &quot;Ar!&quot; and &quot;Nar!&quot; (as well as the
working-class interjection &quot;Garn!&quot;), some exchanges that sound like the
utterances of criminals or very boorish &quot;other ranks&quot; - and then there is
the upmarket, public school kind of vicious talk exemplified by Grishnákh,
whose voice was &quot;softer and more evil&quot;. This is in contrast with how Uglúk
ends giving orders with the words: &quot;That clear?&quot;; he sounds very much like a
rather nasty gaffer (a foreman at a factory, not any of the other meanings
of the word) or a sergeant in a rather scruffy outfit.

Well, yes, except that Orcs didn't speak English and (IIRC) JRRT
cleaned up their language a bit.

The original point, incidentally, was that Orcs speak and behave very
much like some groups of people do, and this suggests that they are
neither automatons nor irredeemably evil, which in turn suggests that
Eru should have no problem providing them with fear.

Even so, their speech patterns were inevitably influenced by the mannerisms
of people inr eal lfie, for example surly workers and British public school

Thats's an excellent point. If the Orcs were soulless, they would presumably
not have known anythign about fear, and certainly not in the abstract.
Inidentally, I was puzzled by one item in your previous post but neglected
to respond to it. You wrote: &quot;And I probably should not say 'lower class' at

that class and culture are coterminous categories?

&gt;&gt; The original point, incidentally, was that Orcs speak and behave very
&gt;&gt; much like some groups of people do, and this suggests that they are
&gt;&gt; neither automatons nor irredeemably evil, which in turn suggests that
&gt;&gt; Eru should have no problem providing them with fear.

&gt;Thats's an excellent point. If the Orcs were soulless, they would presumably
&gt;not have known anythign about fear, and certainly not in the abstract.

I don't usually try to use non-ASCII characters, but the last word of
my paragraph was intended to be &quot;fëar&quot;, which (pedantically) is what
Men and Elves have in place of &quot;souls&quot;.

&gt;  Inidentally, I was puzzled by one item in your previous post but neglected
&gt;to respond to it. You wrote: &quot;And I probably should not say 'lower class' at
&gt;all, but instead describe the culture directly.&quot; Surely you are not saying
&gt;that class and culture are coterminous categories?
">

I meant that when I use &quot;lower class&quot; I get responses which clearly do
equate class and, if not culture, than certainly dialect -- and then
use JRRT's &quot;schoolboy English&quot; cleaned-up version of Orc speech to
&quot;prove&quot; that they were not &quot;lower class&quot;.

In other words, it causes more harm than it is worth and it is not
needed to make my point.

Although, if we consider your theory that JRRT had servants and never
did housework (except during the war, of course), and that his use of
&quot;blood&quot; suggests a certain mode of thought, well, you know, that
&quot;certain mode of thought&quot; is characterized by the belief that not only
culture but what a person can do in the future are determined by
class. So it seems probable to me that JRRT modeled Orcish behavior on
what he viewed as lower-class culture. It certainly wasn't modeled on
upper-class or even middle-class culture!

&gt; and Elrond's children.

&gt; I do not doubt that JRRT was bothered by this problem. But, as I have
&gt; said before, he presumably believed that God provided souls to people
&gt; like Hitler and Stalin, and so should not have been bothered by the
&gt; idea that Eru provided fear to Orcs -- who in /The Hobbit/ and /LOTR/
&gt; are depicted as clearly lower-class, crude in speech and habits,
&gt; forming the worst sort of army to be in, desirous of slipping away and
&gt; founding their own very petty little totalitarian states.

The problem is that Lenin and Stalin were not _born_ evil.  It's a
given that they _could_ have been different, they could have made
different choices, followed other paths.

The problem of the Orcs is that they appear to have been corrupted _as
a race_.  It's not hard to imagine that Morgorth might sway ancient
Elves to his service, leading them into evil.  But the idea that Eru
would provide souls to creatures _born_ evil runs directly counter to
Christian thinking and to the theological framework of Tolkein's
stories.

The problem has no easy solution.

Changing Orcs from corrupt Elves to corrupt Men?  No effect at all on
the moral/theological aspect.

Making orcs into biological automata?  That fixes the theological
problem, but is utterly unbelievable in the context of the stories.
Ugluk, Grishnakh, Shagrat and Gorbag, etc, all showed too much free
will for that to fly.  They even have a moral sense, as famously noted
when they refer to abandoning one's comrades as an 'Elvish sort of
trick'.

No question about it, in my mind from readin LOTR and _The Hobbit_,
Orcs are people too.

&gt; to his fate was followed by the comment: &quot;Regular Evish trick&quot;, even though
&gt; Shagrat mentions an even more appalling act of callousness by the Orcs
&gt; (&quot;Remember old Ufthak?&quot;, and so on) in the same chapter. Orcs also liked to
&gt; accuse others of &quot;treachery&quot;, something they themselves were very prone to.

In this respect, it might be a matter of _degree_.  Elves and Men
don't live up to what we know is right either, though we get closer
than Orcs on average.  For example, John or Joan knows that cheating
on their spouse is wrong...yet they do it anyway.  They might be
wracked with guilt, but at the same time unable to overcome the
temptation of it.

The Orcs are treacherous and disloyal, but think about this:  they
can't _always_ behave that way, in every possible instance.  If they
did, they could not function as a race, there must be times when Orcs
do live up to their duties absent a threat.  They're _more_
treacherous than Elves and Men on average, but they aren't, they can't
be, _universally_ treacherous in every possible circumstance.

&gt; &gt;&gt; As we all know, as the years passed Tolkien began to worry about the fact

&gt; &gt;&gt; his Catholic faith. .....

&gt; &gt;You know, there's a part of the Fate and Free Will thread that might bear
&gt; &gt;on this (for us; I don't think it occurred to JRRT).  Remember where
&gt; &gt;Aquinas in the Summa concludes that men are incapable of even the least
&gt; &gt;good act but for Divine grace?  St Tom then goes on of course to argue
&gt; &gt;that therefore some level of grace is available to all, since even pagans
&gt; &gt;and unbelievers plainly do behave virtuously.

&gt; &gt;But what if we explored the other fork of the argument?  Shippey has
&gt; &gt;pointed out that Orcs clearly do have a moral sense- they have a set of
&gt; &gt;values which most would agree are 'good:' but apparently *always* fail to
&gt; &gt;act upon them.

&gt; &gt;Could Orcs therefore be seen as those who are utterly without Divine
&gt; &gt;grace, and therefore incapable of the least good action?

&gt; At some point in the past, I was pointed to a bit of Aquinas on-line
&gt; in which &quot;building a house&quot; was given as an example of &quot;a good deed&quot;.

&gt; Consider the Goblins in the Hobbit: have they not created, if not a
&gt; house, then at least a home? They have a society, a warm fire, a food
&gt; supply and, for all we know, women and children. (Actually, we /do/
&gt; know they have children hanging around -- we are told that Gollum ate
&gt; them when he could catch them -- and so they must have had women there
&gt; as well). Would these not be &quot;good things&quot; requiring some measure of
&gt; grace?
">

At the very least, it's proof that the Orcs are not _wholly_ ruined.
This _is_ consistant with Christian theology, a purely, 100% evil
being would be self-negating.  The fact that Orcs can (and we see them
do so in canonical sources) function socially is proof that they
aren't 100% evil.  Very close, by the standards of Elves and Men in
general, but still not utterly and purely bad.

Which means that in theory, there is hope for them.  It might be
beyond any effort of Elf or Man to reach them...but what God has in
mind no one can say.

Apart from the usual outliers, some form of original sin is universal in

And this is clear from /Letters/ as well. There are several letters Tolkien
wrote where he compares the good and bad nature of humans (in the real
world) to Elves and men in his invented world. He explicitly stated that
Elves represented the good side of human nature, while Orcs represented the
bad side.

He even has an exchange of letters with his son where the lower-class airmen
Christopher Tolkien is training with in South Africa are compared to orcs,
IIRC. He was still writing the story then. I wonder how much that influenced
the way the orcs were depicted in the later stages of the story?

No, I don't.  We're not talking about evil in the sense of falling

Original Sin of some sort is nearly a universal Christian belief,
though there are disagreements on exactly what it _means_ and implies,
and what it's nature is.  For that matter, almost every faith has some
word for a recognition that the world, and the human race, is broken.

But to say that everyone is born tainted (in whatever way) by the
original sin is not the same thing as saying that everyone is born
evil in the malicious sense.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Actually, whether the Orcs derived from Men is unclear: if Orcs
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; appeared before Men appeared, then that seems unlikely, although
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Orc-Man matings might have been treated as Orcs.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If Orcs are perverted Elves, then their fear are Elven fear and, after
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the death of the body, they go to Mandos (Elvish section) were they
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are, indeed, subject to purgation, much as Feanor, but perhaps longer.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If Orcs are perverted Men, then they should share the fate of Men,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; whatever that may be. If there is a purgatory for Men, it is beyond
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the Wall of Night, and so the Orcs would go there as well.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If Orcs are perverted mixes of Elf and Man, then they should be
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; treated as Elves. It might be thought they had a choice, but Elwing
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; had no choice, her brothers had no choice, Dior Thingol's Heir had no
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; choice: choice of Elf or Man appears to be limited to Elros, Elrond,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and Elrond's children.

&gt; Elwing had a choice:
&gt; &quot;...to Earendil and to Elwing, and to their sons, shall be given leave
&gt; each to choose freely to which kindred their fates shall be joined...&quot;
&gt; and:
&gt; &quot;Then Earendil said to Elwing: 'Choose thou, for now I am weary of the

Elwing's brothers, and Dior, presumably _would_ have had a choice, had
they survived, as well.  They were slain (presumably slain in the case
of Dior's sons) before Manwe made his ruling on the matter.

It's the old argument about whether Dior was mortal or not.  Unless
JRRT said something on the matter that I'm not familiar with, we can't
answer that with any surety, we don't have enough data.  Had he not
been slain (I'm tempted to say murdered) by the sons of Feanor, it
might have been a long time before anything was clear on the matter,
because with a Maia grandmother and Elven blood on his maternal
grandfather's side, he might well have been possessed of a very, very
long 'natural' span even if he was a Man.

Actually, it comes to the same thing, at least in my understanding of
Aquinas.

Aquinas agrees with Aristotle that &quot;man always chooses the good&quot;.
Well, provided the particular individual is sane, of course; the
insane may make other choices; but discussions of man in general
generally deal only with sane people. The problem is that what man
actually chooses is what he /perceives/ as good -- and his perception
is corrupted by original sin. Man thus believes that he is choosing
the good but, without grace, is in fact always choosing evil. The
/effect/ of original sin is that man, without grace, always chooses
evil even though he believes that he is choosing good. It is in this
sense that man can be said to be born evil. It should be kept in mind
that &quot;evil&quot; is defined as &quot;absence of good&quot;; &quot;evil&quot; has no positive
definition.

Attempts to assert otherwise are invariably refuted by Aquinas, who
identifies them with one or another of the historically-identified
heresies condemned by the various councils (which he cites).

For example, Aquinas speaks of man, in his natural state, that is,
before the Fall, as having complete control over his body and as
having lost this in the Fall. But this is not to be interpreted as
meaning that the body is corrupt and the soul is still pure; that is
heresy, particularly when the conclusion is drawn that the soul is
being punished by being placed in the body. Rather, the situation is
that the soul is corrupt and, as a result, no longer controls the
body. (Another way of putting this, not necessarily Thomistic or even
RC, is that, just as the soul is in rebellion against God, so is the
body in rebellion against the soul).

In the same way, then, the soul is corrupted by original sin and can
no longer perceive the good -- and so the will can no longer choose
the good, but only what the mind believes to be good, which is, in
fact, evil. To assert that the unaided man can perceive good (and so
actually choose good) is also heresy; when fully developed, it becomes
Pelagianism.

Aquinas can be a bit confusing on this point because he often uses the
phrases such as &quot;man's nature as such&quot; (there are others) to refer to
the nature and status of man before the Fall. He usually continues on
to discuss the nature of man as it is today, which is after the Fall.
He can be quoted saying all sorts of things about man pre-Fall that
seem to contradict or ameliorate this position, but, in fact, none of
them apply to man as he is today.

Christians do not believe and never have believed that people are born
good and become evil by their own choice; this belief belongs to a
different philosophy. Christians do believe that people are born
sinful and therefore, left to their own devices, do evil as a result
of their own choices -- which has the same effect as saying that they
are born evil, when evil is defined as the absence of good. Some
Christians, as noted elsewhere, extend this viewpoint to total
depravity; however, as Niebuhr observes somewhere in /The Nature and
Destiny of Man/, no doubt phrased better, if man were totally
depraved, he would not be able to realize that he were depraved, and
he clearly is able to realize that he is depraved, so he cannot be
totally depraved.

&gt;be cured.&quot;
&gt;     -- Summa Theologica, I-II. Q109. A2.
">

And this is from earlier in the same passage:
&quot;Man's nature may be looked at in two ways: first, in its integrity,
as it was in our first parent before sin; secondly, as it is corrupted
in us after the sin of our first parent. Now in both states human
nature needs the help of God as First Mover, to do or wish any good
whatsoever, as stated above (1).&quot;

This illustrates the difficulty I have reading Aquinas: my background
is Lutheran, and so I must constantly struggle to understand what
Aquinas is saying, not what I think he is saying.

It also illustrates the way Aquinas' work builds on itself: God as
First Mover is part of the first Treatise (I A2): it is one of the
proofs of God's existence. I have noted in the past that the proof
does not seem to me to work because, even granting that it proves a
First Mover exists, it merely asserts that the First Mover is God:

&quot;Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover, put in motion
by no other; and this everyone understands to be God.&quot;

Even if literally true when made, this simply is not the case today.

Yet here the other shoe drops, and God's status as First Mover is
cited to show that -- well, what does it show? Another use of God as
First Mover is (II-II A1):

&quot;Now every use implies movement, taking movement broadly, so as to
call thinking and willing movements, as is clear from the Philosopher
(De Anima iii, 4). Now in corporeal things we see that for movement
there is required not merely the form which is the principle of the
movement or action, but there is also required the motion of the first
mover. Now the first mover in the order of corporeal things is the
heavenly body. Hence no matter how perfectly fire has heat, it would
not bring about alteration, except by the motion of the heavenly body.
But it is clear that as all corporeal movements are reduced to the
motion of the heavenly body as to the first corporeal mover, so all
movements, both corporeal and spiritual, are reduced to the simple
First Mover, Who is God. And hence no matter how perfect a corporeal
or spiritual nature is supposed to be, it cannot proceed to its act
unless it be moved by God; but this motion is according to the plan of
His providence, and not by necessity of nature, as the motion of the
heavenly body.&quot;

I included the full context so that this part could be more easily
understood: &quot;all movements, both corporeal and spiritual, are reduced
to the simple First Mover, Who is God&quot;.

So, in Aquinas, man does /nothing whatsoever/ without the aid of God.

This is why I agreed, earlier in the thread, with the proposition that
God's grace must be presumed to be well-nigh universal, to some
extent, since nothing good can be done without it. Indeed, this
suggests that /nothing whatsoever/ can be done without, if not grace,
the aid of God. This assistance must underlie the ability to do the
&quot;particular good&quot; -- and so even the &quot;particular good&quot; cannot be done
by man acting alone, because man cannot act alone.

At least, it seems to me that that is what Aquinas is saying.

To move somewhat back on point: although JRRT clearly did have
problems with the idea of Eru providing Orcs with fear (souls), my
contention is that he should not have had any such problem, since, as
an RC, he should have known that God provided souls to men and women,
even to men who God must know would grow up to be monsters. I can now
expand this: JRRT should have realized that, to be consistent with the
rules of his own mythology, it was not possible for the Orcs to be
totally depraved and so irredeemable because they also, and, indeed
Morgoth himself, was unable to act without some aid from Eru. I think
he subjected himself to unnecessary doubts and worries by somehow
erring on this point.

This does presume that JRRT's understanding of RC was similar to that
of Aquinas. But whatever it was, the assertion (copied from above)
that

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem is that Lenin and Stalin were not _born_ evil.  It's a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; given that they _could_ have been different, they could have made

">

is almost certainly /not/ something JRRT would have agreed with. And
Christians both historically and today would not and do not agree with
it either. This is the statement that would be acceptable: Hitler and
Stalin [restoring my original choices] were born evil [in the sense
defined above, that is, unable because of original sin to choose good]
and failed [to use my understanding of Aquinas rather than my Lutheran
upbringing] to cooperate with God's grace and so failed to do good.

And, since I mentioned it, I think Aquinas use of &quot;cooperate&quot; is
closer to todays concept of &quot;collaborate&quot;: it is far more active than
&quot;cooperate&quot; often is today. I should also mention that it is /always/
God's grace that is central; cooperation cannot be taken as meaning
&quot;man could do it by himself&quot;.

&gt; to the simple First Mover, Who is God&quot;.

&gt; So, in Aquinas, man does /nothing whatsoever/ without the aid of God.

&gt; This is why I agreed, earlier in the thread, with the proposition that
&gt; God's grace must be presumed to be well-nigh universal, to some
&gt; extent, since nothing good can be done without it. Indeed, this
&gt; suggests that /nothing whatsoever/ can be done without, if not grace,
&gt; the aid of God. This assistance must underlie the ability to do the
&gt; &quot;particular good&quot; -- and so even the &quot;particular good&quot; cannot be done
&gt; by man acting alone, because man cannot act alone.

&gt; At least, it seems to me that that is what Aquinas is saying.

&gt; To move somewhat back on point: although JRRT clearly did have
&gt; problems with the idea of Eru providing Orcs with fear (souls), my
&gt; contention is that he should not have had any such problem, since, as
&gt; an RC, he should have known that God provided souls to men and women,
&gt; even to men who God must know would grow up to be monsters. I can now
&gt; expand this: JRRT should have realized that, to be consistent with the
&gt; rules of his own mythology, it was not possible for the Orcs to be
&gt; totally depraved and so irredeemable because they also, and, indeed
&gt; Morgoth himself, was unable to act without some aid from Eru. I think
&gt; he subjected himself to unnecessary doubts and worries by somehow
&gt; erring on this point.

&gt; This does presume that JRRT's understanding of RC was similar to that
&gt; of Aquinas. But whatever it was, the assertion (copied from above)
&gt; that&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem is that Lenin and Stalin were not _born_ evil.  It's a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; given that they _could_ have been different, they could have made
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different choices, followed other paths.

&gt; is almost certainly /not/ something JRRT would have agreed with.

The 'heart and soul'[#] of Tolkien's world is more likely to be the
relation of language and stories (myth) -- and of land.

The 'heart and soul' of LotR is rather the idea that Evil can only be
overcome by the Grace of God. Of course grace doesn't remove your
Free Will and you must choose to accept it, but ultimately the book
is more concerned with trusting God (largely there seems to be an
underlying Boethian idea that all people desire good and would choose
good if they could always identify it, but that this desire may
become perverted and the choice confused by evil).

Free Will in Tolkien's writings doesn't seem to require the ability
to do otherwise (except through changing the past), regardless of
whether Men specifically had that power. Choosing freely between Good
and Evil doesn't mean that that the person has the power to do
otherwise -- at most it involves the power to freely choose your
internal attitude towards what you must do.

[#] I instinctively distrust such expressions as 'the heart and soul'
or 'it is all about' or 'the meaning is' -- such are, IMO, a
mistaken in their underlying assumption of a conscious message.
The stories deal with many themes, one of which is Free Will
(which does, I agree, involves a choice between good and not-
good), but there are many other themes, some of which are more
prominent (and more important to the author) than the Free Will
issue.

I'd say it does. It does require you to seize the opportunity, if
given.  Leaning back and waiting for the Grace of God to turn
everything to a good end doesn't work out. So, yes, the *individual*
choice is important.  You can *trust* God that you won't be put into
situations where your lack of information to make those choices can
lead into disaster, but you must make the choices, as well as you are
able to, nevertheless. And if you intentionally, individually choose
the &quot;evil&quot; path, then maybe God's plan won't work out. Or will only
work out later, very differently.

Satan was not evil in the beginning, either. And you can only choose
freely if you can perceive Good and Evil clearly. And the ancestors of
Man made their choice when they abandoned Eru for Morgoth before
heading West (this is in one of the later volumes of HOME). Aragorn
inherits the consequences of that decision, which was made by his
ancestors. He is /not/ free to choose between listening to Eru and
listening to Morgoth; that choice has been made, and, if Morgoth is
now silent, well, so is Eru.

Trying to see JRRT as some sort of modernist-humanist is simply wrong.
JRRT was RC, and he explicitly stated that his identity as RC pervaded
and shaped his writings.

No. Both the Quendi and the Ainur are Free-Willed, but both are also
bound by the Music as fate. They do no appear to have the ability to
do otherwise. Therefore Free Will, in Tolkien's writings, does not
require that ability (that is independent of what we might think of

Will that is compatible with determinism and requires rather the
ability to act in a manner that is in accordance with one's true
self.

Men, however, do appear to have the ability to do otherwise (their
freedom from the Music), but this, as noted above, is not directly
related to their possession of Free Will.

To the extent that he understood it, I'm sure it was. (A confusing

Debating free will is always messy, and Original Sin makes it messier.

I disagree.

Traditional Catholic doctrine holds that, had we complete knowledge
and understanding of the natural laws to whose working God has made
the universe subject, we would be able to predict all *physical*
events with certainty.  Yet, because God is by definition the highest
good and cannot therefore will evil, the *consequence* of the exercise
of free will is not willed by God, and therefore cannot be deduced
with reference to the natural laws he ordains for the universe.  The
choice between good and evil which one makes is therefore entirely and
completely one's own choice: God is aware of the choice each
individual will make (being omniscient) and allows it, but it is not,
and cannot be, a manifestation of his will; and the natural laws to
which God has subjected the universe therefore reveal nothing about
the choice an individual will make.

Yet, even if we do not know and cannot know what choice an individual
will make, we can and should know that the ultimate *outcome* will be
good, regardless of how many individuals choose evil.  This is because
of the idea Divine Providence - that God, despite sin and evil,
ultimately directs all things - even evil and sin - towards the
fulfilment of the purposes for which the universe was created.  Part
of &quot;faith&quot; (estel, in Tolkien's world) lies in trusting in Divine
Providence, even when it seems that evil and sin reign.

To my mind, it is this combination of natural determinism, free will
and Providence  - not moral determinism, and not predestination - that
the Music reflects.  The course of physical events is fully determined
by the laws ordained by God's will (the main theme of the Music).  The
sin and evil that infest the world are contrary to his purposes and
intention and do not reflect his will (the discords of Melkor) but are
permitted by him (Eru does not, for example, strike Melkor with a well-
aimed thunderbolt, as he easily could have).  And, ultimately, through
the agency of free will as exercised by the Eruhini (the third theme),
Arda will reach a fulfillment that is greater than what would
otherwise have been (the grand conclusion of the Music and the vision
of Arda Healed), to which even the sin and evil that has gone before
will have contributed (&quot;but it seemed that its most triumphant notes
were taken by the other and woven into its own solemn pattern&quot;).

There is no humanity, there are only humans.  Men were not created

Aragorn's ancestors could not make this choice for him, the very

Only he can make that choice, no one else is empowered to do it.
Aragorn _is_ free to chose between listening to Eru and Melkor.  Even
people who don't know Eru and Melkor exists make moral choices between
Good and Evil.  This theme permeates the LOTR, from Bilbo's free
choice whether or not to kill Smeagol, to Gandalf's insistance on not
using any sort of force to sway Frodo.  Tolkien recoiled from
coercion.  Everyone who fell to Melkor's urgings did so, on some
level, by choice.

Tolkien did _not_ accept your notion that all moral choices are made
by one's ancestors, as his very discomfort over the nature of the Orcs
shows.  It was precisely his refusal to accept the idea of beings
created evil that bothered him about the Orcs.

Nothing about it fits the idea that nobody has any moral freedom.

Then they are not Free Willed.  This is an either-or choice, Free Will
doesn't mean you have limitless power over your own fate, but it does

can not have total control of even the Elves, unless they are _not_
Free Willed, and thus might as well be automatons.  An Elf may have no
way to alter his ultimate fate in this world, but that doesn't mean he
has no influence over how he gets there.

The truth is I suspect Tolkien's original conception of the Music
dates back to the days before he was trying to reconcile Christian
belief and Middle-Earth.  Sooner or later I suspect he'd have been
having some of the same problems with Elvish free will that he did
with Orcish free will.

Nonsense!

There are lots of theories of Free Will that do not require that the
agent be able to 'do otherwise' -- it is one of the characteristics
of the range of models that are called 'compatibilist' (because they
maintain that Free Will is compatible with causal determinism). There
are other views or models for Free Will that do require that the
agent be able to 'do otherwise', but Tolkien does not seem to follow
these with respect to Elves, Dwarves and Ainur.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Which is not the same as being able to do otherwise. I wrote an
article about it a while back that goes into more depth, but Verlyn
Flieger, for instance, suggests that the Elves were able to change
their own attitude towards their actions, but not the action itself
-- i.e. that they were /not/ able to 'do otherwise', but they were
able to think and believe otherwise, and that is sufficient for Free
Will.

I rather doubt that. The Ainulindalë is firmly rooted in RC thought
from the beginning, and is not in essential disagreement anywhere,
including the lack of freedom for the Elves (notice that the gift to
Men set them free of the Music, and thus makes them capable to do
otherwise, so Men could be seen as the only Free-Willed race under
some Free Will theories. The problem with that would of course be
Tolkien's explicit statements that Elves and Ainur had Free Will.

This antagonism between free will and the Music has always bothered
me. Surely it's obvious that the Ainur and the Elves do make choices.
We could argue, I suppose, that they only appear to make choices but
are actually constrained to act as they do, but then free will goes
out the window -- and with it goes responsibility for one's acts.
Somehow I have trouble reconciling that with what we know of
Tolkien's world view.

But I've just now been struck by a possible way out of the dilemma.

Suppose we think of the Music in a similar way to the laws of
physics. We do not see any conflict between free will and the fact
that I cannot choose to levitate.

So what would the music or Fate consist of? How would it govern Ainur
and Elves but not Men?

Is it as simple as this: that the Ainur and the Elves are constrained
by their nature to remain within Arda for all of its days, while Men
are not so constrained? That seems almost too simple, but at least it
preserves free will.

What I'm conjecturing, in other words, is that it was part of the
Music that the Firstborn and the Ainur would stay within Arda for its
whole life, but not Men. And when we say that the Music &quot;is as Fate&quot;
to all except Men, that's what we mean.

What do others think about these tentative thoughts?

That's not what I'm doing.  I should have phrased that differently, I
grant, what I should have said was that Tolkien did not _write_ the
LOTR around the notion that the moral choices of our ancestors are
binding upon us, which statment is simply the truth.  Nothing in it
suggests otherwise, whereas there are extensive examples showing that
the characters do believe that they have important moral choices to
make that were not predetermined.  Perhaps Tolkien considered their
belief wrong, but if so he didn't indicate it in the text.

Likewise, Tolkien's discomfort over the idea of a predestined morality
in the case of the orcs is also a matter of record.  Whatever his
personal beliefs, he was not comfortable with the idea that Orcs,
Elves and men were morally equivalent, and he was also not comfortable
with the idea that Orcs were born evil because their ancestors made
the wrong choice.

Yes. Hence, the Grace of God isn't the *only* important thing in

Maybe it creates less confusion if we actually use a different name
those two forms of Free Will differently. So, say, there's &quot;bound Free
Will&quot; (which applies to Elves) and &quot;unbound Free Will&quot; (which applies
to Man). Now the statement becomes &quot;Because of their unbound Free Will,
for Man, overcoming Evil requires more than just the Grace of God.&quot;

Can we agree on that?

&gt;&gt; No. Both the Quendi and the Ainur are Free-Willed, but both are also
&gt;&gt; bound by the Music as fate. They do no appear to have the ability to
&gt;&gt; do otherwise. Therefore Free Will, in Tolkien's writings, does not
&gt;&gt; require that ability (that is independent of what we might think of
&gt;&gt; the matter of Free Will). Tolkien rather seems to have a view of Free
&gt;&gt; Will that is compatible with determinism and requires rather the
&gt;&gt; ability to act in a manner that is in accordance with one's true
&gt;&gt; self.
&gt; This antagonism between free will and the Music has always bothered
&gt; me. Surely it's obvious that the Ainur and the Elves do make choices.
&gt; We could argue, I suppose, that they only appear to make choices but
&gt; are actually constrained to act as they do, but then free will goes
&gt; out the window -- and with it goes responsibility for one's acts.
&gt; Somehow I have trouble reconciling that with what we know of
&gt; Tolkien's world view.

&gt; But I've just now been struck by a possible way out of the dilemma.

&gt; Suppose we think of the Music in a similar way to the laws of
&gt; physics. We do not see any conflict between free will and the fact
&gt; that I cannot choose to levitate.

&gt; So what would the music or Fate consist of? How would it govern Ainur
&gt; and Elves but not Men?

&gt; Is it as simple as this: that the Ainur and the Elves are constrained
&gt; by their nature to remain within Arda for all of its days, while Men
&gt; are not so constrained? That seems almost too simple, but at least it
&gt; preserves free will.

&gt; What I'm conjecturing, in other words, is that it was part of the
&gt; Music that the Firstborn and the Ainur would stay within Arda for its
&gt; whole life, but not Men. And when we say that the Music &quot;is as Fate&quot;
&gt; to all except Men, that's what we mean.

&gt; What do others think about these tentative thoughts?
">

It's a difficult philosphical question. I think there are several ways
out, but there will always be people who object or think differently.

I have the feeling that restricting the Music just to the fact that
Elves and Ainur have to stay in Arda takes away too much -- the Music
is also a parable for the &quot;plan&quot; that God has, and paradoxically
people will follow this plan, in the sense of &quot;thy will be done&quot;, even
if they retain their Free Will and the moral responsibility.

Personally, I have a different argument that allows me to reconcile
determinism (assuming a universe that is deterministic, or a variation
like the Music which implies some degree of determinism or &quot;fate&quot;),
and moral responsibility: Since the individual itself cannot actually
make use of the determinism and calculate the future, from the
viewpoint of the individual the choice as still made with Free
Will. Hence, the moral responsibility still lies with the
individual. From the outside, this choice will be deterministic, but
because the individual is what he or she is, this choice will reflect
their morality and Free Will. For me, that is enough, but I don't
expect many people will agree, and I won't try to defend this idea :-)
