Phil's Finally In Kobe's Corner -- And It's Bad For Lakers
September 7, 2007 - 6:32 am
Los Angeles Times -
Kobe Bryant has a supporter for his vendetta with Lakers management, and
it comes from an unlikely source, The Los Angeles Times is reporting.

Head coach Phil Jackson made his views clear this week in a series of
interviews that, in subtler tones, were just as indelibly damaging as
Bryant's tagging spree of several months ago.

Like Bryant, Jackson said that a member of the Buss family misled him.

&quot;We were promised by Jim Buss we'd have big changes,&quot; he told Petros
Papadakis and Matt Smith on their KLAC radio show. &quot;We've yet to see
that. We're still looking for that.&quot;

Like Bryant, Jackson intimated that Andrew Bynum might be more valuable
as trade bait.

&quot;There's incredible pressure for that kid to step up and produce this
year,&quot; he told the radio hosts, later adding, &quot;He hasn't had the kind of
success that generates the kind of press he's had.&quot;

Finally, like Bryant, Jackson talked about the need for the Lakers to
repair the relationship torn apart by Bryant.

&quot;I think actions are going to have to speak louder than words...&quot; he
told The Times' Mark Heisler. &quot;It's going to take some mending and other
people in this organization have to be part of it, too.&quot;

he's removing any potential leverage the team might have had in the

Too funny. Phil can call Jim Buss (I don't believe Jim is technically
Phil's boss) whatever he wants and it will be just fine with me. The
front office isn't going to do anything so there's no leverage to be
taken away. The Lakers had a nice guy before Phil came back. Rudy T.
was cool but I'd rather have Phil coaching. Of course neither can
compare with the great Doc Rivers. If there's anything that can
prevent the Celtics from coming out of the east next year, it would be
having Rivers as their coach.

Jackson's always been his own man. I really don't think he's tried to
hide that. Had he held back his antagonism of Krause, it's possible that
the slow-motion chain reaction which led to the dismantling of the Bulls
might have never happened and we'd be talking about 8 or 9 trophies, not
6. Sucks, but people are what they are.

It's in the DNA of the man. You can't take it out and still get Phil
Jackson, no more than you can take some of the prickishness out of Kobe
or Jordan and still have a great player.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Might be true, but what leverage do they have? They don't want to trade
him; he still wants to be traded. No difference there.

The only thing Phil's comments reflect is a PR hit. And frankly, it's a
little late to worry about that now -- particularly when the owner's
son, having just critized the head coach, was criticized in turn by the
owner's daughter back in May.

It might be past this now to &quot;annoying,&quot; but every now and then I
realize how f'ing surreal this whole thing is.

Yep, he can. And I don't think he's been whining about how bad he has
it. I believe in this very story he says he has an attractive offer on
the table -- presumably an extension -- and he's heading into his lame
duck year. Hell, Sam Mitchell fielded questions his entire lame duck
year.

Wow. That's a pretty startling lack of perspective, IMO. There are guys
in this league who have raped women, beaten up their wives, sired a half
dozen out of wedlock kids. Phil has, on the contrary, honored every pro
contract he's had (not sure about the CBA contract). Larry Brown was in
the *NBA FINALS* and probing for another job. I mean, how a man conducts
his business really doesn't bother me much, but in the ranks of scumbag
activity, you don't have to look far. Hell, Don Nelson's threatening to
retire 12 months after he signed a contract because he wants it
re-negotiated. 12 months!

given what he did for the team, i can't say as i blame him.

it's not just this with jackson. it's the whole snobbish &quot;zen&quot; thing.
it's the constant complaining about referees and the refusal to give
credit to the other team for anything. it's the morphing rick adelman
into hitler. he's a grade-a jerk.

&gt; &gt; &gt; He's just telling it like it is. Not sure what's wrong with those
&gt; &gt; &gt; comments.

&gt; &gt; let's see...

&gt; &gt; he's backstabbing he's boss publicly.

&gt; &gt; he's removing any potential leverage the team might have had in the
&gt; &gt; wake of kobe's comments.

&gt; &gt; if he didn't want the job, he didn't need to take it - nobody held a
&gt; &gt; gun to his head. he can quit any time. instead, he chose to complain
&gt; &gt; publicly about the circumstances under which he's earning his cushy
&gt; &gt; paycheck.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll take Phil's lack of class and those 9 championship
&gt; &gt; &gt; rings over any other coach out there.

&gt; &gt; he's a lousy human being, and a great coach ain't going to win a
&gt; &gt; championship with this team. might as well have a nice guy around at
&gt; &gt; 30% of the price rather than this creep.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; Too funny. Phil can call Jim Buss (I don't believe Jim is technically
&gt; Phil's boss) whatever he wants and it will be just fine with me. The
&gt; front office isn't going to do anything so there's no leverage to be
&gt; taken away. The Lakers had a nice guy before Phil came back. Rudy T.
&gt; was cool but I'd rather have Phil coaching.

&gt;&gt; Phil's Finally In Kobe's Corner -- And It's Bad For Lakers
&gt;&gt; September 7, 2007 - 6:32 am
&gt;&gt; Los Angeles Times -
&gt;&gt; Kobe Bryant has a supporter for his vendetta with Lakers management, and
&gt;&gt; it comes from an unlikely source, The Los Angeles Times is reporting.

&gt;&gt; Head coach Phil Jackson made his views clear this week in a series of
&gt;&gt; interviews that, in subtler tones, were just as indelibly damaging as
&gt;&gt; Bryant's tagging spree of several months ago.

&gt;&gt; Like Bryant, Jackson said that a member of the Buss family misled him.

&gt;&gt; &quot;We were promised by Jim Buss we'd have big changes,&quot; he told Petros
&gt;&gt; Papadakis and Matt Smith on their KLAC radio show. &quot;We've yet to see
&gt;&gt; that. We're still looking for that.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Like Bryant, Jackson intimated that Andrew Bynum might be more valuable
&gt;&gt; as trade bait.

&gt;&gt; &quot;There's incredible pressure for that kid to step up and produce this
&gt;&gt; year,&quot; he told the radio hosts, later adding, &quot;He hasn't had the kind of
&gt;&gt; success that generates the kind of press he's had.&quot;

&gt; way to build up the kid's confidence, phil. good job making him want
&gt; to play hard for you.

&gt;&gt; Finally, like Bryant, Jackson talked about the need for the Lakers to
&gt;&gt; repair the relationship torn apart by Bryant.

&gt;&gt; &quot;I think actions are going to have to speak louder than words...&quot; he

He used Adelman as hitler and JWill as a skinhead in a cut in movie and the
implied racism to 'inspire' his team. How low was that?

http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/05/29/jackson/print.html

Jackson's use of movie clips isn't always touchy-feely, as was the case last
year when he used scenes from &quot;American History X&quot; to prepare his Lakers for
a playoff series against the Sacramento Kings. Primarily, he used the film
and its underlying message of the brotherhood of man to unite his feuding
stars, Kobe and Shaq. But he also took things in an altogether different
direction by cutting back and forth between the film's Edward Norton
character, who has a bald head and a tattoo of a swastika, and Sacramento's
white, shaved-headed and tattooed point guard, Jason Williams. Then,
according to the Washington Post, Jackson made comparisons between
Sacramento coach Rick Adelman -- who has a mustache and distinctly German
features -- and Adolf Hitler.

Indeed, for all the talk of Native American spirituality and Zen, Jackson
often displays devilish cruelty. Cruelty is the yin to his New Age yang.
Often it comes at the very moment of kindness, as was the case the day
before a 1994 playoff game in New York. Jordan had taken his famous baseball
sabbatical and Jackson sensed that his team was showing signs of buckling
without him. To remedy the situation Jackson redirected the team bus as it
made its way to the practice gym at the southern tip of Manhattan. Rather
than practice that day, the team would take a ride on the Staten Island
Ferry. However, before it got to its destination, Jackson had the bus stop
and he ordered a longtime publicity assistant -- and the only female riding
with the team -- off of the bus. According to Roland Lazenby, author of the
Jackson biography &quot;Mindgames,&quot; &quot;the woman was devastated by the move and has
never forgiven Jackson for an unexplained and seemingly unnecessary
humiliation.&quot;

Such is Jackson's way. He demonizes those on the outside to tighten the
inner circle. Coldly and without affect, he alienates the extraneous, and
for much of this year the strategy seemed as if it might backfire. From the
moment he arrived in L.A., Jackson had fostered a special bond with O'Neal.
Often this connection came at the expense of the coach's ties to the
younger -- and more independent -- star, Bryant. When the New York Times
reported that Shaq was giving his teammates secret hand signals to not give
Kobe the ball, the struggle between the team's two stars seemed set to
consume the group.

Jackson tried to rectify the situation, telling him to turn down his
individual game, to which Kobe replied, &quot;I haven't even turned it up yet.&quot;
Jackson even tried giving Kobe a book, &quot;Corelli's Mandolin.&quot; When Kobe
wasn't impressed by the story of a soldier who must sacrifice individual
accomplishments for the good of his comrades, the coach's mean streak
returned. He ripped Kobe in the media, accusing him of deliberately making
his high school basketball games close so that he could provide last-minute
heroics.

&gt; &gt;&gt; truth is that Phil is the MASTER in this area.  Don't hate a man for
&gt; &gt;&gt; excellence.

&gt; &gt; being a master drug dealer doesn't make the profession admirable.

&gt; Phil is a head coach.  Your analogy doesn't quite fit.

we were talking about manipulating the refs, remember? you can be

&gt; Jackson's use of movie clips isn't always touchy-feely, as was the case last
&gt; year when he used scenes from &quot;American History X&quot; to prepare his Lakers for
&gt; a playoff series against the Sacramento Kings. Primarily, he used the film
&gt; and its underlying message of the brotherhood of man to unite his feuding
&gt; stars, Kobe and Shaq. But he also took things in an altogether different
&gt; direction by cutting back and forth between the film's Edward Norton
&gt; character, who has a bald head and a tattoo of a swastika, and Sacramento's
&gt; white, shaved-headed and tattooed point guard, Jason Williams. Then,
&gt; according to the Washington Post, Jackson made comparisons between
&gt; Sacramento coach Rick Adelman -- who has a mustache and distinctly German
&gt; features -- and Adolf Hitler.
">

One of the major reasons Horace Grant wouldn't even seriously consider
offers from the Bulls has to do with Jackson's creative use of video. He
took a clip of Grant turning the ball over or something like that and
had it cut to the Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz singing &quot;If I Only Had
a Brain.&quot; It was supposedly the start of years of humiliation in the
locker room.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Such is Jackson's way. He demonizes those on the outside to tighten the
&gt; inner circle. Coldly and without affect, he alienates the extraneous, and
&gt; for much of this year the strategy seemed as if it might backfire. From the
&gt; moment he arrived in L.A., Jackson had fostered a special bond with O'Neal.
&gt; Often this connection came at the expense of the coach's ties to the
&gt; younger -- and more independent -- star, Bryant. When the New York Times
&gt; reported that Shaq was giving his teammates secret hand signals to not give
&gt; Kobe the ball, the struggle between the team's two stars seemed set to
&gt; consume the group.

&gt; Jackson tried to rectify the situation, telling him to turn down his
&gt; individual game, to which Kobe replied, &quot;I haven't even turned it up yet.&quot;
&gt; Jackson even tried giving Kobe a book, &quot;Corelli's Mandolin.&quot; When Kobe
&gt; wasn't impressed by the story of a soldier who must sacrifice individual
&gt; accomplishments for the good of his comrades, the coach's mean streak
&gt; returned. He ripped Kobe in the media, accusing him of deliberately making
&gt; his high school basketball games close so that he could provide last-minute
&gt; heroics.
">

This is possibly true, but Jackson was also the only coach to ever give
direct orders to Jordan and live to tell about it. The Triangle was
installed over Jordan's very vocal objections, and I'm sure people have
heard the story of the 4th quarter of Game 5 vs. the Lakers.

not nearly as much as with jackson. plus, brown doesn't try to *act*

But can't you see the brilliance of this move? He's in the final year of his
contract. He's wealthy beyond belief. He has nothing to lose except this
upcoming season. He's basically falling on a sword for his best player here.
Now Kobe knows he has his head coach watching his back. It's just like
Chicago all over again. The best player and coach versus the bone headed
team management/ownership. With training camp sarting next month, Phil is
trying to diffuse the negative publicity from Kobe by making himself out to
be the bad guy. I have more respect for him now, than ever. In the meantime,
he's still sleeping with Jeanne Buss. CLASSIC!!!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Phil's Finally In Kobe's Corner -- And It's Bad For Lakers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; September 7, 2007 - 6:32 am
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Los Angeles Times -
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kobe Bryant has a supporter for his vendetta with Lakers management, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it comes from an unlikely source, The Los Angeles Times is reporting.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Head coach Phil Jackson made his views clear this week in a series of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interviews that, in subtler tones, were just as indelibly damaging as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bryant's tagging spree of several months ago.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Like Bryant, Jackson said that a member of the Buss family misled him.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We were promised by Jim Buss we'd have big changes,&quot; he told Petros
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Papadakis and Matt Smith on their KLAC radio show. &quot;We've yet to see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that. We're still looking for that.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Like Bryant, Jackson intimated that Andrew Bynum might be more valuable
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as trade bait.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;There's incredible pressure for that kid to step up and produce this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year,&quot; he told the radio hosts, later adding, &quot;He hasn't had the kind of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; success that generates the kind of press he's had.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way to build up the kid's confidence, phil. good job making him want
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to play hard for you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, like Bryant, Jackson talked about the need for the Lakers to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; repair the relationship torn apart by Bryant.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I think actions are going to have to speak louder than words...&quot; he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told The Times' Mark Heisler. &quot;It's going to take some mending and other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people in this organization have to be part of it, too.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i've said it before - phil jackson is the most classless coach/exec
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out there, and has been for a long time.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He's just telling it like it is. Not sure what's wrong with those
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comments.

&gt; &gt; &gt; let's see...

&gt; &gt; &gt; he's backstabbing he's boss publicly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; he's removing any potential leverage the team might have had in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; wake of kobe's comments.

&gt; &gt; &gt; if he didn't want the job, he didn't need to take it - nobody held a
&gt; &gt; &gt; gun to his head. he can quit any time. instead, he chose to complain
&gt; &gt; &gt; publicly about the circumstances under which he's earning his cushy
&gt; &gt; &gt; paycheck.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll take Phil's lack of class and those 9 championship
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rings over any other coach out there.

&gt; &gt; &gt; he's a lousy human being, and a great coach ain't going to win a
&gt; &gt; &gt; championship with this team. might as well have a nice guy around at
&gt; &gt; &gt; 30% of the price rather than this creep.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; Too funny. Phil can call Jim Buss (I don't believe Jim is technically
&gt; &gt; Phil's boss) whatever he wants and it will be just fine with me. The
&gt; &gt; front office isn't going to do anything so there's no leverage to be
&gt; &gt; taken away. The Lakers had a nice guy before Phil came back. Rudy T.
&gt; &gt; was cool but I'd rather have Phil coaching.

&gt; what does phil bring that rudy t. doesn't at this point?

&gt; &gt;Of course neither can
&gt; &gt; compare with the great Doc Rivers. If there's anything that can
&gt; &gt; prevent the Celtics from coming out of the east next year, it would be
&gt; &gt; having Rivers as their coach.

&gt; tom thibodeau is waiting in the wings if the celtics play any less
&gt; than .650 ball over the first three weeks of the season.- Hide quoted text -

At least Phil will stick around for the entire season, unlike Rudy T.
The Celtics will make the playoffs, but I just have a feeling that Doc
will screw things up when the Celtics get there.

That may be true, but are you going to say that your Celticsaphilia
doesn't play an equal role here?

I saw quite a few coaches come through. Doug Collins, for instance, was
one of the best X's and O's men that I've ever seen. A quote that's been
circulating about him for years is that if he was given the chance to
call a timeout before every play, his team would win every game. That's
probably true. But he was also a rotten motivator, really poor at
massaging egos, and let his superstars walk all over him at every
opportunity while stinging lesser or younger players in their stead.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; jackson's griping is constant, about his contract, about refs, about
&gt; &gt; &gt; his own players.

&gt; &gt; When did he gripe about his contract? I believe his refrain since April
&gt; &gt; has been &quot;They're paying me too much money to expect 1st round exits.&quot;

&gt; fine. i shouldn't have mentioned contracts. i notice you aren't
&gt; arguing with the other stuff, so i have to assume you realize it's
&gt; true.
">

I don't see griping about refs and his own players as a cardinal sin.
When Larry Brown takes Stephon Marbury out to the woodshed, it's a good
thing, or when Scott Skiles says Eddy Curry could be a better rebounder
if he &quot;jumped&quot; -- hey, they're laying it on the line. What refreshing
honesty! It's the same thing to me.

And as far as morphing Adelman into Hitler -- consistency would say that
you despise him for his endless whining about refs as well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; i do loathe the man - because he's classless and people hold him up as
&gt; &gt; &gt; some kind of paragon. nobody does that with lucas or thomas.

&gt; &gt; Fine then: people do it with Larry Brown.

&gt; not nearly as much as with jackson. plus, brown doesn't try to *act*
&gt; like he's a paragon. jackson uses the whole zen thing quite a bit
&gt; until he starts morphing adelman into hitler - a very un-zenlike thing
&gt; to do and very low. he's as hypocritical about his beliefs - which he
&gt; wears more on his sleeve than any other coach or exec - as many of the
&gt; politicians he likely despises.
">

Oh come now -- Brown denied he was negotiating for another job though he
obviously was -- when his team was in the Eastern Conference Finals! If
your problem is Jackson's raging hypocrisy, that's cool -- he cultivates
a persona as someone aloof, more a spectator than a participant. But his
sins -- professional or personal -- don't nearly come close to something
like that.

If this were any other business, Brown could and would likely be sued
for something like that. Instead, he was given a fat buyout when he
claimed his health problems would likely cause him to miss a lot of
games if the Pistons didn't pay him off.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; It's crazy that people can't

Kobe's comments removed the leverage in and of themselves.  You can argue

&gt; &gt; Phil has, on the contrary, honored every pro

&gt; &gt; the *NBA FINALS* and probing for another job. I mean, how a man conducts
&gt; &gt; his business really doesn't bother me much, but in the ranks of scumbag
&gt; &gt; activity, you don't have to look far. Hell, Don Nelson's threatening to
&gt; &gt; retire 12 months after he signed a contract because he wants it
&gt; &gt; re-negotiated. 12 months!

&gt; given what he did for the team, i can't say as i blame him.

But Jackson's done about 100 times for the Lakers what Nelson has for the
Warriors, you're talking out of both sides of your mouth here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; it's not just this with jackson. it's the whole snobbish &quot;zen&quot; thing.

Say wha?  Phil complains less about refs than any coach in the league,
maybe less than any coach I've ever seen - he just sits there, only getting
in any verbal shots at tiemouts usually.

It's clear that your dislike isn't really based on anything tangible,
except his winning, which is what PhilHate usually comes down to.
Otherwise you wouldn't be making stuff up and throwing out double standards

This exists only in your imagination.  Not only does Phil not try to act
like a wonderful guy, he puts on no act at all.  I've never seen any
evidence that he gives one whit about what anybody else thinks about him or
what his image is.  He just does his thing and lets people think what they

Apples and oranges - Phil has never been a cheater.  Sure, Red complained
more about refs than any coach in history, ran down opponents more than any
coach in history, etc etc, but it was his dishonesty and cheating that
makes him the archetype for lack of class in sport.

Perhaps the ends do justify the means, but to criticize Phil you've first
got to acknowledge that every single complaint you can come up with will
apply even moreso to Auerbach.

It's a completely arbitrary distinction. You're talking about 30 to 100
people. You've already precluded criminal malfeasance, so now we're back
on &quot;Who's a bigger jerk?&quot;

How so? Coaches all politic for calls...Jackson's style is annoying but
often effective.  That has nothing to do with the line he crossed with using
Hitler and JWill as the skinhead to use racism to motivate his team.
I am rather curious why a championship team needed such a thing to win a 2nd
round playoff series to start with. Plus degrading the opponents fans and
city publically. Now that was more class sportsmanship...

I think his original point stands, might as well pay a third the price
because all jackson has proved he can do with a lottery team is get them to
the playoffs with one superstar to carry them. Terry Porter could likely do
that at 20% the pay.  But it is Jackson's choice, he does not retire and
they might as well have him work for it.

&gt; Say wha?  Phil complains less about refs than any coach in the league,

So address the original point. What can Jackson do with this team that a
mediocre NBA nice guy can not at a small percentage of the pricetag? Keep
them out of the lottery for a third year?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Looks like you could use a little &quot;zen&quot; in your life.
&gt;&gt;&gt; next time you lump all &quot;liberals&quot; in the same negative category, i'll
&gt;&gt;&gt; remind you of this.
&gt;&gt; By definition, I myself am I liberal.  I have no idea what you're
&gt;&gt; talking about.

&gt; lol. no you aren't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's the constant complaining about referees and the refusal to give
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; credit to the other team for anything.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, you mean he works the refs?  Gee, what coach doesn't do that?  The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; truth is that Phil is the MASTER in this area.  Don't hate a man for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; excellence.
&gt;&gt;&gt; being a master drug dealer doesn't make the profession admirable.
&gt;&gt; Phil is a head coach.  Your analogy doesn't quite fit.

&gt; we were talking about manipulating the refs, remember? you can be
&gt; great at it, but it doesn't make it right.\

&gt;&gt; Are you against
&gt;&gt; the head coaching profession in general?  No.  You just have some
&gt;&gt; personal issue with Phil Jackson because your cultural background tells
&gt;&gt; you that he is some kind of snob or asshole.

&gt; phil can have whatever belief set he wants, and i'll respect if *if he
&gt; lives by it*. the hitler example laurel highlighted is just one of
&gt; many ways in which he shows he is *not* living by it. so he's a
&gt; flaming hypocrite to boot.
