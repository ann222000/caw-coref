Hi,

My blog is all about VBA programming and I am trying to post a program
source code with some portion of it should be indented. How can I do
it? I tried to use TAB key and SPACE but with no success.

Please help..

Many thanks,

I have seen this question several times, with no good answers.  Here's
another answer that works but is kind of a PITA.  For a constant
indent (certain length), I use HTML to change the font color to the
same color as my blogpage background (black in my case) and type some
filler text (e.g. &quot;=====&quot;) then reset the font color.
EXAMPLE:
&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;=====&lt;/font&gt;My Indented Text

Crude, but all I've discovered so far.  I'm using it to space out
poetry.

If you find a better way, please post it!

Depending upon which template you're using, you may like the look of
&quot;&lt;blockquote&gt; ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;&quot;, or &quot;&lt;pre&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;&quot;.  Just
remember to substitute for &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;.
