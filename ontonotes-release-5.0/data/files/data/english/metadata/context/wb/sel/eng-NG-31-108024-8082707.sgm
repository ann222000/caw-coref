I am wondering what resources-books/websites-you'd recommend for a
beginner. Something that educates me both about &quot;how&quot; to make
sourdough, and also &quot;why&quot; I am making it like I am--both chemically,
and historically.

Also, I am confused about soured dough and yeast. Was soured dough
originally a replacement for yeast, or were both used? Because in my
recipe books I am surprised to see that the recipes call for both
soured dough and yeast. Is this always the case?

Thank you.

Not good to do that.  Toss out the recipe books.

Sourdough predates bakers' yeast by millenia.

Here is a good place to start learning about sourdough:
http://www.nyx.net/~dgreenw/sourdoughfaqs.html
Not that it will do any good.

As far as chemistry is concerned, there is an r.f.s. poster
who discusses that from time to time, but nobody can guess

Sure you do.  Betcha she makes bread with bakers' yeast, even
so-called &quot;sourdough&quot;, that is, if she makes bread at all, 'cause
she is probably buying at the supermarket.  And so will you --
the irrational influence of moms cannot be underestimated.

Yeah, but can you do chemistry?  Can you fluff up old sourdough
for pancakes with sodium bicarbonate, and explain why that works?
Can you deal equally well with Celsius and Fahrenheit.  Can you
calibrate your oven thermostat?  Can you determine how much flour
an 8-fluid-ounce measuring cup holds.  Here is a good test for the
physicist in you: how many grams of water does an 8-fluid-ounce
measuring cup contain?

Just checkin' up!

Here are two web-sites that will get you started. You will find dough
calculators, starter and fermentation information, pictures... Mike's
site &quot;sourdoughhome&quot; has some excellent video on mixing and shaping
techniques. I highly recommend the stretch and fold technique, for
example, in lieu of machine kneading. But that technique is only one
of many nuggets in these two sites. Between them, you should be able
to get 95% of the info you seek. They are better than most of the
books out there.

Sourdough starter and grocery store yeast are both dough leavens.
Sourdough is ancient. The commercial yeast has been popular for less
than a hundred years. Many bakeries make breads using both.

In my opinion, sourdough starter produces the best flavor...  but
that's not because sourdough is inherently better as a leavener. And
it is also not true that the bread will be sour. The fermentation is
slower though and as in cheese making, or wine making, slower
production processes tend to develop more complex flavors.

There is a book called &quot;The Bread Builders&quot; that has an excellent
discussion on the chemistry of fermentation. You can probably find it
at your library (or Google it). It also has information on oven
building... which might not be directly applicable to your interest
but will give good insight on the &quot;tradition&quot; of bread making. Bread
is a curious window, as it were, on technology and culture.

I also was a bit confused about the recipes that called for both
sourdough starter and commercial yeast.  I think it is the other way
around though, the commercial yeast is a convenient replacement for
sourdough starter.

SD starter is not really consistent with rise times.  Mine can take as
little as 45 minutes some days and up to 4 or more hours others.  I
think it depends on how 'lively' I make my starer before using (and the
weather), so going with a 3 or 4 stage grow over 24 hours before use
gets it just a foaming away which makes for a 'fast' rise.

Adding a commercial yeast to this 'starter' doesn't really do much
unless it 'maybe' stabilizes the rise time, But I have tried it both
ways several times and don't think the commercial yeast even grows well
if at all in the active sourdough.

If I follow the book recipe that only calls for one overnight 'souring'
of some flour and water, then commercial yeast is needed.  This is not
the same as using a 'sourdough starter', I think this is just for some
'sour' taste.

I have gotten to the point now where I follow the 'basic' recommendation
of one cookbook, 'The Joy of Cooking' where it says I can use two cups
of sourdough starter in place of one commercial yeast cake or packet and
it's cup of water in any recipe that calls for yeast. (my starter
is/seems a bit drier than theirs and needs a half cup of water to match
that for mixing volumes)

I am having great fun using it that way and my 'market' (family and
boarders) like my 'experiments' too.  I still do make nice fluffy plain
old white bread and rolls with commercial yeast as a change up, but make
all our bread products these days and like variety.

I found this site helpful: http://samartha.net/index.html

He deals mostly with rye, but the methods for the starter are the same
and the links are good reading.

I find that (my) starter(s), when run in a more controlled environment
(temperature, hydration, time), run like clockwork.

Since I am doing the DM-3 process, I find the resulting starter having
the same quality every time. There may be nuances I am missing, but the
rise times are the same and the final product as well.

I made a couple of pictures to help a friend:

http://tinyurl.com/yry9fh
(will stay a limited time there)

That's 40/60 rye/wheat, 68 % hydration, intended 2 + 2 h rising, real
2:45 + 1:55 h.

I may have the dough development better down, but from a starter/dough
fermentation time perspective, nothing noticeable has changed for me
during the 4+ years I am using the DM-3 now.

Based on that, I would think that your variations are caused  by your
handling and not on the starter itself - and you say yourself that it
all depends how &quot;lively&quot; you make your starter - you _making_, not the
starter being &quot;not really consistent&quot;.

Don't blame the holey starter;-)

I think the responses of waller.will ... @gmail.com and Mike Romain
(roma ... @sympatico.ca) should be helpful for you.   I'll add that Peter Reinhart's books,
The Bread Baker's Apprentice and Crust and Crumb are good books on building
bread, sourdough and commercial yeast bread.   I have also found that King
Arthur Flour's Baker's Companion is also a helpful guide.  The Bread Baker's
Apprentice gives a lot of reasoning and philosophy of bread making (building).

Lol, exactly Brian, Mine is totally reliable, I can get exactly the
same bread no matter what the weather, but then having spent time to
listen to the experts, taken good notes and taken into account the
temperature that day might have something to do with that. Going

Could easily be my handling and environment, I don't 'weigh' out
ingredients and don't always have the same amount of starter saved to
start over with or even the same kind of water.

I think the unpredictability is part of the fun of making SD bread.

My kitchen varies from 70 to well over 100 degrees during the/each day
and the humidity here can be 100% some days with 40% normal these days.
It varies hourly here in the bottom of the Great Lakes Basin.

Some days I feed my starter when it comes out of the fridge a cup of
flour and a little over a half cup of water and it starts growing in an
hour or two and the next feeds continue to be 'fast'.  Some days it
doesn't do anything for 4 or more hours and consecutive feeds will be
slower rises too.

I gave up trying to hurry it, I just make white bread if needed in a
hurry, and even give it an extra feed if it comes faster than I need it,
so I 'am' getting more 'stable' effects but still.  I think the
unpredictability is part of the fun of making SD bread.

Your above results were even off in 'expected rises'.

I also find that the water I use makes a difference in rise times with
tap water taking a 'long' time some days. (high chlorine content)
Bottled plain spring water seems best.  Just tried 'ozonized' spring
water my wife brought home and it was 'really' slow.  Enh, just went and
read the label on it and they stuck 1 mg of chlorine per liter in it,
figures...

Still learning for sure...

My variables aren't the same from batch to batch for sure.

Worse than watching toast....

At least I know at the first feeding when 'that' batch is going to be
ready because a fast one goes sponge fast from the first feed out of the
fridge and the slow one starts slow and stays that way for at least 4
feeds it would seem.

I just had a real slow one so I made white bread.  Strange one too, it
didn't bubble much for a day and a half, then exploded all over the
counter last night.  LOL!

My rye SD starter was slower than usual a few days ago too.

I found out that the 'pure spring' water I thought I was using is
ozonized and has 1 mg of Chlorine per liter/quart of water in it.

Tell you what - If I had started with the DM-3 right from scratch, it

Fulfilling one of your hearts desire:

1 - container
2 - aquarium heater 94 F, 34 C, 250 W

I think hat's really good.
All this faith stuff - isn't that about believing something  without
solid proof?
So - all that would be not knowing for sure.
With sourdough (and Wu-Wei)  it's very little believing - actually none.
That's solid experience.
If the bread tastes great, you know it (or your wife tells you). If it
does not rise - you don't have believe that it's not rising, you know
it, when you see it - or not, in this case. No question of faith or
believing. Actually the less, the better in this case - saves you a lot
of trouble.

As for suggesting to a &quot;noobie&quot; the DM-3. I am trying to help somebody
to get started and - I hear:  &quot;that's not how a starter should look
like, I put more water in so it looks right&quot;. That's faith and
believing. Faith that this is right and believing it will work and solve
the problem of lack of rise and sourness.
No such thing with the DM-3 - how it &quot;should&quot; look never comes up. It is
done as prescribed and works.

I am all for suggesting to &quot;noobies&quot; the DM-3. If temp cannot be
completely controlled, at least, the hydrations and fermentation times
can be  met or approximated. It gives great exposure to different
hydration  looks of a starter and the factors which influence starter
growth and quality. That's definitely a great progress over the  &quot;triple
three times&quot;, the &quot;wait until it has peaked, then use it&quot;, &quot;wait until
it gets active, then use it&quot;  or the  &quot;it feels right, now I make bread&quot;
methods I have used.

So -

Only in some forms of Christianity. Hence the need for the phrase
'blind faith'. To the rest of the world it's about knowing someone or
something to be reliable from past, personal experience. Like knowing
the bridge you're about to cross won't fall when you get to the
middle because you or someone you trust has done it a hundred times
or you've seen the structural test. 'Blind faith' would be like
crossing a bridge you or no one you know has experience of just
because it makes you feel better believing it to be safe. Blind faith
would be like signing away $200,000 on an apartment you've never seen
based solely on the guy selling it to you having a nice face and a
charming way about him. That's crazy. Faith is understanding that the
practices you are doing lead to happiness because of previous
experience and that reason and experience tell you that happiness and
hatred are mutually exclusive. If I want to be happy it makes no
sense to practice hatred I can use reason and logic to give me faith
that the teacher is giving good teaching.

Unless you have direct perception of the said things. Direct
perception being bypassing all the confusion of the emotions and
projections of the ordinary mind like seeing a snake when in fact
it's a coiled rope or seeing a cat rather than a bag caught by the
wind. Movement of any kind is an illusion, a construction of the mind
so you must have faith in the past perception of the previous mind
moment in combination with the next mind moment to 'see' any rise in
the dough. It is all about faith. If you ever misunderstood anything
or tipped over a crack in the pavement you can be sure or have faith
that you don't have direct perception.

I get the following:

1 fl oz = 29.5735 ml
8 fl oz = 236.5880 ml
density of water at 20°C = 0.9982 g / ml
mass of 8 fl oz = 236.1621 g

density of water at 30°C = 0.9957 g / ml
mass of 8 fl oz at 30 °C = 235.5707 g

Both of those values are outside the range you mention
The difference in 10°C in this range is 0.5914 g

I know two bits from maybe 100 years ago, what &quot;they&quot; did on one place:

The wood for the oven to make bread was specially selected.

The time to make the sourdough was dependent on the weather - not when
thunderstorms were coming up.

That was told by a guy who asked his father who was a boy and watched
how they made bread. The father himself never made bread in that village.

And - you know all the other stuff which is now different from earlier days?

I have a book about a 700 year old bakery which gives some information.

In the Roman empire, mill and bakers were one enterprise. In Christian
medieval  times this was split up.

Bread quality, size/weight were big issues - bakers cheating and caught
underwent a baker's baptize - locked into a basked and lowered several
times into water or liquid manure.

Dishonesty was an issue - millers were often dishonest. Sayings:  The
good thing is  that the sacks in a mill cannot speak. A stork never
builds his nest on a miller's house because he is afraid that  the
miller steals his eggs.

A 794 document mentions bread made from beans, semolina, buckwheat and
mainly oats. Assumed is that flat breads of that type were the main
bread of common folks.

During frequent famines, it is reported, breads were made from horse
chestnuts, leaves and grasses.....

11th century a monk in St. Gallen monastory Switzerland - Ekkehart IV
recorded in his &quot;&quot;Benedictiones ad mensas&quot; (blessing over diverse foods
and drinks):

bread cake, moon-shaped bread, boiled bread, roasted bread - sprinkled
with salt, egg-bread, yeast-raised bread, sourdough-raised bread,
oblaten, unsoured bread, spelt bread, wheat bread, rye bread, barley
bread, oat bread, newly baked bread, cold and warm bread, under
smoldering ash baked bread.

Baking wagon (1656)
http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOnezoom.asp?dep=11&amp;zoomFlag...;

In villages, they had one baking house - Picture - Return from baking
house (1860):
http://www.kunstkopie.de/a/sondermann-hermann/rueckkehr-vom-backhaus....

nuff.....

not much about ergot and health consequences coming from that in that
book....

I don't think the flat bread issue was because of lack of being able to
produce sourdough without the items mentioned above (see &quot;49ers&quot; and
&quot;Yukon&quot;).  Many parts of the world, and particularly northern/central
Europe, the main grains grown weren't particularly glutenous.

Ok. So that's settled. On to the next order of business.

How much does a cup of flour weigh? We're talkin' all-purpose, white,
not bromated (sorry Dick).

I want figures to the mole, dammit. Avogadro's number and all that jazz.

&gt; What 'did' they do before the days of computers, digital scales and

Yawn. Oh for goodness sake guys. There's just so many ways you're
being so completely inane. It's like laughing at &quot;Homo erectus&quot; no,

I really don't get why so many people keep harping on about how
people used to make bread. The amount of times I hear 'Well, how did
they do it on the Oregon trail...?' I really don't give a stuff.
What's important is what is the best and simplest way with good
compromise that I can make bread that I enjoy eating now. Despite all
protestations from one or two the quickest and most reliable way I
can make the loaf of bread that I want, not that is just good, that I
set out to make is with a tare-able scale. If by some weird
catastrophe society collapsed and I could no longer buy batteries or
a new scale and assuming wheat was still available and I didn't have
more pressing things on my mind like not being eaten by rapid dogs, I
know I'd be able to make a good loaf without scales. I know because
when I'm at someone else's house who doesn't have scales I do and
very well, but it's still quicker and easier with a scale. I can't
help seeing the irony of those that cling to the 'simplicity' of cups
typing away at their computers.

&gt; I am wondering what resources-books/websites-you'd recommend for a

&gt; sourdough, and also &quot;why&quot; I am making it like I am--both chemically,
&gt; and historically.

&gt; Also, I am confused about soured dough and yeast. Was soured dough
&gt; originally a replacement for yeast, or were both used? Because in my
&gt; recipe books I am surprised to see that the recipes call for both
&gt; soured dough and yeast. Is this always the case?

&gt; Thank you.

&gt; &gt; So, for water, the error of volume measurement at 30°C is
&gt; &gt; ~(0.9982-0.9957)/.9982 or 0.25%?  Dont'ya know how
&gt; &gt; that kind of erroneousness petrifies me?

&gt; I am used to errors in that range, probably because I make
&gt; so many of them.

D'ya know this, smart-a**?:  You can determine both &quot;hydration*&quot;
and cup capacity, in flour weight/mass, by 1.  keeping track of the volume
of water and number of cups of flour used , and 2.  weighing the
finished dough.  It is kind of an algebraic kind of a thing that
smart-a**s and high-school student might like.  Failure to figure
in salt weight may cause an intolerable error.

Scales are cheap, I bought a nice one for $140.00 and you can use it for
other things beside making bread.

Like I weight the water to rice I cook, perfit rice every time. (:-)
