Hi everyone,

I initially thought "rank"  should be used this way:

He ranks third in his class.

However, I later found "rank" can be also used like that:

He is ranked third in class.

Then I got really confused. Do you use "rank" in either way, and either
of the sentence means the same thing?  Thanks in advance,

Gloria

"Rank" the verb is best explained in terms of one of the senses of
"rank" the noun, in that "to rank" means either "to assign a rank to"
or "to hold a particular rank" (which is the meaning in your example).
"Rank" as a noun can mean many things, but the relevant one is "a set
position in a scale of classifications"--as with "major" being a rank
in the military hierarchy.

The only difference between your two castings is that the first is in
the active voice and the second in the passive voice.  The active voice
is the usual mode of expression in expository prose; the passive voice
is used to shift the focus of the thought in a clause from the
grammatical subject to something else.

In the first sentence, the focus of our thought on reading it is,
naturally, the "he" who is its subject.  In the second sentence, our
attention tends toward the unmentioned but implied person or agency
that is doing the ranking.

The point is easier to grasp when the alternative focus is present in
the sentence:

"John Roebling designed the Brooklyn Bridge." - our focus is on
Roebling.

"The Brooklyn Bridge was designed by John Roebling." - our focus is on
the bridge.

I'm going to, I fear, muddy the waters a bit here. There is another
sense of "rank" as a verb: to hold a superior rank, as in "I have to
do it his way; he ranks me."  It's not a common form anymore (if,
indeed it ever was,) as most people in my experience would use
"outrank" in that case.

I think it's almost exclusively a US usage. I remember it from the Burns
brothers' "Civil War" series where they used "She ranks me" as the heading
for a chapter which concentrated on the work of women in nursing. It was
ostensibly a quote by a senior Union officer about a civilian woman who
bossed him around.

That could almost be "She rankles me".

Well, it could *almost* be a lot of things.
