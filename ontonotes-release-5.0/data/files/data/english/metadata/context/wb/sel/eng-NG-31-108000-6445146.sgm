I don't think I'm an official scrapbooker (yet) but kind of getting
into it, or related.

As I mentioned elsewhere, I got a spiral binder machine (I'm still
fighting with) and have made 2 bookls of pictures for my husband,
who's in a nursing home after having a stroke. I got the idea of
printing out pictures, large size, on cardstock or cover paper, and
putting some together with the spiral binder. He really likes this,
the alternative is putting pictures up on a bulletin board across the
room or having separate pictures out loose.

Several times the staff in the nursing home have looked at the
books and commented on them.

One of them said I should be doing scrapbook pages. She said her
friend makes them and puts them for sale on ebay and they sell for $20
each and she sells all she makes. Of course, I came home and looked
and there were over 1000 auctions for scrapbook pages! Some were $20
or so each, some "2 for".

One of my daughters said she has made several scrapbooks for her
little boy's pictures, and she buys the pages at Michael's Crafts (she
lives near one) for around $2.99 each, but not unique, specially made.
She has scrapbooks that come with plastic sheets she makes up the
pages (with photos) and slips them in.

What I noticed in the auctions is, most of them are 12"X12" in
size. I've never had or seen a home printer that prints that big. Mine
will fill a standard size paper (11 X 8 1/2" the printer I now have
has duplex printing (both sides) and "borderless" if set for this)

Do any of you print your own scrapbook pages? If so, do you have
a printer that size or maybe set up the pages and take them to a
printer or copy place, etc?

How do you put your scrapbooks together?

If you bought pages (any size) would they come with holes in
them for a spiral binder, or punched holes like looseleaf, or do you
all use albums like my daughter said, with plastic sleeves to put them
in?

If you buy them, like from someone on ebay, they come in an
envelope that size? (or maybe rolled in a tube)

Do you ever make scrapbooks smaller than 12 X 12"?

Do you make scrapbooks like the ones I made (and will make more
of) for my husband, printing the pictures right out on the paper? I've
been making them with one big picture per page, but going by what I
saw on ebay, it looks like several colored squares (to attach photos
to) per page, with sayings and words and designs? This could be set up
and the pictures printed right on (of course they don't come out
glossy that way)

I didn't realize I was making scrapbooks with the picture
books, but in a way I guess I am.

I'm planning on making one for my grandson's 4th birthday which
is coming up, with pictures of trains (he LOVES trains)  This is the
one who's mother made the scrapbooks for him and she got pages that
had train theme on them.  I could buy glossy photo paper and print
them out smaller and attack them to the pages, but so far the books
I've been making need to be fairly durable, for a bedridden person and
now for a 4 year old.

I remember buying scrapbooks when I was a child, they were all
put together with pages (very soft, light paper, not too sturdy) like
a coloring book with nothing on the pages. And cutting out pictures
and gluing them in. Seems like they were fairly big. But I didn't have
to print them or mail them.

I was reading the posts and see in the recipe thread some said
making 12 X 12 pages is easy, but you had to make them smaller (set
them up) for the recipies?

Welcome to RCS starchild!  I don't print my own pages, but there are some
here who do.  There actually are printers for 12 x 12 paper.  Someone here
found a place that will print digital scrapbook pages on 12 x 12.  Hopefully
they'll respond and give you the info.

I use post-bound albums to put my scrapbooks together.  The albums usually
have 2 posts and screws that screw into them and keeps everything together
very nicely.

All my current albums have the plastic sleeves, called page protectors.  I
simply slide my pages into the page protectors and I"m done.  If I bought
pages, I would prefer they not have holes in them so I can slip them into
page protectors.

I've never bought any pages from ebay, so I can't tell you how they come.  I
know you can ship 12 x 12 layouts perfectly in an unused large pizza box.
Just ask for a pizza box at a pizza place, and put it together so that the
writing is on the inside, and you have a perfect shipping box.  Hopefully
someone here can maybe help out with the envelope idea.  I'm sure there's
envelopes out there that size, but I haven't looked, either.

I've made some 6 x 6 scrapbook pages, and even smaller.  Most scrapbook
albums come in 6 x 6, 8 1/2 x 11, or 12 x 12.  Although, 8 x 8 seems to
becoming a popular size, too.

THe colored squares you're seeing are called "mats".  They're usually paper
or cardstock, and the photo goes on it.  The paper or cardstock is a little
bit larger than the picture, so you see the paper or cardstock behind the
photo.  I've used either photos developed at a photo developer, or pictures
I've printed myself on photo paper.  But I do add embellishments, quotes,
and journaling to my pages.

Hopefully that helps you out some!

Hi StarChild, I'm Kate and I've been scrapping for most of my life.
The acid free/safe way for 10 years now.  I'm addicted but not an
addict as I can walk into AC Moore/Michaels/JoAnne's and not buy a
thing.  I'm saving, with my husband, for a house.

I'm sorry about your husband but my dad had a stroke and is fine now.

Welcome to our little piece of cyberspace and I look forward to
sharing ideas with you.

Here's my answers to your questions:

" What I noticed in the auctions is, most of them are 12"X12" in
size. I've never had or seen a home printer that prints that big.
Mine
will fill a standard size paper (11 X 8 1/2" the printer I now have
has duplex printing (both sides) and "borderless" if set for this)"

"Do any of you print your own scrapbook pages? If so, do you
have
a printer that size or maybe set up the pages and take them to a
printer or copy place, etc?"

Traditional 12x12 paper will not fit into our home computers and are
traditionally paper crafted, meaning you add the mats photos and
embellishments all separately.  My library, which is associated with
the city of NY and local SUNYs and CUNYs, has a 12 x 12 printer but
you have to reserve it days in advance and you pay $1 per page.

If I am to print my own pages using my Hallmark Scrapbooking Studio
program then it is traditionally 8x11 or smaller.

"How do you put your scrapbooks together?"

Slowly.  I take it one page at a time unless of course I'm doing a two
page spread.  My work can be seen here:

http://community.webshots.com/user/kateandlarry

I work on three albums at once because inspiration can come from
anywhere.

"If you bought pages (any size) would they come with holes in
them for a spiral binder, or punched holes like looseleaf, or do you
all use albums like my daughter said, with plastic sleeves to put
them
in?"

I buy in bulk page protectors which have the holes in them already and
keep the integrity of the layout intact.  Because looseleaf paper can
become ripped overtime I wouldn't go in that direction.  Page
protectors can fit into a looseleaf binder or a traditional post
album.  There are also albums called strap hinges but I don't like
them because I find that I can't get them tight enough and I'm 38 y-
o.  Scrapbooking is about preference and you should just find what is
in your comfort range.

"If you buy them, like from someone on ebay, they come in an
envelope that size? (or maybe rolled in a tube)"

I've bought scrapbook items from eBay because certain paper are not
sold here in the northeast.  I recommend these sellers:

http://stores.ebay.com/Scrapbooking-and-More_W0QQssPageNameZstrkQ3ame...

http://stores.ebay.com/lisaslines-eyelets-rubber-stamps_W0QQssPageNam...

I also buy fromt his website:

http://www.rubberstampauction.com/cgi-bin/Auction

Staples and OfficeMax have large enough mailing envelopes of strength
that you can ship large layouts in them.  So doesn't the post office
and the clean pizza box idea has been bounced around a few times in
this message board but I haven't used it myself.

"Do you ever make scrapbooks smaller than 12 X 12"?"

I do.  I've made a 4x6 album for my sister, see the ABC album:

http://mrsgoofy2b-ivil.tripod.com/

I've also made an 8x8 album for my trip to Newport with my husband:

http://family.webshots.com/album/556756863zhszHf

and most if not all my 8.5x11 albums are digitally created.

"Do you make scrapbooks like the ones I made (and will make
more
of) for my husband, printing the pictures right out on the paper?
I've
been making them with one big picture per page, but going by what I
saw on ebay, it looks like several colored squares (to attach photos
to) per page, with sayings and words and designs? This could be set
up
and the pictures printed right on (of course they don't come out
glossy that way)"

I bet the scrapbooks are nice but you need to upload them so we can
oooh and ahhh over them and possibly scrap-lift the ideas.

The several colored squares are called frames or mounts.  When they
come with sayings it is either a journalling square or title.  If
there is one word such as "Aunt _______" then it is a title square.
If there is a lot of writing on the square then it is a journally
block.

"I didn't realize I was making scrapbooks with the picture
books, but in a way I guess I am."

I made a picture book for my niece Sarah (who will be 2 in april) so
she can carry photos in her purse like her mommy.  But for your
husband's recovery and Physical therapy I'm sure they are very helpful
in the memory recovery that his doctors are working with.

"I'm planning on making one for my grandson's 4th birthday
which
is coming up, with pictures of trains (he LOVES trains)  This is the
one who's mother made the scrapbooks for him and she got pages that
had train theme on them.  I could buy glossy photo paper and print
them out smaller and attach them to the pages, but so far the books
I've been making need to be fairly durable, for a bedridden person
and
now for a 4 year old."

I bet it will look great.  Don't forget to look in the sticker aisle
of your LSS as they have train stickers there.

"I remember buying scrapbooks when I was a child, they were
all
put together with pages (very soft, light paper, not too sturdy) like
a coloring book with nothing on the pages. And cutting out pictures
and gluing them in. Seems like they were fairly big. But I didn't
have
to print them or mail them."

Me too.  most of my early scrapbooks are in these kinds of albums.  My
high school albums and college albums are in these kinds.  I actually
like them still to to this day.  I archivally misted them to protect
them when they went into storage.  I think I have 6-10 albums like
this one.

"I was reading the posts and see in the recipe thread some
said
making 12 X 12 pages is easy, but you had to make them smaller (set
them up) for the recipies?"

I wrote that only because I've been working in the 12x12 format for so
long traditionally that I forgot how to do 8.5x11 in the traditional
sense as I usually do it digitally.  It was a fun challege.  I forgot
to photograph the layout or I'd upload it to my webshots account.

I got some new ideas.

Like making backgrounds separate and not printing them outright on
12X12" pages.

I live in a rural area (northern VT- where it's been BLIZZARDING all
tday and supposed to till into tomorrow!) and don't have a car,  so
don't have stores I can get to and walk around in looking for things
like stickers. Buying online, they usually get you on shipping. With
paper, I've been making notecards, calendars, address labels, etc I
try and get them (250 envelopes in a box) from Staples, if it's over
$50 it's free shipping and comes next day FedEx.

This morning I happened to see the name Etsy.com  (on Rosie
O'Donnel's blog) I had never heard of this- didn't know it was there!

It's ebay for crafts. I've been looking over it in amazement. People
actually get those proces?

Like $15 plus shipping for a tiny 2 X 1 1/2 painting (on a little
piece of wood) of a flying pig?

Though just because someone puts up a sale doesn't mean many buy
them. I'm trying to think of what I'd do with a piece of wood with
something painted on it, that small? (LOL)

Since I've been making notecards and not sure what to do with
them, this might be an idea.

I just found a scrapbook for sale (all put together ready for
pictures) for $35.00 and $6 shipping, that's 8X6. Maybe this would be
called more of a "memory book". In this case it's a "baby book".

http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=5387440

Looks like it's heavier pages than plain cardstock? It says
"american crafts, spiral bound". The person said she designed it,
maybe she designs them and then has american crafts" print and put
them together for her?

I'm looking for something I can do with my pictures, designs,
printer. Not sure if scrapbooking (in the official sense) is it, but
there's a lot of possibilities. One idea I've had is a small booklet
(bigger than a greeting card, a little bit more) with a few pages and
pictures and affirmations or sayings or maybe even words.

Usually when I write about my ideas (not on 'craft' groups) someone
will tell me why it won't work, or nobody would pay for it- and how
regular printing companies (like big card companies) can make and sell
them for less, etc. But, going by what I see on Etsy, maybe hand made,
and unique still is of some value.

Many years ago, when my kids were small, I crochetted tops and
ponchos, etc on order, but by the time I bought the yarn, buttons,
what was needed and figured out the time it took (and going by what I
could charge people) it seemed like I made 50 cents an hour.

Not that I'm in it for the money... it's more doing what I love
and get interested in.
