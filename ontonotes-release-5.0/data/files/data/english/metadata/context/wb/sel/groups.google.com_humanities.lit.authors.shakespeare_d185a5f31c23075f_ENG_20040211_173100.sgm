NINE DAY NOVENA FOR OUR LADY OF LOURDES AND SAINT BERNADETTE

MEDITATION

Between February 11 and July 16, 1858, the Blessed Virgin Mary came
down from Heaven eighteen times and showed herself at Lourdes to
Bernadette Soubirous a little girl of fourteen years of age. On
February 11, while gathering wood, Bernadette heard a whistle of wind.
With astonished eyes she saw a niche in the upper part of a rock
filled with golden light, and there in the midst of it stood a Lady of
great beauty.

Her robe glowed with the whiteness of snow in the sunshine and
swept in majestic folds to the ground. Her head and shoulders were
framed by a white veil, which feel the full length of her robe. A blue
sash encircled her waist, and its two ends, wide and unornamented,
reached down in front almost to her feet. Each of her feet bore a rose
of purest gold. A rosary, whose beads were white and whose cross and
chain were of gold, hung from her right arm. Her hands were open, and
her arms outstretched slightly in front.

In her apparitions our Lady appealed for penance and prayers for
sinners. On March 25, the feast of the Annunciation, the Blessed
Mother declared her name to Bernadette and to the world. On that day
Bernadette made this request: &quot;My Lady, would you be so kind as to
tell me who you are?&quot;
