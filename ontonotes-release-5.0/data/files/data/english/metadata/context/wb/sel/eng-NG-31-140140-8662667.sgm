Spray this inside your frame to protect from rust and corrosion.
We use this on all Velo Orange frames and strongly recommend it. Developed

A can should do two frames.  My LHT is treated and my steel recumbent
was treated when I owned it.  My attitude is if I'm going to ride a
steel frame I'm going to rust proof it initially and probably again
sometime down the road when I have it stripped for an over haul.  Is
it essential to do so - no, but for the small cost and effort
involved why not cover that base.

safe riding,

Vik

I used it to treat my LHT frame before I built it up, and recently
used it on a (cheap) nashbar steel MTB frame that I am building up as
an Xtracycle.  Worth it to me for the little bit of additional peace
of mind.  You can get moisture inside a frame not only from the
obvious sources like riding in the rain, but from condensation due to
temperature changes - bike stored inside then taken outside for the
ride, for example.

Needed?  Probably not absolutely needed.  Any steel frame will
probably out-live me at this point even without any kind of rust-
proofing.  It is such a simple and inexpensive part of the build,
though, so why not?

I currently ride a 23 year old steel bicycle and it probably has never
been treated with any rust proofing inside. I live in the Pacific
Northwest (It rains here). I think for peace of mind, treating a bike
with a rust preventative is a good thing  but I wouldn't worry about
rust too much unless you live in an area where they salt the roads in
the winter.

Whether framesaver is worthwhile is controversial. A lot of today's
generation of steel-minded cyclists who learned everything from the
internet are very sold on it without much feel at all for how
necessary it actually is.

Unless ridden in very salty conditions, like heavily salted roads,
bikes with typical butted tubes don't tend to ever have any functional
problems with internal rust. With a .8/.5/.8 tt, LHT's have one tube
that's a bit thinner than the much more common .6mm tubes that really
set the context, but it can still basically be considered a non issue
unless you're going to ride salty slushy stuff.

The downside of Framesaver is that it's nasty, smelly, very toxic shit
that you'll be carrying around forever, and it does cost money.

It's also important to understand that if you want to care about
internal rust, the absolute first and foremost thing to do is drill a
drainage hole underneath your BB shell. This allows a route of escape
other than gradual evaporation for water that does get inside your
frame, which makes a HUGE difference in terms of preventing rust. It's
insane and wrong that steel frames don't come like this. It's also
pretty silly that this isn't pointed out by all the various online
sources touting Framesaver.

Also, you can just use lube to coat the inside of your frame every
once in a while. You can do this by blasting a spray lube in or using
a liquid lube and then rotating the frame around to spread it. You'll
have to do it periodically and it won't be as effective as the
extremely tenacious Framesaver, but it does seriously help prevent
rust, which again is generally a non-issue to begin with.

Unfortunately I noticed one minor barrier (literally) in my LHT and
that is in the area of the chain stay junction and the bottom bracket
shell. While there is a hole in the shell its smaller than the chain
stay and that creates essentially a wall for water to pool up. I
thought about grinding or drilling the area right at the bottom of
that hole lower to help let water drain down the chain stay and into
the bottom bracket and out a drain hole, which I would also have to
drill. Being that this barrier forms a little area for water to
collect right at a weld joint I'll just about bet there will be
problems there in the future for some owners.  The down tube suffers
from the same issue. On a lugged frame the tubing just fits within the
lug letting water drain to the lowest point but a tigged frame with
tubes butted up to the shell and welded, creates a barrier or a &quot;dam&quot;
for water to pool and rust the weld joint. Of course any modification
to the frame would probably void the warranty but I am concerned about
this on my frame. Whether from condensation or road water this could
be a problem for quite a few welded steel bike frames (of any brand)
that use high quality thin walled tubing.

That does suck, but in the case of the chainstays, I wonder if it'd
actually ever be an issue in practice. I suppose it's a quesiton of
how much water the vent holes can actually let in even in extreme use,
since that's really the only way water is going to get into the
chainstays. However, the chainstays are a very typical .9mm at the
thick ends, like millions of other chromo TIG bikes built the same
way, and this doesn't seem to come up in practice on any of those
bikes, so it doesn't seem like much to worry about.

The only entry point that would get water into the downtube seems like
it would be the headtube opening, and it's hard to imagine enough
water coming in through there to actually collect next to the BB.

I think that if you're going to worry about this anywhere on the bike
other than the BB, it's water collecting in the top tube that's most
likely to cause problems. Water from the seattube opening can get in
there, it's got nowhere to go, and it's kinda far away from any kind
of vent for whatever that's worth  Once a friend of mine had the fork
out of his lugged Panasonic, being used as a daily PNW year-round
commute bike for a couple years, and I spotted a rather distressing
pool of rusty water there at the HT joint, a perfectly nasty place for
it no less.

Try plugging up your vent holes with RTV gasket sealant or beeswax to
prevent water intrusion.  Of course, only try this once your sure the
innards of your frame are completely dry.

I second John's advice.  Have used beeswax to plug the vent holes on
my Bianchi Volpe.  The Cross Check hasn't had it done (yet).  Am
unsure whether I'd ever coat the inside of the frame.  While I think
it has merit, many great bikes out there never had it done and seem to
survive okay.

Read someplace (although can't remember if it's the web or printed)
that engine fogging oil can be used to coat the inside of the frame.

What about condensation?
As an aside, my daughter kept her mountain bike outside for the better
part of a year and didn't have fenders or fender mount bolts installed
etc. quite a bit of water got inside through the bridge at the bottom
bracket where a fender bolt goes through. I literally lifted the front
end of her bike up and orange water poured out through the rear stay,
vent holes.
I will be taking her bike apart this winter and will inspect the
insides of her tubing with dental mirrors and perhaps a bore scope to
see how rusty or pitted the steel is.  After that, I will treat the
rust with a rust converter and then some Framesaver.
My old Centurion had numerous rust spots on the outside of the tubes
before powdercoating but the insides were really pretty clean and that
was on a 27 year old frame that had obviously been rode hard and put
away wet a few times. I think steel gets a bad reputation regarding
rust and advertisers play up the rust issue to keep people buying
aluminum. Of course aluminum corrodes, just like steel rusts, its just
that we don't talk about it.
I'm going to keep an eye on my new LHT frame and take all the
preventative steps to keep it unaffected by rust but I am not going to
let myself worry excessively about the whole issue. I figure I have
about 25 good years of cycling left so any frame I buy should last me
that long as I'm still riding two 20+ year old bikes now.

&gt; That does suck, but in the case of the chainstays, I wonder if it'd
&gt; actually ever be an issue in practice. I suppose it's a quesiton of
&gt; how much water the vent holes can actually let in even in extreme use,
&gt; since that's really the only way water is going to get into the
&gt; chainstays. However, the chainstays are a very typical .9mm at the
&gt; thick ends, like millions of other chromo TIG bikes built the same
&gt; way, and this doesn't seem to come up in practice on any of those
&gt; bikes, so it doesn't seem like much to worry about.

&gt; The only entry point that would get water into the downtube seems like
&gt; it would be the headtube opening, and it's hard to imagine enough
&gt; water coming in through there to actually collect next to the BB.

&gt; I think that if you're going to worry about this anywhere on the bike
&gt; other than the BB, it's water collecting in the top tube that's most
&gt; likely to cause problems. Water from the seattube opening can get in
&gt; there, it's got nowhere to go, and it's kinda far away from any kind
&gt; of vent for whatever that's worth  Once a friend of mine had the fork
&gt; out of his lugged Panasonic, being used as a daily PNW year-round
&gt; commute bike for a couple years, and I spotted a rather distressing
&gt; pool of rusty water there at the HT joint, a perfectly nasty place for
&gt; it no less.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's also important to understand that if you want to care about
&gt; &gt; &gt; internal rust, the absolute first and foremost thing to do is drill a
&gt; &gt; &gt; drainage hole underneath your BB shell. This allows a route of escape

I used Boeshield T9 on my LHT and the Guerciotti I built up a couple
of months ago. It was easy to do, the can was about $7, and what's
left over in the can is a decent chain lube.

Water can still get in various ways, and you want the vent holes there

My idea would be to drill and additional drain hole under the chain
stay hole inside the bottom bracket shell to let the water drain to
the bottom bracket and then drill and additional drain hole in the
bottom bracket shell.

There seems to be quite the obsession (and quite a bit if mis-
information) about this :)

I think it is pretty much a  non-issue in the real world.  How many
steel frames have you seen that failed due to internal rust?

Vent holes are only important during the framebuilding process.  Many
top framebuilders braze them up when the frame is complete, but you
can't expect that detail on a production tig-welded frame.  Plug 'em
with RTV or beeswax if you like.

Drilling a &quot;drain hole&quot; in the bb shell - close to the ground and in
an area susceptible to spray from the front wheel - also seems like a
bad idea to me.  As Jobst Brandt once said &quot;Don't put any
gratuitous leaks in the frame.  Just keep it dry on the inside.&quot;  But
drill 'em if you like.

I don't plug any holes, and I don't drill any new ones.  I do use that
stuff that Brandt called a &quot;boutique elixir for the paranoid&quot;.

Chances are none of us will live long enough to see our Surly fail due
to internal rust - be it plugged, drilled, treated or untreated.  Now
get out there and ride it!

I agree with your analogy Chuck.

Geez ... I've got an old CCM Grand Prix that my father bought me when I was
just 14 (41 yrs ago) and it had stayed outside in the rain many days and
nights, and it still looks almost as good as it did way back when. The frame
is still strong, and pretty much rust free. And, I still ride it today when
I feel a bit nostalgic!

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brand)
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that use high quality thin walled tubing.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; John

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Water can still get in various ways, and you want the vent holes
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; there
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to allow evaporation. They're important.

&gt;&gt; &gt; What would you suggest then, for the person who has pooling water

As I understand it -and I'm still learning all this although I've read
a lot- there's no consensus about this on tubes that won't be
completely sealed. Many builders, doing lugged frames, seal the vent
holes on seatstays and fork blades. This completely seals those tubes,
preventing any oxidation beyond the negligible, probably invisible
amount caused by the oxygen trapped within.

Many builders have the opinion that any tube open at one end, such as
a chainstay is open to the BB on any typical brazed or tig'd frame,
should be open at both ends to allow moisture to escape. And others do
plug the chainstay vent holes, although I think that most handbuilt
brazed bikes don't ever have vent holes in the chainstays, not sure
why.

Again, I'm not an expert, but I do ride in the rain all the time, and
a bike full of vent holes has done me very well.

Water entering from the seat tube opening and causing rust in the BB
shell is a real issue on bikes that get ridden in wet conditions,
period. A drain hole helps mitigate this and is not going to let much
in at all, and is certainly something that good framebuilders include
( http://richardsachs.com/nuovorichiegallery/pages/NR-28.html ). Just
recently a friend of mine took out his BB on an LHT with no drain hole
that had been used for a couple years of constant Northwest commuting.
Totally rusty, and he's a mechanic and certainly greased it thoroughly
during installation.

You're probably right - my wife's 30+ year-old Peugeot has had lots of
external (and probably internal) rust for many years - she still puts in 100
miles/week on it and wouldn't think of riding anything else

I don't bother plugging vent holes and I have had no problems either.
I suggested plugging those holes when a person had standing water
issues within his chainstays.  I'd try this easy fix before drilling
into a frame.

Does Richard Sachs always leave the vent holes unplugged?  Nope.

You want that inside your BB shell?

If you look around enough, you can find a person who's had all sorts
of issues.  It's the variables in each person's story that makes these
examples unconvincing.

That said; I don't plug my frame's vent holes.  I don't have standing
water inside my frame.  If my frame collected water, I'd try to
prevent it's entry, as I think it is sounder advice than drilling into
the frame.  I'd save drilling for my last option.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shell. While there is a hole in the shell its smaller than the
&gt; chain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stay and that creates essentially a wall for water to pool up. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought about grinding or drilling the area right at the bottom
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that hole lower to help let water drain down the chain stay and
&gt; into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the bottom bracket and out a drain hole, which I would also have
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drill. Being that this barrier forms a little area for water to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; collect right at a weld joint I'll just about bet there will be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems there in the future for some owners.  The down tube
&gt; suffers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the same issue. On a lugged frame the tubing just fits

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lug letting water drain to the lowest point but a tigged frame
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tubes butted up to the shell and welded, creates a barrier or a
&gt; &quot;dam&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for water to pool and rust the weld joint. Of course any
&gt; modification
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the frame would probably void the warranty but I am concerned
&gt; about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this on my frame. Whether from condensation or road water this
&gt; could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be a problem for quite a few welded steel bike frames (of any
&gt; brand)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that use high quality thin walled tubing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Try plugging up your vent holes with RTV gasket sealant or beeswax
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prevent water intrusion.  Of course, only try this once your sure
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; innards of your frame are completely dry.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Water can still get in various ways, and you want the vent holes
&gt; there
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to allow evaporation. They're important.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What would you suggest then, for the person who has pooling water
&gt; &gt; &gt; within his chain stays?

&gt; &gt; I think it is pretty much a  non-issue in the real world.  How many

&gt; &gt; Vent holes are only important during the framebuilding process.  Many

&gt; &gt; Drilling a &quot;drain hole&quot; in the bb shell - close to the ground and in

&gt; &gt; bad idea to me.  As Jobst Brandt once said &quot;Don't put any
&gt; &gt; gratuitous leaks in the frame.  Just keep it dry on the inside.&quot;  But
&gt; &gt; drill 'em if you like.

&gt; &gt; I don't plug any holes, and I don't drill any new ones.  I do use that
&gt; &gt; stuff that Brandt called a &quot;boutique elixir for the paranoid&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Chances are none of us will live long enough to see our Surly fail due

On my recent single speed project I had an old cup and cone bottom
bracket installed and after a 30 minute ride in pouring rain with no
fenders ( the kind where you can't see through your glasses) I noticed
a week later that the crank felt gritty. I took it apart and rusty
goop came out and the bearings were ruined. I replaced the bottom
bracket with a sealed unit and took out the rivet for the cable guides
effectively removing the cable guide as well. This created a drain
hole but my intention is to tap it and thread a bolt in it so I can
remove it to let any moisture drain. I suspect I won't have any since
I installed fenders and in the process plugged the fender bridge
behind the bottom bracket. Adding fenders also keeps water from
entering the headset and steer tube . The only place water can  get in
is the brazing vent holes. These don't usually allow water in if
fenders are used and the addition of beeswax (non permanent and
removable) should keep water out. The only problem is condensation
forming on the insides.........if you coat the innards with a
protectant and allow the inside to vent, it shouldn't be a large
problem, assuming there is no large amount of standing water
collecting and any that is inside can drain out a threaded drain hole
on the bottom bracket.
Keep in mind that most cyclists don't ride often in pouring rain. The
few that do are generally fairly savvy and end up with sealed bearings
and take steps to preserve their frame set.

&gt; &gt; As I understand it -and I'm still learning all this although I've read
&gt; &gt; a lot- there's no consensus about this on tubes that won't be
&gt; &gt; completely sealed.

&gt; I agree, there is no consensus.

&gt; &gt; Many builders, doing lugged frames, seal the vent
&gt; &gt; holes on seatstays and fork blades. This completely seals those tubes,
&gt; &gt; preventing any oxidation beyond the negligible, probably invisible
&gt; &gt; amount caused by the oxygen trapped within.

&gt; &gt; Many builders have the opinion that any tube open at one end, such as
&gt; &gt; a chainstay is open to the BB on any typical brazed or tig'd frame,
&gt; &gt; should be open at both ends to allow moisture to escape. And others do
&gt; &gt; plug the chainstay vent holes, although I think that most handbuilt
&gt; &gt; brazed bikes don't ever have vent holes in the chainstays, not sure
&gt; &gt; why.

&gt; This is a very odd paragraph.  You say that many frame builders (what
&gt; builders?) opinion is to have an opening at both ends of a tube to
&gt; allow moisture to escape, yet say that most hand built brazed bikes
&gt; don't ever have vent holes in the chainstays.  See the contradiction?

&gt; &gt; Again, I'm not an expert, but I do ride in the rain all the time, and
&gt; &gt; a bike full of vent holes has done me very well.

&gt; I don't bother plugging vent holes and I have had no problems either.
&gt; I suggested plugging those holes when a person had standing water
&gt; issues within his chainstays.  I'd try this easy fix before drilling
&gt; into a frame.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Drilling a &quot;drain hole&quot; in the bb shell - close to the ground and in
&gt; &gt; &gt; an area susceptible to spray from the front wheel - also seems like a
&gt; &gt; &gt; bad idea to me.  As Jobst Brandt once said &quot;Don't put any
&gt; &gt; &gt; gratuitous leaks in the frame.  Just keep it dry on the inside.&quot;  But
&gt; &gt; &gt; drill 'em if you like.

&gt; &gt; Water entering from the seat tube opening and causing rust in the BB
&gt; &gt; shell is a real issue on bikes that get ridden in wet conditions,
&gt; &gt; period.

&gt; Well, I wouldn't spell out period at the end of that statement.  I
&gt; ride year-round in Vermont and have never had that issue.

&gt; &gt; A drain hole helps mitigate this and is not going to let much
&gt; &gt; in at all, and is certainly something that good framebuilders include
&gt; &gt; ( http://richardsachs.com/nuovorichiegallery/pages/NR-28.html ).

&gt; Does Richard Sachs always leave the vent holes unplugged?  Nope.

&gt; Also, what's the filthiest part of your bike, as it stands right now?
&gt; You want that inside your BB shell?

&gt; &gt; Just
&gt; &gt; recently a friend of mine took out his BB on an LHT with no drain hole
&gt; &gt; that had been used for a couple years of constant Northwest commuting.
&gt; &gt; Totally rusty, and he's a mechanic and certainly greased it thoroughly
&gt; &gt; during installation.

&gt; If you look around enough, you can find a person who's had all sorts
&gt; of issues.  It's the variables in each person's story that makes these
&gt; examples unconvincing.

&gt; That said; I don't plug my frame's vent holes.  I don't have standing
&gt; water inside my frame.  If my frame collected water, I'd try to
&gt; prevent it's entry, as I think it is sounder advice than drilling into
&gt; the frame.  I'd save drilling for my last option.

A couple of days ago a friend brought over his 80's Bianchi Limited
because his crank felt a little loose.  I pulled the bottom bracket
out and found small remnants of bearing holders, blackened ball
bearings that looked like old cannon balls, and piles of black dust
and rust.  It did not have a bottom bracket drain hole.  I have always
made sure that my frames have a drain hole.  As the Campy Bottom
Bracket instructions say, &quot;Make sure that there is a hole for water
drainage underneath the bottom bracket cage.  If there is no such
hole, do not simply create one.  Campagnolo s.r.l. recommends
contacting the frame manufacturer for further information and
clarification in this regard.&quot;  A few years ago after an especially
wet &quot;Assault on Mount Mitchell&quot; ride my LBS mechanic remarked that if
the riders didn't  disassemble and clean their bikes that he would
have lots of business with bottom brackets and wheels.
Happy Trucking!

My new LHT will have all sealed bearings and fenders year round plus
I'll spray the goop inside and then not worry about it. Personally I
don't think it should matter at all if a centrally located round drain
hole is drilled in any bottom bracket shell as most these days already
have a hole for a rivet for the cable guide.  I suppose a threaded
bolt with a hole drilled through could be substituted for the cable
guide rivet. Perhaps an additional small diameter bolt could be
threaded into that to seal things up until drainage operations are
performed. I'm working on the idea and will make a test bolt to see if
its possible.
