Thy glasse will shew thee how thy beauties were,
Thy dyall how thy pretious mynuits waste,
The vacant leaues thy mindes imprint will beare,
And of this booke,this learning maist thou taste.
The wrinckles which thy glasse will truly show,
Of mouthed graues will giue thee memorie,
Thou by thy dyals shady stealth maist know,
Times theeuish progresse to eternitie.
Looke what thy memorie cannot containe,
Commit to these waste blacks,and thou shalt finde
Those children nurst,deliuerd from thy braine,
To take a new acquaintance of thy minde.
These offices,so oft as thou wilt looke,
Shall profit thee,and much inrich thy booke.

Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,
The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste:
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
Time's thievish progress to eternity.
Look what thy memory cannot contain
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.

Does this poem accompany the gift of a blank notebook? I
find that conclusion inescapable. Katherine Duncan-Jones
goes through hoops to avoid it, claiming that &quot;the speaker's
capacity for self-denigration may extend to the description
of pages with his own sonnets on them as _vacant_.&quot; Twice in
one poem (lines 3 and 10) I fail to believe that. She agrees
that &quot;the youth is to be instructed by his own writings, not
the poet's.&quot;

Compare 'thy glass', 'thy dial' with 'this book' (line 4)
which by the end of the poem has become 'thy book'. 'This
book' is offered (that is the speech-act of the poem) and by
line 14 it has been accepted, or its acceptance can be
assumed. A book for writing in is a very appropriate (even
flattering) gift for a writer to give.

Line 1. The last word could be either 'were' or 'wear':
neither the Quarto's spelling nor 16th century pronunciation
decides the point. But a mirror shows how things are (at the
speed of light) and not how they were at some time in the
past. (Compare line 5.) 'Wear' and 'waste' make an example
of Shakespeare's variation: two different words with the
same effect, connected by alliteration.

Line 2. The commentators think the dial must be portable,
even if it is a sun-dial. The mirror would not be portable,
would it? So though I have followed them, I wonder if this
is not a fixed sun-dial in the grounds of the addressee's
house - though one would not know that until line 7.

Line 9, 'look what'. Booth comments on 9.9: &quot;The use of
look-plus-pronoun or adverb to make an indefinite relative
appears to have been reasonably common in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries; see OED, 4b. However, this and
Shakespeare's three other uses of the construction in the
sonnets [11.11, 37.13, and 77.9] all occur in contexts of
eyes, looking and appearance and thus have logically
incidental extra pertinence and resonance in the poems where
they appear.&quot;

Line 10, 'these waste blanks'. The Quarto prints 'blacks'.
But it is clear enough there is no black on these pages, and
if there were, why should it be plural? If the word had been
written with a twiddle over the A to indicate that it must
be followed by an N, such a thing could easily be missed in
copying and still more in printing. The printer's font does
not seem to have included such a sign.

'Thou shalt find'. This is the language of an experienced
person. Is it going too far to suggest that Shakespeare is
drawing on his own experience as a writer? Has he found
that, when he comes back to his own notes, they take on an
extra meaning that he had not appreciated before?

Line 13, 'offices'. 'Duty' is really too solemn. This is not
the stern daughter of the voice of God. It is not even so
solemn as Cicero, On Duty (de Officiis), known in
Shakespeare's day as &quot;Tully's Offices&quot;. It is the
acquisition of a regular habit for one's own benefit.

Lynne's 'idea' is silly -- an off-the-cuff
remark with zero thought. Agreed, that
puts it on about the same level as most
commentaries on the sonnets, but it's not
worth discussion. Her 'sense' cannot
be linked to the adjective 'precious'.

The poet commonly plays on 'minute' in
OED senses 4 and 5: 'Something small'.
(I don't think that the particular spelling
-- 'mynuit' -- here is important.)

4. A coin of trifling value; a 'mite'. Obsolete.
1589 J. Rider Bibl. Schol., A Minute or Q, which is halfe a farthing, minutum.
5. Something minute or small. Obsolete
1598 Florio, Pesciolini, all manner of minutes, frye, or small fishes.
1626 B. Jonson Staple of N. i. v. 138
Let me heare from thee euery minute of Newes.

In each case (including this one) the poet
is referring to courtiers, especially those
of low-class origin and, in particular,
Raleigh.

Sonnet 14
1. Not from the stars do I my judgement plucke,
2. And yet me thinkes I have Astronomy,
3. But not to tell of good, or evil lucke,
4. Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons quallity,
5. Nor can I fortune to breefe mynuits tell;
6. Pointing to each his thunder, raine and winde,

Sonnet 126
5. If Nature (soveraine misteres over wrack)
6. As thou goest onwards still will plucke thee backe,
7. She keepes thee to this purpose, that her skill.
8. May time disgrace, and wretched mynuit kill.

Sonnet 60
1. Like as the waves make towards the pibled shore,
2. So do our minuites hasten to their end,
3. Each changing place with that which goes before,
4. In sequent toile all forwards do contend.

Sonnet 77
1. Thy glasse will shew thee how thy beauties were,
2. Thy dyall how thy pretious mynuits waste,

Interestingly, 'precious' has retained the
same duality of meaning from Chaucer
and Lydgate to today.

'Precious' (OED)
3. Aiming at or affecting distinction or choiceness in conduct,
manners, language, etc.; fastidious, 'particular'; esp. in mod. use
(after F. précieux: cf. précieuse), affecting, displaying, or using
careful and fastidious delicacy or refinement in language,
workmanship, etc.; often with an implication of being over-nice
or over-refined.
4. colloq. a. As an intensive of something bad, worthless, or
reprobated: Egregious, out-and-out, arrant; in some uses, a mere
emotional intensive. (Cf. fine a. 14b.)
b. Ironically, Of little worth, worthless, good-for-nothing. (Cf. fine a. 12c.)

Hello all,

Could it have been written for a friendship book? At
an article on Dowland mentions
contemporary friendship books. Dowland contributed a brief entry to
the liber amicorum of a Prussian visitor called Hans von Bodeck, but
more interestingly (to me), the article goes on to quote the following
verses Thomas Campion wrote for the same book:

&quot;Thy fair youth fram'd for delight,
Fitt to slepe in bedds of flowers,
To thy thirstye watchful spright
Stricktly measures all thine howres;
And thy ages steward playes
To enrich thy elder dayes.

Fruitful to thy native soile,
Joyful to thy home-borne frends,
Through the peril, and the toyle,
Which both sea and land attends,
Mayst thou safe arrived be,
Myndful of thy love and me.&quot;

Does this sound a little like the sentiments in sonnet 77? I mean
insofar as there's an implication that compiling this book will be of
long-term benefit to the possessor, though of course in the sonnet
there's no mention of a journey. And it does sound as if Shakespeare
expects the book's owner to be the one writing in it, rather than
anyone else.

I just wrote a reply, but lost it. So I'll write a shorter one.

People burn oil of course, but to suggest that the addressee is wasting
his midnights and can see that by looking at his dial (could this also
refer to his own face?) suggests, when taking into account other sexual
and sometimes masturbatory lines in earlier sonnets, that he's a bit
dissipated.

Please. Time and Age use a knife to carve the signs of age
on people's faces, or to cut the memory of those faces from
people's hearts. The glass and the dial show the unremitting
progress *towards* death. Death and Time use a scythe or a

Mortality is implement-free.

Why? Is there the slightest suggestion either here (or any-

knives?

You've forgotten my discovery as regards line 10.
(You probably found it 'too Oxfordian&quot;)

10. Against confoundin' gages cruell knife,

I saw the play in line 3 on 'times' = 'mites'
where it outdoubtedly refers to Raleigh
('injurious hand' is confirmation). I did not
remark on the same play in line 9, where
it would apply to his new-born infant son
(about whom the sonnet is written).

---------------- A re-post: ----------------

The poet needs to be armed against immediate
threats to his life. Anne Vavasour's Howard
relatives became extremely angry when they
learnt of her pregnancy (as did the Queen) and
Oxford had been physically threatened. He fears
their 'knife', with a particular bearing on that of
Sir Thomas Knyvett, a privy councillor -- and a
relation of Anne Vavasour) -- who later did, in
fact, dangerously wound Oxford, in a fight in
1583. Further, his name derives from 'knife',
and the Knyvett escutcheon bears an emblem
of three knives. (&quot;Azure, three knives argent,
hafted gules.&quot;)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 10. Against confounding Ages cruel knife,

"/>

'Confounding' was a much stronger word
around 1600, meaning 'destroying'. The poet
is playing on:

'confounding Ages' = 'confoundin gages'

This refers to a 'gage' or a 'challenge' addressed
to him by Thomas Vavasour. The author did not
date it, and in Burghley's files some unknown
archivist has written '19 January 1585' which is
IMO almost certainly wrong, as it belongs to
this period. It is endorsed 'A lewd letter from
Vavasor to the Earl of Oxford':

Paul.

No, Lynne. Sonnet 63 is saying that whereas with these black

cuts from memory his sweet love's beauty, he cannot fortify
himself against Age (not the knife) cutting off his lover's
life. The tool Age uses for this job is not specified.

He is fortifying himself against confounding Age's cruel
knife. Is he fortifying himself against what Age will do
to his lover's *life*? No, he quite clearly isn't. What
do you think the words &quot;though my lover's life&quot; mean? It
is something he is *not* able to fortify himself against.

cruel knife, this *cannot* be the implement that Age will

It says that &quot;he&quot; shall never &quot;cut from memory / My sweet

Just some free-association here: *How* is he fortifying himself against
Age's cruel knife? By writing poetry? Isn't that a bit ineffective
(to say the least)? Age's cruel knife is going to keep on scything no
matter how much poetry he writes (I can't remember the discussion over
whether this is a scythe or not). The world could fill up with his
poetry and Age's cruel knife will still be scything. Maybe the paper
will stop the blade. Age himself is not going to read the poem and
decide to stop using the knife, and nothing he instructs his readers
about concerning Age and the knife will help the readers stop Age
either.

Again free-associating: I think it's kind of funny that HLAS
participants keep coming back over and over again to this really rather
boring question of the knife.

Sure. You are right. 'Age' does not go
around with a knife killing people with
violence. It does it slowly; but even if
it sometimes does the job unpleasantly,
knives have no place in its operations.

So we have to ask why does the poet use
such a strange phrase? One _might_ say
that he's implying that THIS confounding
Age tends to employ a lot of knives (as
someone might say the age of the 20th
century employed a lot of guns). But
that is pushing the interpretation a bit
too far, and it could only be present as a
relatively minor meaning.

I have put in my own contribution -- to
the usual zero response -- which provides
a fairly complete explanation.

While not answering for Lynne (I would
not dare!) it is likely that a 'confounding
age' will be full of cowardly knife-wielding
assassins (or wretches). We know that
the Elizabethan one was, and that the poet
regarded it as 'confounding'.

No, it's good for the beauty in memory, though it does not
apply to the life. So the addressee will die, but his beauty
will live on because it is made famous in poetry. That last
has been a big theme in the sonnets from 18 on:
&quot;So long as men can breathe or eyes shall see
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.&quot;

&gt;decide to stop using the knife, and nothing he instructs his readers
&gt;about concerning Age and the knife will help the readers stop Age
&gt;either.

&gt;Again free-associating: I think it's kind of funny that HLAS
&gt;participants keep coming back over and over again to this really rather
&gt;boring question of the knife.
...
&gt;&gt;Is he fortifying himself against what Age will do
&gt;&gt; to his lover's *life*? No, he quite clearly isn't. What
&gt;&gt; do you think the words &quot;though my lover's life&quot; mean? It
&gt;&gt; is something he is *not* able to fortify himself against.
&gt;&gt; And since he *is* able to fortify himself against Age's
&gt;&gt; cruel knife, this *cannot* be the implement that Age will
&gt;&gt; use to kill him.

"/>

In one respect he can build a fortification. He can preserve
fame in poetry although (in the other respect) poetry cannot
preserve the literal life. Age's knife can destroy the
literal life, but it cannot destroy the fame that lives on
with the poet's aid. Is there a problem?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It says that &quot;he&quot; shall never &quot;cut from memory / My sweet

&gt;&gt; knife) &quot;shall never shall neuer cut from memory / My sweet
&gt;&gt; loues beauty, though my louers life&quot;.

Age's knife can handle the one task but not the other.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; there the slightest suggestion that Age or Time were ever

&gt;&gt;&gt; murdered, except by &quot;Age&quot; and &quot;Death.&quot;

&gt;&gt; And how does his calling Age &quot;a wretch&quot; fit in with any
&gt;&gt; other occasion that Shakespeare has used that word? That

Well, a fortification holds things in and other things out, and makes

Shakespeare has an answer to this question. Primarily, he seems to be

However, he says very nearly nothing that could specify what those

suppose him to believe what a man similar to him today would be
supposed to believe, and I can only suppose, then, that he's talking
about the eternal life promised to Christians after death. But he

A fortification could be two-way, but in practice
fortifications are carefully designed to be defended from
one side and attacked from the other. (I am not precise
about which side because of the possibility of lines of
circumvallation.) So a fireproof door generally has a bolt
that is impenetrable from the outside but easily opened with
a crash-bar from the inside.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;How does poetry accomplish something similar? I don't think
&gt;Shakespeare has an answer to this question.

"/>

Why not? This comes as near as anything Shakepseare says to
a commonplace. People die in seventy years (or a little
more) but writing on paper can go on for ever, in successive
copies. The everlasting nature of fragile paper, versus the
lasting qualities of solid flesh, makes a paradox well known
before Shakespeare.

"/>

1. Reading the Sonnets (three times over ten years) I am
convinced that Shakespeare had a good deal of classical
knowledge, but deliberately avoided writing classically
influenced poetry. The contrast with Sidney (in particular)
is marked. Every week, Sidney forces me to go to the Oxford
Classical Dictionary and Graves's Greek Myths. Shakespeare,
hardly ever.
2. On the other hand, his writing is strongly influenced by
the Prayer Book. There is a common assumption nowadays that
he was a crypto Papist. Sonnet 52 is enough to reduce that
assumption to rubble. On the other hand, he was not a
particulary religious man. He uses imagery from religion,
but really devout thought is extremely rare, rare enough to
be always conventional. He is no George Herbert. Try Herbert
to prove it!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;However, he says very nearly nothing that could specify what those

descendants.

Exactly. That is why frail paper outlasts solid flesh. But
this poem isn't about blasphemy, or competing to outdo some
other technique in blasphemy. It is not blasphemous to say
that someone's name lives on. Why should it be? There is a
Naval toast to 'The Immortal Memory'.

It's a question of whether or not Sonnet 63 does, as is claimed,
offer support for the idea that Sonnet 74's &quot;Coward conquest of
a wretch's knife&quot; could possibly be referring to Death/Time/
Age/Mortality etc. This is considered important because, if it
doesn't (and if no other support can be found) then it is hard
to make sense of that line unless it was written by Marlowe.

Much too facile and too shallow. Why is
such poetry not in the nature of every
person? Or every 10th person? Or every
10 millionth person? Even if it was the

Nope. Quite wrong. When Lynne first appeared

Lynne Kositsky wrote

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now, to take it one step further, why would he need to
&gt; tell the Queen that he was going to make her famous?
&gt; She already was.

Lynne's point here will ring true with
Stratfordians.

It provides the basis of an excellent test for
the two theories of the sonnets:
(a) 'Fair Youth', and
(b) 'Queen Elizabeth'.

IF the Fair Youth theory is true then the
sonnets will unquestionably show what
Lynne and Stratfordians think that they
show -- promises of fame and immortality
which the Fair Youth would not otherwise
get -- and that's the end of the 'Queen
Elizabeth' theory.

But IF the poet is always careful in his
wording (in each sonnet) to avoid making
that most obvious of implications then
the opposite applies.

The 'Fair Youth' theory is at an end.
The Queen Elizabeth one prevails.

OK?

Does anyone have any problems
with that?

Lines 11-12 read:
That he shall never cut from memory
My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.

The last four words do not include a verb and so one has to
be supplied (together with a subject for that verb). No
problem: we supply 'He shall cut' from the previous line,
without the 'never' because the adversative conjunction
'though' negatives it. That gives:
That he shall never cut from memory
My sweet love's beauty, though [he shall cut] my lover's
life.

Is there any doubt about that? It will be hard to find
another verb plausibly, when there is one given in the
previous line, in the previous part of the same sentence.

Then, if the first (unsuccessful) cutting is done with Age's
knife (and if it is not, then Age's knife is a mere
irrelevance that should not have been brought in at all) is
it at all plausible to say the second (successful) one is
done with something completely different?

If there was a second explicit 'he shall cut', it might be
possible to argue that the two cuts were separated. But when
the second verb is understood from the first, doesn't it
make that hard to maintain?

&gt; Lines 11-12 read:
&gt; That he shall never cut from memory
&gt; My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.

"/>

Indeed they do. They do not read:
That *it* shall never cut from memory
My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.
which would certainly have destroyed my case!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The last four words do not include a verb and so one has to
&gt; be supplied (together with a subject for that verb). No
&gt; problem: we supply 'He shall cut' from the previous line,
&gt; without the 'never' because the adversative conjunction
&gt; 'though' negatives it. That gives:
&gt; That he shall never cut from memory
&gt; My sweet love's beauty, though [he shall cut] my lover's
&gt; life.

&gt; Is there any doubt about that? It will be hard to find
&gt; another verb plausibly, when there is one given in the
&gt; previous line, in the previous part of the same sentence.

"/>

No, I'm right there with you so far.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then, if the first (unsuccessful) cutting is done with
&gt; Age's knife

"/>

It is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (and if it is not, then Age's knife is a mere irrelevance
&gt; that should not have been brought in at all) is it at all
&gt; plausible to say the second (successful) one is done with
&gt; something completely different?

"/>

Certainly it is. We are at liberty to decide whether it is
the aforementioned knife, a scythe as usual, or even nothing
in particular (like being 'cut down in one's prime') which
has lost any real association with the original implement.

For me, however, the point is that in this case he *is* able
to fortify against the cruel knife. Therefore he can prevent
whatever it is that the knife would have done. But as this
does not include polishing off his lover, he is unable to
prevent that happening.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If there was a second explicit 'he shall cut', it might be
&gt; possible to argue that the two cuts were separated. But when
&gt; the second verb is understood from the first, doesn't it
&gt; make that hard to maintain?

"/>

I don't think so. But in any case this far from being clear
enough for it to provide the sure example of the use of a knife
by Death/Time/Age/Mortality that would justify the assumption
that this is what &quot;The coward conquest of a wretch's knife&quot;
refers to. Is there really no better one that can be found?

Not really. Such people are famous in their own day, but if
they die unrecorded, their fame dies with them.

That is a different problem, one no theory has yet solved,

So what have we learned from Sonnet 77 that we didn't already
know?

The addressee has been given a blank book in which to record
his thoughts. The book is possibly from the speaker.

One word description of the poem: Book.

Sonnet sub-group: ?

***************************************************

The story so far:

So after seventy-seven sonnets, what do we know?

The addressee or referent of the first seventy-seven
sonnets is probably the same person (although it has been
speculated that perhaps the speaker of the first seventeen
poems is different). At any rate, we are assuming that the
same person is the addressee of these sonnets.

We still don't know what the relationship is between
the speaker and the addressee. It is clearly an intense,
emotional relationship. Whether it is sexual is uncertain.

The speaker says the addressee is physically
attractive. The description of that beauty is in terms that
would seem more suitable to a woman than a man. (1 - 7, 9,
13, 17-19, especially 20, 41, 54)

The speaker says that the addressee is narcissistic.
(1 - 4, 6)

The speaker may be chiding the addressee's sexual
habits. (1 - 4, 6, 9, 40 - 42, 58, 61, 69)

The speaker suggests that, while they may acknowledge the
addressee's physical good looks, some unnamed others have a critical
opinion of some aspect of the addressee's character, morals and/or
behaviour. (69) However, the speaker defends the addressee against
this criticism/slander (70).

The addressee is male. (3, 9, 16, 19-20, 26, 33,
39, 41, 63, 67 - 68)

The speaker is male. (20, 32)

The addressee is of marriageable age, meaning (I
think) that he would be in the 17 - 26 age range. (1 - 4, 6,
8 - 13, 16, 17)

The speaker is older than the addressee. (62 - 63)

The speaker is old. (73)

The speaker claims he has no interest in sexual
relations with the addressee. (20)

The addressee is sexually interested in women. (41)

The speaker is sexually interested in women. (41)

Women are sexually attracted to the addressee. (3, 16, 20,
41,)

The speaker has a wife or mistress. (40 - 42).

A snag appears in the relationship between the
speaker and addressee. (33, 34)

The snag that appeared in the relationship between
the speaker and addressee seems to concern something that
the addressee did to the speaker which caused the speaker
shame. The addressee, however, is contrite, and the speaker
has forgiven him. (34)

While it's not certain, the snag that appeared in
the relationship between the speaker and the addressee
probably concerns a love stolen from the speaker by the
addressee. (35)

It seems that the addressee *has* stolen a lover
from the speaker (40 - 42), but the speaker forgives him.
(40, 42)

The speaker expresses concern that he might lose the
affections/attention of the addressee. (48)

The speaker has a very humble opinion of himself, and is
prepared to excuse almost any behaviour of the addressee (35, 49,
57-58).

It's still uncertain what class the speaker and addressee
belong to. Some have argued that Sonnet 25 indicates that the speaker
is not a member of the nobility, while others argue that it indicates
that he is a member of the nobility. Some readers have also suggested
that certain words and phrases used in the sonnets indicate that the
addressee is of noble birth. (37, 40)

The speaker's life involved travel that took him
away from the addressee. Possibly, the travel involved
service for the addressee. (27 - 28, 39, 43 - 45, 47, 50 - 51, 61)

By the time of Sonnet 52, whenever it is, the speaker
doesn't seem to be seeing the addressee very often. (52).

Note that we still don't know where the speaker or
the addressee live.

There seems to have been a lull in the speaker/addressee's
emotional relationship. (56)

The speaker has a picture of the addressee which he enjoys
looking at. (47)

The speaker is preoccupied at night by images of the
addressee. (27 - 28, 43, 61)

The poet says he is in disgrace for some reason, and
that he is a self-described outcast of some sort, and that
he feels sorry for himself and envious of others, a feeling
that is dispelled when he thinks of his relationship with
the addressee. (29)

For some reason, the speaker thinks that the
addressee will be dishonoured by publicly associating with
the speaker. (36, 71 - 72)

The speaker tells us that his sad memories are
dispelled when he thinks of the addressee. (30)

The speaker's feelings for the addressee are so strong that
they leave the speaker tongue-tied about those feelings in the
presence of the addressee. (23)

The speaker expresses humility about his ability to
express, in writing, his feelings for the addressee. (26,
32)

The speaker says that he is poor, despised and,
possibly, physically disabled. (37)

The speaker distinguishes himself from &quot;the rich&quot;. (52)

However, while the speaker says he is poor in Sonnet 37, he
then says, in Sonnet 48, that he owns jewels. (48)

The speaker so identifies with the addressee, that
any and all of the speaker's faults and shortcomings are
resolved in the positive attributes of the addressee. (37, 62)

The speaker says he sees, in the addressee, the
embodiment of former deceased loves. (31)

The speaker says all good things are but shadows of the
addressee. (53)

The speaker says the addressee has a pleasant
speaking voice and enjoys listening to sad music. (8)

The speaker says the addressee has a gracious and
kind presence. (10)

The speaker seems to think that the addressee has
some sort of love for the speaker. (10, 25, 34, 36, 39, 41, 61, 73)

The speaker seems to have some sort of affectionate
feelings for the addressee, calling him such things as
&quot;love&quot;, &quot;dear my love&quot;, &quot;master-mistress of my passion&quot;, &quot;Lord of my
love&quot;&amp;&quot;sweet love&quot;. (13, 19, 20-33, 40, 54, 57-58, 66, 76)

The speaker seems to have believed in a religious theory of
the resurrection of the dead. (55)

The speaker is an aesthetic snob. (11)

The speaker may believe in astrology. (15)

The speaker rides a horse. (50 - 51)

The speaker, at least at times, was disillusioned with his
world. (66 - 68)

The addressee has been given a blank book in which to record
his thoughts. The book is possibly from the speaker. (77)

The speaker initially thinks that having children is
a better method than a painting or a poem for the addressee
to preserve himself. (16, 17) However, the speaker comes to
say that he can preserve the beauty of the addressee in his
poetry (18 - 19, 54 -55, 60, 63 - 65).

The speaker believes he can preserve the best part of himself
in his writings. (74)

The speaker, having posed a problem for the
addressee, is offering a solution to that problem - namely
that the addressee should have children - specifically, a
son. (1-14, 16, 17). (But let's remember that it's only the
speaker's assertion that beautiful people have some sort of
obligation to the world to propagate or preserve their
beauty.)

While seeming to chastise the addressee for his
narcissistic failure to preserve or propagate his beauty,
the speaker is, at the same time, acknowledging that beauty,
and so is flattering the addressee.

Sonnet groupings (a tentative listing of the sonnets
read so far and how they might be grouped):

Get married, young man: 1 - 14, 16 - 17.

Forever young: 15, 18 - 19, 54 - 55, 60, 63 - 65.

You are so beautiful: 20 - 21, 53, 59.

We two are one: 22, 25, 37, 39, 62, 73 - 74.

Words fail me: 23, 26, 32.

You're in my heart: 24, 46 - 48.

Dreamin' of you: 27 - 28, 43, 61.

Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you: 29 - 30, 44 - 45, 50 - 52, 75 - 76.

You done me wrong: 33 - 34, 40 - 42.

Anything you do is alright with me: 35, 42, 49, 57 - 58.

I am unworthy: 36, 71 - 72.

You're my soul and inspiration: 38.

What's a nice person like you doin' in a place like this?: 66 - 70.

? - 31, 56, 77.

The idea that 'I fortify against Age's knife' is qualified

stop him killing the life.

The reason I cannot stop him killing the life has nothing to
do with his weapon's being a knife or any other particular
one. It is just that, life being what it is, it cannot be

what kind of thing is attacking it.

&gt; I have never understood this point of view. It's like asking why every

A particularly poor example. Some people
do reach exceptional heights, and there are
reasons. Often it's a defect in the mechanism
controlling the growth hormone. Sometimes
it's a chromosomal defect -- as in Lincoln's

Only a near-total idiot would suggest that
poetry-creation comes (even largely) from
genes. If it was true, then Eton School and

She does not have to be in everything.
Romeo (the hero = the author) mentions
his 'Rosaline' early on. That person is

You've not been paying attention to recent

&gt;&gt; this special eminence?

Yes they can. I've just done it. (So has Bob Grumman.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;When

What we might bother to ask has nothing to do with whether
two questions are the same question or not. These two are
not.

Additionally, there are not just two kinds of poet,
Shakespeare and weak. There are poets in between who
reasonably expect us to take an interest:
&quot;Why did I write? What sin, to me unknown,
Dipped me in ink, my parents' or my own?
As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame
I lisped in numbers, for the numbers came.&quot;

&gt;That is not a theory which works.
&gt;The coy attitude to the identity of the

The sonnets are not 'coy'.

I agree that the addressee's name does not appear anywhere
in the book, or if you prefer it that way, ANYWHERE!!!

But poems that did not actually contain a name could still
be tied in by an explicit dedication. On the other hand,
maybe at one time some of the poems did contain a name and
it has been edited out by the poet: a little crafty
rewriting could do it. Not that I claim to know.

It's perfectly sensible to ask 'Why did X write?' and to ask
