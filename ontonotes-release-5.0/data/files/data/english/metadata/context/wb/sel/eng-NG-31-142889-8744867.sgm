Pre-Existence by Ogden Kraut
Chapter 2

SCRIPTURAL REVIEW

The best scriptural review ever written on the subject of pre-existence was
first published by the Apostle Orson Pratt in 1853 in The Seer. His rather
lengthy, but thorough, presentation is so reasonable and clear that it
should leave no doubts on the Biblical support of that doctrine. This
chapter contains extensive excerpts from Elder Pratt's treatise.

The Pre-Existence of Man (Excerpts)
by Apostle Orson Pratt as published in THE SEER.

Life and intelligence are not the result of organization, but they are the
cause; and, therefore, they must exist before the effects can follow. Our
bodies are formed from the dust of the death, but are our spirits made from
the same materials? If they were, then they would, at death, return to dust;
but as they are not reduced to dust, like the body, they must be formed of
materials far superior to those of the earth. Where did those materials come
from? They came from God. Solomon, when speaking upon the subject of death,
says, &quot;Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit
shall RETURN unto God who gave it.&quot; (Eccles. 12:7) According to this
passage, the spirit has, not an earthly origin, but a heavenly one: it came
from God--it returns to God. &quot;God who gave it,&quot; also receives it back into
His presence.

[6] Could the spirit return to God, if it never were in His presence? Could
we return to a place where we never were before? If, then, the spirits of
men existed with God, and came from Him to animate mortal bodies, they must
either be created in Heaven at the time the infant tabernacles are being
formed, or else they existed before.

Inasmuch as Scripture informs us that the spirit of man existed with God,
and came from Him, and returns to Him, it is reasonable to believe that its
formation took place at a period anterior to the organization of the body.
This period of pre-existence must have been sufficiently long to have
educated and instructed the spirit in the laws and order of government,
pertaining to the spiritual world; to have rendered itself approved or
disapproved by those laws; to have been tried in all points, according to
its capacities and knowledge, and the free agency which always accompanies
and forms a part of the nature of intelligent beings; in fine, the period of
pre-existence must have been sufficiently long to have constituted a
probationary state, or the &quot;First Estate&quot; wherein the spirits are on trial,
and may fall, and be reserved in chains of darkness unto the judgment of the
great day.

The pre-existence of man is a doctrine which was believed by the ancients.
The disciples of Jesus, when observing a man who had been blind from his
birth, put the following question to their Master: &quot;Who did sin, this man,
or his parents, that he was born blind?&quot; (John 9:2) It is evident, from the
nature of this question, that the disciples considered it possible for a man
to sin before he was born; and that in consequence of such sin, he might be
&quot;born blind&quot;. This passage shows most clearly, that the disciples, not only
believed in the pre-existence of man, but believed that he was an
intelligent agent, governed by laws which he was capable of obeying or
disobeying, and that his sins in his former state might be the cause of his
being born blind, and that his condition in his present state was affected
by his acts in the former state. The Saviour, in replying to this question,
says, &quot;Neither hath [7] this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works
of God should be made manifest in him.&quot; (verse 3) Now, if the pre-existence
of man were not a true doctrine, why did not our Saviour take this
opportunity to correct the ideas of his disciples, by telling them that the
blind man could not sin before he was born? Why did he merely tell them that
his blindness was not the effects of the sins of himself or parents? Why did
he still leave the impression upon their minds that the blind man had a
pre-existence?

Jesus, himself, believed in pre-existence: for he said, &quot;I proceeded forth
and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.&quot; And, again, he
said, &quot;Before Abraham was, I am.&quot; (John 8:42, 58) Jesus prays thus: &quot;And
now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I
had with thee before the world was.&quot; (John 17:5) From these sayings, we
perceive that the spiritual body of Jesus existed &quot;before the world was.&quot;

Having proved that the pre-existence of man is reasonable and scriptural,
we shall next prove that this pre-existence can be traced back to a period
before the foundation of the world. The Lord asked a question of Job in
relation to this matter: He inquires, &quot;Where wast thou when I laid the
foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who laid the
corner stone thereof, when the morning stars sang together, and all the Sons
of God shouted for joy?&quot; (Job 38:4, 6, 7) If Job had no prior existence, he
could have easily answered the Lord's first question. He could have replied,
that, when &quot;the foundations of the earth&quot; were laid, I, Job, did not exist.
The very question implies that Job was in existence at the time of the
organization of the globe, but that he had not sufficient understanding, as
to the place where he existed, to correctly answer the question put to him.
Neither could he remember, &quot;Who laid the corner stone thereof;&quot; neither
could he recollect, the song of the morning stars; neither could he call to
mind, the shout of joy which was uttered by the vast assembly of &quot;ALL, THE
SONS OF GOD.

[8] Jesus calls himself, &quot;The bright and morning star.&quot; (Rev. 22:15) And in
another place, He represents Himself, &quot;The Beginning of the Creation of
God.&quot; (Rev. 3:14) Paul says, that Jesus &quot;is the image of the invisible
God--the FIRST BORN of every creature.&quot; (Col. 1:15) As Jesus is the First
Born Son of God, it is evident, that all the other sons of God would be His
younger brethren, begotten by the same Father. Therefore Paul represents him
as &quot;the First Born among many brethren.&quot; (Romans 8:29) And in another place,
he says, &quot;Both He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified, are all of
One: for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren.&quot; (Heb. 2:11)
That the brethren, here spoken of, are the sons of God, begotten by the same
Father that Jesus was, is evident from another saying of the Apostle, &quot;We
have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them
reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the FATHER OF
SPIRITS, and live?&quot; (Heb. 12:9) Our earthly fathers are called, the &quot;fathers
of our flesh,&quot; while God is called, &quot;The Father of Spirits.&quot; Earthly fathers
have no power to beget spirits; they beget only the bodies of flesh, or the
tabernacles; while our Heavenly Father begets the spirits, or the living
beings which come from Him to inhabit the tabernacles.

&quot;The First Born&quot; of all this great family of Spirits, holds, by virtue of
His birthright, a pre-eminence in all things; hence it is written, &quot;When he
bringeth in the First Begotten into the world, He saith, And let all the
angels of God worship Him.&quot; (Heb. 1:6) The oldest spirits or the First
Begotten hold the keys of Salvation towards all the rest of the family of
spirits. &quot;The First Born&quot; Spirit is called &quot;the Morning Star,&quot; because He
was born in the morning of Creation, or in other words, because He was &quot;The
Beginning of the Creation of God.&quot; His younger brethren were called &quot;morning
stars,&quot; because they were also born in the morning of creation, being the
next in succession in the order of the spiritual creation.

[9] Objections have been raised against the preexistence of man upon the
ground that we do not remember such existence, or any event connected
therewith. It is true, we do not remember anything prior to our present
state, but this does not prove that we had no prior existence. We do not
remember our existence or anything else, during the first six months of our
infancy; does this prove that we did not exist during that time? No. If,
then, we could exist six months, during our present state without
remembering it, we might, for the same reason, have existed during six
thousand years prior to our present state, and not remember it. Existence is
in no way dependant on memory; therefore, memory has nothing to do with the
question of our past state.

When Jesus was born into our world, his previous knowledge was taken from
Him: this was occasioned by His spiritual body being compressed into a
smaller volume than it originally occupied. In His previous existence, His
spirit, as the Scriptures testify, was of the size and form of man; when
this spirit was compressed, so as to be wholly enclosed in an infant
tabernacle, it had a tendency to suspend the memory; and the wisdom and
knowledge, formerly enjoyed, were forgotten. &quot;In His humiliation, His
judgment was taken away.&quot; (Acts 8:33) To come down from heaven, from His
Father's presence, where He had formerly possessed judgment and
understanding sufficient to frame worlds, and to enter into a mortal
tabernacle, was truly humiliating. It was, indeed, humiliating in the
highest degree, to be deprived of so great a knowledge. Yet he humbled
Himself, and condescended to descend below all things, and to commence anew
at the very elements of knowledge: hence, one of the evangelists says,
&quot;Jesus increased in wisdom and stature.&quot; (Luke 2:52) Now if Jesus had
retained His wisdom when He was born into this world, it would not have been
said of Him that He &quot;increased in wisdom.&quot; If the knowledge which Jesus
possessed in His previous state, were taken from Him, when He entered an
infant tabernacle, He could never regain that knowledge only by revelation.
So it is with man. When he enters a [10] body of flesh, his spirit is so
compressed and contracted in infancy that he forgets his former existence,
and has to commence, as Jesus did, at the lowest principles of knowledge,
and ascend by degrees from one principle of intelligence to another. Thus he
regains his former knowledge; and by showing himself approved through every
degree of intelligence, he is counted worthy to receive more and more, until
he is perfected and glorified in truth, and made like his elder brother,
possessing all things.

If the spiritual body of Jesus, and the spiritual bodies of all men,
existed before the foundation of the world, as we have clearly shown, is
there anything unreasonable in the idea of the pre-existence of the
spiritual bodies of all the animal creation? There is not. One class of
spirits may exist before they enter their natural bodies, as well as
another. Did not the same God who made the spirits of men, make the spirits
of beasts also? Job says, &quot;Ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;
and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee; or speak to the earth,
and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
Who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this?
IN WHOSE HAND IS THE SOUL OF EVERY LIVING THING.&quot; (Job 12: 7-10) in this
quotation, we perceive that &quot;the soul of every living thing&quot; is in the hand
of the Lord: He is the Maker and Preserver of the souls of beasts, birds,
and fishes, as well as of the souls of men: hence, Moses, when praying to
the Lord, says: &quot;Let the Lord, THE GOD OF THE SPIRITS OF ALL FLESH, set a
man over the congregation.&quot; (Num. 27:16) Thus we see that the Lord is, not
only the God of the spirits of men, but He is &quot;the God of the spirits of all
flesh.&quot;

That the spirits of all the vegetables and animals were made before their
bodies is evident from the history of creation as related in the first and
second chapters of Genesis. In the first chapter, we have the history of the
creation of vegetables, fish, fowls, beasts, and man. In the second chapter,
we are told that on the seventh day [11] &quot;there was not a man to till the
ground;&quot; and then a description is given of the formation of his natural
body &quot;out of the ground.&quot; In the first chapter, and during the third day,
the vegetables and trees are formed; in the second chapter, and on the
seventh day, we are told that the Lord &quot;made every plant of the field before
it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew;&quot; and then
we are informed that on the seventh day the Lord planted a garden, that is,
set out the trees and herbs which he had made on the third day, and caused
them to &quot;grow out of the ground.&quot; In the first chapter, it is said, that the
fish, fowls, and beasts, were created on the fifth and sixth days; in the
second chapter, these various animals are formed &quot;out of the ground&quot; on the
seventh day, and &quot;brought unto Adam to see what he would call them.&quot; From
this we learn, that the natural bodies of animals were made after the
natural body of man. In the work of the temporal creation man seems to have
been the first flesh upon the earth, his natural body being made even before
the herbs and trees were planted and grew out of the ground. He was placed
in the garden of Eden, before the Lord made the beasts and fowls, that is,
their natural bodies, and brought them to him in order that he might name
them. The first chapter gives a history of the creation of all things
spiritual; the second chapter gives the history of the creation of all
things temporal. In the order of time, and in the succession of events, the
spiritual creation of the Heavens, and earth, and all things contained
therein,--differs from the temporal creation of the same. To suppose that
these two chapters only give the history of the natural creation, would
involve us in numerous difficulties, when we endeavor to reconcile the
description given in the second chapter with that given in the first. But to
receive them as the descriptions of two successive creations, the first
being spiritual, (as it truly was,) and the second being temporal, all
difficulties and discrepancies in the two different descriptions vanish
away, and a flood of light bursts upon the mind.

[12] There were some things, however, which these spirits could not learn
while they remained in their first estate: they could not learn the feelings
and sensations of spirits embodied in tabernacles of flesh and bones. An
idea of these feelings and sensations could not be imparted to them by
teaching, nor by any other means whatsoever. No power of language or signs
could give them the most distant idea of them. An idea of those feelings and
sensations can only be obtained by actual experience. They might be
described to them for millions of ages, and yet without being placed in a
condition to experience them for themselves, they never could form any ideas
concerning them. This may be illustrated by supposing an infant to be born
in a dungeon where not the least ray of light was ever permitted to enter.
This infant might grow up to manhood with the organs of vision perfect, but
he would have no idea whatever of the sensation of seeing--he could form no
conception of light or of the beauty of the various colors of light, though
this sensation might be described to him for one hundred years, yet no power
of language could convey to him the faintest idea of red or green, or blue,
or yellow, or of anything else connected with the sensations produced by
light. These feelings could only be learned by actual experience; then, and
not till then, would he know anything about it. So, likewise, there are many
feelings and sensations arising from the intimate connexion of spirits with
flesh and bones that can only be learned by experience.

There are two different kinds of knowledge: one kind is obtained from
reason and reflection, of which self-evident truths are the foundation; the
other kind is gained by sensation or experience. The ideas relating to the
first kind are obtained by comparing truth with truth; hence they are
acquired by spirits in this manner, and can be communicated to them
independent of experience. The ideas of the latter kind cannot be obtained
by reasoning or reflection; they can only be learned by experience. Spirits,
therefore, can advance to the highest degree of knowledge in some things,
while in others they must remain in ignorance until they are placed in
circumstances [13] to learn them by experience. Now there are many
experimental truths which are just as necessary to be learned as truths of a
different nature, and without the knowledge of which an intelligent being
could never be perfected in happiness and glory; hence it becomes necessary
that these spirits should enter bodies of flesh and bones, that they by
experience may learn things which could not be learned in the spiritual
state. None of these spirits are permitted to have tabernacles of flesh if
they have violated the laws of their first estate and altogether turned
therefrom; for if they will not abide in the laws of the spiritual state and
hold sacred the knowledge therein gained, their Father will not entrust them
with the knowledge to be gained in the second estate. If they keep not the
first estate, they will not be permitted to enter upon the second; and this
is their torment because they are held back and are prohibited from
advancing in knowledge and glory with the rest of the family who have been
faithful.

That there has been a rebellion among these spirits, is evident from the
Scriptures. The Apostle John says, &quot;And there appeared another wonder in
Heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and
seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars
of Heaven, and did cast them to the earth.&quot; &quot;And there was war in Heaven:
Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and
his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in
Heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old Serpent, called the
Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the
earth, and his angels were cast out with him.&quot; (Rev. 12:3, 4, 7, 8, 9) The
name of the being who headed this rebellion was called, &quot;Dragon,&quot; &quot;Serpent,&quot;
&quot;Devil,&quot; or &quot;Satan;&quot; the place where the war commenced, was Heaven; the
persons engaged with the Devil were &quot;his angels,&quot; called &quot;the stars of
heaven&quot;; the number of Satan's army was &quot;the third part of the stars of
Heaven&quot; or of &quot;the angels,&quot; the other two-thirds were headed by Michael; the
Devil's army were [14] banished from Heaven to the earth. Some, perhaps, may
imagine that these angels were beings who had been redeemed from some former
world, and afterwards rebelled; but if this were the case, they would not be
evil spirits, but would be evil beings, having flesh and bones, and
consequently would be unable to enter into the tabernacles of human beings;
but as many of them frequently have entered into one person, it shows most
clearly that they are spirits. Others, perhaps, may imagine that these
fallen angels are the spirits of evil men who hove died on some former
world, and whose bodies have never been raised; but this conjecture would
not harmonize with the plan, pursued in regard to the wicked of this
creation who are all to be raised from the dead and their spirits and bodies
to be reunited; neither would it harmonize with the testimony of the Apostle
Jude who says, &quot;The angels which kept not their first estate, but left their
own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto
the judgment of the great day.&quot; (Jude, verse 6) This passage proves that
fallen angels are those who were on trial in their first estate. Angels do
not receive fleshly bodies until they enter their second estate,
consequently those in the first estate must be spirits. That these angels
were spirits, pertaining to this creation, and not to a former one, is shown
from the fact, that they are reserved &quot;in chains under darkness unto the
judgment of the great day.&quot; If they had lived in a first estate, preceding
the one where our spirits were on trial, then they would have been judged on
a previous world, but their judgment day has not yet come, but will come at
the end of the earth, or at the time when the wicked of this world are
judged. If, then, they are to receive a judgment in connection with the
inhabitants of this earth, they must have formed a portion of the same
family in the first estate, and did not have an origin anterior to the
family, designed for this earth.

Having learned that there has been war in heaven, let us next inquire, at
what period this war ended? It is very plain that the war must have been
raging in heaven [15] after the earth was formed; for when the Devil and his
angels were cast out of Heaven, they were banished to our earth,
consequently the earth was formed and in existence at the close of the war
in Heaven. The Devil was on the earth at the time Adam and Eve were in the
garden; it was he that lied to Eve and deceived her; hence, he is called &quot;a
liar from the beginning&quot; or &quot;the father of lies.&quot; Now whether he and his
angels had, at that early period, been cast out of Heaven upon the earth, is
not, in the English version of the Bible, clearly revealed. If they had not
at the period of the fall of Adam, already received their banishment from
heaven, the Devil must, at least, have come, by permission, to this earth,
and entered into the garden; and if his expulsion had not, at that time,
taken place, he would, after having accomplished his evil designs in
bringing about the fall of man, have returned again to his armies in Heaven
to encourage them in their unholy and malicious warfare. But from the
testimony, in the revelations which God gave through Joseph Smith, the
prophet, we are informed that Adam was Michael. It is reasonable, therefore,
to suppose that Michael who headed the armies in Heaven against the Devil's
forces would continue the command until the close of the war or until the
Devil's army were banished to the earth. To have left his post, and resigned
his command before the enemy was overcome, would have been only a partial
victory, and the trial in the first estate would have been incomplete.
Nothing short of a full discomfiture of the enemy's forces and their
banishment from Heaven, would have rendered the victory complete; nothing
short of this, would have entitled them to the praise of having kept their
first estate. It is plain, therefore, that the war in Heaven had ended,
before Michael left Heaven, and entered a body of flesh and bones under the
name of Adam.

When did this war in Heaven commence? All the light we have upon this
question is contained in modern revelations, and in those ancient
revelations which have been revealed anew through Joseph the Seer. We quote
the following from the book of Abraham: &quot;Now the Lord [16] had shown unto
me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and
among all these, there were many of the noble and great ones; and God saw
these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he
said, these I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were
spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me, Abraham, thou
art one of them, thou wast chosen before thou wast born. And there stood one
among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him,
we will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these
materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; and we will
prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord
their God shall command them; and they who keep their first estate, shall be
added upon; and they who keep not their first estate, shall not have glory
in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who
keep their second estate, shall have glory added upon their heads forever
and ever. And the Lord said, who shall I send? And one answered like unto
the Son of Man, here am I, send me. And another answered and said, here am
I, send me. And the Lord said, I will send the first. And the second was
angry, and kept not his first estate, and, at that day, many followed after
him. And then the Lord said, let us go down; and they went down at the
beginning, and they organized and formed (that is, the Gods) the Heavens and
the earth. And the earth, after it was formed, was empty and desolate,
because they had not formed anything but the earth; and darkness reigned
upon the face of the deep, and the spirit of the Gods was brooding upon the
faces of the water.&quot; In this divine history, we are informed that the
rebellion commenced at the time that the heavenly host were counseling,
together, concerning the formation of this earth and the peopling of the
same. The rebellion, therefore, must have been raging from the time of the
holding of this grand council, until the foundations of the earth were laid,
and probably too for some time after; but it must have been some time during
the period between the beginning of this creation and the completion of the
[17] same, preparatory to the reception of Michael or Adam, that Satan and
his army were overcome and banished to the earth. How long the period was,
intervening between the time of holding the council and the beginning of
this creation, is not revealed; it may have been only a very short period,
or it may have been millions of years. And again, how long it was from the
commencement of the creation, until Satan was cast out, is not revealed;
because we do not know the length of time included in each day's work,
pertaining to the creation; neither do we know on which of these days or
periods he was cast out.

It seems that Satan had proposed a plan to &quot;redeem all mankind, that one
soul should not be lost;&quot; and believing that his plan was superior to any
other suggested in the council, he was determined to carry it into effect at
all hazards; hence, he said to the Lord, &quot;surely I will do it; wherefore
give me thine honor.&quot;

If Satan had been permitted to carry out his plan, it would either have
destroyed the agency of man, so that he could not commit sin; or it would
have redeemed him in his sins and wickedness, without any repentance or
reformation of life. If the agency of man were destroyed, he would only act
as he is acted upon, and consequently he would merely be a machine; and his
actions would have neither merit or demerit, so far as he was concerned, and
could neither be punished nor rewarded, and would produce neither misery nor
joy. Destroy the agency of man, and you destroy the main-spring of his
happiness. Again, take away the agency of man, and you deprive him of his
intelligence; for intelligence is the original force or cause of actions; it
is a self-moving force; and all actions, resulting from such a force, must
necessarily be free. If, therefore, the agency of man or his freedom of
action be destroyed, you destroy his self-moving force; and if you deprive
him of such force, you deprive him of intelligence; therefore, agency is
essential to the very existence of intelligence. This truth is clearly
revealed in a revelation given to Joseph the Seer, which reads as follows:
&quot;All [18] truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to
act for itself, as all intelligence also, otherwise there is no existence.
Behold, here is the agency of man.&quot; (Doc. and Cov., sec. 83, par. 5) The
plan proposed by the devil, while he was yet in his first estate or in
Heaven, was to destroy the agency of man, thereby depriving him of the
intelligence which God had given to him, and by this process man would be
unable to do, of his own accord, either good or evil; and Satan thought that
he could thus &quot;redeem all mankind, that not one soul should be lost.&quot; He did
not perceive that man, redeemed after his plan, would be a perfect idiot,
without the least glimmering of intelligence.

Some, perhaps, may think we have misrepresented the intentions of the
devil; for they can scarcely believe him to be so profoundly ignorant as to
propose a plan which would, in its very nature, destroy the intelligence or
knowledge of the human race. Such, perhaps may argue that it is more
reasonable to suppose that the devil intended to leave them to their agency,
so far as doing good or evil is concerned; and that thus their intelligence
would be retained; but that he designed to redeem them from the effects of
their sins without any exercise of their agency in the act of repentance or
reformation. Such a plan, we admit, would thwart the ends of justice, and
would admit unholy and sinful beings into the kingdom of God; such beings
would be redeemed in all their sins and would still be determined to pursue
a sinful course. And such characters would turn a Heaven into a hell, and
make themselves miserable, and also all others with whom they were
associated. But such a plan, though it destroys justice, does not destroy
the agency of man. It is true, that it redeems him without the exercise of
his agency, but does not deprive him of it. But the revelation says that
Satan desired to bring about the redemption of all mankind by the
destruction of his agency; it reads thus: &quot;Satan rebelled against me, and
sought to destroy the agency of man which I, the Lord God, had given him,
and also, that I should give unto him mine own power.&quot; However wise [19]
Satan may have been, in some respects this plan certainly was a very foolish
one. Satan's sin does not appear to have consisted wholly in the foolishness
of the plan which he proposed before the grand council of Heaven, but in his
stubbornness or unwillingness to yield to the superior light of the council;
having devised the plan, he was determined to carry it into effect;
therefore he sought to overthrow the kingdom and to usurp the power thereof
in his own hands; hence, he demanded of the Lord, saying, &quot;Give me thine
honor,&quot; or as the Lord expresses himself in the above quotation, &quot;Satan
rebelled against me, and sought that I should give unto him mine own power.&quot;

However foolish Satan's plan may appear to us, it must have appeared
plausible to many of his brethren; they looked upon a theory which they
supposed would redeem them all to be superior to all others. They either had
not sufficient intelligence to judge of the consequences of a scheme,
destroying the agency of man; or else they preferred to run the risk of the
results, rather than come under a plan, founded upon the principles of
justice and mercy, which would punish and reward them according to their
works. It may be, that they were capable of discerning and judging
righteously, every scheme that was proposed, but were careless and
indifferent upon these subjects, deciding with Satan, before they had made
sufficient investigation, and having taken sides, they were determined to
maintain their position.

It is not likely that the final decision of the contending armies took
place immediately. Many, no doubt, were unsettled in their views, unstable
in their minds, and undecided as to which force to join; there may have been
a long period before the division line was so strictly drawn as to become
unalterable. Laws, without doubt, were enacted, and penalties affixed,
according to the nature of the offenses or crimes; those who altogether
turned from the Lord, and were determined to maintain the cause of Satan,
and who proceeded to the utmost extremities of wickedness, placed themselves
without the [20] reach of redemption; therefore, such were prohibited from
entering into a second probationary state, and had no privilege of receiving
bodies of flesh and bones. A second estate, to them would have been of no
advantage, because they had sinned to that extent that the Spirit of the
Lord had entirely left them, and light and truth no longer dwelt in them,
therefore, they could not feel a disposition to repent; and if they had been
permitted to enter another state of trial, they would have continued their
unholy warfare. And, also, if they had been permitted to receive fleshly
bodies, they would have propagated their species, and instilled into the
minds of their children the same devilish principles which reigned in their
own bosoms. Therefore, the Lord thrust them out of Heaven and &quot;reserved them
in chains of everlasting darkness until the judgment of the great day&quot; which
will come at the end of the earth. The number cast out were about one-third
part, as revealed, not only to John on the Isle of Patmos, but to Joseph the
Seer, as follows:--&quot;And it came to pass, that Adam being tempted of the
Devil; for, behold, the Devil was before Adam, for he rebelled against me,
saying, Give me thine honor which is my power; and also a third part of the
hosts of Heaven turned he away from me, because of their agency; and they
were thrust down, and thus came the Devil and his angels. And, behold, there
is a place prepared for them from the beginning, which place is hell.&quot; (Doc.
and Cov., Sec. 10, par. 10)

Among the two-thirds who remained, it is highly probable, that there were
many who were not valiant in the war, but whose sins were of such a nature
that they could be forgiven through faith in the future sufferings of the
Only Begotten of the Father, and through their sincere repentance and
reformation. We see no impropriety in Jesus offering Himself as an
acceptable offering and sacrifice before the Father to atone for the sins of
His brethren, committed, not only in the second, but also in the first
estate. Certain it was that the work which Jesus was to accomplish was known
in the Grand Council where the rebellion broke out; it was known that man
would sin [21] in his second estate; for it was upon the subject of his
redemption that the assembly became divided, and which resulted in war.
John, the revelator, speaking of a certain power, says, &quot;And all that dwell
upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of
life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.&quot; (Rev. 13:8) Now we
may ask, Why was the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world?&quot; If there
were no persons who had sinned in their first estate, that could be
benefitted by the sufferings of their elder brother, then we can see no
reason for considering Him at that early period, as already slain: the very
fact that the atonement which was to be made in a future world, was
considered as already having been made, seems to show that there were those
who had sinned, and who stood in need of the atonement. The nature of the
sufferings of Christ was such that it could redeem the spirits of men as
well as their bodies. The word of the Lord, through Joseph, the prophet, to
Martin Harris, reads thus:--&quot;I command you to repent--repent, lest I smite
you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your
sufferings be sore--how sore you know not! how exquisite you know not! yea,
how hard to bear you know not! For behold, I, God, have suffered these
things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent; but if they
would not repent, they must suffer even as I, which suffering caused myself,
even God, the greatest of all to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at
every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit; and would that I might not
drink the bitter cup and shrink--nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I
partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.&quot; (Doc. and
Cov., Sec. 44:2) Jesus suffered, not only in body, but also in spirit. By
the sufferings of His body He atoned for the sins of men committed in and by
the body: by the sufferings of His spirit, He atoned for the sins committed
by the spirit; hence, the atonement redeems both body and spirit. It is
reasonable, therefore, to suppose that if spirits in the first estate
sinned, they might be forgiven through their faith and repentance, by virtue
of the future sufferings of Christ.

[22] That the spirits of men did receive promises and gifts before the world
began, is clearly manifest in many parts of Scripture. The Apostle Paul
writes as follows:-- In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie,
promised before the world began.&quot; (Titus 1:2) God &quot;promised&quot; &quot;eternal life&quot;.
When was this promise made? It was made &quot;before the world began&quot;. To whom
was it made? It was made to the spirits of men who existed before the world
began. We were comforted with the promises of God when we dwelt in His
presence. We could then look upon the face of the First Born and consider
Him as already slain, or as Peter says, that He &quot;verily was foreordained
before the foundation of the world.&quot; (I Peter 1:20) When we were in our
spiritual state, all the grace or mercy we received was because of Christ.
Paul, in speaking of God, says, &quot;Who hath saved us, and called us with an
holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose
and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.&quot; (2
Tim. 1:9) According to this passage, and the preceding ones, Paul, Timothy,
Titus, and others existed before the world began, and in that anterior
existence, God made promises unto them of eternal life, and also gave them
grace &quot;in Christ Jesus.&quot; The Apostle Paul also says: &quot;Blessed be the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual
blessings in heavenly places in Christ: according as He hath chosen us in
Him before the foundation of the world.&quot; (Eph. 1:3, 4) Now if the Apostles
and others were called &quot;with an holy calling,&quot; and &quot;chosen Christ before the
foundation of the world,&quot; and actually received grace in Christ, and had the
promise of &quot;Eternal Life&quot; made to them &quot;before the world began,&quot; then should
it be thought incredible, that in and through Christ they also received
forgiveness of the sins which they have committed in that pre-existent
state?

If all the two-thirds who kept their first estate were equally valiant in
the war, and equally faithful, why should some of them be called and chosen
in their spiritual state to hold responsible stations and offices in this
world, [23] while others were not? If there were none of those spirits who
sinned, why were the Apostles, when they existed in their previous state,
chosen to be blessed &quot;with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in
Christ?&quot; All these passages seem to convey an idea, that there were
callings, choosings, ordinances, promises, predestinations, elections, and
appointments, made before the world began. The same idea is also conveyed in
the quotation which we have already made from the Book of Abraham. &quot;Now the
Lord, had shewn unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized
before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and
great ones; and God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the
midst of them, and he said, these I will make my rulers; for he stood among
those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto
me, Abraham, thou art one of them, thou wast chosen before thou wast born.&quot;
Now is there not reason to believe that the nobility or greatness which many
of these spirits possessed, was obtained by faithfulness to the cause of
God? Was it not because of their righteousness that they were appointed to
be the Lord's Rulers? How did Abraham become one of the noble and great
spirits? How came the Lord to choose Abraham before he was born? If we had
an answer to these questions, we should very probably find that Abraham
stood up valiantly for the Son of God at the time the rebellion broke out;
and that because of his integrity and righteousness, the Lord chose him
before he was born to hold authority and power in his second estate, to
become the father of the faithful, and to be a blessing to all nations.

All the spirits when they come here are innocent; that is, if they have
ever committed sins, they have repented and obtained forgiveness through
faith in the future sacrifice of the Lamb. So far as innocency is concerned,
they enters this world alike; but so far as circumstances are concerned they
are not alike. One class of spirits are permitted to come into the world in
an age when the priesthood and kingdom of God are on the earth, and they
hear and receive the gospel; others enter the [24] world in an age of
darkness, and are educated in foolish and erroneous doctrines. Some are born
among the people of God and are brought up in the right way; others are born
among the heathen, and taught to worship idols. Some spirits take bodies in
the lineage of the chosen seed, through whom the priesthood is transferred;
others receive bodies among the African Negroes or in the lineage of Canaan
whose descendants were cursed, pertaining to the priesthood. Now if all the
spirits were equally faithful in their first estate in keeping the laws
thereof, why are they placed in such dissimilar circumstances in their
second estate? Why are some placed in circumstances where they are taught of
God, become rulers, kings, and priests, and finally are exalted to all the
fulness of Celestial glory; while others are taught in all kinds of
wickedness, and never hear the gospel, till they hear it in prison after
death, and in the resurrection receive not a Celestial glory, but a
Terrestrial? If rewards and punishments are the results of good and evil
actions, then it would seem that the good and evil circumstances under which
the spirits enter this world, must depend upon the good and evil actions
which they had done in the previous world. Our condition when we enter the
next world will depend upon our conduct here. By analogy, then, does not our
condition when we enter this world, depend upon our conduct before we were
born? Does not the question which the Apostles put to the Saviour,
respecting the man who was born blind, show that they considered it possible
for a man to sin before he was born? They considered it reasonable that a
person should be born blind as a penalty for the sins which he had committed
before he was born. Though the spirits are all innocent when they come here,
may it not be possible that they are forgiven and made innocent on condition
that they shall enter this world under circumstances either favorable or
unfavorable, according to the nature of their sins? Do not the inhabitants
of our world, who are raised from the dead, differ in glory as one star
differs from another? Is it not necessary that they should be forgiven of
all their sins and made innocent before they can receive the Holy Ghost or
any [25] degree of glory? And do not the differences of their condition in
the resurrection depend upon the nature of their actions in this life? If
then they must be forgiven and become innocent before they can even enter a
kingdom of glory, and if, when they do enter there, it is under a great
variety of circumstances, depending on their actions here, then we may from
analogy reason that the spirits must be forgiven and become innocent before
they can even come here, and that when they do come, it will be under a
great variety of conditions, depending on their actions in a previous state.

The division line being permanently drawn between Michael's and the Devil's
forces, the latter were overpowered and cast down, and the whole heavens
wept over their fall. A description of this is given in a vision shown to
Joseph the Seer and Sidney Rigdon; we give the following extract: &quot;And this
we saw also and bear record, that an angel of God who was in authority in
the presence of God, who rebelled against the only begotten Son, whom the
Father loved, and who was in the bosom of the Father, was thrust down from
the presence of God and the Son, and was called Perdition, for the heavens
wept over him--he was Lucifer, a son of the morning. And we beheld, and lo,
he is fallen! is fallen! even a son of the morning.&quot; (Doc. &amp; Cov. 92:3)
Peace being restored in Heaven, and all who remained, having kept their
first estate and overcome Satan, the next great work to be accomplished was
to place these spirits upon the new earth in tabernacles of flesh and bones,
where they all could pass through another series of trials, and meet their
common enemy upon new grounds; and if they should succeed in this second
warfare and overcome and vanquish the hosts of hell, they were to be counted
worthy to inherit all things, and to become equal with their Father in
glory, and in power, and in might, and in dominion.

The Heaven, earth, animals, vegetables, and all things, pertaining to this
creation, being finished, the Lord pronounced the whole &quot;very good.&quot; Sorrow,
misery, sick-[26]ness, pain, and death were unknown. Immortality was
enstamped upon man and the whole animal kingdom. If any living creature had
been subject to death, or any manner of pain, it would not have been perfect
in its organization; it could not have been pronounced good; neither would
it have been consistent, as the work of an all-wise and supremely good
Being. Perfection characterizes all the works of God; therefore, all the
tabernacles which he made from the dust must have been capable of eternal
endurance. There must have been something connected with these fleshly
tabernacles which was capable of preserving them in immortality.

If spirits, in their first estate, did not know good from evil, why were
they thrust down and bound with &quot;everlasting chains of darkness&quot; for doing
that which they did not know to be evil? Would any parent, here in this
world, banish his children everlastingly from his presence, without any
hopes of recovery, for doing those things which they did not know to be
evil? Our hearts would revolt at the very idea of such injustice in an
earthly parent. Shall we then represent God as more unjust than man? Shall
we say that he will punish with everlasting punishment the rebellious angels
without a sufficient cause? Shall he doom them to endless misery for acts
which they did not know to be evil? Our hearts would revolt at the very idea
of such injustice in an earthly parent. Shall we then represent God as more
unjust than man? Shall we say that He will punish with everlasting
punishment the rebellious angels without a sufficient cause? Shall He doom
them to endless misery for acts which they did not know to be evil? It is
evident, then, that the angels in their first estate knew good and evil; and
therefore, were subjects of reward and punishment for their acts.

Why was man deprived of all his former knowledge when he left the spirit
world and came here? It was in order that he might have a second trial or
probation under new circumstances and conditions to which he had not
previously been subject.

[27] Man being without the knowledge of good and evil would be in a state of
innocence; and being immortal, not subject to pain or death, he would be
entirely ignorant concerning the nature of pain or misery; it could not be
described to him, so as to convey to his mind the least idea of its nature.
Nothing short of suffering pain could impart to him a knowledge respecting
it. A knowledge of pain never could have been derived from the reasoning
faculties, neither could they have derived it from observation, . . .

If man before the fall had no knowledge of misery, it is evident that he
also must have been ignorant of the nature of happiness; for although placed
in circumstances where there is no misery, yet he does not realize that this
condition is a condition of happiness: no one could explain to him the
nature of happiness: the idea of happiness never could enter his mind until
he could form an idea of a state or condition of an opposite nature.* * * It
was necessary, therefore, for them to experience pain or misery, that they
might discern and appreciate happiness.

Christ was considered as a &quot;Lamb slain from the foundation of the world,&quot;
to atone for the original sin of Adam. Therefore, by his transgression, he
obtained knowledge indispensably necessary to his exaltation and happiness;
and by the atonement his sin was forgiven, and he restored to the favor of
God, possessing the requisite qualifications to enjoy his redemption, and
the society of beings who knew good and evil. &quot;The Lord God said, Behold the
man is become as one of us, to know good and evil.&quot; (Gen. 3:22) God and the
heavenly host had attained to the knowledge of good and evil, and therefore
they were capable of enjoying happiness and judging righteously according to
the principles of right and wrong, justice and mercy. * * * The Son did not
consider death to be too great a sacrifice, in order that man might be
raised from the very depths of ignorance and be placed on an equal footing
with the Gods, as far as it regards good and evil and all their accompanying
consequences.

[28] When, therefore, the infant spirit is first born in the heavenly world,
that is not a commencement of its capacities. Each particle eternally
existed prior to this organization. * * * How many different laws these
particles have acted under during the endless school of experience through
which they have passed is not known to us. What degree of knowledge they
have obtained by experience, previous to their organization in the womb of
the celestial female, is not revealed. One thing is certain, the particles
that enter into the organization of the infant spirit, are placed in a new
sphere of action: the laws to govern them in this new and superior condition
must be different from any laws under which they had previously acted.

It seems far more consistent to believe that infinite knowledge has from
all eternity existed somewhere, either in organized personages or in
disorganized materials. * * * The Light and Intelligence and Truth which
each Saint will then possess in fulness, was not created, neither, indeed,
can be, but they were from all eternity. * * * How very different in their
nature is light and truth from substance. A substance can only be in one
place at a time: while intelligence or truth can be in all worlds at the
same instant. A substance cannot be divided, and a part be taken to some
other place, without diminishing the original quantity from which it was
taken: while different portions of light and truth may be imparted to other
beings in other places without diminishing in the least the fountain from
which they are derived.

We have dwelt upon this subject rather longer than what we, at first,
intended, because we consider it a principle which should be well understood
by the Saints, not only for our own benefit, but that we may be able to
teach others correctly. * * * It is for this purpose that we have dwelt so
long upon the pre-existence of man in order that we may the more clearly
understand, not only our heavenly and God-like origin, but the grand system
of laws by which God originates and prepares tabernacles for His [29] own
residence in which the fulness of His wisdom, power, and glory, are
manifested. O how great, and how marvelous are the ways of God, and His
plans which He has adopted for the salvation and glorification of His
intelligent offspring! Who can understand these things without rejoicing by
day and by night! And who can understand the works of our God and the
mysteries of His kingdom, unless he is enlightened by the light of the Holy
Spirit! Well did the Apostle Paul say, &quot;the natural man knoweth not the
things of God, because they are spiritually discerned;&quot; &quot;but God hath
revealed them unto us by His spirit; for the spirit searcheth all things,
yea, even the deep things of God.&quot; Well did our Saviour say, that the Spirit
of Truth should guide his disciples into all Truth--should take of the
things of the Father and should show them unto his people--should show them
things to come, and thus make them revelators and prophets. O that mankind
would consider upon these things! O that they would come unto God like men
in days of old, and learn of Him now, as they did then! O that they would
reflect upon their heavenly origin, and what may be their future destiny, if
they would only claim, through obedience and faith, the high privileges set
before them! O that they knew what belongs to their peace and welfare both
here and hereafter! But they know not--they are like the beast that
perisheth, for whom slaughter is prepared, and he knoweth it not: even so,
it is with this generation; they know nothing only what they know naturally;
they have denied the necessity of present revelation; therefore, all
spiritual light and heavenly knowledge are withheld from them, and they will
bring swift destruction upon themselves and perish in their sins, and this
causes my heart to be sorrowful; and I mourn over the hardness of their
hearts and the blindness of their minds by day and by night; and I labor and
toil, and also my brethren, to recover them, but their hearts are fully set
within them to do evil, and they must soon be ripened for the destructions
decreed upon the nations in the latter days.

We have in this article on pre-existence traced man back to his origin in
the heavenly world as an infant [30] spirit; we have shown that this spirit
was begotten and born by celestial parents long anterior to the formation of
this creation. We have shown that the great family of spirits had a
probation and trial before they came here--that a third part of them fell
and were cast out of Heaven and were deprived of fleshly bodies; while the
remainder have come forth in their successive generations to people this
globe. We have shown that, by keeping this their second estate, they will be
perfected, glorified, and made Gods like unto their Father God by whom their
spirits were begotten. The dealing of God towards His children from the time
that they are first born in Heaven, through all their successive stages of
existence, until they are redeemed, perfected, and made Gods, is a pattern
after which all other worlds are dealt with. All Gods act upon the same
great general principles; and thus, the course of each God is one eternal
round. There will, of course, be a variety in all His works, but there will
be no great deviations from the general laws which He has ordained. The
creation, fall, and redemption of all future worlds with their inhabitants
will be conducted upon the same general plan; so that when one is learned,
the great fundamental principles of the science of world-making,
world-governing, and world-redemption, will be understood.

The Father of our spirits has only been doing that which His Progenitors
did before Him. Each succeeding generation of Gods follow the example of the
preceding ones. Each generation have their wives, who raise up from the
fruit of their loins immortal spirits. When their families become numerous,
they organize new worlds for them, after the former patterns set before
them; they place their families upon the same who fall as the inhabitants of
previous worlds have fallen; they are redeemed after the pattern by which
more ancient worlds have been redeemed. * * * Thus will worlds and systems
of worlds, and gorgeous universes, be multiplied in endless succession
through the infinite depths of boundless space; some telestial, some
terrestrial, and some celestial, differing in their glory, as the apparent
splendor of the [31] shining luminaries of Heaven differ. All these will
swarm with an infinite number of living, moving, animated beings from the
minutest animalcules that sport by millions in a single drop of water, up
through every grade of existence to those Almighty, All wise, and Most
Glorious Personages who exist in countless numbers, governing and
controlling all things.
