Don't count on it.

Law enforcement at all levels - from village to FBI
- make a habit of &quot;enforcing&quot; laws just like this one.
They have two choices:   1.  Spends hundreds of man
hours and place their personnel in danger by chasing
down the likes of Sonny Barger and his friends.  2.
Find you.  Guess which one they pick?

They come after honest mostly law abiding citizens
because we don't fight back, we don't shoot at them,
and they know where to find us.

What will the feds do with your confiscated
property?   Same thing they do with confiscated houses,
cars, and other property - auction it off, or use it
themselves.  Your gun collection will now belong to
some federal agent who just happened to be in the right
place at the right time.

All of my firearms are unregistered.  I'm going to
keep it that way.

I knew I had read this somewhere before ....................
The Nazi reign of terror began with false news reports on the Jews,
Bohemians and Gypsies who were said to be arming themselves to overthrow the
&quot;New World Order&quot; and Hitler demanded that all good people register their
guns so that they wouldn't fall into the hands of &quot;terrorists and madmen&quot;.
Right wing fanatics of the &quot;Old Order&quot; who protested firearms registration
were arrested by the S.S. and put in jail for &quot;fomenting hatred against the
Government of the German people&quot;.

Then the Reichstag (government building) was blown up and Hitler ram-rodded
an &quot;Emergency Anti-Terrorist Act&quot; through Parliament that gave the Gestapo
extraordinary powers. The leader then declared that for the well-being of
the German people, all private firearms were to be confiscated by the
Gestapo and the Wermotten (federal law enforcement and military). German
citizens who refused to surrender their guns when the &quot;jack-boots&quot; (Gestapo)
came calling, were murdered in their homes. By the way, the Gestapo were the
federal marshals' service of the Third Reich. The S.W.A.T. team was invented
and perfected by the Gestapo to break into the homes of the enemies of the
German people.

Slight point of order - as far as I know (and I am German), small arms
ownership in Germany was pretty much unregulated in the confiscation
sense until the seventies. During the Nazi era it was still possible to
walk into ye olde gunne shoppe and buy a handgun, much like it still is
the case in several parts of Switzerland (hey, every male citizen has
an assault rifle and ammo anyway) and in parts of the US.

Only during the &quot;Red Army Faction&quot; terrorist scare of the 1970s and
1980s were German gun laws being tightened considerably, to dry up the
terrorist's source of guns. Which was laughable given that the way they
used to get their guns was either on the black market or by raiding
military depots anyway. But by then the government had decided that it
was scared enough of the average citizen to restrict handgun ownership.

Not sure.  I was in the local gun shop, with a town cop hanging out.  I

and had a nice conversation with him.  He's the one that said full-auto

firearms.  Whoever *has* the gun, owns it.

&gt; google searches came up with these 1st
">

&lt;snip list&gt;

I didn't have a look at a lot of the links but at several and I would
like to point out that the links I did check seem to many refer to the
negative consquences (ie confiscation of the weapons and worse) from
Jewish German citizens. This I didn't know about but it certainly fits
the picture of what I knew about that part of German history.

A little bit of Googleing &amp; Wikipediaing in Germany brought up the
following link (yes, it's in German):

http://www1.polizei-nrw.de/moenchengladbach/Waffenrecht/article/Historie
_des_Waffenrechts.html

It's published on the official Police website of the town of
Moenchengladbach and a short history of gun laws in Germany from 1851
onwards.

Feel free to run this through Babelfish or similar but I'll try to
summarize the important points here because they seem to also corborate
what I mentioned:

- It seems that from 1851 onwards, it was illegal to carry a weapon (in
public, I presume) that was hidden inside another object like a cane.
There were no other laws specifically targeting gun ownership.

- At the end of WW I, a lot of German soldiers went home with their
guns and ammo as the German armies hadn't surrendered; some of them got
sold on or just put away into the cupboard. Germany in the 20s had an
extremely volatile political climate so plenty of military weapons in
private hands resulted in armed uprisings, political assassinations and
the whole banana republic way of doing politics. As a consequence, laws
were inacted that banned the public from owning firearms, a ban that
was only revoked in 1928 and replaced with a law that severly
restricted the ownership of handguns - you basically had to prove that
you had a need for owning a handgun before you could get a permit to
buy one. You'd only get a permit for a rifle if you could prove that
you're a hunter (which wasn't and isn't as easy as in the US; normally
you 'rent' the right to hunt in some woods from the owner of said piece
of land with the result that hunting was and is a sport for the rich).

- Interestingly enough, during the Nazi period the gun laws were
actually relaxed inasmuch as you didn't need a permit for buying rifles
from 1938 onwards; you still needed a permit for a handgun though, and
all firearms would have to be registered. They author of the article
actually quotes part of this particular law and the part I find very
interesting is that the law specifically says that its purpose is to
make it easier for citizens to acquire firearms, but at the same time
the police should be able to prevent purchase and ownership of firearms
by those elements of society that were deemed &quot;unreliable&quot; and
potentially &quot;enemies of the state&quot;. And of course those &quot;unreliable&quot;
&quot;enemies of the state&quot; would cover everybody who was to the left of
Ghenghis Khan politically, homosexuals, Sinti &amp; Roma
(gypsies/travellers), anybody you didn't like and ratted out to the
authorities and of course the Jewish population. From what I've scanned
of the pages you mentioned, this is most likely the laws that were used
to confiscate the firearms owned by all those undesirables.

- /All/ ownership of any kind of firearm was banned between 1946 and
1951; from 1952 onwards, a large part of the 1938 law that relaxed the
restrictions of weapons ownership was reinstated. These laws were
finally superceded by more restrictive laws in 1972 and they've been
fiddling with them ever since. To make them more restrictive, of course
- there have been a couple (yes, I think it was one or two) incidents
of school shootings in the past 5-10 years which offered a welcome
excuse to tighten the screws even more.

So it looks like in a sense we were both right...

&gt; &gt;The Nazi reign of terror began with false news reports on the Jews,
&gt; &gt;Bohemians and Gypsies who were said to be arming themselves to overthrow the
&gt; &gt;&quot;New World Order&quot; and Hitler demanded that all good people register their
&gt; &gt;guns so that they wouldn't fall into the hands of &quot;terrorists and madmen&quot;.
&gt; &gt;Right wing fanatics of the &quot;Old Order&quot; who protested firearms registration
&gt; &gt;were arrested by the S.S. and put in jail for &quot;fomenting hatred against the
&gt; &gt;Government of the German people&quot;.

&gt; &gt;Then the Reichstag (government building) was blown up and Hitler ram-rodded
&gt; &gt;an &quot;Emergency Anti-Terrorist Act&quot; through Parliament that gave the Gestapo
&gt; &gt;extraordinary powers. The leader then declared that for the well-being of
&gt; &gt;the German people, all private firearms were to be confiscated by the
&gt; &gt;Gestapo and the Wermotten (federal law enforcement and military). German
&gt; &gt;citizens who refused to surrender their guns when the &quot;jack-boots&quot; (Gestapo)
&gt; &gt;came calling, were murdered in their homes. By the way, the Gestapo were the
&gt; &gt;federal marshals' service of the Third Reich. The S.W.A.T. team was invented
&gt; &gt;and perfected by the Gestapo to break into the homes of the enemies of the
&gt; &gt;German people.

&gt; &gt;history repeats it self try this .....

&gt; &gt;The Nazi reign of terror began with false news reports on the Alqueda who

&gt; &gt;they wouldn't fall into the hands of &quot;terrorists and madmen&quot;. Right wing
&gt; &gt;fanatics of the &quot;NRA&quot; who protested firearms registration were arrested by
&gt; &gt;the BATF  and put in jail for &quot;fomenting hatred against the Government of
&gt; &gt;the people&quot;.

&gt; &gt;When the Twin Towers and Pentagon were blown up and &quot;Emergency
&gt; &gt;Anti-Terrorist Act&quot; through &quot;Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous
&gt; &gt;Terrorists Act of 2007&quot;-the Gonzales/Lautenberg bill, S. 1237 gave the

&gt; &gt;well-being of the people, all private firearms were to be confiscated by the
&gt; &gt;BATF and the federal law enforcement and military. Citizens who refused to
&gt; &gt;surrender their guns when the BATF came calling in Waco, were murdered in

It's not registered by your state *BUT* you can bet the owner has a

unfortunately prohibits full auto ownership except by police departments.

Talking *individual* ownership...

NFA of 1934 put a $200 _tax_ on full-auto weapons and also on
silencers, short-barrelled shotguns, short-barrelled rifles and
&quot;destructive devices&quot;.  &quot;Any other weapons&quot; described under the act
are only charged a $5 tax.  The idea was to tax the &quot;assualt weapons&quot;
of the time out of the reach of the normal consumer and have a legal
arguement against their mere possesssion by gangsters because most
would not have paid the tax before they obtained their weapon.
Remember Al Capone?  He was busted for not paying taxes.  The same
approach applies here.

Fast forward to 1986 and the GCA.  The GCA put all legally taxed full
auto weapons into a pool that regular joes could transfer between each
other as long as they can legally possess *any* firearm (your normal
&quot;yellow form&quot;, but now white, 4473 sales) and as long as the proper
paperwork is done and the $200 tax is paid.  Your heir can inherit
your NFA weapon tax free as long as they can legally possess a
firearm.

Regular joes could no longer build their own full auto or convert a
semi to full under the GCA, nor buy post-'86 full auto weapons.  Legal
possession, manufacture and dealing in post-'86 full auto weapons is
currently limited to the government, law enforcement, military,
Special (Occupational) Taxpayers and within limits, holders of the
appropriate FFLs.

Inspections of your records and inventory can be preformed during the
&quot;normal business hours&quot; that you state when you apply for/renew your
FFL.  With a Type 03 (Collector of Curio and Relics) you usually don't
have business hours, so the BATF has to make an appointment with you.
The same *may* be true of a Type 01 (Dealer in Firearms other than
Destructive Devices) when you applied as a gunsmith and listed your
hours &quot;by appointment&quot; on the application.

Of course you may also get an &quot;inspection&quot; at any time during a bona
fide criminal investigation.

Bottom line, if you have a problem with a friendly visit from the
feds, you probably shouldn't be (or aren't) legally dealing in
firearms in the first place.  ;-)

you have to have the federal class III stamp to own a full auto weapon
anywhere in the u.s.

when you get a class III you need to also realize that the only person that
can possess or transport the firearm in question is the licensed owner.
your wife, kids or friends can't be moving it around.  unless you put it in
a trust.  if you plan on owning class threes then have a lawyer set up a
living trust.  you name your wife and kids as officers in the trust and the
trust buys the weapon.  since it is owned by the trust anyone named in the
paperwork can use it.  also there is no transfere fees or background checks
required in the event one of the officers of the trust passes on.  this is a
really cool loophole in the law that all folks should look at.

the living trust also really helps when probating the entire estate.  it
sticks it to the man on the inheritance tax and so forth.

With all due respect, &quot;Class III&quot; refers to the SOT &quot;dealer in NFA
weapons&quot; class, but has nothing to do with an *individual* owning one.
The proper term you should be using is Title 2, which defines NFA
weapons under the GCA.

SOT Class 1 - importer of NFA firearms
SOT Class 2 - manufacturer of NFA firearms
SOT Class 3 - dealer in NFA firearms

Class 1 and 2 may also deal in NFA firearms.

But none of the three are necessary for an individual to *own* a full
auto.

Naw, I've actually read their stuff on stick welding a couple of
times.

I'll be the first to admit I'm just a tool collector who knows enough
to be dangerous and doesn't use most of his stuff regularly enough to
get good at it.  But after some experimentation on scrap for rod size
and settings I did get the two frame sections welded together and it
didn't break when I sat on it.

That guy is the biggest Ass-wipe this state ever elected. This time he's in

losing, so they decided to take him out and bring back Lautenberg
15 days before the election. NJ election laws say a candidate has to
be on the ballet at least 30 days before election day, and the Republicans
tried to stop it, but the Democrat judges decided he didn't have to follow
