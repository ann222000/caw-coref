Teachers: Before using an "Inconvenient Truth" in classrooms, you need
to find something factual to show instead of Algore's fictional
mockumentary.

It is a far better thing for you to teach facts instead of political
nonsense designed to fund and promote Gore's '08 election campaign.

Leading Scientist Thinks Al Gore's Global Warming is a lie!!

Allegre's second thoughts

The Deniers --
The National Post's series on scientists who
buck the conventional wisdom on climate science
LAWRENCE SOLOMON, Financial Post
Published: Friday, March 02, 2007

Claude Allegre, one of France's leading socialists and
among her most celebrated scientists, was among the
first to sound the alarm about the dangers of global
warming.

"By burning fossil fuels, man increased the
concentration of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere which, for example, has raised the global
mean temperature by half a degree in the last century,"
Dr. Allegre, a renowned geochemist, wrote 20 years
ago in Cles pour la geologie.." Fifteen years ago, Dr.
Allegre was among the 1500 prominent scientists who
signed "World Scientists' Warning to Humanity," a
highly publicized letter stressing that global warming's
"potential risks are very great" and demanding a new
caring ethic that recognizes the globe's fragility in
order to stave off "spirals of environmental decline,
poverty, and unrest, leading to social, economic
and environmental collapse."

In the 1980s and early 1990s, when concern about
global warming was in its infancy, little was known
about the mechanics of how it could occur, or the
consequences that could befall us. Since then,
governments throughout the western world and
bodies such as the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have
commissioned billions of dollars worth of research
by thousands of scientists. With a wealth of data
now in, Dr. Allegre has recanted his views. To his
surprise, the many climate models and studies
failed dismally in establishing a man-made cause
of catastrophic global warming. Meanwhile,
increasing evidence indicates that most of the
warming comes of natural phenomena. Dr.
Allegre now sees global warming as over-hyped
and an environmental concern of second rank.

His break with what he now sees as
environmental cant on climate change came in
September, in an article entitled "The Snows of
Kilimanjaro" in l'Express, the French weekly.
His article cited evidence that Antarctica is
gaining ice and that Kilimanjaro's retreating snow caps,
among other global-warming concerns, come from
natural causes. "The cause of this climate change is
unknown," he states matter of factly. There is no basis
for saying, as most do, that the "science is settled."

[Actually it *IS* known. - Submarine volvcanic action.

Dr. Allegre's skepticism is noteworthy in several
respects. For one, he is an exalted member of
France's political establishment, a friend of former
Socialist president Lionel Jospin, and, from 1997 to
2000, his minister of education, research and
technology, charged with improving the quality of
government research through closer co-operation
with France's educational institutions. For another,
Dr. Allegre has the highest environmental
credentials. The author of early environmental books,
he fought successful battles to protect the ozone layer
from CFCs and public health from lead pollution. His
break with scientific dogma over global warming came
at a personal cost: Colleagues in both the
governmental and environmental spheres were aghast
that he could publicly question the science behind
climate change.

But Dr. Allegre had allegiances to more than his socialist
and environmental colleagues. He is, above all, a
scientist of the first order, the architect of isotope
geodynamics, which showed that the atmosphere was
primarily formed early in the history of the Earth, and the
geochemical modeller of the early solar system. Because
of his path-breaking cosmochemical research, NASA
asked Dr. Allegre to participate in the Apollo lunar
program, where he helped determine the age of the
Moon. Matching his scientific accomplishments in the
cosmos are his accomplishments at home: Dr. Allegre
is perhaps best known for his research on the structural
and geochemical evolution of the Earth's crust and the
creation of its mountains, explaining both the title of his
article in l'Express and his revulsion at the nihilistic
nature of the climate research debate.

Calling the arguments of those who see catastrophe in
climate change "simplistic and obscuring the true
dangers," Dr. Allegre especially despairs at "the
greenhouse-gas fanatics whose proclamations consist
in denouncing man's role on the climate without doing
anything about it except organizing conferences and
preparing protocols that become dead letters." The
world would be better off, Dr. Allegre believes, if these
"denouncers" became less political and more practical,
by proposing practical solutions to head off the
dangers they see, such as developing technologies to
sequester C02. His dream, he says, is to see "ecology
become the engine of economic development and not
an artificial obstacle that creates fear."

CV OF A DENIER:

Claude Allegre received a Ph D in physics in 1962
from the University of Paris.
He became the director of the geochemistry and
cosmochemistry program at the French National
Scientific Research Centre in 1967 and in 1971, he
was appointed director of the University of Paris's
Department of Earth Sciences. In 1976, he became
director of the Paris Institut de Physique du Globe.
He is an author of more than 100 scientific articles,
many of them seminal studies on the evolution of
the Earth using isotopic evidence, and 11 books.
He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of

Have you seen what the tree hugers are saying about carbon Credits?

http://www.sinkswatch.org/pubs/forestfraud.pdf

1. Carbon in trees is not equivalent to carbon in fossil fuels: Tree-stored
carbon is easily released into the atmosphere through fire, natural decay
and timber harvesting. Carbon in fossil fuels is locked away and only
released through human intervention. Carbon credits that equate the two are
based on a false premise.

2. One-way road: Trees provide temporary carbon storage as part of the
normal cycle of carbon exchange between forests and the atmosphere. The
release of carbon from fossil fuels is permanent and, over relevant
timescales, will accelerate climate change by increasing the active carbon
pool and destabilising carbon flows.

3. Fake credit: Carbon sink credits in the Kyoto Protocol use temporary tree
plantations to justify permanent releases of fossil-stored carbon into the
atmosphere. Carbon sink credits are fake credits for the climate.

4. Footprint chaos: Carbon sink credits increase the ecological debt of the
North. The more fossil fuel a Northern country uses, the more land it is
entitled to use to 'offset' its emissions. This is unfair and undermines
global efforts towards sustainable development.

5. Subsidies for mega-plantations: The Kyoto Protocol stands to provide a
new subsidy for the plantations industry. Documented evidence shows how
large-scale plantations have negative impacts on forests and forest peoples.
Kyoto includes no meaningful safeguards to rule  out large-scale monoculture
tree plantations from receiving carbon credits.

6. Communities suffer twice: First, climate change affects the livelihoods
of forest peoples and rural communities through increased droughts, floods,
forest fires and deforestation. Second, carbon sink credits promote the
expansion of large-scale tree plantations, which indigenous peoples and
forestdependent communities are opposing in many parts of the world.

7. Arming a time bomb: Avoiding climate change requires drastic reductions
of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, but carbon sink projects do
nothing to help solve this problem; in fact they mask the real crisis. This
is sentencing future generations to live with fewer choices and worse
conditions.

8. Forest fraud: Forests play a vital role in storing carbon and buffering
extreme weather events. But linking forest restoration with carbon credits
is a dead-end for forest peoples as well as for the climate. Halting the
forest crisis requires action against the underlying causes of
deforestation, not a bigger active carbon pool and more monoculture tree
plantations.

9. Blind guess: Measuring carbon pools is fraught with uncertainties.
Scientists have found that estimates of the carbon balance in Canadian
forests could vary by 1000 per cent if seemingly small factors, such as
increased levels of atmospheric CO2, are taken into account.

10. Phony climate fix: Real and lasting solutions to the forest crisis and
the climate crisis lie in providing incentives for forest-dependent
communities and indigenous peoples to restore their forests and practice
sustainable forest management. Small-scale pilot projects are already
showing positive results, while large-scale carbon sink projects are
attracting criticism and protest.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Allegre's second thoughts

&gt; &gt; What's his qualifications?

&gt; &gt; &gt; CV OF A DENIER:

&gt; &gt; &gt; Claude Allegre received a Ph D in physics in 1962
&gt; &gt; &gt; from the University of Paris.

&gt; &gt; Oh, and he's about to retire.  More?

&gt; &gt; &gt; He became the director of the geochemistry and
&gt; &gt; &gt; cosmochemistry program at the French National
&gt; &gt; &gt; Scientific Research Centre in 1967 and in 1971, he
&gt; &gt; &gt; was appointed director of the University of Paris's
&gt; &gt; &gt; Department of Earth Sciences. In 1976, he became
&gt; &gt; &gt; director of the Paris Institut de Physique du Globe.
&gt; &gt; &gt; He is an author of more than 100 scientific articles,
&gt; &gt; &gt; many of them seminal studies on the evolution of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Earth using isotopic evidence, and 11 books.
&gt; &gt; &gt; He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sciences and the French Academy of Science.

&gt; &gt; Well, so now instead of Phil Brennan's CV, we have a French
&gt; &gt; physics professor who believed and published otherwise to
&gt; &gt; the concerns of global warming..
