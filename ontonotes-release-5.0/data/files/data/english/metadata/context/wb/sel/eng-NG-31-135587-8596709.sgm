I have some X-Y data that I am plotting in a window. For the data to fit
into the plot area I transform it so it scales &amp; fits properly. This all
works fine.

The problem is I now need to get my data to appear in the plot area as a
log-lin plot. I know I should be able to apply some sort of formula to my Y
data so that when plotted on screen it appears as logarithmic but I'm a
little stuck on the forumla to use.

Can anyone give me some sample pseudo code? Or any pointers?

TIA

Xnew = X
Ynew = log10(Y)

Use the same transformation for the data that you used for the scale.
