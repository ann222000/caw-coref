Hi there,

I have just started doing my experiment with an oxygen sensor. I was
trying to get some oxygen % in air and then I tried doing the same in
water at different levels.
I was wondering if I can know the behaviour of oxygen diffusion in
water and how can I make sure that the data I am getting is correct?
Am I not considering some some important points while doing the
experiment?

Looking forward to your response
Thanks
-Nicky

This may not give you a very good result, as the sesonr "dynamics"
will probably depend on the sensor face being wet.

Measure at known water temperature, and make sure the water is
saturated at whatever feed gas you are using.  This information is
available many places, and you can "calibrate" your sensor this way.

Things to know:
- temperature
- pressure / depth
- feed gas type
- feed gas flow rate (only if you are looking for rate-to-saturation)

Things to research:
- Henry's law

Hopefully you will get some better / more complete answers here.

What are intending to do with your sensor?

Of course you can know the behavior of oxygen diffusion in water.
Look it up.  There are tables available with that information.

What do you mean "tried doing the same in water at different levels"?
Are you trying to make water samples with known amounts of oxygen
dissolved in them?  In my experience that is much harder than it
sounds.  I have done that by deoxygenating one batch of water, making
sure a second batch was completely saturated with oxygen and blending
these two under a nitrogen blanket to obtain water with known oxygen
levels.  It is possible your oxygen sensor is more accurate than your
ability to make your water samples.

For one thing, an O2 sensor suitable for air is not suitable for
water. For that, you need a Clark or similar electrode, plus the
appropriate reference electrode and measuring instrument or
potentiostat.

Most O2 electodes use a polyethylene membrane to separate the sample
water from the internal electrolyte of the sensor. O2 diffuses through
it rather quickly. But you are correct that diffusion through water is
likely to be the rate controlling step here, but you can correct for
temp using the appropriate tables.

The diff rate of O2 in water is not that easy to find these days, when
most places don't have an ancient copy of Critical Tables around. I
did find it once, and can't remember. However, it's immaterial, since
you are looking at the problem the wrong way.

An air sensor will not give useful results in water.

I think we need one more piece of information.  Is the poster wanting
to measure (or somehow use in another experiment) the rate of oxygen
diffusion in water or is he wanting to measure the oxygen content of
water?

Using a membrane type oxygen sensor requires rapid stirring of the
sample.  My Orion oxygen meter came with an adaptor for use with BOD
bottles and a magnetic stirrer to achieve that.  Without stirring the
reading on the DO meter dropped rapidly as oxygen was depleted at the
surface of the membrane.  Thus I think the rate of diffusion through
the membrane may be the rate limiting step in making measurements.

The optical sensors, such as those made by Ocean Optics, does not
require stirring since the sensor doesn't consume the oxyen it
measures.

About the use of an oxygen sensor for air and water-  the calibration
method for both kinds is to set the zero point by placing the sensor
in an oxygen-free environment.  This could be a nitrogen stream or it
could be a saturated solution of Na2SO3 which will have zero oxygen.
The 100% point is set in the ambient air.

Can I not expect these sensors to give a reasonably linear response
between 0'% and 21% oxygen in nitrogen?  I suppose it would not be
useful above 21%  oxygen since they are basically made for use in
aqueous solutions.  What kind of sensor would you use for the higher
levels of oxygen in a gas mixture?

The Ocean Optics sensor can be used in mayonaise, jammed into a piece
of meat, etc.

MSA makes sensors that are good for up to 100% oxygen in gas
form.  I think they are solid state, so may be something along
the lines of a "zinc - air battery".

Judging by the specs and interference matrix, I think they are nothing
more than the standard galvanic sensors made by a whole mess of
companies. I work with these suckers all the time.

The working electrode is usually gold, often a mesh on the back of a
porous Teflon diffusion barrier. The counter electrode is a huge chunk
of lead or cadmium, either of which have a low enough reduction
potential at alkaline pH to drive the reduction of oxygen at the
working electrode. The electrolyte is usually an alkaline citrate
buffer.

The counter electrode is usually large enough that it doesn't
polarize, so a reference electrode is not needed. These sensors are
often operated simply by connecting a low resistance across the
terminals and measuring the voltage drop. Current is linear with O2
partial pressure (not the log of O2).

These sensors have a strong but predictable temperature curve, which
is usually compensated by a thermistor-resistor network. They are
linear with O2 partial pressure to high levels until the counter
electrode starts to crap out after 6 mo to two years.
