Dear mindful friends,

For those of you who missed last Sunday's meditation and Dharma talk on
&quot;Amitabha, the Buddha of Infinite Light,&quot; I thought it would be  nice for you to
read this quote by Thich Nhat Hanh which I did  not have a chance to read
during the Dharma talk due to running out of  time.  Please enjoy this quote, enjoy
your breathing, enjoy &quot;Amitabha&quot; as  your mantra in every moment of your
daily life, and walk in the Pure Land here  and now.

Your spiritual brother,
ChiSing

&quot;THE LIMITLESS LIGHT OF MINDFULNESS&quot;
(by Thich Nhat Hanh)

Amitabha [one of the celestial Buddhas, and the most popular in Asian
Buddhism] literally means &quot;limitless light&quot; [amita = infinite, abha =  light].  The
Vietnamese Master Tue Trung has said: &quot;The original  reality of Amitabha is
our own Dharma body.  It shines out bright  everywhere, in the South, North,
East, and West.&quot;

When we light a candle or an oil lamp we have light, but it is not
limitless.  The candle will burn down and the oil will come to an end, and  when that
happens the light will come to an end too.  Buddha Amitabha is an  unending
source of light.  A bodhisattva and a Buddha always emanate a  far-reaching
light.  And what is the point of emanating light?  It is  to show the way and to
help people not to fall into the abyss of  suffering.

It is not only the Buddha and the bodhisattvas who can send out this  light.
Any one of us can send out the light of mindfulness.  When we  walk, stand,
sit, or give a Dharma talk, the light of mindfulness shines very  far.  When
people come to visit us and see us walking, standing, sitting,  and lying down
in mindfulness they also see the light of our practice body  shining out.  When
that ray of light touches another person, they are  impressed and wish to be
able to walk, stand, and work gracefully and mindfully  like that.  Monks,
nuns, and lay practitioners all have the ability to send  out light from their
practice body and their spirit.  All of us have the  capacity to send out the
light of mindfulness.  Mindfulness leads to  concentration, and concentration
leads to insight.  These are the precious  jewels which enable us to emanate the
light of practice.

We should not feel unworthy.  We too can emanate light like Buddha  Amitabha
even though our own light may not go as far.  If we practice every  day, then
each day we can send light farther.  This light can be sent out  in many
different forms.  In the world there are numberless people  practicing this way.
Thousands of people read books, hear tapes, and are  in touch with the Dharma
teachers of Plum Village [Thich Nhat Hanh's very  large monastery and retreat
center in southwest France].  Therefore  our light has already gone far and we
are participating in the work of Buddha  Amitabha in sending out light.
Sending out light is something we can do  right away today.  Just take one step in
mindfulness and light will appear  immediately.  That is how we should
understand light.  Limitless light  is the first definition of Buddha Amitabha.
