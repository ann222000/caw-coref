$$$ China knows how to tackle Buddhist nations. Tibet was a Buddhist
nation. Tibet has the common border with China. What happen? Tibet was
swallow by China and become part of China. China knows and had
experience of swallowing Buddhist nation. That was in the past,
history now. Present, China is swallowing Burma/Myanmar, a Buddhist
nation which has a common border with China. Thailand, another
Buddhist nation was lucky for she does not has a common border with
China.

$$$ China knows how to tackle with junta. China gives 2 vital things
the junta wants. Wealth (money) and power (protection). China &quot;bought&quot;
the ruling junta so that they can manipulate the entire country.
During General Ne Win era, at least the Burmese are in a position to
revolt against the Chinese. The Burmese kick out the wealthy Chinese
and Indians out of Burma. Now, the Burmese are poor, weak and not in a
position to revolt against the powerful and wealthy Chinese. In fact
the Burmese becomes the modern &quot;slaves&quot; of China. The gap of sanctions
by the west creates opportunity for China to buy out Burma/Myanmar.

$$$ China is going to open the Olympic games in 2008 and thus needs a
lot of restaurants for the people of the whole world coming into China
thus they need a lot of food supplies. What did China do? They
confiscate food supplies from Burma in replace of funds they aid
Burma. Burma had to give almost all their natural resources to China
in return for loans and funds China had given to them. Burmese people
had the left over and even become threaten to become hunger stricken
nation.

$$$ The junta knows the situation of the country and yet they
themselves cannot do anything about it for they themselves are being
&quot;bought&quot; by the Chinese. Even the gas constructed by India was given
to China and makes India mad. All natural resources are &quot;confiscated&quot;
by China in replace of funds/loans/aids given by China.

$$$ China knows the nationalist spirit of Aung San Suu Kyi and
&quot;instruct&quot; their puppet Generals to detain her indefinitely for she is
the only hope and inspiration for Burma and the Burmese people's
future. The Generals &quot;bought&quot; by China have no choice but to lock her
up for they know very well she is loved and respect by many both
inside and outside of Burma. Now and then China &quot;summons&quot; the &quot;paid&quot;
Generals for &quot;instructions&quot; how to keep the west, US/EU at bay and
manipulate Myanmar at their will/mercy.

$$$ As I watch the video of a pack of hunger hyenas eating the strong
buffalo &quot;alive&quot; by sheer numbers, it reminds me of a strong &quot;tatmadaw&quot;
eaten alive by the sheer power and wealth of a hungry giant neighbor
China in conjunction with millions of Chinese inside Myanmar. Burma/
Myanmar is facing the fate of Tibet indeed.

$$$ Not only the nation needs reform, the &quot;tatmadaw&quot; itself needs
&quot;serious&quot; reform by replacing with people who cannot, willnot be
&quot;bought&quot; by and set the nation for sale. The government buildings are
for sale right now in Rangoon/Yangon, a clear indication of a nation
for sale! Check-Book diplomacy is definitely working for China in many
parts of the world including Burma/Myanmar.
