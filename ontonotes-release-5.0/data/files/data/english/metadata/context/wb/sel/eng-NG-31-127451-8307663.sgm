The Jesus the mormons have is not only different in personality but
also in appearance.  I wonder how heavenly mother looks like for
them... maybe albino beautiful, or maybe Nicole kidman beautiful, or
maybe Gwen Stefani beautifu.  Definitely not Jeniffer Lopez beautiful,
nor Zhang Ziyi beautiful nor Halle Berri, nor Naomi beautiful.  Sad
all these later will turn into white after they resurrect or if they
are good people.

On my part, I used to be white; I was a big trouble for the Osmonds
and I am dark now.

Mormons believed that the lamanites, or the American Indians, would
turn whiter as they rejected the evil traditions of their ancestors by
embracing mormonism.

Although they had weird motives for helping the natives, I know at
least one native who really appreciated the help a mormon family gave
him when he was taken into their home.  He was smart enough to reject
the mormonism they tried to hoist on him, and at least he received an
education, which was harder for natives to find at the time on the rez.

They still believe that all will turn into &quot;white and delightsome&quot;
when they resurrect; it might not something they teach explicitly,
however it is s inprinted in their minds, documents, and the BoM.  The
teachings are a typical representation of the thoughs during the 1800
era.

Mormons are usually good people who do things for weir reasons; as it
happends in religion, people do things because they expect retribution
in the form of getting to heaven or having &quot;blessings&quot; in earth... I
know a few non-religious people who do things without any sort of
expectation
