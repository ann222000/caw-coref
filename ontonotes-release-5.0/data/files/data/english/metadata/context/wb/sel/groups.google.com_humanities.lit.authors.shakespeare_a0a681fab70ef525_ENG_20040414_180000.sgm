Earlist Authenticated &quot;Shakespeare&quot; Transcript
Found With Oxford's Personal Poems

Copyright 1945 by Charles Wisner Barrell
First published in The Shakespeare Fellowship Quarterly, April 1945.

&lt;&lt;James Orchard Halliwell (later Halliwell-Phillips) brought out the
fact that the names of the mysterious Bard and the mysterious poet
Earl have actually been linked together in unmistakable significance
since the 1590's at least.

The evidence is contained in a small volume of poems copied in the
handwriting of one Anne Cornwallis. Halliwell-Phillips dates the
transcription of this collection between the years 1585 &amp; 1595.
He published the first account of his acquisition of the russia
leather-bound quarto bearing the large feminine signature,

&quot;Anne Cornwaleys her booke,&quot; in a volume entitled,
Catalogue of Shakespeare Reliques In the Possession of
James Orchard Halliwell, Esq., F.R.S. in the year 1852.

Only seventy copies of the Catalogue were printed and
it has now become so rare that comparatively few students
of the authorship question even know of its existence.

Halliwell-Phillips purchased the item from the Russell family of Enfield,
following its acquisition by Dr. Russell at the sale of the Bright
manuscript collection at Sotheby's auction rooms in London in June 1844.

The description of the Cornwallis collection
is given thus in Sotheby's sale catalogue:

SHAKESPEARE. A POETICAL MISCELLANY OF THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH,
containing verses by EDWARD VERE, Earl of Oxford, Sir Edward Dyer,
VAVASOR, G. M., Sir P. Sidney, and Shakespeare; russia, 4 to.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

THIS STAR OF ENGLAND by Dorothy and Charlton Ogburn
Chapter Twenty-Nine

&lt;&lt;ANNE VAVASOR, daughter of Henry VAVASOR of YORK, was a cousin of the
Howards. Her mother was Margaret Knyvet, sister of Thomas Knyvet, who
was head of the Wiltshire branch of the family. A Gentleman of the
Chamber, he was appointed Keeper of Westminster Palace in January 1582,
and was knighted sometime before 1601. Spenser, who seems to have loved
Anne at one period, described her in The Shepheardes Calendar under the
name of Rosalind, as &quot;a gentlewoman of no meane house,&quot; who came from
the &quot;north parts.&quot; He, Colin Clout, had evidently become disillusioned
by the time he reached the August eclogue, where he wrote:

But tell me, shepherds, should it not yshend
Your roundels fresh to heare a do ole full verse
Of Rosalind, (who knows not Rosalind?)
That Colin made, ylke I you rehearse.

When, early in 1582, Knyvet challenged Oxford to a duel, it is not
surprising that the Queen, still vindictive against the Earl, took
Knyvet's part.

On March 17, 1582, Nicholas Fant wrote Anthony Bacon: &quot;In England of
late, there hath been a fray between my Lord of Oxford and Master Thomas
Knyvet of the Privy Chamber, who are both hurt, but my Lord of Oxford
more dangerously. You know Master Knyvet is not. meanly beloved in
Court, and therefore he is not likely to speed ill whatsoever the
quarrel be.&quot;

The Earl of Oxford was still in disgrace. Heretofore, no one had been
less &quot;meanly beloved in Court&quot; than he. The Queen had allowed him
unprecedented liberties. But now the story was different. At last Hatton
had the opportunity of doing him harm; and he made use of it by exerting
himself strenuously in Knyvet's behalf.

An entry in the diary of the Rev. Richard Madox dated March 3, gives
further details:

My Lord of Oxford fought with Master Knyvet about the quarrel of
Bessie Bavisar, and was hurt, which grieved the Lord Treasurer so much
the more for that the Earl hath company with his wife since Christmas.
But through this mishap, and through the pains he took at the marriage
of another daughter to my Lord Wentworth on Shroveday, my Lord Treasurer
was sick.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Halliwell-Phillips found an ancient manuscript which appears to be the
collaborative work of Edward de VERE and his dark-haired mistress. The
rhymes were evidently composed prior to 1581. They read as follows:

Verses made by the earle of Oxforde and Mrs Ann Vavesor

Sitting alone upon my thought in melancholy mood.
In sight of sea and at my back an ancient hoary wood,
I saw a fair young lady come, her secret fear to wail,
Clad all in color of a Nun and covered with a vail;
Yet (for the day was calm and clear) I might discern her face,
As one might see a damask rose hid under chrystal glass.
Three times with her soft hand full hard on her left side she knocks,
And sighed so sore as might have moved some pity in the rocks.
From sighs and shedding amber tears, into sweet song she broke.
When thus the Echo answered her to every word she spoke.

Ann Vavesor's eccho.

O heavens, quoth she, who was ye first that bred in me this feavere? Vere.
Who was the first that gave ye wound whose scar I wear for evere? Vere.
What, tyrant, Cupid! to my harm usurps thy golden quivere? Vere.
What wight first caught this heart and can from bondage it deliver? Vere.
Yet who doth most adore this wight, oh hollow caves! tell true? You.
What nymph deserves his liking best, yet doth in sorrow rue? You.

And I that knew this lady well
Said, Lord how great a miracle,
To her how eccho told the truth,
As true as Phoebus' oracle.

These verses bear the unmistakable evidences of combined authorship,
Oxford's personality being apparent in the opening and closing
movements. There is another manuscript version owned by the Folger
Shakespeare Library, which not only credits Oxford as author in the
heading, but which has the name &quot;VAVASER&quot;

The name VAVASOR means literally &quot;A CHIEF OF VASSALS.&quot;

Sonnet 58

That god forbid that made me first your slave,
I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
Being your VASSAL, bound to stay your leisure.

Sonnet 141

But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee.
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
Thy proud heart's slave and VASSAL wretch to be.

Capt. B. M. Ward has identified Charles Arundel as one of the turncoat
Elizabethans responsible for the writing and circulation of that
scurrilous classic of anti-English propaganda, Leycester's Commonwealth,
which caused such a furor in 1584. The Earl of Leicester is described in
this book as the real ruler of England, a monster of depravity whose
leisure is entirely devoted to the seduction of the ladies of the Court.
In the margin of this 1584 publication, opposite the reference to
&quot;another of higher place&quot; who has been offered &quot;an hundreth pound lands
by the year,&quot; we find printed in type the name of &quot;ANNE VAVISER.&quot;

Although Anne evidently returned to her YORKshire home in 1581, she was
not forgotten. Her friends at Court championed her cause in true cloak
and sword fashion. Oxford was obliged to fight a duel. The Earl had been
confined to his house on the Queen's order after leaving the Tower and
debarred from Court circles for two years. But on March 3, 1582 we learn
from the diary of the Rev. Richard Madox:

&quot;My lord of Oxford fought with Master Knyvet
about the quarrel of BESSIE BAVISAR. . . .&quot;

Despite the garbled name, the woman in the case was Anne VAVASOR,
&quot;Master Knyvet&quot; being her uncle, Mr. Thomas Knevett of the Privy
Chamber.

In a letter written by Nicholas Faunt to Anthony Bacon a day or two
later, we are also told:

&quot;In England of late there hath been a fray between my lord of Oxford
and Mr. Thomas Knevet of the privy chamber, who were both hurt, but my
lord of Oxford more dangerously. You know Mr. Knevet is not meanly
beloved in court: and therefore he is not like to speed ill, whatsoever
the quarrel be.&quot;

Incidentally, it is worthy of note that Mr. Knevett survived to become
one of England's unique heroes. As Sir Thomas Knevett, he led the party
that captured Guy Fawkes red-handed amid the powder kegs in the cellar
of The House of Parliament. In recognition of this feat, he was raised
to the peerage as Baron Knevett of Escrick.

When great men meet on the field of action, the sparks are apt to fly.
This was the case on March 3, 1582. Oxford was so badly wounded that he
seems to have been physically handicapped for the rest of his life. In
letters written to his father-in-law, Lord Burghley, and to his
brother-in-law, Sir Robert Cecil, a few years later, he speaks of &quot;mine
infirmity&quot; which prevents him from getting about quickly on his feet;
again he says: &quot;I am sorry that I have not an able body which might have
served to attend on Her Majesty in the place where she is. . . .&quot;

&lt;&lt;Ogburn records no street fight between Oxford and Thomas VAVASOR.
He reproduces instead a challenge to a duel sent from Thomas VAVASOR
to Oxford, a challenge which Ogburn surmises that Oxford *declined*.
(This challenge is dated 1585, by which time Oxford would have been
34.) The only references Ogburn makes to Oxford's injury concern
Oxford's fight with Thomas *Knyvet*, not Thomas VAVASOR. Here is an
excerpt he reproduces from a letter written to Anthony Bacon:

&quot;In England of late there hath been a fray between my Lord of Oxford

Are you confusing Thomas *VAVASOR* with Thomas *Knyvet*, Anne VAVASOR's
uncle, whose followers engaged in various street skirmishes with
Oxford's men? I assume that you must be, since that's the only armed
quarrel in which Oxford was reported to have ...

King Henry VI, Part ii Act 4, Scene 1SUFFOLK O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder
Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!
Small things make base men proud: this villain here,
Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more
Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.
Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:
It is impossible that I should die
By such a lowly VASSAL as thyself.
Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:
I go of message from the queen to France;
I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.

King Henry VI, Part i Act 4, Scene 1

GLOUCESTER Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!
And perish ye, with your audacious prate!
Presumptuous VASSALS, are you not ashamed
With this immodest clamorous outrage
To trouble and disturb the king and us?

King Richard III Act 1, Scene 4

CLARENCE Erroneous VASSAL!
Act 2, Scene 1

KING EDWARD IV Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
But when your carters or your waiting-VASSALS
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;

King Richard II Act 3, Scene 3

KING RICHARD II [To NORTHUMBERLAND]

Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
That lift your VASSAL hands against my head
And threat the glory of my precious crown.
King Henry IV, Part i Act 3, Scene 2
KING HENRY IV Thou that art like enough, through VASSAL fear,
Base inclination and the start of spleen
To fight against me under Percy's pay,
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
To show how much thou art degenerate.

King Henry IV, Part ii Act 4, Scene 5

PRINCE HENRY Let God for ever keep it from my head
And make me as the poorest VASSAL is
That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!

King Henry V Act 3, Scene 2

PISTOL The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound:
Knocks go and come; God's VASSALS drop and die;
And sword and shield,
In bloody field,
Doth win immortal fame.

Act 3, Scene 5

KING OF FRANCE Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
Upon the valleys, whose low VASSAL seat
The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:
Go down upon him, you have power enough,
And in a captive chariot into Rouen
Bring him our prisoner.

Love's Labour's Lost Act 1, Scene 1

FERDINAND [Reads] 'that shallow VASSAL,'--

Act 4, Scene 1

BOYET 'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
commiseration on thy heroical VASSAL!
Act 4, Scene 3

BIRON Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
Bows not his VASSAL head and strucken blind
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
That is not blinded by her majesty?

Measure for Measure Act 5, Scene 1

ISABELLA O, give me pardon,
That I, your VASSAL, have employ'd and pain'd
Your unknown sovereignty!

All's Well That Ends Well Act 1, Scene 3

HELENA Pardon, madam;
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
I am from humble, he from honour'd name;
No note upon my parents, his all noble:
My master, my dear lord he is; and I
His servant live, and will his VASSAL die:
He must not be my brother.

Act 2, Scene 1

HELENA Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
What husband in thy power I will command:
Exempted be from me the arrogance
To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
My low and humble name to propagate
With any branch or image of thy state;
But such a one, thy VASSAL, whom I know
Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.

Cymbeline Act 5, Scene 5

IMOGEN He is a Roman; no more kin to me
Than I to your highness; who, being born your VASSAL,
Am something nearer.

The Tempest Act 1, Scene 2

It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
and make a VASSAL of him.

KING LEAR O, VASSAL! miscreant!

What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
But in my bosom shall she never come,
To make my heart her VASSAL.

Act 5, Scene 2

CLEOPATRA Pray you, tell him
I am his fortune's VASSAL, and I send him
The greatness he has got.
Coriolanus Act 3, Scene 2

CORIOLANUS I muse my mother
Does not approve me further, who was wont
To call them woollen VASSALS, things created
To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
When one but of my ordinance stood up
To speak of peace or war.

The Rape of Lucrece
Stanza 87
And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,
Obdurate VASSALS fell exploits effecting,

O, be remember'd, no outrageous thing
From VASSAL actors can be wiped away;
Then kings' misdeeds cannot be hid in clay.

Stanza 96

'So let thy thoughts, low VASSALS to thy state'--
No more,' quoth he; 'by heaven, I will not hear thee:

Stanza 195

But long she thinks till he return again,
And yet the duteous VASSAL scarce is gone.
The weary time she cannot entertain,
For now 'tis stale to sigh, to weep, and groan:
So woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan,
That she her plaints a little while doth stay,
Pausing for means to mourn some newer way.

Art, by extension this may be the case in Jacobean examples, but drawn from
earlier references there is a different sense:

VAVASOR: A kind of inferior gentry, one who held his lands in fealty.
[Anglo-Norman]

Bothe knightes and vavasour,
This damisels love paramour.
/Arthour and Merline, p. 320

And sychen he hath had grete honoure,
That furste was a pore vavesowre.
/MS. Cantab. Ff. ii. 38, f. 202

Of unknown significance is other A.N. prefix, VY, as VYCE: Countenance, and
VYSERNE: A visor or mask.

Older word-stems are from A.Sax.:
WIVERE: A serpent.
And I thought you might like
WIVVER: To quiver, to shake.
WYE: A man
WYESE: Men
WRYDE: Covered

King Henry VI, Part ii Act 4, Scene 1SUFFOLK O that I were a god, to shoot

Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more

Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:

Originally the A.N. word VASSALAGE meant: Valour, courage. It is unclear
when there was a change of use. It appear to owe nothing to WASSAIL, which
is A.Sax; to be in health, originally wæs hæl, ¡ ws hl. A drink composed of
apples sugar and ale was spelt Wesseyle in MS Cantab. Ff. v. 48, f. 49

Well, I seem to have struck a chord!

What exactly do you think of this, Teebis?

Or what do you think of Oxford's dark lady the paramour Vavasour?
