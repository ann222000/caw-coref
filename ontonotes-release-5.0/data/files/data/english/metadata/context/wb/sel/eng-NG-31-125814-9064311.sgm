George,

From googling the term &quot;razor wire&quot; it would appear that the stuff can be
used on domestic properties by &quot;Joe Bloggs&quot; legally.  There are a few
caveats though:

1 - The owner can be sued by anyone who has been hurt by the stuff - whether
it be an innocent person, trespasser or criminal.

2 - Councils can object to it for a number of reasons and order its removal.

3 - If you are a tenant of a property - you can be evicted for using the
stuff.

4 - Owners has a 'duty of care' to prevent anyone from being hurt on their
property see this:

&quot;Using barbed/razor wire and broken glass in order to stop people getting in
to your home is not advisable. You are making yourself liable to civil
action as you owe a duty of care to ensure that visitors to your property
are reasonably safe.  As absurd as it may seem you also owe a lower duty of
care to trespassers&quot;.

Either you want to put it up or you don't - YOU make your own mind up and do
it instead of talking about it.
I would have razor wire electrified.  Providing it can't be touched by
accident and is within your property who is to know apart from a burglar.
I wouldn't stick a sign up warning a burglar - if he complained he would
find himself in the boot of a car being driven miles away before being

I'm with you all the way, if someone is on my property without permission I
should be the one who decides what rights they have.

However the country is f*cked up and if someone harms themselves on your
razor wire you will probably end up giving them your hard earned.

Oddly enough when I lived on a council estate in Surrey years back, the
local plod suggested we added something spiky around the fence tops and the
hedge. We did, it worked. Short of electrification, it could safely be said
that we went to town on it.

I think, in the more notorious areas, you may find a refreshing disparity
between the official line and what the police will actually
advise/tolerate.

Not that my estate was fundamentally that notorious, but relative to the
rest of south Surrey it was.

I think maybe people are getting the occupiers' liability thing a bit
out of proportion. So, a burglar can sue you for injuries caused by
the razor wire. What's the worst injury he's likely to incur? A nasty
nick to his little finger. The claim for damages is not going to
bankrupt you (and in fact just won't happen).

Short of a concert pianist attempting to rob you and cutting all his
fingers off in a freak accident, meaning no earning capacity for the
next forty years, I think you can forget compensation claims for razor-
wire injuries.

There speaks someone who has not had a close encounter with razor wire.
Unlike barbed wire razor wire is designed to slice and cut so how about a

I had to complete a detailed incident report, send a copy of my risk
assessment and detail what steps I had taken to prevent a recurrence, for
the Health and Safety Executive after someone trespassed on my land, pricked
his finger while skip diving and complained to the Police that the skip
contained sharp objects. To be fair, both the Police Officer who turned up
to inspect the skip and the HSE inspector thought the whole thing a total
waste of time, but they had to follow procedures once a report had been
lodged. I wouldn't want to do the paperwork if someone cut themselves on
razor wire.

Since we're going wildly off-topic I have to say - rubbish! Human
rights are in principle rights of the citizen against the state. They
exist to stop the state abusing its powerful position against all of
us. It's when the state starts accusing you of being a criminal and of
breaking state-made laws that human rights are at their most
important. To my mind that's the mark of a civilised society. If you
want to live somewhere where they torture you when you get on the
wrong side of the law and stone you and amputate bits of you when
you're convicted I believe parts of the middle east and asia might
suit you. You can festoon your house with razor wire there to your
heart's content and shoot the little bleeders on sight, ask questions
later.

Cheers!

I'm not so sure. Tell people criminals have no rights is giving them cart

PS I should just add that in the particular instance we're talking
about, the law about keeping your property safe for visitors,
including trespassers, has got nothing whatsoever to do with human
rights. Most of what the Human Rights Act gets blamed for has nothing
to do with the Human Rights Act. The rule we're talking about comes
from the principle of occupiers' liability, which predates the Human
Rights Act by a long way.

Along with &quot;data protection&quot; and &quot;heath and safety&quot;, &quot;human rights&quot; is
used as a scapegoat for all sorts of things.

Human Rights regulate relationships between citizen and state, not
between private citizens.

Indeed. My father used to work for a garage and about 50 years ago it was
broken into. The burglar or whatever fell down an open inspection pit and
broke his leg. The owner was prosecuted. The pit should have been covered
up when not actually in use. I dunno under which act the prosecution was
brought but it was long before the days of H&amp;S. Which in many ways is
designed to protect the employer from prosecution rather than aid the
worker.

Actually, I'd scrap large parts of the law; everything that seeks to protect
people from themselves or interferes with contracts between consenting adults. I
really don't care what other people do, so long as they leave me alone, and I
genuinely don't understand why people want to poke their noses into other
people's lives  - or in the case of politicians, run their lives for them, using
my money.

I think we are vastly overgoverned. But I do not see any chance of any
improvement any time soon; the output of Government being more Government.

Many seem to believe it should be ok to kill or maim a burglar. Others
might think the same applies to someone who scratches your car. Others -
perhaps to someone using a mobil phone in a car or smoking in a building.
So the only fair answer is the same rights for all and leave punishment to
the law.

Of course. That's the law's job. And far better than some self righteous
'hero' who is likely to get the wrong person. As as happened many many

Keying an expensive car could cost more in monetary terms to fix than your

Money, yes.  Distress?  Well, I'd be pretty cross if someone keyed my
car.  I'd be livid if it was written off.

But I bet I'd be in a better state than a pensioner who has been gagged,
tied up and left on the floor for hours praying for rescue, even if not
much was stolen.

It may or may not depending on the person. Having your life savings 'lost'
by a bank can be traumatic too - and something you may not ever get over.
Would you personally put the board of that organisation in hospital too?

Perhaps I'm the odd one out.

If someone breaks into my house they'd probably be met by someone able
to defend themselves.  I'd survive being cold and tied up on the floor
for a few hours better than most pensioners too.  (No heart problems or
rheumatism for a start!)

So, yes, it's worse.
