Hello,

Anybody know if it is possible to read 5000v pulses on a digital
scope, the TDS 1002 from Tektronic.
I have this unit, taking the voltage from a 12v car battery and
supposedly giving off pulses of 5000v to 6000v. I want to see what
kind of pulses.
If it is possible , how do I go about it.??
I did test the device and i did not see anything on the scope, then i
found out my probe was deffective by using  a second probe and testing
that probe on a battery. Did it break my probe or was it coincidence.

thanks,

ken

By the way, I was putting my multimeter to the device (and set to Ac
voltage) and it was reading 270v. The probe i use (P2220) can take up
to 300v.

**  Buy  10  x  2kV ceramic caps of 100pF each   -  wire them all in a
series string and put that inside a plastic tube.

Connect a 10 nF cap ( say 500 V)  across the tip and ground of your scope
probe.

Connect the string of caps between the source of pulses and the probe tip.

Ground the scope to the common of the pulse source.

You have just made a 1000:1 capacitive divider probe.

The input load is only 10pF.

6 kV pulses will show as 6 volts ones on the scope.

Ken,

If you we using a standard X1 or X10 probe, you may have damaged it.
Fortunately, it appears your scope input was robust enough to not be
damaged, though you may have to fully test it (all voltage ranges and
various frequencies).
You could purchase a X100 probe. Check with you favorite supplier.

Good luck,
Richard

He is talking about short duration pulses.I am not sure exactly how
short the duration is ,but if the input source is a car battery,its
got to be very short duration indeed.
In such a case,the parasitic resistance of the 10 100pf capacitors
might prevent the final capcitor from charging fully.
So a better idea may be to use a voltage divider that divides the
voltage in a 1:100 ratio(say 10ohm and 10Kohm).it would do exactly the
same thing as the above,but has 2 advantages
1)requires only 2 components to do the same job
2)this scheme would work even if the pulses have very short duration
BUT make sure that the resistors you use can dissipate enough heat(i.e
they are big enough) as the peak current of the ciruit would be about
0.5 to 0.6 amps.

stuff after your colorful reply :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

So far as i know ,resistors DO NOT have a maximum voltage  rating.They
ONLY have a MAXIMUM POWER rating.
For a given value of current ,the maximum voltage is given by (Power
Rating/Current)
Therefore you can have a large maximum voltage(for a given power
dissipation) simply by decreasing I appropriately.
If a voltage divider is used with R1=10Mohm and R2=100Kohm ,then the
ratio of voltages is 1000:1.
the current is approximately V/(total Resistance)=(5000V)/
(10.1Mohm)=0.5ma(approx)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ** Will drastically load down the 6 kV pulse generator and totally  *fuck*
&gt; the measurement.

A current of 0.5 milliamperes is unlikely to do that,though a current
of 0.5 amps might.The resistance values are therefore to be
incresed.In this respect you were right.
The power dissipated is VxI=5000x0.0005=2.5W
resistors with 2.5 watt  power dissipation are not rare.

Capacitors DO have parasitic resistances.And they DO take time to
charge and discharge,unlike resistors which respond to voltage changes
instantaneously.Therefore for signals lasting for very short
durations ,capacitors are not the ideal solution .Because of this
parasitic resistance there will always be a time delay between the
output and input of a capacitor network,which becomes significant for
input signals of very short duration.
And this is not &quot;bollocks&quot;.It is basic circuit theory.

i did'nt know that resistors have a maximum voltage.It made sense for
capacitors to have a breakdown voltage because above it the dielectric
medium between the capacitor terminals would break down.But if that is
correct then the voltage divider circuit cannot work.
As i have said above ther is always a time delay between output and
input of any capacitor network.The motivation of using resistors in
place of capacitors is to eliminate this &quot;distortion&quot; of the
signal(due to this time delay).
The whole idea of using a resistor network was based on the assumption
that the circuit that generates the 5000v pulses can supply atleast a
few milliamperes to the load at 5000v.Some circuits i looked up on the
net can do that,But i dont know which circuit the original poster is
using.
And cant you post your replies in halfway decent language?Its easy of

The input waveform to the capacitor network is a rapidly rising and
falling pulse.
this wave can thus be thought of having 3 parts;a rising edge,a stable
section,and a falling edge.
The current through the equivalent capacitance of the network is C(dV/
dt).
The rising part of the input voltage wave can be modelled as a
positively going ramp signal.The current would then be just the slope
of the ramp,which would be very high.So essentially,in the rising part
of the input voltage,a very high current flows through the capacitor
network.But thats not the real problem.
The stable section of the input  causes zero current(dV/dt is 0)
But the falling edge will lead to a HUGE reverse current through the
network that ultimately flows in the pulse generator circuitry
too.This can completely destroy the generator if you dont design for
it.
So how would you take care of this reverse current?
And all this is assuming ideal elements.

I asked my profeesor about this question,and so this should resolve
the problem once and for all.
If a voltage divider is used with a ratio of 1:1000,and sufficiently
large values of R1 and R2,the current drawn from the input,and hence
the power dissipation can be made small(see calculations above)
As regarding phil's issue that the capacitance of the CRO strobe will
cause time delay issues,the problem does exist.However it is not as
sever as it might first seem because the thevenin equivalent ckt
across the capacitor only has a Resistance of R2.Since R2 is
relatively smaller,the RC product will be not be &quot;too high&quot;.AND
RESISTORS DO NO HAVE A MAXIMUM VOLTAGE LIMIT(unless the voltage is
large enough and the gap between the resistor terminals is small
enough to cause arcing) .They only have a max power dissipation,whichj
has been shown in the above calculations to be achievable.The only way
to destroy a resistor is to burn it down,which only happens because of
excess POWER DISSIPATION,not excess VOLTAGE.
This ckt has the advantage that the peak current is limited to a very
small value.Hence the input source is never loaded too much.Loading is
ALWAYS with respect to current ,not with respect to resistance.
A variation of this method is used in chip design to figure out
frequencies of very fast clocks(ghz) without loading the input source.

As regards the second method,of using a capacitive divider,it has the
advantage that the RC product is much smaller than in the previous
case,but there is a HUGE reverse current which might cause problems
with the source.It also draws a huge current from the source in the
rising edge of the input waveform.
So the problem boils down to this.What are the characteristics of the
input source?Can it sinmk and source a large current in a short
time(2nd method),or can it only supply a small current(1st method).
This solely determines what method should be used.
Hope this helps the original poster.Enough of flaming on this thread :)

Phil you bloody know nothing idiot
you think you are the world's greatest authority on circuits while
throughout your posts you have been doing nothing but criticizing
arbit points.you have no idea how circuits are made.probably you've
learnt what you have from the covers of some book
your moronic mind never answered the questions posed.you should go and
see a psychologist.there's been enough of your bullshit on this thread.

i just did a google search on the address from which this guy phil has
been posting from.i discovered that pretty much all his posts on
forums were full of obscenities and mindless criticisms of other
people.his google account seems to have been banned for the same
reason
in retrospect i feel really sorry at losing my cool.sorry if i
offended any well-meaning folk.
but the reference to my professor ,and the derogatory reference to
hinduism was the last straw.henceforth i shall just ignore this guy.

A &quot;posturing, terminally smug, wog PIC programmer &quot;?AFAIK only the
last two words are true.But maybe i delude myself :)
The only halfway decent objection you've made in the last bunch of
posts is the breakdown voltage of a resistor due to arcing.There's an
obvious way to solve it.Put 10 1Mohm reistors for R1 instead of one
11Mohm resistors.

&quot;trivial&quot;.really?
1 microvolt is a trivial voltage.Is'nt it?try applying it to your
cellphone antenna.Your phone will never work again.
Whether a load is &quot;small&quot; or &quot;large&quot; is entirely dependent on the
source.Which is why i asked the guy to provide more info about his
pulse generator circuit.

But of course you wont provide a reasonable answer.Thats too much of a
PITA is'nt it .
I'm sick and tired of your bigotry.Grow up.Get out of your cosy little
home.See the world.It is'nt the way you've stereotyped it .

Don't miss the essential facts because of anger.

Resistors do indeed have a maximum voltage limit.
http://home.earthlink.net/~jimlux/hv/resistor.htm

Here's some datasheets:

http://www.panasonic.com/industrial/components/pdf/AOA0000CE18.pdf
http://www.vishay.com/docs/31018/cmfind.pdf

In any high voltage (&gt; ~250V) application, you need to take
this into account.

Resistors can be destroyed by both arcing and by exceeding their
power rating.
