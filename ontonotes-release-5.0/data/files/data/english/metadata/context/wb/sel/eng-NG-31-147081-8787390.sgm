Khaled just checked in Blueprint CSS for the Admin section, under
system/admin/css which got me thinking a bit (uh-oh).

Is that the best location for it? isolating it inside admin/ means a
couple of things:

*) Habari admin specific customizations of the Blueprint CSS Framework
will be isolated to the admin section.

*) The shipped Blueprint CSS Framework will only work for the admin
section, and any themes developed using it needs to provide their own
copy of Blueprint.

Habari already bundles jQuery, and thats generally available for theme
designers to use, why should this be different for Blueprint? If the
admin section needs specific edits of the Blueprint files, that could
be done by using overrides in admin.css (It would require that the
load order of the css files change a bit, but I would think thats a
minor issue).

Basically my idea here is to be able to say: &quot;Habari comes prepackaged
with the hotness of jQuery, and the cleanliness of Blueprint CSS ready
for theme developers&quot; :-)

/shared was mentioned on #habari (morydd I believe), sounded good to
me.  Things like Simple Pie could also go there one could assume, if
it were decided to be bundled with core.

I honestly don't care, but creating a top-level directory for &quot;third

We should have a /contrib directory, but I don't think that this is
contrib. Contrib is stuff like plugins that come in from the
community, or themes that are contributed by the community. A third-

-1 for using blueprint. css at all
-2 for bundling it
-3 for saying *its for theme developers*

I asked about this previously. The answer I was given was that anyone
writing up the admin could use any tool they like.
Fair enough. But this is way beyond that. Way beyond.
My objection to this is that it is generally immaterial what I
or the rest of us do / do not do with it.
We do not have to use it.
But a lot of folk will follow what we do.
They will use it as a base.
They will assume that Blueprint is somehow best of breed.
It is not.
Some of it is just convenient but is unnecessarily prolix.
Some of it is highly controversial.
eg: the typography schemata.
So: if we start saying: well we can edit it
Then why use the darn thing in the first place?
It is a rattlesnake.
If it gets out we will never recapture it :)
If we can't write our own CSS we shouldn't be in this business.
And nor should themers.
Just my 2 cents.

Thanks. I recently started doing a theme, using blueprint. I see now
that I probably should have used FrontPage instead.

Man, there is so much attitude/feelings/whatever in these discussions
that I don't think anything good will come of it at all. Sorry, but I
just tried running with the ball after blueprint was introduced.

Well I am sorry that you feel like that. But Blueprint has been
committed to trunk without any prior discussion.
And in sofar as I raised it previously I was misled by the answer.
I am entitled to say that.
Blueprint in my opinion is wrong for Habari.
I do mind explaining why.
But I do not mean to sound as if I have an *attitude*.
I don't.
Maybe its just the way I write. My bad.
But if any one had asked prior to the committing I and a couple
of other folk could have been better prepared to argue on the merits.
This is a fait accompli. OK.
But it is very very harmful.
Please do not say you were not warned.

Nevermind. I didn't mean specifically your comments, but the whole
&quot;admin/dashboard&quot; discussion seems to be going haywire. The language
used certainly doesn't help.

I don't have an opinion on blueprint vs whatever, I've used blueprint
a bit and I like it. Thats all. I have never entered a discussion
regarding the html and/or css or anything, simply because it's not my
field of expertise. I dabble in it, thats it.

Please, everyone, get your acts together and try to unite on something
instead of bashing each other on a mailinglist. If someone has
specific ideas on what should be done, come forward with them in a non-
attacking manner. Try to work as a community, not as single entities
with your own personal agendas.
&lt;/soapbox&gt;

Yes, it has.  And it can easily be backed out.  We had the whole of
Smarty in our repository in the early days: it landed there without much
discussion.  After discussion, it was removed.

The fact that something is in the repository is not indicative that it
will stay there.

The fact that something landed in the repository without discussion is a
good item for discussion: should that have happened?  Maybe not.  If
that's your opinion, why not put forward a positive spin, rather than a
negative one?

&quot;In the future, can folks please open a ticket or start a mailing list
discussion before adding third-party libraries to the repository?&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Blueprint in my opinion is wrong for Habari.
&gt; I do mind explaining why.
">

Pity.  I'd like to learn more.  Even though CSS and design are far
outside my skillset, I still like to be able to speak intelligently
about the whole of Habari.

When we talk to folks at the upcoming Ohio LinuxFest, I'd like to be
able to share with them why we are or are not keeping Blueprint.
&quot;Because khaled likes it&quot; and &quot;Because root doesn't like it&quot; are both
unacceptable explanations.

We coders explain ourselves to one another, and to the larger community.
We explain why we do and do not use certain functions, or why we tackle
a certain problem in a certain way.  I hope that the design community
within Habari can be as courteous to us as we try to be to them.

So: what's bad about Blueprint?  What _specifically_ is wrong with
including it in Habari?  What alternatives can you propose in place of
Blueprint?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But if any one had asked prior to the committing I and a couple
&gt; of other folk could have been better prepared to argue on the merits.

We're not always going to ask permission before we do things.  I think
it's perfectly okay for a passionate contributor to occasionally get
fired up and DO something without presenting it to the group first.  We
can talk about it civilly and constructively after the fact.  I don't
want this to be the normal modus operandi, but I also don't want our
design-by-committee to develop bland, soulless software.  :)

There have been several prior examples of this.  We've gotten through it
because we all have the same goal in mind: to make Habari as great as it
can be.

Ah. I don't recall advocating any of those three things, so

Sorry that I stepped into an existing conversation that I apparently

And we need a contrib/ directory.

But regarding blueprint - I can't honestly say I have the vaguest
idea what it is, and the design aspects tend not to interest me.

I agree -- I'm not really fond of the bickering.  I think if we're
going to move beyond arguing then we need to hear specific objections
to what is being proposed.  To that end, I will offer why I think
Blueprint was chosen for use for our admin.

Blueprint, although obviously not complete, seems like an excellent
start to a useful generic CSS framework.  It immediately offers a good
deal of layout control without having to hand-code everything.  By
coupling something like Blueprint to control layout positioning and
grouping with a some code on the back-end, we can provide a very
flexible admin layout with the potential for modification via plugin.

While it may be possible to use custom CSS to control the admin - as
Root pointed out, if we can't write our own CSS, then we have no
business here - custom CSS does not provide us the flexibility to
rearrange content elements dynamically without altering the CSS
definition itself.  If such an alternative solution exists, nobody has
suggested it.

Blueprint is also another open-source project, which means we don't
have to maintain it ourselves.  We can contribute any beneficial
changes back to the Blueprint project, but can also trust that others
working on the project who have concerns about how it operates will be
working on improving it as well.  We can benefit from these
improvements without focusing all of our efforts on them.

There are obviously problems with the library.  It is not perfect.  I
think it can be improved to the point where it would be acceptable for
use, and I think there are enough people in the Blueprint project and
here that this can be done before our 1.0 release.  You may disagree.
That is fine.  But if you can't put forth the effort to even explain
why, then complaining serves no purpose whatsoever.

If people would focus on fixing what problems it has instead of
complaining that it does have problems, things would be accomplished.
If there is an alternative that accomplishes the goals I've outlined,
we are not married to Blueprint.  I would prefer a superior Habari to
saying that we use Blueprint.

We do not need to have discussion about every item prior to committing
it to the repository.  Sometimes, the only way to see how a thing
works is to have it worked out in code.  This doesn't mean that we
can't back something out if it really isn't working or isn't
appropriate.  But to do that, we need some coherent argument against
it that can convince others of the case.  So far, Blueprint looks to
be working reasonably well.  I suppose that the major issue is
something underlying how it works, but I'm not sure what that is.

I am very interested in hearing why Blueprint is not right for Habari.
I understand that if it is wrong, there are implications that we'd be
encouraging community use of something that may not be appropriate,
which I certainly wouldn't want to do.  But I don't understand what's
wrong with it.  Please help.

">

Nothing is a fait accompli until we release code. We are in CTR -
Commit Then Review. People (and I'm not at all talking about just you
- I've observed this from a significant number of people) need to
stop reacting like every commit is a major decision that was arrived
at without their input. Seriously, it's a really harmful attitude,
because it makes people afraid to commit experimental code for fear
of offending someone.

CTR - Commit Then Review - means that folks are at liberty to commit
stuff, and everyone else is at liberty to discuss the commit after
the fact.

I begin to grow weary of the hurt feelings that happen each time
someone makes a major commit and other folks feel left out of the
decision process. This &quot;please do not say you were not warned&quot; bit is
a good example of that. Being warned is not important. What is
important is that if someone has a compelling reason for a commit to
be reverted, they present it without attacking someone else's
character. Again, I'm not talking specifically about you here - the
business of attacking character goes back to the very early days of
the project, and seems to come over wholesale from the WordPress
community at times, dragging in issues from perhaps years ago. It's
annoying.

Because we are in CTR, stuff is going to get committed to trunk
without any prior discussion. That's what trunk is for. Commit, then
review. We are in the review bit now, and it's not a fait accompli -
this is how things are *supposed* to work. And commits are really
easy to revert if/when they are determined, by consensus, to have
been the wrong decision. But it would be a shame of something got
reverted due to someone feeling that they'd hurt someone else's
feelings, rather than due to consensus.

Yes, as Skippy says, it's good to have tickets and discussions. It's
also good to have people feel the ability to experiment, and,
frankly, that's what branches are for. But it's good to have a
balance between these things.

Please know that I I'm not talking directly to you, Root. This is
just the message from the thread that I happened to click &quot;reply&quot; to.
And I'm not reacting solely to this one issue. I have no opinion on
&quot;Blueprint&quot;, and I'm not even entirely sure what it is. This is a
message that has been building in my mind over the last 4 or 5 weeks,
and this seemed like a good moment to let it out.

Well it seems to me that this is an off the shelf solution for a
problem which does not exist.
We can't delegate writing our own CSS to a whole bunch of third party
strangers no matter who they are or what they do.
Blueprint has its uses, ie large (very large) sites. Our admin is only
one page albeit intensely dynamic.
And its target audience is folk who can not do it themselves or do not
need a custom jpob.
That does not include us. We are building an application not a web
site anyway.
Some of the very bits we need the most are not in the blueprint in any
detail anyway.
At least not in a form I am comfortable with.
Forms and all things therein are the toughest item in CSS from the
cross platform pov.
There is some good stuff in Blueprint.
But adopt it wholesale. No.
And the typography section is exceptionally poor.
And it is so poor it knocks my confidence in the rest of it.
It is new.
Untested.
In development.
I can not see a single reason to contemplate it.
But I can see why some folk find it superficially appealing.

You misunderstand the audience of Blueprint.  It's for people who
don't care to waste their time fiddling with little details just to
get a flexible layout up and running quickly.  A custom job may be

but it will likely not be as flexible as we require.  I see no need to

The more specific you can be in your emails, the smoother the

others can evaluate those items and respond in turn.

What are your specific professional differences?  Based on your
professional experience, in what specific, measurable ways is Blueprint
deficient?  What alternatives do you suggest in order to solve the
issues for which Blueprint is being considered?

I'm not entirely sure what that sentence means: are you commenting on
the discussion process in which we are currently engaged, or are you
commenting on the use of the Blueprint framework instead of writing our
own CSS?

If you're railing against the iterative discussion process in which pros
and cons are discussed factually and dispassionately, there's little
else we have to discuss.  The meritocracy model we pursue applies to all
contributions, not just PHP code.  If you are unable or unwilling to
engage in a meaningful discussion to work toward consensus, then Habari
may not be a good project for you.

If you're railing against the use of Blueprint for Habari, then I will
wait patiently for your explanation of its technical deficiencies, and I
will carefully evaluate as best I can your proposals for solutions to
the problems for which Blueprint is being considered.

Cheers,
Scott

Yes, this is a very useful question, and one which has multiple
answers, but I'll try to give my perspective, at least, on this.

One answer is that folks who are doing a major new functional
implementation need to make a branch and do that work there. I get
very frustrated, as do many of us, when a HUGE chunk of something is
committed all at once. It's not *just* about being blind-sided. It's
about it being impossible to code-review huge commits. Incremental
commits can be reviewed. Big ones simply never get reviewed, and so
contain more bugs.

Now, I've observed that artists like to commit a complete
implementation, whereas coders like to commit in smaller pieces. I
imagine there are good reasons for this. It could be that no artist
wants to have 100 unwashed strangers saying &quot;that needs more shadow,
and that needs more yellow&quot; while they try to work. I don't know. I'm
not an artist.

So, what constitutes a commit? Well, ideally it is one 'svn ci', but
if folks are waiting forever between commits, it's hard to reasonably
review.

This is why I am such a strong advocate of branches. Folks don't like
to commit non-working code to trunk. I can respect that, even when I
don't always agree. But if folks can work in a branch, that gives
visibility without destabilizing trunk. And branches are cheap. If
the experiment doesn't work out, then no harm is done. If it does,
then you merge it into trunk and move on.

I know that some folks don't like to work with someone &quot;watching over
their shoulder.&quot; But that is a necessity in Open Source, and it's how
we keep sanity, it's how we avoid effort overlap, it's how we
determine whether progress is being made, and whether it's in an
appropriate (whatever that means) direction. More frequent commits
lead to less arguments and hurt feelings, in the long run, because
people feel that they're in the loop, they aren't surprised, and
major blunders can be headed off before they become a big deal.

It's a way to include some other project's SVN code in your project.
So, if we end up relying on Blueprint, there's no reason for us to keep
and manage our own local copy of their source tree inside of our source

One potential problem there, is that if we do that and blueprint break
something it cascades down to Habari too. Also, if we are modifying it to
our needs, we can't rely on externals unless we override it somewhere.

I'm not opposed to including it, I'm just pointing it out.

We can use svn externals to point to particular versions of their
stuff. Granted, this does reduce the benefit of doing externals at
all, but is a potential solution while their tree is broken.

I'll try and keep this as quick and succinct as possible.

Why Blueprint? I played around with it and was genuinely surprised by the
speed at which I came to grips with it and how it works. It made the process
of placing things in the exact place that I wanted a trivial process.

Oh sure it's lacking in lots of areas (like the aforementioned forms etc)
but that's not what I was intending it's use for. I don't ever expect BP to
be the css of Habari and that's it. What the 3 files do is enable us to
create and position things clearly in this early developing stage, where
things are constantly changing. Areas are being added, features are changing
shape and the requirements are evolving. BP allows us to be flexible in that
manner. Changing the grid sizes is as simple as tweaking where the classes
are called in every div. The beauty of this approach for me is that it will
look the part from this very early stage of development.

Do I think BP is here to stay? No. In all honestly a LOT of BP isn't really
for us. However the important thing is to take things that BP has done well
and use it as best we can in our application. The code is there for everyone
to modify and remove and tweak and add. I've been tweaking the files
slightly and I honestly thought that people would see this benefit as well.

For those that believe that I did this because I wanted and didn't consult
anyone, that's not the case. I did consult the other developers. Some were
interested, while others were apprehensive. It's the exact same scenario
that came about when I proposed tiddlywiki for our manual. Maybe naively I
thought that because we're using SVN that would could turn the clock if it
was felt that I'd fucked things up bad. As Scott said, it can be removed if
it's really becoming obtrusive. My impression is that I can see a great deal
of promise in what it's provided to the aesthetics of the admin, something
which I have been meaning to help sort out for a good long time. Maybe I
should have consulted everyone on the mailing list first. To be honest I
didn't think it would create such a massive backlash for it's inclusion.
Once again naive on my part.

To try and further illustrate the point about flexibility of BP, the
attached jpg shows what the mockups looked like that I started looking at on
Sunday. It's pretty darn close to what we have right now, but you'll notice
that things have been tweaked accordingly, which is to be expected when new
areas are put forward (like the recent activity log). With BP I was able to
accommodate this without much concern.

Don't like the typography? I hear you there, but we can sort it out, it's
not that complicated a stylesheet. We are definitely not beholden to BP.
Like I said, lets take the good stuff and discard the stuff we're not happy
with. Or hell some might think that it would be even better to put back to
the BP project which is in and of itself another open source project.

Now that Khaled has posted on his understanding of what regards as the
limitations of Blueprint I am a bit more comfortable with this.
My issue - if I had one - was not that I am anti Blueprint entirely.
But I am in favour of hand written custom made CSS built from the
ground up by us and for us.
I can't see why anyone could not want that. If I open the bonnet of a
Rolls Royce I do not expect to see a Chrysler
engine.:)
This could be a highly technical - and tedious discussion for people
not familiar with the nitty gritty but here is one example. In order
to clear the floats Blueprint uses a clearfix class which employs a
pseudo class of :after. That is  from the CSS 2.1 recommendation. If
we use it we are commited in our most critical area - a stable layout
- to being unable to support non CSS 2.1 browsers. There may be a case
for that but I am not buying it myself. But where are wrong in my view
is to head off down this path without a clear determination of what
our expectations are vis a vis legacy platforms and a better
understanding of what the consequences of those choices are.

I could go through it here line by line but what is the point?
In my view not only is the typography suspect because it gives very
poor cross platform performance including IE 7 but it leads to
instability in both the width and height dimensions because the
Blueprint does not follow the best of breed conventions in this regard
either.

This may be a frustrating process for real programmers who basically
speaking just need to get things running.
Unfortunately CSS implementation is so erratic that interface design
is a snake pit of choice and compromise.
It is rarely perfect. It is not easy. Some folks do more of it than
others.

Finally if we need stuff ourselves that is obviously going to be
project specific.
Blueprint is generic. Our lives are complicated enough without getting
into other open source projects
which have completely different objectives. I would not want to get
into code exchange.
And the idea of svn to the Blueprint code horrifies me.
I have always wished - fervently - that I was a better writer. I
rarely mean to offend anybody.
But if I do - then I apologise.

&gt; &gt; We can't delegate writing our own CSS to a whole bunch of third party
&gt; &gt; strangers no matter who they are or what they do.

&gt; We are not.  Blueprint is a library, just like any of a number of PHP
&gt; libraries we might use for the Habari internals.  We still need to
&gt; supply our own stylesheets to accomplish specific tasks.  Blueprint
&gt; simply makes initial positioning and layout easier.

&gt; &gt; Blueprint has its uses, ie large (very large) sites. Our admin is only
&gt; &gt; one page albeit intensely dynamic.

&gt; Our admin is multiple pages.  Our admin is also intended to be more
&gt; dynamic than it currently appears.  The CSS provided by Blueprint
&gt; could also be used by people designing their own web sites, which
&gt; could be large, although I don't see validity in the claim that
&gt; Blueprint is only for very large sites.  It's ok for very large sites
&gt; but not for small ones?  I don't follow that logic.

&gt; &gt; And its target audience is folk who can not do it themselves or do not
&gt; &gt; need a custom jpob.
&gt; &gt; That does not include us. We are building an application not a web
&gt; &gt; site anyway.

&gt; You misunderstand the audience of Blueprint.  It's for people who
&gt; don't care to waste their time fiddling with little details just to
&gt; get a flexible layout up and running quickly.  A custom job may be
&gt; better at simple positioning/layout than employing Blueprint alone,
&gt; but it will likely not be as flexible as we require.  I see no need to
&gt; follow a &quot;not invented here&quot; path for a tool that seems to be doing
&gt; the job to our needs.

&gt; &gt; Some of the very bits we need the most are not in the blueprint in any
&gt; &gt; detail anyway.
&gt; &gt; At least not in a form I am comfortable with.
&gt; &gt; Forms and all things therein are the toughest item in CSS from the
&gt; &gt; cross platform pov.

&gt; What Blueprint does not provide or does not do that we would want done
&gt; is something we'll need to include separately.  We obviously can't use
&gt; Blueprint for forms, and we will have to build that separately.  I
&gt; think that this is not a blocker for using Blueprint, since you could
&gt; say this about any stylesheet that only provides layout.

&gt; &gt; There is some good stuff in Blueprint.
&gt; &gt; But adopt it wholesale. No.
&gt; &gt; And the typography section is exceptionally poor.
&gt; &gt; And it is so poor it knocks my confidence in the rest of it.

&gt; I agree that the typography is poor.  It can be improved.  You are in
&gt; a unique position to sculpt the formation of this typography.  Offer
&gt; fixes that we can send to Blueprint to make both it and Habari better.

&gt; &gt; It is new.
&gt; &gt; Untested.
&gt; &gt; In development.

&gt; As is Habari.

&gt; After we've outlined its clear advantages to our goals with the
&gt; expectation that the rough spots can be improved, saying solely that
&gt; you're not comfortable with it is simply not enough to sway me against
&gt; it.

&gt; An effective message would begin &quot;Here are the emotionally detached
&gt; reasons why Habari should not use Blueprint, including clear examples
&gt; of the problem areas.&quot;  Less than this is not really useful.  An
&gt; example of how we could do it without Blueprint, while interesting, is
&gt; also not useful because, as I understand your proposal, it does not
&gt; address the flexibility required by the admin.  Perhaps I wasn't clear
&gt; in this thread on this point, but you can read about it here:

&gt; http://groups.google.com/group/habari-dev/browse_thread/thread/2b53c5 ...

&gt; I really want to understand this thing that could be a problem for
&gt; Habari, but this is the last message I'll send to try to elicit your
&gt; reasoning for your dislike of it.  It's not an effective use of time
&gt; to coerce you to articulate what should initially be made obvious.

Sorry to be so late to this portion of the conversation, but there was
a death in my family and I was out of town until today.

It was not my understanding that we would be using Blueprint as a band
aid for the admin.  I was under the impression we were exploring the
feasibility of this being the permanent solution for laying out the
admin, as well as offering a well documented, open source framework to
our users to theme with.

I am most assuredly -1 for continuing with Blueprint if it is a band
aid.  I don't want to put anyones time into something that won't be
sustainable.  The idea of all the work that will be done in the admin
will have to be redone at some point puts my teeth on edge, as someone
who works on the admin area.

We need to decide now if Blueprint is along for the long hall.  If it
isn't going to be we need to stop, switch gears and start again.  If
it will be we need to decide on how it will be included (svn externals
or wholesale import) and we need to decide who will be submitting
patches to them on our behalf since there are bound to be a number of
fixes as we roll along.

Root, thanks for your passion on this one.  We really do want to hear
what you have to say; sometimes it just comes across a little dodgy,
as some people have already pointed out.  My one concern so far is
your statement that &quot;I would not want to get into code exchange.&quot;  The
entire idea behind the open source movement is to get into &quot;code
exchange&quot;.

The chance to positively contribute to another project should be
exciting and welcome, not something dreaded.  It is my fervent hope
that some of the projects we are benefiting from currently (jQuery,
Blueprint, etc) will find time to install and test Habari.  I am
counting on those people to submit bug reports, feature suggestions
and patches for Habari.

I have the same concerns that some of the other members have.  Is this
a case of Blueprint not really being what we need, or is this NIH (Not
invented here) syndrome cropping up?  I know a thing or two about CSS,
and I don't see a major problem with Blueprint.  Yes there are holes
in what it provides, and yes there are bugs left to squash.  But
instead of reinventing the wheel yet again, why not join forces with
some other very talented people to better Blueprint, which will
benefit not only us, but potentially thousands of others?

You have said you don't mind outlining some of your concerns.  I need
you to do that, in as much detail as possible.  And I need you to give
us some alternatives if we don't go with Blueprint.  Saying the
typography sheet is horrible means nothing to me and a great many
others, give us concrete examples, and we can start to have a real
discussion.

Let's get this whole mess wrapped up in a positive ending people.
This is becoming a Bike Shed, and that is something we don't need.

&gt; I'll try and keep this as quick and succinct as possible.

&gt; Why Blueprint? I played around with it and was genuinely surprised
&gt; by the speed at which I came to grips with it and how it works. It
&gt; made the process of placing things in the exact place that I wanted
&gt; a trivial process.

&gt; Oh sure it's lacking in lots of areas (like the aforementioned forms
&gt; etc) but that's not what I was intending it's use for. I don't ever
&gt; expect BP to be the css of Habari and that's it. What the 3 files do
&gt; is enable us to create and position things clearly in this early
&gt; developing stage, where things are constantly changing. Areas are
&gt; being added, features are changing shape and the requirements are
&gt; evolving. BP allows us to be flexible in that manner. Changing the
&gt; grid sizes is as simple as tweaking where the classes are called in
&gt; every div. The beauty of this approach for me is that it will look
&gt; the part from this very early stage of development.

&gt; Do I think BP is here to stay? No. In all honestly a LOT of BP isn't
&gt; really for us. However the important thing is to take things that BP
&gt; has done well and use it as best we can in our application. The code
&gt; is there for everyone to modify and remove and tweak and add. I've
&gt; been tweaking the files slightly and I honestly thought that people
&gt; would see this benefit as well.

&gt; For those that believe that I did this because I wanted and didn't
&gt; consult anyone, that's not the case. I did consult the other
&gt; developers. Some were interested, while others were apprehensive.
&gt; It's the exact same scenario that came about when I proposed
&gt; tiddlywiki for our manual. Maybe naively I thought that because
&gt; we're using SVN that would could turn the clock if it was felt that
&gt; I'd fucked things up bad. As Scott said, it can be removed if it's
&gt; really becoming obtrusive. My impression is that I can see a great
&gt; deal of promise in what it's provided to the aesthetics of the
&gt; admin, something which I have been meaning to help sort out for a
&gt; good long time. Maybe I should have consulted everyone on the
&gt; mailing list first. To be honest I didn't think it would create such
&gt; a massive backlash for it's inclusion. Once again naive on my part.

&gt; To try and further illustrate the point about flexibility of BP, the
&gt; attached jpg shows what the mockups looked like that I started
&gt; looking at on Sunday. It's pretty darn close to what we have right
&gt; now, but you'll notice that things have been tweaked accordingly,
&gt; which is to be expected when new areas are put forward (like the
&gt; recent activity log). With BP I was able to accommodate this without
&gt; much concern.

&gt; Don't like the typography? I hear you there, but we can sort it out,
&gt; it's not that complicated a stylesheet. We are definitely not
&gt; beholden to BP. Like I said, lets take the good stuff and discard
&gt; the stuff we're not happy with. Or hell some might think that it
&gt; would be even better to put back to the BP project which is in and
&gt; of itself another open source project.

&gt; &gt; It's a way to include some other project's SVN code in your project.
&gt; &gt; So, if we end up relying on Blueprint, there's no reason for us to
&gt; keep
&gt; &gt; and manage our own local copy of their source tree inside of our
&gt; source
&gt; &gt; tree.  Instead we say &quot;Hey, Subversion, include that stuff over
&gt; there in
&gt; &gt; this local directory here.&quot;

&gt; &gt; In this way, we can have an always-up-to-date copy of their stuff
&gt; in our
&gt; &gt; checkouts.

Chris I am sorry for your loss.

My feeling on code exchange is partly personal.
If I wanted to help out over there I could always go and throw
in my 2 cents. The whole project is not my thing.
But that is not it. My concern is that if we get into editing we will
be editing for Habari.
I do not want any generic code sharing issues to cloud that.

Another example: Typography. The whole thing runs on fixed (px) based
font sizing.
Well nobody does that do they? We all a global reset at 76% followed
by ems for fonts and heights and percentages
for width.

More on the .clearfix class. When I say non CSS 2.1 browsers that
includes browsers which purport to follow it but do not. IE 6 for
example does not support pseudo classes. Kinda inconvenient - whoops
there goes what 60% of our users maybe? WE would be right into Kubrick
territory.

And on khaled and his IE max width thing. Yes and no. If some one
could just state clearly if javascript is / is not going to be used in
admin we can get into things like that.

We have an expression here which I hope you will forgive. We are
designing a pig in a poke.

And generally when people admire passion it means they think the guy
is a PITA. Probably right. :)

No one is going to say &quot;we require javascript for the admin&quot; until such
time as we've had reasonable time to discuss the relative strengths and
weaknesses of such a requirement.  After that conversation, there will
hopefully be some consensus, and then you'll have your answer.

Speaking solely for myself, I'm comfortable requiring javascript for the
core administrative interface.  All of the machines from which I will
execute administrative tasks on my blogs have javascript-enabled
browsers.  I am a sighted, non-disabled person, so I don't have any
constraints on the &quot;normal&quot; interaction with my blog.  I don't know
anyone who is blind, or disabled, so I don't know how those limitations
bear on design decisions for the admin interface.

I would like to see a mobile admin interface constructed, that does not
use JS, so that I can -- should I so desire -- administer my blog from
my cell phone.

What a crock.  It's comments like this that detract from any useful
dialog about features and functionality.

Well obviously there is no point in moving forward on admin at all
until the specification for Javascript
and the browsers is buttoned down. Those things determine how it needs
to be coded. This is ass backwards.
But never mind.
