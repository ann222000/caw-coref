The thing is with all this digital stuff, and toup, and stereo and all that
beggling for remastered Sgt Peps since it's been 400 years ago today....well
I can't be arsed!

I used to play AHDN on a crappy little record player and just Love it! I
didn't need all that gubbings. I still don't. Gimme a proper record player
with no perfectumundo sound, no digital bollocks, just a She Loves You 45,
complete with scratches, and I'm anybody's.

Isn't that what the fabs records were designed for?

I got a new sound system for Christmas last year that included a
turntable. It does 45s, but I haven't played them yet cos my vinyl
albums just sound so *good*.

The Elder Imp of Satan recently told me how cool vinyl sounded. He'd
never heard it before this year.

I've still got a record player and about a thousand pieces of vinyl.
If my wife didn't insist on putting photos and things on top of the
thing and if I wasn't so lazy, I'd play the things more often than I
do.

What bothers me these days is - if I need to replace my stylus, where
on earth do I go?  Last time I made a mess of it and had to take it to
a shop to get some delicate pins straighetened out and the whole thing
rebalanced.  Are there any such shops any more?  [What words do I put

Why do people keep insisting on having scratches?
Just wipe the things before you play them and you don't get
many scratches.  Probably the same people who stuff up DVD's from video
stores.  But you don't get to hear those lovely scratches, the things
just don't work.

I'm sure that must have meant something when it was formed in your
brain but by the time it reached my screen, it's lost it.

The capitalism in the CD market is the release of a CD, followed by
the deluxe version with extra limited edition tracks, followed by the
remixed version, followed by the compilation album that contains one
track not available elsewhere, etc...

No, that was the technology at the time of the recordings, Danny. Do
you really think that artists made recordings back then..wanting
people to hear all of the scratches and surface noise that comes on a
45, or an LP? No, they would have liked their music to be heard as it
is today..with just the music coming out of the speakers..the way that
they heard their recordings, right as they were making
them....listening through headphones. I'm not against record players
though. I own
one..and it sometimes nice to hear a recording the way it sounded in
my childhood..just like you. The problem is..is finding Vinyl these
days.

I know a place that sells old Vinyl, but this guy who owns the place
also has old lawn mowers for sale..and anything that you can imagine.
But it really stinks like
oil..and gas in that place...and after about 20 minutes..I have to get
the hell out of there...cause it chokes me. :-)

Vinyl, back in the day, was far more subject to the control of the
capitalists than CDs are now. You can rip tracks from borrowed CDs and
burn them to a new one yourself. Just try that with a 45.

I suppose these days you mostly find old vinyls at garage sales and eBay
and such, and only have to pay the previous owner, but it's not like
there aren't plenty of people selling used CDs, either, so that's really
irrelevant.

Hey Lizz, doesn't matter to me.  My system reproduces LPs, CDs, DVDs and
DTS CDs with such clarity that everything sounds great.  The room
characteristics and speaker placement make everything sound nice and warm
and unharsh.  So, CDs sound just as good or even better than LPs,
without all that bothersome maintenance and without clicks and pops and
rushing surface noise.

Then again, there's something to be said about the memories of the old
days playing mono LPs on a mono record player...nah, I wanted good sound
back then too.  I was one of the first at my high school to own a reel to
reel tape deck just so I could hear factory tapes of previously released
LPs without those clicks and pops.  Even some Beatle albums were released
that way, but I never owned any.  I did own Tommy by the Who on reel.
Sounded much better than the noisy LPs.

But to each of us our own.  Saki will argue that records are better and
has with me here.

Haha. I used to have a turntable ( technics) (sp?) belt drive..with
600 dollar a piece JBL speakers back in the Late 70's to mid 80's..and
had 70 watts of power per channel. That thing kicked butt..and I would
spend 600 dollars just to get a new cartridge and needle every 6
months or less. These days, I have a sony that I paid about 200
dollars for. The sound isn't as big probably...but it sounds probably
better than my other stereo did. Just recently though, the discs
started skipping real bad and it holds 3 CD's. I didn't know what to
do about it..so I went down to radio shack..and they told me to use a
DVD player..which is supposed to sound better than a CD player. Well,
it does sound better..and it's louder..but I can only put one disc in
at a time.  :-(

Oh yeah..this reminds me...does anyone know anything about an XMOD?
It's something that is supposed to make your MP3's sound as good as a
CD does.

&gt; &gt; you really think that artists made recordings back then..wanting
&gt; &gt; people to hear all of the scratches and surface noise that comes on a
&gt; &gt; 45, or an LP? No, they would have liked their music to be heard as it
&gt; &gt; is today..with just the music coming out of the speakers..the way that
&gt; &gt; they heard their recordings, right as they were making
&gt; &gt; them....listening through headphones.

Yes, there was a time when every city had a hi-fi specialist with
listening rooms, shelves full of separate components, everything you
could imagine to give the perfect system which could provide the
perfect listening experience.
The worst example I heard of was a couple who divorced because she
came home one day to find he had started to dig up the living room
floor because the bass response would be so much better if there was a
hollow chamber below the speaker stands.  I also heard of someone who
used to take some sort of sonic device with him (can't recall exactly
what, might have been a tuning fork) when house hunting.  If he didn't
get the right response from the main living room, he wasn't interested
in the house.  This latter tale must be an urban legend thing because
I can't understand scientifically how you could determine anything
about a room's acoustics before you put your own stuff in it - but
this bloke down the pub swears it's true :-)
When I was much muchyounger, it used to a conversation topic amongst
the lads what your hi-fi consisted of.  (You got a Rega Planar?  What
model?)  Christ, we must have been boring :-]

&gt; one..and it sometimes nice to hear a recording the way it sounded in
&gt; my childhood..just like you. The problem is..is finding Vinyl these
&gt; days.

&gt; I know a place that sells old Vinyl, but this guy who owns the place
&gt; also has old lawn mowers for sale..and anything that you can imagine.
&gt; But it really stinks like
&gt; oil..and gas in that place...and after about 20 minutes..I have to get
&gt; the hell out of there...cause it chokes me. :-)
">

Reel to reel tape would have been the perfect medium.  I remember
reading something a long time ago, about an artist not liking vinyl
because the music sounded like it was being played on plastic.
Convenience and mass production became important.  You had those hideous
things called cassettes, eight track tape, which had 4 sides, and
actually sometimes had breaks in the middle of songs.
Manufacturers probably love CDs, but they didn't figure on digital
convenience applying to everybody, not just them.
I once saw the Electric Prunes, Mass in F Minor on reel to reel tape at
a record fair.  I bought the 1968 vinyl copy though.
The looming unfortunate fact is that analog sound can be very superior
to digital sound, and so new digital technologies have come along like
SACD and DVD Audio.
The page on SACD in the Sony magazine pointed out how it came closer to
capturing all the sounds available in analog.
One technique overlooked was the use of a laser beam instead of a needle
for vinyl, they existed in the 70s but were very expensive.

In theory, yes, but many of the recordings were released in 1/4 track
low speed (3-3/4). Each machine would vary, too. Consumer machines
weren't easily aligned, and the tapes had no tones even if you could.

The early issues of &quot;Digital Audio&quot;, a magazine that strongly promoted
the CD format, used to say this in their editorials. They said that the
stylus on plastic created distortion, and CD's were the only way to go.

Unfortunately, some early CD releases were made with the wrong tapes, etc.

Back in the Sixties, my sister and I discovered that if you took one
of your fingers, and placed your finger nail in the grooves of a
record, then spun the turntable with the other hand, it produced a
very tinny sound of a song from the record.  The song either played
too slow or too fast...it was difficult to spin the record at a speed
where the recording sounded just right.

I'm sure we weren't the only ones aware of this phenomenon.
