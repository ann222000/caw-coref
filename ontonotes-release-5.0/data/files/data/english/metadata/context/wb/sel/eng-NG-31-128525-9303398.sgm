&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It's set to 70, but when you're talking to someone who believes in

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; lines to be broken up.  What would you have me do?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Re-evaluate your belief in never snipping?

&gt; &gt; It's his belief Doug, and I do try to respect the wishes of my

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That's not at all the case, and I've shown that it's not, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; guess this kind of purposeful obfuscation on your part is all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you've got left.  The fact remains that it's hypocritical to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suggest that someone should not do something in Usenet because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; anything goes in Usenet.  If anything goes in Usenet, then
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Zorra
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; should never have taken Steph to task for what she did in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Usenet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; unless she thinks that she's excepted from her own standard..
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Simple as that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Look, AllYou, you are really looking a bit foolish here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, although you stated it as a matter of fact, it's really
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; matter of opinion, and from where I sit, I think you looked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; completely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; foolish in admonishing Steph for trying to tell people what they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should and shouldn't do when your justification for doing so was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no one should admonish people for doing what they want to do.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you're smart enough to see the silliness of that position, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just that you can't admit to having a double standard.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  I didn't tell Steph what to or not to post, I told her to &quot;get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; it,&quot; it being getting bent out of shape over the nym change.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And, if you could've taken your one advice and 'gotten over' what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bothers Steph, then you wouldn't posted anything to her.  Again,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a double standard.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  That's a bit of advice, and isn't this an advice forum?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; :-)  Notwithstanding the fact that it's an enormous stretch of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; truth to say that 'get over it', coupled with a proclamation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defining
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Usenet, is advice and not an admonisment, as you said, this is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Usenet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where anything goes. So why the distinction about advice?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  And when she replied that she had a right to complain about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; anything she wanted, I agreed with her.  This whole bug you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; have up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; your butt about me, and only me, holding myself and my friends
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; different standards than everyone else is truly ridiculous.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That would be true if I held only you to that standard.  But the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fact
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is that I see it more prevalent in Bill, you, somewhat is Vickie,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one other person here who shall remain nameless.  IMO, this seems
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be a very deep seeded part of your nature.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  And I'm to the point now where I about bust out laughing every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; you &quot;demand&quot; that a poster do one thing or another.  Didn't you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; throw a Dr. Phil style &quot;How's that working for you?&quot; at me in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; another post?  Well, right back at ya.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've never demanded that anyone do anything.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How about &quot;However, as there is the slightest possibility that my
&gt;&gt;&gt; recollection might be faulty, or that you took something wrong, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; demand to know what that was&quot; in this very thread?

&gt;&gt; I'm sorry Zorra.  I thought that you'd be able to take my comments
&gt;&gt; within the context that they were given, but I guess that's not the
&gt;&gt; case.  Yes, I demand fairness and honesty when people make
&gt;&gt; assertions about me.

&gt; Here is something that I wonder. How do you &quot;demand&quot; it? When it is
&gt; not given, you don't seem to discontinue discussion. I decided to
&gt; look up &quot;demand&quot; and got

&gt; &quot;request urgently and forcefully;&quot;

&gt; What is forceful about the request aside from perhaps it's volume.
&gt; It lacks teeth.

&gt; another possible fit is

&gt; &quot;claim as due or just;
">

Yes, I use phrases like &quot;I demand fairness from you when speaking of
me&quot; with a bit of hyperbole.  I guess the demand can be inferred from
the implied threat to judge the person as being unethical, and as of
lacking character, if the demand is not met.  To people who care
little to nothing about being fair, or being regarded as being fair,
the demand has no teeth, however, to those who care about being fair
and honest, the request should carry with it some degree of 'force',
thereby making it a demand.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this Atalanta? Did you change your nick again?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why do you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DO that? I can't think of anything more infuriating
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then needing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be heard by people who don't want to hear
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While there are people who change their names for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that reason,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've never thought that Atalanta was one of them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think she just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; likes to be creative.  Maybe I'm wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IIRC, she's said before that she just likes to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; creative with her online ID.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kitten

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IMO do it with your sig line. I think changing your nick
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be a royal pain in the ass. And creative... no.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But as is pointed out repeatedly, this is Usenet, people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can say (and do) what they want.  So get over it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No one is saying that

You misunderstand the Jewish idiom of &quot;Elohim&quot; (plural of El) which is used
to signify the greatness of the One God Yahweh not the plurality of the One
God Yahweh.

Look up &quot;idiom&quot; because I'm sure you don't understand what it means.

Stop taking half-sentences and pretending they are making a statement.
You are so deceptive.

&quot;God is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son of man, that He
should repent&quot; (Num. 23:19) means God does not lie or have need for
repentance or regret like men do.

Num. 23:19 is a comparison between God and man, not a statement solely
about God.

What a moron: You can't tell the difference between Christ and antichrist.

Even if you call Jesus &quot;a&quot; ba'al, you're associating Him with the false
religion of Satan. It's like calling God &quot;Allah,&quot; when &quot;Allah&quot; has nothing
to do with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

They're not just other &quot;names.&quot; They're other god-wannabes, as opposed to
the God who Is.
