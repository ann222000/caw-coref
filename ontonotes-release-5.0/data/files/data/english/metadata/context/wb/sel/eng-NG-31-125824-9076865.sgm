Now, I know this sort of post would really be expected by mr. Bill
Wright, bit no.  It's me.  Went to France last weekend and bought a
load of strong beers and tonight I'm trying them out!  You are all my
bestesh friends, you are!  Is Dave Fawthrop really dead?  Who knows!
I polished my Wurlitzer juke box today with Silvo.  Bloody marvelous
stuff!  I really really wish I discovered the wonder that is Log
Periodic aerials before I bought a Blake DMX05W wideband, even though
it does the job perfectly well, it's not really right, is it?  I own a
combination of 20 HD-DVD/Blu-Ray discs but as of yet, ain't bought a
player.  I'm waiting for the Samsung hybrid player.  I remember doing
a paper round when I was a kid, listening to Def Leppard on my
Walkman, and seeing a 'woman' undress in a bedroom window. Wow, happy
days!  I could go on, but I won't.  Goodnight.

how random, though slightly amusing

suggest you get to Belgium next and stock up on some proper
beers - Kwak &amp; Leffe Blonde are particular favourites of ours!

Happy hangover :-)

50 Cent may do it as he's &quot;retiring&quot; from writing music after getting
trounced
in the album charts by Kanye.

Just add a few unnecessary swear words and it's sure to be a hit, though not
sure what would rhyme with &quot;Blake DMX05W&quot;.....Issuzu?

Bloody hell, did I really write that last night?  Actually, don't feel
too bad this morning.  We did pop to belgium as it's only half hour up
the road from Calais, but it was just for me brother to get his cheap
fags.  Oh, and I did get a couple of bottles of Kwak.

Hmm yes. BTW, I'm testing the theory that piss is good for moss, so every
night I take my full bladder out to the enormous stone thing that I built
five years ago and piss on the latter. The trouble is, if it works the moss
will only be on the bottom three or four foot. I've thought about climbing
to the top and pissing over the edge but I'm normally very drunk at the time

When confronted by a homophobic thug who feels that one's sexuality is
reason enough to knock the shit out of one, popular wisdon is that one
should confront the thug with his own crypto-homosexuality. I've always
doubted the wisdom of this. It sounds more philosophical than pragmatic to
me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well I had to say something. After all what goes around comes
&gt;&gt;&gt;around...hahahaha

&gt;&gt; Where's that old pedantic bugger that was always correcting our use of
&gt;&gt; the English language?

&gt;And who is the old pedantic bugger of which you speak?

He hasn't posted her in months.  He use to correct every spelling
mistake &amp; mis-use (?) of the English language.  Oh come on, someone
must remember him?

Thanks for the offer, Bill, but my 'metal' days are over now.   I'm
calming down.

I presume he means Porcella, J. who seems to have fallen off that block of
flats (metaphorically speaking of course) that he used to live in somewhere
in Westminster.

&gt; &gt; I'll tell you something. You lot &quot;crack&quot;m me up,you're so funny!!
&gt; &gt; Refreshing real humour Zoe

&gt; We are nothing if not original, Doris. I'd call you Zoe but I can't spell
&gt; umlaut.  Mind you, there's some rum buggers on here you know. I shouldn't
&gt; enter into a one-to one discussion with any of them unless you have a
&gt; chaperone. I can tell you that some of them get their rocks off by talking
&gt; dirty. For instance, the other day someone whispered &quot;I like to do it
&gt; without a balun.&quot; Shocking, I think you'll agree.

Oh my goodness.....SHOCKING I'm sure i can cope though!!!! Never worry
about the umlaut,I don't after all

&gt;&gt; Here's a couple of umlauts, just in case you need them again in
&gt;&gt; future Öö. Please don't use them.

&gt; but Zoë is not spelt with umlauts - it uses a diaeresis to indicate
&gt; both vowels being pronounced.  It is not an accent.

&gt; Just having a pedantic moment.

Henceforward to be referred to as a Porcellane Moment, perhaps.

Duvel is real ale in a bottle. It's a blend of two different brews and
is bottle conditioned. They let it ripen in temperature controlled
warehouses for six weeks before they let it out.

I don't drink it to get plastered.
