My husband and I spent all of our educational years behind the closed
doors of a brick and morter school house.  We conformed and
transformed by the will of our teachers and peers and family to see
that this was the only way to be learned.  This is how I lived school
and played school for nearly 18 years (including college in that
figure).

I am a definite school at home mom.  I'm not sure I can unravel myself
from this neurosis. While it may not be a substantive &quot;mental
disorder&quot; it sometimes feels like mental disorder (chaos).

Part of my reasons for choosing homeschooling is mostly enviroment.
The peer culture that today's children live in is dangerous and
separates them from older, younger, and &quot;different&quot; members of our
society so that they can only relate in terms that specifically apply
to them.

Now my choice to transition to unschooling is the desire that my
children form a love of learning and the ability that both their
father and I have had to discover from scratch as adults to seek
knowledge for their own purposes and not for mine. All the things we
are taught in traditional schools are for someone elses reasons, not
our own.  I've seen their eyes glaze over in the middle of a math
lesson they wish they weren't in.  This is stuff I believe they should
learn.

My delimma is that it took about 2 months to convince my husband (with
the help of the media about local schools) that homeschooling was a
viable choice. He witnessed some of their &quot;schooling&quot; today and was
certain that a 2nd and 3rd grader shouldn't be able to complete their
work in an hour.  They weren't completely done, and their work wasn't
up to par but they got away with it b/c Dad was here today and not
myself.  If he already thinks what they've done isn't enough then how
am I going to convince him that unschooling is the path towards the
fullfilling education we seek for them.

He's firmly planted in the 3 r's and plenty of them.  It's going to
take me a while to even feel like they are learning stuff. I get so
impatient with them now when they give me the duh! look...crimney...I
know there has to be a better way.

I'm slowing encouraging them in projects I know they have a nature
bent in, like my son who loves science and would do science
experiments all day long. Or my daughter who would do one craft after
another for eternity if I could let her.

Thanks for your insight in advance. L

-=-

I collect these statements.  There are others here:  http://
sandradodd.com/ifilet

Find some brief, compelling things for your husband to read.  Maybe
passages from &quot;How Children Learn&quot; by John Holt or something.   Maybe
just a few quotes would do him. http://sandradodd.com/johnholt

I want to go back to the thing about your daughter, though.  If she
did one craft after another for eternity (just assuming she could, or
even for a week), I'm assuming some of them would involve paint, some
cloth or string or yarn, some wood, paper, plastic, some glue, some
special tools.  Some would probably be from Japan, or traditional
German or Polish crafts.  Maybe some would make good gifts or would
be sellable.    While she was working, she could listen to music, or
watch DVDs.  You could read to her, or tell her stories.  You both
could sing.

Any interest leads to all others.

How wonderful! I do/show crafts with my kids and organize different crafts
for homeschool kids in my area. We have done Ukrainian Easter Egg
decorating, Japanese Embroidering and Stencil theorem folk art ,  paper
quilling and scrapbooking.

Scrapbooking can require planning, measuring, patience, journaling and
design knowledge..
Having been teashing crafts to girls and boys alike- I can say that any kind
of &quot;creating&quot; such as
building/creating/making/cooking/painting/writing/electronics    will boost
self esteem in children and adults alike.
There is one young boy - in a family of 9 kids (!) that loves to do things
with me. I know his mom doesn't have time to do things with her kids and his
face lights up when he works on something and he sees that it is
beautiful/tastes good/was fun to do and  some one paid attention and
listened to  him..
It can be soothing ans zen like - a way to build on closeness and
friendships. Many meaningful converstations and topics have been brought up
while we have been doing some sort of craft. I liken it to days of quilting
when women would sit and talk with each other- sharing storeis and ideas.
Sometimes it not about the end result- but the process. We can work on a
scrapbooking album for 4 hours and get &quot;nothing&quot; done but have had a
wonderful close time.

Listening to stories on cd/mp3 or music while she creates is a great idea.
Have you tried the &quot;Horrible History&quot; series? If you are near a computer
than BBC childrens radio, Big Toe and Little Toe,
http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbc7/kids/ have great plays, skits and books to listen
to online if there is compter nearby.

Good. If the father needed to rediscover his love of learning and ability
to learn after school the couldn't you point out that logically that means
school must have crushed his love of learning?

Why do they give you that look? Are you trying to teach them something they
don't understand? Or does the duh look indicate that they are doing
something they think you should understand but don't understand?

I found this paragraph slightly confusing, but am assuming that your husband
is unhappy with the school at home outcome he is seeing. What does he want
from your children's education? What are his goals? Maybe you need to sit
down with him and really talk about what he expects to see when he spends a
day with them. One of the problems might be that you've used scare tactics
to convince him that homeschooling is a viable choice. Your earlier
statement:

&quot;Part of my reasons for choosing homeschooling is mostly enviroment.
The peer culture that today's children live in is dangerous and
separates them from older, younger, and &quot;different&quot; members of our
society so that they can only relate in terms that specifically apply
to them.&quot;

uses the word dangerous when I would only maybe think it was something to be
slightly uncomfortable about. I quite liked my peer culture as a child and a
teenager and a young adult. I'm not sure what the &quot;media about local
schools&quot; was like, but if it was about threats at school you may have set up
a situation where your husband was less about embracing schooling at home
and more about avoiding putting his children in potentially dangerous
situations and environments. If that is the case you may need to figure out
ways to help him embrace the potential joys of homeschooling. And, in my
opinion, the greatest joys are in an unschooling life.

He's firmly planted in the 3 r's and plenty of them.  It's going to

It is really important to figure out what you want from your life with your
children. I knew very early on, even before deciding that I wasn't going to
send them to school, that I didn't want to set myself up as their
instructor. There is no way that it is anything but an adversarial
relationship. Even if you see yourself as somehow setting your children up
with a stronger future, you are still the one planning and molding that
future, not helping them to achieve the present they want to have.

What does it mean to be &quot;firmly planted in the 3 r's and plenty of them&quot;?
Does that mean that he believes that they need to do lots of worksheets and
formalized study of reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic? Does he believe that
the only way, or at least the most effective way to master the &quot;3 r's&quot; is
through repetition and lots of it? I can tell you that for me the only gain
I ever had through repetition was intense boredom for the things I'd
mastered and an increasing sense of my own stupidity in the things I hadn't.
Repetition never did anything but alienate me, or bore me.

Sometimes the only thing you can see is the potential outcome. So, school at
home, which took some persuasion, and I imagine is only on a trail basis
(?), has at least the benefit, the outcome, of mimicking a system that he is
comfortable with, and has experienced first hand. And if my original
presumption was correct, that he didn't really embrace school home as much
as he was put off by school at school, than he will not be wanting to throw
off the shackles of a schooled education. So how can you first demonstrate
that the outcome of unschooling is at least equal (if different) to the
outcome of schooling. There are no studies of unschooling. The closest study
that I know of was done by Paula Rothermel (
http://www.dur.ac.uk/p.j.rothermel/ ) at the University of Durham in the UK.
She looked both at scholastic ability and psychological measures. She found
that home-educated children surpassed their school-educated peers, and the
only approach that made a statistical difference was that religious
households had a higher score than any other approach, including unschooling
(which is called autonomous education in the UK). It may be worth noting
that she home-educates her 3 children.

I was the lead parent in our decision to unschool our kids.  I was the one
who read and read and read about how to unschool. I read webpages and lists
and would pass on ideas to David. He trusted me. Still does. But it was up
to me to bring him on board my crazy train. When I decided to let Simon and
Linnaea dictate what they ate, years of anthropological training that said
that humans crave, covet, are driven to seek out the rare good of sweets and
fats and salts came into play and, thus, he knew I was choosing to condemn
Simon and Linnaea to a life of obesity.  Fortunately he was willing to
listen and to discuss. He was willing to maybe see that it was the rare good
that we were evolved to crave and not the specific item. And he watched and
listened and would read the things I pointed out to him. The small things,
the articles, not the books, not the giant webpages, but the little
snippets. When we would cook together I would talk about the things that
excited me. If he brought forth a query that I could not answer, or if I had
something that I wasn't comfortable with, I would spend time researching it
on-line so that I could respond, comfort, advise.

You say that unschooling appeals because the lessons plans are causing your
children to switch off, to glaze at the eyes. It's a powerful truth. Lessons
can be an eye-glazing experience, particularly if the lessons exist to fill
someone else's needs. There are ways to dress lessons up, to make them jazzy
and cool, watching Schoolhouse Rocks videos and doing cool experiments that
can, in that moment, inspire learning. But in the end you are still arguing
that learning is something that only occurs when there is a teacher and a
pupil. That there is a set base of knowledge that must be handed down for a
child to be able grow into someone who can succeed within the horrible
difficult, but ultimately real, adult world. And that is a damaged, a
limited, a smaller understanding of the world than unschooling offers.
Unschooling says, at its most fundamental, that learning happens, school is
optional.

So look, read, find, those voices that will appeal to your husband. If he is
anti-establishmentarinistic give him John Taylor Gatto and his take on the
history of school ( http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/ ) or this amusing take on
the history of education by Jeff Horwich
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BKXi6OhhhY&amp;eurl; . If he is a biologist, like
my husband, or an economist have him read Pam Sorooshian (
http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.html ). If he is an engineer, or a
mathematical thinker, try Joyce's site at http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/ and
see what appeals there. If he likes The Tick and/or Godzilla find Deb Lewis
http://sandradodd.com/deblewis/ and give him her (not literally, I think it
would upset her family). The trick, if it is a trick, is to figure out
exactly why there is any value in the &quot;3 r's&quot; as they are obtained through
the U.S. education system. And you have to do the legwork. You have to
convince yourself before you can ever convince him that unschooling is the
way that you really want to go. Find the voices that you know will work.
Wander through the wonderful labyrinth that is
http://www/sandradodd.com/unschooling and see what rings out loudly. See if
he would be willing to trust you on this. Take lots of pictures of what you
are doing and send them to him via e-mail. Talk about what they learned in
the process of making a craft or watching youtube videos about mentos
explosions. Talk about the eye-glaze and see if he can recollect his own
point of eye-glazing. Work to make him a part of the whole thing. Let him
see how wonderful and cool unschooling is. Find a conference going on near
you and go. Let him see other people living and learning the unschooling
way. There is an unschooling blogring at
http://www.ringsurf.com/netring?action=info&amp;ring;=Unschooling_Blogs , maybe
there are lives there that make him see in a way he couldn't before.

The internet is alive with voices that can help you to help your husband to
understand why this idea appeals. It is a scary thing to throw off
everything you know to embrace some strange and seemingly potentially
handicapping idea for your children. Support him, help him to see what you
see. And make sure that you see well. Make sure that you can see the joy and
the glory that can be within an unschooling life. It will help him to be
excited, too.
