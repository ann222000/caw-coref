Not a problem since Einstein already did it. What did you imagine we

Well more to the point I should think it would be their frame of

An information bit that is itself dimensionless or 0-dimensional. Funny
that you couldn't put that together with "updating" a space-time grid with
light-time-event information. A traveler in interplanetary space couldn't
give his kilometers per second or kilometers per hour. In interstellar space
there would be no such thing as calculating kilometers per second.
Everything would be per light-time-distance updating. Slang: How many
"lights" the traveler would be traveling while navigating a hologrammic
space-time grid constantly being updated at the speed of light with new
information. Particularly locally. Especially locally. I took the view of
the light speed 'updaters' as well as the view of the traveler. I moved into
the point of light, the information bit, and the points of the expanding,
ballooning, light wave (light front). The points of the expanding,
ballooning, light cone.

You still haven't got it yet. Light doesn't travel like you or I travel.
It travels like the surface horizon travels when you or I travel. Things
contract and merge into it, merging into the "background" as we leave them
behind us. Things appear out of it, out of the background horizon. Things
separate from it and expand as we approach them. To a standing observer, we
the travelers contract and merge into it, merging into the background. Or
appear out of it, appearing out of the background horizon. We the travelers
separate from it and expand in oncoming toward the observer. All this
because that surface horizon has universal enwrapping coverage, "finite but
without boundaries," as Einstein put it. It is independent of our velocity,
but not independent of our position. It positions us perfectly, irrespective
of velocity. It dead centers us each within its 360 degree flat. Or in the
vacuum of space, it makes us each the core center of a hologrammic spherical
grid of [light time] space-time.

A light wave-front is expansively processive. Get around to its backside
and take a look at it . . . nothing but recessive dimensionless vacuum. A
lot of light waves / fronts flying around in every direction -- and flying
in from everywhere. A lot of vacuums around the Universe. A lot of vacuum to
the Universe. "That surface horizon has universal enwrapping coverage. And
of course, "the speed of light is constant (c) in a vacuum," a wrap into
itself, "finite but without boundaries." Light-time 'information', though,
is very 'finite' and, also, quite 'boundaried'. But since "time is
relative," a million different observers in a million different (space)time
zones will give it a million different boundaries. They won't agree on
(light-time) space-time ground-zero. Neither position nor velocity. Zero is
not finite.

See, Shirley, the problem is that just like EM radiation clocks have a
frequency or they're stopped and can't be used to define or measure
time. That clock frequency is count per unit time just as you pointed
out for EM frequency and just as circular a definition of time as EM
frequency.

It just doesn't matter that they're both circular definitions because
we're really not interested in defining or measuring time in absolute
terms. The only thing we're interested in measuring in this context is
dilation in temporal measures relative to a common source. And for
that purpose EM frequency is a far superior measure than common clocks
because EM radiation doesn't stop and continues to measure time in
relative terms indefinitely.

Now I understand you don't appreicate being found out by someone a
little more conversant with such issues than yourself, but you really
need to get over it and rejoin science instead of bawling like a
scalded cat every time something you thought you knew turns out not to
be true because you were to lazy or stupid to think the issue through
for yourself and preferred to rely on problematic Cliff notes and
erudite but incorrect discussions with others.

That's it in a nutshell. The count can never be negative or stop.
One can lose some counts by moving away and then the
counts are spread out in space, but you always get them
back again when you return. The same applies to the person
you left behind counting your oscillator.
That's what proves Einstein Dingleberries are stoooopid.

There is at least one well-known instance of physics being
done exactly this way. Galileo concluded that the period of
a pendulum was constant, independent of amplitude, by
using his heartbeat as a clock. The pendulum period was
measured, in other words, as "n heartbeats" not "n seconds".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

How do we do physics with any clock that isn't perfect?

Since all real clocks are imperfect, physicists have known how
to deal with the imperfections for centuries. It adds error to your
measurement.

When you have two clocks and they don't agree, how do you
know which one is more accurate? Compare to a known
standard? How do we know how accurate that standard is?
(As I said in my previous response, this isn't a trivial question
and NIST has a "metrology" page to discuss it. However, nor
is it an insurmountable problem as you seem to think.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; People have been using periodic or cyclic phenomenon to &quot;keep time&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; since the dawn of the human race. Our first clock was the earth with the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shirley you jest, Dutch. I mean you couldn't possibly be talking about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a non circular &quot;beats per unit time&quot; definition of time could you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Where did I say &quot;per unit of time&quot;, retard?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You didn't, Shirley. I just filled in the blanks for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Try to avoid filling blanks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You really don't have the brain for filling blanks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well someone really has to. It's about time you began to learn about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; temporal physics.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I said EM
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; frequency was a better measure of time than clocks were because unlike
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clocks they didn't stop and you said the units of EM frequency were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; count per unit time to make your point that my definition of time was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; circular and I returned the favor by pointing out that your definition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of time as what clocks measure is just as circular because what it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; measures is counts per unit time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A clock counts. Period.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    &quot;The second is the duration of 9192631770 periods of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    radiation corresponding to the transition between the two
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can use your heart to count the number of beats it takes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for a stone to fall from a tower. You call that number &quot;the time&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and the unit of time is one heart beat.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can use your heart to count the number of beats it takes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for a stone to fall from a tower that is twice as high.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can use your heart to count the number of beats it takes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for a stone to fall from a tower that is 3 times as high.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;etc...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;With this you can find out that the distance covered by a falling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rock is proportional to the square of time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Proportional to the square of what exactly?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Can't you read, retard?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, Shirley, apparently I can read better than you can explain. Time
&gt;&gt;&gt;is what a clock measures and a clock is what measures time. Circular
&gt;&gt;&gt;facto.

&gt;No, retard. Time is what a clock measures, and a clock is
&gt;that thing that you hear inside your fat body, or that thing
&gt;you carry around your fat wrist, or that thing that rises over
&gt;the horizon, or that thing the engineers and physicists of our
&gt;species (-not yours, apparently-) have created to count
&gt;radiation transitions in cesium atoms.

In other words a clock is something or other which has no frequency
and which is like your thought processes stopped most of the time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    &quot;The second is the duration of 9192631770 periods of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    radiation corresponding to the transition between the two
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can use your heart to count the number of beats it takes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for a stone to fall from a tower. You call that number &quot;the time&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and the unit of time is one heart beat.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can use your heart to count the number of beats it takes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for a stone to fall from a tower that is twice as high.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can use your heart to count the number of beats it takes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for a stone to fall from a tower that is 3 times as high.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;etc...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;With this you can find out that the distance covered by a falling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rock is proportional to the square of time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Proportional to the square of what exactly?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Can't you read, retard?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, Shirley, apparently I can read better than you can explain. Time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is what a clock measures and a clock is what measures time. Circular
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;facto.

&gt;&gt;&gt;No, retard. Time is what a clock measures, and a clock is
&gt;&gt;&gt;that thing that you hear inside your fat body, or that thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;you carry around your fat wrist, or that thing that rises over
&gt;&gt;&gt;the horizon, or that thing the engineers and physicists of our
&gt;&gt;&gt;species (-not yours, apparently-) have created to count
&gt;&gt;&gt;radiation transitions in cesium atoms.

&gt;&gt; In other words

&gt;Don't do it.
&gt;You are too stupid to paraphrase.

Of course I'm stupid. Just quite so stupid as yourself.

All of which have frequency, Shirley, or they don't work.

I'd love to see you try it, Shirley. More likely 0.0 if your heart has

&gt; &gt; &gt;There is nothing circular about any of this. Nowhere is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;per unit of time&quot; mentioned or even implied.

&gt; &gt; Of course not. You just measure time according to your heart beat.

&gt; There is at least one well-known instance of physics being
&gt; done exactly this way. Galileo concluded that the period of
&gt; a pendulum was constant, independent of amplitude, by
&gt; using his heartbeat as a clock. The pendulum period was
&gt; measured, in other words, as &quot;n heartbeats&quot; not &quot;n seconds&quot;.

&gt; &gt; And
&gt; &gt; what if your heartbeat is irregular, slow, or fast?

&gt; How do we do physics with any clock that isn't perfect?

&gt; Since all real clocks are imperfect, physicists have known how
&gt; to deal with the imperfections for centuries. It adds error to your
&gt; measurement.

&gt; When you have two clocks and they don't agree, how do you
&gt; know which one is more accurate? Compare to a known
&gt; standard? How do we know how accurate that standard is?
&gt; (As I said in my previous response, this isn't a trivial question
&gt; and NIST has a &quot;metrology&quot; page to discuss it. However, nor
&gt; is it an insurmountable problem as you seem to think.)

&gt; http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/phase/Properties/one.htm#oneone
">

I read this but not closely. I expected the author to
baldly state how instability in the reference
oscillator is accounted for. Rather, this essay only
discusses precision measurement of instability of one
oscillator relative to another.
