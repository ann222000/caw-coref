I went to see this movie Friday night.  It was GOOD.  Loosely based on
the Stephen Hunter book "Point of Impact", it follwed the general plot
of the book fairly well, although somewhat Hollywoodized.

Lots of shooting, explosions, bloody head shot kills, etc.  I'm a big
Stephen Hunter fan and was somewhat worried that the movie would be a
stinker, but I really enjoyed this one.

Here is the question.  What was the rifle that Bob Lee Swagger used to
blow up the stew can?

I too am an enthusiastic Stephen Hunter fan. I have read and enjoyed
every book he has written. However I refuse, as a matter of principle,
to pay one damn cent to see the movie "Shooter" . The star, Mark
Wahlberg, is one of the biggest anti-gun a**holes in Hollyweird. At
the 2001 MTV Awards this sneering jerk said "I believe Charlton Heston
is America's best villain because he loves guns so much." He and his
butt-buddy George Clooney have made numerous other personal attacks on
Charlton Heston, even mocking his struggle with Alzheimer's Disease.
This insolence comes from a vicious little street thug whose violent
criminal past includes several felony convictions for robbery,
assaults on blacks and Asians, and drug dealing. You will note from
the following link that his racist attacks on minorities were always
made as a member of a gang. What a brave little social lecturer we
have in Marky Mark!!

http://www.keepandbeararms.com/information/XcIBViewItem.asp?ID=2360

Others are perfectly free to make their own decision on this matter.
But I cannot in good conscious buy a ticket to this movie knowing that
some portion of my money is going to subsidize the self-serving
hyprocrisy of this smirking, posturing, arrogant little shit.

I have just two words for Marky Mark Wahlberg, and those two words are
not "Merry Christmas". And I extend the very same sentiments to the
horse he rode in on.

I wanted to catch it this weekend, but just had too many plates in the
air. Maybe some night this week or next weekend. I'll keep an eye out
for that scene you had a question about re: Swaggers' rifle. I'm no
expert, but might be able to help. Btw, Hunter supposedly had a brief
speaking role in the film. Did you see him?

The fun thing to do is rent the movie, copy it, and pass out free copies to
all your friends. Or, ask for a donation for your favorite pro-gun group in
order to get your "free" copy. What a nauseating little pimp Marky is.

I went to your website reference and read the article.  I agree Wahlberg is not
one of our "friends,"  but the movie (and his performance) were very good, in
my opinion.

He is an actor.  I'd have preferred Tommy Lee Jones, Val Kilmer or even Clint
Eastwood in the leading role, but it wasn't my decision.  Maybe if the guy
(jerk) makes enough money from the film, he will change his tune.

My ticket cost $7.50.  I bet Wahlberg gets less than 1% of the gross, which
works out to less than 8 cents.  It's no as if I was writing a campaign check
to Chuck Shumer, Diane Feinstein or Miss Hillary for a couple of hundred
dollars.

I respect your decision not to go see it, but I'm probably going to buy the DVD
when/if it comes out.

Lee and Eastwood are probably a bit too old for this part, but I agree
on Kilmer, or even Christian Bale...

I've not seen it yet but it does sound pretty good. I'll probably wait
for the DVD. It's still 'flu season so I'd rather not spend any time in
a crowded theater.

As much as I'd like to, it's difficult to know all of the political
agendas of all of the actors in Hollywood and judge a movie accordingly.

And, like you said, maybe acting these types of roles can cause a change
of heart. :-)

Time will tell.

Another question: there is a part where he says that the president
wears body armor and this means a head shot must be taken.
What kind of rifle/ammunition suitable of making a 600 yard shot
is not capable of ripping thru the body armor?

Would you not have to take into consideration the grade of the body
armor?

Depends on the type of body armor being used, and whether it involves
any of those ceramic plates, as well as exactly what round is trying to
punch through it. Some of what's out there can/will stop a .30-06 or
similar power round. (granted, the wearer will likely be one seriously
sore puppy afterwards, and the armor is all but certain to be toast,
but alive, sore, and wearing toasted armor beats dead, right?)

If the round being used is a .50, all bets are off, of course! Not much
short of a bunker is going to keep those out, and bunkers are hardly
wearable! :)

I don't think there's body armor available that would stand up to any
rifle one might reasonably use at that distance, that would also be
unobtrusive for a man to wear.

A target the size of a human head at that distance would be a very
iffy shot. The F class and long range bench rest guys shoot groups far
smaller than a human head, but the targets themselves are larger and
they shoot sighters that allow them to judge the wind much better. A
sniper takes one shot, and that's all he gets.

I haven't seen the movie, and I haven't been trained as a sniper, but
I might want to use something with some real punch, a .408 Cheyenne
Tactical*, for example, and go for center of mass.

There are multiple levels of body armor available, including ones that will
stop most rifle bullets.  See:

You guessed what the rifle was, BTW, but keep it a secret, please..  Don't tell
this NG, let them keep trying..

There is lots of wearable body armor that stands up to a 30-06 or 308 at point
blank range, but I wouldn't want to demonstrate any.

30-06 and 308 cartridges work quite well out to 1000-1200 yards, head shots
included.

If we were to follow that line of reasoning then electing Chucky
Schumer as President might cause *him* to rethink his position on the
Second Amendment.

The cut Marky Mark gets from your ticket cost is not the realissue.
What is important is that a big gate for the movie inflates his status
as a star. This in turn gives him a bigger voice in Hollyweird and a
higher podium from which to spread his anti-gun propaganda. Charlton
Heston used his star power to support gun owner rights; Wahlberg will
use any star power he can gain to destroy them.

I suspect that Wahlberg has a good reason to go around spewing
gun-hatred. Consider his past record of vicious racial attacks on
blacks and Asians. Ordinarily anyone with a background like that would
be ostracized and condemned by the Hollyweird liberals. So, how does a
racist thug on the make like Marky Mark earn absolution? Simple, he
first claims he's found enlightenment and then focuses his hateful
bigotry on gun owners and the NRA and, lo and behold, all is forgiven!
I don't know if he's smart enough to figure this out, but one of his
handlers obviously is. How touching  that those Hollyweird liberals
are so ready to forgive and forget.

Well, they say it's a free country (although it's looking increasingly
less so) and every man can make his own choice. Just take the time to
ponder all the 'unintended consequences' of such choices.

Oh, poop!  Hit the wrong "reply to"  tab.  For those of you who are unfamiliar
with
this pretty impressive cartridge see the folllowing link:

http://www.cheytac.com/

Barrett also has a .416 inch diameter (based on 50 BMG) cartridge with about
the same ballistic nastiness on terminal targets.  See:

If nothing else, the thighs are not going to be protected by body armor.
Don't underestimate how quickly one can bleed out from a ripped Femoral
artery.

Leg shots (or so I have read) can be more deadly than one might think.

How many out there are going to be sniping with a .50?

Yeah, but how unobtrusive is it? Is this what the President walks
around in? The stuff I've seen makes the wearer look like a high tech
medieval knight.

#30-06 and 308 cartridges work quite well out to 1000-1200 yards, head shots
#included.

Sure they are, but I wonder what percentage of head shot sized targets
are actually hit at 600 yards with no sighters, just one shot, the way
a sniper would have to do it?

I haven't seen anything mentioned concerning your question on the
rifle, the focus was redirected to Mark Wahlberg and Hollywood, and
now body armor.

The problem with something non-standard is not only the lack of AP and
incindiary, but a poor logistics tail.

So be it.  It was a well done, pro-gun, patriotic type movie and Wahlberg did a
very good acting job, in my opinion.  I don't begrudge him my 8 cents at all.
Actors are whores, anyway, kinda like politicians.

Did you know that Hunter is coming out with another Bob Lee Swagger book? See:
http://www.amazon.com/47th-Samurai-Bob-Swagger-Novel/dp/0743238095

September 2007.

If you want me to pay for your admission to the current movie, contact me
offline.  I'm willing to finance it.  Remember that Wahlberg is not the real
enemy here, it's the dumb Mother Fletcher politicians (mostly Democrats) in
Washington that pose the real threat.

Best Regards,

Mike Eberlein

Well, let's say he has access to the best, but probably doesn't wear it.
Like someone else said above, it would be way to bulky for him to wear for
practical purposes.  You can almost bet he does have a certain level of soft
body armor on, but nothing with overlapping ceramic plates, like you would
wear on a combat or swat mission.
