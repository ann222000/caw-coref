Critical Values of the Pearson´s  Coefficient of Skewness

A provocative statement (or else, a full triviality): most sample distributions are useless in what concerns the practical conditions one met.
Did I say most? Almost always was more exact...
The reasons are quite simple to understand: the distributions are only approximate (in a no known degree) and/or they were mathematically derived asymptotically for infinite sample sizes
Many persons, included me, think that random simulation is the only way to get promptly exact answers to the actual problems that are present in Science and Technology.
Meanwhile exactly derived results should Mathematicians try to find out. Really the supply is very scarce considering the demand, I mean.

Subject: Re: Pearson´s Coefficient of Skewness:
exact and asymptotic critical values

I can try. The approximation you are using is

var (beta1)  is close to 6/n.

The formula given in the reference is that

var (beta1)  is exactly equal to 6(n-2) / ((n+1)(n+3)) .

THANK YOU very much David Jones.

This is the philosophy of someone who knows nothing about mathematics.  For example, I am able to prove the hypothesis that 5/13 &lt; 8/13, using the fact that the rationals form an ordered field.  Afonso can only generate millions of simulations and then is never allowed to accept this hypothesis or its alternative.

It’s not from the complete unlearned persons that we should stay cautiously towards theirs comments ´cause they are sufficiently wise to be quiet.
Is from semi-learned the danger is really terrific, mainly when they are unable to control its natural, but typically unsound, verbiage.

These are the comments from someone who believes that hypotheses are statements about sample statistics, not parameters, who calls quantiles  of a sample statistic &quot;confidence intervals&quot;, and who proposed confidence intervals having the remarkable property that for certain true values of the parameter have zero probabilities of coverage.

Critical Values of the Pearson´s  Coefficient of Skewness

Goal
____To verify how long the simulated values and the generally accepted *Normal Theory* is really compatible.____

A simple QBASIC routine was written (see listing below)

1) Input size
The sample size of each simulated normal i.d.d. X~N(0, 1) samples
2) Read cumulative values of X for the probabilities 0.95, 0.975, 0.99, 0.995  variable TABLE(  )
3) For each of  ALL= 400000 samples, size SIZE.
__3a) obtain the sample, and then calculating
__m, m2, m3 the three moments to get
_______b= m3 / (var ^3/2)
where var = m2 = sum (D^2) / size, D the difference of the sample item to the mean.
NOTE: I accepted the David Jones´s suggestion that I should use this unusual expression of m2: not dividing by size minus one.
4) Computing, summing 3, and coding this quantity: gm( ).
NOTE: one should sum 3 in order to be sure the quantities are positive, interval [0, 6].
5) Fractiles (frequencies 0.950, 0.975, 0.990, 0.995) were obtained by ordered summation gm( ), results minus 3.
6) Comparing the values with those, provided by David Jones, - from
___var = 6 * (size – 2) / [(size + 1 ) * (size + 3)]__

DISPLAY, FOR size = 20

A) 2 left COLUMNS
___critical value___frequency
at bottom : the variance of g1 such that obtained by the simulated 10000 samples.
B) 2 right: COLUMNS: checking of the simulated normal data: ____cumulated frequencies vs. values.
(accuracy: 1.645, 1.960, 2.326, 2.576__at most 0.003)
C) FORMULA OF VARIANCE: 0.224 versus. one got by simulation = 0.224. Really  good accuracy.

HOWEVER
If the normal model for b1 was absolutely right we should have as CRITICAL VALUES (prob.):
______0.778 (0.950) not 0.773___+0.005
______0.927 (0.975) not 0.941___-0.014
______1.100 (0.990) not 1.160___-0.060
______1.218 (0.995) not 1.305___-0.087

Which suggest strongly A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NORMAL MODEL FOR b1 AND REALITY SHOWN BY MONTE CARLO.
THESE  DIFFERENCES are monotonically larger for larger probabilities: ONE ONLY  CONCLUSION
___The coefficient has not a NORMAL DISTRIBUTION, it is somewhat more dispersive than the model is.

IN ADDITION

The mean of b1 is 0.0014 (which I feel it agrees well with E (b1) = 0).
The 4th ordinary moment is 0.1813.

Cft: _Wikipedia
___m^4 + 6 *  m^2 * sigma ^2  + 3* sigma ^4
the value is 0.0500 using the observed mean and the variance given by FORMULA.

It's too bad Luis will not do a literature search. Estimates of the
distributions of skewness and kurtosis were done years ago.

I did a paper on it. Some of it is on my URL, but it is incomplete. I need
to find the time to finish it.

One of the Johnson's distributions was found to fit. The problem was that
the distribution would not work for small samples where N is less than 8.

My comment

I’ve proved that the modified variance (sub size, not sub size minus 1), you suggested together with the correct variance simply DOESN`T work: In fact the formula, you indicated, for the variance is CORRECT but useless to find correct Critical Values. I’m limited to free NET bibliography (and some ELEMENTARY text- books). I’ll try Johnson’s Distributions.
Thank you by your concern.

MY COMMENT

WHAT NEEDED TO ADD to diagnostic?  Jack Tomsky shows complete ignorance on MONTE CARLO methods should leading  to prohibition to post anything concerning STATISTICS, if a REFEREE TEAM was in charge.
The difference between *Model Exactness* and *Numerical Exactness* is remember to students on the First Trimester of Elementary Statistics Course, here, in Portugal. In North America is unknown even by Ph D´s has Jack Tomsky...
The same confusion he shows between the symbol, H0: m=m0 , which he READS AS AN ALGEBRAIC EQUATION and the quest IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR NOT REJECT H0.

A Teacher’s first concern should be to emphasize that one cannot bring deterministic way to think (even though it’s an intellectual achievement) to the field of random experiments.
This point is dramatically important concerning Hypotheses Tests. I always fought the prejudice that
_____ONE ARE ABLE TO PROVE THE TRUELESS OR FALSITY ABOUT THE POPULATION´S PARAMETER VALUES_______
The tests are UNABLE to do so and it is absolutely immaterial:  if  the mean value of a Population is ½ (exactly) or the means of two of them are equal (exactly).
THIS DOESN`T MATTER AT ALL.
We accept or fail to accept H0 in accordance with the data, OF COURSE, but it is not BECAUSE the Hypotheses is true or false , but MERELY BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THEY ARE DIFFERENT or , alternatively , there is sufficient evidence they are.
The simple way to be sure that THIS IS THE RIGHT INTERPRETATION try to prove that a coin is fair by tossing (flipping) it!!!!
To a test is associated the
____ERROR TYPE I: H0 is TRUE but the test failed to accept it.  (False  negative).
____ERROR TYPE II : H0 is FALSE, however the test  accept this hypotheses.  (False  positive).

The *Reader* Jack Tomsky tried to state that I never was able to get a conclusion from statistical tests, CRIMINALY AND DIFAMING has he uses to be.
FURTHERMORE, after several months I insist on this same point, I focused, HE ASCRIBED TO ME I STATE THAT THE NULL COULD BE PROVED TRUE!

MY COMMENT

Generally speaking the parameter space (PS) is a sub-set Sn belonging to Rn (REAL n-dimensional space): Therefore there are infinite points (x1,x2, …, xn) that belongs to Sn.
To be clear suppose that n=1: the interval (could be the union of intervals) such that H0 should be not accepted is the REJECTION INTERVAL: It’s complementary, THE ACCEPTANCE INTERVAL (not rejection) is formed by INFINITE points each of them similar in what concerns the decision rule: TAKE H0 HAS IT WAS TRUE BUT, NEVER H0.IS PROVED TRUE
If it was possible to prove H0 be TRUE it was possible to evaluate the minimum number of tosses (flips) to prove a coin is fair (probability heads-up = 0.5).

I didn´t REFER (NEVER) what was the sample size which is ABSOLUTELY out of context: remember that the point was PARAMETER´s SPACE Jack Tomsky inconsiderately accused me not to know what it was.
The example above Sn (a sub-set of the Rn space) is REFERRING TO THE PARAMETER´s SPACE. To deal with such a general (finite) space I´ll consider the case of the test statistics depending from n parameters.

So in your notation, x1, x2, ..., xn are parameters and are also test statistics.  That's why you keep getting them interchanged, by calling them the same.

OK, I’m bored to ear you and the respective nonsense. When you show that you finally learned something about Monte Carlo (Lilliefor´s Test, DKW inequality, Great Numbers Law, etc) and the Empirical Distribution Law as indispensable to build up CONFIDENCE INTERVALS?

That is not true.  The distribution of the test statistic has to be calculated by setting the unknown paramters to values under the assumptions of the null hypothesis, not the sample statistics.

My response

The Jack Tomsky growing dyslexic illness prevent him to find the difference between a model exact (Monte Carlo) and a numerically exact model. I had the opportunity to stress that the conventional way to present mathematical statistics in what concerns test hypotheses is , generally speaking, a full mess of solving it, substituting the proposed problem by other, different, that has analytical solution and furthermore this solution is only correct asymptotically (infinite data). We use a twice wrong algorithm.
This is known from all time, teachers in Math. Statistics do not fail to note it.
Monte Carlo is, by its own construction, model correct, however they could not provide values free of random fluctuations. All Statisticians agree that Monte Carlo is an accurate tool to provide solutions free from the pointing out errors. Thy have being used thoroughly and they will forever.

But it is well-known that the sample skewness is not exactly Normally distributed. In particular, it is known that the distribution of the sample skewness has a finite upper bound (depending on the sample size), which obviously counter-indicates (argues against) a Normal distribution being a good approximation over the whole range. For example, I found

http://interstat.statjournals.net/YEAR/2000/articles/0001002.pdf

which provides what looks to be a tight bound .... the square of the skewness coefficient must be less than or equal to

bound = n-3 +(1/(n-1)) .

where n=sample size. I think a simpler bound is sometimes given.

Thus what you could be trying to do is to find, for given percentage points, how large the sample size needs to be for a simple Normal approximation to be &quot;good enough&quot; ... but the &quot;minimum sample size&quot; will vary with the desired percentage points (although this may only be noticeable if looking at very extreme percentage points). Hopefully, any text quoting the Normal approximation as being useable would indicate such ranges of validity.
