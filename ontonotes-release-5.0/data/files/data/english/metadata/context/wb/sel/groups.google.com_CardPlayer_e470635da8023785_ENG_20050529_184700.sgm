Excerpt from David Sklansky's &quot;Winning Poker&quot; (now called &quot;Theory of
Poker&quot;) Chapter 18:

BLUFFING

The 1978 no-limit hold 'em world championship at the Horseshoe in
Las Vegas came down to a battle between owlish Bobby Baldwin of
Tulsa, Oklahoma, and sartorial real-estate magnate Crandall
Addington of San Antonio, Texas. An hour before the championship
ended, Addington had $275,000, and Baldwin, about half as much-
$145,000. Among the gamblers along the rail Addington was the clear
favorite, but then came the hand that turned everything around.
Acting first, Baldwin bet before the flop, and Addington called. The
flop came Qd ,4d ,3c. Baldwin pushed in another $30,000 worth of
chips, perhaps chasing a straight or a diamond flush. Then again he
might have had a pair of queens. But Addington promptly called the
$30,000. Obviously he had a good hand himself.

On Fourth Street the ace of diamonds fell-a scary-looking card-and
by that time there was $92,000 in the pot. Slowly and deliberately
Baldwin pushed in one $10,000 stack of chips, then another and
another, until there were nine stacks in the center of the table.
Finally, with something of a flourish, Baldwin placed a short stack
of $5,000 on top of the others. He was making a $95,000 bet, leaving
himself almost broke.

Addington deliberated for a long time. He glanced at the stack of
chips, and then at Baldwin for some clue. Was the kid bluffing? If
Addington called the bet and won, Baldwin would be just about tapped
out. If he called the bet and lost, Baldwin would take a commanding
lead. Was the kid bluffing or not? Addington decided he wasn't and
threw away his hand. As Baldwin raked in the $92,000 pot, he made
sure to flash his two hole cards in Addington's direction. They were
the 9 and 10 of hearts. Worthless. Baldwin had indeed been bluffing.
Addington seemed to get rattled, and an hour later Baldwin won all
the chips and became the 1978 poker champion of the world.

THE MYTH OF BLUFFING

Successful bluffs, particularly in a high-stakes game, have great
drama. Furthermore, people who do not play much poker often think
that bluffing is the central element of the game. When Stu Ungar
appeared on the Merv Griffin Show the day after he won the 1980
world poker championship, the first question Griffin asked him
was, &quot;Did you bluff very much?&quot; Many occasional players who visit
Las Vegas are constantly bluffing in the small $1-$3 and $1-$4
games, and they pay dearly for their foolishness.

It's true bluffing is an important aspect of poker, but it is only
one part of the game, certainly no more important than playing your
legitimate hands correctly. Though a player who never bluffs cannot
expect to win as much money as someone who bluffs with the proper
frequency, most average players tend to bluff too much, particularly
in limit games. When it costs an opponent only one more bet to see
your hand, it is difficult to get away with a bluff, for with any
kind of hand your opponent is usually getting sufficient pot odds to
call your bet-especially if he has seen you trying to bluff several
times already.

THE REALITY OF BLUFFING

With this proviso, it must be repeated that from a theoretical point
of view, bluffing is an extremely important aspect of poker. As a
deceptive weapon, it is at least as important as slow playing.
Whereas slow playing suggests weakness when you have strength,
bluffing announces strength when you are weak. Recollect the
Fundamental Theorem of Poker: any time an opponent plays his hand
incorrectly based on what you have, you have gained; and any time he
plays his hand correctly based on what you have, you have lost. An
opponent who knows you never bluff is much less likely to play his
hand incorrectly. Any time you bet, he will know you are betting for
value. He will play only when he figures he has a better hand than
yours or when he is getting sufficient pot odds to call with more
cards to come. Bluffing, then, or the possibility that you might be
bluffing, is another way of keeping your opponents guessing. Your
occasional bluffs disguise not just the hands with which you are in
fact bluffing but also your legitimate hands, with which your
opponents know you might be bluffing.

To see how important bluffing is, imagine that you are up against an
opponent who on the last round bets $20 into a $100 pot. You are
getting 6 to 1 from the pot if you call. However, you know you can
only win, as is often the case, if your opponent is bluffing. Let's
say you know three opponents well. The first never bluffs in this
spot, so your response to that player's bet is easy: you fold with
the full knowledge that you have not cost yourself any money. The
second opponent frequently bluffs. Once again your response is easy:
you call, knowing you are going to win that last bet so often that
calling must result in a long-run profit. The third player is the
problem. He bets in such a way that the odds are about 6 to 1
against his bluffing. In fact, he can tell you in advance that if he
bets, he will be bluffing once in seven times.
Now you have a tough decision. You must choose between two equally
upsetting alternatives. You are getting 6 to 1 from a pot you can
win only if your opponent is bluffing, and the odds against your
opponent's bluffing are 6 to 1. If you fold, you know there's a
chance your opponent stole the pot from you; but if you call, you
know that six times out of seven you are simply donating your money
to your opponent. Thus, a person who bluffs with approximately the
right frequency-and also, of course, in a random way-is a much
better poker player and will win much more money in the long run
than a person who virtually never bluffs or a person who bluffs too
much. The person who never bluffs will never get much action. The
person who always bluffs will get all the action he wants until he
runs out of money. But the person who bluffs correctly keeps his
true holdings disguised and is constantly forcing his opponents into
tough decisions, some of which are bound to be wrong.

OPTIMUM BLUFFING FREQUENCY

What is the right bluffing frequency? It is a frequency that makes
it impossible for your opponents to know whether to call or fold.
Mathematically, optimal bluffing strategy is to bluff in such a way
that the chances against your bluffing are identical to the pot odds
your opponent is getting. Thus, if, as in the example just given, an
opponent is getting 6 to 1 from the pot, the chances against your
bluffing should be 6 to 1. Then that opponent would break even on
the last bet by calling every time and also by folding every time.
If he called, he would lose $20 six times and win $120 once; if he
folded, he would win nothing and lose nothing. Regardless of what
your opponent does, you average winning an extra $100 every seven
hands. However, mathematically optimal bluffing strategy isn't
necessarily the best strategy. It is much better if you are able to
judge when to try a bluff and when not to in order to show a bigger
overall profit.
To make sure we agree on what is meant by a bluff, we will define it
as a bet or a raise with a hand which you do not think is the best
hand. Bluffing can be separated into a couple of different
categories. There is bluffing when there are more cards to come and
when there are no more cards to come. Secondly, within each of these
categories, there is intuitive bluffing, which is the subject of
this chapter, and mathematical bluffing, which will be discussed in
the next chapter.
