&quot;PROVIDENCE, R.I. - Oscar the cat seems to have an uncanny knack for
predicting when nursing home patients are going to die, by curling up
next to them during their final hours. His accuracy, observed in 25
cases, has led the staff to call family members once he has chosen
someone. It usually means they have less than four hours to live....&quot;

Has no one considered, I don't know, a respitory link?

If a human predicted other's deaths with uncanny accuracy, they would be
a suspect.

I think that what they really suspect is that the cat is finally
getting a chance to curl up in a warm bed with someone who won't
thrash around and steal the covers.

So you're saying Oscar should go into respite care?

I don't find this story surprising.  They've also discovered that some
dogs can smell cancer.  Which could make mammograms a lot less
intimidating, really.

I suspect that they can smell a human body, and a place where a human

I don't think it would do any good.  I just noticed the dateline in the
story:  PROVIDENCE, R.I.  No doubt about it.  It' witchcraft.

That tappy sound you hear in the back ground may be a typewriter.  I think
Stephen King still uses one.

&gt;&gt;I've often wondered if dogs can really smell fear and might be useful
&gt;&gt;to the police in those tragic stories which involve &quot;... was held
&gt;&gt;captive inside the suspect's home for several weeks before...&quot;.
&gt;I suspect that they can smell a human body, and a place where a human
&gt;body was kept.  The fear angle may not be necessary.
">

I was thinking of being able to detect fear as a general screening
tool, when a specific person or crime might not be known.  Fear,
especially if it can be discerned from worry or nervousness, is an
early indicator of several types of criminal behavior.  Victims of
abduction, assault, abuse and so on are likely to be afraid.  If such
fear could be detected from the street outside a building it might be
useful.

Of course much fear isn't crime related and there would be civil
liberties issues to be addressed.  I'm just curious if it would be
technically possible.

I fail to see what this would accomplish aside from filling our prisons
with people who are afraid of dogs.

The New England Journal of Medicine has the article &quot;A Day in the Life of
Oscar the Cat&quot; by David M. Dosa, M.D., M.P.H. :

http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/4/328
&quot;One hour passes. Oscar waits. A nurse walks into the room to check on
her patient. She pauses to note Oscar's presence. Concerned, she
hurriedly leaves the room and returns to her desk. She grabs Mrs. K.'s
chart off the medical-records rack and begins to make phone calls.

&quot;Within a half hour the family starts to arrive. Chairs are brought into
the room, where the relatives begin their vigil. The priest is called to
deliver last rites. And still, Oscar has not budged, instead purring and
gently nuzzling Mrs. K. . . Thirty minutes later, Mrs. K. takes her last
earthly breath.&quot;
