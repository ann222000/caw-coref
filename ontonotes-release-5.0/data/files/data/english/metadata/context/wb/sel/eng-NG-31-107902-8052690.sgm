My mechanic broke off a sparkplug trying to remove it from the engine
on my 4runner and I am trying to research possible solutions.  It
broke off halfway down the threads, so that half of the bottom metal
part is still in the engine head.  I was thinking using and easyoff
extractor but worry about metal pieces includint the electrode tip
falling into the cylinder.  Anyone have ideas or experience with this?
thanks, rick

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It's not really the mechanic's fault, so I think he would be justified in
charging to remove the head and take the plug out at the bench, using an
easy-out, a drill, or whatever means he has available.

I assume you are trying to reduce the labor.  I would go ahead and use an
Easy-out, and then, before running the engine, turn it over with the starter
for a minute or so, to pump air in and out the spark-plug hole.  This will
most likely blow out any small stuff that may have fallen in.  In addition,
you could position the piston at bottom-dead-center, and then shove a vacuum
hose in and wiggle it around a lot.  You could also dump in some oil, and
then turn the engine by hand, pumping the oil out the spark-plug hole, which
will also help flush out things that could have fallen in.

If any really little stuff remains, I would expect it to be blown out the
exhaust valve when the engine is started, causing no harm.

If the threads in the spark-plug hole are damaged in the process of removing
the plug, it's very easy to Helicoil it.  A Helicoil is actually stronger
than cast iron or aluminum, so the results are better than new.

Slightly OT:  I once had a mechanic Helicoil the spark plug hole in the
number 3 cylinder of my VW, using a mirror.  There was someone with real
mechanics hands.

Man, you can say that again! I've used &quot;easy&quot;-outs a bunch of times and
most turned into, as you say, hole pluggers. Then you really have a

'Never hear of a &quot;left-hand drill&quot;?  For many extraction jobs, that's the
ticket.  If sized appropriately, it doesn't tend to expand the item in the
hole, rather, it &quot;grips&quot; from the top.

If he managed to break a sparkplug off down into the threads, you have a
lot more to worry about than a few metal flakes getting into the engine.
That plug must be welded in.  I've NEVER, in all my years of working
on cars and trucks, seen the metal part of a plug break.  The ceramic,
yes, the metal, no.  If you have to get crazy with it, an oil soaked rag
in the top of the cylinder, with the piston at TDC should take care of
most particles. After you get the remains of the plug out, carefully
remove the oil soaked cloth.  The metal shavings, for the most part,
should come out with it.  If all else fails, he will have to remove the
head and drill it out and retap the head.

Don't be TOO sure....

About a year ago my daughter had her Olds tuned up, which included a new
set of plugs. A week later the engine started running rough and the shop
which did the job found that the ground electrode on one plug had
disappeared, and installed a new plug at no cost. The car seemed to be
running fine after that.

Nearly a year later when she went to get the car through state
inspection it failed because its computer &quot;said&quot; one cylinder had been
firing &quot;weakly&quot; too often.

A leakdown test at my favorite mechanic's shop showed that the cylinder
with the failed sparkplug was in trouble. When the cylinder head was
pulled there was a &quot;dent&quot; in it's exhaust valve's head just about the
right size to have been made by the valve banging against that buted off
spark plug electrode.

The shop which did the original tuneup had closed, so her daddy got
tapped for a $750 valve job so the car would make it through state
inspection.  He's still cursing whoever screwed up welding the electrode
onto that original spark plug's body. &lt;G&gt;

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
My suggestions were:  1.)  Crank the engine to blow air in and out of the
spark plug hole.  2.)  Blow it out with compressed air.  3.)  Clean it out
with a vacuum hose.  4.)  Fill cylinder with oil and expell the oil by hand
cranking.

From what you say, I would NOT do step 1.), because that's where the valve
could opened against a piece of debris, trapping it against the inside of
the head.  (Kind of like what happens when the timing belt breaks on an
interference engine.)

I would be very leery about just letting chips blow out the spark plug hole.  It
may work and it may not.  I had a spark plug insulator crack while I was driving
the car once, and the chip got caught between the exhaust valve face, and the
valve seat.  Put a nice big chip in the valve and I had to pull the head to
replace the valve.  I realize this is a different scenario, but it shows what
can happen with a small piece of loose insulator.

You will most likely get all the big pieces out by vacuuming, etc., so you
probably won't have anything like this happen.  But even small amounts of debris
MIGHT get caught on the valve face and COULD result in the valve not sealing
properly when closed.  Not only that, but some small pieces MIGHT get caught
between the piston and the cylinder wall which could yield some nice scratches
in your cylinder wall with resulting loss of compression and oil seepage into
the combustion chamber.

But if it comes down to a few hundred dollars to pull the head to remove the
plug, or just a few dollars to try something else . . .your call.  Is the car
worth enough to do the job properly, or is it an old beater that you just need
to get running for a while?

Just my $.02

Just for shits and grins, how many of you have ever encountered one of
the early Champion spark plugs which comes apart for cleaning?

Mine was pretty beat up when I found it at an antique store in Minnesota.

Something is wrong with that story.

Put a old plug in your bench vise and try to do that
with a hammer and chisel to see what I mean.
Drilling or even beating out the center of a plug when
it's installed would be a good trick. Even in a vice its
real tuff.

You have two threads going...

The only safe way to do it is to remove the head, but you already knew
that right.  ;-)

If there is still a core in the plug, it can only fall 'in' when messed
with so....

Did 'all' of the plug come out except the last bit of thread?  If so
then the easy out might be a first option.

'If' you try the easy out, I personally wouldn't recommend it, but, you
should spray the piece down with a 'good' penetrating oil like PB
Blaster several times before you start.

I would also have the cylinder on the intake or exhaust stroke so there
would maybe be a chance of a shopvac sucking out any crumbs that fell in
because the open valve would allow air flow with the suction on the plug
hole.

Good luck!

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I think it might be better to be near bottom-dead-center on the power stroke
or the compression stroke, so both valves are closed, and the debris is well
below the spark plug hole.  That gives you a good angle for picking up any
debris.  Use a suction tube that is smaller than the park plug hole, so air
can flow in.

I assume you're talking about an EasyOut.  An EasyOut probably won't
work.  You need quite a bit of metal in order to use an EasyOut.  You
need to drill a pilot-hole about 1/4&quot; to 1/2&quot; deep but not all the way
through.  Then the EasyOut threads into the pilot-hole using left-hand
threads and bottoms out in the hole.  You keep tightening it up until
it breaks the bolt loose.  You won't have enough metal in a sparkplug
to do this.

However if you are talking about an easyoff, I don't know what that is
or if it will work.

&gt;the car once, and the chip got caught between the exhaust valve face, and the
&gt;valve seat.  Put a nice big chip in the valve and I had to pull the head to
&gt;replace the valve.  I realize this is a different scenario, but it shows what
&gt;can happen with a small piece of loose insulator.

&gt;You will most likely get all the big pieces out by vacuuming, etc., so you
&gt;probably won't have anything like this happen.  But even small amounts of debris
&gt;MIGHT get caught on the valve face and COULD result in the valve not sealing
&gt;properly when closed.  Not only that, but some small pieces MIGHT get caught
&gt;between the piston and the cylinder wall which could yield some nice scratches
&gt;in your cylinder wall with resulting loss of compression and oil seepage into
&gt;the combustion chamber.

&gt;But if it comes down to a few hundred dollars to pull the head to remove the
&gt;plug, or just a few dollars to try something else . . .your call.  Is the car
&gt;worth enough to do the job properly, or is it an old beater that you just need

PULL THE HEAD. And put antiseize on the plugs when you put them back

&gt;Something is wrong with that story.

&gt;Put a old plug in your bench vise and try to do that
&gt;with a hammer and chisel to see what I mean.
&gt;Drilling or even beating out the center of a plug when
&gt;it's installed would be a good trick. Even in a vice its

Long reach plug, threaded only half way COULD break off part way down

&gt;I think it might be better to be near bottom-dead-center on the power stroke

TDC on overlap - both valves open to allow LOTS of air flow and keep
the chips close to the hole so the airflow can pull them out.

Grease whatever tools you use so chips stick to them. If drilling,
drill SLOW and &quot;peck&quot; so you pull all the chips out of the hole with
the greased bit.

But to be SAFE, pull the head.

I've seem a fair number of tapered seat plugs (specifically FORD, but
also a few others) snap off at the top of the threads. Some AC 14mm
long thread plugs were threaded ONLY on the bottom half. I've seen
these snap off low in the hole as well. In over 38 years of wrenching
I've broken a few plugs off - but VERY few. I learned early to take it
easy, use lots of good penetrant, and take my time. It ALWAYS takes
longer to take out a broken plug than to finesse it out in the first
place (possible exception is an air cooled flathead)

&gt;&gt;If he managed to break a sparkplug off down into the threads, you have a
&gt;&gt;lot more to worry about than a few metal flakes getting into the engine.
&gt;&gt; That plug must be welded in.  I've NEVER, in all my years of working
&gt;&gt;on cars and trucks, seen the metal part of a plug break.  The ceramic,
&gt;&gt;yes, the metal, no.  If you have to get crazy with it, an oil soaked rag
&gt;&gt;in the top of the cylinder, with the piston at TDC should take care of
&gt;&gt;most particles. After you get the remains of the plug out, carefully
&gt;&gt;remove the oil soaked cloth.  The metal shavings, for the most part,
&gt;&gt;should come out with it.  If all else fails, he will have to remove the
&gt;&gt;head and drill it out and retap the head.

You use a strip of cloth about two inches wide.  Soak it in motor oil
and insert it through what hole there is.  I assume that there is a hole
since spark plugs are usually hollow down by the threads and that is
where he said the plug broke off, midway down the threads.  The
assumption here is that the center core of the plug came out and he just
has the metal threads in the plug hole.  Otherwise this trick won't
work.  I used it one time and it worked quite well.

&gt; &gt;&gt; that breaks off in the head.......................

&gt; &gt;&gt; They SHOULD be called &quot;hole-pluggers&quot;..........

&gt; &gt; Man, you can say that again! I've used &quot;easy&quot;-outs a bunch of times and
&gt; &gt; most turned into, as you say, hole pluggers. Then you really have a
&gt; &gt; problem: How do you drill out that hardenen steel? Interestingly enough,
&gt; &gt; apparently I never learn the lesson. Each time I have a broken bolt, I
&gt; &gt; look at my collection of easy-outs and think, maybe this time...

&gt; 'Never hear of a &quot;left-hand drill&quot;?  For many extraction jobs, that's the
&gt; ticket.  If sized appropriately, it doesn't tend to expand the item in the
&gt; hole, rather, it &quot;grips&quot; from the top.

&gt; LLoyd
">

I agree, the left hand drill is best way to start working on many
broken fasteners.  If you are going to have to drill it anyway, you
might as well use the left hand drill and give it a chance to come out
before you do anything else.

I've had fairly good luck with easy-outs.  You have to know when and
how to use them, though.  If a screw snapped because it bottomed out
in the hole or was cross-threaded or corroded into place, the easy-out
is not as likely to be effective as it is if the screw failed due to
shearing or tension.  The most common mistake people make with easy-
outs is using too large a size.  The thinner the walls of the broken
screw are, the more likely the easy-out is to expand them and lock the
threads.  While the larger easy-out is of course stronger, it's better
to first try a smaller size that will not expand the screw.  There are
some non-tapered screw removers with straight splines that work
without expanding the screw.

It's hard to imagine why a spark plug would break in the middle of the
threads - usually the undercut at the shoulder is the weak area.

Two points in this thread got my attention:

1.  Never-Seize.  I've heard at least once that there are good reasons
NOT to use it on spark plug threads, but I can't remember what they
were.  Yes or no?

2.  Better to remove plugs hot or cold?  Posters in this thread have
it both ways.

I am actually repeating the recommendations from shop manuals and plug
manufacturers (remove plugs when cold). The question is, what has
expanded more when hot, the heads (making the hole larger) or the
plugs, making the fit tighter. Aluminum expands at a higher rate than
steel, but it also cools faster, particularly on a water cooled engine
where the water in the head should limit the peak temperature of the
aluminum head to a lower value than the steel sleeve of the spark
plugs. As things cool, I suspect the aluminum head will cool much
faster. So it may be that the fit is actually tighter when the head is
hot, not looser as you are suggesting. But even if it is isn't, what
happens when you screw the new cold new plug into the hot (or at least
warm) aluminum head? The thread fit will be looser than designed and
this might make the torque applied incorrect, or make the thread
easier to strip. The original plugs and head were cold when assembled,
so it only makes sense to me that the same is true for the
replacements.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I think that &quot;hot&quot; refers to an engine at operating temperature.  &quot;Cold&quot;
refers to an engine that is essentially at ambient temperature.  The rate of
heating or cooling does not enter into the discussion.  Since aluminum has a
higher coefficient of expansion, it will result in more clearance around the
threads on a hot engine.

But note that the head and plug expand and contract in a vertical direction
also.  The head gets thicker when it is hot, more than the plug expands, so
the gasket is more compressed.  That sounds like a plus to me.

&gt; plugs. As things cool, I suspect the aluminum head will cool much
&gt; faster. So it may be that the fit is actually tighter when the head
&gt; is  hot, not looser as you are suggesting (clip)
&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; I think that &quot;hot&quot; refers to an engine at operating temperature.
&gt; &quot;Cold&quot; refers to an engine that is essentially at ambient
&gt; temperature.  The rate of heating or cooling does not enter into the
&gt; discussion.  Since aluminum has a higher coefficient of expansion,
&gt; it will result in more clearance around the threads on a hot engine.

&gt; But note that the head and plug expand and contract in a vertical
&gt; direction also.  The head gets thicker when it is hot, more than the
&gt; plug expands, so the gasket is more compressed.  That sounds like a
&gt; plus to me.
">

When you are changing plugs you are not talking about an engine that
is &quot;operating.&quot; You are somewhere between steady state operating
conditions and cold. If you try to change the plugs before the engine
is &quot;cold,&quot; the temperature of the parts is changing constantly as you
work. Under operating conditions I am guessing the body of the plug is
much hotter than the surrounding metal of the cylinder head. Part of
the plug is actually down in the combustion chamber. There is
discontinuity between the plug and cylinder head, adding an impediment
to thermal transfer. The actual head has internal water passages, so
the maximum head material temperature is limited. When you turn the
engine off, the aluminum head cools much faster than the spark plug.
The effect on the forces needed to remove the plug is not clear to me,
but it is certainly changing as the engine cools. I just can't see how
it is better to change the plugs during this period of time (as the
engine cools) that waiting for it to reach ambient conditions.

The situation as the OP described it is quite common.....and the often DO
break right at the top of the threads.

Steel spark plugs in aluminum heads can create some electrolytic activity.

100,000 mile plug change intervals simply give this activity longer to do
its job.

Stop by virtually ANY professional automotive machine shop, and there's a
good chance that there is a head or two that have been dropped off and
sitting in the &quot;To-Do&quot; pile, awaiting a spark plug threadectomy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1.  Never-Seize.  I've heard at least once that there are good reasons
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;NOT to use it on spark plug threads, but I can't remember what they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;were.  Yes or no?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Autolite says not to use anti-seize becasue it can contaminat the spark plug insulator and short out the plug (anti-seize
&gt;&gt;&gt; includes metallic elements). NKG says it is not necessary with their plugs becasue of the plug construction and they recommend
&gt;&gt;&gt; against its use becasue the lubricating properties of the anti-seize can lead to improper torquing of the plugs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2.  Better to remove plugs hot or cold?  Posters in this thread have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it both ways.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In an aluminum head you should remove the plugs when the head is cold.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ed

&gt;&gt; We've all learned that a hole in a block of metal gets larger when the metal expands and the coefficient of thermal expansion for
&gt;&gt; aluminum is about twice that of steel, so I'd expect the diametrical fit to get looser when the head gets warm.

&gt;&gt; But I'm willing to learn something new every day, so why do you say you should remove the plugs when the head is cold? (Maybe it
&gt;&gt; has something to do with the relative change in thread pitches at different temperatures? Naw...)

&gt;&gt; Jeff

&gt; I am actually repeating the recommendations from shop manuals and plug manufacturers (remove plugs when cold). The question is,
&gt; what has expanded more when hot, the heads (making the hole larger) or the plugs, making the fit tighter. Aluminum expands at a
&gt; higher rate than steel, but it also cools faster, particularly on a water cooled engine where the water in the head should limit
&gt; the peak temperature of the aluminum head to a lower value than the steel sleeve of the spark plugs. As things cool, I suspect the
&gt; aluminum head will cool much faster. So it may be that the fit is actually tighter when the head is hot, not looser as you are
&gt; suggesting. But even if it is isn't, what happens when you screw the new cold new plug into the hot (or at least warm) aluminum
&gt; head? The thread fit will be looser than designed and this might make the torque applied incorrect, or make the thread easier to
&gt; strip. The original plugs and head were cold when assembled, so it only makes sense to me that the same is true for the
&gt; replacements.

line is:
Plug broke-off in head, now what??

..where he says the dealer's mechanic said the plug broke off while trying
to remove it, and that the &quot;Initial estimate is $1700&quot;

That's a fuctup situation to be in, and the resolution needs to be
negotiated cautiously, to obtain favorable results, IMO.
It's time for a lawyer, sorry situation but likely, if the dealer won't take
care of most of the cost of the repair, and also warranty the work.

In a GM dealership garage in the '70s, that type of problem was a Code 59,
damage incurred as a result of service work. The shop eats the cost.

The OP might be busy looking for another vehicle.

Depending on the vehicle, that is write off territory....

I got a great Volvo Wagon that way a few years back for $50.00.  The
headgasket was blown and the cost to fix it was in the same range.  The
owner basically scrapped the car rather than pay that.

My son and I changed out the gasket in an afternoon and drove the car
for 4 years, then sold it for $50.00.  The AC even still worked...

I think many folks today need transportation, although I don't assume to
know about the OPs situation.

When the estimate is used with a dollar amount, it sometimes means the
consumer is gonna get raked over the coals.
This estimate, given when the dealer should be taking care of the damage
IMO, seems to indicate to me that the car owner is likely going to be taken
advantage of.
As I suggested with the service Code 59, policies were (are?) in place to
cover these types of situations.

I suppose the situation may have other details concerning where the
responsibility of the repair costs which may apply.. such as if the car was
purchased by the present owner, at that dealer, and if the car had received
regular service at the same dealer (the car's original, or sparkplugs
installed by that dealer, for example).
Still, the damage was done in the dealer's garage, and IMO, that's their
responsibility, not just because the dealer probably has more assets than
the car owner, but more along the lines of &quot;you break it, you buy it&quot;.

The details of the repair are parts, and labor. If I broke off a sparkplug
in my home shop, and took it to a dealer to be fixed, the costs might
actually be $1700. That's generally list price for the parts (dealer
profit), plus the shop labor rate (about $72/hr here, but not the mechanic's
hourly pay). So, the dealer isn't losing $1700 by doing the repair.
But it seems that the car owner didn't cause the damage in this case.

As another response indicated, many folks do just get replacement cars, and
I recently discovered this same thing, when I was looking for info about the
high numbers of GM speedometer failures in late model cars and trucks.
One forum had over 600 posts, and quite a few car owners that were given
estimates in the range of $500 (from GM dealers), decided to go buy other
(non-GM) vehicles instead of paying for something out of their own pockets,
which they felt was GM's responsibility.
There were several situations where the GM dealers took care of the repairs,
even though the owner's cars may have been out of warranty. Different
situation, though.
