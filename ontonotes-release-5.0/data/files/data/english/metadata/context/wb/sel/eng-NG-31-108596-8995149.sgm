I had a most unpleasant experience yesterday and would appreciate any
reactions and feedback:

Diagnosed in mid-August with Prostate Cancer:

Age-59-good health
T1c stage
Gleason score 6 (3+3)
PSA 3.17 as of August, 2007
PSA doubled in 22 months

I have gotten several opinions and have decided that if Insurance won't
pay for the Cyberknife I will go with either the lo-dose or high-dose
brachytherapy.

Upon the urging of a close friend who has a Urologist friend on the
staff at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J.  the former
told me to contact the Urologist who as a &quot;professional courtesy&quot; to
him , would review my numbers.  I emailed a letter to the Urologist
explaining that I appreciate his offer and would like a few minutes of
his time &quot;by phone&quot; to review my biopsy numbers and very simple CT and
Bone Scan reports which I attached to the email.

I then called the Urologist a week later and he claimed he never
received the data and that he wanted me to come to see him in his
office saying that he needed to see me in person for among other things
to &quot;see what 'body type you have&quot;.  I reiterated that I simply wanted
him to look at the &quot;numbers&quot; and to give me some feedback based upon
this information and nothing else.  I had a Radiation Oncologist do
this by phone a few weeks before.

The Urologist however insisted I come in and not wanting to appear to
be an ingrate , (remember I was led to believe this opinion was as a
favor to our mutual friend and on my behalf) I made an appointment and
saw him the other day.  He ran through some tests (none of which I
thought were necessary inasmuch as I recently had them taken).  Tests
were urine sample, DRE, took some ultrasound gel and put it on my lower
belly and used the ultrasound head to determine that I wasn't retaining
much urine.  That test took about 30-45 seconds.  He then gave me a
cursory check of my lymph nodes by palpation all the while racking up
CPT procedure codes as far as I can tell.

Then we went into his office and he proceeded to give me a very
aggressive and unseemly &quot;sales pitch&quot; for the DaVinci Robot at St.
Barnabas for radical prostatectomy.  This was not a &quot;medical opinion&quot;
in any lucid understanding of that term.  It was a naked and shameless
&quot;sales pitch&quot; to get me to leave my currently affiliated-with hospital
(Overlook in Summit, New Jersey) and get me to come to St. Barnabas to
undergo the most aggressive procedure, robot or not.  I told him at the
outset that I had no interest in the rad. pros. inasmuch as I am
interested in the less invasive procedures such as CyberKnife or a type
of Brachytherapy and I am a perfect candidate for those.

The Urologist then insisted on conference calling his friend -a
Radiation Oncologist all the while telling him I told him not to bother
with the call but he went ahead and got the Radiation Oncologist on the
phone who then proceeded to badmouth the CyberKnife and by implication
my hospital.  This was nakedly unethical and simply very sleazy.

Bottom line:  I spent about an hour with this jerk and was presented
with a bill for $530.00.  What could I do but sign the credit card
form?  My sick mother and father were waiting for me in the waiting
room and it was no situation in which to cause a ruckus. He does not
accept insurance but his office will transmit the billing information
to my insurance carrier and they will pay whatever they decide to pay,
which is probably next to nothing.  I believe he reeled me in like a
fish with no intention but to try to pull me over to his hospital and
to rack up an unconscionable fee.

I intend to dispute the charge with my Visa card company for starters.
I would appreciate any feedback on this and how I might address this
ripoff.

Thanks,

Sy

Sy, like any other professions, you've come accross one that needs to
be
posted on the internet, so that others in the future (those that used
the internet
to do their initial research) can hopefully see your post and
experience.
You need to name him.

My numbers  and age are very similar to yours and I was diagnosed
mid-2006
and had my RT in February this year.  The Uro that did my biopsy
recommended
surgery. Second opinion was also by a surgeon who suggested surgery
and he
LOST INTEREST when I said I am leaning toward RT. Third opinion was by
an RT Onc who just started his own IMRT business, so he was very
eager
get me to sign up. Fourth opinion was also a surgeon, but he had an
open mind
and gave me options in both surgery and radiation, even referred me to
another
Rad Onc there. I keep on looking and a 6-7 months later decided on
SBRT,
which I am quite happy with, so far. So my advice is, take your time,
and
research, research, and research. Although you do have a G3+3, I'd
also
consider looking into EPCA-2 and HCA-2, just to get an additional
confirmation that you have the beast.

Hello Sy,
I can relate to your predicament in some ways and understand the emotional
roller-coaster ride you are on.
Since insurance will not pay for CyberKnife.......Will it pay for DaVinci?
I am not sure if that means the same?  Seems to me Cyber and Da Vinci are
the same?
I would base my decision as to treatment not on what insurance
believes.......
I do understand that it is important that insurance pays........
Dr.s do like &quot;in house visits&quot;
If you take a car for instance, and a mechanical problem say, most all
mechanics would rather see the car in person than do a diagnosis and
treatment plan via phone.
I found that Dr.s like anyone do try to sell their treatment options also.
It is only understandeable that one would push their service over
anothers....
When I went to several Dr.s for diagnsosis and treatment options all &quot;sold&quot;
me their plan in some form or another.  I also paid for the visit..........
I was diagnosed with prostate cancer when I was 49.....
The Urologist was very cold and hard to deal with and feel comfortable
with also.  He told me I was going to die......(we all do anyway....but this
was do to the prostate cancer)  He said the best option was External Beam
radiation......
I swallowed that and looked forward to 45 trips (one-way @ 75 miles.....that
is round trip....150miles) He gave me a Lupron Depot shot in his
office......not medical room, 1500.00 per shot......Take down your
pants....bang.
The shot apparently made the prostate smaller, as well as caused many
differing bodily ailments etc.....He never told me nada about what the shot
would do.........I learned on-line....Thats it.
I went to his Dr. friend for the visit(oncologist) He told me the
benefits of radiation also.........and did try to sell his services.....
I learned later many of the aspects that radiation could do and would do,
on-line........
I did get a very cold feeling about the direction I was headed for, and
felt very sick inside........What is going on???????

I decided to take my knowledge, (minimal and all learned on-line and from
this news group) to see other Dr. in the &quot;Big City&quot;
I was so glad I did this..............I did meet yet another Urologist
and did pay for a visit fee and did get the DRE and, and.........I was not
too happy with his speech either.......hum......
Finally I headed for Stanford Medical Center.......
I met a wonderful Dr. that studies prostate cancer.......

I did have the in office visit, and the inspection of all lab work.
He was a Surgeon......Urologist....

He looked me over like he was sizing me up, also......my personality, body
size, etc.
I think this is a way for a Dr. to feel if he can help you......
I expalined what I had done, where I had gone and how I ended up here.....
He said, &quot;I can help you&quot;

Anyway, he looked at his book and said, I have an opening on thurs.......
Do you want that?
I said yes.....he shook my hand and I felt a warmth go over my body like
no-other........I mean that!
I had surgery, RP in 1999.
I just had my last PSA and it is undectible....2007

Anyway, sorry for the long story, and realize the hardship you have with
Dr.s and insurance, and decisions.
Prostate Cancer specialists are the best Dr.s to see.
They do require in house visits....
Either it be Radiation or Surgery.
We all have to decide, and hopefully do not have to go thru too much making
that choice.

John, FYI, DaVinci is robotic laparcopy radical prostatectomy (meaning
surgery
with robot/computer assisted)
Cyberknife is an EXTERNAL beam radiation machine, not surgical
procedure.
It is more like IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy).

Sy, that doc has his kingdom, and you have to play by his rules when
there.  We all need to be very proactive and agressively speak out,
especially when we assume we're getting something for free.  &quot;Doc, I had the

he's a wonderful guy, it's just that the burden of understanding is always a

Your credit card company will demand proof that the merchant failed to
deliver the product or service you paid for, plus a copy of your written
appeal to the merchant and proof he received it prior to your CC charge
dispute. It won't matter to VISA whether you're buying a used car or a
life-saving procedure.

Maybe the best place for your protest is the state medical board.

I should add that many, maybe most, insurance companies approve and thus
fund second opinions.

They are totally different.

The CyberKnife is a computer controlled linear accelerator which
delivers high-dose radiation in an extremely precise manner to spare
healthy tissues.  It also has the ability to compensate for
patient/target movement while on the table which is very important so
that any movement doesn't cause the powerful radiation beam to hit a
healthy area.

The DaVinci Robot is a device which assists the surgeon by allowing
more precise control of the surgical tools used for very invasive
procedures like a radical prostatectomy but with somewhat less cutting.
The surgeon controlled robotic device compensates for ill-advised hand
movements which the surgeon might make if he had tremors from a
drinking binge the night before :) but the DaVinci Robot  is
nevertheless cutting into tissue, causing blood loss and the usual
surgical hazards.  If it were NECESSARY for me to go that route I would
certainly consider it but I don't want that invasive a procedure and
the good possibility of nasty sequellae.

The Urologist I saw ther other day, Hannibal Lecter said that virtually
all insurances pay for it inasmuch as it isn't performing a &quot;new&quot;
procedure but is replicating conventional rad. pros. surgery with the
alleged extra precision of the robotic device. I do believe he slipped
and made a truthful statement.

You'll have to excuse my sarcasm but this situation certainly warrants
it.  B.t.w., I have contacted my Visa card company and they have
temporarily reversed the charge until this gets settled.  I will be
sending them documentation to corroborate the facts involved.

Thanks for your feedback but it's my understanding that the rad. prost.
does not guarantee that &quot;you get it out of your body forever&quot;.

It may increase long term survival by a few percentage points but at
what quality-of-life costs?

What type of problems did you have post op?

Thanks,

&gt; he's a wonderful guy, it's just that the burden of understanding is always a
&gt; 2 way street.  By the way.... I vote for surgery. Get it out of your body

Based on your report of your experience, I'm inclined to agree
with you that you were badly treated.  However, as others have
pointed out, it may not be easy to refuse payment.

To begin with, the person was who told you that you would be seen
as a &quot;professional courtesy&quot; may well have been talking out of
his hat.  Do you have any reason to believe that he had
permission from the urologist to say such a thing?  You should
ask him.  If he didn't, then the urologist is an innocent party
as far as the &quot;courtesy&quot; consultation is concerned.  He never
offered you free advice and it is a perfectly reasonable
expectation that he should demand that you come into his office
and that he charge you.  He is, after all, running a business.
He might give free advice to friends and family, but it's a
little unreasonable to think he would he do such a thing for a
perfect stranger who happened to be a friend of a friend.

Doctors hate doing that, and for good reason.  Give a guy a free
consultation and he starts calling you back every time he has a
headache.  Maybe you wouldn't do that, but a lot of patients
would.  Then the guy starts telling his friends that they can
call Dr. Jones and get free advice.  It's a slippery slope.

Nevertheless, there were still two kinds of bad treatment in my
view:

1. Insisting on expensive tests that you didn't need.

Since you emailed the test results to the doctor, and since
you have evidence that he received the email, his denying
that he saw the data sure looks to me like he was just trying
to rip you off.

If I were the doctor and I didn't recall the email, I'd
at least make a quick search through my emails, or ask my
office manager to do it rather than repeating tests that were
already done.

2. Aggressively pushing his services instead of giving you
objective advice.

If I were a doctor and you came to me for advice, I'd tell
you what I thought were the potential advantages of surgery
vs.  radiation, and of laparoscopic vs. open surgery.  I'd
say what my specialty was and how I could help you if you
decided you wanted what I do.  If I thought that surgery was
a better option for you than radiation, I'd say so.  If I
thought that brachytherapy was better than CyberKnife, I'd
say that and explain why.

But I wouldn't try to &quot;sell&quot; anything to you.  I wouldn't try
to minimize the risks of what I could offer.  I wouldn't have
done that strange thing with the phone call to the rad onc,
and I wouldn't have tried to pad my bill.

So you were treated to an unpleasant, useless, and expensive
service but, in spite of your protestations, at no point did you
say &quot;No, I won't come in&quot; or &quot;No, I won't take that test&quot;.

Does that mean you shouldn't try to refuse payment?  Well, why
not try?  It might not work, but you don't exactly owe the sleaze
ball any better treatment than he gave you.

Good luck, and let us know how it comes out.

Alan

Alan, after my DX, the fourth opinion doctor was the one that
gave me the responses you outlined in statement #2 above. He
did not pressure me one way or the other and the final

Good analogy.  However I brought the &quot;car&quot; in (me) and he proceeded to
do &quot;unathorized work&quot; on this car.   If you have a problem of any
magnitude with your car that required &quot;work&quot; the mechanic would call
you to authorize the repairs after giving you an estimate as to the
cost.

This jerk did not get &quot;authorization&quot; for his &quot;work&quot; on me nor did he
provide any &quot;estimate&quot; of the cost.  And why should he not have
provided the same level of professional consideration on these matters
as one would have expected from their auto mechanic?

I have never been one of those people who were &quot;doctor bashers&quot;: the
type who complains if they received &quot;too&quot; many tests or complains if
they didn't receive &quot;enough&quot; tests.  The type who expect a doctor to
cure everything and cause you to live to be 125 years of age.

&gt; I found that Dr.s like anyone do try to sell their treatment options also.
&gt; It is only understandeable that one would push their service over
&gt; anothers....
&gt; When I went to several Dr.s for diagnsosis and treatment options all &quot;sold&quot;
&gt; me their plan in some form or another.  I also paid for the visit..........
&gt;     I was diagnosed with prostate cancer when I was 49.....
&gt;     The Urologist was very cold and hard to deal with and feel comfortable
&gt; with also.  He told me I was going to die......(we all do anyway....but this
&gt; was do to the prostate cancer)  He said the best option was External Beam
&gt; radiation......
&gt; I swallowed that and looked forward to 45 trips (one-way @ 75 miles.....that
&gt; is round trip....150miles) He gave me a Lupron Depot shot in his
&gt; office......not medical room, 1500.00 per shot......Take down your
&gt; pants....bang.
&gt; The shot apparently made the prostate smaller, as well as caused many
&gt; differing bodily ailments etc.....He never told me nada about what the shot
&gt; would do.........I learned on-line....Thats it.
&gt;     I went to his Dr. friend for the visit(oncologist) He told me the
&gt; benefits of radiation also.........and did try to sell his services.....
&gt; I learned later many of the aspects that radiation could do and would do,
&gt; on-line........
&gt;     I did get a very cold feeling about the direction I was headed for, and
&gt; felt very sick inside........What is going on???????

&gt; I decided to take my knowledge, (minimal and all learned on-line and from
&gt; this news group) to see other Dr. in the &quot;Big City&quot;
&gt;     I was so glad I did this..............I did meet yet another Urologist
&gt; and did pay for a visit fee and did get the DRE and, and.........I was not
&gt; too happy with his speech either.......hum......
&gt; Finally I headed for Stanford Medical Center.......
&gt; I met a wonderful Dr. that studies prostate cancer.......

&gt; I did have the in office visit, and the inspection of all lab work.
&gt; He was a Surgeon......Urologist....

&gt; He looked me over like he was sizing me up, also......my personality, body
&gt; size, etc.
&gt; I think this is a way for a Dr. to feel if he can help you......
&gt; I expalined what I had done, where I had gone and how I ended up here.....
&gt; He said, &quot;I can help you&quot;

&gt; Anyway, he looked at his book and said, I have an opening on thurs.......
&gt; Do you want that?
&gt; I said yes.....he shook my hand and I felt a warmth go over my body like
&gt; no-other........I mean that!
&gt; I had surgery, RP in 1999.
&gt; I just had my last PSA and it is undectible....2007

&gt; Anyway, sorry for the long story, and realize the hardship you have with
&gt; Dr.s and insurance, and decisions.
&gt; Prostate Cancer specialists are the best Dr.s to see.
&gt; They do require in house visits....
&gt; Either it be Radiation or Surgery.
&gt; We all have to decide, and hopefully do not have to go thru too much making
&gt; that choice.

&gt; &gt; I had a most unpleasant experience yesterday and would appreciate any
&gt; &gt; reactions and feedback:

&gt; &gt; Diagnosed in mid-August with Prostate Cancer:

&gt; &gt; Age-59-good health
&gt; &gt; T1c stage
&gt; &gt; Gleason score 6 (3+3)
&gt; &gt; PSA 3.17 as of August, 2007
&gt; &gt; PSA doubled in 22 months

&gt; &gt; I have gotten several opinions and have decided that if Insurance won't
&gt; &gt; pay for the Cyberknife I will go with either the lo-dose or high-dose
&gt; &gt; brachytherapy.

&gt; &gt; Upon the urging of a close friend who has a Urologist friend on the
&gt; &gt; staff at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J.  the former
&gt; &gt; told me to contact the Urologist who as a &quot;professional courtesy&quot; to
&gt; &gt; him , would review my numbers.  I emailed a letter to the Urologist
&gt; &gt; explaining that I appreciate his offer and would like a few minutes of
&gt; &gt; his time &quot;by phone&quot; to review my biopsy numbers and very simple CT and
&gt; &gt; Bone Scan reports which I attached to the email.

&gt; &gt; I then called the Urologist a week later and he claimed he never
&gt; &gt; received the data and that he wanted me to come to see him in his
&gt; &gt; office saying that he needed to see me in person for among other things
&gt; &gt; to &quot;see what 'body type you have&quot;.  I reiterated that I simply wanted
&gt; &gt; him to look at the &quot;numbers&quot; and to give me some feedback based upon
&gt; &gt; this information and nothing else.  I had a Radiation Oncologist do
&gt; &gt; this by phone a few weeks before.

&gt; &gt; The Urologist however insisted I come in and not wanting to appear to
&gt; &gt; be an ingrate , (remember I was led to believe this opinion was as a
&gt; &gt; favor to our mutual friend and on my behalf) I made an appointment and
&gt; &gt; saw him the other day.  He ran through some tests (none of which I
&gt; &gt; thought were necessary inasmuch as I recently had them taken).  Tests
&gt; &gt; were urine sample, DRE, took some ultrasound gel and put it on my lower
&gt; &gt; belly and used the ultrasound head to determine that I wasn't retaining
&gt; &gt; much urine.  That test took about 30-45 seconds.  He then gave me a
&gt; &gt; cursory check of my lymph nodes by palpation all the while racking up
&gt; &gt; CPT procedure codes as far as I can tell.

&gt; &gt; Then we went into his office and he proceeded to give me a very
&gt; &gt; aggressive and unseemly &quot;sales pitch&quot; for the DaVinci Robot at St.
&gt; &gt; Barnabas for radical prostatectomy.  This was not a &quot;medical opinion&quot;
&gt; &gt; in any lucid understanding of that term.  It was a naked and shameless
&gt; &gt; &quot;sales pitch&quot; to get me to leave my currently affiliated-with hospital
&gt; &gt; (Overlook in Summit, New Jersey) and get me to come to St. Barnabas to
&gt; &gt; undergo the most aggressive procedure, robot or not.  I told him at the
&gt; &gt; outset that I had no interest in the rad. pros. inasmuch as I am
&gt; &gt; interested in the less invasive procedures such as CyberKnife or a type
&gt; &gt; of Brachytherapy and I am a perfect candidate for those.

&gt; &gt; The Urologist then insisted on conference calling his friend -a
&gt; &gt; Radiation Oncologist all the while telling him I told him not to bother
&gt; &gt; with the call but he went ahead and got the Radiation Oncologist on the
&gt; &gt; phone who then proceeded to badmouth the CyberKnife and by implication
&gt; &gt; my hospital.  This was nakedly unethical and simply very sleazy.

&gt; &gt; Bottom line:  I spent about an hour with this jerk and was presented
&gt; &gt; with a bill for $530.00.  What could I do but sign the credit card
&gt; &gt; form?  My sick mother and father were waiting for me in the waiting
&gt; &gt; room and it was no situation in which to cause a ruckus. He does not
&gt; &gt; accept insurance but his office will transmit the billing information
&gt; &gt; to my insurance carrier and they will pay whatever they decide to pay,
&gt; &gt; which is probably next to nothing.  I believe he reeled me in like a
&gt; &gt; fish with no intention but to try to pull me over to his hospital and
&gt; &gt; to rack up an unconscionable fee.

&gt; &gt; I intend to dispute the charge with my Visa card company for starters.
&gt; &gt; I would appreciate any feedback on this and how I might address this
&gt; &gt; ripoff.

You certainly are justified in complaining about the guy who tried to
sell you on a DaVinci robotic procedure.

But I wonder if you are going too far in deciding for yourself.   Not
only have you decided on radiation in preference to surgery, but you've
even decided which radiation method to use.   What you need to do is to
go back to the urologist who was willing to openly discuss all possible
methods of treatment and make sure you understand the relative risks of
each of them with respect to the likelihood of curing the disease in the
long term and of side effects.  From what you say, it is likely that
radiation is a possible choice for you, but you don't want to exclude
any treatment out of hand.

I was diagnosed with a Gleason 7 cancer at age 67, and my urologist told
me I could choose either surgery or radiation.   I chose surgery, but
had I been five years older, I would have chosen radiation.   As best I
could tell the marginal advantage, for a man my age,  of radiation over
surgery with respect to side effects such as impotence was not worth the
greater uncertainty about a long term cure.   After another five years,
the calculus would have been different.   I'm not an expert, but my
guess is that if you have access to a highly qualified surgeon, the odds
of side effects for surgery and radiation for a man your age are pretty
similar.   On the other hand, if you have access only to &quot;average&quot;
practitioners, you may be better off choosing radiation.  I would be
surprised if the cyberknife procedure has any established advantage over
IMRT.

The doctor may be sleazy, but you are the one shortchanging  yourself
by pursuing one ill-advised course of action after another.  This
isn't about $500, it's about your life.

You have access to the best doctors and hospitals in the world, but
you choose a small, no-name community hospital because &quot;it is 15
minutes from where you live.&quot;  And apparently because there is a &quot;yes-
man&quot; of a doctor there who will do anything you want.

During the course of my husband's illness, I came across a number of
guys from Central Jersey who came to Manhattan for treatment. My
husband's &quot;rad pal&quot; at Sloan K. was from Morristown, and a guy I met
at the surgeon's office at NY Hosp was from Jersey &quot;horse country.&quot;
And I know for a fact that Sloan has &quot;branches&quot; in NJ.  Finally, if
you want to stay within the state, there is an excellent teaching
hospital in Hackensack. I often see it recommmended in the &quot;Top
Doctors for Cancer&quot; book from Castle Connolly.

You may be a candidate for treatments other than surgery.  For
example, my husband's radiation oncologist, Michael Zelefsky, who is
head of Brachytherapy at Sloan K, recently wrote that he has been
getting very good long-term results by treating even medium-and high-
risk PC patients with IMRT alone.

You should be consulting doctors of this caliber.  Who knows, you may
be pleasantly surprised about the treatment recommendations.

You should also read on my blog, &quot;Straight Talk for the Newly
Diagnosed.&quot; It consists of step-by-step instructions from Johns
Hopkins for finding the best doctors and treatments for PC. Hopkins is
the top-rated hospital in the country, with the top-ranked Urology
faculty (although your focus should be cancer). And what they advise
patients to do is right, even if it is painstaking.  Fortunately for
you, treatment is not an emergency.

I also have on my blog, &quot;How to Find a Good Doctor&quot;, which offers
excellent tips not only on finding top doctors but also top hospitals.

There are some wise people here, but I haven't heard anybody endorse
the decisions you've made. I must tell you that dying of prostate
cancer is a very unpleasant business.

My husband says I am wasting my breath, but I think your life is worth
saving.

Best of luck.

Thanks for your supportive comments.

Let me underscore that even if my friend the intermediary, the doctor
and myself ALL misunderstood  the nature of this consultation, I am not
trying to get away with a freebie and am in fact quite willing to pay
him a mutually agreed upon fee, but will not let him call all the shots
in this matter.

The whole doctor-patient relationship is completely assymetrical and
nowadays I think we better face the fact that it's as much a business
relationship as anything else and as such, we &quot;customers&quot; deserve no
less &quot;informed consent&quot; than we'd get from our auto mechanic.

&gt; Based on your report of your experience, I'm inclined to agree
&gt; with you that you were badly treated.  However, as others have
&gt; pointed out, it may not be easy to refuse payment.

&gt; To begin with, the person was who told you that you would be seen
&gt; as a &quot;professional courtesy&quot; may well have been talking out of
&gt; his hat.  Do you have any reason to believe that he had
&gt; permission from the urologist to say such a thing?  You should
&gt; ask him.  If he didn't, then the urologist is an innocent party
&gt; as far as the &quot;courtesy&quot; consultation is concerned.  He never
&gt; offered you free advice and it is a perfectly reasonable
&gt; expectation that he should demand that you come into his office
&gt; and that he charge you.  He is, after all, running a business.
&gt; He might give free advice to friends and family, but it's a
&gt; little unreasonable to think he would he do such a thing for a
&gt; perfect stranger who happened to be a friend of a friend.

&gt; Doctors hate doing that, and for good reason.  Give a guy a free
&gt; consultation and he starts calling you back every time he has a
&gt; headache.  Maybe you wouldn't do that, but a lot of patients
&gt; would.  Then the guy starts telling his friends that they can
&gt; call Dr. Jones and get free advice.  It's a slippery slope.

&gt; Nevertheless, there were still two kinds of bad treatment in my
&gt; view:

&gt;  1. Insisting on expensive tests that you didn't need.

&gt;     Since you emailed the test results to the doctor, and since
&gt;     you have evidence that he received the email, his denying
&gt;     that he saw the data sure looks to me like he was just trying
&gt;     to rip you off.

&gt;     If I were the doctor and I didn't recall the email, I'd
&gt;     at least make a quick search through my emails, or ask my
&gt;     office manager to do it rather than repeating tests that were
&gt;     already done.

&gt;  2. Aggressively pushing his services instead of giving you
&gt;     objective advice.

&gt;     If I were a doctor and you came to me for advice, I'd tell
&gt;     you what I thought were the potential advantages of surgery
&gt;     vs.  radiation, and of laparoscopic vs. open surgery.  I'd
&gt;     say what my specialty was and how I could help you if you
&gt;     decided you wanted what I do.  If I thought that surgery was
&gt;     a better option for you than radiation, I'd say so.  If I
&gt;     thought that brachytherapy was better than CyberKnife, I'd
&gt;     say that and explain why.

&gt;     But I wouldn't try to &quot;sell&quot; anything to you.  I wouldn't try
&gt;     to minimize the risks of what I could offer.  I wouldn't have
&gt;     done that strange thing with the phone call to the rad onc,
&gt;     and I wouldn't have tried to pad my bill.

&gt; So you were treated to an unpleasant, useless, and expensive
&gt; service but, in spite of your protestations, at no point did you
&gt; say &quot;No, I won't come in&quot; or &quot;No, I won't take that test&quot;.

&gt; Does that mean you shouldn't try to refuse payment?  Well, why
&gt; not try?  It might not work, but you don't exactly owe the sleaze
&gt; ball any better treatment than he gave you.

&gt; Good luck, and let us know how it comes out.

I have spent a lot of time researching the options and based upon my

I don't find the  risk/reward ratio compelling enough for me to go that
route.  I have given some consideration to &quot;active surveillance&quot; (the
term &quot;watchful waiting&quot; is really misleading)  also inasmuch as there
is new data on younger patients like myself (59) and with numbers (T1c,
PSA 3.17, Gleason 6 (3+3) ) that seems compelling.  I believe that I
could live with the &quot;uncertainty&quot; and would be scrupulous about getting
my PSA checked every few months and getting a yearly biopsy if
warranted.

I have not totally ruled it out especially now that I am leaning
towards either high-dose or low dose Brachytherapy (my Insurance will
not pay for the Cyberknife).  I have been told that 2 months prior to
Brachytherapy I would be given a drug called &quot;Eligard&quot; or &quot;Lupron&quot; both
of which reduce adrogen production which allegedly &quot;feeds&quot; the cancer.
Some of the side effects can be:

Hot flashes
weakness
weight gain
muscle loss
and possibly causing me to go shopping at Nordstrom (just kidding!)

This doesn't sound too appealing to me.  I am also of the understanding
that I'd have to be on it for about 1 year -post Brachytherapy.

Regarding the efficacy of the Cyberknife it established it's
effectiveness originally with inoperable brain lesions in the mid 90's
and has been incrementally cleared by FDA for use in all body systems
at this point in time.  It is true that the longitudinal data is not as
far out in time as with other treatments but there is no rational
reason to believe it would not be very effective at killing cancer
cells and and sparing healthy tissue especially because it can correct
for patient/organ movement on the table during treatment.  I would take
whatever &quot;chance&quot; there might be in a heartbeat as I am convinced that
it (or similar stereotactic radiosurgery) is &quot;generally&quot; as effective
and less toxic than other interventions.

&gt; You certainly are justified in complaining about the guy who tried to
&gt; sell you on a DaVinci robotic procedure.

&gt; But I wonder if you are going too far in deciding for yourself.   Not
&gt; only have you decided on radiation in preference to surgery, but you've
&gt; even decided which radiation method to use.   What you need to do is to
&gt; go back to the urologist who was willing to openly discuss all possible
&gt; methods of treatment and make sure you understand the relative risks of
&gt; each of them with respect to the likelihood of curing the disease in the
&gt; long term and of side effects.  From what you say, it is likely that
&gt; radiation is a possible choice for you, but you don't want to exclude
&gt; any treatment out of hand.

&gt; I was diagnosed with a Gleason 7 cancer at age 67, and my urologist told
&gt; me I could choose either surgery or radiation.   I chose surgery, but
&gt; had I been five years older, I would have chosen radiation.   As best I
&gt; could tell the marginal advantage, for a man my age,  of radiation over
&gt; surgery with respect to side effects such as impotence was not worth the
&gt; greater uncertainty about a long term cure.   After another five years,
&gt; the calculus would have been different.   I'm not an expert, but my
&gt; guess is that if you have access to a highly qualified surgeon, the odds
&gt; of side effects for surgery and radiation for a man your age are pretty
&gt; similar.   On the other hand, if you have access only to &quot;average&quot;
&gt; practitioners, you may be better off choosing radiation.  I would be
&gt; surprised if the cyberknife procedure has any established advantage over
&gt; IMRT.

&gt; &gt; Diagnosed in mid-August with Prostate Cancer:

&gt; &gt; Age-59-good health
&gt; &gt; T1c stage
&gt; &gt; Gleason score 6 (3+3)
&gt; &gt; PSA 3.17 as of August, 2007
&gt; &gt; PSA doubled in 22 months

&gt; &gt; I have gotten several opinions and have decided that if Insurance won't
&gt; &gt; pay for the Cyberknife I will go with either the lo-dose or high-dose
&gt; &gt; brachytherapy.

&gt; &gt; Upon the urging of a close friend who has a Urologist friend on the
&gt; &gt; staff at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J.  the former
&gt; &gt; told me to contact the Urologist who as a &quot;professional courtesy&quot; to
&gt; &gt; him , would review my numbers.  I emailed a letter to the Urologist
&gt; &gt; explaining that I appreciate his offer and would like a few minutes of
&gt; &gt; his time &quot;by phone&quot; to review my biopsy numbers and very simple CT and
&gt; &gt; Bone Scan reports which I attached to the email.

&gt; &gt; I then called the Urologist a week later and he claimed he never
&gt; &gt; received the data and that he wanted me to come to see him in his
&gt; &gt; office saying that he needed to see me in person for among other things
&gt; &gt; to &quot;see what 'body type you have&quot;.  I reiterated that I simply wanted
&gt; &gt; him to look at the &quot;numbers&quot; and to give me some feedback based upon
&gt; &gt; this information and nothing else.  I had a Radiation Oncologist do
&gt; &gt; this by phone a few weeks before.

&gt; &gt; The Urologist however insisted I come in and not wanting to appear to
&gt; &gt; be an ingrate , (remember I was led to believe this opinion was as a
&gt; &gt; favor to our mutual friend and on my behalf) I made an appointment and
&gt; &gt; saw him the other day.  He ran through some tests (none of which I
&gt; &gt; thought were necessary inasmuch as I recently had them taken).  Tests
&gt; &gt; were urine sample, DRE, took some ultrasound gel and put it on my lower
&gt; &gt; belly and used the ultrasound head to determine that I wasn't retaining
&gt; &gt; much urine.  That test took about 30-45 seconds.  He then gave me a
&gt; &gt; cursory check of my lymph nodes by palpation all the while racking up
&gt; &gt; CPT procedure codes as far as I can tell.

&gt; &gt; Then we went into his office and he proceeded to give me a very
&gt; &gt; aggressive and unseemly &quot;sales pitch&quot; for the DaVinci Robot at St.
&gt; &gt; Barnabas for radical prostatectomy.  This was not a &quot;medical opinion&quot;
&gt; &gt; in any lucid understanding of that term.  It was a naked and shameless
&gt; &gt; &quot;sales pitch&quot; to get me to leave my currently affiliated-with hospital
&gt; &gt; (Overlook in Summit, New Jersey) and get me to come to St. Barnabas to
&gt; &gt; undergo the most aggressive procedure, robot or not.  I told him at the
&gt; &gt; outset that I had no interest in the rad. pros. inasmuch as I am
&gt; &gt; interested in the less invasive procedures such as CyberKnife or a type
&gt; &gt; of Brachytherapy and I am a perfect candidate for those.

&gt; &gt; The Urologist then insisted on conference calling his friend -a
&gt; &gt; Radiation Oncologist all the while telling him I told him not to bother
&gt; &gt; with the call but he went ahead and got the Radiation Oncologist on the
&gt; &gt; phone who then proceeded to badmouth the CyberKnife and by implication
&gt; &gt; my hospital.  This was nakedly unethical and simply very sleazy.

&gt; &gt; Bottom line:  I spent about an hour with this jerk and was presented
&gt; &gt; with a bill for $530.00.  What could I do but sign the credit card
&gt; &gt; form?  My sick mother and father were waiting for me in the waiting
&gt; &gt; room and it was no situation in which to cause a ruckus. He does not
&gt; &gt; accept insurance but his office will transmit the billing information
&gt; &gt; to my insurance carrier and they will pay whatever they decide to pay,
&gt; &gt; which is probably next to nothing.  I believe he reeled me in like a
&gt; &gt; fish with no intention but to try to pull me over to his hospital and
&gt; &gt; to rack up an unconscionable fee.

&gt; &gt;  I intend to dispute the charge with my Visa card company for starters.
&gt; &gt; I would appreciate any feedback on this and how I might address this
&gt; &gt; ripoff.

From my amateur perspective, your modest PSA and gl6 are good pointers
for WW (or AS if you prefer) but your tender youth puts you more at
risk; if you've a long life ahead of you then the wisdom of WW is
shrouded in increasing uncertainty with the passing of time - I'm sure
you already know this. As you rightly say, the impact of 'living with
the uncertainty' is the propellant for action.  If your regular PSA
checks show little or no change you could perhaps become quite relaxed
about it all.  I found my own results - at any point in time
suggesting a 2 year doubling - became increasingly difficult to live
with.
But in the short term, WW could be profitably used to become more
certain in your own mind of the choice you're about to make.

Good Luck.

Is Cyber Sexy?

About six months ago I heard a commercial on the radio about a state-
of-the-art treatment for prostate cancer called &quot;Cyberknife.&quot;  It was
being offered at a hospital in Long Island (a suburb of NY) that I had
never heard of.

Well, I sat up straight, and to quote Anatole Broyard, &quot;my mind became
immediately erect.&quot;  But my gut reaction was negative: concern, even
fear.  I thought, not knowing anything at all about the &quot;Cyberknife,&quot;
that folks in the PC community were going to fall for it in a big way
regardless of its merits.  That's because anything healthcare-related
that has the word &quot;cyber&quot; in it is &quot;sexy&quot; these days. Same for
&quot;robot&quot;.  If you're a clever marketer, you're going to find a way to
slip those words into your promotional materials.

Then it occurred to me that, if this Cyberknife is so good, why is it
not being introduced by a topnotch hospital?  There are loads of them
here in New York. And they can afford the technology. So I did a brief
search online and came up with very little info about Cyberknife, none
of which suggested that it was superior to current PC treatments.
Seemed that it was indicated for brain tumors.

I'm not against technology, just the way it's hyped. &quot;Cyber&quot; doesn't
necessarily mean better.  Same goes for &quot;robot&quot;.

Dr. Mani Menon, robotic surgeon par excellence, once wrote the
following:

&quot;There is a fundamental question to be asked of a technologically
advanced society, which is:

&quot;Once a machine has been designed to perform a task, should man be
removed from the equation?&quot;

&quot;The painful and unequivocal answer to this question whether it be in
folk song of John Henry and the steam engine or the economical
practicalities of the automobile industries, is a mournful but
unwavering, &quot;Yes.&quot;

Recently a friend sent me an article about a robot which makes rounds
for a particular doctor when he is unable to be at the hospital in
person.  So the next time you go for a check-up, you may hear the
words:

&quot;Have a seat.  The robot will see you now.&quot;

I wonder: When we feel those cold hands roaming over our bodies, will
we long for John Henry?

arrangement with your physician is a business; just ask his billing
department in some skyscraper 2,000 miles away, who bills you based
solely on those codes he punched into his computer.

So you expected a &quot;courtesy&quot; visit? Well, was he not courteous? Why on
earth would you expect a guy who spent a fortune and a decade on med
school to spend his time, facility, manpower, instruments, expertise,
and cold hard cash (for the urinalysis) on you, then just wave, say
&quot;Thank you for your time&quot;, and wave in the next freeloader?

And did you actually think any business is going to open an e-mail
attachment these days? I haven't opened an attachment from my niece's
old baby sitter in years, and her name is now Melinda Gates. No way in
*hell* am I going to open an attachment from my Mom, and I don't even
have a business on my computer.

Sorry to sound so harsh, but a little head-slap might alert you to watch
out for yourself as you navigate the perils and pitfalls of any medical
system, especially with a problem as ill-defined as prostate cancer.

Here's one rational reason to consider: the surgeon, whether she's up to
her elbows in your crotch or siting at a console down the hall, must
1. Determine which cells surrounding the prostate are cancerous and
which are not,
2. Remove the former, and
3. Leave the latter.
Now realize that the two lie just tens of thousandths of an inch apart
throughout your inner crotch, and tactile feel is still one of the best
ways to distinguish cancerous meat from healthy meat.

You asked one of us a couple of days ago about his experience following
an RP. Mine was this (RRP three years ago @ 61): I'm healthier and more
fit than I have been in over a decade, am still a very active full-time
&quot;extreme-sport&quot; athlete, may die from a meteor strike 25 years from now,
and still have the option of some form of radiation treatment if my PC
returns. The rest is just minute details, IMO.

Hello, Sy:

I've been reading this all with interest ... sounds like you got quite an
education about the interaction between you and your docs.  Also seems like
the uro bought himself a lot of ill will.  He's got your $530, but you've
got his name and a story to tell all your male buddies when it's their turn
to decide what uro to use.

You seem to imply that surgery SEs are worse than those from radiation.
You'll get all kinds of stories here.  I had an LRP and I'm fine:
temporary incontinence and impotence.  I'm just one story, of course.  But
if you're assuming that radiation treatments are free from potential SEs
then you need to research some more.

What makes some of us nervous about the Cyberknife is that the information
that turns up is long on marketing and short on hard facts.  Yes, the
Cyberknife has been approved for use throughout the body, and many docs
want to begin using it on PCa.  There's bound to be a learning period, and
the men who get it now are possibly the subjects in that learning.  If
that's what you want to do, then my hat is off to you, as you are much more
courageous than I.  But please have your eye open about this.

HI Leah,

I appreciate your questions as well as your literary bent.

The Hospital you are referring to is Winthrop University hospital in
N.Y.

The name &quot;Cyber-Knife&quot; is clever but accurate inasmuch as it is a
computer guided linear accelerator which certainly warrants the &quot;high
tech&quot; name .  You can say the same thing of the &quot;Gamma-Knife&quot; or
&quot;DaVinci ROBOT&quot;.  I have my own medical products company and am quite
familiar with the industry and the marketing, some of it quite sleazy

Spend a few hours listening to WABC or WOR (NYC area) and you will hear

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Good question and here is the answer.  The CyberKnife was developed at
Stanford about 15 years ago.
They will be getting their second one soon.  Their are dozens of
CyberKinife facilities in the U.S.A. at places like Georgetown
University, Baylor Univ, U. of Texas. Med. Ctr., etc., etc..

It was originally &quot;approved&quot; by FDA for inoperable brain lesions and
having been successful in those applications the FDA cleared it
incrementally for other body systems.  It has been used for several
years for Prostate treatment.  It is also approved&quot; by Medicare.  If a
treatment is given the &quot;green light&quot; by the Federal Medicare Program
the private insurance industry follows thereafter in most cases.  Many
private insurance carriers will pay for it but some don't because the
treatment is very expensive.

The longitudinal data is less out in time for the CyberKnife as it is a
newer technology but it is certainly not &quot;experimental&quot; in any rational
sense of the meaning of that word and that not withstanding I'm
convinced enough about it's technology that I would do it in a
heartbeat for my particular Dx.. My problem is that my carrier, Oxford
Health Plans has been refusing coverage the last few months.

The data to date is at least as compelling as for other types of
sterotaxic radiosurgery but the CyberKnife has the advantage of being
able to compensate for patient/organ movement while on the treatment
table in order to not inadvertantly hit healthy tissues.  Another
benefit is that because it delivers very high-dose highly targeted
radiation the treatment is completely &quot;bloodless&quot; and consists of 5- 1
hour or so sessions.

Also, there has never been any shortage of chauvanism concerning NYC
and the hallucination that they have the &quot;best&quot; of everything.  I don't
exactly live in Borneo and am in Central, New Jersey where many of the
M.D.'s have been trained in NYC or even better schools (Duke, Stanford
, Harvard etc) but it's really a distinction without a difference.   I
would not go running into NYC or anywhere else for that matter because
I have the most garden variety type of Prostate Cancer (PSA 3.17,
Gleason 6 (3+3) stage T1c) and as someone said recently on this board
my type of case for the average Urologist is as common as &quot;cutting
fingernails&quot;.

If you do a Google you will find lots of objective data (as &quot;objective&quot;
as one can get in this field altogether) about the CyberKnife.

I asked the doctor why didn't say &quot;Sloan-Kettering in NYC have one&quot;.
The reason is that they have already invested their millions in &quot;high
tech&quot; devices.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Is Cyber Sexy?

&gt; About six months ago I heard a commercial on the radio about a state-
&gt; of-the-art treatment for prostate cancer called &quot;Cyberknife.&quot;  It was
&gt; being offered at a hospital in Long Island (a suburb of NY) that I had
&gt; never heard of.

&gt; Well, I sat up straight, and to quote Anatole Broyard, &quot;my mind became
&gt; immediately erect.&quot;  But my gut reaction was negative: concern, even
&gt; fear.  I thought, not knowing anything at all about the &quot;Cyberknife,&quot;
&gt; that folks in the PC community were going to fall for it in a big way
&gt; regardless of its merits.  That's because anything healthcare-related
&gt; that has the word &quot;cyber&quot; in it is &quot;sexy&quot; these days. Same for
&gt; &quot;robot&quot;.  If you're a clever marketer, you're going to find a way to
&gt; slip those words into your promotional materials.

&gt; Then it occurred to me that, if this Cyberknife is so good, why is it
&gt; not being introduced by a topnotch hospital?  There are loads of them
&gt; here in New York. And they can afford the technology. So I did a brief
&gt; search online and came up with very little info about Cyberknife, none
&gt; of which suggested that it was superior to current PC treatments.
&gt; Seemed that it was indicated for brain tumors.

&gt; I'm not against technology, just the way it's hyped. &quot;Cyber&quot; doesn't
&gt; necessarily mean better.  Same goes for &quot;robot&quot;.

&gt; Dr. Mani Menon, robotic surgeon par excellence, once wrote the
&gt; following:

&gt; &quot;There is a fundamental question to be asked of a technologically
&gt; advanced society, which is:

&gt; &quot;Once a machine has been designed to perform a task, should man be
&gt; removed from the equation?&quot;

&gt; &quot;The painful and unequivocal answer to this question whether it be in
&gt; folk song of John Henry and the steam engine or the economical
&gt; practicalities of the automobile industries, is a mournful but
&gt; unwavering, &quot;Yes.&quot;

&gt; Recently a friend sent me an article about a robot which makes rounds
&gt; for a particular doctor when he is unable to be at the hospital in
&gt; person.  So the next time you go for a check-up, you may hear the
&gt; words:

&gt;  &quot;Have a seat.  The robot will see you now.&quot;

&gt; I wonder: When we feel those cold hands roaming over our bodies, will
&gt; we long for John Henry?

I
Hi &quot;rosbif&quot;,

Love that name.  Inferring &quot;roast beef&quot; I'd guess?  If so it's quite a
fitting name for someone in this group if you catch my drift :)

I would have my PSA checked every 2 to 3 months.  My cancer is
localized and &quot;slow moving&quot; if it moves at all.  From what I've read
frequent PSA tests would probaly catch any upward trend.

Moreover it would alow me to &quot;buy time&quot; regarding future approval for
CyberKnife treatment or anything else that would be available in the
next few years.  To reiterate my numbers &quot;almost&quot; perfectly fit &quot;active
surveillance&quot; almost perfectly.  Statistically suppose I opted for 40
15 minute EBRT radiation treatments.  I would be willing to bet that
the possibility of getting into a car accident driving to the hospital
for all those treatments might very well offset the &quot;almost&quot; in the
previous statement.

I have no statistical proof of that of course but given the statistical
nature of this whole &quot;prostate treatment/risk/reward ratio&quot; decision
making I don't think I'm too off the mark.

&gt; From my amateur perspective, your modest PSA and gl6 are good pointers
&gt; for WW (or AS if you prefer) but your tender youth puts you more at
&gt; risk; if you've a long life ahead of you then the wisdom of WW is
&gt; shrouded in increasing uncertainty with the passing of time - I'm sure
&gt; you already know this. As you rightly say, the impact of 'living with
&gt; the uncertainty' is the propellant for action.  If your regular PSA
&gt; checks show little or no change you could perhaps become quite relaxed
&gt; about it all.  I found my own results - at any point in time
&gt; suggesting a 2 year doubling - became increasingly difficult to live
&gt; with.
&gt; But in the short term, WW could be profitably used to become more
&gt; certain in your own mind of the choice you're about to make.

Hi Leah,

expertise may be more in the Literary field than in Medicine or
Marketing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes they do and there's a branch in Basking Ridge 10 minutes from me
which is even closer than Overlook Hospital.  I never even considered
going there.  You may not be aware of the fact that the name
&quot;Sloan-Kettering&quot; is a &quot;brand&quot; these days, just as is Kellogg's or
Nabisco.

Savvy hospitals have been selling their &quot;brand names&quot; the last few
years (their are &quot;Mayo&quot; clinics in South Florida, &quot;Johns Hopkins&quot;
clinics outside of Baltimore)  &quot;Joselyn Diabetes Clinics' which are
essentially franchisees in a sense.  Of course the name granting
institution will do their best to insure that the doctors operating
under their brand are &quot;ethical and competent&quot; but they are still mainly
comprised of local doctors which is ok, but let's not get too hung up
with a &quot;brand name&quot; to begin with. A &quot;name&quot; is not what it used to be.

Finally, if

There was an article in New York Magazine (or was it the &quot;New Yorker&quot;)
published about a year ago exposing these &quot;rating outfits&quot; like Castle
Connely&quot; and how much bunk is involved in their assessments.  The
ratings or ranking game has itself become a big business and companies
like J.D. Power &amp; Co. have made millions on assessing non-sensical
criteria like &quot;Voted best Urinary Tract Infection detector&quot; by J.D.
Power &amp; Company to a gullible public.  U.S. News &amp; World Report is less
about &quot;U.S News and World Reporting&quot; than it is about &quot;Voted best

Once reputable institutions and publications have &quot;sold out &quot; in many

&gt; The doctor may be sleazy, but you are the one shortchanging  yourself
&gt; by pursuing one ill-advised course of action after another.  This
&gt; isn't about $500, it's about your life.

&gt; You have access to the best doctors and hospitals in the world, but
&gt; you choose a small, no-name community hospital because &quot;it is 15
&gt; minutes from where you live.&quot;  And apparently because there is a &quot;yes-
&gt; man&quot; of a doctor there who will do anything you want.

&gt; During the course of my husband's illness, I came across a number of
&gt; guys from Central Jersey who came to Manhattan for treatment. My
&gt; husband's &quot;rad pal&quot; at Sloan K. was from Morristown, and a guy I met
&gt; at the surgeon's office at NY Hosp was from Jersey &quot;horse country.&quot;
&gt; And I know for a fact that Sloan has &quot;branches&quot; in NJ.  Finally, if
&gt; you want to stay within the state, there is an excellent teaching
&gt; hospital in Hackensack. I often see it recommmended in the &quot;Top
&gt; Doctors for Cancer&quot; book from Castle Connolly.

&gt; You may be a candidate for treatments other than surgery.  For
&gt; example, my husband's radiation oncologist, Michael Zelefsky, who is
&gt; head of Brachytherapy at Sloan K, recently wrote that he has been
&gt; getting very good long-term results by treating even medium-and high-
&gt; risk PC patients with IMRT alone.

&gt; You should be consulting doctors of this caliber.  Who knows, you may
&gt; be pleasantly surprised about the treatment recommendations.

&gt; You should also read on my blog, &quot;Straight Talk for the Newly
&gt; Diagnosed.&quot; It consists of step-by-step instructions from Johns
&gt; Hopkins for finding the best doctors and treatments for PC. Hopkins is
&gt; the top-rated hospital in the country, with the top-ranked Urology
&gt; faculty (although your focus should be cancer). And what they advise
&gt; patients to do is right, even if it is painstaking.  Fortunately for
&gt; you, treatment is not an emergency.

&gt; I also have on my blog, &quot;How to Find a Good Doctor&quot;, which offers
&gt; excellent tips not only on finding top doctors but also top hospitals.

&gt; There are some wise people here, but I haven't heard anybody endorse
&gt; the decisions you've made. I must tell you that dying of prostate
&gt; cancer is a very unpleasant business.

&gt; My husband says I am wasting my breath, but I think your life is worth
&gt; saving.

&gt; Best of luck.

&gt; I had a most unpleasant experience yesterday and would appreciate any
&gt; reactions and feedback:

&gt; Diagnosed in mid-August with Prostate Cancer:

&gt; Age-59-good health
&gt; T1c stage
&gt; Gleason score 6 (3+3)
&gt; PSA 3.17 as of August, 2007
&gt; PSA doubled in 22 months

&gt; I have gotten several opinions and have decided that if Insurance won't
&gt; pay for the Cyberknife I will go with either the lo-dose or high-dose
&gt; brachytherapy.

&gt; Upon the urging of a close friend who has a Urologist friend on the
&gt; staff at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J.  the former
&gt; told me to contact the Urologist who as a &quot;professional courtesy&quot; to
&gt; him , would review my numbers.  I emailed a letter to the Urologist
&gt; explaining that I appreciate his offer and would like a few minutes of
&gt; his time &quot;by phone&quot; to review my biopsy numbers and very simple CT and
&gt; Bone Scan reports which I attached to the email.

&gt; I then called the Urologist a week later and he claimed he never
&gt; received the data and that he wanted me to come to see him in his
&gt; office saying that he needed to see me in person for among other things
&gt; to &quot;see what 'body type you have&quot;.  I reiterated that I simply wanted
&gt; him to look at the &quot;numbers&quot; and to give me some feedback based upon
&gt; this information and nothing else.  I had a Radiation Oncologist do
&gt; this by phone a few weeks before.

&gt; The Urologist however insisted I come in and not wanting to appear to
&gt; be an ingrate , (remember I was led to believe this opinion was as a
&gt; favor to our mutual friend and on my behalf) I made an appointment and
&gt; saw him the other day.  He ran through some tests (none of which I
&gt; thought were necessary inasmuch as I recently had them taken).  Tests
&gt; were urine sample, DRE, took some ultrasound gel and put it on my lower
&gt; belly and used the ultrasound head to determine that I wasn't retaining
&gt; much urine.  That test took about 30-45 seconds.  He then gave me a
&gt; cursory check of my lymph nodes by palpation all the while racking up
&gt; CPT procedure codes as far as I can tell.

&gt; Then we went into his office and he proceeded to give me a very
&gt; aggressive and unseemly &quot;sales pitch&quot; for the DaVinci Robot at St.
&gt; Barnabas for radical prostatectomy.  This was not a &quot;medical opinion&quot;
&gt; in any lucid understanding of that term.  It was a naked and shameless
&gt; &quot;sales pitch&quot; to get me to leave my currently affiliated-with hospital
&gt; (Overlook in Summit, New Jersey) and get me to come to St. Barnabas to
&gt; undergo the most aggressive procedure, robot or not.  I told him at the
&gt; outset that I had no interest in the rad. pros. inasmuch as I am
&gt; interested in the less invasive procedures such as CyberKnife or a type
&gt; of Brachytherapy and I am a perfect candidate for those.

&gt; The Urologist then insisted on conference calling his friend -a
&gt; Radiation Oncologist all the while telling him I told him not to bother
&gt; with the call but he went ahead and got the Radiation Oncologist on the
&gt; phone who then proceeded to badmouth the CyberKnife and by implication
&gt; my hospital.  This was nakedly unethical and simply very sleazy.

&gt; Bottom line:  I spent about an hour with this jerk and was presented
&gt; with a bill for $530.00.  What could I do but sign the credit card
&gt; form?  My sick mother and father were waiting for me in the waiting
&gt; room and it was no situation in which to cause a ruckus. He does not
&gt; accept insurance but his office will transmit the billing information
&gt; to my insurance carrier and they will pay whatever they decide to pay,
&gt; which is probably next to nothing.  I believe he reeled me in like a
&gt; fish with no intention but to try to pull me over to his hospital and
&gt; to rack up an unconscionable fee.

&gt; I intend to dispute the charge with my Visa card company for starters.
&gt; I would appreciate any feedback on this and how I might address this
&gt; ripoff.

&gt; Thanks,

I suspect you signed away many of your rights when you signed that receipt.
Most of the laws 'protecting' purchasers has to do with merchandize.  A
phone solicitor fast-talks you into a sale; a shirt is the wrong size; half
the pieces didn't come with the wagon; etc.  You may be able to irritate him
a little bit by challenging him through your credit card company, but I
doubt you'll win under these circumstances.

Hiring a lawyer and suing is one possibility.  It would be prolonged with an
uncertain outcome.

Your best outcome might be to report him to the AMA and other city or state
oversight agencies that may exist where you live.  You won't get your money
back, but you will have possibly saved another.  &quot;Sleazy&quot; is a good
description for him.
