Ranma stood near the holotable, watching the battle.  Icons
representing the highly modified Abrams, Challengers, Leopards, T-80s,
and Type 90s of the ground forces led the vanguard of mechanized
infantry towards their Imperial counterparts.  The concept of
replacing the standard fossil fuel powerplant with a fusion power cell
and drive system resulted in armor with more capabilities than their
older counterparts.  Fuel tanks were replaced with life-support
equipment, allowing the armored vehicles to work on a variety of
atmospheres.  There was still a sufficient excess of power to adapt
shipboard turbolasers for the main cannon.  The original manufacturers
were busy designing in repulsorlift and shield generators into the
later variants.

Icons indication surviving Imperial turbolasers would appear as they
revealed themselves by opened fire, only to be immediately draw
counterbattery fire from either the supporting warships or the
modified self-propelled artillery they brought with them.  "The
Imperial army still seems to think that swarm tactics work," he noted,
as Y-wing icons swarmed over several battalion-sized formations.  "I
wonder how long it'll take them to realize that it doesn't.
Especially with a dearth of air cover."  Between their nose-mounted
laser cannons and conventional bombs released from external bomb
racks, Imperial Army formations ceased to exist.  Even the universally
feared AT-ATs, with their heavy armor and firepower, were no match for
the combination of aerial dominance over the battlefield, orbital fire
support, and warship-grade weaponry mounted on ground vehicles.  Only
stormtrooper battalions had marginally better survival rates against
the air attacks.

"General, we're getting reports of partisan attacks against Imperial
forces; the Imperial prisoners have reported supply columns bombed,
outlying garrisons attacked, and the sniping of senior ranks."

"Captain T'Mir?"

The Vulcan captain looked at the Jedi.  "I would surmise that members
of the High Command and Defense Forces were able to escape the initial
onslaught, and escaped to outlying areas, to begin a guerilla campaign
against the invader."

"There by making the occupation of the planet difficult, if not
impossible, for the invaders.  I've done it myself during the Clone
Wars, against the Separatist Forces, and again in the early days of
the Empire, on those planets that wanted to remain free.  I think we'd
better stave off any potential mistakes, before they happen."  Ranma
turned to the communications officer.  "Mr. Merrik, signal the
Serenity Dominant, and...diplomatically request young Queen Serenity's
presence on the Wild Stallion."

"Yes sir."

The Jedi Master turned back to the Vulcan captain.  "I'm sorry to do
this, Captain."

"Why do you say that, General?"

"Queen Serenity is...enthusiastic, especially when it comes to making
new friends.  Extremely enthusiastic."

"Should we be afraid," T'Mir asked, a delicate eyebrow arching upward.

"Depends on your tolerance to syrupy sweetness," Ranma replied.
"You're not a diabetic, are you?"

T'Mir chuckled.  "It shouldn't be too difficult.  Although, if she is
as 'cheerful' as you say she is, the partisans may not want to join."

"We can only hope that she can restrain her enthusiasm."  Ranma turned
back to the communications officer.  "Mr. Merrik, have Her Majesty's
shuttle dock in the main hangar bay; Marines to report for honor guard
detail.

"Commander Dodge?"

"Yes General?"

"The bridge is yours.  I'll be in the hangar with Captain T'Mir."

"Yes General.  Shall we have your wife come down as well?"

Ranma smirked.  "No.  As much as that might keep Usagi quiet, I
believe she has other things to do.  Also, Commander you're out of
uniform.  I'm promoting you to the rank of 'Captain', effective
immediately.  Meet us in the main hangar deck."

"Yes sir."

Ranma and Captain T'Mir were awaiting Usagi's arrival in the main
hangar deck.  Creating an aisle near where Serenity's shuttle would
land, stood the EarthForce troops assigned to the Wild Stallion II.
Marines, armored cavalry troops, and a few pilots and ship's company
that could be spared stood in company formations, facing each other.
The Lambda-class shuttle could be seen through the atmospheric
containment shield, approaching the Imperator's main docking and
hangar bay; a quartet of X-wings flying security, in case any of the
TIE fighters that hadn't fled with the Imperial fleet, or surrendered,
caused trouble.
The loudspeaker squawked to life.  "Lunar One on final approach."  The
shuttle's wings folded up, as the craft neared the massive opening.
At an unheard command, the compliment of EarthForce personnel snapped
to attention as the shuttle's main gear touched the polished black
deck of the flagship's hangar.  As clouds of steam vented, the main
gangway lowered and a bosun's mate sounded her pipe, the shrill tones
echoing through the cavernous bay.

And a ball of energy, known to the fleet personnel as Queen Serenity
XVI, and to the high command as Usagi, came running down the gangway.
"Hiiiiiiiiiiiiii," she called, ruining the solemnity of the moment.
Of course, all it took was one former Sailor Suited fighter for Love
and Justice placing her foot wrong.  The Light Side of the Force was
taking a much need breather up at Toltir's, so Ranma was left without
warning.  The two of them hit, and with Ranma overbalanced, the two of
them landed on the deck.

Most of the assembled company looked at the sight of Usagi's head in
the Jedi's crotch, and kept silent.  Except for some wise guy from
Nerima's Furinkan district. "Damn, I wish I was the General," he said,
as Ranma's eyes crossed.  "I wouldn't be surprised if women always had
that effect on him."

"What, making his eyes go crossed like that," his friend, incidentally
also from Nerima, asked.

"You know, now that you mention it, Hiroshi, I've seen Lady Pluto do
that to him also.  But it's almost like the Force leaves the General,
letting them catch him unawares like that."

"Oh, why are we saddled with such an easily beleaguered general,"
Hiroshi asked.

Unfortunately, Ranma's excellent hearing, coupled with the Force
returning to him, happened to overhear the two computer techs from
Nerima.  A memory from Ranma's youth as a Saotome wormed its way up
from the depths.  He fixed the two Japanese crewmembers with a look,
and cleared his throat.  "You two wouldn't happen to be related to a
'Genma Saotome' would you?"  After assuming command of the EDF, Ranma
did a search on his wayward Terran father, and was not amused with
what he had found: Multiple warrants for his arrest, multiple arranged
marriages, and multiple debts in the name of "Ranma Saotome".

"No sir," Hiroshi and Daisuke said together, as one's went for their
crotch, and the other the collar of their uniform.  "Please, no!"
Their crewmates began sliding away from the perverted duo.

Propping himself up with one hand, he shook his head.  "You needn't
worry.  I'm not Darth Vader.  Or Dark Helmet.  My punishment will be
much more...entertaining."

"Gulp."  Even Captains T'Mir and Dodge winced at that.

Usagi choose this moment to open her mouth.  "Yph ifph Mffph!"

"What did she say?  No, wait.  On second thought, I'd rather not
know," the Jedi said, before muttering "Setsuna's going to kill me if
she finds out."

The Queen of the Moon picked her head up out of the Jedi's lap.  "What
was that all about?  I just tripped."

"Never you mind, Your Majesty," Ranma said, helping her up.  "You'll
find out when you're older."

Usagi missed the innuendo, of course.  "Wow, Ranma, that was some
battle.  Are all of them going to be like?  I hope not, because I'd
rather open friendly relations with the Empire, but if they're going
to be meanies about everything, then I guess we'll just have to fight
it out for love and justice."

She noticed Vulcan captain standing near the Jedi Master.  "Hi, I
guess you're Captain T'Mir.  I'm really glad we were able to help you
out, and liberate your planet.  I hope our systems can be friends, or
maybe even allies.  Come on; let's go talk to your people on the
ground."

Dodge couldn't help keep a smile off his face, as Usagi literally
dragged T'Mir off to the turbolifts.  "Thank God, that's not me," he
muttered.  "Commander Serith, you may dismiss the troops."

"Aye, aye Captain," the ship's new first officer replied.  "Company,
dismissed!"

00000

Setsuna had teleported off the ship prior to Usagi's arrival, and was
sitting in front of the doughnut-shaped Gates of Time.  "Oh kami, I
feel sorry for my husband," she said, watching the proceedings through
the mist-filled hole.  Laughter, though, bubbled up from Senshi of
Time.  "Well...maybe that could explain Usa's pink hair.  Ranma's
mother, after all, is a redhead."

"As well as you should, Guardian Pluto," the semi-sentient machine
replied.  "However, there will be a better outcome if Usagi negotiates
rather than if Ranma attempted to negotiate by himself.  Your husband
has, on several occasions admitted that he was not the negotiator his
brother was.

"Be that as it may, your husband's fleet will provide much needed
support in 2029, when Near Earth Asteroid 99942, or as NASA has dubbed
it 'Apophis', approaches the keyhole, which would have resulted in an
impact in 2036."  The image in the center of the Gates changed to show
Imperator Star Destroyers and Terran-built battleships closing on the
"Doomsday" asteroid.  Tractor beams latched on to the asteroid, and
the mile long warships began slowing the chunk of debris from the
herald of the end of the line of Serenity: the destruction of
Nemesis.  The reverse counterthrust from the six Imperators
effectively gave the large chunk of detritus a new orbit.  "The impact
of Apophis would have resulted in immediate regional devastation where
it would impact.  However, the long term effects would have been more
catastrophic.  I have calculated exactly where the impact would have
occurred,

Looks good.

Only a few small corrections in brackets []:

Also.  You have Ranma give Dodge the bridge, then immediately turn
back and promote him, then order him to the arrival bay.  Why?  What I
mean is, give us a reason for it because it makes things confused.

Ending by meeting up with the new aliens?  Let's hope they don't meet
with guns blazing.  Too many fronts in a war are a bad thing.  The
Germans found that our first hand.

&gt; &quot;A 400m wide asteroid, nicknamed Apophis, slams into the Yellowstone
