Now, I commit to penance for my unhinged tirades against the unwashed
sheep.

Everyone on SHWI likes to play with a surviving Alexander Hamilton,
who, by the time of his murder, had outlived his usefulness to the
young republic.

Everyone seems to forget John Marshall. It's easy, he didn't sign the
Declaration of Independence or write the Constitution. He did,
however, interpret them, and build America's legal system.

As the mastermind and architect of American law, and the Supreme
Court's longest sitting Chief Justice, he created Judicial Review and
carved out an equal spot for the Judiciary alongside the Executive and
the Legislature. And despite what Andrew Jackson might jeer, the Court
had real power, and Marshall sculpted much of that power.

But long before John Marshall put on a powdered whig and black robes,
he was a youth at war. As a member of the Culpeper Minutemen and
eventually, the Virginia Eleventh, he fought at Great Bridge,
Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, Stony Point and Paulus Hook. Like
much of the American army, he wintered at Valley Forge in 1777-78. It
was there that the young man gained Washington's ear and began to
climb upward in Revolutionary circles.

Now, many American soldiers died there, of cholera, typhoid, and all
sorts of unpleasant things. Suppose that earnest young John Marshall
catches one of those diseases at Valley Forge and dies.

History will go on much the same until 1799. Will John Jay, with a
lack of John Marshall, be reappointed the job he hates? Will someone
else take the less than favorite spot? Without Marshall, could a
series of shorter-lived Chief Justices build as formidable a Court?

Even by the loose standards of the time, Jefferson would be a weird

Exactly. Getting John Jay to keep his hand in as Chief Justice is
unlikely.

So, justices of the US Supreme Court, c. 1795-1810:

William Cushing, Unitarian of Boston, d. 1810
Thomas Johnson, Anglican from Maryland, d. 1819
William Paterson, "Protestant" Delaware, d. 1806
Oliver Ellsworth, Congregationalist of CT, CJ 1796-1800, d. 1807
Samuel Chase, Maryland, d. 1811

Any chance of Madison as CJ? He seemed to be able to get along with

I am searching for the "invention" of the term "judicial temperament"
and find that it only arise in the 18th Century, and actually still
not be necessary for a seat on the Supreme Court. I can name two
sitting justices without that quality. It does not seem to preclude
Thomas Jefferson serving a term, much as others had before him, in
order to bring the law to the people, ie "be political on the court".

"Nineteenth and twentieth century extrajudicial writings reflected the
Court's image of itself. The individual Justice responded to the
environment in which he functioned.[2] The early Court carried less
prestige and power than it did in later decades. During George
Washington's Administration, the Court was not equal in stature to the
Presidency or to Congress. President Washington experienced a hard
time filling the Bench, with five candidates declining appointment.
John Jay, the first Chief Justice, resigned after five years due to
disillusionment with the office. Some Justices did not feel that they
gained prominent status through their occupation, and appointments to
the Court were considerably less coveted than they are now. In the
public's mind, who sat on the Court did not matter as much as it would
later.[3]

In the early days, the majority of Justices were politically active
before their elevation to the Court, and were often political on the
Court.[4] During the Marshall Court era, however, the Court spoke as a
body, and if it or its individual members acted politically, no
Justice said so. Instead, they claimed to discover the law. Marshall
said that judges did not give effect to their own will, but to the
will of the legislature and of the law.[5] As Chief Justice, he
instituted the non-seriatim Court opinion, whereby the individual
Justices no longer expected their own writings of the case to be
distinguished from a single Court opinion, as English cases were
written. The Marshall Court spoke in unison in the majority of cases."

This barely scratches the surface of the question, but...

One thing that I was thinking of was, What if a High Federalist  was
appointed instead of the moderate Federalist Marshall?  (For this to
happen, the vacancy probably has to occur earlier, before Adams broke with
the High Federalists.)

We have to remember that for all the antagonism between Jefferson and
Marshall, the latter was very careful not to go too far in a confrontation
with the Republicans.  (As R. Kent Newmyer puts it in *John Marshall and
the Heroic Age of the Supreme Court,* p. 151, "Marshall knew that the
Court would come under attack, and he also understood that the institution
he inherited was weak.") In *Marbury v. Madison* for example, after
scolding Jefferson, Marshall's bottom line after all was that the Court
would *not* give Marbury his writ of mandamus (because Section 13 of the
Judiciary Act was unconstitutional in allegedly expanding the original
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court).  Thus, in the very act of (perhaps
unnecesarily in this case [1]) asserting the power of the Court to declare
Acts of Congress unconstitutional, Marshall avoided a direct clash with
Jefferson--who would have successfully ignored any order to give Marbury
his commission.  Very few contemporaries commented on Marshall's
discussion of judicial review--amazing as this may seem to later
generations, the issue was just not that controversial at the time.
Jefferson was later bitter about the case, but solely on account of
Marshall's exended discussion of Marbury's right to his commission, which
Jefferson characterized as merely an "obiter dissertation."
http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl272.htm

I'm just wondering if a more partisan Chief Justice might have persuaded
the Court to grant Marbury his mandamus [2] (there are plausible if not
necessarily convincing arguments that Congress *can* add to the original
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court) and set up a confrontation with the
Executive that the Court was bound to lose.  Moreover, such a Chief
Justice might also persuade the Court to declare the 1802 repeal of the
1801 Judiciary Act unconstitutional in *Stuart v. Laird*, a case which was
much more eagerly awaited and thought  to be of greater significance than
*Marbury.*   In that event, the Republican  attack on the judiciary might
be far more damaging to the Supreme Court than in OTL, because some
moderate Republicans who balked at going too far in OTL (e.g., in the
trial of Justice Chase) might have joined in the assault.

(It is possible that I am exaggerating how far the Court might have gone
in a disastrous ultra-Federalist direction without Marshall.  There were
other moderate Federalists on the Court, such as Bushrod Washington.  In
fact, Chase seems to have been the only really shrill extremist on the
Court.  Still, if he got people like Cushing and Paterson to go along with
him, they might have led the Court into danger without Marshall to
restrain them.)

One other thought:  Instead of having Marshall dead, what if he is alive--
but is not confirmed?  (POD:  The Hamilton Federalists want to get back at
Adams and the Republicans want to delay any appointment until Jefferson
gets into office.  In OTL, he was confirmed within a week, but according
to Newmyer, there was "considerable backroom resistance among
Federalists." p. 142.)

[1] Even if one grants Marshall's argument that Congress cannot add to the
original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, the Court could have
interpreted Section 13 as not adding to the Court's jurisidction at all,
but merely authorizing the Court to issue writs of mandamus in cases where
it already had jurisdiction (whether appellate or original).  See Akhil
Reed Amar, "Marbury, Section 13, and the Original Jurisidction of the
Supreme Court," 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 443 (1989) for a defense of this
interpretation.
http://islandia.law.yale.edu/amar/lawreview/1989Marbury.pdf According to
Amar, the Court's reasons for avoiding this interpretation are "easy to
imagine. In the middle of a political mine field, and with all eyes upon
him, John Marshall managed to empower his branch even as he backed away
from a fight with a new and popular President. [FN94] By creatively
misreading § 13, Marshall could dramatically affirm the doctrine of
judicial review in a way that would be unlikely to generate a political
backlash. [FN95] What's more, amazingly little damage to doctrine would
result. The Marbury Court's technical disposition was exactly the same as
that required by the 'remedial power' reading: dismissal of the case for
want of jurisdiction. The only difference is that the Marbury Court's
disposition was based on the Constitution, whereas the 'remedial power'
reading would have led to a purely statutory holding. But even this
difference shrinks virtually to a vanishing point if the Marbury Court's
view of Article III was correct. If so, *463 the worst thing that could be
said about Marbury from a technical point of view is that by
misinterpreting § 13, the Court needlessly [FN96]--but correctly--made
clear that Congress could not do something that Congress had not (yet)
tried to do."

[2] Assuming that the case comes to the Court at all.  There is a theory
to the effect that Marshall set up the whole case for political purposes.
However, as Newmyer wrtites (p. 160):  "It makes a dramatic story to
infer, as some accounts have done, that by not delivering the commissions,
then bringing his brother [James Marshall] in to verify their existence,
John Marshall had planned the case from the beginning.  That radical
interpretation, which assumes the chief justice was all-knowing as well as
unethical, is not credible on several counts.   First, it should be
remembered that Marshall continued as secretary of state until the last
minute, not because of nefarious scheming but because President Jefferson
requested he do so. Another problem is that Marshall was not responsible
for the last-minute delivery of the commissions to his office, ubnless he
had persuaded honest John Adams to join the conspiracy."  Beyond that, as
Newmyer notes, we have to assume that Marshall knew that Jefferson would
not permit the delviery of the commissions, that Marbury would go the
trouble of suing for them, that the suit would be brought in the Supreme
Court under section 13, that other other Justices would go along with
Marshall's opinion, etc.  All of which seems pretty implausible.

In any event, even if we assume that without Marshall, there is no
*Marbury* I am only using it as an example of how he avoided possible
clashes with the Republicans which the Court might otherwise have gotten
into.

Then the only requirement to become a lawyer would be admission to the
bar?

This powerful advocate of liberty was born in 1743 in Albemarle
County, Virginia, inheriting from his father, a planter and surveyor,
some 5,000 acres of land, and from his mother, a Randolph, high social
standing. He studied at the College of William and Mary, then read
law. In 1772 he married Martha Wayles Skelton, a widow, and took her
to live in his partly constructed mountaintop home, Monticello.
http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/tj3.html

Having reached the rank of captain, Marshall returned to Virginia in
1779. He studied law privately, attending lectures conducted by George
Wythe at the College of William and Mary. He was admitted to the bar
in 1780, but returned to the army when British troops invaded Virginia
later in the same year.

">

He was admitted to the bar of the General Court of Virginia in its October
term in 1766 and was an active member until 1774.  See Frank L. Dewey's
*Thomas Jefferson, Lawyer.*
http://www.amazon.com/Thomas-Jefferson-Lawyer-Frank-Dewey/dp/081391079X

See also Roland S. Morris's 1943 "Jefferson as a Lawyer," *Proceedings of the
American Philosophical Society* (vol. 87, 1944):

"...Even as late as last year, Mr. Padover, in his *Life of Jefferson,* while
admitting that Jefferson had a brilliant education in the law, would seem to
deny him the right to be called a lawyer.  'It cannot be denied,' he  says,
'that Jefferson was not cut out to be a lwayer,--a scholar, a scientist, an
inventor, an architect, a botanist--Yes, but not a lawyer.  His mind was too
inquisitive, too speculative, and, above all, too much given to ideas as
such, to be happy in the arid wastes of jurisprudence.'  Leaving aside this
rather disparaging reference to an absence of ideas as an adequate
preparation for the law, I hope that I may be able to show that it was
possession of ideas, of inquisitiveness, and of a speculative temperament
that made Jefferson the useful and constructive lawyer that he was...

"It is well for us to remember that Jefferson spent five years as a student
of the law, that he spent the succeeding seven years in the active practice
of his profession, and that subsequently, for more than two years, he devoted
himself almost exclusively to a reform in the laws of Virginia...All this
study and experience represent some 15 years of devotion to the law...

"Let us turn now, for just a moment, to Jefferson's achievements in the
actual practice of the law.

"As already stated, he was admitted to practice at the Bar of the General
Court in 1767, and he continued in active and most successful practice until
August 11, 1774, when he surrendered his law business to Edmund Randolph.
His success at the law was striking.  During his first year, he was employed
in 68 cases, and for the four following years his employment steadily
increased...In his second year he acted as counsel for 115 cases in the
General Court, in 1769 for 198; in 1770 for 221; in 1771 for 237.  In 1772,
owing to his increasing absorption in the political relations between the
Colonies and Great Britian, there was a fall in his practice to 154 cases.  In
1773 the number dropped to 127, and during the months that he remained in
active practice during 1774 the number had dropped to 29.  It was in August
of that year that he finally decided  that his obvious duty was, for the
present at least, to abandon active practice and devote himself to the vital
and challenging interests of Virginia and its sister Colonies.  These figures
I have cited refer only to the cases in which he participated before the
General Court.  He also appeared constantly before the County Courts."

http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1422372170&amp;id=EVkLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=R...

Jefferson, btw, was not happy with happened to the legal profession after he
retired from it, and put much of the blame on Blackstone:  "In the selection
of our Law Professor, we must be rigorously attentive to his political
principles. You will recollect that before the revolution, Coke [on]
Littleton was the universal elementary book of law students, and a sounder
whig never wrote, nor of profounder learning in the orthodox doctrines of the
British constitution, or in what were called English liberties. You remember
also that our lawyers were then all whigs. But when his black-letter text,
and uncouth but cunning learning got out of fashion, and the honied
Mansfieldism of Blackstone became the student's hornbook, from that moment,
that profession (the nursery of our Congress) began to slide into toryism,
and nearly all the young brood of lawyers now are of that hue. They suppose
themselves, indeed, to be whigs, because they no longer know what whigism or
republicanism means."

All in all, though Jefferson was not a practicing lawyer after the Revolution
he certainly had sufficient legal knowledge and experience to be a Supreme
Court justice; it's just that this was not the kind of job he would want, nor
is it probable that any of the early presidents would appoint him to it, at
least once the Federalist-Republican divide emerged.  (A Federalist president
wasn't going to appoint him, and the overwhelming favorite for the first
Republican presidency was Jefferosn himself.  Nor would he be interested in
getting the job once he himself retired from the presidency.)

&gt; &gt; Jefferson wasn't a lawyer.

&gt; He was admitted to the bar of the General Court of Virginia in its October
&gt; term in 1766 and was an active member until 1774.  See Frank L. Dewey's
&gt; *Thomas Jefferson, Lawyer.* http://www.amazon.com/Thomas-Jefferson-Lawyer-Frank-Dewey/dp/081391079X

&gt; See also Roland S. Morris's 1943 &quot;Jefferson as a Lawyer,&quot; *Proceedings of the
&gt; American Philosophical Society* (vol. 87, 1944):

&gt; &quot;...Even as late as last year, Mr. Padover, in his *Life of Jefferson,* while
&gt; admitting that Jefferson had a brilliant education in the law, would seem to
&gt; deny him the right to be called a lawyer.  'It cannot be denied,' he  says,
&gt; 'that Jefferson was not cut out to be a lwayer,--a scholar, a scientist, an
&gt; inventor, an architect, a botanist--Yes, but not a lawyer.  His mind was too
&gt; inquisitive, too speculative, and, above all, too much given to ideas as
&gt; such, to be happy in the arid wastes of jurisprudence.'  Leaving aside this
&gt; rather disparaging reference to an absence of ideas as an adequate
&gt; preparation for the law, I hope that I may be able to show that it was
&gt; possession of ideas, of inquisitiveness, and of a speculative temperament
&gt; that made Jefferson the useful and constructive lawyer that he was...

&gt; &quot;It is well for us to remember that Jefferson spent five years as a student
&gt; of the law, that he spent the succeeding seven years in the active practice
&gt; of his profession, and that subsequently, for more than two years, he devoted
&gt; himself almost exclusively to a reform in the laws of Virginia...All this
&gt; study and experience represent some 15 years of devotion to the law...

&gt; &quot;Let us turn now, for just a moment, to Jefferson's achievements in the
&gt; actual practice of the law.

&gt; &quot;As already stated, he was admitted to practice at the Bar of the General
&gt; Court in 1767, and he continued in active and most successful practice until
&gt; August 11, 1774, when he surrendered his law business to Edmund Randolph.
&gt; His success at the law was striking.  During his first year, he was employed
&gt; in 68 cases, and for the four following years his employment steadily
&gt; increased...In his second year he acted as counsel for 115 cases in the
&gt; General Court, in 1769 for 198; in 1770 for 221; in 1771 for 237.  In 1772,
&gt; owing to his increasing absorption in the political relations between the
&gt; Colonies and Great Britian, there was a fall in his practice to 154 cases.  In
&gt; 1773 the number dropped to 127, and during the months that he remained in
&gt; active practice during 1774 the number had dropped to 29.  It was in August
&gt; of that year that he finally decided  that his obvious duty was, for the
&gt; present at least, to abandon active practice and devote himself to the vital
&gt; and challenging interests of Virginia and its sister Colonies.  These figures
&gt; I have cited refer only to the cases in which he participated before the
&gt; General Court.  He also appeared constantly before the County Courts.&quot;

&gt; Jefferson, btw, was not happy with happened to the legal profession after he
&gt; retired from it, and put much of the blame on Blackstone:  &quot;In the selection
&gt; of our Law Professor, we must be rigorously attentive to his political
&gt; principles. You will recollect that before the revolution, Coke [on]
&gt; Littleton was the universal elementary book of law students, and a sounder
&gt; whig never wrote, nor of profounder learning in the orthodox doctrines of the
&gt; British constitution, or in what were called English liberties. You remember
&gt; also that our lawyers were then all whigs. But when his black-letter text,
&gt; and uncouth but cunning learning got out of fashion, and the honied
&gt; Mansfieldism of Blackstone became the student's hornbook, from that moment,
&gt; that profession (the nursery of our Congress) began to slide into toryism,
&gt; and nearly all the young brood of lawyers now are of that hue. They suppose
&gt; themselves, indeed, to be whigs, because they no longer know what whigism or
&gt; republicanism means.&quot; http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl286.htm

&gt; All in all, though Jefferson was not a practicing lawyer after the Revolution
&gt; he certainly had sufficient legal knowledge and experience to be a Supreme
&gt; Court justice; it's just that this was not the kind of job he would want, nor
&gt; is it probable that any of the early presidents would appoint him to it, at

Would a Federalist president appoint Jefferson to be Chief Justice
just to get him out of the way for the next presidential term? At the
time the CJ job seems to have been the sort of job one took to fill
in, Marshall made the life appointment a feature of the positives.
Play on TJ's tiny ego to make the common man a part of the new
government, with the understanding that 1804 or 1808 were not that far
away.

Question of Jefferson not being President in 1803, would any one else
have bought Louisiana or would they have settled for New Orleans?

The Wikipedia article doesn't mention
law among his college studies; it mentions his
practice of law in only a half sentence,
which I missed. And a sentence on studying
law with George Blythe and admission to the
bar. (Sez in 1767 though. Should it be corrected?)

Wikipedia has much more explicit mentions
of law practice in the articles on each of
the early justices.

I did wonder at the reference to Jefferson
drafting 126 bills in the Virginia legislature.
