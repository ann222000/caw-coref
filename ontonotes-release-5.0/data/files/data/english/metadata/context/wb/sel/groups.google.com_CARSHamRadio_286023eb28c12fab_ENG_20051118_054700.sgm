SYNOPSIS OF THE NWS SKYWARN MEETING

&quot;A Skywarn Spotters meeting for the National Weather Service (NWS) Ruskin
Warning Area was held at 7:00 PM on Thursday night, November 17, 2005, at
the Kings Point Condominiums clubhouse in Sun City Center. The meeting was
hosted by the Kings Point Amateur Radio Club (KPARC) and Sun City Center
Amateur Radio Club (SCCARC).

The meeting was chaired by Shawn Bennett, Meteorologist-in-Charge, and Nick
Petro-N3OET, Senior Forecaster, from the NWS-Ruskin office. The meeting was
well attended by Skywarn Spotters from throughout the Tampa Bay area.

The purpose of the meeting was to announce a reorganization of the Skywarn
program in the 15 county NWS-Ruskin Warning Area as a way of starting over
new and as a fresh start to reinvigorate the program.

Nick Petro-N3OET, Senior Forecaster, will be taking over the day-to-day
management of the Skywarn program from Dan Noah-WX4DAN, Warning
Coordination Meteorologist, who has overseen the Skywarn program for the
past several years. Dan will continue to be involved with the Skywarn
program, although not in a day-to-day capacity.

A new amateur radio call sign, KI4MNY, has been procured for the amateur
radio station located at the NWS-Ruskin office and Nick Petro-N3OET will
serve as the trustee for this new call sign. A vanity callsign has been
applied for as the new NWS Station callsign. WX4TBW will no longer be used

The reorganized NWS-Ruskin Skywarn program will be run directly by the
National Weather Service itself instead of the &quot;Group, Inc.&quot; The
reorganized Skywarn program will operate in close association with
Emergency Management agencies and Skywarn Spotters at the local county
level.

Amateur radio operators are being recruited to staff the NWS-Ruskin amateur
radio station during severe weather emergencies and to liaison with local
county Skywarn programs on local county HF, VHF, and UHF amateur radio
frequencies.

The SEDAN packet radio system, APRS, 800 toll-free telephone number, local
telephone number, NWS website on-line reporting, and voice amateur radio
will be &quot;tools in the toolbox&quot; for Skywarn Spotters to alert the National
Weather Service to severe weather situations.&quot;

The NWS-Ruskin Skywarn Spotter web page located at
is in the process
of being revised to reflect the changes announced to the NWS-Ruskin Skywarn
program. You can visit this web page in the near future for Skywarn news
and information.

It was announced that both the Basic &amp; Advanced Skywarn Spotter training
classes will be offered at the Tampa Bay Hamfest on Saturday December 3,
2005 from 3:00 PM until 5:00 PM. Additional Skywarn Spotter training
classes will be held on Saturday February 18, 2006 at both the Hillsborough
County Emergency Operations Center and at the Pinellas County Emergency
Operations Center.

The 2005 Skywarn Recognition Day,
, will be held on Saturday
December 3, 2005. NWS-Ruskin will be holding an open-house for amateur
radio operators on that date. A Skywarn forum will also be held that day at
the Tampa Bay Hamfest along with a Skywarn special event station.

After the meeting adjourned, Dan Noah-WX4DAN Warning Coordination
Meteorologist, hosted a tour of the NWS-Ruskin office.

Feel free to e-mail Nick Petro-N3OET, Senior Forecaster at
&lt;nicholas.pe ... @noaa.gov&gt; or Dan Noah-WX4DAN, Warning Coordination
Meteorologist at &lt;daniel.n ... @noaa.gov&gt; with any questions you may have
about these changes to the Skywarn program in the NWS-Ruskin Warning Area.

Thanks goes to Gary, KC5QCN for this write up of the meeting we attended.

Neil,
Thanks for the notes. It's too bad I didn't read my e-mail until about
6:15 Thursday, having decided I would not be able to get to the meeting.
Perhaps next time I'll get with the program.

Hi Tom,

Since I had no input into their plans and I can only go by what they said.
Their stated reason was that because of a schism in the SKYWARN community
they wanted to start over fresh and with more control over their own
program. It may have had something to do with the fact the new guy is a ham
and the WX4TBW trustee is not a NWS employee and they wanted control over
their own callsign using their ham as the trustee of the new callsign. But
that is only speculation on my part. You really need to direct your question
to them. Or ask Paul, NA4AR who is the WX4TBW trustee. I know he stayed
behind after the meeting and spoke with both Shawn Bennett, NWS
Meteorologist-in-Charge, and Nick Petro-N3OET, Senior Forecaster, from the
NWS-Ruskin office and maybe they explained it to him.

Try Nick Petro, N3OET,
Senior Forecaster, from the NWS-Ruskin office.

Neil,

I'm not suggesting you did have any input into the NWS decisions, I am
merely asking for information, as you were at the meeting and have posted a
synopsis of the agenda.

It seems that the old issues of personal politics has found a way into the
WCF Skywarn program make over, as I notice that more than one APRS weather
station in Pinellas county is down tonight, presumably due to the results of
last night's meeting.

I for one am extremely tired of this. Instead of working together for a
greater good, some hams still are nursing a personal vendetta against other
hams in the section. We as leaders in the amateur radio community should be
ashamed that this continues. In fact, it's been going on for years. I say
it's time for it to stop. I expect better leadership from all levels in our
section. Time to grow up, and learn to get along.

Hi Tom,

Yes I was in attendance at the meeting. The Synopsis was not mine. I simply
forwarded the remarks made by Gary Sessums, KC5QCN the EC/Radio Officer from
Hillsborough County. I thought they were short and to the point without any
animousity contained in them. So I was trying to point out that I was an
advid listener and I am just as sure everyone came away from the meeting
with varied opinions on what was said. This was just an introduction to new
ideas and concepts meeting with more actual workshops to iron out the
details. So I was just trying to keep it simple for everyone and I thought
that Gary did a good job sumarizing the meeting and I had no need to
imbellish on his message. Nor did I want to speculate beyond my attempt to
guess at what I heard as to why they dropped the WX4TBW call.
I have since followed up on their request for everyone who feels they have a
stake in providing this service to pass along their ideas to the NWS. I
recommend everyone also do the same. This will help the NWS to formulate an
agenda for the upcoming workshops.

73,
Neil

A new amateur radio call sign, KI4MNY, has been procured for the amateur
radio station located at the NWS-Ruskin office and Nick Petro-N3OET will
serve as the trustee for this new call sign. A vanity callsign has been
applied for as the new NWS Station callsign. WX4TBW will no longer be used

The reorganized NWS-Ruskin Skywarn program will be run directly by the
National Weather Service itself instead of the &quot;Group, Inc.&quot; The reorganized
Skywarn program will operate in close association with Emergency Management
agencies and Skywarn Spotters at the local county level.

Amateur radio operators are being recruited to staff the NWS-Ruskin amateur
radio station during severe weather emergencies and to liaison with local
county Skywarn programs on local county HF, VHF, and UHF amateur radio
frequencies.

The SEDAN packet radio system, APRS, 800 toll-free telephone number, local
telephone number, NWS website on-line reporting, and voice amateur radio
will be &quot;tools in the toolbox&quot; for Skywarn Spotters to alert the National
Weather Service to severe weather situations.&quot;

The NWS-Ruskin Skywarn Spotter web page located at
http://www.srh.noaa.gov/tbw/html/tbw/skywarn/skywarn.htm  is in the process
of being revised to reflect the changes announced to the NWS-Ruskin Skywarn
program. You can visit this web page in the near future for Skywarn news and
information.

It was announced that both the Basic &amp; Advanced Skywarn Spotter training
classes will be offered at the Tampa Bay Hamfest on Saturday December 3,
2005 from 3:00 PM until 5:00 PM. Additional Skywarn Spotter training
classes will be held on Saturday February 18, 2006 at both the Hillsborough
County Emergency Operations Center and at the Pinellas County Emergency
Operations Center.

The 2005 Skywarn Recognition Day,
http://www.crh.noaa.gov/hamradio/index.php , will be held on Saturday
December 3, 2005. NWS-Ruskin will be holding an open-house for amateur radio
operators on that date. A Skywarn forum will also be held that day at the
Tampa Bay Hamfest along with a Skywarn special event station.

After the meeting adjourned, Dan Noah-WX4DAN Warning Coordination
Meteorologist, hosted a tour of the NWS-Ruskin office.

&gt; Hi Tom,

&gt; Yes I was in attendance at the meeting. The Synopsis was not mine. I simply
&gt; forwarded the remarks made by Gary Sessums, KC5QCN the EC/Radio Officer from
&gt; Hillsborough County. I thought they were short and to the point without any
&gt; animousity contained in them. So I was trying to point out that I was an
&gt; advid listener and I am just as sure everyone came away from the meeting
&gt; with varied opinions on what was said. This was just an introduction to new
&gt; ideas and concepts meeting with more actual workshops to iron out the
&gt; details. So I was just trying to keep it simple for everyone and I thought
&gt; that Gary did a good job sumarizing the meeting and I had no need to
&gt; imbellish on his message. Nor did I want to speculate beyond my attempt to
&gt; guess at what I heard as to why they dropped the WX4TBW call.
&gt; I have since followed up on their request for everyone who feels they have a
&gt; stake in providing this service to pass along their ideas to the NWS. I
&gt; recommend everyone also do the same. This will help the NWS to formulate an
&gt; agenda for the upcoming workshops.

&gt; 73,
&gt; Neil

&gt; ===================================
&gt; Neil,

&gt; I'm not suggesting you did have any input into the NWS decisions, I am
&gt; merely asking for information, as you were at the meeting and have posted a
&gt; synopsis of the agenda.

&gt; It seems that the old issues of personal politics has found a way into the
&gt; WCF Skywarn program make over, as I notice that more than one APRS weather
&gt; station in Pinellas county is down tonight, presumably due to the results of
&gt; last night's meeting.

&gt; I for one am extremely tired of this. Instead of working together for a
&gt; greater good, some hams still are nursing a personal vendetta against other
&gt; hams in the section. We as leaders in the amateur radio community should be
&gt; ashamed that this continues. In fact, it's been going on for years. I say
&gt; it's time for it to stop. I expect better leadership from all levels in our
&gt; section. Time to grow up, and learn to get along.

&gt; Hi Tom,

&gt; Since I had no input into their plans and I can only go by what they said.
&gt; Their stated reason was that because of a schism in the SKYWARN community
&gt; they wanted to start over fresh and with more control over their own
&gt; program. It may have had something to do with the fact the new guy is a ham
&gt; and the WX4TBW trustee is not a NWS employee and they wanted control over
&gt; their own callsign using their ham as the trustee of the new callsign. But
&gt; that is only speculation on my part. You really need to direct your question
&gt; to them. Or ask Paul, NA4AR who is the WX4TBW trustee. I know he stayed
&gt; behind after the meeting and spoke with both Shawn Bennett, NWS
&gt; Meteorologist-in-Charge, and Nick Petro-N3OET, Senior Forecaster, from the
&gt; NWS-Ruskin office and maybe they explained it to him.

&gt; Try Nick Petro, N3OET,
&gt; Senior Forecaster, from the NWS-Ruskin office. nicholas.pe ... @noaa.gov

&gt; Can you shed some light as to the reason the 'WX4TBW call sign will no

You know - what I found very interesting at the meeting was that Shawn
made it very clear that while Skywarn needs to have a relationship with
emergency managment, it doesn't work FOR emergency management. They made
it very clear that while there may have been mis-communication in years
past about Skywarn being an EM (emergency management) function due to
StormReady, as of last night - it is no longer. As far as Shawn &amp; Nick
are concerned, they are separate entities. First and foremost, Skywarn
volunteers are supposed to report weather conditions that meet reporting
criteria as quickly as possible to the NWS, using whatever &quot;tools in the
toolbox&quot; that we have at our disposal. Once they have that information,
they will use it in addition to their other tools at the office to
create a warning for the community at large - which includes EM.

Secondly: The also mentioned that they are willing to work with and will
take reports from any club or group in an area that would like to
participate in the Skywarn program, and would be willing to provide
training to such groups. They are actively trying to breathe life into
the program, and are willing to take people however they can get it.

I think the concern is that several years ago, Jack Belich was in charge of
the Pinellas Skywarn program. For lack of a better term, it was a &quot;civilian&quot;
program - not tied to EM.

Around the time Jack quit, it was brought to a committee of leaders in the
Pinellas Amateur community to keep it going. And agreement was reached - or
so was thought.. But then it was brought under the ACS umbrella without the
committee being advised. Now over the past few years - whether intentional
or not, it appeared to ACS &quot;outsiders&quot; that it was being operated just like
an ACS program... And until just recently, we were told net controls had to
be ACS members.

I'm excited that there is change occuring. In my mind, a few more things
need to happen for this to really jump start and get things hopping though..

Around the time Jack quit, it was brought to a committee of leaders in the Pinellas Amateur community to keep it going. And agreement was reached - or so was thought..

Unfortunately that committee meet a few times and then dissolved, not sure why.

But then it was brought under the ACS umbrella without the committee being advised.

The NWS asked EM in all of the counties in the TBW area, to help manage the skywarn program at the county level. Pinellas EM, having limited staff, decided to have there amateur volunteers help do the managing that the NWS had asked them to do. This was logical since all the ACS people were SKYWARN and ARES volunteers , many who have been in Pinellas SKYWARN before there were any other programs in the state.

Now over the past few years - whether intentional or not, it appeared to ACS &quot;outsiders&quot; that it was being operated just like an ACS program...

Please explain &quot;like a ACS Program&quot;

And until just recently, we were told net controls had to be ACS members.

I do not recall anything stating net controls had to be ACS members, just trained spotters and preferably a net control training course that is being provided recently. And it has been always stated, if there are no &quot;net controls&quot; on frequency when a skywarn event warrants net activation, any licensed trained spotter may take on the responsibility of net control.

I'm excited that there is change occuring. In my mind, a few more things need to happen for this to really jump start and get things hopping though..

I agree on this, but probably have a different idea of &quot;things&quot;

#1: Why was the committee desolved?

I guess it would be best to have Neil comment on this. He is the one that
told AI4ET, one of the commitee members that ACS would be taking over the
program.

#2: If the ACS director is running the Skywarn program, wouldn't that be
running it &quot;like an ACS program&quot;? I guess there is a big grey area when the
same person is the director of both programs, and there is one combined
ACS/ARES/Skywarn net. Looks like everything is combined under one roof to
me.

I'm just going to cut to the chase here.. I don't want to be the ring leader
of the new Pinellas Skywarn. I simply want to help build a better Pinellas
Skywarn program. The only way this is going to work is a COMPLETE overhaul
of Pinellas County Skywarn - including new leadership... Leadership that is
elected by the amateurs that are participating in the program.

Shawn &amp; Nick have taken a great first step. We need to step up, act like
adults, and realize that we need to do the same here as well.

&gt; Unfortunately that committee meet a few times and then dissolved, not
&gt; sure why.
&gt; But then it was brought under the ACS umbrella without the committee
&gt; being advised.
&gt; The NWS asked EM in all of the counties in the TBW area, to help manage
&gt; the skywarn program at the county level. Pinellas EM, having limited staff,
&gt; decided to have there amateur volunteers help do the managing that the NWS
&gt; had asked them to do. This was logical since all the ACS people were SKYWARN
&gt; and ARES volunteers , many who have been in Pinellas SKYWARN before there
&gt; were any other programs in the state.
&gt; Now over the past few years - whether intentional or not, it appeared
&gt; to ACS &quot;outsiders&quot; that it was being operated just like an ACS program...
&gt; Please explain &quot;like a ACS Program&quot;
&gt; And until just recently, we were told net controls had to be ACS
&gt; members.
&gt; I do not recall anything stating net controls had to be ACS members, just
&gt; trained spotters and preferably a net control training course that is being
&gt; provided recently. And it has been always stated, if there are no &quot;net
&gt; controls&quot; on frequency when a skywarn event warrants net activation, any
&gt; licensed trained spotter may take on the responsibility of net control.

&gt; I'm excited that there is change occuring. In my mind, a few more things
&gt; need to happen for this to really jump start and get things hopping though..

&gt; I agree on this, but probably have a different idea of &quot;things&quot;

I guess it would be best to have Neil comment on this. He is the one that told AI4ET, one of the commitee members that ACS would be taking over the program.

Then if that's the case, then it came from the NWS - EM to make those decisions. Not the hams

#2: If the ACS director is running the Skywarn program, wouldn't that be running it &quot;like an ACS program&quot;? I guess there is a big grey area when the same person is the director of both programs, and there is one combined ACS/ARES/Skywarn net. Looks like everything is combined under one roof to me.

The reason why one person WAS doing everything is no one was volunteering for any position.

There is now a new ARES EC, we are still looking for a ham radio skywarn COORDINATOR (directorship comes from the NWS, and the ham radio coordinator does just that, coordinates the HAM side of the skywarn program such as developing net control procedures ect.., not anything about the skywarn program it self, that's NWS's baby) and recently have been made aware that a long time skywarn participant may be willing to volunteer for that position.

Having one net makes sense. Most all hams involved are members of all three organizations. To have different nets covering the same things, and trying to find time for 3 different nets does not seem to be the best utilization of the limited time that many of us have.

As far as being combined, yes, there is no difference in what all three groups do, help the served agencies provide better service to the people of Pinellas county. As the ARRL has stated for a long time, if we are all members of all the groups (note EM limits the number of members in ACS) then all we have to do is turn our hats around to serve in whatever function that we are needed at the time. With the limited participation of amateurs in public service, this sounds like a good idea to me.

I'm just going to cut to the chase here.. I don't want to be the ring leader of the new Pinellas Skywarn. I simply want to help build a better Pinellas Skywarn program. The only way this is going to work is a COMPLETE overhaul of Pinellas County Skywarn - including new leadership... Leadership that is elected by the amateurs that are participating in the program.

I do not believe that it is as bad as you are trying to make it out to be. There are just a few individuals, that for what ever reason only know to them self's, are causing tension. Unfortunately because of this many who do not care for this kind of politics just have stopped participating. Once these individuals stop with the childish actions, hopefully more hams will come back. We are seeing this now in both ACS and ARES, as both organizations are growing, and I believe we will see it in skywarn to. Fortunatly here in Pinellas its been a quiet thunderstorm season. When the storms do come I am sure we will see a good turn out of hams.

Shawn &amp; Nick have taken a great first step. We need to step up, act like adults, and realize that we need to do the same here as well.

Absolutly agree on this.

Please clarify: Who exactly is looking for a new Skywarn coordinator?
ACS/ARES or the NWS? I assume you mean for Pinellas County or are you
referring to the Ruskin coverage area? If you mean ACS/ARES, then why do
you think ACS/ARES 'owns' Skywarn? I thought that myth was dispelled at the
meeting this past Thursday? Again if this coordinator is an ACS/ARES
creature, then I assume you mean that that person would report to the ACS
Radio Officer. Here is the crux of the issue for many of us. Three years
ago there was much howling and griping when it appeared that Paul Toth was
in a leadership position over several groups. The argument against him was
that &quot;one person should not be in charge of so many groups&quot;. So OK. What's
good for the goose is good for the gander. ACS doesn't need to be in
control of everything. The ACS leadership isn't even elected, and has no
accountability to the general amateur population at large.

Also, where was this need announced? This is the first I've heard of any
need for a Skywarn coordinator. Frankly, I think Paul and Dan were doing a
fantastic job before ACS 'assumed' ownership.

I disagree with you Demos. Things are bad in Pinellas County. To me, the
issue boils down to leadership. That is why there is an alternative EMCOMM
group called PCERT who is active and growing in the county. When there was
quality leadership in the Skywarn program three years ago, things worked
well. Since then, not so well. Paul Toth (and some others) built the
WX4TBW station and call to the point where the phrase 'WX4TBW, Tampa Bay
Weather' is something every ham in the WCF section is familiar with. In my
opinion it's total foolishness to flush that kind of recognition and good
will down the drain, just because someone is nursing a grudge against him.

Shawn &amp; Nick have taken a great first step. We need to step up, act like
adults, and realize that we need to do the same here as well.

I'm still waiting for an answer from Shawn and Nick as to why the Ruskin
APRS station is down. I sincerely hope they aren't getting advice from the
anti-Toth individuals. I keep hearing that the NWS plans to dump APRS or
diminish it's role in the collection of weather data. I hope this nonsense
isn't true. Do you have any information regarding this?

Absolutly agree on this.

All-

I'm going to ignore the political discussion - I can do without more
politics.

I will answer one question:

I think the NWS folks make it very clear at the meeting that they value
and use the APRS data that the community provides. Shawn mentioned (and Dan
Noah demonstrated) the capability NWS has to overlay the APRS weather data
on the other data NWS uses in their forecast systems (using Linux, by the
way).

I have not heard anything to contradict their point that they want and need
our weather data - both in person and via our systems.

As a relative newcomer to the SKYWARN program and the amateur community, I
sincerely hope that we can all figure out our differences and do the right
thing for all the people who count on us.

there were none after Dan for what a year and a half or more now. Lets not forget the best coordinator we had, Kevin KD4UYR which predates all of the others. He made Pinellas SKYWARN the model that NWS used through the entire section.

You really need to get off this childish ACS crap that has been preached into your head. ACS dosent control anything but the ACS program at the EOC. EM made the decsion to ask ACS Volunteers to handle the corrdination of the ham radio part of SKYWARN since ARES was disbanded. The ham radio part of skywarn belongs under ARES. Here is the MOU that the ARRL has with the NWS

I. PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to state the terms of a mutual agreement (Memorandum of Understanding) between the National Weather Service (NWS) and the American Radio Relay League, Inc. (ARRL), that will serve as a framework within which volunteers of the ARRL may coordinate their services, facilities, and equipment with NWS in support of nationwide, state, and local early weather warning and emergency communications functions. It is intended, through joint coordination and exercise of the resources of ARRL, NWS, and Federal, State and local governments, to enhance the nationwide posture of early weather warning and readiness for any conceivable weather emergency. II. RECOGNITION The National Weather Service recognizes that the ARRL is the principal organization representing the interests of more than 400,000 U.S. radio-amateurs and because of its Field Organization of trained and experienced communications experts, can be of valuable assistance in early severe
weather warning and tornado spotting. The American Radio Relay League recognizes the National Weather Service with its statutory responsibility for providing civil meteorological services for the people of the United States. These services consist of: 1. Issuing warnings and forecasts of weather and flood conditions affecting the nation's safety, welfare and economy; and, 2. Observing and reporting the weather of the U.S. and its possessions.

To perform these functions and many related, specialized weather services, NWS operates a vast network of stations of many types within the U.S.; it cooperates in the exchange of data in real time with other nations, including obtaining of weather reports from ships at sea. III. ORGANIZATION OF THE AMERICAN RADIO RELAY LEAGUE The American Radio Relay League is a noncommercial membership organization of radio amateurs, organized for the promotion of interest in Amateur Radio communication and experimentation, for the establishment of networks to provide communications in the event of disasters or other emergencies, for the advancement of the radio art and of the public welfare, for the representation of the radio amateur in legislative matters, and the maintenance of fraternalism and a high standard of conduct. A primary responsibility of the Amateur Radio Service, as established by the Federal Communications Commission, is the rendering of public service communications for the
general public, particularly in times of emergency. Using Amateur Radio operators in the amateur frequency bands, the ARRL has been serving the public, both directly and through government and relief agencies, for more than fifty years. To that end, the League created the Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) and the National Traffic System (NTS). The League's Field Organization consists of sixty-seven administrative sections managed by elected Section Managers. A Section is a League-created political boundary roughly equivalent to states (or portions thereof). The Section Manager appoints expert assistants to administer the various emergency communications and public service programs in the section. Each section has a vast cadre of volunteer appointees to perform the work of Amateur Radio at the local level, under the supervision of the Section Manager and his/her assistants. IV. ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE The National Weather Service consists of a National
Headquarters in Washington, D.C., and six regional offices in the United States: Eastern, Southern, Central, Western, Alaska, and Pacific. An NWS Public Information Office is located at Weather Service Headquarters. Fifty-two Weather Service Forecast Offices and 209 Weather Service Offices provide warnings and forecasts to the Nation. SKYWARN is the spotter program sponsored by the NWS. Radio amateurs have assisted as communicators and spotters since its inception. In areas where tornadoes and other severe weather have been know to threaten, NWS recruits volunteers, trains them in proper weather spotting procedures and accepts the volunteers' reports during watches and episodes of severe weather. By utilizing the SKYWARN volunteers, the NWS has &quot;eyes and ears&quot; throughout the affected area in conjunction with NWS sophisticated weather monitoring equipment. V. PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATION A. The American Radio Relay League agrees to encourage its volunteer Field Organization
appointees, especially the Amateur Radio Emergency Service, to contact and cooperate with Regional Weather Service Headquarters for the purpose of establishing organized SKYWARN networks with radio amateurs serving as communicators and spotters. B. ARRL further agrees to encourage its Section management teams to provide specialized communications and observation support on an as-needed basis for NWS offices in other weather emergencies such as hurricanes, snow and heavy rain storms, and other severe weather situations. C. The National Weather Service agrees to work with ARRL Section Amateur Radio Emergency Service volunteers to establish SKYWARN networks, and/or other specialized weather emergency alert and relief systems. the principle point of contact between the ARRL Section and local NWS offices is the Meteorological Services Division of the appropriate NWS Regional Office. The addresses of the Regional offices are listed below. The national contact for ARRL is the Public

Also, where was this need announced? This is the first I've heard of any need for a Skywarn coordinator. Frankly, I think Paul and Dan were doing a fantastic job before ACS 'assumed' ownership.

Guess this is a case of reading only what you want to see.
ACS DOES NOT OWN ANYTHING.

SKYWARN is a NWS program period. SKYWARN does not have anything to do with ham radio. Ham radio is used by licensed trained NWS SKYWARN Spotters to help them gather information for the NWS. NWS does not control the ham radio side of SKYWARN, and ARRL or other organizations and individuals do not control the NWS Skywarn program.

As far as before ACS. Lets see. Paul Toth was a ARRL Section emergency coordinator. Chris N4BSA was appointed Pinellas ARES EC. Since ham radio side of skywarn was under ARES per the MOU, This meant Paul and Chris had complete control of both ARES and ham radio SKYWARN. Chris moved both the ARES nets and SKYWARN over to the BSA repeater system.

This was run for a few months. Don't know why, but Paul disbanded the Pinellas ARES organization. Soon after skywarn fell into a disarray. Since ARES was no longer in Pinellas the MOU was also no longer.

Bruce...

Yes, APRS data is ingested into the AWIPS system. But it is less than real time. AWIPS refreshes the APRS data only four times per hour. On a sunny day, that is not a big deal. During a severe weather event, when the average life of a thunderstorm is only twenty minutes, that delay is significant. What's more, the ingest process is dependent on the Internet being online. Last year, during Hurricane Frances, one of the communications systems that failed at the NWS-Ruskin office was the Internet connection.

The live APRS station has served the NWS and the SKYWARN program very well since it was put on the air in August, 1998. In fact, within two hours after the station became operational, data received from two APRS Weather Stations in Seminole results in the issuance of a Severe Thunderstorm Warning and an Urban Flood Advisory. When live rainfall totals from the two stations surpassed four inches in less than an hour, a Flash Flood Warning was issued. I know this because I was at the NWS watching it all happen.

When the storm ended, KD4UYR's APRS station recorded 6.08&quot; of rainfall in less than an hour. The other station, mine, recorded 4.38&quot; in the rain bucket. The rainfall estimate from the WSR-88D Doppler radar was three inches. The Amateur Radio community could not have asked for a better demonstration for Walt Zaleski and his staff.

The technology Amateur Radio has been using to support SKYWARN at Ruskin has been focused on the articulated needs of the National Weather Service. APRS live weather data on two meters, SKYWARN spotter voice comms on UHF and HF (as needed). No de-sense, no interference. It just works and has for over seven years!

Your recollection of history and my recollection seem to have some differences, Demos. At the time I was Section Emergency Coordinator in 2002, Jack Belich-WB4PBF was the NWS recognized Pinellas Co SKYWARN Coordinator and was doing an exemplary job of it. SKYWARN ops were NEVER conducted on the &quot;BSA Repeater System&quot;. And the suggestion that ARES support the SKYWARN effort (given the ARRL had a MOU to do so with the NWS) was met with some significant vocal resistance in Pinellas County (although that was not the case in other counties in the Section).

Even after I stepped aside as SEC and John Townsley-AE4GB took that position, SKYWARN remained in the very able hands of Jack Belich and a number of trained Net Control Stations on the W4BNC Repeater System until 2004 when Dan Noah made it known he was abolishing the County Coordinator's position to turn SKYWARN over to the Emergency Management agencies in the fifteen respective counties. That is when the SKYWARN Committee was formed, you know, the one you were named to. Then, in April, after the MacDill Air Show, voila, there was a new SKYWARN Coordinator who just happened to be the ACS Radio Officer.

More recently, this same ACS Radio Officer/SKYWARN Coordinator was overheard telling everyone, on the air no less, that SKYWARN Net Control operators now needed to complete ARRL ARECC Training along with three Florida Division of Emergency Management courses mandated by the State of Florida, the same training that was being mandated for all ACS Net Controls. Demos, I wanted to check into those requirements so I went to the source, John Fleming at the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Not only was all this news to him, but, according to John, no such training requirement had ever been discussed in Tallahassee.

I wish Shawn Bennett and Nick Petro well as they spearhead the National Weather Service's efforts to take back control of THEIR program. I just hope they can overcome the personal agendas held by a handful of individuals in the CWA's two most populous counties that have held this worthwhile program hostage for the last two years.

I. PURPOSE

The purpose of this document is to state the terms of a mutual agreement
(Memorandum of Understanding) between the National Weather Service (NWS) and
the American Radio Relay League, Inc. (ARRL), that will serve as a framework
within which volunteers of the ARRL may coordinate their services,
facilities, and equipment with NWS in support of nationwide, state, and
local early weather warning and emergency communications functions. It is
intended, through joint coordination and exercise of the resources of ARRL,
NWS, and Federal, State and local governments, to enhance the nationwide
posture of early weather warning and readiness for any conceivable weather
emergency.

II. RECOGNITION

The National Weather Service recognizes that the ARRL is the principal
organization representing the interests of more than 400,000 U.S.
radio-amateurs and because of its Field Organization of trained and
experienced communications experts, can be of valuable assistance in early
severe weather warning and tornado spotting.
The American Radio Relay League recognizes the National Weather Service with
its statutory responsibility for providing civil meteorological services for
the people of the United States. These services consist of:

1. Issuing warnings and forecasts of weather and flood conditions
affecting the nation's safety, welfare and economy; and,
2. Observing and reporting the weather of the U.S. and its
possessions.

To perform these functions and many related, specialized weather services,
NWS operates a vast network of stations of many types within the U.S.; it
cooperates in the exchange of data in real time with other nations,
including obtaining of weather reports from ships at sea.

III. ORGANIZATION OF THE AMERICAN RADIO RELAY LEAGUE

The American Radio Relay League is a noncommercial membership organization
of radio amateurs, organized for the promotion of interest in Amateur Radio
communication and experimentation, for the establishment of networks to
provide communications in the event of disasters or other emergencies, for
the advancement of the radio art and of the public welfare, for the
representation of the radio amateur in legislative matters, and the
maintenance of fraternalism and a high standard of conduct. A primary
responsibility of the Amateur Radio Service, as established by the Federal
Communications Commission, is the rendering of public service communications
for the general public, particularly in times of emergency. Using Amateur
Radio operators in the amateur frequency bands, the ARRL has been serving
the public, both directly and through government and relief agencies, for
more than fifty years. To that end, the League created the Amateur Radio
Emergency Service (ARES) and the National Traffic System (NTS). The League's
Field Organization consists of sixty-seven administrative sections managed
by elected Section Managers. A Section is a League-created political
boundary roughly equivalent to states (or portions thereof). The Section
Manager appoints expert assistants to administer the various emergency
communications and public service programs in the section. Each section has
a vast cadre of volunteer appointees to perform the work of Amateur Radio at
the local level, under the supervision of the Section Manager and his/her
assistants.

IV. ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE

The National Weather Service consists of a National Headquarters in
Washington, D.C., and six regional offices in the United States: Eastern,
Southern, Central, Western, Alaska, and Pacific. An NWS Public Information
Office is located at Weather Service Headquarters. Fifty-two Weather Service
Forecast Offices and 209 Weather Service Offices provide warnings and
forecasts to the Nation.
SKYWARN is the spotter program sponsored by the NWS. Radio amateurs have
assisted as communicators and spotters since its inception. In areas where
tornadoes and other severe weather have been know to threaten, NWS recruits
volunteers, trains them in proper weather spotting procedures and accepts
the volunteers' reports during watches and episodes of severe weather. By
utilizing the SKYWARN volunteers, the NWS has &quot;eyes and ears&quot; throughout the
affected area in conjunction with NWS sophisticated weather monitoring
equipment.

V. PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATION

A. The American Radio Relay League agrees to encourage its volunteer Field
Organization appointees, especially the Amateur Radio Emergency Service, to
contact and cooperate with Regional Weather Service Headquarters for the
purpose of establishing organized SKYWARN networks with radio amateurs
serving as communicators and spotters.
B. ARRL further agrees to encourage its Section management teams to provide
specialized communications and observation support on an as-needed basis for
NWS offices in other weather emergencies such as hurricanes, snow and heavy
rain storms, and other severe weather situations.
C. The National Weather Service agrees to work with ARRL Section Amateur
Radio Emergency Service volunteers to establish SKYWARN networks, and/or
other specialized weather emergency alert and relief systems. the principle
point of contact between the ARRL Section and local NWS offices is the
Meteorological Services Division of the appropriate NWS Regional Office. The
addresses of the Regional offices are listed below. The national contact for
ARRL is the Public Service Branch, ARRL Headquarters, Newington, CT 06111.

Also, where was this need announced? This is the first I've heard of any
need for a Skywarn coordinator. Frankly, I think Paul and Dan were doing a
fantastic job before ACS 'assumed' ownership.

Guess this is a case of reading only what you want to see.
ACS DOES NOT OWN ANYTHING.

My correction: When I say 'owns' I am referring only to the amateur radio
communication and organization aspect. Everything else is out of scope of
this discussion. I should have been more specific in my wording. Also,
you didn't answer my question: Where was the need for a new Skywarn

Should organize local net control in cooperation with hams that work with Emergency Management. This method is sponsored by the State EOC. The hams that control the SKYWARN Net must complete three EM courses paid for by the state. Hams that send weather reports to the Net do not need to take the EM courses. See the West Central Florida Amateur Radio Emergency Services for more information.
In absence of a ham relationship with Emergency Management, it is up to the hams to organize the network in their county. The NWS will not tell hams how to communicate.

Has been said several times on nets and at meetings. As far as NA4AR, as of this time I would not support him in that role based on his past actions. That's my opinion only and does not reflect anyone else's ideas.

Good point!! I can shed some light on this: Neither Paul or Chris got much support from anyone when they had those positions. In fact people were too busy throwing rocks at them to be constructive. I remember hearing about a particular Metro meeting where Chris was about eaten alive... Demos, why didn't Paul and Chris get any cooperation from the same people who are running the show now??? This goes to the heart of my argument -- there is a vendetta going on against Paul in particular, and his friends by association. I ask the whole list: Why doesn't the current section leadership do anything to put a stop to this???

This is my point too. People do not like the actions taken in the past by Paul and the rest of Paul's group. There is nothing that the current or any other &quot;administration&quot; can do to change hams minds. Paul will have to do this himself, and knowing how hams hold grudges, this will not happen. In &quot;MY&quot; opinion only, as long as Paul is involved in a leadership role of any organization, we will not have a large participation of hams in that organization. This goes section wide, if not state wide

Again, if the previous section leadership got the level of cooperation he deserved, we'd be more than twice as strong now.

Same as above

I

I think it is bad from the opinion of the average ham in the county. The first thing I did when elected president of CARS was to de-emphasize CARS role in EMCOMM (with one previous agreement as an exception). I was not about to allow 'turf battles' to happen at club events. Since then, my successor has terminated all involvement by CARS in EMCOMM, for the most part. The club still supports the local EMCOMM groups, but won't get involved with either one in an official capacity. I've seen NA4AR and W4BNC extend an olive branch to ACS a number of times, I've not seen it accepted, or reciprocated.

Was that done on your own, or were you persuaded to do that? I was a strong CARS member in the past, but now it seems that all the players are PCERT members and CARS club is in name only. It's more a pcert club.

Anyways, since this is Thanksgiving, I give thanks that we can disagree. If it has to be Paul and pcert doing there own thing and the rest of the ham community doing their thing, than so be it. Thats may not be the best way to be, but it may be the only way.

Folks, I've tried to stay out of the politics here, but allow me to
clarify a few things with respect to Skywarn:

Skywarn, to the best of my knowledge, is and has always been run by the
local NWS Forecast Office with no coordination, oversight, or much
assistance from the Regional or National Headquarters. As with all NWS
programs in each Forecast Office, Skywarn is the responsibility of the
Meteorologist In Charge (MIC), and usually run by the Warning
Coordination Meterologist (WCM). The WCM, of course, can delegate the
management of the program (or, at least, the day-to-day operation as
required) to a staff meterologist, as has happened in more than a few
offices.

Two concepts that you should keep in mind with regards to Skywarn:

1. It is an NWS program, run by the NWS and whomever they seem fit
to delegate responsibility to. Skywarn Coordinators at all levels are
assigned by NWS - UNLESS, of course, they have designated someone else
to do so, as appears to be the case in Pinellas judging by this
thread. However, unless the NWS asks, it is not the job of Emergency
Management, the ARRL, ARES, RACES, or ACS to appoint ANYONE in the
Skywarn program. To do so would be analagous to the NWS appointing
ARES Emergency Coordinators.

2. Skywarn is NOT an Amateur Radio program! It is a program for
ANYONE, ham or not, who has an interest in and wishes to be trained to
report severe weather. All too often, hams think that it's about hams
only. Granted, we have rather efficient communications capabilities
that make us a natural fit for the job (especially in larger scale
events such as tropical cyclones), but the truth of the matter is that
there are countless members of Skywarn who are not hams and who simply
pick up the phone and call the local NWSFO when they spot something
meeting the reporting criteria. A wise Skywarn Coordinator not only
reaches out to the ham community - but to the rest of the community as
well. Boaters, for example, make excellent spotters in most cases.

I believe that in certain cases, NWS sometimes finds it easier to simply
pick a local ham and make that person a Skywarn Coordinator (and it's
tempting to pick an ARES EC or RACES/ACS RO here) because that person
usually has good communication with lots of other (potential) Skywarn
members. Most non-ham Skywarn members simply don't know (m)any other
Skywarn members, unless through the Coast Guard Auxiliary or the United
States Power Squadron, for example.

I've not had the time to be as involved in Skywarn here in WCF as I did
in NLI (where I was the Regional Skywarn Coordinator for the entire NYC
CWA), but if I had a working relationship with the folks at Ruskin, I
would advise them to choose someone for a County Coordinator who is NOT
the EC/RO for that County, but who *is* a Ham that knows to reach out to
everyone in the County. In any event, NWS does not &quot;organize&quot;
ARES/RACES/ACS, but DOES (and should) organize Skywarn. The major
problem? People who belong to too many programs and have a hard time
keeping them seperated. The ARRL-NWS MOU calls for cooperation and
encourages joint membership between ARES and Skywarn, not the
subordination of one program under the other. It does not, as stated
below, call for ARES to &quot;run the amateur side of Skywarn&quot;. Rather, it
encourages ARES members to participate in the Skywarn program. Nowhere
does it mention &quot;administer&quot;, &quot;coordinate&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;manage&quot;, etc.

&gt; I thought the NWS wouldn't tell Hams how to communicate or how
&gt; to organize? That is what they've been telling us directly.

&gt; NWS asked Emergency Management offices in all the NWS warning
&gt; areas to handle coordination of the NWS SKYWARN program at
&gt; there county level. This is the norm for most of the country.
&gt; Pinellas EM ask there amateur volunteers who are skywarn
&gt; spotters and several who were involved in the creation of
&gt; Pinellas ham radio skywarn to handle the radio side of the
&gt; coordination for them. EM Made that decision. At that time the
&gt; ARES program had been disbaned by the SEC at the time.. See
&gt; below

&gt; Still sounds like NWS telling us how to organize. If not NWS,
&gt; then County EM...

&gt; Wait just a minute... There always have been other
&gt; volunteers. Jack did it for a while, then Paul and
&gt; Dan were taking the baton from him when all of a
&gt; sudden ACS popped into the picture.

&gt; there were none after Dan for what a year and a half
&gt; or more now. Lets not forget the best coordinator we
&gt; had, Kevin KD4UYR which predates all of the
&gt; others. He made Pinellas SKYWARN the model that NWS
&gt; used through the entire section.

&gt; Please clarify: Who exactly is looking for a new
&gt; Skywarn coordinator? ACS/ARES or the NWS? I assume
&gt; you mean for Pinellas County or are you referring to
&gt; the Ruskin coverage area? If you mean ACS/ARES, then
&gt; why do you think ACS/ARES 'owns' Skywarn? I thought
&gt; that myth was dispelled at the meeting this
&gt; past Thursday? Again if this coordinator is an
&gt; ACS/ARES creature, then I assume you mean that that
&gt; person would report to the ACS Radio Officer. Here is
&gt; the crux of the issue for many of us. Three years ago
&gt; there was much howling and griping when it appeared
&gt; that Paul Toth was in a leadership position over
&gt; several groups. The argument against him was
&gt; that &quot;one person should not be in charge of so many
&gt; groups&quot;. So OK. What's good for the goose is good
&gt; for the gander. ACS doesn't need to be in control of
&gt; everything. The ACS leadership isn't even elected,
&gt; and has no accountability to the general amateur
&gt; population at large.

&gt; You really need to get off this childish ACS crap that
&gt; has been preached into your head. ACS dosent control
&gt; anything but the ACS program at the EOC. EM made the
&gt; decsion to ask ACS Volunteers to handle the
&gt; corrdination of the ham radio part of SKYWARN since
&gt; ARES was disbanded. The ham radio part of skywarn
&gt; belongs under ARES. Here is the MOU that the ARRL has
&gt; with the NWS

&gt; Demos, I take exception to your comment about
&gt; 'childish ACS crap'. I have eyes and ears. I've been

&gt;&gt; Demos, I've been very active in CARS since 1999. I don't ever recall
seeing you at a meeting or event. When I started in this hobby, hams with
call signs like KR4YL, K2SEC, N4BSA, K4HN, W4LGM and others were the most
friendly and helpful people I ever met. Most of them are still very active
in CARS.

&gt;&gt; PCERT has only been around for a couple of years. All decisions made
during my 2 years as CARS president were my own. I don't cotton to anyone
playing a 'behind the scenes' leadership role, while I'm in charge. You
think there are a small group of people who are influencing things in CARS.
Not so. We see what goes on around us, and make our own conclusions.

&gt;&gt; I think maybe many CARS members felt they still needed to participate in
an EMCOMM organization and decided PCERT was the better of the 2
organizations. That's my perception and opinion only.

Anyways, since this is Thanksgiving, I give thanks that we can disagree. If
it has to be Paul and pcert doing there own thing and the rest of the ham
community doing their thing, than so be it. Thats may not be the best way to
be, but it may be the only way.

&gt;&gt; Agree with you here, in part. Nice to have this discussion. You may be
surprised to find the numbers on the 'Paul and PCERT' side of the aisle are
larger than you think. When you see us, you'll find that we 'Lead by
Example'.

I sincerely hope you and everyone who's been following this thread has had a
Wonderful Thanksgiving. Give thanks for your hobby, and your friends who
share your interests. 73!

&gt;&gt; Ditto, right back at you. People do not like the actions taken in the
past and present by the ACS group and their leadership. Someone has to be
the adult here and take the first step to mend fences. It won't be easy,
and it won't come quickly, but with persistence, it will pay off for all of
us.

Again, if the previous section leadership got the level of cooperation he
deserved, we'd be more than twice as strong now.

Same as above

I

I think it is bad from the opinion of the average ham in the county. The
first thing I did when elected president of CARS was to de-emphasize CARS
role in EMCOMM (with one previous agreement as an exception). I was not
about to allow 'turf battles' to happen at club events. Since then, my
successor has terminated all involvement by CARS in EMCOMM, for the most
part. The club still supports the local EMCOMM groups, but won't get
involved with either one in an official capacity. I've seen NA4AR and W4BNC
extend an olive branch to ACS a number of times, I've not seen it accepted,
or reciprocated.

Was that done on your own, or were you persuaded to do that? I was a strong
CARS member in the past, but now it seems that all the players are PCERT
members and CARS club is in name only. It's more a pcert club.

&gt;&gt; Demos, I've been very active in CARS since 1999. I don't ever recall
seeing you at a meeting or event. When I started in this hobby, hams with
call signs like KR4YL, K2SEC, N4BSA, K4HN, W4LGM and others were the most
friendly and helpful people I ever met. Most of them are still very active
in CARS.

&gt;&gt; PCERT has only been around for a couple of years. All decisions made
during my 2 years as CARS president were my own. I don't cotton to anyone
playing a 'behind the scenes' leadership role, while I'm in charge. You
think there are a small group of people who are influencing things in CARS.
Not so. We see what goes on around us, and make our own conclusions.

&gt;&gt; I think maybe many CARS members felt they still needed to participate in
an EMCOMM organization and decided PCERT was the better of the 2
organizations. That's my perception and opinion only.

Anyways, since this is Thanksgiving, I give thanks that we can disagree. If
it has to be Paul and pcert doing there own thing and the rest of the ham
community doing their thing, than so be it. Thats may not be the best way to
be, but it may be the only way.

&gt;&gt; Agree with you here, in part. Nice to have this discussion. You may be
surprised to find the numbers on the 'Paul and PCERT' side of the aisle are
larger than you think. When you see us, you'll find that we 'Lead by
Example'.

I sincerely hope you and everyone who's been following this thread has had a
Wonderful Thanksgiving. Give thanks for your hobby, and your friends who
share your interests. 73!

73
Happy Thanksgiving

I’m in green this time

Has been said several times on nets and at meetings. As far as NA4AR, as of this time I would not support him in that role based on his past actions. That's my opinion only and does not reflect anyone else's ideas.

&gt;&gt; Too bad, because Paul has a lot to offer. Maybe it's not Paul that's the problem?
.
I wish this thread was not focusing on one individual, but the facts are it is. There are two time periods in this county. Before Paul and after Paul

Before Paul, I was very good friends with all of the hams who now are pcert members. Several of us had received our licenses around the same time. We all meet every month at the CARS meeting and we all did every public service event that came around in this county and Hillsboro. I had a very good personal relationship with Jack Belich. I spent several months working with Jack and Andrew at the St Pete Times setting up there emwin transmitter.

For the most part, life in hamdom was ok. There were the the usual rumblings that the CARS Club was running everything in the county since the ARES EC, RACES Officer, SKYWARN Coordinator, and most of the ARES positions were held by a CARS Club members. Which was true, but not by design. The club just had a bunch of new very egar hams that wanted to be involved.

Then Paul came into the scene. I was one of the first people to meet Paul. KR4YL and I Meet him at a local eatery. We discussed SKYWARN and hamdom in general. Paul had some good ideas and he sounded like a go getter and would be a good asset to the ham community. Several of us meet with Paul several times to discuss ideas of making the ham radio world better in our county.

Paul has a bad trait of if you do not agree with his idea, you must be against him. At least that how it appears to many of us. We had difference of opinions on some of his ideas. I can’t even tell you what they were anymore it’s been so long.

In a short time my friends were taking sides. I didn’t even know there were two sides. We had difference of opinions, not sides; at least that’s what I thought. Jack Belich, stop correspondence with me, never returning email, never calling me to discuss anything that he may have had problems with. My deduction was that Paul was feeding them lies about something. I have no idea what he may have been telling them since no one to this day has personally communicated with me what there problems are.

This has hurt me personally since some of the most wonderful times I have had was during the club meetings and events that we all did together.

Paul took a leadership postion in the new WCF section. Slowly his style of leadership drew tyring. The new Section manager became a puppet of Pauls. There were a couple of Paul suporters in the section who as soon as they had a difference of thought, were jumped on. They finally seen what the rest of us were saying. So many seen the light that a totally new section leadership was voted in during the next election.

All I keep hearing lately is ACS this and ACS that. ACS for the most part is non existent. It is activated only when EM needs it, usually when there is a hurricane bearing down on us, and then ACS primary job is government communications. All other times it is ARES, SKYWARN, or the local clubs that are active.

Recently NWS stated that hams in skywarn “Should organize local net control in cooperation with hams that work with Emergency Management. This method is sponsored by the State EOC” EM only has a relationship with its ACS group. We have been trying to get them to form a relationship with ARES, but because of the conflict that happened back in 92 – 93 era, they have been hesitant.

Another thing I have heard is that ARES SKYWARN are taking place on the ACS repeater. The ACS repeater is currently owned by me. I have just spent $20000 of my own money buying new equipment for the system. The sole purpose of the repeater system is for EMCOMM use. I don’t care if it’s ARES SKYWARN ACS RACES Public Service whatever.

The reason why there is a system like this is because back in the begging of SKYWARN we used the CARS repeater system. At the time it was the only system with county wide coverage since it had not only the linked 440 machines but voted receivers on 97. The problem we were facing were that club members would complain that SKYWARN was tying up the club machine when the weather was good and they as dues paying members couldn’t use it. What was happening is one part of the county had sunny great weather and in the other part we had a thunderstorm warning. We (the emcomm community) had a chance to get our own machine with the primary purpose of EMCOMM use. That’s the machine that currently has the call of W4ACS, and I am the trustee.

These are the two things that I hear that bug people. Can this be the only things that have caused my friends to go there separate ways?

It can’t be and I invite all of you that have concerns with anything to contact me and lets discuses them. I would even offer the opportunity during an ARES meeting (with the EC approval) for all including Paul to come together and discuss things. I would like to hear from all of my friends why you have gone your separate ways, and if it has anything to do with anything that Paul has told you, I want him to be there so I may defend my self with all involved.
I can only offer this on my part. I can not speak for anyone else people have problems with but I would also invite them to this meeting. This will be a civil event on my part. I would invite our new EC to be a mediator at this meeting.

&gt;&gt; Ditto, right back at you. People do not like the actions taken in the past and present by the ACS group and their leadership. Someone has to be the adult here and take the first step to mend fences. It won't be easy, and it won't come quickly, but with persistence, it will pay off for all of us.

See above

&gt;&gt; Demos, I've been very active in CARS since 1999. I don't ever recall seeing you at a meeting or event. When I started in this hobby, hams with call signs like KR4YL, K2SEC, N4BSA, K4HN, W4LGM and others were the most friendly and helpful people I ever met. Most of them are still very active in CARS.

I was a CARS member from 1992 until approx 1997 when I had to devote more time to my work.

73 and I sincerely mean what I have stated above about getting everyone together and discuss things

Maybe a sit down, hash out is in order. I am a county volunteer and as far as I know, still a member of ACS.

I like Demos, Paul, Dan, Chris, and Tom and think I can get along with most people. Since about two years ago, when I took a leadership position at work, most contact was through e-mails and a way too occasional event like the marathon. When I started lobbying the legislature in January, I was rumoured to have moved to Siberia. The law passed and took effect in July. Since then I have been laying low, watching and listening.

Maybee we need a dim-wit to all hate together. When there was a common moron, we had a focus for our dark sides, and did not squable about petty stuff.

There was a great loss in hamdom when a diplomat passed away. When Paul died, we all reacted in our own ways. Many lost a friend, some lost a confidant, some lost a best bud and pain-in-the-butt. The one thing I remember about Paul was his passion. But he could advocate something without tearing it down. I still fondly remember Chris stepping between us at a Largo City council meeting, and getting slapped across the face. Did the three of us put pox on each others houses? No. Did we disagree about minutia? Sure. But we went to the digital conferance in Orlando, the Hurricane conferances, the hamfests..... as friends. Did we all have our favorite interests, and promote them to the point of boreing each other....sure. But I never wanted anyone to step in front of a bus. Heck, I even became friends with Lee after he ripped into me at CARS meeting. We disagreed, but we all got along.

There have been mean spirted things done by individuals, and I think those INDIVIDUALS need to apoligize for the way, not the reason, they did them. Please do not banter about CARS, ACS, PCERT, or WCF as if they were the names of three headed dragons. If you are ticked off at one person, talk to, not at them. Explain your feelings, and time will help get you past the disagrement. If you are mad at Neil, or Paul, or Chris, or me, then put that into your statement. If you are mad at Neil and rag on ACS, then your ragging on me.

I have let my ARRL membership expire last year, and have not paid dues for CARS in two years or so. I still do not have a PCERT ID card. But, if I get a week night off, I would feel safe at anyone of those meetings. I can alyaws fall back to the lowest common demoninator. Complete strangers can chat on 146.52 as they walk along the Applician Trail with nothing more in common than their ham ticket.

Maybe it's time to fall back to that common demoninator that we as humans, as hams, can start off together in the same direction....together again, despite where we are standing. Call it a shotgun re-start.

Can a big meeting with no guns be held, with EVERYONE invited and welcome, to point out the new direction we can take, together? Heck, schedule it in advance and I take a day off of work to attend.

All:

I've decided to cut down out all of the other stuff, and not to use
colors... It's beginning to look to colorful around here. Also, my
apologies to the newer members if we're boring you, or the members of
the list who really don't care.

K4NIO &amp; I were talking last night, and he mentioned something that I
found very insightful. I'm going to paraphrase the conversation, but the
jist of it was that he's an ACS member. A bunch of the emails going back
and forth are stating that there are problems with ACS.. Do we have an
issue with ACS, or with a particular person ? After talking about this a
few minutes, it was decided that we could honestly say that most of us
don't honestly have a problem with the individual program. It's really
just one person that we have an issue with. Unfortunately, one person
can tarnish an otherwise fantastic program.

I have a list of questions that I think need to be answered. I think
they can only be answered by one person, and he knows who I'm talking
about, and is on this list. Demos, I want to publicly say I don't have
an issue with you, but you're not going to be able to answer the
questions that I have.

I'm with everyone else that is stating that we should all have a sit
down meeting somewhere and clear the air. This isn't just about Skywarn
guys - This battle has been all over West Central Florida.. It's torn
apart darn near every club/organization from FGCARC to CARS to Skywarn
to ARES to the WCF ARRL section.

We need to move forward. We just need to be mindful of the past, as to
not repeat our mistakes.

Chris

I sent the following on the 21st to this list in reply to Chris'
message with the subject &quot;Skywarn Discussion&quot; but it didn't go through
for some reason and I believe it is relevant, so here it is:

----------------------------------

Good idea Chris.

I find it amazing how a HOBBY can be full of all this political stuff.
I mean, come on, we are all volunteers. I could see if this was Ham
Radio Inc and everyone was trying to earn a living, but even then this
stuff would be inappropriate.

Lack of time, or my forgetful mind, has kept me from the monthly
meetings. However, the politics have kept me from trying to get
involved in anything beyond CARS and PCERT. I wonder how many other
hams, especially new ones, feel the same way and that is the reason
these programs are not doing very well.

I think everyone needs to stop arguing and go back to enjoying this
hobby. If a problem needs to be worked out, then how about we have a
directed net on some repeater that is directed by someone not involved
with the issue. Then the people involved can work out the problem.
Better yet, put together half-day event with food et al and invite
everyone to come and work this stuff out. Any voting or whatnot can
take place there. Again, someone uninvolved can moderate the thing,
maybe even get a non-ham to do it? Discussion via e-mail is
impersonal, and I never use e-mail to discuss important issues that
may involve conflict and/or emotions. Not saying that its a bad thing,
but I think problems can be solved faster when people are
face-to-face.

Or, we can just go full-out on politics, and setup a ham radio House
and Senate, heh!

I got your note and as a member of CARS I think there is to much feelings of ownership in various programs. People should not have such strong feelings that they put in writing about other members. It benefits no one to display this immaturity. KB2LUG
