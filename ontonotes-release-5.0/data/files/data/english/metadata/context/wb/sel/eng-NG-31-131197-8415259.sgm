SUBJECT:  ADDITIONS/CORRECTIONS TO THE  SURVEY

Alison reminded me that I didn't include her name or  Dan Albro's in a few of
their dances.  I'll try to remember in the  future.

A Cowboy and a Dancer is both of us so should be Metelnick and Biggs  and
Walk Back To Me is Metelnick, Biggs and Dan Albro.

I know it’s hard to get it right all the time but if you are compiling  a
survey to include the choreographers then maybe it would be an idea to make  sure
the information is correct at time of going to print.  Alison

NOTE FROM ME:  And yes, it is difficult to get everything correct  when I
personally count 20 to 25 pages of single-spaced votes each week but I  will try
harder next week.

Subject: Wednesday at the Waterin' Trough
From: Sandy  Schoenberger

I'm going to be at the Waterin' Trough in Pinellas Park  tonight and hope to
see some of you there. Thank you for your concern and  thoughts for my mother.
She was doing much better when I left. I'll be visiting  her again in three
weeks for her 99th birthday!!
*********************
NOTE FROM  ME: Please remember to vote in the weekly survey (by late Sunday
afternoon each week). Just list up to 8 of your current favorites in this
format: Dance/choreographer/level (PLEASE separate with the / )

To be added to the mailing list to receive the daily newsletter, just  send
me an e-mail with SUBSCRIBE in the subject line and I will add you. If you
ever miss a copy of the newsletter, check the website under the NEWSLETTER
button to see if I have posted anything there for you to know and you can also
read the previous day's newsletter at that link.

then be able to skip from  SUBJECT to SUBJECT.

Please add in the SUBJECT line WHERE the event or class you are talking
about is. The newsletter goes around the world and to someone in Singapore, WI  or
CA doesn't mean too much. And PLEASE remember that the subject line I'm
talking about is NOT the subject line of your e-mail but a subject line that you
actually type the words SUBJECT and FROM. If you do not type SUBJECT/FROM then
I  have to type it and fill it in and it would really, really help me if you
would  please do it before you send it to me. Thanks a bunch.

SUBJECT: EVENT DANCES  WITH VIDEOS
FROM:  ME

Just when I think Stacy can't think of anything to make the web site better
she comes up with something. She had added to the EVENT DANCES page the step
sheets and videos for many of the dances so you can quickly review some of the
ones that are usually done at events. If you ever want to have a web site
done  that won't cost you a fortune, she is a great person to talk to. We've
been  working together for quite awhile now and the web site has just gotten
better  and better and even though I can't pay her much to do it, she is always
working  to improve it and her prices are very reasonable. I don't usually
promote things  or people but I have no reservations about telling you what a great
job she has  done for all of us with the site as well as sites she has done
for dance  instructors and the special pages she has done for event reports.
Here's her  e-mail if you want to contact her:
_st ... @tampabay.rr.com_ (mailto:st ... @tampabay.rr.com) .
Here's the  link for the new addition she just finished.

SUBJECT: COUNTRY  MUSIC IN UK
FROM: JENNY _thomas.ruff ... @ntlworld.com_
(mailto:thomas.ruff ... @ntlworld.com)

I wish to endorse Graham's comments in yesterday's  newsletter. We don't have
any access to country music here in the UK except for  local radio stations
who put out weekly programmes. We don't have CMT - I bought  a DAB radio
specifically for C3 which played continuous country music but now C3  has been
withdrawn. Whenever country music is advertised on TV then you can be  sure it is
the older country music. So many people say &quot;Oh I don't like country  music&quot;
and when I ask them what they think of Alan Jackson or George Strait they  say
&quot;who?&quot; On Sky TV there are so many music channels catering for every music
taste EXCEPT COUNTRY. I'd love to put up a country music channel - boy would I
sock it to them - I'd blow their minds with Country like they never knew
existed. There's a huge untapped market in the UK.
Everyone in the US switch  on your radio 24/7 and listen to country music -
don't take it for granted -  lucky you
Cheers, Jenny

bit of a challenge  with the timing.

SUBJECT:  Review of Tim Gillis Band Weekend, Reading, PA – July 12–15, 2007
FROM: NJ  Barbara

AWESOME – in a word – I am fortunate enough to be able  to attend all 3 TGB
weekends each year and am NEVER disappointed. Tim Gillis  and his band and
staff always work continuously to make their events “the  best”. My thanks
to all of
them and to the wonderful instructors and dj’s who  helped this one go down
in history and also a big thanks for Rosie &amp;  Bruno Multari (you all know
them by
now) for putting together a  side-splitting show - all the instructors
attending Camp Grenada
as little  tykes – so much fun and laughter - as well as some spectacular
dancing
displays from Barry &amp; Dari Anne (WOW) and Mal &amp; Linda and  George &amp; Debbie.
The hardest decision for all of us was which classes to  take – the workshops
were
awesome and repeated which helped somewhat. But I  honestly wanted to be part
of
each workshop so I did a lot of class hopping  and all the rooms were in a
row –
which made that easier for me. Plus all  meals were included so we enjoyed
sharing
meals with our friends. This event  is extremely well organized, and some
great
vendors and the Reading outlet  shopping a few blocks away. Make plans for
next
summer.
My favorite  dances taught by each instructor:
PETER METELNICK – To Love Somebody, After  You, Across the Universe
Plus Peter did two beginner dances–Candi Cha by Gary  Lafferty and Jive Aces
by Alan Haywood
ROSIE MULTARI – Do It, September Needs  (from Working Girl)
DOUG &amp; JACKIE MIRANDA – Everything’s Right,  Suavecito
FORTY ARROYO – Settlin’ and All Of Me
LYNNE MARTINO – Moootown  Boogie, It’s Good To Be Us
MAX PERRY – Everyday Distraction
BARRY &amp;  DARI ANNE AMATO – Desire
MIKE &amp; DODIE SERBEN – I Loved Her First (great  music)
JOANNE BRADY – Butter Beans, But I Do
Plus Ellen Kiernan was the DJ  out by the spectacular pool during lunch
and we were able to get in a midnite  swim as the weather was terrific.
We were sorry to see it end – but have lots  of new dances to practice now.
The next weekend is Nov 9 -11 at the Fallsview  in the Catskills of NY.
Be there or be  square!

Re: The  Great Big Party June 23&amp;24,
By: Danielle St-Amour- Laval, Quebec

This has now been the  second Great Big Party I've attended and once more I
could not have been a  happier dancer!
Right on down from the organization to the minor details of  this event it
was top notch once more! Merci Adele!
The hotel was fabulous  and really good about supplying extra towels for all
the showers I needed from  dancing so much.
It was non-stop from the time we- the ever present  contingency from Quebec -
arrived. We were met and well greeted by Adele as well  as all our favourite
teachers and many of our friends. We started dancing  started shorly after our
arrival and didn't stop the entire week-end. So many  new dances to learn in
so little time!
Two of our dancers were part of the  Saturday show and I must say the group
did a really fine piece. Bravo!
The  treats this year were great. All centered around the Toy theme and I
know a few  who had the nerve to eat a pogo and follow it up with ice cream
treats. It's all  good!
Everyone laughing, dancing having a blast- what more could one want?
I would like to thank Adele and her great team of volunteers- GOOD JOB!
I know all the children will so appreciate the toys donated and a special
thanks to all who contributed.
A heartfelt thanks to all the pros who hung  out with us, danced with us and
went out of their way to make us feel at home,  and especially for all the
hard work and time it takes to come up with these  dances for us to enjoy.
Thank-you Scott for taking the time out of your  schedule to work with me.
John, submit those dances- its now a public  request! (HA! HA!)
To my friends- see you soon.
Adele- A BIG HUG!
Hope you'll all come and join in with us next year.
Danielle  :)

SUBJECT: Return of  Commissioner Sue Gordon

FROM: Sue Gordon

Friday July 13th was a sellout crowd for Fraternal Order of Eagles at  Sleepy
Hollow, NY (aka Gotham City). With Alan Kohn at the helm as DJ, the  floor
filled up with nearly 61 dancers that took two lessons from Sue Gordon  who
came back teaching (on a cane no less) after a long absence due to hip
surgery. FOE officials and members have been so pleased with our event that
in August we will be there every Friday of the month. There was even a
table of FOE members' wives among the dancers that took the lessons.
Our  next dance is July 20 with Sue teaching. The following Friday July 27 -
29  we will be at Pocono Manor, PA for our All American Dance Weekend.

FROM: The US Executive Linedance Evaluation and Simplification  Service

SUBJECT: WE ARE HERE TO STOP THE MADNESS

As director of the US Executive Linedance Evaluation  and Simplification
Service (U.S.E.L.E.S.S), it has been brought to my attention  that there just too
many new dances being introduced to the line dance  community. There is also
the question of dance levels.
First, I will address  the matter of the excessive number of new routines.
Hence forward all new  choreography must be approved through this office.
There will only be 5000  older dances, which will be selected by this office
and all other dances will be  banned. A new dance will only be approved to
fill a slot vacated by one of the  older dances.
The older dances will have a maturation date (established by  this office at
our discretion), and will be dropped from the approved list when  it reaches
that date. Anyone found teaching or dancing to the dropped routines  will have
their CD’s and step sheets confiscated by the Line Dance Police from  the
offices of N.N.U.T.S (Nothing New Under This System), and their CD players  will
be glued shut with super glue.
Further more, the only approved music  will be Country .
All Rock, classic or otherwise, Jazz, Rumba, Salsa, Hip  Hop, Big Band,
Samba, any Latin or Caribbean (or any other genre of music this  office deems
unsatisfactory) shall be banned from Line Dancing, and choreography  of same.
All instructors and DJ’s will obtain approved step sheets and  Country CD’s
from this office at their expense.
Next, this office will  hereby dispense with the terms, beginner,
intermediate, advanced, and the new  dance levels will be as follows:
Level 1 (being able to walk)
Level 2  (being able to walk and chew gum)
Level 3 (walks and vines)
Level 4  (walks, vines, and shuffles)
Level 5 (walks, vines, shuffles, ¼  turn)
Level 6 (walks, vines, shuffles, ¼ turn, ½ turn)
Level 7 (walks,  vines, shuffles, ¼ turn, ½ turn, coaster step)
Level 8 (walks, vines,  shuffles, ¼ turn, ½ turn, coaster step, cha cha)
Level 9 (any combination of  the preceding levels)
Level 10 (shall be determined as this office sees fit  at that particular
moment).
Any other steps or combination of steps or any  new steps not approved by
U.S.E.L.E.S.S shall be considered a direct violation  of the edicts laid down by
this office, and the offender shall receive a visit  from the Line Dance
Police.
Only 32 count music will be used, any other count  must be approved by this
office. (I can only say, “Fat chance!”.)
In  conclusion let me say that anyone, be it student, dancer,  instructor,
choreographer, or DJ, who violates the above rules, (and any we  make up
along the way) will be visited by the officers of N.N.U.T.S and their  AARP
membership shall rendered invalid.
There will be further directives  issued at a later date on the regulation of
2 step, EC/WC swing, waltz,  schottische, and miscellaneous couples dances.
Thank you and happy  dancing,
S. Tag Nant, Director of US Executive Linedance Evaluation and
Simplification Service
Authors note: It is up to the instructor as to what  dances to teach their
students. My wife and I, as instructors and sometime  choreographers, understand
it takes quite a bit of time to sort through the  hundreds of new routines
that are produced each month. Most certainly it can be  mind boggling, however,
this is your job and if you can’t stand the heat get out  of the kitchen.
Going back and reviving older dances is a great idea, as there  are some that will
never pass to line dance heaven, but if this sport is to  survive it must
evolve. There is so much really good music being produced today,  it would truly
be a shame to limit a choreographer to just one type, or just one  speed. If
an instructor is having brain fade from trying to sort through the  myriad of
dances available, one cannot go wrong by choosing from the masters in  this
sport. John Robinson, Peter Metelnick, Max Perry, Kathy Hunyadi, Alison  Biggs,
Michele Burton, Maggie Gallager, Rachel McEnaney, Michael Barr, Junior  Willis,
Robbie McGowan Hickie, Neville Fitzgerald, Jo Thompson, Rob Fowler,  Jamie
Marshall or young guns like Scott Blevins or Guyton Mundy, and lets not  forget
the most famous of all, &quot;Unknown”. I know I have left out many great
choreographers and I apologize if I have insulted anyone by the omission of  their
names, these are just a few off the top of my head as examples.
Instead of complaining about the volume of new dances and the music being
played, why not choose what you like and cut foot loose?!
After all, it is  YOUR RIGHT to choose, let’s not see someone set up a
governing body to decide  for you.
Jay and Peggy Steelman
