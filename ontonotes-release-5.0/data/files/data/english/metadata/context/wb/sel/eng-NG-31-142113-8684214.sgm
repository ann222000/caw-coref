ollowing the launch of the Intel-powered classmate PC, developed at
the Platform Definition Center in Cairo, Intel and Deputy President
Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka of the Republic of South Africa joined by the
Gauteng Department of Education MEC Angie Motshekga announced the
implementation of an innovative mobile e-learning program, as part of
a holistic corporate social responsibility initiative in South Africa.

A township school in Mabopane, Gauteng, South Africa will take the
first tentative steps into this program. For other wifi programs and

The Abel T Motshoane High School in Mabopane is the site of a pilot
project for the Intel-powered classmate PC mobile e-learning solution,
a collaborative initiative between the Gauteng Department of Education
and key industry players. This will be the first deployment of a
mobile e-learning environment in South Africa using the classmate PC
as well as the first school in the country to make use of the new
WiMAX wireless broadband access technology.

The Intel-powered classmate PC, designed by Intel Egypt's Platform
Definition Center in Cairo, offers a complete solution with integrated
software and hardware, delivering an end-to-end solution for education
involving students, parents, teachers and schools in a student-
friendly form. The product is set to enhance students' learning
experience at an affordable price with minimal IT infrastructure.

'We are thrilled to see Egyptian innovations implemented across
different nations. Last year we launched similar initiatives at a
girl's school in Nigeria and have started to see the benefits that
have transpired to students,' said Khaled Al Elamrawi, General
Manager, Intel Egypt, LEVANT and North Africa.

Elamrawi added that the Intel-powered classmate PC was part of the
company's bid to provide technology to the next billion users as part
of the Intel World Ahead program. A team of ethnographers had
conducted extensive research on the needs of the underdeveloped
markets and concluded that in order to provide connectivity to the
next billion citizens, affordable tailored IT solution had to be made
available to remote communities. Business in AFrica and technology in

Two Grade 8 classes of the Abel T Motshoane High School, which serves
a total of about 1000 students, will receive specially designed
classmate PCs, providing students and teachers with access to
technology in an effort to improve the education process and enhance
the skills of learners. The classmate PCs are completely mobile units
that that are capable of networking wirelessly both with the school's
network infrastructure as well as with the Internet via WiMAX,
providing students and teachers with access to a rich set of tools for
enhanced learning.

WiMAX is expected to enable true broadband speeds over wireless
networks at a cost point to enable mass market adoption. It is the
only wireless standard today that has the ability to deliver true
broadband speeds and help make the vision of pervasive connectivity a
reality. Intel and Telkom signed a WiMAX Carrier Trial Agreement in
2005 and have since collaborated on the WiMAX trial and evaluation.
Telkom is providing a 802.16d WiMAX link to the school which offers a
speed of 512 Kbit/s Downlink and 256 Kbit/s uplink.

The Gauteng Department of Education will appoint and place up to 1000
Learners and Interns over a three year period. Fifty young IT people
across the Province have been given an opportunity to be part of this
ground breaking programme by being offered internships up to now.
These young people will provide IT support to Abel T Motshoane High
School, already seven of them have been allocated to the school.

The key to a collaborative Corporate Social Responsibility program is
to take a holistic approach. Instead of a single company trying to
shoulder the responsibility alone, the collaborative approach sees a
group of companies, each able to donate something of value, working in
conjunction with the government in order to create a solution that
fits into the government's plans for education as well as meets the
needs of the community as a whole. The learnings from this pilot will
be used to scale the solution more broadly in an effort to support the
government in its drive to bridge the digital divide through better
education for all.
