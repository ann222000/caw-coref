Incredible.  The insulting of the fan base continues.  People were actually
downloading mp3s!  Go figure!

http://www.dead.net/features/tapers-section/august-27-september-2-200...

&quot;I undertook the Taper's Section last November with a pretty simple vision:
to have fun providing folks a regular opportunity to hear vault material
that kept their interest in Grateful Dead music fresh.
&quot;Recently, I and others that work on dead.net became aware that certain fans
had been regularly downloading the tracks offered in the Taper Section. From
the very beginning, this program has always been intended to be a &quot;for
streaming only&quot; service. Downloading was never announced, described or
promoted in any manner. The situation that developed over the past months is
very different than my original plan.

Where we're at today requires us to step back, gather some information, do
some thinking and get back to you. In the meantime, we ask that you all
realize that dead.net's and GDP's commitment to the Dead Head community is
unchanged. We're very excited to be hard at work with Rhino on a number of
very cool releases and programs that you'll be hearing about soon. Please
bear with us until then.

See you next week,
David&quot;

This again sounds like some degree of CYA. I mean, if nobody intended
download, then why did the link names always include the file size?
(Never mind the more obvious question of why they were downloadable to
begin with.)

Sounds like Rhino got cold feet (or someone higher up finally clued in
to what was going on) and now they have to do some official
backtracking. Fine, whatever. The reality of the site's use was clear
from the start in the comments. Especially given the source and how
crap-free he has been in the past, I just can't take this at face
value. I know that sentence sounds backwards, but you get the point.

Yeah, a disappointing response.  Better for him to just say nothing.

And I really like the &quot;certain fans&quot; phrase.  Which ones?  The
assholes?  The thieves?  The ones with an IQ above 20 who figured
&quot;shit, here's the mp3 right in front off my face, I might as well
download it?&quot;

My guess is that DL made the mp3s available on purpose (suspecting
that eventually they might be made unavailable or else knowing that
they'd eventually be made unavailable) and now he's just doing his job
and toeing the line.  It's also possible that he's got his dream of
working with all the music and nothing else matters and never did.  Or
somewhere in between.

I *really* enjoyed his commentary on the music over all these past
weeks.  I definitely purchased the 12/31/76 and 2/19/71 sets because
of the good feelings brought on by the taper section - both his
commentary and the ability to download.  Hell, I've got 37 hours of
taper section tunes on my mp3 player, and that's less than half of
what was available from the site.

Stopping the lossless sbd downloads from the archive is one thing,
stopping 192k mp3 downloads of show snippets (some reaslly  is
another.  You can still get all the sbds in vbr mp3 from the archive -
It's not vbr 0, it's something less (how do you determine *which* vrbr
level was used to encode a file?), so I'll just go back to that for my
easy, ready-to-go mp3s.  I won't be buying any more official dead
stuff, I don't need it, and I only want to buy it from a company
that's smart enough and nice enough to keep something as minor as 192k
mp3s available.

Yea, streaming can &quot;break up&quot; if traffic is heavy or bandwidth limited.
So you may or may not get to really hear the music.

If you can avoid those two issues, though, you can record streams -

Exactly... What, really, is the difference if I take the music and
listen to it where I want to? I was under the impression this is stuff
that, generally, has a certain musical value but isn't stuff that
would be otherwise released officialy? Not in full, at least.

David L's take here, forced to toe the company line or not, is really
stupid. It's almost meaningless, given how slow Rhino's taking these
releases but I have enough GD music, officially released or not, that
I really don't need to be buying anymore. An attiude like this makes a
lot LESS likely to buy any more GD/related items from Rhino in the
future.

I'm not knocking anything just to knock it.  I'm trying to find out if
there's *anything* that's really known about the data content of the
stream once it gets to the recorder on the local machine.  The
difference is that mp3s are a known quantity.  You know what a vbr 0
mp3 is, you know what a 192k mp3 is.  With streaming you don't know -
or at least I don't know.  I don't know what sort of file it's
starting from.  I don't know what their software is doing to that
original file to get it in a form to stream.  I don't know what's
happening on their network, on the internet, or on my network that
might affect the stream.  I don't know what the software on my machine
is doing to the stream it's getting to play it.  *Then* it gets
recorded.

Again, I'm not knocking this as a quality choice for anyone!

&quot;I'll just record the stream&quot; is not the same as the 192k mp3s there
we were lucky enough to be able to download for this recent period of
months.

The reality of the situation is this:  when Rhino and the band decided
to no longer permit SBDs to be downloaded from the archive, they
thought that would be sufficient to protect their own economic
interests in selling items from the Vault.  They figured that folks
would care that the pm3s and streams were compressed files of inferior
audio quality, but the Rhino releases would have exquisite sound
quality.

Thing is, they were wrong.

Most music consumers really don't seem to give a crap about the sound
quality of what they're listening to, and an mp3 is just as fine for
their music listening purposes as a WAV file of a multitrack master.
This might especially be true of Deadheads, who have nostalgia for the
crappy sound quality audience recordings that they came of age
listening to &quot;back in the day.&quot;  It appears most Deadheads just don't
care about sound quality to nearly the extent that Rhino would hope
they did.

So Rhino has found that the existence of downloadable mp3s is having
nearly as much negative effect on their sales potential as making
uncompressed SBDs available did.  So they stopped their employee,
Lemieux, from allowing downloads.  I wouldn't be surprised if mp3s
disappear from the archive soon, too.

But one can both care very much about sound quality and be able to

If / when they release something awesome, I'll probably come around on
things.  But I'll be waiting for *great* stuff, from now on.  12/31/76
and 2/19/71 aren't really all that great.  I'll be playing many of the
Dick's Picks a lot before I pick up either of those two recent Rhino
release, again.  I'm not really angry - I wasn't angry at all when the
sbds went away - there really wasn't anything there that I couldn't
get myself from torrenting.  With the taper section mp3s, I'm feeling
a definite sense of loss because I was really digging the new stuff
available on Mondays - it felt like a dialogue with DL, it was a
learning experience.  It was a little bit of &quot;Appointment Dead&quot; for
me.  Something I wish that Rhina had kept going.

I think this case is really different than the lossless sbds going
away.  I don't know how Rhino could possibly know that the 192k mp3s
are affecting their sales.

Having access to mp3s has *never* caused me to buy fewer official
releases.  In fact, it leads to more purchases because I can get to
know a show and/or an era that I wouldn't otherwise have heard.

&gt; described or promoted in any manner. The situation that developed over the
&gt; past months is very different than my original plan.

&gt; Where we're at today requires us to step back, gather some information, do
&gt; some thinking and get back to you. In the meantime, we ask that you all
&gt; realize that dead.net's and GDP's commitment to the Dead Head community is
&gt; unchanged. We're very excited to be hard at work with Rhino on a number of
&gt; very cool releases and programs that you'll be hearing about soon. Please
&gt; bear with us until then.

&gt; See you next week,

I agree that they aren't that compelling, at least not 2/19/71 (and
although 12/31/76 is a great show, many already had it in excellent
quality).

What I'd like to know, though, is what *great* stuff they've got left.

There is 8/27/72, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Dead eventually
let go of their reservations about out of tune vocals and let that
out.

Aside from that, I don't think there are many remaining multitracks
from the pre-Brent years.  There may be some dragon-slaying Dark
Stars, Other Ones and Playin's in the two-tracks, but judging from
Deadbase most of them seem to be out there by now.  The recent taper's
section entries have made the point repeatedly that many early Brent
shows are not in the vault (also true of most of the final Keith and
Donna shows), and many others are only there in flawed mixes.  And I
doubt much from after that era will make Deadheads whip out their
credit cards en masse.

Any thoughts?

Isn't like all (or at the very least most) of Europe '72 in the vault and
multitrack? And whatever remains from 10/74 that hasn't been released... I
don't know how quickly I would be interested in buying any of that, but I
would guess that I would be getting around at some point to purchasing
multitrack releases of any number of different Europe '72 shows...

And beyond that, if there is anything in better quality in the vault than
what is in circulation from say 78 or before, multitrack or not, I would be
interested in quite a bit of that...

Yes, it is true, there are many folks like you.  But it is a continual
source of amazement to me that so few folks seem to care about audio
quality.  You are a member of a distinct minority today.  Just pick up
any audophile magazine in your local bookstore, I guarantee you will
find at least one article about this being the &quot;dark ages&quot; for audio--
the popularity of mp3 puzzles the hell out of folks who are willing to
do things like spend $10,000 for an amp/pre-amp..

It's a strange thing, but most folks just don't seem to take music
seriously enough to care about the difference in audio quality between
a &quot;good&quot; mp3 and a WAV file.  And it has really caught the music
industry by surprise.  They traditionally have spent boatloads of
money to make stuff sound only incrementally better.  It has been a
revelation that a large portion of their customer base is as happy
with mp3s as an uncompressed file.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That seems like a reasonable response.  That's pretty much mine, too.
After all, fi one wishes to go to a little bit of effort, pretty much
anything that one wants can be found in whatever quality one wants to
find it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and 2/19/71 aren't really all that great.  I'll be playing many of the
&gt; Dick's Picks a lot before I pick up either of those two recent Rhino
&gt; release, again.  I'm not really angry - I wasn't angry at all when the
&gt; sbds went away - there really wasn't anything there that I couldn't
&gt; get myself from torrenting.  With the taper section mp3s, I'm feeling
&gt; a definite sense of loss because I was really digging the new stuff
&gt; available on Mondays - it felt like a dialogue with DL, it was a
&gt; learning experience.  It was a little bit of &quot;Appointment Dead&quot; for
&gt; me.  Something I wish that Rhino had kept going.
">

Interesting.  They actually had a good marketing tool for folks like
you, and they threw it away.  Not a good move.  The industry is
institutionally paranoid now, they see their profits evaportaing, and
all of their intellectual property illegally residing on millions of
kids' computers.  They don't know how to stop the bleeding, and they
keep making mistake after mistake.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think this case is really different than the lossless sbds going
&gt; away.  I don't know how Rhino could possibly know that the 192k mp3s
&gt; are affecting their sales.
">

It's more fear than actual knowledge.   they see the proliferation of
iPods, and they see that the first thing a lot of folks do with their
newly purchased CDs is to compress them and put them onto their
iPods.  So the logic is that iif an mp3 is already available, why is
someone going to buy the CD and go to the trouble to upload it to the
iPod?  And for many folks, they are apparently right.  For folks like
you, who want both the ability to have uncompressed files for a high
quality listening environment, as well as mp3s for sundry iPod-like
purposes, or folks like me, who have no interest at all in compressed
file formats, their decision is irrational.  But again, we are a
distinct minority these days amongst what has tradtitioinally be the
major music buying demographic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Having access to mp3s has *never* caused me to buy fewer official
&gt; releases.  In fact, it leads to more purchases because I can get to
&gt; know a show and/or an era that I wouldn't otherwise have heard.

&gt; &gt; Better get all the compressed
&gt; &gt; files as you can from the archive, they may be going soon.

&gt; Are you being snotty, here?
">

No, I'm totally serious.  They really might be going, and soon.  If
you want them, grab them.  The owners of the Vault most certainly have
the right, and ability, to take them all away if they decide they are
a threat to the bottom line.  I sure wish I had downloaded hundreds of
more soundboards while I had access to things like tol and the
Archive .  Hell, if I really believed they were going away from all
online sources, I probably would have downloaded EVERYTHING between
1966-1979 and 1989-1991, and at least several dozen more shows from
the 80s.

i already have a ton of high quality shows from Europe '72, I can't
imaging that I'd be wanting tons more of that.  The Winterland '73
stuff, yeah I would have liked that a lot and jumped all over it.  The
model they should be following is to release more stuff like the NYC
Academy of Musc release (3/25-28/72).  These were shows that were
primarily available only in the most horrendous audience recordings,
if at all.  If there are more gems like that hiding in the vault,
these ought to be the first ones they focus on releasing.

It's really odd that they don't seem to realize that.  Their recent
releases are really perplexing.  As much as I love 12/31/76, for
instance, I'm just not inclined to spend the buck when the only real
upgrade is the previously-unavailable (in SBD quality) encores.

&gt;&gt; get myself from torrenting.  With the taper section mp3s, I'm feeling
&gt;&gt; a definite sense of loss because I was really digging the new stuff
&gt;&gt; available on Mondays - it felt like a dialogue with DL, it was a
&gt;&gt; learning experience.  It was a little bit of &quot;Appointment Dead&quot; for
&gt;&gt; me.  Something I wish that Rhino had kept going.

&gt;Interesting.  They actually had a good marketing tool for folks like
&gt;you, and they threw it away.  Not a good move.  The industry is
&gt;institutionally paranoid now, they see their profits evaportaing, and
&gt;all of their intellectual property illegally residing on millions of
&gt;kids' computers.  They don't know how to stop the bleeding, and they
&gt;keep making mistake after mistake.

&gt;&gt; I think this case is really different than the lossless sbds going
&gt;&gt; away.  I don't know how Rhino could possibly know that the 192k mp3s
&gt;&gt; are affecting their sales.

&gt;It's more fear than actual knowledge.   they see the proliferation of
&gt;iPods, and they see that the first thing a lot of folks do with their
&gt;newly purchased CDs is to compress them and put them onto their
&gt;iPods.  So the logic is that iif an mp3 is already available, why is
&gt;someone going to buy the CD and go to the trouble to upload it to the
&gt;iPod?  And for many folks, they are apparently right.  For folks like
&gt;you, who want both the ability to have uncompressed files for a high
&gt;quality listening environment, as well as mp3s for sundry iPod-like
&gt;purposes, or folks like me, who have no interest at all in compressed
&gt;file formats, their decision is irrational.  But again, we are a
&gt;distinct minority these days amongst what has tradtitioinally be the
&gt;major music buying demographic.

&gt;&gt; Having access to mp3s has *never* caused me to buy fewer official
&gt;&gt; releases.  In fact, it leads to more purchases because I can get to
&gt;&gt; know a show and/or an era that I wouldn't otherwise have heard.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Better get all the compressed
&gt;&gt; &gt; files as you can from the archive, they may be going soon.

&gt;&gt; Are you being snotty, here?

&gt;No, I'm totally serious.  They really might be going, and soon.  If
&gt;you want them, grab them.  The owners of the Vault most certainly have
&gt;the right, and ability, to take them all away if they decide they are
&gt;a threat to the bottom line.  I sure wish I had downloaded hundreds of
&gt;more soundboards while I had access to things like tol and the
&gt;Archive .  Hell, if I really believed they were going away from all
&gt;online sources, I probably would have downloaded EVERYTHING between
&gt;1966-1979 and 1989-1991, and at least several dozen more shows from
&gt;the 80s.

&gt;Peace,
&gt;Neil X.

There's no doubt that this decision, presumably made by Rhino, makes
little apparent sense. I'm just wondering, though, if it ultimately
comes down to copyright protection. It may be that their lawyers
advised them that if they allow ANY of the stuff from the vaults,
regardless of format, to be downloaded without charge they could
forfeit their copyright protection for all of it. In other words, once
you let it out for free you can't stop someone from downloading,
reproducing and selling it. Just a thought, but I don't know enough
about how copyright works to be sure.

&gt;&gt; &gt; My guess is that DL made the mp3s available on purpose (suspecting
&gt;&gt; &gt; that eventually they might be made unavailable or else knowing that
&gt;&gt; &gt; they'd eventually be made unavailable) and now he's just doing his job
&gt;&gt; &gt; and toeing the line.  It's also possible that he's got his dream of
&gt;&gt; &gt; working with all the music and nothing else matters and never did.  Or
&gt;&gt; &gt; somewhere in between.

&gt;&gt; The reality of the situation is this:  when Rhino and the band decided
&gt;&gt; to no longer permit SBDs to be downloaded from the archive, they
&gt;&gt; thought that would be sufficient to protect their own economic
&gt;&gt; interests in selling items from the Vault.  They figured that folks
&gt;&gt; would care that the pm3s and streams were compressed files of inferior
&gt;&gt; audio quality, but the Rhino releases would have exquisite sound
&gt;&gt; quality.

&gt;&gt; Thing is, they were wrong.

&gt;&gt; Most music consumers really don't seem to give a crap about the sound
&gt;&gt; quality of what they're listening to, and an mp3 is just as fine for
&gt;&gt; their music listening purposes as a WAV file of a multitrack master.
&gt;&gt; This might especially be true of Deadheads, who have nostalgia for the
&gt;&gt; crappy sound quality audience recordings that they came of age
&gt;&gt; listening to &quot;back in the day.&quot;  It appears most Deadheads just don't
&gt;&gt; care about sound quality to nearly the extent that Rhino would hope
&gt;&gt; they did.

&gt;&gt; So Rhino has found that the existence of downloadable mp3s is having
&gt;&gt; nearly as much negative effect on their sales potential as making
&gt;&gt; uncompressed SBDs available did.  So they stopped their employee,
&gt;&gt; Lemieux, from allowing downloads.  I wouldn't be surprised if mp3s
&gt;&gt; disappear from the archive soon, too.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You can still get all the sbds in vbr mp3 from the archive -
&gt;&gt; &gt; It's not vbr 0, it's something less (how do you determine *which* vrbr
&gt;&gt; &gt; level was used to encode a file?), so I'll just go back to that for my
&gt;&gt; &gt; easy, ready-to-go mp3s.  I won't be buying any more official dead
&gt;&gt; &gt; stuff, I don't need it, and I only want to buy it from a company
&gt;&gt; &gt; that's smart enough and nice enough to keep something as minor as 192k
&gt;&gt; &gt; mp3s available.

&gt;&gt; I don't really understand why this business decision should make folks
&gt;&gt; angry enough not to buy their products.  They were nice enough to make
&gt;&gt; the stuff available for free for years.  They never promised to do it
&gt;&gt; forever.  But hey, if cutting off your nose to spite your face is what
&gt;&gt; rocks your boat, more power to you.  Better get all the compressed
&gt;&gt; files as you can from the archive, they may be going soon.

&gt;Fuck all of you ungrateful, greedy, entitled whiners. It's their

&gt;And you have the right to not buy it. It seems eminently fair to me

I get your point and generally agree, but I don't if it's really a
fair statement in this case. Most of us agree that the Dead and
whoever else owns the rights to the music can do what they want with
it. But the question is not whether they can restrict the
dissemination of their music but whether they should. In this case, it
just doesn't seem to make much sense.

No, that's not it.  Copyright is considered absolute, it's not like a
trademark which can slip into common usage if you aren't careful
(which is why the people at Coca-Cola get very upset if people refer
to generic cola as &quot;Coke.&quot;).  Once you copyright a work you own the
copyright as long as it's term is valid (the term seems to change
frequently, basically whenever Disney is about to have Mickey Mouse
fall into the public domain expect an extension).  Even if people
widely copy your work and you do nothing about it you can assert
copyright protection whenever you want.  Of course, in today's
environment your ability to enforce that copyright may be a little
trouble...

I hope you're not lumping all those who wish the mp3s were still

I'm not saying that I'm owed anything, I'm not saying they don't have

I think there's a reasonable middle ground (not that I'm necessarily

and feeling a sense of entitlement to them forever.

Assuming there's no copyright / royalty issue, this whole thing has
been about pulling 192k mp3s - and wondering how in the world having
those 192k mp3s available to people could possibly hurt their sales.

After reading some of the responses, here - the people who are

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Clueless...  If they think we are unable to record a stream then they
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; might as well just throw their computers out the window.

&gt; &gt;&gt; But - recorded streams really aren't *anything*, are they?  I mean, I
&gt; &gt;&gt; suppose they're listenable, but there's no bit for bit correspondence
&gt; &gt;&gt; with an original file, is there?  I really don't know - I'm asking.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Aren't they subject to whatever winds are blowing out on the internet,
&gt; &gt;&gt; on your own network, on the source network?  How robust are streaming
&gt; &gt;&gt; protocols?  I mean, file downloads are bit for bit, are there any
&gt; &gt;&gt; quality standards for streaming protocols?  Thanks for any explanation
&gt; &gt;&gt; from you computer folks out there . . .

&gt; &gt;Hmmm.  Some folks might maintain that recording a stream is technically an
&gt; &gt;analog process, even though the end result is a digital file.

&gt; Sure...
">

there are ways to digitally capture a stream..  even if it 'breaks up'
in transmission the pieces will be put together and you'll wind up with
an exact copy of what was sent minus the copy protection bull.. look
around the internet.. you'll find what you seek if you want it bad
enough.

the 'new' stream is a 96K wma (roughly equal to a 128K mp3, i.e. kinda
OK at times borderline lousy at others depending on the source)..
haven't checked the quick time feed yet.. significantly lower quality
than the 192K mp3s.

&gt; &gt; useful for many listening situations.  One person can find both

&gt; Yes, it is true, there are many folks like you.  But it is a continual
&gt; source of amazement to me that so few folks seem to care about audio
&gt; quality.  You are a member of a distinct minority today.  Just pick up
&gt; any audophile magazine in your local bookstore, I guarantee you will
&gt; find at least one article about this being the &quot;dark ages&quot; for audio--
&gt; the popularity of mp3 puzzles the hell out of folks who are willing to
&gt; do things like spend $10,000 for an amp/pre-amp..

&gt; It's a strange thing, but most folks just don't seem to take music
&gt; seriously enough to care about the difference in audio quality between
&gt; a &quot;good&quot; mp3 and a WAV file.  And it has really caught the music
&gt; industry by surprise.  They traditionally have spent boatloads of
&gt; money to make stuff sound only incrementally better.  It has been a
&gt; revelation that a large portion of their customer base is as happy
&gt; with mp3s as an uncompressed file.

&gt; &gt; If / when they release something awesome, I'll probably come around on
&gt; &gt; things.  But I'll be waiting for *great* stuff, from now on.

&gt; That seems like a reasonable response.  That's pretty much mine, too.
&gt; After all, fi one wishes to go to a little bit of effort, pretty much
&gt; anything that one wants can be found in whatever quality one wants to
&gt; find it.

&gt; &gt; and 2/19/71 aren't really all that great.  I'll be playing many of the
&gt; &gt; Dick's Picks a lot before I pick up either of those two recent Rhino
&gt; &gt; release, again.  I'm not really angry - I wasn't angry at all when the
&gt; &gt; sbds went away - there really wasn't anything there that I couldn't
&gt; &gt; get myself from torrenting.  With the taper section mp3s, I'm feeling
&gt; &gt; a definite sense of loss because I was really digging the new stuff
&gt; &gt; available on Mondays - it felt like a dialogue with DL, it was a
&gt; &gt; learning experience.  It was a little bit of &quot;Appointment Dead&quot; for
&gt; &gt; me.  Something I wish that Rhino had kept going.

&gt; Interesting.  They actually had a good marketing tool for folks like
&gt; you, and they threw it away.  Not a good move.  The industry is
&gt; institutionally paranoid now, they see their profits evaportaing, and
&gt; all of their intellectual property illegally residing on millions of
&gt; kids' computers.  They don't know how to stop the bleeding, and they
&gt; keep making mistake after mistake.

&gt; &gt; I think this case is really different than the lossless sbds going
&gt; &gt; away.  I don't know how Rhino could possibly know that the 192k mp3s
&gt; &gt; are affecting their sales.

&gt; It's more fear than actual knowledge.   they see the proliferation of
&gt; iPods, and they see that the first thing a lot of folks do with their
&gt; newly purchased CDs is to compress them and put them onto their
&gt; iPods.  So the logic is that iif an mp3 is already available, why is
&gt; someone going to buy the CD and go to the trouble to upload it to the
&gt; iPod?  And for many folks, they are apparently right.  For folks like
&gt; you, who want both the ability to have uncompressed files for a high
&gt; quality listening environment, as well as mp3s for sundry iPod-like
&gt; purposes, or folks like me, who have no interest at all in compressed
&gt; file formats, their decision is irrational.  But again, we are a
&gt; distinct minority these days amongst what has tradtitioinally be the
&gt; major music buying demographic.

&gt; &gt; Having access to mp3s has *never* caused me to buy fewer official
&gt; &gt; releases.  In fact, it leads to more purchases because I can get to
&gt; &gt; know a show and/or an era that I wouldn't otherwise have heard.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Better get all the compressed
&gt; &gt; &gt; files as you can from the archive, they may be going soon.

&gt; &gt; Are you being snotty, here?

&gt; No, I'm totally serious.  They really might be going, and soon.  If
&gt; you want them, grab them.  The owners of the Vault most certainly have
&gt; the right, and ability, to take them all away if they decide they are
&gt; a threat to the bottom line.  I sure wish I had downloaded hundreds of
&gt; more soundboards while I had access to things like tol and the
&gt; Archive .  Hell, if I really believed they were going away from all
&gt; online sources, I probably would have downloaded EVERYTHING between
&gt; 1966-1979 and 1989-1991, and at least several dozen more shows from
&gt; the 80s.

&gt; Peace,
&gt; Neil X.

Hell, we should all be grabbing everything anyway.and David should be
thanked for adding to the pool. Trading is not going to die unless we
allow it to.

BTW (for DG's benefit) if you or I want to sing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; at

Strange as it seems, that's actually wrong.  A few years back, ASCAP
threatened to go after the girl scouts, among other organizations, for
singing copyrighted songs around the campfire.  This is a nonprofit
organization, no profit involved, yet copyright law still applies.
ASCAP ended up taking such a PR beating that they stopped asking for
these payments, and reimbursed the girl scout troops that had paid
them.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My guess is that DL made the mp3s available on purpose (suspecting

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they'd eventually be made unavailable) and now he's just doing his job
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and toeing the line.  It's also possible that he's got his dream of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; working with all the music and nothing else matters and never did.  Or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; somewhere in between.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The reality of the situation is this:  when Rhino and the band decided
&gt; &gt;&gt; to no longer permit SBDs to be downloaded from the archive, they
&gt; &gt;&gt; thought that would be sufficient to protect their own economic
&gt; &gt;&gt; interests in selling items from the Vault.  They figured that folks
&gt; &gt;&gt; would care that the pm3s and streams were compressed files of inferior
&gt; &gt;&gt; audio quality, but the Rhino releases would have exquisite sound
&gt; &gt;&gt; quality.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Thing is, they were wrong.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Most music consumers really don't seem to give a crap about the sound
&gt; &gt;&gt; quality of what they're listening to, and an mp3 is just as fine for
&gt; &gt;&gt; their music listening purposes as a WAV file of a multitrack master.
&gt; &gt;&gt; This might especially be true of Deadheads, who have nostalgia for the
&gt; &gt;&gt; crappy sound quality audience recordings that they came of age
&gt; &gt;&gt; listening to &quot;back in the day.&quot;  It appears most Deadheads just don't
&gt; &gt;&gt; care about sound quality to nearly the extent that Rhino would hope
&gt; &gt;&gt; they did.

&gt; &gt;&gt; So Rhino has found that the existence of downloadable mp3s is having
&gt; &gt;&gt; nearly as much negative effect on their sales potential as making
&gt; &gt;&gt; uncompressed SBDs available did.  So they stopped their employee,
&gt; &gt;&gt; Lemieux, from allowing downloads.  I wouldn't be surprised if mp3s
&gt; &gt;&gt; disappear from the archive soon, too.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You can still get all the sbds in vbr mp3 from the archive -
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It's not vbr 0, it's something less (how do you determine *which* vrbr
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; level was used to encode a file?), so I'll just go back to that for my
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; easy, ready-to-go mp3s.  I won't be buying any more official dead
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stuff, I don't need it, and I only want to buy it from a company
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that's smart enough and nice enough to keep something as minor as 192k
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mp3s available.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't really understand why this business decision should make folks
&gt; &gt;&gt; angry enough not to buy their products.  They were nice enough to make
&gt; &gt;&gt; the stuff available for free for years.  They never promised to do it
&gt; &gt;&gt; forever.  But hey, if cutting off your nose to spite your face is what
&gt; &gt;&gt; rocks your boat, more power to you.  Better get all the compressed
&gt; &gt;&gt; files as you can from the archive, they may be going soon.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Peace,
&gt; &gt;&gt; Neil X.

&gt; &gt;Because they OWE it to us man#######

&gt; &gt;Fuck all of you ungrateful, greedy, entitled whiners. It's their
&gt; &gt;music, they have the right to do what they want with it,

&gt; &gt;And you have the right to not buy it. It seems eminently fair to me

&gt; &gt;Scot

&gt; I get your point and generally agree, but I don't if it's really a
&gt; fair statement in this case. Most of us agree that the Dead and
&gt; whoever else owns the rights to the music can do what they want with
&gt; it. But the question is not whether they can restrict the
&gt; dissemination of their music but whether they should. In this case, it
&gt; just doesn't seem to make much sense.

&gt; JimK

Maybe, but it just seems like there is a sense of entitlement that
permeates certain circles.
They own it, They can do what they want with it. They have been
incredibly generous with it over the years.. Lots of people sound like
five year olds being told that they can't have another bowl of ice
cream

It's my opinion, and you are welcome to yours, but don't expect me to
change my opinion, I don't take things without permission, and I hold
a dim view of that behavior in others. We all need to decide on what
behaviors we are going to engage in, and I have. Others are free to do
the same,
but it is an unreasonable expection to expect that I am not going to
voice my opinion about something which rubs me the wrong way.

Whether or not it makes sense isn't germaine to anything. It is what
it is. It doesn't matter if it makes sense or not. It's their decision
