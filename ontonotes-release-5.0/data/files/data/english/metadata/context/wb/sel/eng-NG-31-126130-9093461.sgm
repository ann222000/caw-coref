Trying to Prevent World War III
By Caroline Glick
Jerusalem Post

It goes without saying that if and when a decision is made in
Jerusalem or Washington to carry out an attack against Iran's nuclear
installations the public will only learn of the decision in
retrospect. All the same, over the last few weeks, it has been
impossible to miss the fact that the Iranian nuclear program has
become the subject of intense and ever increasing international
scrutiny. This naturally gives rise to the impression that something
is afoot.

Take for example the head of the UN's International Atomic Energy
Agency Muhammad elBaradei's recent remarks on the subject. Speaking
to ,i&gt;Le Monde on Monday, elBaradei asserted that it will take Iran
between three to eight years to acquire a nuclear arsenal.
Consequently, he argued, there is no reason to consider conducting a
military strike against Teheran's program. There is still plenty of
time for diplomacy, or sanctions or even incentives for the
ayatollahs, he said.

ElBaradei's statement is only interesting when it is compared to a
statement he made in December 2005 to the Independent. Back then
Baradei's view was that Iran was just &quot;a few months&quot; away from
producing atomic bombs. But then too he saw no reason to attack. As he
put it when he warned that Iran was on the precipice of nuclear
weapons, using force would just &quot;open Pandora's box.&quot; &quot;There would be
efforts to isolate Iran; Iran would retaliate, and at the end of the
day, you have to go back to the negotiation table to find the
solution,&quot; elBaradei warned.

Given that the IAEA's Egyptian chief has been unstinting in his view
that no obstacle should be placed in Iran's path to nuclear bombs,
what makes his statements from 2005 and today interesting is what they
tell us about his changing perception of the West's intentions. At the
end of 2005, he was fairly certain that the West - led by the US -
lacked the will to attack Iran. By making the statement he made at the
time, he sought to demoralize the West and so convince it that there
was nothing to be done to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Now, when faced with a real possibility that the US or Israel or a
combination of states are ready and willing to attack Iran's nuclear
installations, elBaradei seeks to undermine them by questioning the
salience of the threat.

ElBaradei's statement of course was not made in a vacuum. It came
against the backdrop of an increasing unanimity of opinion among top
Bush administration members that Iran must be prevented from acquiring
nuclear weapons. Last Thursday, President George W. Bush said that a
nuclear armed Iran would foment World War III.

The next day, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who until recently
was known to oppose military action against Iran and to minimize the
danger that a nuclear-armed Iran would constitute to the US, said at a
press briefing that a nuclear-armed Iran would likely spark a nuclear
arms race in the Middle East and was liable to foment a major war.
Gates added that in light of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's
stated desire to destroy Israel, &quot;Washington couldn't trust that Iran
would handle nuclear weapons responsibly.&quot; Standing next to Gates last
Thursday was Admiral Michael Mullen, the new Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Mullen rebuffed assertions that the US campaigns in
Afghanistan and Iraq have strained military resources to the point
that the US today cannot mount an effective campaign against Iran. As
he put it, &quot;From a military standpoint, there is more than enough
reserve&quot; to mount an attack against Iran's nuclear installations.

While Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice continues to champion
negotiations with the mullahs, in testimony before the House Foreign
Affairs Committee on Wednesday Rice acknowledged that &quot;the policies of
Iran constitute perhaps the single greatest challenge for American
security interests in the Middle East and possibly around the world.&quot;
And then there is Israel. It appears that both the IDF and the
government are earnestly preparing for the possibility of war. Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert's sudden visits to Moscow, Paris and London, and
Defense Minister Ehud Barak's trip to Washington this week were all
devoted to the Iranian nuclear project.

One of the main things that we have learned from these reports about
the September 6 Israeli strike against the North Korean nuclear
installation in Syria is that Israeli intelligence on nuclear
proliferation is more comprehensive, and at least in certain areas,
superior to US intelligence. According to media reports of the strike,
the US approved the Israeli operation after Israel brought the US
incontrovertible evidence of the threat posed by the nuclear site.

In light of Israel's apparent intelligence prowess, it seems
reasonable to assume that Olmert and Barak did not fly to those
foreign capitals empty-handed. Indeed by some accounts they brought
with them new and incriminating information regarding the current
status of Iran's nuclear program.

Then there is Iran's neighbor Turkey to consider.

This week Turkish Prime Minister Recip Erdogan paid a sudden visit to
London. There he met with Olmert, who was also in the city that day.
The meeting took place less than two weeks after Turkey's Foreign
Minister Ali Babacan visited Israel. In an analysis this week in The
Asia Times, M.K. Bhadrakumar, India's former ambassador to Turkey tied
Turkey's pro-Hamas government's sudden interest in speaking to Israel
to the tension between Turkey and Iraqi Kurdistan. Bhadrakumar noted
that Israel has close relations with Kurdish President Massoud
Barzani. He hypothesized that the intensification of high-level
discussions likely signals that a deal is being crafted which involves
Turkey's position on Iran, and Iraqi Kurdistan's position on Turkey
and the PKK. His view is buttressed by the fact that Erdogan is
scheduled to meet with Bush at the White House on November 5.

Finally it is important to note Barak's crash-program aimed at
purchasing and deploying missile defense systems capable of covering
all of Israel as quickly as possible, and last week's media reports
that US, British and Australian commandos are fighting Iranian forces
inside of Iran close to the Iran-Iraq border by Basra.

Assuming that all of these developments do in fact mean that the day
is quickly approaching where Iran's nuclear installations come under
attack, a discussion of some of the likely outcomes of such a strike
seems in order. How would Iran respond? What would be the long-term
effect of such a strike? Until Israel attacked the North Korean
nuclear installation in Syria last month, according to the foreign
reports, most analysts assumed that Iran will retaliate against such a
strike with as much force as it is able to muster, and that a
successful attack against Iran's nuclear sites will push back Iran's
nuclear program for approximately five years.

As this scenario has it, Iran will direct a counter-strike against
Israel that will include a ballistic missile attack carried out
jointly by Iran, Syria and Hizbullah in Lebanon. Furthermore, Iran
will direct Hizbullah terror cells throughout the world to carry out
attacks against Jewish and American targets.

But again, as bad as it may be, there is no comparison between an
Iranian missile and terror offensive and Armageddon. By pushing back
Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons by several years, a strike
against Iran gives the world the opportunity to bring down the regime
through non-military means by fomenting an internal revolution of
Iranians.

This outcome remains the most likely scenario. And it is because it
remains the likeliest consequence of an attack that Barak is keen to
get a missile defense system up and running. And it is because this is
the likeliest scenario that most analysts have suggested that Israel
will have to attack Syrian and Hizbullah missile sites at the same
time as Iran's nuclear sites are under attack, But the Israeli strike
on Syria also points to other possible scenarios - for better and for
worse. In an interview with the British Spectator, a senior British
governmental said of the Israeli operation: &quot;If people had known how
close we came to World War III that day there'd have been mass panic.&quot;
According to reports in the Washington Post and the Sunday Times, in
the days before the attack IDF commandos collected soil samples which
indicated the presence of fissile materials at the site. That together
with intelligence regarding the transfer of nuclear materials, perhaps
even a nuclear warhead from North Korea some three days before the
attack, leads to the conclusion that far from being the start of a
long-term undertaking, the site in Syria was advanced and nearly
operational. Given the strategic nature of the installation that
Israel attacked, perhaps the most astounding aspect of the operation
is Syria's decision not to respond.

Syria's non-response may be telling something very optimistic about
the consequences of an attack against Iran. It is possible that what
we learn from Syria's decision not to respond is that under certain
circumstances Iran too may opt not to react to a strike against its
nuclear installations.

On the negative side, the Israeli strike on Syria brought a harsh
reality into full view. The nature of the target and subsequent
reports make clear that the nuclear collaboration between Syria, Iran,
North Korea and perhaps other states is close, active, deep and
strategic. In an article published in last Saturday's Wall Street
Journal, the ranking Republican members of the House Intelligence and
Foreign Relations committees, Peter Hokstra and Ileana Ros-Lehiten -
who both received classified briefings on the Israeli strike -
emphasized the threat arising from this close collaboration. Their
article complemented a report in Jane's Defense Weekly from last
month. According to that report, Syrian and Iranian

Joe - Leaving aside that Iran never promised to wipe Israel off
the map as you claim, don't you think that the top priority of the US
in the Middle East should be working for a peace agreement that
resolves the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Shouldn't that be a much
higher priority than attacking yet another Muslim country that hasn't
attacked the US and isn't about to attack the US?

Um, well, if it wasn't that, it was something along the lines of
&quot;Israel has no right to be there, should disappear, and we should
divide it up and split it amongst the rest of us.&quot; It's close enough
that I wouldn't quibble with the description.

Of course, Israel hearing that and defending itself is still morally
significantly different than the U.S. hearing it and launching a pre-
emptive invasion.

The exact translation of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's remark was &quot;The regime
occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time,&quot;.

However, the roots of the the &quot;wipe Israel off the map&quot; translation
apparently was the Islamic Republic News Agency which used that exact

regarding the World Without Zionism conference.  The Islamic Republic
News Agency is official propaganda arm of Iran.

Also, official translations of Ahmadinejad's statement refer to wiping

And you'll note from this quote that *Iran* never *promises* to do
anything.

Ahmadinejad has indicated in other statements that he expects Israel
to collapse as a matter of historical inevitablity. This would be
similar to the way the Soviet Union did, and would not involve an
Iranian attack on Israel.

Furthermore, in 2003, Iran indicated a willingness to recognize
Israel. From http://tinyurl.com/2rb7zg

[begin quote]

Then came the moment that would lead to an extraordinary battle with
the Bush administration. It was an average morning in April [2003],
about four weeks into the war. Mann picked up her daily folder and sat
down at her desk, glancing at a fax cover page. The fax was from the
Swiss ambassador to Iran, which wasn't unusual -- since the U.S. had
no formal relationship with Iran, the Swiss ambassador represented
American interests there and often faxed over updates on what he was
doing. This time he'd met with Sa-deq Kharrazi, a well-connected
Iranian who was the nephew of the foreign minister and son-in-law to
the supreme leader. Amazingly, Kharrazi had presented the ambassador
with a detailed proposal for peace in the Middle East, approved at the
highest levels in Tehran.

A two-page summary was attached. Scanning it, Mann was startled by one
dramatic concession after another -- &quot;decisive action&quot; against all
terrorists in Iran, an end of support for Hamas and the Islamic Jihad,
a promise to cease its nuclear program, and also an agreement to
recognize Israel.

This was huge. Mann sat down and drafted a quick memo to her boss,
Richard Haass. It was important to send a swift and positive response.

Then she heard that the White House had already made up its mind -- it
was going to ignore the offer. Its only response was to lodge a formal
complaint with the Swiss government about their ambassador's meddling.

In any event, as Seymour Hersh reported, the &quot;existential threat&quot; to
Israel if Iran acquires nukes isn't as much from Iran actually using
them against Israel as it is from Jews packing up and leaving Israel
should Iran acquire them. From http://tinyurl.com/29ob4n

[begin quote]

Earlier this year, the government of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert created a task force to coördinate all the available
intelligence on Iran. The task force, which is led by Major General
Eliezer Shkedi, the head of the Israeli Air Force, reports directly to
the Prime Minister. In late October, Olmert appointed Ephraim Sneh, a
Labor Party member of the Knesset, to serve as Deputy Defense
Minister. Sneh, who served previously in that position under Ehud
Barak, has for years insisted that action be taken to prevent Iran
from getting the bomb. In an interview this month with the Jerusalem
Post, Sneh expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of diplomacy
or international sanctions in curbing Iran:

&quot;The danger isn't as much Ahmadinejad's deciding to launch an
attack but Israel's living under a dark cloud of fear from a leader
committed to its destruction... . Most Israelis would prefer not to
live here; most Jews would prefer not to come here with families, and
Israelis who can live abroad will ... I am afraid Ahmadinejad will be
able to kill the Zionist dream without pushing a button. That's why we
must prevent this regime from obtaining nuclear capability at all
costs.&quot;

Jerry,

Unless I've misunderstood you, you've basically been arguing that Iran
in the hands of people such as Ahmadinejad and the mullahs is not
really a threat to Israel and the west in general, that the threat has
been manufactured by opportunist warmongers.

Yet the quote you provide above doesn't exactly support your thesis
that Iran is not a threat to Israel's existence.  If the goal of Iran
is the end of the Jewish state of Israel, whether that be phrased as
wiping Israel off the map or phrased as vanishing the Israeli regime
from the page of time, certainly Ahmadinejad and the mullahs would
prefer to accomplish that without having to suffer a nuclear volley
against themselves as well.

But make no mistake about it, Iran in the hands of these people is
about as big a threat to the continued existence of the state of
Israel imaginable.  And their pursuit of nuclear weapons is a good
part to facilitate the end of Israel, whether they actually have to
push the button or not.  They're not pursuing nuclear power for
peaceful domestic purposes.  They're doing it to threaten Israel so as
to facilitate its destruction, and they're doing it so as to
intimidate the west from doing anythin about Iran's expanding its
power and influence in the Middle East.  Domestic use of nuclear power
is way down the list of why Iran is doing what it's doing.

And again, unless I'm mistaken, in the past you've argued or implied
that there is no valid reason to think that domestic use of nuclear
energy is not the reason Iran is pursuing nuclear power.

You personally may not think the west is threatened by an Iran
expanding its power and influence in the Middle East.  But I assume
you are aware that the leadership of most western countries do
consider a nuclear armed Iran a threat to their national interests for
that very reason.

And doubtful that it's out of any love for Israel that they feel this
way.  And doubtful that it's because the neo-cons and AIPAC run their
countries the way you think they run the United States.

So there really isn't much disagreement among the leadership of
western countries that Iran doing this would be a threat.  But coming
to an agreement as to what do about it is the difficult question that
all face.

And I agree.  When Israel came into being, Jerusalem was controlled by
Jordan.  They are occupying it illegally.  When Israel gives back the
land they stole with their pre-emptive strike in 1967, then maybe other
neighboring countries will stop calling for the regime's destruction.

Bullshit.  The primary reason they are pursuing nuclear weapons is to
defend themselves against the imperial power USA.  Note that we have a

avoiding conflict with those which do (N. Korea).  This ain't about

All the evidence is that they are. They import gasoline and are in
need of non-fossil fuel energy sources. The Iranians have something
like the equivalent of 60 billion barrels of oil in uranium deposits.
Their access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes - which is
guaranteed to them as a party to the NNPT - has been obstructed
through the efforts of the US in the past. Why shouldn't they want to
be self-sufficient in the  technology necessary for nuclear power?

Well, there is no evidence that Iran has a nuclear weapons program.
But even if they did, I don't think that whatever benefits to the US
that might be derived from attacking Iran would be worth the costs. I
think that such an attack would put the global economy in the shitter,
which would be harmful to the other global powers, and could very
likely result in those powers recognizing that the US is the greatest
threat to their interests and coalescing against the US.

Do you remember in the 1980's when Reagan said something to the effect
that &quot;I just signed a bill outlawing the Soviet Union. Bombing starts

After Kruschev said &quot;we wil bury you&quot;, would a US attack on the Soviet
Union have been justified?

And, as it pertains to Iran, gven the reports that Israel and the US
have plans to attack Iran with nuclear weapons, isn't an Iranian
attack against Israel and the US justified? What about John McCain's
ditty to &quot;bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran&quot;?

has a nuke that can reach xxx country&quot; with &quot;badmouthing.&quot;

You're the leader of a country. You get solid proof (not by cooking
intelligence, etc.) that your neighbor and long-time agitator is two
hours away from launching a nuke at your largest city. Are you really
going to wait until a few million of your citizens die to take action

So freaking stupid. I can't imagine how we could have more thoroughly

Come on.  The concept of M.A.D. kept us safe from the evil USSR for
decades.  Do you seriously think that even if Iran has a nuke, that they
would fire it off at Israel?  It would be a death sentence.  It's not a
tough call.

The sole purpose (if they ARE pursuing it) is to prevent the US from
invading as they did Iraq and didn't N. Korea.  If you were part of the
axis of evil and the US invaded one member who didn't have a nuke and
didn't invade the member who did, wouldn't you try and get one?

So, yes.  You wait.  You stop the irrational fear-mongering and realize
that no country is going to nuke another in this day and age, especially
one who purportedly has nukes themselves, and an ally who is the only
country ever to have actually used them.

I didn't read any of this.

I will point that some conservative commentator who I can't remember
has remarked that we've already had World War III, which was the fight
against Communism and the Soviet Union, which, save for Cuba, was
basically won.

Now, we're on to World War IV, which would be terrorism and Islamo-
fascism, of which I believe Iran would be one of the battles.

The article was in Commentary, and while I disagreed with much of it,
it was well-thought out and presented.

Yes. And I have no doubt that's at least part of the movitation. I

irrational with a nuke in Iran once it's in hand. Once you start

I'd stop it if I'd ever been doing it. The most controversial point
I've made here is that a country with foreknowledge of an actual
attack against it may opt to strike to avoid that attack. That isn't
irrational, nor is it fearmongering. I'm not making a case for Bush.
As discussed, Bush has actually provided some cover for Iran to pursue
nukes through his posturing (well, and the Iraqi invasion). And the
trouble with my point is the pesky &quot;foreknowledge&quot; part, of course.

I'm not being pro-Bush, pro-Israel, pro-Palestine, or pro-Iran here,
and maybe that's a little disorienting in a thread where people tend
to forward arguments based on their particular sympathies in the
region. I was just making a point about a sensitive but arguable case
of self-defense, especially if the imminent attack can be avoided
through a specific strike on the relevant military installation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I think we were actually talking about both at one time or another,
which is probably my fault. Well, I was never talking *invasion*; I
was talking about an attack to prevent an imminent attack. I think
that in some cases, you were reading my writing and trying to lump me
in with the neocon drum-beating when in reality that is far from the
truth.
