China's "Market Reforms": A Trotskyist Analysis

Part One

Two years ago, two left-wing American intellectuals, Martin
Hart-Landsberg and Paul Burkett, produced a harsh and sweeping
condemnation of the Chinese economy in the "reform" era from a
purportedly Marxist perspective. Their article, "China and Socialism:
Market Reforms and Class Struggle," was originally published in
Monthly Review (July-August 2004) and subsequently brought out in book
form. In particular, the authors target those "progressive"
intellectuals who regard China as a successful alternative model of
economic development to the neoliberal "structural reforms"
dictated by U.S. imperialism and the International Monetary Fund that
have devastated so many underdeveloped countries. Hart-Landsberg and
Burkett write: "Not only do we disagree with those progressives who
view China as a development model (whether socialist or not), we think
the process by which they arrived at this position highlights an even
more serious problem: the progressive community's general rejection
of Marxism."

Among the "progressives" with whom they disagree is Victor Lippit,
who with his cothinkers at Critical Asian Studies (37:3 [2005])
responded with some critical studies of "China and Socialism."
Hart-Landsberg and Burkett in turn wrote a lengthy rejoinder (Critical
Asian Studies 37:4 [2005]).

A political liberal and longtime student of the Chinese economy, Lippit
is basically a supporter of China's program of market-oriented
"reforms," albeit with some left criticisms. For example, he
decries the deterioration of the public health system, especially in
the countryside, as "shameful." He would have the Beijing regime
expend far more resources on health care, education and improving the
conditions of the rural populace, even at the cost of a short-term
reduction in economic growth as conventionally measured. Nonetheless,
Lippit is definitely bullish on China, citing a study by the Wall
Street investment bank Goldman Sachs projecting that China's gross
domestic product will surpass that of the United States by 2041.

For all their differences, Hart-Landsberg and Burkett on the one side
and Lippit on the other share certain basic premises. Both wrongly
maintain that the market-oriented "reforms" have resulted in the
restoration of capitalism in China and, moreover, that this was
inevitable. For Lippit, the modernization of China requires its
continuing and ever-greater integration into the world capitalist
system. He claims that "capitalism will have to play out its historic
role before it can be supplanted," adding that "Welfare-state
capitalism of the continental European variety may be the best that can
be done at present." For Hart-Landsberg and Burkett, a socialist
program in China or elsewhere-which they identify with the
confusionist formula of a "worker-community-centered
economy"-must have little or no commerce with the corrupting evils
of the world capitalist market.

Most crucially, both reject the possibility of proletarian socialist
revolutions in the advanced capitalist countries in any historically
meaningful time period. Lippit does so explicitly, Hart-Landsberg and
Burkett implicitly. Hence the Trotskyist perspective of the
modernization of China in the context of a globally integrated and
planned socialist economy lies outside the conceptual boundaries of
both protagonists. Yet this framework, the antithesis of the
nationalist Maoist-Stalinist dogma of building "socialism in one
country," is the only road to the all-round liberation of China's
worker and peasant masses.

China Today: Myths and Realities

The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under Deng Xiaoping introduced
its program of market-oriented reforms a few years after the death of
Mao Zedong in 1976. This included opening China to, and subsequently
attracting, an enormous volume of direct capital investment from
Western and Japanese corporations and the offshore Chinese bourgeoisie,
concentrated in manufacturing. Mainstream bourgeois ideologues have
pointed to China's impressive economic and especially industrial
growth as proof positive of the superiority of a market-driven system
over a centrally planned, collectivized economy (derogatively called a
socialist "command economy"). For his part, Lippit is
representative of a layer of left-of-center intellectuals who hold up
China as a prime example of a successful anti-neoliberal economic
strategy, one based on a significant level of state ownership and
overall state direction of the economy.

This latter view has the merit of recognizing, in its own way, that the
core elements of the Chinese economy, established following the
overthrow of the capitalist system in the 1949 Revolution, remain
collectivized. State-owned enterprises are dominant in the strategic
industrial sectors, such as steel, non-ferrous metals, heavy machinery,
telecommunications, electric power and oil extraction and refining. The
nationalization of land has prevented the emergence of a class of
large-scale agrarian capitalists socially dominating the countryside.
The mass of economic surplus generated outside the foreign-owned sector
is channeled into state-owned banks as well as the government treasury.
Effective control of the financial system has to date enabled the
Beijing regime to insulate China from the volatile movements of
speculative money-capital that periodically wreak havoc with
neocolonial capitalist countries from East Asia to Latin America.

It is now commonplace across the entire political and geographical
spectrum, from spokesmen for the CCP regime to Wall Street analysts, to
claim that China is far along the road to becoming a global economic
"superpower" by the mid 21st century. This view ignores the
economic vulnerabilities of China in its relations with the world
capitalist market. It ignores the implacable hostility of the
imperialist bourgeoisies, above all the American ruling class, to the
People's Republic of China, a bureaucratically deformed workers state
issuing out of the 1949 Revolution. Further, it ignores the internal
instability of Chinese society, which has seen a significant and
growing level of social protest against the consequences of the CCP's
bureaucratic misrule.

In the past few years the economic strategy pursued by the CCP regime
has been designed to run huge balance of trade surpluses with the
United States which has led China to become the world's largest
holder of foreign-exchange reserves. This has generated increasing
pressures within American ruling circles for anti-Chinese economic
protectionism. In any event, the sheer size of the trade deficit with
China cannot be long sustained. A major economic downturn in the U.S.
and/or anti-import protectionist measures would be a severe blow to
China's industrial economy. Foreign-owned and joint operations and
private Chinese companies, as well as some state-owned enterprises,
whose production is geared to the export market, would be forced to
sharply cut back output and lay off both industrial and white-collar
workers. This would have a strongly depressive effect throughout the
Chinese economy.

Recently China has begun to open its banks to partial foreign
ownership. If the bankers of Wall Street, Frankfurt and Tokyo acquire a
substantial degree of control over China's financial sector, the
economic effects are likely to be dire. Some large debt-ridden
state-owned enterprises could be forced to cut output and payroll.
There would even be a real danger of a sudden, massive outflow of
money-capital, such as that which triggered the East Asian
financial/economic crisis in the late 1990s.

According to conventional bourgeois public opinion, capitalism has
already been restored in China or is rapidly and irreversibly being
restored. However, as was the case in the former Soviet Union, the
decisive arena in which a capitalist counterrevolution would have to
triumph is at the political level, in the conquest of state power, not
simply through a quantitative extension of the private sector, whether
domestic or foreign. In their own way, the imperialist bourgeoisies,
centrally the American ruling class, understand that very well. Hence
the open support of the U.S. and British governments for the
aggressively anti-Communist parties and forces in the capitalist
enclave of Hong Kong, a former British colony that is the one part of
the People's Republic of China (besides Macao) where the CCP does not
exercise a monopoly of political power and organization. Hence also the
U.S. rulers' harping on the need for "political liberalization"
in China.

Aspiring to replay the counterrevolutionary destruction of the Soviet
Union in 1991-92, the imperialists aim to promote an anti-Communist
political opposition in China primarily based on the new class of
capitalist entrepreneurs and those elements of the CCP officialdom and
the managerial/professional/technocratic stratum closely tied to
domestic and foreign capital.

At the same time, U.S. imperialism has been ratcheting up the military
pressure on China, building bases in Central Asia, attempting to
surround China with American military installations and concluding a
pact last year with Japan to defend the capitalist bastion of Taiwan,
whose bourgeoisie holds considerable investments in mainland China. The
Pentagon is actively pursuing plans to neutralize China's small
nuclear arsenal in the event of an American nuclear first strike, a
strategy openly proclaimed by the Bush gang in Washington. As
Trotskyists, we stand for the unconditional military defense of China
and the other remaining bureaucratically deformed workers
states-North Korea, Vietnam and Cuba-against imperialist attack and
capitalist counterrevolution. In particular, we support China and North
Korea's testing and possession of nuclear arms as a necessary
deterrent against imperialist nuclear blackmail.

Another one by Will Hutton.
Will comment soon after all have read it...

Power, corruption and lies

To the west, China is a waking economic giant, poised to dominate the
world. But, argues Will Hutton in this extract from his new book, we
have consistently exaggerated and misunderstood the threat - and the
consequences could be grave

Monday January 8, 2007
The Guardian

The emergence of China as a $2 trillion economy from such inauspicious
beginnings only 25 years ago is such a giddy accomplishment that the
temptation to see its success as proof positive of your own prejudices
is overwhelming. And the west's broad prejudice is that China is
growing so rapidly because it has abandoned communism and embraced
capitalism. China's own claim - that it is building a very particular
economic model around what it describes as a socialist market economy -
is dismissed as hogwash, the necessary rhetoric the Communist party
must use to disguise what is actually happening. China proves
conclusively that liberalisation, privatisation, market freedoms and
the embrace of globalisation are the only route to prosperity. China is
on its way to capitalism but will not admit it.

Article continues
But the closer you get to what is happening on the ground in China, its
so-called capitalism looks nothing like any form of capitalism the west
has known and the transition from communism remains fundamentally
problematic. The alpha and omega of China's political economy is that
the Communist party remains firmly in the driving seat not just of
government, but of the economy - a control that goes into the very
marrow of how ownership rights are conceived and business strategies
devised. The western conception of the free exercise of property rights
and business autonomy that goes with it, essential to any notion of
capitalism, does not exist in China.

The truth is that China is not the socialist market economy the party
describes, nor moving towards capitalism as the western consensus
believes. Rather it is frozen in a structure that I describe as
Leninist corporatism - and which is unstable, monumentally inefficient,
dependent upon the expropriation of peasant savings on a grand scale,
colossally unequal and ultimately unsustainable. It is Leninist in that
the party still follows Lenin's dictum of being the vanguard, monopoly
political driver and controller of the economy and society. And it is
corporatist because the framework for all economic activity in China is
one of central management and coordination from which no economic
actor, however humble, can opt out.

In this environment genuine wholesale privatisation is impossible and
liberalisation has well-defined limits, as President Hu Jintao himself
brutally reminds us. The party, he says, "takes a dominant role and
coordinates all sectors. Party members and party organisations in
government departments should be brought into full play so as to
realise the party's leadership over state affairs". It may be true that
party organisations in the provinces (some with populations bigger than
Britain's) and in the chief cities are jealous of their autonomous
local political control, but all retain the discretionary power to do
what they choose and override any challenge or complaint from any
non-state actor - or, indeed, from state actors if they cross the will
of the party.

Absolute power corrupts, and the Chinese Communist party has become one
of the most corrupt organisations the world has ever witnessed. The
combination of absolute power and an ideology that palpably no longer
describes reality is a virus that is morally and psychologically
undermining the regime. And if the regime wobbles, then its capacity to
sustain the unsustainable economic structures will wobble and Leninist
corporatism will unravel. Beijing's authority could fragment and
China's provinces reassert their destructive independence as they did
in the 1910s and 20s, or a new and fiercely repressive regime could try
to hold the country together abandoning economic openness and market
reforms - and even pick some international fights (such as invading
Taiwan?) to rally the country to its side. It is because this prospect
is so real that the task of peacefully moving to a sustainable
capitalism, and building the necessary institutions to do it, is so
vital for both China and the world.

Ever since the late 1990s the party leadership, then under Hu's
predecessor Jiang Zemin, has rightly become more and more preoccupied
with how corruption is corroding the party. "If we do not crack down on
corruption, the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the people
will suffer a lot and the party will be in danger of losing its ruling
position, or possibly heading for self-destruction," Jiang declared in
2002, in his last political report to the National Congress. High-level
officials had been arrested and imprisoned for embezzlement and
racketeering; they included the party secretary and mayor of Beijing,
Chen Xitong, a member of the Politburo. Cheng Kejie, vice-chairman of
the National People's Congress, was executed for taking pounds 2.5m in
kickbacks for arranging land deals and contracts for private business.
In the financial system the highest-profile casualties were three of
prime minister Zhu Rongji's hand-picked "can-do commanders", selected
to sort out the financial crisis of the late 1990s, and one of whom, Li
Fuxiang, leaped to his death from the seventh floor of Beijing's
Hospital 304 while under investigation. To put this in a British
context, it is as if the Mayor of London, the speaker of the House of
Commons, the chief executive of HSBC, along with a deputy governor of
the Bank of England and the deputy chief executive of the Financial
Services Authority had all been imprisoned for fraud with one
committing suicide.

For all the strengthening of the anti-corruption and Orwellian sounding
"Central Discipline Inspection Committee", corruption remains deeply
embedded. The number of arrests of senior cadres members above the
county level quadrupled between 1992 and 2001, and since then have
included a ring of officials in Gansu, one of China's poorest
provinces, caught embezzling pounds 500m. Four provincial governors and
one provincial party secretary have been charged recently - the top
posts in China outside Beijing. And in September 2006 came the arrest
of Shanghai party secretary and member of the politburo Chen Liangyu
for his involvement in the misappropriation of pounds 206m of social
security funds.

The Chinese economist Hu Angang, in his trailblazing book Great
Transformations in China: Challenges and Opportunities, calculates that
over the late 90s the cumulative annual cost of corruption was between
13.3% and 16.9% of GDP and is still around that level today. Every
incident of corruption - smuggling, embezzlement, theft, swindling,
bribery - arises in the first place from the unchallengeable power of
communist officials and the lack of any reliable, independent system of
accountability and scrutiny. Corruption has become part of the system's
DNA, now threatening the integrity of the state.

To see how, look no further than the combination of one-party control
and corruption and how it deforms the legal system. The judicial
apparatus is politicised from top to bottom. Every president and
vice-president of a court is appointed by the party; and the courts are
funded by provincial governments. The court bureaucracy works on the
same basis as the rest of the government, with a party committee system
superintending each rung of the court hierarchy. Judges often make
decisions at the instruction of the committee or government
independently of the legal merits of the case.

Many judges still have no formal legal training - the majority are
retired army officers, only too ready to do the party's bidding. The
scale of the corruption is stunning. In 2003, 794 judges were tried for
corruption (out of a national total of 200,000). In 2003 and 2004, the
presidents of the provincial high courts of Guangdong and Hunan were
both found guilty of corruption. When the party does not or cannot
influence the judgment in a case, it can use its influence over the
police to decide whether to slow down or not enforce the judgment.
Enforcement rates in China are lamentable; for example, only 40% of
provincial high court decisions are enforced. The lack of a clear
system of property rights, with the party-state claiming particular
privileges, can make debt enforcement against state organisations close
to impossible.

As a potential watchdog to correct any of this, the media is crippled.
China now has more than 2,000 newspapers, 2,000 television channels,
9,000 magazines and 450 radio stations, but they are all under the
watchful eye of the party in Beijing or provincial propaganda
departments. These authorities issue daily instructions on what may and
may not be reported; journalists who digress will be suspended from
working or even imprisoned. China is estimated to have 42 journalists
in prison, the highest number in the world. Editors know roughly how
much slack they have; but recently, under Hu Jintao, there has been a
tightening of the leash. The right to travel independently and report
from a non-local city had allowed more aggressive reporting of
corruption; but it has been rescinded. Some prominent editors have been
fired. For instance, Yang Bin, editor of China's most forceful tabloid,
the Beijing News, was dismissed in 2005 for reporting village protests
against unfair confiscation of land. Other journalists have been
prohibited from publishing. The Committee to Protect Journalists, in
its 2005 report on repression of the media, quotes the government-run
People's Daily: "[During 2004] censorship agencies permanently shut
down 338 publications for printing 'internal' information, closed 202
branch offices of newspapers, and punished 73 organisations for
illegally 'engaging in news activities'."
