My hubby can get so violent over small things and it always happens on
the weekend or the end of the week. I have had to go to the hospital
ER for having my head lacerated by him from hitting me with a
deodorant stick. (The part you turn to make the stick pop up) I keep
bruises on my legs from him kicking me and he tends to always hit me
on my back or my head.
He was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder a few weeks ago and was placed
on Depakote laong with his Cymbalta that he has been taking for almost
a year now. I'm not scared of him and I actually fight back but I
don't want to hurt him or him to hurt me anymore. He calls me 10 to 15
times a day at work and he spends like crazy. I will not give up on
him and I will always be there for him.
I just want to understand why is he doing this to me and his
family....
I'm tired of making up lies to cover my bruises.....
His parents deny that he has a problem and blame me for stressing him
out so that he attacks me. I'm sick of having great days and then he
turns around and gets nasty again.
I'm tired of this roller coaster but I am staying because I love him
dearly and I want to help him.
