Van Halen heads to The Q with Roth in tow
Friday, October 05, 2007
John Soeder - Cleveland Plain Dealer

Almost everything you really need to know about Van Halen is right
there in &quot;Runnin' With the Devil,&quot; the first song on the
groundbreaking hard-rock band's self-titled first album, released
nearly 30 years ago.

The first thing you hear is a Doppler effect, seemingly emanating from
an oncoming Mack truck. Or a runaway freight train. Or an incoming
UFO. Or quite possibly all of the above.

A bass guitar thumps. The steady 4/4 beat is picked up by a cymbal. It
sounds like someone knocks over some empty liquor bottles. Then an
electric guitar roars to life.

&quot;I got no love, no love you'd call re-aaal,&quot; the singer declares,
hamming it up.

The musicians aren't so much runnin' with the devil (those sunny
backing vocals and the slide whistle are dead giveaways: These dudes
aren't real Satan worshippers!) as they are runnin' with the idea of
runnin' with the devil.

So went our fitting introduction to vaudevillian lead vocalist David
Lee Roth, whiz-bang guitarist Eddie Van Halen, his drum-pounding
brother Alex Van Halen and bass player Michael Anthony.

Meet Van Halen, a group perennially bedeviled by interpersonal drama.

Now, just when you thought they were runnin' on empty, they're on the
road again. Well, most of them, anyway. In a bizarre twist (is there
any other kind, as far as this long-running, spandex-clad soap opera
goes?), Anthony has been replaced by Eddie's 16-year-old son,
Wolfgang, on bass. Founding members Roth, Eddie and Alex are 53, 52
and 54, respectively.

The quartet launched a 38-date North American tour -- Van Halen's
first tour with Roth in 23 years -- last week in Charlotte, N.C. If
the gods allow, they'll headline a concert Wednesday at The Q in
Cleveland.

Long-suffering Van Halen fans have clamored for years for the return
of Roth. But is this really a fresh start? Or just another false
start?

Just like starting over

&quot;This is not a reunion -- this is a new band,&quot; Roth said during a
press conference in August in Los Angeles, the group's hometown.

Since then, direct quotes have been all but impossible to get. The
band isn't doing any interviews, according to the Van Halen camp's two
publicists. Roth apparently requires one publicist all to himself.
Eddie's girlfriend handles PR for the rest of the group. (Eddie and
Wolfgang's mom, actress Valerie Bertinelli, split in 2001, after 20
years of marriage.)

It's as if the band were a murder-trial jury, sequestered from the
outside world. Then again, it doesn't take much to upset the Van Halen
apple cart. Plans for a tour originally were announced in February,
only to be put on hold several weeks later, with no explanation.

Roth, Eddie and Alex were no-shows when the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
inducted Van Halen in March during a ceremony at New York City's
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Roth was unable to come to terms with
organizers about a performance during the festivities, Eddie was in
rehab for unspecified reasons and Alex presumably had something better
to do.

The unfortunate turn of events left Sammy Hagar (who became Van
Halen's singer after Roth went solo in 1985) and Anthony (reportedly
booted from the group because he fraternized with Hagar) to accept the
Rock Hall honor, after members of Velvet Revolver sang Van Halen's
praises.

&quot;When they hit the L.A. scene, they blew it wide open when rock needed
a real kick in the [expletive],&quot; Velvet Revolver frontman Scott
Weiland said.

Hagar and Van Halen parted company in 1996, the same year Roth briefly
returned to the lineup to record a couple of new songs for a greatest-
hits compilation. Eddie said Hagar quit; Hagar said he was fired.

The band's last studio effort, 1998's &quot;Van Halen III,&quot; sold a
relatively modest 549,000 copies -- the first non-multiplatinum
release in the band's history. It featured vocalist Gary Cherone,
formerly of Extreme and -- as of 1999 -- formerly of Van Halen.

In and out of control

Five years ago, while the Van Halen brothers plotted their next move,
Roth and Hagar co-headlined a road trip (unofficially known as the
&quot;Sans Halen&quot; Tour), which commenced in Northeast Ohio with a May 2002
gig at Blossom Music Center.

&quot;The Van Halens are not in control of their future right now,
obviously,&quot; Roth said at the time. &quot;I think [their] operative
words . . . at this very moment are Uh-oh.' &quot;

A few years later, I got a surprise phone call from Eddie, who took
exception to my review of Van Halen's July 2004 concert at Gund Arena,
back when Hagar temporarily was back in the fold. Eddie was unhappy
with me for taking Hagar to task for not bringing the same swagger as
Roth to some of the older material, among other reasons.

&quot;Why did you even have to bring up Roth?&quot; Eddie said. &quot;If you knew
Roth the way I do, you would go, This guy is out of his [expletive]
mind!' &quot;

Despite their war of words in the past, Roth and Eddie hugged and made
up for the cameras at the August press conference.

Band members remained in good spirits as they fine-tuned &quot;Unchained,&quot;
&quot;Jump,&quot; &quot;Panama&quot; and other Roth-era Van Halen favorites on the eve of
the tour, at least judging from amateur videos from a rehearsal in Los
Angeles posted on the Internet.

A sense of unfinished business hangs over the tour, said Ian Christe,
author of &quot;Everybody Wants Some: The Van Halen Saga,&quot; a new biography
of the group.

&quot;The band really needs to do this to secure its legacy,&quot; Christe said.
&quot;They made six amazing records with David Lee Roth, then it ended.
When they returned with Sammy Hagar, it was a totally different band.

&quot;I think they've grown up, maybe 30 or 40 years later than the average
person does, just to get to this point, to be able to play together
again and to do these shows. I think they appreciate what they have
this time.&quot;

How long they'll keep runnin' with Roth is anyone's guess. In the
meantime, we're left to wonder: Is there any love lost among these
Hall of Famers, any love you'd call re-aaal?

Or could another classic Van Halen tune -- &quot;Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love&quot;
-- be this truce's theme song?
