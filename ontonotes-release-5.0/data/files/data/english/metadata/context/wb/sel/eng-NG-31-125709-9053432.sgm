Jyoti &amp; Kirit Parikh; Top Rated Idiots
I wondered for long what motivation Kirit has to continue in government
service 13 years post retirement when he could get good pension and enjoy
relaxed life. I didn't imagine his spouse would be even smarter than him.
Last week there was a shabby presentation at IHC by Jyoti Parikh from there
I got to know that.
She is partnering with UNDP, IGES Japan, World Bank, Energia Netherland,
UNEP, Stanford University, MNES, MoEF, Winrock, Invest India Foundation &amp;
Self Employed Women Association &amp; PWC- many more like RIL. From the website
I concluded she is doing ordinary work but millions of dollars come with it.

In the above story she masterminds poisoning of entire length and breath of
with poisonous Jatropha weeds that are prohibited in all developed
countries. At the IHC I raised the issue of Jatropha weeds that is poisonous
all life forms. Its leaf dust is allergic could cause cancer, all its parts
are poisonous, even leaves going in to water bodies could kill aquatic life.

What is gain for poisoning entire country â€“ 20 Million tons of Jatropha oil
as per her calculation from 15 million hectares, actual could be not even 10
million tons?

Jatropha is priced Rs.25 per kg approx so the oil production is worth Rs.25,000
crores or $6b. This couple with global experience doesn't know that there
are thousands of innovation that can easily save $6b worth of energy or fuel
without poisoning our land and environment. I have scores of technologies
but they are only interested in third grade work.

With so many fancy qualification this idiot lady doesn't know that 15
million hectare is three times area of Punjab or more than Tamil Nadu, just
25% less than Gujarat her birth state.

Only last week at a seminar I told him India can at least 20% of electricity
if we could efficiently distribute canal waters, 70% to 90% of canal water
is lost in distribution and replace locally made inefficient pumps.

It is shocking in the index page this stupid lady has introduced expeller
for extracting oil from Jatropha seeds that contain around 30% oil but
8%-10% oil remain in the oilcake. So expeller method of oil extraction is
very inefficient but in the case of edible oils oil cakes are used as cattle
feed is productively used. Obviously solvent extraction should have been
used.

They are simply there to make a fool of us and poison India environment.

Cash for power bills may check water misuse at farms: Parikh
Our Bureau NEW DELHI ET September19, 2007 P-13 **

THE Planning Commission on Tuesday suggested providing one-time cash
compensation to farmers for paying electricity bills instead of the current
system of government subsidy. According to the Plan panel, the move will
check groundwater exploitation as farmers would be discouraged from using
electric pumps for drawing groundwater.

Releasing the report of the Expert Group on Groundwater Management and
Ownership, Planning Commission member Kirit Parikh said such a mechanism
would prevent over-exploitation of groundwater, especially in areas where
recharge was low, without increasing the subsidy burden, which was as high
as Rs 30,000 crore in 2001-02.

According to the proposed scheme, farmers could be assigned an amount
based on a fixed number of power units. The Plan panel has proposed that
farmers can be given Rs 6,000 at Rs 2 per unit for using 3,000 units of
power.

&quot;The total charges can be deducted from the given amount and the surplus
may be handed over to the farming community at the year-end,&quot; Mr Parikh
said.

The report also suggested separation of agricultural and household pumps,
besides using advanced tools, such as geographical information system and
remote sensing equipment, for groundwater management.

The country needs to involve panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) to ensure
efficient use of groundwater, Mr Parikh said, adding 6 lakh PRIs should
manage groundwater utilisation and ensure their recharge during monsoons.

&quot;The rate of extraction of groundwater is increasing and in many blocks
it exceeds the rate of recharge, leading to lowered water tables. About 28%
of the blocks are now semi-critical, critical and over-exploited,&quot; the
report states. The number of dark or over-exploited critical blocks has
grown from 4% in 1995 to 15% in 2004.

&quot;Currently, total water use (including groundwater) is 634 billion cubic
metres (BCM), of which 83% is for irrigation. The demand for water is
projected to grow to 813 BCM by 2010, 1,093 BCM by 2025 and 1,447 BCM by
2050, against the utilisable quantum of 1,123 BCM,&quot; the report added.

The Plan panel has also favoured central intervention when groundwater
level is depleted below the replenishable level. &quot;Such an area would have to
be declared as an area under environmental threat for the states to regulate
groundwater use,&quot; Mr Parikh suggested.

*How India can grow its own oil**
*
September 02, 2005

India's energy challenge is particularly daunting today. Oil prices have
remained above $60 per barrel for some time now and now touching $70 a
barrel. Oil and gas imports cost the country Rs 120,000 crore (Rs 1,200
billion) annually and the cost of high oil prices for this year is yet to be
estimated.

In 2003, India consumed 124 million tonnes (MT) of crude and petroleum
products, of which 73 per cent was imported.

Given that our consumption of energy will only increase and that India has
only about 700 million tonnes of economic reserves of crude left (enough oil
for 22 years of production at the current level and six years of current
consumption!), it is imperative we look for alternatives.

Some of the initiatives under discussion are energy efficiency, renewable
energy, equity oil abroad, higher domestic oil recovery and production, and
so on. These alternatives, however, are not enough to bridge the gap between
growing future demand and the domestic supply of energy.

In the light of this energy quandary, oilseeds-based fuels are being
discussed, viz. biodiesel and straight vegetable oil (SVO). These options
could be used in the transport and agricultural sectors, respectively. What
would this require?

At the national level, 15 million hectares of wasteland could give about 20
MT of oil equivalent output. Non-edible oilseeds can be grown along railway
lines, wastelands, highways and fencing of various types. For mass
cultivation, the long list of oilseeds has been narrowed down to two major
candidates -- jatropha (ratanjot) and pongamia (karanj).

Other seeds such as neem and mahua can fulfil niche markets. The process of
using such bio-fuels is fairly simple: it consists of growing plants,
collecting oilseeds, installing expellers, and extracting raw oil.

To use SVO in stationary equipment, further minor processing is required and
to use biodiesel of higher quality, transesterification is needed. Efforts
to develop these mechanisms and technologies are under way in different
parts of the country but the spark that ignites the whole programme is
missing.

Let us contextualise the oilseeds plan with respect to other programmes of
equivalent magnitudes of, say, 20-30 MT per year. ONGC produces about 26 to
30 MT of oil per year, which depends on limited and non-renewable sources
discovered at great cost, risk, and effort over years.

The pipeline through Iran, which requires considerable investment and
diplomatic effort, will also result in about 20 MT of supply per year
(providing it materialises after international negotiations). Through
oilseeds, India can reach a goal of producing 20 MT within 10 to 15 years.

As plantations can supply oilseeds for 30 to 35 years, 600-700 MT of oil
could be obtained over this period. Thus, the programme should be given
importance in terms of political will and investment.

Moreover, the programme will provide energy security not only at the
national level but at the local level too, providing livelihood for the poor
without the corresponding risk the above two have.

However, the point is to do all the three together because we do not add up
to 50 per cent of current consumption. President APJ Abdul Kalam and the
Planning Commission have emphasised these options. The latter has put forth
a national mission report on biodiesel but not for SVO.

The national mission report on biodiesel discusses the techno-economic
possibility of various bio-fuels, which develops a demonstration project of
400,000 hectares. There are, however, three additional points that must be
considered beyond that project.

First, while this report has good analytical content, its plans rely on a
coordination committee consisting of representatives from government
departments.
However, for successful implementation, various management models will be
needed with considerable input from the private and public sectors. For
example, entrepreneurship at the micro-enterprise level (managed by NGOs) is
one possibility for SVO.

This is especially appropriate for the block-level implementation of a few
tonnes per day for local use. Large-scale implementation, consisting of all
steps from growing to processing, can be handled by the corporate sector.
Furthermore, various combinations of public-private partnership should be
encouraged.

Second, the report currently looks at only the biodiesel for the transport
sector. They may have their own reasons and priorities, but where do poor
farmers, whose demands are not met, stand in this regard?

Their needs for oil for irrigation pumps, diesel generators, and farm
equipment can be met from a variety of non-edible oilseeds available without
the expensive transsterification process to convert SVO to biodiesel.
Biodiesel used in the transport sector is meant for engines that are
expensive and require high-quality fuels.

Moreover, for vehicles, strict pollution standards are required. Why should
the farmers pay an additional Rs 8-10 per litre for the process needed for
automobiles, when they only require SVO for their stationary equipment? A
roadmap must be prepared for meeting farmers' needs and also private and
public sector involvement.

Third, the possibility of getting additional revenue from carbon credits
should be considered. Biomass-based fuels not only emit less local
environmental pollutants; they also avoid greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions
(emitted from fossil fuels) that are responsible for climate change or
global warming.

Internationally, GHG reductions get carbon credits, which are valued at
about $5 to $7 per tonne of GHG saved or avoided. These additional revenues
can help bridge the gap between the supply cost and price to be charged to
the consumer.

However, the condition for getting carbon credit is that the project should
not be done for statutory requirement, such as any court order or Act of
Parliament (because then the project is being undertaken for reasons other
than saving GHG emissions). Announcing mandatory percentages of mix in
biodiesel has to be done carefully if we do not wish to lose carbon credits.

Oilseeds energy relies on land, water, sunshine, and chemicals and
fertilisers. A minimum purchase price for oilseeds or oil may be offered to
motivate cultivation.
Renewable oil can be cultivated under employment guarantee schemes, the
Akshay Urja initiative, Bharat Nirman, and others, so as to help the aam
aadmi grow his own oil (although the aam aurat can do this as well, if not
better). Public sector units of the petroleum sector and other sectors and
enterprises can take the lead to galvanise this effort.
