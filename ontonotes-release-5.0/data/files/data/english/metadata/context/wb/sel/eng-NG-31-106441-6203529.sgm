Caspases and their many biological functions

By the time this editorial goes to press, it will be almost 15 years
since the discovery in 1992 of the first caspase,
interleukin-1-converting enzyme (ICE), which is now known as
caspase-1.1, 2 As the name suggests ICE/caspase-1 was discovered as an
enzyme that proteolytically processes interleukin-1 precursor to
generate active interleukin-1.1, 2 The discovery and initial
characterisation of ICE provided no clues to the role of ICE-like
proteases in cell death. It was only the cloning of the Caenorhabditis
elegans cell death gene ced-3 in 1993 which generated evidence that
CED-3/ICE-like proteases, now widely known as caspases (cysteinyl
aspartate proteinases), play key roles in apoptosis execution.3 Besides
ICE, one of the first known mammalian homologues of CED-3 was Nedd2
(now known as caspase-2), initially cloned in 1992 as a developmentally
regulated mouse gene.4, 5 Ironically, despite being the closest
mammalian homologue of CED-3, the function of caspase-2 still remains
an enigma. Nevertheless, the discovery of CED-3 heralded a flurry of
publications in subsequent years on cloning and characterisation of a
large number of caspases from various metazoans. It is fair to say that
the impact of the discovery of caspases on the field of cell death has
been enormous. At the time of writing this editorial a Pubmed (National
Center of Biotechnology Information) search indicated around 26 000
publications contain the word caspase in their title or abstract -
which is remarkable given the short time since the discovery of the
first caspase.

Despite the fact that the function of caspase-1 is primarily to
activate proinflammatory cytokines, much of the earlier work on
caspases focused on their functions in apoptosis. Cell Death and
Differentiation, then a nascent journal trying to find its way in a
rapidly evolving and expanding field, published its first review on
caspases in 1996.6 This followed in 1999 the publication of a
comprehensive set of reviews covering all aspects of caspases.7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14 These reviews, contributed by many of leaders in
caspase research, were highly successful and provided an excellent
resource for researchers in the field for many years. A number of other
stand-alone reviews on different aspects of caspase biology and
function have been published by this journal since 1999. Given that a
lot of new information has become available in the past 7 years since
the publication of the 1999 caspase review series, the editors
considered this an opportune time to publish an up-to-date compendium
of reviews on caspases. As a result this issue of Cell Death and
Differentiation carries seven focused reviews on various aspects of
caspases. We also plan to publish additional reviews later this year on
aspects of caspases that are not covered here.

Given that the first discovered function of caspases was in
inflammation,1, 2 inflammatory caspases are the subject of the first
two, slightly overlapping but comprehensive, reviews by Martinon and
Tschopp15 and Scott and Saleh.16 The proinflammatory caspases are only
found in vertebrates, with caspase-1 being the prototypic member of the
family that also includes caspases-4, -5, -11 and -12.15, 16 The
article by Martinon and Tschopp15 focuses on these caspases and how
their activation may be regulated by large multiprotein complexes,
often termed inflammasomes. They describe the complexity of these
caspase activation platforms as evident from multiple caspase-1
activating inflammasomes. They then discuss the signals that activate
inflammasomes, the roles of inflammasomes in autoinflammatory
disorders, innate and adaptive immune responses, and the regulation of
inflammatory caspase activation. The review article by Scott and
Saleh16 expands on the topic of inflammatory caspases, with particular
emphasis on caspase-12 and its role in sepsis. The authors also discuss
inflammatory caspase gene organisation, expression, regulation,
substrates, and role in innate immunity and inflammatory disorders. In
the last section of their article they summarise the potential role of
inflammatory caspases in apoptosis in specific paradigms.

Genetic studies in C. elegans suggest that one of the conserved
functions of caspases is to execute cell death.7 Consequently, the loss
of ced-3 function leads to a block of all programmed death of somatic
cells in the worm. In an article on apoptotic caspases I have
summarised the in vivo and genetic evidence for the roles of individual
caspases in programmed cell death.17 I have included studies with C.
elegans and Drosophila caspases, along with the analyses of mammalian
caspase gene knockouts in mice and have attempted to discuss the
current understanding, controversies and unresolved issues relating to
the role of caspases in apoptosis. The article also provides a brief
description of the regulation of apoptotic caspases.

Recently it has become evident that some caspases, in addition to their
apoptotic and/or proinflammatory functions, also participate in cell
proliferation, differentiation and survival. For example DRONC, the key
cell death caspase in Drosophila, has been reported to have additional
functions in compensatory proliferation, border cell migration, neural
differentiation and spermatid individualisation, and caspase-8 in
mammals is required for proliferation of B, T and NK cells, and for the
differentiation of monocytes.18 Several studies now suggest that the
limited activation of some caspases often leads to a nonapoptotic
outcome whereas global activation of the same caspases results in
apoptosis. These topics and other caspases with nonapoptotic functions
are discussed in an article by Lamkanfi et al.18 The authors also
discuss how some caspases can induce NFB activation with or without
exerting their proteolytic function. They then provide a compilation of
'non-apoptotic' caspase substrates and discuss how the cleavage of
these substrates relates to the specific nonapoptotic functions of the
given caspases.

Initiator caspase activation is mediated by the large adaptor-caspase
complexes, often referred to as the apoptosomes.7, 10 In C. elegans
CED-3 is activated by a CED-4 complex, in Drosophila DRONC activation
occurs via recruitment to an ARK complex, whereas activation of
mammalian caspase-8 and -9 is mediated by the death-inducing signaling
complex (DISC) and the Apaf-1 apoptosome, respectively.19 The article
by Bao and Shi19 discusses these and the putative caspase-2 activation
complex (termed PIDDosome) in light of extensive structural data that
have recently become available. Authors also discuss various models of
initiator caspase activation by the caspase activation complexes.

The activated caspases target various proteins in order to carry out
their apoptotic or nonapoptotic functions. In addition to autocleaving
to self-activate in activation complexes (inflammasomes, apoptosomes
and PIDDosome), the main targets of initiator caspases are the effector
(downstream) caspases such as caspases-3, -6 and -7.7 Upon activation
these caspases mediate the cleavage of a large number of cellular
substrates. Timmer and Salvesen20 in their article on caspase
substrates point out that of the hundreds of published putative targets
of caspases only a few have been rigorously established as bona fide
substrates in vivo. They discuss that many of the proteins cleaved in
apoptotic cells probably represent innocent bystanders. They provide a
detailed view of substrate specificity of caspases, the role of
cleavage site conformation, caspase cleavage site prediction in
putative substrates and discuss the consequences of caspase-mediated
cleavage of key substrate proteins.

Many natural inhibitors of caspases are known, including several viral
and cellular proteins that either act as direct inhibitors of caspases
or block the activation of caspases.13 Use of these inhibitors has
played a major role in understanding caspase biology, enzymology and
function, in addition to providing opportunity for pharmacological
targeting of caspases in pathological conditions.7, 13 Callus and Vaux
focus on natural and synthetic inhibitors of caspases.21 In their
article the authors discuss various modes of caspase inhibition by
viral, cellular and chemical inhibitors. They also provide a
compilation of data on the efficacy of inhibition by various caspase
inhibitors and discuss the potential use of recently discovered small
molecule caspase inhibitors as pharmacological agents.

Overall these review summarise a vast amount of information relating to
caspase biochemistry, activation, regulation and function. I hope the
readers of Cell Death and Differentiation will find these reviews as an
up-to-date resource for information on caspase biology and function,
useful both for research and teaching purposes.
