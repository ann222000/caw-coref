Santa Fe 2004 V6 Valve tap

My Santa Fe has had a very intermittent valve tap.
Mostly occurs after car sat for a few days, long weekend.
I can start up sounding like the valve will come through the valve cover,
then quiets down.
Does not occur often, and I believe I can feel it as I drive the car.

2 dealers keep making like its nothing, and one even said they have heard
this on cars just started after shipment or after sitting in lot. They are
normalizing the problem.

They also keep indicating that their oil filter, which has a drain back
valve it, is significantly different and hold the oil pressure up in the
hydraulic valves better than any other OEM equiv filter. I'm sure there is
some truth to this oil filter theory.
but....
I have had this tap issue when using the dealer provided Hyundai filter, and
oil, or those provided from the Jiffy lube type places. So I can argue that
the Hyundai filter is NOT any better.

However. how can any design allow for such random valve tapping problem? I
can fathom that this is viewed as normal.

Is anyone else getting this tapping issue?

How often do you change the oil? I used to have a similar problem on a
Subaru (boxer engine). If the oil was not changed every 7500 kms or so, it
developed valve tapping.

Intresting thought....

I do change the oil at 3000 mile intervals. But what you mentioned may
indicate that it can be related to the oil quality or vicostity.....
Note: If these cars are doing this right from the factory, then I would
wonder if the factory recommend oil is not good enough.

I'm pretty much in agreement with the dealers' opinions.  When you turn the
engine off, some of the valves remain open, placing a significant amount of
pressure on the lifters.  This pressure on the lifters of the open valves
over a significant amount of time (days) will actually push some of the
oil out of the lifter and it will collapse a little bit, resulting in the
noise you hear.  On a start after an overnight sit, I would expect the
noise to go away after a minute or less.  After a several day sit, driving
a few miles may be necessary.  If the noise remains after the times
specified above, then I'd think you may have some sort of issue with oil
delivery to the lifters.  Lack of an anti-drainback valve in the filter
can grossly exaggerate this problem.

Interesting feedback.
Hyundaitech....you have answered many things in this forum, and I value your
honest technical answers. I appreciate your support. Please continue your
efforts in this forum.

I spoke in further detail with the service manager at my dealer. After
leaving the car with them for 2 weeks, they did manage to start and hear the
problem. In fact the service manager said he shut it off, and
restarted....and it flooded because one of the valves were stuck. He had to
restart holding the gas pedal down to the floor to clear the flooded
condition. At that time, I had a OEM equiv filter in the car.
I asked them to change the oil&amp;filter and retest. This time after a few days
of sitting, there was no valve tap.

As it was always a random occupancy, I am still not convinced.
Perhaps the bleedback/check valve does not hold pressure the same way in the
OEM equiv. filter?
check/drainback valves are common in OEM filters and the manf of these
filters are well aware of the valve req.
What are the detailed OEM specs on the drainback valve, so one can compare
with other filters?
Perhaps a combination of the Hyundai Ofilter &amp; quality of oil makes a
difference?

I think Hyundai needs to really dig into and identify this issue, and if any
damage to the car is happening because the valves don't open do to
hydrolytic pressure loss. I need to know that no damage will occur because
of pressure loss.....
Either way, Hyundai needs to make it clear, not obscure, that value tapping
will result and/or damage will occur if such &amp; such filters and oil are
used.....etc. A service bulletin should clarify, not cover up the
characteristic valve tap of this issue.

Anyway, I now have a Hyundai filter and Mobil 1 oil in the car and will be
listening at every restart.
I bought several Hyundai oil filters to keep on hand and will try a few
brand oils and see if there is any difference.

I will post my findings at a later date, meanwhile let me know if you have
any further details

After oil change and Hyundai filter, they didn't hear the issue

I purchaced a 2004 Santa Fe LX W/ 3.5 L, so far no problems @ 6000 miles.
The first Santa Fe I test drove had the same valve rapping problem, it
sounded really bad. I told the salesman that there had to be a problem with
the engine and he responded that he heard others that rapped the same way
and that they took the car back to the shop and did something to it to cure
the problem. The one I purchased has never tapped even after sitting for a
whole week. Using Mobil 1 5W30 W/ Hyundai filters

What you are hearing is valve lifter noise and not valve noise. Not
uncommon in any engine with hydraulic lifter if the engine has sat
long,: even overnight. The noise should go away though after a minute
or so when the lifter fills with oil. IMHO this is so common as to be
a non-issue and certainly no damage is done. ed

It sounds like the dealer may be onto something if the tap hasn't happened
again.  I'd continue monitoring.  Unfortunately Hyundai does not provide
any information on the relief valve in the filter.  An anti-drainback
valve is rather simple in that it only allows the oil to flow in one
direction.

You can pretty much trust that if this issue were causing significant
engine damage, Hyundai would be all over trying to find the cause.  That
would cost them lots of warranty dollars in a hurry.  In fact, Hyundai has
done a commendable job of monitoring quality and making design revisions to
prevent new parts from having the same problems as the old parts.

I've not seen any tsb's regarding the proper oil filter.  I agree it would
be much easier to determine what would be acceptable if Hyundai were to
openly publish the design specs.  But it's also not their responsibility
to test many of the aftermarket filters to see if they meet Hyundai's
requirements.  I've heard rumors about the really tiny Fram (and possibly
other brand) filters starving engines for oil, but my sources are very
doubtable, so at this point I hesitate to state that as fact.  I have no
problem using Fram filters on my personal vehicle as long as it is the
proper filter for my car.  I think it would be a good idea within the
warranty period to continue using the Hyundai filters.  That way, if
anything does happen, even if it's the fault of the filter, it will still
be warrantable.  If Hyundai believes an aftermarket filter to be at fault,
you'll have to fight just to see if you can get them to consider repair
under warranty.

The "valve" in the oil filter has nothing to do with holding the oil
pressure up in the hydraulicc lash adjusters(HLA) located way up in the
cylinder head. It just helps the oil reach the top of the engine
faster.

The design specs that would be of interest:
1.  Maximum flow through oil filter
2.  Amount of filter material
3.  Type of filter material
4.  Smallest particle which filter material will allow to pass
5.  Pressure at which bypass valve in filter opens
6.  Presence of anti-drainback valve.
That's what I can think of off the top of my head.

And off topic, I stopped reading and posting in the GM and Kia sections
because I was spending too much time on the newsgroup.  I cut it back to
something more manageable.  Are there people in those other groups who

Actually,  I posted in Hyundai, Kia, and anything GM with the probable
exception of Cadillac.  I was mainly posting there because those were my
areas of experience.  In August, 2003, I moved from an Olds/Kia dealership
to a multifranchise dealership where my primary responsibility was
diagnosis on the Hyundai product.  Olds was similar enought to many other
GM products that I could speak reasonably intelligently about the things
I'd experienced.

GM experience: 3.5 yrs
Kia experience: 6 yrs
Hyundai experience: 9 yrs

It's now been long enough since I've been away from GM and Kia that I
can't speak as to their new models.  Not only did I find that reading and
posting on so many boards took up too much time, I was also finding that I
was able to answer fewer and fewer questions.

Mr. Theta, (if that is your real name)... may I ask you a question? You seem
to have some sort of grudge against Hyundaitech; can you tell us the reason
for this? I'm just curious, because he seems to know what he's talking
about.

I don't think so buddy, there are many reasons or should I say
evidences that you're not here for true altruistic reasons.
I know many real-life working techs and they all LOATHE to deal with
shade-tree types. You know damn very well those types, those who come
up with their own diagnosis(parroting whatever people who they think
are credible say on Internet forums)and tell YOU what to do..ha ha..
That's probably the No. 1 reason why we don't see real working techs
post regularly on rec.autos.tech and other auto newsgroups in rec. or
alt. hierarchy. If you ask them to list 10,000 things they'd like to do
in their leisure time after the back-breaking hard day's work, helping
car owners on Usenet wouldn't make the list. and am i gonna believe
you're doing that inbetween repair orders on weekdays at work??????
please...
"hyundaitech", you're not gonna fool me into thinking you come here to
help other people...

There were two real Hyundai techs who I consider came here to really
want to assist Hyundai owners. One posted with real name and the other
was a devout Christian :) They didn't last long...one proof they didn't
come here with a hidden agenda, they just lost interest after a couple
of months...
Now what did they have in common?
They diddn't bother to identify themselves as a Hyundai tech 'cause
they couldn't care less whether other people thought thier opinions
were credible and didn't really give out their diagnosis readily on
scant problem descriptions...stark contrast to your M.O., so obivious
that you're only interested in building up credibility as some kind of
experienced Hyundai tech ...for what purpose?...

Regardless of the motivation, if you are really a 9-year hyundai tech,
you're a fucking joke, buddy...
Move to groups-beta.google.com/group/alt.autos.hyundai and read every
post i followed up to your replies in the last 6 months. god I love to
see you squirming to come up with some crummy excuses.

BTW, you haven't replaced a cabin air filter in 1999+ Sonata yet?

Considering I'm suffering from this problem (and a marbles-in-the-engine
sound when warmed up) I was hoping this thread might go somewhere.

Now its just another usenet penis war.

Sad.

Is the "marbles in engine" noise constantly present or does it occur only
at certain times, e.g. on acceleration?

Also, what engine do you have in your Santa Fe?

All times, most noticable at idle - its alarmingly loud.  Car otherwise
runs great, decent fuel economy, etc.  It 'sounds like' its coming from
the top rear cylinder head,

Noise still exists with the accessory belt removed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

2.7/4A/FWD-only.

Hard sound to isolate, sounds like its coming from the rear cylinder
head but that doesn't mean anything...

While I'm not necessarily alarmed at the tap on startup, I do find your
description of the noise when warm somewhat disturbing.  If you can't
readily identify what type of noise it sounds like (valve tap, etc), then
I'd urge you to take it to be checked.

Although I've not personally experienced this, I've heard reports of small
filters not allowing enough oil to pass.  If you think it's worthwhile, you
may wish to change your oil and filter (using a factory filter) and see if
it continues.  If you have the factory filter on, then the dealer has
difficulty blaming it on the filter if the noise continues.

I've also seen a couple isolated cases of timing chain wear on the alpha
and beta 4 cylinder dohc engines.  Your engine has a similar setup, with a
chain on each head joining the two camshafts.  If the chain gets too loose
or worn, it can start slapping the valve cover.

Oh, and I almost forgot.  I doubt this is it since it would be on the
front bank, but I've seen a case where the sheet metal shield under the
oil cap has been bent down to where it contacts moving parts on the head.
I surmise this occurs by jamming an oil delivery device into the hole.  I
haven't seen this on the 2.7, but I suppose it's possible.

Hey all,

Its been about 2 weeks since I started this thread.

Heres an update.
I have mobile 1 oil + the Hyundai filter since the service.

No more tap!
I had the car sit 3-4 days recently, and no Tap!

I doubt the dealer did anything to the car Striker mentioned. You only need
to run it for a few minutes to get the tapping to stop....It was probablly
sitting for a while before they started it.

I have the old filter, and plan to disect it to see if it is a cheap Fram or
lacks the valve.

&gt;&gt; I'm pretty much in agreement with the dealers' opinions.  When you
&gt; turn the
&gt;&gt; engine off, some of the valves remain open, placing a significant
&gt; amount of
&gt;&gt; pressure on the lifters.  This pressure on the lifters of the open
&gt; valves
&gt;&gt; over a significant amount of time (days) will actually push some of
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; oil out of the lifter and it will collapse a little bit, resulting in
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; noise you hear.  On a start after an overnight sit, I would expect
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; noise to go away after a minute or less.  After a several day sit,

&gt; No, it shouldn't take that long, &quot;hyundaitech&quot;.

&gt;&gt;driving
&gt;&gt; a few miles may be necessary.  If the noise remains after the times
&gt;&gt; specified above, then I'd think you may have some sort of issue with
&gt; oil
&gt;&gt; delivery to the lifters.  Lack of an anti-drainback valve in the
&gt; filter
&gt;&gt; can grossly exaggerate this problem.

The problem goes away after the engine is running a few minutes.
One or more of the lifters acts as if it is stuck, because there is no
pressure on a cold start.....after sitting for a few days.

Explain the HLA further. Are you saying there is some adjustment for valve
lash?
The dealer said there is no adjustment for the hydralic lifters.......

&gt;&gt; My Santa Fe has had a very intermittent valve tap.
&gt;&gt; Mostly occurs after car sat for a few days, long weekend.
&gt;&gt; I can start up sounding like the valve will come through the valve
&gt; cover,
&gt;&gt; then quiets down.
&gt;&gt; Does not occur often, and I believe I can feel it as I drive the car.

&gt;&gt; 2 dealers keep making like its nothing, and one even said they have
&gt; heard
&gt;&gt; this on cars just started after shipment or after sitting in lot.
&gt; They are
&gt;&gt; normalizing the problem.

&gt;&gt; They also keep indicating that their oil filter, which has a drain
&gt; back
&gt;&gt; valve it, is significantly different and hold the oil pressure up in
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; hydraulic valves better than any other OEM equiv filter. I'm sure

&gt; The &quot;valve&quot; in the oil filter has nothing to do with holding the oil
&gt; pressure up in the hydraulicc lash adjusters(HLA) located way up in the
&gt; cylinder head. It just helps the oil reach the top of the engine
&gt; faster.

&gt;&gt; there is
&gt;&gt; some truth to this oil filter theory.
&gt;&gt; but....
&gt;&gt; I have had this tap issue when using the dealer provided Hyundai
&gt; filter, and
&gt;&gt; oil, or those provided from the Jiffy lube type places. So I can
&gt; argue that
&gt;&gt; the Hyundai filter is NOT any better.

&gt;&gt; However. how can any design allow for such random valve tapping
&gt; problem? I
&gt;&gt; can fathom that this is viewed as normal.

&gt;&gt; Is anyone else getting this tapping issue?

&gt; Does it happen when the engine is at normal operating temp., idling?

I test drove that Santa Fe for about 1/2 hour and the tapping did not go
away also there was a burning smell coming from under the hood. Coating ?
What I said about the dealer doing something to stop the tap, came from a
salesman. Most likely B.S.
