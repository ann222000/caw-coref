The MSM would rather you forget about the recent terror arrest. They'd
rather focus your brain on the truly unimportant partisian stuff.

But fortunately my congressman is on it.

Bilirakis Questions Chertoff on Issues Surrounding USF Case

WASHINGTON (5 Sep.) -- During a House Homeland Security Committee hearing
Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.) questioned Homeland Security
Secretary Michael Chertoff on the wider security concerns raised in light of
the federal indictment of two foreign-born University of South Florida (USF)
students on explosives charges.

Last Friday, Youssef Megahed and Ahmed Mohamed were indicted by a federal
grand jury on explosive charges following their Aug. 4 arrest near a
military prison for enemy combatants in South Carolina. Both men are
Egyptian citizens; Mohamed in the U.S. on a student visa and Megahed a
permanent U.S. resident.

During Wednesday's hearing, Bilirakis pressed Chertoff on the number of
foreign students since September 11, 2001, who have enrolled in classes but
failed to attend.  He also inquired about the Department's ability to
monitor the actions of foreign students once in the country, and whether
there is proper coordination between all of the responsible federal agencies
on cases of this nature.

&quot;There remains considerable concern over how we approve, verify and track
foreign students entering this country on a visa,&quot; said Bilirakis following
the hearing.  &quot;Nearly all international students who enter this country on
student visas are here to learn. What I am concerned about is how we are
dealing with those few who have other intentions in mind.&quot;

Bilirakis also commented on reports that Mohamed had a criminal record in
Egypt prior to entering the United States on a student visa. &quot;It would be
very troubling if it is true that this student was improperly issued a visa
despite his criminal background, which could potentially make him ineligible
for admission,&quot; he said following the hearing.

Bilirakis asked Chertoff for a listing of specific criminal acts that would
preclude the issuance of a visa or deny entry into the United States of a
nonimmigrant foreign student.

In a letter sent to Chertoff on Wednesday, Bilirakis requested a full
briefing by appropriate DHS officials on the specifics of the USF case and
the related security issues it has raised.

&quot;I believe we must more closely examine the backgrounds of those seeking
student visas and then carefully monitor their activities once they have
entered the country to ensure that they have come here for legitimate
academic purposes,&quot; Bilirakis wrote. &quot;I would appreciate your efforts to
facilitate a briefing on this case and the related issues it raises for me
with the appropriate Department officials at the soonest possible time.&quot;
