This is the thrid time it has happened. For some reason, his nose gets
irritated, and he rubs it on everything, causing bleeding. There is
blood on everything from his rubbing, blankets, sofa, rug. I am taking
him to the vet tonight.

What I am wondering is because this is the third time it has happened,
and the vet is yet to completely fix the problem, should I be charged
the full amount for her to see him.

Last time they gave him meds, which seemed to work for a while, but
then it came back.
If I am charged for eveytime this happens it will cost a fortune.

Should I be charged everytime I go to the vet for the same problem
they have not fixed? It is the same bleeding issue as last time, yet
they will do a consult, and charge me for something they already have
seen.

What are your experiences with vets in a case like this? In a way I am
feeling scammed.

I like my vet, I am not assigning blame to anyone here, but what stops
a vet from not fully fixing a pet, so you are stuck going back
numerous time, fixing the same issue over and over again?

Thanks in advance.

Tim

&gt; Why do you think the is dog reinjuring itself (potentially because of auto-
&gt; immune issues -a life-long problem-potentially but not necessarily
&gt; treatable problem; because of behavior issues; because of genetic problems)
&gt; If the dog is doing things that re-injures itself, Why are you blaming the
&gt; vet?
&gt; Has the vet explored auto-immune issues? Or genetic issues?- Hide quoted text -

">

The dog loves to burry his nose in the snow and ice, in the summer he
burrys his nose in the dirt, basically anywhere he can. I think either
he has a small cut or maybe a dermatitis like thing going on, which
causes it to be irritable, and he scratches  it and rubs it on
everything. Now I am not a vet, so I dont know what it is. If you have
poison ivy, you want to scratch, if you scratch hard enough, you will
bleed, I am presuming it is like the same thing. I would say the dog
is reinjuring itself on purpose, the injury stems from the scratchig
and rubbing.

I take him to the vet, she says its almost like little pimples, gives
him meds, and charges $$$ for the consult. I bring him back to the vet
when it occurs again, she says the same thing, gives him meds, and
charges $$$ for the consult.
If I bring him back to the vet tonight, and she does the same thing,
should I be charged all this $$$? I could tell you that it is the same
as last time.

Also, did you not read the post?I said I am not assigning blame to
anyone. What I am asking is when do you call it enough if you being
charged for the same thing over and over again.

"Has the vet explored auto-immune issues? Or genetic issues?" No she
hasnt.

&gt; Yes, It's not your doc's fault that the dog keeps injuring itself. I would
&gt; find a method to stop the dog from doing that, even if it had to wear a
&gt; basket muzzle to protect it's nose.

&gt; FWIW, I have a puppy who loves to eat bird droppings. He's not been sick
&gt; from it, but he might get that way. I just purchased a muzzle to stop him
&gt; from doing that. It's a lot cheaper than vet bills.

&gt; I used to have a doberman with Von Willebrauns. It's a genetic disease. Any
&gt; time she bled, it was life threatening.  I had many vet bills with her that
&gt; an ordinary dog wouldn't have. It was not my vet's fault (or hers) that she
&gt; had a life threatening disorder.
&gt; I was at work, She caught her toenail in the fabric of a sofa. She bled to
&gt; death while I was at work (while I believed she was safe at home)
&gt; Any prick, or bleeding incident, or bruising incident was life threatening.
&gt; She involved many very expensive emergency treatments.
&gt; VERY expensive dog to have. Never once did I feel the vet should give me a
&gt; volume discount for being seen for the same condition.
">

You are so right, I am going to muzzle him at home from now on, save
my house from getting blood everywhere too.

More or less, I am questioning the vets right to charge me everytime I
go in for something, even though she looked at the same problem a few
months ago.

Any experiences with vets being like shady car mechanics?

If I take my dog to one vet, she give hime meds and says its
dermatitis. Then I take him to another vet and they say he has
something more serious, is the first vet liable for any wrong doing
because he or she was lazy, or wanting more money due to having to go
back to the vet more? This is all hypothetical of course.

How do you know when you are done wrong by your vet.

Here's what's weird to me:

You want to be able to keep on letting your dog do something that is
clearly injuring her, but you want to vet to subsidize it by cutting you
slack on the vet bills?

At what point does it become somewhat your responsibility to stop your
dog from injuring herself?

If I had a long term health issue that my personal doctor couldn't cure
(especially if some of my own behavior was possibly a contributing
factor), would I be right in expecting that my doctor not charge me for
future visits on that topic unless he or she was able to "cure" it after
the first two? That would, in my opinion, be unreasonable. And it seems
also unreasonable to expect your vet to do that as well.

With that said, my vet will sometimes consider multiple visits on the
same topic a "follow-up" visit, with either no charge for the visit, or
a reduced fee for it....but a Follow-up visit is when the issue crops up
again withint days or a couple of weeks within the original visit. If
its been months in between an issue croppin up, neither me nor my vet
would consider that a "follw-up", even if its the same, long term issue.

My last dog was weird. He had an obsession with digging at rocks under
water. When we'd drive him to the lake, he'd try to dig at rocks
underwater for hours. I realized that it was more than just "weird" but
an actual problem when he dug so hard, he filed his own nails past the
quick and bled for ages afterwar one visit. Trip to the vet to make sure
he hadn't done damage, and check his pads. Yeah, he's hurt his pads as
well. If I had let him, he would have done that on every trip. This is
not my vet's responsibility, its mine.

It sounds like your dog has some itchy acne like problems *and* a
tendancy to rub her nose around in everything. I have no idea if the
latter is causing the former, but you might want to look into that. Even
if not, not everything is "cured", and its not your vet's job to
subsidize your pet's health issue. I tend to break out if I don't get
regular glycolic peels. I don't get to make my doctor give them to me
for free simply because the first three didn't "fix it". Its an ongoing
problem that is managed in an ongoing manner. But I'm not going to
expect my doctor to wave the wand or pay for future visits.

I see what you are saying.

It is not like I allow my dog to do this. It is not really something I
can prevent, unless I want to muzzle him 100% of the time. I go to
work, he is fine, come home and the top of his nose is bleeding.Would
you muzzle your dog if he wasnt rubbing or scratching? Why would I?

Why are you trying to assign blame here? I am not blaming anyone. I am
not trying to "handoff" responsibility either.
Do you really think I am allowing my dog to injure itself?

Does anyone here agree with me that vets can be shady, immoral, money
hungry? Of course, they are human too. Police officers, car mechanics,
doctors can all be shady.

Is it possible that a vet can purposely mis-diagnose a problem so you
have to constantly go back and pay for consul fees?

A friend of mines dog had Rose Gardners disease, they paid thousands
of dollars trying to figure out what was wrong. Rose gardners disease
was mentioned, and the vet more or less said impossible. So they
continued spending lots of money trying to figure out what the
problems was. Weeks later, and after a new vet, the dog was diagnosed
with Rose Gardners disease.

Is the vet somewhat liable? Could he or she have "missed" the Rose
Gardens on purpose to make more $$$?

Its not a question of blame, its a question of is the vet being moral
and proffesional.

My first vet wouldnt do a neuter without a ecko-cardio gram because of
a murmur. Which at the time we couldnt afford, it was going to cost a
bundle.
I then took my dog to my current vet, and she said the murmur was not
bad, she had done neutering on many dogs with murmurs and he will be
fine. Surgery was done, dog dig fantastic, and a lot of money was
saved.
I have spoken to many people about this and we all ahve agreed, that
the vet may have been thinking in the dogs best favour, yet they were
also thinking of the $$ too.

You want to be able to keep on letting your dog do something that is

Perfect! Would you go to your doctor, after him/her telling you what
you already know (that you need regular glycolic peels) and pay him
for that.

If the doctor told me I have bad skin, its going to cost you 100$ for
the diagnosis, and 50$ for the meds.
A month later you go to the doctor because of your bad skin again, and
he asks for another 100$ for the exact same diagnosis.
Of course not, just because a month has gone by means nothing. He
might perscribe meds, which is fine, but to expect a fee for the same
diagnosis is crazy.

Why should you think your vet is accountable for your dog's actions? We
never said you were abusing or neglecting your dog.

If the vet is CAUSING these incidents (which it doesn't sound like your vet
is) then you have an issue.

It sounds as if your vet is simply treating each incident as responsible to
do. The fact that your dog keeps doing recurring behaviors is not your vets
responsibility. She treats, and charges you a resulting bill.

I don't see the problem here

an irritant, doesn't fix anything.  Most likely an allergy.

Scatching and itching........two things here either he is allergic to
something which I've never seen to this extent or he can't feel things
properly with his nose and that is why he keeps injuring it.  I'm leaning
more towards the 2nd.

I had a lab mix who when she started to develop vestibular disease would rub
her face and dig at her nose with her paws.  These were classic signs of
this disease developing.  She did the nose scratching and digging at her
face on and off for over two years before the disease became full blown.
The initial signs are subtle and you may not even realize what's going on.
I know I certianly didn't.  I just chalked it up to allergies and old age.
Once the disease became full blown she lost all feeling on the one side of
her face and actually big through her lip because she just couldn't feel it.
Along with the numbness came a droopy eye and eventually she couldn't blink

multiple times a day to keep her eye hydrated.

Talk to your vet about vestibular disease and this ask him if this might not
be what's happening here it sure sounds like it to me.

&gt;&gt; Why do you think the is dog reinjuring itself (potentially because of
&gt;&gt; auto-
&gt;&gt; immune issues -a life-long problem-potentially but not necessarily
&gt;&gt; treatable problem; because of behavior issues; because of genetic
&gt;&gt; problems)
&gt;&gt; If the dog is doing things that re-injures itself, Why are you blaming
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; vet?
&gt;&gt; Has the vet explored auto-immune issues? Or genetic issues?- Hide quoted
&gt;&gt; text -

&gt;&gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; The dog loves to burry his nose in the snow and ice, in the summer he
&gt; burrys his nose in the dirt, basically anywhere he can. I think either
&gt; he has a small cut or maybe a dermatitis like thing going on, which
&gt; causes it to be irritable, and he scratches  it and rubs it on
&gt; everything. Now I am not a vet, so I dont know what it is. If you have
&gt; poison ivy, you want to scratch, if you scratch hard enough, you will
&gt; bleed, I am presuming it is like the same thing. I would say the dog
&gt; is reinjuring itself on purpose, the injury stems from the scratchig
&gt; and rubbing.

&gt; I take him to the vet, she says its almost like little pimples, gives
&gt; him meds, and charges $$$ for the consult. I bring him back to the vet
&gt; when it occurs again, she says the same thing, gives him meds, and
&gt; charges $$$ for the consult.
&gt; If I bring him back to the vet tonight, and she does the same thing,
&gt; should I be charged all this $$$? I could tell you that it is the same
&gt; as last time.

&gt; Also, did you not read the post?I said I am not assigning blame to
&gt; anyone. What I am asking is when do you call it enough if you being
&gt; charged for the same thing over and over again.

&gt; &quot;Has the vet explored auto-immune issues? Or genetic issues?&quot; No she
&gt; hasnt.

The fee isn't for a diagnosis. That's not how doctors work. If you think
it is, then I guess I could see how you'd misunderstand the whole

You seemed to for a minute, but then you rapidly verred off into "Vets

I'd likely spend time (and yes, money) having my vet do tests to rule
out what it *isn't*, and hopefully end up finding out what it *is*. And
yes, that would cost me money. And no, I wouldn't expect a hefty
discount from my vet because I ended up with a dog with health problems.

If it turned out to be NOT biologically sourced, I'd totally start
training my dog, and approaching this from a behavioral angle. If it
isn't caused by a physical issue, then its likely a behavioral one.
Could be stress, could be seasonal allergies. Could be an OCD behavior,
could be a reaction to a certain fabric softener you uise every so
often.

To assume that the only thing you could do is either slap a muzzle on
your dog, or expect your vet to subsidize this whole thing seems pretty
simplistic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Actually, by showing up and insinuating that your vet is being
"shady....underhanded" and "misdiagnosing on purpose", I'd say you're
doing an excellent job of trying to blame. Just because you say "I'm not
trying to blame" doesn't mean you actually aren't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Do you really think I am allowing my dog to injure itself?
">

How could I know? Your replies suggest that, while you don't intend to
let her injure herself, you might ultimately be doing just that. There
are a lot more ways of dealing with the situation than throwing your
hands up and saying that if you can't slap a muzzle on your dog, there
must be nothing you can do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Does anyone here agree with me that vets can be shady, immoral, money
&gt; hungry? Of course, they are human too. Police officers, car mechanics,
&gt; doctors can all be shady.
">

That's irrelevant here. Being a shady vet and being a vet that is
actually charging you a few times a year for something you yourself
didn't see fit to do anything about are completely different things. You
tossing it in here seems like a red herring.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Is it possible that a vet can purposely mis-diagnose a problem so you
&gt; have to constantly go back and pay for consul fees?

Is it possible? Of course. Is it likely that's what's happening here?
Not really.

Oh, and how does the above statement fit in with your "I'm not trying to
blame anyone" world view?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A friend of mines dog had Rose Gardners disease, they paid thousands
&gt; of dollars trying to figure out what was wrong. Rose gardners disease
&gt; was mentioned, and the vet more or less said impossible. So they
&gt; continued spending lots of money trying to figure out what the
&gt; problems was. Weeks later, and after a new vet, the dog was diagnosed
&gt; with Rose Gardners disease.

&gt; Is the vet somewhat liable? Could he or she have &quot;missed&quot; the Rose
&gt; Gardens on purpose to make more $$$?
">

Its far more likely that he in fact thought it was very unlikely. Would
you have prefered that he do a bunch of extra tests for things he didn't
realy think it was? Would that suddenly make him *less* shady?

Vets walk a tight line on this one. Some people don't want to pay for
extensive testing to get a definitive diagnosis, and would accuse a vet
that does that of trying to jack up the vet bill with unnecessary
testing. Other people want the tests, and are willing to pay for them,
and consider a more hands-off vet (one who doesn't do $100 tests for
everything) to be quacks....especially if something turns out to be a
longer term issue that requires many visits.

So, if you find that you're a certain kind of person that prefers a
scertain style of vetting, then *you* need to go find a vet that suits
your needs. But to imply someone else is "shady" and trying to jack up a
bill simply because they haven't magically discerned what's wrong with
your dog in the...what....three visits over the last year is just wrong,
imo.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Sorry. But you're insinuating that this is something your vet is somehow
supposed to take financial responsibility for. If you're going to do

Sounds like the issue is with spending the money.

But, if you really think your vet is a criminla, then I'd find another

The doctor charges what the doctor wants. Don't like it call another vet and
ask for quotes.

#1 A good vet will reevaluate a patent when they are not sure what is
causing the problem. It helps find the reason. Since you are not a vet you
do not know what they are thinking or what sanaryo's they are playing
through their head.

#2 If you think you are paying too much call another vet and try to see what
they would charge you.They will tell you one of two things. You will have to
bring your dog in for the vet to see for that answer or they will give you a
really rough estimate and you may be irritated if the bill ends up higher
than estimated.

My concern is why haven't you had blood work done, a biopsy done or other
tests. Why are you not rubbing vitamin E cream and some other vet approved
goop on her nose to relieve the ovioce dry condition that is causing it to
blister up and itch like the dickens. Dogs noses are made to shove into
things and get dirty and they have mouths with a tongue that cleans it off.
If something is causing an irritation you as her adopted parent need to log
what she has had her nose into, so you can see, what could be causing the
problem and keep her out of it. If your child were getting blisters on her
nose and it was bleeding you would question her as to what happened, but
your child can not speak. So you as her father you must find it and
eliminate it not matter what the bill is.

No amount of debate will change the fact you just don't like to pay the
office visit cost. You have to pay a copay and what not every time you see a
human doctor as well. Just to see the doctor costs, not even to evaluate
you, just to let you sit in their waiting room costs. If you don't think so
look at your bill.

Took my guy to the vet. Vet said good chance it is allergies. I am
supposed to give him Benadryl. I asked if the scratching and rubbing
is a big deal, vet said no, once you give him the Benadryl his will
slow down or stop. She also said it is very hard to figure out what
the dog is allergic too, she said to gradually take away toys to see
if it is the toys (kong, plastics, etc.), this will take a while but
she said we might just figure out what it is.

She was going to charge me for a full consult, I asked if I couid be
charged for a follow up because I have been to the vet before for the
same issue, she agreed I should not be paying full because I was there
a few months prior for the same thing.

I am not gloating, but I was right, she agreed I am correct. They
tried to charge me full until I spoke up. Thats all I wanted.

The vet also said there was nothing I can do about the rubbing. A
muzzle might agravate it more, an Elizabethan collar wont do any good,
and I cant be there all day to give him Benadryl.

I also told the vet how the most of you are jumping on me saying I am
allowing my dog to injure itself. She laughed, and said "its a dog,
its what they do, like most people with pets, you cannot spend 24
hours a day with an eye on them".

I want to thank you all for your replies.I hold no grudge and am glad
all of you replied.
I feel good that I was 100% in the right and have done nothing wrong.

Didn't think so.

Since that was the ONLY thing I had a major problem with (and the thing

No need for sour grapes Tara. I can freely admit when I am wrong, as
for you, sounds like you cannot.

"Did you mention to your vet that people were jumping on your for
insinuating that she was shady and trying to misdiagnose on purpose
in
order to charge you mer?"

As for this. I actually did mention this. I told her that I do not
know when I am being taken for a ride when it comes to vets ( I told
her not necessarily her, but vets in general which includes her), much
like doctors and car mechanice. She told me that the public should be
on the lookout for these types of vets, they are not as rare as people
think. She also said overcharging is quite common especially when it
comes to meds and some pet owners really dont know any better so they
do not speak up. She did mention that my previous vet was know for
trying to doing to much, almost over-doing it. This was in a very rich
well-to-do part of town, which might be the reason.

Now..for you Tara. Why are you attacking me? I never attacked you. I
never misrepresented anything.

You seem like a lovely person.  I'll bet flowers dip their

to the creatures of this world but to heaven above, as well.
Indeed, your words will ring through the centuries, and

recognize you as a prophet and the Christian ones as a
saint, and the pious will hang your image in their homes,

No, actually, I haven't, but to be honest I'm not surprised
you have.  Find a good vet and establish an ongoing

anything else, for that matter.  If you're trying to

Please explain....or better yet, provide direct quotes...exactly where I
"attacked" you to that level. Actually, I'd like to see where I attacked
you at even remotely *near* the level you just went to.

I'm really not shy when it comes to throwing around personal insults and ad
hom attacks when needed (comes from a very strong personality peppered with
growing up on the streets of NY), so- trust me on this- if I had
"attacked" you on even NEAR the level you just went to, it would have been
clear as day.

You mentioned that you specifically said to your vet "Not you, of
course"....well, what bullshit, since it was *her* that you were suggesting
was padding the bill.

Plenty of people suggested talking to your vet about the charges. Plenty of
people sufggested at the very *least* finding out what you could do to
prevent this (and you did....turns out a benedryl once in a while will
probably do the trick....now there's something you can actually do here to
help your dog. Who could have figured that? Oh wait....most of the people
who responded to you did.)

Whatever. I'm glad your dog doesn't have to keep bleeding in any case.
