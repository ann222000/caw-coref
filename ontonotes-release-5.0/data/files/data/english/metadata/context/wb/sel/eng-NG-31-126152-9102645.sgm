I am sitting at the hospital with an attendee that has a racing
heartbeat and pulse.  He is from the UK, and is scheduled to fly out
tonight [not now, for sure].  He did not contact me when he called the
receptionist for a TAXI to get to the hospital, and the front desk
didn't call to tell me he had done that.  He also left the hotel without
his passport.

Remember:

Remind [or tell them to begin with] them, as is in my
conference resume, that if there is an emergency with any of your
attendees that you want to be notified immediately.

Tell your hotel staff at the precon that anyone with chest
pain or issues goes in an AMBULANCE to the hospital, not a taxi.

Remind your attendees to keep ID on them at all times,
especially if they are from another country.  This gentleman did have
his wallet, which served in a pinch.

If you have to go to the hospital, grab your printed [hope
you do this] sheet of ICE contact #'s and info for all of your
attendees.

If the attendee is conscious, you may want to ask them to
sign permission that you may be in the room, or have information
regarding medications given so that you can have a record, if the person
cannot remember, and when instructions are given, that you be allowed to
hear them.

Give the nurse your business card with your cell # on it.

There is more I'd like to add, but they are calling for me - read Julia
Silvers!

I also understand that visitors from overseas, (Europe in particular),
should apply for medical coverage in their home nation, before they travel.
The EU and/or many National Governments have reciprocal arrangements to
cover emergency medical treatment in the USA. Before I relocated to the USA
for good, in 2000, I always applied for the relevant coverage forms, and/or
took out personal medical insurance cover as a back up. This worked well for
me, although I personally never had to use it.

Sometimes, medical emergencies can also occur from seemingly innocuous
conditions. A few years ago, we held a convention in a northern city
known for its 2-week &quot;mosquito season.&quot; One of our new staff members
was a very recent transplant from the UK. We went to an outdoor event
one evening and were all battling the mosquitos---but the new staff
member had never been exposed to mosquitos before (!). She developed
an allergic reaction and had to be taken to the hospital. She was kept
overight and was fine the next day, but one never knows...
