Screwball and screwy, apparently.

Anyone claiming the points for those?

Nobody can.  Much like patents, you can't score points if
the words are obvious to someone skilled in the art (of English

Did you?  You show up in what was once a perfectly civilized

little of what you post has anything to do with the topic of
the newsgroup, or contributes anything of value.  Yet you continue
to flood the group incessantly.

Incidentally, I recall one commentator saying in his piece, ... and the

but for some reason I thought, Hang on, When my computer goes into standby

Did you not learn when to  keep your own council, as they used to say, how
to be discreet etc.

Some things  are not required to be aired. If you need input for every facet
of your life an cannot make decisions, then don't bite the head off of

I apologized for dumping my grief on the newsgroup.
What is it going to take for you to see my apology?
I am sorry for bringing my grief to this newsgroup.
See that?
It has nothing to do with this or that newsgroup. It has to do with the
fact that I was in denial about my grief. I have changed. Have you?
Doesn't look like it. I have pulled back. Have you? Nope. Still going on

Listen. I will say again. I am in grief because of my divorce. I was in
denial. I dumped it on the Internet. I apologize. That was a mistake. I
know I can not make all of you forgive me, but I am telling you the truth.
It is really very simple.
My divorce has to do with religion and relationships, hence the posting
where I did.
I have regained control, ie, awareness of what happened.
That is no excuse for my foul behavior, but an explanation of what
happened, and, a statement that I have stopped.
People change. I always do.

Ok, you are right, as Troia misconstrues almost everything I say, and
Renate is obsessed with bashing me... perhaps this is the solution.

I tried Barrister's 10 a day... that didn't really work. Since a couple
of men don't have a problem with you, perhaps if I took your advice,
those two men might be happier. Let's see how it goes! I aim to please.
I wrote down your instructions, and shall try to apply them in the morning.

I think in my case that is going to mean only responding to certain
posters and ignoring the rest... I am enjoying my conversation with Ty
immensely, so I think I will keep the focus on that.

Let me know how I do!

This shall be an interesting exercise in self discipline to say the least!

Oye Vey...  Barrister apparently wasn't up to snuff; so she's back to
TC is her "master" (again, until he ticks her off, again).

Nope as of today I accept truly clooful as my master, come rain or
shine. Barrister was never my master. He was always my friend. Truly
clooful was always my master.
I disagree with your point of view about the sub taking responsibility
for the consequences of the dom's decisions. Strongly. We are discussing
that elsewhere as you know. I shall be debating this with you.
I disagree with your point of view, Renate, and you are not my dominant,
therefore I do not have to obey you. I have to obey Truly Clooful.

We don't bloody care who your master is or isn't.  We care about
your flooding the newsgroup.

Please restrain yourself to only a few on-topic posts per day.
I recommend the limit of five that you said yesterday you'd do.

Care to tell her to stop posting (again) oh masterlysir TC?

LOL... Wonderful!  Please debate from that perspective.  Oh, PLEASE
do!  There are folks waiting (elsewhere) with baited breath, for you
to fly your colors.

Bless her heart.  As much as she has to remind herself that I'm not
her dominant, you'd think that eventually it would sink in.

10' poles, surgical gloves, and all that.

I will when I am ready. I am not planning to be laughed at. I shall be
flying my master's colors, and I am not ready to do so yet. I must study
that thread very closely. Someone mentioned something somewhere else
today about your point of view that caught my attention.
I do not enjoy debating, so I am going to go about this a different way.
I might try it out there before I try it out here, for my master is here
and not there. This is the performance venue, that is the dress rehearsal.
