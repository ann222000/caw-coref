No need to worry Bill.  Lincoln established the &quot;legal&quot; precedent:
submit or be killed. You, through the guvmint you delegated, can just
kill anyone who refuses to give you your &quot;federal&quot; (supreme national)
check and entitlements.  That's what you're really worried about.

If someone else can't be made to pay for your fuckups, why then, what
the hell kind of country has this become?

Ballots are bullets.

-----------------
The O isn't for On, it is for Off.

Since you didn't OT it, people are going to think this is some amusing
Big Mouth Lemond thread.  How dissappointing.  I have point out that I
am almost never the asswipe who starts this shit.

I even tried to be a real participant in the on-topic hot lady biker
thread.  See how I try?  Then Bob tried on his new name Dick.  I'm
sorry, I never meant the anti-cool-cool thing in any serious way -- I
don't even believe it, and I don't care that much about the shape of a
bike frame.  I'll never fit in here.  That is comforting.

The heck with that crap. How about this:

http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3686073&amp;page;=1

&quot;That makes $7.5 million in six months, almost all of it in 'small'
donations.&quot;
http://www.freemarketnews.com/WorldNews.asp?nid=49760

_The GOP Plot to Defeat Ron Paul_
&quot;Yes, it seems clear. The GOP - whose Old Guard core has been revealed
to be as expansionistic and spendthrift as its Democratic 'opponents'
-- would rather ensure Ron Paul's defeat than win a national
presidential election.&quot;
http://www.freemarketnews.com/WorldNews.asp?nid=49739&amp;fb;=1

So make a deal with the devil.  Get democrats to register republican
for the primaries (vote for Paul) and have the joy of stuffing the neo-
cons in the waste-bin where they belong.  Better do it soon -- the
poli-bosses don't want to lose their power.

Well Kyle they should be easy to skip as there aren't that many. This
one which could've been added intothe  Big News thread in which I made
4 posts out of 53 and didn't start, and the Canadian one in which was
a joke aimed at Jim and some of the other non-american Canadians in
which I made 3 posts out of 27.
How about you start some topics on things we haven't beaten to death
like Landis, doping, the governing bodies, etc...which seem to do
well. Otherwise the threads directly tied to racing don't seem to go
very far these days.
I'm sort of following the Bruyneel to Asatana thing and think that
could get really interesting, not from a racing point of view, but
from a Kazakh government vs. the UCI, Wada, Coni, point of view before
it's over.
Please start some threads. I'd love to have more in depth information
than I'm picking out of Radsport news than we are getting on the
actual situation with racing, and the political mindset in Germany
right now. How about filling us in since you're there in the middle of
it? How's it effecting the local teams, clubs, and races? What are
they doing towards monitoring amateurs and u-23 and below? etc...

If things go the way the US expansionists want, &quot;we'll&quot; be annexing/
invading Canada sometime this century.  They got tar sands!  Diamonds
too, I hear.

Besides, Canada is a vast cold wasteland now, but given the nice
effects of AGW, it'll soon be prime real estate.  I don't know what

Dumbass,

Have you looked at the value of the Canadian dollar
versus our scrip currency lately?  They're more likely
to successfully buy us than we are to successfully
invade them.  While global warming would make a US
assault on Canada less likely to get bogged down in
winter like the Germans in Russia, it also makes
Michigan tropical beachfront property attractive to
Torontan real estate speculators looking to build
resort condos.  I only wish I was young enough to
look forward to a future as a cabana boy for our
new Canadian overlords.

Hey Steve
The reason I picked those groups in particular is from hearing
stories from people I know racing in both Germany and Italy who have
said that the doping in high level amateur stuff is right in the open
and subject for jokes. They have also said that especially with
serious Jr prospects being groomed by some of the feeder clubs and
development teams hat they experiment to find the most effective
doping programs for the individuals for most of the year since testing
is only done at a few national level events. The rest of the year is a
laboratory.

Good report. I agree that it can be hard to pace yourself on early climbs (or
parts of climbs) if there are a bunch of other people going varying speeds. It can be
easy to go too fast too soon and you pay for that later.

Tom I'm not expecting them to do testing, as you point out it's way
too expensive. I was curious, with all the screaming they are doing,
just what they WERE doing in these areas. Almost everyone I've heard
from has said that it's huge and in the open, especially in &quot;masters&quot;
type stuff and the &quot;tourist races&quot;. One friend who raced in Italy for
a few years was absolutely amazed at the sudden change in speed at
times during the season. He was told by the club trainer that he
needed to get with a good program and they'd set him up like everyone
else.
I've heard similar stories from a batch of people. Disposable income,
huge egos, second childhood, middle age, etc... makes a nice mix for
doping.
I don't know anyone involved but I'd bet it's the same with soccer,
rugby, etc...anything where niddle agers are fighting time. It was
ridiculous in the gym.

Different strokes for different folks I guess. We had no problems

Keynes didn't allege that minerals acted in concert like he alleged
&quot;animals&quot; do.

&quot;Nevertheless the theory of output as a whole, which is what the
following book purports to provide, is much more easily adapted to the
conditions of a totalitarian state, than is the theory of production
and distribution of a given output produced under conditions of free
competition and a large measure of laissez-faire.&quot; --  Keynes, p.
xxvi, Collected Writings

&quot;The policies he advocated were precisely those which almost all
governments, including the British, had already adopted many years
before his 'General Theory' was published. Keynes was not an innovator
and champion of new methods of managing economic affairs. His
contribution consisted rather in providing an apparent justification
for the policies which were popular with those in power in spite of
the fact that all economists viewed them as disastrous. His
achievement was a rationalization of the policies already practiced.&quot;

At a simple level (which is about all I'm capable of), I don't think
so, all other things equal.  I think it is more that some amount of
government debt goes into that black hole called the Fed.  Page 23 has
them having swallowed ~$800 B of debt on that audit. If I remember my
money stuff, if they injected $800 B, then that gets multipled by the
money multiplier.  Say the fractional reserve requirements are 10%.
Then the $800 B purchase (over a long time, of course) injected up to
$8 T into the world economy.  (Banks obviously are not required to
lend out down to the reserve requirement level.) Basically, the Fed
purchasing government debt is &quot;printing money.&quot;  Holding all other
things equal, then a greater number of dollars than before will mean
it will take more dollars to buy any given thing, including &quot;buying&quot;
other currencies.  That is an inflation of the currency, or just
inflation.  It is a depreciation of the inflated currency relative to
other steady currencies.

Now I don't know how much, if any, government debt has been retired
while in the Fed's asset column.  I also don't know how reserve
requirements have changed over time.  I don't know the estimates for
the total stock of money or how it has changed over time. But I don't
think there is any doubt that there are more dollars running around
than there were before.  (There is more stuff  to spend money on, and
more people to spend it too, which would tend to hide the monetary
inflation.)  When compared to other currencies then, the differential
of inflation change between them would seem to point to a changing
exchange rate between them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Pouring money into a hole can result in a budget deficit.
">

If the hole is the Fed, then I can't see where it works like a deficit
anymore from a practical perspective.  Fed profits on the debt are
simply paid back into the Treasury by law, so all there is left there
is operating expenses.  (Neat little trick, eh?)  I don't know that
the debt ever needs to come back out again.  And even if there is a
retirement requirement for that debt, I can't see how it would
matter.  (Say a bond/debt came due for a Fed holding, I think it can
just be circulated back into the Fed by issuing new debt to pay for
the old.)  The deficit is unloaded to the &quot;late&quot; takers of the
dollars, domestic and foreign.  It is effectively a tax since their
dollars will buy less.  The further from the point of injection, the
worse.

Pouring money into some other hole is not a deficit of money, per se.
It is lost opportunity (productivity) in other areas. &quot;Guns or
butter?&quot; is the famous simple PPF phrase.  It depends upon what action
it took to pour money into the hole.  If &quot;one&quot; has the assets, then
the cost could just be paid without encurring debt.

The only hope at all is to &quot;grow out of the debt.&quot;  But that means
discontinuing the running up of debt right now.  If you can stick the
debt where it is, but have an economy that gets bigger in purportion,
then the debt problem gets relatively lessened.  It also means policy
that does not retard growth.

Naturally, even the Fed can't keep up with the debt-based spendthrift
ways of the republicans.  Everyone calls Ron Paul crazy for saying it
has to stop.

Apparently China is sitting on a lot of dollars.  If that is true,
then if they start spending those other dollars, and the takers of the
dollars don't hold them, then it works just like another injection of
cash.  That would be seen as another round of inflation for the
dollar.

&quot;Currently, China holds over $1 trillion in dollar denominated assets
(of which $330 billion are U.S. Treasury notes). In comparison, $1.4
trillion represents M1 or the 'tight money supply' of U.S. Dollars
which suggests that the value of the U.S. Dollar could change
dramatically should China ever choose to divest itself of a large
portion of those reserves.&quot;

It is this increasing the actual currency faster than the net worth of the

I think ceteris paribus, no.  A differential in the interest rates
would be due to _future_ expectations of _further_ differentials in
the money printing activities (and other policy like reserve
requirements) between the two currency generating entities.

Interest rates, minus the ever-present money mischief by currency
generating entities (and fractional reserve determinates), are
determined by time preferences.  The higher the time preference, the
higher the interest rate.

_THE THEORY OF MONEY AND CREDIT_, BY LUDWIG VON MISES

Also, I had written &quot;The deficit is unloaded to the 'late' takers of
the
dollars, domestic and foreign.&quot;  That was okay in the context of the
paragraph, but minus the money printing activites of a central bank,
deficits are borne by future taxes (tax payers), not per se the &quot;late&quot;
note takers.

Smartass,

I'm not knowledgeable enough about High Finance
to give you an answer in terms of M1, money supply,
and reserve requirements.  I look at it this way.
The dollar is like a stock.  The company is the
United States.  (Actually, the dollar is literally
a bond, not a stock.)  Its value depends on what
you think the financial prospects of the issuer are,
and that depends on a variety of things like the
balance sheet, the potential of the company or country's
investments, and the quality of its management.
Lots of countries own dollars, but the choice of
whether to own dollars or, say, Euros, is driven
by what they think the future prospects of the
dollar are (circularly).

The dollar is like anything else - it's worth what
somebody is willing to pay for it and no more.
(Defining value narrowly as monetary - my grandfather's
Army bible and copy of Mao's Little Red Book carry
additional sentimental value, but the only dollars
with sentimental value are the ones you see framed
behind the cash registers of small businesses.)

The Fed's actions modify the value of the dollar, but
they do not dictate it.  Currency markets, speculators,
buyers of U.S. bonds, and countries and banks that
hold cash reserves do.  If all of them decided they'd
rather park their money in Euros rather than dollars,
the dollar would sink and the Fed could only mitigate
the damage.  It would take a lot more than it took
George Soros to devalue the pound, but same principle.

Back to pouring half a trillion dollars into a hole in
the desert.  Spending half a trillion dollars here or
there is roughly the same on the balance sheet, but it
has grossly different implications in terms of productive
re-investment and the judgment of the country's
management team.

If the gummint decided to spend half a trillion dollars
on (1) an ill-advised war, or (2) buying every man woman
and child a Specialized racing bike, or (3) some program
you don't like, like Social Security or universal health
coverage, it has the same effect on the debt, but the
re-investment in the US economy is different and the
prospects 10 years out would be different.  Further,
bond-buyers and currency reserve holders would rightly
be spooked by a gummint that decided to do (2).  So it's
not a surprise that they might also be spooked by a gummint
that chooses to do (1).

The Preznident's current foreign (and fiscal) policy is
like that book title about the AOL/Time Warner merger:
&quot;There Must Be A Pony In Here Somewhere.&quot;  The stock market
rendered a verdict on that one too.
