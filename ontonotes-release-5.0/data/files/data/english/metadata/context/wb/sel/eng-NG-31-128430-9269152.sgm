The Montgomery County Registrar appears to have lulled this Roanoke Times
reporter into thinking that his special security measures make up for the lack
of a independent tangible record of each vote (paper).
The Registrar also assures the reporter that he turns off the voting machines
wi-fi.  (I feel better already, don't you?) Meanwhile, post this to forums
for War Drivers in the area.
The registrar has a secret lair

Montgomery County Registrar Randy Wertz has a secret lair  somewhere in the
New River Valley. Between elections, he stores his voting  machines in an
undisclosed location to help ensure no one tampers with  them.

A couple of weeks ago, he let me visit.
I rode blindfolded and guarded in the back of a van. The driver took us along
bumpy byways, tracing out a route full of twists and turns. We could have
wound  up back at the county offices or in a cave behind a waterfall along the
New  River.
Finally, the van stopped, someone hustled me out, and Wertz pulled the
blindfold from my eyes.
OK, I exaggerate, fabricate even.
Wertz does have a secret storage facility, and I did get to visit a few weeks
ago, but there were no blindfolds and no guards.
I just followed his directions to get there one sunny morning.
No, I am not going to reveal where. The secrecy of the site is one of the
bulwarks against partisan ninjas slipping through the shadows and hacking the
next election.
Wertz had invited me to observe the preparation of voting machines for the
November election.
Many people show up at their polling places and assume everything will work.
The ballot will appear on the screen, votes will be counted and the right
person  will win. They don't worry that a computer glitch could invalidate their
votes  or that a trick of computer code could throw the election one way or
another.

Wertz and I have debated the merits of the electronic voting system and its
security. He likes it; I don't. By inviting me to the secret vault, he hoped
to  allay some of my worries and help me understand all of the safeguards he
and his  staff have installed.
I pulled up to the building and entered a cavernous warehouse. Discarded
computers, sinks, office furniture and other business detritus crowded the
place.
A small wooden building, not much larger than a shed, stood in one corner
like a Russian doll, a building within a building. And inside of it, a
half-dozen specialists were hard at work.
Wertz was there, another election worker, the three members of the county's
electoral board and Hugh Gallagher, the election expert with whom the county
contracts to handle programming and verifying the machines.
The process went something like this:
Wertz unlocked one of the cages in which the machines are stored. The workers
unloaded them onto tables and inspected the seals to ensure no one had
tampered  with them since they were last touched in the spring.
Once the exterior exam was complete, they powered up the machines and
Gallagher started the important stuff. He went from machine to machine,  inserting
security cards and loading the state-supplied ballots from a portable  data
drive.
He then checked that the machines had no votes in memory -- that they were
zeroed -- and ran through a sequence of test votes following a consistent
pattern. Finally, he printed the results.
The members of the electoral board verified the printouts. As the
representatives of the public -- representatives of the two major political  parties
anyway -- they ensured there was no cheating.
Everything checked out, so Gallagher reset the machines and disabled their
wireless ability.
Finally, they received a new security seal and went back into their  cages.
If the board had found any errors on the printouts, the machines would have
been pulled to isolate and fix the problem.
There were some other small steps along the way, but that's the gist of  it.
Then they repeated the process over and over again on more than 100 machines.
The whole thing took two long days, but now Montgomery County is ready to
roll  out its machines on Nov. 6. Between now and then, officials will check in
on  them periodically to make sure they are still secure.
&quot;If we prepare properly before the election, which is what we are doing,
there's a high probability things will go smoothly on Election Day,&quot; Wertz  said.
He convinced me on that point at least. I can honestly report that the
machines are physically safe while they hibernate and the ballot loading was
honest.
Even if partisan ninjas gain access, they cannot completely cover their
tracks. Few people know where they are; gaining access would require bypassing
doors, locks and cages; and tampering would break a coded seal.
I still don't like electronic voting machines, but I dislike them a little
less now.
