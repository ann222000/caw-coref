Hi Ken,
Free expression of 'Will' would be found in the Sun, wouldn't it, and
our experience of it by aspects made to it?
I'd think that a harsh aspect to the Sun from a planet that impedes
free expression and especially if there is a 9th house influence, could
be indicative of how one regards the subject of free will.
A member of this group has often expressed views that free will does
not exist. Upon checking the chart, Saturn in the 9th house is square
natal Sun.

OTOH, I personally think that there is some sort of "guidance" that
motivates the decisions one does or doesn't make. It's akin to having
no free will as such except that it does offer a multiple of choices. I
have Sun in 9th house square Jupiter in the 12th house.

Someone with a harshly aspected Sun-Pluto and 9th house influence might
feel 'compelled' to act in certain ways with no intervention of free
will, whilst Sun-Neptune might 'feel led' by forces outside of and
stronger than one's own free will.

I guess Sun-Uranus is the best off. It does what it wants anyway :-)

Anyone care to comment from their own chart?

Regards,
Christine.

Hi Christine,

It´s very interesting to read your thoughts about the Sun and it´s
aspects. Looking at me -I believe in free will- I would be an
example for the Sun/Uranus con. (2nd of July 1951) you mentioned.
BUT I´m sure that Ken is right, you cann´t see it in the chart.
I discussed this topic with different people and I found out, the
younger they are the more they believe in free will.
So in case it´s dependend on something I would say the age is a
factor not the chart.
Elisabeth

I don't remember where I read it, but I once heard that people with
charts with all planets above the horizon are more outgoing and
extroverted.  Those with all planets below the horizon tend to be
home-bodies and introverted.  Along those lines in the East/West factor
(I have a hard time remember how it goes, but....).  All planets in the
Eastern part of the chart denotes someone who believes in
fate/destiny...as compared to West which (I think) are the Free will
thinkers.

Correct me if I'm wrong...or anyone knows a source for this.....

Age is Saturn. And he doesn't believe in free will. ;-)

Perhaps you could say that the more he has had the chance to transit
your chart, the less likely you will be to believe in free will?

I think we operate partly by free will and partly by determinism.  No
black or white here.  In a nutshell, some events happen no matter what;
other events depend on our (few) choices.  I don't know what the ratio
is, but I'm pretty sure there is one.

Within this framework, I see the causation of illness as divided into 2
broad categories, physical and/or psychological.  Sometimes the 2
overlap, sometimes not.  Again, no black or white.

So, AAMers, based on what I've just written, what planets do you think
aspect my Sun?

I have a Moon/Uranus conjunction in Leo below the horizon, the Moon
ruling the Ascendant (which is conjunct Venus).

People think I am sociable, myself I don't think so. However, they
think I am a bit of reclusive, myself I am just happy about the amount
of people I see. And so forth, the descriptions are contradictory.

Who is right? Is there even a singular perspective: "He is like THIS!"
that could be said to be true?

I used to think that, too (based on what the books said), but I've come
to view it a little bit differently based on what I've seen in a few
charts of people I know. I now think that people with a strong emphasis
above the horizon are more "what you see is what you get," they are
more overt or "out in the open" with regards to their thoughts and
behavior, not afraid to say what they think, don't "hide" their
personalities but are very open, and are comfortable with letting
people "see the real me" as it were. They are not necessarily any more
outgoing or extroverted as those things are usually thought of, they
may enjoy privacy as much as the next person or may not be any more
"socially active." It's just that they don't try to hide anything about
who they "really" are, as it were. People who have a strong emphasis
below the horizon, on the other hand, tend to feel more uncomfortable
about "revealing all," they are more like an iceberg where what you see
is only a small portion of who they are, and most of their
personalities are "hidden" below the surface. I don't know if that's
quite right, but that's how it seems to me.

Another idea I read-- in abook about houses by someone whose name I
can't recall at the moment-- suggests that an emphasis above the
horizon shows a need to confirm things with other people or something
like that, a need to weigh one's own ideas or perceptions against those
of other people in order to verify one's perceptions against a
consensus-- that is, things are viewed objectively. People with an
emphasis below the horizon prefer to have their own feelings or
thoughts-- subjective perceptions-- without needing to justify or
confirm them against an objective consensus, they know what they like
or think or feel, and they don't really care whether their perceptions
agree with everyone else's, because they are more focused on their
subjective feelings and such than on what everyone agrees on.

In any case, note that a person can be outgoing and sociable yet still
prefer to think or experience things in a subjective mode, and a person
can be introverted or withdrawn yet still be very much concerned about
the need for objectivity, so the usual interpretations of what upper or
lower hemisphere emphasis mean may be too focused on "social" versus
"private," or "outgoing" versus "reserved."

Being that all the pasengers on a doomed aircraft actually sealed their

without putting someone in harm's way.

Hi Ruth,
What with nutshells and ratios, your original post had a touch of Virgo
about it :-)
Are you from that UR-PL in Virgo generation with the sextile to
Neptune, seeing as you've eliminated the influence of both Jupiter and
Saturn in your chart? :-)
Your use of the word determinism has a ring of Saturn....maybe
opposing/sextiling the conjunction?

That is SO true!
Do you (and anyone?) trust your intuition (or inner knowledge, if one
prefers to call it that) implicitly, or dither when rationality takes
over? It is said that the first thought is always the right one but I
am still having to learn NOT to question that thought that seems to
spring to mind of its own accord.
I see this as the difference between Uranus and Mercury(and leaving out
(but really is) the influence of their exact aspects to my BML !),
which both fight for precedence in my chart :-)

I notice you have the Mercury-Neptune link and Sun-Uranus in water
signs. Like me, your Mercury and Uranus are not asepcted. Do you find
'intuition' to be more of an inner feeling rather than thought, as
such?

Christine.

Ken,
How do *you* taste-test for Sun conjunct Jupiter ..:)?  Personally, I could
use a little help trying to sniff out the difference between a conjunction
and a trine of these two.  Both, for example, could seem equally expressed
as an image of a Sunkist navel orange...that's a confounding stumbling block
in my efforts.

&gt; Hi Ken,
&gt; Free expression of 'Will' would be found in the Sun, wouldn't it, and
&gt; our experience of it by aspects made to it?
&gt; I'd think that a harsh aspect to the Sun from a planet that impedes
&gt; free expression and especially if there is a 9th house influence,
&gt; could
&gt; be indicative of how one regards the subject of free will.
&gt; A member of this group has often expressed views that free will does
&gt; not exist. Upon checking the chart, Saturn in the 9th house is square
&gt; natal Sun.
">

-- Quite so and having absolutely and definitely nothing to do against
it, as is wont w the deterministic influence of it. And from Can, all
the more conservative.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; OTOH, I personally think that there is some sort of &quot;guidance&quot; that
&gt; motivates the decisions one does or doesn't make. It's akin to having
&gt; no free will as such except that it does offer a multiple of choices.
&gt; I
&gt; have Sun in 9th house square Jupiter in the 12th house.

&gt; Someone with a harshly aspected Sun-Pluto and 9th house influence
&gt; might
&gt; feel 'compelled' to act in certain ways with no intervention of free
&gt; will, whilst Sun-Neptune might 'feel led' by forces outside of and
&gt; stronger than one's own free will.

&gt; I guess Sun-Uranus is the best off. It does what it wants anyway :-)

conservatively deterministic, Dan be a freewillist par excellence? But
he isn't!
So how do you explain it? Maybe it's the free choice that he can
exercise between Sat and Ura w Sun in between them?

"It does what it wants anyway :-)" - True! I attest that I'm a true
individualist. And I choose determinism as a way of human conduit by
remote control. Extreme, as is Ura, but true, as Sat in Can in 9 or 10,

&gt;&gt; Looking at my experience from the last 25 years, yeah, I'm pretty

&gt;&gt; &gt;I thought I was the only one w a

I do think it's an illusion. It's all written in the stars. If it's
written that you love blue eyes and black hair for your girlfriend,
would you choose black eyes and blue hair? I think not.

And if it's written that you'll be spared the wrath of a Katrina, then
your house will stand intact alone in the midst of all ruined around,
and I saw it here in FL w my very own eyes, for two yrs, now, quite a
few times. And so on and so forth. Ex's abound.

Ken asked if belief in free will could be seen in a chart. When
thinking of will, only Sun comes to my mind as I don't know of any
other planet that incorporates Will within its function. Beliefs (and I
don't mean faith) fall under the 9th house as far as I am aware. That's
why I considered these two aspects of the chart to be important, but
which the intervention of another planet could produce their own
variations of determinism, as you called it.

What combination(s) do you think could apply to belief in free will ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sextile Saturn.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Good guess, Ken, even if it's a pretty wide (too wide?) orb of 7º.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; That's a hit in my world ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;There is also another, closer aspect to my Sun...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Conjunct Jupiter.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No (I wish ;-), it's another planet and another aspect.  But, hmm...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would you accept an orb of 9º for Sun trine Jupiter?

&gt;&gt;Ken,
&gt;&gt; How do *you* taste-test for Sun conjunct Jupiter ..:)?  Personally, I
&gt;&gt; could
&gt;&gt;use a little help trying to sniff out the difference between a conjunction
&gt;&gt;and a trine of these two.  Both, for example, could seem equally expressed
&gt;&gt;as an image of a Sunkist navel orange...that's a confounding stumbling
&gt;&gt;block
&gt;&gt;in my efforts.

&gt; Just a question of degree. The trine doesn't 'push' like a
&gt; conjunction.
">

Oooooo, I like that--*push*, that's really good....I think...: |

But I'm going to have to be a lot smarter when it comes to the contextual
meaning of "push" when thinking about , say, Sun conjunct Venus....hmmm,
pushy receptiveness...:)?  Who might we try as an example of a natal chart
dominated by Sun/Ven conjuction?

But I can try to validate your "push" notion when thinking about
Kaczinsky, a close conjunct of Sun+Sat+Ura, as anti-industrial "heroism"
/leadership by example, whatever....then there's trine to Neptune for the
ease of spiritual ordainment an consecration.

Otherwise, I'd say these represent a more or less

Now here's the ultimate *free will* puzzle, the author wills writes a
story which projects something in his own nature which he probably does will
into existence.  Were it not for the writers internal conflict, what would
drive the story into existence?  Specifically, Cheever,"The Worm in the
Apple"  Here, the expectancy the happiness in life, and of the concumate
happiness of the depicted family has *got* to be a sham.  Cheever has Saturn
conjunct Venus, *only 3 mins apart* at the MC!
The goal of happiness in general seems addressed catagorically. Cheever
thus transforms his personal misgivings about his own angst--Sat/Ven
conjunction,  into a transcendant form, and thus elevates that energy to the
collective status...his personal essence thus bumps up one quanta, to a
collective world of spirit and ideas ...a Platonic ideal quality that can
ring in a chart, say, for an astrologer to participate in...:)
http://www.auathailand.org/ellsa/ellsa_worm4.html
http://pedantus.free.fr/Cheever_01.gif

The *push* power of a conjunction seem validated in light of this
example.

BTW, the null chart version here:
http://pedantus.free.fr/Cheever_NullChart.gif

This shows how the author's natal chart has a better collective topical
resonance, What's the story about? Its about the tormented philosophy of the
the narrator/observer...this shows up well in the null house system *veiw*.
Sun in Gem, house three--opposite--Jupiter in Sag, house nine.

So how do you explain it? Maybe it's the free choice that he can
exercise between Sat and Ura w Sun in between them?

He has the gift of promoting independent thought and weighing the pros
ans cons before making decisions. He chooses not to believe in free
will.
Oh! You said that underneath :-) Your Uranus has obviously been
exercising its personal rights longer than mine has :-)

"It does what it wants anyway :-)" - True! I attest that I'm a true

I'm not sure, but let's see.  Just for starters, an overriding Neptune
might predispose a person to be gullible, easily falling for illusions
or wishful thinking.  A heavy, angular Saturn might rub a person's nose
in reality (whatever that is!) more often than not.  A strong, pushy
Mars might convince a person on either side that s/he's right...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't remember where I read it, but I once heard that people with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; charts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with all planets above the horizon are more outgoing and extroverted.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those with all planets below the horizon tend to be home-bodies and

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the chart denotes someone who believes in fate/destiny...as compared
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; West which (I think) are the Free will thinkers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong...or anyone knows a source for this.....

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  This Astrology ala the Jungian mandala quadrants; a lot of people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;subscribed to it..starting with Mark Jones and Dane Ruhdyar I think.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Never made a whole lot of sense to me. Put a Sun/Mars conjunction in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Leo below the horizon and tell me this is an inwardly-focused person
&gt;&gt;&gt; ;-)

&gt;&gt;  Perceptive, as usual...:)
&gt;&gt;  Apparently, it can be both at once, in a way.  The expressed self image
&gt;&gt;can be paradoxical--the words one uses may say &quot;inward&quot;, but the animated
&gt;&gt;volume of the words say, &quot;outward!&quot;.
&gt;&gt;    My brother, Marty, the shy, retiring, meglomaniacal rock drummer with
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;schizphrenic messiah complex, who can't wait to hoarsely belt out &quot;Take
&gt;&gt;those old records off the shelf....I sit and reminisce by myself....&quot;
&gt;&gt; http://pedantus.free.fr/Satterlee_M.gif

&gt; Oh yeah, I get this one... I also have a brother who negotiates
&gt; control of his life with various real and imagined forces on a daily
&gt; basis- not that he's actually aware of this little dance, however. He
&gt; just thinks if 'they' run his show, 'they' should also provide for his
&gt; comfort :-)

&gt; Two things in your brother's chart- the Moon/Venus contact can
&gt; represent some particular brutal emotional treatment. Especially,
&gt; here, in the masculine signs, it's a situation with planets working at
&gt; cross-gender, and it matters a lot.

&gt; The other is Sa/Ne sq Ur that suggests, uh, *something* (significant,
&gt; I would guess) massively entrenched and chronic. Your brother's state
&gt; of mind fits easily under these two umbrellas. To nail it ahead of
&gt; time? Not the specific thing, but I'd definitely be looking for
&gt; mindset issues or accomplishments in this person. It's too volatile
&gt; for much between high and low. Sounds like he expresses some of both.

&gt; Relating this to the thread... hard to feel in charge of your life if
&gt; it looks like someone else is running it...
">

Oh, he tried to cure his paranoid episodes by walking hand in hand with
Jesus....meds worked better...:)

He has bipolar and paranoid schitzophrenic episodes. As, the big brother,
its largely my fault of course. It was always expected that I be the
surrogate adult, as assigned.

During a rare outing in the yard of the housing project, I once broke his
arm. Well, he took an awkwrd fall in the normal course of attempted
acrobatic stunt I instigated.  We three brothers, 8, 6, and 5,  were affraid
to report the injury because we did not want to get beaten and, worse,
confined indoors indefinitley.  I swore him to secrecy, and he suffer for
two weeks with his wrist and forearm fractured in three places.  When the
green swelling could no longer be hidden beneath the shirt sleeve, because
it won't go into the sleeve very wee, the cat was out of the bag.  But he
never broke his silence...he thought he'd get the worst beating of course.
I am the epitome of evil for telling him that I wouldn't be his freind
anymore if he "squealed."  Hard not to agree with that. I set him up for a
fall and insisted he suffer in silence...so much for the tenderness of a
Capricorn Moon...:)

What a painful burden you must have been carrying around inside you for
many years.  However, I suspect that you have been blaming yourself
needlessly.  It is, in fact, a myth that the psychoses you mention,
such as bipolar disorder and paranoid schizophrena, which are
malfunctions of the brain, are *caused* by bad children or bad
parenting or, in general, by some big, bad person or event.  It just
doesn't work that way, any more than, say, lupus or multiple sclerosis
are caused by bad brothering.  There is clinical evidence in support of
a medical model for the psychoses.  In other words, your brother was
born with an inherited susceptibility to mental illness (and it
probably shows up in his chart).  Severe stress of one sort or another
would probably have triggered his symptoms sooner or later whether you
did anything or not.

Did you ever apologize to him for this incident?  Tell him how you
felt?  Guilt can all too easily take on a life of its own.  Brothers
will do mean things to each other, that's life - it happens in every
family where there are siblings - but not all siblings whose arms get
broken become mentally ill.  It is unlikely that the incident you
describe here had the severe repercussions for which you are blaming
yourself.

Best regards,
Ruth

Hello again, Ruth,
I hope you don't immediately assume that I was being disrespectful.
It's a very good descriptive word of the opposing nature of what one
thinks of as free well. It wasn't part of my astro. vocabulary and I
simply referred to your use of it; nothing more intended.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What combination(s) do you think could apply to belief in free will ?

I'm not sure, but let's see.  Just for starters, an overriding Neptune
might predispose a person to be gullible, easily falling for illusions
or wishful thinking.  A heavy, angular Saturn might rub a person's nose

in reality (whatever that is!) more often than not.

Chr: Yes; these two have been mentioned elsewhere. Do you think they
would have to be aspected to the Sun, or could produce this 'lack of
belief in free will' through their aspects to other planets ?

A strong, pushy
Mars might convince a person on either side that s/he's right...

Chr: Mmmm. I have difficulty with that one because I think you may mean
that one person's Mars would be influential upon another, but would
his/her Mars have the same effect upon him/herself?
Mars is not so much of a thinker but a doer, isn't it ?

Christine.

Ruth,
I'm just relaying his perspective, I don't buy into the reality of any
member of my family. They are (or were) all insane, and apparently just
can't wait to drag someone down the rabit hole with them. I'm just not the
saviour they expected me to be...:)   My family wanted me to support them,
and my gov't wanted to kill me in Veitnam. Though I served, both for awhile
and at the age of 20, just said no to all of it, managed to get an honorable
discharge and simply became an eccentric free agent.  Goal: avoid all the
nonsense, aspiration: to one day be at home in the world. Lesson learned:
Existentialism minus Desire = the Tao.  Regrets: never learned to fly like
Superman...:)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;So, AAMers, based on what I've just written, what planets do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;aspect my Sun?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sextile Saturn.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Good guess, Ken, even if it's a pretty wide (too wide?) orb of 7º.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; That's a hit in my world ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;There is also another, closer aspect to my Sun...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Conjunct Jupiter.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No (I wish ;-), it's another planet and another aspect.  But, hmm...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would you accept an orb of 9º for Sun trine Jupiter?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ken,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How do *you* taste-test for Sun conjunct Jupiter ..:)?  Personally, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;use a little help trying to sniff out the difference between a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;conjunction
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and a trine of these two.  Both, for example, could seem equally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;expressed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as an image of a Sunkist navel orange...that's a confounding stumbling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;block
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in my efforts.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just a question of degree. The trine doesn't 'push' like a
&gt;&gt;&gt; conjunction.

&gt;&gt;Oooooo, I like that--*push*, that's really good....I think...: |

&gt;&gt;But I'm going to have to be a lot smarter when it comes to the contextual
&gt;&gt;meaning of &quot;push&quot; when thinking about , say, Sun conjunct Venus....hmmm,
&gt;&gt;pushy receptiveness...:)?  Who might we try as an example of a natal chart
&gt;&gt;dominated by Sun/Ven conjuction?

&gt; That one is a clash of masculine/feminine drives (sometimes). One I
&gt; think might give you an idea is a Moon/Venus conjunction. Emotional
&gt; invasion, smother love, that sort of thing. Push isn't always visible,
&gt; like the old thing about how physical abuse is sometimes 'easier' to
&gt; deal with it because it's obvious. How can one be upset with a mother
&gt; who did everything for you? Or consider a Moon/Pluto conjunction. Just
&gt; the nuclear radiation alone- nothing being done or said- is sometimes
&gt; enough to clear a room.

&gt;&gt;  But I can try to validate your &quot;push&quot; notion when thinking about
&gt;&gt;Kaczinsky, a close conjunct of Sun+Sat+Ura, as anti-industrial &quot;heroism&quot;
&gt;&gt;/leadership by example, whatever....then there's trine to Neptune for the
&gt;&gt;ease of spiritual ordainment an consecration.

&gt; Sa/Ur is a particularly tough combination to handle.

&gt;&gt;Otherwise, I'd say these represent a more or less
&gt;&gt;&gt; classical optimistic outlook, as well as the consummate bullshitter.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They *mean* well, they really do. They just don't have the time to
&gt;&gt;&gt; follow through on those wonderful ideas...

&gt;&gt;  Ok, I see, *intentions* bear fruit due to exercise of the Sun as the
&gt;&gt; Will
&gt;&gt; Sun/Jup conjuction, as opposed to ,say' windy descriptions of the
&gt;&gt;subject's assumed *could-be fruitful* Leadership potential.

&gt; I think that's a good description of an optimist... doesn't
&gt; necessarily imply actually doing anything about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Otherwise, I'd say I did pretty good 'guessing' her planetary contacts
&gt;&gt;&gt; w/o knowing much about her.

&gt;&gt; Outstanding..:)

&gt; Thank yew :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;{..........................}

&gt;&gt;   Now here's the ultimate *free will* puzzle, the author wills writes a
&gt;&gt;story which projects something in his own nature which he probably does
&gt;&gt;will
&gt;&gt;into existence.  Were it not for the writers internal conflict, what would
&gt;&gt;drive the story into existence?  Specifically, Cheever,&quot;The Worm in the
&gt;&gt;Apple&quot;  Here, the expectancy the happiness in life, and of the concumate
&gt;&gt;happiness of the depicted family has *got* to be a sham.  Cheever has
&gt;&gt;Saturn
&gt;&gt;conjunct Venus, *only 3 mins apart* at the MC!

&gt;&gt;    The goal of happiness in general seems addressed catagorically.
&gt;&gt; Cheever
&gt;&gt;thus transforms his personal misgivings about his own angst--Sat/Ven
&gt;&gt;conjunction,  into a transcendant form, and thus elevates that energy to
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;collective status...his personal essence thus bumps up one quanta, to a
&gt;&gt;collective world of spirit and ideas ...a Platonic ideal quality that can
&gt;&gt;ring in a chart, say, for an astrologer to participate in...:)
&gt;&gt; http://www.auathailand.org/ellsa/ellsa_worm4.html
&gt;&gt; http://pedantus.free.fr/Cheever_01.gif

&gt;&gt;   The *push* power of a conjunction seem validated in light of this
&gt;&gt;example.

&gt; Don't forget that Ma/Ur opposition. That's a textbook example of
&gt; impatience.

&gt;&gt;BTW, the null chart version here:
&gt;&gt; http://pedantus.free.fr/Cheever_NullChart.gif

&gt;&gt;  This shows how the author's natal chart has a better collective topical
&gt;&gt;resonance, What's the story about? Its about the tormented philosophy of
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;the narrator/observer...this shows up well in the null house system
&gt;&gt;*veiw*.
&gt;&gt;Sun in Gem, house three--opposite--Jupiter in Sag, house nine.

&gt; And certainly echoes the Ma/Ur. Gemini/Sag/Jupiter all have elements
&gt; of the Uranus restlessnes to me.
">

Agreed.  But I'm trying to learn how to recognize a hierarchy or planet
aspect symbols, rather than, perhaps as usual, eccentrically predict one.
The theme of a story, whether or not explicit, or sincerely and genuinely
intended, seems to have as its central element an starting place or tone.
_The Worm in the Apple_has an unknown context, but its primary implication
is one of dissatifaction concerning something which should in theory be
pleasant.  The "discovery" or fear of discovery, i.e., suspicion, is of
course an element that the title "image" also  evokes.  So, the hieracrhy I
suggest has the Ven/Sat conjuction as the more explicit, and the others you
cite must subordinate themselves, *as if*  to find their own path to
expression. All planets seem a little like Dante who must follow Virgil if
they want to emerge from their place of nonexistence.  A work of art begins
with an unspoken question among the natal planets--"who wants to play Virgil
today?"

All we really have to work with is people's stories, (and some people are
just better story tellers).  While it is no doubt perfectly legitamate to
"read" a story from a variety of perspectives based on personal interest
generated by some individual resonsance or ideological agenda, I'm not
really fond of unbridled eccentricity. So, I try to be as Dante, and follow
Virgil, rather than assume I can find my own way in some hellish labarynth
of  "shades"....:)   To experience the reality to the author's inner world,
though merely modeled by his art, we must have a plan to return safely to
our own.  For me, any surrender to imagination is indistinguishable from the
act of entering the gates of Hades. We venture it deeply and successfully if
we learn to let the author dictate the map and the route back home. We may
choose orient the self  via our  ever present view the collective planets,
but the "other" must lead us for a story to engender and convey the soul of
the author into our  home world.   My sanity is not idly achieved...:)
------------

And now I'm off to the dentist to have four teeth ripped out, and a
foriegn object fitted to the roof of my mouth....(Virgil...you sure this is
the right way...: | ?)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Oh yeah, I get this one... I also have a brother who negotiates
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; control of his life with various real and imagined forces on a daily
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; basis- not that he's actually aware of this little dance, however. He
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; just thinks if 'they' run his show, 'they' should also provide for his
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; comfort :-)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Two things in your brother's chart- the Moon/Venus contact can
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; represent some particular brutal emotional treatment. Especially,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; here, in the masculine signs, it's a situation with planets working at
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cross-gender, and it matters a lot.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The other is Sa/Ne sq Ur that suggests, uh, *something* (significant,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I would guess) massively entrenched and chronic. Your brother's state
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of mind fits easily under these two umbrellas. To nail it ahead of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; time? Not the specific thing, but I'd definitely be looking for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mindset issues or accomplishments in this person. It's too volatile
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for much between high and low. Sounds like he expresses some of both.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Relating this to the thread... hard to feel in charge of your life if
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it looks like someone else is running it...

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Oh, he tried to cure his paranoid episodes by walking hand in hand with
&gt; &gt;&gt; Jesus....meds worked better...:)

&gt; &gt; Hello Pedantus,

&gt; &gt; I just saw this and must comment.

&gt; &gt;&gt; He has bipolar and paranoid schitzophrenic episodes. As, the big brother,
&gt; &gt;&gt; its largely my fault of course.

&gt; &gt; No, not so, it is not largely your fault.

&gt; &gt;&gt; It was always expected that I be the
&gt; &gt;&gt; surrogate adult, as assigned.

&gt; &gt;&gt;   During a rare outing in the yard of the housing project, I once broke
&gt; &gt;&gt; his
&gt; &gt;&gt; arm. Well, he took an awkwrd fall in the normal course of attempted
&gt; &gt;&gt; acrobatic stunt I instigated.  We three brothers, 8, 6, and 5,  were
&gt; &gt;&gt; affraid
&gt; &gt;&gt; to report the injury because we did not want to get beaten and, worse,
&gt; &gt;&gt; confined indoors indefinitley.  I swore him to secrecy, and he suffer for
&gt; &gt;&gt; two weeks with his wrist and forearm fractured in three places.  When the
&gt; &gt;&gt; green swelling could no longer be hidden beneath the shirt sleeve,
&gt; &gt;&gt; because
&gt; &gt;&gt; it won't go into the sleeve very wee, the cat was out of the bag.  But he
&gt; &gt;&gt; never broke his silence...he thought he'd get the worst beating of
&gt; &gt;&gt; course.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am the epitome of evil for telling him that I wouldn't be his freind
&gt; &gt;&gt; anymore if he &quot;squealed.&quot;  Hard not to agree with that. I set him up for
&gt; &gt;&gt; a
&gt; &gt;&gt; fall and insisted he suffer in silence...so much for the tenderness of a
&gt; &gt;&gt; Capricorn Moon...:)

&gt; &gt; What a painful burden you must have been carrying around inside you for
&gt; &gt; many years.  However, I suspect that you have been blaming yourself
&gt; &gt; needlessly.  It is, in fact, a myth that the psychoses you mention,
&gt; &gt; such as bipolar disorder and paranoid schizophrena, which are
&gt; &gt; malfunctions of the brain, are *caused* by bad children or bad
&gt; &gt; parenting or, in general, by some big, bad person or event.  It just
&gt; &gt; doesn't work that way, any more than, say, lupus or multiple sclerosis
&gt; &gt; are caused by bad brothering.  There is clinical evidence in support of
&gt; &gt; a medical model for the psychoses.  In other words, your brother was
&gt; &gt; born with an inherited susceptibility to mental illness (and it
&gt; &gt; probably shows up in his chart).  Severe stress of one sort or another
&gt; &gt; would probably have triggered his symptoms sooner or later whether you
&gt; &gt; did anything or not.

&gt; &gt; Did you ever apologize to him for this incident?  Tell him how you
&gt; &gt; felt?  Guilt can all too easily take on a life of its own.  Brothers
&gt; &gt; will do mean things to each other, that's life - it happens in every
&gt; &gt; family where there are siblings - but not all siblings whose arms get
&gt; &gt; broken become mentally ill.  It is unlikely that the incident you
&gt; &gt; describe here had the severe repercussions for which you are blaming
&gt; &gt; yourself.

&gt; Ruth,
&gt;    I'm just relaying his perspective, I don't buy into the reality of any
&gt; member of my family. They are (or were) all insane, and apparently just
&gt; can't wait to drag someone down the rabit hole with them. I'm just not the
&gt; saviour they expected me to be...:)   My family wanted me to support them,
&gt; and my gov't wanted to kill me in Veitnam. Though I served, both for awhile
&gt; and at the age of 20, just said no to all of it, managed to get an honorable
&gt; discharge and simply became an eccentric free agent.  Goal: avoid all the
&gt; nonsense, aspiration: to one day be at home in the world. Lesson learned:
&gt; Existentialism minus Desire = the Tao.  Regrets: never learned to fly like
&gt; Superman...:)
">

Thanks for the clarification, Pedantus.  Please forgive me for diving
in unbidden, a  6th-house Jupiter predilection of mine.  Good that you
could extricate yourself not only from family but also from Vietnam -
what a travesty that was.

Best regards,
Ruth
P.S. Your names crack me up, btw.

No, I didn't assume that.

&gt; &gt; What combination(s) do you think could apply to belief in free

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm not sure, but let's see.  Just for starters, an overriding Neptune

&gt; in reality (whatever that is!) more often than not.

&gt; Chr: Yes; these two have been mentioned elsewhere. Do you think they
&gt; would have to be aspected to the Sun, or could produce this 'lack of
&gt; belief in free will' through their aspects to other planets ?
">

I must clarify, first, that my mention of Neptune, above, was my
attempt to show its support of a belief in free will (gullibility,
etc.)  And no, I don't think Neptune and Saturn would have to be
aspected to the Sun to express such belief or lack of belief.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  A strong, pushy

&gt; Chr: Mmmm. I have difficulty with that one because I think you may mean
&gt; that one person's Mars would be influential upon another, but would
&gt; his/her Mars have the same effect upon him/herself?
&gt; Mars is not so much of a thinker but a doer, isn't it ?

I see Mars - as ruler of Aries, the head sign after all -  as very much
a thinker too, but more an impulsive, "headstrong" thinker.

I remeber some one with Sun/Plu conjunction in Virgo (H, don't listen

And, for grins, I thought what if such a creature was born with her Sun
conjunct Pluto on my natal Saturn in Virgo. This, I thought, would surely be
someone I probably kill in self defence...:)  I googled such a nemisis by
noting that such a person would have to be born on September 8, 1966.

The answer should b ethe relative strength of the various factors, so
from this we can deduce that Sat sq Sun is stronger than Ura trine Sun,
even though the trine is exact while the sq has an orb.

Chr. Mars *stop* something? Tell that to Mars :-) My astro. vocabulary
taught that he was the trigger, instigator, initiator, pioneer  etc. I
have never seen him 'stop' anything, only be slown by whatever sign
he's in ( as per Taurus right now)

Similar kinds of things with Uranus... attention span, especially. But
hard-aspect Uranus people can be incredibly willful, even if it's just
choosing to not be bound by convention.

Saturn people can also be brick walls when they want to. We might be
only talking about a person's motive/why they're choosing to take a
stand about something.

And I think these are true, whether the Sun is involved by aspect or
not.

Christine,
I don't believe have the answer to any thing here, but I do have an
interesting chart and quotation which fortunately involves all the planets
mentioned above.  Because we do, (or at least I hope we do,) know a lot
about the speaker, we should be able to test our hypothesis of what goes
with what and why.  As for Twain , here, we see it is hard to separate his
"philosophy" , (JupiterRx in Cancer, House Nine?) from his beleif about free
will.  Because this quote comes from a work entitled, "Eruption," might we
guess that [Sun conjunct Mars]--trine--[Moon conjunct Pluto]  has a lot to
do with the both the title and his thematic use of "Desire." :
http://pedantus.free.fr/Twain_FreeWill_01a.gif

As a Leo native, I have to address the somewhat excessive will to at least
appear knowledgable...:) I graph it like this:
http://pedantus.free.fr/ego-vs-will_1.gif

The ego is more a matter of personality's basic vitality, a sum total of
some kind and a necessary condition for well being; so, I separate that from
the free will to choose, because it is hard to see that we actually choose
whats best for us most of the time...:)

Anyway, my bottom line is that natal charts seem not to be predictors of
anything, but especially not what a person will do or believe. These charts
have an unsolved and perhaps solutionless mystery concerning how they become
to appear so uncannily apropos, but to see "truth" in them, with so little
actual knowledge to support that proposition, approaches the quintesential
definition of a religious belief system.  If we want to avoid the label of
astro-religious fundementalist, we must accept that astrology is no more
than a reductive generalizing synthesis of mythological traditions which is
employed as a means to artistically model our subjective  experience of the
human condition.  To say it works is a matter of Belief, not Knowledge. To
say I choose to believe in Astrology, makes no sense whatsoever....Mark
Twain seems correct about the role of Desire...:)

Hi,
I HATE Google :-)
I've just lost 30 mins. of thought answering Rog/Pedantus!

I am unfamilar with Twain's life/work so cannot put a 'life' to his
chart, so to speak.
Maybe it's my stubborness, or may be I'm seeing what I want to see.
What I don't see is his Sun aspected to the 9th house, even if Jupiter
is in its natural house and the Sun is in Sagittarius. Twain may have
had many high-falluting philosophies and beliefs but, in my very humble
opinion, the belief in free will wasn't one of them. The fact that
Ascendant ruler is conjunct Moon  and squares Jupiter in 9th house
brings the thought that he might have been a tormented soul actually
seeking something to believe in. His force of will (sun trine Pluto)
must have been very a very compelling part of his nature.
Maybe Tom and Huck were autobiographical in some way.

That charts show whether one believes or not believes in whatever, or
that astrology works, is a matter of personal belief in the power of
astro. symbolism. I have a well-tenanted 9th house :-).
I am also very Earthy. I'll believe it when I see it. Astrology had to
prove itself to me by fact, and I honestly don't believe myself to be a
person that lives in an illusional/delusional state. Astrology proves
itself constantly to me...maybe because it is written somewhere in my
chart that it would.

Like you, Rog/Pedantus, I don't have the answers either. But with all
the hitting the nail on the head of astro. symbolism that I have
experienced subjectively and objectively, I not only believe but now
know that there's more to astrology than any of us have yet learnt.

But..... if that's my free will speaking ? :-)

Best regards,
Christine.

For all the aggravation you've experienced, it would probably be a lot

Then you could run real news reader software and keep all the

Are you willing me another plague to pest-er me? :-)

My problem is that I have two providers until the subscription to the
old one runs out. Both are fighting for dominance ! The new one has a
different user name/password than the old one, BUT
the newsgroup server won't accept the new one because it's still

That's not allowed here, Twain's best work was crafted 2-3 miles from

"born" right here; no doubt inspired by the outspoken and down right
sacastic little brats we have always been..:)  Kurt Vonnegut, in his

Laurel and Hardy", who were also the creation of an Elmiran, along with the

I think I mean that, in general, there is much more to be learned about
astrology by listening and comparing the essential natal chart(s) to the
thought processes of good communicators, like Twain, as opposed to the
artless mundane gibberish of everyday soap operas. The end result of such
study could be a lot more meaningful to humanity than whether or not some
astrologer can predict the outcome of soap operas 51% of the time...:)  I
think Twain would ask, what has been learn if one were actually able to
predict trivial things 100% of the time.  Life as a predictable chonological
mechanism is completely soul-less. There has to be more to life then the
tick tock of what and when.

Yeah, that's exactly what's happening, we are projecting subjective human
psychical organization when we supposedly "objectively" observe the
pattering of symbols employed in an art form. The primary problem with your
example above is that it confuses the semiotic elements of sign versus
symbol.  As well, the meaning of any sign or symbol is totally dependent on
context. The sign" ROGER," as applied to me, is of course meaningless
without a autobiographical novel 55 years in length as a beginning
consideration of context. True context will only be found if the subject has
been the vessel and medium of Art. It is only through art that all things
human come into being; the rest is biology and immune astrological
investigation, due to its complete and total irrelevance.

The question posed by twain is relevant to our questioning of what
astrology could be useful for.  He says it is a matter of Desire, and at any
moment in time we merely choose  to act on the "guidance" as you say, of the
strongest of two desires.  For this reason, we have no will, for we must
choose, and the desire, he say a set of at least two, we feel as impulse(s)
seemingly arising in us unbidden .

I think for purposes of any increase in our Knowledge, the astrologers
only question is, how can I learn about astrology using this data supplied
in this instance, this slice of life specimen under our scope which seems to
express an interacting  organization of symbols from two great human arts.
All quotations like this are Rosetta Stones showing the translations of one
art's symbols in the "context" of the other. This authentic soulful context
gives the power of symbols to the otherwise meaningless signs (glyphs) used
in astrology.  And, events as mere signs , tick or tock, will forever be
without an iota human meaning.

There is no meaningful way to prove that events are other than statistical
coincidence: if you assume events are ordered by some unseen equivalent to
intelligent design of fates, then all arguments for free will are
unsupportable. We live in a subjective human realm where one must chose a
hypothetical or theoretic starting point for what goes with what and why.
This is the art of a personal reality creation motivated primarily by a
desire to *be*.  Sans expression we have no individual human existence
(Terry Schiavo).
The symbols of astrology are only an artistic muse inspired attempt to
synthetically codify Individual-ness and Individuality, *as if* it indeed
exists. This is an important art due to the fact that, presently,
individuality is not satisfactorily defined by any field thought.  No matter
what we pretend to ask, all we are really asking is, who am I, who are you,
do we exist, can we make predictions to convincingly support our hypothesis
of personal existence as a cohesive and separate entity.

The will to remember, according to Twain here,  would also be goaded
into existence by Desire. He would also suggest that any astologist
understandably has no desire to recall his/her failed predictions, for he
dwells on our human foibles..:)  As these do occur every few minutes in the
invisible quietude of our private thoughts, our lack of will to record  the
failure of our many guesses, whether large or small in scope, is the only
explanation for a result other than a statically predictable norm.  Any
source of whatever Desire is, is not describable in terms of  our will to
select one mental impression over another. The "thoughts" that support our
necessary illusion of individual existence and our particularity have
priority.  Twain apparently chooses to see Desire as the a priory "cause"
for the very experience that phenomenon which we usually call an act of
Will.

Whether Twain is correct or not, his natal chart is the only connection
between the astrologist's art , and the art-driven literary expression
employed as the vehicle of the individual existence of the person, the
incidental authoring of Self. Authoring a literary work, is little different
from authoring a model of the self in more communicable terms. Thus the
messenger and the message are, as we often suspect, indeed one, an
indivisible union of the mortal /ephemeral and the immortal/eternal "stuff"
of  human-ness.  Whether our Art is restricted to making grocery lists, or
the production of prodigious novels, the work is our personal opus, the the
symbol-laden evidence for our particular existence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other planet that incorporates Will within its function.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pluto! My ghods, what would we do without that extra kick that comes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from a great Pluto aspect - that incredible force of will?

&gt;&gt;  And, for grins, I thought what if such a creature was born with her Sun
&gt;&gt;conjunct Pluto on my natal Saturn in Virgo. This, I thought, would surely
&gt;&gt;be
&gt;&gt;someone I probably kill in self defence...:)  I googled such a nemisis by
&gt;&gt;noting that such a person would have to be born on September 8, 1966.
&gt;&gt;(Ooooo, so now I'm a virtual cradle robber, she's 16yrs younger than me.):

&gt;&gt;would indeed be a match made in hell...:) :

&gt; Well, yeah, you've got all that planetary action going on, but here's
&gt; the really fun stuff: &quot;She has often talked about her Christian faith,
&gt; and she has been critizised for making critical remarks on the
&gt; acceptance of homosexuality in Sweden. She is or has been a member of
&gt; Christian cult Livets Ord. She was married... After the divorce she
&gt; flaunted her single status by wearing a top saying LEDIG - &quot;Avaliable&quot;
&gt; in Swedish - on national television.&quot;

&gt; ..

&gt; I've noticed a strong connection to several people with their Ur/Pl
&gt; conjunction to my Saturn at 16 Virgo (as well as the Sun, such as my
&gt; mother). I wouldn't call them 'made in hell', but they're definitely
&gt; 'interesting'.

I'm thinking of Rog as poor Odysseus who definitely needs to be tied to
the mast to prevent any self destructive action due to the effect of the
Sirens' presence. If there is any way to avoid a broken hearted suffering in
the presents of these Virgo Suns conjunct my natal Saturn, I haven't the
slightest clue how to behave in myown best interest when their spell is
casted...:)  Avoidance has been most wise in the cause of mental/emotional
health.

Hi Ken,
So glad you have been able to resolve the issues within yourself.

For me, your words have hit another couple of nails firmly on the head
regarding the effect of an Moon-BML aspect that, in your own chart
creates the T-square with Mercury-Neptune.
For Pedantus/Rog, I'd compare it to the sore thumb mentioned in our

&gt;    I think I mean that, in general, there is much more to be learned about
&gt; astrology by listening and comparing the essential natal chart(s) to the
&gt; thought processes of good communicators, like Twain, as opposed to the
&gt; artless mundane gibberish of everyday soap operas. The end result of such
&gt; study could be a lot more meaningful to humanity than whether or not some
&gt; astrologer can predict the outcome of soap operas 51% of the time...:)  I
&gt; think Twain would ask, what has been learn if one were actually able to
&gt; predict trivial things 100% of the time.  Life as a predictable chonological
&gt; mechanism is completely soul-less. There has to be more to life then the
&gt; tick tock of what and when.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have a well-tenanted 9th house :-).
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I am also very Earthy. I'll believe it when I see it. Astrology had to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; prove itself to me by fact, and I honestly don't believe myself to be a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; person that lives in an illusional/delusional state. Astrology proves
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; itself constantly to me...maybe because it is written somewhere in my
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; chart that it would.
&gt; &gt;&gt; \
&gt; &gt;&gt;    Now this is a conflicted mindset...there is no objectivity to
&gt; &gt;&gt; astrology,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and you know it well.

&gt; &gt; I have spent the majority of my life as an astrological
&gt; &gt; student....though not as long as some here :-)..... and a major facet
&gt; &gt; of that study has been to look at astrology from the perspective of
&gt; &gt; objectivity. That means to me that I don't look at planetary configs.
&gt; &gt; and see what I want to see as it has applied to me and/or only been
&gt; &gt; written in books, but what the implication of the astro. symbolism
&gt; &gt; means in itself as applied to the chart of each individual. Elemental
&gt; &gt; influence makes an enormous difference, don't you think ? So how, as an
&gt; &gt; Earthy individual, can I possibly be subjective towards a chart that is
&gt; &gt; all Air or Fire ?

&gt; &gt; O.K., I use the astrological teaching; i.e. Mars is action, Jupiter is
&gt; &gt; expansion, Saturn is chrystalisation etc. as the guide lines through
&gt; &gt; which to attempt chart interpretation,  but I do the same in making 2+2
&gt; &gt; =4,  and R-O-G-E-R = Roger, in attempting to count and spell.
&gt; &gt; You can't surely imply that such is only seeing what one wants to see
&gt; &gt; there as well ?

&gt;   Yeah, that's exactly what's happening, we are projecting subjective human
&gt; psychical organization when we supposedly &quot;objectively&quot; observe the
&gt; pattering of symbols employed in an art form. The primary problem with your
&gt; example above is that it confuses the semiotic elements of sign versus
&gt; symbol.  As well, the meaning of any sign or symbol is totally dependent on
&gt; context. The sign&quot; ROGER,&quot; as applied to me, is of course meaningless
&gt; without a autobiographical novel 55 years in length as a beginning
&gt; consideration of context. True context will only be found if the subject has
&gt; been the vessel and medium of Art. It is only through art that all things
&gt; human come into being; the rest is biology and immune astrological
&gt; investigation, due to its complete and total irrelevance.

&gt; &gt; What I don't believe is 'that it is the planets doing it', but that
&gt; &gt; they represent a symbolism of our inner mechanics at work. For this
&gt; &gt; reason alone I use the word 'guidance' when referring to *my* feelings
&gt; &gt; regarding free will :-)

&gt;   The question posed by twain is relevant to our questioning of what
&gt; astrology could be useful for.  He says it is a matter of Desire, and at any
&gt; moment in time we merely choose  to act on the &quot;guidance&quot; as you say, of the
&gt; strongest of two desires.  For this reason, we have no will, for we must
&gt; choose, and the desire, he say a set of at least two, we feel as impulse(s)
&gt; seemingly arising in us unbidden .

&gt;   I think for purposes of any increase in our Knowledge, the astrologers
&gt; only question is, how can I learn about astrology using this data supplied
&gt; in this instance, this slice of life specimen under our scope which seems to
&gt; express an interacting  organization of symbols from two great human arts.
&gt; All quotations like this are Rosetta Stones showing the translations of one
&gt; art's symbols in the &quot;context&quot; of the other. This authentic soulful context
&gt; gives the power of symbols to the otherwise meaningless signs (glyphs) used
&gt; in astrology.  And, events as mere signs , tick or tock, will forever be
&gt; without an iota human meaning.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Like you, Rog/Pedantus, I don't have the answers either. But with all
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the hitting the nail on the head of astro. symbolism that I have
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; experienced subjectively and objectively, I not only believe but now
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; know that there's more to astrology than any of us have yet learnt.

&gt; &gt;&gt;   I think you have experienced astrology as belief fostered by ignoring
&gt; &gt;&gt; all
&gt; &gt;&gt; the times it doesn't hit the nail.

&gt; &gt; That's your privililege. When one has a transit that corresponds
&gt; &gt; exactly to astrological theory regarding planet, aspect and house, it
&gt; &gt; *is* a bit hard to say, 'Naaah. Coincidence only,&quot; unless you believe
&gt; &gt; life is all based upon a string of coincidences only.

&gt;   There is no meaningful way to prove that events are other than statistical
&gt; coincidence: if you assume events are ordered by some unseen equivalent to
&gt; intelligent design of fates, then all arguments for free will are
&gt; unsupportable. We live in a subjective human realm where one must chose a
&gt; hypothetical or theoretic starting point for what goes with what and why.
&gt; This is the art of a personal reality creation motivated primarily by a
&gt; desire to *be*.  Sans expression we have no individual human existence
&gt; (Terry Schiavo).
&gt;     The symbols of astrology are only an artistic muse inspired attempt to
&gt; synthetically codify Individual-ness and Individuality, *as if* it indeed
&gt; exists. This is an important art due to the fact that, presently,
&gt; individuality is not satisfactorily defined by any field thought.  No matter
&gt; what we pretend to ask, all we are really asking is, who am I, who are you,
&gt; do we exist, can we make predictions to convincingly support our hypothesis
&gt; of personal existence as a cohesive and separate entity.

&gt; &gt; I have a theory that the pain hitting
&gt; &gt;&gt; one's thumb instead of the nail causes the memory of error to retreat
&gt; &gt;&gt; into
&gt; &gt;&gt; the gloom of things not worth noticing.

&gt; &gt; Yet strangely, the one thing I have noticed the most strongly is that
&gt; &gt; people remember the hard aspects and/or harsh times....when the thumb
&gt; &gt; is hit, and forget more easily those times when, as a result of a
&gt; &gt; trine,  it apparently missed altogether :-)

&gt;     The will to remember, according to Twain here,  would also be goaded
&gt; into existence by Desire. He would also suggest that any astologist
&gt; understandably has no desire to recall his/her failed predictions, for he
&gt; dwells on our human foibles..:)  As these do occur every few minutes in the
&gt; invisible quietude of our private thoughts, our lack of will to record  the
&gt; failure of our many guesses, whether large or small in scope, is the only
&gt; explanation for a result other than a statically predictable norm.  Any
&gt; source of whatever Desire is, is not describable in terms of  our will to
&gt; select one mental impression over another. The &quot;thoughts&quot; that support our
&gt; necessary illusion of individual existence and our particularity have
&gt; priority.  Twain apparently chooses to see Desire as the a priory &quot;cause&quot;
&gt; for the very experience that phenomenon which we usually call an act of
&gt; Will.

&gt;   Whether Twain is correct or not, his natal chart is the only connection
&gt; between the astrologist's art , and the art-driven literary expression
&gt; employed as the vehicle of the individual existence of the person, the
&gt; incidental authoring of Self. Authoring a literary work, is little different
&gt; from authoring a model of the self in more communicable terms. Thus the
&gt; messenger and the message are, as we often suspect,

Hi again Pedantus/Rog,

There is, indeed, much more that can be learned about astrology and,
imho, it's the soap bubbles produced in and by the soap operas of real
life experience that offer the learning techniques, and not merely the
'thought processes of good communicators, like Twain' that are not

You look at our teaching/learning of symbolic language in a different
and complex intellectual manner than I can understand and take it
further than the scope of the discussion of this thread.
R-O-G-E-R is a manner of spelling I understand and can work with, as is
astro. symbolism. If the same letters were written in Chinese or
Indian characters, I wouldn't understand what is written, just as I
don't understand Chinese or Vedic astrology, and couldn't work with
them. That is the point I was attempting to make.

You seem to be of the opinion that I believe in free will that is not
in any way impaired by an outer force. My original reply to Ken 100
posts back merely suggested that the Sun *represents* an unhampered
free will, but that any planetary aspect made to it will enhance how
free will is experienced by the individual. There doesn't even seem to
be agreement that the Sun *does* represent free will and, if not, what
does.
As I have said several times before, if astrology represents nothing
more than statistical coincidence, it's the closest thing to a Super
Intelligence that I have yet encountered.

I do find it coincidental that Twain had a Sun-Mars conjunction and
that astrological teaching sees 'desire' as a Mars influence. He would
probably have felt the two-way pull more than someone who does not have
such an influence in their chart. His theology would seem to oppose
that of Bhudda (apparently a Taurean Sun :-) ), or am I seeing that
incorrectly?

Christine.

Thanks, Ruth

I completely empathize with the astrologist's objective-v-subjective
conundrum, but I see no reason to help propagate any separatists ideological
agenda, Science and Art are one only if we give unto Caesar what is
Caesar's.  Objectivity defines the parameters of all things reasonable.  The
un-reasonable mental habits of astrologists need not be the very definition
of astrology. We must skeptically and honestly address the question of
astrology's "domain,"  it is, an always has been, an inspiringly beautiful
art, and it engenders some of the very best achievements of our human
creativity.
Objectivity should allow us to see that our perceptions are the
miraculous and quite improbable reality of a inexplicably conscious
chemically driven organism.  Science fortunately tells us what astrology is
*not*. Our job is to define astrology with in the objective standards, and
not merely one of heretics advocacy which driven by a kind of sectarian
religious fervor.  We may objectively observe that there is a very real
possibility that not all persons are communicating information that is both
worthy of our sincere consideration and relevant to astrological
codification.
We observe the mass of humanity as a spectrum of possible sources for
information. The normal distribution concept we  inherit from the science's
*should* alert us to the distinct possibility that 85% of all the people we
observe may be transmitting mostly  astrological "noise."  I submit that
because we are observing the art of the Self's existence, that the artistic
integrity of the sample persons we hope to learn from is always in question.
In short, the clientele of a professional astrologer may actually contain
few if any samplings of sufficient human individuality to be considered as
fairly representing a valid comparison of their hypothetical natal
potentials.
Not that I agree with a lot of Dane Rudhyar pontificating, but I think
he objectively describe the natal chart as a case of what "should be" for
the native in question.  I go a little further and say, the fact that
persons may not reflect their individual natal charts is thus to be expected
as the rule--the objective statistical norm, not the exception that sends
the astrologist looking for an additional "influence" of some asteroid, or
space pebble, to account for the inconsistency he/she observes. Only the
pre-condition of one's sufficient art of personhood  is capable of
presenting the evidence of individuality that is necessary for valid
art-based correlation.  No measure individuality exists if it is not
successfully communicated--faithfully rendered and faithfully perceived.
Astrology is the art of faithful individuality perception.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Maybe it's my stubborness, or may be I'm seeing what I want to see.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What I don't see is his Sun aspected to the 9th house,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    I don't recall saying that it was. I was letting Twain's chart
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;speak&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for itself...;)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Ah; but such an aspect is what I have been predicating as a
&gt;&gt; &gt; pre-requisite as to how 'belief' in 'free will' is experienced :-)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; even if Jupiter
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is in its natural house and the Sun is in Sagittarius. Twain may
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; had many high-falluting philosophies and beliefs but, in my very
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; humble
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; opinion, the belief in free will wasn't one of them.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Ahhh...thats what he said, Christine.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Which, then,  the horsocope chart apparently proves :-)

&gt;&gt;  The example was offered as a case study which incidentally supports you
&gt;&gt; proposition while broadening the perspective to include several
&gt;&gt; planet/aspect considerations.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  His force of will (sun trine Pluto)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; must have been very a very compelling part of his nature.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Maybe Tom and Huck were autobiographical in some way.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    That has got to be the understatement of the year award winner,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hands
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; down!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    Twain was both Tom and Huck...you wanted a split belief system,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; go..:)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Is that favourable for me ?:-)

&gt;&gt;   Never crossed my mind...:)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That charts show whether one believes or not believes in whatever,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that astrology works, is a matter of personal belief in the power of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; astro. symbolism.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    I thinks it more a matter of paying attention.

&gt;&gt; &gt; O.K., I use the astrological teaching; i.e. Mars is action, Jupiter is
&gt;&gt; &gt; expansion, Saturn is chrystalisation etc. as the guide lines through
&gt;&gt; &gt; which to attempt chart interpretation,  but I do the same in making 2+2
&gt;&gt; &gt; =4,  and R-O-G-E-R = Roger, in attempting to count and spell.
&gt;&gt; &gt; You can't surely imply that such is only seeing what one wants to see
&gt;&gt; &gt; there as well ?

&gt;&gt;   Yeah, that's exactly what's happening, we are projecting subjective
&gt;&gt; human
&gt;&gt; psychical organization when we supposedly &quot;objectively&quot; observe the
&gt;&gt; pattering of symbols employed in an art form. The primary problem with
&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt; example above is that it confuses the semiotic elements of sign versus
&gt;&gt; symbol.  As well, the meaning of any sign or symbol is totally dependent
&gt;&gt; on
&gt;&gt; context. The sign&quot; ROGER,&quot; as applied to me, is of course meaningless
&gt;&gt; without a autobiographical novel 55 years in length as a beginning
&gt;&gt; consideration of context. True context will only be found if the subject
&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; been the vessel and medium of Art. It is only through art that all things
&gt;&gt; human come into being; the rest is biology and immune astrological
&gt;&gt; investigation, due to its complete and total irrelevance.

&gt; You look at our teaching/learning of symbolic language in a different
&gt; and complex intellectual manner than I can understand and take it
&gt; further than the scope of the discussion of this thread.
&gt; R-O-G-E-R is a manner of spelling I understand and can work with, as is
&gt; astro. symbolism. If the same letters were written in Chinese or
&gt; Indian characters, I wouldn't understand what is written, just as I
&gt; don't understand Chinese or Vedic astrology, and couldn't work with
&gt; them. That is the point I was attempting to make.

&gt; [..]
&gt;&gt;   There is no meaningful way to prove that events are other than
&gt;&gt; statistical
&gt;&gt; coincidence: if you assume events are ordered by some unseen equivalent
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; intelligent design of fates, then all arguments for free will are
&gt;&gt; unsupportable. We live in a subjective human realm where one must chose a
&gt;&gt; hypothetical or theoretic starting point for what goes with what and why.

&gt; You seem to be of the opinion that I believe in free will that is not
&gt; in any way impaired by an outer force. My original reply to Ken 100
&gt; posts back merely suggested that the Sun *represents* an unhampered
&gt; free will, but that any planetary aspect made to it will enhance how
&gt; free will is experienced by the individual. There doesn't even seem to
&gt; be agreement that the Sun *does* represent free will and, if not, what
&gt; does.
&gt; As I have said several times before, if astrology represents nothing
&gt; more than statistical coincidence, it's the closest thing to a Super
&gt; Intelligence that I have yet encountered.

&gt;&gt;     The symbols of astrology are only an artistic muse inspired attempt
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; synthetically codify Individual-ness and Individuality, *as if* it indeed
&gt;&gt; exists. This is an important art due to the fact that, presently,
&gt;&gt; individuality is not satisfactorily defined by any field thought.  No
&gt;&gt; matter
&gt;&gt; what we pretend to ask, all we are really asking is, who am I, who are
&gt;&gt; you,
&gt;&gt; do we exist, can we make predictions to convincingly support our
&gt;&gt; hypothesis
&gt;&gt; of personal existence as a cohesive and separate entity.

&gt; For many people those are important questions and if astrology can help
&gt; provide them with answers to make their lives more 'wholesome', it is
&gt; an art that has not been created in vain.
&gt; [..]
&gt;&gt;   The question posed by twain is relevant to our questioning of what
&gt;&gt; astrology could be useful for.  He says it is a matter of Desire, and at
&gt;&gt; any
&gt;&gt; moment in time we merely choose  to act on the &quot;guidance&quot; as you say, of
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; strongest of two desires.  For this reason, we have no will, for we must
&gt;&gt; choose, and the desire, he say a set of at least two, we feel as
&gt;&gt; impulse(s)
&gt;&gt; seemingly arising in us unbidden .

&gt; I do find it coincidental that Twain had a Sun-Mars conjunction and
&gt; that astrological teaching sees 'desire' as a Mars influence. He would
&gt; probably have felt the two-way pull more than someone who does not have
&gt; such an influence in their chart. His theology would seem to oppose
&gt; that of Bhudda (apparently a Taurean Sun :-) ), or am I seeing that
&gt; incorrectly?

There is no prediction based on a natal chart that can indicate who will

All astrology has proven so far is that some people like to play at

It is not sincere to only pay lip service to objectivity; that kind of

From a skeptical point of veiw, all I do is "cherry pick" the words that
serve my purpose.  A googled list of 41 quotations for Cheney yeilds only

Cheney is being more faithfully represented as an individual, but the
standard for that measure is difficult to impossible to objectify...a true

It's true that we, astrologers, find it hard to predict at birth the
individuation of the chart factors in terms of sole fulfillment, like
how comes that this one is famous in that subject and that one is famous
in this subject, but the factors are there, one, and two, we can say
that there will be such and such developments in the life of the native
to an astounding degree of accuracy in terms of time and concrete
details. This is true as the daylight outside, the inaccuracy will be to
deny it.

To this, I hasten to add that it all boils down to the accuracy of the
birth data, and the competence and the efficiency of the astrologer in
question.

I'd like to add to that the indisputable fact that the traditional
planets suffice in this attempt, and the ancients did excellent jobs w
them, to gether w fixed stars, arabian parts and systems of prediction.
This is not to say that new bodies won't come to our aid, they will, but
the old ones are enough, if one wants to work w them, only.

The Astrologers Fund, Inc. at least put some careful money where its mouth
is, BUT:
"This information is not intended to be used as the sole basis of any
investment decisions, nor should it be construed as advice designed to meet
the investment needs of any particular investor. "

In other words, astrology is not an effective predictor of individual
stocks,  the individual investor does not exist in the "objective"
astrological reality .

&gt; Night and day. Mars isn't remotely Scorpionic. And Pluto isn't

It's worth bearing in mind that the vast majority of astrologers today
are not to be found in the West, but in India, a nation of one billion
souls, which still uses traditional planets and traditional
rulerships. The Western brand of astrology is only a small part of the
picture, although as practitioners of it we tend to puff it up as
though it's the only relevant part. It isn't.

Using traditional astrology doesn't need to imply a stuck in the past
mindset. Ask Lee Lehman, or Bernadette Brady.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  In other words, astrology is not an effective predictor of
&gt;&gt;&gt; individual stocks,  the individual investor does not exist in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;objective&quot; astrological reality .

&gt;&gt; -- Are we talking about stock predictions, or about predictions re
&gt;&gt; men and other affairs, too? B/c stock is hard to do, though not
&gt;&gt; impossible, either, and in any case, the dismissal of the (amazing,
&gt;&gt; astounding, and, sometimes, even incredible for their insight)
&gt;&gt; predictive powers of astrology, in particular, and of other tools, in
&gt;&gt; gen, is to say that a part of reality is non-existent, which is pure
&gt;&gt; denial. It's not exact science, but then neither is science as such,
&gt;&gt; ultimately, otherwise there wouldn't be new theories every Monday and
&gt;&gt; Wednesday in every conceivable field.

&gt;&gt; As there are parts of the spectrum unseen to our eyes, but visible to
&gt;&gt; other eyes, of other animals, so there is another part of the
&gt;&gt; spectrum of reality unseen to the material eyes, but perfectly
&gt;&gt; visible to other types of eyes.

Dan,
I have tried to be more objective about whatever quirky nonsense
astrology is, simply because I'm just naturally wired to reject the opinions
of authority figures...:)

Look at this page from _google images_ :
http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Andy...

Like an elephant that senses the unseen tsunami, I immediately sensed the
artist was born with Sun conjunct Uranus, and probably trine Saturn.
Now when you attempt to find Andy's birthday via google, you won't, just
his birth year.

Using astrolog I set up a chart for the middle of 56', then noticed I
could get the aspects I wanted by using the animate feature, tapping a day
at a time, until finally seeing a chart for July 25, 1956....Sun exactly
conjunct Uranus.

The birth date *is* correct, but one has to locate that data in a
chronology list from a biography text.  There was a college student who had
that data, and it could be googled, at the time, she's moved on I guess, by
entering [ "Goldsworthy born July 25, 1956" ].

I only got confirmation due to the fact that I could "guess" the right
date to start with!...:)

Try that without Uranus being available....:)

Here's a chart pic, I'm trying on different images of his works to perhaps
discover his (unknown, to us) birth *time*....:)
http://pedantus.free.fr/Goldsworthy_01a.gif

And you can bet I would have been proud to share this information with the
"old ones," had Uranus been available at the time.

Ahh.....its available now..."old one"...:)

-- Now, that's a tricky one you put on, Rog, but I gave it a look. Okay,
let's see what we can do w it. Remember, though, that I *don't* dismiss
the new ones, what I say is that they have *only* an *additional* value
to the one *already shown* in the chart.

I will try, now, to understand what you did in assuming the Ura/Sun
touch, the type of which you didn't mention, so I'll have to guess that
you hinted at the type of artistic talent shown in his pics. But why you
did it, I don't understand, since, and *this* is important, Sun/Ura is
not artistic, it's conducive to "...scientific or literary career;
averse to conventional occupations ...(and) ... very frequently
indicative of great talent (w/o mentioning the type of talent, DB)."
(Carter). (I understand that you "see" some message in the pic and
connect it to the chart features.)

On the other hand, if *I* were to guess his birth data, I'd look, using
only the olds, at a strong and positive Ven aspect to Mo, like the
trine: "...they are valuable to statesmen and politicians, and... They
have a more widely recognized (compared to the former, DB) value to the
artist ..." (Carter).

Now, using Mo for a trine, you pinpoint it within a span of 20 deg's:
Ven 25 Gem +- 10 deg's, allowing for an orb between 15 Gem and 5 Pis,
giving a time span of ~ 40 hrs and a Mo in Pis/Ari, or Lib/Sco, two
birth dates.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From them, I'd choose the Pis Mo, which leaves me w a span of 5 deg's -
">

0 to 5 deg's Pis, a location much more conducive to artistic talent than
a Sco, or even a Lib one. Mo can be in those 0-5 deg's of Pis for only
~10 hrs, giving me 10 hrs of possible birth time, **less** than half a
day, between ~4:30 am and ~3 pm of July 25, '56.

Comparing the two, almost exact, times of ours, I *have* to choose the
Mo/Ven aspect, b/c of its decisive artistic inclination, one which is
not found in Sun/Ura aspect.

Now, w this bull's eye hit, I'd be proud to talk to Lilly et al, and
then, come back and share the experience w you.

But, so as not to die stupid, you know, hehe, pls tell me what are you
exactly doing in superimposing the pic on a chart to find the data of a
native (if this is what you're doing). I'm truly curious.

This post of mine to Rog, has, admittedly, one flaw, namely that Mo
repeats itself each mth, and so, there are to be found a few trines to
Ven along the way during the course of one yr. BUT, not to lose hope and
heart, even so, using the artistic inclinations in a planet/sign
characteristics, one can find the date of birth as well.

Also, as I said, Sun/Ura has no artistic trait, so I just wonder, Rog.

Pluto plays a pretty prominent role in my chart too, and tells me a
lot about the way I operate. However, if I leave it out of my chart,
my chart still tells me quite a bit about me.

If it didn't, we might as well give up on astrology now - it would
mean that any chart that astrolgers prior to 1930 cast would be
meaningless. If you accept that Chiron is important in a chart (and I
do), it would imply any chart we cast before 1977 would also be
meaningless.  And if the new planet discovered recently (nicknamed
Xena) turns out to be significant, then any charts we've done up to
now are meaningless. Should we give all our clients refunds?

I try not to let it drive me insane, but yes, it would be great to finally
develop a means to determine who will likely be projective in an more easily
observable form.  I think the key to a repeatable "experiment" is knowing
how to identify the persons who are actually participating in a given task,
and who, perhaps a majority, is by nature virtually mute in that regard.
Unfortunately, at present, I can only forsee a test that surveys the
difference between exceptional persons.

But I like the timeless quality of this perspective. I like the fact that
one can read Ezekiel , for instance, deduce that he likely has Saturn in
Aries, ala "a forehead of flint," then go check for a suggested birth year
and discover that the year -622 does indeed show Saturn in Aries.
Being that most persons must beg and borrow metaphor, off the rack, so
to speak, then wear it as a Self-suit, whether it fits well or not, what
seems most needed is a means to be objective about the authentic
individual-ness of the speaker's "creative" projections.

Oh, well, at the very least, we can, by impoverished hindsight, better
appreciate things like Clinton's Mar/Nep conjunction, in Libra, on the Asc.,
as *his* Self-defining uncertain definition of, "is."   ....:)

Trait?  Hmmm...let's call it an *expression*.  Sun/Ura has an expression
to be observed, when we are able, and when we are allowed by nature to
perceive the symbolic contents of communicative human interactions. Art is
simply the means, any means,  by which the consciousness of one mind/soul is
symbolically made available to another.

Dan, whether or not planets have "influences" in the traditional view, we
do assign to them qualities based on our human experiences--our outer and
inner experiences; that of sights , sounds, and reactive feelings and mental
impressions--our human psychology.  We have both relatively complex and
simple experiences.  Thus Uranus, *can* be associated with  complex issuses
like Prometheus stealing fire from the gods...aviation and electronic
invention, or just mere personal eccentricity, or even the compulsive
reclusiveness of a hermit.  All of which would apply to Howard Hughes --Sun
conjunct Uranus opposite Neptune.
But for Salvadore Dali who has the same Ura/Nep opposition, but does
*not* have a Sun/Ura conjunction, we see that Uranus is reduced in scope to
a simpler experience, that of a startingling "buzz" sound that "causes" a
little dream which awakens his wife.
http://pedantus.free.fr/Dali_Bee_01.gif
http://pedantus.free.fr/Dali_S_01.gif

So, Howard Hughes = Sun Capricorn conjunct Uranus = creates/invents modern
aviation
Savadore Dali =  Sun Taurus conjunct Mars =  paints a sharp objects
that point at the throat.

We see a different scale of expression and different planets
expressed.

Uranus ala Goldsworthy is a more vibration or oscillation depicted as
repetitions, or spirals, or parallel wavy lines---the visual appearance of a
"buzzing" noise. See this example of eloquent simplicity:
http://pedantus.free.fr/Goldsworthy_02.gif

this picture is of spiraling layers of colored leaves layered on the
ground--it is a temporary artwork meant to 'decay' naturally over time...it
is, astrologically speaking, Sun conjunct Uranus, and very likely Sun trine
Saturn--Sun = circular object + Saturn = Black color.

It is not about planets defining "talent," Dan; its about the specific
human psychological projections we just happen to call planets when we are
thinking astrologically.  You are probably correct about associations that
seem to indicate persons who may have "talent", but if you don't see the
specific signal which talent allows to be emitted--projected out into the
world of perceptions, then any argument for the presence of talent in
general it is just a moot point. Talented people disappoint me all the
time...:)  ( Mooo....:)

We are not identical herd members when we individually express ourselves,
symbolically, via any of our many artistic ways of being in the world.  But,
apparently, no power on earth can make persons express that individuality in
a predetermined media or form.

&gt; Staying in the dark is living in the past. The ignorance of the dark ages

&gt; outrgageous beliefs back then based on total ignorance that did nothing
&gt; more than instill fear in people. That was a sign of the times--fear. So
&gt; if a person was raised with a fearful Saturn, then sure, it wouldn't
&gt; surprise me to see people stuck in the past that supports the same kind of
&gt; fear they were raised with. If you feel you have no free will, you won't.
&gt; You will also subscribe to thought patterns that reinforce the negative

&gt; said, come into the light already!

&gt;&gt; It seems that this is an endless debate, in which I have no further
&gt;&gt; interest, so let's leave it as it is, please -)

&gt; I responded because it was my free will choice to do so. Something you
&gt; don't think people have.

Heather, I don't know if I could get away with characterizing your
response as being "angry," &lt;duck!&gt; but I used to have a very
impatient/intolerant response to the way traditionalists label
things...seemed like an injustice was being done to a sacred art, whatever.
I feel better now that I can show Dan and others that the *real* world of
human experiences is aesthetically logical, not, "scientific."

There is *no* convincing argument in philosophy for the existence of
either freedom or free will! That being said, all those things we imagine to
choose would be our Art in action, not the vastly controling scientifically
conceivable forces of determinism.
Yes, a belief in free will has no rational foundation to warrant its
actual existence. Free will amounts to no more than a human predjudice from
sheer ignorance; so be it.  What we do choose is evidence and proof of our
Muse inspired art of individual being-ness.
There is also no reasonableness to the "influence" of astrology's
planets, etc., so, a deterministic astrologer is only incidentally correct
in his essentially arbitrary choice to see deterministic forces at work in
astrology.  Truth is, astrologers choose the art as a means to express their
imaginary free will.  This choosing the art of astrology is of course not
individually defining in any significant way...astrologers remain
indistinguishable members of humanity's herd.
It is the *products* of one's art, in general, which seem to mirror the
existence of individual persons.  The figure of an individual will only
standout against the backgound sights and sounds of our collective existence
when his art results in some product with "soul". IOW, brushing one's teeth
is truly a work of art, but it is not an act or product with much soul...:)
The Art you often like to point to is Fine Art, etc., so we are really
talking about the scale and particularity of the art which either has or
does not have a soul mirroring quality.

I suggest, in deterministic fashion, that the products of human art
cannot help but mirror the soul of the "artist"; and, the relative quality
of the art performed is a matter of how well the soul of the individual and
the soul of the collective are mirrored in an artistic product.  If
astrology, as an art, wishes to distinguish its actually existence in the
feild of mans arts, it must have more than alluremand spell binding mystery,
it must have a relative objective quality which facilitate our analytical
mind to see the truth of astrology.  At this time no such objectivity
exists, only the freely pusued will, the predjudice and ignorance, of its
would be artists...myself included, in case we missed that point...:)

Huh?  Its just a polarity.  You can't tell me that if you find spoiled
milk in your fridge that you will let the predermined decision to have
some milk override your choice to dump the stuff...    We have DEGREES
OF FREEDOM.   If you have no cash to feed your self you have
considerably fewer degrees of freedom than when you're a rich country.

Anyhow... if we don't recognize shades of between-ness as operating on
a hot/cold axis, then we get stuck in the mirror cabinet the indians
call Maya.

To get out of Maya you need to use reason properly.  Assertions like
yours which imply that 'no rational foundation' is a bad, wrong, or
perhaps even unnatural thing -- when seen in the context of Maya --
serve to educate you and hopefully get you out of this polarizing

Did you ever hear of Buckminster Fuller?   He used to remind us that
Industrial Wastes are resources we've not yet learned to understand and
use.

In the same way, when you say 'so be it', you're treating subjectivity,
personal experience and subtle observations as some would a toxic waste
dump.

subjectivity may feel like that too you -- but its not like you've
never changed your mind on anything. Before you learned about
geography, other countries were entirely mystical in your mind.

I suggest that its more useful to let profound truths oppose each other
so that we can be illuminated by the polarities that arise from
thinking about them.  Polarity/Duality just creates the space in which
we explore the world..    i have/ i dont have --- man/woman --- you
must know those splits!?   you must have learned about and from them --
they must have settled into some sort of union for you. -- the must
have shown you that they are continuums, not absolutes.

In their relation we live and learn.  Both sides are true/false; It
does not matter. Its the distance between them that makes us able to
approach and contain BOTH POLES.

Really now?    So you've bashed a bunch of pseudo explanations. BFD!
I'm an astrologer and I willingly laugh with you at the best efforts
from the past to explain these mysteries.

We were not able to express 'Everything is Relative', 'Everything is
dual'  until we had Einstein, Jung, and had the whole Planet
ENLIGHTENED by electric lights and many very well intentioned people
had their teaching metaphors used against them.

But understand this:   Astrology is the logic of the stars. Its about
thinking like the stars, Its not about thinking like the grass on your
lawn or the individual in a group. Its about really big thoughts.

And the thing with Stars is that they have things in orbit.  Can you
even imagine the scope of this insight?   For heretics to say "I'm a
Star, I think big thought" when the earth was flat is just incredible
to me.

So what if some well meaning folks back then or me today attempt to
communicate about a network of complexity with 12 compartments, 7
patterns arising from 4 ingredients that spring from a single source...
and we wind up using terms that you can polarize against.

Its entertaining to see the heathens polarize to good/bad, right/wrong
instantly on just about anything you put in front of them.  If you do
it intellectually through a medium like this its not quite as amusing
than when you can put emotion, passion and gestures in the picture, but
the point is that,  rightly or wrongly, completely or incompletely --
you're spending time dismissing teaching and communication tools that
just were not for you.

I encourage you to tear my logic apart instead.  I do this stuff for a
living and I understand it from the bottom up and the top down. Its
MUCH MORE PROFOUND than people typically know or let on.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; so, a deterministic astrologer is only incidentally correct

OK ... that means you think astrology is QUANTITATIVE.

A lot of my peers would disagree with you on that, but none more
vehemently than I, I suppose.

So let me paint you the extreme position from the perspective of the
circle, screw the signs and planets for the moment, ok?

Astrology is a relational qualitative science that is the algebra of
everything.  And by everything I mean the extrinsic and intrinsic, the
external and internal, the rational and the irrational, the
quantitative and the qualitative.

No I'm not slipping up by admitting to a quantitative component. I've
merely put it into perspective here so that its not isolated, subject
to getting mugged in a dark alley.

I could rule out potential friends because I dont like their shoes.
Jumping on well meaning people who practice 'the astrology of pointing'
.. and then dismissing the entire system might be called intellectual
dishonesty if it happened in a field understood by more than a few;
I'm taking point on rationalizing this art/science and I too have no
sympathy for flatland simpleminded chart-readers;

Just don't dismiss the strength of a system that's far older than out
current day infatuation with the quarter of life occupied by thought ..
or that quarter occupied by material science!

This logic of the stars has been there. Its built into every atom and
the fundamental forces in every atom 'speak' the same funky language
the mystics have been speaking (or was that the other way around?) as
each and every one of them retraces the evolution of matter into
passionate living thinking systems -- modelled on and patterned after
the whole.

As for arbitrary... uh... I'm suddenly feeling very deterministic.
There's an algebra to this and its rooted in fundamental forces.  Its
not arbitrary at all and if you know the algebra you can sort out,
enhance, clarify and validate the often simple minded rules people talk
about.

Having said this, there is of course choice. We can procrastinate
'salvation/ redemption/ enlightenment' et all at will.  There's cause
and effect fortunately to remind us that if we don't pay the bills,
they'll take the house or car etc.

that's an earth-element maintenance function. its not art; its craft.

craft is good.

if you were to make a show of brushing your teeth on stage you'd have
to artfully blend it with fire.

if you were to write a paper on the hows and whys you'd have to
artfully blend it with air.

if you were to share with your friend about how it feels to brush your
teeth you'd be blending it with water.

the blending of two elements is the crowning achievment of many
to integrate three of them is rarely seen as possible by most, yet
still frequent.
to blend all four is the aim.
that's the ultimate art.

I see that you've realized the value of the blending.  Now don't be
mistaken to think that your way of blending is the only one.  There are
six elemental combinations that run on two way each for a total of
twelve blending formulas which each produce a third thing.

i know thats so f* obscure its not fair to just leave it like this ;)
.. so here's an example:

if you were to make a show of brushing your teeth on stage you'd have
to artfully blend it with fire. --- you're create one of two things:

one would be a cancerian effect where you connect by exposing your
subjective quirky self;  the other would be a sagittarian effect where
you'd connect by making hilarious logical observations about the world.

thus --- unblended logic is just a craft and the people that dont blend
it with sensation, emotion or inspiration are 'plane-locked' shallow
caricatures of this soulfullness you describe.   blending is where the
art is -- and as a qualitative science, astrology has the edge.

I agree with you Michael --- And I'd like to add that the sign on the
cusp of the houses containing moon/mercury respectively makes all the
difference.

For example -- Cancer mercury with gemini on the cusp will speak far
more freely than with cancer on the cusp.. and above the horizon
they'll know what they are saying; below its far less obvious to them.

Doubly true with cancer, the sign of the moon and that on its house
will indicate the content of the mind and how its accessed. .. that's
the old 'potential meets circumstance' thing.

Wishing you and everyone else a happy New Year.

but it often wrong until above the horizon.. or so the rule goes)

"[..] COMMUNICATION AS INTERACTION IN SYNERGY WITH UNCERTAINTY

Vladimir Dimitrov

(School of Social Ecology, UWS-Hawkesbury, Richmond 2753.
v.dimit ... @uws.edu.au ).

A version of this paper has been submitted for presentation at the Inaugural
Scientific Conference of the Australian Institute of Socio-Analysis, ANU,
Canberra, 24-28 January 1998

Introduction

Communication is a manifestation of life. The stunning diversity and
spontaneity of life-events are continuously revealed through communication.
Life starts with communication and ends when the ability to communicate
ceases. In between these two points, uncertainty is an inevitable companion
of any communication process.

Everyday communication is deeply rooted in people's experience stored up in
the form of instincts, memory, behavioural patterns, various conceptual and
emotional associations. Human experience can be individual as well as a
common inheritance and, as long as this inheritance predominates,
communication is essentially about the past.

"[..]In human systems those subtle forces are perceivable as they are always
embodied in some specific real vortices (e.g., clash of ideas, views,
attitudes, cultures, feelings) constantly arising in the flow of every
individual life. This is the reason for calling them vortical forces.[..]  "

This reference seems pretty much to the point, like the rotation of
cyclonic storms, as the search for wear relatively hot meets the reletively
cold. But the spriraling in not pointless, it creates the "point," gives
rise to the existence of meaning:

http://www.pnc.com.au/~lfell/vladimir.html
"[..]
One can find many examples of so called 'trivial communication', where no
meaning is created. In those examples, the thoughts and feelings, expressed
in communication process, seem to be in a kind of 'standstill' - without
intellectual or emotional drive and zeal. As usual, any once-for-ever
adopted behavioural pattern, any habit and stereotype, as well as any
'borrowed'-from-outside viewpoint and argument, intends to impose frozen
patterns in the space of human thoughts and feelings.

The vortices in communication cannot be formed by meanings already known to
the communicators. The already known meanings bring forth either a passive
'groupthink' (manifested in the former East-European communist societies) or
exhaustive competition (manifested in the present Western democracies).

It is the unknown reflected in existential uncertainty that

a.. pulls people towards creative discussions, debates, negotiation.
b.. makes people's thoughts and feelings flow and move out of the frozen
zones of equilibrium (no matter how desirable, suitable and comfortable
these zones might appear at first sight), and not to be trapped into the
standstill of any pre-selected, 'scientifically'-proved or simply
taken-for-granted mental or emotional patterns.
c.. interconnects different and even entirely opposite opinions and
beliefs - either through various feedback interactions or through
complementarity.
d.. transforms communication from a mere information exchange into a
creative search for meaning.
The unknown, felt and experienced in different ways by different
individuals, serves as a powerful catalyst for the formation of
communication vortices.

I'm not sure if I'm smart enough to form the question I have concerning
the opposition of those two words...something seem a little askew there
perhaps....feels more like an inconjunction...:)
If you check the charts of writer's I think that you will the opposition
aspect is the framework of all significant instances of compare and contrast
expository writing strategies/motifs.  Example: Nietzsche's Sun opposite
Pluto theme, versus his Mars opp Jupiter theme, versus his Mercury opp
Uranus theme.  It would be hard to use the words hostile or complimentary
concerning this dynamic tension, as some call it.

I'm not sure salvation is possible....:)

And, certainly expect very little from isolated words; I think the
objective component of astrology, as scarce as it may be,  is better sought
in the study of astrology as a semiotic system.  The "logical" hunt for
whatever astrology actually is seems based on the act translating the
symbolism of a person's creative products, all that in which we may find
objective-seeming correlations to the abstract algebraic symbolisms of
astrology.  This we may proceed to refine in terms of a better understanding
of the individual natives private, unconsciously construed, meanings and the
relationships between the signifier and the signified...ala the particular
individual.  Signifiers, any unit of contextually founded meaning being
communicated , given that such things are instinctively or reflexively
chosen by the native, *should* divulge a natal chart pattern of related
astrological symbolisms. We must be much better at recognizing the
individual as a projector of  authentic self symbols.

I tend to agree with Jacques Lacan's uses the terms "expression" and
"content" to describe the nature of semiological signifiers. The problem of
finding the explicit *individual* content of a native's expressions, which
are normally found inundated with implicit collective connections galore, is
no mean task.  Ex: "ankle-biting flak" has a certain uniqueness, seems a
good candidate for some small particle at the level of explicit self
symbolism, but is it a creative projection?  Or, is also a common specimen
of something too contaminated with "borrowed" social context to be of any
use in our attempt at defining the native as an astrologically patterned
individual.  Does it have sufficient poetic content, does the content
literally reflect the pattern of a specific person?

It is however much easier to show you that I both understand and somewhat
agree with your observations concerning the Aqu/Leo opposition axis.  But I
do so in a much more explicit and particular manner.  I use visual imagery
to demonstrate the explicit forms of the things your generalizations
speculatively imply.

Example:  Here is a painter unacquainted with the astrology's symbol
vocabulary, but apparently he may actually tap into the Jungian collective
pool of signifiers, whether these be either innately or (unconsciously)
acquired by way of life experience:

http://pedantus.free.fr/CZA_1.gif
http://pedantus.free.fr/CZA_1b.gif
http://pedantus.free.fr/CZA_1a.gif

Here, I usually let the illustration speak for itself, I've no wish to
deprive the viewer of an open-ended personal observation and perhaps a sense
of discovery. This though I have many wonder parallels I would love to
expound upon, (if only for the sake of a typically leonine bit of self
indulgence....:)
