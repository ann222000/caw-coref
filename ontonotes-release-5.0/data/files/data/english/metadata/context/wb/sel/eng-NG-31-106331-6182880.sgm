What are the virtues of belief?
In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

Surely We created man of the best pattern; then We reduced him to the
lowest of the low, save those who believe and do good deeds. (95:4-6)

Belief is a relation which connects man to his Maker
Man, through the light of belief, attains to the highest degree of
perfection and acquires a value worthy of Paradise. With the darkness
of unbelief, he is reduced to the lowest of the low and falls to a
position to deserve Hell. For belief is a relation which connects man
to his Majestic Maker. Man's value derives from his demonstration of
divine art and the manifestation of Divine Names through his belief.
Unbelief breaks off this relation; in consequence of it, the divine
art is veiled and the value of man is reduced to the worth of his mere
physical entity. The physical entity of man is of almost no value for
it is perishable and consists of a transient animal. We will explain
this truth by way of a parable:

In a work of art, the value of the material of which it is made,
differs from the value of the art that is expressed in it. Sometimes
the two may be of the same value, and sometimes it happens that five
dollars' worth of art is to be found in material like iron worth five
cents. Sometimes, even, an antique work of art will fetch as much as a
million dollars while its material is not even worth a few cents. If
this antique is taken to the antiques market, it may be sold for its
true value because of the art it contains and the name of the
brilliant artist who fashioned it. Whereas, this work of art may only
be sold for the price of its iron in the blacksmith's market.

Man is a unique, priceless work of the art of God whom He created to
manifest all His Names as a specimen of the universe

Similarly, man is a unique, priceless work of the art of God, the All-
Mighty, and the most delicate and graceful miracle of His Power, whom
He created to manifest all His Names and their inscriptions, in the
form of a miniature specimen of the universe. If, therefore, man is
illuminated with the life of belief, then all these meaningful
inscriptions become visible. A believer manifests them through his
connection with his Maker, that is, the divine art contained in him is
revealed through such affirmations as "I am the work of the Majestic
Maker, His creature and the object of His Mercy and Munificence."
Thus, belief makes manifest all the traces of art in man, who gains
value in proportion to his reflection of this art and, though an
insignificant being (in material terms), he thereby acquires a rank
above all other creatures. He becomes one who communicates with God
and His guest on the earth, and one qualified for Paradise.

Unbelief reduces man to being like coal although he is like diamond

If, however, unbelief, which consists in the severance of this
connection, becomes in-grained in man, then all those meaningful
manifestations of Divine Names will be veiled by a darkness and no
longer expressive. For, when an artist is not identified, the aspects
that express the worth of his art cannot be identified either. Most of
the meaningful instances of that sublime art and the elevated
inscriptions are thus concealed. As regards the material aspects of
his being, man in unbelief attributes them to trivial causes, to
nature and chance, and thus reduces them to being like plain glass
although they are, in essence, like sparkling diamonds. He is no more
significant than any other material entity, self-condemned to lead a
transient, suffocating life, as no better than a most impotent, needy
and afflicted animal. In the end, he decomposes into dust. Un-belief
thus spoils the nature of man and changes his diamond into coal.

Belief is a light which illuminates man and reveals all the messages
inscribed in his being by the Maker

Just as belief is a light which illuminates man and reveals all the
messages inscribed in his being by the Eternally-Besought-of-All (al-
Samad), so too it illuminates the universe and re-moves the darkness
from the past and future. We will explain this truth by way of an
imaginary event that I experienced regarding the meaning of the noble
Qur'anic verse,

God is the Protecting Friend of those who believe. He brings them out
of the layers of darkness into the light. (2:257)

An imagined vision
In an imagined vision, I was standing on an awe-inspiring bridge set
over a deep valley between two mountains. The whole world was
completely covered by a thick darkness. As I happened to look to my
right, I had the vision of a huge tomb. When I looked to my left, I
felt as if I were seeing violent storms and calamities being prepared
amid the tremendous waves of dark-ness.

Then, I looked down over the edge of the bridge and I imagined I was
seeing a very deep precipice.

In that dreadful darkness, I had recourse to my torch. Through its dim
light a very dreadful scene was shown to me. All along the length of
the bridge, such horrible dragons, lions and monsters appeared that I
wished I had not had that torch. Whichever way I directed it, I got
the same fright. "This torch brings me only trouble," I exclaimed, and
I angrily cast it to the ground and broke it. Then, all of a sudden,
the darkness disappeared and everywhere was illuminated; it was as if
I had switched on a huge light by breaking my torch, and I saw
everything in its true nature.

I discovered that the bridge was, in reality, a highway on a smooth
plain. The huge tomb on the right was a green, beautiful garden in
which the assemblies of worship, prayer, glorification and discourse
were being held under the leadership of illustrious persons. The
scenes on the left which I had previously imagined to be turbulent,
stormy, frightening precipices, now appeared as a banqueting hall, a
shaded promenade, a very beautiful resting place behind lovely
mountains. I realized that what I had imagined to be horrible monsters
and dragons were, in fact, once domesticated animals such as camels,
sheep and goats. "Praise and thanks be to God for the light of
belief," I said, and then awoke reciting the verse,

God is the Protecting Friend of those who believe. He brings them out
of the layers of darkness into the light. (2:257)

Those two mountains that I saw in my imagined vision are, in reality,
the beginning and the end of this life and the life between death and
the Resurrection. The bridge is the life-span, between the two phases
of the past (on the right) and the future (on the left). The torch is
man's conceited ego that, relying on its own achievements, does not
heed the Divine Revelation. What had looked to me first to be monsters
are the events of the world and the extraordinary creatures in it.

Self-confident ego in the darkness of misguidance
Thus, the person who has fallen into the darkness of misguidance and
heedlessness because of his confidence in his own ego resembles me in
the former state-in the dim light of a torch. With his inadequate and
misguided knowledge, he sees the past as a huge tomb in the darkness
of extinction; he sees the future as a stormy scene of terror
controlled by coincidence or chance. The torch shows him events and
creatures which are, in reality, subjugated to the All-Wise and the
All-Merciful and, in submission to His Decree, fulfill specific
functions and serve good purposes, as harmful monsters. Thus he is the
one referred to in the verse:

As to those who do not believe, their protecting friends are false
deities. They bring them out of light into layers of darkness.
(2:257)

If, however, such a man is favored with divine guidance and so belief
enters into his heart, and his Pharaoh-like ego is broken, if he
listens to the Book of God, then he will resemble me in my later
state. All of a sudden the whole of the universe will be filled with
Divine Light, demonstrating the meaning of the verse,

God is the Light of the heavens and the earth.

He then sees through the eye of his heart that the past is not a huge
tomb, rather each past century is the realm of authority of a prophet
or a saint. The purified souls, having completed the duties of their
lives, (that is, the duties of worship), with the words, God is the
Greatest! on their tongues, flew to higher abodes on the side of the
future. He looks to his left. Through the light of belief, he
discerns, behind the mountain-like revolutions of the intermediate
world [the world between this one and the next] and the next life, a
feasting place set up by the All-Compassionate One at the palaces of
bliss in the gardens of Paradise. He has the conviction that the
storms, earthquakes, epidemic diseases, and the like serve for a
specific function, just as he understands spring rain and winds, for
example, in spite of their apparent violence, as serving many
agreeable purposes. Even death, in his view, is seen as the beginning
of eternal life, and the grave as the gateway to eternal happiness.

Belief is both light and power. Whoever attains true belief can
challenge the whole universe and, in proportion to the strength of his
belief, be relieved of the pressures of events.

Belief is both light and power. Indeed, whoever attains true belief
can challenge the whole universe and, in proportion to the strength of
his belief, be relieved of the pressures of events. Re-lying on God,
he travels through the mountainous waves of events in the ship of life
in complete safety. He voyages through the world comfortably until his
last day, since he has been relieved of his burden by entrusting it to
the Power of the Absolutely Powerful One. The grave will be a resting
place for him, after which he flies to Paradise to attain eternal
bliss. By contrast, if he does not rely upon God, not to speak of
flying, the weight of the worldly life will force him down to the
lowest of the low. Belief, therefore, consists of the affirmation of
Divine Unity, which requires submission to God, and submission
requires reliance upon

Excellent, a Muslim proselytizer. It makes a change from all these
Christians trying to save my eternal soul.

I have question for you: Why is male on male rape amongst Muslim men so
common?

My "belief" has nothing to do with the value of a piece of art.  It's
value is based on the piece's desirability in the market place.  If it
costs you $10 to make a sulpture, and I am the only person who likes
it, and you are starving....I bet I can buy it from you for $5.

Belief DOES have something to do with the transaction, though.  I
believe you will starve to death if you don't sell it to me.  =)

Rape is a grave sin and a major legal crime on the part of the
assailant, and if legally proven it may be punishable by death. The
assaulted woman, however, would not be considered a sinner, since she
was overwhelmed and could not be blamed for it. The Quranic rule
applies: "If one is forced, without wilful disobedience nor
transgressing due limits, then he is guiltless, For God is Oft-
Forgiving Most-Merciful'. (2:173)

In gynaecological practice the medicolegal implications of alleged
rape are obvious and clinical and laboratory data should be sought
with diligence. To avoid the tragedy of rape being further confounded
by a possible pregnancy, a contraceptive hormone dose is usually given
and if not too late it will prevent an undesired pregnancy that could
not be disposed of once materialised. The incidence of the crime of
rape in a society cannot be isolated from the general moral climate.
It usually goes with license, drugs and alcohol, the impact of the
media, pruritic television and cinema and even seductive women's
fashion.

thx 4 ur answers,
does this satisfy them?

Question:Who will go to Hell and who will enter Paradise

Answer:The Prophet said one statement and I said another. The Prophet
said "Whoever dies while still invoking anything other than Allah as a
rival to Allah, will enter Hell (Fire)." And I said, "Whoever dies
without invoking anything as a rival to Allah, will enter Paradise." -
Sahih Bukhari Volume 6, Book 60, Number 24.

Question: For whom is Hell Forbidden

Answer: The Prophet (saws) said, "If anybody comes on the Day of
Resurrection who has said: La ilaha illal-lah, sincerely, with the
intention to win Allah's Pleasure, Allah will make the Hell-Fire
forbidden for him." - Sahih Bukhari Volume 8, Book 76, Number 431

Here we should note that when a person is sincere, he follows what
Allah has revealed, and he is always on the right path. Obviously when
a person is on right path, he would be rewarded with Paradise.

Question: Isnt it that Muslims who do not obey Allah will remain in
Hell for some days then they will Enter Paradise?

Answer: No it is not so. This is clear from this hadith: The Prophet;
said, "The people of Paradise will enter Paradise, and the people of
the (Hell) Fire will enter the (Hell) Fire: then a call-maker will get
up (and make an announcement) among them, 'O the people of the (Hell)
Fire! No death anymore ! And O people of Paradise! No death (anymore)
but Eternity." - Sahih Bukhari Volume 8, Book 76, Number 552.

No where are there any other hadiths or any verse in Quran, which say
that Muslims will surely enter Jannah (paradise).

I didn't ask "Who will go to Hell and who will enter Paradise".  Nor
did I ask, "For whom is Hell Forbidden"

I asked:  "If Allah is Omnipresent, how can "Hell" exist?"

Please answer my question.  I really don't care what the Bible or the
Koran says.  I want to know how you would answer this question.

&gt; thx 4 ur answers,
&gt; does this satisfy them?

&gt; Question:Who will go to Hell and who will enter Paradise

&gt; Answer:The Prophet said one statement and I said another. The Prophet
&gt; said &quot;Whoever dies while still invoking anything other than Allah as a
&gt; rival to Allah, will enter Hell (Fire).&quot; And I said, &quot;Whoever dies
&gt; without invoking anything as a rival to Allah, will enter Paradise.&quot; -
&gt; Sahih Bukhari Volume 6, Book 60, Number 24.

&gt; Question: For whom is Hell Forbidden

&gt; Answer: The Prophet (saws) said, &quot;If anybody comes on the Day of
&gt; Resurrection who has said: La ilaha illal-lah, sincerely, with the
&gt; intention to win Allah's Pleasure, Allah will make the Hell-Fire
&gt; forbidden for him.&quot; - Sahih Bukhari Volume 8, Book 76, Number 431

&gt; Here we should note that when a person is sincere, he follows what
&gt; Allah has revealed, and he is always on the right path. Obviously when
&gt; a person is on right path, he would be rewarded with Paradise.

&gt; Question: Isnt it that Muslims who do not obey Allah will remain in
&gt; Hell for some days then they will Enter Paradise?

&gt; Answer: No it is not so. This is clear from this hadith: The Prophet;
&gt; said, &quot;The people of Paradise will enter Paradise, and the people of
&gt; the (Hell) Fire will enter the (Hell) Fire: then a call-maker will get
&gt; up (and make an announcement) among them, 'O the people of the (Hell)
&gt; Fire! No death anymore ! And O people of Paradise! No death (anymore)
&gt; but Eternity.&quot; - Sahih Bukhari Volume 8, Book 76, Number 552.

&gt; No where are there any other hadiths or any verse in Quran, which say
&gt; that Muslims will surely enter Jannah (paradise).

&gt; &gt; (Pottsie)

&gt; &gt; If Allah is Omnipresent, how can &quot;Hell&quot; exist?

&gt; &gt; (mhmdri)
&gt; &gt; For belief is a relation which connects man

&gt; &gt; &gt; to his Majestic Maker. Man's value derives from his demonstration of
&gt; &gt; &gt; divine art and the manifestation of Divine Names through his belief.

&gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; So you are saying that I get my &quot;value&quot; from &quot;demonstration of divine
&gt; &gt; art&quot;...
&gt; &gt; Care to tell me what the heck THAT means?  And while you are at it, if
&gt; &gt; you would care to tell me what &quot;manifestation of Divine Names&quot;
&gt; &gt; means.....that also might be helpful.

&gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Unbelief breaks off this relation; in consequence of it, the divine
&gt; &gt; &gt; art is veiled and the value of man is reduced to the worth of his mere
&gt; &gt; &gt; physical entity. The physical entity of man is of almost no value for
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is perishable and consists of a transient animal. We will explain
&gt; &gt; &gt; this truth by way of a parable:

&gt; &gt; &gt; In a work of art, the value of the material of which it is made,
&gt; &gt; &gt; differs from the value of the art that is expressed in it. Sometimes
&gt; &gt; &gt; the two may be of the same value, and sometimes it happens that five
&gt; &gt; &gt; dollars' worth of art is to be found in material like iron worth five
&gt; &gt; &gt; cents. Sometimes, even, an antique work of art will fetch as much as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; million dollars while its material is not even worth a few cents. If
&gt; &gt; &gt; this antique is taken to the antiques market, it may be sold for its
&gt; &gt; &gt; true value because of the art it contains and the name of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; brilliant artist who fashioned it. Whereas, this work of art may only
&gt; &gt; &gt; be sold for the price of its iron in the blacksmith's market.

&gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; My &quot;belief&quot; has nothing to do with the value of a piece of art.  It's
&gt; &gt; value is based on the piece's desirability in the market place.  If it
&gt; &gt; costs you $10 to make a sulpture, and I am the only person who likes
&gt; &gt; it, and you are starving....I bet I can buy it from you for $5.

&gt; &gt; Belief DOES have something to do with the transaction, though.  I
&gt; &gt; believe you will starve to death if you don't sell it to me.  =)

&gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Man is a unique, priceless work of the art of God whom He created to
&gt; &gt; &gt; manifest all His Names as a specimen of the universe

&gt; &gt; (Pottsie)

&gt; &gt; This sentence makes no sense in English.  I will assume you mean that
&gt; &gt; man was created to mirror God's nature.  If that is what you mean,
&gt; &gt; then I agree.

&gt; &gt; (mhdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, man is a unique, priceless work of the art of God, the All-
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mighty, and the most delicate and graceful miracle of His Power, whom
&gt; &gt; &gt; He created to manifest all His Names and their inscriptions, in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; form of a miniature specimen of the universe.

&gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; Ah, now you are adding &quot;and their inscriptions, in the form of a
&gt; &gt; miniature specimen of the Universe.

&gt; &gt; I assume you are meaning that &quot;Man is created in the image of God&quot;
&gt; &gt; ie  We are also creators.  I would agree again.....if that is what you
&gt; &gt; mean.

&gt; &gt; (mhmdri)
&gt; &gt; If, therefore, man is

&gt; &gt; &gt; illuminated with the life of belief, then all these meaningful
&gt; &gt; &gt; inscriptions become visible. A believer manifests them through his
&gt; &gt; &gt; connection with his Maker, that is, the divine art contained in him is
&gt; &gt; &gt; revealed through such affirmations as &quot;I am the work of the Majestic
&gt; &gt; &gt; Maker, His creature and the object of His Mercy and Munificence.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, belief makes manifest all the traces of art in man, who gains
&gt; &gt; &gt; value in proportion to his reflection of this art and, though an
&gt; &gt; &gt; insignificant being (in material terms), he thereby acquires a rank
&gt; &gt; &gt; above all other creatures. He becomes one who communicates with God
&gt; &gt; &gt; and His guest on the earth, and one qualified for Paradise.

&gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; So in other words, if a man recognizes his oneness with the creator,
&gt; &gt; he can say to this mountain, begone, and it will move.

&gt; &gt; How is this different from what Jesus said?

&gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Unbelief reduces man to being like coal although he is like diamond

&gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; But it is not &quot;belief&quot; that God exists......it is belief that Man is
&gt; &gt; essentially one with God.
&gt; &gt; or &quot;I can do all things in Christ who strengtheneth me&quot;.

&gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; If, however, unbelief, which consists in the severance of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; connection, becomes in-grained in man, then all those meaningful
&gt; &gt; &gt; manifestations of Divine Names will be veiled by a darkness and no
&gt; &gt; &gt; longer expressive. For, when an artist is not identified, the aspects
&gt; &gt; &gt; that express the worth of his art cannot be identified either. Most of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the meaningful instances of that sublime art and the elevated
&gt; &gt; &gt; inscriptions are thus concealed.

&gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; In other word, I can't if I think I can't.  Pretty straight forward,
&gt; &gt; huh?

&gt; &gt; (mhmdri)
&gt; &gt; As regards the material aspects of

&gt; &gt; &gt; his being, man in unbelief attributes them to trivial causes, to
&gt; &gt; &gt; nature and chance, and thus reduces them to being like plain glass
&gt; &gt; &gt; although they are, in essence, like sparkling diamonds. He is no more
&gt; &gt; &gt; significant than any other material entity, self-condemned to lead a
&gt; &gt; &gt; transient, suffocating life, as no better than a most impotent, needy
&gt; &gt; &gt; and afflicted animal. In the end, he decomposes into dust. Un-belief
&gt; &gt; &gt; thus spoils the nature of man and changes his diamond into coal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Belief is a light which illuminates man and reveals all the messages
&gt; &gt; &gt; inscribed in his being by the Maker

&gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; I agree if you mean that &quot;belief in the oneness of man with God&quot; is
&gt; &gt; power.

&gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as belief is a light which illuminates man and reveals all the
&gt; &gt; &gt; messages inscribed in his being by the Eternally-Besought-of-All (al-
&gt; &gt; &gt; Samad), so too it illuminates the universe and re-moves the darkness
&gt; &gt; &gt; from the past and future. We will explain this truth by way of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; imaginary event that I experienced regarding the meaning of the noble
&gt; &gt; &gt; Qur'anic verse,

&gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; Not to be rude, but don't you think that your attempting to teach us,
&gt; &gt; particularly since you use Middle Eastern style of writing which is

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In a work of art, the value of the material of which it is made,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differs from the value of the art that is expressed in it. Sometimes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the two may be of the same value, and sometimes it happens that five
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dollars' worth of art is to be found in material like iron worth five
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cents. Sometimes, even, an antique work of art will fetch as much as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; million dollars while its material is not even worth a few cents. If
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this antique is taken to the antiques market, it may be sold for its
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; true value because of the art it contains and the name of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brilliant artist who fashioned it. Whereas, this work of art may only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be sold for the price of its iron in the blacksmith's market.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; My &quot;belief&quot; has nothing to do with the value of a piece of art. It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; value is based on the piece's desirability in the market place. If it
&gt; &gt; &gt; costs you $10 to make a sulpture, and I am the only person who likes
&gt; &gt; &gt; it, and you are starving....I bet I can buy it from you for $5.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Belief DOES have something to do with the transaction, though. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe you will starve to death if you don't sell it to me. =)

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Man is a unique, priceless work of the art of God whom He created to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manifest all His Names as a specimen of the universe

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)

&gt; &gt; &gt; This sentence makes no sense in English. I will assume you mean that
&gt; &gt; &gt; man was created to mirror God's nature. If that is what you mean,
&gt; &gt; &gt; then I agree.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, man is a unique, priceless work of the art of God, the All-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mighty, and the most delicate and graceful miracle of His Power, whom
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He created to manifest all His Names and their inscriptions, in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; form of a miniature specimen of the universe.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ah, now you are adding &quot;and their inscriptions, in the form of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; miniature specimen of the Universe.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I assume you are meaning that &quot;Man is created in the image of God&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ie We are also creators. I would agree again.....if that is what you
&gt; &gt; &gt; mean.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)
&gt; &gt; &gt; If, therefore, man is

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illuminated with the life of belief, then all these meaningful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inscriptions become visible. A believer manifests them through his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connection with his Maker, that is, the divine art contained in him is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revealed through such affirmations as &quot;I am the work of the Majestic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maker, His creature and the object of His Mercy and Munificence.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, belief makes manifest all the traces of art in man, who gains
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; value in proportion to his reflection of this art and, though an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; insignificant being (in material terms), he thereby acquires a rank
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; above all other creatures. He becomes one who communicates with God
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and His guest on the earth, and one qualified for Paradise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; So in other words, if a man recognizes his oneness with the creator,
&gt; &gt; &gt; he can say to this mountain, begone, and it will move.

&gt; &gt; &gt; How is this different from what Jesus said?

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unbelief reduces man to being like coal although he is like diamond

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; But it is not &quot;belief&quot; that God exists......it is belief that Man is
&gt; &gt; &gt; essentially one with God.
&gt; &gt; &gt; or &quot;I can do all things in Christ who strengtheneth me&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If, however, unbelief, which consists in the severance of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connection, becomes in-grained in man, then all those meaningful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manifestations of Divine Names will be veiled by a darkness and no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; longer expressive. For, when an artist is not identified, the aspects
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that express the worth of his art cannot be identified either. Most of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the meaningful instances of that sublime art and the elevated
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inscriptions are thus concealed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; In other word, I can't if I think I can't. Pretty straight forward,
&gt; &gt; &gt; huh?

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)
&gt; &gt; &gt; As regards the material aspects of

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his being, man in unbelief attributes them to trivial causes, to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nature and chance, and thus reduces them to being like plain glass
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; although they are, in essence, like sparkling diamonds. He is no more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; significant than any other material entity, self-condemned to lead a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transient, suffocating life, as no better than a most impotent, needy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and afflicted animal. In the end, he decomposes into dust. Un-belief
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thus spoils the nature of man and changes his diamond into coal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Belief is a light which illuminates man and reveals all the messages
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inscribed in his being by the Maker

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree if you mean that &quot;belief in the oneness of man with God&quot; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; power.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as belief is a light which illuminates man and reveals all the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messages inscribed in his being by the Eternally-Besought-of-All (al-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Samad), so too it illuminates the universe and re-moves the darkness
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the past and future. We will explain this truth by way of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; imaginary event that I experienced regarding the meaning of the noble
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Qur'anic verse,

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not to be rude, but don't you think that your attempting to teach us,
&gt; &gt; &gt; particularly since you use Middle Eastern style of writing which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; foreign to most of us on this board, is a bit much?

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is really nothing wrong with what you are saying, if I
&gt; &gt; &gt; understand you correctly, but it is said in Christianity, Buddhism,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and Hinduism also.....and it is said in a much clearer style.

&gt; &gt; If Allah is Omnipresent, how can &quot;Hell&quot; exist?

&gt; &gt; (mhmdri)
&gt; &gt; For belief is a relation which connects man

&gt; &gt; &gt; thx 4 ur answers,
&gt; &gt; &gt; does this satisfy them?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Question:Who will go to Hell and who will enter
&gt; Paradise

&gt; &gt; &gt; Answer:The Prophet said one statement and I said
&gt; another. The Prophet
&gt; &gt; &gt; said &quot;Whoever dies while still invoking anything
&gt; other than Allah as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; rival to Allah, will enter Hell (Fire).&quot; And I
&gt; said, &quot;Whoever dies
&gt; &gt; &gt; without invoking anything as a rival to Allah,
&gt; will enter Paradise.&quot; -
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sahih Bukhari Volume 6, Book 60, Number 24.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Question: For whom is Hell Forbidden

&gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: The Prophet (saws) said, &quot;If anybody
&gt; comes on the Day of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Resurrection who has said: La ilaha illal-lah,
&gt; sincerely, with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; intention to win Allah's Pleasure, Allah will
&gt; make the Hell-Fire
&gt; &gt; &gt; forbidden for him.&quot; - Sahih Bukhari Volume 8,
&gt; Book 76, Number 431

&gt; &gt; &gt; Here we should note that when a person is
&gt; sincere, he follows what
&gt; &gt; &gt; Allah has revealed, and he is always on the
&gt; right path. Obviously when
&gt; &gt; &gt; a person is on right path, he would be rewarded
&gt; with Paradise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Question: Isnt it that Muslims who do not obey
&gt; Allah will remain in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hell for some days then they will Enter
&gt; Paradise?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: No it is not so. This is clear from this
&gt; hadith: The Prophet;
&gt; &gt; &gt; said, &quot;The people of Paradise will enter
&gt; Paradise, and the people of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the (Hell) Fire will enter the (Hell) Fire: then
&gt; a call-maker will get
&gt; &gt; &gt; up (and make an announcement) among them, 'O the
&gt; people of the (Hell)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fire! No death anymore ! And O people of
&gt; Paradise! No death (anymore)
&gt; &gt; &gt; but Eternity.&quot; - Sahih Bukhari Volume 8, Book
&gt; 76, Number 552.

&gt; &gt; &gt; No where are there any other hadiths or any
&gt; verse in Quran, which say
&gt; &gt; &gt; that Muslims will surely enter Jannah
&gt; (paradise).

[1] I am afraid of nothing involving some non-existant God.

[2] Yes, I am sure a lot of Muslim men are better looking than me. I'd
probably sleep with a few of them too. What's your point?

This group has certain rules about proselytizing; basically it's not
allowed because it precludes any kind of "debate". We are not a group
of lost souls waiting to be converted. I mentioned the Muslin male on
male rape only to see if the original poster was just spamming or
whether he would reply. He replied, hence I didn't ban him for hit 'n
run preaching. Which we see a fair bit of.

I'd love for us to have a Muslim to add their perspective to our
debates, but quoting scripture, as he has been doing, is not what
we're about. This is a great time for people of Islamic faith to
demonstrate a willingness to integrate and co-operate with people of
other faiths and non-faiths.

Let's hope that happens.

&gt; &gt; thx 4 ur answers,
&gt; &gt; does this satisfy them?

&gt; &gt; Question:Who will go to Hell and who will enter Paradise

&gt; &gt; Answer:The Prophet said one statement and I said another. The Prophet
&gt; &gt; said &quot;Whoever dies while still invoking anything other than Allah as a
&gt; &gt; rival to Allah, will enter Hell (Fire).&quot; And I said, &quot;Whoever dies
&gt; &gt; without invoking anything as a rival to Allah, will enter Paradise.&quot; -
&gt; &gt; Sahih Bukhari Volume 6, Book 60, Number 24.

&gt; &gt; Question: For whom is Hell Forbidden

&gt; &gt; Answer: The Prophet (saws) said, &quot;If anybody comes on the Day of
&gt; &gt; Resurrection who has said: La ilaha illal-lah, sincerely, with the
&gt; &gt; intention to win Allah's Pleasure, Allah will make the Hell-Fire
&gt; &gt; forbidden for him.&quot; - Sahih Bukhari Volume 8, Book 76, Number 431

&gt; &gt; Here we should note that when a person is sincere, he follows what
&gt; &gt; Allah has revealed, and he is always on the right path. Obviously when
&gt; &gt; a person is on right path, he would be rewarded with Paradise.

&gt; &gt; Question: Isnt it that Muslims who do not obey Allah will remain in
&gt; &gt; Hell for some days then they will Enter Paradise?

&gt; &gt; Answer: No it is not so. This is clear from this hadith: The Prophet;
&gt; &gt; said, &quot;The people of Paradise will enter Paradise, and the people of
&gt; &gt; the (Hell) Fire will enter the (Hell) Fire: then a call-maker will get
&gt; &gt; up (and make an announcement) among them, 'O the people of the (Hell)
&gt; &gt; Fire! No death anymore ! And O people of Paradise! No death (anymore)
&gt; &gt; but Eternity.&quot; - Sahih Bukhari Volume 8, Book 76, Number 552.

&gt; &gt; No where are there any other hadiths or any verse in Quran, which say
&gt; &gt; that Muslims will surely enter Jannah (paradise).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surely We created man of the best pattern; then We reduced him to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lowest of the low, save those who believe and do good deeds. (95:4-6)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Belief is a relation which connects man to his Maker
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Man, through the light of belief, attains to the highest degree of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfection and acquires a value worthy of Paradise. With the darkness
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of unbelief, he is reduced to the lowest of the low and falls to a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; position to deserve Hell.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)

&gt; &gt; &gt; If Allah is Omnipresent, how can &quot;Hell&quot; exist?

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)
&gt; &gt; &gt; For belief is a relation which connects man

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to his Majestic Maker. Man's value derives from his demonstration of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; divine art and the manifestation of Divine Names through his belief.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; So you are saying that I get my &quot;value&quot; from &quot;demonstration of divine
&gt; &gt; &gt; art&quot;...
&gt; &gt; &gt; Care to tell me what the heck THAT means? ?And while you are at it, if
&gt; &gt; &gt; you would care to tell me what &quot;manifestation of Divine Names&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; means.....that also might be helpful.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unbelief breaks off this relation; in consequence of it, the divine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; art is veiled and the value of man is reduced to the worth of his mere
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical entity. The physical entity of man is of almost no value for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is perishable and consists of a transient animal. We will explain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this truth by way of a parable:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In a work of art, the value of the material of which it is made,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differs from the value of the art that is expressed in it. Sometimes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the two may be of the same value, and sometimes it happens that five
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dollars' worth of art is to be found in material like iron worth five
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cents. Sometimes, even, an antique work of art will fetch as much as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; million dollars while its material is not even worth a few cents. If
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this antique is taken to the antiques market, it may be sold for its
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; true value because of the art it contains and the name of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brilliant artist who fashioned it. Whereas, this work of art may only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be sold for the price of its iron in the blacksmith's market.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; My &quot;belief&quot; has nothing to do with the value of a piece of art. ?It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; value is based on the piece's desirability in the market place. ?If it
&gt; &gt; &gt; costs you $10 to make a sulpture, and I am the only person who likes
&gt; &gt; &gt; it, and you are starving....I bet I can buy it from you for $5.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Belief DOES have something to do with the transaction, though. ?I
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe you will starve to death if you don't sell it to me. ?=)

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Man is a unique, priceless work of the art of God whom He created to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manifest all His Names as a specimen of the universe

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)

&gt; &gt; &gt; This sentence makes no sense in English. ?I will assume you mean that
&gt; &gt; &gt; man was created to mirror God's nature. ?If that is what you mean,
&gt; &gt; &gt; then I agree.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, man is a unique, priceless work of the art of God, the All-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mighty, and the most delicate and graceful miracle of His Power, whom
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He created to manifest all His Names and their inscriptions, in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; form of a miniature specimen of the universe.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ah, now you are adding &quot;and their inscriptions, in the form of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; miniature specimen of the Universe.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I assume you are meaning that &quot;Man is created in the image of God&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ie ?We are also creators. ?I would agree again.....if that is what you
&gt; &gt; &gt; mean.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)
&gt; &gt; &gt; If, therefore, man is

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illuminated with the life of belief, then all these meaningful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inscriptions become visible. A believer manifests them through his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connection with his Maker, that is, the divine art contained in him is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revealed through such affirmations as &quot;I am the work of the Majestic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maker, His creature and the object of His Mercy and Munificence.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, belief makes manifest all the traces of art in man, who gains
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; value in proportion to his reflection of this art and, though an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; insignificant being (in material terms), he thereby acquires a rank
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; above all other creatures. He becomes one who communicates with God
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and His guest on the earth, and one qualified for Paradise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; So in other words, if a man recognizes his oneness with the creator,
&gt; &gt; &gt; he can say to this mountain, begone, and it will move.

&gt; &gt; &gt; How is this different from what Jesus said?

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unbelief reduces man to being like coal although he is like diamond

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; But it is not &quot;belief&quot; that God exists......it is belief that Man is
&gt; &gt; &gt; essentially one with God.
&gt; &gt; &gt; or &quot;I can do all things in Christ who strengtheneth me&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If, however, unbelief, which consists in the severance of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connection, becomes in-grained in man, then all those meaningful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manifestations of Divine Names will be veiled by a darkness and no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; longer expressive. For, when an artist is not identified, the aspects
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that express the worth of his art cannot be identified either. Most of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the meaningful instances of that sublime art and the elevated
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inscriptions are thus concealed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; In other word, I can't if I think I can't. ?Pretty straight forward,
&gt; &gt; &gt; huh?

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)
&gt; &gt; &gt; As regards the material aspects of

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his being, man in unbelief attributes them to trivial causes, to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nature and chance, and thus reduces them to being like plain glass
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; although they are, in essence, like sparkling diamonds. He is no more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; significant than any other material entity, self-condemned to lead a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transient, suffocating life, as no better than a most impotent, needy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and afflicted animal. In the end, he decomposes into dust. Un-belief
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thus spoils the nature of man and changes his diamond into coal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Belief is a light which illuminates man and reveals all the messages
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inscribed in his being by the Maker

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree if you mean that &quot;belief in the oneness of man with God&quot; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; power.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as belief is a light which illuminates man and reveals all the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messages inscribed in his being by the Eternally-Besought-of-All (al-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Samad), so too it illuminates the universe and re-moves the darkness
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the past and future. We will explain this truth by way of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; imaginary event that I experienced regarding the meaning of the noble
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Qur'anic verse,

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not to be rude, but don't you think that your attempting to teach us,
&gt; &gt; &gt; particularly since you use Middle Eastern style of writing which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; foreign to most of us on this board, is a bit much?

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is really nothing wrong with what you are saying, if I
&gt; &gt; &gt; understand you correctly, but it is said in Christianity, Buddhism,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and Hinduism also.....and it is said in a much clearer style.

Sex is the ultimate expression of love and is a total physical and
emotional encounter. In a brief but beautiful expression the Quran
refers, to this relation between husbands and wives saying:

"They are your garments and you are their garments." (2:187)

The sexual unison between husband and wife is more than seeking a
relief from the urge of desire. Indeed the prophet taught that it is
one of the charities in Islam. He said to his companions, enumerating
examples of charitable deeds :

"And when the one of you makes love (has sex) it is a rewardable
charity. "

His companions were surprised and asked him' 'How come the one of us
answers the urge of his desire and out of this gets the reward of a
charity. To which the prophet answered:

Don't you see that if he does the same but in a forbidden situation it
would be counted against him as a sin? And so if he does it in
legitimacy it is counted for him as a charity." (Muslim)

The sexual relation is a very special relation between consorts, and
should be accorded the privacy it deserves. It is not befitting that
either of them divulges this aspect of their life to anyone. The
prophet peace be upon him emphasizes this ethic in the strongest
terms. He said:

"Amongst the lowest grades of people before God on the day of
judgement, is the man going to his wife (and making sex) and she going
to him: then either of them divulging their common secret."  (Abu
Said)

Addressing a gathering of men and women the prophet looked to the men
and said: "Would it be that the one of you locks his door and draws
his curtains and seeks his need (sex) from his consort: and later when
he goes out he talks to his friends about it?"   He then turned to the
women and said' 'Would it be that the one of you locks her door and
draws her curtains and seeks her need from her consort: and later when
she goes out she talks to her women friends about it? There was an air
of admitting silence and a woman said It happens apostle of God. The
prophet said: 'Never do that Or it would be like a male devil who
encountered a female devil and copulated with her out in the middle of
the road and then left her and went away. (Abu Said)

In order to maintain the bliss and pleasantness of the relation, both
husband and wife should aquire the hygienic and esthetic habits that
keep them attractive to one another. It does not behove the woman only
to beautify herself for her husband, but this is a reciprocal right.
The prophet is reported to have rebuked a man who looked shabby and
neglected to tidy his hair and clothing, stating that it was his
wife's right that he looks at his best to her, as she to him. Ibn
Abbas, a notable scholar of the first Islamic century, stated: Most
certainly I am keen on making myself handsome to my wife, just as I
like her to beautify herself for me in keeping with God's saying in
the Quran that: "Women have rights even as they have obligations in an
equitable way." (2:228)

It is not only a woman's duty, but indeed also her privilege to look
at her best in her husband's sight. Husbands away on a journey should
announce their coming back rather than taking their wives by surprise,
so that the wife has time to beautify herself before meeting her
husband. Whenever the prophet's caravan arrived back at Madina, they
would camp in the suburbs, send a messenger to announce their arrival,
and go to their homes after suitable notice. One of his traditions
says:

"If you are in a journey do not enter your home all of a sudden so
that the tuggy haired would comb and the unprepared get ready". (The
five except Nissa'i)

In modern times sexology has become a science by itself, and modern
western societies almost congratulate themselves for at last
recognizing woman's right to attain sexual satiety out of sexual
intercourse. The 'right to orgasm' is amongst the latest in the
inventory of rights claimed by the "Women's Lib." and other feminist
movements. Fourteen centuries ago, Islam recognized that right, as
evidenced by the saying of the prophet:

"If any of you has sex with his wife let he be true to her. If he
attains his pleasure before her then he shouldn't hurry her away until
she also attains her pleasure." (Anas )  Standard writings in sexology
over the past few decades have described the physiological human
sexual response and classified it into the four phases of excitation,
plateau, orgasm and resolution. Ideally these phases should coincide
in both partners, otherwise there will be sexual dysharmony, often due
to the man getting his orgasm while the woman is still eagerly
awaiting, with inflamed desire, to also achieve her orgasm. As orgasm
is followed by resolution where the male organ gets flacid and the man
enters into a refractory period after his sexual desire has been
satiated through orgasm, the conclusion of the act at that stage would
be unfair to the woman having been aroused but not satisfied, and that
is what the prophet warns against. The man should not just turn his
back and go away or go to sleep, leaving his wife frustrated. The
coital exercise should proceed until she is satisfied. An effective
method of correcting this form of dyshan:nony is to spend time
enjoying their intimacy and helping themselves to one another's bodies
in totality, before moving on to genital intercourse. The pleasures of
sex spread themselves over a much wider area than the genital region,
as manifest in kissing, embracing and caressing the body especially
over the erogenous zones of the female physique. This indeed is the
normal and commendable approach to sex. It adds to the mechanistic
element of sex, the emotional dimension of tender love and mutual
affection beautifully portrayed in the Quran as: "They are your
garments, and they are yours. " It also ensures that by the time the
couple move on to genital introduction, the woman would have been
aroused over a sufficient period of time and become so excited that
she is already quite near her orgasm. In modern medical jargon this
prelude is called the' 'foreplay', but again long before it was dreamt
in the rest of the world of such women's rights, the prophet of Islam
gave the same guidance, politely referring to foreplay as the
"messenger", in his saying:

"Let-not the one of you fall upon his wife like a beast (camel)
falls.  It is more appropriate to set a messenger afore the act"

Amongst good sexual ethics also is that the couple should be sensitive
to each others needs and limitations, and ups and downs. Even a
virtuous excuse like deep involvement in worship is not accepted if
the man forgets or ignores his wife's rights. In such a case it is the
woman's right to protest. History reports the woman who went to Umar
ibn al Khat tab (second caliph) consulting him: My husband fasts by
day and prays all night. and I feel embarassed to complain seeing that
he spends his time worshipping God. The man was summoned for a
hearing. The final verdict was to have three nights for his own
worship and to heed the needs of his wife during the rest of the week.
Umar also asked his daughter Hafsa how long a woman should stand being
away from her husband, Upon which he decreed that fighting troops
should be given leave to come back home every six months.

Similarly a woman should be responsive to her husband's call. Seeing
that men are more prone to sexual arousal by a variety of visual
stimuli as they move about all day, the prophet's advice was that the
wife should always answer her husband's call:

"The right of the husband is that when he calls his wife to sex she
should not deny him herself." (Tialissi)

The prophet also advised that whenever a man sees something that
arouses his sexual desire, he should go and have sex with his wife.

Christian Muslim Responses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Debate on TV

At the end of the debate - "Christianity and Islam" - which appeared
on the SABC-TV program "Cross Questions" on Sunday 5th June 1983, the
Chairman, Mr. Bill Chalmers commented: "I think it can be said from
this discussion that there is, at present, somewhat more accommodation
on the Islamic side for the founder of Christianity than there is on
the Christian side for the founder of Islam. What the significance of
that is, we leave it to you, the viewer, to determine, but I do think
you will agree that it is a good thing that we are talking together."

"Bill" as he is popularly addressed, without any formalities, on all
his programs, by all his panelists, is extremely charming and
stupendous in his humility. He is a picture of what the Holy Quran
portrays of a good Christian:

"...And nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou find
those who say: 'We are Christians': because among these are men
devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world. And they are
not arrogant." (The Holy Quran 5:82)

Jesus - His Status

Were the Muslims on the panel trying to placate the viewers out
policy, deceit or diplomacy? Nothing of the kind! They were only
articulating what God Almighty had commanded them to say in the Holy
Quran. As Muslims, they had no choice. They had said in so many words:
"We Muslims believe, that Jesus was one of the mightiest messengers of
God that he was the Christ, that he was born miraculously without any
male intervention (which many modern-day Christians do not believe
today), that he gave life to the dead by God's permission and that he
healed those born blind and the lepers by god's permission. In fact,
no Muslim is a Muslim if he or she does not believe in Jesus!"

Pleasant Surprise

Over 90% of the people who witnessed this debate must have been
pleasantly, but skeptically, surprised. They might have not believed
their ears. They must have surmised that the Muslims were playing to
the gallery - that they were trying to curry favor with their fellow
Christian countrymen; that if the Muslims would say a few good words
about Jesus, then in reciprocation the Christians might say a few good
words about Muhammed (may the peace and the blessings of God be upon
all His righteous servants, Moses, Jesus, Muhammed...etc.); that I
scratch your back and you scratch my back - which would be a sham or
hypocrisy.

Hate Cultivated

We cannot blame the Christians for their skepticism. They have been so
learned for centuries. They were trained to think the worst of the man
Muhammed, salla Allah u alihi wa sallam, and his religion. How aptly
did Thomas Carlyle say about his Christian brethren over a hundred and
fifty years ago: "The lies which well-meaning zeal has heaped round
this man (Muhammed) are disgraceful to ourselves only." We Muslims are
partly responsible for this. We have not done anything substantial to
remove the cobwebs.

Ocean of Christianity

South Africa is an ocean of Christianity. If Libya boasts the highest
percentage of Muslims on the continent of Africa, then the Republic of
South Africa would also be entitled to boast the highest percentage of
Christians. In this ocean of Christianity the R.S.A. - the Muslims are
barely 2% of the total population. We are a voteless minority -
numerically, we count for nothing; politically, we count for nothing;
and economically, one white man, as Oppenheimer, could buy out the
whole lot of us, lock, stock and barrel.

So if we had feigned to appease, we might be excused. But no! We must
proclaim our Master's Will; we must declare the Truth, whether we
liked it or not. In the words of Jesus: "Seek ye the truth, and the
truth shall set you free" (John 8:32).

Chapter Two : Jesus in the Quran
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Christians Unaware

The Christian does not know that the true spirit of charity which the
Muslim displays, always, towards Jesus and his mother Mary spring from
the fountainhead of his faith - the Holy Quran. He does not know that
the Muslim does not take the holy name of Jesus, in his own language,
without saying Eesa, alaihi assalam ("Jesus, peace be upon him")

The Christian does not know that in the Holy Quran Jesus is mentioned
twenty five times. For example:

"We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear signs and strengthened him with
the Holy Spirit" (The Holy Quran 2:87)

"O Mary! God giveth thee glad tidings of a Word from Him: his name
will be Christ Jesus, the son of Mary..." (3:45)

"...Christ Jesus the son of Mary was (no more than) an apostle of
god..." (4:171)

"...And in their foot steps we sent Jesus the son of Mary..." (5:46)

"And Zakariya and John, and Jesus and Elias: all in the ranks of the
righteous." (6:85)

Jesus - His Titles

Though Jesus is mentioned by name in twenty-five places in the Holy
Quran, he is also addressed with respect as: Ibn Maryam, meaning "The
son of Mary"; and as the Maseeh (in Hebrew it is the Messiah), which
is translated as "Christ". He is also known as Abdullah, "The servant
of Allah"; and as Rasul u Allah, the messenger of Allah.

He is spoken of as "The Word of God", as "The Spirit of God", as a
"Sign of God", and numerous other epithets of honor spread over
fifteen different chapters. The Holy Quran honors this mighty
messenger of God, and the Muslims have not fallen short over the past
fourteen hundred years in doing the same. There is not a single
disparaging remark in the entire Quran to which even the most
jaundiced among the Christians can take exception.

Eesa Latinised to "Jesus"

The Holy Quran refers to Jesus as Eesa, and this name is used more
times than any other title, because this was his "Christian" name.
Actually, his proper name was Eesa (Arabic), or Esau (Hebrew);
classical Yeheshua, which the Christian nations of the West latinised
as Jesus. Neither the "J" nor the second "s" in the name Jesus is to
be found in the original tongue - they are not found in the Semitic
languages.

The word is very simply "E S A U" a very common Jewish name, used more
than sixty times in the very first booklet alone of the Bible, in the
part called "Genesis". There was at least one "Jesus" sitting on the
"bench" at the trial of Jesus before the Sanhedrin. Josephus the
Jewish historian mentions some twenty five Jesus' in his "Book of
Antiquities". The New Testament speaks of "Bar-Jesus" a magician and a
sorcerer, a false prophet (Acts 13:6); and also "Jesus-Justus" a
Christian missionary, a contemporary of Paul (Colossians 4:11). These
are distinct from Jesus the son of Mary. Transforming "Esau" to
(J)esu(s) - Jesus - makes it unique. This unique (?) name has gone out
of currency among the Jews and the Christians from the 2nd century
after Christ. Among the Jews, because it came to be a name of ill -
repute, the name of one who blasphemed in Jewry; and among the
Christians because it came to be the proper name of their God. The
Muslim will not hesitate to name his son Eesa because it is an honored
name, the name of a righteous servant of the Lord.

(Pottsie)

I did not ask "Why" Allah created hell. I asked:  If
Allah is Omnipresent, how can Hell exist?"

I am not attempting to insult you in any way.  But if
you want to "convert" me to your way of thinking, then
you will have to answer my questions.

You talked about who will go to hell and who will go
to Paradise.  That does not make sense to me unless
you can first tell me something about those two
"Places".

I believe that Allah is Omnipresent.  If Allah is
Omnipresent....I don't see how there can be a place
called Hell.....REGARDLESS of what the Koran or the
Bible says....because ANYWHERE that Allah is....is
Paradise.  And since Allah is everywhere present, then
right here and right now is paradise, because Allah is
right here and right now.

If you base the existence of Hell and Paradise on the
Koran or the Bible, then you are going to have to
convince me that The Bible or the Koran are direct
communications from Allah.  If they were given to
Mohammed or Moses directly, then why should give more
credence to what Allah says to Moses or Mohammed than
I do to what He says directly to me?

&gt; &gt; &gt; thx 4 ur answers,
&gt; &gt; &gt; does this satisfy them?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Question:Who will go to Hell and who will enter
&gt; Paradise

&gt; &gt; &gt; Answer:The Prophet said one statement and I said
&gt; another. The Prophet
&gt; &gt; &gt; said &quot;Whoever dies while still invoking anything
&gt; other than Allah as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; rival to Allah, will enter Hell (Fire).&quot; And I
&gt; said, &quot;Whoever dies
&gt; &gt; &gt; without invoking anything as a rival to Allah,
&gt; will enter Paradise.&quot; -
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sahih Bukhari Volume 6, Book 60, Number 24.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Question: For whom is Hell Forbidden

&gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: The Prophet (saws) said, &quot;If anybody
&gt; comes on the Day of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Resurrection who has said: La ilaha illal-lah,
&gt; sincerely, with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; intention to win Allah's Pleasure, Allah will
&gt; make the Hell-Fire
&gt; &gt; &gt; forbidden for him.&quot; - Sahih Bukhari Volume 8,
&gt; Book 76, Number 431

&gt; &gt; &gt; Here we should note that when a person is
&gt; sincere, he follows what
&gt; &gt; &gt; Allah has revealed, and he is always on the
&gt; right path. Obviously when
&gt; &gt; &gt; a person is on right path, he would be rewarded
&gt; with Paradise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Question: Isnt it that Muslims who do not obey
&gt; Allah will remain in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hell for some days then they will Enter
&gt; Paradise?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: No it is not so. This is clear from this
&gt; hadith: The Prophet;
&gt; &gt; &gt; said, &quot;The people of Paradise will enter
&gt; Paradise, and the people of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the (Hell) Fire will enter the (Hell) Fire: then
&gt; a call-maker will get
&gt; &gt; &gt; up (and make an announcement) among them, 'O the
&gt; people of the (Hell)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fire! No death anymore ! And O people of
&gt; Paradise! No death (anymore)
&gt; &gt; &gt; but Eternity.&quot; - Sahih Bukhari Volume 8, Book
&gt; 76, Number 552.

&gt; &gt; &gt; No where are there any other hadiths or any
&gt; verse in Quran, which say
&gt; &gt; &gt; that Muslims will surely enter Jannah
&gt; (paradise).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For belief is a relation which connects man

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to his Majestic Maker. Man's value derives
&gt; from his demonstration of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; divine art and the manifestation of Divine
&gt; Names through his belief.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So you are saying that I get my &quot;value&quot; from

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; means.....that also might be helpful.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unbelief breaks off this relation; in
&gt; consequence of it, the divine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; art is veiled and the value of man is
&gt; reduced to the worth of his mere
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical entity. The physical entity of man
&gt; is of almost no value for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is perishable and consists of a transient
&gt; animal. We will explain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this truth by way of a parable:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In a work of art, the value of the material
&gt; of which it is made,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differs from the value of the art that is
&gt; expressed in it. Sometimes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the two may be of the same value, and
&gt; sometimes it happens that five
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dollars' worth of art is to be found in
&gt; material like iron worth five
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cents. Sometimes, even, an antique work of
&gt; art will fetch as much as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; million dollars while its material is not
&gt; even worth a few cents. If
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this antique is taken to the antiques
&gt; market, it may be sold for its
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; true value because of the art it contains
&gt; and the name of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brilliant artist who fashioned it. Whereas,
&gt; this work of art may only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be sold for the price of its iron in the
&gt; blacksmith's market.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My &quot;belief&quot; has nothing to do with the value
&gt; of a piece of art. ?It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; value is based on the piece's desirability in
&gt; the market place. ?If it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; costs you $10 to make a sulpture, and I am the
&gt; only person who likes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it, and you are starving....I bet I can buy it
&gt; from you for $5.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Belief DOES have something to do with the
&gt; transaction, though. ?I

&gt; &gt; piece of art.  It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; value is based on the piece's desirability in the
&gt; &gt; market place.  If it
&gt; &gt; &gt; costs you $10 to make a sulpture, and I am the
&gt; &gt; only person who likes
&gt; &gt; &gt; it, and you are starving....I bet I can buy it
&gt; &gt; from you for $5.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Belief DOES have something to do with the
&gt; &gt; transaction, though.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe you will starve to death if you don't sell
&gt; &gt; it to me.  =)

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Man is a unique, priceless work of the art of
&gt; &gt; God whom He created to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manifest all His Names as a specimen of the
&gt; &gt; universe

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)

&gt; &gt; &gt; This sentence makes no sense in English.  I will
&gt; &gt; assume you mean that
&gt; &gt; &gt; man was created to mirror God's nature.  If that
&gt; &gt; is what you mean,
&gt; &gt; &gt; then I agree.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, man is a unique, priceless work of
&gt; &gt; the art of God, the All-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mighty, and the most delicate and graceful
&gt; &gt; miracle of His Power, whom
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He created to manifest all His Names and their
&gt; &gt; inscriptions, in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; form of a miniature specimen of the universe.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ah, now you are adding &quot;and their inscriptions, in
&gt; &gt; the form of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; miniature specimen of the Universe.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I assume you are meaning that &quot;Man is created in
&gt; &gt; the image of God&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ie  We are also creators.  I would agree
&gt; &gt; again.....if that is what you
&gt; &gt; &gt; mean.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)
&gt; &gt; &gt; If, therefore, man is

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illuminated with the life of belief, then all
&gt; &gt; these meaningful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inscriptions become visible. A believer
&gt; &gt; manifests them through his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connection with his Maker, that is, the divine
&gt; &gt; art contained in him is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revealed through such affirmations as &quot;I am the
&gt; &gt; work of the Majestic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maker, His creature and the object of His Mercy
&gt; &gt; and Munificence.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, belief makes manifest all the traces of
&gt; &gt; art in man, who gains
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; value in proportion to his reflection of this
&gt; &gt; art and, though an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; insignificant being (in material terms), he
&gt; &gt; thereby acquires a rank
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; above all other creatures. He becomes one who
&gt; &gt; communicates with God
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and His guest on the earth, and one qualified
&gt; &gt; for Paradise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; So in other words, if a man recognizes his oneness
&gt; &gt; with the creator,
&gt; &gt; &gt; he can say to this mountain, begone, and it will
&gt; &gt; move.

&gt; &gt; &gt; How is this different from what Jesus said?

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unbelief reduces man to being like coal although
&gt; &gt; he is like diamond

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; But it is not &quot;belief&quot; that God exists......it is
&gt; &gt; belief that Man is
&gt; &gt; &gt; essentially one with God.
&gt; &gt; &gt; or &quot;I can do all things in Christ who
&gt; &gt; strengtheneth me&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (mhmdri)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If, however, unbelief, which consists in the
&gt; &gt; severance of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connection, becomes in-grained in man, then all
&gt; &gt; those meaningful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manifestations of Divine Names will be veiled by
&gt; &gt; a darkness and no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; longer expressive. For, when an artist is not
&gt; &gt; identified, the aspects
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that express the worth of his art cannot be
&gt; &gt; identified either. Most of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the meaningful instances of that sublime art and
&gt; &gt; the elevated
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inscriptions are thus concealed.

"Well" is a wonderful word, isn't it? However, I prefer it at and in

Interesting questions, I admit. A good poetry seminar will surely help
you to find your answers.

Wow, a very drastic method. But I agree, it would give you a quick and
