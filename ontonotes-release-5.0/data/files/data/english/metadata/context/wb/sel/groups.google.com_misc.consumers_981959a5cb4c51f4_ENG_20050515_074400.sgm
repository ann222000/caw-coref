Low Carbs? Who Cares? Sugar Is Latest Supermarket Demon
By MELANIE WARNER

Last summer, as the low-carbohydrate dieting craze began to fade,
executives at Stonyfield Farms decided they had to make a change to
their Moove Over Carbs yogurt.

What they came up with was simple and painless: In January, they pulled
Moove Over Carbs from the shelves, and this month, Moove Over Sugar
takes its place. Except for the name, the product remains exactly the
same - sugars are, after all, also carbs. Both yogurts contain a sugar
substitute and have at least 40 percent fewer calories than Stonyfield
Farm's regular flavored varieties.

Low-sugar has become the new low-carb. Food makers are rushing to meet
demand from consumers concerned with their waistlines and healthier
eating by providing an array of new products, some of them aimed at
children. But scientists are divided over how positive this development
is, questioning whether the change will help people lose weight, and
how healthful the artificial sweeteners are.

According to a survey done by the Grocery Manufacturers Association, a
food industry trade group, almost 50 percent of all grocery shoppers
said they were looking for products with reduced sugar.

&quot;Carbs was a trend, but the concern about sugar is here to stay,&quot; said
Cathleen Toomey, vice president of communications at Stonyfield Farms,
which is owned by Groupe Danone of France.

Just about every major food company is thinking along these lines.
Among the new products being offered are Pepperidge Farm Sugar Free
Milano cookies, Arnold Smart &amp; Healthy Sugar Free bread and General
Mills 75% Less Sugar Cocoa Puffs.

Propelled in part by the popularity of the sugar substitute sucralose,
or Splenda, the food industry last year introduced 2,225 sugarless or
sugar-reduced products in the United States, according to the research
firm Productscan Online. This figure is more than double that of two
years ago and represents 11 percent of all new products in 2004.

By contrast, in 2004, the height of the low-carb boom, there were 3,375
products introduced, accounting for 19 percent of all new products that
year, according to Productscan. This year, low-carb product
introductions from January through April were down 25 percent from the
same period last year.

Last week, ACNielsen identified both organic and low or no sugar as the
two &quot;good for you&quot; food segments that will get products noticed by
consumers and generate the strongest sales growth. Many of these new
low-sugar products are not just the old standbys like diet sodas and
sugarless gum, but foods and drinks like cereals, fruit juices,
cookies, bread, ice cream, flavored milk, pasta sauce, maple syrup and
even bottled water.

A few of these products, like Kellogg's 1/3 Less Sugar Froot Loops and
Frosted Flakes cereals, and Mott's Healthy Harvest apple sauce, simply
have less added sugar and taste less sweet. But most are made with one
or more of the half-dozen no-calorie artificial sweeteners on the
market and are designed to taste much like the original.

While many nutritionists champion artificial sweeteners as a way to cut
calories and reduce sugar, others say these products are not the answer
to America's weight and health problems. Some critics voice concern
about the increased consumption of what are essentially chemical
sweeteners, especially among children. New low-sugar products, like
breakfast cereal and fruit juice sweetened with Splenda and vanilla
milk with neotame, a new intensely sweet sugar replacement, are
consumed heavily by children.

Dr. Susan Schiffman, a sweetener specialist and professor of medical
psychology at Duke University Medical Center, says she has safety
concerns about sucralose, which is the nation's fastest-growing sugar
replacement, according to the Freedonia Group, a research firm. She
points to the Food and Drug Administration's 1998 report giving
approval for sucralose, which said the compound is &quot;weakly mutagenic in
a mouse lymphoma mutation assay,&quot; meaning it caused minor genetic
damages in mouse cells.

The report also said one of the substances produced when sucralose is
broken down in the body is &quot;weakly mutagenic in the Ames test.&quot; An Ames
test is the standard method used to detect possible carcinogens.

&quot;The sucralose people keep saying 'It's just a little bit of a
mutagen,' &quot; Dr. Schiffman said. &quot;Well, I don't want a little bit of a
mutagen in my food supply. How do you know what happens in a long life
span or to the next generation or to your eggs and sperm? I don't feel
like the issues have been answered.&quot;

McNeil Nutritionals, a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson that sells
Splenda, says that the safety of sucralose has been confirmed in more
than 100 studies done over the last 20 years, and that it has been
approved for use by regulatory agencies around the world. Over the
years, sweeteners like saccharin and aspartame have also prompted
various safety concerns.

Other critics of artificial sweeteners focus their concerns on whether
these foods and beverages actually help people lose weight or improve
their diets. According to a consumer survey done last year by the
Calorie Control Council, a trade group representing the low-calorie and
reduced-fat food and beverage industry, people use sugar-reduced
products primarily to &quot;stay in overall better health&quot; and &quot;reduce
calories.&quot;

Dr. Stuart Fischer, who worked for nine years with the low-carb diet
specialist Dr. Robert Atkins and now runs his own nutrition practice in
Manhattan, contends that artificial sweeteners do nothing for a
person's &quot;overall health&quot; because they perpetuate cravings for sweet
foods.

&quot;They remind dieters about the taste of the forbidden fruit,&quot; Dr.
Fischer said. &quot;Does Alcoholics Anonymous recommend alcohol-free beer?
Of course not.&quot; Dr. Fischer said he counsels patients to cut out all
sweet foods from their diet to eliminate sugar cravings, which he says
can lay the groundwork for Type II diabetes.

Dr. David Katz, a nutrition specialist and professor of public health
at the Yale University School of Medicine, says that in his 15 years of
treating patients he has observed that people who consume a lot of
artificially sweetened foods also end up eating an excess of foods
loaded with regular sugar, negating any savings in calories. &quot;If you're
exposed to sweet foods and drinks often, the threshold for satisfaction
goes up,&quot; Dr. Katz said.

As in many areas of science, research findings on the issue are mixed.
While some studies, such as one done last year at Purdue University,
support the ideas of people like Dr. Katz and Dr. Fischer, other,
longer-term research has shown that people who consume artificially
sweetened, no-calorie beverages do lose more weight than those drinking
regular, full-calorie sodas.

Yet almost all of these studies have looked at zero-calorie diet
drinks, not low-sugar foods like Sugar Free Milano cookies and 50% Less
Sugar Quaker Instant Oatmeal, which still have calories.

Some of these products, in fact, have as many calories as the original,
making things confusing for the consumer. According to information
displayed on box labels, 1/3 Less Sugar Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops,
75% Less Sugar Cocoa Puffs and Trix, and 50% Less Sugar Fruity Pebbles
cereals are not significantly lower in calories than the original
versions. Neither are Sugar Free Milanos or Arnold Smart &amp; Healthy
Sugar Free bread.

Christine M. Homsey, a senior research food scientist at Food
Perspectives, a consulting firm in Plymouth, Minn., explained that
because sugar provides bulk, manufacturers add more flour or other
grains to make up for the loss, putting calories back in.

In March, a woman in San Diego who said she thought the reduced-sugar
cereals she bought for her children were lower in calories sued
Kellogg, General Mills and Kraft Foods, saying that the companies used
misleading marketing to sell the products.

The confusion over calorie counts and whether sugar-free foods will
really help individuals lose weight has not deterred consumers from
buying $1 billion worth of low-sugar products in the last year.
According to ACNielsen LabelTrends, sales of ready-to-eat, less-sugar
cereal jumped 63 percent in the last 52 weeks, and revenue from the
expanding universe of all low-sugar products is up 133 percent from a
year ago.

Eager to meet this growing demand, food companies are working furiously
to devise even better ways of replicating the taste and function of
sugar in food. All current sugar substitutes have aftertastes and other
flaws that distinguish them from sugar, food scientists say. Many food
specialists attribute Splenda's runaway success to its sugar-like
taste, but they say that it, too, falls short.

&quot;The holy grail remains elusive,&quot; said Kantha Shelke, a food scientist
who has worked for food manufacturers like Pillsbury and Interstate
Bakeries. &quot;The perfect sweetener would be something that looks like
sugar and acts like sugar in every way, except when you metabolize it.&quot;

Despite the concerns of some scientists and doctors about artificial
sweeteners, the trend of low-sugar foods and beverages shows no signs
of slowing. While stores like Whole Foods do not stock products that
contain artificial sweeteners, a majority of consumers have welcomed
these food additives into their diets.

Katherine Tallmadge, a registered dietician in Washington, said she did
not encourage her patients to use artificial sweeteners, but some do
anyway. &quot;People are hooked on sweets and they want to eat sweet foods
without the calories,&quot; Ms. Tallmadge said. &quot;It's a classic case of
wanting your cake and eating it too.&quot;

&gt;&gt;food is stuffed chock-full of sugar!

&gt; And now that the Adkins craze is dead, low-sugar doesn't mean it's ok
&gt; to eat lots of carbs...

"/> Actually, the Atkins &quot;craze&quot; isn't dead at all. What's dead are the
crappy products that tried to capitalize on it. They didn't do what they
claimed they did and were rejected wholesale.

People say the low-carb thing is past and gone when the reality is that
there are still many, many people doing it. What's not happening is the
purchase of snacks and other foods being hustled as low in carbohydrates
when they really aren't. Low-carbers didn't fall for the same kind of
hype that low fat dieters bought. It's easier to track results with low
carb.

The fact that those products didn't succeed isn't an indication that the
idea is dead; it's that the products didn't deliver what they promised
and were quickly dropped. Pastas that tasted like old socks and felt
like plastic. Chocolates made with maltitol that were ostensibly low
carb but mostly succeeded in being wonderful laxatives. Cereals peddled
as LC were low*er* than most cereals. But not low. Same with smoothies,
frozen entrees, meal replacement bars, and a million other products. The
real indicator is that the bread and pasta manufacturers are still
reporting much lower sales than a few years ago.

So people who are genuinely concerned with maintaining a lower carb
intake just went back to whole foods. Fish, meats (relatively small
portions), cheeses (full-fat or not), green beans, chicken, broccoli,
tofu, cauliflower, black soy beans, cabbage, etc. These foods (and this
is just the tip of a large culinary iceberg) combined with other
ingredients higher in carbs still can be the elements of a reduced carb
regimen.

Not every dish has to be low in carbs, just every day.

"/> ROFL!!! Too damned true!
It's so very easy to avoid carbs by just educating one's self about food
and learning to cook! One of my fellow low-carb co-workers was
discussing cooking and recipes with me at work the other day. He
commented that this type of eating forced us to really learn to cook and
to become more creative in the kitchen.

Both of us are enjoying food far more now than we EVER did when we went
with the usual starch based common american diet.

Brunch today was a fritatta made with sliced rehydrated shitake
mushrooms, celery and onions with ginger, garlic, dill and lemon pepper
sauteed in the skillet until the onions cleared. To that I added
scrambled duck eggs mixed with shredded jack cheese. I folded that in
until the egg was starting to set up well, topped with shredded
mozarella, put the skillet lid on and turned the heat off. Let it rest
for about 10 minutes until the additional cheese topping melted.

Served it by itself with a small glass of burgundy. ;-d

I checked out the numerous &quot;low carb&quot; items that were supposed to
satisfy our craving for &quot;naughty&quot; foods and, granted, they were lower in
carbs than their normal counterparts but still WAY way too high in carbs
to qualify as truly &quot;low carb&quot;. I try to keep my carbs below 25 grams
per day.

My only cheat is a very good low carb flour tortilla from HEB. They have
8 grams each which is well within limits. I restrict myself to 2 per day
when I am in the mood for tacos or sandwiches.

The people marketing the &quot;low carb&quot; (really still too high carb) items
were clueless as usual. And Atkins low carb candy bars tasted like sh**.
Too easy to make good sweet items myself with Splenda if I have a sweet
attack.

Last night it was lemon butter cream frosting with Splenda. ;-d
I took one fresh lemon and washed it well, zested and juiced it into a
bowl. Added 1 stick of butter and one 8 oz. package of cream cheese.
Nuked it to soften it and beat it until well mixed. Added 6 packets of
splenda, then refrigerated it and split it into 6 servings.

Yum!

And if it tastes like crap, I'm not going to eat it! Mission brand low
carb tortillas are a good example! Not really all that low at 12 grams
each and they taste like cardboard. The HEB brand had only 8 grams each
(4 grams net) and actually taste like the real thing.

I have yet to find a good low carb pasta. I substitute shredded bamboo
shoots if I'm desparate for something to eat with tomato sauce...
Spagetti squash is also great, if and when I can find it! :-(

Cheaper and I can make them taste however I want. Put them in soups.
Cook them into whatever form I want. Refried beans. Chili with beans.
Use them in pureed soups as thickeners (not from starch; just from
texture). Eat them cold with a vinaigrette. Or just plain with a dab of
butter, drop of lemon juice.

Happy beans...

&gt; People say the low-carb thing is past and gone when the reality is that
&gt; there are still many, many people doing it. What's not happening is the
&gt; purchase of snacks and other foods being hustled as low in carbohydrates
&gt; when they really aren't. Low-carbers didn't fall for the same kind of
&gt; hype that low fat dieters bought. It's easier to track results with low
&gt; carb.

&gt; The fact that those products didn't succeed isn't an indication that the
&gt; idea is dead; it's that the products didn't deliver what they promised
&gt; and were quickly dropped. Pastas that tasted like old socks and felt
&gt; like plastic. [snip]

"/> I bought a box of low-carb penne pasta for 40¢ at Big Lot's, and it sat
on the shelf for months. I finally used the stuff to make a casserole
much like King Ranch Chicken, but with noodles instead of tortillas.

The low-carb noodles were made with soy flour and semolina, and were
brown when dry. They lightened when cooked, but were still kind of
gray-brown. They were perfect in this particular casserole because the
taste and texture was reminiscent of corn tortillas. I was lucky. They
would have been very dissapointing in an Italian pasta dish -- the
taste wasn't quite right and the texture was nothing at all like real pasta.

If they still have any next time I'm at Big Lot's, I'll buy another
couple of boxes to use just like I used that first box. I wouldn't pay
full price for them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So people who are genuinely concerned with maintaining a lower carb
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;intake just went back to whole foods. Fish, meats (relatively small
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;portions), cheeses (full-fat or not), green beans, chicken, broccoli,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tofu, cauliflower, black soy beans, cabbage, etc. These foods (and this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is just the tip of a large culinary iceberg) combined with other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ingredients higher in carbs still can be the elements of a reduced carb
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;regimen.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In other words, real food. ;-D

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Black soy beans? That's not one I'm familiar with.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do tell?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I saw cans of black soy beans in a supermarket and read the label.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Seemed too good to be true, so I called the company and asked a lot of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;questions. Eden products. I spoke with a pleasant and knowledgeable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;woman who read me the lab reports about the nutritional analyses they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;had had done. Blew me away. Because of labeling laws, the numbers on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can are all rounded in the directions mandated, up or down. The real
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;numbers are better than the ones on the can. And they're very good for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;low carbing. Comes to 3.5 grams net carb in a 15-ounce can.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Here's a rather full description:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;05

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've taken to buying big bags of dry beans and cooking my own (and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;giving some to other people who might be interested).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cheaper and I can make them taste however I want. Put them in soups.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cook them into whatever form I want. Refried beans. Chili with beans.

As for low-fat vs. low-carb:

It appears to me that most Americans consume excessive amounts of fats,
carbs, and protein! What Americans consume insufficiently is whole grains
(these tend to be rich in carbs), veggies (calories there are low but
mainly in the form of carbs), and fruits (calories mainly in the form of
the carbs considered worst by the anti-carbers - sugars).

Another thing that Americans tend to lack is sufficient exercise! Those
who work out a lot increase their requirement for calories while only to a
lesser extent increase their requirement for anything with nutritional
value other than calories - as in the calorie burners need more carbs and
the unhealthfully sedentary people are the ones that can reduce (but
not eliminate) their damage to themselves by cutting carbs more than other
sources of calories.
Does this explain how I am rubbed the wrong way by a low-carb beer ad
that pictures cyclists and says, &quot;for today's active lifestyle&quot;?

portion values on the label. So when there's lots of fiber in a food, as
in most veggies, that's included in the calorie counts as though we were
digesting and assimilating them.

As for what most Americans eat and don't eat, cite some facts instead of
beliefs.

Given the vast riches in fresh, frozen, canned, dried, pickled, and
home-grown veggies available, it looks like somebody's eating veggies.
Given the myriad choices in soups, stews, braises, entrees, side dishes
and plain adjuncts to meals available in food markets. Somebody's eating
them. Frozen dinners. Pizza toppings. Fast tacos. Fruits to outshine the
rainbow with new ones appearing daily. Somebody's buying them or they
wouldn't be on display.

I won't dispute that Americans consume too many calories and have a
large obese population fraction. How they've gotten that way is a
question a lot more complex than merely to focus on one macronutrient.
We bump into marketing and taste preferences, of course, but we also hit
instinct and what we've evolved to do when confronted with food in great
abundance. No other animal on earth has to moderate its food intake.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Another thing that Americans tend to lack is sufficient exercise! Those
&gt; who work out a lot increase their requirement for calories while only to a
&gt; lesser extent increase their requirement for anything with nutritional
&gt; value other than calories - as in the calorie burners need more carbs and
&gt; the unhealthfully sedentary people are the ones that can reduce (but
&gt; not eliminate) their damage to themselves by cutting carbs more than other
&gt; sources of calories.

for what level of exercise. The blanket statement leaves a lot of
science to the imagination.

&gt;&gt; (these tend to be rich in carbs), veggies (calories there are low but

&gt;digesting and assimilating them.

"/>  Absolutely NOT TRUE.

Labels do list fiber as a carb, but the calorie count on the label
includes 4 calories per gram of carbs excluding fiber.

Next time you see a label with quantities of protein, fat, total
carbs, fiber, categories of carb other than fiber, and calories try adding
9 times the grams of fat plus 4 times the grams of protein plus 4 times
the grams of carbs other than fiber.
Labels can lack grams of starch while showing grams of fiber, sugars,
and total carbs. When the label shows total carbs and sugar and fiber not
adding up to the total, the remainder is starch and maybe &quot;sugar
alcohols&quot; and the like but usually mainly starch - but they count about 4
calories per gram of carbs other than fiber, and fiber as not having
calories.
The total may be off by an amount explainable by grams of anything with
calories being rounded to the nearest gram (such as almost half a gram
of fat being listed as zero) and the total being rounded to a multiple of
10.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Labels do list fiber as a carb, but the calorie count on the label
&gt; includes 4 calories per gram of carbs excluding fiber.

"/> Not quite. There are several optional methods for doing that label.
Here's what the Code of Federal Regulations says about that:

(1) &quot;Calories, total,&quot;&quot;Total calories,&quot; or &quot;Calories&quot;: A
statement of the caloric content per serving, expressed to the nearest
5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories, and 10-calorie
increment above 50 calories, except that amounts less than 5 calories
may be expressed as zero. Energy content per serving may also be
expressed in kilojoule units, added in parentheses immediately following
the statement of the caloric content.

(i) Caloric content may be calculated by the following methods.
Where either specific or general food factors are used, the factors
shall be applied to the actual amount (i.e., before rounding) of food
components (e.g., fat, carbohydrate, protein, or ingredients with
specific food factors) present per serving.

(A) Using specific Atwater factors (i. e., the Atwater method) given
in Table 13, &quot;Energy Value of Foods--Basis and Derivation,&quot; by A. L.
Merrill and B. K. Watt, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Handbook No. 74 (slightly revised, 1973), which is incorporated by
reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 and is
available from the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling and Dietary
Supplements (HFS-800), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition,
Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Pkwy., College Park, MD
20740, or may be inspected at the Office of the Federal Register, 800
North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.;

(B) Using the general factors of 4, 4, and 9 calories per gram for
protein, total carbohydrate, and total fat, respectively, as described
in USDA Handbook No. 74 (slightly revised 1973) pp. 9-11, which is
incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR
part 51 (the availability of this incorporation by reference is given in
paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section);

(C) Using the general factors of 4, 4, and 9 calories per gram for
protein, total carbohydrate less the amount of insoluble dietary fiber,
and total fat, respectively, as described in USDA Handbook No. 74
(slightly revised 1973) pp. 9-11, which is incorporated by reference in
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 (the availability of
this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of
this section;

(D) Using data for specific food factors for particular foods or
ingredients approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
provided in parts 172 or 184 of this chapter, or by other means, as
appropriate; or

(E) Using bomb calorimetry data subtracting 1.25 calories per gram
protein to correct for incomplete digestibility, as described in USDA
Handbook No. 74 (slightly revised 1973) p. 10, which is incorporated by
reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 (the
availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph
(c)(1)(i)(A) of this section).

Carbs aren't measured; they're calculated like this:
&quot;'Total carbohydrate' is calculated by subtracting the weight of crude
protein, total fat, moisture, and ash from the total weight (&quot;wet
weight&quot;) of the sample of food.
21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)&quot;

This below is not quite correct, as explained in quotations above.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just goes to show you, again, that the Atkins diet is only about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; making his empire more money... because the diet certainly isn't

&gt;&gt; No. A diet should be about health. You don't eat &quot;diet foods&quot; to

The low-fat diet started in response to the number of people dropping
dead from heart attacks after eating tons of meat from big fat lazy
mass-market cows, pigs, etc. Farm animals from years past, and natural

and their flesh healthy to eat. Many people just went overboard
thinking that all fat was bad.

The Atkins diet (the latest revision) also has a few good components.
The big one being the *reminder* that refined sugars and carbs are bad.
(I made note of _reminder_ because no one advocated eating lots of
refined carbs.) Atkins was a just scam artist and a good marketing
guy. He used what everyone wanted to hear (eat your meat and fatty
foods), and then tossed in some hokey glycemic thing that targeted
healthy foods like watermelon, bananas, carrots, apples, potatoes,
peas, etc. What a hack! And, amazingly, he made $millions$ doing it.

You only need to look at what is in the shopping baskets people are
pushing (though an increasing number are so obese they're driving them)
around in grocery stores. Most people are loading them up with just
garbage &quot;food and drinks.&quot; Crackers, sausages, frozen dinners and
pizza, chips, bacon, ice cream, lunch meat, soda, hot dogs, white
&quot;bread&quot;, cookies, sugar &quot;cereals&quot;... it's amazing these people can live
on crap like this. And then the kicker is they'll cruise the parking
lot forever until they find a parking slot right next to the front
door. God forbid they had to actually walk some distance. I swear if
grocery stores had drive-up services, people would be wait in long
lines just so they wouldn't even have to get out of their car.
