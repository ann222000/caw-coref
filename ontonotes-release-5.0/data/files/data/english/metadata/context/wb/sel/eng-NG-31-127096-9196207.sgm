Many people seem to be badly confused about these terms, including Pogue
Thompson, who is thoroughly bollixed, discombobulated and confused as to
their characteristics, uses, incongruities and absurdities.

Let's start with the harder one first and then the other will be easier to
understand.

The term &quot;COLLATERAL DESCENDANT&quot; is often grossly misused.

If both D and E are descendants of A, say by different sons, B and C, they
can be described as &quot;collateral descendants&quot; of A -- but it is much more
intelligent, clear, coherent, precise and concise to describe them as 1ST
COUSINS.

However if D is descended from A while E is descended from K, a brother of
A, but NOT from A it is ENTIRELY INCORRECT &amp; INDEED IDIOTIC to describe E as
a &quot;Collateral Descendant&quot; of A.

Some beginner pogues and poguettes in Genealogy who carelessly and loosely
employ this term &quot;Collateral Descendant&quot; are often doing it because they are
descended from K but not from A, who is MORE FAMOUS, ROYAL or NOTORIOUS
[those categories often overlap] and they want to impress the groundlings by
saying THEY THEMSELVES are &quot;Collateral Descendants&quot; of A.

For example, some rampant little poseur pogue may say &quot;I am a collateral
descendant of King Henry VII of England&quot;, when he is not descended from
Henry VII at all but from some other lesser figure.

No Sale...

One is either a descendant of Henry VII or not at all.  One cannot have a
&quot;COLLATERAL DESCENT&quot; from him.

'Nuff Said.

Oh no.

As to definition of the term &quot;collateral descendant&quot;,
it seems very clear to me that the definition offered
by D.Spencer Hines, is one to which only fringe ones
subscribe.

I know of zero respectable sources where the term is
defined in that way. None at all. Literally, zero.

While there exists a number of established sources
which define collateral descendant as
a direct descendant of the subject's siblings (and
some sources accept even cousins and such, in addition
to siblings, as ancestor of &quot;collateral descent&quot;).
The origin is obviously in inheritance law. Quite
often, lineal descent from a subject went extinct, or
lineal male-line descent did that. In which case,
succession to inheritance in right of lineal descent
from a sibling of that subject became crucial.
This of course is a relevant concept, and in use
precisely because it has been needed.

One may criticize that initiators of the term,
presumably lawyers of their era, chose conceptually
incorrect terms, and prefer for example &quot;collateral
relative&quot;, as &quot;collateral heir&quot;. The damage however
has long ago been done (were it deemed damaging...)
We cannot do anything effective to it.

I must opine in this case that readers do better if
they reject totally the definition offered, and
rappidly propounded, by D.Spencer Hines.
The D.S.Hines definition of &quot;collateral descendant&quot; is
in all likelihood not going to do anything good. On
the contrary, it will muddle the propplematic issue
yet worse, particularly if some really start to use
it.

It will always be more difficult if one term has two
different meanings. In such a situation, nobody can be
certain what is really meant by the term, when it is
used.

(Please think about the two often-seen meanings of the
Latin word 'nepos': grandson, and nephew. How much
easier would our work in medieval genealogies be, had
it ever had only one of those two meanings.)
I believe the D.S.Hines offer of definition here, will
cause similar kind of harm, if adopted.

Some points against any usefulness of the D.S.Hines
definition:
1.  The word &quot;descendant&quot; has no substance, no
meaning, in any expression, if it does not answer to
question &quot;whose descendant&quot;. The D.S.Hines definition
would have us to say that a pair of more or less
remote cousins would be &quot;collateral descendants&quot;.
However, without adding &quot;of A&quot;,  or possibly &quot;of each
other&quot; (if the latter is what Hines is aiming at),
even the expression &quot;they are cousins&quot; is more
meaningful than to say &quot;they are collateral
descendants&quot;
2.  In cases where an exact relationship is not known
or bothered with, but two persons descend from the
same ancestor ('A'), there is no need to start call
them as &quot;collateral descendants of A&quot;, because they
are and can be called as &quot;relatives of each other,
both descending from A&quot;.
3. Like D.S.Hines, exceptionally perceptively from
him, points, it would be recommendable to be precise
about their exact relationship. However, such precise
kinship lineage is not always known. Thus, the
D.S.Hines preference (such as &quot;first cousin once
removed&quot;) would work only in a situation where the
kinship is precisely enough known. But, in many
medieval documentation, we only get to know that a
pair of individuals were &quot;consanguineous&quot; with each
other. However, even in such a situation, there is no
need for &quot;collateral descendant&quot; to be taken into THAT
use, because the relationship is better expressed as
&quot;relatives of each other&quot;, or &quot;more or less remote
cousins&quot;, or, as the translation already reads:
&quot;consanguineous with each other&quot;. Another term, fourth
at least, would not be needed the least for this one
purpose, and will be harmful in this meaning because
it already has a different meaning in lots of legal
and other texts.

Now, having resolved the question of &quot;Collateral Descendants&quot;, [vide infra]
let's take up the far simpler issue of &quot;Direct Descendants&quot;.

ALL descendants of a GIVEN INDIVIDUAL, A, are &quot;direct descendants&quot; -- none
are &quot;indirect&quot; or &quot;collateral&quot; descendants.

So, the word &quot;DIRECT&quot; adds no useful meaning to the word descendant -- the
word &quot;DIRECT&quot; is excess baggage, redundant, incongruous, unsuitable ---- and
therefore an oxymoron.

So, it can be excised and deleted.

'Nuff Said.

Let's see now.

I agree with you when you say:
&quot;All descendants of a given individual are direct descendants.&quot;

And I agree with your definition of oxymoron as:
&quot;something (as a concept) that is made up of contradictory or
incongruous elements&quot;

So far so good, but where your logic collapses is in the claim that
&quot;direct descendant&quot; is an oxymoron.

Let me explain where you have gone wrong:
You have rightly said that the term &quot;direct descendant&quot; means exactly
the same as &quot;descendant&quot;. In other words, there is total congruity
between the two terms.

Given that you claim total congruity between the two terms, how then
can there be any incongruity? Redundancy, yes, as in your phrase
&quot;excised and deleted&quot;. But certainly no incongruity.

To claim that redundancy = incongruity is a cheap sleight of hand
which will not fool any of the astute minds here.
To claim that congruity = incongruity is pure Orwellian Newspeak.

Instead of attempting any more logical contorsions it would be easier
if you could be a man and just admit that you used the word oxymoron
erroneously. However, I have no doubt but that you will choose a
different course. Instead of trying to impress us with an
unprecedented display of maturity, you will amuse and amaze us with
your desperate attempts to extract yourself from a predicament of your
own making.

We all know that the phrase &quot;a Hinesian admission of error&quot; is an
oxymoron, as indeed is Hines himself, albeit bereft of the acuity
inherent in the oxy-.

Well, I could see where it started, I just couldn't see that it got anywhere
:-)

He seems to have defined &quot;collateral descendants&quot; out of existence, which
would indeed render &quot;direct descendents&quot; redundant.  But if you *haven't*
done that, &quot;direct descendents&quot; is very necessary, if only to avoid
ambiguity.

&gt;You have rightly said that the term &quot;direct descendant&quot; means exactly
&gt;the same as &quot;descendant&quot;. In other words, there is total congruity
&gt;between the two terms.

&gt;Given that you claim total congruity between the two terms, how then
&gt;can there be any incongruity? Redundancy, yes, as in your phrase
&gt;&quot;excised and deleted&quot;. But certainly no incongruity.

&gt;To claim that redundancy = incongruity is a cheap sleight of hand
&gt;which will not fool any of the astute minds here.
&gt;To claim that congruity = incongruity is pure Orwellian Newspeak.

&gt;Instead of attempting any more logical contorsions it would be easier
&gt;if you could be a man and just admit that you used the word oxymoron
&gt;erroneously. However, I have no doubt but that you will choose a
&gt;different course. Instead of trying to impress us with an
&gt;unprecedented display of maturity, you will amuse and amaze us with
&gt;your desperate attempts to extract yourself from a predicament of your
&gt;own making.

&gt;We all know that the phrase &quot;a Hinesian admission of error&quot; is an
&gt;oxymoron, as indeed is Hines himself, albeit bereft of the acuity
&gt;inherent in the oxy-.

Now, having resolved the question of &quot;Collateral Descendants&quot;, [vide infra]
let's take up the far simpler issue of &quot;Direct Descendants&quot;.

ALL descendants of a GIVEN INDIVIDUAL, A, are &quot;direct descendants&quot; -- none
are &quot;indirect&quot; or &quot;collateral&quot; descendants.

So, the word &quot;DIRECT&quot; adds no useful meaning to the word descendant -- the
word &quot;DIRECT&quot; is excess baggage, redundant, incongruous, unsuitable ---- and
therefore an oxymoron.

So, it can be excised and deleted.

'Nuff Said.

Lux et Veritas et Libertas
----------------------------------------

Many people seem to be badly confused about these terms, including Pogue
Thompson, who is thoroughly bollixed, discombobulated and confused as to
their characteristics, uses, incongruities and absurdities.

Let's start with the harder one first and then the other will be easier to
understand.

The term &quot;COLLATERAL DESCENDANT&quot; is often grossly misused.

If both D and E are descendants of A, say by different sons, B and C, they
can be described as &quot;collateral descendants&quot; of A -- but it is much more
intelligent, clear, coherent, precise and concise to describe them as 1ST
COUSINS.

However if D is descended from A while E is descended from K, a brother of
A, but NOT from A it is ENTIRELY INCORRECT &amp; INDEED IDIOTIC to describe E as
a &quot;Collateral Descendant&quot; of A.

Some beginner pogues and poguettes in Genealogy who carelessly and loosely
employ this term &quot;Collateral Descendant&quot; are often doing it because they are
descended from K but not from A, who is MORE FAMOUS, ROYAL or NOTORIOUS
[those categories often overlap] and they want to impress the groundlings by
saying THEY THEMSELVES are &quot;Collateral Descendants&quot; of A.

For example, some rampant little poseur pogue may say &quot;I am a collateral
descendant of King Henry VII of England&quot;, when he is not descended from
Henry VII at all but from some other lesser figure.

No Sale...

One is either a descendant of Henry VII or not at all.  One cannot have a
&quot;COLLATERAL DESCENT&quot; from him.

'Nuff Said.

No Hines is saying &quot;Collateral descendants&quot; only refers to an expression
like &quot;John Brown and I are collateral descendents of Grizzell Bacon&quot;

Hines is saying you cannot say *I* am a collateral descendant of Grizzell
Bacon.  Only that *we* are of each other (so-to-speak).

Please forgive my unwarranted exhibitionism.

In the past it has invariably been my practice to remove sgm from the
list of groups when the message to which I replied has had nothing to
do with medieval genealogy.

Just out of interest, what do you do with the nondisappearing words
you &quot;excise&quot; from a text? How do you dispose of them? Landfill?
Recycling? And deleted/erased words often leave an impression in
manuscripts or their traces can be detected with the aid of
ultraviolet light, so they don't always disappear totally.

Bet let us not quibble about that. The verbs &quot;excise&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; are
close enough in meaning to appear together in synonym dictionaries. In
Rodale's excellent Synonym Finder the entry for &quot;excise&quot; starts with
&quot;expunge, delete, erase; strike out, cross out ...&quot; Using the two
verbs together is therefore redundant, in the dictionary sense of
&quot;that can be omitted without any loss of significance.&quot;

By that definition, of course, anything Hines writes is redundant.

Here are some quotations from the Usenet archives with the superfluous
use of the term &quot;direct descendant&quot;:

&quot;if she is indeed a direct descendant of the Marquess of Queensberry&quot;
&quot;direct descendants of a President and Barbara Bush dog&quot;

These come from messages signed DSH.

_Au Cointreau_, we have the following authoritative pronouncements,
also signed DSH:

&quot;'Direct descendant' is a very clumsy and redundant phrase.&quot;
&quot;Therefore a competent Genealogist, whether Professional or Amateur,
should never use oxymorons or gibberish such as the amusing compounds
'DIRECT DESCENDANT' or 'COLLATERAL ANCESTOR'&quot;

I don't know whose example to follow, that of DSH or DSH.

It seems to be a case of &quot;anything goes&quot; or &quot;make up your own rules.&quot;
Oh well, since we have been told that &quot;there are no facts in history,&quot;
it's hardly surprising to be informed that there are no rules in
language.

This sort of wooly-headed reasoning is what we Americans have reaped
from the poisoned seeds sown by the leftest &quot;Educators&quot; at Yale in the
sixties.

&gt; &gt;Your *oxymoron* argument is logical, and I agree that the word *direct*
&gt; &gt;would probably be more correctly termed, redundant. However, I'm curious
&gt; &gt;as to your classification of *excised* and *deleted* as redundant. If I
&gt; &gt;delete something, it is erased. If I excise something, I cut it out. It
&gt; &gt;doesn't necessarily disappear. What was your reasoning?

&gt; Just out of interest, what do you do with the nondisappearing words
&gt; you &quot;excise&quot; from a text? How do you dispose of them? Landfill?
&gt; Recycling? And deleted/erased words often leave an impression in
&gt; manuscripts or their traces can be detected with the aid of
&gt; ultraviolet light, so they don't always disappear totally.

&gt; Bet let us not quibble about that. The verbs &quot;excise&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; are
&gt; close enough in meaning to appear together in synonym dictionaries. In
&gt; Rodale's excellent Synonym Finder the entry for &quot;excise&quot; starts with
&gt; &quot;expunge, delete, erase; strike out, cross out ...&quot; Using the two
&gt; verbs together is therefore redundant, in the dictionary sense of
&gt; &quot;that can be omitted without any loss of significance.&quot;

&gt; By that definition, of course, anything Hines writes is redundant.

&gt; Here are some quotations from the Usenet archives with the superfluous
&gt; use of the term &quot;direct descendant&quot;:

&gt; &quot;if she is indeed a direct descendant of the Marquess of Queensberry&quot;
&gt; &quot;direct descendants of a President and Barbara Bush dog&quot;

&gt; These come from messages signed DSH.

&gt; _Au Cointreau_, we have the following authoritative pronouncements,
&gt; also signed DSH:

&gt; &quot;'Direct descendant' is a very clumsy and redundant phrase.&quot;
&gt; &quot;Therefore a competent Genealogist, whether Professional or Amateur,
&gt; should never use oxymorons or gibberish such as the amusing compounds
&gt; 'DIRECT DESCENDANT' or 'COLLATERAL ANCESTOR'&quot;

&gt; I don't know whose example to follow, that of DSH or DSH.

&gt; It seems to be a case of &quot;anything goes&quot; or &quot;make up your own rules.&quot;
&gt; Oh well, since we have been told that &quot;there are no facts in history,&quot;
&gt; it's hardly surprising to be informed that there are no rules in
&gt; language.

&gt; This sort of wooly-headed reasoning is what we Americans have reaped

This list is, apparently, famed for using acronyms: so I will just say
that I am a member of the MLA, and if there is anything we members
are aware of, it is the vagaries of language.  When *Love Story* was
translated into Japanese, a slack-jowled character was said to have
&quot;trousers on his face.&quot;  [  :)  ]

I am bemused by this whole *descendant* vs. *direct descendant*
discussion.  I have been accused of being a naif among giants when
it comes to gen-medieval matters, and I readily admit such.  However,
as stated: I have been doing personal family history  since the 1970s.
Not all here can match that history.

In the past, for *emphasis* to an incredulous unbeliever, I have said
*direct descendant* in the hopes that the adjective would place inordinate
emphasis on the fact I was a descendant of so-in-so!  To be it is,
in that usage, not a question of being redundant (as I fully understand
the vagaries of the argument, pro and con), but it is a question of
degree of emphasis, tonality in the statement which sometimes we
as speakers and writers adhere to for clarity's sake.

In France: the Monsieurs of the world have the prestigious Academy
which *dictates* language usage [recall: I am a member of MLA]
whereas in England and America, we gents and ladies have the
unprestigious dictionaries which *describe* usage AFTER THE FACT.
Hence, it is A-OK for me to say: for emphasis: direct descendant,
for emphasis of the fact.

A-OK?

Yes, for emphasis when speaking or writing to ignorant, untutored naïfs in
The Great Unwashed Masses....

I've done the same....

But not when speaking or writing for the cognoscenti....

If and when you can find them.

Monsieur Hines,

This is all very interesting.  I just so happen to live in Palm Beach county,
just east of Palm Beach, an island enclave of royalists!  I once met a gent
from Palm Beach who found out where I lived, on the other side of the
waterway, and said, &quot;O, you live among The Great Unwashed Masses.&quot;
You wouldn't happen to be him, would you?

You must know we Americans dumped some over-priced English tea into
the Charles [sic] river and started a Revolution because of some of the
bloody Red-coat Royalists who over-taxed us.  And now, D. Spencer Hines
is over-taxing gen-medieval: and me.

Cognoscenti are &quot;persons who have superior knowledge and understanding
of a particular field, esp. in the fine arts, literature, and world of fashion.&quot;

http://www.emilydickinson.org/edis/scholars/scholars.htm

By that definition: with my M.F.A. (Fine Arts) I am in your class of *cognoscenti.*

So bloody what?  It is not the pose which makes the man or woman but the knowledge
and understanding of a particular field which s/he can share with others.  As a
former professor of English, I can rightly say that: as I was long underpaid and
overworked, but loved every minute of it.

As to my Brit friends, here and abroad, Rule Britannica!  We Americans have
long got over over-taxed tea :)

And as for D. Spencer Hines: he should take up underwater basket-weaving!

Bill
