Liddy is the ultimate bully- can't open his mouth without telling you what a
bad man he is, and subject to take revenge for a slight. He turned out to be
everything he claimed to despise, from a criminal to a media-blabbermouth.
Pitiful.
And Ollie North too.
too greedy to even be ashamed of themselves.

Oh he was an overzealous person to say the least. I remember he actually
wanted to kill the political opposition. Really overboard. Kind of a fucked
up philosophy too - "The big fish eat the little fish,"  But the guy was
smart as a whip too. Scared everyone around him. His book was a fun read
though. Still have it around here somewhere.
I had a boss that served with the 442nd Regimental Combat Unit ( Japanese
American Unit ) as one of their caucasian officers. That unit was the most
heavily decorated unit in WW II.  He was badly wounded at Monte Cassino.
Funny thing is - he thought a lot of Liddy because he kept his mouth shut.
Refused to make any deals with the feds. Always thought that a bit strange.

Cant answer for North - never payed too much attention to him. I remember
one of my army pilot buddies said about North: " Those kind of guys always
screw things up for everyone."

In a criminal conspiracy? Against his holy oath?

He served under a cross-dressing closet queen extortionist/blackmailer; he
knew there were indignities even he couldn't stomach.

He was a Marine Colonel- those guys are generally thought to be more
trustworthy, even when people aren't watching.
He shamed his uniform and the Corps.
