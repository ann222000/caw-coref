The Power of Israel in the United States
http://www.rinf.com/columnists/news/the-power-of-israel-in-the-united...
Stephen Lendman

James Petras is Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Binghamton
University, New York. He's a noted academic figure on the US Left and
a well-respected Latin American expert and longtime chronicler of the
region's popular struggles. He's also an advisor to the landless
workers in Brazil and the unemployed workers movement in Argentina.
Along the way, he managed to find time to write many hundreds of
articles and 62 books published in 29 languages including his latest
one in which he discusses another vital world region he has extensive
knowledge of and has written frequently about - the Middle East and
specifically the state of Israel and its relations with its neighbors,
the Palestinians and, most importantly and the subject of this book,
the US.

Petras' powerful new book is titled The Power of Israel in the United
States. It's a work of epic writing and essential reading documenting
the enormous influence of the Jewish Lobby on US policy in the Middle
East. It focuses like a laser to assure that policy conforms with
Israel's long-term goal for regional hegemony. The Lobby's influence
is broad and deep enough to include officials at the highest levels of
government, the business community, academia, the clergy (especially
the dominant Christian fundamentalists/Christian Zionists) and the
mass media. Petras shows how together they're able to assure the full
and unconditional US support for all elements of Israel's agenda going
back decades even when that agenda harms our interests such as the
unwinnable war in Iraq, any future one against Iran if it's
undertaken, and the appalling and brutal subjugation and colonization
of the Palestinian people that serves no US interest whatever. In
spite of it, the Lobby is able to get the US to go along with Israel
unconditionally with no serious opposition to it tolerated.

The book is divided into four parts. This review will cover each one
in detail, and what's discussed will likely surprise any reader
unfamiliar with the thoroughly documented account presented in it so
compellingly. Petras sets the table in his introduction for what's to
come in the later chapters. He notes what author JJ Goldberg reported
in his book Jewish Power: Inside the Jewish Establishment. Goldberg
wrote in the early 1990s that 45% of the Democrat Party's fundraising
and 25% of that for the Republicans came from Jewish-funded Political
Action Committees (PACS). Petras then updates the numbers using the
ones Richard Cohen published in the Washington Post showing them now
at 60% and 35% respectively, and that this funding relates to a single
core issue - unconditional US support for Israel's agenda including
those parts of it human rights activists and observers of conscience
judge most egregious and illegal. Petras stresses that no other single
US lobby including Big Pharma, Big Oil, agribusiness, or any other one
has this kind of dominant influence over the political process here.
He refers to &quot;Zioncon&quot; ideologues and policymakers whose main goal is
to make the Middle East into a &quot;US-Israeli Co-Prosperity Sphere&quot; under
the fraudulent cover of promoting democracy in the region - but doing
it through the barrel of a gun.

Petras explains the root of the Lobby's power lies in the high
proportion of Jewish families who are among the wealthiest and most
influential ones in the country. He cites Forbes magazine that
reported 25 - 30% of the wealthiest families here are Jewish despite
the small percentage of Jews in the population overall. They include
billionaires with enormous influence, and along with all others
comprising the Jewish Lobby, have created a &quot;tyranny of Israel over
the US&quot; with consequences grave enough to threaten world peace and
stability, the global economy, and the very future of democracy in
this country.

That democracy and our constitutionally protected rights now hang by a
thread after the recent passage of the Military Commissions Act (aka
the &quot;torture authorization act&quot; or more accurately the &quot;US
Constitutional annulment act&quot;) that makes everyone everywhere an
&quot;enemy combatant&quot; subject to arrest and detention out of sight
anywhere in the world without regard for our (no longer)
constitutionally guaranteed rights. The new law also applies to US
citizens as the Jose Padilla case showed. We've effectively lost our
habeas and due process rights even though technically we still have
them.

Because of the Lobby's power, Petras reports, the US has
unconditionally supported Israel's wars of aggression since 1967. It's
influence also led to the US Gulf war in 1991 and the second Iraq war
begun in 2003, now raging out of control and seen by some noted
analysts as unwinnable and causing potential irreparable economic and
political harm to the nation. Nonetheless, it persists with no plan
agreed on to end it. The Lobby also guaranteed this country's
unconditional support for Israel's illegal wars of aggression against
Lebanon and Palestine with all the devastation they caused and the
horrendous consequences from them unresolved. The Palestinian conflict
still rages under the radar, and the status in Lebanon hangs by a hair
trigger ready to erupt again any time Israel decides to resume
hostilities. But inflaming the Middle East powder keg to a near
boiling point is the strong possibility the US and/or Israel will
attack Iran because Israel wants it and the Jewish Lobby put its
powerful support behind it. More on this, Palestine and Lebanon below.

Today the situation in the Middle East is so dire, Petras reports a
large majority of Europeans and a growing number of Americans believe
Israel is the greatest of all threats to world peace and stability.
Nonetheless, the Bush administration, in acquiescence to the Lobby,
has &quot;bludgeoned&quot; its European partners to go along with its
uncompromising support for the Jewish state despite all the obvious
perils from it. In this country, open debate is stifled, public
figures and academics daring to air one truthfully are pilloried,
ridiculed, called anti-semitic and even threatened, and no serious
dissent is ever tolerated in the corporate-run media or their funded
and controlled so-called public radio or PBS parts of it.

No publication is more servile to, supportive of, or more influential
than the nation's so-called &quot;paper of record&quot; publishing &quot;All the News
That's Fit to Print&quot; - the New York Times. It's important because the
stories it features prominently resonate around the country and the
world. This dominant newspaper pledges unconditional support and
fealty to the state of Israel whatever it does. The rest of the major
media go along unquestioningly putting out regular one-sided pro-
Israel uber alles propaganda with no opposition voices allowed to
represent other points of view. We call that a free press - but only
for those who own one. The state of the corporate-controlled media in
this country is now so pathetic that Reporters Sans Frontieres
(Reporters without Borders - for press freedom) just ranked the US
53rd in the world in press freedom behind countries like Benin,
Namibia, Jamaica, France and Bolivia.

James Petras is a courageous independent voice who bucks this
disturbing trend and refuses to go along. He proves it in his powerful
and carefully documented new book that gives no quarter countering the
mendacity, deceit and danger of the Lobby, its acolytes and hangers-
on, and the corrupted major media. In his introduction, he calls for a
&quot;counter-hegemonic movement&quot; to free us from our destructive &quot;Israeli
entanglements.&quot; It's needed to begin rebuilding our democracy and
freedoms that are somewhere between life support and the crematorium.
This book, he says, is his modest effort toward that goal. Because of
the important information in it, it's considerably more than that. It
needs widespread exposure so people will know about it. Hopefully this
review will help arouse some of them to want to find out in more
detail.

Part I - Zionist Power in America

Petras begins with a discussion of who fabricated the lies about
Iraq's threat to our security and why. He mentions two competing
channels of policy makers and advisors - the long-in-place formal
structure of career military and civilian professionals in the
Pentagon and State Department and a parallel one Bush administration
neocons set up for this one purpose in the Pentagon, staffed by
political appointees, and called the Office of Special Plans (OSP). It
was the OSP's job to cook the books, come up with the idea of weapons
of mass destruction while ignoring the clear evidence to the contrary
and contrive a fraudulent case for war against Iraq. The people in it
were those in Donald Rumsfeld's and Paul Wolfowitz's chain of command
and were closely connected to a number of influential neoconservative
and pro-Israel organizations. They planned a war agenda based on lies
because Israel wanted it for its security and hegemony in the region -
beginning with the overthrow of Saddam Hussein followed by regime
change in Syria, Lebanon, Iran and even Saudi Arabia.

Petras points out, contrary to popular belief, this war happened
largely due to the efforts of the Jewish Lobby representing the
interests of Israel. Big Oil opposed the idea because it feared
attacking Iraq would jeopardize its business prospects with other oil-
producing states in the region. Still, Israel and the Jewish Lobby got
their war, and aside from the gain from high oil prices, Big Oil may
end up a longer-term loser from it. US oil interests always prefer
stability and normal relationships with countries where they operate
or wish to and were quite comfortable dealing with Saddam Hussein
without wanting to risk a war that might upset an otherwise profitable
arrangement. Their fears proved justified as the war they feared
created such unresolved turbulence in Iraq, it's become too dangerous
and unprofitable to undertake new ventures there except perhaps in
parts of the Kurdish-controlled north. Big Oil also chafes at not
being allowed to deal with the Iranians for contracts now let to its
European and other competitors because US sanctions prevent them from
doing business there. It's hard to imagine those interests would ever
go along with US - Israeli belligerence in the Middle East, but they
dare not oppose it publicly.

Petras observes there's never a public discussion allowed about that
relationship in the mainstream nor will there ever be any, especially
any hint the US attacked Iraq in service to Israel. There should be
plenty of it though because the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have enraged
hundreds of millions of Muslims and all people of conscience
worldwide. They've caused the US to be seen as a pariah state and
George Bush as a dangerous and morally depraved president of a failed
administration. He and those closest to him like Richard Cheney and
Donald Rumsfeld are reviled around the world and increasingly here at
home as witnessed by the many thousands who took to the streets on
October 5 in over 200 US cities on The World Can't Wait Day - Drive
Out the Bush Regime. The cost of Bush's wars far exceed any possible
future benefits from them, our security has been jeopardized, the
nation's status has been compromised, and some analysts believe the
total dollar cost of the Iraq adventure may eventually top $2 trillion
- an amount extremely harmful to the nation's economy that's now
worrying key business leaders and responsible people in government.

The only clear beneficiary of the Bush war agenda is Israel. It
removed its main adversary in the region and cut off the political and
economic support it gave the Palestinians. Petras points out that Iraq
along with Iran and Syria comprised the core resistance to Israel's
expansionist plans to crush the Palestinians (one down, two to go),
ethnically cleanse them from their homeland and seize their land as
one part of a long-term goal for a greater Israel and unchallengeable
dominance in the region. Israel is the only country in the world with
undeclared borders. It's kept that status to give itself maximum
latitude to annex all the territory it can toward the goal of a
greater &quot;Eretz Israel&quot; Zionists want that includes the ancient lands
of &quot;Judea&quot; and &quot;Summaria,&quot; the West Bank biblical parts of Israel
Palestinians claim as their homeland.

With US help, Israel removed one threat to its plan for regional
supremacy, but it still faces determined resistance from the
Palestinians in spite of having crushed its democratically elected
Hamas government. It also faces a resilient Hezbollah in Lebanon that
humiliated the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in the summer war there as
well as opposition from Iran and Syria. In addition, there's internal
opposition within Israel over its war and colonization agenda because
of its enormous cost plus the added insecurity it causes. It's
resulted in a level of out-migration now exceeding new arrivals as
well as an erosion of the nation's social programs because the state
needs the resources for its aggression and annexation agenda. It's
much like what's happening under the Bush administration where the
people pay the price for imperial wars abroad and the moral decay and
authoritarianism at home.

Obstacles and setbacks aside, Israel has pursued its goal to
&quot;democratize&quot; the region through a belligerent policy of neutralizing
its enemies in it by force. The plan they crafted is for a series of
wars with its US ally taking the lead and the eventual goal of joint
US - Israeli control over the entire region. Making it work depends on
getting US administrations to go along, which so far hasn't been a
problem and has never been easier with the Bush administration in
power and the high-level pro-Zionist officials in it with long-
standing ties to Israel. They have the most important policy-making
positions in government or are closely associated with the ones who
do. These officials have a history of dedication to Israel's interests
even when they conflict with those here at home. They're in the
administration, the Congress as well as in the most influential Jewish
organizations and lobbying groups like the Conference of Presidents of
Major Jewish Organizations, the Anti-Defamation League and what some
observers believe is the single most powerful lobby in Washington -
AIPAC.

Committed support for Israel also comes from the &quot;Jewish Diaspora&quot;
that comprises thousands of dedicated activists here - doctors,
dentists, philanthropists, key individuals on Wall Street, the major
banks and the Federal Reserve and other key segments of business, the
major media, the clergy and academics and journalists given special
prominence because of their willingness to corrupt their integrity in
return for the handsome benefits they get for their unconditional
public support and contrived rationalizations for the US -Israeli
agenda. This kind of influence and support has made Israel by far the
largest recipient in the world of US financial aid that amounts
upfront to about $3 billion a year with more forthcoming any time as
needed in added funding, weapons transfers and large low or no-
interest loans that may never have to be repaid.

Israel also gets the unheard of advantage of receiving the latest and
most advanced US arms and technology, unrestricted US market access
for its products and services, free entry of its immigrants,
unconditional support for its aggressive wars and colonization of the
Palestinians and South Lebanese, and guaranteed US vetoes in the
Security Council against all UN resolutions unfavorable to its
interests. It's also able to get prominent Washington officials and
the dominant corporate-run and funded media to label all criticism of
Israel anti-semitic and freely uses this ruse whenever it serves its
purpose. Israel is allowed to get away with its intelligence
operations here as well including its covert penetration of military
bases, the FBI, IRS, INS, EPA and many other government agencies. In
addition, it's believed its agents knew in advance about the 9/11
attack but withheld the information knowing it would serve its
interests to let it happen. There's also considerable evidence high US
officials either knew about it themselves or were complicit in
carrying it out because they also knew it would allow them the kind of
reckless free reign at home and abroad they never could have gotten
any other way. This is a story that won't go away nor should it, and
one day we may finally learn all the parts of it we can only speculate
about now.

Because of Israel's unparalleled ties to the centers of power and
dominant media, Petras notes it's able get back $50 in return for
every dollar it spends. That's how it's able to finance its military
and colonial settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT)
on annexed land. The Jewish networks here support these practices as
justifiable compensation allowed victims of the &quot;Holocaust&quot; (the ones
noted author John Pilger calls &quot;worthy victims&quot;) and circulate that
ideology in the corporate media. They also reinforce anti-Muslim
hysteria labelling all Arabs untrustworthy, radical Islamic
fundamentalists or Islamo-fascists (&quot;unworthy&quot; victims for John
Pilger), claiming the right to arrest, torture and mete out summary
justice to them in military tribunals or just attack and kill them in
imperial wars of &quot;liberation.&quot;

The result for Israel and its people has been disastrous because the
Palestinians have refused for almost six decades to accede to this
abuse and have waged two Intifadas to end it. With little more than a
fierce determination, their bodies and crude weapons, they've fought
back with suicide bombings and attacks on public facilities in Israel
knowing what harsh retaliation they'll face afterward. People in the
US have also paid a heavy price in the erosion of democracy and
freedom. It's evidenced by the Bush administration's harsh legislation
beginning with the infamous USA Patriot Act passed in short order
right after the 9/11 attack, followed by other repressive laws and
practices allowed like illegal surveillance and secret renditions of
anyone targeted to torture-prisons with court acquiescence or silence
about most of them.

Petras points out that none of this deters powerful supporters of
Israel who raise billions of dollars to support the country's war
machine and finance its colonization of annexed Palestinian land plus
the Golan Heights (with its invaluable water resources) seized and
never returned to Syria after the 1967 war. Israel's economy is not
self-sufficient, and without this aid, it would have to make
unacceptable cuts in social services, reduce its military budget and
curtail its expansionary plans. With it, plus the $3 billion a year
direct US contribution and lots more help, US taxpayers (like it or
not) have the burden of funding Israel's belligerence and colonization
agenda.

Petras itemizes what it all costs:

- $3 billion annually in direct aid.

- Billions more in loans as needed.

- Millions annually for resettlement help for Soviet (now Russian) and
Ethiopian immigrants.

- a $10 billion loan guarantee in 1990 and a further $9 billion one in
2004 plus billions more for the asking and to be forthcoming to pay
the costs of the 2006 Lebanon and Palestine wars.

- Since 1981, economic aid made in cash transfers, and since 1985
military aid done the same way.

- $45 billion in repayment waved loans since 1974 and billions more
for the asking - free money at US taxpayer expense.

- Since 1982, ESF cash transfers in one early in the fiscal year lump
sum with no strings attached while other countries receiving them are
paid quarterly with their use monitored. Israel invests the money in
US treasuries costing US taxpayers millions more annually and also
gets special FMS funding arrangements costing US taxpayers well over
$1 billion since 1991.

- Other privileged benefits include financial aid to develop Israel's
defense industry, transfer of state-of-the-art technology and the
latest US weapons, US guarantee for Israel's access to oil, and the
likely massive aid still to come to defray the country's &quot;special
costs&quot; for its Gaza &quot;disengagement plan&quot; morphing into the
colonization of whatever parts of the OPT Israel wishes to annex for
new settlements US taxpayers pay for.

- Add to this some $22 billion Israel got over the past 50 years
through the sale of its below-market interest paying bonds that have
financed half of its development - meaning the colonization of annexed
Palestinian lands and military funding for its predatory imperial
wars.

Petras explains the Zionist power structure in the US makes it all
possible, but its reach extends well beyond the so-called &quot;Jewish
Lobby.&quot; He identifies a &quot;Zionist power configuration (ZPC) that
includes AIPAC as one part of a &quot;complex network of interrelated
formal and informal groupings, operating at the international,
national, regional, and local levels&quot; unconditionally supporting the
state of Israel and all its policies including its wars, colonization
and oppression. It's power is like a cancer infecting the highest
levels of government and all the other centers of power and influence
as already explained. It controls the selection of political
candidates and can defeat incumbents or aspirants daring to criticize
Israel. It also shapes the reporting on Israel in the mass media
suppressing any of it that's unsupportive or critical. And it's
powerful enough to get &quot;uncooperative&quot; journalists, and even some
academics, fired and banished from the mainstream for daring to step
out of line.

Petras reports the power of the ZPC was evident in the run-up to the
Iraq war and the Gulf war before it in 1991. Going back to the GHW
Bush administration, the US wanted regime change in Iraq, but that
decision was heavily influenced by the ZPC that considered Saddam a
mortal enemy of Israel who had to be removed. He managed to survive
through the 1990s despite our efforts to destabilize the country and
bring it to its knees. But once the GW Bush administration neocons
took over in 2001, the ugly business of war planning and occupation
took hold to complete what the Gulf war left unfinished, and powerful
Zionists (like Paul Wolfowitz and Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman -
the senator from AIPAC) in key policy-making positions invented the
threat to bring it about in March, 2003 - all based on lies, deceit
and subservience to Israel's imperial agenda.

The US military finally removed Saddam and conducted a scorched-earth
campaign to destroy Iraqi society, its infrastructure and historical
treasures to &quot;dismantle the secular state (and) turn the country in a
desert kingdom - a loose collection of at least three 'tribal' client
mini-states based on ethnicities, religious-tribal loyalties (and no
viable threat against) Israeli expansionism, particularly in Northern
Iraq.&quot; The effort to do this is now underway after the Iraq puppet
parliament's passage of its federalism bill to take effect in 18
months that will effectively divide the country into the three US-
ordered, designed and supposedly more easily governed parts it wants.

It's unlikely this can work, but it's clearer than ever now what the
human cost of the war has been for Iraqis. It caused the violent
deaths of about 655,000 of them attributable to the war according to a
shocking new study published by the noted Lancet British medical
journal which updated their two earlier ones done after March, 2003.
The study used the statistically reliable technique known as random
households &quot;cluster sampling&quot; with personal interviews conducted
across the country that used death certificate verification in the
great majority of cases to come up with the total. It's likely the
true number of deaths is even much higher than this appalling number
as the interviewers were unable to include in their count the most
dangerous and violent parts of the country like Fallujah, Ramadi and
other areas of al Anbar province where mass killing still goes on
daily as well as families (likely in the thousands) in which all the
members were killed.

This new information, just out and covering a period since March,
2003, compares to Human Rights Watch's estimate of 250,000 - 290,000
people killed by Saddam Hussein's Baathist regime over its 20 year
existence. It amplifies the outrageous crime of this barbarous
adventure to achieve a &quot;Greater Middle East US-Israel Co-Prosperity
Sphere&quot; and to give Israel access to the extra water, oil, capital and
markets it lacks. It was also part of Israel's greater agenda under
the Sharon Likud, and now Olmert Kadima, governments to have free
reign to pursue their stated policy of &quot;annexation and separation&quot; in
the OPT. The Zionist influence in the Bush administration is so
entrenched, it assured there'd be no opposition to it then or now.

It's all gone on in spite of mass anti-imperial resistance to what's
seen as an arrogant disregard for the standards and norms of
international behavior and laws in the pursuit of an expansionist
agenda. Israel and the US today willfully violate the UN Charter, the
Hague Regulations and Geneva Conventions relative to the conduct of
war and when it may be legally waged, the treatment of prisoners, the
use of torture, destruction of infrastructure and historical sites,
and plunder of natural resources to establish client puppet-run
regimes exploiting their people in service to the dominant capital and
political interests of their imperial conquerors.

Then to quell resistance and tighten security, the US and Israel
resort to the most extreme methods including mass arrests and
detentions and the free use of torture and targeted assassinations as
state policy. Amnesty International reports since the passage of the
Military Commissions Act of 2006, the US and Israel are the only two
countries in the world to have legalized the use of torture. Petras
and others report the top leaders in the Pentagon up to Donald
Rumsfeld specifically ordered its use &quot;while the Justice and Defense
Departments insisted that the President could override any laws -
international or national as well as the US Constitution - in
defending the empire.&quot; These top officials in key areas of government
have audaciously given the President &quot;de facto and de jure dictatorial
powers&quot; to do whatever he chooses to establish &quot;Imperial Security.&quot; It
makes our citizens at home no safer than the victims of US and Israeli
imperial aggression in Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine or anywhere else in
the world.

But Petras reports it's even worse than that as the expose of torture
in Iraq revealed a highly organized network of US and Israeli
assassins worldwide. They operate as international death squads
engaged in &quot;killing, kidnapping and torturing 'suspects' and
sympathizers of resistance movements.&quot; Petras calls this a US-
sponsored &quot;Murder Incorporated&quot; that's composed of Army Special
Forces, Navy Seals and a DELTA force operating in a Special Agency
Program (SAP). It follows the same practices long engaged in by
Israel's Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations known as
the Mossad, and its aim is to remove all opposition by whatever
extralegal methods it chooses while ignoring international law. It
then justifies this activity at the highest levels of government as a
matter of policy.

Petras further points to the UN's International Leadership report on
the destruction of civilian and military infrastructure in Iraq (much
like what Israel did in the OPT discussed below). It showed &quot;84% of
Iraq's higher learning institutions have been burnt, looted or
destroyed.&quot; Archeological museums and historic sites, libraries and
archives have also been plundered, and targeted assassinations have
been carried out against academics, other teachers, senior military
personnel, journalists and other professionals including doctors. In
addition, there are random or targeted daily terror killings by US-
directed &quot;Salvador option&quot; death squads as well as thousands of
kidnappings and other systematic horrors making life intolerable for
most everyone in the country outside the four square kilometer
fortress-like Green Zone HQ in central Baghdad for &quot;coalition&quot;
officials and the puppet &quot;Iraq interim government.&quot;

It's all part of Washington's design to destroy the country's cultural
identity as an Arab state, separate its oil resources from any large
population base, and divide the nation into more easily governed parts
just the way it was done in the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
It's now been reported that longtime Bush family consigliere James
Baker, co-chairing an Iraq Study Group, will formerly propose the kind
of plan the Iraq puppet government just passed putting a quasi-
official US imprimatur on it as part of a US - Israeli divide and
conquer strategy that may not be as easy to pull off as as the one in
the former Yugoslavia or in the simple north - south divisions of
Korea and Vietnam after WW II.

What's happening today in Iraq and Palestine is so outrageous and
chaotic, Petras refers to a &quot;House of Horrors&quot; in both countries with
the Zionist militarists at the Pentagon and their Israeli counterparts
in charge of their respective &quot;Horror Shows....under the big tent of a
'Mid-East Democratic Reform Initiative.' &quot; This is the modus operandi
of empire building and colonization - blast and tear a nation to
shreds so it can never again exist as it once did. Then terrorize the
people into submission and kill off all the ones who resist. It's a
barbaric thumb in the eye to humanity, but this is the way rogue
empires do things, especially when they're too powerful to challenge.

The US-led killing machine is in full operation in Iraq, and so is the
Israeli one in the OPT. Petras calls the one there &quot;Israel's Final
Solution&quot; or the &quot;Palestinian Holocaust,&quot; and it's focal point is in
Gaza which even unoccupied is the world's largest open-air prison for
its 1.45 million people in the most densely populated space of its
size in the world. Today the Strip and the West Bank are Israeli-
directed killing fields targeting Palestinian civilians helpless to
stop it beyond their courageous acts of desperation with crude weapons
and their bodies against tanks, F-16s, helicopter gunships, and
illegal and immoral terror weapons like white phosphorus bombs and
shells, cluster bombs that never stop killing and maiming, and
experimental new weapons that don't have publicly-known names yet.

Israel's war on Palestine has gone on for nearly six decades, and
September 28 marked the sixth anniversary of the al-Aqsa Mosque
Intifada resistance against it that began with Ariel Sharon's
provocative visit to the holy site in 2000. Israel dramatically
escalated the conflict after the minor June 25, 2006 incident at an
Israeli military post near Kerem Shalom crossing killing two IDF
soldiers, injuring several others and capturing a third still held
whose name the corporate media made sure everyone knows but won't ever
reveal any of over-10,000 names of Palestinian prisoners held (the
fate of &quot;unworthy victims&quot;). The June clash followed a series of
bloody earlier in the month Israeli attacks on Gaza including the
widely reported beach shelling that killed eight Palestinians and
injured 32 others including 13 children. Much as it did in Lebanon
(discussed below), Israel's response was swift, deadly,
disproportionate to what happened and planned months in advance as
revealed by General Yoav Galant, in charge of Gaza, in a candid
interview he gave in Israel's Maariv daily.

The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) documented it all
including the devastation of the past six years. Overall it created a
state of mass-immiseration for the Palestinian people in Gaza and the
West Bank:

- essential infrastructure affecting power, clean water and sanitation
destroyed

- mobility restricted or denied

- imposition of an embargo threatening the collapse of an already weak
economy creating unemployment up to 80% of the population

- hostile incursions into the OPT, daily killings, and frequent extra-
judicial assassinations

- home and property demolitions

- mass arbitrary arrests, administrative detentions of thousands of
Palestinians without charge, and the systematic use of torture on
those held including against women and children

- the destruction of a viable Hamas-led Palestinian Authority (PA)
through imprisonments of its democratically elected members held
without charge or on contrived ones against them as well as the
destruction of its civil and security facilities

All this and much more has been done (as in Iraq) to destroy the
cultural identity and very existence of the Palestinian people to
prevent them from ever having a viable independent state of their own
as well as force a mass-Palestinian exodus to other Arab states
willing to help them escape their intolerable situation in the OPT.

The plan to crush these defenseless people now includes credible
evidence that the Bush and Olmert administrations have been arming,
training and plotting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his
Fatah followers to lead a civil uprising against the Hamas-led
Palestinian Authority (PA) and destroy it by force. It follows the
Palestinians failed efforts to form a national unity government
because Hamas refused Fatah's demand to govern as Israel's enforcer
and abandon its own pledge to serve the welfare of its people. Now in
an interview on October 8 in the London Sunday Times, Fatah militia
leader Tawfig Tirawi, inflamed matters by accusing Hamas of
&quot;accumulating weapons&quot; and that &quot;a full-scale civil war can break out
at any moment.&quot; He earlier said &quot;civil war is inevitable.&quot; The paper
also reported President Abbas &quot;notified the US, Jordan and Egypt that
he is preparing to take action against Hamas.&quot; These statements defy
Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh who firmly said he'll never allow
a civil war to happen, and it's unimaginable the Palestinian people
want one. But Haniyeh and his people may have no choice as this seems
to be the current joint US-Israeli strategy to destroy Palestinian
resistance and do it with help from Fatah President Abbas. This is the
same man who pledged his fealty to Israel as a participant in crafting
the Oslo Accords sellout of his people and being a principle in the
Arafat-led corrupted and mismanaged Palestinian Authority until Hamas
won a majority of the seats in the January, 2006 Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC) elections. The Bush and Olmert governments
wouldn't tolerate that outcome, and the New York Times reported right
after the election US and Israeli officials met at the &quot;highest level&quot;
to plan the destruction of Hamas by &quot;starving&quot; the PA and making the
people in the OPT pay the greatest price.

For Israel, this is part of its state policy of ethnic cleansing by
slow-motion genocide and out-migration all leading to the destruction
of the Palestinian identity. It wants to co-opt a corrupted PA
leadership of its choice to act as Israel's enforcer and partner in
the destruction of its own people. It's to fulfill the intent of what
former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meier meant by her racist comment
that &quot;There are no Palestinians&quot; and what Prime Minister David Ben
Gurion earlier said after Israel brutally expelled the Palestinians
from their homes and land in the 1948 war establishing the state of
Israel: &quot;We have come and we have stolen their country....We must do
everything to insure they (the Palestinians) never do return....(and 10
years earlier had written his son) We will expel the Arabs and take
their places....with the force at our disposal.&quot; He and his successors
planned to include all the land of biblical Eretz Israel (the land of
Israel) within the final fixed borders of a greater Israeli state
whenever they're finally declared. The US unconditionally supports
Israel's plan to do this as well as its policies of plunder and
exploitation, but as Petras explains: &quot;No one in their right mind can
claim that the Israeli assault on Gaza advances US policies, interests
or US imperial power.&quot; It doesn't matter because the power of the
Jewish Lobby got the full support of the Bush administration for it
anyway as well as the near unanimity for it in the Congress.

The Rape of Lebanon

What Israel did to the Palestinians in the OPT over decades, it did to
Lebanon in 1978, 1982 and in about a five week blitzkrieg beginning
July 12, ending formally but fragilely with a UN-brokered ceasefire on
August 14. Petras compares the assault to the Nazi's November 9 and
10, 1938 infamous Kristallnacht pogrom in the German Reich against the
Jews calling that event a &quot;garden party&quot; compared to the rape of
Lebanon and vast devastation from it. It began with Hezbollah's cross-
border incursion on July 12, killing eight IDF soldiers in the
exchange that followed and capturing two others. There's still a
dispute over which side of the Lebanese border the incident took place
as for years Israel routinely makes hostile incursions into Lebanon by
land and air, and still illegally occupies the 25 square kilometer
Shebaa Farms area of South Lebanon it never relinquished after seizing
it in the 1967 war.

As against Gaza, Israel again responded swiftly and disproportionately
in a reign of terror against the Lebanese people by land, air and sea.
It killed and wounded thousands and displaced a million or more
Lebanese civilians. It also systematically destroyed the country's
essential to life and other vital infrastructure and created an amount
of physical devastation that could take a generation to recover from
if Israel even allows it to happen. It was done in part to destroy
Hezbollah as a political entity and as an effective resistance force
against Israel's imperial designs on the country. But Israel's plans
are much more far-reaching than that as explained below.

Petras reported Middle East expert Juan Cole claims Israel wanted the
war and planned it at least a year in advance. Matthew Kallman of the
San Francisco Chronicle Foreign Service also found and reported
evidence that preparations for it began in May, 2000, immediately
after Israel ended its occupation of the country that began with its
invasion and brutal assault in 1982 that killed about 18,000 Lebanese.
Kallman also reported that over a year before the conflict began a
senior IDF official gave &quot;PowerPoint presentations&quot; off the record to
US and other officials and unnamed journalists and think tanks
explaining how the attack would unfold &quot;in revealing detail.&quot;

Again, Israel got the full backing, funding and arming as needed from
the Bush administration to carry it out, effectively making this
gruesome adventure a joint US-Israeli operation. Besides wanting to
neutralize Hezbollah's resistance, the goal was to destroy Lebanon as
a functioning country and ethnically cleanse the southern part of it
up to the Litani River Israel wants to control and eventually annex
and keep as it did the Golan after the 1967 war. Israel claims this
area (like the Golan) is important for security reasons, but its
greatest value (again like the Golan) is as a source of fresh water
from the Litani and from the Wazzani springs that feed into the
Hasbani River that's a tributary of the Jordan River. The Hisbani
flows into Israel two miles downstream from the Wazzani and runs into
the Sea of Galilee that's Israel's largest source of fresh water.

Israel has had designs on Lebanon for 40 years or more and has kept
the country in a state of instability, partial occupation and conflict
over most of that time. Now the state of the country is a devastated
near-wasteland monitored by so-called (Israel-approved and friendly)
UN Blue Helmets and Lebanese Armed Forces replacing the IDF on the
ground under a fragile UN brokered ceasefire arrangement that could
end any time Israel wishes again to unleash its war machine and on any
pretext. There's nothing to deter Israel from doing it as it has the
unconditional support of the Jewish Lobby and whatever US
administration is in power. Unless this changes, the people of
Lebanon, like those in Iraq and Palestine, can only look ahead to more
conflict and the pain and suffering from it.

That's because there's still unfinished business for both empires, and
it's not likely either one will soon give up on what they're
determined to achieve. So even though Iraq is a hopeless quagmire, the
Bush administration says it will &quot;stay the course.&quot; And as long as
Israel has full US backing, it will continue pursuing its imperial
agenda even though Hezbollah humiliated the IDF in Lebanon and the
Palestinians show no signs of ending their determined resistance short
of mass-annihilation or forced expulsion. But it's not all smooth
sailing as the unholy US-Israeli alliance faces a threat it can't
ignore that could derail it. It's a growing broad-based worldwide anti-
imperialist movement against these two partnered pariah states. It
remains to be seen how far it will go, whether it can achieve critical
mass in the US and in Israel, and if it can succeed in changing the
direction of these two belligerents so far unstoppable and determined
to go on unchecked by what passes for the civilized western world.

Part II - Israel and Middle East Warfare

It now looks like the only lesson the US and Israel learned from past
failure is to press on with a new adventure. It appears the likely
prime target is the Islamic Republic of Iran, as ill-advised as it
will be to attack it. Petras explains that &quot;Israel's political and
military leadership have repeatedly and openly declared (their
intention) to attack Iran in the immediate future.&quot; And once again it
looks like the power of the Jewish Lobby in the US has the Bush
administration thinking the same way to help its Israeli partner free
itself from another &quot;irritant&quot; in the region that stands in the way of
both countries' imperial aims. Petras calls Israel's Iran-directed war
preparations &quot;the greatest immediate threat to world peace and
political stability (today).&quot; It's hard to disagree.

That threat was heightened following North Korea's nuclear test which
Israeli officials were quick to jump on suggesting it will benefit
Iran. It came from an inflammatory statement by Miri Eisin, Prime
Minister Olmert's spokeswoman, who told the AP: &quot;We should remind
ourselves that the North Koreans have already been suppliers of
launching platforms which could reach Europe and certainly Israel. As
such, they have already shown their willingness to be suppliers to
Iran.&quot; Then Israel's UN Ambassador Dan Gillerman went further on
Israel's Channel 2 TV referencing North Korea's nuclear activity and
adding: &quot;what Iran is about to do could be much worse, much more
frightening and much more dangerous.&quot; This language practically
demands an attack on Iran to destroy its presumed &quot;nuclear threat&quot;
even though Iran is no threat to any country and the real threat is a
growing likelihood of an Israeli and/or US attack on Iran or any other
country in the region targeted as an enemy.

The US and Israel are allowed to get away with these kinds of
outrageously stark and provocative statements even though the only
pretext either country can fabricate is the baseless claim that Iran's
legitimate right to enrich uranium for commercial use means the
country has embarked on a nuclear weapons program that will threaten
Israel. In fact, Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT), and, from all the evidence uncovered from years of
monitoring by the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is in
full compliance with it. It has every legal right to pursue its
commercial nuclear program and nuclear enrichment for it. Israel, on
the other hand, never signed the treaty, is known to have two to three
hundred or more sophisticated nuclear weapons and launching systems
for them, has stated its intention to use them if it chooses to, and
is a nuclear outlaw - but one with an important ally the Iranians
lack.

Today the debate in Israel is only over the method and timing of
attacking Iran. Petras explains the Israelis have been pushing the US
to do it for over a decade with the power of the Jewish Lobby in full
support claiming the Islamic Republic threatens Israel's security and
its dominance in the region. It doesn't matter that Iran never
attacked its neighbors and isn't likely to undertake a military action
except in self-defense as it did against Iraq in the 1980s. Further,
it's an Israeli and made-in-America agitprop fabrication that Iranian
President Ahmadinejad threatened &quot;to wipe Israel off the map.&quot; The
president said a number of things including....&quot;this regime that is
occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time&quot; meaning an
illegal racist colonial one, but he didn't say or mean it should be
removed by force or that Jews should be expelled from Israel.

Further proof of Iran's intentions came from Grand Ayatollah
Khamenei's public pledge never to attack another country. He also
condemned the development and use of nuclear weapons as being against
Islam. The Western media was careful to suppress Khamenei's pledge and
instead published false reports that he threatened the US to heighten
the tension between the two countries. It's all part of the scheme to
get full US support for Israel's intended war plans and the long held
desire of both countries for regime change in Iran.

Petras lays out a dire scenario if a US, Israeli or joint attack is
launched. It will be especially bad if the US does it using so-called
&quot;mini-nuke robust earth penetrator bunker-buster&quot; munitions which are
weapons that can be made to any desired potency and are likely to be
from one-third to two-thirds as powerful as the Hiroshima bomb. In
other words, there's nothing &quot;mini&quot; about them. Aside from the
catastrophic level of immediate and long-term casualties from nuclear
annihilation and radiation in Iran and beyond, Petras explains such an
attack will only be a &quot;pyrrhic victory.&quot; If Israel does it alone, it
may set off a chain &quot;political conflagration (to) unseat the rulers of
Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia.&quot; If the US attacks, it &quot;would
be even worse: major oil wells burning, US troops in Iraq surrounded
(with the catastrophic consequences of far greater loss of life on
both sides), long-term relations with Arab regimes undermined and
increased oil prices (possibly high enough to cause a worldwide
economic calamity) and supplies disrupted.&quot; It's almost certain this
would inflame or enrage public opinion in the US and Israel that could
lead to the ouster of the ruling parties in both countries.

It would also likely undermine Big Oil's existing and desired major
oil exploration projects and cause the Israelis to crack down harder
on the Palestinians and make them face forced massive ethnic cleansing
expulsion from their homeland. Further, it would almost certainly get
a response from Hezbollah or other resistance in South Lebanon,
reignite the conflict there, unleash the Israeli killing machine all
over again and cause more mass displacement and reoccupation by the
IDF as the UN Blue Helmets and Lebanese forces evacuate the conflict
zone. And it would lead to a growing threat of retaliatory terror
attacks in the US, other Western countries and in Israel and would
likely strengthen the resolve of other nations feeling potentially
threatened by a hostile US, Israel and the West to seek defensive
economic and military alliances in a structure like the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO) that was formed in 2001 for political,
diplomatic, economic and security reasons to act as a counterweight to
NATO which the US dominates.

Still, with all the hazards of attacking Iran clearly in the minds of
US policy makers, the momentum for it is moving ahead. It's happening
in spite of serious high-level dispute in Washington about undertaking
it. The Pentagon has war plans for it to include NATO, Israel and
Canada, and it currently has a major US naval strike group deployment
in the Persian Gulf and Eastern Mediterranean. Part of it is
permanently stationed in the region, and in early October, The
powerful Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group got &quot;prepare to deploy&quot;
orders, headed there on October 3 and is now in place for whatever
action may be intended. It joins the Enterprise and Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Groups making a total of three US naval task
forces in position opposite Iran for whatever purpose may be planned
and will shortly be joined by a fourth Boxer Expeditionary Strike
Group that left Singapore on October 16 for the region. Naval forces
already there have been engaged in what the Iranian foreign ministry
calls &quot;dangerous and suspicious&quot; exercises in the Gulf practicing
intercepting and searching ships for potential WMDs and missiles.

This all may be just a saber-ratling bluff, but if it's more than that
it could unfold as a late October or early November &quot;surprise&quot; ahead
of the November 7 congressional elections now only days away and be
initiated in response to a manufactured incident on the order of the
August, 1964 Gulf of Tonkin one or the blowing up of the USS Maine in
February, 1898 in Havana Harbor. It's never hard for an aggressor to
find reasons for war if it wants one and just needs a convenient
excuse to start it.

The Bush administration and Israelis may get their wish if the Navy
goes ahead with its reported plans to blockade Iranian oil ports. This
action will be an act of war if it's done that Iran will have a legal
right to respond to in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter
but will surely be met with a &quot;shock and awe&quot; counterattack against
about 400 Iranian target sites already designated as ones to destroy
in the event of hostilities. None of this guarantees an attack is
imminent, but it shows a real possibility one may be coming. It also
shows the power of the Jewish Lobby in the US that supports Israel's
long-term aim to attack Iran no matter how grim the fallout from it
may be. There's so much open speculation about this, it's gotten saner
military, political and economic analysts here to believe this would
be an act of insanity with the kind of potentially catastrophic
consequences Petras outlined above. Will it happen? We can only hold
our breathe waiting to find out, but it may not be long before we do.

Part III - Experts on Terror or Terrorist Experts

In this part of his book, Petras goes head-to-head with the so-called
self-styled &quot;terrorist experts&quot; (TE) and clearly comes out ahead with
his incisive dissection of them explaining why they're prominently
featured in the major media. He calls them the &quot;set-up&quot; people - there
to play a role to &quot;motivate the colonial and imperial conquerors and
reinforce their idea that the terrorists are not worthy of ruling or
being ruled,&quot; so we have to get rid of them. It doesn't matter that
the so-called &quot;war on terrorism&quot; is a shameless overused but very
effective ruse scare tactic. It's always used because the public never
catches on no matter how many times before supposed threats turned out
to be another scam to get them to go along with whatever schemes our
government had in mind to undertake. It never ceases to amaze how
short an attention span the public has, but it's clear the power of
the corporate-run media has a lot to do with it. It led author Studs
Terkel to refer to a national Altzeimer's disease and author and
political critic Gore Vidal to subtitle his 2004 book Imperial America
- Reflections on the United States of Amnesia.

It gives the whole propaganda apparatus and the TE an open field to
manipulate the public mind and get it to believe most anything. Petras
calls these people &quot;verbal assassins&quot; who can't or won't understand
that people pummelled by &quot;shock and awe&quot; attacks, their countries
plundered in the name of &quot;liberation,&quot; their people mass-murdered,
raped, arrested and tortured might be desperate and motivated enough
to strike back in retaliatory self-defense. It follows logically from
Newton's law that for every action there's a corresponding reaction.
In 1954, the CIA understood this and invented a term for it (no self-
respecting TE will touch). The agency called it &quot;blowback&quot; referring
to the unintended consequences from US hostile acts abroad like
overthrowing legitimate or otherwise constituted governments as it did
against Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran in 1953 ushering in the 25 year
terror reign of the Shah. It finally led to the &quot;blowback&quot; 1979
revolution, and it causes other instances of retaliation now ongoing
in Iraq and Afghanistan and for nearly six decades in Palestine.

But prominent TE featured in the major media have a different
diagnosis of resistance fighters. They call them &quot;incurable
psychopaths (who are) extremely dangerous when at large (so we must
flush them out to) capture, confine, torture or kill (them).&quot; A
convenient division of labor is then arranged to do it and the TE play
their assigned role along with the military, recruited satraps, prison
commandants, interrogators, guards and assorted other functionaries.
They're team member hegemon-devil's disciples turning &quot;victims into
executioners and the executioners into victims.&quot; They do it by
dehumanizing the legitimate resistance they label Islamo-fascists,
Islamic fundamentalists, terrorists or other invented designations of
inferiority or implied threat that must be destroyed.

It's incomprehensible to the TE that almost any act of retaliatory
self-defense might be justifiable resistance given the level of state-
directed violence used against them mercilessly. In Israel, and now in
Iraq and Afghanistan it led to the phenomenon of suicide bombings
which Petras calls &quot;a form of individual sacrifice, of individual
resistance taken in the name of the collective.&quot; He explains further
that in the West individual sacrifice is rewarded with medals, but in
the Middle East and specifically in the case of suicide bombers the
reward is martyrdom for giving their lives in the cause of national
liberation against a superior hostile force. This is a phenomenon
common throughout history when a people face an overpowering conquerer
and occupier. Petras explains &quot;there have always been and always will
be self-sacrificing individuals or (whole populations)....prepared to
defend nation and home....and to use (their) body as a missile or weapon
(to do it).&quot;

Petras also explains there are different forms of imperial conquest
and subjugation, and the one the US uses in Iraq and Afghanistan and
that Israel uses against the Palestinians is a cruel and dehumanizing
&quot;process of destruction, degradation, and exploitation followed by
efforts to 'reconstruct' a colonized military, police, and political
structure willing and able to repress and contain anti-colonial
resistance.&quot; It's a doctrine of &quot;total war&quot; against target nations too
weak to fight back except by asymmetrical guerilla warfare means that
include tactics like car and suicide bombings. Petras calls this
practice &quot;one of the ultimate forms of rejection of tryanny&quot; that will
only end when &quot;total war&quot; does. And that will only happen when the
&quot;colonial revivalist strand of imperialism in....its US, European and
Israel variants&quot; are defeated....Peace and reconciliation is only
possible if justice is meted to the architects and practitioners of
total war and human degradation.&quot; A long and painful struggle for
liberation may be ahead before that goal is ever achieved.

Part IV - Noam Chomsky and the Pro-Israel Lobby

In the book's final part, Petras challenges a man who may best be
described as an iconic figure on the Left, an anti-war activist, and
much more but not one unused to being challenged and sometimes
harshly. Petras points out that Chomsky has been a sharp critic of
Israeli policies through the years and has been strongly attacked for
his views by pro-Israeli organizations and the major media on the rare
times his name is even allowed in it. Still he defends the existence
of the Zionist state and has a different view than Petras on the power
and influence of the Jewish Lobby in shaping US policy toward Israel.
Petras lists what he calls Chomsky's fifteen erroneous theses
reflecting his long-held belief that the Lobby isn't as potent as the
strong case Petras makes in this book that it is. Not wishing to take
sides with two distinguished men this writer holds in high esteem, the
points of disagreement will only be listed so the reader can decide
who makes the better case.

Petras begins by listing what he calls Chomsky's eight &quot;dubious
propositions:&quot;

1. The pro-Israel Lobby is like any other one.

2. The Lobby's backers have no more power than other pressure groups.

3. The Lobby succeeds because its interests coincide with those of the
US.

4. Israel is a tool of the US empire and used as needed.

5. &quot;Big Oil&quot; and the &quot;military-industrial complex&quot; are the major
forces shaping Middle East policy.

6. US and Israeli interests usually coincide.

7. The Iraq war and threats to Iran and Syria stem from the &quot;oil
interests&quot; and &quot;military-industrial complex.&quot;

8. US behavior in the Middle East is the same as what it practices
worldwide.

Petras then uses the above list to discuss what he calls Chomsky's 15
theses and uses the persuasive evidence presented in his book to take
issue with them, one by one. He sums up his case stating he's done
this because of Chomsky's enormous stature making whatever his views
are stand out prominently. It's a matter of consequence when a man
like Noam Chomsky believes the Jewish Lobby is like all others which
in Petras' view gives a &quot;free ride to the principal authors,
architects and lobbyists in favor of the (Iraq) war (and is an)
obstacle to achieving clarity about whom we are fighting and why. To
ignore the pro-Israel Lobby is (also) to allow it a free hand in
pushing for the invasion of Iran and Syria (and any other regime in
the region Israel may wish to remove).&quot; Petras sums up saying that
&quot;the peace and justice movements, at home and abroad, are bigger than
any individual or intellectual - no matter what their past
credentials.&quot; In this battle of noted titans on the Left, it's for the
reader to decide who's right.

Summation - Confronting Zionism and Reclaiming American Middle East
Policy

Petras has written a powerful and important new book that needs broad
exposure and resonance. But he'll never get its content past the
corporate gatekeepers controlling the major media because of his
courage to reveal what others fear to do - confront Zionism, its
agenda of aggressive wars and colonization, and the power of the
Jewish Lobby to assure Israel gets the full and unconditional support
of every US administration regardless of whether what it does serves
the interests of this country. That Lobby power reached its apogee and
full fruition with the ascent of the Bush administration neocons that
effectively pledge their fealty to the rulers of the Israeli state and
prove Ariel Sharon may have been right when he once arrogantly boasted
about his relationship with George Bush saying: &quot;We have the US under
our control.&quot;

The result has been disastrous for this country and the sacred
principles on which it was founded. In partnership with Israel, the US
began tearing apart the Middle East and Central Asia by attacking and
occupying Iraq and Afghanistan. It now threatens to inflame the whole
region enough to make it explode if we go ahead with plans to attack
Iran, do it with nuclear weapons, and then move on to Syria and even
Saudi Arabia while continuing to hold Lebanon hostage and under siege
in a state of interregnum awaiting the next inevitable trigger
igniting the whole ugly business there all over again. The Bush
administration &quot;long war&quot; against Islam enraged 1.8 billion Muslims
worldwide growing in unity against us. It's also destroying our
freedom and democracy at home in the process threatening everyone with
the emerging power of a national security police state that spells
tyranny with an out-of-control president usurping the dictatorial
power of a &quot;unitary executive&quot; claiming the right to go around the law
of the land and its international obligations to govern as he
pleases.

Petras sounds the alarm and asks how did we get into this debacle, and
who's responsible for it. He stresses the need for a full-scale
Congressional investigation to find out, but laments it's not likely
to happen as long as the Bush neocons have their way. The central
thesis of his book is that the Jewish Lobby serves the interests of
Zionism and acts as agents for the state of Israel. It co-opted the
Bush administration, all others preceding it, and the key centers of
power and influence in the country leading us to the disaster we now
face because of our misguided Middle East adventurism. He equates our
actions in league with Israel to the Nazi war crimes committed in WW
II, saying &quot;These are the highest crimes against humanity.&quot; Referring
to the crime of aggression, the Nuremberg Tribunal called it the
&quot;supreme international crime,&quot; and those Nazis found guilty of it were
hanged. Petras explains that the &quot;worst crimes are committed by those
who claim to be a divinely chosen people, a people with 'righteous'
claims of supreme victimhood.&quot; He goes on to say: &quot;Righteous
victimology, linked to ethno-religious loyalties and directed by
fanatical civilian militarists with advanced weaponry, is the greatest
threat to world peace and humanity.&quot;

Petras makes an impassioned plea for progressives (really all people
of conscience) to reject the imperial agenda of all nations, and in
the case of Israel, to stand firm against inevitably being labelled
anti-semitic. Scurrilous name-calling is another refuge of scoundrels
that shouldn't be tolerated or allowed to deter our committed assault
against the forces of darkness that will destroy us unless we stand
firmly against them. Petras tells us it won't be easy, and we can
expect forceful ideological attacks against us premised on the notion
that Israel is the embodiment of &quot;democracy, liberty and justice&quot; and
those daring to criticize the Jewish state will be called supporters
of &quot;Arab dictatorships, repression, injustice and terrorism.&quot;

The stakes are much too high to let them get away with it using
scurrilous name-calling in defense of it. In Petras' words: &quot;Israel
and its overseas network in the US....(threatens) not only the oppressed
people of Palestine (and Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Syria and any other
state Israel takes aim at) but the rights of people throughout the
world.&quot; He stresses we have mass public opinion on our side nearly
everywhere outside the US, and it's gaining resonance here as well. It
sees Israel and our actions in support of the Jewish state as the
greatest of all threats to world peace and stability. Petras ends his
book with one final impassioned call to arms: &quot;Let's move ahead and de-
colonize our country, our minds and politics as a first step in
reconstituting a democratic republic, free of entangling colonial and
neo-imperial alliances.&quot; Wise thoughts from a wise and courageous man.
We can't ignore them lest we pay the supreme price of the loss of our
freedom (and maybe our lives) because we didn't know it was being
taken from us until it was too late to act to save it.
