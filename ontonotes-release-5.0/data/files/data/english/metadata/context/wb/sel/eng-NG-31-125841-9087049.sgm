I thought I'd post this here as this more of a techy group.  I have a
question about capacitors.  I need to replace all the caps in a 40
year old amp, but it appears that some of the values are no longer
available, for example 20uF or 25uF.  Is it ok to use the nearest
available values?  Also, I have a list of all the capacitors needed,
but some say MMFD instead of MFD.  Also, is there a conversion chart
online to convert pF, nF &amp; uF as all the readings I've got are in uF?
I've read some marvelous threads on this NG about vintage telly
techniques, so I though maybe some would know about vintage
capacitors.

Round them up to the nearest larger figure Marky. Most electrolytic
capacitors have a very wide tolerance value!..

Where are you buying them from?...

All of them? Why do you think you need to replace all of them?

What you are saying sounds a bit like &quot;I need to replace all the nuts
and bolts in my car because I think one of them is a bit loose and I
don't know which one&quot;.

Even if you have established that a particular capacitor is actually
faulty, how accurate the replacement value needs to be will depend on
what that capacitor was doing in the circuit. Some of them will be in
feedback or tone control circuits, so messing about with their values
could have quite a big effect on the sound. Others (the big ones
mostly) will be decoupling power supply rails, so although their exact
capacitance values may not be so important, their voltage rating and
ripple current ratings will be.

1pF (picofarad) = 1F*10^-12
1nF (nanofarad) = 1F*10^-9
1uF (microfarad) = 1F*10^-6 (Should really be a Greek &quot;mu&quot; symbol, but
often written as &quot;u&quot;).
MMFD = old way of writing &quot;micromicrofarad&quot; = &quot;picofarad&quot;.

Good luck, but don't come running to me if it doesn't work afterwards.

Rod.

I wondered how you were getting on with that Wurlitzer.
http://www.electronics2000.co.uk/calc/convcap.htm

The low voltage electrolytics in a valve amp would typically
be cathode decoupling and, if I have remembered my
theory correctly, when these dry up they effectively
increase negative feedback and this can actually improve
sound quality at the expense of some gain (volume).

Have you got the amp working yet? I would be surprised
if you didn't have some 50Hz hum. If so you need to
attend to the large HT filter capacitors, sometimes they
are a &quot;block&quot; with two or more values in a common
package.
The non-electroylitic capacitors will probebly, in the
main, be OK,  but you might have the odd anode - grid
coupler leaky, but you might need to do a little fault-
finding to locate them.

&gt; For most things using the nearest equivalent should be OK. It's very
&gt; unlikely that any value is too critical -- electrolytics in particular
&gt; can have a very wide tolerance (sometimes as large as 15-20%).

&gt;&gt;  Also, I have a list of all the capacitors needed,
&gt;&gt; but some say MMFD instead of MFD.  Also, is there a conversion chart
&gt;&gt; online to convert pF, nF &amp; uF as all the readings I've got are in uF?

&gt; 1000pF = 1nF
&gt; 1000nF = 1µF (uF)
&gt; 1000µF = 1mF
&gt; 1000mF = 1F
">

All good advice. Electrolytic caps intended for DC blocking or power supply
filtering are often -20% +100% tolerance - a nominal 100 uF capacitor could
be anything from 80 to 200 uF before it starts aging...

I'm sure you'll be very careful, Marky. 40 years old = valves = dangerous
voltages.

The electrolytic caps (over 1 uF) may well have all gone bad and I'd change
those first, making sure to match the polarities. The others may be OK. If
you start on those, as an example 0.047 uF = 47 nF = 47000 pF. For all of
them, make sure you get high enough voltage ratings (not so easy since
modern equipment mostly uses much lower voltages).

Best of luck.

Rod, those of us who work with old valve equipment have learned the hard
way that practically all consumer grade waxed paper capacitors from
the 1950s leak. It's very difficult to test them because they often only
leak at high voltages and usually must be removed from the circuit for
testing. Multiple leaky caps can produce all sorts of strange symptoms, so
it's standard practice to replace *all* wax caps of 1nF or larger as the
first step in a restoration unless they are of a type known to last well.

The bit that everyone has missed - the voltage rating. It is VITAL that
any electrolytic capacitors are of the same or higher voltage rating
especially for big values or high voltages.

At high voltages the actual capacity does not matter so much. Many
canned types were 32+16uF or 16+16uF at 450V. If you cannot get a
32+16uF then fit a 16+16uF - it will make little or no difference.

At lower voltages if you are looking at 3300uF 50V and all you can get
is 4700uF 63V or 100V, if it will mechanically fit then use it. In
semiconductor equipment dropping below the capacitance value might cause
hum or - in the case of an amp - result in early onset clipping at high
volumes. If the old unit has a surge current rating printed on the case,
make sure the replacement has similar or better rating.

Modern capacitors are significantly physically smaller than those of
even 20 or even 10 years ago, so don't be surprised if your replacements
present you with mounting problems. Most importantly if you are
replacing signal capacitors that are small electrolytics do your best to
get comparable types - specifically try to avoid replacing electrolytic
with tantalum. If you cannot get the exact value go for the next value
higher both in capacity and voltage.

True for the smaller values (the nF and pF ones for coupling, tuning, etc.);
however, for the electrolytics, modern switched-mode power supplies mean
that there are plenty of 400V or more ones in, say, old PC power supplies.
(_Do_ be careful though! Especially if the PC power supply is itself at all
suspect. Also, though it may not be the case now, there used to be some
sharp edges inside the PSU, it being the part the average punter wasn't
expected to go inside, unlike the rest of the PC.) I rejuvenated an old
gramophone - yes, valved; my blind friend had been fond of it, it had chunky
controls and could play 78s - which had got very hummy, by re-using some
cap.s out of a PC PSU. (Actually they were _so_ much higher in capacitance
than the originals that I worried a bit about the inrush current through the
rectifier diode, but it seemed to survive, at least the year or two until
the whole thing did get thrown out and replaced with a little deck Maplins
were doing, which she now uses to transcribe things through her computer.)

And from me.

If it _is_ valve gear you're repairing, and you get into it, do visit Gerry
the museum in Dulwich if you're ever in London and have the time (two or
three hours for the museum at least, but unfortunately it's not easy to get
to so you need to add something for that too.)

Kits? Luxury!

I had some Clive Sinclair books of circuits published by Bernard Babani.
I had to take the bus to Shude Hill buy the components, stop off at
Woolworths
for a soap box to build them into.

The cleverest radio design that I remember from those days (I think it was
one of Clives) was basically a crystal set tuned to the Light Programme from
Droitwich, arranged so the rectified carrier powered the other part of the
set, which was a tunable MW transistor receiver. No battery required.

Because I was told that with an amp of this vintage, the chances are
all the caps will need replacing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What you are saying sounds a bit like &quot;I need to replace all the nuts

&gt;don't know which one&quot;.

&gt;Even if you have established that a particular capacitor is actually
&gt;faulty, how accurate the replacement value needs to be will depend on
&gt;what that capacitor was doing in the circuit. Some of them will be in
&gt;feedback or tone control circuits, so messing about with their values
&gt;could have quite a big effect on the sound. Others (the big ones
&gt;mostly) will be decoupling power supply rails, so although their exact
&gt;capacitance values may not be so important, their voltage rating and
&gt;ripple current ratings will be.

&gt;1pF (picofarad) = 1F*10^-12
&gt;1nF (nanofarad) = 1F*10^-9
&gt;1uF (microfarad) = 1F*10^-6 (Should really be a Greek &quot;mu&quot; symbol, but
&gt;often written as &quot;u&quot;).
&gt;MMFD = old way of writing &quot;micromicrofarad&quot; = &quot;picofarad&quot;.

&gt;Good luck, but don't come running to me if it doesn't work afterwards.

This is my jukebox amp BTW.  It buzzes badly in one channel and

&gt;I wondered how you were getting on with that Wurlitzer.
&gt; http://www.electronics2000.co.uk/calc/convcap.htm

&gt;The low voltage electrolytics in a valve amp would typically
&gt;be cathode decoupling and, if I have remembered my
&gt;theory correctly, when these dry up they effectively
&gt;increase negative feedback and this can actually improve
&gt;sound quality at the expense of some gain (volume).

&gt;Have you got the amp working yet? I would be surprised
&gt;if you didn't have some 50Hz hum. If so you need to
&gt;attend to the large HT filter capacitors, sometimes they
&gt;are a &quot;block&quot; with two or more values in a common
&gt;package.
&gt;The non-electroylitic capacitors will probebly, in the
&gt;main, be OK,  but you might have the odd anode - grid
&gt;coupler leaky, but you might need to do a little fault-
&gt;finding to locate them.
">

When I got the unit home, I plugged it in and it worked, but there is
a severe hum in one channel, and a slight hum in the other.  Also, the
channel with the loudest hum is also quieter (music wise), if that
makes sense.  The actual sound quality is quite acceptable, thoughthe
dealer I bought it off did say replacing the caps would improve it.  I
am currently running the Jukebox with an extrenal Leak amp (as i've
mentioned before) but I think the Wurlitzer amp sounds better.

The fact is that practically all wax caps will be leaky. NOS ones leak
too, so it's nothing to do with use. If you wanted to replace only the bad
ones it would be a matter of identifying the few good ones that *didn't*
need replacing. The good ones would in turn become leaky with the passage
of time.

There aren't all that many caps in typical old devices. An old radio or
push-pull amplifier will have fewer than 10. I accept your point about
clueless capacitor replacement, and even experienced restorers make the
occasional wiring error, but if you can't change old caps you're probably
not competent to attempt the restoration.

I hope this wasn't a crack at my post? My reference to 1nF (0.001uF,
1000pF) was correct. Caps smaller than this are usually mica or ceramic
and don't become leaky, so don't need replacement.

Don't be too radical when restoring this jukebox, for one thing
it will lose authenticity if you put in lots of modern parts.

Stereo amps have one distinct advantage over other equipment,
you have another identical channel to make comparisons with

I doubt that. Perhaps one of the first to be well thought of by
the critics. In those days you were either a Quad or a Leak
man. Before that, transistor amplifiers has a reputation for
producing tinny sound, that was rubbish of course, it was
just that the designers took the opportunity of putting miniaturised
electronics into miniature cabinets with speakers to match.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Also, I have a list of all the capacitors needed,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chart
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; online to convert pF, nF &amp; uF as all the readings I've got are in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uF?

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1000pF = 1nF
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1000nF = 1µF (uF)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1000µF = 1mF
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1000mF = 1F

&gt;&gt;Though the mF is relatively rare, and certainly relatively recent as a
&gt;&gt;unit;
&gt;&gt;it was generally avoided until recently because manufacturers (in
&gt;&gt;common
&gt;&gt;with a lot of people) INSISTED ON DOING EVERYTHING IN CAPITALS (AND
&gt;&gt;ALSO
&gt;&gt;WOULDN'T HAVE _ANYTHING_ TO DO WITH THOSE FOREIGN GREEK SYMBOLS), SO
&gt;&gt;YOU GOT
&gt;&gt;M USED FOR MICRO, so m for milli didn't appear. Yes, as someone else
&gt;&gt;has
&gt;&gt;said, MM is probably micromicro, or pico. (Also, nano tended not to be
&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;common - especially in US-based stuff - before a certain date. A site
&gt;&gt;with
&gt;&gt;some good notes in it - though some terrible bits too - is
&gt;&gt; http://www.uoguelph.ca/~antoon/gadgets/caps/caps.html .)

&gt; It's an american built amplifier.  It has a step down transformer to
&gt; convert from 230v - 110v.

That's an interesting point which might also affect hum. Is the
transformer a step down to 110V on a single wind, or is the secondary
actually 55-0-55 as with power tool transformers. If so then that will
certainly contribute to hum as you will effectively have an earthing
'hum-loop,'

&gt;&gt;&gt; I had a little kit made by Clive Sinclair.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill

&gt;&gt; No you didn't. He supplied the kit but you made it.

&gt; No he made the kit, in the sense of assembling parts sourced from
&gt; various places, writing the instructions, and putting it all in a box.
&gt; I made the finished product using the kit. But before I did that I had
&gt; the kit.

&gt;&gt; Did you ever get it working?
&gt; Yes. I built it into a beautiful polished wooden case which had housed
&gt; an ITV converter! I then painted the box purple! I'm sorry, but I was
&gt; only a young lad and no responsible adult stepped in. I used that amp
&gt; for the left channel and a prewar radio for the right channel, via the
&gt; gram input. The Sinclair sounded far better than the valve amp but it
&gt; wasn't anything like as loud. I bought two 8&quot; coaxial speakers from
&gt; Wharfdale and mounted them in 12&quot; concrete pipes.

Ah, a man after my own heart.

Longer ago than I care to remember a mate put two Lowther drivers into
6&quot; sewer pipes about four feet long and fiiled the pipe with long fibre
wool. Quality - and bass - like I had never heard. I bought a couple of
Peerless 8&quot; drivers about a decade later with the intent of doing the
same - I think the drivers are still in a box in the loft somewhere,
hermetically sealed of course!

Bought a pair of Transmission Lines a few years later - now that WAS
bass, could rattle windows at 20 paces! Unfortunately after living with
them for over 20 years Management decided they were too big and they had
to go about 10 years back. Ever seen a grown man cry.........?

One of my earliest &quot;hi-fi&quot; memories is of dad painting our own drainpipe
speaker. It stood in the corner of the living room (glorious monophony).
It also had a Wharfdale driver, 8&quot; IIRC, and the 'grille' was a black
cotton bag with a drawstring behind the magnet. Inexplicably, he painted
it with light grey gloss paint.

&gt;&gt; &gt; All of them? Why do you think you need to replace all of them?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; What you are saying sounds a bit like &quot;I need to replace all the nuts
&gt;&gt; &gt; and bolts in my car because I think one of them is a bit loose and I
&gt;&gt; &gt; don't know which one&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Rod, those of us who work with old valve equipment have learned the hard
&gt;&gt; way that practically all consumer grade waxed paper capacitors from
&gt;&gt; the 1950s leak. It's very difficult to test them because they often only
&gt;&gt; leak at high voltages and usually must be removed from the circuit for
&gt;&gt; testing. Multiple leaky caps can produce all sorts of strange symptoms, so
&gt;&gt; it's standard practice to replace *all* wax caps of 1nF or larger as the
&gt;&gt; first step in a restoration unless they are of a type known to last well.

&gt;If you say so, but it still sounds a bit drastic to me. I guess I'm just
&gt;old-fashioned, having been educated in the school of thought that believes
&gt;that repair consists of identifying and replacing the components that are
&gt;actually faulty and leaving the rest alone. I would never replace components
&gt;preemptively unless the consequences of not doing so were worse, but the
&gt;preemptive replacement of *all* the capacitors in an amplifier would be a
&gt;huge undertaking, and in old equipment would stand a good chance of
&gt;disturbing something else and causing more trouble than it cured, especially
&gt;if you don't know the difference between a microfarad and a nanofarad.

&gt;Rod.

With older stuff sometimes resistors drift in value electros are always
worth replacing and some makes of Capacitor very much so!, especially
polythene which ages over a long period. Its not removing authenticity
at all.

I refurbed a QUAD 33/303 for the wife a couple if years ago, new caps in
the power amp some sealed cermet trimmers and beefed up a couple of bits
of wire. It was some 28 years old then and I reckon it will be good for
another 20 or more!....
