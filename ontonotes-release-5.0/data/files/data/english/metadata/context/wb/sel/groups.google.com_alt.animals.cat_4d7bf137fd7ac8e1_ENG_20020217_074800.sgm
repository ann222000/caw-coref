My wife hates that one of our Persian cats &quot;Critter&quot; is using the couch as a
scratching post. She wants to declaw him. I am against declawing because of
the obvious reasons. I he has a scratching post nearby and I do try to get
him to use it but he still manages to upset my wife by using her couch now
and then. Please help Critter keep his claws. Jim

Jim....

Please see my reply to Darlene, her subject was &quot;Declawing my cat?&quot; I
included a few links for her, and some alternatives to declawing.

Lots of luck to you and the fur boy!

"/> Well you could leave your wife.... ;-)

Seriously, scratching is usually about two things, fettling the claws
and leaving scent. I suspect the FAB have some information on this,
they are at  www.fabcats.org . They are a UK-based organisation and there
is *no* declawing in the UK, but I think they still address cats clawing
things. Hopefully they have some useful advice on getting your cat to
use the scratching post.

i'm wondering what the 'obvious' reasons are?
if this is an outdoor cat i understand. if this is an indoor cat there is
no reason why declawing wouldn't be a good alternative.

Even though Critter is strictly an indoor cat, there are any number of
reasons that the cat could find himself in a threatening situation, which,
obviously, he would need to defend himself with his claws. What if he
somehow got out of the house? What if a playful toddler tried to carry poor
Critter by the neck? No one can possibly keep constant vigil on a
defenseless animal in a world full of dangers. Just because a cat is
strictly indoors doesn't mean the environment will be completely innocuous
all the time. I don't believe there is any reason to amputate a cat's
digits. I have not had any problems with my kitties using their claws for
evil since training them properly. Cats are intelligent and learn quickly.
Declawing is a lazy way out, and just cruel.

Bob, can we please keep the name-calling to a minimum? Yes, people who are
ignorant can be infuriating, but we are all here, I believe, bc we love
cats, and wish to share info and learn from each other. Remember that

"/> IMHO if you feel you can't live with your cat *and* her claws you should
find her a home which can. Or get rid of your wife. Declawing is a
nasty operation, like snipping off the end joints of your fingers. It's
not like having a finger nail removed which leaves the bones intact.

Well, I don't very often come into contact with people who &quot;promote cat
mutilation and dismemberment,&quot; but every once in a while I do encounter
people who have never been educated in the matter of declawing, and all of
its ramifications. I just use common sense and speak with the person with
respect and courtesy and enlighten them to the facts. People usually
respond favorably to this approach.

Name-calling reveals the fact that the name-caller has not fully matured
with regard to his/her language and emotional development, and must resort

bob you are clearly an idiot! mutilation and dismemberment are words used
for one reason only ... to generate hysteria.
i suppose having your appendix removed before it causes you a problem is
mutilation in your view! how about neutering? isn't that mutilation and
dismemberment bob?
you're an ass with no brain. if declawing was cruel mutilation vets
wouldn't do it .. period! the fact is declawing for an indoor cat (and i'm
talking about responsible people, not dicks who might abandon their pets) is
good for the all around life of everyone concerned, including the cat.
so climb down that really high horse you're trying to ride bob, not that a
fall would hurt that numbed skull of yours.

because your cats clawed it? what if he claws a friend who's a bleeder and
sues your ass off?
if he got out? .... defend himself? against what? a car?, some ass (not

just because you loved the movie 'born free' doesn't mean everyone else who

"/> that's what sets me off about this clown. his whole shtick is to humiliate
and brow beat anyone who isn't up to his idea of perfection.
he probably has a book full of those pithy little rejoinders. otherwise he
wouldn't have much to say.

in any event, before anyone else gets bent out of shape because of my belief
about declawing, let me elaborate my position. 1st, i wouldn't recommend
declawing for anyone who wasn't 'committed to keeping their cats strictly
indoors, or safe from other animals. i wouldn't recommend it for older cats
except for certain circumstances (such as ... &quot;the cat gets declawed or the
cat gets put down&quot;). older cats have a hard time recuperating from the
procedure (not the 'mutilation', which term is used only to enflame
passions).
however if the choice is made to declaw it can be done with little or NO
pain to the kitten and with seldom any long term problems. to back up my
claim i include a part of this article .......

@@@@ &quot;Declawing is not painful for cats, when performed at a young age,&quot;
said Dr. Kent Stauffer, a clinical instructor with Mississippi State
University's College of Veterinary Medicine. &quot;It is not traumatic for them
and it does not affect their behavior as is often said.&quot;
&quot;Younger cats heal much faster, that is why it is preferable to declaw cats
that are 1 year old or less. They also recover their normal mobility
quickly,&quot; Stauffer said. &quot;Older cats could suffer a little pain and the
healing process is slower.&quot; @@@@

....... i'm not suggesting declawing should be taken lightly. but to take
the position that it is wrong under ANY circumstances is in my opinion
unenlightened. if you point out to me that the uk has made it illegal, i
will point out that unless you're willing to adopt all of the uk's laws and
pitch ours, it doesn't matter! i have no problem with those who would never
declaw a cat for any reason. grant ME the right to make that decision for
myself without damning me for it.

i'll leave you with one last portion of a scholarly article on the subject
........

@@@@ &quot;Owners have several alternatives to keep their sanity, their cats and
their living room furniture. Perhaps the most obvious option is declawing,
where the cat's nails and nail beds are surgically removed. Part of the bone
gets taken off so the nail will not grow back. Generally, only the front set
of claws are removed since the cats do the most damage with them. However,
for cats with particularly destructive behavior, both front and back sets

Veterinarians suggests that the earlier, within reason, that owners get
their indoor cats declawed, the better for their cats. K-State recommends
declawing at four to six months of age because it's less traumatic on the
cat and the cat can adapt better. The older the cat, the more trauma
associated with the procedure.&quot; @@@@

&gt;&gt; My wife hates that one of our Persian cats &quot;Critter&quot; is using the couch as
&gt; a
&gt;&gt; scratching post. She wants to declaw him. I am against declawing because
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; the obvious reasons.

"/> My advice, dump the wife, keep the cat.

Seriously, living beings are more important than furniture, and yes, if you're
going to get into such an uproar about your furniture, maybe the pet for you is
really a pet rock. The reason why this is different from altering your cat is
that this is something that will not improve the cats life. Unlike humans cats
are under a compulsion to mate, they do not decide that they'd like to have
kittens and take the appropriate steps. It's quite miserable for the female cat
to be unspayed. Once they go into heat, they stay in heat until they breed, this
is very difficult for them as being in heat=a lot of stress. Also, it's not very
healthy for a female cat to bear one litter after another. It wears them out,
just as it would for a human who was almost constantly pregnant.
As someone else said, declawing actually is equivalent to having your finger
amputated to the first knuckle.

I guess ultimately, if it's either declaw the cat, or get rid of it--even then
it might simiply be better to find a kind, reliable new owner, but I say this
because there are enough cats who all ready need rescue adding another doesn't
help--, then declaw it, but declawing should be the absolute last resort. I
believe there are some kind of sheaths you can put over the cat's claws that
will allow them to carrying on with their natural scratching behavior, actually
for scent marking as well as simple claw sharpening, without hurting furniture.
These should be available either through your vet, the local pet supply place,
or I say them in a catalogue--the one with two Drs.-- not long agoEven before
this I would try training the cat not to claw the sofa, for instance you see it
getting ready to claw spray if with water from a squirt bottle, or a small water
pistol--the supersoaker is probably overkill--and/or clap your hands and say no
kitty. This is how I got my cat to quit scratching the stereo speakers. Whatever
you do, do not remove the back claws, these are the &quot;heavy artillery&quot;--you'll be
aware of this if your cat is like mine and traps your hand, then attempts to
disembowel it.

Peace,
Danielle

"/> as to the 2 siamese .... no doubt there are poor surgeries done from time
to time by vets just as there are by people doctors. it's sad but a fact of
life. my kittens had no problems with their recovery

as to the removal of fingers ....i don't thing it's fair to make a
comparison of cats/humans. cats don't make those comparisons when they're
older that us humans would. the hands and manipulation of the human finger
is one of the 2 great things that separates him from animals. granted cats
are considered very dexterous with their paws, but in truth it's a very
relative statement. remove a humans fingertips and you'll no doubt ruin his
life. remove a cats claws and the cat is STILL dexterous and there is no
effect whatsoever (this all assumes, of course, he's kept indoors). my 2
persians (whom i love as much as my own kids) still do all the same things a
clawed cat will, including picking up objects with their paws. they still
climb all over everything and are not barred from anyplace they wish to go
in our fairly large house (one jumping in my lap as i type this).
also i think the evidence i provided in my earlier post regarding it's
effect on the cats health speaks for itself. if i thought it would have a
lifelong debilitating effect on them i wouldn't do it. and i witness the
proof of this every day. mine are as healthy and happy as any cats could be
(even at the age of 4 &amp; 5 they are as kitten like as can be).

your post ... &quot; It should be illegal for a vet to do this to a cat,(as in
the UK), for no reason other than &quot;he might scratch my furniture&quot;.&quot;

well, i disagree ... my vet (a fairly renowned local vet) also disagrees.
he DID insist on a discussion as to my reasons and commitment to them but
once he was satisfied about me he had no problem doing the procedure.
and 'furniture scratching' is not the only reason to declaw a cat, tho i
believe it is a legitimate one. in my case, i'm very tactile with my cats,
and i know of very few cats who can play long without using their claws (tho
i did own one once ... he got to keep his). i have a bad reaction to being
clawed. they don't mean it i know, but nevertheless it's a problem that if i
couldn't deal with would mean 2 more cats in the world without an owner.
even their back claws can cause me a problem when, as i'm sure many of you
know, one moment their on your lap and the next they 'launch' themselves to
whatever grabs their attention. fortunately this is much rarer.

the perfect world would be nice where there was no pain, no need for
compromises, and love abounded, but the last i looked ... that DOESN'T
describe THIS world. and that's the problem i have with so many 'cat
lovers'. they throw realism out the window with comments like, 'if you
can't live with a clawed cat you shouldn't have one!' well, i happen to
believe the end result to cats in realistic terms would be a greater
population with fewer owners and more euthanized cats than ever.

i WANT cats! i am mesmerized by them, and devoted to my own. real cat
lovers should recognize there's more ways than just theirs to live with
them.

ps. .......... &quot;24 fully clawed little paws&quot; do you mean 6 cats? or do you
actually mean 24?

you can not show it afterwards. I have NEVER declawed a cat, I buy scrap carpets
and attach thin rope to it and hang it on the door handles. Works very good.

I have been watching this conversation and it is horrible. Why is everyone
so angry? Is it possible to state facts and views without name calling? We
speak of declawing as being a form of amputation. Using the same definition
spaying and neutering is the same thing. Every owner has a right to decide
what is best for them AND the animal. They should first do research. I
have neutered my cats because I know I do not want to worry about how their
kittens WOULD be treated after giving them away. I would not be able to
afford to take care of more than two. Knowing all of those things and
researching that process I made my decision to neuter. It has been the best
thing for me AND my babies (Season and Story...cats).

Declawing has a lot of drawbacks. I am personally against it. There are
several options available to prevent this surgery. My vet is against it as
well BUT will do the procedure. Whoever stated that because Vets do it, it
must be okay need to read more and educate themselves. One option I do not
think was mentioned was soft paws. I have never tried this before but I
will be trying it soon. Their web address is  http://www.softpaws.com  If
you are unable to get to it by the link then take out the www.

Scratching posts take training. Maybe sprinkling cat nip on them will draw
you cat to them to stretch out and scratch.

I have had my babies for almost four years now and it is a continuous
learning experience. They understand NO when used firmly. After telling
them know I place them near the scratching post, gently push in their paws
so their nails will extend then I stroke their arms in a scratching motion
on the scratching post. When they are using the scratching post I do not
look at them because I don't want them to question whether they are doing
wrong. Only when they are scratching something bad do I use the technique
above. It can be tiresome but you have to be consistent. They are
scratching bad things less and less.

Protecting your furniture with plastic is another way. You may take it off
daily. This becomes an exasperating ritual but cleaning out their litter
once or twice a day can be too. This is the price you pay for being animal
lovers.

One more idea I will share without turning this into a book is possibly
keeping them in one part of your house when you are not home (providing you
are never home).

Again, we are all here to learn so no matter how strongly you feel about an
issue, be courteous and understanding. If you share what you know freely
and invitingly you will open eyes to people that are unaware. The object
should be education. Don't make people feel uncomfortable.

I hope I have not offended anyone with this post. I hope to not receive any
name calling from it. Have a pleasant weekend and enjoy life.

well bobby ... the discussion is over ... points have been made ... evidence
has been presented .. and no one is going to change your mind or mine.
the only purpose i see for you restating YOUR beliefs is you have no where
else to go with your argument. you've presented NO evidence other than
hearsay and you obviously don't intend to so it appears you're simply taking
the opportunity to bash and insult for the sake of itself.
you're a small man with a small mind and no longer worth talking to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Using the same definition

"/> I have never heard the word 'amputation' used to describe hysterectomies
in women.

IMHO there are a few fundamental differences between neutering (the
generic term in the UK - females are spayed, males are castrated) which
are:

1) A cat usually recovers from neutering in a day or two - the
males I have had done were fine once the anaesthetic had worn of, so was
the last female I had done. The vet managed to do her through a 1cm
incision! AFAIK it takes cats some time to recover from declawing as
there is more healing to do and their balance is affected until they
learn to compensate.

2) Neutered cats are proved to live longer than entires - there is
no proof that declawing extends the natural life of a cat. Unneutered
females who do not get mated keep calling and many of them loose a lot
of weight. Nearly all un-neutered males spray foul-smelling urine round
their house. If allowed out they are likely to wander far from home, to
have RTAs and to get in fights with other male cats. In some areas they
are also likely to pick up some nasty diseases from fighting and sex.
There also seems to be some evidence that declawed cats are more likely
to develop behavioural problems than those with claws.

People in nearly every county except the US manage very nicely without
declawing cats - I do wonder why the US is so different. Happily you
cannot get a cat declawed in the UK.

An argument used in favour of declawing is that 'the cat would be thrown
on the streets otherwise'. Well forgive me if this is wrong, but AFAIK
there are fair numbers of declawed cats in shelters in the US. Being
the cynic I am I reckon there are very few people who in reality won't
find some other reason to reject the cat, if they would have because it
is damaging the furniture. Think of all the lame excuses people use to
leave their partners - getting one of them surgically fixed doesn't
(usually) stop them carrying on to use another one.

I live with 76 cat claws (if that' what 4*18 is). My cats go out a bit
which helps as they use tree trunks for some of the necessary claw
stropping. They also have a splendid scratching post which I thought
expensive at £50 but which has turned out to be worth many times that
for the fun of watching the cats attack it! As to the rest of the
furniture, they attack the carpets at times but otherwise I tend to get
items which either don't matter (cheap &amp; can be thrown out) of which are
not attractive to them, or not as attractive as the scratching post.

Cats *need* to scratch. They do it to sharpen their claws (claws grow
like onions and I often find the 'empty husks' round the house), to help
stretch their muscles and to scent mark. All these things are natural
and necessary on a daily basis to a cat, and it's a pity they don't all
come with a label tied round their neck saying so. OTOH neutered cats
live very happily without sex.

"/> That's a common strawman, and I'm getting sick of people using that as
an excuse for mangling their pets. Here's several differences:

1.) It is possible to teach cats to use a scratching post instead of the
furniture. It is not possible to train a cat not to go into heat or
spray.

2.) An unspayed female cat is at high risk for developing mammary
tumors. Having claws presents no health risk to the cat.

3.) Spaying and neutering are moderately painful; recovery is usually
quick, and complications are rare. Declawing is extremely painful;
recovery tends to be long, and complications are common.

4.) The ultimate aim of spaying and neutering is population control;
this prevents stress and suffering for living creatures. The ultimate
aim of declawing is to serve human vanity by protecting inanimate
objects.

5.) The aim of spaying and neutering cannot be achieved by any other
practical method. The aim of declawing can be more easily and cheaply
attained by other methods.

6.) A spayed or neutered cat is usually quieter, calmer, and more at
peace than one not so treated; they tend to become more affectionate. A
declawed cat is usually more anxious, fearful, and agitated than one
which still has its claws; they tend to become more aggressive.

Think of it this way: Humans, who supposedly have the intelligence
and foresight to think ahead as to whether they can support children,
have clearly displayed an unwillingness to make use of that wisdom, and
are rapidly breeding ourselves off the planet. I am personally familiar
with a number of people who - despite having the knowledge, the right,
and the means to prevent it - have children they did not plan on and
cannot properly care for. If we cannot control our own reproduction as
a species, what hope is there that we can teach kitty to 'just say no?'
OTOH it is very easy to teach a cat to claw something besides the sofa.

fill it. The debacle of the US 'war on drugs' has demonstrated that
while it is easy to pin blame on the supplier, trying to choke off
supply is fruitless and causes far too much collateral damage. History
has proven countless times that you cannot decree or legislate something
out of existence. Reducing demand is a slower, more difficult, and much
less dramatic process; naturally it appeals little to crusaders. What
is required is a process of education, not legislation; evolution, not
revolution.

You might start by getting your facts straight. The truth about
declawing is damning enough, there is no need to make up false
accusations or unsupported generalizations.

ALL schools of veterinarian medicine around the world will teach their
student vets how to declaw a cat. While not common, the need to remove
a damaged claw is far from unusual.

I would not expect them to promote or condone elective declawing
because that breaches the oath I'm told all vets take on entering
training. It is to the shame of the profession that so many of its
members go on to preform elective declawing which has no benefit for
the cat.

&gt;&gt;Sorry Bob, but you are simply wrong here. Please recall that I actually
&gt;&gt;attended a US veterinary school, I think I have a pretty good idea what
&gt;&gt;they do and do not teach. Declawing is not taught in US veterinary
&gt;&gt;schools; the technique (actually techniques) may be mentioned in
&gt;&gt;textbooks, but it is never taught in either a classroom or clinical
&gt;&gt;setting. Ask about declawing at Tufts and you will get a stare of
&gt;&gt;withering disapproval - if you're lucky.

&gt; So they turn out vets to practice techniques they have never even seen
&gt; performed? Strange way to teach vets isn't it?

removal, and a limb amputation, and a chest tube placement, and an

Graduates are 'familiar' with any number of treatments and may see many
performed, but it is expected that they will truly learn by doing in the

are not under the delusion that it is possible to thoroughly teach
everything in four short years.

&gt; ALL schools of veterinarian medicine around the world will teach their

This isn't a question of opinion, or what we'd like to be true or

all you like, but you will not change reality.

At Tufts declawing is not even mentioned in class, and certainly not
done in the clinics. Again, recall that I was there; you were not.
That one example alone belies your claim that &quot;ALL schools of
veterinarian medicine around the world will teach their student vets how
to declaw a cat. Having talked to literally hundreds of students from
other schools, my information is that other schools have the same
practice.

You could do some research by calling vet schools or checking the
syllabi in their libraries, or contacting other American vets to get
their input. For the moment you are making assertions in the absence of
knowledge and contrary to objective fact - also known as lying. This
does not help your credibility, and thereby damages the cause which you
are trying to promote. Given that, do you really wish to persist in
your accusations?

And quite frankly, I don't know why it's so important to you to push
this untruth; if anything, I'd think you would be happy to know that the

You do not live in the United States; I do. You have never set foot on
the campus of a US veterinary school; I attended and graduated from one,
and have visited at least 7 others. As far as I have been able to
determine they DO NOT teach declawing, any more than they teach ear
cropping. Period.

Unlike you, I don't expect people to simply take my word for it; I have
taken the liberty of dragging your nasty ass over to AVM since we have
some actual vets who can provide supporting or refuting testimony.
Please behave yourself, since not everyone here is as sweet tempered as
I am. :) If they say their vet schools teach declawing, I will stand

People have been debating exactly *WHY* Cats 'claw' for eons, but from thirty

years of personal experience, i can assure you of one thing: they do it

much more frequently when their claws get 'overgrown' = which is more

likely to happen to an &quot;Indoor&quot; Cat ...

SO ... Learn how to keep your kitty's nails trimmed properly.

The next most likely cause is 'Territorial' .... Spaying; then providing

a deep-pile rug fragment [ like a 'Welcome' Mat ] sprinkled with catnip

should direct kitty's attention in an acceptable direction.

PS = i'm disappointed in the overall tone of this thread.
&quot;TALECTOMY&quot; is a horribly mutilating procedure which i now know
NO Cat should be subjected to ...

To Whoever said all Cats should be allowed outdoors: you may come to learn
that not all Cats *want* to go out --- my oldest cat [ 20 yrs old ] only
goes out in warm weather, and even then only sits on the porch ...

&gt;&gt;year each do a cruciate repair, and an intestinal resection, and a tumor
&gt;&gt;removal, and a limb amputation, and a chest tube placement, and an
&gt;&gt;emergency tracheotomy, etc. etc. etc.

&gt; Yes. In the course of six years of training I would expect most
&gt; students to at least see most of those procedures performed at least
&gt; once.

"/> It's four years in the US. That's another FACT you've gotten wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It's just not practical.
&gt;&gt;Graduates are 'familiar' with any number of treatments and may see many
&gt;&gt;performed, but it is expected that they will truly learn by doing in the
&gt;&gt;field - hopefully under the supervision of an older and wiser doc. We
&gt;&gt;are not under the delusion that it is possible to thoroughly teach
&gt;&gt;everything in four short years.

&gt; Then stop trying - in the UK it is a SIX year course.

"/> In the US it's four (4) years. The FACT that you are obviously unaware
of this difference in practice suggests you have no idea what the hell
you're talking about. Certainly it indicates you do not have enough
information to make the sweeping generalizations you have made.

This reflects a difference in educational philosophy. UK schools
approach veterinary education as a form of technical training - each
thing a vet is expected to know or do must be specifically and directly
taught, and proficiency must be specifically shown. US schools try to
teach general principles with specific instruction in the most commonly
encountered situations, with then expectation that students will learn
to apply these to new situations after graduation. There are advantages
and weaknesses to both approaches.

Again, however, you are obviously clueless to the FACT that this
difference exists.

*sigh*

Why waste valuable time and space arguing with Bob? He obviously knows
everything about cats, and everything taught in every vet school in the
world. Don't you know by now that he is the leading authority on all matters
feline? It's simply a waste of time trying to get him to admit he could be
*gasp!* wrong about something. It just won't happen.

And, did you know he can converse with cats? It's true! He knows that my
indoor only cats are terribly unhappy, and feel I am abusing them. Amazing
isn't it? I was impressed.

Now, I am against declawing, especially when the owner is just too darn lazy
to try anything else, and I do hope that what you say is true....that vet
schools are no longer teaching the procedure, but I kind of find it hard to
believe. For instance, what happens when it becomes a necessity to remove
one or more claws for the cats health? I'm not trying to goad you into an
argument, just curious about it.

for male cats. The ones I have had neutered all seem to head for the

be a bit of bewilderment the first time the wash 'down there' after the
op though!

With female cats I only have experience of two - one had had a litter of
kittens which were 6-7 weeks old, and she was clearly sore for a day
after which she carried right on feeding the kittens.

The second was about 5 months old, and had had almost keyhole surgery -
her incision was about 1 cm (just under 1/2 inch) long with a few
subcutaneous stitches. She behaved as if nothing had happened which I
put down to the skill of the vet.

However, as you say, almost all cats are over being neutered in a day or
less which is a very short timescale.

US vet schools do not teach it at all; this is consistent with what I've

&gt; argument, just curious about it.

"/>  As mentioned in the part Mr. B. conveniently ignored, we have a
different educational approach in 'the Colonies.' Namely, vet students
are taught the basic principles of surgery and a selection of specific
procedures (mostly covered in class, not actually performed), with the
expectation that they will be able to apply these to a wide variety of
procedures even if the specific procedure has not been taught. If you
know the anatomy and what you're trying to accomplish, you can follow
any good surgery text much like someone who 'knows how to cook' can
follow a recipe they've never tried. (Sorry if that sounds horrid, but
it's the best analogy I can think of.)
All the basic elements of surgery are involved in a 'routine' spay,
which students must actually perform at least twice before graduation.
Obviously more technically complex procedures - such as cruciate repair
- must be learned directly from an experienced surgeon; this usually
happens in practice, after graduation. There is no legal barrier to any
vet taking on any surgery he or she feels like - but common sense,
consideration for patients, and legions of trial lawyers are generally
sufficient to keep vets from trying something they're not really up to.
Specifically as to declawing, the frequency of 'medical' declawing is
nowhere near what Bob would have you believe. Once upon a time it was
relatively common to 'therapeutically' declaw a cat in cases of infected
nail beds and certain other conditions; these cases are usually treated
now with medication. When it is necessary, the procedure is decribed in
standard surgery texts, or is done by experienced vets who already know
what they're doing. In any event it rarely goes anything like a
cosmetic declawing because you usually have infected and swollen tissues
to deal with.
It *is* relatively common to remove an entire toe, usually because of
tumors; this is a somewhat different procedure in the sense that the
incision is much larger, a different joint is involved, and usually only
one toe is amputated. The pattern of complications alone is
significantly different.

The general pattern in this part of the US is that most large clinics
still do declawing, but in many cases it is only the owner and one or
two senior associates who actually do the surgery. The majority of new
graduates will not do declaw surgeries, so in about 10-15 years when the
olf fogies retire it will be much harder to find a place which will do
the deed. That's certainly a long time to wait (especially for cats)
but this has happened without a resolution from the AVMA, without
specific legislation, and without a single corporate chain (AFAIK)
having the balls to remove declawing from their list of options as a
matter of policy. In a way it's something of an accomplishment, albeit
a quiet one.

Hope that answers your question.

Most larger clinics have a single owner but several other vets work
there - they are called associates, as distinguished from owners or
partners; veterinary partnerships also exist but are somewhat rarer.
Most corporate practices are simply existing clinics which have been
bought out, and frequently the previous owner will stay on as the
'senior' veterinary employee or some such title.
There is a general but not direct correlation between how long
someone's been in practice (i.e., how long ago they went to school) and
how likely they are to do declawing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The majority of new
&gt;&gt;graduates will not do declaw surgeries,

&gt; Well they've not been taught to do them, but they really won't look them
&gt; up in a book?

"/> Usually they're familiar enough with the basic principles involved, and
can look up the details, but those inclined to learn usually do so under
the direction of a more experienced vet. It is extremely rare nowadays
for someone to start a new solo practice right out of school, so finding
a teacher is usually not difficult. Some owners even try to insist that
new associates learn cosmetic surgeries because the clinic does them
routinely, but the law is quite clear that a vet doesn't have to do any
procedure they feel is unwarranted. Telling he boss that can be a bit
dicey though...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I saw one on TV and reckon it looked a very easy piece of

"/> It happens, but not as much as you might think. The problem is that
many new graduates don't feel comfortable speaking out and actively
educating clients because they work in clinics which do declawing and
'company policy' is that the surgery is acceptable. It's considered bad
manners to contradict what your boss has been telling clients for 20
years, not to mention bad for your long-term career prospects.

My good friend Bob brings up yet another Reason why it's not a good idea

to subject kitty to a 'talectomy' [ de-clawing ] :

With the exception of the geriatric Cat, your Kitty will *still* want to

to go outdoors even 'after' being de-clawed... but sending a de-clawed,

defenseless-even-to-climb-a-tree-to-escape Kitty outside is practically

a Death Sentence.

[ The Cat-stuck-in-a-Tree Image is familiar to everyone;

but *WHY* do you think the Cat went up there in the first place ??

Most likely to escape from some Danger --- which a de-clawed cat can't

do !! ]

Bottom Line :

** DON'T DECLAW YOUR KITTY !!! **
