We're thinking we should have an end-of-the-world party to celebrate.
Halloween seems like as good a time as any! But what kind of party
favors and cake and invitations would fit this theme? Suggestions?

A NASCAR theme with a ceremonial burial-of-the-car at the end of it all?

Too funny!

Have all your neighbors bring their big screen TV's instead
of a food dish.

If you haven't got good Aussie shiraz or California cab,
maybe go directly to &quot;End of World,&quot; do not pass go, do
not renew your satellite/cable.

Well, I guess it's time to trade in the SUV for one of these:

I'm not inclined to think of it as being all that &quot;snappy&quot;, but if
gas cost $10/gallon that 72mpg might seem really attractive.

You probably don't want to be going around turns at its top speed!

My favorite attribute is the opimistic

&quot;room for 4 adult passengers&quot;

coupled with

&quot;load capacity 550 pounds.&quot;

Sad to say,  you'd have to pick your 4 adults carefully in the US if
you wanted to stay under 550 pounds!

I can imagine it going over on it's lid making an avoidance manuever
at 15 MPH.
Braking while turning into your driveway?
THUNK!
&quot;There's a dog in the road! Everybody lean left!&quot;
I'd love to see video of it on the road.

Remember that that 550 probably includes gas.
&quot;Net weight 706&quot;
&quot;Gross weight 1206&quot;
Hmmm...
God forbid one of your passengers has a big head,
then it *would* go over!
I mean, if it *leaned* like a motorcycle that would be a whole
'nother deal, but it doesn't look like it could, as tight as the rear
wheels are to the body.
We won't even go into what might result if one were &quot;T-boned&quot;
by a GMC Sierra.

That Wild Fire is certainly cute and a good idea - for people who live
in town.  I think it'd probably be rather dangerous to get from where
