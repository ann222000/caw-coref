Does anyone wonder where the Tom Hayden-Jane Fonda SDS radicals went? The
ones who chanted &quot;Hey, hey LBJ how many kids did you kill today?&quot; and
cheered on the Communists in Vietnam, and went into the streets to demand
America's withdrawal from Vietnam and became suddenly silent when our troops
were pulled and the Communists proceeded to slaughter two-and-a half million
Cambodians and Vietnamese? Well today they are the heart and soul of the
Democratic Party, calling for a capitulation in the war in Iraq and
referring to George Bush as Hitler, or perhaps merely suggesting that his
mentality is fascist, while insisting and that America's war in Iraq is a
mask for conquest and imperial goals.

These aging New Lefties are also busy digging graves for the Jews in the
Middle East by pretending that the genocidal Muslims in the Palestinian
territories are really victims and that they only express genocidal desires
because they're frustrated and reduced to desperation by American and
Israeli power. The lefties I'm referring to are grouped around magazines
like the Nation and the American Prospect and websites like Daily Kos and
Common Dreams; their organizations are among the netroots and Democratic
Party caucuses like the &quot;Campaign for America's Future,&quot; which are mandatory
stations on the road to the White House for the current crop of Democratic
presidential candidates.

These observations are provoked by an email I received from one of their
number, a political piranha with intellectual pretensions named Rick
Perlstein. His email read: &quot;Couldn't find your jihad vid on YouTube as
promised in your email today. What's the YouTube URL? - RP&quot; Of course I knew
who Rick Perlstein was, and the lack of a hello in his email or any modicum
of civility, which even a political opponent could be expected to muster,
might have caused a less generous fellow than I can sometimes be to ignore
the communication or just tell him to get lost. After all, on past occasions
he had attacked me pretty viciously, and this email was not a response to
anything I had actually written but to an e-newsletter that my staff had put
out which bore my signature.

But that is not the way I deal with people. Instead of treating him
according to his deserts, I did what I usually do in such cases and let the
insulting style float by me while responding thus:

&quot;Dear Rick, I'm not sure which of our three videos you're referring to. You
can access all three at www.terrorismawareness.org ....&quot;

To which he replied: &quot;Your e-newsletter says 'What Every American Needs to
Know About Jihad' is on YouTube, which I'd like to embed on my site.&quot;

By this time I had a pretty good idea that whatever he was going to do with
the video was not going to be pleasant, but I went along with the program
anyway: &quot;I'm happy to be collaborating on something with you. I'll have to
pass this question on to my technical people.&quot;

Perlstein did &quot;embed&quot; the video (which can be accessed here) on his website
along with this commentary:

David Horowitz writes me a letter
By Rick Perlstein on August 15, 2007 - 12:57pm.

( http://commonsense.ourfuture.org/david_horowitz_writes_me_letter )

The right's preeminent shrieking harpy-no, not Ann Coulter; even worse than
Ann Coulter-importunes me with an &quot;e-newsletter&quot; about the latest goings-on
at his David Horowitz Freedom Center. A tidbit that caught my eye:

One strong measurement of the effect we're having (and the need for what we
do) came in the form of request from the head the FBI-California Highway
Patrol Joint Counter-terrorism Task Force who called this week to ask if
their group could use our flash video 'What Every American Needs to Know
About Jihad' as a training film.

See What Every American Needs to Know About Jihad for yourself, and let the
California Highway Patrol know if you think this is productive use of their
officers' time, and a useful contribution to California's public safety
[...]

So Perlstein's reason for posting the video was not to help us alert
Americans to the fact that the jihadists are planning their destruction
(which is the gist of our production) but to organize a campaign of other
leftists to pressure the Joint Counter-terrorism Task Force not to use the
video as a training film.

Reading Perlstein's post and the comments that followed was revealing. I am
the author of a book called Unholy Alliance: Radical Islam and the American
Left, which explains how the hatred of many American leftists towards their
own country and their fellow citizens (whom they regard as little Eichmanns
and agents of the Great Satan) has led them into an unholy alliance with
religious zealots who want to destroy us (and of course them along with us).
Yet, even though I have explained this at great length, I continually find
myself unprepared for the level and intensity of that hatred. While I knew
Perlstein was up to something, I did not really suspect that he would
consider this little video to be the menace rather than its subject. (And
Perlstein is a moderate!)

Consider these comments on Perlstein's &quot;Campaign for America's Future,&quot;
website. This is an audience, remember, which Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama
and the other Democrats who might be president think it is necessary to woo:

&quot;Now David Horowitz seems to be trying to fill the shoes of both Goebbels
and Leni Riefenstahl.. Bragging that the JTTF is using his 'film' is like
bragging that the Nazi's are buying his Swastika's. The JTTF has a track
record that marks it as a political unit designed to target Bush
Administration opponents - Citizen Steve.&quot;

Is this who Rick Perlstein is hanging out with? People who think the CHP and
the FBI are the Nazi Party?

Here's one from someone who,

&quot;Wrote the CHP:

&quot;I looked at the video, and it is, indeed, right wing garbage. I then
clicked on the link for the CHP, and filled out the form for a citizen
complaint. As a California resident, I am deeply concerned that the CHP
would even consider using such garbage as a training film. There's no
'training' in the film whatsoever, only hysteria raising.&quot;

farbie

And here's one from one of the many leftists who were on the wrong side in
the Cold War:

&quot;New Graphics, Old Schtick (sic)

&quot;hot damn! substitute the word 'communist' and you have a classic 1950's
'global domination' classroom propaganda flick.

&quot;every day, the corporo-military right gets more desperate and determined to
keep the cattle 'on message.'&quot;

And then there's this:

Jihadists in Chicago and Los Angeles!!!
Aug 15th, 2007 by oldmancoyote

Rick Perlstein notes that the California Highway Patrol, apparently, are
interested in using it as a training video. I'm not sure what the training
would be for other than profiling muslims.

Posted in Conservative Craziness, PR

In other words, it's hysteria to regard as dangerous the jihadists who have
carried out 9,000 terrorist attacks since 9/11, who have sworn our
destruction, who could very well possess biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons, who want to die so they can get to heaven, who believe in the mass
slaughter of innocents, and who have active allies across this country. That
's to be a &quot;shrieking harpy,&quot; a Gobbels incarnate, a right-wing
corporo-military fascist, and of course an Islamophobic racist. On the other
hand to be Rick Perlstein, a never-learn- never-say-you're sorry leftist, is
to regard David Horowitz and his video as the enemy and the fanatical
Islamists as greatly over-rated and misunderstood.

I will with the help of the Internet around the world to get the
message about the absolute truth known about the American Turkish
Council and its direct connection to Bay Point School and how the
Mossad tried many times to kill and harm the American Patriot Jeff
Fisher but failed because he was blessed by Martin Luther king Jr. in
1967.

New American Policy under the Gore/McKinney/Fisher/Kucinich/Paul
Administration

Please read and contact me ASAP.

I love your blog. The people are so beautiful.

This is very real and this is the headline.

New American Policy under the
Gore/McKinney/Fisher/Kucinich/Paul Administration

These are my children. I am a man of peace and I will not
allow this to happen. I am a direct descendant of Jesus Christ.

No more bulldozing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!

The world needs to start screaming for AL Gore
and Jeff Fisher to free Palestine and end the war
that  is a lie and was planned at BayPoint
School in Miami Florida.

The miracle is in Washington DC

Israel and Palestine have a right to exist...Read my peace plan that
the American Arab Institute endorsed in 2003.

The Mossad hated it and has tried to kill me a few times.

The Iraqi Embassy in 2006 on September 11th
reviewed the truce plan and stated that
specific plan would create stability and peace
throughout the entire region.

Signed,

Because, the boycotters say, ¡§Israel¡¦s 40-year occupation has seriously
damaged the fabric of Palestinian society through annexation, illegal
settlement, collective punishment and restriction of movement,¡¨ that there
exists a ¡§complicity of Israeli academia in the occupation.¡¨
The British lecturers excoriated Israel because, as one of their complaints
went, Palestinian students were inconvenienced by security checkpoints as
they carried their books to school each morning. the ¡§sanctity¡¨ of the
college setting was forgotten when Palestinian Authority forces, believing
it was being used as a staging area for Hamas rocket launches, stormed the
17,000-student Islamic University in Gaza. The entire campus was set
ablaze -- destroying books in its library, gutting offices, classrooms and
the student center.

Apparently the concept of academic freedom had to be revoked here, since
virtually every leading figure of Hamas has taught or studied at Islamic
University.

Israel Judge Promotes Her Court As a Model

Strike Breaking
STRIKE BREAKING (AS REPORTED BY NYT AND OTHER AMERICAN PAPERS)

THE JERUSALEM POST CORRESPONDENT HIRSH GOODMAN  ¡V they have not received
any
terrorist training, nor are they members of a terrorist organization. Rather
they are
members of that Palestinian generation that grew up knowing nothing but
occupation

With anger, hatred, and sheer ferocity, thousands of youngsters hurled rocks
at their Israeli occupiers, undaunted by the gunfire that greeted them. This
was more than civil unrest. ...It was the beginning of a civil rebellion -
Dan Fisher, Los Angeles Times, December 20, 1987.
On that day, - wrote John Kifner in The New York Times, - the vast army of
Arab laborers who wait on tables, pick vegetables, haul garbage, lay brick
and perform virtually all Israel's menial work, stayed home.: John Kifner,
New York Times, December 22, 1987.

The Israeli response to the uprising was brutal. Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin ordered the use of tanks, armored vehicles and automatic rifles
against an unarmed population.

The San Francisco Examiner cited Rabin as openly advocating assassination.
&quot;They can shoot to hit leaders of disorder,&quot; Rabin said in defense of the
army's practice of using marksmen with high-powered .22-caliber rifles to
shoot indiscriminately at Palestinian youth. - San Francisco Examiner,
December 23, 1987.

Rabin ordered house-to-house searches, first for young men and later for
anyone of whom an example might be made. By December 27, over 2,500
Palestinians were seized, many of them as young as twelve; by the end of
January the number reached 4,000 and was rising.  The &quot;militants &quot;were
marked for deportation. Israeli high-security jails and detention centers
were overflowing. Mass trials of Palestinians were underway.

The act of brutality which most inflamed the Palestinian population was the
army seizure of the wounded from hospital beds. This practice, standard
procedure throughout the invasion of Lebanon in 1982, made Shifa Hospital in
Gaza a center of resistance. Great crowds amassed to defend the wounded,
whom, they rightfully feared, would never be seen again.

No fear of Jews standing up against cruelty and sadism as the Christians DID
again and again.

more effective than detention ... [because] he may then resume stoning

No matter which house one calls, the anguished accounts of family members
wounded or arrested pour forth. Convoys of buses cruise the streets of
Nablus followed by vans of the Mossad, Israel's secret police. Army units go
from house to house pulling youths from their beds at 3 a.m. As the buses
fill, the soldiers beat the youths viciously around the head, shins, groin
and back. Shrieks fill the air.

AGAINST AN UNARMED CIVILIAN POPULATION.

By April 1988 over 150 Palestinians had died. The Israeli government had
admitted to the arrest of 2,000 people, bringing the acknowledged total to
4,000. The real figure was far higher.

Sources in the West Bank and Gaza established that the number detained by
the weekend of March 27 had exceeded 13,000. Bassam Shaka'a, deposed Mayor
of Nablus, placed the total held solely in a hastily constructed barbed-wire
encampment at Dhariyah at 10,000.

In the Balata camp outside Nablus, and in the Casbah - the old quarter -
l, 000 people were arrested in a period of 48 hours. The discovery of people
in ditches in the fields - shot in the back or with their heads caved in -
has been reported from villages throughout the West Bank and Gaza

TWO OF THE CHILDREN, AGES 9 AND 11 , WERE TAKEN BY THE SOLDIERS IN THEIR
night clothes, frog-marched in the streets and beaten as they were forced by
the jeering soldiers to clear debris.

NEW YORK TIMES
Fleets of helicopters fly over Nablus at night dropping a dense, green toxic
gas over the city. The smell pervades every house. Armed units fire
canisters of the substance into houses at random. Doctors at Ittihad
Hospital reported several deaths and severe lung injuries from this as-yet
unidentified asphyxiating chemical, totally distinct from tear gas.

Among the victims was the grandmother of the Da'as family and the
100-year-old father of noted Nablus attorney Mohammad Irshaid. Soldiers had
entered the house at 2 a.m., smashing furniture and firing a canister of the
dreaded green gas while preventing the family from leaving.

Simultaneously, the Israeli army targeted the hospitals. Army trucks rammed
ambulances and blocked them from reaching the homes of those overcome by the
gas. Soldiers entered the Ittihad Hospital in Nablus numerous times,
arresting the wounded and those waiting to give blood to family members.
EVEN THE OPERATING THEATRE WAS INVADED WHILE SURGEONS WERE OPERATING ON
PATIENTS.

DOCTORS WERE BEATEN AND EQUIPMENT SMASHED. FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PREVENTED
FROM ENTERING THE HOSPITAL AND THE CARS OF DOCTORS AND NURSES WERE DESTROYED
BY SOLDIERS.

Meanwhile, all of Nablus was paralysed by a total strike. All the streets in
every quarter of the city were without open shops or business activity. As
gas permeated the city, cries and chants filled the night.

Gas canisters recovered by Bassam Shaka'a, Yousef al-Masri [chief of Ittihad
Hospital] and American author Alfred Lilienthal bear the markings &quot;560 cs.

properties as casualties mount.

JOHN KIFNER reported on April 4 that &quot;Hundreds of refugees were treated in
United Nations clinics for gas inhalation.&quot; On April 15, Kifner wrote,
&quot;...gas has been thrown inside homes, clinics and schools where the effects
are particularly severe.&quot;

Article Winston Churchill wrote in 1920:
&quot;This movement amongst the Jews (the Russian Revolution) is not new.
From the days of Spartacus Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, and down
to Trotsky (Russia), Bela Kuhn (Hungary), Rosa Luxembourg (Germany)
and Emma Goldman (United States), this world wide conspiracy for the
overthrow of civilization and the reconstruction of society on the
basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible
equality, has been steadily growing. It played, as a modern writer,
Mrs. Nesta Webster, has so ably shown, a definitely recognizable part
in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of
every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century; and now at
last this band of extraordinary personalities has gripped the Russian
people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the
undisputed masters of that enormous empire. There is no need to
exaggerate the part played in the creation of Bolshevism and in the
actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by these international
and for the most part atheistic Jews. Moreover, the principal
inspiration and driving power comes from Jewish leaders.&quot; (ibid)

Lev Trotzky wrote a book called &quot;Stalin: An Appraisal of the Man and
His Influence&quot;, Harper Bros., New York and London, 1941, translated by
Charles Malamuth.
In this book he told who the principle members of the October Central
Committee were. This group was the leadership of the Bolshevik Party
during the October Revolution. This is what he wrote:
&quot;In view of the Party's semi-legality the names of persons elected by
secret ballot were not announced at the Congress, with the exception
of the four who had received the largest number of votes. Lenin--133
out of a possible 134,  Zinoviev--132,  Kamenev--131,  Trotzky--131.&quot;
Of these four top leaders of the Bolshevik Party the last three were
known Jews. Lenin was thought to be a gentile married to a Jewess. It
was later proven that he was one quarter Jewish, London Jewish
Chronicle April 21, 1995, Lenin: Life and Legacy.
David Francis, the American Ambassador to Russia at the time of the

&quot;The Bolshevic leaders here, most of whom are Jews and 90 percent of
whom are returned exiles, care little for Russia or any other country
but are internationalists and they are trying to start a world-wide
revolution.&quot;
The Director of British Intelligence to the U.S. Secretary of State
wrote this:
&quot;There is now definite evidence that Bolshevism is an international
movement controlled by Jews.&quot;
In 1945 the FBI arrested six individuals for stealing 1700 highly
confidential documents from State Department files. This was the
Amerasia case they were:
Philip Jaffe, a Russian Jew who came to the U.S. in 1905. He was at
one time the editor of the communist paper &quot;Labor Defense&quot; and the
ringleader of the group arrested.
Andrew Roth, a Jew.
Mark Gayn, a Jew, changed his name from Julius Ginsberg.
John Service, a gentile.
Emmanuel Larsen, nationality unknown
Kate Mitchel, nationality unknown.
In 1949 the Jewess Judith Coplin was caught passing classified
documents from Justice Department files to a Russian agent.
The highest ranking communist brought to trial in the U.S. was Gerhart
Eisler. He was a Jew. He was the secret boss of the Communist Party
in the U.S. and commuted regularly between the U.S. and Russia.
In 1950 there was the &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot; case. Ten leading film writers
of the Hollywood Film Colony were convicted for contempt of Congress
and sentenced to prison. Nine of the ten were Jews. Six of the ten
were communist party members and the other four were flagrantly
pro-communist.
One of the top new stories of 1949 was the trial of Eugene Dennis and
the Convicted Eleven. This group comprised the National Secretariat of
the American Communist Party. Six were Jews, two gentiles, three
nationality unknown.
Also in 1949 the German-born atomic scientist Klaus Fuchs was
convicted for passing atomic secrets to the Russians. Acting on
information obtained from Fuchs the FBI arrested nine other members of
the ring. All of them were convicted. Eight of the nine were Jews.
Here are some quotes from a very pro-Jewish book that was first
published in 1925. The book is &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; by Lewis
Browne.
&quot;But save for such exceptions, the Jews who led or participated in the
heroic efforts to remold the world of the last century, were neither
Reform or Orthodox. Indeed, they were often not professing Jews at
all.
&quot;For instance, there was Heinrich Heine and Ludwig Borne, both
unfaltering champions of freedom. And even more conspicuously, there
was Karl Marx, one of the great prophetic geniuses of modern times.
&quot;Jewish historians rarely mention the name of this man, Karl Marx,
though in his life and spirit he was far truer to the mission of
Israel than most of those who were forever talking of it. He was born
in Germany in 1818, and belonged to an old rabbinic family. He was not
himself reared as a Jew, however, but while still a child was baptized
a Christian by his father. Yet the rebel soul of the Jew flamed in him
throughout his days, for he was always a 'troubler' in Europe.&quot;

&quot;Then, of course, there are Ludwig Borne and Heinrich Heine, two  men
who by their merciless wit and sarcasm became leaders among the
revolutionary writers. Karl Marx, Ferdinand Lassalle, Johann Jacoby,
Gabriel Riesser, Adolphe Cremieux, Signora Nathan- all these of Jewish
lineage played important roles in the struggle that went throughout
Europe in this period. Wherever the war for human liberty was being
waged, whether in France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Italy, there
the Jew was to be found. It was little wonder that the enemies of
social progress, the monarchists and the Churchmen, came to speak of
the whole liberal movement as nothing but a Jewish plot.&quot;
The book &quot;Soviet Russia and the Jews&quot; by Gregor Aronson and published
by the American Jewish League Against Communism, quotes Stalin in an
interview in 1931 with the Jewish Telegraph Agency. Stalin said:
&quot;...Communists cannot be anything but outspoken enemies of
Anti-Semitism. We fight anti-Semites by the strongest methods in the
Soviet Union. Active anti-Semites are punished by death under the
law.&quot;
The following quotes are taken directly from documents available from
the
U.S. Archives:
State Department document 861.00/1757 sent May 2, 1918 by U.S. consul
general in Moscow, Summers: &quot;Jews prominent in local Soviet
government, anti-Jewish feeling growing among population....&quot;
State Department document 861.00/2205 was sent from Vladivostok on
July 5, 1918 by U.S. consul Caldwell: &quot;Fifty percent of Soviet
government in each town consists of Jews of the worst type.&quot;
From the Headquarters of the American Expeditionary Forces, Siberia on
March 1, 1919, comes this telegram from Omsk by Chief of Staff, Capt.
Montgomey Shuyler: &quot;It is probably unwise to say this loudly in the
United States but the Bolshevik movement is and has been since it's
beginning, guided and controlled by Russian Jews of the greasiest
type&quot; type.&quot;
A second Schuyler telegram, dated June 9, 1919 from Vladivostok,
reports on the make-up of the presiding Soviet government: &quot;...(T)here
were 384 'commissars' including 2 negroes, 13 Russians, 15 Chinamen,
22 Armenians, AND MORE THAN 300 JEWS. Of the latter number, 264 had
come to Russia from the United States since the downfall of the
Imperial Government.
The Netherlands' ambassador in Russia, Oudendyke, confirmed this:
&quot;Unless Bolshevism is nipped in the bud immediately, it is bound to
spread in one form or another over Europe and the whole world as it is
organized and worked by Jews who have no nationality, and whose one
object is to destroy for their own ends the existing order of things.&quot;
&quot;The Bolshevik revolution in Russia was the work of Jewish brains, of
Jewish dissatisfaction, of Jewish planning, whose goal is to create a
new order in the world. What was performed in so excellent a way in
Russia, thanks to Jewish brains, and because of Jewish dissatisfaction
and by Jewish planning, shall also, through the same Jewish mental an
physical forces, become a reality all over the world.&quot; (The American
Hebrew, September 10, 1920
&quot;In the Bolshevik era, 52 percent of the membership of the Soviet
communist party was Jewish, though Jews comprised only 1.8 percent of
the total population.&quot; (Stuart Kahan, The Wolf of the Kremlin, p. 81)
Interestingly, one of the first acts by the Bolsheviks was to make
so-called &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; a capital crime. This is confirmed by Stalin
himself:
&quot;National and racial chauvinism is a vestige of the misanthropic
customs characteristic of the period of cannibalism. Anti-semitism, as
an extreme form of racial chauvinism, is the most dangerous vestige of
cannibalism...under USSR law active anti-Semites are liable to the
death penalty.&quot; (Stalin, Collected Works, vol. 13, p. 30).

Here is a quote from Mein Kampf:
&quot;Making an effort to overcome my natural reluctance, I tried to read
articles of this nature published in the Marxist Press; but in doing
so my aversion increased all the more. And then I set about learning
something of the people who wrote and published this mischievous
stuff.  From the publisher downwards, all of them were Jews. I
recalled to mind the names of the public leaders of Marxism, and then
I realized that most of them belonged to the Chosen Race- the Social
Democratic representatives in the Imperial Cabinet as well as the
secretaries if the Trades Unions and the street agitators. Everywhere
the same sinister picture presented itself. I shall never forget the
row of names- Austerlitz, David, Adler, Ellonbogen, and others. One
fact became quite evident to

&gt; Because, the boycotters say, ¡§Israel¡¦s 40-year occupation has seriously
&gt; damaged the fabric of Palestinian society through annexation, illegal
&gt; settlement, collective punishment and restriction of movement,¡¨ that there
&gt; exists a ¡§complicity of Israeli academia in the occupation.¡¨
&gt; The British lecturers excoriated Israel because, as one of their complaints
&gt; went, Palestinian students were inconvenienced by security checkpoints as
&gt; they carried their books to school each morning. the ¡§sanctity¡¨ of the
&gt; college setting was forgotten when Palestinian Authority forces, believing
&gt; it was being used as a staging area for Hamas rocket launches, stormed the
&gt; 17,000-student Islamic University in Gaza. The entire campus was set
&gt; ablaze -- destroying books in its library, gutting offices, classrooms and
&gt; the student center.

&gt; Apparently the concept of academic freedom had to be revoked here, since
&gt; virtually every leading figure of Hamas has taught or studied at Islamic
&gt; University.

&gt; they are
&gt; members of that Palestinian generation that grew up knowing nothing but
&gt; occupation

&gt; With anger, hatred, and sheer ferocity, thousands of youngsters hurled rocks
&gt; at their Israeli occupiers, undaunted by the gunfire that greeted them. This
&gt; was more than civil unrest. ...It was the beginning of a civil rebellion -
&gt; Dan Fisher, Los Angeles Times, December 20, 1987.
&gt; On that day, - wrote John Kifner in The New York Times, - the vast army of
&gt; Arab laborers who wait on tables, pick vegetables, haul garbage, lay brick
&gt; and perform virtually all Israel's menial work, stayed home.: John Kifner,
&gt; New York Times, December 22, 1987.

&gt; The Israeli response to the uprising was brutal. Defense Minister Yitzhak
&gt; Rabin ordered the use of tanks, armored vehicles and automatic rifles
&gt; against an unarmed population.

&gt; The San Francisco Examiner cited Rabin as openly advocating assassination.
&gt; &quot;They can shoot to hit leaders of disorder,&quot; Rabin said in defense of the
&gt; army's practice of using marksmen with high-powered .22-caliber rifles to
&gt; shoot indiscriminately at Palestinian youth. - San Francisco Examiner,
&gt; December 23, 1987.

&gt;  Rabin ordered house-to-house searches, first for young men and later for
&gt; anyone of whom an example might be made. By December 27, over 2,500
&gt; Palestinians were seized, many of them as young as twelve; by the end of
&gt; January the number reached 4,000 and was rising.  The &quot;militants &quot;were
&gt; marked for deportation. Israeli high-security jails and detention centers
&gt; were overflowing. Mass trials of Palestinians were underway.

&gt; The act of brutality which most inflamed the Palestinian population was the
&gt; army seizure of the wounded from hospital beds. This practice, standard
&gt; procedure throughout the invasion of Lebanon in 1982, made Shifa Hospital in
&gt; Gaza a center of resistance. Great crowds amassed to defend the wounded,
&gt; whom, they rightfully feared, would never be seen again.

&gt; No fear of Jews standing up against cruelty and sadism as the Christians DID
