I love salmon skin but someone told me that bears fatten up on it.  He
saw on the nature channel where bears would strip the skin of salmons
in order to bulk up before hibernation.

Other than fat, what good stuff is in the skin vs the meat of the
salmon?

Fat will make you fat.. but at least its a heart healthy fat.
I'm not a nutritionist, so maybe check with one before you feast
on a river of salmon.

The smarter bears render the fats, put them
in capsules, and sell them through multi-level
marketing networks.

When buying smoked salmon with the skin on,
I always pan-fry the skin like it was bacon.
When done expertly, it becomes very crisp,
very much like bacon.  Stinks up the kitchen
(the whole house, really) with smoky fishy
smell.

The famed omega-3 fatty acids.  They are purported
to be so healthful that you don't need to diet,
exercise, or quit smoking.  :-)

I prefer to buy salmon filets with the skin on.
I grill skin up at first, then skin down till its
nice and done (Yan Can Cook:)  The skin falls off
when I'm taking the filet off the grill.

Hmmm, well..  Bears aren't exactly the thinnest animals
in nature.  Bears are fat and lazy.

The fat is throughout the fish, but there are higher
concentrations closer to the skin.

Unlike a bear, I can't imagine a human eating enough salmon skin
to get fat!

However, a method that I like removes the skin.

Salmon Roasted On Kosher Salt
(Saumon A L'unilateral)

2 cups coarse sea salt or kosher salt
1¼ lb center-cut piece salmon fillet

Cooking on a griddle is possible but roasting in the oven does
not make a lot of smoke. Make a dish with three layers of
aluminum foil folded together, place a thin layer of Kosher salt
and heat  it in the oven to 500F .  Place the salmon on the
salt, skin side down, and roast for 10 minutes.

Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until salmon is just
cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes

Slide a spatula between salmon skin and flesh and transfer
salmon to a platter (salmon skin will be too salty to eat).

It works well with Copper River Salmon and can be served with
just lemon or various yoghurt/dill sauces

Just that James (OP) sounded like he was going to feast like a bear on salmon..

Sounds good..  will it grill this way?  I enjoy the smokey flavors from
grilling, and dispite the cold and snow I grill all year.

I've cooked this way on a hibachi and a grill. The only thing is
that, AFAIK, it has to be done by inspection but the results are
good. This does ensure that the cooking odors are kept outside
the house .A layer of salt in a cast iron pan can be used too
but it's incredibly smoky!

I pretty much only grill salmon and do it outside.  Wintertime is not the
best time to lock odors indoors.

Bears are fat and lazy? maybe the ones in a zoo or a Disney movie, but in
the wild they are large, fit, very fast and hardly lazy. Don't confuse
trundling with being lazy. I've seen too many to think otherwise.

Pollutants, such as PCB and mercury, accumulate in the fish skin and
the fatty layer beneath the fish skin, so you should not eat it.

Yes. It is surprisingly difficult for some people to figure out that if you eat more than you consume you will get fat, even if it is low everything tastless artificially flavored and sweetened next to toxic diet food. Fat is fattening because it has way more energy than a carrot.
