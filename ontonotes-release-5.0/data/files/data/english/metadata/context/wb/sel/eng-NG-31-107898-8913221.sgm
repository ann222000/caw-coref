I know you've almost done it single-handed, but I may just be that
little extra push that helps you across the finish line. You've been
running a marathon of 'bravery' and I know it. You must be exhausted!

So yes, I want to be just like you are: AWOL in serving your country,
blind to everything except ideology, jingoistic to a fault, racist to
the core of your 'soul', selfish to the extreme, and as dumb as a
board.

I doubt strongly that I can meet you on any of these counts (because
you are among the best of the best at them. I have to give you props
where due...), and there is one I certainly cannot meet you on: it's
far too late for me to be AWOL like you were. But I will match your
posting volume, because I want to emulate you.

It's hard to find such an 'honorable' and 'honest' a 'man' as you are,
so full of 'integrity'. You truly are one of a 'kind'.

">

August 28 when the news was first announced as speculation.

Since then support has fizzled from a low starting point
and callers are issuing condolences.
Last Saturdays attempt at a rally of support netted about 50
and Chris Ello (sp?, recently signed sports talk show host) was
in the parking lot glad handing the protestors.
I heard it was on the air and pretty funny.

Bottom line... KLSDs ratings were never good and over the last
6 months dropped precipitiously.

I listened this morning on my drive to work....and all the callers
are either high or drunk or shreiking lunatic shutins.
You can almost hear the embarrassment in Taylors voice
as he tries desperately to extract a wisp sane criticism to discuss.
Taylor of course is just a showmen having come to KLSD from
conservative programs.

2pid, you don't get to judge sanity any more than you do military
strategy. You're simply not qualified.

&quot;Harvey Leroy &quot;Lee&quot; Atwater (February 26, 1951 - March 29, 1991) was
an American Republican political consultant and strategist. He was
born in Atlanta, Georgia and graduated from Newberry College, a small
private Lutheran institution in Newberry, South Carolina.

Atwater was a trusted advisor of U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and
George H. W. Bush. He was also a political mentor and close friend of
Karl Rove. Atwater invented many of the techniques of modern
smashmouth politics, a style of politicking that attempts to destroy
the careers and reputations of political opponents. His opponents
characterized him as the &quot;happy hatchet man&quot;[1] and &quot;the Darth Vader
of the Republican party&quot;.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Atwater

Is this who, IYO, reflects the &quot;true republican values&quot;?

&quot;Chit-chat&quot; does not equal &quot;political propaganda,&quot; 2pid. Even second-

No hypocrisy on my part, 2pid. Not one drop, as a matter of fact. I am
not clamoring for more audio content. RAO can die if that's what the
market decides. You, OTOH, want to keep it alive with the exact
equivalent of welfare, in the guise of 'discussions'. Now *that's*
hypocrisy.

In case you haven't noticed, 2pid, the only OT postings I make to you
fall into three categories:

1. As a rebuttal to your stupidity.

2. As a parody of your stupidity.

3. As an example of how stupid you look.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't like Randi at all, but that's beside the point.

&gt; &gt; &gt; She's not a big part of AA?

&gt; &gt; Sure.

&gt; Is she a reflection of the democratic party platform?
">

In many ways, yes. She appeals to &quot;the base.&quot;

As a middle-of-the-roader (one who believes that compromise is
essential in government), both sides are equally whacked.

However, I will certainly side, given a choice, with those who are FOR
human rights, civil rights, and so forth, rather than those AGAINST
these things, like you are.

Just say it, 2pid: Hannity and Coulter reflect the republican party's
base, which is a reflection of the party.

&gt; August 28 when the news was first announced as speculation.

&gt; Since then support has fizzled from a low starting point

&gt; Last Saturdays attempt at a rally of support netted about 50
&gt; and Chris Ello (sp?, recently signed sports talk show host) was
&gt; in the parking lot glad handing the protestors.
&gt; I heard it was on the air and pretty funny.

&gt; Bottom line... KLSDs ratings were never good and over the last
&gt; 6 months dropped precipitiously.

&gt; I listened this morning on my drive to work....and all the callers
&gt; are either high or drunk or shreiking lunatic shutins.
&gt; You can almost hear the embarrassment in Taylors voice
&gt; as he tries desperately to extract a wisp sane criticism to discuss.
&gt; Taylor of course is just a showmen having come to KLSD from
&gt; conservative programs.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The way AA covers politics....I thought it was sports...of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Roller Derby style.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This from a member of the party of Atwater, Hannity, Coulter...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 1 of 3 is better than average for you.

You want that very stereotyping path...
remember moveon.org is your ad agency.

Frankly, I think these political media animals like Hannity
is one big reason why the party split has gone so wide.
And he isn't close to mainstream republican which
gives uninformed people like you, the wrong impression.

Sadly parties don't stand for much anymore.
They waffle around issues trying to get elected

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.am1360klsd.com/main.html

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  Wow...they sure aren't keeping that site current.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; They've already announced the hiring of local sports show
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; guys from other stations and callers are giving Stacy condolences.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Was the station sold?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; No...It's been a clear channel station for as long as I've known
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hmmm.  Here's an interesting take: http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5013

&gt; &gt;&gt; August 28 when the news was first announced as speculation.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Since then support has fizzled from a low starting point
&gt; &gt;&gt; and callers are issuing condolences.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Last Saturdays attempt at a rally of support netted about 50
&gt; &gt;&gt; and Chris Ello (sp?, recently signed sports talk show host) was
&gt; &gt;&gt; in the parking lot glad handing the protestors.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I heard it was on the air and pretty funny.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Bottom line... KLSDs ratings were never good and over the last
&gt; &gt;&gt; 6 months dropped precipitiously.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I listened this morning on my drive to work....and all the callers
&gt; &gt;&gt; are either high or drunk or shreiking lunatic shutins.
&gt; &gt;&gt; You can almost hear the embarrassment in Taylors voice
&gt; &gt;&gt; as he tries desperately to extract a wisp sane criticism to discuss.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Taylor of course is just a showmen having come to KLSD from
&gt; &gt;&gt; conservative programs.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The way AA covers politics....I thought it was sports...of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Roller Derby style.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This from a member of the party of Atwater, Hannity, Coulter...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 1 of 3 is better than average for you.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And one better than you.  (wow! fun, huh?)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;  If you like baseless analogies....I don't recall equating
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the party to media honks....even sane ones like Hewitt.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 1 party player...2 media honks.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You don't agree that Hannity and Coulter are Republicans?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;  So what...I could be a democrat tomorrow.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Party registration is meaningless to the party platform and what it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; stands for.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Do you think that Hannity and Coulter reflet the party platform?

should anybody else? Mexicans can choose whether or not to follow
immigration rules. The military can do whatever they want to do, or to
not do.

Or is it that because there are no consequences, you are somehow
morally correct here?

I await your answer as you often talk of morals, integrity, and
honesty (don't worry, we all know those words are a sham when you use
them).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You're free to ignore or bitch or participate.
">

I already do, 2pid. No need to tell me what I already know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;  Even second-
&gt; &gt; graders know that, though I'm not surprised that the concept eludes
&gt; &gt; you, as so much does.

&gt;  Do they? Who decides what is political propaganda?  You?
&gt; Lol.
">

Yes, Lol, me and many, many others, 2pid. I have seen Stephen, for
example, try to educate you on how to actually turn your posts into
discussions, from the 'discussions' and propaganda they are now.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So what happens to you when you're exposed to inappropriate
&gt; chit-chat?  Do you turn all red and break out in hives or
&gt; burst like a steaming volcano of pustulence?
">

No, not at all. I shred your 'logic' and make you look like a bigger
ass than you do yourself, just like always.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Who here (besides Bratzi) plasters the group with OT political posts
&gt; &gt; to the extent that you do?

&gt;   Who here wants to give up their freedom to you?
">

It's not my freedom at issue here, 2pid. Do you 'think' all of your OT
rants are pertinent to this group? Do they follow the charter?

So I ask again (and I am fully aware that you'll duck this, just like
you do with all hard questions):

Do you break the rules simply because you can get away with it, or is
it somehow 'right' when you break a rule, as opposed to all of those
you berate for doing so in your OT jihads? Or do some rules not
matter, and have you placed yourself as the judge? Lol!

Hypocrite.

Here's a hint: find me all of the posts where I give you shit for
posting on audio topics, even when your head is up your ass (like the
current thread with Trevor on caps). I think you'll find exactly one.
Can you find more? No.

So I ask: is what you're doing WRT OT posts right, or is it just that
you can get away with it?

IOW, exactly how big of a hypocrite are you?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Or you can act like a consumate hypocrite clamoring for
&gt; &gt; &gt; something you can't or won't do yourself.

&gt; &gt; No hypocrisy on my part, 2pid. Not one drop, as a matter of fact. I am
&gt; &gt; not clamoring for more audio content. RAO can die if that's what the
&gt; &gt; market decides. You, OTOH, want to keep it alive with the exact
&gt; &gt; equivalent of welfare, in the guise of 'discussions'. Now *that's*
&gt; &gt; hypocrisy.

&gt; I am the market and I shall give it life...even if its
&gt; Al Frankensteinian.
">

Goody. And I shall give you shit for your stupidity. Now that our
roles are clearly identified, we can continue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; In case you haven't noticed, 2pid, the only OT postings I make to you
&gt; &gt; fall into three categories:

&gt;   1st grade
&gt;   2nd grade
&gt; and
&gt;   pre-school.
">

I agree, but they are your posts, after all. (An IKYABWAI, as these
are all you apparently understand.)

BTW, you didn't thank me. You never would've come up with this if I
hadn't planted the &quot;second-graders&quot; line above. You do not have an
original thought in your head, and never have.

You're too easy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Time to put you back in the ignored bin till you produce something of

&gt; Thats how most adults deal with things they consider unpleasant
&gt; and worthless....
&gt; they ignore them.

Be my guest. I think you'll still read them though. Otherwise, you
wouldn't know if they were 'worthy' of your attention. Lol!
