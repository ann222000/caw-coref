Ben, Luke and I are working on finalizing the details for MinneBar
this spring.  In the mean time, there are three upcoming events that
look interesting:

- Code Freeze '08 -

The UMN's Software Engineering Center's annual Code Freeze symposium
is January 17th ($90).  From their site:

&quot;In one action packed day, the Code Freeze 2008 Software Symposium
will touch on many facets of innovation. We will discuss business
innovations for four hours in the morning and technology innovations
for four hours in the afternoon. Topics will range from how to rethink
or change your business to a myriad of ways you can use cool new
technologies to improve your software production.&quot;

- Facebook Developer Garage -

This one's more of a save-the-date:  Facebook is coming to town to
present a day long &quot;developer garage&quot; session on January 15th.
Details to follow.

- Frozen Perl 2008 -

From http://www.frozen-perl.org/mpw2008/

&quot;Frozen Perl is a low-cost one-day workshop held at the University of
Minnesota's McNamara Alumni Center. The workshop will on Saturday,
February 16 beginning at 9:00 AM. The workshop theme is 'Perl in
Practice'. The talks presented at the conference will be about
practical uses of Perl, and practical ways to improve your Perl code
and development efforts. Early-bird registration is $10 for students,
and $20 for everyone else. Those rates will double on January 12.&quot;

Thanks,

Dan
