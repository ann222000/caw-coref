I operate a personal domain which is hosted with a national ISP. I have been
with this ISP since 1998 and have always had good dealings with them. I work
in technology and often work from my home, so having a uniform address on an
ongoing basis is very critical to my work. Although I do have a (minimal)
web page, my primary reason for having the personal domain is for inbound
and outbound email.

Recently I discovered, quite by coincidence, that email being sent to me was
not being delivered. I discovered this when I received a call from a
colleague asking why I hadn't responded to his email--which I never
received. After verifying that the email never arrived, I contacted the
corporate IT dept to check on outbound mail through the mail server.
Everything was transmitted correctly. I had them check our corporate
upstream provider and everything was fine there, too.

At this point I figured the problem must be on the receiving end. When I
contacted my ISP, one of their technicians looked in their firewall system
and discovered that my account had a &quot;custom email filter&quot; setup which he
called &quot;quite unusual.&quot; _All_ inbound email with FW in the subject line, or
any number of other permutations indicating that the email was forwarded,
was deleted automatically by the spam firewall. In other words, no email
forwarded to me by my colleagues or any number of other people was ever
delivered. Other email, of course, went through fine.

This is problematic because due to the nature of my position, I receive--or
at least I should receive--a large number of forwarded emails from clients,
colleagues, etc. Many of these, for example, are emails directed initially
to other departments of my company that are then directed to me for
followup. These emails are frequently from clients or potential clients or
other individuals that are critical to the successful operation of our
company.

Well, I am _extremely_ embarassed and rather livid that for the past unknown
number of months all of this correspondence has been deleted without
delivery. It would be akin to someone going to one's inbox at work and
shredding a good quantity of inbound correspondence every day. As an
example, after discovering this problem and making a few phone calls I
discovered that just within the past week over 10 emails were
undelivered--and this is just from 3 departments I contacted.

The employee of the ISP has no idea how the filter got there. It would have
had to have been placed there by someone from the company. Company records
confirm that at no time did I request this filter be placed on my account.
I gathered from talking to the employee that they have no records of who
placed the filter there.

The problem is solved moving forward, but obviously nothing can be done
about the past.

The only issue at this point is what should I &quot;demand&quot; as compensation for
this problem? and if that demand is not agreed to, what should I do then?
I'm fairly certain that if this were to go to court, I could win. The
problem, though, is that the ISP is in a distant state and pursuing this by
means of small claims or others would be very difficult.

Any advice would be appreciated.

"/> Ask them for a credit for your service for the period in question
(months?). They should be able to find the date that the filter was
placed on your account.

That is the most that you are likely to get in the way of compensation.

Take a chill pill and move on. You're not going to get anything from this
company and you probably wouldn't win in Court if you were foolish enough to
go that route.

Then find a new company to deal with and move your business there.

I have to agree. Buried somewhere in your ISP's terms of service
I guarantee there's a disclaimer disavowing any responsibility for
these kinds of problems. If you were in the EU then it might be
different, but here in the states your chances of recovering any
damages range from diddly to squat.

"/> Well, as a point of fact, there is no such language in the terms of
service--not when the account was established nor on the company's present
site. The paperwork I have from the company when the account was
established in 1997 is relatively straighforward. Along the lines of &quot;we
agree to run your domain's email and web service&quot; and &quot;you agree to pay us.&quot;
There are provisions about web bandwidth and such, but nothing at all
addressing email. The entire agreement is free of any &quot;legalese.&quot;

While I agree that an ISP is generally held to a &quot;best effort&quot; standard, I
can't see that applying here. It would be akin to the phone company employee
deciding that you should be getting calls from people in California and
automatically disconnecting all calls to you from that location. It wasn't a
technical malfunction, it was a problem created by a company employee.

In my case, I'd assume it was a mistake borne of ignorance, but at this
point that's just speculation. In other words, if I found out that over the
past week 2 emails to me weren't delivered due to techical glitches, then
that's understandable. If I found out that 20% of my email was not delivered
because a computer was told to arbitrarily select 1 in 5 emails and
automatically deleted them, then I think that is different.

You're misframing the issue. The issue is *actual* damages. If you can
*prove* that you've been harmed monetarily, then you are entitled to
be made whole. Being inconvenienced, or missing emails that you can't
prove has cost you money is not a basis for awarding damages.

That said, if the company wants to throw you a bone for the
inconvenience, that's up to them. It certainly would show some good
will.

really boils down to a legal question regarding the terms of your
agreement with your ISP? What kind of compensation do you expect? I
seriously doubt the ISP would open an account and guarantee email
delivery 100% of the time.

Your best option is probably to move on with life and take a lesson from
this that email delivery is not guaranteed. You can, of course, arrange
to set up a system where an email is sent to your from outside your ISP
and if you don't get each day's automated mailing, its cause to start
investigating why.

Unless you can prove how much you lost monetarily (which falls back to
the actual number of emails deleted over the duration that the filter
was working) without resorting to a lot of hand-waving wild
suppositions, you won't win. There's going to be a lot of backtracking
on your part (contacting your clients and asking them about all emails f
orwarded to you during that time frame) before you can even begin to
build your case.

Sit down and write out a letter of complaint to your ISP. List what
happened and how they will retain you as a customer (credit of your
account for X number of months due to the compromised service.) Send it
certified, return receipt requested. Follow it up.

Letters (not emails; those just get canned answers of no consequence) of

"/> I wouldn't say that actual damages did not occur. Unfortunately proving
actual damages will be very difficult.

Let me give you a situation parallel to mine using a hypothetical. Assume a
company website has a way for people to email the company that are highly
interested in purchasing a very expensive product marketed by the company
(in excess of $100k). These emails are filtered and read by office staff who
handle routine replies. If deemed to be serious contacts with particular
questions that are beyond the normal information requests , these are
forwarded to a particular address.

Additionally, email traffic from other company departments and other
prospective customers is regularly forwarded to this same address. These
include requests for information and other important general job-related
content.

_All_ of this email for the past 17 months has been automatically deleted by
the inbound main server's spam filter. Enough messages were sent in a
non-forwarded format by people with direct access to the address that this
was not noticed as a problem.

When the problem was discovered, it was possible to trace back from only 3
forwarding clients how much mail was lost during the prior 3 days. During
that time over 10 messages were lost from just those clients. It would be
reasonable to assume from past experience and more complete understanding of
the system that at a conservative minimum 30 emails were lost per week.
Possibly many times more than that. For over a year and a half.

Some emails were particularly related to the purchase of goods. Others that
are more troubling to me personally are messages from colleagues containing
things like requests for days off, scheduling matters, recommendations for
prospective new employees, requests for various types of assistance, and so
on. A significant percentage of those emails all went into a black hole
instead of being properly delivered. (Making me look rather callous for not
having responded to any of these.)

And for those coming late to the thread, why were those message deleted?
Because someone doing maintenance on the ISP's spam firewall inserted a
custom filter to delete all forwarded email to this account. This
filter--which is not standard and can only be done by an ISP employee--was
not requested for this account. In essence, it isn't a case of an occasional
email being incorrectly flagged by the spam filter, it is a case of 100% of
email that is forwarded being irretrievably deleted.

I've requested that the ISP issue a service credit equal to the period of
time this filter has been in place. (They won't be out any $ this way, and
in the grand scheme of things is trivial to them.) If they won't do this,
then I'll have to figure out how it might be possible to determine actual
damages by trying to recover lost information from forwarding clients and
following up with senders from that information.

&gt; used primarily to have a personal domain for inbound and
&gt; outbound email relating to my job. Recently, a client who tried
&gt; to forward an email to me told me that its messages weren't
&gt; being delivered and my inquiry to followed by an investigation
&gt; by the hosting ISP confirmed that the ISP's firewall software
&gt; included a &quot;custom email filter&quot; that somehone affiliated with
&gt; it inexplicably associated with my account with the result that
&gt; all email addressed to me with any (and, apparently, every
&gt; variation of) indication in its subject line that it was a message
&gt; the sender to me received from another and was trying to
&gt; forward to me was deleted automatically -- a problem I had not
&gt; detected earlier since email to me without a &quot;FW&quot; or other
&gt; indication of its being a forwarded communication was meanwhile
&gt; being delivered without incident. This has been embarrassing
&gt; and otherwise disturbing to me because the nature my job
&gt; includes that many colleagues and clients foward communications
&gt; to me from others including prospective clients, many of which
&gt; ask for and which the forwarder reasonably believes will result
&gt; in follow-up by me. Thus, besides my concern about potential
&gt; damage to my reputation/standing with these others, lest they
&gt; perceive me to be discourteous or insufficiently conscientious
&gt; when, unintentionally because in the circumstances unknowingly,
&gt; I did not respond to such a request, I am also upset about
&gt; potential damage to the company, too, if needed follow-up by
&gt; me had not been done. ]

"/> This is understandably upsetting, although you nowhere report above or
elsewhere in your posting/query that, apart from what, possibly, might
have happened by reason of such non-delivery, any of the consequences
that concern you (apart from non-delivery) ever actually did occur.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; [ The ISP employee with whom I spoke also confirmed
&gt; that the ISP's records do not show that it was I or
&gt; anyone else acting on any request by me who ever asked
&gt; that the filter in question be applied to my account; though
&gt; I am satisfied that the problem has been solved so that
&gt; future forwarded messages will not be deleted or bounced
&gt; in the above manner. ]

&gt;The only issue at this point is what should I &quot;demand&quot; as
&gt; compensation for this problem? and if that demand is not
&gt; agreed to, what should I do then?

"/> You can demand anything you want and it is at least conjecturally
possible that the ISP, in its own self-defined/self-determined
self-interest, as a gesture, might offer some sort of nominal sum or
other benefit for maintenance of &quot;good will&quot; purposes.

But the infirmity with this question in law-related terms is that,
other than (again: understandably) to report frustration and related
feelings and to speculate about possible &quot;could have...&quot;s and &quot;what
if...?&quot;s, you have not reported any dollar measurable damage, i.e.,
any damage in fact, to you or to your business (or - though in the
circumstances, probably incidentally - that even if you had reported
damage to the business, that you have standing to make a claim on its
behalf).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm fairly certain that if this were to
&gt; go to court, I could win.

"/> It is also at least speculatively possible that the ISP to which you
refer had chosen to behave in ways materially inconsistent with what
has long been most common throughout the industry; but persons who
operate on the basis not of mere possibility and, instead, of
real-life probabilities very likely would bet (very probably: quite
safely) that, on the facts as you've so far reported them, there is
not any factual or law-conferrable basis for any such certainty.

This is because, unless you quote language in your and the ISP's user
agreement to the contrary (which you certainly do not do anywhere in
your posting/query), it is probable that those terms/conditions
include provisions to the effect that the ISP shall not be deemed an
insurer with respect to any of the services at issue (to the contrary,
it very likely quite clearly/affirmatively disclaims any such
obligation) and also to the effect that the ISP shall not be liable
for (even if otherwise provable) any compensatory damages (as
distinguished, perhaps, from refunding some portion of the fees for
use) of any nature resutling just from its negligence or failure to do
whatever it therein agreed to do.

You appear at least in effect to acknowledge, however, that you do not
have any reason to believe (much less any actual evidence or even
realistic basis to believe that you could ever [let alone:
cost-effectively] obtain any evidence) that the screw-up to which you
refer was deliberately/maliciously caused and so you also in effect
acknowledge that, at worst, there has been ISP carelessness (if that);
although quite apart from your not having quoted any contractual
language that would support what you say you are &quot;certain&quot; about, this
issue appears from what you've so far said to be moot in any event,
since (as noted) you do not report (and most especially do not say
that you have any basis realistically to expect actually to prove) any
damage in fact that resulted from this screw-up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The problem, though, is that the ISP is in a distant
&gt; state and pursuing this by means of small claims or
&gt; others would be very difficult.

"/> As noted, this is not &quot;The problem&quot; although it is very likely that,
from your here implied perspective, there is another &quot;problem&quot; you
also so far fail to address -- namely, that your and the ISP's user
agreement probably also includes forum/venue-selection provisions that
will be tantamount to insuring the dismissal of any lawsuit you
attempted to bring/prosecute in violation of such a provision.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Any advice would be appreciated.

"/> Possibly, apart from fleetingly hurt feelings (that you say you're
&quot;embarrassed&quot;), you actually can prove damage in fact and just forgot
to include facts to this effect in your posting/query; and yet
unless/until you are able (realistically) to conclude that you
probably can do this, the other considerations summarized above are
moot. But even if you were able to overcome that threshhold (yet key)
burden, i.e., even if further reflection by you does result in your
being able to overcome the lack of evidence of actually dollar
measurable damage to you by reason of what occurred, you would then
need to confirm that there are not provisions in your and the ISP's
user agreement to the effect I suggest above may be present.

And, certainly, it is not desirable for you to be &quot;certain&quot; about what
you say above unless/until you have addressed all these issues far
more specifically than you so far do in your posting/query.

&gt;Let me give you a situation parallel to mine using a hypothetical. Assume a
&gt;company web site has a way for people to email the company that are highly
&gt;interested in purchasing a very expensive product marketed by the company
&gt;(in excess of $100k). These emails are filtered and read by office staff who
&gt;handle routine replies. If deemed to be serious contacts with particular
&gt;questions that are beyond the normal information requests , these are
&gt;forwarded to a particular address.
&gt;...
&gt;Additionally, email traffic from other company departments and other
&gt;prospective customers is regularly forwarded to this same address. These
&gt;include requests for information and other important general job-related

&gt;I've requested that the ISP issue a service credit equal to the period of

The basic problem is that you have asked a question about breach of contract
and have not shown us the contract. So all answers are speculation,
including this one. There is no way any of us can tell whether a contract
has been breached without reading it. That is not a criticism - all I mean
is that you need to find the rest of the contract. In one of your posts you
said:

&quot;The paperwork I have from the company when the account was
established in 1997 is relatively straighforward. Along the lines of &quot;we
agree to run your domain's email and web service&quot; and &quot;you agree to pay us.&quot;
There are provisions about web bandwidth and such, but nothing at all
addressing email. The entire agreement is free of any &quot;legalese.&quot;

It is hard to believe that a national ISP would operate with this sort of
contract. I think that if you sue them they will defend by offering as
evidence a professional agreement and proof that it was in place at the time
of your engagement of them, or that it was added later as permitted by the
original agreement. One way to flush out the terms is to proceed part way
down the path toward signing up as a new customer. If you tell us who the
ISP is, maybe someone here will go take a look. Oh, by the way - the
testimony of that tech you talked to may be slightly different if the person
is called on to testify.

If this is a small claim, your best option is to make a reasonable demand
and then live with whatever results. If this is not a small claim, take the
matter to an attorney experienced in consumer litigation. Take to the
attorney the minimal contract that you have and authorize the attorney to
turn a tech loose searching for the rest of it.

Finally, it may be that you are overly optimistic about the lack of
disclaimers and legalese in the contract. A short, amateurish contract is
not necessarily good for your side because the standards of performance are
not mentioned. I know this is an exaduration, but if the entire contract
consists of: &quot;we agree to run your domain's email and web service and you
agree to pay us&quot;, where's the breach? Did they or did they not run your
domain's e-mail and web service? You would be down to trying to prove
implied terms of quality based on industry norms.

I understand your anger and frustration. If you hadn't discovered the
problem it could have been a business disaster. But you have to decide what
to do now based on business sense rather than anger. I suggest your focus
should be on business rather than law. First, don't trust e-mail alone -
they don't always get through. I have had e-mails disappear into the ether,
incoming and outgoing. Use a receipt system or something. Second, I don't
see any point in changing ISP's. This one has apparently been good enough
except for the recent screw-up, and the next one is likely to have a
rock-solid contract, containing no obligations concerning quality of
performance or a lack of screw-ups. Third, it may be possible to tell
clients that e-mails sometimes get lost in cyberspace and they should call
if your firm ever fails to be perfectly responsive.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I operate a personal domain which is hosted with a national ISP. I have
&gt;been with this ISP since 1998 and have always had good dealings with them.
&gt;I work in technology and often work from my home, so having a uniform
&gt;address on an ongoing basis is very critical to my work. Although I do have
&gt;a (minimal) web page, my primary reason for having the personal domain is
&gt;for inbound and outbound email.

&gt; Recently I discovered, quite by coincidence, that email being sent to me
&gt; was not being delivered. I discovered this when I received a call from a
&gt; colleague asking why I hadn't responded to his email--which I never
&gt; received. After verifying that the email never arrived, I contacted the
&gt; corporate IT dept to check on outbound mail through the mail server.
&gt; Everything was transmitted correctly. I had them check our corporate
&gt; upstream provider and everything was fine there, too.

&gt; At this point I figured the problem must be on the receiving end. When I
&gt; contacted my ISP, one of their technicians looked in their firewall system
&gt; and discovered that my account had a &quot;custom email filter&quot; setup which he
&gt; called &quot;quite unusual.&quot; _All_ inbound email with FW in the subject line,
&gt; or any number of other permutations indicating that the email was
&gt; forwarded, was deleted automatically by the spam firewall. In other words,
&gt; no email forwarded to me by my colleagues or any number of other people
&gt; was ever delivered. Other email, of course, went through fine.

&gt; This is problematic because due to the nature of my position, I
&gt; receive--or at least I should receive--a large number of forwarded emails
&gt; from clients, colleagues, etc. Many of these, for example, are emails
&gt; directed initially to other departments of my company that are then
&gt; directed to me for followup. These emails are frequently from clients or
&gt; potential clients or other individuals that are critical to the successful
&gt; operation of our company.

&gt; Well, I am _extremely_ embarassed and rather livid that for the past
&gt; unknown number of months all of this correspondence has been deleted
&gt; without delivery. It would be akin to someone going to one's inbox at
&gt; work and shredding a good quantity of inbound correspondence every day. As
&gt; an example, after discovering this problem and making a few phone calls I
&gt; discovered that just within the past week over 10 emails were
&gt; undelivered--and this is just from 3 departments I contacted.

&gt; The employee of the ISP has no idea how the filter got there. It would
&gt; have had to have been placed there by someone from the company. Company
&gt; records confirm that at no time did I request this filter be placed on my
&gt; account. I gathered from talking to the employee that they have no records
&gt; of who placed the filter there.

&gt; The problem is solved moving forward, but obviously nothing can be done
&gt; about the past.

&gt; The only issue at this point is what should I &quot;demand&quot; as compensation for
&gt; this problem? and if that demand is not agreed to, what should I do then?
&gt; I'm fairly certain that if this were to go to court, I could win. The
&gt; problem, though, is that the ISP is in a distant state and pursuing this
&gt; by means of small claims or others would be very difficult.

&gt; Any advice would be appreciated.

"/> The barracuda firewall system is not in any way available over the Internet.
The administrator of the equipment said that the only way this could have
been setup is at a local terminal at the ISP.

As far as social engineering, it's pretty unlikely that I'd be a target for
that, nonetheless, the person I spoke with (the person who admins the
firewall) looked through their system which tracks all trouble tickets. He
found no reference to any request for this filter or any reference to it
having been placed. (His first inclination was to tell me that I requested
it, but after checking company records he stated that it was clear I
didn't.)

When they first setup the spam firewall, I was one of their first accounts
placed on the system. For some reason the firewall instead of deleting spam
was multiplying it. (Every spam email sent to me resulted in 5-10 copies of
that spam showing up in my inbox.) I emailed the company about this and they
said that they'd solve the problem. My theory is that whatever they did to
&quot;solve the problem&quot; introduced this new problem, since looking at my records
now I see no traffic of the sort that has been deleted from that day until
now.

"/> I do technical support, and I've used a number of ticket-tracking
systems. If a mistake like you describe took place, it could be *very*
difficult to find the original request for it in most of them. It's
usually not hard to find things like this if you have some criteria to
narrow it down, like an account name. But if someone operated on the
wrong account, you've got to search *every* account, and there's no
obvious thing to search for.

It sounds like this company also doesn't use a decent change tracking
system, so they can't determine who made the change or when. So this
means they can't narrow the search to a time period or an engineer.

Unless the problem affects a major customer, or law enforcement is
involved, companies will usually be reluctant to spend enormous amounts
of time researching the original cause. They'll usually just give the
customer a credit and forget about it.

&gt;&gt; Actually, those waivers in the TOS/AUP are unenforceable, and
&gt;&gt; plaintiffs do recover for things like this when actual monetary
&gt;&gt; damages occur.

&gt; Care to cite any authority to support that claim? A TOS/AUP is a
contract,
&gt; so why would not be enforceable? THe probably also have a limitation of
&gt; damages clause that would be fully enforceable.

"/> The law sets down certain requirements of warranty and liability. Just
because the buyer and seller agree not to abide by those statutes doesn't
mean the agreement is valid. Do a Google search on the words unenforceable
and negligence, and you'll find all the references you could ever need. You
can also search for the word exculpatory where you will learn how states
void many of the exculpatory clauses you agree to in contracts.
