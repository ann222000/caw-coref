Belly up and name your poison, a round for all the greasy fingered knuckle
busters.

I am mounting an early 00's Softail fuel tank on a Shovel with a rubber-
mount hardtail frame. I am tempted to hard mount the tank (stock tabs, no
rubber). It looks like a pretty robust tank, but does anyone have any
experience or think of a reason why I shouldn't?

Stupid question #2. I have to bend some 1/4" stainless flat about an inch
and a half wide at some 45 degree angles. Which will end up with the
stronger piece, just bend it, or heat it and bend it? Would there be more
potential for eventual cracking by just bending it, or doesn't it matter?

I could care less about what kind of "customizin" you do.

Vibrations may break the tabs would be my why you shouldn't.  Even the tank
on my old Honda, which runs pretty smooth, has a rubber mounted tank.  Just
my $0.02.

My experience on the Triumph is just the opposite. I've had trouble with
several rubber mounted tanks, but none with either of the tanks that
were solid mount. The rubber allows the vibration to shake the tank
worse, IMO.

nope in fact tanks were solid mounted to hd's for a 100 years &lt;g&gt;

just be sure that everything is aligned properly to the mounting tabs
(no gaps or uneven pieces

I'm not sure what you mean by a rubber mounted tank.  Typically the only
rubber involved is the grommets that go into the tank tabs.  So for all
intentional purposes, it's a solid mount.

Stupid question #2.1.  What grade of stainless is it?
Heating the metal (within reason) will not change the strength of the metal
once it cools.  The only thing heating will do for you is allow you to make
sharper bends before it cracks.  IOW, if you are wanting to bend it with a
small radius, you need to heat it up or it will crack.

Uh, Tud, don't look now, but Harley built bikes with hard mounted
tanks for longer than you've been alive.

The only caveat is that the the hole in the tank tab should align with
the bolt hole, so that it isn't stressed.  That is what will cause the
tab to crack.

This pretty much confirms what I was thinkin'. I had an old sporty
hardtail at one time with a solid mount peanut tank. I didn't have any
issues with it (other than running out of gas all the freakin' time). I
was just concerned about the larger capacity tank and all that extra
weight hangin' off the sides. Looks like I'm gonna give it a shot. I'll
let ya'all know if it falls off.

After a quick google, it looks like water quenching can resolve the
carbide issue which revolved around corrosion resistance of the stainless
if left to cool slowly. Since the piece, once formed, needs to be welded
to the frame, I may as well take the easy route and heat bend it. The
reason I was worried is that it is part of the braking system amd could
cause ...errrr... "issues" if it cracked.

Dredging up shards of memories from HS shop class here.  Seems I remember
that heating steel to red-hot, then quick cooling, hardens it and makes
it more brittle.  Perhaps not the best for a tab that will be subject to
vibration and flexing.  I'd use as little heat as req to get a clean
bend.

That depends a lot on the carbon content . You can heat and quench 1018
steel all day and all you'll do is waste time and energy . Other steels
don't need to be quenched to harden , just held at a certain temp for a
certain time .
4140 is like that . Makes great transmission spacers and thrust washers
because it doesn't warp (as much) when heat treated . And it gets harder
than the back of my head  .

I'll try to find out what grade this is. If you look at a newer softail,
at the back brake tab on the swingarm that holds the rear caliper in
place, you'll see what I'm trying to fab. Not real difficult, but I don't
want to screw it up. You never know when one of those SUV-type critters
are gonna jump out at ya. Sorry Snag. Have another one on me!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stupid question #2. I have to bend some 1/4&quot; stainless flat

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will end up with the stronger piece, just bend it, or heat it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and bend it? Would there be more potential for eventual

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stupid question #2.1.  What grade of stainless is it?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Heating the metal (within reason) will not change the strength of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the metal once it cools.  The only thing heating will do for you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is allow you to make sharper bends before it cracks.  IOW, if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you are wanting to bend it with a small radius, you need to heat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it up or it will crack.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   I've been reading a metalworking newsgroup . Google on carbide
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; precipitation in stainless steel . I remember it is a bad thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and there was a procedure to follow to prevent or eliminate it ,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but don't remember what it is .

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After a quick google, it looks like water quenching can resolve the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; carbide issue which revolved around corrosion resistance of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stainless if left to cool slowly. Since the piece, once formed,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; needs to be welded to the frame, I may as well take the easy route
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and heat bend it. The reason I was worried is that it is part of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the braking system amd could cause ...errrr... &quot;issues&quot; if it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cracked.

You say above you're welding this tab to the swingarm . Is the swingarm
stainless ? What welding process are you using ?
IN MY OPINION this tab should be the same material as the swingarm and be
properly welded by someone who knows what they're doing . That may be you ,
I don't know you and wouldn't presume to judge your abilities . Brakes
aren't something to take chances on , not that mine did me any good . Guess

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Belly up and name your poison, a round for all the greasy fingered

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am mounting an early 00's Softail fuel tank on a Shovel with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rubber- mount hardtail frame. I am tempted to hard mount the tank
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (stock tabs, no rubber). It looks like a pretty robust tank, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does anyone have any experience or think of a reason why I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shouldn't?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Vibrations may break the tabs would be my why you shouldn't.  Even
&gt;&gt;&gt; the tank on my old Honda, which runs pretty smooth, has a rubber
&gt;&gt;&gt; mounted tank.  Just my $0.02.

&gt;&gt; Uh, Tud, don't look now, but Harley built bikes with hard mounted
&gt;&gt; tanks for longer than you've been alive.

&gt;&gt; The only caveat is that the the hole in the tank tab should align with
&gt;&gt; the bolt hole, so that it isn't stressed.  That is what will cause the
&gt;&gt; tab to crack.

&gt;See there, if I hadn't posted the wrong information then nobody would have
&gt;piped up with the right answer and an explanation.  &lt;sfsf&gt;

Wonder if we could engineer a new mounting ring and make shovel pipes
