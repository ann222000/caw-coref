Sonnet 77 (half of 154)

Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
Thy DIAL how thy precious minutes WASTE;
The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
Thou by thy DIAL's shady stealth mayst know
Time's thievish progress to eternity.
Look, what thy memory can not contain
Commit to these WASTE blanks, and thou shalt find
Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.

I think that you're making a mistake, Tom -- although he is indeed
very repetitive, aneuendorffer114 ... @comicass.nut can be quite amusing
upon occasion; one just has to learn to skim what he posts (roughly 98%
of which is complete crap) in search of the occasional comedic gem.

kenned ... @charter.net or elizabeth_w ... @mail.com, but he compensates by
being a skillful parodist. Besides, Art's intelligence (which even his

How is that possible? Art has at least achieved something
worthwhile,
so he is not apt to gorge upon the sour grapes of frustrated failure,
as
Mr. Crowley is. Art has at least published a mathematics paper. True,
the result is not especially exciting, being essentially a rediscoVERy
of a
result published in 1884, but at least Art managed to publish it; can
you imagine Mr. Crowley doing anything remotely comparable? (I doubt
that his
keen attributional work on the &quot;Ray Mignot&quot; sonnet will ever be
published.)
Besides, Art is capable of some amusing, self-deprecating humor
(although
his self-defecating humor is admittedly far more conspicuous); see, for
example, his post regarding the MIT piano that may have committed
self-defenestration after having been played by Art.

In any case, I do hope that you will reconsider. If you had
included Art
in your blocked senders list earlier, you would have missed gems like

&gt; Say, before they ship it to whomever they give it to we should all gather

Art can still tell a hawk from a handsaw. Mr. Crowley cannot tell
&quot;Ray
Mignot&quot; from an Elizabethan. In any case, neither sanity nor
competence
is necessarily a useful criterion -- I cannot recall anyone ever
participating
in h.l.a.s. who is less competent than Elizabeth Weird, but surely
nobody
with any sense of humor would filter out Elizabeth's posts. Art's case
is
similar, but with more dross to sift through for the comedic nuggets.

How interesting that someone should consider making public another person as
&quot;a complete waste of time&quot; while writing in an humanities group. With a few
asides on the compulsive enthusiasms of various posters to their
hero/anti-hero fixations, I restrict my messages to etymologies and such as
would interest a fair minded researcher. It is a distinction of a sort of to
be so exempted by a commensal burke.

Well, I enjoy the different personalities of everyone who's been on
this newsgroup since I've been here (except for jollyrogers, who I hope
will mellow out after a few years), though it is definitely hard to
find the time to read long or obscure posts.

It would be nice, though, to occasionally hear from a few more
Shakespeare or Renaissance scholars who would be tolerant and patient
enough to put up with us ignorant buffoons, and who could share with us
some interesting ideas about the plays themselves.
