this morning at 0930 i spotted an adult peregrine falcon perched on a telephone pole on the east side of hwy. 131 about 1 mile south of the hwy. 40/hwy. 131 intersection.  he caught my eye  being noticeably smaller and trimmer looking than the usual suspects -- swainson's hawks and red-tails.  i pulled over and glassed him for a while.  definitely an adult.  i was very glad i had my binos with me but very disappointed that i didn't have my scope and brand new digital camera scope adapter!!!  most likely he's a migrant (we do have an eyrie 20 miles to the southeast) but maybe he'll spend a few days in the yampa valley hunting our waterfowl and i'll get another crack at a digi-photo.

happy birding!
