Just got a new job that requires a commute and my 5 speed S2 was just not
the type of car for that task. It is with her new owner in Portland,
Oregon....

...I am the proud owner of a 325is BMW now. Let me state for the
record...sorry BMW guys, but, the BMW is definitely a quality step down from
a Porsche.

Thanks, and you can bet on it. The BMW is comfy and has all of the right
amenities for a morning commute, but the fun factor is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
down there from the S2.

For those of you that are interested...I have been chosen to develop
training programs for a major manufacturer located up here in Seattle. My
programs will encompass both the U.S. and Canada.

I don't know about the fun factor discrepancy...I think I'll politely
disagree.

We have an '87 924S and a 2002 325i wagon and my husband and I play "rock
paper scissors" for who gets to drive when we go out but we have a hard time
choosing which one we want to drive. Yes, they are different rides but both
are VERY fun. Of course we then have to decide who's the designated
driver--that can create a little cognitive dissonance--he who gets to imbibe
doesn't get to drive home.

ie
Austin

PS...they're both standards, of course.

Well...let me give some details and maybe you can see my point.

The S2 was a Cabriolet. The BMW is a sedan.

The S2 had 211HP and 209lb/ft of torque. The BMW has 190HP.

The S2 was a 5 speed and the BMW is an automatic.

Don't get me wrong, I love the new car, but, it is much more "tame" than the
S2. I had to drive the S2, the BMW glides along with very little input from
me. I would agree that they are different types of fun, but I love a pure
raw sports car over the sports sedan. What it came down to was a 35 mile
commute in Seattle traffic.

It makes a fun commuter car... but you have to maintain it... (mines in right

Not bad mileage either for mixed city/highway commute...

John, we are talking about an S2 Cab vs. a regular 944. There is a world of
difference between the two. I have no doubt the S2 would have done great in
the commute, but, day in and day out of Seattle traffic (which ranked in the
top 5 of worst places to commute, ahead of Chicago and NY) would have taken
it's toll on me. Also on the upside, I usually had to take my son out in my
wife's Explorer, now he can ride with me.

I dunno... according to the below article... my commute on the Ike is #2

December, 2000 we got 31 inches of snow in a 15 day timeperiod... (that was
when I remmeber the guy in front of me flagging me to go around because he

were too deep... the spoiler was constantly in the snow...

Different methodology.  If you can find 5 years of AAA or other articles,
fine.  You *CAN* find 5 years of the A&amp;M articles, and Seattle
is consistentently in the top 10.  Things just don't go from 4th
to off the top-10 in one year.

Traffic truly sucks here.  No joke.  You can monitor it here:

http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/traffic/seattle/

Take 405 north to Bellevue in morning rush hour and you'll know
commuting hell.  ~Even~ in the carpool lane.  And whoever built most of
our interchanges was a sadist.  That bastard.

--

Devs,
Saddened that you've left the Porsche ranks, I'll suspect you'll hang
around for the addiction.  I'll also wager that your not done with these
cars, either.  I love driving the Porker to work everyday, but I can
shift my hours to circumvent much of the stop-n-go.   If I can hit a
hunnerd, it's a great day.  She's dirty as hell right now from the rain
and needs a serious bath.
I eyeball some of those Bimmers myself, but the carhole only has so
much room.  The motorbikes gotta stay warm, too.

Just within the city limits of Chicago is 1% of the entire U.S. population,
Seattle has less than 600k people...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago
Population Density  4923/km
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle

Nearly double the density and unfortunately... everyone has a car :-(

And... it's supposed to snow tonite... (it was still freezing rain as I

You have enough lanes for carpool lanes?  The Dan Ryan expressway is 14
lanes wide... and I've been on it where the traffic was stopped for so
long that kids were playing frisbee... true story... (it has portapottys
on the shoulder at places so you can "go" when your stuck in traffic).

We are on that RFG gas... one of the side effects they say are that it dries
out the rubber in fuel lines and causes them to crack or swell... leaks...
Car-B-Ques are a huge pain during rushhour...  I see you are on something
called 7.8RVP.. not sure if that causes similar issues...

Hey Dead...it's too bad you never got to drive the S2. Quite an impressive
automobile. The new owner just loves it. I finally get to stay home and
would be able to meet up with you, but the price of staying home was the
car...
My commute is right in the teeth of that 405 traffic you mentioned. My job
is in Woodinville. Sure glad I got rid of that house 10 minutes away in
Snohomish...
Monday mornings take me a little over 2 hours to get there. The ride home is
much better...slow but moving. I am searching for a carpool now to at least
get use of the carpool lane for where it does move. Right now we are looking
at Issaquah and Redmond for houses. There are some reasonable properties
left up there...if not Bothell or Mill Creek may be our destination in a
year or so.

&gt; Devs,
&gt; Saddened that you've left the Porsche ranks, I'll suspect you'll hang
&gt; around for the addiction.  I'll also wager that your not done with these
&gt; cars, either.  I love driving the Porker to work everyday, but I can shift
&gt; my hours to circumvent much of the stop-n-go.   If I can hit a hunnerd,
&gt; it's a great day.  She's dirty as hell right now from the rain and needs a
&gt; serious bath.
&gt; I eyeball some of those Bimmers myself, but the carhole only has so much
&gt; room.  The motorbikes gotta stay warm, too.

Well.. the point is... your article published in 2002 is based on 2001 or
earlier data... the articles from 2005 are published with earlier data too,
but later than what you've quoted... so your question of how can CNN have

the L, but the traffic pattern isn't like it used to be with everyone working
in the loop... the burb roads are as bad as the Kennedy now, except the
Kennedy is still as bad as ever...

But... it's quite easy to drive a stick shift car daily in those environments,
even in the snowy envirnments of New York or Chicago...

So... are there more comfortable cars out there to commute in... sure, but
don't blame it on the commute, just admit your a wuss that went for comfort ;-)

It's ok... but accept responsibility instead of blaming the car or the city...

You know... we bought a ford focus for my daughter to drive and my wife and
i were using it to go someplace the other day and my wife said to me "Why
don't you trade in your car for a real car like this?".

It's easy to be seduced by comfort... but I don't think a focus can take
the ramp between i-294 and i-290 at 60mph (dry days only)... although the
focus has done respectably in the world ralley championship...

Enjoy your beamer... :-)

You have wussed out.

Just put in 5w30 and put the snow tires on my '44. It's good for all

Did you consider keeping the P-car and commuting in an older Suzuki
Swift? :p

I guess that's what you get for not reading the whole thread...Is your 944
an S2 Cabriolet? Does it have the heavy duty clutch like mine had? If I had
my old 1984 N/A maybe, but, my 40 mile, 2.5 hour commute was painful in the
S2. If you do the average, you will see I crawl to work at around 15MPH.
Yes, of course I thought of getting a commuter car...which of course I would
have to insure (Washington is friggin expensive) at the same liability
levels as my 944 and Explorer, so now I could eat a nice $1600 every 6
months insurance bill. Actually, me and the Mrs. are looking north to
Issaquah and Redmond for a place, then maybe down the road I can get another
cab.

I had to go look it up... it appears Beemer can be used for both, but Bimmer
is for cars only... why?  I have no idea... anyway, I mispelled it either way.

http://www.boston-bmwcca.org/reference/Bimmer-Beemer.aspx says;
"... A Very Highly Placed BMW Spokesperson sent me the following (reproduced
here with permission).

While I can't point to any official document that supports this, my
understanding of the origins are as follows.

The term Beemer was first used with motorcycles. Back when British bikes
dominated the market and BSA was a well-known marque, riders referred to
them as Beezers -- a way to say the letters BSA as if it were a word.

BMW riders said Beemer as a way of saying BMW as a word. This was long
before the popularity of BMW cars, so whenever the term Beemer was spoken,
it referred to the motorcycle. In theory, one could apply Beemer to either
cars or bikes since it is only a reference to the name BMW. In fact some
folks do call BMW cars Beemers.

When the cars became popular, many people referred to them as Bimmers as
well as Beemers. I don't know why this was adopted instead of simply using
the existing Beemers.

But generally speaking, one calls the bikes Beemers and the cars Bimmers.
While it would be ok to refer to a car as a Beemer, it doesn't seem
appropriate to refer to a bike as a Bimmer. ..."

This is like the Porsche one-syllable/two syllable pronunciation
thing - I never bother correcting people since I know what they mean,
but I'll explain the difference if it comes up (usually if I've got a
copy of "Bimmer" magazine on my desk or coffee table).
