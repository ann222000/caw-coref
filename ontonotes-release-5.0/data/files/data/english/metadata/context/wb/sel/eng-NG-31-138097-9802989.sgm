In uncharted waters

After the severe battering the stock prices received over the past one week, the rally on Wednesday was a great relief. The Sensex and the Nifty recovered
by 931 and 304 points respectively over Tuesday's closing levels. The gains are by any yardstick impressive. Yet given the sharp drop in market valuations
and the speed at which it occurred, it would be too early to think that a full-fledged, sustainable recovery is under way. By Tuesday evening, the Sensex
had cum ulatively lost 4,450 points, more than a 21 per cent fall from the intra-day peak of 21,206 reached on January 10, just 11 sessions earlier. Forecasting
stock prices has become hazardous because global factors rather than purely domestic ones are influencing markets everywhere. That is why even the recognition
that there is no change in either domestic economic fundamentals or in the expected high level of corporate earnings did little to stem the slide, triggered
almost entirely by news of the worsening economic situation in the United States. In India too, there have been a few glaring weaknesses. Stocks such as
those in power, real estate, and financial services were riding a bubble and a correction was perhaps overdue. Even before their recent peaks, the Sensex
and the Nifty represented valuations far higher than in other emerging markets.

At the start of the new year, the threat of recession loomed large in the U.S., even as the sub-prime crisis continued unabated with serious consequences
for the rest of the world. There has also been the larger problem of global imbalances whose orderly unwinding required coordinated actions by central
banks around the world. In fact, among policy makers including those in India, there was a sense of unease over the future direction of the financial markets.
However, the sharp fall in stock prices in India and the rest of Asia so soon into the new year took everyone by surprise. On Tuesday the U.S. Federal
Reserve, which along with other central banks of the developed world, has been shoring up liquidity for quite a while, took the unprecedented step of lowering
the federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage point. More than the calming words from, among others, the Finance Minister and the large buying orders from
a few public sector institutions led by the Life Insurance Corporation, it was this initiative that stemmed what appeared to be a free fall. It is still
unclear if the worst is over. Over the near-term, whether a full blown recession in the U.S. can be averted by the Fed's latest move and the tax cut package
being planned to stimulate the economy will determine market sentiment everywhere.

Cricket's Cinderella Man

At a time of great social change when value systems have to be recalibrated, those who set standards can make a real contribution. There can be few better
role models than Anil Kumble for young Indians as they cope with the challenges of a world in which protective walls are being torn down rapidly. He stands
out not merely as a bona fide member of a trinity that occupies a unique, perhaps unassailable, position in the history of Test cricket. The iron-willed
spinner is un ique when compared with even his great peers because the 600-odd wickets he has captured over 17 years of toil are a monument to character
as much as to skill. Kumble was not blessed with an inborn genius of the kind that enabled Shane Warne or Muthiah Muralitharan to become a bowler of far
more mesmerising quality. Unlike the Australian and the Sri Lankan who could produce deliveries that seemed to defy the laws of physics, the Indian has
perhaps never dismissed a batsman with a magic ball. The high swooping right arm and wrist lack the flexibility to make the cherry deviate more than a
few inches from its trajectory. What makes Kumble special is that he has always striven to extract the maximum from limited natural resources. The Indian
Test captain has earned his iconic status by consistently demonstrating the power of the mind.

It would have been counted as an accomplishment had Kumble merely embodied the qualities Indian parents have traditionally striven to inculcate in their
children - a solid work ethic, honesty, perseverance, and modesty. The Bangalorean's achievement in terms of character development is all the more laudable
because he has gone beyond being just a recipient of wisdom; he has injected his own dynamics into the process and contributed another dimension to the
ideal. Whether his self-belief became rock hard because he was always the Cinderella Man among Indian cricket's superstars is a question only he can answer.
What is material is that Kumble has applied this quality to the cause of team and country. His willingness to lead from the front in the face of adversity
was on display in the fortnight following the defeat at Sydney. While there was more than a touch of hype about the Bollyline affair, the time had certainly
come for someone to speak out against Aussie hyper-gamesmanship. The Indian captain was the man for the occasion since his integrity has won him the respect
of all professional cricketers. Kumble's role in resuscitating the spirit of the game was as commendable as the leadership with which he took his men to
victory at the WACA.

Pakistan Army retreating from politics?

Nirupama Subramanian

In the eight weeks since the control of the Pakistan Army has passed into new hands, there have been indications that it is quietly but rapidly distancing
itself from the political sphere.

In an interview to Newsweek recently, President Pervez Musharraf made the remark that Benazir Bhutto was &quot;very unpopular&quot; with the Pakistan Army. It was
always said that the upper echelons of the army had a visceral hatred for the Bhuttos but this was the first time it was articulated in such a manner by
an insider, that too, a former army chief and now the President. The comment caused outrage. What was he thinking, asked commentators. That the leader
of the most popular party in the country needs a certificate from the army? Benazir came to power twice, both times through a popular vote. Do the wishes
of the people count for nothing? And if that was the case, why did he go all the way to Abu Dhabi last year when he was still army chief to negotiate with
her?

But for the first time in many years, the Pakistan Army did not have to defend General (retd.) Musharraf's statements. Someone called the Director-General
of the Inter-Services Public Relations for a comment on the remark. &quot;Since this has been stated by the President and not the Pakistan Army, he alone is
competent to answer this question,&quot; said the ISPR's Major-General Athar Abbas. The message was clear enough: we don't do the President any more.

In the eight weeks since the control of the Pakistan Army has passed into new hands, there have been other indications that it is quietly but rapidly distancing
itself from the political sphere. Earlier this month, the new chief of army staff, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, sent out a letter to officers asking them
to desist from hobnobbing with politicians. The letter, parts of which newspapers published and were confirmed by the military spokesman, said the Pakistan
Army had no role to play in politics. He asked soldiers to pay attention instead to their &quot;professional&quot; responsibilities, and officers to steer clear
of politicians, warning them against calling politicians to the General Headquarters or having any other &quot;direct or indirect&quot; contact with them.

The other significant measure is a plan to recall serving army officers deployed in civilian government departments back to their units. Major-General Abbas,
the military spokesman, told The Hindu that the number of serving officers presently in civilian departments was &quot;around 250, certainly not more than 300.&quot;
Confirming that the policy to pull them out was &quot;under consideration,&quot; he said a detailed plan for this was being finalised.

These small steps have sent out the first positive signals about the Pakistan Army in a long time. For an institution that once had a cherished place in
the heart of Pakistanis, 2007 marked a low point, perhaps its lowest since 1971 when it was held responsible for the break-up of the country. Already facing
criticism for training its guns against its own people in the &quot;war on terror&quot; operations in the north-west frontier region, President Musharraf's sacking
of the Chief Justice in March, and the consequent agitation by the legal community, opened another front against it.

The unpopularity of Gen. Musharraf, then still the COAS, saw itself reflected in an unprecedented animosity towards the Pakistan Army. The streets echoed
with slogans against the military. From being abused as an &quot;American lackey&quot; to accusations of unprofessionalism, the army saw it all last year. Despite
several government warnings that no one must defame the military, spring 2007's rallying cry of &quot;Go Musharraf Go&quot; had by summer turned into &quot;Go Fauj Go.&quot;
One of the lasting images from that time is a pick-up van that used to pop up at all the processions and rallies, bearing on one side a cut-out of a military
boot crushing a map of Pakistan with the words &quot;bhukhe mar gaye mein aur tu, lut ke kha gaya GHQ (you and I have died starving, while GHQ has looted and
eaten it all)&quot; and, on the other, a banner demanding an 80 per cent cut in the defence budget.

Lt. Gen (retd.) Talat Masood, an astute commentator on the situation in his country, said he could recall no other time when the role of the army was debated
so threadbare. Like him, those with strong bonds to the Pakistan Army, are palpably relieved that the new leadership is taking immediate steps to repair
the damage and prevent it from being dragged through more mud.

Writing in The News, Kamal Matinuddin, another retired Lieutenant-General, commended Gen. Kayani for taking steps that would &quot;help in reducing criticism
of the army, which we so

Lifeline for the rural poor

Over the nearly two years since it became operational, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) of 2005 has had a positive impact on the lives
of millions of people across the poorest districts in the country. The Act, which guarantees 100 days of employment per household at minimum wage, is the
first piece of legislation that compels the state to provide a social safety net for impoverished rural households. Up until now the scheme has covered
330 districts acr oss different States; it is due to cover the entire country by April 2008. What the economist Prime Minister Manmohan Singh hopes to
achieve through the agency of NREGA is the abolition of the &quot;harsh edges of poverty&quot; across rural India - a tall order. Although implementation has suffered
from procedural shortcomings, such as those mentioned in the draft report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, these teething problems should
not obscure the main success of the programme. It has been demonstrated time and again that the NREGA has provided wage security for poor rural families,
aided the economic emancipation of women, and created public assets. The adoption of a rights-based approach to work, including the payment of minimum
wages, has contributed to enhancing the quality of life for the rural poor. Further, there are enough constructive experiences to show that corruption
can be largely prevented through strict enforcement of the transparency safeguards.

As successive social audits of the NREGA have revealed, there are standout success stories. In Rajasthan, where public awareness of the programme is high,
77 days of employment per rural household were provided in 2006-2007. In Tamil Nadu, the participation of women was as high as 81 per cent. In both States,
social audits in different districts have shown that embezzlement of funds, irregularities in the muster rolls, and other types of corruption have declined
substantially. In Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand, the NREGA has created positive changes in the implementation of public works programmes. A recent delegation
of the Central Employment Guarantee Council to Sonebhadra district in U.P. found a number of major improvements since the days of the National Food For
Work Programme: the scale of employment has increased, minimum wages are being paid, delays in wage payments have been sharply reduced, and the exploitative
practices of private contractors are a thing of the past. In some States, notably Orissa, corruption is very much in evidence but this only reinforces
the urgent need to implement the transparency safeguards. There are also programmatic concerns such as the absence of worksite facilities for women with
children and the need for a fair revision of the schedule of rates. These issues need to be addressed swiftly. None of them must be allowed to deter the
wholehearted implementation of an Act that has become a lifeline for millions of Indians who have been left out in the cold by high economic growth.

The slowdown in perspective

In its latest review of the economy, the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (EAC) makes no deviation from what it said six months ago in the Economic
Outlook about the broad trends. But it has sharply focussed on some disquieting developments in India and abroad. The EAC's forecast of a growth rate of
8.9 per cent for this year, though at the upper end of its earlier forecast range, might still disappoint those who have come to expect a minimum annual
g rowth of 9 per cent. By most yardsticks a growth rate of nearly 9 per cent is impressive. Yet in the current Indian context, even a slight drop would
be seen as a pointer to a gradual slowing down of the economy. During the first two quarters of this year the economy has grown by 9.1 per cent, as against
9.9 per cent recorded over the same period in 2006-07. The EAC is not off the mark when it suggests that the pace of economic acceleration that began five
years ago might be losing some steam. The non-farm sector comprising industry and services which has provided the stimulus appears likely to grow steadily
at 10 to 10.5 per cent. The good news is that the farm sector has shown a distinct improvement recently, registering a 3.5 per cent growth in all the three
previous quarters.

In the opinion of the EAC, the economy is resilient enough to overcome any slowdown. There are major infrastructure constraints holding back industrial
output. Although the southwest monsoon has been good, weather-induced fluctuations in farm output are likely to affect the GDP level. A bigger threat has
emerged from the global environment - for instance, the sub-prime housing mortgage crisis in the U.S. The EAC however feels that the Indian economy is
less vulnerable than China's. For all the emerging economies including India's, inflation remains the biggest threat. Although currently headline inflation
is below 4 per cent, there can be no room for complacency. There has been no let-up in the surge in prices of oil, industrial raw materials, and food items,
especially wheat. Above all, there are problems associated with surging capital flows and the consequent rupee appreciation. These negative trends notwithstanding,
the EAC expects the economy to settle down to a growth rate that is above 8.5 per cent and closer to 9 per cent per annum.

Fighting the cancer of corruption

Ramesh Thakur

The war on corruption cannot be left to governments. The role of civil society and the press is vital in lobbying for better laws and law-enforcement, highlighting
corruption, reshaping attitudes and reversing public apathy toward corruption.

On January 13, The Hindu reported that the World Bank has unearthed serious cases of fraud and corruption in five projects in India receiving Bank aid relating
to malaria control ($114 million), Orissa health systems development ($82.1 million), food and drug capacity building ($54 million), national HIV/AIDS
control ($193.7 million) and tuberculosis control ($124.8 million).

The fraud and corruption came to light during a detailed implementation review by the World Bank last year with the support of the Government of India.
Commenting on the finding, Bank President Robert B. Zoellick said the Government of India had promised to take &quot;exemplary&quot; action against those found guilty
of these &quot;unacceptable indicators&quot; of fraud and corruption. On the Bank's side, the probe had shown up &quot;systemic flaws&quot; and &quot;weaknesses in project design,
supervision and evaluation.&quot; On the Indian side, Mr. Zoellick expressed appreciation of the government's &quot;resolute commitment in pursuing criminal wrong-doing.&quot;

If we pause to reflect for a moment on the five health projects identified in the international investigation, we can understand, as argued previously by

C. Raj Kumar in these pages, why corruption is an assault on human rights, in this case the right to health. Staying with the medical metaphor, it is also
a cancer that will kill development unless drastic surgery is performed to rid it from the Indian body politic.

With the signing of the U.N. Convention against Corruption in Merida, Mexico, on December 9, 2003, the issue of the drag of corruption on economic growth
and development gained fresh relevance. The Global Compact Leaders Summit in New York on June 24, 2004, chaired by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, incorporated
the fight against corruption as the 10th principle of the U.N. Global Compact.

Corruption robs civic life of public virtue. The World Bank estimates that corruption amounts to 5 per cent of the world economy, well over $1.5 trillion.
The effects of corruption are most destructive and savage in developing countries. Not coincidentally, the top 20 countries - the 20 least corrupt - in
Transparency International's annual survey tend to be dominated by the Western industrialised countries, especially the northern Europeans, Canada and
New Zealand. The generally high rankings of Singapore and Hong Kong merely underline the fundamental importance of public probity in escaping the poverty
trap.

In many Asian countries, the No. 1 issue fuelling public anger is public sector corruption involving politicians, civil servants and law-enforcement officers.
In Transparency International's list of the top 10 corrupt leaders of the last quarter century, eight were from the developing countries of Asia, Africa
and Latin America, with the other two being from the transition economies of eastern Europe.

The global affliction is especially acute in India and, within the country, particularly acute in Bihar. In several independent international surveys by
disinterested and reputable organisations, China, India and Indonesia are usually among the worst on corruption scores while Singapore and Japan tend to
rank among the least corrupt in Asia and indeed in the world. The bottom-ranking countries in the above survey are notorious for influence-peddling politicians,
money-seeking bureaucrats and bribe-dispensing entrepreneurs. Time was when businesses seeking deals in Indonesia went to a one-shop corruption counter
in the form of the Suharto family. Since then there has been a democratisation of corruption, with lawmakers and provincial powerbrokers all demanding
their share yet not being able to guarantee delivery of their end of the deals as during the Suharto era.

Bribery is especially pernicious and institutionalised in defence deals. In an environment of pervasive corruption, arms deals are exceptionally enticing.
They often involve large sums of money. Negotiations take place in secrecy. Tricky questions can be fobbed off on grounds of &quot;national security.&quot; Arms
dealers are skilled at winning favours, at the cost of transparent and competitive bidding. The Tehelka expose in India showed politicians, military officers
and civilian bureaucrats accepting substantial sums of money to influence a fictitious arms deal. While this took

For Asian workers in the Gulf

The Abu Dhabi Declaration is a timely and forward-looking acknowledgment of the problems and issues that have piled up on the expatriate labour front in
the region. It emerged from the first focussed dialogue on the subject held in a labour destination country in the Gulf. The document, endorsed by 21 Asian
and Gulf Cooperation Council Ministers, outlines a collaborative action plan to give a fair deal to the workers, who are largely from Asia. The key recommendation,
that effective actions should be initiated within three months to root out illegal recruitment practices, in the countries of origin as well as in the
host countries, and to promote more transparent policies and practices of recruitment and employment, could bring the guest workers job security and fair
benefits. The practical outcome of the exercise, which builds on the Asian Regional Consultative Process on Overseas Employment and Contractual Labour,
or the Colombo Process, will be keenly watched in India and other South Asian countries.

The Gulf Arab states depend on imported labour but are wary of the impact of the numbers on their demography: the six GCC members have a population of 35
million, including 13 million expatriates. Their response is to assert the 'temporary' nature of the workers' presence: &quot;Asian workers are contracted workers,
not what some call immigrant workers.&quot; While this anxiety, a sub-text in the Declaration, is understandable, the Gulf Arab states need to get serious about
implementing labour protection measures, and give expatriate workers a better deal in wages, housing, and health. The booming GCC economies, while reaping
the benefits of record oil prices, should be mindful of the fact that they are facing increased competition from other countries in need of skilled labour.
The gap between wages in the GCC and some robust Asian economies is closing, moderating the appeal of the Gulf market. In the case of Indian workers, the
rising rupee has fuelled acute discontent, which has expressed itself in a series of strike actions and a rising number of suicides. The recently announced
wage revisions in some sectors are encouraging. A wage structure that is linked to the cost of living in the host countries and a joint consultative mechanism
to redress workers' grievances will certainly help reduce the discontent. India needs to consolidate the gains it has made for its expatriate workers through
signing a number of bilateral labour agreements in the region by working out cooperatively with the Gulf countries practical measures in tune with the
spirit of the Abu Dhabi dialogue.

The irascible master of chess

With the death of Robert James Fischer (1943-2008), the chess world has lost a genius and a highly eccentric and controversial ambassador. Bobby Fischer
gave the game a new identity in the 1960s. His epic triumph over Soviet world champion Boris Spassky in 1972 helped popularise chess round the world. At
15, he was the game's youngest Grandmaster; and over the next decade, the American emerged as the biggest threat to Soviet hegemony. A self-taught student
of the game, Fischer understood the consequences of a particular opening sequence better and faster than any of his contemporaries. Between 1970 and 1972,
his genius was on incandescent display. On the way to challenging Spassky, he decimated three top-10 players - Mark Taimanov 6-0, Bent Larsen 6-0, and
Tigran Petrosian 6.5-2.5. When, in 1972, Reykjavik hosted what is arguably chess's most famous world championship clash, Fischer lost the opening game
before a crowd of 5,000. He did not turn up for the second in the 24-game match. He returned for the third on condition that the game was played at the
back of the hall with no spectator allowed. He even objected to the gloss on the table. Fischer won the third game and it was Spassky's turn to refuse
to play at the back. The American eventually won 12.5-8.5 and the chess world had a new champion.

If the first 30 years of Fischer's life were notable for the counter-revolution he wrought in the chess world, the next three decades were in the nature
of a Shakespearean tragedy. When, in 1975, he refused to defend his title against Russian Anatoly Karpov (after the International Federation declined to
accept his over-the-top conditions), he was lost to the chess world. He lived secretly, mostly outside America; and on his emergence from long oblivion
in 1992, pocketed $3.35 million by beating Spassky in a 30-game match in Yugoslavia. The United States maintained that Fischer had violated U.N. sanctions
against Yugoslavia and issued an arrest warrant against him. Never returning to his home country after that, he was bitterly critical of the U.S., whose
'Cold War' he once self-consciously waged on the chessboard. He made anti-Semetic remarks, praised the 9/11 terrorist attack, and wanted America &quot;wiped
out.&quot; In 2005, after nine months of detention in Japan for attempting to leave on an invalid American passport, Fischer moved to Iceland, which mercifully
offered him citizenship. He died a loner in Reykjavik, a city that had once made him the world's chess icon. Most of the chess world did not miss the sexagenarian;
it mourned the 28-year-old whose irascible genius made millions fall in love with the game.

Case for sex education in schools

Laura Keenan

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

It makes sense to provide students with reliable sources of information rather than leaving them to peers, television or the Internet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The government recently proposed the introduction of an Adolescence Education Programme (AEP) in schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education.
After receiving a petition objecting to the proposal, the Parliamentary Petitions Committee (Rajya Sabha) opened up the issue for public comment. Since
then, it has been inundated with thousands of responses, including many passionate and highly predictable denouncements of school-based sex education.
Moralisers claim that the programme is a covert Western conspiracy to re-colonise India's youth, promote premarital sex and undermine traditional family
values via branded contraceptives.

In the face of these arguments for cultural conservatism, it might be easy to forget that India is now home to the highest number of HIV-positive people.
It might also be easy to forget that, according to a Union government report, 53 per cent of Indian children are victims of some form of sexual abuse.
In this context, it is in the country's own interests to ensure that exaggerated fears do not dissuade legislators from taking a strong stance on the importance
of open sex education, and to recognise that the AEP can play a critical role in promoting gender awareness, combating the rapid spread of HIV and empowering
the young to protect themselves against sexual exploitation.

There has been substantial research on the effectiveness of the comprehensive sex/sexuality education model, as developed in the AEP. Ironically, the high
rates of teenage pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Infection in the United Kingdom and the United States have been used to indicate the failure of the
comprehensive approach. These countries have two of the most conservative approaches to sex education in the industrialised world. In the U.K., sex education
is not compulsory. Schools rarely provide more than 10 hours of sex education, and the focus is on the biological aspects of sexual activity and risk reduction.
Four per cent of girls under 18 become pregnant every year (the highest rate in Europe) - 10 per cent in some areas. Fifteen-year-old girls in England
are twice as likely to be sexually active as those in France and Holland. Cases of gonorrhoea among teenage boys increased by 107 per cent between 1999
and 2005.

On the contrary, the comprehensive and discursive &quot;life skills&quot; model is designed to encourage young people to consider the responsibilities of growing
up. &quot;Life Skills,&quot; says Edward C. Green of the Harvard Centre for Population and Development, &quot;refers to training youth in such skills as interpersonal
relationships, self-awareness and self-esteem, problem solving, effective communication, decision-making, negotiating sex or NOT having sex, resisting
peer pressure, critical thinking, formation of friendships, and empathy. These are referred to as cognitive skills and they seem to help youth make healthy
and indeed life-saving decisions.&quot;

In Holland, comprehensive sexuality education begins in primary school. It reports the highest use of contraception among young people, and the lowest pregnancy
rate in Europe. The average age of the first sexual encounter at 17.7 years is not higher than elsewhere on the continent.

So why is it worth defending the AEP?

1. According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, young people have a fundamental right to information that will empower them to
protect their health and wellbeing. To achieve this, educators must make children aware of sexual abuse and exploitation as well as STIs, HIV/AIDS and
pregnancy.

2. Participatory sex education encourages discussion of relationships. People have strong views on sexuality and the socio-cultural frameworks in which
it operates; it is important to be able to discuss these values in an atmosphere which discourages prejudice. A plethora of studies suggests that open
and participatory sex education empowers young people to say &quot;no,&quot; rather than promoting promiscuity. It has been shown to defer rather than encourage
sexual activity, motivate the use of contraceptives, and reduce the number of sexual partners. According to research by the World Health Organisation,
the proportion of Ugandan males aged 15-24 reporting premarital sex decreased from 60 per cent in 1989 to 23 per cent in 1995

Constructive proposals

All except extremists and opportunists in the Tamil and Sinhala camps will welcome the interim steps recommended by the All Party Representatives Committee
(APRC) to move forward the process of earnestly implementing the devolution and official language provisions of the Sri Lankan Constitution. This measured
political intervention helps put things in perspective in the post-ceasefire period - by reminding everyone that there can be no military solution to the
island nation's ethnic conflict. India has special reason to welcome the APRC's proposals: they vindicate the political thinking behind the Indo-Sri Lanka
Agreement of July 1987. The specific devolution steps recommended, which flow from the 13th amendment to the 1978 Constitution, are to hold Provincial
Council elections immediately in the Eastern Province; and to establish a credible Interim Council for the Northern Province until elections are held,
which cannot be any time soon. The need to finance the devolution exercise robustly is underscored. The APRC had the advantage of not having to deal with
the knotty issue of merger of the North and the East since the Supreme Court, in October 2006, ordered de-merger, largely on technical grounds. The other
part of the APRC's package is the enactment of laws to fully implement Chapter IV of the 1978 Constitution, which recognises Tamil as an official and national
language and provides for its use - by right - in the legislative, administrative, and judicial arenas and as a medium of instruction.

The mandate given to the APRC, headed by Thissa Vitharana, a non-chauvinist and progressive politician, is to craft a set of proposals that would be &quot;the
basis for a solution to the national question.&quot; The promise is that the interim steps proposed in the report submitted to President Mahinda Rajapaksa are
a &quot;prelude&quot; to a far-going consensus document that will be available in &quot;the very near future.&quot; Since the report states that the final political package
will require a constitutional amendment, that some of its provisions will also need to be approved in a referendum, and that all this will take time &quot;once
a favourable climate is established,&quot; the indication is that what is envisaged is a federal or quasi-federal solution. It is another matter that the United
National Party and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna - both walked out of the APRC for their own reasons - are not parties to its interim recommendations.
Everyone knows that the LTTE under Velupillai Prabakaran is constitutionally incapable of accepting this kind of solution to the Tamil question. The challenge
before non-extremist Tamil political parties is to show the courage and wisdom to go for genuine devolution of power rather than attach themselves to the
strategy and tactics of the terrorist Tigers.

Labour's continuing woes

After his successful visits to India and China, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was clearly looking forward to taking the high ground, with plans to
seize the political initiative from the Tories. Within hours of his returning home, his government was hit by its first ministerial crisis when Peter Hain,
the high-profile Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, was forced to resign for failing to disclose a £103,000 donation to his deputy leadership election
campaign. This bit of sleaze presents uncomfortable parallels with the early days of the Blair administration. Tony Blair was barely months into office
when his government suffered its first Cabinet casualty. Peter Mandelson, the Trade and Industry Secretary, had to quit under circumstances similar to
those that brought down Mr. Hain. Like him, Mr. Mandelson had 'forgotten' to declare a substantial financial transaction - a £373,000 housing loan. Allegations
of sleaze were to haunt the Blair government for the rest of its tenure, culminating in the infamous cash-for-peerages scandal that went right up to Downing
Street and ultimately hastened Mr. Blair's departure. In a worrying replay, the Brown dispensation has been dogged by funding and donation rows. Two senior
Labour figures - deputy leader Harriet Harman, and the Scottish Labour leader Wendy Alexander - are under a cloud with the Electoral Commission investigating
allegedly illegal donations to their leadership campaigns.

All three have sought to blame their difficulties on 'complex' funding rules and administrative oversight, or both. Mr. Hain admitted he made a mistake
but claimed it was an &quot;innocent mistake.&quot; He resigned only after the Electoral Commission decided to hand over his case to Scotland Yard, making his position
untenable. Mr. Brown's attempt to play down the affair by dismissing it as a case of mere &quot;incompetence&quot; has provoked ridicule. Opinion polls show that
voters see 'Donorgate' as another manifestation of the continuing culture of Labour sleaze. In recent months, a series of crises has weakened public trust
in the government - among them its handling of the collapse of Northern Rock, the first major British bank to go bust in more than 150 years; the loss
of the personal data of millions of Britons; and a revolt over public sector pay. The Hain affair is seen to have diminished Mr. Brown's political authority
and, as The Guardian sees it, left him &quot;desperately needing to restore his reputation for resolve&quot; - which is in short supply at this low point for Labour.

Do political murders achieve their objectives?

Praveen Swami

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Theatrical acts of violence compel acknowledgment of, and engagement with, the causes of their perpetrators.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

&quot;A man who goes forth to take the life of another whom he does not know,&quot; wrote G. Frank in 1963 , &quot;must believe one thing only - that by his act he will
change the course of history.&quot;

Ever since former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's murder in December, scholars and security professionals are focussing on the content and character
of political assassinations in South Asia. Some commentators have raised fears that the Pakistani state and political system might be overwhelmed by armies
of committed Islamist assassins willing to sacrifice their lives for their cause. Similar concerns have been raised in other theatres of conflict.

Just what is it that drives assassins such as the members of the al-Qaeda-linked hit squad that killed Benazir? Given the obvious difficulties involved
in conducting sociological research on would-be assassins, no one knows for certain. And what work there is has thrown up mixed results.

A 2003 study by anthropologist Scott Atran, for example, found that suicide bombers were &quot;fairly well educated [and] mostly from the middle class.&quot; Research
conducted by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan last year, though, suggested that suicide bombers were typically poor, socially-insecure
seminary students, brainwashed with promises of other-world paradise. No full appraisal of suicide bombers and assassins has been conducted in India, where
perpetrators have come from all major religions and social classes. But the evidence does seem to bear out Frank's half-century-old assertion. Faith drives
assassins - not faith in a particular religion or cause but faith that their action will transform the world.

Does it? Back in 1982, academic Thomas Snitch attempted to answer the question through a rigorous analysis of 721 successful and attempted assassinations
carried out between 1968 and 1980 in 123 countries. His findings, published in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, identified
assassinations as key catalysts for cycles of violence which often worked to the advantage of their perpetrators.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Snitch wrote: &quot;The terrorist campaign begins with a major event, such as an assassination, or it may take the form of continuous violent harassment. This
">

precipitates media coverage and recognition of the terrorists' philosophy. By attempting to respond to the terrorists, the government thereby grants the
group a type of temporary legitimacy.&quot;

Put simply, theatrical acts of violence - howsoever repugnant societies find them, and however illegitimate the cause that underpins them might be - compel
acknowledgment of, and engagement with, the causes of their perpetrators.

In a provocative 1972 assessment for the International Studies Quarterly, Harvard University's J. Bowyer Bell discussed the impact of assassinations carried
out by Zionist terror groups fighting for the creation of Israel.

&quot;While no one can rearrange the pieces of past history and replay the game,&quot; Bell argued, &quot;there is very little to indicate that the British intended to
withdraw from the Palestine Mandate after 1945.&quot; In the wake of the Zionist terror campaign, though, they changed course. This was not, Bell wrote, because
terrorism forced &quot;the British to withdraw, the triumph of a handful against an Empire. Nor alone did American pressure or the state of the British economy
or any one of several factors force the eventual British evacuation of Palestine.&quot; But &quot;without terror the British might well have been willing to remain
entangled in the Palestine problem or at least to postpone withdrawal for strategic reasons.&quot;

His conclusion was stark: &quot;Popular rhetoric contends that terror does not pay; but the weight of evidence in this case study indicates that a minimum number
of men can have a disproportionate effect on established policy - although they cannot necessarily either determine that policy or win on their own.&quot;

It is clear, though, that assassinations do not help to meet their perpetrators' ends in all historical circumstances. In June 1914, assassins seeking to
carve off a Greater Serbia from the Austro-Hungarian Empire assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife. While the murders sparked off

Showcasing independence

While there were no major announcements of the sort that could have turned the French President Nicolas Sarkozy's recent two-day visit to India into a special
event, the long-term gains from this interaction at the highest political level should not be minimised. There was probably not enough time for much groundwork
to be done in the period between Mr. Sarkozy's assumption of office in May 2007 and his arrival as the chief guest for the 2008 Republic Day parad e. Nevertheless,
it became evident during the course of the visit that New Delhi and Paris share commonalities in their strategic approach to the world of today. Mr. Sarkozy
might be less critical than some of his immediate predecessors were about the foreign policy of the United States. However, there is little reason to think
the French will ever become camp followers of the Americans, the way the British under both Labour and Tory dispensations have proved to be. The settling
of a frozen text of a bilateral agreement on cooperation in the civilian nuclear field before the Nuclear Suppliers Group has amended its guidelines is
testimony to Paris's independent course. It bears recall that France refused to impose sanctions after the 1974 and 1998 nuclear explosions in Pokhran.
After failing to sign an agreement on civilian nuclear cooperation with Russia, presumably out of fear of displeasing Washington, the Indian government
had no choice but to settle for a frozen text with France, which certainly has much to offer India in this field. Showcasing the French connection on Rajpath
provided a useful validation of the arguments put forward by those who have pressed for an independent course in international affairs that recognises
that the world today is not unipolar but multipolar.

Two other areas in the bilateral relationship came into focus during Mr. Sarkozy's visit. The first is France as a major military supplier. French-supplied
equipment has served the Indian armed forces well and Paris is pushing actively for diversification of India's defence acquisitions. It has had to swallow
its bitter disappointment over the abrupt cancellation of the Eurocopter deal. Dassault, the French aviation major, is one of six contenders for a $10
billion contract to supply the Air Force with 126 fighter planes. With technologies developing rapidly in different parts of the world, diversification
will help India's military sharpen its cutting edge. The second area is intelligence sharing to combat terrorism. Not only are the French intelligence
services among the most competent in the world, they can draw on resources that cannot be as easily accessed by agencies with an Anglophone orientation.

A champion and a star

It isn't often that a Grand Slam tennis tournament delivers twins: a brave new champion and a bright new star. By doing so, the Australian Open has thrown
up a whole new dimension to the world of men's tennis. That Novak Djokovic and unseeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga reached the final of this Grand Slam event signals
a shift in the balance in the highest reaches of world tennis. That the two could produce a final of such remarkable quality suggests that the game is
n o longer dominated by two superstars - the great Roger Federer (whose run of 10 successive Grand Slam final appearances ended with this tournament) and
the resolute Rafael Nadal (the only real threat to the world number one over the last few years). Djokovic's victory in the four-set final, marked by a
curious mix of raw power and silken finesse, was waiting to happen. The lanky Serbian, whose lack of one big weapon is more than compensated by an extraordinarily
well-honed set of all-court skills, had a wonderful 2007, in which he reached the U.S. Open final, won five ATP titles, beat Nadal twice in straight sets,
and defeated Federer once. The world number one, who has never given the Serb his due, dismissed that defeat as &quot;insignificant.&quot; But Federer can hardly
say the same of his straight-set semi-final loss in the Australian Open, where he was hunting for his 13th Grand Slam, a title that would have moved him
ahead of Roy Emerson and brought him just one behind Pete Sampras' record haul. In this match, he was out-served and out-hit from the baseline - in a word,
outclassed.

If Djokovic's victory was a date with destiny, Tsonga's march to the finals seemed like the stuff of sheer caprice. Nobody could have predicted that this
feisty Frenchman - who just seven months ago was ranked a lowly 178 and consigned to slugging away at an inconsequential tournament in Surrey while the
French Open was under way - would come this far. His demolition of Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals through a beguiling mix of brute force and gossamer-like
drop shots and touch volleys capped a string of comfortable victories against prominent players such as Andy Murray, Richard Gasquet, and Mikhail Youzhny.
If Tsonga's game is like a breath of fresh air, it is because he never plays the percentages; free-stroking, instinctive, and uninhibited, he plays tennis
that seems tethered to nothing but his audacious self-confidence. Tsonga is no flash in the pan, but how far he will go depends on how he copes with injury,
which has dogged him since 2005, and whether he can sustain his power and speed on court. If this endearing Frenchman stays on course, he and Djokovic
can certainly reshape the future of men's tennis.

Return to the spirit of 2004

Malini Parthasarathy

The Congress must give up its defensive mentality and understand that just because leaders and parties win elections, their ideological challenges to the
democratic structure do not become legitimate.

In these last several weeks that have followed the election victories of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, the party is suffused
with a new political energy. It is buoyed by the victory of its controversial icon Narendra Modi in Gujarat and is wasting no time in converting these
successes into crucial political capital before the Lok Sabha elections scheduled for next year. The Congress party, on the other hand, is showing distinct
signs of disori entation as a result of this political outcome, with a sense of listlessness clearly discernible in its approach. Such a fainthearted response
is unwarranted and unbecoming of a party that seized the high ground in the 2004 general election and exuberantly took up the reins of governance with
the promise of bringing India back to its original moorings in secular democracy.

In the summer of 2004, the Congress party appeared to have recast itself as a new political machine specially designed to take on the new post-globalisation
and post-Hindutva ground realities. It was able to wrest power from the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance on the basis of its pointed rejection of the
excluding implications of the NDA's economic policies and its divisive social policies. The Congress, shedding much of its earlier ideological crustiness,
was able to convince the Indian voter that it could sustain the high growth trajectory without compromising on the imperative of ensuring equal access
of all citizens to that prosperity. The powerful allure of the symbolism of the combined leadership of Sonia Gandhi, representing the party's traditional
commitment to the poor and the deprived, and Manmohan Singh, the iconic reformer taking India on a higher trajectory of economic growth, thus fulfilling
the dreams of many a middle-class Indian, ensured the Congress a triumphant return to the centre of the political arena. From that moment, as the leading
party of the governing coalition, the United Progressive Alliance, the Congress has had an unprecedented opportunity to rebuild the centre of the Indian
political field, making the revitalisation of Indian democracy its main focus.

Yet as a political entity, the Congress party appears singularly unable to transcend and overcome its traditional failings. As often noted, its first problem
is its intrinsic vulnerability as a political organisation with its over-dependence on the political charisma of the dynastic leadership of the Nehru-Gandhis.
This, in turn, shuts out the possibility of adding new heroes or heroines to its pantheon. Thus a Manmohan Singh who has caught the imagination of middle-class
India because of his persistent espousal of policies that break the mould as regards the economy and international relations cannot be projected as a counterpoint
to an Atal Bihari Vajpayee, thereby leaving large swathes of middle-class constituencies ripe for the BJP's picking. The alacrity with which the BJP launches
new leaders and new heroes, at the national level and at the level of the States even as it gives its veterans a larger-than-life stature, has a powerful
pull on the public imagination. More importantly, the BJP's continuous projection of itself as a dynamic political organisation, blending reverence for
the old with a lively appreciation of the new, contrasts sharply with the self-perception of the Congress party - which in times of failure tends to retreat
into a shell, emerging only to defend its leaders rather than stand by its policies or beliefs.

The party's &quot;introspection meeting,&quot; held soon after its defeat in the Gujarat Assembly elections, shied away from taking the bull by the horns. It blamed
itself for not effectively countering Mr. Modi's &quot;playing of the communal card&quot; after Ms Sonia Gandhi's &quot;maut ke saudagar&quot; (merchants of death) statement
and after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's &quot;misquoted&quot; observation that the Congress would reopen the Godhra riot cases. The only other point made was that
by failing effectively to counter Mr. Modi's verbal attacks on the Congress leadership, the party unwittingly allowed him to equate himself with Dr. Singh
and Ms Gandhi. Ironically, it was also left to the lower-rung leaders of the Gujarat party unit to take the blame for the defeat, with the general

Room for flexibility

The Reserve Bank of India's decision to keep its policy rates, the bank rate, the reverse repo and the repo rates as well as the cash reserve ratio (CRR)
unchanged, reflects the several dilemmas it is facing simultaneously. The traditional one - of reconciling the objective of price stability with the needs
of the real economy - obviously remains and is emphasised once again. However, on the eve of the latest credit policy statement, global cues seemed to
engage attention in policy debates. More than at any time in the recent past, the monetary policy has to focus on the external sector, now accounting for
40 per cent of the GDP. Specifically, the lowering of interest rates in the United States in the wake of a massive 0.75 percentage point cut in the federal
funds rate led most market participants to expect a reduction in rates by the RBI also. The reasoning, not entirely without merit in the context of the
last week's stock market meltdown, was that the U.S. initiative, in the absence of a corresponding cut in interest rates by the RBI, would increase the
flow of portfolio and other funds to India in search of a higher return. However, domestic inflation - though running below its target of 5 per cent -
continues to be a major cause for worry. Global oil prices remain high and have not yet been factored into domestic inflation figures. Besides, although
the prices of primary food articles have come down recently, the outlook on the food front is still hazy. At the global level, prices of food grains, especially
wheat and corn, are ruling at record levels and it is partly in response to this development the government sharply hiked the minimum support price for
wheat due for harvest soon. Unless the subsidies are increased substantially, food prices are bound to go up even after a successful harvest.

Retaining its GDP forecast for 2007-08 at 8.5 per cent, the RBI, like many other central banks, views inflation as the biggest threat to macroeconomic stability.
Its immediate aim is to contain inflation at close to 5 per cent while anchoring expectations in the region of 4 to 4.5 per cent. Money supply and bank
deposits have continued to grow ahead of their targets. Growth in non-food credit has decelerated, partly as a result of the RBI's directives to tighten
lending norms for certain overheated sectors including real estate. The RBI would continue to emphasise credit quality and credit delivery particularly
for employment-intensive sectors and pursue financial inclusion. By opting for the status quo in interest rates, the central bank has given itself some
flexibility; it can choose to modify the rates at a later date, depending on exigencies arising from domestic and global developments.

Endangered gharials

A crisis that echoes the death of a large number of vultures, mass mortality of the gharial - a freshwater crocodile found predominantly in the beautiful
Chambal river sanctuary - is cause for serious concern. A few dozen gharials have perished, apparently as a result of a mysterious liver disease, while
the population of these animals in the wild has been dropping steadily. The decline in the population of adult gharials from 436 about a decade ago to
182 in 2 006, according to World Conservation Union (IUCN) estimates, has raised international alarm. It has prompted the IUCN to classify them as critically
endangered on its Red List of species. The gharial, a fish-eating crocodile with a long snout, is now reported only from India and Nepal. Historically,
its habitat extended from the Indus in Pakistan to the Irrawaddy in Myanmar. At one time, the population of this distinctly Asian species was estimated
to be between 5,000 and 10,000. After the numbers dipped to precarious levels three decades ago, a breeding programme was undertaken; this led to the release
of hundreds of young gharial into its habitat, including the Mahanadi and Girwa. Sadly, the captive breeding efforts have failed to revive wild populations
of the gharial.

The Central government's initiative to set up a crisis management group for the gharial with help from the World Wildlife Fund offers some hope. As in the
case of the Asian vultures (which were found to be affected by the veterinary drug Diclofenac administered to cattle), a comprehensive investigation to
determine the cause of the gharial deaths and urgent remedial measures are called for. There may also be some merit in the criticism from conservationists
that poor enforcement in prime gharial nesting areas in the Chambal has created ruinous habitat disturbance. Sand mining and the hunting of fish and turtles
in the protected areas have led to the destruction of nesting sites, the depletion of fish, and the killing of gharials that accidentally get entangled
in turtle nets; poorly conceived dams, barrages, irrigation canals, and roaming livestock have added to the pressure. The Ministry of Environment and Forests
should be deeply concerned that looming risks for wildlife are discovered, typically by conservation-minded independent researchers, long after they have
reached the critical point. A continuous monitoring of wildlife with scientific rigour could help flag these threats early. That task requires a strong
partnership between research scientists and the Ministry. And it could start with a rejuvenated Project Crocodile to protect the gharial and other Chambal
species.

Overcoming the stigma of leprosy

Navin Chawla

India has achieved the goal of leprosy elimination as a public health problem. It is yet to overcome the stigma that attaches to the leprosy-affected and
their families, who suffer social exclusion and ostracism.

Today, as we recall Mahatma Gandhi's martyrdom, we also observe Anti-Leprosy Day. For it was a milestone in the struggle against the disease and its attendant
problems when Gandhiji personally nursed Parchure Shastri, a leprosy sufferer in his Sevagram Ashram. Shastri, a Sanskrit scholar, was his friend and jail-mate
from his Yeravada Jail days in 1932. Shunned and humiliated all his life, he asked Gandhiji whether he could live and die in Sevagram. Gandhiji of cours
e admitted Shastri but added that he would not give him permission to die! If only one knows how prevalent the stigma against the leprosy-affected is today,
can one possibly measure how much greater it was in Gandhiji's time? Hence the importance of Gandhiji's real and symbolic involvement for more than five
people who at the time suffered from the disease and its attendant hardships.

I do not know that many readers will even go this far in reading this article, because we not only shun the leprosy-affected, we also don't want to know
about it. Let me tell you a little about the enormity of its stigma by giving just two examples. Some years ago, Vinod (name changed) managed to get a
job at a petrol station in Delhi. In anticipation of any problem arising in the future, his employer was shown a medical certificate that proved the boy
had not contracted leprosy from his parents, who had once suffered from the disease but were completely cured. A few weeks later the employer was to describe
Vinod as one of his best workers. Yet a month later Vinod was sacked. His fault? His mother had come to his workplace to inform him about the death of
a relative. Her ulcerated hands and feet, covered by the telltale bandages that have become the hallmark of leprosy sufferers, brought the focus of the
disease on Vinod. The entire workforce at the petrol station threatened to quit if Vinod was not instantly sacked. The employer said he was sorry, but
what could he do? Vinod somehow managed to obtain a job in a restaurant, as he had once worked as a waiter. Seeing that his residential address was a leprosy
colony in Delhi, he was not given the waiter's job. Instead he was made to carry heavy crates of soft drinks on his head from one outlet to another. His
health weakened and he contracted tuberculosis and had to leave the job.

Let me provide a more recent example. An NGO wished to provide medication (basically to change bandages and treat ulcerated wounds) to ex-patients outside
a temple in New Delhi. This NGO sought to borrow a hall for just a few hours a week when it was not being put to use, from another NGO that owned a building
in the vicinity. Most of these wheelchair-bound affected persons are what are called &quot;burnt out cases.&quot; They are persons in whom the leprosy bacteria have
long since been treated and cured, but because they suffered permanent nerve damage, they can no longer feel sensation, neither pain nor heat nor cold,
which is why when they injure themselves, they ulcerate. The administrator of the second NGO - &quot;the best in the country&quot; - was asked whether he would spare
a hall on Thursday mornings? On persistent enquiries, he answered his telephone to say, not particularly apologetically either, that when he had brought
this request to the attention of his Board, they regretted that if leprosy patients of any description were allowed to be treated in their hall, even for
a few hours, their &quot;normal&quot; patients would &quot;run away.&quot; Having been associated with this field for over 30 years, I was not surprised to hear this, but
it was saddening that attitudes among the educated had not significantly changed over time.

What needs to be said at the outset is that leprosy is easily and completely curable. It is a medieval notion to think of it as a visitation of past life
sins as many still believe. We are much more likely to catch a cold and cough than we are to contract leprosy, because the Laprae bacteria incubate very
slowly. Its first tell-tale signs sometimes take several years to manifest, and if the disease is treated even at that time, the infection can be halted
in a matter of a few months. Its complete cure can take up to two to three years. In such cases, no nerve damage occurs, no damage to noses and eyes, and
none of the attendant

All's not well that ends well

The exoneration of Harbhajan Singh on a charge of racist abuse of the Australian all-rounder, Andrew Symonds, was almost inevitable. Following a report
by the umpires acting on a complaint made by Australia's captain Ricky Ponting, the match referee, Mike Proctor, found the Indian off-spinner guilty of
calling Symonds a &quot;monkey&quot; or a &quot;big monkey&quot; - in a heated exchange initiated by the Australian on the third day of the second Test at Sy dney. Since this
was a level 3.3 offence under the International Cricket Council's Code of Conduct, Harbhajan was banned from three Tests. An appeal was filed immediately
and he was allowed to play on in the series. In a diplomatic move that helped defuse the crisis, the two boards persuaded the ICC-appointed Appeals Commissioner
to delay the hearing date until after the fourth Test. By this time, it became evident that there was no strong (YouTubable or podcastable) evidence, such
as a stump mike recording, of what Harbhajan had said to Symonds. It was always highly probable that a trained judge who would look rigorously and objectively
at the facts and the evidence, apply a higher standard of proof than the civil standard of the balance of probabilities, and see the behaviour in context
would overturn the judgment of a lay match referee who, to his credit, first doubted his own competence to conduct the hearing and then rushed to inept
judgment.

In the event, Appeals Commissioner John Hansen, a High Court judge and former cricketer from New Zealand, did a beautiful job of framing the rules, sifting
and weighing the evidence, and elucidating the legal and also spirit of cricket issues. His 8000-word judgment (accessible at
www.thehindu.com

), a model of fair play, must be made required reading for all ICC-appointed match referees, appeals commissioners, captains, umpires, and board officials.
His clarification of the context is that Harbhajan &quot;innocently and in the tradition of the game acknowledged the quality of .[Brett] Lee's bowling&quot; and
that Symonds, who had &quot;nothing to do&quot; with that interchange, &quot;determined to get involved and as a result was abusive&quot; towards the Indian cricketer. In
Justice Hansen's view, even if Harbhajan had used the words alleged, an &quot;ordinary person&quot; standing in the shoes of Symonds &quot;who had launched an unprovoked
and unnecessary invective-laden attack would not be offended or insulted or humiliated in terms of 3.3.&quot; Nevertheless, Harbhajan - a four-time offender
against the Code of Conduct prior to Sydney - can count himself lucky in getting away with a conviction under 2.8 and the trifling penalty of half his
match fee (partly because the judge was not informed in time by the ICC of three of the four previous infractions). Racism is a grave offence in sport
and the poignant fact is that Symonds, a black cricketer who was at the receiving end of some ugly 'monkey gestures' from the stands during Australia's
last tour of India, believed that Harbhajan had for the second time called him a &quot;monkey.&quot; Indian cricket may pat itself on the back for winning this final
encounter following a four-Test series in which it played splendid cricket to challenge the hegemony of cricket's superpower, Australia. What was indefensible,
from the standpoint of the spirit of cricket, was the BCCI's unsporting tactics to pre-empt due process and the threats or implied threats to call off
the tour. By behaving very much like cricket's bullying financial superpower, it has lost goodwill round the cricket world.

Unfulfilled promises

The 60th anniversary of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an occasion for sober introspection as the lofty principles enunciated in the
historic charter largely remain in the realm of unfulfilled promises. The Declaration, endorsed unanimously by the nascent United Nations of 58 member
states, was the first-ever international proclamation on the most basic rights and fundamental freedoms for mankind. The text was a legally non-binding
statement of objective s. Nevertheless, the broad consensus was a stupendous achievement, given the conflicting political ideologies, religious persuasions,
and ethnic and cultural particularities that threatened further fragmentation in a world recovering from the horrors of the two wars. Two decades elapsed
before the member states took another leap and accorded legal protection to civil, social, and cultural rights through two covenants in 1966. These advances
were followed by the adoption of the core human rights conventions that outlaw violence against women, torture and racism and the codification of the rights
of children.

The recent constitution of Human Rights Council as a direct subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, was backed by 170 countries; a notable exception was
the United States. But the new body has been bogged down in debates on implementation. Countries from the third world, having a sizable representation,
should leverage their combined strength to garner support for livelihood concerns affecting millions, such as debt-relief and reform of subsidies on farm
product exports to the developing and least developed countries. They must at the same time reckon that any realistic prospect of their achieving the 2015
millennium development goals depends on making progress in the area of human rights.

A return to Cold War climate on U.K. campuses?

Hasan Suroor

There is widespread principled opposition to the idea of treating students from a particular religious group as suspects in the absence of any evidence
that they have broken the law.

Mohammed Hanif (not his real name) is a fresh undergraduate in a British university. He comes from a conservative Bangladeshi immigrant family, describes
himself as a &quot;devout&quot; Muslim, sports a beard, observes Ramzan and offers prayers five times a day even if, on occasions, it means skipping the class. And,
sometimes, he goes along with friends to meetings of radical Islamic guest speakers on the campus.

Does all this add up to &quot;extremist&quot; behaviour? And should his teachers be concerned about his activities to alert the police before he is snapped up by
the Al-Qaeda and turned into a suicide bomber? Students such as Hanif fear that they may end up being &quot;targeted&quot; as a result of the British government's
new &quot;guidance&quot; to universities on tackling Islamist extremism.

Under the guidelines, university and college authorities are required, effectively, to inform the police if they detect signs of extremist behaviour among
Muslim students. Although the term used is &quot;monitoring,&quot; critics say it is a euphemism for &quot;spying.&quot; With no concrete definition of &quot;extremist behaviour&quot;
in the guidelines, the field is left wide open for universities to interpret it the way they like. There is concern that this is likely to lead to an open
season on religious Muslim students in the current climate of Islamophobia.

It was precisely because of such fears that the Blair government was forced to back down on a similar plan, two years ago, to co-opt universities and colleges
in fighting Muslim radicalism. The academic community refused to be party to what, it believed, amounted to turning universities into an extension of M15
and Scotland Yard.

With memories of the anti-communist witch-hunt of the Cold War era still fresh, the move was likened to &quot;anti-Muslim McCarthyism&quot; and met with almost unanimous
opposition from teachers and student groups. The University and College Union (UCU), Britain's largest trade union of academics, rejected the plan arguing
that it would &quot;jeopardise trust and confidence between staff and students.&quot;

&quot;Members may be sucked into an anti-Muslim McCarthyism which has serious consequences for civil liberties by blurring the boundaries of what is illegal
and what is possibly undesirable,&quot; the then UCU joint general-secretary Paul Mackney said. The plan was also rejected by student organisations, which saw
it as an attack on academic freedom and warned that it would poison teacher-student relations. &quot;Turning campuses into some sort of a quasi-secret service
is dangerous,&quot; an official of the National Union of Students said at the time.

Vice-Chancellors were equally vehement in opposing the move. Universities UK, which represents Vice-Chancellors, called it divisive, &quot;unreasonable&quot; and
potentially &quot;counterproductive,&quot; arguing that it was likely to further alienate young Muslims and make them more vulnerable to the &quot;jihadi&quot; propaganda.
Instead, they emphasised the need for a strategy to win the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of students who showed signs of disaffection or an inclination towards radicalisation.

Last week, the government brought in revised &quot;guidance&quot; after wider consultations. But the revision doesn't go far enough. Despite its relatively softly-softly
language, in essence the &quot;updated&quot; document is little different. It retains the basic premise of government policy - that universities should help (critics
call it &quot;collaboration&quot;) in fighting Islamist extremism by working with security services to identify potential suspects.

Rather helpfully, the government has also provided them a broad profile of what kind of students to look out for. They are likely to be young, &quot;generally
younger than 30 and male&quot; - the sort of students found to be potential recruits for radical groups. While the focus remains on male students, female students
- the government says - are also becoming increasingly radicalised with the number of women who &quot;support and participate in violent extremism&quot; said to
be on the rise.

The government says universities have become recruiting grounds for the Al-Qaeda and other radical groups and it is important to protect impressionable
students from attempts to brainwash them. Unveiling the plan, Higher Education Minister Bill Rammell said the threat of violent extremism from universities
was &quot;real and serious&quot; but, in the same breath, admitted that it was &quot;not

From despair to hope

The Bharatiya Janata Party's recent national council meeting showcased a party brimming with confidence about its future. The feeling is not entirely misplaced.
Four years after it lost power at the Centre, the principal opposition party has bounced back, defying sceptics who were too quick to write it off. Just
months ago, the BJP seemed in dire straits - riven by factionalism, without focus, and desolate after its rout in Uttar Pradesh. For former U.P. Chief
Minister and party chief Rajnath Singh, the election in his home State was a personal test that he failed. So what accounts for the mood change? The emergence
of Lal Krishna Advani as the BJP's shadow Prime Minister followed by two successive electoral triumphs - in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. For Mr. Advani,
the invitation was nothing if not sweet revenge: in 2005 the BJP-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh combine forced his exit from the party's job on account of
his appreciation of Mohammad Ali Jinnah's August 1947 secular vision. Two years later, party and parivar were unanimous that he should be leading the BJP
into the next election. What better proof of this political mood change than the standing ovation he received from the 3000-plus delegates attending the
national council?

Today with the leadership issue settled, and Gujarat retained by the new saffron hero, Narendra Modi, the BJP looks more united than in a long, long time.
That the party is focussed on the 15th general election, and is in agenda-setting mode, is evident from its overture to the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK and
the decision to reserve 33 per cent of party posts for women. The Congress has responded positively to the latter decision but seems unconcerned by the
state of the United Progressive Alliance. Does all this portend a National Democratic Alliance victory in 2009? Not by a long shot. The BJP has visibly
recovered from its 2004 defeat but the NDA is far from looking the winner. Since 2002, as many as nine constituents have parted ways with the BJP and the
NDA. This does not include the Telugu Desam Party, which was the NDA's biggest outside prop, and the Trinamool Congress, which seems on the verge of quitting
the alliance. Should BJP stalwarts introspect on this, they will discover a pattern: the deserters uniformly cited the party's anti-Muslim policy as the
reason for quitting the NDA. To be sure, politics has made strange bedfellows in the past, and the BJP's dream of expanding the NDA may yet come to fruition.
But many of the Hindutva party's former allies need the Muslim vote more than they need the BJP. Indeed, there is a lesson in this for those who are in
a hurry to anoint Mr. Modi as the BJP's next great white hope.

A two-horse race

The race for the Republican Party's nomination for the November 2008 U.S. presidential election has acquired definite shape much earlier than was expected
when campaigning got under way in 2007. The list of candidates was longer than usual and at least four of them attained front-runner status during various
stages of the campaign. The strains within the party added to the complexity of the race. Not only has the divide between the 'moderates' and ' right-wingers'
widened over the past seven years of the Bush presidency, the three strands of the conservative movement also appeared to have fallen out with one another.
Given these conditions, it seemed likely that more than a couple of candidates would vie for the support of key constituents until close to the end of
the primary season. With John McCain and Mitt Romney finishing first and second in the Florida primary held on January 28, projections of this sort are
no longer valid. Fred Thompson, once considered a Reaganesque resuscitator of the party's fortunes, faded out after the primaries and caucuses held in
Iowa, New Hampshire, Michigan, and South Carolina. Mike Huckabee, whose candidature became viable after his surprising victory in Iowa, could not replicate
the miracle despite his strong religious bent of mind. Then there was Rudy Giuliani whose campaign message, as one detractor famously put it, comprised
&quot;a noun, a verb, and 9/11.&quot; The former New York Mayor concentrated most of his resources in Florida, believing that a resounding victory in this swing
State would enable him to storm the remainder by claiming to be the only person strong enough to combat terrorism. After his poor third place performance,
Mr. Giuliani has thrown in the towel and endorsed Mr. McCain.

Even Mr. McCain's critics within the Republican Party have conceded that he would be their best bet in the presidential campaign in view of the support
he draws from voters registered as independents. However, the Senator from Arizona is regarded as a maverick by the ideologically committed among the party's
rank and file who have an overwhelming say in picking the nominee. His victories in New Hampshire and South Carolina were discounted to a certain extent
since independents are allowed to participate in party primaries in these two States. In taking Florida in a contest open only to Republicans, Mr. McCain
has proved he can attract the party faithful. While Mr. Romney with his formidable financial resources is very much in this two-horse race, there are early
signs that the Republican establishment is closing ranks behind the man from Arizona.

A week is a long time in politics

Ramesh Thakur

Barack Obama has reframed the contest in terms of the past versus the future and the choice between status quo and change.

The American election is the gift that keeps on giving. Normal may be just a cycle in the washing machine; there is nothing normal about this election cycle.
Received wisdom is being upended as routinely as public opinion polls are. For Indians, the politics of vote banks is starting to find a disturbing echo
in the primary campaign. It all makes for a riveting spectator sport.

Having listened to the folks of New Hampshire in the week before the primary, Hillary Clinton famously found her own voice. In South Carolina that voice
was drowned by her husband's. The voters recoiled but it does not as yet make her history. The election of a woman or an African-American as the Democratic
candidate is history-in-the-making. That sense of destiny, reinforced by the iconic Kennedy clan's endorsement of Barack Obama, has captured the international
imagination as well. In an article in Sunday's New York Times evocatively titled &quot;A president like my father,&quot; Caroline Kennedy wrote that in Mr. Obama
she saw an echo of the force of inspiration that people told her they had felt with her father but she herself had never experienced. She was supporting
Mr. Obama for a mix of &quot;patriotic, political and personal&quot; reasons that are intertwined. Touchingly, it was her children who first made her realise that
Mr. Obama &quot;is the president we need&quot;.

The &quot;dog whistle&quot; style of politics refers to the use of coded language addressed to a voting constituency. Like dogs who can hear a whistle too high-pitched
for the human ear, they grasp the message that cannot be pinpointed in the actual text by critics. The Clintons' strategy has been to appear to be seeking
the black vote in South Carolina where Africa-Americans make up half the Democratic constituency, lose it, and then benefit from the white and Latino backlash
in the rest of the country. The more that Bill Clinton appealed to black voters to back his wife and the more they spurned her, the more he hoped to succeed
in turning the election into one on race, to Mr. Obama's ultimate loss. For example, Sergio Bendixen from the Clinton campaign was quoted as saying &quot;The
Hispanic voter has not shown a lot of willingness or affinity to support black candidates.&quot; In the debate on January 15, Tim Russert of the NBC read out
the quote to Clinton who, rather than repudiate it, responded that Mr. Bendixen &quot;was making a historical statement.&quot;

But the decisive 55:27 per cent margin of victory in South Carolina undercut this strategy of marginalising Mr. Obama as merely a candidate of black America.
Unlike Jesse Jackson in the 1980s, Mr. Obama has successfully transcended racial identity to appeal to all Americans. He lost to Hillary among white women;
he held his own with her among white men; and he outpolled her among white youth. She lost the black male and female vote decisively. Hence Mr. Obama's
tribute to the diversity of his coalition.

The tawdry final week of South Carolina brought too many painful reminders of how the Clintons soil almost everything they touch. For the first time, with
vintage Clinton tactics turned against one of their own, many Democrats began to &quot;get&quot; why the Clintons provoke so much hatred from the Republicans. Thus
said William Greider in The Nation - the bastion of left-liberal journalism in America: &quot;The Clintons play dirty when they feel threatened ... High-minded
and self-important on the surface, smarmily duplicitous underneath, meanwhile jabbing hard to the groin area&quot; (January 23). Many others have picked up
on the theme of the Clintons as self-pitying narcissists who will try every trick to destroy anyone impertinent enough to stand between them and the White
House.

The good that Bill Clinton did was real - as his admirers ask, which part of his double legacy do you not understand, &quot;peace&quot; or prosperity&quot; - but belongs
to the 1990s. The damage that he might cause from this point on is considerable. He has belittled and denigrated Mr. Obama, brushing aside the early, principled
and consistent opposition to the Iraq war as a fairytale. He warned the people of Iowa against rolling the dice by choosing Mr. Obama. If that was a gamble
on the unknown, columnist Maureen Dowd commented caustically, voting for Hillary would guarantee an endless rerun of the Clinton soap opera in the White
House. Bill Clinton has snarled and wagged his fingers angrily at reporters, thereby ensuring a hostile press.

Most tellingly,

The unending farm tragedy

The death by suicide of over 17,000 farmers in 2006, the latest year for which systematic official data are available, is a huge national tragedy. And the
trends revealed by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on farm suicides are appalling. While there have been ups and downs in the annual figures,
there has been no let up in the trend since 2001. The figure for 1997, in itself disturbing, was under 14,000. From 2002, there has been no year in which
fewer than 17,000 farmers' suicides have been recorded. The 2006 figure confirms the trend. Worse, in the group of four or five States that account for
close to two-thirds of all farmers' suicides in India, the spike is relentless. Meanwhile, a slew of government announcements, programmes, and 'relief
packages' make little impact. Such packages, totalling nearly Rs.5,000 crore, were unveiled in Maharashtra's troubled Vidharbha region in 2006. Yet that
very year, Maharashtra recorded the worst figure ever for any State.

Farm incomes remain dismal. The government has begun to speak of measures such as loan waivers, and low interest loans to tackle what is clearly the worst
agrarian crisis India has faced in decades. At one level, this response is welcome as it seems to recognise that the suicides are a symptom of a much larger
crisis that needs to be addressed deeply. At another level, the delayed response is baffling. Many of the measures now 'contemplated' were strongly recommended
by the National Commission on Farmers headed by M.S.Swaminathan. As early as 2006, the NCF called for urgency in steps such as a price stabilisation fund.
What prevented forward movement on any of these for two years? This is not a divisive issue, with most political parties and farm unions demanding the
implementation of the NCF's recommendations, which were much wider in scope than the measures the government now 'contemplates.' While a loan waiver will
provide greatly needed relief, it is not in itself a solution. It has to go with a sea change in policy and approach towards agriculture. The piecemeal
give-a-man-a-cow approach has proved pathetically inadequate. We need, among other things, far greater public investment in agriculture and farm technology;
a risk stabilisation fund; low interest (in dryland regions, interest-free) loans for subsistence farmers; a five-year credit cycle that allows farmers
breathing space where now they beg for it each season; the revival of food crop and a steady move towards low-cost farming operations; and a public domain
approach to water. Indeed, a radical change of mindset. We cannot have packages that work in one direction while larger policies push in another.

Rhinos in peril

The steady toll taken by poaching of wildlife in the national parks and sanctuaries is deeply worrying. The death of a large number of one-horned rhinoceroses
last year in the Kaziranga National Park, virtually the last bastion of the animal, should have moved the Central government to launch urgent measures.
Shockingly, 2008 has begun with more brazen poaching of the critically endangered rhino. The crisis that has overtaken Kaziranga is particularly distressing
because, unlike many other protected areas, it invested early in armed protection and acted unflinchingly against poachers. Historically, the rhinoceros
came under pressure in the late 19th and early 20th centuries owing to the demand for cultivable land and from hunting. Its numbers dropped so precipitously
that Assam's colonial administrators created reserved forests as far back as 1908 in the vicinity of Kaziranga. A ban on hunting was imposed locally long
before enlightened legislation on wildlife protection was enacted by independent India, in 1972. Poaching continued because of the lucrative trade in rhino
horn, but protection succeeded in raising Kaziranga's rhino population to an estimated 1,855 in 2006. The recent spurt in killing is a huge blow to this
UNESCO world heritage site.

The poaching crisis national parks face imperils the future of charismatic animals like the tiger, rhino, and elephant. Members of the National Board of
Wildlife have expressed concern that conservation gets mostly lip service in policy-making, although the Board is headed by a Prime Minister who is enthusiastic
about conservation. Why, for example, has there been no serious effort to rejuvenate the anti-poaching wing of the Forest Department and put it on a professional
footing in all the States? The serious setback at Kaziranga spotlights India's failure to take the protection agenda seriously. Although the park has expanded
to about 900 square kilometres from 430, there has been no proportionate increase in the strength of a capable field staff, which has been greying. The
Central government's Tiger Task Force pointed out in 2005 that the average age of field guards in the reserves was 42 and nearly a fifth of sanctioned
posts in tiger reserves were vacant. The Central government must ensure that a professional, well-equipped, and trained protection framework is instituted
in the national parks. The Wildlife Crime Bureau under the MoEF holds some promise, but it needs enforcement staff in all the States and a culture of accountability.
Unless the system is shaken up urgently, India's great natural heritage of wildlife and biodiversity will be irreversibly impoverished.

The humbug called Gujarat model statecraft

Harish Khare

As it seeks to win the nation's confidence as the next ruling party, the BJP should stay clear of the allurement of the so-called Gujarat model.

Just a day after the Bharatiya Janata Party tried its best to convince the country that it was ready under the refurbished leadership of Lal Krishna Advani
to help us find our way to some kind of institutional sanity out of our over-heated political partisanship, it organised a &quot;march&quot; to the Nirvachan Sadan,
pressuring the Chief Election Commissioner, N. Gopalaswami, to see merit in its frivolously partisan petition against Election Commissioner Navin Chawla.
For a party that would like the middle classes to believe that it is re-committing itself to the notions of good governance, rescuing our institutions
from personal agendas, this blatant attempt to politicise a constitutional office was hardly calculated to reassure the nation that the BJP is any wiser
after its six years of non-performance in office and after four years of irresponsible opposition to the United Progressive Alliance government. Pettiness
and small-mindedness are not exactly the qualities that ensure forward-looking governance.

Contrast this cocksure anti-Chawla pettiness with the confusion over the so-called &quot;Gujarat model&quot; at the party's just-concluded national council. Ever
since the BJP registered a famous victory in Gujarat in December 2007, the party - or at least a section of its leadership - has given the impression that
Narendra Modi has invented the winning formula which can be and should be replicated outside Gujarat. A large number of retired (and frustrated) bureaucrats
and &quot;security experts&quot; have expressed the view that Mr. Modi is the idea whose time has come. And, in his opening remarks at the national executive last
Sunday before the national council, the party president, Rajnath Singh, did manage to create the impression that he was asking the BJP's other Chief Ministers
to emulate Mr. Modi's formula for beating the anti-incumbency syndrome.

It was no coincidence that the day the BJP national council began its deliberations the Gujarat government chose to put in full-page paid advertisements
in newspapers, extolling the &quot;Gujarat model,&quot; based on three claims: a strong, honest and efficient leadership; transparent governance that nurtures innovations;
and a vision to make development a people's movement. It was Mr. Modi's calling card. With many photographs of the Chief Minister adorning the page, there
was no mistaking that the focus was on &quot;strong leadership's stupendous achievements.&quot; And, again, it was no coincidence that no national iconic leaders
- Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani or Rajnath Singh - found a mention in the full-page advertisement. The &quot;strong leader&quot; does not like to share his space
with other leaders, however tall.

No marked enthusiasm

It was also no coincidence that there was no particularly marked enthusiasm for the &quot;Gujarat model&quot; in the two neighbouring States of Rajasthan and Madhya
Pradesh, both ruled by the BJP, with comparatively young and clean Chief Ministers, enjoying comfortable legislative majorities. If these two Chief Ministers
were to commission similar full-page advertisements, any reasonably competent public relations outfit would be able to coin equally comforting phrases
and claims made in the &quot;Gujarat model.&quot; What these two Chief Ministers may not be able - and even may not like - to assert is the claim to &quot;strong leadership,&quot;
with all its not-so-comforting connotations. Minus this &quot;strong leadership&quot; narrative, the claims of &quot;performance&quot; and &quot;achievements&quot; in the Modi model
are so Gujarat-centric that no serious student or practitioner of governance, in and out of the BJP, would be taken in.

Nor can the BJP establishment be entirely pleased with the exclusive focus in the &quot;Gujarat model&quot; on an individual, however &quot;strong,&quot; to the total exclusion
of the party's organisational robust profile. What the 2007 Gujarat battle has demonstrated is how difficult it is to win electoral contests without strong
organisational sinews; those Congress candidates who did manage to match the BJP's organisational preparedness had no difficulty in defying the &quot;Modi wave.&quot;
It is because of this organisational edge that the BJP has been winning in Gujarat since 1989, much before Mr. Modi metamorphosed into a &quot;strong leader.&quot;

Perhaps it was no surprise that the BJP's national council did not allow itself to be overwhelmed by the specious claims made in the name of the Gujarat
model.
