-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Sir Barnes Neville Wallis (September 26 1887 - October 30,1979) was a
British scientist,engineer and inventor. He is most well known for
inventing the bouncing bomb used by the Royal Air Force on Operation
Downwood to attack German dams in the Ruhr area during the Second World
War. Following his achievements with bouncing bomb, immortalized in the
1954 film The Dam Busters, Wallis subsequently designed the 'Tallboy'
and 'Grand Slam' deep penetration (or 'earthquake') bombs used to attack
V1 rocket launch sites, submarine pens, other reinforced structures and
the Tirpitz. Wallis was knighted in 1968.&gt;&gt;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Neville Barnes Wallis, the son of a doctor, was born in Ripley,
Derbyshire, on 26th October, 1887. After leaving school at sixteen he
started work in a shipyard on the Thames. In 1908 he transferred to a
shipyard in Cowed and began designing ships. In 1919 Wallis was
recruited by Vickers to design airships. Together with his longtime
friend, H. B. Pratt, he designed the R.9, the R23 and the R.26. He was
also chief engineer on the R.80. Unlike the traditional Zeppelin, this
airship had a streamlined look. However, in 1921, the Chief of Air Staff
decided to bring an end to building airships. Vickers continued to feel
that airships had commercial potential and in 1924 Wallis was
commissioned to produce the R.100. It was larger than any other airship
built and did not make its maiden flight to Canada until 1930. Later
that year the R.101 crashed killing 48 members of its crew. Airships
were now considered too dangerous and the project came to an end. Wallis
was now given the task of designing planes. This included the Wellesley
that went on to set a non-stop distance record of 7,158 miles in 1938.
With the threat of war Wallis began work on the Wellington Bomber.
One novel feature of the Wellington was a vast coil that could be used
to detonate magnetic mines safely from the air. Wallis designed the
bouncing bombs that were used by Guy Gibson and the 617 Squadron to
successfully breach the Mohne and Eder dams in the Ruhr during the
Dambusters Raid on 16th May 1943. The rotating bouncing bomb skipped
over the water and exploded while sinking to the base of the retaining
wall of the dam. It produced heavy floods and badly damaged German
production in the Ruhr. When the decision was taken to concentrate on
area bombing Wallis began looking at the design of bombers that could
drop heavy bombs. The adapted Avro Lancaster was able to drop two bombs
developed by Wallis, Tallboy (1944) and Grand Slam (1945). After the war
Barnes was chief of aeronautical research and development at the British
Aircraft Corporation at Weybridge (1945-71). However, several of his
projects, including a cargo submarine, were not built. Neville Barnes
Wallis died at Leatherhead on 30th October, 1979.&gt;&gt;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Barnes Neville Wallis, Sir an aeronautical engineer and inventor.
Worked for Vickers Ltd. In 1916 he became chief designer, later became
chief of aeronautical research and development. Involved in the design
of the R-80 Airship which first flew in 1920. After Vickers closed the
airship department following the lost of the R-38 in 1921, Barnes Wallis
obtained an external degree in engineering from London University and in
1922 taught in Switzerland.

Because of the his success designing the R-80, Barnes Wallis was
brought back by Vickers to head the design team for, The Airship
Guarantee Company, a subsidiary of Vickers to design and build the R-100
Airship.

In 1930 he invented the geodetic form of aircraft construction used in
the design of the Wellesly and Wellington bombers and during WW2 he
designed the special bomb used by the RAF bomber squadron 617(&quot;The Dam
Busters&quot;) to attack the dams in the German Ruhr Valley.

Barnes Wallis was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1945 and was
knighted in 1968, a long overdue honour according to Morpurgo in his
book on Barnes Wallis. He considers that Wallis' blunt speaking and his
opposition to the 'establishment' at the time of the R100/R101 led to
the extended delay.

Wallis also designed the Tallboy and Grand Slam bombs, respectively
12,000 lb and 20,000 lb penetration weapons to attack the U-Boat pens
and V2 rocket sites.

After the war Barnes Wallis designed the Swallow variable-sweep wing
principle that meant the sweep of the wing can be changed in flight to
enable an aircraft to fly supersonic and also at low speeds (although
more accurately an aerodyne). Model tests were carried out, but for
various reasons the design was never exploited. Variable wing geometry
was used on the American F-111 bomber and later on the F-14 'Tomcat'
fighter and Wallis was convinced that the Americans had 'stolen' his
idea after he had approached them for funding.

He continued working until his 80's, moving from the swing wing
aircraft, to nuclear powered submarines and finally to the 'square'
aeroplane. He was involved in the development of an airborne method of
detecting magnetic mines; designed a radio telescope mounting; started
the Royal Air Force Foundation for the education of the children of RAF
personnel at Christ's Hospital; and, designed the extensions and theatre
to his old school.&gt;&gt;

The Attack of the Dam Busters

&lt;&lt;On the 16th May 1943, Squadron X, otherwise known as 617 Squadron of
Lancaster Bombers, and commanded by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, left RAF
Scampton in Lincolnshire to embark on one of the most dangerous and
remarkable bombing missions of World War II. Code named Operation
Chastise, their target was the Ruhr Valley in Germany, more
specifically, their target was the three main dams in the area the
Mhone, Eder, and Sorpe. The aim was to breach these dams and bring Nazi
Germany's industrial heartland to a crashing halt under thousands of
tons of water. Achieving this aim, however, would not be easy. The
mission took a lot of training and preparation. The pilots had to learn
to fly at low level, and fly at a level of accuracy unheard of for
pilots of that time. Also, without the genius of a brilliant scientist
called Barnes Wallis, the mission would never have been possible.

Barnes Wallis was an aircraft designer and scientist who helped design
the famous Wellington Bomber. He wanted, however, to do something that
might help Britian win the war. He struggled to get his ideas
recognised; the air ministry wanted him to concentrate on aircraft
design and not worry so much about some of what the air ministry saw as
crackpot ideas. He knew that the dams of the Ruhr Valley were a target
for the bombers, but that the RAF had no way to destroy a dam as the
amount of explosive required was more than any plane or squadron could
carry. So Wallis came up with the idea of the bouncing bomb. He
practised in his garden, firing marbles across a bowl of water, and
experimented with different shapes of ball, until he realised he could
spin a bomb across water against a dam wall that would sink and explode
underwater, which then concentrated the explosion, increasing its
effects and in theory could breech the dam wall. Finally, one of his
ideas was accepted and he was given permission to run a full trial. A
scaled down version of the bomb worked, but it took time to perfect the
full version. At first, his bomb exploded on impact with the water, to
the point were Wallis despaired over whether his idea would ever work.
However, by removing its outer casing so the bomb was now a cylinder and
not a sphere and by lowering the bombing height from 150 to 60 feet, as
long as the bomb was spinning at 500 rpm he could successfully get a
full size bomb to bounce over water. Everyone was ecstatic. The RAF had
all sorts of uses for the bomb; if it was successful against German
dams, they hoped to use a similar idea to attack naval ships (although
this plan never got off the ground). Wallis also designed the Earthquake
bombs known as Tallboy and Grand Slam that 617 Squadron would use on
later missions.

The British had wanted to destroy the Germans industrial heart land in
the Ruhr Valley almost since the war started. In 1943, the RAF were
making a concerted effort to do this with their heavy bombers against
the major towns in the Ruhr like Dortmund and Duisburg. The dams in the
Ruhr Valley, controlled the levels of the canals that were used for
transporting goods and raw materials, and to power steel plants and
munitions factories, were seen as a weak point if they could be broken.
They were only lightly defended as to breach those thick dam walls was
considered almost impossible.

Some of the best pilots in Bomber Command were assigned to a new secret
squadron known only as Squadron X. All of the crew were very experienced
and highly decorated. Most of the squadrons they had come from were
certainly not pleased to lose such prize crews, but the orders had come
from the highest authority. They had no choice, and so at the beginning
of March 1943, 617 was formed in the utmost secrecy at RAF Scampton in
Lincolnshire. For exactly what none of the air crews yet knew. All they
did know was that they would have to practice low level flying at only
250 and then 150 feet until they were experts at it. Only Guy Gibson had
any idea what the targets were going to be.

The crews trained solidly, but there were still obstacles to overcome,
such as judging height over water as altermeters of the day were very
unreliable. This problem was worsened when it became clear they would
have to fly as low as 60 feet if the bomb was going to explode
successfully. The bright idea was hit upon that they could place search
lights at the nose and tail of the plane calibrated in such away that
when the two beams crossed the plane would be flying at exactly 60 feet
(Gibson, 1946:239). This was a brilliant idea, but meant that once the
search lights were on, any anti-aircraft guns would quickly be able to
zero in on them. The other main obstacle to overcome was aiming the bomb
so it would be released at exactly the right moment. That was solved
with a special low tech bomb sight that was nothing more than a
triangular piece of wood with two points at the ends. When the points
matched up with the towers on the dam, you were the correct distance
away and the bomb could be released (Gibson, 1946:233). This simple bomb
sight had remarkable accuracy.

The crews were told their targets would be the dams of the Ruhr Valley
only just prior to flying the operation on the night of the 16/17th May
1943. They were told how the bouncing bomb would work, how it would skim
across the water, sink down against the wall of the dam explode, and
hopefully breach the dam. It was hoped the tons of water released could
cause more damage than a series of heavy bombing raids would with much
less cost to the RAF in terms of air crew life. It was now that the
crews realised why they had been training so hard at flying precisely to
such fine limits; there was no margin for error. At 60 feet over water,
if you sneezed in the wrong place, it would be curtains! It was a
daunting operation, but the crews were veterans of many operations and
many were itching to get back into combat after over two months of just
training.

Eighteen Lancaster bombers took off from Scampton to fly the hazardous
mission to Germany. The whole mission would be flown at a perilously low
level of around 100 feet, literally skimming over the trees. A first
flight of nine was led by Gibson, designated to attack the Mohne and
Eder Dams, followed by a second flight of five to attack the Sorpe and a
flying reserve of four planes to fill in the gaps (Gibson,1946:248-9).

They would fly over Holland and into Germany, hoping they would be too
low for night fighters, and their route was designed to skirt most of
the heavy flack. Two of the crews had been forced to turn back one hit
by flack. Another had actually hit the sea, recovered, but was damaged
and forced to go home (Gibson, 1946:253), although they were luckier
than some! Two of the planes heading for the Sorpe were shot down over
enemy territory (Gibson, 1946:256). One of Gibson's flight was shot down
by Flack as they reached the Ruhr Valley (Gibson, 1946:254). When they
reached the Mohne, it was more heavily defended then they had originally
hoped and a lot of flack was sent up. As commander, Gibson attacked
first. The spotlights worked like a dream. They flew at exactly 60 feet,
and when the two towers of the dam lined up in the bomb aimers sight,
the bouncing bomb was released. It was a pefect shot but the dam did not
breach. The next plane wasn't so lucky. The gunners, now wise to what
was happening, raked the plane with flack and it blew up (Gibson,
1946:258). When the next plane attacked, Gibson flew along with it to
distract the gunners, a brave but almost suicidal action, but it was
enough and a second bomb found its target. Gibson's plane began firing
at the flack gunners, and they fired back at him, but they were both out
of range. It was enough though to distract the bombers while another
bomb was succesfully dropped (Gibson, 1946:259). It took one more bomb
to breach the dam. They were not sure it had worked at first, but slowly
the water pressure brought the dam wall crashing down, and a special
code word was sent back to base to tell them the dam had been breached
and Barnes Wallis's bomb had worked (Gibson, 1946:260).

The Eder was the next target and a much harder dam to crack. There were
no defences, but it was a steeper valley, forcing a steeper dive from
the aircraft with not much time to level out and place the bomb in the
right place. One plane did not drop his bomb in the right place; he
released it too late. It hit the dam wall, exploded on impact, and the
Lancaster flying so low could not avoid the explosion (Gibson,
1946:263). Two bombs, though, did hit their target and as dawn broke,
the Eder was breached (Gibson, 1946:264). The Sorpe was not such a
success; it was an earthern dam, and harder to breach. It had to be
bombed differently with the bomb being dropped right on the dam. It
could not be breached (Gibson, 1946:261). Sixteen aircraft crossed the
sea to carry out the mission with a mix of nationalities including
Canadians, Americans, and British. Eight planes were shot down, of
those, two men survived to be taken prisoner. Fifty-four men were
killed, the cream of RAF bomber command. As Gibson summed it up, &quot;there
is not much chance at 50 feet!&quot; (1946:267). It was Barnes Wallis who
took the losses the worst; he is said to have wept exclaiming &quot;All those
boys, all those boys.&quot; To him, a lot of it had been a glorious
experiment, a chance to prove and vindicate his work, and it hadn't
really crossed his mind that people would die. That simply wasn't the
world he operated in. For the RAF, it was something they lived with but
to Barnes Wallis, it was a tragic blow.

In the years since the raid, much has been made of it. It is one of the
most famous, and perhaps overanalysed bombing raids of World War II. A
film was even made of the raid called the Dam Busters starring famous
English actor Richard Todd as Guy Gibson. Historical debate, though, is
split as to the success and effectiveness of the raid. Yes, two dams
were destroyed, and the torrents of water did cause a lot of damage and
kill around 1300 people, most of them prisoners in a work camp. It did
not cripple German industry or even shorten the war. Industry was back
up and running in the Ruhr Valley within the year and at double the
capacity. The losses among 617 Squadron were huge, and this was
magnified by the fact the Squadron was full of the best and most
experienced air crews Bomber Command had, and many have argued they were
wasted on such a mission. Gibson himself believed the damage caused was
substantial, and the deaths were the price of war. He believed it would
have cost many more lives to cause the same level of damage with
conventional bombing raids. Of course, Gibson did not have the benefit
of hindsight. He did, though, feel the losses keenly. To him, they were
just a few of many in a branch of the RAF that suffered some of the
worst losses of the war. Bomber crews rarely lived very long, and to
throw so many of the best away on one mission was perhaps a tragic
waste. On the other hand, others have argued that the mission was a
success, that any interruption to Germany's industry, no matter how
short, was still a vital contribution to the war effort. Another fact
worth considering is that after the attack the Germans were forced to
place defenses around their major dams, which were previously only
lightly defended or even totally undefended, and increased defenses here
meant they couldn't do damage to the Allies elsewhere. It also proved
the advantages of Special operations and special technology, and 617
Squadron would go on to have greater success in other operations. As
Gibson himself put it, 617 Squadron would become THE precision bombing
unit of the RAF. It was a whole new concept, a squadron that could take
out any target from low to high level day or night; the best crews using
the best equipment (1946:267). You can perhaps see in that sentiment the
birth of modern thinking of Air Force bombing and the so-called surgical
strikes we see today. As for the Germans, they were left guessing
because if the allies could hit the dams, something the Germans never
thought possible (if they had considered the threat the dams would have
always been better defended), the allies could potentially attack
anything, putting doubt in the minds of the enemy. The propaganda effect
of the raid can also not be underestimated. The raid made all the
papers; the results were of course exaggerated with the papers claiming
the raids were a decisive blow with 10,000 Germans killed and industry
destroyed. It really helped the moral of the British, still suffering
under German bombing attacks. Pictures of the breached dams were
remarkable, and while the overall long term effects of the raid may well
have been negligible, those pictures really gave the British hope that
Nazi Germany was finally crumbling. It must have really frightened the
German people and knocked their morale. If Allied carpet bombing day and
night was not bad enough, the threat of an unstoppable torrent of water
is certainly not a pleasant way to think about dying.

The powers that be of the time did see Operation Chastise as a great
success, and a propaganda coup, so 617 Squadron became a permanent
squadron, utilised only for the most specialised, secret and dangerous
missions. They would go on to be commanded by the famous Geoffrey
Leonard Cheshire and would utilise Barnes Wallis' other famous invention
the earthquake bomb. Other missions for 617 Squadron would include the
attacks on Bergan and Brest U-Boat Pens, and V2 Rocket sites. They even
had cracks at the famous German battleship Prinz Eugen, and helped sink
the Tirpitz. They were truly the world's first precision bombing unit.&gt;&gt;
