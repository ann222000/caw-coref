There seems to be a dearth of new posting in Usenet again - is the SAIX server
down again?

It's several months since I've had any postings at all in alt.usage.english or
soc.culture.south-africa or soc.genealogy.britain, but even the groups that do
sometimes have new postings, like alt.genealogy or za.misc have been empty for
a week or more.

Your message did reach alt.usage.english, along with the couple of
hundred postings per day that is typical for this group. I'm leaving in
the cross-posting in case this message does reach one of the groups that
you are able to read.

The gradual deterioration of the Usenet server situation seems to be a
worldwide phenomenon. Some regulars in this group have been desperate
enough to use G**gle Groups. My theory on this is that most of the
remaining servers are run by organisations who no longer employ anyone
who knows what Usenet is. The servers keep running because nobody knows
how to shut them down.

I fear that you're right. I use, obviously, google groups (and I used
deja news before that), but I'd rather use a good usenet connection -
but you can't, as you say, rely on them any more.

Same here. My ISP (Telus) takes the line that their News server is a
&quot;bonus&quot; not part of their core services. So, they promise nothing in
terms of performance and give no support. If it goes down - too bad.

I have stopped using SAIX.
I have subscribed to a US server (Usenet-News.net) for a very small
fee I get a gig tot send and download and seeing that I post and read
text, is will probably last me the whole year at least.

It also gave me huge pleasure to dislodge the first bit of Telkom out
of my life. I have huge dreams and expectations that I will be able to
start using Neotel within months when it comes to fixed line phoning.

I'm hoping the same.

I think that Neotel might be on the horizon sooner than most people
expect. Telkom called me (at supper time on a Saturday, most
inconsiderate) trying to flog me a cheaper service. I told them to bog
off, but it almost certainly involved some long term contract to try
to freeze out genuine opposition.

If Telkom are starting the dirty tricks then there's hope for all of
us.

Thanks.

And today I got messages in AUE and the other groups again -- some of them had
several hundred thousand messages going back several years, so I had to reset
my reader to download only the last 500 headers.

So things seem to be back to normal, sort of.

saix.net down and so the anti-Islam trolls and forgers.

The anti-Islam troll who involved in Unauthorized and forged cancel
messages caught  using saix.net service.

He uses fake identity such as &quot;Wayne&quot; &lt;wa ... @domain.com&gt; of the anti-
Islam trolls and shares many frustrations anti-Islam trolls and
forgers. His real name is &quot;Ian Balchin&quot; &lt;duffaddr ... @ananzi.co.za&gt; and
using the name: &quot;Anne Wainwright&quot; as pseudonym, He lives and run small
IT company with partner in Cape Town in South Africa.

He also using screen name such as &quot;PI 1982&quot; his IP &quot;196.43.2.61&quot;
http://www.saix.net . He believe that anyone at any time should be able
to forged cancel messages for whatever reason without regard to the
consequences. He is dead wrong!!

See it to believe it
