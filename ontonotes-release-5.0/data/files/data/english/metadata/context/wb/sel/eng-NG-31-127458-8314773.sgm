I'm in the process of replacing the clutch slave cylinder on my SIII
2.25 petrol and fund that someone has stripped the top mounting thread
in the bell housing. They've attempted to glue the bolt in with some
epoxy stuff but the bolt was loose so it obviously hadn't worked and
has been relying on the bottom bolt alone.

Any suggestions how to proceede?, it looks practically impossible to
fit a helicoil without removing the engine 8-(.

I am trying to visualise it - is it possible to insert a bolt from the
inside via the hole for the slave cylinder (drilling the hole if necessary
but preferably engaged in the remains of the thread) and gluing it with
studlok to keep it from turning, and use a nut on it. Might be an idea to
slot the end of the bolt for a screwdriver just in case!

I believe i rammed a replacement bolt in of a slightly different size
and thread (hoping it would self re-tap the hole to some extent) which
was covered in threadlock.
Still holding a few years later (and i hope it never goes!)

Put a slight flat on the first three or four threads, and it will tap
properly.

IIRC The hole is quite deep and if you clean out the hole with a finishing
tap (5/16&quot; U.N.C) you can just use a longer bolt.

Yes I've just drilled it right through and tapped it as deep as the
tap will go, I didn't think I could manage to get at it but a small
air drill just fitted in and I tapped it with an air ratchet!.
Thanks everyone for the ideas.
