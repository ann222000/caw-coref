We are briefly reminded of what has happened in the previous 3 episodes.
Ichigo does not return to normal daily life as he had hoped.  Instead, a
strange transfer student, Hirako Shinji, reveals himself to be a Vizard - a
Shinigami with hollow powers.  Moreover, he informs Ichigo that he is the
same and that he should join the other Vizards and sever relations with the
Shinigami and his other associates.

We also learn of the existence of Arrancar, hollows who have ripped open
their masks in order to acquire a zanpakutou sword and shinigami powers.
We are reminded that Ichigo's father, Isshin, revealed himself to be a
Shinigami taichou (commander - though presumably not affiliated with a
unit).  He did so as he was saving the modsoul Kon who was inhabiting
Ichigo's body while Shinji is confronting Ichigo in Shinigami form.  Isshin
kills the attacker with a casual swipe of his sword, demonstrating that he
has formidable powers.  The attacker is none other than Grand Fisher, now
an Arrancar, who previously as a hollow had killed Isshin's wife, Ichigo's
mother.

The enigmatic Urahara appears.  It seems he has some kind of mysterious
relationship with Isshin.  We also recall that Ishida's Dad's has over the
top Quincy powers.  He says he'll restore Ishida's powers providing that
Ishida cuts off contact with the Shinigami and their associates - a
condition to which Ishida agrees.  Switch to Shinji who tells Ichigo that
once one's inner hollow appears, it is there to stay.  Once we have been
brought up to date with what has gone on before, "113 BLEACH" flashes on
screen.

Back at the Kurosaki clinic, Isshin has resumed his baka oyaji (idiot Dad)
form and elbows the returning Ichigo in the face.  Ichigo, apathetically,
does not respond but listlessly goes upstairs to his room.  Kon, back in
his stuffed animal form, almost spills the beans.  However, Rinrin (also in
her stuffed animal form) appears and stops him and reminds him that Urahara
has charged them to keep Isshin's Shinigami powers a secret.  However,
Ichigo is still completely without energy and does not pick up on the
implications of what Kon says.  The modsouls leave Ichigo to his thoughts.

Apparently, Shinji's assertion that Ichigo was a Vizard has caused Ichigo
great concern.  He recalls how his inner hollow had appeared on occasion
but he had always been able to drive it away.  The last time he drove it
away was during his fight with Rukia's brother.  Since then, his inner
hollow had not appeared but Ichigo feels that he hears its voice.

Just then, his inner hollow starts addressing him and then appears to
Ichigo as a full hollow without mask.  He taunts Ichigo saying Ichigo is
scared.  He says that he will get closer and closer to Ichigo and
eventually take over.  He confirms Ichigo's concerns that his tactics have
changed.  Instead of taking over in life or death situations, he will
insidiously invade Ichigo's night-time thoughts.  He vanishes leaving a
worried Ichigo to ponder what he should do.

Karin knocks and then enters.  She knows something is bothering Ichigo and
urges him to confide in her.  She says she's known for some time that
Ichigo is a Shinigami.

Meanwhile in Soul Society, we get a glimpse inside the ops center.  Just as
everyone is complaining how bored they are, the monitors light up with an
alert.  Switch to Karakura Town where we see what looks like a meteor
falling in broad daylight making a huge crater as it crashes into the
earth.

The impact is about as devastating as the bombshell Karin just dropped ON
Ichigo.  It was enough to jolt him out of his lethargy.  He asks her what
she's talking about.  The no-nonsense Karin tells him not to play dumb.
She says she's been able to see Shinigami and other spirits for quite some
time.  A brief flashback crosses her mind from episode 8 where Grand Fisher
atacks her and Shinigami Ichigo comes to her rescue.  Apparently, she was
not as unconscious as Ichigo had thought.  Grand Fisher, of course, is
completely masked in the flashback since he was not yet an Arrancar.

Karin says at first she didn't know what was going on.  However, Don
Kanonji helped her come to a better understanding.  Her explanations are
cut short as what appears to be an earthquake rocks the house.  It also
gets the attention of Urahara Shouten and Orihime and Chad.  You'll recall
that towards the end of episode 112, Shinji carried off Hiyori in order to
prevent her from killing Orihime.  You'll also recall that this murderous
intent was because Orihime had a more ample chest and smoother hair than
Hiyori whose goal in life is to become a demure, blushing bride.

There's no time for pretense.  Ichigo apologizes to Karin, transforms into
a Shinigami.  Karin gapes as Shinigami Ichigo goes out the window and human
Ichigo lands on the bed.

In Soul Society Yamamoto receives a report.  Two Arrancar have appeared in
the human world and they appear to be the real thing.  This is in reference
to Grand Fisher being an incomplete Arrancar as we learned from a
discussion between Urahara and Isshin.

Switch to Karakura town where we see the two Arrancar - the very large
Yamii and and the thin, sickly-looking Urukiora.  Many of the Arrancar have
Spanish names, so I will use the Spanish spelling Urquiola from here on.
People my age will remember that well before the Exxon Valdez, one of the
largest oil spills was that of the Urquiola off the coast of Spain in 1976.

Urquiola appears to be in charge.  When Yamii complains, he points out that
he could have handled the mission by himself.  It appears that Yamii is
just along for the ride.  Yamii is not too bright.  He doesn't realize that
the people ogling the crater can't see him and is upset when they ignore
him.  He makes like a huge vacuum cleaner and starts sucking souls from
people.

Although the expression on Yamii's face is comical as he sucks as much
spiritual energy as he can muster, the results are tragic.  Chad and Inoue,
running to the scene of the disturbance, see a man collapse.  Chad tells
Inoue there's nothing she can do to help - this innocent bystander is dead.
Chad tells her that whatever is sucking up the souls is doing so on a scale
much larger than the Bounts.  He tells her that they have to hurry.  He
makes her promise that when they arrive that her role, as a healer, is to
save survivors and he will do the fighting.

Eyecatch!

Yamii, meanwhile, has left the surrounding area littered with bodies.  He
has not enjoyed his feast.  Urquiola informs him he should have known that
such insipid souls would not taste good.  Urquiola goes on to say his
mission is to kill only one person underscoring the senselessness of
Yamii's mass slaughter.  He says that there are only three people in the
human realm capable of standing up to Arrancar of Urquiola's and Yamii's
stature.  He refers to people he perceives to be weaker than he is as gomi
(garbage, trash).  He is surprised to see a survivor - Ichigo's childhood
friend and classmate, Arisawa Tatsuki.

Yamii, at first, thinks she might taste a little more appetizing than the
rest of his repast but Urquiola tells him she, too, is mere gomi.  Yamii
brings his giant foot down to squash her like a bug but Chad, with perfect
timing, arrives to block the lethal strike.  Chad reminds Orihime of their
previous conversation and tells her to administer aid.  He turns to
confront Yamii.

Yamii wants to know if Chad is their target.  Urquiola denigrates Yamii for
being so imperceptive and tells him the intruder is also gomi.  Yamii thus
feels Chad is his to do with as he pleases.  Meanwhile, Chad releases his
most powerful reiatsu blast.  Orihime who is carrying Tatsuki to safety
hears the sound of the blast.  She turns around to see Chad collapse while
Yamii is completely unfazed by the best Chad can dish out.

Orihime lays Tatsuki down and rushes to Chad's aid.  The eager Yamii asks
Urquiola if this girl is gomi also.  Urquiola grunts an affirmative annoyed
that Yamii cannot sense this for himself. Yamii turns gleefully to consume
Orihime's soul.  Orihime, as usual, does not realize the value she
contributes.  She regrets that Chad had to suffer on her behalf.

Yamii contemptuously attacks - poking at her with a single finger.
Orihime, preoccupied as she is with Chad, almost as an afterthought mutters
a Santen Kesshun (Tri-Heavens Combined Shield) blocking him.  Yamii is
irritated at this resistance and even more irritated that, without much
effort on her part, Orihime's defense was effective.  Orihime, herself, was
not too pleased at the intrusion and rose to her feet.  Resolutely, she
heals Chad with a Souten Kisshun (Twin Heavens Restorative Shield).

The disinterest Urquiola has been exhibiting so far gives way to something
else.  He notes that Orihime's technique is not a simple healing spell but
that she is manipulating time and/or space.  He admits to himself that this
is something he has not seen before.  It looks like he is upgrading Orihime
from the gomi label he had previously conferred upon her.  He admits that
she is an unusual woman.

Orihime resolves to do her best.  She thinks she has to stop relying on
Ichigo to come to her rescue.  She has sensed Ichigo has been troubled and
does not want to add to his worries.  She summons the spirit Tsubaki with a
Koten Zanshun (Orphaned Heaven's Slaying Shield) and, thinking of the
people she wants to protect, unleashes her attack.  Although this is a very
lethal attack, Yamii stops Tsubaki with the palm of his hand, wondering if
he'd swatted a housefly.

Yamii, dense though he may be, does realize that Orihime has some unusual
powers.  He asks Urquiola if they should take her back for Aizen to study.
Urquiola says there is no need and tells Yami to obliterate her.

Yami utters an 'aye, aye' and ecstatically unleashes a crushing blow.  Yet,
when things get tough, that's when Ichigo is at his best.  Yamii has to cut
his attack short to prevent himself from being impaled on Ichigo's
zanpakutou.

That's the end of this week's episode.  Judging from the title of the next
episode, the preview, and the synopsis at the official site; next week,
Rukia comes off the bench and back into the game.  Accompanying her are
some other Shinigami - Hitsugaya, Matsumoto, Ayasegawa, Madarame, and -
last but not least - the newly promoted Abarai Renji.

Mata ato de,
