(KHNL) -- Hundreds of Hawaii inmates who thought they could return home
from mainland prisons soon are out of luck. Prison officials here say
they won't follow a new law that calls for their return, at least not
yet.
The state's prisons chief says right now, Hawaii isn't set
up to handle the return of hundreds of inmates from mainland facilities.
&quot;We
would not have sufficient funding for providing the meals for these
inmates, the clothing, medical services,&quot; Clayton Frank, interim
director of the Department of Public Safety, said.
A new law
calls for the state to bring prisoners back a full year before their
release dates. According to the Attorney General's interpretation, Act
8 isn't mandatory, but provides direction on where the state's prison
system should be headed.
&quot;We will make every effort to put the
necessary programs and other pieces of a comprehensive reintegration
program in place so that we can eventually return our inmates home,&quot;
Frank said.
&quot;This is a philosophical change for the prison
system, our correctional system, from punishment to rehabilitation and
re-entry,&quot; Kat Brady, Community Alliance on Prisons, said.
As
of last week, more than 3,700 inmates were being housed in Hawaii. With
our lack of bed space, another 2,000 were incarcerated in mainland
prisons.
&quot;It would be irresponsible to bring back inmates
without adequate housing,&quot; Frank said. &quot;And it could place our inmates
and staff at risk as a result of overcrowding, and further strain our
aging facilities infrastructure.&quot;
Prison officials say they're
working on a plan to create more bed space and set up programs that
would help inmates re-enter society. They say it could take years to
have a comprehensive system in place.
