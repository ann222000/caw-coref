I saw that interview and immediately thought of Prince Valium from
Spaceballs. Carter was just too relaxed considering the moment.

lol I know. Maybe he was taking the approach that this was MORE than a
long time coming and that he's expected it?

He did seem awfully calm given what he and his team has just
accomplished. Not just winning, but coming back from a pass-thru
penalty to win. Stout. Even if they do field Fords. ;-p

I can't wait to get home and watch the HD and HotPass off the Tivo. At
the least the end of the race anyway...It took it about 155 laps to
get exciting, but at least it finally did.

it was worth the wait.... I just really, really hope I don't have to
wait that long for the next one.  The bandwagon has really emptied out
over the past few years, but I think with the new crew chief and some
experience with the Fords under his belt, things may really start coming
together for Jamie.... Now he, Carl and the rest of the Roush drivers
really need to get their COT program together... and we can both have
reason to celebrate more consistently.

BTW ~ it's nice seeing you back, you were missed  :)

The bandwagon has not really emptied out.  Millions of us were just waiting
for something to cheer about.

McMurray is hitting his groove just in time for the race to The Chase and
things are going to get good.

It's more like &quot;even a blind squirrel gets a nut from time to time&quot;.
McMurray gets a win on an RP track, and you're ready to say he's hitting his
groove?  Hell even the slow cars get pushed up to the front on RP tracks.
Nah - MacMurray fans will have more yet to weep over.

except that McMurray didn't have a slow car... he's been running up
front at restrictor plate races for a while now both when he drove a
Dodge and since he got into a Ford... those that were surprised to see
him win last night just don't pay attention.

It was fun to watch him glide back up through the field to be able to
fight the HMS teams after the yallar line penalty.

Not very surprised either to see a couple of fast Fords out front this week.
They won't be running these cars anymore so there was no need for HMS DEI,
or RCR to refine their cars for any more speed.
Time is running out to see what Roush can do with their COT program.

thanks, Ron.... it was great to see it ~ although, I have to admit, I
had to rewind the DVR to really see it.... although, I was watching the
race live, I had my eyes closed during much of the last lap just waiting
for something bad to happen to Jamie... of course it didn't help that I
had a two year old in my lap asking &quot;where's Jeff Gowdon? where's Jeff
Gowdon?&quot;

BTW ~ if anyone knows how to reprogram a kid, I'd really appreciate some
input.... I don't know how this one ended up a Jeff Gordon fan, but I
have to believe it's not too late to correct the situation... ;)
