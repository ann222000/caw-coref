An American soldier, serving in World War II, had just returned from
several weeks of intense action on the German front lines. He had
finally been granted R&amp;R and was on a train bound for London. The
train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the
train, looking for an empty seat.

The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well-dressed
middle-aged lady and was being used by her little dog. The war
weary soldier asked, &quot;Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?&quot;

The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and
said, &quot;You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't
you see my little Fifi is using that seat?&quot;

The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but
after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again
facing the woman with the dog.

Again he asked, &quot;Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired.&quot;

The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, &quot;You Americans! Not
only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!&quot;

The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the
little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in
the empty seat.

The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her
and chastise the soldier.

An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, &quot;You know,
sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong
thing You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your
autos on the wrong side of the road. And now, sir, you've thrown
the wrong bitch out the window.&quot;
&quot;Women should be obscene and not heard.&quot; Groucho Marx
