It's uncovered a basic foundational difference of opinion in the two major
camps of consciousness.  It works much like a Rorschach inkblot test in
that the argument really has no meaning or message in of itself.  Instead,
it simply reflects your own beliefs.  It's a mirror which will expose the
personal beliefs of anyone who reads it, and attempts to argue for it, or
against it.  It's really quite magical in that respect.  Both sides see is
supporting evidence of their own personal beliefs where in fact, it proves,
or says, nothing of substance.  It's manged to generate endless debate
without producing any resolution of any important issues.

The problem of consciousness comes from the fact that we currently have no
easy way to verify, for ourselves, what it is.  No one yet knows (for sure)
what the nature of their own mental powers are.  We don't have any proof
where they come from, or what they are made of.  We only have speculation
guiding our search for answers.

Without a way to know what it is, we are each free to believe whatever we
want to believe.  Given this choice, people seem to naturally be attracted
two one of two major options.  Either consciousness is nothing more than
the behavior of computer-like device (our brain), or it's something more
interesting and complex.

Which camp you fall into depends on how attracted or replied you are by
these two options.  Few people that have thought about the issue seem to in
the middle of the road.  Must find themselves stuck to one side of the
argument or another.

As a computer guy who really wants to build computers that are equal to
humans, I'm very attracted to the idea that all the magic of human mental
powers is reducible to the operation of a simple machine (the brain) that
we will be able to understand with a bit more work.  I love working with
machines of all types so I have no aversion to the idea that I am nothing
more than an advanced computer-like machine.  I'm attracted to the idea.

In the other camp, we find those people who are more attracted to the
possibility that consciousness is a mystery.  Either they out right hate
(and refuse to accept) the idea that humans are just deterministic
machines, or they are simply attracted to the idea that consciousness is
something mysterious.  They enjoy the idea of a good mystery more so than
they enjoy a simple reductionist answer - they like the fact that there's a
mystery to be explored.

Some of us, think humans are really special (maybe - if we are lucky -
beyond the ability of science to understand), and some of us, think humans
aren't all that special at all (that the cold and unemotional tools of
science will soon reveal that humans, at the core, are cold unemotional
deterministic machines).

The Chinese room is just an inkblot test which shows people our true
feelings if you let yourself get stuck in it's sticky web.  It's had to
resist the debate.

If &quot;having an emotion&quot; means a mechanism that
carries out certain categories of responses in
certain kinds of situations then mechanisms
can have emotions.

When you talk about an &quot;UNemotional machine&quot;
I believe you are really talking about it not
having subjective experiences we call &quot;emotions&quot;
which can be correlated with activations of
certain brain states.

These motivational states we call emotions
change the operational states of other systems.
When you are sad or happy you walk differently.
When you are afraid or feeling safe you react
differently to the same stimuli.

A working machine would need emotional states
to cause it to engage behaviors which result
in some desirable outcome such as feeding
itself or avoiding falling off a ledge or the
ability to function in a social environment
such as making friends, caring for others,
competing for resources or fighting enemies.

Emotions are innate states that allow humans and
animals to modify their responses in a way that
enhances their survival and thus their reproductive
success. It is a primitive kind of reasoning
that says: don't go near the snake, don't trust
that stranger, keep away from the cliff, without
which you would have to learn by trial and error
that a snake bite kills, falling off a cliff is
not good and a stranger can mean danger which
would make you uncompetitive with those who had
a built in response system to those things.

You could say that the subjective experience of
having an emotion is the machine having access to
the sensory data of an emotional state. It knows
when it is happy or sad and can talk about it.

In other words an emotional state not only changes
physical behaviors (we can observe our angry actions)
but also allows us to recognize, to know, what the
particular state is. Certain internal signals become
associated with the label &quot;angry&quot;.

I presume you mean &quot;inaccessible to science&quot; rather than &quot;a non-
scientific process&quot;, which might be a cracked beaker or a baptism.

I'm pretty sure that Searle thinks consciousness is accessible to
science, but with some caveats. Quoting from:

http://philosophy.uwaterloo.ca/MindDict/searle.html

------------------------------------

&quot;... The first basic principle grounding Searle's theory of
consciousness is that consciousness is irreducible. For Searle,
consciousness is essentially a first-person, subjective phenomenon,
and thus talk of conscious states cannot be reduced or eliminated in
favor of third-person, objective talk about neural events. Any such
attempt at reduction, Searle argues, simply misses the essential
features of conscious states -- that is, their subjective qualities.
(See also entry on aspectual shape.)&quot;

&quot;The second basic principle is that consciousness is as much an
ordinary biological phenomenon as is digestion. It is from this
principle that Searle derives an argument for a non-dualist, causal
approach to the problem of consciousness...&quot;

------------------------------------

Searle's Chinese Room Argument was intended to demonstrate that syntax
alone cannot account for semantics, so mere computation is
insufficient to obtain AI. Now he's gone a step further: (quoted from
the same source)

&quot;...More recently (1997), Searle has argued that the Chinese Room
Argument granted too much to computationalism. As he sees it now, the
argument wrongly took as unproblematic the assumption that computer
programs are syntactic or symbolic in the first place. Instead, he
argues that there is no fact intrinsic to the physics of computers
that make their operations syntactic or symbolic; rather, the
ascription of syntax or symbolic operations to a computer program is a
matter of human interpretation...&quot;

The philosophical implications of Searle's argument
are somewhat lost on me, inability to abstract I guess :)

I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;non-scientific&quot; process,
I assume you mean a process not accessible to science?

For me the systems reply seems to work. The ability to
understand Chinese is an ability of the system of people
+ rules working as a whole not the parts of the system.
It is confusing the property of the parts, a person and
a set of rules to follow, and the whole, how they all
work together so the whole can understand Chinese.

Just as the parts, logic gates, cannot by themselves
do arithmetic, for it is a property of the whole which
is defined not by the parts alone but how they are
connected and work together.

A neuron cannot understand Chinese anymore than the
people in Searle's argument need understand Chinese.
But the brain (the whole) can understand Chinese.

Notice how Curt's arguments rest on Curt's beliefs.

Do you think Empirical Science rests upon beliefs or upon empirical
evidence?  Sure, there are some a priori beliefs backing the
philosophy of science but these beliefs are non-controversial.

Before discussing Searle's Chineese Room intuition pump one must
put it in context.  The context is symbolic processing, in particular
Roger Schank's Conceptual Dependency.  Searle got upset by by CS
students coming into his class and making unsupportable claims.
The Chineese Room intuition pump was his reply to them.  There was
never a meeting of the minds.

There is a say that goes &quot;about that which nothing can be said
say nothing.&quot;  Empirical Science can say nothing about that which
is not third person observable.

Is consciousness or awareness third person observable?  I don't
think so.  What we observe is behavior and from behavior we
make claims about consciousness but this adds nothing to any
explaination of behavior since all that can be observed can
be equally explained without appeal to conscioiusness.  When
considering two explantions one of which is (A and B) -&gt; C
and the other is A -&gt; C one should prefer A -&gt; C.

That about which nothing can be said say nothing.

That really is the question which is the foundation of all the debate.  I
think consciousness is third person observable because I don't believe
there's anything in a conscious person other than the physical behavior of
their brain.

We just don't have the tools or evidence to prove this belief right or
wrong.

I just don't believe in dualism.  It's inconsistent with everything we know
about the universe so I choose to believe we are not dualistic.  I believe
that the physical world, and the mental world, are not two separate things,
but that they are one and the same thing.

Another point of view:

The mental world and the physical world are not
the same and there is such a thing as a first person
observation that is not third person observable.

The mental world only exists as neural activity in a
brain just as the virtual reality world only exists as
electronic switching activity in a computer.

The physical world always exists and its reality or
nature remains unchanged and doesn't require a mental
world to exist.

The mental world by contrast depends on the physical
world to exist and its nature is changed by changes
in the physical world.

Subjective experiences (the mental world) such as
&quot;seeing red&quot; or &quot;feeling pain&quot; have no existence
independent of activities in the brain. The physical
world has no &quot;red&quot; it has no &quot;pain&quot;. They are
descriptions of how things behave not descriptions
of what things are. They are properties of the mental
world which in turn depends upon the physical world
to exist.

Understanding the mental world will mean understanding
the relationships between interacting patterns in the
brain whereas understanding the physical world is a
matter of physics.

The physical world is limited by the laws of physics
whereas the mental world, although dependent for its
existence on the parts that make up the physical
world and how they interact, is not limited by the
laws of physics as demonstrated by any cartoon movie.

In other words the &quot;mental world&quot; and the &quot;physical
world&quot; are not the same thing although the physical
world is only known through neural activity.

Well I suppose I have difficulty understanding where Searle is going
with the argument. As you state below I certainly feel the idea of
understanding Chinese is in a sense an emergent property of the
system, and cannot be expected to be observable as anything more than
deterministic operations at a lower level, but once we accept Searle's
argument are we bound to a dualist view of the mind as something
different from, say, the liver? At the heart of it all I wonder if
Searle saying the kind of understanding a human feels capable of is
not an algorithmic process, and as such can never be artificially
recreated?

Of course we are bound by the problem of arguing the replication of
something we don't know exists, but then I think even at that level -
the question of existence - the argument splits its audience. I would
imagine those who buy Searle's argument would agree that consciousness
does exist as a thing in itself, those who disagree with Searle would
say consciousness is only the name we apply to a particularly flexible
mode of interaction with the world.  The fact is Searle makes his
judgement in the third person, he observes the Chinese speaker, and he
observes the room, and concludes they are different. Surely if it
walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is a duck? I realise
this is a heavily functionalist argument, I just fail to see how
Searle's argument is any less ridiculous than that of intelligent
design proponents, hiding behind science in order to disprove it.

Well think of it this way, all existence is interpretation. The

Yes, the mental world is an abstraction built upon the physical world.

the logic gates.

Well we don't expect the same rules which governed the creation of a
microchip to effect the completeness of the instruction set it
provides (which is presumably complete, allowing any possible
computation to be performed). I suppose one wonders whether is is
losing track of what's important to set up the mental as being the key
abstraction which brings the physical to life - is it not possible
that the mental world we perceive is simply an after effect of a
deterministic, algorithmic process? I know language is clumsy in this
respect, but I feel it is a mistake to forget that in many ways our
brain is no more alive, or mental, than a rock. It is a hard
deterministic interaction of particles and forces. I realise that
can't be proven, but it seems strange to me that Searle sees the brain
as having some magic.

Thank you for these quotes, the certainly shed a lot of light on

symbols certainly do accrue meaning, within that program. Similarly
within our own mind we attach symbolic meaning to meaningless
interactions. To take what he says and turn it on its head:

&gt; I presume you mean &quot;inaccessible to science&quot; rather than &quot;a non-
&gt; scientific process&quot;, which might be a cracked beaker or a baptism.

&gt; I'm pretty sure that Searle thinks consciousness is accessible to
&gt; science, but with some caveats. Quoting from:

&gt; http://philosophy.uwaterloo.ca/MindDict/searle.html

&gt; ------------------------------------

&gt; &quot;... The first basic principle grounding Searle's theory of
&gt; consciousness is that consciousness is irreducible. For Searle,
&gt; consciousness is essentially a first-person, subjective phenomenon,
&gt; and thus talk of conscious states cannot be reduced or eliminated in
&gt; favor of third-person, objective talk about neural events. Any such
&gt; attempt at reduction, Searle argues, simply misses the essential
&gt; features of conscious states -- that is, their subjective qualities.
&gt; (See also entry on aspectual shape.)&quot;

&gt; &quot;The second basic principle is that consciousness is as much an
&gt; ordinary biological phenomenon as is digestion. It is from this
&gt; principle that Searle derives an argument for a non-dualist, causal
&gt; approach to the problem of consciousness...&quot;

&gt; ------------------------------------

&gt; Searle's Chinese Room Argument was intended to demonstrate that syntax
&gt; alone cannot account for semantics, so mere computation is
&gt; insufficient to obtain AI. Now he's gone a step further: (quoted from
&gt; the same source)

&gt; &quot;...More recently (1997), Searle has argued that the Chinese Room
&gt; Argument granted too much to computationalism. As he sees it now, the
&gt; argument wrongly took as unproblematic the assumption that computer
&gt; programs are syntactic or symbolic in the first place. Instead, he

In actual fact after a careful reading of the link you provided I feel

From:

http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~cfs/472_html/Intro/NYT_Intro/History/Sear...

&quot;...What is Searle's positive view? What more besides implementing an
algorithm that is formally isomorphic to the thinking that goes on in
the human brain is required to produce a thinking thing? According to
Searle, whether something is thinking depends not only on what
computational algorithm it is running (the software) but also the
nature of the thing that is running the algorithm (the hardware). The
problem with functionalism, Searle argues, is that it abstracts away
too much from the actual physical implementation of the computational
processes involved in thinking. A program &quot;running on&quot; a human brain
might constitute thinking, but the same program running on a computer
made out of &quot;beer cans strung together with wires and powered by
windmills,&quot; or by the population of a large country (such as China)
would not constitute thinking. As he puts it, some materials in which
an algorithm might be implemented have the &quot;causal power&quot; to produce
thinking, and others do not. He does not provide a criterion for
deciding which things do and which do not have the &quot;causal power&quot; to
produce thinking. That is a matter for future investigation...&quot;

-----------------------------

I hasten to add that this notion of &quot;causal power&quot; is not some form of
vitalism or animism. To my mind it is the tacit acceptance that
thinking is an activity of extremely complex biochemical systems that
arose only after billions of years of tuning and tinkering and
experimenting (with their own lives!). The resulting information
embedded in the structure of every living thing reflects the
properties of the underlying materials and the ancient history of each
species. Syntax is an afterthought.

Here I would disagree, of course if you define thinking as occurring

If the issue is one of architecture then fair enough, one might
envision that &quot;thinking&quot; can only emerge in high-noise, massively
parallel systems, one can pinpoint the influence of chemical and
electrical signaling, but at its heart such a system is in no way tied
to an organic implementation. I see no reason to suspect that thinking
systems are tied to organic architectures - I accept and endorse the
idea that the notion of thought might not emerge in a high-speed,
serial, model of the brain, but if a simulation is set up in such a
way as to mimic the brains hardware I fail to see how it wouldn't
prove Searle wrong. I suspect the argument owes more to the its
proponents misconceptions of &quot;what a computer is&quot; than to its
opponents misconceptions of &quot;what thinking is&quot;.

To take this to the extreme if we were to construct a brain from
organic materials, using organic methodology would it be any less
artificial than a brain made of doped silicon?

Searle's argument is that since none of the components of the Chinese
Room can understand Chinese, that therefore the Chinese Room can't
understand Chinese. That's like arguing that since none of the
components of a car can transport a person from A to B, therefore the
car can't transport a person from A to B. This argument is a fallacy,
since it places the functions of the components at the same level as the
functions of the system.

The conscious clerk in the Chinese Room is irrelevant. The clerk is, as
described by Searle, simply a pattern-recognition machine, and could be
replaced by one without any change in the Chinese Room's operation.

Does this amount to saying that Searle believes consciousness to be
&quot;unscientific&quot;? If I knew what you meant, I could answer. Searle IMO
believes in the reality of the Soul.

Well your last statement says exactly what I meant by unscientific,
does Searle consider consciousness to be in a sense supernatural? It
seems to me that if he feels there is no scientific, repeatable,
mechanism which explains consciousness then the only other alternative
is that of a soul as you put it.

Having said that plenty of people have responded in this thread and
made clear that Searle seems to err well away from talk of a soul, and
instead his point is that the activity of thinking is tied to the
human brain, and utterly dependent on it as a setting, I still don't
agree that this is true, but at least it is s step back from
supernaturalism.

Clearly I put forward the walking talking criteria in jest, but there
is a point here. What sets you apart from the duck is the fact that
you obviously aren't one - you look like a human, you contain human

from a native chinese speaker purely because we know they are
different. But they are not, treated as black boxes both systems

Strictly speaking there is indeed only subjective
experiences

The physical world is an inference to explain our
subjective experiences. Why for example we experience
everything from within the constrained framework of a
human body. Why we can only effect change via the
workings of this body.

Thus the idea that our subjective experiences exist
in a physical framework is the most simple explanation
for the contents and constraints of our subjective
experiences. Occam's razor and all that.

It is reasonable therefore to conclude there is a
real physical world, the substrate on which the
subjective can exist. The ultimate nature of that
physical world in terms of space, time and matter
may of course be stranger than we have imagined.

In particular I think that our experience of the
passing of time is stranger than we realise and
is a pattern in space time not an actual passing
like a boat down a river. But that is another
story and pure conjecture based on experiments
with our subjective experiences of time.

I find the notion of a mental world as an &quot;after effect&quot;
too vague to be useful and smacks of &quot;other stuff&quot;. I have
no problem with the parts of our brain being no more alive

I accept that reports of subjective experience are third person
observable.  I even accept that the individual reports may not
reflect the reality.  I don't see any different course for empirical
science.

What I don't accept is the notion that empirical evidence should be
ignored just because it contravenes a promoted philosophy.  Empirical
science relies upon subjective reports and the reproducabilty of them
with reguards to the observable world.  One cannot observe the
consciousness of others.  Dennett wishes to have it both ways.
He wishes to assert reports of consciousness are about consciouness
and can be treated as other evidenct.  He also wishes to asset
these productions aren't reports about one's consciousness at all
but rather about how consciousness seems to be to the reporter.
This isn't in and of itself problematic since clearly our sensing
organ limit our abilities to detect that which is and how it is.
He gets into trouble when it tries to claim there is nothing more
but how it seems.  When he does this he says something about
which nothing can be said (when one plays by the rules set forth).

PS:

1) It isn't blobs of ink and cellulose atoms that make you want to read War
and Peace, it is the meaning - something that exists that is *other than*
&quot;just* the atoms of ink and cellulose.  I.e., Meaning over and above &quot;just&quot;
the atoms has causal power in Universe and thereby constitutes existence as
much as atoms behaviing do.

2) And why choose &quot;atoms behaving&quot; as your preferred level of description,
to which you anchor everything?  Why not molecules behaving? (We know that
many molecules *cannot* be reduced to the attributes/behavior of the
constituent atoms due to emergence).  Or why not choose quantum fields
behaving! After all, it is not &quot;solid&quot; objects like &quot;atoms behaving&quot; that
are important - it is the interacting fields (LCAO/LCMO theory).  Even more
&quot;reduced&quot; and bottomed-out than &quot;atoms&quot;! (And reduction, as every schoolboy
knows, is a lossy process.)

Your logic is flawed.

We don't use words to label precise behaviors.  We use words to label
classes of behaviors.  Everything is an abstraction.  It's a class of
patterns which we assign the meaning to.  When we say a person is running,
we can create millions of different videos to show people running, but no
two videos will be the exact same set of molecules doing the exact same set
of motions.  No two people use the same definition for a word for most of
these words.  The edge cases will be different for each of us.  If you show
a 100 different people 1000 videos of people doing something running-like
(a running edge case), and ask them to identify which video shows running
and which is not running, you will get 1000 different answers.  We define
words by the approximate location of the center of the set.  We give
examples of what running is which are clearly located near the center of
the set of all behaviors we think should be called running.  We can apply
it to the actions of people, and dogs, and even computers - it's a very
abstract words.  But no matter how specific a word is, it's still only an
abstraction of class of sensory signals.

I claim that consciousness is just yet another word which describes another
class of behaviors of atoms.  Which behaviors are part of the class is hard
to say because even though lots of people think the word has meaning (that
is they think they are talking about something real when they use it), they
can't for the life of them define it.  So, since I know they are talking
about some class of behaviors of atoms, I have fun trying to figure what
the class is based on how they use it.  But since they can't define it,
it's mostly impossible for me to know what class they want to apply it to.

It's clear where people place the center of the set of all atom behaviors
which they want to label as consciousness.  They place the center at the
set of behaviors their own brain is able to detect in itself.  That is,
whatever the brain is able to report about it's own behaviors is what they
call consciousness.  But what they can't do, because they don't understand
they are simply creating another words to describe a class of behaviors of
atoms, is help me figure out where the edge cases lie.  Do they want to
define the word as one which only applies to the human brain?  That's a
perfectly fine way to define the word.  But then, when we build a machine
using electronic components which produces human-like conscious behaviors,
including the ability to talk about and debate the nature of it's own
consciousness, are they then going to choose to extend the boundaries of
the concept of consciousness to include those non-biological machines?  I
find it hard to believe they wouldn't if we ended up creating such a
machine because this machine, who learned English and philosophy the same
way humans learn it, will strongly argue that he is just as conscious as
any hunk of meat because everything they have, he has, in the sense of his
brain being able to sense it's own actions.

None the less, the bottom line, is just because society can't agree on what
class of behaviors they are talking about when they use the word conscious,
doesn't mean the word is not just a reference to some class of motions of
atoms.

We as brains, can really only understand and sense neural signals.  All our
words are actually just first hand references to classes of motions of the
atoms which create our neural signals.  Only second hand, do they also
reference the motion of atoms out in the real world.  So when we say we see
a cat, we are really saying we (a brain) is currently sensing cat-like
neural patterns.  But those cat like neural patterns have a strong
correlation to the cat-like collection of atoms which also happen to exist
out in the real world so, because of that correlation, we can talk about
cats and refer to all of it, the stuff that exists outside the head as well
as the stuff that represents it inside our head.

If people actually believed in materialism like they say they do, they
wouldn't be so confused about consciousness.  If you believe in
materialism, you would understand that everything we talk about is a
reference to the behavior of atoms.  That's what materialism is all about -
the belief that the physical stuff of nature is the foundation of
everything there is in nature.

But most people who like to debate issues of consciousness don't believe
this to be true.  They believe consciousness is something else - that the
stuff it's made from is another elementary part of nature which the tools
of science can't detect.  They claim it's impossible to build a machine to
measure it, or detect it (subjective experience can not be made objective
they claim).  They know it's there, because their brain is able to detect
it, and report on it's status, but they think it's impossible to build a
machine do detect it and report on it's status (a tool of science).  Don't
they see how completely contradictory those ideas are?  If they claim to be
materialists, and believe that the brain is just a collection of atoms
arranged in the right way, which &quot;creates&quot; consciousness, then what do they
think they are saying consciousness is if not the behavior of the atoms of
their brain?

How, can it make sense to argue that this collection of atoms has the power
to sense the existence of consciousness, but at the same time try to argue
that no tool of science can sense it and report on it?  How can people be
this stupid and then turn around and call this a hard problem?

It's only hard if you choose to believe in your heart that the universe is
dualistic, but then try to rationally argue for the monastic belief of
materialism.  You can't have it both ways and not create a hard problem.
Either you believe a universe full of atoms is all there is here, or you
believe that there exists something besides atoms which physics hasn't been
able to detect with any of their tools other than this tool called the
brain that all physicists are born with.

If you look at the facts in front of us, there is no hard problem, there
are only stupid thinkers who choose to allow their heads to be a jumbled
mess of inconsistent beliefs who then turn around and call the mess they
created for themselves a hard problem.

It's not hard at all. Just clean it up and make it consistent.  There are
only two options possible with consciousness.  Either I'm right, and the
universe is made up of atoms and there is nothing else here when it comes
to the brain which means when people talk about consciousness, they are
simply talking about the normal operation of a normal human brain.

Or, there's something more complex going on here and the universe is more
complex than we understand.  For example, we might actually exist in a very
different form, and are just tied to a matrix like simulator which is
feeding us all this information about the universe we think we live in.
So, all we currently understand is this universe of atoms, when in fact, we
exist in a much larger and more complex universe which has a computer like
device creating this universe of atoms for us.  In which case, it might be
impossible to create consciousness out of atoms - it might exist only this
wider universe - the one we can't directly access and the one we will never
understand because of the fact we can't access it.

Or even without the need of some evil force locking us in a Matrix like
simulation, the other class of possibilities is that consciousness is
another, so far undetected, effect of nature, which only emerges out of the
background noise when you correctly build a large and complex antenna like
device (our brain).  In which case, consciousness could be another
elementary part of nature, different from the atoms, but which physics has
just not yet figured out.  But again, this type of scenery is not a hard
problem - it's just another force of nature like gravity which has yet to
be figured out.

I don't however, see any need to waste time considering the options that
consciousness is another force of nature, when all the evidence we have
tells us the brain is nothing more more than a large reinforcement trained
adaptive body controller made out of biological parts which all work
according to the forces of nature we already understand.

Consciousness (the think people get so confused about), as I have
explained, is nothing more than an outgrowth of the very strong and
compelling illusion of a mind/body split created by the normal operation of
the brain in its role of classifying sensory signal patterns.  This
illusion tricks people into seeing double.  The illusion makes them see the
mind as being separate from the body, and then in order to justify what
they sensing, they make up all this crap about consciousness to explain the
double image.  But them it becomes a hard problem when they realize that
logically, there shouldn't be a double image.

But instead of understanding that this double image is an illusion created
by the normal operation of a physical signal processing device, all these
people are hung up thinking the

A rubber ball behaves differently than a wooden ball in most cases.
The elasticity is important, but you can get the same from a plastic

So what? Computation is a function of logical units, it does not

neurons). It is a mistake to say computation is not a function of

inconsequential. Your argument is akin to saying a house can be made

of materials. Of course it does, what it depends on is the set of

Whereas I would state the opposite. It is their description
of the physical world that makes it hard to describe their
own internal observations.

The brain infers a physical world from its experiences
(internal events) constructed from its sensory inputs but
those experiences are not themselves contained in the
sensory input and thus not part of the inferred model of
the physical world.

Of course there is the naive view that an object is red
in color because that is what its color is, whereas the
red is in fact an internal event and simply the way the
brain codes or processes sensory differences we call
colors.

Science has moved us beyond the naive world view so now
we can understand the physical world is a construction,
which may be differently viewed by different brains,
although we assume a single real physical Universe is
the source of the data used by brains, which are also
part of that Universe, to build a model of the Universe.

Your brain has no direct knowledge of the physical world
only the patterns of its inputs. How do you know if
something exists &quot;out there&quot;? How do you know if you are
dreaming or not? What kind of physical world would you
infer if your only input was a binary switch? How could
it change as the number and value states of those inputs
were increased?

There have been experiments that seem to relate to
what we call consciousness such as the experiments
done by Benjamin Libet, those with split brain subjects,
and blind sight and so on ...

Some images that can be seen two ways such as the
Necker cube or the faces or the vase and so on seem
to indicate there is only one object of consciousness.

Then there is the temporal limit of being conscious
of two events below which the events meld as one.
Or the temporal limit of melding a sequence of events
as a single conscious unit which appears to be up to
three seconds.

Another observation I mentioned in other posts was
the limit of short term memory to an average of seven
items may actually be a temporal limit.

This is something I couldn't understand about Curt's
stance on the subject as being &quot;nothing but moving
atoms&quot; which although may be true doesn't explain in
what way it is &quot;nothing but moving atoms&quot; any more
than explaining how an engine works by saying it is
nothing but moving physical parts.

Maybe these gross over simplifications (or powers of
abstraction as Curt seems to view these &quot;explanations&quot;)
is what attracts people to radical behaviorism where
something like &quot;praise&quot; or &quot; beauty&quot; is nothing but
a stimulus, no more explanations required!

The brain is made up of temporal pattern detectors. That's all you need to
understand about understanding in order to understand how the brain
understands.  The implementation details of how to build these temporal
pattern matching devices and how they get programmed by learning is all
very important if we want to build AI, but if all you want to do is
understand what understanding is, then you need go not further than to
understand it's the act of a temporal pattern matching hardware devices.

Each thing we can understand, or sense, or respond to, or be aware of,
requires the brain to have the power to match a different pattern.  That's
the correct level of abstraction to understand understanding (not the brain
as a whole, or the atom).  However, the neuron is the basic building block
of the brain's ability to detect patterns (that's all a neuron is - a
pattern detection device) so you can pretty much pretend it is the correct
level to understand understanding.

In fact, the brain probably uses small networks of neurons to perform
pattern matching functions, so when we finally have the brain all figured
out, the level of abstraction best use to explain understanding, would be
more like the AND gate, than the transistor, in a computer and more like a
small network of neurons instead of individual neurons in the brain.

Huh?  That makes no sense to me.

The internal events you speak of are nothing more than the output of a
pattern matching circuit.  For example before we can understand what a dog
is, the brain must have hardware which is able to correctly detect all the
different sensory patterns we will recognize as a dog.  It must create an
internal signal which means &quot;I sense a dog&quot;.  It must have pattern matching
hardware that creates as output, the dog signal.  That internal dog signal,
is the brain's awareness of dog.

The &quot;dog experience&quot; as you seem to talk about above, is not in the sensory
signals.  That's correct.  It's in the output of the dog pattern matching
circuit.  It's in the signal which is generated internally by the dog
pattern matching hardware.

When you write, &quot;The brain infers a physical world&quot; I translate that to
&quot;the brain has pattern matching hardware which generates dog signals, and
cat signals, and everything else it &quot;infers&quot; about the physical world - a
different signal for each.

But then you say the since the information inferred is not part of the
sensory inputs, it's not part of the inferred model?  Huh?

It's in the internal sensory signals generated by the pattern matching
hardware.

In other words, when the dog pattern matching hardware detects a dog
pattern in the input signals, it creates yet another, internally generated,
SENOSRY SIGNAL, which the rest of the brain is able to respond to just as
if it were a direct sensory input from the &quot;dog sensor&quot;.

The internally generated dog signal is what the brain infers about the
external environment.  We are able to sense the presence of dogs around us,
because those neurons which make up the &quot;dog pattern matching circuit&quot; are
the &quot;dog sensors&quot; in our brain.  We have a dog sensor in our brain just
like as have light sensors in our eyes and sound sensors in our ear.

Each neuron acts as a sensor.  It's sensing the temporal firing patterns of
other neurons.  We have a brain full of 100 billion sensors each of which
are tuned and wired to sense a different aspect of all the signals in the
brain - they are all acting as brain activity sensors - all 100 billion of
them.  But each one of them is wired to detect a different pattern of brain
activity.

We see red for the same reason we see dog.  It's because we have a red

we have pattern matching hardware in our brain sensing those things.

Red doesn't exist in the world, it exists in our brain just like dog exists
in our brain.  It exists as the output of a pattern matching circuit.  If
you had the right type of brain scanner and brain probe, you could force
your red signal, or your dog signal, to become active in your brain just by
hitting a button on the computer controlled brain probe.  And every time
you hit that button, you would suddenly sense red, or dog, or any other
thing you wanted to make pop into your head at the touch of a button.  The
same machine could read out your thoughts while you had them, to a level
beyond your own ability to realize what you were thinking about.  But
sadly, we don't have any sort of brain probing tools to work with so people

That's right.  And how the brain does this is trivial to understand.  The

Because we have pattern matching hardware in our brain which produces
unique outputs for each of the things that &quot;exist&quot; for us.  Nothing exists
for the brain until a circuit is constructed which generates a signal which
is the thing that exists for us.

At the low level, we have signals from the eye where each pulse represents
something to the effect of &quot;a small amount of light exists at this moment
at this point of the retina&quot;.  The only thing the brain &quot;knows&quot; about at
that point, is what that signal represents.  But as each addition piece of
signal processing hardware is added, and each new internal signal is
generated by the hardware, the brain becomes aware of more and more stuff
existing.  Not only does it know about all the light, but it also knows
there's a dog pattern in those lights because it's got dog-pattern sensors
as part of the brain.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How do you know if you are

No one I've met knows when they are dreaming.  They only know it after the
fact when they wake up.  This is because whatever the brain creates for us
is our understanding of reality.  When we are dreaming, we don't have
anything to compare it to in order to know if it's a dream.  Dreams are as
real as normal reality because they are the same for us - it's all neural
activity.

And when the brain creates a reality for us in which the mental events are
separate from the physical events, the universe looks to us as if mental
events are not physical events - and we have no way of knowing it's just a
virtual creation of the brain instead of the way the physical world really
is because whatever the brain creates for us, is what we believe is real.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Switches are normally seen as output devices, not input devices.

If you only had a binary input, we could still infer just about everything
we already infer - it would just take a lot longer because the data flow
would be a lot slower - unless the data flow wasn't slower and that single
binary input was feeding us sensory data a rate that equaled the normal
flow of sensory data over many parallel channels - at which point we could
still infer the same sort of stuff.

The main limiting factor of what a brain can infer has nothing to do with
the number of inputs.  It's mostly a function of how much pattern matching
hardware it has to work with.  A brain that only has 10 pattern matching
circuits can only be conscious of 10 different things.  Where as one with
100 billion pattern matching circuits, can be conscious of 100 billion
different things.

I assert that consciousness is physical. That means it can be tested by
science.  All it requires is to stick probes into your brain and have you
report what conscious sensations you experience as a result.  Feel free to
do the experiment and figure out for yourself what your own consciousness
is all about - nothing more, and nothing less, than neural activity in the
sensor to effector neural path.

Of course, we don't actually have to do this experiment because it's
already been done and we already know the result.  Forcing the brain to
activate creates reports of conscious sensations in the subject - the brain
activity, is the conscious sedation they are reporting after all.
Surprise, surprise.

The only reason all these people keep suggesting these crazy ideas about
consciousness is because we haven't been able to do enough real science on
real human brains because humans don't tend to like having their brain's
played with and they don't like to see scientists playing with the brains
of other humans either.
