Robert Fisk: No wonder the bloggers are winning
These gutless papers explain why more people are Googling than turning
pages
Published: 21 July 2007

I despise the internet. It's irresponsible and, often, a net of hate.
And I don't have time for Blogopops. But here's a tale of two gutless
newspapers which explains why more and more people are Googling rather
than turning pages.

First the Los Angeles Times. Last year, reporter Mark Arax was
assigned a routine story on the 1915 genocide of one and a half
million Armenians by the Ottoman Turkish authorities. Arax's report
focused on divisions within the local Jewish community over whether to
call the genocide a genocide.

It's an old argument. The Turks insist - against all the facts and
documents and eyewitness accounts, and against history - that the
Armenians were victims of a civil war. The Israeli government and its
new, Nobel prize-winning president, Shimon Peres - anxious to keep
cosy relations with modern Turkey - have preferred to adopt Istanbul's
mendacious version of events. However, many Jews, both inside and
outside Israel, have bravely insisted that they do constitute a
genocide, indeed the very precursor to the later Nazi Holocaust of six
million Jews.

But Arax's genocide report was killed on the orders of managing editor
Douglas Frantz because the reporter had a &quot;position on the issue&quot; and
&quot;a conflict of interest&quot;.

Readers will already have guessed that Arax is an Armenian-American.
His sin, it seems, was that way back in 2005, he and five other
writers wrote a formal memo to LA Times editors reminding them that
the paper's style rules meant that the Armenian genocide was to be
called just that - not &quot;alleged genocide&quot;. Frantz, however, described
the old memo as a &quot;petition&quot; and apparently accused Arax of landing
the assignment by dealing with a Washington editor who was also an
Armenian.

The story was reassigned to Washington reporter Rich Simon, who
concentrated on Turkey's attempt to block Congress from recognising
the Armenian slaughter -- and whose story ran under the headline
&quot;Genocide Resolution Still Far From Certain&quot;.

LA Times executives then went all coy, declining interviews, although
Frantz admitted in a blog (of course) that he had &quot;put a hold&quot; on
Arax's story because of concerns that the reporter &quot;had expressed
personal views about the topic in a public (sic) manner...&quot;. Ho ho.

Truth can be dangerous for the LA Times. Even more so, it seems, when
the managing editor himself - Frantz, no less - once worked for The
New York Times, where he referred to the Armenian massacres as, yes,
an &quot;alleged&quot; genocide. Frantz, it turns out, joined the LA Times as
its Istanbul correspondent.

Well, Arax has since left the LA Times after a settlement which
forestalled a lawsuit against the paper for defamation and
discrimination. His employers heaped praise upon his work while Frantz
has just left the paper to become Middle East correspondent of the
Wall Street Journal based in - of course, you guessed it - Istanbul.

But now let's go north of the border, to the Toronto Globe and Mail,
which assigned columnist Jan Wong to investigate a college murder in
Montreal last September. Wong is not a greatly loved reporter. A third-
generation Canadian, she moved to China during Mao's &quot;cultural
revolution&quot; and, in her own words, &quot;snitched on class enemies and did
my best to be a good little Maoist.&quot;

She later wrote a &quot;Lunch With&quot; series for the Globe in which she acted
all sympathetic to interviewee guests to catch them out. &quot;When they
relax, that's when their guard is down,&quot; she told a college newspaper.
&quot;It's a trick, but it's legit.&quot; Yuk!

Wong's take on the Montreal Dawson College shooting, however, was more
serious. She compared the killer to a half-Algerian Muslim who
murdered 14 women in another Montreal college shooting in 1989 and to
a Russian immigrant who killed four university colleagues in Montreal
in 1992. &quot;In all three cases,&quot; she wrote, &quot;the perpetrator was not
'pure laine', the argot for a 'pure' francophone. Elsewhere, to talk
of racial purity is repugnant. Not in Quebec.&quot;

Painfully true, I'm afraid. Parisians, who speak real French, would
never use such an expression - pure laine translates literally as
&quot;pure wool&quot; but means &quot;authentic&quot; - but some Montrealers do. Wong,
however, had touched a red hot electric wire in &quot;multicultural&quot;
Canada. Prime Minister Stephen Harper complained. &quot;Grossly
irresponsible,&quot; said the man who enthusiastically continued the policy
of sending Canadian troops on their suicidal mission to Afghanistan.

The French-Canadian newspaper Le Devoir - can you imagine a British
paper selling a single copy if it called itself &quot;Duty&quot;? - published a
cartoon of Wong with exaggerated Chinese slanted eyes. Definitely not
pure laine for Le Devoir. The hate mail was even more to the point.
Some contained excrement.

But then the Globe and Mail ran for cover. Its editor-in-chief, Edward
Greenspon, wrote a cowardly column in which he claimed that the
offending paragraphs &quot;should have been removed&quot; from her story. &quot;We
regret that we allowed these words to get into a reported (sic)
article,&quot; he sniffled. There had been a breakdown in what he
hilariously called &quot;the editorial quality control process&quot;.

Now I happen to know a bit about the Globe's &quot;quality control
process&quot;. Some time ago, I discovered that the paper had reprinted an
article of mine from The Independent about the Armenian genocide. But
they had tampered with it, altering my word &quot;genocide&quot; to read
&quot;tragedy&quot;.

The Independent's subscribers promise to make no changes to our
reports. But when our syndication folk contacted the Globe, they
discovered that the Canadian paper had simply stolen the article. They
were made to pay a penalty fee. But as for the censorship of the word
&quot;genocide&quot;, a female executive explained to The Independent that
nothing could be done because the editor responsible had &quot;since left
the Globe and Mail&quot;.

It's the same old story, isn't it? Censor then whinge, then cut and
run. No wonder the bloggers are winning.
