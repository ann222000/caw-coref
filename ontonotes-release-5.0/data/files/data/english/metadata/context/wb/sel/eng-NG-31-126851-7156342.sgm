Excerpt: Hate incidents could be physical, verbal or written abuse.
They take many forms but are essentially about someone being
targeted because they are believed to be different, because of age,
disability, gender identity, race, religion / belief or sexual
orientation.

Victims of hate incidents are being urged to report them to a new
project.

The Hate Incident Monitoring Project has been set up by the County
Council with partner agencies across Leicestershire, to encourage
victims to speak out.

This new initiative has a wider remit than the previous Racist
Incident Common Monitoring Project.  In 2006 nearly 800 racist
incidents were reported to the Racist Incident Common Monitoring
Project.

Hate incidents could be physical, verbal or written abuse.  They
take many forms but are essentially about someone being targeted
because they are believed to be different, because of age,
disability, gender identity, race, religion / belief or sexual
orientation.

Reporting centres have been set up across the county, to enable
people to report hate incidents at a range of locations within the
community.

These include Leicestershire's district and borough councils, Victim
Support Leicestershire, Leicestershire Connexions, MENCAP
Leicestershire, Leicester Lesbian, Gay & Bisexual Centre, Charnwood
Racial Equality Council and many other partner organisations.

Byron Rhodes, the County Council's Cabinet Member for Community
Safety said, "Hate crime is a serious issue which can have a
detrimental impact on people's lives, their family's lives and the
community at large.  The new Hate Incident Monitoring Project will
bring agencies together, and put us in a better position to monitor
incidents that very often go unreported across the county.  This
project will help us to work with our partners to find ways to
prevent them happening in the future."

Chief Inspector Peter Jackson of Leicestershire police said,
"Leicestershire Constabulary are committed to tackling hate crime
and strives to record and investigate incidents and crimes motivated
by prejudice or hate in an effective manner. This initiative
provides victims with the opportunity to report incidents to
alternative reporting centres, this is an important innovation given
the isolating effect of this type if incident or crime."

"This project will allow victims and witnesses to report incidents
to a multitude of agencies thereby building up a picture of hate
crime, county wide. This type of approach will allow resources and
support agencies to direct help when and where it is required."

Mick Studley of Victim Support added, "Victim Support have been
supporting people affected by hate crime for many years."

"It is great news that Leicestershire County Council are
co-coordinating the reporting of these hate incidents and I hope
that people can feel comfortable in coming forward to report them.
We recognise the importance of enabling people to report hate
incidents and to receive that vital support."

When reporting a hate incident it is the 'perception' of the victim
that counts.  Examples of hate incidents can include:

. Someone overhears language they feel is racist
. A person receives threatening a letter which they feel has been
motivated by their disability
. A man, leaving a gay bar, may be verbally or physically abused
which he feels was motivated by homophobia

Anybody can report an incident, whether you or anyonehave
experienced or are aware of anyone who has experienced a hate
incident.
