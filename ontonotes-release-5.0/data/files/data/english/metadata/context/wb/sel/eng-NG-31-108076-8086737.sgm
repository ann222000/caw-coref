I end my day with a brisk 6 mile walk. Now it is our typical tropical August
here. 100 degrees, 100% humidity, and 110 -115 heat index. Gone are the
cooling  afternoon thunder showers and the nice breezes of July. Walk aint
so brisk now. My walking partner, who is 14 years younger and usually does 8
to 10 miles had to stop the other day for water. I am thinking about
carrying a canteen with me.
To think I was raised without air conditioning; and I had no air
conditioning all the way thru college.
Ever been in a WW II barracks at night that traps heat during the day?
Better have a fan.
I am turning into a wimp.
How is your weather there??

Fine and 23 degrees celcius here.  Not bad for the middle of winter.  Rode my
motorbike to the IPSC club today for some shooting practice.  Very nice on the
outdoor range.  Everyone wearing sunglasses.  If there is a better place in the
world than Perth it really must be part of heaven.

Cannot answer for the HK; but the Glock is a really good pistol. I have
several and have used them in matches. They last forever; and the Glock and
the HK are two that, supposedly, will function without lubrication.
I am trying out the Springfield XD right now. Leatham won the production

Amen. 104 in the shade today at 1:30. Went out and shot a 3 D traditional
bow match this morning. No breezes in the woods. Carried two canteens. Only
consumed one.  However, it was not bad. Once your shirt is soaked with
sweat - natures airconditioner takes over. Only 8 of us hardy souls showed
up. We had a good time and left at 11.

5 mile daily walk has helped me get used to the heat. 104 at 1:00 in the

Took one to Thunder Ranch with me. Springfield 1911 A 1. Had some work done
on it; but mostly minor stuff. Feed ramp polished, new sights, new trigger,
beaver tail. Gun jammed once in the first 50 rounds and never did after
that. Put 3,000 rounds through it in a week. Still have it.

Have an old race gun in the safe. Built on a Caspian frame, 38 super, 20
round mags, triple port comp,  with a red dot scope mounted on it. Never
could like it.
Fired the my fastest time on a straight El Pres with it. Something like 4 or
5 seconds with a reload.

That global temperatures change has always been not only a conservative
position but a pretty universal one.  As an example, paleo-conservative
Jerry Pournelle has always used the examples of Hans Brinker (in the classic
tale) being able to ice skate on the brackish waters of Holland's canals
(fictional, so stipulated, but a rather acurate portrayal of the times--the
fictional tale being one more people are familiar with) and George
Washington being able to haul New York's cannon across the frozen waters of
the lower Hudson river.  Neither of these would be plausible today.

I'd be less sceptical of the anthropocentric global warming crowd if their
proposed &quot;solutions&quot; were less politically biased and more even handed.
Where are the proposals to build helium cooled pebble bed nuclear reactors
(pebble beds are inherently safe because failures cause the reaction to damp
rather than run out of control and helium cannot be made radioactive so
coolant leak hazards become a thing of the past)?  Where are the proposals
to fund aggressive development of Ocean Thermal power plants (whose main
&quot;pollutants&quot; are fresh water and fish--both of which we can use)?  Where is
aggressive work toward low cost access to space, which would make things
like Solar Power satellites practical?

Nope, the proposals are always to be satisfied with being poorer as a
society (prettied up language, but that's the end result), usually combined
with whining about &quot;distribution of wealth&quot; which, without major, major
economic growth (which requires energy and material resources in copious
quantities) is no more than a recipe for condemning the entire world to
crushing poverty--forever.

The most common position among conservatives has long been that global
warming is a natural thing.  There are many factors that cause the
climate to warm and cool - humans *might* be one of them, but it's
never been conclusively proven that the human influence is
significant, or to what extent.

Earth went in and out of ice ages several times before human beings
ever existed - that is some pretty darn significant warming and
cooling.  What caused that?  If you believe the liberals, the
dinosaurs must've had SUV's.

It's &quot;climate&quot; when it matches PC theory and &quot;weather&quot; when it doesn't?
Otherwise, the fact that they are having hot summer weather would be neither

----Well, according to the article, higher temps do raise co2 by

Other tidbits from the article:
NaySayers:
The sun generates the vast majority of earth's warmth and drives the
climate, it must be responsible for any recent global warming.
Consensus:
The tiny change in solar output in the last 50 yrs is too small to
explain recent warming. The pattern of warming also has a human, not a
natural, fingerprint.

Naysayers:
1998 was the hottest year on record. No year since then has been as
warm, so global warming must be over even though co2 has kept rising.
Consensus:
1998 had the stongest El Nino in 100 yrs.That made global temps spike.
2005 (no el nino) tied 1998, and now the temp trend is again upward.

50 million is a small number and easily identifiable.

You do realize that is is much more difficult when the money is being
funneled through university grants? Where do you think the data that
the alarmists use, is coming from?

I'll look into it tho.

But you seem to be missing the point that investigating alternative

No, that's not what I said. You continue to create strawmen. People do

No. Why do you insist on using such methods. My original statement is
directly above.

Most *scientists* are liberal. This stems from the fact that the
majority of academia are liberal. Where *that* stems from is another
topic.

I read Newsweek. I don't close sources of information like you do,
then go fishing around for someone to tell me what to think (like you
do).

If you want to pretend that the Newsweek coverage is anything that
resembles a scientific article, your ignorance is shining bright.

Hold on Mofo, give me a break. You've *been* using a Newsweek article
ALL this time, for your stupidity? Off of an msn site? I haven't been
able to view your cite it at work. Read it just now at home...
ridiculous.

Give me a break. I thought for a second that you were actually going
to use data... Since you have no such plans, Here puppy...

http://www.newswithviews.com/Coffman/mike10.htm

this dudes got a Ph.d.

Show me that breakdown to 50 million again? Line by line it! I want to
see figures that add up to 50 mil.

You deceptive mofo.

Yeah, you keep spouting what everyone tells you to spout.
