I'm running a monitor at 1600x1200. It seems that when I try to expand
the Sketchup window to anything larger than 1024x768, it starts to
flicker black. It is even worse if I try to use a tool.

However, if I get it below this &quot;magic&quot; size, then everything is fine.

Sketchup 6 (free), OS X 4.10, Dual 867 PPC G4, 1.25 Gig RAM

The only other program that MIGHT be interfering is Desktop Manager.
At some point I will try it without that.

Cheers,

lloyd
