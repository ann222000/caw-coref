I'm an ordinary joe wanting to try out the weights scenario so i popped
into my local gym and was advised to take whey protien to stop feeling
as if i was about to colapse into jelly the day after every workout.

This is when the problems started , after about a week i did notice a big
difference to my size but also i started getting the shits , i mean not just
a little pebble in the boxers when i lifted a weight but total skat everytime
i took off my boxers.
Not only this i started feeling as if i was on caffine all the time and then the
shits got worse , is was coming out like soup , i had to stop going to the gym
i woke up one morning with shit all up my back and my girlfriend even said she
had enough , i stopped eating rich food etc but still the shit came.
My life was a mess and my ring started to take the strain , piles began and
the nappy rash appeared so enough was enough i stopped taking it and
now my diet is back to normal , this is not a joke i spent more money on
toilet roll than on gym fees , the only one good thing that came out of all this is
i lost a lot of weight but at a price , no girlfriend , embarrassed to goto the gym again
and an asshole with a muscle tighter than a scotaman.
My advice to anyone wanting to try whey protien - make sure you have a good diet
to start off with and not like mine , i eat a lot of indian food and it doesn't mix to well
with this sort of food.

I was going to respond to Wingnut's post, but your post was so much
better than what I was going to write that I think I will do a set of
chins and a neck bridge instead.

I was thinking it must be a special blend of whey if Wingnut noticed a
big difference in his size after one week.

Or perhaps he meant size of his...

pebbles. So to speak.

Wingnut, What temperature was the whey when you consumed it? What was the
interval between mixing and consuming? You must keep whey very cold and
consume it within 8 hours, otherwise you definitely will get the shits.

'i' is not 'I'.  'i' in place of 'I' indicates a low, sloping
forehead, knuckles dragging (not draging) along the ground and mostly
likely a predilection towards texting on a cellphone while driving (is
it just me or does that strike other folks as some what akin to grade
school note passing and requiring about the same maturity- grow up
folks and talk to the person, have an adult conversation).

Also, 'skat' is not 'scat' as in scatological, i.e., &quot;...dealing
pruriently with excrement and excretory functions&quot;.  Freebie: porn is
not 'pr0n'.

See also &quot;How To Write Like A Wanker&quot;: http://www.guidenet.net/resources/wanker.html

Wherein you learn such blindingly obvious tidbits such as:
&quot;Don't capitalize. Hey, if it made e.e. cummings look like a
visionary, surely it'll do the same for you, right? Wrong. It makes
you look like a lazy fuckwit. (Unless you demonstrate that you can use
the shift key: for instance, by using characters that demand it, like
double quotes. Then it makes you look like a pretentious fuckwit.)
Even if you somehow manage to pull off the no-caps style with grace
and flair, the best impression you will make is that of a fuckwit
admirer of e.e. cummings. That puts you one up on ninety-eight percent
of the Internet, but you're still a fuckwit.&quot;

And what's up with this?

&quot;See quoted text&quot;.  No reply to the original poster...just some happy
user (Wingnut's family?) who hit 'reply' and then 'send' without
actually adding a reply?

Any drastic change in diet can have drastic results.  I suggest you
worry about lifting and eat normally, without supplemental whey protein
for a while, and if you absolutely must have extra protein, try it in
small quantities and only once every few days at first.

I don't think it has much to do with Indian food. Check the artificial
stuff in the product ou buy. I buy the oen with no artificial stuff
from GNC.
