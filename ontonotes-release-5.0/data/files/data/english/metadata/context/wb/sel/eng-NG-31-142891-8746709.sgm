Mark Sornson challenged me to show him something in print from the WTS that
would prove that JWs believe that attending meetings and field service is more
effective in treating mental disorders than an appropriate mental health
regimen.

The 1986 Awake article, &quot;Mental Illness - Is There a Cure?&quot; ends with this
statement:

&quot;'Keeping my eyes fixed on the prize of living forever in Paradise, now so near,
has helped me to remain steadfast.' Her faith helps more than any medication
doctors have to offer.&quot;

This was in regard to a schizophrenic patient named Irene.
This is the theme that I've heard over and over and over in various KHs for over
2 decades, yet Mark Sornson claims he's never once heard it once in over 3
decades of being a JW.  The theme is nearly always the same:  Being a faithful
JW is better than appropriate medical help.

Mark is an elder who gets his ego stoked at his KH.  Power over the
congregation is the only power he has in his life.  Mark will say anything
to protect the reputation of the WTS and hide it's dirty underbelly from the
public.  He's feels righteous when he protects mother WT and the bumbling
GB.  He's in total denial about anything negative regarding the WTS.  He
even denies the 1975-fiasco which other JWs were honest enough to admit
remembering.  A shameful time for the GB/WTS.  Soon you'll be subject to
personal attacks, being slandered, called a liar and may even get a few
threatening emails in your inbox.

No, I challenged you to find in print a statement
that being a JW would &quot;cure&quot; mental illness.  You
said &quot;cure&quot; many times.  I took &quot;cure&quot; to mean
must that, &quot;cure.&quot;

You are changing the terms of my challenge.

Gee ... there were 8 pages of very well researched,
non-dogmatic comments about the physical nature of
schizophrenia and the ups and downs of various types
of medical treatment -- none of which were condemnations
of medical treatment or psychiatrists.  And there was,
interleaved throughout, the story of Irene, who
had to be hospitalized and put on medication.  In
fact the article quoted her as saying that she
went off her medication once in 30 years (of taking
it), and was told to go back on it, and she did.

But the article also discussed her feelings, and
her hopes, and what was most important to her -- her
faith, and its hope for a lasting cure.  Thus,
while not belittling Irene's need for medication,
the article ended with a 'plug' for the spiritual
side of Irene's life as something that had more
value to her than what the doctors offered her (which
she partook of).

I invite all who care to go back and read my posts.
I specifically claimed that I never heard it said
that becoming a JW would &quot;cure&quot; a person.  That is
what KrabLegs at first said was said.

Now he's changed the point ever so slightly.

I stick by my claim that the WTS has never said that
becoming a JW is a cure for mental illness, and that
it should replace medication.  The 1986 Awake!
articles do not contradict that claim.

The article only said that Irene's faith offered her

the article did not say her faith REPLACED her

You are again being untruthful and derailing the debate with meaningless details
such as 'cure' for mentally ill, it doesn't matter what anybody shows you you are
ever so dogmatic. You know that Krablegs didn't really mean CURE which he
stated clearly, and we've all heard that psychologists were bad, and they could
start hypnotizing and demonizing you. It's a joke to hear you deny that JW duties
will make you better of mental illness.Liar.

Mark will never admit that.  Unless there's been new light JWs were/are

really demons in the person and pulled some out-of-context scriptures to

The WTS has changed quite a bit with more leniency towards mental health care
but most elders are still of the old school.  For Mark to have been a JW for
more that 30 years and be more than 50 years old, he is a fucking liar when he
says he has never heard JWs condemn psychiatric care.  I've heard it for over 2
decades and it still is the prevalent theme.  Who is he trying to convince?

You are a fucking liar!

This is what I said:
____________________________________________

It is a common misconception, even among JWs, that God will cure mental
illnesses.
____________________________________________

This is what you said:
____________________________________________

Please cite for me any WTS publication that makes that assertion which an elder
might in turn quote from in support of this position you say they have.
____________________________________________

This is my reply:
____________________________________________

It's not all about the quotes. It's about the reality and you know it. I used
the word, &quot;cure,&quot; which I shouldn't have but you know what I mean. If I find
the time I'll dig around and see if I can find something in print that supports
the idea that being a faithful JW will significantly &quot;improve&quot; the mentally ill.
But you know that exists already.
____________________________________________

So, you fucking liar.  I didn't say &quot;cure&quot; many times and quite plainly said
that I shouldn't have said the word, &quot;cure.&quot;

So here is my proof:

The 1986 Awake article, &quot;Mental Illness - Is There a Cure?&quot; ends with this
statement:

&quot;'Keeping my eyes fixed on the prize of living forever in Paradise, now so near,
has helped me to remain steadfast.' Her faith helps more than any medication
doctors have to offer.&quot;

Regardless of what bullshit you wish to introduce, this quote is quite clear:
It plainly states that from the opinion of a WTS publication (as opposed to the
opinion of the patient) faith helped Irene more than any medication doctors had
to offer.

This coincides exactly with what I had said:  &quot;I'll dig around and see if I can
find something in print that supports the idea that being a faithful JW will
significantly &quot;improve&quot; the mentally ill.&quot;

Keep up your lying bullshit, Mark.  You're making a fine witness for those who
oppose the WTS.

No, Krablegs only backed away from saying &quot;cure'
after I made it clear that I was taking him at his
word that he meant &quot;cure.&quot;  His assumption that
I knew he didn't mean cure was his assumption, but
it wasn't my understanding of his meaning.

You are just as deluded as Krablegs if you think
I have said anything close to the assertion that
JW duties will make a person better if they are
mentally ill.  This is a classic strawman argument --
claim I said something that I didn't, and then
accuse me on the basis of what you have made up
out of thin air.

Us. Whoever reads this NG.  As you know we were subtly taught that some
people don't deserve the truth.  It's called theocratic warfare strategy.
They get to decide who does and who doesn't deserve the truth.  They even
change the truth to their convenience.  Is it any wonder so many JWs are so
confused about things?  The truth is not important to Mark and other elders
who have come and gone from this NG. What is important to them is to
discredit those pointing out all the harmful and negative things about the
WTS and the harm it has done to innocent people over the decades.

Just try and get Mark or another old timer to admit the 1975 fiasco where
people were left homeless and without incomes because they were told in the
KHs 1975 was the end of the 7 thousand year,,,, blah, blah....the end of
this system-of-things,... blah, blah,....  Armageddon.......... don't have
children until after the new system,... college is unnecessary, go out and

Just for becoming JWs?  No JW I know believes this.
The only 'cure' that JWs teach is the future miraculous
cures under God's Kingdom.

For you to claim that belief in a future cure is a
&quot;misconception&quot; means that you are claiming that their
religious belief about the future is untrue - that you
know that God will never cure the mentally ill under
his Kingdom ruled by Christ.  That now becomes a

I NEVER DISAGREED WITH YOUR CLAIM THAT THE WT SAID

In this little cut-and-paste exercise of yours,
you found no words by me that said:

&quot;show me where in print JWs believe that ATTENDING
MEETINGS and FIELD SERVICE IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN
TREATING MENTAL DISORDERS THAN AN APPROPRIATE
MENTAL HEALTH REGIMEN.&quot;

And that's because I NEVER SAID THAT!!!!!!!!!

I ONLY challenged you on your claim about a &quot;cure&quot;.

You admit that you made a mistake using the word;

you meant something else.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Regardless of what bullshit you wish to introduce, this quote is quite clear:
&gt; It plainly states that from the opinion of a WTS publication (as opposed to the
&gt; opinion of the patient) faith helped Irene more than any medication doctors had

">

&quot;Faith.&quot;  Faith in what?  The Bible's promises that
were quoted just prior to your excerpt.

Faith.  There was NO mention of &quot;meetings&quot; or &quot;field
service&quot; as &quot;a more effective treatment than a mental
health regimen.&quot;  Faith &quot;helped her more&quot;.  In what
way?  What was the subheading of that last section?

&quot;Comfort for the Mentally Ill&quot;

What kind of comfort?  Spiritual comfort.

What was the first sentence of the paragraph you
quoted from?

&quot;Knowing that God deeply cares for us, however,
can ease much anxiety.&quot;

The article made it clear that Irene was on medication
for the rest of her life.  But her medication alone
didn't ease her anxiety.  Rather, her faith did.

You are trying to make it seem as though that article
was recommending that JWs NOT seek medical treatment,
but rely on meetings, field service, and &quot;faith&quot; alone.

That's NOT what that article said or did.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has helped me to remain steadfast.' Her faith helps more than any medication
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doctors have to offer.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gee ... there were 8 pages of very well researched,
&gt;&gt;&gt; non-dogmatic comments about the physical nature of
&gt;&gt;&gt; schizophrenia and the ups and downs of various types
&gt;&gt;&gt; of medical treatment -- none of which were condemnations
&gt;&gt;&gt; of medical treatment or psychiatrists.  And there was,
&gt;&gt;&gt; interleaved throughout, the story of Irene, who
&gt;&gt;&gt; had to be hospitalized and put on medication.  In
&gt;&gt;&gt; fact the article quoted her as saying that she
&gt;&gt;&gt; went off her medication once in 30 years (of taking
&gt;&gt;&gt; it), and was told to go back on it, and she did.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But the article also discussed her feelings, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; her hopes, and what was most important to her -- her
&gt;&gt;&gt; faith, and its hope for a lasting cure.  Thus,
&gt;&gt;&gt; while not belittling Irene's need for medication,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the article ended with a 'plug' for the spiritual
&gt;&gt;&gt; side of Irene's life as something that had more
&gt;&gt;&gt; value to her than what the doctors offered her (which
&gt;&gt;&gt; she partook of).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This was in regard to a schizophrenic patient named Irene.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is the theme that I've heard over and over and over in various KHs for over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 decades, yet Mark Sornson claims he's never once heard it once in over 3
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decades of being a JW.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I invite all who care to go back and read my posts.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I specifically claimed that I never heard it said
&gt;&gt;&gt; that becoming a JW would &quot;cure&quot; a person.  That is
&gt;&gt;&gt; what KrabLegs at first said was said.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now he's changed the point ever so slightly.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I stick by my claim that the WTS has never said that
&gt;&gt;&gt; becoming a JW is a cure for mental illness, and that
&gt;&gt;&gt; it should replace medication.  The 1986 Awake!
&gt;&gt;&gt; articles do not contradict that claim.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The theme is nearly always the same:  Being a faithful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JW is better than appropriate medical help.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this the conclusion of a mentally ill person who
&gt;&gt;&gt; is distorting what was actually said?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The article only said that Irene's faith offered her
&gt;&gt;&gt; more than her medication.  That was true for her.  But
&gt;&gt;&gt; the article did not say her faith REPLACED her
&gt;&gt;&gt; medication, and her lifelong need to take it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; -m.

&gt;&gt;You are again being untruthful and derailing the debate with meaningless details
&gt;&gt;such as 'cure' for mentally ill, it doesn't matter what anybody shows you you
&gt;&gt;are
&gt;&gt; ever so dogmatic. You know that Krablegs didn't really mean CURE which he
&gt;&gt;stated clearly, and we've all heard that psychologists were bad, and they could
&gt;&gt;start hypnotizing and demonizing you. It's a joke to hear you deny that JW
&gt;&gt;duties
&gt;&gt; will make you better of mental illness.Liar.

&gt;No, Krablegs only backed away from saying &quot;cure'
&gt;after I made it clear that I was taking him at his
&gt;word that he meant &quot;cure.&quot;  His assumption that
&gt;I knew he didn't mean cure was his assumption, but
&gt;it wasn't my understanding of his meaning.

&gt;You are just as deluded as Krablegs if you think
&gt;I have said anything close to the assertion that
&gt;JW duties will make a person better if they are
&gt;mentally ill.  This is a classic strawman argument --
&gt;claim I said something that I didn't, and then
&gt;accuse me on the basis of what you have made up
&gt;out of thin air.
">

You can call me deluded if you wish but I know that you know that the prevailing
thinking amongst JWs is that the only thing a JW needs to feel better is to
attend the meetings and go out in field service.  That is EXACTLY what a
depressed person would be told by an elder.  You know that.
If the JW is severely depressed and can't follow the counsel given by the elder
they are cast aside and ignored.  I've seen this happen over and over and over.
You said it yourself when you said you refuse to be a baby sitter.  Jesus gave
you the job of tending to the flock, but it is so much more convenient for you
to do what the WTS tells you to do rather than what Jesus said.

Yes.  Do I think that the field ministry is a

But do I think that just telling anyone 'go to
meetings and out in field service' when they

No.  Do I think the WTS wants elders to tell people

The severely depressed often are so turned-inward
that they do not respond to efforts to help them,

It isn't merely a matter of choice to not care,
but it's a practical, real-life limitation.
People have to pull their own weight.  Elders
can help a person somewhat - a little, really,
to encourage them; but if a person becomes
'dead weight' because of some severe problem,
they need  'the power beyond what is normal'
to help them that comes only from Jehovah God.
When people reject that power either by not
seeking it or running away from it, they lose.

You work in the mental health care field, right?
And people pay you to do it, right?  [I don't
put that down.  I just ask about it as a fact.]
If that wasn't your job, how many people
would you, and could you help, doing so for
free, out of your own pocket, without the
resources that are required?  [Remember that
you said that 'money' is what makes the
decision in this matter?]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Jesus gave elders, who are limited humans, a job
with limits - to care for the spiritual needs of
'the flock.'  In his sermon on the mount, Jesus
didn't tell people to look to the congregation or
the elders for their physical needs, but to look
to God.  He told them to actively 'seek first the
Kingdom and his righteousness' and God would then
add all of their needs to them.  Jesus could
miraculously cure people.  Some in the first century
could as well.  JWs haven't been gifted with that
power - thus they haven't been charged with the
responsibility to heal people, or otherwise oversee
their physical health care.

If you want the JW organization to be in the
business of giving the mentally ill all the
health care they need, are you planning to
fund that work?  AND, are you planning to give
the JW organization the intrusive authority
to forcibly help those who refuse help when they
need it?

You said you work with the mentally ill, right?
They are your 'clients'.  Have you ever had to
force help on someone to do for them what needed
to be done?  If so, who gave you that authority
to force that help upon them?  If you did that,
could you have given them that same help without
authority?  And, ultimately, if it wasn't your
paid position, would you have done so?  Could you
have done so?

You are making demands on the JW organization
that are beyond its charge to provide.

Look at the Irene article.  Who helped her
get the medical care she needed?  Her husband.
Why?  Because he loved her, but also because
that was his responsibility. And he had authority
to impose care upon her.  [He had to take her
to the mental hospital and commit her.]  The
JW organization doesn't have that authority.

">

As are the elderly and the disabled who can no longer go out in field
surface.  It's hard to accept that the elders are encouraged to keep a
*PRODUCTIVE* flock and that means those who can go d2d and bring in new
members.  If they can not do that the elders are subtly taught to see them
as liabilities, not assets. No matter how an elder may be frustrated,
disgusted and angered by this WT policy he has no choice in the matter.

I've seen this happen over and over and over.

He, like all elders, has no choice in the matter. And he, like other elders,
doesn't have the backbone to protest or change things.  He, like most elders
fears losing his position of prestige and power in his cong if he opens his
mouth, so like the other elders he keeps silent. Eventually most of them
become immune to the suffering of others....  that too was discussed here in
the past.  The WT/GB takes precedence over all............

Indeed it does.  Just look at how they treat their mentally ill, their
disabled and their elderly.  Once people see the WTS for the *business* it
is, and how it puts profit before all.... they are on the road to emotional,
psychological, physical freedom.

I do volunteer work.  I guess that means I don't get paid for it.
What I said about money is that money is what determines whether a person

&gt;Jesus gave elders, who are limited humans, a job

&gt;the elders for their physical needs, but to look
&gt;to God.  He told them to actively 'seek first the
&gt;Kingdom and his righteousness' and God would then
&gt;add all of their needs to them.  Jesus could
&gt;miraculously cure people.  Some in the first century
&gt;could as well.  JWs haven't been gifted with that
&gt;power - thus they haven't been charged with the

Why do you keep twisting the topic.  Where did I say anything about elders
providing &quot;physical needs&quot; or &quot;physical health care?&quot;

Mark...The problem is that every JW means 'peddle mags' and 'go to meetings and door to door'
when talking about faith, not faith in God per se (because that's something weird inside the heart).
There is no such thing as 'faith' for a JW without peddling etc. because that would mean faith is
dead
(harping on that exact particular NWT translated verse to the flock _all the time_).
OF COURSE they think that only meetings and the practical work is going to help because that
IS the faith, that IS what's going to save you according to JW's.  They get this message
over and over, because it is a    WORK    FOR     SURVIVAL/FAITH type religion.
No wonder the advice to the mentally ill becomes worse in result because they are even less
able to perform in these matters.  When you say faith, you talk about an entirely different
thing than the grace Jesus meant for us, and so the advice you give to the flock is absent of this
true, lifesaving faith based on only grace.  Your organisation doesn't work it is dysfunctional
in every respect because of this, and ESPECIALLY to those who could really use the grace
type faith, the lifesustaining, mentally soothing and 'curing' type of faith.

I love it when Mark says he doesn't have time to &quot;feed the flock&quot; yet he can

time for his field service hours.  He said he is defending his faith.  Ha!  What
he's doing is showing how ruthless and cruel the elders can be to the

that everyone has to stand on their own.  Following that logic, why in the hell
would anyone need to go to a KH?  He's a virtual paradox.  He hates those who
disagree with the WTS yet he's made several comments that directly opposes their
teachings.  It's the Gospel according to Mark Sornson.

I got some good news today.  There has been a pesky elder in my congregation who
has been trying to cause trouble for me because I have a girlfriend and guess
what?  Our circuit overseer told him in front of the whole body of elders to
mind his own business and stay out of my personal affairs!

I've known some who has spent time at Bethel and was around the GB and listened
to their conversations.  What they told me is that what's printed in the WT is a
watered down version of what they say there.  The point is, they can't get away
with printing what they really believe so the WT is edited to make sure the more
radical stuff stays out of it.  I have CD (I think I still have it) that was
passed around of a talk that was given at an assembly.  The speaker put down his
notes and told the audience what he had heard the GB say.  The GB burned his ass
for that but they didn't deny what he said.

I just went to look at my old e-mail and yup, I still have it.  The recording is
still in my e-mail as an attachment.  This is just further proof that the GB
doesn't like having stuff put in writing on a recording.  That way, they can
deny it later.  This is the e-mail:

Hi Friends,

I just wanted to let you know about an important piece of information I heard
first hand, this morning (actually on a recording of a Bethel representative
giving a talk at the 2007 Special Day Assembly in Houston, TX). *This same
message was presented last weekend at a San Diego Special Day Assembly*. The
brother specifically said (and repeated, for emphasis) that the Faithful and
Discreet Slave has decided that they have FULFILLED the scripture at Matthew
24:14! There are only 3 countries that do not have Witnesses living in the
vicinity (North Korea, Somalia, Afghanistan). These 3 countries &quot;bears community
responsibility&quot; for their inhabitants. These 3 countries have been preached to
and currently have literature, though no witnesses live there (because Jehovah
will no longer send us to places where our lives would be in danger).

The brother also said the GB is preparing for Jehovah to &quot;put into their
(governmental rulers)hearts&quot; his purpose, then the great tribulation will
INSTANTLY be upon us. He also said we have VERY LITTLE time to get our affairs
in order, before we (the great crowd and the rest of mankind) are &quot;locked into&quot;
judgement.

After hearing that recording twice, I have to admit it is VERY sobering and I
have tears in my eyes and shivers down my spine. I am so ready for the end to
come, but I also realize that I need to continue doing as much as I possibly can
do for Jehovah before that time.

Hopefully, you will find this news just as motivating. I will send the recording
onto you all if I can get a copy from my friend.

The GB is desperate to have it fulfilled they want to have won (been right), want
to see the end themselves etc.  There's no biblical support for immediate judgement
'lock in'.  One can be saved up to the very end of the whole ordeal, as the separation
of sheeps and goats happens at the very end.  The GB want to monopolize the end
and it be all about them and their JW's.  Nothing there to suggest they know anything
more about the end now than in the past. The best predictor of the future is the past,
and the GB has been wrong a hundred percent before.  I hope you don't fear them,
I don't pay ANY attention to them at all based on past record and their loveless
religion. Actually, whatever they say and do, avoid it and even do the opposite.  The
biblical teachings are usually radically differently interpreted by them and I don't see
any reason to be motivated by anything they spew out.  They don't have the spirit of God
but someone else.. if any spirit at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm quite amazed tha Mark hasn't come down on you with a ton of bricks for
&gt;&gt;&gt;using swear words, as he couldn't stop spinning and pointing at that when I used
&gt;&gt;&gt;them before (I quit now hehe, but it's hard when it comes to that man ).

&gt;&gt;&gt;Saba

&gt;&gt; Jesus cursed but he didn't lie. &lt;grin&gt;

&gt;&gt; I love it when Mark says he doesn't have time to &quot;feed the flock&quot; yet he can
&gt;&gt;spend hours typing on a computer.  I'm sure you're right about him counting that
&gt;&gt;time for his field service hours.  He said he is defending his faith.  Ha!  What
&gt;&gt; he's doing is showing how ruthless and cruel the elders can be to the
&gt;&gt;downtrodden and depressed.  He saif there's very little that an elder can do -
&gt;&gt;that everyone has to stand on their own.  Following that logic, why in the hell
&gt;&gt; would anyone need to go to a KH?  He's a virtual paradox.  He hates those who
&gt;&gt;disagree with the WTS yet he's made several comments that directly opposes their
&gt;&gt; teachings.  It's the Gospel according to Mark Sornson.

&gt;&gt;I got some good news today.  There has been a pesky elder in my congregation who
&gt;&gt; has been trying to cause trouble for me because I have a girlfriend and guess
&gt;&gt; what?  Our circuit overseer told him in front of the whole body of elders to
&gt;&gt; mind his own business and stay out of my personal affairs!

&gt;&gt;I've known some who has spent time at Bethel and was around the GB and listened
&gt;&gt;to their conversations.  What they told me is that what's printed in the WT is a
&gt;&gt;watered down version of what they say there.  The point is, they can't get away
&gt;&gt;with printing what they really believe so the WT is edited to make sure the more
&gt;&gt; radical stuff stays out of it.  I have CD (I think I still have it) that was
&gt;&gt;passed around of a talk that was given at an assembly.  The speaker put down his
&gt;&gt;notes and told the audience what he had heard the GB say.  The GB burned his ass
&gt;&gt; for that but they didn't deny what he said.

&gt;&gt;I just went to look at my old e-mail and yup, I still have it.  The recording is
&gt;&gt; still in my e-mail as an attachment.  This is just further proof that the GB
&gt;&gt; doesn't like having stuff put in writing on a recording.  That way, they can
&gt;&gt; deny it later.  This is the e-mail:

&gt;&gt; Hi Friends,

&gt;&gt; I just wanted to let you know about an important piece of information I heard
&gt;&gt; first hand, this morning (actually on a recording of a Bethel representative
&gt;&gt; giving a talk at the 2007 Special Day Assembly in Houston, TX). *This same
&gt;&gt; message was presented last weekend at a San Diego Special Day Assembly*. The
&gt;&gt; brother specifically said (and repeated, for emphasis) that the Faithful and
&gt;&gt; Discreet Slave has decided that they have FULFILLED the scripture at Matthew
&gt;&gt; 24:14! There are only 3 countries that do not have Witnesses living in the
&gt;&gt;vicinity (North Korea, Somalia, Afghanistan). These 3 countries &quot;bears community
&gt;&gt;responsibility&quot; for their inhabitants. These 3 countries have been preached to
&gt;&gt;and currently have literature, though no witnesses live there (because Jehovah
&gt;&gt; will no longer send us to places where our lives would be in danger).

&gt;&gt; The brother also said the GB is preparing for Jehovah to &quot;put into their
&gt;&gt; (governmental rulers)hearts&quot; his purpose, then the great tribulation will
&gt;&gt;INSTANTLY be upon us. He also said we have VERY LITTLE time to get our affairs
&gt;&gt;in order, before we (the great crowd and the rest of mankind) are &quot;locked into&quot;
&gt;&gt; judgement.

&gt;&gt; After hearing that recording twice, I have to admit it is VERY sobering and I
&gt;&gt; have tears in my eyes and shivers down my spine. I am so ready for the end to
&gt;&gt;come, but I also realize that I need to continue doing as much as I possibly can
&gt;&gt; do for Jehovah before that time.

&gt;&gt;Hopefully, you will find this news just as motivating. I will send the recording
&gt;&gt; onto you all if I can get a copy from my friend.

&gt;The GB is desperate to have it fulfilled they want to have won (been right),
&gt;want
&gt;to see the end themselves etc.  There's no biblical support for immediate
&gt;judgement
&gt;'lock in'.  One can be saved up to the very end of the whole ordeal, as the
&gt;separation
&gt;of sheeps and goats happens at the very end.  The GB want to monopolize the end
&gt;and it be all about them and their JW's.  Nothing there to suggest they know
&gt;anything
&gt;more about the end now than in the past. The best predictor of the future is the
&gt;past,
&gt;and the GB has been wrong a hundred percent before.  I hope you don't fear them,
&gt;I don't pay ANY attention to them at all based on past record and their loveless
&gt;religion. Actually, whatever they say and do, avoid it and even do the opposite.
&gt;The
&gt;biblical teachings are usually radically differently interpreted by them and I
&gt;don't see
&gt;any reason to be motivated by anything they spew out.  They don't have the
&gt;spirit of God
&gt;but someone else.. if any spirit at all.

&gt;Saba
">

No, I don't fear them.  Most of the elders here are living miserable lives.
They pray for the end to come so they don't have to deal with life anymore.  It
is really pathetic.  One elder's wife threatened to kill herself and her child.
They really tried to hush that up because you know the elders are supposed to
have control over their families.  The real reason she wanted to kill herself is
because of living with him.  She is trapped in a world of gloom.  She knows she
can't divorce him because she will get treated like a sack of shit.  That elder
is a lot like Mark.  He acts as if he is an authority on every fucking thing and
in reality knows very little.
A religion is sick when they don't want to live any more.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Keep up your lying bullshit, Mark.  You're making a fine witness for those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oppose the WTS.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've known Mark for years and sometimes I wonder if he even knows he's being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;deceitful in protecting the WTS.  There are those who are pathological liars
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and don't see the untruthfulness of what they say as lies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have come to be known and trusted by elders and those who served at Bethel.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They have confided in me with many stories.  I probably know far more than Mark
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does about the organization.  It didn't hit me until I got penalized for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;something that my wife did that something is really wrong here.  In one of my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first posts I quoted Jesus as saying, &quot;I want Love not sacrifice.&quot;  I never
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;heard a JW quote that verse.  I guess it goes against their basic teachings.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can't remember them quoting that verse either. They only jack up what supports
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their own literature,so revealing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm quite amazed tha Mark hasn't come down on you with a ton of bricks for

Good that you don't mind them, you are free of their threats then.
If you live life being a good person and stand by your belief then you'll be ok.
My mother is a JW she is blackened by the never ending demands, she said
she wouldn't mind her plane crashing etc. There's no other way out than death
for JW's.  They don't want to live another 50 years being under that spell,
they think an eternity with that Society is going to be any better.
Then they can relax, they think.

Not for me.  I didn't come here to convert anyone.  I just came here to vent a
little - to express a few gripes.  What I found was a lying, deceitful man who
has convinced me that the organization he worships is a farst.  If would have
taken me much longer to realize just how corrupt the thinking is with those who
blindly defend a man-made religious organization.
It is quite clear to me now that the self-invention or interpretation of the
faithful and discreet slave class parable to apply only to a few older men, who
also make self-claims that they are anointed by holy spirit, is nothing but a
tool to stay in absolute control of the organization.
So, why it may appear to you or anyone else that our bickering has been a wasted
effort, it has been a break-through for me.

Let's see.  A faithful JW goes to all the meetings, prepares for all the
meetings, reads the Bible daily, reads the daily text, prepares for talks, goes
out in field service every Saturday, goes to work to support his family,
conducts Bible studies with his children, conducts Bible studies with newly
interested ones, perform the daily chores around the house.  Hmmm...  Is that
what Jesus had in mind or is that part of a well executed plan to keep the
members from learning anything other than what is spoon-fed them?

I used the term &quot;their eyes glazed over&quot; to describe the people at the
meetings. We were all so bored out of our minds hearing the same old same
old same old it's a wonder we didn't fall asleep in our chairs, and keel
over onto the floor.

Their &quot;self glorification&quot; is an understatement and we all know how

Compare this to Jesus and his disciples and what was expected of them.
Compare it to how the Christians of his time lived.

Look at the stress caused by what you posted above. Some JW women don't
even have an hour a day to themselves to relax and catch their breath.
Husbands and fathers lack the time to take their family to the zoo or a day
at the beach. Should they dare complain at the number of meetings, required
reading and required d2d work, they're looked at with suspicion, called weak
in the faith, that Satan is tempting them.... and worse.

This endless stress caused marriages and families by the WTS is unparalleled
in any other legitimate religion.  It's destructive to the individual and
the family unit, including the children, if any, who become involved.  Many
JWs come to realize this when it's too late to gracefully back out.....

Just be intelligent and be around someone like Mark Sornson for awhile.  It
would be interesting to know how many he's run out of his congregation.  He
quite clearly said that he had little time to spend with those who needed
spiritual help and that it was their responsibility to stand on their own feet.
What he didn't mention is how many he stumbled because of his haughty lying
attitude.  I can only hope that he's helped others to see the rottenness that
exists inside the organization by his own example.

JW's are often exactly that - disorientated, confused and mind-numbed.
It makes it easier to insert anxt for the ever so approaching end, fill in with
more nonsense to keep them exhausted even further. It could very well be
they all end up in need of professional help. Psychology have established that
when all your cognitive capasity is used and filled up, combined with stress,
one acts rashly and become the very thing they want to avoid: easily succumbed
to immoral acts.  It takes away your minds faculties to be a Jehovah Witness.
They can run amok because of it (and so you hear stories about this).

&gt; JW's are often exactly that - disorientated, confused and mind-numbed.
&gt; It makes it easier to insert anxt for the ever so approaching end, fill in with
&gt; more nonsense to keep them exhausted even further. It could very well be
&gt; they all end up in need of professional help. Psychology have established that
&gt; when all your cognitive capasity is used and filled up, combined with stress,
&gt; one acts rashly and become the very thing they want to avoid: easily succumbed
&gt; to immoral acts.  It takes away your minds faculties to be a Jehovah Witness.
&gt; They can run amok because of it (and so you hear stories about this).

Thank you Saba, I saw a parallel with what others were saying about
overload, and how it affected me way back in my Navy days. I have
experienced something similar since then, after a long west to east 13hour
flight from the UK to Singapore - very bad jetlag.
Is there any way to reduce the load? to take time out? it seems to me to be
accumulative which can be very destructive.
To help reduce the stress, how about if people put aside a few minutes
each day, somewhere quiet, and devote that time to themselves. I did this
for many years in a stressful job, and visited in my mind lots of lovely
golden sandy beaches and the rivers I loved to fish. it's is a short
form of meditation, but it sure kept me away from the shrinks!.   (nothin'
wrong with me, wrong with me, wrong with me). I don't know what the
statistics are for stress disorders, or how many leave the organisation
because of it, or whether this is a major factor for those
who leave, perhaps someone on the NG can provide some verifiable stats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Some of the friends literally went through meetings over decades in a seemingly

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what we have to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do to get through each day...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know, the JWs sat there like cyborgs and I know for sure that I zoned out.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Couldn't take all the deliberate misinformation and it's self glorification
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anymore.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's just too much for normal people to handle.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's see.  A faithful JW goes to all the meetings, prepares for all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meetings, reads the Bible daily, reads the daily text, prepares for talks, goes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out in field service every Saturday, goes to work to support his family,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conducts Bible studies with his children, conducts Bible studies with newly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interested ones, perform the daily chores around the house.  Hmmm...  Is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what Jesus had in mind or is that part of a well executed plan to keep the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; members from learning anything other than what is spoon-fed them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have thought it's a good way to wear people out so that they cannot practice
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything that really matters. There's no time to think about others, to care and to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be genuinely christian.  It gets lost in the process and they might become very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bitter always being so swamped, which in turn breeds selfpity, hypocricy and plain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wickedness.  Jesus would think they are out of their minds. Satan applaudes.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If I may contribute a parallel experience.
&gt;&gt;&gt; As a young man in the Navy we went through simulated combat scenarios
&gt;&gt;&gt; at sea where we were locked down inside the ship, at action stations for 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; or more days, working at tasks non-stop with very little time for sleep
&gt;&gt;&gt; or food, until we were like walking zombies. The purpose of this was to

Ok, I didn't know the Navy was so hard on their recruits :8 are you old,
did you become a JW or studied with them at one point? lotsa questions..

I think the idea about taking quality timeout is precious, it's totally necessary,
for everybody.  I lay in bed after I wake up to try to think and meditate (and
wake up hehe).

The JW org takes its toll and some of them surely see that the cost is too great
and leaves.

I am old, not wise, but have compassion and love for others.
No I'm not a JW; I have had contact with some, and I have studied the
history of the WTBTS in depth. I am never rude to the d2d folk that
call, it isn't necessary, right or wrong they are people too, and being
polite doesn't harm anyone.  I wonder sometimes about the fear I see in
the eyes of some  (but then I could be mistaking that for tiredness). You
might ask what I'm doing in this NG, well it's one thing to study cold
history and quite another to listen to the people involved, and there's
some interesting people in this NG, why lurk !.
My belief is a Christian based one (C of E), baptised and confirmed.
I have partaken of the bread and wine of Holy Communion many times,
although I'm not attached to or attend any church or organisation.
The reason for this is that I realised a long time ago that I don't need
anyone or anything standing between me and the Creator; it is always the
middle man that makes the biggest gain. That is my simple statement of
faith, hope this answers your questions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know, the JWs sat there like cyborgs and I know for sure that I zoned out.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Couldn't take all the deliberate misinformation and it's self glorification
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anymore.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's just too much for normal people to handle.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's see.  A faithful JW goes to all the meetings, prepares for all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meetings, reads the Bible daily, reads the daily text, prepares for talks, goes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out in field service every Saturday, goes to work to support his family,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conducts Bible studies with his children, conducts Bible studies with newly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interested ones, perform the daily chores around the house.  Hmmm...  Is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what Jesus had in mind or is that part of a well executed plan to keep the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; members from learning anything other than what is spoon-fed them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have thought it's a good way to wear people out so that they cannot practice
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything that really matters. There's no time to think about others, to care and to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be genuinely christian.  It gets lost in the process and they might become very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bitter always being so swamped, which in turn breeds selfpity, hypocricy and plain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wickedness.  Jesus would think they are out of their minds. Satan applaudes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I may contribute a parallel experience.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As a young man in the Navy we went through simulated combat scenarios
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at sea where we were locked down inside the ship, at action stations for 3
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or more days, working at tasks non-stop with very little time for sleep
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or food, until we were like walking zombies. The purpose of this was to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; condition us to operate automatically in any given situation without
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thinking, and to follow orders without question. When we eventually came
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back up into the sunlight we were disorientated, confused, mind-numbed and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It took quite a while to return to a degree of normality, and this was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after only 3-4 days!. Imagine what it would do to someone subjected to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; similar overload every day -  I would not envy them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JW's are often exactly that - disorientated, confused and mind-numbed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It makes it easier to insert anxt for the ever so approaching end, fill in with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more nonsense to keep them exhausted even further. It could very well be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they all end up in need of professional help. Psychology have established that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when all your cognitive capasity is used and filled up, combined with stress,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one acts rashly and become the very thing they want to avoid: easily succumbed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to immoral acts.  It takes away your minds faculties to be a Jehovah Witness.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They can run amok because of it (and so you hear stories about this).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Saba

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you Saba, I saw a parallel with what others were saying about
&gt;&gt;&gt; overload, and how it affected me way back in my Navy days. I have
&gt;&gt;&gt; experienced something similar since then, after a long west to east 13hour
&gt;&gt;&gt; flight from the UK to Singapore - very bad jetlag.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there any way to reduce the load? to take time out? it seems to me to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; accumulative which can be very destructive.
&gt;&gt;&gt; To help reduce the stress, how about if people put aside a few minutes
&gt;&gt;&gt; each day, somewhere quiet, and devote that time to themselves. I did this
&gt;&gt;&gt; for many years in a stressful job, and visited in my mind lots of lovely
&gt;&gt;&gt; golden sandy beaches and the rivers I loved to fish. it's is a short
&gt;&gt;&gt; form of meditation, but it sure kept me away from the shrinks!.   (nothin'
&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong with me, wrong with me, wrong with me). I don't know what the
&gt;&gt;&gt; statistics are for stress disorders, or how many leave the organisation
&gt;&gt;&gt; because of it, or whether this is a major factor for those
&gt;&gt;&gt; who leave, perhaps someone on the NG can provide some verifiable stats.

&gt;&gt; Ok, I didn't know the Navy was so hard on their recruits :8 are you old,
&gt;&gt; did you become a JW or studied with them at one point? lotsa questions..

&gt;&gt; I think the idea about taking quality timeout is precious, it's totally necessary,
&gt;&gt; for everybody.  I lay in bed after I wake up to try to think and meditate (and
&gt;&gt; wake up hehe).

&gt;&gt; The JW org takes its toll and some of them surely see that the cost is too great
&gt;&gt; and leaves.

&gt;&gt; Veronica

&gt; I am old, not wise, but have compassion and love for others.
&gt; No I'm not a JW; I have had contact with some, and I have studied the
&gt; history of the WTBTS in depth. I am never rude to the d2d folk that
&gt; call, it isn't necessary, right or wrong they are people too, and being
&gt; polite doesn't harm anyone.  I wonder sometimes about the fear I see in
&gt; the eyes of some  (but then I could be mistaking that for tiredness). You
&gt; might ask what I'm doing in this NG, well it's one thing to study cold
&gt; history and quite another to listen to the people involved, and there's
&gt; some interesting people in this NG, why lurk !.
&gt; My belief is a Christian based one (C of E), baptised and confirmed.
&gt; I have partaken of the bread and wine of Holy Communion many times,
&gt; although I'm not attached to or attend any church or organisation.
&gt; The reason for this is that I realised a long time ago that I don't need
&gt; anyone or anything standing between me and the Creator; it is always the
&gt; middle man that makes the biggest gain. That is my simple statement of
&gt; faith, hope this answers your questions.
">

Ok, I'd love to hear your conclusions about the WTBTS itself.
Yes we are indeed a diverse and interesting bunch here :)
I have wanted to partake in wine and bread ceremony, but don't quite know
where to go, did you just pick a church heh? There's many small churches
in my town, one called Jesuschurch (heh) but I am worried about organisations
and all that jazz (no wonder).  I have no idea about the environment in any
of the churches, but they believe in the simple gospel which is for every believer
to take, so I just have to dare to go somewhere. I know a woman in the
babtist church (I think it was) she has invited me a few times but I didn't go.
Every church has their opinions, and as soon as you have to accept something,
like the trinity, I back out. So the simple 'Jesuschurch' (Jesuskirka) as it's called
sounds like a maybe to me. But you put it very wisely, what you say about
the middle man or men, why do we need them? What can they do that Christ
hasn't done already.  They can help, but most of the time (and certainly with
the WT GB, you have to take it all or leave it with them), which is totally wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mark Sornson challenged me to show him something in print from the WTS that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would prove that JWs believe that attending meetings and field service is more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effective in treating mental disorders than an appropriate mental health
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regimen.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The 1986 Awake article, &quot;Mental Illness - Is There a Cure?&quot; ends with this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; statement:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;'Keeping my eyes fixed on the prize of living forever in Paradise, now so near,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has helped me to remain steadfast.' Her faith helps more than any medication
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doctors have to offer.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This was in regard to a schizophrenic patient named Irene.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is the theme that I've heard over and over and over in various KHs for over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 decades, yet Mark Sornson claims he's never once heard it once in over 3
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;decades of being a JW.  The theme is nearly always the same:  Being a faithful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JW is better than appropriate medical help.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sometimes we selectively hear what we want to hear, and filter out that which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;troubles our hearts,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when information gets too painful to hear.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Some of the friends literally went through meetings over decades in a seemingly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;catatonic state,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;almost seeming detached and for lack of a better word, 'robotic'. I figure we do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what we have to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do to get through each day...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know, the JWs sat there like cyborgs and I know for sure that I zoned out.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Couldn't take all the deliberate misinformation and it's self glorification
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anymore.

Major diversions in the early days, bloody coups.  I've been back as far
as the 4th century to Arius, and looked at more recent characters like
Johannes Greber who had influence on the NWT.  Compared to Joseph
Smith, founder of the Mormons, the BTS founder CT Russell was a pussycat.
It is interesting to speculate what the WTS would be like today if Judge
Joseph Rutherford hadn't been the second President.  The whole historic
record is freely available on the internet along with copies of the different
magazines, convention reports and books.  With the coming of the internet,
organisations like the WTS will change, I'm sure of that.

Test all things !  My only advice would be to go along and talk to the
Pastor/Rev and ask what their gospel is. If they have Holy
Communion then it is likely to be orthodox Christian. I looked
them up on Google and it seems they are a homely type of branch. Is it
Danish? Jesuskirken?. When I was holidaying on the Pacific island
of Rarotonga about 3 years ago, my wife and I went to the local church
grounds on Sunday to listen to the amazing singing that the locals do. We
sat on the large verandah and about halfway through the service the Pastor
came out and included us in it !.  I have several SDA fishing friends whom
I've known (and done lots of fishing trips with) for many years.  We

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doctors have to offer.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This was in regard to a schizophrenic patient named Irene.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is the theme that I've heard over and over and over in various KHs for over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 decades, yet Mark Sornson claims he's never once heard it once in over 3
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;decades of being a JW.  The theme is nearly always the same:  Being a faithful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JW is better than appropriate medical help.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sometimes we selectively hear what we want to hear, and filter out that which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;troubles our hearts,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when information gets too painful to hear.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Some of the friends literally went through meetings over decades in a seemingly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;catatonic state,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;almost seeming detached and for lack of a better word, 'robotic'. I figure we do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what we have to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do to get through each day...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know, the JWs sat there like cyborgs and I know for sure that I zoned out.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Couldn't take all the deliberate misinformation and it's self glorification
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anymore.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's just too much for normal people to handle.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's see.  A faithful JW goes to all the meetings, prepares for all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meetings, reads the Bible daily, reads the daily text, prepares for talks, goes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out in field service every Saturday, goes to work to support his family,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conducts Bible studies with his children, conducts Bible studies with newly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interested ones, perform the daily chores around the house.  Hmmm...  Is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what Jesus had in mind or is that part of a well executed plan to keep the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; members from learning anything other than what is spoon-fed them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have thought it's a good way to wear people out so that they cannot practice
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything that really matters. There's no time to think about others, to care and to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be genuinely christian.  It gets lost in the process and they might become very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bitter always being so swamped, which in turn breeds selfpity, hypocricy and plain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wickedness.  Jesus would think they are out of their minds. Satan applaudes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I may contribute a parallel experience.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As a young man in the Navy we went through simulated combat scenarios
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at sea where we were locked down inside the ship, at action stations for 3
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or more days, working at tasks non-stop with very little time for sleep
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or food, until we were like walking zombies. The purpose of this was to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; condition us to operate automatically in any given situation without
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thinking, and to follow orders without question. When we eventually came
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back up into the sunlight we were disorientated, confused, mind-numbed and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It took quite a while to return to a degree of normality, and this was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after only 3-4 days!. Imagine what it would do to someone subjected to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; similar overload every day -  I would not envy them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regards
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brian M

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JW's are often exactly that - disorientated, confused and mind-numbed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It makes it easier to insert anxt for the ever so approaching end, fill in with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more nonsense to keep them exhausted even further. It could very well be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they all end up in need of professional help. Psychology have established that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when all your cognitive capasity is used and filled up, combined with stress,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one acts rashly and become the very thing they want to avoid: easily succumbed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to immoral acts.  It takes away your minds faculties to be a Jehovah Witness.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They can run amok because of it (and so you hear stories about this).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Saba

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you Saba, I saw a parallel with what others were saying about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; overload, and how it affected me way back in my Navy days. I have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experienced something similar since then, after a long west to east 13hour
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; flight from the UK to Singapore - very bad jetlag.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there any way to reduce the load? to take time out? it seems to me to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accumulative which can be very destructive.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To help reduce the stress, how about if people put aside a few minutes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; each day, somewhere quiet, and devote that time to themselves. I did this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for many years in a stressful job, and visited in my mind lots of lovely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; golden sandy beaches and the rivers I loved to fish. it's is a short
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; form of meditation, but it sure kept me away from the shrinks!.   (nothin'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong with me, wrong with me, wrong with me). I don't know what the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; statistics are for stress disorders, or how many leave the organisation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because of it, or whether this is a major factor for those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who leave, perhaps someone on the NG can provide some verifiable stats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regards
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brian M

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, I didn't know the Navy was so hard on their recruits :8 are you old,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; did you become a JW or studied with them at one point? lotsa questions..

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the idea about taking quality timeout is precious, it's totally necessary,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for everybody.  I lay in bed after I wake up to try to think and meditate (and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wake up hehe).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The JW org takes its toll and some of them surely see that the cost is too great
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and leaves.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Veronica

&gt;&gt;&gt; I am old, not wise, but have compassion and love for others.
&gt;&gt;&gt; No I'm not a JW; I have had contact with some, and I have studied the
&gt;&gt;&gt; history of the WTBTS in depth. I am never rude to the d2d folk that
&gt;&gt;&gt; call, it isn't necessary, right or wrong they are people too, and being
&gt;&gt;&gt; polite doesn't harm anyone.  I wonder sometimes about the fear I see in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the eyes of some  (but then I could be mistaking that for tiredness). You
&gt;&gt;&gt; might ask what I'm doing in this NG, well it's one thing to study cold
&gt;&gt;&gt; history and quite another to listen to the people involved, and there's
&gt;&gt;&gt; some interesting people in this NG, why lurk !.
&gt;&gt;&gt; My belief is a Christian based one (C of E), baptised and confirmed.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have partaken of the bread and wine of Holy Communion many times,
&gt;&gt;&gt; although I'm not attached to or attend any church or organisation.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason for this is that I realised a long time ago that I don't need
&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone or anything standing between me and the Creator; it is always the
&gt;&gt;&gt; middle man that makes the biggest gain. That is my simple statement of
&gt;&gt;&gt; faith, hope this answers your questions.

&gt;&gt; Ok, I'd love to hear your conclusions about the WTBTS itself.

&gt; Major diversions in the early days, bloody coups.  I've been back as far
&gt; as the 4th century to Arius, and looked at more recent characters like
&gt; Johannes Greber who had influence on the NWT.  Compared to Joseph
&gt; Smith, founder of the Mormons, the BTS founder CT Russell was a pussycat.
&gt; It is interesting to speculate what the WTS would be like today if Judge
&gt; Joseph Rutherford hadn't been the second President.  The whole historic
&gt; record is freely available on the internet along with copies of the different
&gt; magazines, convention reports and books.  With the coming of the internet,
&gt; organisations like the WTS will change, I'm sure of that.

&gt;&gt; Yes we are indeed a diverse and interesting bunch here :) I have wanted
&gt;&gt; to partake in wine and bread ceremony, but don't quite know where to go,
&gt;&gt; did you just pick a church heh?
&gt;&gt;There's many small churches in my town,
&gt;&gt; one called Jesuschurch (heh) but I am worried about organisations and
&gt;&gt; all that jazz (no wonder).

&gt; Test all things !  My only advice would be to go along and talk to the
&gt; Pastor/Rev and ask what their gospel is. If they have Holy
&gt; Communion then it is likely to be orthodox Christian. I looked
&gt; them up on Google and it seems they are a homely type of branch. Is it
&gt; Danish? Jesuskirken?. When I was holidaying on the Pacific island
&gt; of Rarotonga about 3 years ago, my wife and I went to the local church
&gt; grounds on Sunday to listen

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Mark Sornson challenged me to show him something in print from the WTS that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would prove that JWs believe that attending meetings and field service is more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;effective in treating mental disorders than an appropriate mental health
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regimen.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The 1986 Awake article, &quot;Mental Illness - Is There a Cure?&quot; ends with this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; statement:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;'Keeping my eyes fixed on the prize of living forever in Paradise, now so near,
