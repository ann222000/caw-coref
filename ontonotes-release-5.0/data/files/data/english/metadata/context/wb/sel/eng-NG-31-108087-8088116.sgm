What would be the best way to educate people on the proper way to
enter a freeway? Driver training sure doesn't cover it. I think all
they do in driver training is teach people how to pass the tests.

Seems more and more, I see people that wait until they're completly
merged before they realize that they're only traveling at less than 40
MPH, after which they slowly creep up to freeway speed. Meanwhile
everyone stuck on the ramp behind them is in mortal danger as they're
forced to enter with a huge speed disparity. Very selfish.

This morning I saw a near collision as some idiot merged on while
traveling too slowly. Driving a small 3,000 lb. car, this clueless
person forced a, 80,000 lb. cement mixer to bear down hard on his
binders. Seems all he had to do to avoid this waste of energy is use
the length of the acceleration lane to match the speed of the freeway
*before* he merged. The onramp was certainly long enough even for the
slowest car to merge safely...

We need to educate the people. How? Public service announcements

Agreed. These clown have no clue the effect they are having on traffic
behind  them in the lane...having to try to slide into the highway at
40 and suddenly floor it once on the highway.
They don't understand the word 'merge.

Where I am we have rotaries...too often cagers come to a stop for no
reason when entering the rotary or ignoring the 'Yield' sign entirely
and blowing right into it regardless of traffic.

I wish that we could import the driver's testing process they use in
the UK. They have to spend months studying and practicing, they have
to then take a test on theory....actually have to name parts of the
engine pointed out to them....then undergo a grueling driver's test.

Here is the US and especially here in Columbus OH you can get a
license if you have a pulse. So you have massive numbers of folks with
no clue, no use of turn signals, no knowledge of even the basic rules
of the road.

PS  use a cell phone while driving in the UK and its a HUGE fine with
the possibility of losing the car.

That's one of the worst forms of a merge lane which is commonly known as
a weaving lane.  This forces accelerating traffic to deal with braking
traffic in the same lane, and makes merging much more difficult than it
ought to be.  It's usually done as a design compromise.

No, merging traffic needs to accommodate through (faster) traffic.  They
do this by actually merging without disrupting through traffic.

I don't know how to educate those with licenses.  The up and coming
drivers should be required to experience lane merges in driver
training and their DMV driving test should require it.  The likelihood
of that happening is remote given the cutbacks I've seen in those two
programs.

LOL!

The cement mixer I was speaking of would have been ideal for this
&quot;courtesy&quot; and would have only left a smudge on his front bumper.

What was really silly about the whole thing this morning was the small
car that was merging so poorly was an &quot;energy saving&quot; hybrid. Makes me
wonder how much energy he *wasted* by forcing the 80,000 lb. truck
(and everyone behind the truck) to brake to accomodate him.

That's a problem, but there are other aspects of it, too. On my way to
work, the on-ramp is a very tight uphill 270. Merging speed is often
~30mph, especially if it's a heavy truck. There isn't much that can be
done to improve it. Traffic in the slow lane of the freeway is often
70+, even though there's a merging traffic sign. Traffic on the
freeway needs to be more aware of merging traffic and allow for it.

Likewise, coming home from work, after 11pm, traffic on the 4 lane
freeway is almost always bunched in the slow lane. It's a major
on-ramp, so there can be a lot of vehicles trying to merge, while
people are tailgating in the slow lane - all while there are _zero_
cars in the left two lanes.

As for driver skills, I just got a notice for my license renewal.
&quot;In keeping with a new law, the DMV is piloting some new assessment
tools. They will be used in making licensing decisions...
The new assessment tools include:
1. Observation for any physical limitations that could affect safe
driving.
2. A cognitive exercise that will require you to recall in writing
your Social Security Number, or your zip code.
3. A vision test that measures contrast sensitivity. ...which refers
to the ability to see objects as distinct from their background, such
as a dark car parked in the shade or a light car in the fog.
4. Perceptual Response Test. This is a computer-based test that
measures how well you process visual information, by identifying
silhouettes as belonging to either a truck or a car....&quot;

Sounds like a real tough test.

Most states replaced the 'Merge' signs with 'Yield' signs. I guess it's
easier to understand. It means don't enter if you're gonna make
somebody jam his brakes on, only go if it's clear; otherwise STOP.
If the on ramp is long enough you can get going the traffic speed before
you merge. If it's a short ramp, Yield. You can't merge if you are not
going the same speed as the regular traffic. But since they give
licenses to complete morons, don't expect people to do things right.
I wish I drove a cement truck when I see these assholes.

Less than 40 sounds somewhat exaggerated.  The problem is sometimes
exacerbated by poor visibility of approaching traffic from the ramp,
and, I think, sometimes drivers are not anxious to try get up to speed
only to find merging impossible due to all the knuckleheads traveling
15-25 mph over the speed limit with 1-2 car lengths between them.
Then, at speed, running out of ramp.

Preferable to that scenario is probably proceeding cautiously until a
large enough gap presents itself, then accelerating.

When a driver is proceeding slowly it is best not to second guess
their motivation.  They probably have a good reason, even if it's
their lack of driving skill and/or ability to make decisions quickly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Very wrong.  There's nothing to prevent drivers from spacing
themselves properly beginning at the top of the ramp except  a lack of
driving skill and/or ability to make a smart decision with plenty of
time to do so.

You can't blame a driver for the behavior of the drivers to their
rear.

Cement mixers don't gross 80,000, and its driver should have been
expecting it, looking for it, seen it, and adjusted for it long before
hard braking became necessary, especially since you've managed to

It's rather presumptuous of you to think you know the operating
condition of a vehicle driven by a stranger.  Perhaps they just got
some bad gas, perhaps they forgot to release the emergency brake,
perhaps... perhaps... perhaps...

Sure, perhaps they're just a bad driver, but raising the speed limit
will transform the majority of drivers, who are bad, into perfectly
competent drivers.  Back me up here, Brent.

It's not.  I see it every day.

But of course, you claim that there are actually drivers that obey the

Around here they do, they will eventually accelerate to 15-20 over.  But
not after they've not only cut off someone in the right lane, but the
middle lane as well, since it's a sign of weakness to actually drive in
the right lane.

I think they hand out licenses in exchange for Betty Crocker points...

&gt;&gt; MPH, after which they slowly creep up to freeway speed. Meanwhile
&gt;&gt; everyone stuck on the ramp behind them is in mortal danger as they're
&gt;&gt; forced to enter with a huge speed disparity. Very selfish.

&gt;&gt; This morning I saw a near collision as some idiot merged on while
&gt;&gt; traveling too slowly. Driving a small 3,000 lb. car, this clueless
&gt;&gt; person forced a, 80,000 lb. cement mixer to bear down hard on his
&gt;&gt; binders. Seems all he had to do to avoid this waste of energy is use
&gt;&gt; the length of the acceleration lane to match the speed of the freeway
&gt;&gt; *before* he merged. The onramp was certainly long enough even for the
&gt;&gt; slowest car to merge safely...

&gt;&gt; We need to educate the people. How? Public service announcements
&gt;&gt; featuring graphics?

&gt; Agreed. These clown have no clue the effect they are having on traffic
&gt; behind  them in the lane...having to try to slide into the highway at
&gt; 40 and suddenly floor it once on the highway.
&gt; They don't understand the word 'merge.

&gt; Where I am we have rotaries...too often cagers come to a stop for no
&gt; reason when entering the rotary or ignoring the 'Yield' sign entirely
&gt; and blowing right into it regardless of traffic.

&gt; I wish that we could import the driver's testing process they use in
&gt; the UK. They have to spend months studying and practicing, they have
&gt; to then take a test on theory....actually have to name parts of the
&gt; engine pointed out to them....then undergo a grueling driver's test.
">

Unfortunately not gruelling enough and plenty of old buggers never had to
take a test and they're still out there causing mayhem. As for the months of
training, it's still possible to do what I did and take the test on your
17th birthday (the first day you're legally allowed to drive over here).
Passing the test allows you to drive anything immediately.

They so often go at least to the middle lane, when I have to come down

If any of those reasons were in play here, your arguements (like
Turbys) would be understandable. This so-called &quot;driver&quot; however, was
not impeded by anyone or anything. Visibility and the weather was
perfect, the acceleration lane was well over a thousand feet long and
very straight. There was indeed no reason to cause people to slow for
him, other than stupidity, selfishness or ignorance. It's not
acceptable to me, and it shouldn't be to you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Again. The cement mixer had no one in front of him. No gap needed to
present itself as there was a huge one already there! He simply
refused to take it and chose to inconvienience the truck and everyone
behind the truck. Selfish or ignorant, take your pick. Neither one was
acceptable in this case.

My whole *point* was that he shouldn't have *had* to adjust for it at
all. The acceleration lane was well over a quarter mile long. It was
selfish of they guy in the energy saving hybrid to *force* him to
adjust.  People buy hybrids because they're &quot;green.&quot; But, really. How
&quot;green&quot; was the decision to slow 35 tons of truck (and everyone behind

wasted more energy than his hybrid will save in a week!

For the sake of the argument, we'll say the hybrid *was* in poor
condtion. The condition of the vehicle changes nothing 'cause if the
car *is* in poor condition, it's *still* a selfish thing to do to
drive it in that condtion. Driving with the E-brake on makes the
driver just as stupid as a driver who's ignorant *and* stupid. The
hybrid owner was lucky that the cement mixer wasn't in poor condition
also. The selfish decision to drive such a car in poor condtion (or
with the brake on) could have easily cost him his life. Would it be
the fault of the stupid truck driver? Yes. But the hybrid owner would
be just as stupid (and dead) either way.

Presumptuous? It's just as presumptuous of you to infer that every
vehicle that doesn't merge properly on extremely long accleration ramp
is not running properly, especially as the vast majority of these poor
drivers, will be up over 80 mph. and passing *everyone* (as this guy
was) just a few minutes after merging so selfishly.

If you're at speed coming down the ramp, in many cases their action to close
the gap your aiming for just moves the gap behind them upon which you can
slow a bit and make that gap.

The problem is that so many people merging are so merge impaired that I
can see why people block out. I just hold a steady speed. I won't make a
gap for them, but won't close one either. I've had these tards where all
they had to do to merge in front of me was push down the right pedal. To
merge in back of me, let up on the right pedal. They decide to merge right

state of drivers, their skill levels, experience, or the mechanical
state of their vehicles, et al.  I deal with it, adjust and move on.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Preferable to that scenario is probably proceeding cautiously until a

&gt; Again. The cement mixer had no one in front of him. No gap needed to
&gt; present itself as there was a huge one already there! He simply
&gt; refused to take it and chose to inconvienience the truck and everyone

So?  Nothing unusual about any of that.  Who cares?  AAA concluded 75%
of crashes involving large truck and cars were caused by the car
driver.  Truck drivers deal with it all day, and all night.  I don't

Yup.  Drivers' skills, abilities, experience, reason and judgment come
in an infinite number of flavors, all beyond by control.  You, of

&gt; &quot;green&quot; was the decision to slow 35 tons of truck (and everyone behind

Yes, but so what?  That's none of your business.

You can't hit anything while driving.  If a driver slams on their
brakes for no reason and comes to a complete stop in the middle of a
freeway with traffic flowing at 85 mph, you still can't hit them.  Or
the driver that slams on their brakes and comes to a complete stop in
reaction to that driver slamming on their brakes and coming to a
complete stop.

That's the legal standard.  Drive as if you're aware of it, or suffer
the possible consequences.

So?  That's the way many people drive.  I would think you would have
made this observation long before you obtained a license had you not
been otherwise occupied in the back seat during your formative years.

Obviously, the ink on your license is not yet dry.

How other people drive is none of your business, unless you're a cop,
and unless they run into you, since how they drive is beyond your
control.  All that is within your control is how you drive.

Do it safely, and do your best to learn from the errors you observe
and commit.

The white line crossing the onramp at 11 o'clock is a stop light to
meter heavy traffic at rush hour. People sometimes stop, even when the
lights aren't operating, and traffic is moving at speed. The ramp is
banked and fairly steep uphill. (I can scrape pegs easily where the
trees cast a shadow on the ramp.)  I follow cars often who are doing
no more than 30mph at the little red arrow (near the I5 symbol.) The
merge lane starts disappearing before the end of the overpass bridge.

That's OK, my highway driving instruction consisted of getting out on

I didn't really dislike my instructor and did learn some valuable

That's a separate issue entirely.  In any case, around here the right
lane is usually pretty empty even in heavy traffic, so I have no
sympathy for poor mergers.

Okay. You sure spend a lot of time to simply say &quot;I don't care that
other people make driving suck for everyone else.&quot;

That's all you need to write going forward. I just saved you a lot of
time...

What exactly is your malfunction troll? Are you really that stupid?
Context appears to be a HUGE problem for you. That was in the context of
ALL driving. And far more being they *might* obey it on a surface street

a cop or not.

Well, the truth is that I *have* done quite a few driver's training
courses above and beyond those which I was required to take to get my
license.  I've held many jobs over the years which required me to take
various safety refreshers, and one job that required me to take a
special in-vehicle &quot;low coefficient&quot; (i.e. winter road) driving
course.  I also have had quite a bit of experience driving in poor
conditions, both on road (I grew up in Pennsylvania, after all) and on
a test track, and at home have a bookshelf full of various books on
advanced driving techniques.  And unlike you, I have attempted to
learn all this information and apply it to my day to day driving in an
effort to become a better, safer driver.  About the only thing I
*haven't* done is to take an actual race-oriented in-car driving
course or regularly compete in competitive events (both of which I'd
like to do someday.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The irony and hypocrisy are amusing.

&gt; How so...?

Because you obviously have no clue how to drive in a safe, considerate
manner and yet you chide anyone who attempts to correct your
misinformation.  You're a shining example of a person who has no self-
awareness of his own incompetence.
