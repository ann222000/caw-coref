&quot;People can't believe it now, but when they came over, they were
green. They were a brand new band, nobody knew Robert Plant, nobody
knew John Paul Jones, nobody knew John Bonham. Their first date with
us was Vanilla Fudge and Spirit, and we were already sold out when
they were added to the show. When they went on, the audience was
yelling, 'Bring on The Fudge.' It was hilarious. I remember telling
Robert Plant he should move around more on the stage. In March (2004),
we went to Europe, played England, and Robert came up to jam with The
Fudge. We told that story on stage and we both had a chuckle about it.
Then they became so big. I got John Bonham a Ludwig endorsement, the
same drums that I had, which were big 26 base drums - a totally unique
Ludwig kit that started all these crazy sizes. Bonzo saw it and loved
it, so I got him the endorsement. Six months later when they came back
to tour again, we toured together again, but this time it was equal
bill. They got so big so fast, then they went on to become the biggest
band in the world. We played with Hendrix, Cream, The Who, and at
times, we blew everybody off the stage. We were a very hard act to
follow, we were known for being very aggressive live and different
from anyone else. We were wondering who was going to blow us off - it
was Led Zeppelin.&quot;--- Carmine Appice, 2006

Yeah, I read that not to long ago. I saw the Fudge last month. And
even today they're still better then 90% percent of what they call
rock these days. Sure every song was a cover, but the musicianship was
great. And all of them can sing. A rock band that harmonizes, imagine
that?
Carmine has always been a big Zeppelin fan. The Fudge just released  a
Zeppelin cover album themselves. And at the show, Zeppelin were
mentioned at least twice during their short set. So maybe I should
take his comments with a grain of salt. The Who were considered one of
(if not) the finest live bands ever to grace a stage. And Zeppelin
have often been cited as not that great live. So when you hear him say
they blew The Who off the stage in 1967, but in 2 short years Zeppelin
blew them off, it does make you scratch your head. Even Pete mentions
in the book AAA  that they had trouble following them because they
were so hot. Makes you wish you were at the only Who/Zep show (May 25,
1969) that they ever played together, to witness it with your very own
eyes.

I remember going to a Led Zeppelin concert several years ago and I
enjoyed it. It was always great to see and hear the guys jam; but The
Who's performances really pump you up. It's gets the blood rushing--
it's incredible energy. The really interesting spectacle was perhaps
Keith Moon himself, just pounding away on those drums. They were a
good band live because of the energy they put forth, but Zeppelin was
different. It was a mystique that they wanted to create onstage, which
I never charged for much myself.
