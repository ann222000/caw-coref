Seems the insurance company I have been with for so long may soon be
missing some of my money. They wanted half of what I was paying for
the girl and myself, just for her. So I will be dropping their
coverage except for 15 buck a month for medical coverage only for me.
As of this time I have no need for drugs and I can add that coverage
later if I forsee a need. She will be covered by Chips.
Seems there is some good in this society after all.

Not sure I understand your problem.  Perhaps you could explain better.  As I
understand it, you were paying X for coverage for two people and when you
went to cover only one person, they wanted X/2?  That seems pretty
straightforward to me.

I think joevan is referring to a money problem which may be solved.  He
kinda' stuck the may &amp; be together by accident.

It's always a good day when you find money.

It's a better day when you find it in the woods.  LOL

I agree that the state should not supply healthcare.  I prefer free market
reforms myself.  I would also like to see the pre-tax benefit I receive
through my employer such as the Medical Savings Account (MSA) available to
everyone.

This whole CHIPS thing is being destroyed at the state level where some
states flaunt the federal guidelines.  It is being destroyed at the federal
level where those (states) who spend over their limit get more federal money
to support it.  Leave it to politicians to screw up what could be a
reasonable program for those who truly need assistance.

However, I don't know joevan's finances, or needs to support your point of
view.

As I recall JV is turning 65 and I would guess his income is down to
the point where he legitimately qualifies for CHIP insurance for his
minor child.

And if not,  I would rather see him get the money crookedly than make
it available to Head Thief Bush for transmission to Iraq's crooks,
especially those wearing Halliburton hats.

Better our crooks than their crooks.

I have no measure of intelligence.  But I think that a person who pays
taxes is properly entitled to benefit.  Choosing to pay double strikes
me as stupid.  I guess in your world these people build their own

&gt;&gt;:What manner is that?  I acknowledge there is abuse in CHIP.  But even
&gt;&gt;:private insurance can be and often is abusive.

&gt;Just because you don't want to acknowledge someone taking advantage of

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

This and other postings of yours make such an assumption reasonable.

MSA works only if you have sufficient income to benefit. A point that misses
most of the market that needs insurance but cannot afford it.

I know foster parents that qualify for CHIPs for their foster/adopted kids
(based on their gross income) but don't qualify for CHIPs for their natural
born kids based on the same income.  (below the fed def of poverty
regardless).

Perhaps I should point out that many in Washington firmly believe that there
is no hunger in the USA and that all have access to medical care.

Free market works only when there is a true free market.  Insurance
companies benefit from a lot of legislation that skews the free market in

&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;&gt; Seems the insurance company I have been with for so long may soon be
&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;&gt; missing some of my money. They wanted half of what I was paying for
&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;&gt; the girl and myself, just for her. So I will be dropping their
&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;&gt; coverage except for 15 buck a month for medical coverage only for me.
&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;&gt; As of this time I have no need for drugs and I can add that coverage
&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;&gt; later if I forsee a need. She will be covered by Chips.
&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;&gt; Seems there is some good in this society after all.

&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;
&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;Not sure I understand your problem.  Perhaps you could explain better.  As I
&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;understand it, you were paying X for coverage for two people and when you
&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;went to cover only one person, they wanted X/2?  That seems pretty
&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;straightforward to me.

&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:I was saying that their charge for a teen vs an old hand as myself
&gt; &gt;:&gt;&gt;:seems too high. Now I can get more for a whole lot less.
&gt; &gt;:&gt;
&gt; &gt;:&gt;Yeah, by taking it from the taxpayer.  State subsidized insurance is
&gt; &gt;:&gt;provided for those who cannot afford insurance for their children, not
&gt; &gt;:&gt;for those who are too cheap to pay their own insurance.
&gt; &gt;:&gt;
&gt; &gt;:&gt;You're a shining example of why Bush will veto the SCHIP bill that
&gt; &gt;:&gt;congress is putting forth.
&gt; &gt;:
&gt; &gt;:As I recall JV is turning 65 and I would guess his income is down to
&gt; &gt;:the point where he legitimately qualifies for CHIP insurance for his
&gt; &gt;:minor child.

&gt; As if, by some magical means, the taxpayer is responsible for his lack
&gt; of planning?  Turning 65 and becoming elgible for Medicare is
&gt; something that has been known for some years.  It's not as if his
&gt; daughter suprisingly didn't age faster.

&gt; FWIW, there are many folks that are income elgible for CHIP insurance
&gt; for their minor children who chose not to accept WELFARE, and pay
&gt; their own way.  Were CHIP not abused in such a manner, more folks
&gt; would be willing to fund such a program.  It's such abuse that

&gt; So you really think this makes a difference to your Congress Critters.

This is a problem, I have seen it before.  However what you describe above

| &gt; available to everyone.
| &gt; | &gt;
| &gt; | &gt; MSA works only if you have sufficient income to benefit. A point
that
| &gt; | &gt; misses most of the market that needs insurance but cannot afford it.
| &gt; |
| &gt; | Never the less, it shouldn't be the government's decision as to what
| &gt; people can afford.  I still say that MSAs should be made available, and
let the
| &gt; | consumer decide for himself whether he can afford it.
| &gt;
| &gt; And that solves the problem of those that cannot afford to provide
medical
| &gt; coverage for their kids?
|
|
| That is not a claim I made.  My original comment was stands as is.  You
| introduced the affordability problem.

Affordability *is* the crux of the matter.

| &gt; |
| &gt; | &gt; I know foster parents that qualify for CHIPs for their
foster/adopted
| &gt; kids (based on their gross income) but don't qualify for CHIPs for their
| &gt; | &gt; natural born kids based on the same income.  (below the fed def of
poverty
| &gt; | &gt; regardless).
| &gt; | &gt;
| &gt; | &gt; Perhaps I should point out that many in Washington firmly believe
that
| &gt; | &gt; there is no hunger in the USA and that all have access to medical
| &gt; care.
| &gt; |
| &gt; | It's an odd thing though, America, the only country with fat poor
| &gt; children.

Perhas a better word than hunger would be 'malnurished' and there is still
the problem of access to medical care.

| &gt; | &gt; Free market works only when there is a true free market.  Insurance
| &gt; | &gt; companies benefit from a lot of legislation that skews the free
market
| &gt; in their favor (ERISA comes to mind).
| &gt; |
| &gt; | I am aware that there are regulatory issues which skew insurance and
| &gt; medical costs.  From what I understand these costs would drop with a bit
more
| &gt; free market deregulation.
| &gt;
| &gt; I can't say that with any real assurances as the insurance industry and
| &gt; medical insurance in particular are well adapted to game the system.
| &gt;
| &gt; As example Texas had a proposed bill to requiring the insurance industry
| &gt; to pay in a timely manner (&lt;90 days).  Aside from keeping the money
longer
| &gt; the contract read to the effect any invoice not submitted AND processed
with
| &gt; in that 90 days was considered invalid.  The only option for the
provider was
| &gt; to resubmit with the same terms.
| &gt;
| &gt; One dodge the insurnce industy used was to 'lose the paper work' the
other
| &gt; was down coding.
| &gt;
| &gt; Physicians and providers were behind that bill 100%, the insurance
| &gt; industry was not.  Big lobby campaign, lots of donations, want to guess
who
| &gt; prevailed?
|
| This is a problem, I have seen it before.  However what you describe above
| is not free market deregulation.  Deregulate, and open up competition, and
| the free market will cause downward pressure on the cost of medical care.

No augment on these points the problem is how to balance the scales toward a
true free market?

Some things by their very nature can only properly addressed/done by
government.   Depending on the market generates only short term benefit to
the few as that often involves only short term planning.  Not unlike
building roads where people want/need to go today with out planning for
where traffic will be going tomorrow and tomorrow's tomorrow.
