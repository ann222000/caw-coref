I am less than six months with a 99 passat and lately started smelling
a slight burning smell at times. I am not sure what it is but it seems
to be associated with manual shifting in town or perhaps some rougher
than ideal shifts. I am using the heater almost 100% as the ambient
temperature here is single digits. Can you recommend some things I
might check? Manual trans fluid - where is this at? This is a great
group for new VW owners. Thank you in advance.

sounds like you have a clutch disc that's slipping causing it to burn.
an indication would be that the clutch pedal is almost all the way released
before you feel the car starting to move in first gear.

No, I think the clutch works properly. However, I did start to notice
small oil areas in my garage. I switched to synthetic right after I
purchased this 99 Passat V6 used. I wonder if the synthetic loosened
all the dinosaur sludge and this is a byproduct of that? If this is
the case do I switch back or go for the all day tighten-everything-in-
sight with expensive mechanic time? Thanks again.
