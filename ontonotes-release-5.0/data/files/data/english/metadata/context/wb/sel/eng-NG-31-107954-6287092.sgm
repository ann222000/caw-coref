Got some Delta black cleats for about $5, but I use red cleats.  Now if
I put those black ones on, what kind of damage will I due to my legs, if
any?  Is there a way to convert a black cleat to have the same float as the
red?  When the black ones wear, due they get float, or are they always
locked in with no float?  Is it harder to get out of the pedal with a black
cleat?

Many cyclists prefer the black cleats.  If you set them up (very) carefully
and have no abnormalities or prior injuries, then the black cleats may be
fine for you.

Black-no float, Red-float. No way to tell what you may do to your legs
or anything else.

I'd try the grey cleats first before moving to black.
You're talking about a $17 retail list price part.
That's probably less than a month's worth of Glucosamine/Condroitin
supplement.

(third hand information)
A person at the LBS said that he has heard from a orthopedic doctor
that black cleats are the single largest factor in problems for
cyclists that he sees.

None. I have red cleats on one pair of shoes, and black on another and
go back and forth with no problems.

Why bother? Red cleats don't cost much if you want/need the float.

I think it's easier to get out of the pedal with black cleats since you
don't have to go past the float to disengage.

Seems like all the worn out look cleats i've replace for riders are
red.   Does the red wear out faster or is it because nearly all the
lookers use red?

The Grey Arc ones are just Red Arc sold by Campagnolo or Shimano.

I believe your doc is mistaken, a scaremonger or sees a selected group
of people - the ones whose knees warrant medical advice. Certainly for a
hundred years cleats didn't wiggle and no one died. I agree it's good we
have Red Arc cleats.  And the infinite-slop Speedplay.  There are riders
who could not ride otherwise. But try a reality check - most riders
aren't broken, diseased, worn out or otherwise in need of therapy.
Regular Black cleats work fine for us.

I'll respectuflly disagree. We used to see *far* more knee problems, back in
the day of fixed cleats, than we do now. I don't think it's a coincidence.
And when observing someone's pedaling (while riding behind them), you'll
find very, very few whose legs don't do a bit of wobbling or interesting
little movements. I can't believe that it's a good thing to force your legs
to go someplace they don't want to; it's certainly not something that
happens during other load-bearing activities (running or walking).

But I'm absolutely serious that we've seen a marked reduction in knee issues
since the introduction (and use) of floating cleats. Black cleats obviously
work fine for some, and the current crop of riders aren't "broken, diseased,
worn out or otherwise in need of therapy" (aside from the former runners).
But the comparison should go back to the time when floating cleats weren't
an option.

Red is by far the most popular; there's no reason I can think of why one
version would wear out faster than the other.

I noticed that on longer rides that really push my ability that my knees
would always hurt afterwards. By chance one ride I noticed that when I was
tired my pedaling motion was compromised and my foot and knees were moving
all over the place. The pedals at the time were Samson Stratics that had
adjustable float, much like Speedplay Zeros. I cranked the adjustment screws
to limit the float and volia the knee pain on long rides went away.

I am using Look Keos now with the red cleat and feel the the grays may be
better from me. I don't need that much float and it makes dismounted more
difficult. Black may be fine too, but the key thing when you get cleats with
less float is the the position of the cleats must be that much better!

I agree re scaremonger &amp; have concerns re overly restricted movement,
but

allowing your legs to wobble how they want to wobble is not necesarily
better.  In fact, can be worse.  If the wobble is because of a
biometric mechanical problem, allowing the wobble can exaserbate the
problem.  After 20 years of not recognizing why she had a small but
discernible "funny" movement in her legs when running, my wife - under
instruction from a physical therapist (no doctor ever figured out the
problem) - had to retrain her mind and her body HOW TO WALK, and her
core is so messed up she will never run again.

So, sometimes, your body will do "wobbly" things to avoid current pain.
And the result may well be a MUCH WORSE chronic pain later.
