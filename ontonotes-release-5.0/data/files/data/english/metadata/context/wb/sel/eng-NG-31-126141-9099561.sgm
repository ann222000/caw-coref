Technically impossible. A moderated newsgroup group must always have
been moderated from its creation.

This has usually been a rather low-volume group.  There's more volume
in alt.fan.tolkien.

The current sporge plague will probably go on until the sporger gets
bored with what, in all truth, has got to be a very boring pastime.
(I mean, how would you like to have to get your kicks by talking
nonsense?) That may be soon.

Not quite correct. There have in the past been Usenet votes to change
unmoderated groups to moderated status. I think you're correct in
spirit (though not &quot;technically&quot;), since that vote has to meet the
same criteria as the vote to create a new newsgroup.

The big problem, as always, is finding moderators (note plural) who
(a) have everyone's respect and (b) are willing to do the job.

The current attacks are not confined to this group. Several of the
linux groups have been hit as well and I suspect probably many other
groups. As for making you a moderator have you learnt nothing from the
corrupting power of the ring :-)

Which can often be a very big problem since the general respect is
rarely compatible with a willingness, and certainly not with an
eagerness, to moderate others.

Contact your newsserver administrator, and ask him to filter the trash.
Other newsservers can do that pretty well. Or maybe its time to change
your server.

I don't see much trash, and yes, among this trash you see we're having
useful discussions :-) In other words, the impact of this trash are
pretty low. If too many servers cannot cope with it, maybe we actually
should go ahead with the [RABT] tagging.

And it's easy to get past the moderation, unless you throw in a bit
of cryptography. But then you need moderators with the technical
knowledge, and also servers which honor the additional information.
This won't help on those server which don't do that, which are probably
the same servers who can't cope with the spam at the moment :-)

So nothing gained, except life for regulars is now more difficult,
and the moderators have to spend time doing their job.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes. And besides that, you need moderators only if you have to
moderate *contents*, because normal people cannot behave (which
fortunately isn't the case in this group). Moderating isn't the answer
to machine-generated flood. There are other technical means that help
against flood, and your newsadministrator should know how to use them.

More than that, _this_ newsgroup can never be moderated.  I've been through
the process, and it wasn't that difficult to make a moderated group after
our original newsgroup was destroyed by a couple of people with grudges,
but the moderated group will _always_ be a new group (so we'd get
rec.arts.books.tolkien.moderated) and the old group will remain as a place
for the nuts to play.  The Big-8 newsgroup board will never approve
converting an unmoderated group to a moderated one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yeah, right.  In fact, it _costs_.  Somebody has to pay for an account that
allows them to issue control messages on the group (most newsgroup service
providers won't let you cancel anybody else's messages, and many won't even
let you cancel your own - moderation absolutely requires that ability).
Then you need a web host where the moderation software can run.

Well, now you're just throwing up road blocks, Mr. Gloomy Gus.

It's a good thing you weren't in the meeting in Rivendell.

;)

I think web-based message boards have removed a lot of the enthusiasm (and
perhaps the need?) for moderated NGs. After all, the operator of a web-
based board has near absolute control of the whole shootin' match, starting
with the server(s) the board run(s) on.

I used to participate in alt.tv.x-files (when the show was on the air).
After a while, there was a push for alt.tv.x-files.moderated, and it came
into being. There was a honeymoon, when people used it a lot, then interest
dropped and it just sort of dwindled away, like the works of the Three.

Did you miss the fact that Usenet is not what it used to be?  There are no
longer Usenet votes.  You make a case to the Big-8 board and they make a
decision.  They take polls into account, but it's not a democracy and it
isn't a vote.  Big-8 policy is that they will NOT change a group to
moderated status.

No, I think it's a safe bet that comp.lang.asm.x86 predates the Big-8
newsgroup board of directors (or whatever their official name is).  In
those days, one person had near godlike control of usenet.  Current policy

I don't like them, either. Too much sucking up to the admins and mods.
Obviously moderated NGs have mods, but they're still wild and wolly
compared to a web-based board run by a company.

I was posting on a board about the pricing policy of the company, comparing
the company's products to competing (and cheaper) products. I was
criticising, but I wasn't slamming the company or calling it Sauron's
Supplier of Evil Widgets. But the admins deleted the entire thread,
presumably because discussing pricing policy and/or comparing the company's
products to competing products is/are verboten.

Now cliquishness is pretty much the same on web-based boards as on a NG,
assuming similar user base, size and scope. At least that's my perception.

Exactly... never used usenet nor do i have any inkling of what it is
or how it functions... never heard of the Big-8... and no my ISP
doesn't have a news-server either... I do use google groups... or
atleast used it when there wasnt this much spam on this group...
haven't been checking in lately... and with this much garbage here its
kind of tough to figure out on my feed-reader which posts are genuine
and which are not... neways.. ('Anyways' for those who have difficulty
figuring out...) nice to know people still post here :)...

I'm rather new to usenet groups and i would really appreciate if
anyone would tell me if  there is any way i can filter the posts... or
whatever... you get the idea right?
Otherwise i guess ill just spend some extra time sorting the contents
and figuring out for myself...

Thanks to you all...

You are already using it. Usenet is an old part of the Internet that
uses a protocol different from the World Wide Web. Google offers a Web
interface for it, together with its own discussion groups, and calls
both together &quot;Google Groups&quot;, but it isn't a particular efficient way
to use it.

But if you're asking for a group to be moderated, you must have at
least some idea how it works.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; never heard of the Big-8...
">

The Big-8 are the biggest Usenet &quot;domains&quot; (the first part of the group
name, i.e. &quot;rec&quot;, &quot;alt&quot;, &quot;comp&quot;, etc.). Besides those eight, there are
several others (for example &quot;de&quot; for German groups, and lots more),
but these are administrated independently.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and no my ISP doesn't have a news-server either...
">

There are plenty of free news-servers, and also some very good ones
like individial.net which require a small fee.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I do use google groups... or atleast used it when there wasnt this
&gt; much spam on this group...
">

Then this would be a good opportunity to stop using Google, switch to
a proper newsreader, and get a real news-server.

There should really be enough FAQs for this, including an introduction
into Usenet, and Netiquette and all. Does anyone have a URL?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

On Google, you loose. On a different news-server, say, individual.net,
they do the filtering for you. If that's not enough, many newsreaders
have good configurable filters. For example, with my newsreader I could
have filtered for all those spam-postings with a long subject all in
lowercase. I didn't have to, because never enough of them arrived here
I couldn't handle in 5 seconds or so, but I could have.

BTW, the flood seems to be over, at least I get nothing here any more.

Moving a little off-topic here I suspect but can I suggest that you
pick up software specific to newsgroups. Are you using windows? Many
use Agent or Xnews. Linux many use Pan. It will make a difference and
filtering becomes possible + there will not be the automatic

Sorry, but that's just wrong.

There are several good news providers. I don't have a list for you,
but my particular one costs about $10 a year. For anyone who can
afford to pay or Internet access at all, $10 a year is essentially
free.

On the internet, that doesn't really matter, as long as the packets

Then you should have had some other method than web-based access
back then, didn't you? I don't really remember when Google took

As for free feeds, afaik, individual.net was the last reliable one, and it's

free access server pops up, but they are usually bogged down immediately,

Oh yes, though we are more into irony.

I read and write usenet off-line. As I have already pointed out, that is one
reason why I prefer usenet over web-forums. I don't maintain a list, since
my need for such a service disappeared some time ago. But since you ask
http://www.google.com/search?q=usenet+service+free should do the trick.

I use a relatively small ISP in the UK. They used to offer their own
news server but in the last few weeks have entered a contract with
Giganews.

I remember one post some years ago in a group called demon.service about
the UK ISP demon. This was from Malcolm Muir, one of the chief techies
at demon. He had been away for a few weeks, and when he got back he saw
this huge bank of computers. What's that? he said. &quot;That's our news
server&quot; was the reply.

I hear more and more people saying that their ISP has dropped usenet -

Earthlink still provides it; however, if it goes out, and I go to
their Website to see if they are aware of the outage (they can't fix

If the outage is for an /important/ service, like &quot;Email&quot;, I could

And when, exactly, did you &quot;join&quot; rabt? About a year ago by my reckoning,
and you think this is the worst the group has been?

Some would argue that the Jackson Film discussions totally disrupted
&quot;serious&quot; Tolkien discussion for over five years and the group has never
been the same since.

Others fail to note that there is a natural renewal period for groups
during which they will seem more or less unstructured than they were and
this is not necessarily a bad thing as it allows newbies like you to gain
a foothold and promote on-topic discussion.

If you want it done, do it yourself.

This is generally true. I have subscribed to one group for many years.
In the beginning, they organised meets and all sorts but that activity
seems to have gone dormant at the moment.

At the risk of being declared off topic I used SuSE Linux for a while to
evaluate it, and while Open Office was okay [and the current version is
on my PC] there really is no decent Drawing suite. Varicad is okay, but
more angled towards the mechanical engineer and misses a lot of features
Windows CAD users take for granted in something like say ZWCAD.

Ob Tolkien:

Tolkien didn't use a computer to write his works - just as well as he
would probably have deleted all his earlier drafts thus depriving
Christopher Tolkien of making a living and depriving us all of many hours
of alternative/evolving history research.
