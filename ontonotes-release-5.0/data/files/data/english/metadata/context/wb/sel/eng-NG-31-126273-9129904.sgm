Subject: ATLAS SHRUGGED
Title: The New World Order Files
Author: David Allen Rivera

In 1957, a 1,168 page book by Ayn Rand, called _Atlas Shrugged_, was
published. According to one source, Rand was alleged to be a mistress to
Philippe Rothschild, who instructed her to write the book in order to
show that through the raising of oil prices, then destroying the oil
fields and shutting down the coal mines, the Illuminati would take over
the world. It also related how they would blow up grain mills, derail
trains, bankrupt and destroy their own companies, till they had
destroyed the economy of the entire world; and yet, they would be so
wealthy, that it would not substantially affect their vast holdings. The
novel is about a man who stops the motor of the world, of what happens
when &quot;the men of the mind, the intellectuals of the world, the
originators and innovators in every line of industry go on strike; when
the men of creative ability in every profession, in protest against
regulation, quit and disappear.&quot;

If we are to believe that the book represents the Illuminati's plans
for the future, then the following excerpts may provide some insight to
the mentality of the elitists who are preparing us for one-world
government.

One of the characters, Francisco d'Anconia, a copper industrialist and
heir to a great fortune, the first to join the strike, says: &quot;I am
destroying d'Anconia Copper, consciously, deliberately, by plan and by
my own hand. I have to plan it carefully and work as hard as if I were
producing a fortune- in order not to let them notice it and stop me, in
order not to let them seize the mines until it is too late...I shall
destroy every last bit of it and every last penny of my fortune and
every ounce of copper that could feed the looters. I shall not leave it
as I found it- I shall leave it as Sebastian d'Anconia found it- then
let them try to exist without him or me!&quot; A bit later, d'Anconia says:
&quot;We produced the wealth of the world- but we let our enemies write its
moral code.&quot; Still later, he says: &quot;We'll survive without it. They won't.&quot;

Dagney Taggart, the main character of the book, is the head of the
Taggart Transcontinental Railroad. Her goal was to find out who John
Galt was. She discovered that he was a young inventor with the Twentieth
Century Motor Company, who said he would put an end to the regulations
which bound a man to his job indefinitely. Before disappearing, he said:
&quot;I will stop the motor of the world.&quot; He told her: &quot;Dagney, we who've
been called 'materialists'...we're the only ones who know how little
value or meaning there is in material objects...we're the ones who
create their value and meaning. We can afford to give them up...We are
the soul, of which railroads, copper mines, steel mines, and oil wells
are the body- and they are living entities that beat day and night, like
our hearts, in the sacred function of supporting human life, but only so
long as they remain our body, only so long as they remain the
expression, the reward and the property of achievement. Without us, they
are corpses and their sole product is poison, not wealth or food, the
poison of disintegration that turns men into hordes of scavengers...You
do not have to depend on any material possessions, they depend on you,
you create them, you own the one and only tool of production...leave
them the carcass of that railroad, leave them all the rusted nails and
rotted ties and gutted engines- but don't leave them your mind.&quot;

Later in the book, Galt says: &quot;And the same will be happening in every
other industry, wherever machines are used- the machines which they
thought could replace our minds. Plane crashes, oil tank explosions,
blast furnace breakouts, high tension wire electrocutions, subway
cave-ins, and trestle collapses- they'll see them all. The very machines
that made their life so safe- will now make it a continuous peril...You
know that the cities will be hit worst of all. The cities were made by
the railroads and will go with them...When the rails are cut, the city
of New York will starve in two days. That's all the supply of food its
got. It's fed by a continent three thousand miles long. How will they
carry food to New York? By directive and ox-cart? But first, before it
happens, they'll go through the whole of the agony- through the
shrinking, the shortages, the hunger riots, the stampeding violence in
the midst of the growing stillness...They'll lose the airplanes first,
then their automobiles, then their trucks, then their horsecarts...Their
factories will stop, then their furnaces and their radios. Then their
electric light system will go.&quot;

Francisco d'Anconia, who blew up all the copper mines in the world,
said of Galt: &quot;He had quit the Twentieth Century. He was living in a
garret in a slum neighborhood. He stepped to the window and pointed at
the skyscrapers of the city. He said that we had to extinguish the
lights of the world, and when we would see the lights of New York go
out, we would know that our job was done.&quot;

Galt led the men of the mind, on strike, and they retired to a
self-supporting valley, where a character, Midas Mulligan, says that
&quot;the world is falling apart so fast that it will soon be starving. But
we will be able to support ourselves in this valley.&quot; Galt said: &quot;There
is only one kind of men who have never been on strike in human
history...the men who have carried the world on their shoulders, have
kept it alive, have endured torture as sole payment...Well, their turn
has come. Let the world discover who they are, what they do and what
happens when they refuse to function. This is the strike of the men of
the mind.&quot;

The book describes what resulted from the strike: &quot;But years later,
when we saw the lights going out, one after another, in the great
factories that had stood like mountains for generations, when we saw the
gates closing and the conveyer belts turning still, when we saw the
roads growing empty and the streams of cars draining off, when it began
to look as if some silent power were stopping the generators of the
world and the world was crumbling quietly...&quot; And the culmination of
their efforts: &quot;The plane was above the peaks of the skyscrapers when
suddenly, with the abruptness of a shudder, as if the ground had parted
to engulf it, the city had disappeared from the face of the earth. It
took them a moment to realize that the panic had reached the power
stations - and the lights of New York had gone out.&quot; The men of the mind
had taken over the world.

Ayn Rand, author of _Atlas Shrugged_, which was a bestseller; had
previously written _We the Living_ (1936); _The Fountainhead_ (1943),
which became a 1949 movie starring Gary Cooper as an architect willing
to blow up his own work, rather than see it perverted by public housing
bureaucrats; and _Anthem_ (1946). She later wrote _For the New
Intellectual_ (1961), _Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal_ (1966), and _The
New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution_ (1970). She also published a
monthly journal (with Nathaniel Branden, a psychological theorist)
called _The Objectivist_.

Rand based her novel on her philosophy which she calls Objectivism. As
she puts it: &quot;We are the radicals for capitalism...because it is the
only system geared to the life of a rational being...The method of
capitalism's destruction rests on never letting the world discover what
it is that is being destroyed.&quot; She also said about the book: &quot;I trust
that no one will tell me that men such as I write about don't exist.
That this book has been written - and published - is proof that they do.&quot;

In the book _Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal_, in a chapter titled &quot;Is
Atlas Shrugging&quot; she wrote that &quot;the purpose of this book is to prevent
itself from being prophetic.&quot; She also quoted several news stories which
seemed to indicate that the world was indeed being depleted of its
brains and intellectuals.

Is _Atlas Shrugged_ a coded blueprint for the Illuminati's plans of
bringing this world to a point where they can institute a one world
government. It certainly is thought provoking, and it is included only
for the sake of conjecture. Being that the Illuminati is destroying our
economy, and they do control the corporate structure of the United
States, if not the world, there just may be something to this book, and
maybe we should consider it a warning.

This address of Rabbinovich was published in the U.S. Publication
'Common Sense', and re-published in the September issue of the
Canadian Intelligence Service. Rabbi Rabbinovich speaking to an
assembly in Budapest, Hungary on the 12th January 1952 stated:

&quot;We will openly reveal our identity with the races of Asia or Africa.
I can state with assurance that the last generation of white children
is now being born. Our control commission will, in the interests of
peace and wiping out inter-racial tensions, forbid the Whites to mate
with Whites.

The white women must co-habit with members of the dark races, the
White man with black women. Thus the White race will disappear,
for mixing the dark with the white means the end of the White Man,
and our most dangerous enemy will become only a memory.

We shall embark upon an era of ten thousand years of peace and
plenty, the Pax Judiaca, and OUR RACE will rule undisputed over
the world.

Our superior intelligence will enable us to retain mastery over a
world of dark peoples.&quot;
