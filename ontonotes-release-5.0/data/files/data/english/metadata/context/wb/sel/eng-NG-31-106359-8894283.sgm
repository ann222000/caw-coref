There's too much pining about how mfw is going to shit. I agree, but it's
because usenet is dying, and AFAIK there's not much that can be done to save
it.

What newsgroups are still worth subscribing to for their
substance/usefulness, exemplary trolling, or even if they've taken over by
crazies and have a freakish appeal?

I've posted here about sci.med.cardiology. Can't pull myself away from that
group because Chung, the loonie christian cardiologist, still holds some
fascination for me (btw, I've been 'convicted' by the holy spirit).
Misc.invest.stocks used to have a good combination of info, trolls, crazies
and humor, but it's slipping. Rec.arts.movies.past has some good posts,
trolling, and a number of posters with experience in the medium (including
Jim Beaver, an excellent character actor who has some great insider
stories).  Few years ago, used to post legal advice on misc.legal and there
were some good debates about the law back then, but it's been taken over by
uninteresting flamers, spammers, etc. and has little entertainment value, so
rarely bother anymore.

A few groups the resemble this one in their combination of good stuff
and a lot of tempers and noise:

rec.bicycles.racing

alt.support.asthma

rec.music.classical.guitar

and there's no place quite like

24hoursupport.helpdesk

if your newsserver has it.

alt.guitar.bass

is one of my favorites - nice folks.

All that said, those are just my choices - there are thousands, tens of
thousands, I think, even, of newsgroups on a wide variety of subjects.
You've got my interests right there - music, bicycles, asthma, and
computers.

Try rec.humor.jewish.  It's moderated, though, so no Jewish jokes,
please.

I think usenet &quot;died&quot; because most of the idiots migrated to myspace,
facebook, friendster, and whatever other social networking site that's
been launched...good riddance, I say.  It's a lot quieter, but still
quite entertaining, in a PBS kind of way.

uk.rec.cycling is excellent, although you need to learn to recognise and
avoid (or enjoy) the all-too-frequent helmet threads.

alt.usage.english is still a classic.

I haven't been on comp.lang.python in a while, it was wonderful while i
was using python more actively. May have gone downhill. I bet the ruby
newsgroup is good.

comp.lang.java.programmer used to be superb until java went mainstream and
started growing vast tumours of 'enterprise' functionality, when it was
invaded by imbeciles asking stupid questions about stupid libraries,
mostly in quite poor english.

sci.chem and sci.math are good if you ignore or enjoy the cranks.

uk.finance is good.

uk.food+drink.misc is good, but overwhelmed by chatting between the
regulars - threads about interesting foodie topics invariably rapidly
explode into pointless gabbing. The density of middle-aged ladies also
means there's a lot of cattiness and cliquery.

uk.railway is an amazing horde of knowledge on all things transporty and
nerdy, but has, as you might imagine, a healthy dose of odd personalities.

nyc.transit is exactly like uk.railway for New York, but with added
trolls, easily ignorable. A great source for the history of NYC generally.

alt.lasers - enough said!

There's one more group, the one i've been reading most consistently for
years, which is superb - high signal-to-noise, smart and friendly people,
virtually no trolling. I'm not going to say what it is for fear of
attracting attention to it, though - i'm happy for it to stay as it is ...

there is a modded version lf misc.legal which remains useful. I'm a
provider there. Why not move on over and give it a try?

I have corresponded with Jim Beaver and agree he's an interesting
fellow. Also following your lead, I have watch Chung go on. I vastly
enjoyed one post where a pilgrim said he had no appetite &amp; Chung said he
was dying.

It was a riot.

His posts are really entertaining on one level but the man is obviously
mentally ill and that's just sad. It's also scary that he's still a licensed
cardiologist and may have patients who, given his bizarre beliefs, seemingly
could be at peril if he treats or advises them. I saw a thread that
reprinted a really stern letter from a former cardiologist boss to Chung
(after Chung had been fired less than three months after he was hired at a
clinic) in which he told Chung in detail how he was spinning out of control.
That just scratches the surface of this guy's escapades. Sometimes I feel
like I should be paying a cover charge when I check in on that NG.

How do you know he's still licensed? I can write, Paul Cassel, MD, Ph.D.
DD. after my name on this ng and who can say different?

Strangely, he's not mentally ill at all unless you think having
discussions with imaginary friends is mental illness. If you so define,
then you need to lock up the Pope and every minister, rabbi and imam in
the world.

If I say I'm receiving guidance from my beer bottle which is really a
transmitter tuned to the super beings on Arcturus, I'm a lunatic. If I
say I am receiving guidance from God, I'm Billy Graham. The proof of
either claim is the same - nothing.

Have you been reading Sam Harris? (I have.) I agree that there is little/no
basis in reality for believing christianity and most other religions, but
you can have a somewhat intelligent conversation with many religious people
about their beliefs, and they'll admit they have doubts about the beliefs
but they ultimately turn on faith. I think, among other serious problems,
Andy is delusional, and has lost his grasp of much of reality. That's my BA
in psych talking (though I also have a wife whose a PhD shrink) so it
doesn't count as a valid dx. Then again, this is usenet, so it's prolly more
valid than most conclusions.
