Well, it finally happened.  After years of listening to me
talk up the joys of recreational target shooting, my wife
has expressed interest in learning to fire a handgun.  I'm
thinking that to start her off right she should begin with a
.22.  Since I don't own one, I have no other recourse but to
buy another gun.  (I'd do anything for that woman.)  The
question is which one?

At gun shows she has picked up and griped just about
everything there is.  Her common complaint is "it's too
heavy."  Typically she gravitates to the airweight snub nose
.38s.  I try to tell her that she won't like the recoil, but
she doesn't understand.  She is obsessed with weight. (Or,
rather, the lack of it.)  I'm afraid if I get something with
heft, she won't give it a fair chance before she gives up on
it.  A gun that shoots well is of little value if she won't
shoot it.

Therefore, I'm looking at the lighter weight .22s.
Specifically, the S&amp;W 22A series (as low as 32 oz), and the
Buck Mark line (as low as 28 oz).  The Rugers are nice, but
they're heavier.  All things considered I'm thinking the
Buck Mark Lite Splash is the way to go since it is the
lightest. I don't have any personal experience with any of
them, so if there is some obvious shortcoming (e.g., rough
trigger) I'd like to hear about it.  Money really isn't an
object, since it's for her.  Besides, she got a new car this
year, so she's in no position to complain.

Comments, suggestions?

Thanks,

Al

If weight is the issue, why not look at a Walther P22?

You want a light weight .22 with a long bbl, 4" min pref 5".  Look for a
plastic or aluminum frame.

Another choice is a Glock; if you get a Glock 17 you can handload some
very mild ammo for it if you work at it.  Plastic guns are light but
softer (apparent) recoiling compared to metal.

It's ESSENTIAL that SHE picks the gun.  I took my wife to a gun show and
pointed her toward revolvers - she picked a Glock 17  and has been happy
with it, shooting as much as 3000 rds/yr and getting IPSC (womens)
trophies.

Al:

I have been debating myself among SW22A and Rugger.  I have no
experience what so ever regarding Buck Mark but I'll suggest you SW is
the way to go.

I got mine not so long ago and let me tell you:
1. Reliable
2. No problem with ammo or feeding
3. Very affordable
4. Light weight
5. Easy to take a part and clean it

I'm not very sure about accuracy but then again, I am very demanding
so I guess if you do not want to pay for a SW 41, this is the way to
go.

I have read people complaining about cheap ammo (Remington Thunerbolt)
but that's what I use with no problems at all.

Is there a range in your area with rentals?   A short demonstration of the
weight vs recoil
principal might be  a real eye-opener for her.

The Smith and Buckmarks are fine little guns, either one will work fine,
Other possibilities-----A light DA .22 revolver.   S&amp;W has some nice ones,
including some so
light that you would swear they weren't real.    Does she have small hands?
Look at the Beretta
Neos.    My wife tried darned near everything when she was shopping for a
22, and ended up
with the Neos.

Be sure you buy two 22's.   One for her, one for you.   A little friendly
competition is part of
that recreational target shooting.

The only one you mention that I've got personal experience with is the
Ruger, which of course you say is too heavy. Too bad, all of the Urge .22's
are excellent shooters. I've had mine for better than 25 years, and have put
many bricks of 22LR through it and will still "drive tacks"

As long as money is not an object, might I suggest a Beretta Cheetah Mod 87,
which is small light, (20 oz ~) and fits women pretty well.  My wife shoots
a Cheetah .380, and does pretty well with it, although I think it's got way
too much recoil for such a light load. She also can't rack the slide, but
the .22 will be much lighter. Another option is the Sig Mosquito at about 24
oz~.  Both of these are quality guns, which will hold value and are rather
"sexy" looking too.

Get some featherweight pistol and as soon as she shoots it a bit,
she'll complain it doesn't weigh enough. Tell her that there are
things to learn that aren't obvious at first, and weight, and more
importantly, the proper balance, are actually helpful. People shoot
heavy barrel .22s in competition for good reason. Women don't have a
lot of upper body strength, as a rule, but shooting two handed
shouldn't pose a problem.

Take a hard look at a Ruger 22/45 with a short barrel - it's much
lighter than the Mark series since it has a polymer frame. It's
inexpensive, well made, it shoots well and will last forever. It's
"cute" enough to please a lady.  It's a fun camp gun too. Its not a
Bulls Eye pistol, but it's plenty accurate for cans and pop bottles,
and that is where the fun is IMHO. Even if she doesn't like it, there
should be others in the house who will.

http://www.ruger-firearms.com/Firearms/FAFamily?type=Pistol&amp;subtype=R...

The downside is that the mags are a little difficult to load by hand,
esp compared to a revolver, but you can get speed loaders to fix that,
and it lets you burn up more ammo.

Taurus makes a lightweight snubbie in .17HMR, about 18 oz.

http://www.taurususa.com/products/product-details.cfm?id=49&amp;category=...

Beretta makes a model 87 Cheetah in .22LR, about 20 oz.

http://www.berettausa.com/product/product_pistols_main.htm

Neither of these are target pistols, but for plinking and to
get her started, they are fine, and the Cheetah especially
is a handsome little gun.

I have a Taurus PT-22 and an S&amp;W 22A-1. The S&amp;W is a bit heavier, but
the Taurus is real nice, plus the PT-22 is inexpensive (new &amp; used)
and easy to carry.  Nice little pistol.

I know you said pistol, but I'd recommend a small frame double action
revolver with a 3 or 4 inch barrel.    Something like the S&amp;W "Kit Gun".

A Ruger Bearcat is also a nice little gun for small hands.

A revolver is easy to operate and, as opposed to a pistol, has an exposed
hammer and magazine (so nothing seems "hidden" and thus, mysterious).

Another positive attribute for the revolver is the ability to conveniently
shoot CB caps.

I have a 22A. Nice gun, but the grips might not suit her.
I suggest you find a shooting range that rents a variety of guns.

As far as recoil from light guns, my wife has a Colt agent, a .38 spl
snubby about the size of the J-frame Smiths. She has no problem shooting
it, but it hurts my hand so that 6 shots is all I want.  The difference
appears to be that her hand, being smaller, fits the grip better.
My point is that she needs to try shooting that airweight herself.

Another possibility might be something like a Kel-Tec P11 or the new
PF9 (smaller grip). They don't get much lighter without going to a mouse
gun.

Good choice.

Nearly all .22 handguns are designed for target shooting.  They're heavy
and often have long barrels (6-8 in.) because that makes them more
accurate.  Is your honey aware of that?  Fliers are no fun.

I'm thin and not particularly strong, but I can shoot 100 rounds in one
range session from a .22 revolver that weighs over two pounds without
fatigue.  Your wife might find it's the same for her if she tries.

If cost is really no object, get a .22 and a lightweight .38 Special
revolver or 9 mm pistol.  Then she can decide which she likes better,
and she'll have a carry piece if she wants one.

I hope this advice helps a little.

- Jim

Everyone needs a .22!

Some dumbbells might be in order here.  No kidding, you've got to have
some decent muscle tone to shoot pistols well.  10-15 minutes a day,
at a minimum, holding a 5 lb dumbbell at arm's length makes a huge
difference.  Then you'll have no more complaints about "too heavy".
Can be done while watching the tube.

The S&amp;W 22A series is pretty decent, I've got the 22S, myself.  It's a
reliable gun, handles cheap ammo well.  Downside is there's a fair
amount of plastic in it.  The trigger is a non-adjustable version of
the model 41's, my example is pretty crisp.  The design is kind of a
cross between the model 41 and a High Standard, has the High Standard
pushbutton takedown and the low profile of the 41.  You can get
different grips for it from the factory, unlike some.  The one thing
that really bugs me is the recoil spring and guide.  Unless you're
very careful, it'll launch itself during takedown and assembly.  The
High Standard uses a captive rod and spring, manufacturing cost is no
doubt the consideration here.  Price has about doubled on these over
the last 5 years or so, not really the bargain it once was.  Still,
it's a good plinker and the sights are decent.

The only problem with revolver .22s is a really heavy trigger.
So you can't go wrong with a buck mark, ruger, or even a smith &amp;
wesson.

Enjoy have fun and shoot.

Take her to your range or one of those rent-a-gun places to test fire
before buying.
I'm reminded of guy that showed up at my range with new gun for his
wife and she couldn't handle the recoil.

The Rugers are available in several configurations. The ones with the long
bull barrels are heavy, but the ones with the skinny tapered barrels are not
bad at all. I don't have the specs.

But they are fun cheap plinkers.

I have also heard good things about the Beretta Neo. I'm not sure how heavy
they are.

let the flames begin...

For beginning shooters, revolvers are generally the best bet. Safety,
ease of use, etc., etc. For a person with small hands, any of the "J"
frame sized revolvers would do. One possibility might be the Ruger
Bearcat SA, which fits nicely in small hands. Tarus, S&amp;W, etc.

I have a Buck Mark as well, and that would be my choice for an
autoloader. Shoots VERY well, out of the box.

Sounds to me like a woman starting the old "insurmountable conditions" ploy.
Are you sure she really wants to shoot? If you told her that a little heft
would make a gun easier to steady for a beginner, and she is adamant about
defying that, I think there are undercurrents that need to be explored. Not
saying there is, but I always get a strong radar hit when I hear about
anyone who seizes on the first thing to argue about in a new endeavor.

The Buck Mark is a good choice, so is the standard version of the Ruger (not
the heavy barrel "target" model) since weight is a concern.  You could also
take a look at the lighter weight versions of S&amp;W revolvers like the Model
317.  Better yet try to find a used .22/.32 Kit gun or .22 Masterpiece.

You are definitely on the right track.  The best starter pistol is a .22
with a reasonably long barrel and adjustable sights.  I have High Standard,
Ruger, and Browning target pistols.  Any of these would be an excellent
choice.  You can shoot hundreds of rounds economically and without ever
developing a flinch from the recoil.  If you can borrow or rent any of
these, let her choose the one that she enjoys the most.  She may actually
recognize that a bit more weight will make the gun more enjoyable to shoot
as it can make the sight picture a bit steadier.  Definitely do not get a
.22 snubby or purse automatic as a first gun.  The short sight radius limits
accuracy so much she may become frustrated with it and then loose interest
in shooting with you as a hobby.  Save the short guns until after she gains
some proficiency with longer guns.

There are several lighter choices to consider.  The SIG Mosquito
weighs 25 oz.  The Walther P22 weighs 15 or 19 ounces depending on
which way you set it up.  If your bride can abide a revolver the Ruger
Bearcat weighs 24 oz.  The Taurus Ultra-Lite weighs 18 oz.

How about a S&amp;W K-22 revolver?

Or a "Lady Smith" (I don't know what the model # is) lightweight
steel-framed 5-shot .38 or .357?  .38 Special wadcutters are not much
hotter than .22's.

Besides weight, remember that the grip *has* to fit her hand -- if it
doesn't, she will not only have great difficulty getting accurate with it,
it will also make shooting less enjoyable. Also, as part of the weight &amp;
grip question, the balance point has to be right for her -- the whole
ineffable issue of "pointability"...

I love my Walther P22, but that pistol has a serious problem with
recoil. The .22 caliber cartridge produces an amazing recoil for such
a small cartridge. P22s are so light that they teach bad shooting
habits, especially limp wristing, which leads to miss-feeds in that
particular pistol.

It would cost more, but the best inexpensive .22 target pistol I've
found started out as a used Ruger Mark II to which I added an aluminum
upper from PacLite from Tactical Solutions in Boisie, ID. The upper
uses a stainless steel bore. The combination Ruger and PacLite give
you an accurate pistol with an almost perfect balance between weight
and recoil.

Oh, and just for completeness if nothing else, the MCM "Margolin" should
be mentioned IMHO. Designed by a blind Soviet engineer, it isn't pretty
but it works. Quite inexpensive, at least used. Not the lightest one
around but not very heavy either. Fits _my_ hand at least.

Balance could be better, I bought a suppressor (not restricted in this
country) for mine and use just the adapter part as a barrel weight most
of the time.

A reasonable first short gun for those people whose hand it fits.

Doubled?
Mine was $199.95 at Cabelas, everyday price.
And I've seen new ones advertised less since then (of course).
I don't know of a less expensive .22 auto.

Or are you talking about the High Standard?

Or.

Of course you have to get one of the .22s mentioned above.

Or all of them.

But you should probably also buy a P3.  That's how it's usually
imported, anyway, I think the manufacturer calls it the HW40.  (Hiram
Weirauch, sp?)

No recoil, low cost ammo, shoot  in the basement, accuracy as good as
the plinkers though not up to say a SW41.  Beer cans at 25 yards are
no problem.  Best $125 I ever spent on a pistol.

We're getting close.  My wife and I went to the gun shop,
and she liked the Buck Mark standard model.  She did say it
felt a little heavy, but both the salesman and I assured her
that she would shoot it better than the lighter weight
"Splash" model.  It has a real nice trigger, and the grip
fit her hand well.  The police department sent me a card
that my pistol purchase permit is ready for pick up (I live
in NJ), so now it's just a matter of exchanging money.

One more question before I do the deal, however.  Do I want
it with the Truglo front sight?  I'm thinking yes, but I
don't have any personal experience, so I don't know if there
is a downside to this type of sight.

Thanks,

Al

I would like to suggest an additional accessory. How about a small barbell
set? I've seen this issue of a gun feeling a little heavy to a member of the
fairer sex mentioned a number of times on this forum. A few reps a day and
she won't notice the perceived weight of the firearm after a few weeks. Or
she could just do up-and-on-shoulders with the gun the way we Marines did it
with our M-14s. &lt;g&gt;

You need to tell me exactly what recreational joys you've been talking
to her about. She went with me once or twice and thought it was "fun"
but has expressed no interest in going again. She just says, "nah,
i'll just do some stuff around here...". Nothing would make me happier
than to get her interested in it. Any ideas would be great..   :)

Women need a social side, I suggest joining IPSC or some other rec
shooting organization so she can interact with the people.

It's just a theory of mine, but I think a lady's interest in
guns is genetic.  In my wife's case, although she hasn't
said so, I think she finds pistols sexy.  (Some women have
actually told me they do.)

I'm sure both would do the trick, but exercising with
dumbells rather than a Buck Mark probably makes more sense.
It's much easier to follow the cardinal safety rules with
dumbells too.

You might try reactive targets.  There's something about seeing a target
spin, jump, or explode that's more rewarding than punching holes in paper.

Shooting clays with a shotgun fits in there.

Thanks, again, to those who responded to my question.  All
things considered I chose the Buck Mark Camper.  Ironically,
it is their least expensive model, even though I had said
that price was not a factor.  I liked its grips, sights,
barrel length/style.  Now all I need is some warm weather.

Good choice... Wife and I bought two of these

time with our main guns... Cheap, no recoil and accurate as hell....

Any suggestions for a small .22?

I'm giving up on that ancient IJ that I have. It's not worth the money
to take it to a gunsmith. It shoots ok (and accurately) but it's now
pretty much refusing to feed or eject. I'm having to manually cock it
between rounds even after a thorough cleaning...

New mags might fix the feeding problem, but I've no clu what do do about
the ejection problem.

I might just look at small .22 revolvers.
