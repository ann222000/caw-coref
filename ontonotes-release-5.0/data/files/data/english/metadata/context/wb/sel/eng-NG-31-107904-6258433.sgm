KANSAS CITY, Mo. - A 69-year-old woman who was shocked with a stun gun
after she honked her car horn at a police cruiser has been convicted of
resisting arrest for sparking a quarrel with officers.

A Circuit Court jury refused to send Louise Jones to jail, fining her $650
instead.

Jones’ attorney, Basil North, said he might appeal. “We don’t think she
should have been convicted of anything,” he said.
Story continues below ? advertisement

On June 15, 2004, police officers Cory Le Moine and Ryan VanDeusen
responded to a domestic disturbance call near Jones’ home. The officers
were cruising the street slowly, watching for trouble. Jones was in her car
behind the police vehicle when she honked her horn and pulled into her
driveway.

Police, spooked by the horn, parked and questioned Jones, leading to a
scuffle after they threatened to write her a ticket. The stun gun of one of
the officers discharged during the altercation, according to testimony.

The trial was Jones’ second in the case.

She and her 78-year-old husband, Fred, who tried to break up the scuffle,
had been convicted and sentenced to probation by a judge in Municipal Court
over the incident. Both appealed, and charges against the husband were
dismissed, while the wife was granted a retrial in Circuit Court.

&gt; Sounds like that naughty stun gun should be convicted of battery! How

Yeah - i noticed that nonsense too. They make it sound like the cops are

Sounds more like the all too typical behavior of cops today. The
slightest thing gets a huge over reaction and they try to send someone to
jail for _nothing_ but the cops own paranoia and need to put a beat down
on someone.

Brent:

Unfortunately, more often than not nowadays, the police DO have a lot
to be paranoid about.  I mean would you want to be out there trying to
keep the order over murderers, crack dealers, pimps, and rapists, just
to name a few?  Especially when everybody and their brother owns a gun
- many of them (semi) automatic?  I sure wouldn't want to.

However, I'll be the first to admit that I'd have a hard time using a
stun gun on your average 69 year old lady.  There's just no way I
could picture myself doing it unless she was holding a weapon at me or
trying to nail me with some other object (tire iron, pipe, etc.).

I'd be curious as to EXACTLY what she did in that scuffle.

Surely you should be pleased.

Honking the horn means she was obviously an impatient speeder.

Amazing, is it not?
I wonder what these cops would act like if they had a REAL job? Like being a
cop in Iraq right now. Instead, their job consists of sitting on their fat
asses, writing speeding tickets, and tazering little old ladies. Where do
these idiots come from? Oh, America, dumb question.
People are so out of touch.

More accurately,going after speeders is about ALL the police manage to
do.They sit inert at radar traps,while the other,far more dangerous MOVING
violations get ignored.

I often see Casselberry,Fl (Orlando suburb) police writing speeding tickets
a short distance away from one of the most dangerous intersections in
Seminole County,where may RL-running incidents and illegal right-on-red
turns occur,with many collisions in the intersection.

No matter how tough the job of being a cop is, there is no
excuse for the stomping on our basic rights that occurs to make their
life easier.

Pimps? Prostitution shouldn't be illegal in the first place. Regulated
and taxed.

Crack dealers? The government has no buisness trying to control what
people put in their bodies. It's not government's business. Tax and
regulate, the crime problem goes away.

Rapists? With legal prostitution it might go on the decline, but it's not
like cops are guarding women walking down the street or could indentify
rapists on sight or are breaking up rapes in progress. People are pretty
much on their own cop or no cop.

Murderers? See above.

And so what if everyone has a gun? Better to keep the rapists and
murderers inline if they think their victims are packing.

Probably something to do with right of way...  never really thought
about it.  Certainly whenever I feel as if my safety's been threatened
by another driver, it always involves that other driver breaking some
law, and it's always something other than the speed limit.

Driving on the proper side of a divided highway.  Rarely broken,
often fatal when it is.

In a stunning, but not-too-surprising, display by a 'Judy' supporter,
we see a two word post with *100% of the words* incorrectly spelled.

&gt;&gt; Speeders are, along with drunk drivers, the biggest killers we have

&gt;&gt; cops do.

&gt; Yet another unsupported assertion...  the speed limit is probably the

So why do speeders kill americans every day?? Speeders are a hundred times
bigger threat to you than terrorists. THINK
