China says its one-child policy has helped the fight against global
warming by avoiding 300 million births, the equivalent of the
population of the United States.

But delegates at U.N. climate change talks in Vienna said on Thursday
birth control is unlikely to find favor as a major policy theme,
partly because of opposition by the Catholic Church and some
developing nations trying to increase their population.

Some scientists say that birth control measures far less draconian
than China's are wrongly overlooked in the fight against climate
change, when the world population is projected to soar to about 9
billion by 2050 from 6.6 billion now.

&quot;Population is clearly an important factor,&quot; said Yvo de Boer, head of
the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat, at U.N. talks trying to plan a
new deal to combat climate change after 2012.

China, which rejects criticism that it is doing too little to confront
climate change, says that its population is now 1.3 billion against
1.6 billion if it had not imposed tough birth control measures in the
late 1970s.

The number of births avoided equals the entire population of the
United States. Beijing says that fewer people means less demand for
energy and lower emissions of heat-trapping gases from burning fossil
fuels.

&quot;This is only an illustration of the actions we have taken,&quot; said Su
Wei, a senior Foreign Ministry official heading China's delegation to
the 158-nation talks from Aug 27-31.

He told Reuters that Beijing was not arguing that its policy was a
model for others to follow in a global drive to avert ever more
chaotic weather patterns, droughts, floods, erosion and rising ocean
levels.

But avoiding 300 million births &quot;means we averted 1.3 billion tonnes
of carbon dioxide in 2005&quot; based on average world per capital
emissions of 4.2 tonnes, he said.

GERMANY

A country emitting 1.3 billion tonnes a year would rank just ahead of
Germany on a global list of emitters behind only the United States,
China, Russia, India and Japan.

Beijing introduced its one-child policy in the late 1970s. The rules
vary across the country but usually limit families to one or, at most
two, children.

&quot;Population has not been taken seriously enough in the climate
debate,&quot; said Chris Rapley, incoming head of the Science Museum in
London.

He favors a greater drive for education about family planning to avoid
unwanted births and slow population growth.

But tougher birth control runs into opposition from the Roman Catholic
Church, and from some developing nations which favor rising birth
rates and have per capita emissions a fraction of those in rich
nations.

Harlan Watson, the chief U.S. negotiator, said that high immigration
to the United States makes it harder to slow its rising emissions.

&quot;It's simple arithmetic,&quot; he said. &quot;If you look at mid-century, Europe
will be at 1990 levels of population while ours will be nearing 60
percent above 1990 levels. So population does matter,&quot; he said.

You are being swindled by a Communist con man.  Please see:

And this Communist con man plays with the facts.  Please see

My favorite quote from the article above:
&quot;The original Nasa data was very wiggly-lined and we wanted the
simplest line we could find,&quot; Mr Durkin [the director of this movie]
said.
I've graphed the original NASA data.  Please see:

That's the wiggly-lined truth.  It doesn't support many of the
claims
made in this move, however.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Roger should have introduced himself. He is a die hard believer that
greenhouse gas emissions are going to doom us if we don't make massive
changes in our lifestyles to curb them, particularly CO/2. He posts
frequently on &quot;alt. environment&quot; where hot and heavy arguments rage
constantly about Global Warming, and CO/2.

The question over the role of greenhouse gases in Global Warming is
Absolutely Settled for Roger Coppock and numerous others who post on
alt. environment. There are 2 sides to every question, as we know, but
on Global Warming there is only the &quot;RIght Side&quot; and the &quot;Crazy Side&quot; so
you don't have much choice.

The U.S. sent a delegation to the first Global Warming conference in
Kyoto, Japan,, now known as the Kyoto Conference. The American position
was based on a &quot;quick study&quot; done at President Bush's request.
Presumably the &quot;experts&quot; selected to do the study were qualified to
undertake such an important task.

The conclusion was ;; rising CO/2 levels in the atmosphere  are having a
miniscule effect on observed global temperature rise. There is
widespread controversy among scientists about the role of &quot;greenhouse
gases&quot; in causing Global Warming. This is the important point. It is Not
scientifically Settled that rising CO/2 is going to doom us.

Now, Roger is no dummy,, and I am certainly not implying any such thing,
if he continues to post here, as is his right, and I am sure that he is
welcome. I believe FWIW that expanding world populations and man's
impact  on, and the Drastic Changes that are affecting the natural
environments are More Than enough to explain the warming that has
occurred, and is occurring.

Auschwitz: Myths and facts
by Mark Weber

Nearly everyone has heard of Auschwitz, the German wartime
concentration camp where many prisoners-most of them Jewish-were
reportedly exterminated, especially in gas chambers. Auschwitz is
widely regarded as the most terrible Nazi extermination center. The
camp's horrific reputation cannot, however, be reconciled with the
facts.
Scholars challenge Holocaust story
Astonishing as it may seem, more and more historians and engineers
have been challenging the widely accepted Auschwitz story. These
&quot;revisionist&quot; scholars do not dispute the fact that large numbers of
Jews were deported to the camp, or that many died there, particularly
of typhus and other diseases. But the compelling evidence they present
shows that Auschwitz was not an extermination center and that the
story of mass killings in &quot;gas chambers&quot; is a myth.
The Auschwitz camps
The Auschwitz camp complex was set up in 1940 in what is now
south-central Poland. Large numbers of Jews were deported there
between 1942 and mid-1944.
The main camp was known as Auschwitz I. Birkenau, or Auschwitz II, was
supposedly the main extermination center, and Monowitz, or Auschwitz
III, was a large industrial center where gasoline was produced from
coal. In addition there were dozens of smaller satellite camps devoted
to the war economy.
Four million victims?
At the postwar Nuremberg Tribunal, the Allies charged that the Germans
exterminated four million people at Auschwitz. This figure, which was
invented by the Soviets, was uncritically accepted for many years. It
often appeared in major American newspapers and magazines, for
example. (note 1)
Today no reputable historian, not even those who generally accept the
extermination story, believes this figure. Israeli Holocaust historian
Yehuda Bauer said in 1989 that it is time to finally acknowledge the
familiar four million figure is a deliberate myth. In July 1990 the
Auschwitz State Museum in Poland, along with Israel's Yad Vashem
Holocaust Center, suddenly announced that altogether perhaps one
million people (both Jews and non-Jews) died there.  Neither
institution would say how many of these people were killed, nor were
any estimates given of the numbers of those supposedly gassed. (note
2) One prominent Holocaust historian, Gerald Reitlinger, has estimated
that perhaps 700,000 or so Jews perished at Auschwitz.  More recently,
Holocaust historian Jean-Claude Pressac has estimated that about
800,000 persons-of whom 630,000 were Jewish-perished at Auschwitz.
While even such lower figures are incorrect, they show how the
Auschwitz story has changed drastically over the years. (note 3)
Bizarre tales
At one time it was seriously claimed that Jews were systematically
electrocuted at Auschwitz. American newspapers, citing a Soviet
eyewitness report from liberated Auschwitz, told readers in February
1945 that the methodical Germans had killed Jews there using an
&quot;electric conveyor belt on which hundreds of persons could be
electrocuted simultaneously [and] then moved on into furnaces. They
were burned almost instantly, producing fertilizer for nearby cabbage
fields.&quot; (note 4)
And at the Nuremberg Tribunal, chief U.S. prosecutor Robert Jackson
charged that the Germans used a &quot;newly invented&quot; device to
instantaneously &quot;vaporize&quot; 20,000 Jews near Auschwitz &quot;in such a way
that there was no trace left of them.&quot; (note 5) No reputable historian
now accepts either of these fanciful tales.
The Höss 'confession'
A key Holocaust document is the &quot;confession&quot; of former Auschwitz
commandant Rudolf Höss of April 5, 1946, which was submitted by the
U.S. prosecution at the main Nuremberg trial. (note 6)
Although it is still widely cited as solid proof for the Auschwitz
extermination story, it is actually a false statement that was
obtained by torture.
Many years after the war, British military intelligence sergeant
Bernard Clarke described how he and five other British soldiers
tortured the former commandant to obtain his &quot;confession.&quot; Höss
himself privately explained his ordeal in these words: &quot;Certainly, I
signed a statement that I killed two and half million Jews. I could
just as well have said that it was five million Jews. There are
certain methods by which any confession can be obtained, whether it is
true or not.&quot; (note 7)
Even historians who generally accept the Holocaust extermination story
now acknowledge that many of the specific statements made in the Höss
&quot;affidavit&quot; are simply not true. For one thing, no serious scholar now
claims that anything like two and a half or three million people
perished in Auschwitz.
The Höss &quot;affidavit&quot; further alleges that Jews were already being
exterminated by gas in the summer of 1941 at three other camps:
Belzec, Treblinka and Wolzek. The &quot;Wolzek&quot; camp mentioned by Höss is a
total invention. No such camp existed, and the name is no longer
mentioned in Holocaust literature. Moreover, the story these days by
those who believe in the Holocaust legend is that gassings of Jews did
not begin at Auschwitz, Treblinka, or Belzec until sometime in 1942.
No documentary evidence
Many thousands of secret German documents dealing with Auschwitz were
confiscated after the war by the Allies. Not a single one refers to a
policy or program of extermination. In fact, the extermination story
cannot be reconciled with the documentary evidence.
Many Jewish inmates unable to work
For example, it is often claimed that all Jews at Auschwitz who were
unable to work were immediately killed. Jews who were too old, young,
sick, or weak were supposedly gassed on arrival, and only those who
could be worked to death were temporarily kept alive.
But the evidence shows that, in fact, a very high percentage of the
Jewish inmates were not able to work, and were nevertheless not
killed. For example, an internal German telex message dated Sept. 4,
1943, from the chief of the Labor Allocation department of the SS
Economic and Administrative Main Office (WVHA), reported that of
25,000 Jewish inmates in Auschwitz, only 3,581 were able to work, and
that all of the remaining Jewish inmates-some 21,500, or about 86
percent-were unable to work. (note 8)
This is also confirmed in a secret report dated April 5, 1944, on
&quot;security measures in Auschwitz&quot; by Oswald Pohl, head of the SS
concentration camp system, to SS chief Heinrich Himmler. Pohl reported
that there was a total of 67,000 inmates in the entire Auschwitz camp
complex, of whom 18,000 were hospitalized or disabled. In the
Auschwitz II camp (Birkenau), supposedly the main extermination
center, there were 36,000 inmates, mostly female, of whom
&quot;approximately 15,000 are unable to work.&quot; (note 9)
These two documents simply cannot be reconciled with the Auschwitz
extermination story.
The evidence shows that Auschwitz-Birkenau was established primarily
as a camp for Jews who were not able to work, including the sick and
elderly, as well as for those who were temporarily awaiting assignment
to other camps. That's the considered view of Dr. Arthur Butz of
Northwestern University, who also says that this was the reason for
the unusually high death rate there. (note 10)
Princeton University history professor Arno Mayer, who is Jewish,
acknowledges in a recent book about the &quot;final solution&quot; that more
Jews perished at Auschwitz as a result of typhus and other &quot;natural&quot;
causes than were executed. (note 11)
Anne Frank
Perhaps the best known Auschwitz inmate was Anne Frank, who is known
around the world for her famous diary. But few people know that
thousands of Jews, including Anne and her father, Otto Frank,
&quot;survived&quot; Auschwitz.
The 15-year-old girl and her father were deported from the Netherlands
to Auschwitz in September 1944. Several weeks later, in the face of
the advancing Soviet army, Anne was evacuated along with many other
Jews to the Bergen-Belsen camp, where she died of typhus in March
1945.
Her father came down with typhus in Auschwitz and was sent to the camp
hospital to recover. He was one of thousands of sick and feeble Jews
who were left behind when the Germans abandoned the camp in January
1945, shortly before it was overrun by the Soviets. He died in
Switzerland in 1980.
If the German policy had been to kill Anne Frank and her father, they
would not have survived Auschwitz. Their fate, tragic though it was,
cannot be reconciled with the extermination story.
Allied propaganda
The Auschwitz gassing story is based in large part on the hearsay
statements of former Jewish inmates who did not personally see any
evidence of extermination. Their beliefs are understandable, because
rumors about gassings at Auschwitz were widespread.
Allied planes dropped large numbers of  LEAFLETS , written in Polish
and German, on Auschwitz and the surrounding areas which claimed that
people were being gassed in the camp. The Auschwitz gassing story,
which was an important part of the Allied wartime propaganda effort,
was also broadcast to Europe by Allied radio stations. (note 12)
Survivor testimony
Former inmates have confirmed that they saw no evidence of
extermination at Auschwitz.
An Austrian woman, Maria Vanherwaarden, testified about her camp
experiences in a Toronto District Court in March 1988. She was
interned in Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1942 for having sexual relations
with a Polish forced laborer. On the train trip to the camp, a Gypsy
woman told her and the others that they would all be gassed at
Auschwitz.
Upon arrival, Maria and the other women were ordered to undress and go
into a large concrete room without windows to take a shower. The
terrified women were sure that they were about to die. But then,
instead of gas, water came out of the shower heads.
Auschwitz was no vacation center, Maria confirmed. She witnessed the
death of many fellow inmates by disease, particularly typhus, and
quite a few committed suicide. But she saw no evidence at all of mass
killings, gassings, or of any extermination

The bad thing about that maoist male sex selection is that there will

unwelcome trend will have international repercussions; corruption,

ABSTRACT

A substantial body of research has demonstrated that son preference
has a serious impact on the survival and well-being of female infants
and children in some parts of South and East Asia, but little is known
about the consequences of son preference in later childhood and
adolescence. We compare male and female children's growth trajectories
in height over childhood and adolescence in China, where the level of
son preference is relatively high, and the Philippines, where the
level of son preference is relatively low.
http://www.ccpr.ucla.edu/ccprwpseries/ccpr_018_07.pdf

Such a gross imbalance of the sexes will result in far more than just
an excess of pent-up Chinese men-it could well mean an unprecedented
crime wave, an AIDS epidemic or even a potential war, says sociologist
Dudley L. Poston Jr., an authority on Chinese demography who
researched China's growing population problem with Texas A&amp;M doctoral
student Karen S. Glover. They recently presented their research at an
international demography conference in Tours, France.

The reasons for the imbalance, Poston explains, can be traced to the
Chinese culture's preference for sons. China has a Confucian
patriarchal tradition, he says. Sons are preferred for many reasons,
such as to carry on the family name, to provide ancestral worship, to
provide support when the parents are old and to assist the parents is
sustenance-producing activities.
http://www.tamus.edu/systemwide/05/09/research/china.html

Along with these achievements, the sex ratio at birth of the Chinese
population has increased to significantly more males to females, and
in some provinces of China reached unprecedented levels. The ratio of
infant mortality of the males to females for manyprovinces in China
become extremely unbalanced with a much higher female infant mortality
rate. In our study, we investigated the statistical relationship
between the sex ratio at birth and the ratio of the infant mortality
of males to female. Social and economic reasons for these unnatural
trends are also discussed.
http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/soci/2005/00000070/00000003...

Chinese parents practiced infanticide to regulate the number and sex
of their children. Son preference, dating back to the origins of
ancestral worship in the second and third millennia B.C., and
hypergamy meant that daughters were not only culturally considered
inferior, they were also perceived by most families as a net economic
and emotional loss.
http://ieas.berkeley.edu/shorenstein/1998.05.html

Since that time, improved health care and conditions for women have
resulted in reductions in female mortality, but these advances have
now been offset by a huge increase in the use of sex-selective
abortion, which became available in the mid-1980s. Largely as a result
of this practice, there are now an estimated 80 million missing
females in India and China alone. The large cohorts of &quot;surplus&quot; males
now reaching adulthood are predominantly of low socioeconomic class,
and concerns have been expressed that their lack of marriageability,
and consequent marginalization in society, may lead to antisocial
behavior and violence, threatening societal stability and security.
http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/103/36/13271?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS;=10&amp;...

116.9 males per 100 females for the whole Chinese population.

I'm sorry, your reference doesn't seem to document anywhere a state mandate
to abort the pregnancies that would produce female children.

That was your complaint after all.

Are you changing your tune now that you couldn't find any evidence to
support your earlier position?  Now you are whining that the Chinese culture
is to blame?

Well the Chinese culture has been around a lot longer than yours, and has
stood the test of time, while AmeriKKKan culture has completely failed along
with the AmeriKKKan state.

I'll give you another chance to find some credible evidence to back up your
earlier assertion that the state is forcing women to abort pregnancies that
would result in the birth of females.

Historically, any significant surplus of males has tended to presage
military adventurism.

Yet there are indicators associated with a surplus of older men over younger
men which presage peacefulness within that particular society. As a rule,
the more of a surplus of young men you have, who are unrestrained by their
elders and their respect for their elders, the more crime and violence is seen.

So, we may hope that China's &quot;two parents one child&quot; policy will result in a
more peaceful China, and as it becomes more prosperous and less populous,
the government may become even less authoritarian and corrupt and become
more genuinely beneficial... and if that happens, perhaps a lot of women
from other countries will decide to go to China and marry some nice wealthy
young Chinese man.

Or perhaps a lot of Chinese will leave China in search of wives, and
possibly new homelands.

So they will war with us on a genetic level as was done in the times of

It's just being done via attrition this time?

Iraqi women kidnapped, raped
24/08/2003 14:37  - (SA)

Baghdad - More than 400 Iraqi women have been kidnapped and raped amid the
lawlessness gripping the country since the ouster of Saddam Hussein, the
Organisation of Women's Freedom in Iraq said on Sunday.

The group's director Yanar Mohammed said the four months since the US-led
coalition took control had seen an &quot;unprecedented&quot; explosion of violence
against women.

&quot;More than 400 women have endured the pain and suffering of being kidnapped,
raped and sometimes sold,&quot; she told reporters at a demonstration in
Baghdad's Fardous Square.

&quot;This violence is still a daily occurrence, especially on the streets of
Baghdad, without attracting the least attention of the (US) soldiers.&quot;

Mohammed said the attacks had created a climate of fear among women which
meant few dared venture out of their homes.

&quot;The moment a woman steps out on to the street, she is an immediate target
for humiliation, sexual assault and abduction.

&quot;The assaults against women, whether organised by professional gangs or
individual crimes supported by male chauvinism, and unleashed and unobserved
by coalition authorities, consequently turned the streets into a no-woman
zone.&quot;

Saihan Ali, a 35-year-old health ministry employee who joined the protest,
agreed.

&quot;Before, I would take a walk after work, but now I quickly return home, and
I'm always on the alert because anything can happen,&quot; she said.

The Organisation of Women's Freedom has accused US forces of not doing
enough to secure the streets.

It said it had appealed, in vain, for help from Iraq's US-appointed interim
Governing Council as well as US civil administrator Paul Bremer.

&quot;One of the justifications announced by the US administration as a pretext
for the military attack was introducing a new area of freedom for women and
men in Iraq,&quot; it said.

&quot;We demand the setting up of security guards and patrols in every main
street and a community centre on a 24-hour, seven-day basis. We also demand
heavy sentences against sex offenders.&quot; - Sapa-AF
