No, it was the Stature of Zeus in the temple of Zeus and the Stature of
Artemis in the temple of Artemis. Both were the biggest statues of male and
female Gods set in temples.

If we were compiling a list of the seven wonders of the modern world we
would have to choose the biggest of everything and they would also have to
be unique. So lets start with,

The Burj Dubai. World's tallest building at 818m when completed, 643.3m
habitable.

Ushiku Amida Buddah. World's tallest human statue at 100m.

Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge, Japan.  World's longest bridge at 1,991m.

Wembly Stadium, London. World's largest unsupported roof sturcture.

Queen Mary II. World's largest passenger ship.

USS Enterprise. World's largest war ship.

The Antenov 225. Worlds largest aircraft.

Are you SURE this was a casting? I'm not. The Statue of Liberty is
not. It is a construct with plating applied over it. I'm pretty
sure the Colossus of Rhodes was the same. Impressive all the same,
I understand it spanned over the harbor entrance.

Are you sure?  What are your sources for that statement?  I ask because I
have recently visited the Temple of Artemis and Selcuk museum during a study
abroad program and recall no mention of the size of the image of Artemis
being extraordinary and the only ones mentioned were bronze and marble and
all of those extant are marble.  Wasn't it rather the colossal size of the
Artemisia (about 425 x 220 x 60 feet) and altar that were so exceptional and
that was the reason it was included as a wonder of the ancient world.  The
temple of Zeus at Olympia was not exceptionally large, but the statue of
Zeus at his temple at Olympia was made of ivory and gold and was reportedly
12 meters tall.  This url has a useful description:
http://oncampus.richmond.edu/academics/classics/students/Smucker/olym... .
Please, if you have time, can you provide sources for your conclusions
concerning the Artemisia at Ephesus?  Thanks.

The Channel 4 documentary The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World or whatever
it was called which showed CGI reconstructions. It was the upright standing
statue of Artemis which was massive so the temple had to be massive to fit
it in.

Oh?  Are you certain you are remembering this correctly?

I don't recall any mention by the authors of antiquity who wrote of these
monuments such as Herodotus, Pausanius, Strabo, Pliny, and others have to
say about this purported colossal statue of Artemis. And I think they would
have mentioned it, but I could be wrong.  And what do the archaeologists who
have excavated at the Artemisia have to say about it?  The reports I have
read do not mention a statue of exceptional size at the Artemisia, but then
I haven't read every report and book.  Have you read any of the
archaeological reports or books on the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus?

I think they are a bit more reliable than a British television documentary.
Don't you?

I find that especially so since the sanctuary at the Artemisia is not
significantly larger than those in the Temple of Apollo at Didyma or the
temples of Hera at both Samos and Olympia, or do you know the specific
dimensions of the sanctuaries at these other Ionian monuments? Please, do
correct me if I am mistaken.  The altar at the Artemisia is huge in
comparison, but I don't recall the sanctuary was any larger than the Heraion
at Samos and the Temple of Apollo at Didyma.  Don't you agree?

Watch the programme I mentioned, it might be available on 4oD. On top of the

It's the statue we are talking about. Other statues were seated. Artemis
stood up. Anyway, what we need is the original historical text to see what
it said, not some archaeological nonsense.

But the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus was built in the 6th century and the
temple of Zeus at Olympia was built in the 5th century.  And both are

You are mistaken.  If the program you saw mentioned &quot;80 or 90 breasts,&quot; it
too was mistaken, although I doubt that is what the program said.  There are
21 breasts on the Colossal Statue of Artemis in the Selcuk Museum, as well
as several other statues of Artemis.  I counted them myself on that Colossal
Statue, which is only about 6 feet tall by the way, and a couple others in
June this year when I visited there.

Why didn't you say so?  Oh, by the way, in what lines of his poem did
Antipater of Sidon mention that the statue of Artemis in the sanctuary of
the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus was &quot;the largest standing statue ever

And in what lines did Antipater of Sidon mention that the statue of Artemis
in the sanctuary of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus &quot;had about 80 or 90
breasts&quot;?

And then of course, there is the issue of how Antipater of Sidon could
possibly have known what the statue of Artemis in the sanctuary of the
Temple of Artemis at Ephesus looked like considering that this temple was
burned in 356 B.C. by Herostratos?  Or do you think Antipater of Sidon was
referring to a later temple?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I find that especially so since the sanctuary at the Artemisia is not

&gt;&gt; dimensions of the sanctuaries at these other Ionian monuments? Please, do
&gt;&gt; correct me if I am mistaken.  The altar at the Artemisia is huge in
&gt;&gt; comparison, but I don't recall the sanctuary was any larger than the

I agree, although actually it is the size of the statue relative to the size
of the sanctuary which is what we are talking about.  And your claim is that
the large sanctuary at the Artemisium is evidence of a colossal statue of
the deity in the sanctuary.  I pointed out that the sanctuaries of the
Temple of Hera at Samos and Temple of Apollo at Didyma are just as large or
very nearly so as the sanctuary of Artemis at Ephesus.  Yet, there is not a
word in the ancient sources about colossal statues of Hera and Apollo at
Samos and Didyma.  That undercuts your argument. So does your silence in
response to a reasonable question indicate that you have no concept at all
of the relationships between the Temple of Hera at Samos, the Temple of
Apollo at Didyma, and the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus?  I rather think that
is the case.  By the way, the altars of Greek temples were not located in
the temples, but were located so that the statue of the deity faced the
altar when the doors of the sanctuary were opened.  Pop trivia quiz here:
what is significantly different about layout of the monumental complex at
the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Other statues were seated. Artemis stood up.

Yes, indeed.  I do know what the statues of Artemis look like.  I know
Artemis is nearly always depicted standing.  I know none has &quot;80 or 90
breasts.&quot;  I have seen some that have been excavated from the Artemisium
itself as well as from the nearby sites.  Have you?

If not, photographs are readily available at dozens of web pages.  Why don't
you look one or several of these up?  And perhaps count the breasts.

In any case, the fact that the extant statues of Artemis depict her standing
is not evidence that there was ever a statue of Artemis in the Artemisium at
Ephesus on the scale of Olympian Zeus in the temple at Olympia.  You seem to
be flailing desperately in search of anything to buttress your argument.

Indeed!  Please do cite fully and quote from any ancient &quot;original

you can't, but I do wish you luck.

In any case, I listed historical texts from antiquity that do mention these
monuments.  You dismissed them with an irrelevant declaration that Herodotus
was too early.  OK, for the Colossus of Rhodes Herodotus was too early, and
I was pleasantly surprised you were aware of that.  Congratulations. But
doesn't Herodotus mention or describe all of the other &quot;wonders&quot; alluded to
by Antipater of Sidon?  And don't you think Pliny's and Strabo's works
qualify as &quot;original historical text[s]&quot;?  If not, what could your objection

Actually, the archaeological evidence and historical narrative and literary

Yes, I know you cannot find Antipater's poem.  When you read it you will
find no mention of a colossal statue of Artemis in her temple at Ephesus.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; On top of the statue being the largest standing statue ever built it had
&gt;&gt;&gt; about 80 or 90 breasts.

&gt;&gt; You are mistaken.  If the program you saw mentioned &quot;80 or 90 breasts,&quot;
&gt;&gt; it too was mistaken, although I doubt that is what the program said.
&gt;&gt; There are 21 breasts on the Colossal Statue of Artemis in the Selcuk
&gt;&gt; Museum, as well as several other statues of Artemis.  I counted them
&gt;&gt; myself on that Colossal Statue, which is only about 6 feet tall by the
&gt;&gt; way, and a couple others in June this year when I visited there.

&gt; If it is only 6 foot tall then how can you call it colossal. It is clearly
&gt; not the one from the temple.

I am merely repeating what the people who operate the Selcuk Museum call it.
You have no way of knowing whether or not the statue in this museum is
from the Artemisium.  Have you ever been there?

I know.  That you don't have the text and have either never read it or

don't you find a copy of &quot;Anthologia Palatina&quot; and read the portions
attributed to Antipater of Sidon?  Then post telling us what you found

You seem to have forgotten to respond to this.  Care to try now?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And then of course, there is the issue of how Antipater of Sidon could
&gt;&gt; possibly have known what the statue of Artemis in the sanctuary of the

&gt;&gt; burned in 356 B.C. by Herostratos?  Or do you think Antipater of Sidon
&gt;&gt; was referring to a later temple?

&gt; Or to the statue which survived the burning if both he and Herodotus are
&gt; referring to the same wonder since it can't be the replacement temple that
&gt; is the unchanged constant.

There was no giant statue ever placed in the archaic Artemisium mentioned by
Herodotus.  There was no giant statue in the Hellenistic Artemisium that was
rebuilt to nearly identical dimensions following the death of Alexander.
But this later temple is that described by Antipater of Sidon.  But
Antipater of Sidon never mentions a giant statue of Artemis.  Neither does
anyone else.  Except you.

Read the Argonautica. An alter could be erected anywhere. It was just a rock

Altars were outside of the temples. You yourself stated this you moron. The

the temples not inside of them.

&gt;&gt; to set up and [sic] altar.&quot;  All Greek temples were set where three
&gt;&gt; elements
&gt;&gt; were present or could be built.  Those three elements were a water source
&gt;&gt; for purification, a sacred way or road for the procession on feast days,
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; an altar where the ritual sacrifices were conducted.  Why didn't you take
&gt;&gt; the time to learn these things before posting nonsense?

I have read the &quot;Argonautica&quot; of Apollonius.  What is your point?  Temporary
altars were set up to offer sacrifices to the deities when no temple was
available.  That is not the issue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; and since the altar was outside the temple if the wonder was the altar
&gt;&gt;&gt; then it cant have been the temple.

&gt;&gt; You again are mistaken.  Don't you ever check anything before you post?

&gt; Altars were outside of the temples. You yourself stated this you moron.
&gt; The ancient Greek always conducted their religious ceremonies on the
&gt; steppes of the temples not inside of them.

Yes, but the altar was located so the statue of the deity faced the altar
which was always in relatively close proximity to the temple.  The altars
were almost never on the steps.  Why do you believe the rituals were
conducted on the steps of the temples?

&gt;&gt; alone among the monumental Ionian temples and most Hellenic temples, the

Your profound ignorance is on display yet again.  Obviously you haven't read
Hesiod's &quot;Theogony&quot; or you would be familiar with the earth goddess &quot;Ge&quot; or
&quot;Gaia.&quot;  Also Demeter was an earth goddess.  Hera was a mother goddess.
Ertha was a Germanic earth goddess according to Tacitus. And there are
dozens of other examples from other cultures. Don't you look anything up

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Other statues were seated. Artemis stood up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, indeed.  I do know what the statues of Artemis look like.  I know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Artemis is nearly always depicted standing.  I know none has &quot;80 or 90
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; breasts.&quot;  I have seen some that have been excavated from the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Artemisium
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself as well as from the nearby sites.  Have you?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes,

&gt;&gt; When were you there?

&gt;&gt;&gt; they all have plenty of breasts.

&gt;&gt; Why so vague?  How many breasts do the depictions of Ephesian Artemis
&gt;&gt; have? This is a very simple matter.  Find a photograph and count the
&gt;&gt; breasts.  Why are your answers so slippery?

&gt; The exact number of breasts is irrelevant. What matters is that it was a
&gt; large number.

Says who?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If not, photographs are readily available at dozens of web pages.  Why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't you look one or several of these up?  And perhaps count the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; breasts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In any case, the fact that the extant statues of Artemis depict her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; standing is not evidence that there was ever a statue of Artemis in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Artemisium at Ephesus on the scale of Olympian Zeus in the temple at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Olympia.  You seem to

&gt;&gt;&gt; If the Olympian Zeus was depicted standing up it would have not even
&gt;&gt;&gt; fitted into the temple of Artemis.

&gt;&gt; What does that have to do with anything?  There are descriptions of
&gt;&gt; Olympian Zeus carved by the Athenian sculptors Phidias and his colleagues
&gt;&gt; Colotes and Panaenus beginning in 437 BC.  There is no real doubt what
&gt;&gt; this statue looked like.  There is no mention anywhere by anyone of any
&gt;&gt; statue of Artemis on the same scale, except by you.  Prove me wrong. All

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Seven wonders of the world are Great Pyramids, Lighthouse,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hanging

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Pharos Lighthouse. There were others but Pharaohs was the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tallest building.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gardens, Temple of Zeus, Mausoleum of Mausolus, The Temple of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Artemis,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it was the Stature of Zeus in the temple of Zeus and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stature
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Artemis in the temple of Artemis. Both were the biggest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; statues
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of male and female Gods set in temples.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you sure?  What are your sources for that statement?  I ask
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because I have recently visited the Temple of Artemis and Selcuk
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; museum during a study abroad program and recall no mention of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; size of the image of Artemis being extraordinary and the only ones
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioned were bronze and marble and all of those extant are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marble.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wasn't it rather the colossal size of the Artemisia (about 425 x
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 220
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; x 60 feet) and altar that were so exceptional and that was the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reason
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it was included as a wonder of the ancient world.  The temple of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Zeus
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at Olympia was not exceptionally large, but the statue of Zeus at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; temple at Olympia was made of ivory and gold and was reportedly 12
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meters tall.  This url has a useful description:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://oncampus.richmond.edu/academics/classics/students/Smucker/olym... .
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please, if you have time, can you provide sources for your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conclusions concerning the Artemisia at Ephesus?  Thanks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Channel 4 documentary The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whatever it was called which showed CGI reconstructions. It was the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upright standing statue of Artemis which was massive so the temple
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be massive to fit it in.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh?  Are you certain you are remembering this correctly?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't recall any mention by the authors of antiquity who wrote of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these monuments such as Herodotus, Pausanius, Strabo, Pliny, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have to say about this purported colossal statue of Artemis. And I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think they would

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Herodotus? The Pharos Lighthouse wasn't even built until Hellenistic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times 100 years after Herodotus.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus was built in the 6th century and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; temple of Zeus at Olympia was built in the 5th century.  And both are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioned by Herodotus in books II and VII of his &quot;Historia.&quot;  And
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yes, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; am

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But that temple of Artemis is mentioned by Antipater of Sidon since it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; burdend down in the same year that Alexander the Great was born. So
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is the wonder, a burned down temple or the statue of Artemis which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presumably survived.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The temple burned about 356 BC was rebuilt.  No giant statue of Artemis
&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioned in the literature of antiquity.  Not even in the 2nd century
&gt;&gt;&gt; BC
&gt;&gt;&gt; poem by Antipater of Sidon.  Thus your presumption is false absent
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt; to support your position.  To this point you have produced no evidence.

&gt;&gt; If is not my presumption. It is the presumption of Channel 4.

&gt; Yet you have consistently supported Channel 4's position.  And you still
&gt; have produced no evidence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aware of the dates of Herodotus.  Of course, Herodotus also mentions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; three wonders of the world on Samos in Book III, doesn't he?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have mentioned it, but I could be wrong.  And what do the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; archaeologists who have excavated at the Artemisia have to say about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it?  The reports I have read do not mention a statue of exceptional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; size at the Artemisia, but then I haven't read every report and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; book.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have you read any of the archaeological reports or books on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Temple
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Artemis at Ephesus?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Watch the programme I mentioned, it might be available on 4oD.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does your silence mean that you have not read any of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; archaeological
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reports or books on the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus?  I suspect that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be the case because of your many mistakes of fact in this thread.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They are COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. What requires reading is the poem by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Antipater of Sidon who invented the seven wonders, which I cannot find.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, the archaeological evidence and historical narrative and
&gt;&gt;&gt; literary
&gt;&gt;&gt; mentions tend to support each other.  Had a giant statue of Artemis
&gt;&gt;&gt; survived
&gt;&gt;&gt; and been excavated, your point would be proven.  Why don't you
&gt;&gt;&gt; understand
&gt;&gt;&gt; the utility of archaeology to history and history to archaeology?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I know you cannot find Antipater's poem.  When you read it you will
&gt;&gt;&gt; find no mention of a colossal statue of Artemis in her temple at
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ephesus.

&gt;&gt; You need to recheck the poem. You might have missed something.

&gt; Of course I might have missed something.  That is why I rechecked the poem
&gt; before I posted that.

&gt;&gt; Channel 4 clearly presumed there was a giant standing statue inside the
&gt;&gt; temple and showed it in their GCI animation of it.

&gt; Channel 4 was mistaken in that case.  Or you misremember what you heard.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You do not need a temple to set up and altar

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, in the Greek religion of antiquity one indeed did &quot;need a
&gt;&gt;&gt; temple

&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; an altar where the ritual sacrifices were conducted.  Why didn't you
&gt;&gt;&gt; take
&gt;&gt;&gt; the time to learn these things before posting nonsense?

&gt;&gt; Read the Argonautica. An alter could be erected anywhere. It was just a
&gt;&gt; rock for cooking animals over.

&gt; Temporary altars were set up to offer sacrifices to the deities when no
&gt; temple was available.  That is not the issue.

BULLSHIT. Were peoples homes temples, yet there was an alter in every home
in the open megaron. An alter was what you cooked animals on and nothing
more. They were not the tables that you see in modern day churches that the
priests rest the sacraments on.

FOOL! Nobody was allowed into ancient Greek temples except the priests and
the kings/archons and then only on special occasions. All religious rituals
were conducted out doors with the priests standing on the steps of the
temple to address the crowd outside. Learn some history.

Yes I have read Theogony and there is not one reference to any mother

goddess. Hera was the wife of Zeus and the goddess of marriage so it is
clear that you know nothing about ancient theology and are talking total and
