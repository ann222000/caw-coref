_Dangers of a Cornered George Bush _
( http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=2007072794211932 )
By Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity &amp; Dr. Justin  Frank
July 27, 2007
Editor's Note: As the nation and the world face 18 more months of  George W.
Bush's presidency, a chilling prospect is that Bush -- confronted with  more
defeats and reversals -- might just ''lose it'' and undertake even  more
reckless military adventures.
In this special memorandum, the Veteran Intelligence Professionals  for
Sanity (VIPS) collaborated with psychiatrist Justin Frank, author of  Bush on the
Couch, to assess the potential dangers and possible  countermeasures available
to constrain Bush:
Recent events have put a great deal more pressure on  President George W.
Bush, who has shown little regard for the constitutional  system bequeathed to us
by the Founders. Having bragged about being commander in  chief of the
''first war of the 21st century,'' one he began under false  pretenses, success in
Iraq is now a pipedream.
The ''new'' strategy of surging troops in Baghdad has simply wasted more
lives and bought some time for the president. His strategy boils down to keeping
as many of our soldiers engaged as possible, in order to stave off definitive
defeat in Iraq before January 2009.
Bush is commander in chief, but Congress must approve funding for the war,
and its patience is running out. The war -- and the polls -- are going so badly
that it is no longer a sure thing that the administration will be able to
fund  continuance of the war.
There is an outside chance Congress will succeed in forcing a pullout  sta
rting in the next several months. What would the president likely do in  reaction
to that slap in the face?
What would he do if the Resistance succeeded in mounting a large attack on
U.S. facilities in the Green Zone or elsewhere in Iraq? How would he react if
Israel mounted a preemptive attack on the nuclear-related facilities in Iran
and  wider war ensued?
Applied Psychoanalysis
The answers to such questions depend on a host of factors for which
intelligence analysts use a variety of tools. One such tool involves applying  the
principles of psychoanalysis to acquire insights into the minds of key  leaders,
with an eye to facilitating predictions as to how they might react in  certain
circumstances.
For U.S. intelligence, this common-law marriage of psychoanalysis and
intelligence work dates back to the early 1940s, when CIA's forerunner, the  Office
of Strategic Services commissioned two studies of Adolf Hitler.
We call such assessments ''at-a-distance leader personality assessments.''
Many were quite useful. VIPS found the 2004 book Bush on the Couch, by
Washington psychiatrist Justin Frank, MD, a very helpful assessment in this  genre.
We now have two more years of experience of observing Bush closely.
As we watched the pressure build on President Bush, looked toward the
additional challenges we expect him to face over the next 18 months, and  pondered
his tendency to disregard the law and the Constitution, we felt very  much in
need of professional help in trying to estimate what kinds of decisions  he is
likely to make.
Dr. Frank, it turned out, had been thinking along the same lines, when we
asked to meet with him just three weeks ago. What follows is a collaborative
Frank-VIPS effort, with the psychological insights volunteered by Dr. Frank, who
shares the imperative we feel to draw on all disciplines to assess what
courses  of action President George W. Bush is likely to decide upon in reacting
to  reverse after reverse in the coming months.
Parental discretion advised. The outlook is not only somber but potentially
violent--and includes all manner of threats born of George W. Bush's mental
state (as well as the unusual relationship he has with his vice president).
Things are going to hell in a hand basket for this administration, and
Bush/Cheney have shown a willingness to act in extra-Constitutional ways, as  they
see fit.
While Bush and his advisers make a fetish of it, he is nonetheless commander
in chief of the armed forces and the question becomes how he might feel
justified in using them and is there still any restraining force--any checks on
the increasing power of the executive in our three-branch government.
We have a president whose psychological makeup inclines him to do as he
pleases. Because Congress has been cowed, and the judiciary stacked with
loyalists, he has gotten away with it--so far.
But the polls show growing discontent among the people, especially over the
war in Iraq. Congress, too, is starting to challenge the executive, as it
should--but slowly, slower than it should. The way things are moving, there is
infinite opportunity to diddle and dodge--in effect conducting business pretty
much as usual over the next 18 months.
Could Start Another War...
Meanwhile, the president may well feel free to start another war, with little
reference to the Congress or the UN, against Iran.
The commander of CENTO forces, Admiral William Fallon is quoted as having
said we ''will not go to war with Iran on my watch.'' Tough words; but should
the president order an attack on Iran, chances are Fallon and others will do
what they are accustomed to doing, salute smartly and carry out orders, UNLESS
they show more regard for the U.S. Constitution than the president does.
There is an orderly remedy written into the Constitution aimed at preventing
a president from usurping the power of the people and acting like a king; the
process, of course, is impeachment.
The usual focus on impeachment is on abuses of the past, and a compelling
case can surely be made. We believe an equally compelling incentive can be seen
in looking toward the next 18 months.
In this paper, we are primarily concerned about what future misadventures are
likely if this administration is not somehow held to account; that is, if
Bush  and Cheney are not removed from office.
Unless Checked
If the constitutional process of impeachment is under way when President Bush
orders our military to begin a war against Iran, there is a good chance
that,  rather than salute like automatons and start World War III, our senior
military  would find a way to prevent more carnage until such time as the
representatives  of the people in the House have spoken.
This administration's capacity for mischief would not end until conviction in
the Senate. But initiating the impeachment process appears to be the only
way to  launch a shot across the bow of this particular ship of state. For it is
captained by a president with a psychological makeup likely to lead to new
misadventures likely to end in a ship wreck unless the Constitution is brought
alongside and a new pilot boarded.
We are grateful that Dr. Frank agreed to collaborate with us and to issue
under VIPS auspices the psychological assessment that follows.
Discussion of the three scenarios after his profiling of President Bush was
very much a collaborative exercise aimed at applying Frank's insights to
contingencies our president may have to address before he leaves office. Our
conclusions are, of necessity, speculative--and, sorry, scary.
The Assessment of Dr. Frank:

If a patient came into  my consulting room missing an arm, the first question
I would ask is, ''What  happened to your arm?'' The same would be true for a
patient who has no guilt,  no conscience. I would want to know what happened
to it.
No Conscience
George W. Bush is without conscience, and it would require a lengthy series
of clinical sessions to find out what happened to it. By identifying himself
as  all good and on the side of right, he has been able to vanquish any guilt,
any  sense of doing wrong.
In Bush on the Couch I gave examples illustrating that remarkable  lack of
conscience. From his youthful days blowing up frogs with firecrackers to  his
unapologetic public endorsement of torture, there has been no change.
Observers are gradually becoming aware of this fundamental deficit. For
example, after watching the president's press conference on July 12, Wall  Street
Journal columnist Peggy Noonan wrote, ''He doesn't seem to be  suffering,
which is jarring. Presidents in great enterprises that are going  badly suffer:
Lincoln, LBJ with his head in his hands. Why doesn't Mr.  Bush?''
No Shame
George W. Bush seems also to be without shame. He expresses no regret or
embarrassment about his failure to help Katrina victims, or to tell the truth.
He says whatever he thinks people want to hear, whether it be ''stay the
course'' or ''I've never been about 'stay the course.''' He does whatever he
wants.
He lies--not just to us, but to himself as well. What makes lying so easy for
Bush is his contempt--for language, for law, and for anybody who dares
question  him.
That he could say so baldly that he'd never been about ''stay the course'' is
bone chilling. So his words mean nothing. That is very important for people
to  understand.
Fear of Humiliation
Despite having no shame, Bush has a profound fear of failure and humiliation.
He defends himself from this by any means at his disposal--most frequently
with  indifference or contempt.
He will flinch only if directly confronted about being a failure or a liar.
Otherwise world events are enough removed from him that he can spin them into
his intact defense system.
This deep fear helps to explain his relentlessly escalating attacks on
others, his bullying, and his use of nicknames to put people down. There is fear
of being found out not to be as big in every way as his father.
What a burden to have to face his many inadequacies--now held up to the light
of day--whether it is his difficulty in speaking, thinking, reading,
managing  anxiety, or making good decisions. He will not change, because for him
change  means humiliating collapse. He is very fearful of public exposure of his
many  inadequacies.
Contempt for Truth?
Contempt itself is a defense, a form of self-protection, which helps Bush
appear at ease and relaxed--at least to big fans like New York Times  columnist
David Brooks.
The president's contempt defense protects his belief system, a system he
clings to as if his beliefs were well-researched facts. His pathology is a
patchwork of false beliefs and incomplete information woven into what he asserts
is the whole truth.
What gets lost in this process is growth--the George W. Bush of 2007 is
exactly the same as the one of 2001. Helen Thomas has said that of all the
presidents she has covered over the years, Bush is the least changed by his job,  by
his experience. This is why there is no possibility of dialogue or  reasoning
with him.
Sadistic
His certitude that he is right gives him carte blanche for  destructive
behavior. He has always had a sadistic streak: from blowing up  frogs, to shooting
his siblings with a b-b-gun, to branding fraternity pledges  with white-hot
coat hangers.
His comfort with cruelty is one reason he can be so jocular with reporters
when talking about American casualties in Iraq. Instead of seeing a president
in  anguish, we watch him publicly joking about the absence of ''weapons of
mass  destruction'' in Iraq, in the vain search for which so many young Americans
died.
Break It!
Bush likes to break things, needs to break things. And this is most
shockingly seen in how he is systematically destroying our armed forces.
In the early days of the Iraq invasion he refused to approve the large number
of troop the generals said were needed in order to try to invade and pacify
Iraq  and acquiesced in the firing of any general who disagreed.
He turned a blind eye to giving the troops proper equipment and cut funding
for needed health care. Health care and other social programs have one thing
in  common: they are paid for by public funds.
It may well be that, unconsciously, the government represents his neglectful
parents, and those helped by the government represent the siblings he
resents.  If George W. Bush wanted to destroy his own family, he could scarcely have
done  better. Thanks to him, no Bush is likely to be elected to high office
for  generations to come.
Where Does This Leave Us?
It leaves us with a regressed president who needs to protect himself more
than ever from diminishment, humiliation, and collapse. He is so busy trying to
manage his own anxiety that he has little capacity left to attend to national
and world problems.
And so, we are left with a president who cannot actually govern, because he
is incapable of reasoned thought in coping with events outside his control,
like  those in the Middle East.
This makes it a monumental challenge--as urgent as it is difficult--not only
to get him to stop the carnage in the Middle East, but also to prevent him
from  undertaking a new, perhaps even more disastrous adventure--like going to
war  with Iran, in order to embellish the image he so proudly created for
himself  after 9/11 as the commander in chief of ''the first war of the 21st
century.''
Iran would make number three--all the compelling reasons against it
notwithstanding
***
Contingencies:
We will now attempt to put flesh on the discussion by positing and examining
scenarios that would force Bush to react, and applying the observations above
and other data to forecast what form that reaction might take.

Outlined  below are three illustrative contingencies, each of which would
pose a neuralgic  threat to George W. Bush's shaky self-esteem, his
over-determined efforts to  stave off humiliation, and his unending need for
self-protection.
These are not seat-of-the-pants scenarios. Each of them is
possible--arguably, even probable. The importance of coming up with educated  guesses regarding
Bush's response BEFORE they occur is, we hope, clear.
Scenario A: Destructive Attack on the Green Zone
The U.S. military is out in front of Defense Secretary Robert Gates and other
policymakers in Washington in seeing the hand of Iran's government behind
''the  enemy'' in Iraq.
On July 26, the operational commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, Lt. Gen.
Raymond Odierno, blamed the recent ''significant improvement'' in the accuracy  of
mortar and rocket attacks on the Green Zone on ''training conducted inside
Iran.'' Odierno also repeated that roadside bombs are being smuggled into Iraq
from Iran.
Last week, Gen. David Petraeus warned that insurgents intend to ''pull off a
variety of sensational attacks and grab the headlines to create a 'mini-Tet.'
''  (Tet refers to the surprise country-wide offensive mounted by the
Vietnamese  Communists in early 1968, which indicated to most Americans that the war
was  lost.)
Attacks on the Green Zone have doubled in recent months. Despite this, the
senior military appear to be in denial with respect to the vulnerability of the
Green Zone--oblivious even to the reality that mortar rounds and rocket fire
have little respect for walled enclaves.
Anyone with a mortar and access to maps and images on Google can calibrate
fire to devastating effect--with or without training in Iran. It is just a
matter of time before mortar round or rocket takes out part of the spanking new
$600-million U.S. embassy together with people working there or nearby.
And/or, the insurgents could conceivably mount a multi-point assault on the
zone and gain control of a couple of buildings and take hostages--perhaps
including senior diplomats and military officers.
Given what we think we know of George Bush, if there were an embarrassing
attack on U.S. installations in the Green Zone or some other major U.S.
facility, he would immediately order a retaliatory series of air strikes, and  let
the bombs and missiles fall where they may.
The reaction would come from deep within and would warn, in effect: This is
what you get if you try to make me look bad.
Scenario B: Israeli Attack on Nuclear Targets in Iran.
This would be madness and would elicit counterattacks from an Iran with many
viable options for significant retaliation. Nevertheless, Sen. Joe Lieberman
(D,  Conn) and his namesake Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's minister of strategic
affairs, are openly calling for such strikes, which would have to be on much
more massive a scale than Israel's bombing of Iraq's nuclear reactor at
Osirak  in 1981.
For that attack in 1981, Cheney, a great fan of preemptive strikes,
congratulated the Israelis, even though the U.S. joined other UN Security  Council
members in unanimously condemning the Israeli attack.
Five years ago, on Aug. 26, 2002, Cheney became the first U.S. official
publicly to refer approvingly to the bombing of Osirak. And in an interview two
and a half years ago, on Inauguration Day 2005, Cheney referred nonchalantly to
the possibility that ''the Israelis might well decide to act first [to
eliminate  Iran's nuclear capabilities] and let the rest of the world worry about
cleaning  up the diplomatic mess afterwards.''
One thing Cheney says is indisputably--if myopically--true: Bush has been
Israel's best friend. In his speeches, he has fostered the false impression that
the U.S. is treaty-bound to defend Israel, should it come under attack--as
would  be likely, were Israel to attack Iran.
With the U.S. Congress firmly in the Israeli camp, Cheney might see little
disincentive to giving a green-light wink to Israel and then let the president
''worry about cleaning up.''
Reporting from Seymour Hersh's administration sources serve to strengthen the
impression shining through Bush's speeches that he is eager to strike Iran.
But  how to justify it?
Curiously, a National Intelligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear capability, a
study scheduled for completion early this year, has been sent back several
times--probably because its predictions are not as alarmist as the warnings that
Cheney and the Israelis are whispering into the president's ear.
Senior U.S. military officers have warned against the folly of attacking
Iran, but Cheney has shown himself, time and time again, able to overrule the
military.
But What if Impeachment Begins?
Is there nothing to rein in Bush and Cheney? It seems likely that only if
impeachment proceedings were under way would senior officers like CENTCOM
commander, Admiral William Fallon, be likely to parry an unlawful order to start
yet another war without the approval of Congress and the UN.
With impeachment under way, such senior officers might be reminded that  all
officers and national security officials swear an oath to protect  and defend
the Constitution of the United States--NOT to protect and defend the
president.
It was a highly revealing moment when on July 11, former White House
political director Sara Taylor solemnly reminded the Senate Judiciary Committee,
that as a commissioned officer, ''I took an oath and I take that oath to the
president very seriously.''
Committee chair Patrick Leahy had to remind Taylor: ''We understand  your
personal loyalty to President Bush. I appreciate you correcting that your  oath
was not to the president, but to the Constitution.''
The most senior officers, military included, can get their loyalties mixed
up. And this is of transcendent importance in a context described by Seymour
Hersh: ''These guys are scary as hell...you can't use the word 'delusional,'
for  it's actually a medical term. Wacky. That's a fair word.''
One does not need psychoanalytic training to see that Bush and Cheney do not
care about facts, treaties (or the lack thereof), or other legal niceties,
unless it suits their purpose. This gives an even more ominous ring to what
Hersh is hearing from his sources.
If Israel attacks Iran, President Bush is likely to spring to  Israel's
defense, regardless of whether he was inside or outside the loop before  the
attack; and the world will see a dangerously widened war in the Middle  East.
Psychologically, Bush would almost certainly need to join the attack,  mainly
to sustain his illusion of safety and masculinity. And Cheney,  knowing that,
would be pushing him hard on U.S. energy and other perceived  strategic
interests.
Scenario C: Congress Cuts War Funding This Fall
We posit that Congress finally grows weary of the increasingly obvious
bait-and-switch, the ''we-need-more-time'' tactic, and cuts off all funding  except
for that needed to bring the troops home.
The talk now is about getting a ''meaningful'' progress report in November,
because September is said to be too soon. The Iraqi parliament is behaving
much  like its American counterpart by taking August off. But our soldiers do not
get  a month-long hiatus from constant danger.
It is clear even to the press that the surge has simply brought more American
deaths and an upsurge of insurgent attacks. What is less clear is why Bush
remains so positive. It is probably not just an act, but an idée fixe  he
needs to hold onto tightly.
Since doubt is dangerous, we see a compensatory smile fixe on the  face of
the president and other senior officials, dismissing any trace of  uncertainty
or doubt.
If Congress cut off funding for war in Iraq, Bush might well cast  about for
a casus belli to ''justify'' an attack on Iran.
Would the senior military again go along with orders for an unprovoked,
unconstitutional war on a country posing no threat to the U.S.? Hard to say.
In this context, an ongoing impeachment process could provide welcome
evidence that influential members of Congress, like many senior military  officers,
see through Bush's need to strike out elsewhere. Military commanders  might
think twice before saluting smartly and executing an illegal order.
In such circumstances, Dick ''it-won't stop-us'' Cheney, could be expected to
try to pull out all the stops. But if he, too, were in danger of being  im
peached, uniformed military officers could conceivably block administration
plans.
There is only a remote chance that Defense Secretary Gates would be a
tempering voice in all this. Far more likely, he would smell in any restrictive
legislation traces of the Boland amendment, which he assisted in circumventing
during the Iran-Contra misadventure.
Petraeus ex Machina
With ''David'' or ''General Petraeus'' punctuating the president's every
other sentence at recent press conferences, the script for September seems
clear. This is one four-star general with exquisite PR and political
acumen--pedigree and discipline the president can count on.
And with his nine rows of ribbons, he calls to mind the U.S. commander in
Saigon, Gen. William Westmoreland at a similar juncture in Vietnam (after the
Tet offensive when popular support dropped off rapidly).
It is virtually certain that Petraeus will press hard for more time and more
troops. Potemkin-style improvements will be used by Bush to justify
continuing  the ''new'' surge strategy, with the calculation that enough Democrats
might be  overcome by the fear of being charged with ''losing Iraq.''
In the past Bush seems to have bought Cheney's ''analysis'' that increased
enemy attacks were signs of desperation. Hard as it is to believe that Bush has
not learned from that repeated experience, it is at the same town possible
to  ''misunderestimate'' one's capacity for wooden-headedness, particularly
with  respect to someone with the psychological makeup of our president.
He is extraordinarily adept at finding only rose-colored glasses to help him
see.
With Cheney egging him on from the wings of the ''unitary executive,'' but
Congress no longer bowing to that novel interpretation of the Constitution,
Bush  will be sorely tempted to lash out in some violent way, if further funding
for  the war is denied.
To do that effectively, he will need senior generals and admirals as
co-conspirators. It will be up to them to choose between career and  Constitution.
All too often, in such circumstances, the tendency has been to  choose career.
Impeachment hearings, though, could encourage senior officers like Admiral
Fallon to pause long enough to remember that their oath is to defend the
Constitution, and that they are not required to follow orders to start another  war
in order to stave off political and personal disaster for the president and
vice president.
