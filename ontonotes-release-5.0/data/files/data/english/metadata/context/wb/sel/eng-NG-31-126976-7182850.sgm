Some kids were playing in the trackbed of a busy railroad, and I
reported it to the cops.

I mentioned this to some neighbors who said I was meddling in
something that was none of my business and that the report would cause
unnecessary headaches for the kids and their parents.

I figured it was better for the parents to get a complaint phone call
than a bad news phone call.  I figured it was better for the kids to
face the cops rather than face their best friends' dead bodies
chopped up by a passing train.

Any thoughts?

Of course you did right thing. And if it causes the kids or parents any
headaches that was necessary. But next time don't tell your neighbors
you did it.

Did you know the children and parents?

Did you complain to the children?

Of course, the Americans and Britishers are mad, so the second may
have been dangerous although natural.

I guess it depends what you mean by "playing in the trackbed". If they
were doing something that made you genuinely scared for their safety,
then I think you were right to act (although maybe you should have
started by talking to the kids or their parents rather than the cops).

But realistically, how many of us here have _never_ trespassed on
railroad property, especially when we were kids?

Growing up in very flat South Bend, the 15-foot railroad embankment
behind my house was the closest thing to a hill within easy walking
distance. So, that's where we went sledding in the winter. We knew
enough to clear the tracks when we heard or saw a train coming, and no
one ever came close to being hurt by a train (although some were
occasionally hurt by trying to sled down a thin path on a steep,
overgrown embankment with an alley at the bottom). I would have been
pretty PO'd if the cops had busted us, and I think my parents (who
knew what we were doing) would have been distressed as well.

Exactly.  If the kids are dumb enough to be playing on RR tracks, odds are
they (or their parents) are dumb enough to retaliate against the snitch.

You did the right thing.  Protecting kids from themselves is necessary; once
they turn 18, though, let Darwin take over.

The big problem with letting Darwin have them is the effect on
the train crew.

You done good.

The alternative is to let the stupid kids get hit by a train before they
are old enough to breed.

Oh, and if your neighbor's house is on fire, don't bother to call the
fire department. It might inconvenience them.

Shesh!

They weren't merely walking along the tracks (which happens all the
time); they were actually playing in the trackbed.  On a very busy
railroad, trains unpredictably running in both directions on both
tracks.  In front of a curve.  (The bi-directional running scarse me
because trespassing think they are watching the track in front of
them, not realizing a train could sneak up behind them.  Or, people
think just because a train passed there won't be another along for a
while.  Not true here.)

Yes, I felt it was dangerous in that location because of the above.
Also, sometimes when people are faced with an oncoming train they
freeze up rather than move.  Or, their foot gets stuck under a rail or
they trip while running.

We have had nasty accidents on other lines.  Of course, the parents
blame the lack of fencing, even though it's the kids who cut through
it.

As to talking to the kids directly instead of the cops, the kids were
too far away (I was at ths station).  I called the cops, and the cop
himself went down the tracks to get the kids.  So, there wasn't any
issue of me needing to identify the kids, the cop found them in the
trackbed himself.  It turned out the kids were rather young.

For the future, I will defnitely not the my neighbors afterward.

I knew a kid in high school killed while doing that.  I was also on (a
psgr) a train that hit a trespassing kid.

I asked a neighbor if the schools around here give safety training.
We had it.  I was told no, they don't.

Thanks to all for their responses.

I have crossed many a railroad at an intersecting path without checking
first to see if it's listed as a public or private crossing with my state
public utility commission. I have walked alongside railroad tracks.

No, I've never played on a railroad comparable to the situation described in
the root message in this thread, so I sure don't see how your question is
relevant. Of course he should have reported the situation, which sounded
like an extreme lack of common sense. One would think that their parents
would be greatful someone gave a shit.

Playing what? Meaning no offense, since I don't know you at all, I
have no way of knowing if your judgment is reasonable without a little
more description than that.

Understand that I'm not condoning trespassing, but to give you one
example: kids playing catch on a straight, flat set of railroad
tracks, with no embankment, cut, turnouts, etc., and with plenty of
easy clearance on both sides, is (IMHO) probably not the most
dangerous things those kids will do this week. I personally wouldn't
call the cops about that, unless it was obvious to me that they were
ignoring the possibility of trains.

Playing "drop bottles off a long, high open-deck bridge and watch them
break" is obviously totally unsafe and should be stopped immediately.

Somewhere between these two is the line where the danger is large and
immediate enough to warrant such action.

You asked where the kids and I responded that they were playing in the
track bed, not merely walking alongside of it.  You also asked if I
felt it was dangerous and I said yes.

I never trespassed along tracks.  Where I grew up they were fenced in
and very busy.  My parents drummed it into me that I was forbidden to
go even near RR tracks, I always had to stay a respectful distance
away from them.  In a station, I was not allowed to run around, but
was kept close or inside the waiting room at all times.

I trust that answers all of your questions.

I have no idea "what" they were playing.  Nor do I care.  They were in
the trackbed and remaining in the trackbed.  That is dangerous and
illegal.  That is how kids (and adults) get killed.

As described previously, the track layout was NOT anything as you
describe.

Given the other responses, I am now sure I did the right thing by
calling the cops.  As several noted, it's better the kids talked to
the cops in one piece rather than watching their best friend carried
out in a body bag.  Likewise for their parents.

Someone told me that if a freight had to make an emergency stop, it
could derail, dumping freight cars onto my community.  That's a mess I
don't need.
