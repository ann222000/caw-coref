Excerpt from &quot;Tournament Poker for Advanced Players&quot; by David
Sklansky, Part Three:

The &quot;System&quot;

To show how effective moving in before the flop against good players
is, I relate the following true story. A well known casino owner
wanted to give his 21 year old daughter the thrill of playing in the
final world championship event at the World Series of Poker at
Binion's Horseshoe in Las Vegas. He was perfectly ready to put up
the $10,000 for her to play in that no-limit event. There was only
one problem. She had never played poker in her life.

There was a week to go before the tournament, and he approached me
to give her lessons. I appreciated his confidence, but taking
someone who has never played poker before and turning them into a
champion no-limit player in a week, is an impossible task.
However, I did have an idea. I had been mulling over the concept of
doing a lot of moving in before the flop. A few years earlier a very
mediocre poker player had won the World Championship making great
use of this play. Upon reflection I realized that he had hit upon a
strategy which gave him almost as good a chance as the best players.
In fact, if those players did not properly adjust to it, he might
even have an edge over them. This is especially true because the
best players hate to go all-in before the flop, even if they suspect
they have a small edge by doing so. They would much rather spar than
slug it out. That is, they want to wait for a situation they are
almost sure about, rather than speculating that they have the best
of it.

Getting back to the casino owner's daughter, I came up with a plan
(which the casino owner dubbed &quot;The System&quot;) that would take
advantage of the above syndrome, and actually give her a chance.
Amazingly, this system did not even require that she know how to
play poker, or even what beat what. All it required her to do was to
move in or fold. (There was a slight problem when she had the big
blind. I found a way to deal with that, but we will ignore it to
simplify this story.)
The instructions that I gave her, to the best of my recollection,
were the following:

1. If someone else has raised in front of you, move in all of
your chips with aces, kings, or ace-king suited. Otherwise fold.

2. If no one else has raised in front of you, move in all your
chips with any pair, any ace-other suited, ace-king (suited or
offsuit), or two suited connected cards, except for four-trey or
trey-deuce.

That was basically the whole system. The only other thing besides a
separate instruction for the big blind, was that this system was not
to be used the first few rounds of the tournament.

The reason The System wasn't to be used at first was that there was
too little money in the pot. The $10,000 No-Limit Hold 'em World
Championship at the World Series of Poker starts off with blinds of
$25 and $50. If she were to move in $10,000, she would be destined
to run into a pair of aces well before she had stolen enough antes.
Thus, even if all her opponents would throw anything but aces away,
The System would be obviously, wrong to use when the blinds were
that small. So, for the first two or three levels her instructions
were different. They were to throw everything away except aces, and
to move in with those aces.

Obviously The System (of selective moving in before the flop) could
have been fine tuned further. For instance, I could have adjusted
for her position, or whether somebody had already limped in front of
her. But I was dealing with someone who had never played poker and
didn't want to make things more complicated. In spite of this, we
actually felt like The System, as it stood, still gave her a chance.

Notice that the hands that she was to move in with (again, i no one
raised in front of her) comprised about 13 percent of all the two
card combinations. (If you don't know how I got that, reading this
book right now. You are not ready for it. You t know enough about
poker. And, you deserve to lose.) That is that if she got away with
her raises, even if she only stole the ante, her stack would
gradually go up, since she was raising 1 enough to recapture her
blinds plus a little more. And of course, there was no reason why
she could not get called and still In general, if she did get
called, she would probably be an underdog, but rarely a big underdog.

I was also counting on the fact that other players were worried
about going broke and also worried about players yet to act behind
them. I had little doubt that, if she raised in an early Lion,
players on her immediate left would fold hands as good Jh Jc or
maybe even Qs Qd or Ac Kc; and, this in fact did happen.

The big problem of course, is that she would eventually run into
aces. There were only two ways to withstand that. One, Was to beat
those aces most of the hands she would be raising with were about 20
percent against them. The other possibility would be that the player
with aces had less money than she did, so she would still have chips
to build back up. Because her ante stealing and possible pot Winning
would mean that her stack was increasing, it was quite reasonable
that she would still be alive when she finally did lose to two aces.

Thus, The System, even though it is quite simplistic, actually
seemed like it would give her a chance. The math seemed to work out,
and there wasn't much that expert players could do to counter it.
(As an aside, notice that if I was right, you could argue that it is
a knock on no-limit tournaments that such a simple system could
negate all the weapons of the best players.)

So how did she end up? Before I tell you, I must tell you about the
tournament that occurred the day before the big one. That was also a
no-limit event. It had a much smaller buy-in, perhaps $2,000.
Because it was a one day event, the blinds started off
proportionately much higher. An ante was also added after the first
couple of levels. The casino owner, skeptical of my system, decided
to test it himself in this smaller tournament. To make a long story
short, The System brought his chips from $2,000 to $35,000! He made
the final table, and came in about fifth place. But even that does
not properly describe the result, because for some reason, with
$35,000 in chips, he decided, for the first time in the tournament,
to deviate from The System. Specifically, what he did was call a
raise in front of him with Ad Kh

The flop came Ah Kd Th

and the raiser had two tens. Furthermore, the raiser was the only
player who had more chips than he did. Thus there is every reason to
believe that had he followed The System, he would have come in at
least the top three. The daughter was not so lucky. After anteing
off about $2,000 in the first few levels, The System kicked in and
she began increasing her chips. Players were throwing jacks and
queens away in the face of her all-in raise, just as expected. She
was called one time by ace-king, and won with her pair. But alas,
right near the end of the first day, she ran into a big stack with
the dreaded aces. I always wonder what would have happened had she
won that hand.

Except for confiding in a few friends, I have never told or written
about this system before. Jam extremely curious as to how strong it
really might be. And if it is strong, how much stronger yet a more
complex, move all-in, system would be? Most good players would feel
very silly playing such a system, so anyone who tested it would more
likely be a gambler who does not have his ego involved. Now that I
have divulged it, I expect a few of you might give it a try.

One thing is for sure, if you do get into a big tournament and use
it, it won't matter much that others know your strategy. There is no
good counter strategy which avoids significant risk. In fact, if you
use it at a table with some famous world champions, I guarantee you
will have them tearing their hair out.

The &quot;System&quot; works perfect in the second phase of SnG tourneys, when
the blinds are 1/10 of your stack or more (especially in the $100 and
higher buy-ins). The &quot;System&quot; is much more effective against good to
great players, since it terminates the PRO's after-the-flop playing
edge. Also, online you get called more often, so using the &quot;System&quot;
causes your fluctuations to increase. Notice that you are only a 40% to
60% underdog when you raise all-in with 98 suited and get called by AK,
but the fold equity you get when you don't get called makes-up for that
and gives you a winning edge.
