I'd really like to have giant, rolling battlefortresses, land-going
mobile military bases the size of aircraft carriers or bigger, but I'm
having an awfully hard time coming with a setting that would justify
them. I'm willing to create a world to prop up this idea, and would
very much appreciate some help. Everything I can think of that might
lead to the creation of such improbable monstrosities has a much
better, much more likely solution than landships, so now I leave it to
better minds than mine--which, if you've ever seen my mind, could
include cabbages, but I'd like material from a higher tier than that.

Vast deserts.

Aircraft carriers are more or less ferries for many smaller craft of
different configurations, moving them around on a terrain they aren't
designed for and can't cross on their own. Deserts are dangerous too,
with shifting sands, storms that can strip the flesh from bone and
clog all kinds of mechanics, etc. If you're faced with a world where
half the surface area (not just land) or more is desert, you'll
probably want something like an aircraft carrier for crossing and
manoeuvring and engaging enemies there.

Sheer pride.  Hell, there's some serious dispute over whether aircraft
carriers themselves are worth anything in the days of terrorist
threats and littoral warfare.  But we keep cranking them out anyway,
as an imposing display of military might and economic prosperity.
Battleships and battlecruisers were in the same situation during the
Cold War.

Come to think of it, weren't the Nazis and Soviets competing in World
War II to build 200-ton super-tanks like you're describing?  I believe
at least a few prototypes were actually built, but you'd have to check
it out on your own.

What about an almost-tidelocked world, where the day/night line
moves forever westward at a few mph. You might have a vanguard
of moving cities at the dawn line, bulldozing fresh roadbeds in
the cracked and frozen soil, tilling and planting fresh fields,
and leaving crops to grow and be harvested by the other cities
later in the day (&quot;day?&quot; &quot;year?&quot; &quot;diurn?&quot;). The afternoon and
evening cities manufacture goods to pay the dawn cities with.

You'd need a reason for intercity conflicts to be handled by
land-dreadnaughts rather than aircraft or missiles (or fleets
of small attack vehicles ala &quot;Road Warrior&quot;). Maybe chemical
fuels are scarce, and cities are powered by big flimsy solar
power arrays, not well-suited to aircraft or small vehicles ?

The land-dreadnaughts would of course use nuclear power, for
better performance and so they can operate on the nightside
when needed.

Maybe, but it's a silly one.  Being able to deploy an air attack all
over the planet may not be the answer to every problem, but it is most
certainly useful.  A better argument is that aircraft carriers are too
vulnerable to things like missiles because they are large surface
ships and easily detected and targeted but that is becoming less and
less of an issue.

Research Keith Laumer's &quot;Bolo&quot; universe and stories.  I don't remember
the rationale behind the humongous Bolos -- each of whom could arguably take
on a battalion of normal soldiers -- but I think it had something to do with
entire planets turned into battlefields.  If there's nothing you aren't

Immense tanks. Better do some calculations on what the load per square

came to the conclusion that it was very difficult to approximate
battleship armor (one square foot of steel one inch thick is 40 pounds
therefore 12 inches of steel armor is 480#/sqft) on any vehicle that
would not immediately become mired in even hard-baked earth.

Not sure who wrote what there, the quoting was a bit funny. Anyway...

The Maus (Hitler's 100 ton tank) was designed to cross rivers by driving
across the river bed, using a snorkel to keep the crew and engine
supplied with air. From Wikipedia:

&quot;Another issue found was that the Maus was simply too heavy to cross
bridges. As a result an alternative system was developed, where the Maus
would instead ford the rivers it needed to cross. Due to its size it
could ford relatively deep streams, but for deeper ones it was to
submerge and drive across the river bottom. The solution required tanks
to be paired up. One Maus would supply electrical power to the crossing
vehicle via a cable until it reached the other side. The crew would
receive air through a large snorkel, which was sufficiently long for the
tank to go 45 feet (13 m) underwater.&quot;

See also the Ratte, a proposed 1000-tonne successor to Maus that was
never built. It would have used battleship turrets for its weapons, so
perhaps would have been the first true &quot;landship&quot;.
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landkreuzer_P._1000_Ratte &gt; An even bigger
tank was also brought to the concept stage,
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landkreuzer_P._1500_Monster &gt;. 2500 tonnes!
The P 1500 was to have 250 mm frontal armour and be propelled by two or
four diesel submarine engines. In addition to its main 80 cm gun, it
would have been armed with two 15 cm sFH 18 heavy howitzers and multiple
MG 151 autocannon.

It would also probably have been a complete waste of resources, a
pitifully slow-moving target at the mercy of aircraft (I bet even the
high-altitude bombers of the time would have been useful against such a
thing). So in a sense it's a pity the Nazis never went ahead with it, it
would have both crippled their war effort and left a really cool-looking
relic.

It seems to me that this last sentence is somewhat at odds with your
parenthetical, unless your &quot;relic&quot; is actually the itty bitty pieces left

Of course if it had been built it would hardly have been the only colossal

That would make it harder to support the weight of the vehicle.
Low gravity would be more helpful with making landships feasible.

Speaking of which, mewonders how a really big landship would turn. It's got
to have a wide base to support its weight, and that means lots of slippage
and friction when you try to turn. Maybe have lots of individually turnable
wheels spread all over the undercarriage; that would make it
omnidirectional, too.
The hovercraft option might work if you can keep the areic low- low enough
that you don't have gale force winds blowing out of the sides, anyway.
Oo! Or maybe an ekranoplan. I haven't the slightest clue how you would
manage the landing gear (as far as I know, large ones were only ever built
to run over water), but at least it wouldn't have to be able to turn on the
ground.

<POSTDATE> 2007-07-21T08:59:00 </POSTDATE>
RE the miring issue:  tanks work because the tread distributes the
weight across the entire tread surface.  100 tons perched on 4 tires,
say, 4 square feet of surface area = 25 tons per sq ft.  Stretch
supported treads between the tires, say 20 square feet surface = 5 tons
per square foot.  (numbers pulled out of thin air for illustrative
purposes only)

Bolos, Ogres and other similar vehicles make this &quot;work&quot; by combining
HUGE tread surface areas AND introducing very effective armor that
weighs hardly anything.

In the gaming world Steve Jackson had to jump through some hoops to
give a semi-realistic background for the creation of his Laumer-esque
Ogres (taking a cue from Young Frankenstein, they ought to have been
called Igors...)

He created BPC armor (see above), and posited weapon's technology that
started with nukes and went up from there.  He then came to the
(silly?) conclusion that only gigantic targets that placed lots of
weaponry in one location were the truly appropriate platform in that
environment, and that only tiny, fast-moving hovercraft with popguns
(GEVs for Ground Effects Vehicle) were the counter technology.

I worked on some addenda and expansion packs for that game and will say
that my main problem was trying to get Jackson to inject at least a
little real-worldism into the game:  for example, I proposed a killer
satellite expansion;  he said &quot;no, the environment is so lethal they
wouldn't survive long enough&quot;, I said &quot;ummm - really, really cheap
throw-away systems, launch hundreds, if not thousands to get the job
done&quot;  he said &quot;no, don't like it&quot;

Ok, his perogative, his game, but it serves to illustrate how far from
any real extrapolation of weapons technology the game had gotten.

I believe you will have similar issues with a story about such fortress
tanks.  You're going to have to stretch the conditions so far to justify
them that you'll be in lala land.

Consider - one weapons' platform - even if skeleton manned - is one
target.  You build one.  The other guy builds one.  They meet up and
start slugging it out.  Meanwhile, the other guy sneaks around the
battle with a couple of hundred serfs armed with pitchforks...

or

you build the great, impervious, multi-turreted super weapons system
and it sets off in pursuit of your military goals.  The other guy
settles for thousands of cheap throwaways.  You grind, and grind, and
grind and grind.  he builds and builds.  you run out of bullets...

The history of the western alliance(s) in warfare is one of using
economic prowess and attrition warfare against superior weapons
systems.  Three Shermans to take out a Tiger?  So what, you build five
shermans in the time it takes to build one tiger.  Net two shermans...

The Russians, during their war with Finland, fielded a handful of very
long, very tall, multi-turreted armored vehicles.  A little while
later, they introduced the T-34.  Lessons were learned.  Comparatively
speaking, one large weapon system is relatively easy to neutralize,
isolate or ignore.

Mobility, armed with just enough protection and just enough firepower,
is the real key to armored warfare.  I'm quite surprised that no one
has yet gotten around to fielding a one person tank...

You might get away with it if you start with the premise that your
&quot;tanks&quot; were not tanks to begin with, but some kind of large mining, or
harvesting, systems, (economics justifies the size) and then get pressed
into service because there's nothing else suitable to use.  Crews adding
hastily conceived armor, strapping autocannon here, there, everywhere,
modifying ranging and communications lasers, using fertilizer to fuel
solid fuel rockets, etc., etc,

Sometimes, weapon systems get stuck in a response/counter-response
cycle, where little attention is paid to the fact that something else
entirely would be better.  The tank was first built to respond to
Machine guns, and conceived of as nothing more than an armored,
trench-crossing box.  They were designed to move at an infantryman's
pace, had MGs side-mounted for firing down trenches that were being
crossed, no turrets, no concept of blitzkreig, etc., etc.  It took some
brilliant, dedicated minds to drop the 'anti-machine gun weapon'
paradigm.

In a similar fashion, your story could have your combatants stuck in a
'giant armed harvester' cycle;  anyone who comes up with a radical new
(better) idea is summarily shuffled off to the antarctic base for
upsetting the applecart and threatening senior officer's sinecures.

&gt; I worked on some addenda and expansion packs for that game and will say
&gt; that my main problem was trying to get Jackson to inject at least a
&gt; little real-worldism into the game:  for example, I proposed a killer
&gt; satellite expansion;  he said &quot;no, the environment is so lethal they
&gt; wouldn't survive long enough&quot;, I said &quot;ummm - really, really cheap
&gt; throw-away systems, launch hundreds, if not thousands to get the job
&gt; done&quot;  he said &quot;no, don't like it&quot;

&gt; Ok, his perogative, his game, but it serves to illustrate how far from
&gt; any real extrapolation of weapons technology the game had gotten.
">

Well, to his credit, once he's got the fanciful environment, his loyalty
is to making fun game elements in that environment, rather than trying
to make things realistic.

And let's face it, the notion of BPC armor itself is not really
realistic enough to throw off the dogs, anyway.  He wanted an
environment with huge, autonomous megatanks on an all-out nuclear
battlefield.  To do that you have to stretch reality quite a bit, which
is what he did.  Once done, reality is already stretched.

Regarding your specific suggestion of satellites, sure, you could use
hundreds.  But how would you translate that into a fun game mechanism?
(Actually, Jackson _does_ write about satellites in &quot;Notes on the Ogre,&quot;
and comes to the conclusion that they may well be used, they just would
be knocked down immediately and so would only be used in special cases.)

I think I've commented on this before, but it always seemed to me that
along with all the other problems, wouldn't 'BPC' as Jackson presents
it tend to catch fire and burn in an oxygen atmosphere?  It's supposed
to be basically carbon fiber, after all, and there'd be plenty of heat
from nuclear detonations in the area.

He never goes into detail.  BPC stands for &quot;biphase carbide,&quot; whatever
that means.  It's just standard handwavium that is suggested to be
strong enough to thwart nuclear blasts -- yeah, right -- and also be
extremely light.  He never, very rightly, goes into any more detail than
give it a name (which is immediately superseded by the acronym) and
describe its properties, and those properties are designed to give him
autonomous supertanks on a nuclear battlefield, realism or not.

Something that big wouldn't be reduced to itty bitty pieces after a
bombing raid, even a bombing raid sufficient to render it useless as a

True, but the more the merrier. A 2500-ton tank would have wasted a heck

Yes, and some of those notes were based on our discussions and
correspondence - AFTER (well after) he had turned down the expansion
pack.

Several colleagues and I were contracted to develop at least one, if
not more expansion sets for Ogre following the release of Shockwave;
I'd done a computer program that generated all of the possible 'legal'
weapon system factors earlier and had also released a pocket game that
SJG came very close to buying.  In other words, earlier work had
impressed them and they gave me the opportunity to do more stuff for
them.

We offered two concepts a space/satellite expansion and a combat
engineers expansion.  The basic thrust of the space pak was an
additional defense against cruise missiles, and included rules for the
effects of communications disruption, EMP effects, killsats, etc.  This
was designed to meet a few other requirements that had been discussed,
namely small counter set, no new mapboard, etc.  We successfully
achieved those goals, despite the fact that SJG decided not to go with
that.

The second - (engineers) was much cooler and a much bigger expansion.
Buildings with strength points, bridge destruction &amp;c had already been
introduced, we just enhanced it.  Engineers (fought like infantry,
moved like infantry) could build/repair/demolish structures.  They
could emplace mines (both automatic and command detonate) as well as
specialty defensive structures - Dragons Teeth (slow ogres down) and
GEV Pickets (slice up gevs).  Finally, we also introduced Ballistic
Transports in order to re-introduce an airborne cavalry element into
the game.  BATS and BITS (Ballistic Armor/Infantry Transports) fit
right in with SJ's constraints.  If your're going to do something in
Ogre, you have to do it FAST.  Essentially giant artillery shells,
capable of carrying a few points of armor and infantry.  Randomized
landing locations.  Drop a couple of these behind an opponent's
advancing forces and watch the fun.

After all was said and done, the word we got on that expansion pak was
that Steve didn't accept it because it threatened him;  he'd been
throwing restrictions at us, expecting that we wouldn't be able to get
around them and we did;  clearly demonstrating that under his rules, he
had missed a few things.

So, no pak.  Ogre/Gev new development stopped.  But he did keep my map.
I'm still trying to get ahold of the last set of stuff they put out to
see if its my map in there...

Don't get me wrong, we had a lot of fun, but it soon became obvious
that Steve had a 'not created here' attitude about things, even if he
still asked other designers to create stuff for him.  (This was
confirmed in discussions with folks who were working directly for him
at the time, so I'm not just making suppositions).

ROFL.  You really think the American shipbuilding industry has, well,
any political influence worth mentioning?  Sorry, but no.  And the
one shipyard that's still in the aircraft carrier business, seems to
be something of an unwanted stepchild of the defense industry.  It's
currently owned by Northrop-Grumman, the weakest of the big aerospace
primes, and is peripheral to NG's core business.

So no, the usual conspiracy theory doesn't work here.

Aircraft carriers are still around because lots of Admirals want them
around.  And the Admirals aren't necessarily wrong.  The only dispute
about whether aircraft carriers are still relevant comes from people
who haven't paid much attention to what they've been doing.

Aircraft carriers are *especially* relevant in the days of terrorist
threats and so forth.  In a classic war, the alliances and battle lines
are clearly drawn, and so you can usually find or build an airfield
somewhere on your side of the line to base all your aircraft.  Something
like the War on Terror, even most of your allies are going to be kind of
reluctant to host that sort of infrastructure, and there's noplace you
can build an airfield where your pilots and ground crew aren't liable
to be killed in their sleep.

Except, perhaps, a hundred miles out to sea.

Thanks for all the thoughts, folks. I'm looking now at a thin-
atmosphere world with a lot of desert, where these mobile military
bases started off as something else, ended up being used for war, and
are now stuck in the &quot;response/counter-response cycle&quot;, with the
official dogma being that these crawlers are the best solution to
military problems, and with those who so much as propose a study into
other alternatives being shut down by a military-industrial complex
heavily invested in the idea. I imagine there is warfare via other
methods, to include missiles, smaller craft, and the like, but all, or
mostly, based from these crawling fortresses.

It will be a pretty bizarre world, and if the development of new
options (and the resistance to this process) is not going to be the
central plot, it certainly is going to be a major portion of it.

Undoubtedly it will make for a quirky read, not enjoyable by all, but
then again, I am a bad writer--and it will have been made much better
by your contributions.

Thanks, all!

The Wikipedia article claims a speed of 15 km/h for the tank, whereas
the Bismarck could manage nearly 60. Checked a few other articles on
random battleships from that era and that seemed like an average sort of
speed for battleships.

Also, land has a lot more constraints on where a big tank could go.
Hills, ridges, buildings, etc. The ocean is wide open.

&gt; What about an almost-tidelocked world, where the day/night line
&gt; moves forever westward at a few mph. You might have a vanguard
&gt; of moving cities at the dawn line, bulldozing fresh roadbeds in
&gt; the cracked and frozen soil, tilling and planting fresh fields,
&gt; and leaving crops to grow and be harvested by the other cities
&gt; later in the day (&quot;day?&quot; &quot;year?&quot; &quot;diurn?&quot;). The afternoon and
&gt; evening cities manufacture goods to pay the dawn cities with.
">

When I first read the setup, I was thinking something vaguely similar
- large mobile cities which become heavily defended, rather than just
purpose-built ubertanks.  I was thinking that there would be some
natural phenomenon that occurred in unpredictible spots that was of
value, rather than a slow day like you suggest.

Anyhow, here is what I thought of.  The great galactic empire has a
rather curious strategy for colonising worlds with vast mineral
wealth.  They drop down the colonists, and pretty much let them do
whatever they want.  They can hate the empire, fight amongst
themselves, whatever.  The empire sees micomanaging colony worlds as a
waste of resources, because it basically requires potentially
dangerous occupation.  So, the empire deploys colony worlds as
independent things which can make useful trading partners.  The empire
just leaves space forces in orbit to bombard anything like a space
port.  Saves on the possibility of competition from the semi-
independent trading-partner colony world.  So, any effort to build
suborbital missiles, or even useful airplanes results in searing
imperial death rays.

Now, on this particular world, there is ample unobtanium (valuable to
the empire) in the core of the planet.  Because the planet is
geologically very active, unobtanium will spurt out onto the surface
now and then, only to be covered up by more mundane rocks.  So, the
empire realises that the only way to colonise this planet and get at
the unobtanium is to deploy mobile cities/refineries that can scoot
out of the way of a coming earthquake/eruption, and can quickly drive
to the site of an unobtanium flow.

Naturally, each mobile city wants as much unobtanium as possible to
trade with the empire, so hostilities result.  The locals start to arm
and armor their vast cities.  The empire is more than happy to supply
weapons to a civil war on their own colony because every arms shipment
means more unobtanium.  They don't care if one mobile despot manages
to take over a few tanks, or kills off some of the colonial
population.  Short term profits outweigh longterm gains, and they can
always recolonise the planet if everybody gets killed off in the war.

A contrived situation, but not obviously impossible.

couple of thoughts:

first - if your empire has the resources to place military in orbit
around every colony to bomb them into submission when they get too
uppity, said empire has the means to control access to space without
the need to park forces in orbit.

colonies/colonists are landed by ships that do not possess anything
beyond the ability to make geosynch.  FTL/long range/interplanetary
tech is reserved for THE EMPIRE.

Second - there's a game called ROBOTS! from TFG (80s);  Earth
destroyed, hellishly radioactive.  Space colonies send down 'factories'
that are mining the resources and they use self-built military bots for
defense and seizing resources.

(They still had smaller units for the majority of combat - one you lost
your factory, pretty much game over...)

I can think of two semi-plausible backgrounds for giant
tanks/mobile-city-fortresses:  first comedy universe.  we have them
because we want to, because we can.  second, part of a larger
environment where folks can 'play' with all kinds of military
technologies, prototypes, test out outlandish ideas, etc.

You should be able to get away with a crew of zero, if Captain NOLO is

I'm not trying to make comparisons with 'powered armor' as one person
tanks:  the MI's in Starship Troopers were described as having the
equivalent of a 20th century division's worth of firepower.

I'm simply wondering what constraints there are on applying EXISTING,
well-proven technologies that support situational awareness, C&amp;C, etc.
to an armored, ground-travelling system.

Loading large caliber weapons is one - but no one said that 120mm
smooth bore APFSDS depleted uranium rounds was a requirement.  35 mm
autocannon with armor wrapped around it and a helmet-controlled
laying/sighting system is certainly achievable and would probably be
very effective - especially in a scouting and infantry support role.
The profile of such vehicle would be extremely small.

Likewise, a two-person system armed with TOW-II for the traditional
tank-destroyer role - etc., etc.

I'm not talking complex automatic loading systems that will ram your
arm down the tank barrel here, I'm simply positing that perhaps some of
the systems already in use could be modified to create such a thing and
suggesting that it would have several roles that it would fill well.

The pilot of a ground-attack aircraft is rarely in combat for more
than a minute at a time, usually knows exactly which one target he
is going to attack in his minute of combat, and then gets to disengage
while he figures out what he's going to do next.  And fighter pilots
do their best work when they can arrange things the same way; only
in the movies does anyone actually seek out those long, complicated
dogfights.

Being fast doesn't make things *harder*, it makes things *easier*.
Once you get to the end of the very simple plan that you went into
battle with, you get to call an instant &quot;time out&quot; many miles from
the battlefield while you come up with the next simple plan.

The problem is, this means ceding the battlefield to the enemy for
most of the battle - unless you've got forces on your side that
*don't* bug out after the first minute of shooting.  And those
guys are going to need a much higher order of teamwork to keep on
top of the situation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, but they're NOT.  And the people who have believed otherwise,
on those occasions when someone gave them actual attack helicopters
to play with, have gotten a lot of them needlessly shot down.  See,
e.g., the relative Army and USMC experience during the invasion of
Iraq.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Which is fine if you're doing hit-and-run attacks.  It is NOT ENOUGH
if you're going to try and hang around on the battlefied.  Whatever
battle plan you arrived with will be obsolete after the first minute,
and the battlefield really is too complex for one or two people alone
to come up with and implement a new plan in real time.

Really, people have tried this.  They've tried it a *lot*.  Tanks with
two-man crews, fail miserably even when they are much bigger and more
powerful than the opposition.  Ground-attack aircraft and helicopters,
crash and burn when they try to maintain a constant battlefield presence
rather than conducting hit-and-run attacks.  And even the infantry tends
to break down to four-man teams to do its work.

If you think some clever new technology is going to change that, well,
maybe, but that's going to be a hard sell.  If you think that pointing
to some already-established aspect of military science or history is
going to support your one-man tank idea, you've misunderstood what has
been going on.

It depends on the situation. I've logged 2 hours of SEAD (2 one-hour

passes a couple times doing CAS (18xmk82 plus 3 strafe passes. Did a
couple re-attacks on SA2 sites so wingman could dump his ordnance
after switch problem on first pass. (Seemed like a good idea at the

Swimming tanks. Both Soviets and Germans explored tanks crawling
across the bottoms of bodies of water. Two problems - holding a
heading and lack of traction. I learned, during a tour of the German
tank proving ground at Trier, that the tank loses so much traction due
to the displaced water reducing its apparent weight that it can become
unable to climb the opposite bank. I suppose a gyro compass could be
used to hold a heading but mag compasses didn't work very well inside
a standard tank.

That may depend on the contour of the tank. I suppose it's possible
you'd be able to design it such that these bursts would just press it
into the ground.

As the OGREs were purely AI driven, being kicked around wouldn't
necessarily stop them, anyway.

I changed my mind.  I'm not going to give up the field so easily.

Here's one example of an armored vehicle that saw service for multiple
decades and had very good export sales, usually indicative of one of
two things:  either it was a good system or it was cheap enough to make
it a good system.

Ferret Armored car:The most popular British Armored Vehicle imported to
the USA! Built by Daimler Co. the Ferret has been in service since 1951.
Driver sits center front with the gunner or commander right behind him.
&quot;Its like driving and armored go cart&quot;  more at
http://www.military-vehicle.net/ferret.htm

Just one example of a vehicle developed for a specific role with
minimal crew.

I think your assessment of &quot;been tried, never gonna happen&quot; is way too
dismissive of emerging technologies.  I also think that you took my
analogy of various airborne weapon systems too far.  I was pointing out
the basic capabilities of certain systems - not the mission
requirements, not the tactical environment, only a set of capabilities
that have already been accomplished.

I then suggested that some of those could be used to create a one or
two person crewed armored vehicle.  The objections you raised were not
show stoppers, they are only engineering or tactical issues that need
to be resolved.

Tanks, as we currently know them, are reaching the end of their benefit
in the never-ending battle between offensive and defensive weapons,
firepower vs protection and mobility.  Necessary future improvements
are approaching the economic threshold as well.

A usual solution to those kinds of issues is to opt for multiple,
cheaper systems.
