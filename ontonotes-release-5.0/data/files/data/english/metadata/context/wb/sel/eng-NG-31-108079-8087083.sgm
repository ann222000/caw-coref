I wrote off my Firebird XL the other night.  Lost controls (RF
interference?), no throttle, no rudder (ruddervator?), just straight
down into the sun baked clay field from about 60'.  Glue and tape
isn't going to do it this time.

Now I need a new a/c.  Any suggestions?

I am not an experienced RC pilot at all - I'm not ready for superspeed
acrobatics. I have a little bit of dual time in a 1:1 Cessna, a fair
bit of MSFS time and maybe 10 flights with the Firebird.   I found the
throttle/rudder controls on the Firebird somewhat unnatural (kept
looking for pitch and roll control that wasn't there).

In a perfect world, plane #2 would need less room than the Firebird -
you can't get access to a soccer field or baseball diamond around here
except at midnight.  Hand launch is probably a good idea.

I've built lots of models, so kit or arf isn't an issue.

Thanks,
Chris

GWS Slowstick.

If you are going to stick with the hobby, get at least a 4 channel radio
system. I believe the Slow Sticks are available with an &quot;Everything
Included&quot; type of package which would include the plane, radio gear both
transmitter and receiver, flight battery, servos, etc.
Best thing about the Slow Stick (other than UPGRADES!) is if you crash the
sucker you can usually tape or epoxy it back together. The aluminum fuse is
the weakest spot but you can buy those pretty cheap. You can also buy new
motors, entire motor/gearsets and other replacement parts online fairly
easily.
Of course, the entire plane w/motor usually costs about $35 USD.
Practically everyone at my field has a Slow Stick, even us 3D guys.
You could probably fly one in a front yard or out in the street but I dont
think I would recommend that.
I highly recommend one for a second plane.

True they dont like wind but a light breeze isnt a problem. I fly one using
a stock 350 motor/gearbox, 1180 prop and using a 2050mAh 2cell Lipo pack.
Only other mods were to cut the wing tips off to what would be the outermost
bay and trim the stabilizer down to a triangle shape. After I got that tail
chewed off during a dogfight I put on a 2mm coroplast tailgroup that I
happend to have purchased a couple years ago and never used.
My neck usually gives out before the lipo.

FYI, they now come with a fiberglass fuselage that is MUCH stronger,
although a touch heavier.  If you do get one, there are several companies
selling add ons and conversion kits that'll make it either aerobatic,
gliderlike, or even an AutoGyro (no wings, two unpowered rotor blades).
It's a lot more versatile than your average beginners plane.  It's also a
blast to night fly with glow wire oulining the wing and fuse....

The last 2 slow sticks I bought had fiberglass stick fuselages. I can
recommend this plane.

Lazy Bee !  They are a blast, and very slow and forgiving.

It will handle the wind, too, but only 3 channel.  (no ailerons; the rudder
makes it turn and bank automatically)  That might be good to help you unlearn
the full sized bad habits!

Most full sized pilots say that RC is much harder.  Having the turn and elevator
on the same stick would probably be a good thing for you.

If you decide to go with a &quot;Bee&quot;, DO NOT GET AN ARF !!!  The ARFs are
the biggest piece of sh*t I have ever seen.  Get a kit or some plans and
