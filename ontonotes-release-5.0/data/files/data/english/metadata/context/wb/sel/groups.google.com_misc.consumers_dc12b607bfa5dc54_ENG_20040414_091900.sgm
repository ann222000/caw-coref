If a person from one of the 12 European Union (EU) countries using the
Euro currency took a vacation in the U.S. in March 2002 and then
another one in March 2004, he would find that gas in the U.S. is
cheaper now than it was then.

In March 2002, the price of gasoline in the United States was .40
(Euro cents/litre-unleaded). In March 2004, the price of gasoline in
the US was .38. In otherwords, the price of gasoline in the U.S. has
dropped 5% in the last two years for European tourists.

For people living in the U.S., however, the price of gasoline has gone
up 35.3% in the last 2 years. For people in the EU, gasoline has gone
up about 6.4% during this period.

The conversion rate for USD to EUROs on 3/31/2002 was 1.14940. On
3/31/2004 it was .82150. This means that the dollar has lost 32.8% of
its value during this period and that the high gas prices in the US
are obviously due to the crash of the dollar.

So, this is one of the few times, I guess, that you can't blame the
oil companies or OPEC. You could write your congressman, I suppose,
but I doubt if it would do any good. A better idea might be to kick
all the incumbents out of office in November and start over :&gt;

in the Republican camp.

And while many people consider Bush to be the focus of their anger, the
real anger should be directed toward Karl Rove and Dick Cheney. They're
the ones that are pulling the strings of George W. Bush.

My suspicion is that the pendulum is going to swing left again, both in
the White House and Congress. But I have a real problem with Kerry's
campaign. In essence, it's an 'attack Bush' campaign with no real issues
being discussed.

Of course I'm no fan of the Bush campaign either. Go to

Actually it is worse than you describe, there are 57 different
blends sold in the contiguous states. They refer to them as
the Heinz Boutique Fuels Collection. They create a nightmare
scenarios for pumping, transporting, storage and distribution.
There are heavy fines if ever mixed, cross shipped, or sold
in the wrong area.

&gt; Get your facts straight.

&gt; It is the fault of greedy OPEC.

"/> Get YOUR facts straight. A US$ does not buy nearly as much as it did a couple of
years ago. If you are being paid in US$ but live in another country it's like
taking a cut in pay. When the US balances its budget and reduces its trade
deficit then the US$ will recover its traditional value relative to other
currencies and the price of oil and everything else the US imports will get
cheaper.

Virtually every currency around the world (even the Russian ruble) has increased
in value relative to the US$. So OPEC gets paid in less valuable US$ but buys
things from countries whose prices in local currencies now cost more $US than
before. US$ may be the current common currency for world trade but that does not
mean prices for individual items outside the US remain at a constant US$ value.
For example it would take, on average, about 20% more US$ to pay for an item
made in Canada right now that it did a year ago. In Feb 2002 a US$ would buy
almost 1.16 Euros worth of goods. Now it will only buy only .83 Euros. So
anything bought from a Euro based company will cost 40% more US$.

Like father, like son. Bush Jr. should be reminded &quot;It's the economy, Stupid&quot;

Do you think that is good thing for Europe? It's not! The
reason is because productivity is low, interest rates and
inflation are high in Europe while productivity is high, interest
rates are low and inflation in all most nonexistent in the US.
American products become more attractive outside the US, while
European products become less attractive outside Europe as your
price continue to go up. ;)

Most people are environmentalists, in that we all want clean air
and water. The difference is the environuts want it their way,
no mater the consequences to the world economy. We can have
clean water and air with reasonableness. The environuts are
using the same tired arguments to stop drilling in ANWAR as they
used in their efforts to stop drilling on the North Slope. They
were not true then and they are not true now. The problem is we
ALL pay for foolishness of the environuts.

MTBE was forced upon the oil companies, as was ethanol. They had
a ready low cost alternative in menthol but were denied it use
because it was not renewable.

&gt;answer: decades ago, in that time demand has increased and production

"/> This is not a convincing argument that there is a capacity shortage.
It could just as well be true that refineries are at 10% of capacity,
but the greedy oil companies won't produce more so they can drive
the price up.

When was the last time the US built a buggy-whip factory? Hint:
that doesn't mean there's a buggy-whip factory capacity shortage,
even if the demand for antique buggy whips has gone up in the
last decade.

A convincing argument would show that refineries are at or near
capacity, and that oil companies are not producing more gasoline
or other refined-oil products BECAUSE OF CAPACITY LIMITS, not, for
example, because of a shortage of crude, unavailability of transport
of the crude to the refineries (possibly through a war zone),
MONOPOLISTIC DESIRE TO CAUSE A SHORTAGE TO DRIVE THE PRICE UP,
insufficient demand at these prices, OPEC limits on crude sales,
or EPA limits on production.

If there really was a capacity shortage the oil companies are worried
about, they wouldn't be shutting down profitable refineries. If
they are greedy monopolistic pigs, they might shut down profitable
refineries to drive the price up due to artificial shortages. If
they think the profitable refineries will soon become unprofitable
(say, due to new EPA regulations or equipment just plain wearing
out and being too expensive to replace or impossible to replace
due to EPA regulations), they might shut them down.

When the Euro countries buy oil from the OPEC countries the must first change the Euros into
Dollars. Because of the evil Bush war the Euro is now stronger than the Dollar. The Arabs hate bush
and are getting even by raising the price of oil.

As soon as somebody else is president the price of oil will come down.

If you vote for Bush, you are voting for higher oil prices.

build a refinery. They ink long-term agreements to put into place a stream
of delivery agreements for everything from office supplies to light-bulbs,
spare parts, new equipment, lunches, and tankers full of crude (done years
in advance and running for equally long periods of time)...just so they can
fit your idea of &quot;driving the price up&quot; by reducing supply? Sounds like
another liberal financial fantasy...right along with tax cuts benefit only
the top 1% of taxpayers...

Running a refinery isn't exactly like shoveling the shit out of that barn
you live in. You can't stop, and take a few hours off to drink a beer.
Once they're up and running, a lot of complex steps have to happen rather
flawlessly for a long time to keep in going. Failing to do so results in
things going &quot;BOOM!&quot;, from time-to-time...

You might indeed shut down an otherwise profitable refinery...however, the
taxes, license fees, maintenance, insurance, and at least a skeleton staff
still need to be paid for. According to your math, that's easily done. If
it's so easy, I'd think that you're missing out on a chance to make a
killing...

or any other manufactured commodity. When the price of oil goes up, *ALL*
of what they need and want also goes up. The net result? Nada! When one
of the princes wants a new Mercedes or plane, do you think that they make
them or trade the Pakies some oil for toys? They buy the cars from Germany
and the planes from the US. What do you think happens to the cost of making
and shipping those toys if the price of oil goes up?

The only ones that win are the governments of those countries that make the
products from that oil, and get their tax cut off of a percentage of the
sales price of those products.

"/> Here's a clue for you. I heard on the news, that tankers of refined
gasoline is being turned away when trying to come into America Ports.
The EPA passed a new regulation for refineries to abide by and need to
file documented proof they were. Although the US EPA cannot force
overseas refineries to abide their rulez, they were given the power to
'embargo' refined goods from refineries/countries who haven't filled
the papers with our government. Prices are high, and we are turning
away full tankers already in our waters?

Oh, if you don't know why they now refine overseas and ship gasoline
to us, cause eventhough the number of cars and trucks have increased,
no new refineries have built in decades.

So the US regulates import trade too. There's your clue for today!
:-P

Sorry, I heard it on the radio and wished I could give you a source.
Might show up in a search engine soon.

Permit me a slight comment. As those of us who have been in the Middle East
know the Arabs dont wipe their asses with paper they use the fingers of the
right hand. Accordingly it is considered an insult to offer your right hand
to shake. FWIW they also dont have toilet stools. Instead they have a hole
in the floor with raised sandal shaped surfaces to indicate where you are to
put your feet when you squat. It only works if you are built to the
standard physical model of an Arab.

&gt; the White House and Congress. But I have a real problem with Kerry's
&gt; campaign. In essence, it's an 'attack Bush' campaign with no real issues
&gt; being discussed.

&gt; Of course I'm no fan of the Bush campaign either. Go to
&gt;&lt;http://mysite.verizon.net/vze83ehl&gt; to see a truly alternative
&gt; Bush/Cheney campaign sticker.

"/> I'm a democrat that's not very crazy about Kerry either. Besides,
he's going to inherit one helluva mess. Maybe we ought to let Bush
win. In another 4 years he's sure to have accumulated enough rope to
hang himself and if we happen to get a majority in congress we can
impeach him.

&gt; Permit me a slight comment. As those of us who have been in the Middle
East
&gt; know the Arabs dont wipe their asses with paper they use the fingers of
the
&gt; right hand. Accordingly it is considered an insult to offer your right
hand
&gt; to shake. FWIW they also dont have toilet stools. Instead they have a
hole
&gt; in the floor with raised sandal shaped surfaces to indicate where you are
to
&gt; put your feet when you squat. It only works if you are built to the
&gt; standard physical model of an Arab.

"/> Yes, yes, I knew that (BTDT), I was being a bit (obviously too) euphemistic.
The point I was trying to make was that they don't make much of what they
need/use--they have to import most everything. So simply raising the price
of oil is a non-solution for them. If it were and they thought they could
put a hurting on us, they'd raise the price to $100/bbl in a heartbeat. But
when that happens, a lot of other things happen as well...everything they
import goes up in price, and then the increase in price jumps to above the
cost to &quot;harvest&quot; a bbl of oil, others will start producing...and so on...

However, the Arabs I stayed with *did* use TP. Whether they did it for my
benefit or not, I don't know. But *I* was grateful and appreciated it a
lot! Never did like the squatting over the hole though. Had ta do that in
Italy and Turkey as well...never did learn to like it...

&gt; If a person from one of the 12 European Union (EU) countries using the
&gt; Euro currency took a vacation in the U.S. in March 2002 and then
&gt; another one in March 2004, he would find that gas in the U.S. is
&gt; cheaper now than it was then.

&gt; In March 2002, the price of gasoline in the United States was .40
&gt; (Euro cents/litre-unleaded). In March 2004, the price of gasoline in
&gt; the US was .38. In otherwords, the price of gasoline in the U.S. has
&gt; dropped 5% in the last two years for European tourists.

&gt; For people living in the U.S., however, the price of gasoline has gone
&gt; up 35.3% in the last 2 years. For people in the EU, gasoline has gone
&gt; up about 6.4% during this period.

&gt; The conversion rate for USD to EUROs on 3/31/2002 was 1.14940. On
&gt; 3/31/2004 it was .82150. This means that the dollar has lost 32.8% of
&gt; its value during this period and that the high gas prices in the US
&gt; are obviously due to the crash of the dollar.

&gt; So, this is one of the few times, I guess, that you can't blame the
&gt; oil companies or OPEC. You could write your congressman, I suppose,
&gt; but I doubt if it would do any good. A better idea might be to kick
&gt; all the incumbents out of office in November and start over :&gt;

"/> The price of gas and the value of the Euro don't really have anything to do
with one another. This is a very strange argument and makes no sense.

Incorrect...

First, the SUV era began long before Bush took office. Second, the CAFE
standards still apply. They were not repealed by anybody. It's that SUVs are
considered &quot;trucks&quot; and CAFE doesn't apply to trucks.

Where are you getting this stuff.

In one sense CAFE is a large reason that SUVs came about. Some families would
have been happy with a station wagon (which is a &quot;car&quot; so subject to CAFE) but
couldn't find station wagons since they drug down the &quot;average fleet CAFE&quot;
mileage. Since large families still needed large vehicles, the car
manufacturers built passenger vehicles on truck frames which exempted them from
CAFE. CAFE would have been better implemented IF it applied different
standards to different vehicle requirements. A large station wagon should
never have been lumped in with a standard for overall smaller passenger
cars...totally different requirement between the vehicles.

Well, OPEC (or the Saudi's) don't set prices directly. They can influence them
by manipulating production output levels, however. The price is bid up or down
on the commodities and futures markets. It's supply and demand, pure and
simple. Always has been. When there is a oversupply, the markets bid down
because there is more product than is needed, if supply is tight, it gets bid
up. Simple market action in action. You are correct that a weak US dollar
does adversely impact commodity prices, especially foreign commodities like
oil.

&gt;&gt; So-called &quot;gas guzzlers&quot; are plentiful because if given a choice
&gt;&gt; people don't want to drive anemic little sardine cans. Do you think
&gt;&gt; Honda &amp; Toyota would even still be around if they didn't start making
&gt;&gt; large cars &amp; SUVs with V6 &amp; V8 engines? How many Camrys or SUVs does
&gt;&gt; Toyota sell compared to Echos? My guess is a lot more. We gripe
&gt;&gt; about high gas prices but aren't willing to make the sacrifices.

&gt; Average Fuel Efficiency standards were addressing that problem. Under
&gt; the CAFE Rules, auto makers had to reach certain average fuel efficiency
&gt; standards for all their cars. When in effect, auto fuel efficiency was
&gt; rising rapidly.

&gt; But Moron Bush and the GOP got rid of CAFE standards, ushering in the
&gt; ridiculous SUV era. Now he's got us at war so that people can drive
&gt; Hummmers.

"/> Was it really under Bush? SUV's have been around longer than his
administration has. The thing is, it really doesn't make any difference
who is in office - the congress has the power. And when it comes to U.S.
politics - capitalism is built into our political system. Until we
change that, we're always going to be at the mercy of corporate America.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; And frankly a large part of the problem is that we love our cars.
&gt;&gt; Look at the number of people who commute 60+ mi. each way to work

&gt;&gt; 6-pack and shuttle their kids to school when bus service exists.
&gt;&gt; We're all to blame here.

&gt; Obviously, gasoline is too cheap. Let's raise the gas tax 5 cents a
&gt; year forever, and give all the money to rapid transit.

"/> Rhode Island is a perfect test bed for a rapid transit system. But we
underfund RIPTA year after year. Put a .25 tax on every gallon of
gasoline and we'd have one hell of a public transit system.

big local industry is designing/making products against it. But it's not!

&gt;&gt;Jobs created by pollution controls are professional jobs of many kinds,

&gt;&gt;eliminated when pollution is cleaned up.

&gt; back to square 1, you are eliminating many low level manufacturing

The national GNP increase caused by employment and products in pollution

jobs that are eliminated many times over.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If a person from one of the 12 European Union (EU) countries using the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Euro currency took a vacation in the U.S. in March 2002 and then
&gt;&gt;&gt;another one in March 2004, he would find that gas in the U.S. is
&gt;&gt;&gt;cheaper now than it was then.....

&gt;&gt;I hate it when people tell me that gas is really a good deal at $2 a
&gt;&gt;gallon.

&gt;&gt;Also, I'm a conservative and I don't buy all of &quot;It's the fault of the
&gt;&gt;liberals&quot; crap.

&gt;&gt;I'm not blind. I see gas stations disappearing. I see intersections
&gt;&gt;where there is now only one gas station where there used to be more.
&gt;&gt;That lone gas station will have prices 5 to 10 cents higher than areas
&gt;&gt;where there is competition.

&gt;&gt;The Bush administration let big oil consolidate. The arguement was
&gt;&gt;that closing gas stations will make oil companies more efficient and
&gt;&gt;they will pass those savings along to the consumer. Bull shit.

&gt;&gt;Don't piss down my back and tell me it's raining.

&gt;&gt;So, this is one of the few times, I guess, that you can't blame the
&gt;&gt;oil companies or OPEC. You could write your congressman, I suppose,
&gt;&gt;but I doubt if it would do any good. A better idea might be to kick
&gt;&gt;all the incumbents out of office in November and start over :&gt;

&gt;&gt;You can review historical gasoline prices at:

&gt;&gt;You can review historical currency exchange rates at:
&gt;&gt;http://www.oanda.com/convert/fxhistory

&gt; You are full of Crap.
&gt; OPEC trades oil internationally in US Dollars not in Euros

&gt; Get your facts straight.

&gt; It is the fault of greedy OPEC.
&gt; PJ

"/> One of the reasons supposed to lie behind the US' military action in the
Middle East is to keep it that way.
Suppose at the time when the USD and the Euro were at parity,OPEC had
switched.
What would have happened?

What is wrong with some of you people? Some of you keep citing events that
occurred before Bush took office and then blame Bush for them. You all better
get your calendars out and do some research and to when historical events
occurred, or you risk coming to grossly uninformed conclusions!

You have me convinced. If what you post is true, unless we want
to export even more jobs, looks like we need to vote for Bush.
By the way if you don't think the air and water is much cleaner
I'll bet you didn't live in the 40's and 50's when all of our
sewerage went in the river and everything was powered by steam
made for coal and steam locomotives moved all the freight, right?

You are incorrect CAFE does indeed apply to light trucks, but at

You are kidding, right? IT is not 'much worse' it is less than 5
MPG. The government never intended to set the same standard of
truck as they did for cars, that's why there are two CAFE
standards. Trucks by definition are different than cars and have
different purposes. Car are only designed to carry passengers.
Trucks are designed to carry cargo and passengers. One would have
to assume they would not be built to meet the same fuel
standards. Since you seem to prefer to buy what you want and
need, why do you want to deny others the choice of buying what
they want and need? If you can't afford or don't need the larger
safer SUV type vehicle then I suggest you not buy one that suits
your particular needs.

Of course a business can take a tax deduction if they buy a
hybrid same as any other vehicle they buy for their business,
where did the idea come from that they can't? Business could
always take a deduction to lower their gross income for anything
they use in their business. They can't take the total cost in
one year however they must amortize the cost of the vehicle over
five years. They only thing the congress did, not Bush, was
allow them to take 80% of the cost of a vehicle in one year. By
doing so they lost the deduction of the remaining 20%. The
purpose was to increase the current amount of after tax money to
small business to help create jobs in the automotive industry and
in small business, apparently it worked. If the business
amortize 50K they had a deduction from income of 10K for 5 years
under the old rule under the new rule they got a deduction from
income of 40K for 2003. It was a win/win situation for the
taxpayer and the government. The taxpayer saved the tax on 80%
of the money he spent in 2003 on a vehicle and the government got
the tax on 30% more money the second year and 10% more the next
three years.

Why do the environuts fail to understand that people do not want
to BUY vehicle that get 30 MPG. If they did there are plenty of
vehicles on the market that get 30 MPG, and more, for those that
want them yet people buy vehicles that get 20 MPG. WHY? Because

"/> Personally, I'd _LOVE_ to have a vehicle that would (1) pull a 10-ton
fifth-wheel or gooseneck trailer at full [75 MPH] highway speeds up a 10%
grade with a 45 MPH headwind, (2) seat at least 6 full-size [6'3&quot;. 275 lb.
each] adults comfortably, and (3) get at least 30 MPG all at the same time.

If I have to compromise on this combination, though, it'll have to be the
fuel economy that will suffer since the first two are _NOT_ negotiable.

"/> I don't think it's that people don't WANT vehicles that get 30 mpg,
they just don't want anemic little sardine cans like the Metro or
Prius. So-called &quot;gas guzzlers&quot; (what a stupid term) sell because
they have power and are roomy. The only reason people bought
econoboxes back in the 70s was because gas prices were so high
relative to income...in 1974 dollars gas is dirt cheap today. So far
no one has been able to get size/power and fuel economy in the same
package. Sort of like tastes great/less filling.

I also resent that the enviro-nazis seem to think we should all be
forced to drive anemic sardine cans just because they don't mind doing
so. Ditto for higher gas taxes. Mass transit is fine if you live in
a large metropolitan area and don't mind adapting your schedule to the
transit schedule, pretty useless if you don't.

I agree that vehicles like Hummers are rather impractical, but who am
I to say that if someone has the money and nothing better to do with
it that they can't have one?

"/> I got a real laugh from reading that, simply because I *have*
seen what he describes. I lived a town that had more gas
stations than you could shake stick at. Every other corner had
3 or 4 gas stations. Most of them did little more than sell gas
and oil, though some perported to have a mechanic and do a
certain amount of (minor) repair work.

But then they *all* went out of business within about a 1 to 2
year period. Suddenly old gas stations were being bulldozed on
every corner, and new businesses, of various kinds sprang up in
their place.

Not very interesting, eh? Well, actually it is. That was
Tucson AZ, in early 60's and the cost of gasoline was *19 cents*
a gallon for the gas station. Mobile Oil came in and started
selling gas at 17 cents a gallon until every independant station
in town went out of business.

Mobil Oil Company (now Exxon), and other major oil companies,
were methodically doing that, area by area, all around the
country. They would select an area, and cut the price at
stations they owned to less than the wholesale price. Once the
independants were gone, they put the price back, and added a
couple pennies per gallon to pay for the cost of doing the same
deal in another area.

During the late 50's and the 1960's, the independant gas station
pretty much disappeared into the history books in most parts of
the country. And it wasn't an accident...

The reason we don't have an energy policy is the democrats in the
Senate will not support the energy policy the President has
proposed. A policy that will increase domestic production to
help reduce our dependency on other countries while encouraging
conservation, help the develop viable alternate fuels like
nuclear and hydrogen and increase the expansion of other minor
sources like wind, bio, and other renewable sources that are too
limited in their ability to supply the energy needs of the
country. Write to YOUR member of Congress and suggest he/she
support this sensible energy policy if they are one of those that
do not..

That is because current environmental laws make it nearly
impossible to build new oil refineries, oil storage or
transmission facilities in the US. It is all a result of the
pressure in the seventies from the environuts to 'export' our
polluting industries by driving their cost of production through
the roof. Like all of those that think there are simple answers
to complex question, they failed to realize the jobs would be
exported as well. We shipped the jobs of our steel mills, oil
industry, chemical, paint, tanneries, plastics and a host of
other industries to other countries, sad. Instead of providing
reasonable regulations that would set reasonable goals that would
allow industries reasonable amount time to engineer and develop
newer more efficient ways to producing their products we gave
them unattainable goals under threat of massive fines that simply
put them out of business trying to compete with foreign
manufacture that had now similar expenses. Every time the
President suggests we adopt more reasonable rules, to correct
some of the over regulation as he has with electric generating
stations, the environuts say is is favor of more pollution. What
we have in the US today is the nut are running the asylum and we
all are suffering the consequences of their folly.

Oh...the sky is falling, the sky is falling run. Nuclear waste
disposal is not a scientific problem, never has been. It is only
a political problem, NIMBY. Scientists figured out a long time
ago what to do which nuclear waste, return it to the earth from
which it came. The nuclear waste had been stored, for over 50
years and still is today, under six feet of water at the power
plant and there has never been a problem with that simple method
of storage, imagine how safe if will be under a mountain in
Nevada. As to hydrogen it will most likely come from gasoline,
where it will be converted 80% more efficiently than burning the
gasoline and pollution free to boot. The rest of the world is
relying on nuclear power, including Japan and they had bombs
dropped on them made of the stuff. You have to catch up on
modern science my boy. Talk to any US Navy sailor and see of they
are afraid of nuclear power. Every sub and carrier in the Navy
is nuclear powered.

"/> It happened here in Oregon about 15 years ago. Consolidation in
the oil business was one factor. Another factor was that a large
number of stations were found to have Leaking Underground Storage
Tanks (yes we have LUST in Oregon). Once they started tracing

they started closing all over. You can still see the abandoned
stations with the monitoring wellheads off to the side of the parking

The USGS estimates that it contains a mean expected value of 10.4
billion barrels of technically recoverable oil. To put that into
context, the potential daily production from ANWR's 1002 area is larger
than the current daily onshore oil production of any of the lower 48
states.&quot;

produces just more than one million barrels a day, California just less
than one million barrels a day and Louisiana produces slightly more than

&gt;first off a drop of 2 cents is better than an increase of the same.
&gt;the breaking of the grip of the enviro whackos who have stopped most
&gt;exploration in the US would allow other areas to be explored, finding
&gt;other areas with large reserves that would allow the US to produce
&gt;even more oil domestically, reducing the need for imported oil.

"/> Well, it that's your 2 cents worth, it is obvious that 2 cents is
worth much of anything, for either gasoline or opinions.

You might as well get used to the idea that the US doesn't have,
and is never going to find, a significantly large domestic
supply of cheap oil.

&gt;Where are you getting your guesstimates?

&gt;The USGS estimates that it contains a mean expected value of
&gt;10.4 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil. To put that

"/> Wrong numbers. Technically recoverable oil includes oil that would
cost $1000 a barrel to recover. Whipping out that number is just
nonsense.

The USGS estimate for /economically recoverable/ oil is half that!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;into context, the potential daily production from ANWR's 1002
&gt;area is larger than the current daily onshore oil production of
&gt;any of the lower 48 states.&quot;

"/> Oh, so it's bigger than (almost) nothing. Whoop dee do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;ANWR could produce nearly 1.4 million barrels of oil, while
&gt;Texas produces just more than one million barrels a day,
&gt;California just less than one million barrels a day and
&gt;Louisiana produces slightly more than 200,000 barrels a day.&quot;

"/> Who's propaganda is that? It certainly doesn't come from the
USGS!

First, the current output from the Trans-Alaska pipeline is
right at 1,000,000 barrels a day. The peak, in 1988 was just
slightly more than twice that. That includes both the massive
Prudhoe Bay field and the Kuparuk Field. Suggesting that ANWR
has more oil than those two combined are producing today, is
just simply foolishness.

It happens that Kuparuk has about the the same reserves as are
expected in all of ANWR, and today the output of Kuparuk is
running something like 200,000 bbls/day, while Prudhoe Bay is
producing just under 500,000 bbls/day.

The number that your source is (mis-)using, 1.4 million bbls a
day, is *not* for ANWR alone, it is the expected *total* output
from Alaska's North Slope if (and this is just a *huge* if)
there is twice as much oil as the USGS expects! That would be
the peak output. (The numbers are actually something like
800,000 bbls/day from ANWR and by that time the output from the
rest of the North Slope will have decreased to 600,000
bbls/day.)

But both of those numbers are virtually all bogus! There is
only a 5% chance, according to the USGS, of that much oil in
ANWR, and there are other factors which will likely keep the
TAPS volume much higher than 600,000 bbls/day for the next
decade. Those factors include exploration in NPR-A and
increased production from some of the newer fields, such a
Alpine.

You know, an equally biased view would be to suggest that all of
the oil discovered in ANWR will be just like the nearest
producing wells, only 40 miles away, in the Badami field. If
all of ANWR is just the same... the total production will be 0.
Badami's oil is so full of wax that it's to slow to pump, and
they've shut the whole thing down and moth balled it.

"/> That's a well crafted statement. Onshore Louisiana may produce only
200,000 barrels per day, but the offshore rigs in the Gulf produce
1.5 to 2 million barrels per day. Some estimates have those fields
producing 2.5M barrels per day in 2006.

http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/whatsnew/newsreal/010523a.html

I suspect it's a lot cheaper to get gulf oil to Houston refineries
than it is to get ANWR oil to West Coast refineries.

However, both the Gulf and ANWR are far below the Saudi production
of 9 to 10M barrels per day.

The right number to look for is 5.2 billion barrels, which is
the mean average between the 5% and 95% probability figures for
economically recoverable oil at $24 a barrel.

You are correct domestic oil exploration has not stopped.
The only problem is the current goofy environmental laws say you
can't drill here, or over there, or over there. If you do find
oil you can't refine it here, or over there, or over there. If
you do find a place to build a refinery, (they haven't found a
place in the past twenty five years) you can't store the oil
here, or over there, or over there. If you do find a place to
store it they can't build a pipe line to send the oil to the
storage area let alone to terminals over here or, over there, or
over there, NIMBY anyway. LOL

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What in the world ever lead you to believe that oil exploration had

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it has stopped in the US, and the US was what we were talking about,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stayed focused

&gt;&gt;US producers are still some development and exploration wells but one
&gt;&gt;problem is that a lot of the continental US is already drilled up.
&gt;&gt;There are something like 500,000 &quot;producing&quot; oil wells drilled in the
&gt;&gt;US. For some history on US drilling and production see:

&gt; it is try the most of the US is pumped out if you exclude offshore
&gt; sources, and like I've been saying, other than a few gulf rigs there
&gt; is no off shore exploration happening

It takes a lot of money to drill a well offshore. Oil companies collect
and analyze a lot of data before making a decision to drill. Right now
overseas locations look better than most offshore areas of the US.
