When enough very senior people in a Presidential administration decide
they want to implement a policy of torture, torture is generally what
happens.  That's certainly the case over the last 5 - 6 years.  It's
only been the courage and willingness of government insiders to speak
out and let the rest of the country know what's being done in their
name. - ric

In half a century of reporting
around the world, I have found that there was usually a feeling that
the United States stood for standards of liberty, human rights, and the
dignity of mankind. The Bush administration has taken us off that gold
standard and drained away much of that reservoir of respect. The
horrors of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo have eaten away at America’s
credibility and moral standing, dismaying our friends and empowering
our enemies.
Washington shuddered last week when The New
York Times revealed that
the Justice Department, under the direction of Alberto Gonzales, had
undermined the will of Congress, the Supreme Court, as well as hard-won
national and international standards with secret legal opinions
supporting torture. “Shocking” was the word Republican Senator Arlen
Specter used, and well he should.
Men and women of good will may differ on how much power the
executive branch should have, and how much of our privacy and civil
liberties need to be curtailed in an age of terrorism. As the former
deputy attorney general, James Comey, who tried to stem the tide of the
administration’s malfeasance, said: there are “agonizing collisions”
between the law and the desire to protect Americans. But no good will
can be ascribed to those who secretly sought to undermine the republic
by their underhanded advocacy of torture.
Instead of entering into an honest debate, the
administration spoke
of its “abhorrence” of torture while at the same time secretly
promoting it. Not surprisingly, the fine hand of Vice President Dick
Cheney and his counsel, David Addington, could be discerned. Despite
his bluster, President Bush, “the decider,” has turned out to be a weak
president, riddled with insecurities masked by stubbornness, who has
allowed his subordinates to gnaw away at the Constitution.
Some lawmakers, notably Senator John McCain who knows a thing or two
about torture from his years as a prisoner in Hanoi, tried to halt the
moral rot. But the secret opinions of the Justice Department found that
the Detainee Treatment Act would not force any change in torture
practices, allowing for water-boarding and all the rest to continue.
Perhaps the most demoralizing revelation was
that while the public
voice of America was urging democracy and openness on our allies Saudi
Arabia and Egypt, other Americans - with the blessing of the
administration - were going around to the cellar door to get briefed on
how best to torture prisoners. Even the interrogation methods of the
Soviet Union, which surely should have been discredited by now, were
brought into play.
Many who are familiar with interrogation say
that the kind of
violence favored by the Bush administration is unnecessary and
counterproductive. The trouble with copying the Soviet Union’s
methods
is that, often as not, the Soviet interrogators were not after reliable
information. They just wanted confessions to things they knew their
prisoners had not done in order to justify a prisoner’s eventual
execution for purely political reasons.
The trouble with torture is that a prisoner will say anything he
thinks you may want to hear. Take Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a planner of
the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. After being severely tortured he has
confessed to such a wide-ranging number of crimes as to be unbelievable.
The long-range problem with the Bush administration’s efforts to
subvert national and international bans on torture is that it hurts us
deeply in the struggle against Islamic extremism. It revolts the
conscience of the world, which makes it harder for the West to convince
Muslims that we are not the enemy of Islam. It encourages converts to
Al Qaeda. It stays the hand of moderate Muslims who may otherwise want
to cooperate with us. It undermines our international standing and our
national security.
It was Comey, considered a wimp and disloyal
by the administration
for trying to stand up against the use of torture, who said to his
Justice Department colleagues that they would be “ashamed” when the
world eventually learned of their actions.
“It takes far more than a sharp legal mind to
say ‘no’ when it
matters most,” he said. “It takes moral character. It takes an
understanding that in the long run, intelligence under law is the only
sustainable intelligence in this country.”
Alas, moral character was in short supply at a
Justice Department
where the Bush administration could always find subordinates to subvert
the rule of law.
