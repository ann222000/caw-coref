C128 boot problem - please help.

Could someone help me out?  I was recently given a C128 that has a strange
boot problem.  9/10 times the 128 failes to boot.  The screen either either
a solid color (black, purple, others?).  Sometimes there is garbage
characters flickering on the screen.  When I first turn the computer on the
1571 drive light comes on as normal but it doesn't go into it's seek mode
afterwards.  If I press the reset button then the 1571 drive's red LED
light's up for a split second then goes out.

On the few times that it does boot the system behaves normally.  I have run
some programs on it.  Occasionally when the system is running it will
crash.  However, I have run it for about 5 minutes (C128 demo) without
crashing.  I sometimes move the unit around and the problem comes and goes
which may indicate a loose connection or cold/broken solder joint.  However
it is very hard to pin down if this is actually what is going on because it
is not repeatable.

I have tried the following:
- reseat all socketed IC's.
- resoldered PS connector on motherboard.
- checked fuses and voltage levels on PS (5.2VDC and 10.2 AC).

Any idea what could be wrong?  Anything else I should try?

Thanks
Marco

Make sure your monitor is in 80 column mode AND that the 40/80 DISPLAY
key in the very top row is depressed.  OR be sure that the monitor is
in 40 column mode AND that the same 40/80 DISPLAY key is released.

Open the plug on the power supply and resolder each pin.  Could be a cold
solder joint there.

Marco,
See if the paddle of the power switch is binding on the C128 case. I've
seen a few of them that would not allow the switch to fully engage. If it is
binding, you can trim the plastic around the switch to free it up. If that's
not the problem, try switching the computer on and -then- connecting the PS to
the AC outlet. If that works reliably, the switch may be intermittant inside
and if so, should be replaced. Next, wiggle the power connector while the
computer is running to check for glitches. The power socket itself may be
intermittant. The pins inside the socket eventually get loose and don't make
good contact. They can be tightened with a straight pin by gently prying each
side inward a bit, if that's the problem. Mechanical intermittants can be
really frustrating but usually point to bad connections as you indicated.
Flexing and tapping on the board around suspected problem areas is the best
way to make such intermittants show up. Good hunting!

Has anyone mentioned the obvious?  Commodore power supplies themselves
were notorious for failing.   I've seen several that they electrloytic
caps have gone bad after all these years.  I had a 1581 power supply
that actually output 5V and 12V just fine under no load.  But once
plugged into the 1581, I re-measured and got 2.9V and 10V.   I
replaced the caps inside the power supply and it worked again.

Also, some other troubleshooting steps.  Can you boot to C64 mode
reliably, by holding down the commodore key when powering on?  If it
is a C128D, be carefull of printer adapters that connect to the
cassette port for power.  many were not designed for the metal case
and will short circuit on a 128D.

Does the problem go away when other peripherals (such as the disk
drive) are removed?

Thank you to everyone who has replied.  I verified the PS voltages with the
C128 powered on.  Both when it functions and when it doesn't, the voltages
are in spec.  I even checked the output of the 12V regulator and it is fine
too.

I am running the 128 in 40 column mode with only the 1571 drive and 1902A
monitor attached.  No other peripherals are hooked up.  I can continuously
toggle the on/off switch and every once in a while the C128 boots fine.
Once I pressed the reset button and it booted fine too.  I have wiggled the
power supply cord (near inlet of C128) after it boots correctly and it
doesn't seem to crash the computer.  What I have discovered is that gentle
taps on the center of PCB seems to crash (after a good boot) the computer
rather easily.  At first I thought that perhaps the bottom of the PCB was
touching some part of the metal plate underneath the board so I removed it
from the enclosure (and metal plate).  Again, gentle taps to various parts
of the PCB would crash (garbage on screen or lockup after good boot) the
computer.  It seems most sensitive towards the middle of the PCB.

To reset the crash I power cycle with the main switch.  Occasionally it
boots well immediately.  After several unsuccessful boots I apply a little
pressure to the PCB (by gently bending by a couple degrees on the ends of
the PCB) and it tends to boot immediately afterward.

Conclusion... probably a broken solder connection on an IC pin or a broken
trace due to abuse of 128 by previous owner.  Could have been caused by
bending of enclosure by placing something heavy on C128 or packaged unit
while one of of C128/package resting on something.  What do you think?
This is going to be a pain to find.

Thanks again for the help.

I've experienced the same problem myself. Ultimate fix is to change the
power switch, but it could be just a bad solder joint on the switch it's
self. You *could* have micro-fractures on the board as well, but those
can be really painful to locate... I hope it is just a bummed switch.

Hmm..  Might not be a bad idea to just take the soldering iron and re-
heat every solder joint.  Unfortuantly, if the little copper trace has
come dislodged from the board, then you are out of luck.  However,
cold solder joints were not that uncommon on Commodore equipment.

Marco,
Two other things come to mind... you said you reseated all the socketed
chips, but did you remove, then reinsert all of them? One may have a bent pin
that is barely making contact. If any of the sockets were not from the factory,
the board traces or that socket may be bad. One other problem I had once was
distorted pins in the cartridge port. Two pins were touching intermittantly, and
flexing the main board made it work... sometimes. Examine that area carefully
under strong light to see if there is any debris (metal) or bent contacts that
may be shorting together. Other than loose solder connections at the power
connector and other ports, I've seen very few actual problems with solder on
Commodore computer boards. They were built very well. Monitors... that's a
different story. :-P

Unless toggling the on/off switch causes the PCB to bend, the biggest
part of your problem seems to be a bad switch.  I would recommend
replacing that before messing with the PCB.

Thank you again to everyone who offered advise.  I found the problem... bad
solder joint on a pin on U11 (PLA).

The way I found the problem is that I noticed that gentle taps on the PCB
after a good boot would crash the computer.  It was most sensitive around
the bottom middle of the board.  It took about 3 hours of resoldering many
chips (trying each time in between) until I finally stumbled on the
culprit.  It's like night and day.  Previously after a good boot the board
could be crashed by slight movements/jars.  Now I can (gently) felx the PCB
and drop it.  Also (more importantly) it boots everytime now.

I guess I found that one board with the most unlikely of failures.  Now to
figure out what to do with the computer.  My wife is already telling me to
get rid of it.  She won't win this time.  Thanks again.

Marco

Good sleuthing, Marco.  Was there any visible evidence when you got to the
bad joint?  I usually scan for the telltale concentric crack around the
