folks,
saddle up to the bar and order the drink of your choice as long as it is
a well, this may be a long session and i don't know if i can afford
premiums.

i built myself a set of home made oil coolers for my '78 FLH with a h-d
silver and chrome Evo motor shoehorned into it.  photos of the oil coolers
are posted across the street.  i have been doing some temperature testing
and am now wondering if i am cooling my oil too much.  these are built out
of aluminum and were cut on my cad/cam router.  i think they look pretty
cool and they are cooling the oil.  but how much cooling is too much?

today we went for about a 150 mile ride.  the ambient air temperature was
hovering around 64 degrees F.  when we would come to a stop at a stop sign
or red light i would take a couple of quick temperature readings.  the oil
coming in to the coolers is averaging about 115 degrees F.  the outgoing oil
from the coolers is measuring 85 degrees F.  the oil in the oil tank is
hovering about 115 degrees when rolling at a fair speed.

when we stop the bikes and i let the bike sit idleing for about five minutes
the oil tank temp goes up to about 125 degrees and the difference from the
inlet and outlet of the oil coolers is only about 10 degrees.  130 going in
and 120 coming out.

these numbers seem pretty significant when comparing them to the oil temps
from the shovelhead.  rolling down the road it runs on the high side of 150
at the oil tank.  about 155 going into a store bought aftermarket cooler and
about 148 coming out.  (oh yeah, same ambient air temp).

these are the only measurements i have taken in my experimentation thus far.
on the next ride i am going to work at recording crankcase temps, cylinder
temps, head temps and exhaust temps.  does anyone in the bar know what the
recommended temperature range for different parts of the motor should be.  i
know that too cool can be just as bad as too hot.  i would assume that if
the engine does not get to a high enough temperature for everything to
expand to what the engineers have designed it to then there may be some
goofey wear issues.

aluminum, steel and other components expand at different rates and i assume
that even harley's engineers take this into account and design stuff to work
within a specific temperature range.  i don't want to kill my motor by over
cooling it with my home made oil coolers.  ya'll feel free to take me to
school and if you give me some really good sounding answers i may even get

I would guess one problem about excessively low temperatures is that you
would not drive any moisture which might accumulate out of the oil (sitting
idle in garage, etc.). I would also guess that low temps might require a
slightly richer mixture (cold start - choke on?) for better running.

Ok, this is from memory &amp; it's an old memory unit so you get what you
pay for...........
Sounds low to me.  Memory wants to get into the 200 deg. range, but I
won't guarantee the accuracy of that.  There is a test that'll tell you more
though.
Harley's don't really need oil coolers.  They work fine without 'em
except in the *worst* of conditions.  Easy way to see what the manufacturer had
in mind for operating temps is to cover up the cooler &amp; go for a ride.  Run it
like you stole it, then take a look at the temp reading.  Do that in 40 to 60
deg. weather, &amp; again in 90 to 110 deg. weather.  That should give you a set of
parameters, &amp; won't hurt the bike.
Coolin' that oil too much will work your pump harder, reduce your gas
milage, &amp; may prevent oil from gettin' in those tight tolerance spots.  The last
is the biggest problem for motor life.

There are dozens of thermostats for oil coolers, here is a link to one that
looks like it would suit your application just fine.

HD also sells one, but it is kinda spendy, and funky looking as well.

Here is what I have. This is a quote from someone else. My self, I use a
thermostat on mine.

FYI, the 212 degree figure was related to me by engineers from Harley
who put on a symposium on just this topic during Daytona. Their opinion is
that
an oil tank temperature of between 175-195 correlates to a crankcase
temperature of around 220+ which is sufficient for this process if achieved
and
maintained for a reasonable amount of time.

Add 10% to what you see at your oil dip stick gauge. The oil MUST hit 180 or
so to burn off contaminants and moisture that form and gather when your bike
rests after a good ride.

&gt; hmm I really should stop by and see the place, I am having a heck of a
&gt; time getting a small job farmed out, just maybe you know the right
&gt; folks that will do small jobs!
">

i have a 4" z axis by 50" x axis by 100" y axis cad/cam router in house.  i
can even do full 3-d work such as carvings of people using my artcam pro
software.  it will cut wood, acrylic, plastic, styrofoam, high density
urethane foam, brass, bronze and aluminum.  this year the goal is to add on
to the shop so we will have room for another router that will be 8" z by 64"
y by 144" x and will be robust enough to cut carbon and stainless steel.
also looking a a cnc horizontal milling machine but have not made the
decision on it yet.

i have a 3 foot floor model metal shear, lots of hand held metal cutting
stuff, two mig welders and am set up for welding carbon steel, stainless
steel and aluminum.  have access to a tig just down the street.  there is an
8' metal brake in-house and all types of other sundry and assorted metal
working gadgets.

i have a 100 lb sandblaster and a 3 phase 28 hp air compressor to feed it
plenty of air.  i have a full woodworking set up also.  delta unisaw,
shaper, jointer, miter boxes, biscuit joiners, blah, blah, blah.

i do all of my own paint work.  the '78 that i have posted photos of across
the street was painted in house.  we spray our paint through binks and sata
guns.  we do in house screen printing and thermal digital printing.  if you
have a special decal you need i can print them in any amount from one-offs
to the thousands.  if you have a special resto project that you can't find
the right decal for i'll knock it off, if you can show me what it is
supposed to look like.

i still lay gold and silver leaf.  i lay a mean gold job.  when i can talk
my dad into it he will still come over and do hand lettering and
pinstriping.  he taught me the hand painting work but i don't do enough of
it to keep my skills honed.  i can make a good stab at pinstriping but i
would rather let someone else do it.  i have to do it two or three times
before i am happy with it.  now days i usually just cut a computer designed
mask and spray this kind of work.

in my spare time i restore bicycles, horse drawn farm equipment, antique
tractors, motorcycles and hotrods.  a lot of the stuff i do in-house and the
stuff i am smart enough not to fool with i know who to send it to.

i am actually so busy with my real work (signs) that we have a 30 day
minimum on most work and some of our bigger custom stuff is on a three to
six month waiting list.  but that said, i can work in stuff for scooter
trash, tractor folk, and hotroders if it looks fun to build.  i make a lot
of billet aluminum parts for hotrods and excel at making instrument panels.
if any of ya'll out there need that special something that you can't seem to
get built anywhere else send up a flare and i'll put you in the que.  the
more fun it is to build the less i charge.  most of my day to day work is
boring but pays well so when it is something fun the motivation is more in
the doing than the money.  enough spray about what we do here but now you
know.

Yes. that's too cool.  Is is designed to operate in
a range.  It has to get up to a certain temperature for
it to maintain it's designed viscosity, and for the
additive package to work correctly.  180* is generally
accepted as the minimum.

Some people think it has to be above 200* or 220*  to
evaporate water.  That's just not true.  If it were,
the water would never evaporate off the kitchen floor.

Every street machine with an oil cooler should have a
thermostat.

You could use a manual bypass valve.  But you have to
be sure and turn it on BEFORE you start the engine.
Once the oil in the engine is hot, you can't just open
the valve.  Then engine will get a sudden slug of cold
heavy thick oil.  Bad things can happen.

&gt;&gt; hmm I really should stop by and see the place, I am having a heck of a
&gt;&gt; time getting a small job farmed out, just maybe you know the right
&gt;&gt; folks that will do small jobs!

&gt;i have a 4&quot; z axis by 50&quot; x axis by 100&quot; y axis cad/cam router in house.  i
&gt;can even do full 3-d work such as carvings of people using my artcam pro
&gt;software.  it will cut wood, acrylic, plastic, styrofoam, high density
&gt;urethane foam, brass, bronze and aluminum.  this year the goal is to add on
&gt;to the shop so we will have room for another router that will be 8&quot; z by 64&quot;
&gt;y by 144&quot; x and will be robust enough to cut carbon and stainless steel.
&gt;also looking a a cnc horizontal milling machine but have not made the
&gt;decision on it yet.

&gt;i have a 3 foot floor model metal shear, lots of hand held metal cutting
&gt;stuff, two mig welders and am set up for welding carbon steel, stainless
&gt;steel and aluminum.  have access to a tig just down the street.  there is an
&gt;8' metal brake in-house and all types of other sundry and assorted metal
&gt;working gadgets.

&gt;i have a 100 lb sandblaster and a 3 phase 28 hp air compressor to feed it
&gt;plenty of air.  i have a full woodworking set up also.  delta unisaw,
&gt;shaper, jointer, miter boxes, biscuit joiners, blah, blah, blah.

&gt;i do all of my own paint work.  the '78 that i have posted photos of across
&gt;the street was painted in house.  we spray our paint through binks and sata
&gt;guns.  we do in house screen printing and thermal digital printing.  if you
&gt;have a special decal you need i can print them in any amount from one-offs
&gt;to the thousands.  if you have a special resto project that you can't find
&gt;the right decal for i'll knock it off, if you can show me what it is
&gt;supposed to look like.

&gt;i still lay gold and silver leaf.  i lay a mean gold job.  when i can talk
&gt;my dad into it he will still come over and do hand lettering and
&gt;pinstriping.  he taught me the hand painting work but i don't do enough of
&gt;it to keep my skills honed.  i can make a good stab at pinstriping but i
&gt;would rather let someone else do it.  i have to do it two or three times
&gt;before i am happy with it.  now days i usually just cut a computer designed
&gt;mask and spray this kind of work.

&gt;in my spare time i restore bicycles, horse drawn farm equipment, antique
&gt;tractors, motorcycles and hotrods.  a lot of the stuff i do in-house and the
&gt;stuff i am smart enough not to fool with i know who to send it to.

&gt;i am actually so busy with my real work (signs) that we have a 30 day
&gt;minimum on most work and some of our bigger custom stuff is on a three to
&gt;six month waiting list.  but that said, i can work in stuff for scooter
&gt;trash, tractor folk, and hotroders if it looks fun to build.  i make a lot
&gt;of billet aluminum parts for hotrods and excel at making instrument panels.
&gt;if any of ya'll out there need that special something that you can't seem to
&gt;get built anywhere else send up a flare and i'll put you in the que.  the
&gt;more fun it is to build the less i charge.  most of my day to day work is
&gt;boring but pays well so when it is something fun the motivation is more in
&gt;the doing than the money.  enough spray about what we do here but now you
&gt;know.

If your numbers are correct you are running too cool.  You've got to
get up over 180 to get rid of water vapor and probably to make your
engine run as it should.  As Jinks pointed out, 180 to 200 would be
really good.  I'd bypass it or cover it during these cool months and
wait until the hottest time of year to see how it performs.

I just installed a Jagg system on my scoot and it has a 180deg
thermostat incorporated into it.  That's their standard thermostat.

&gt;&gt;&gt; afford premiums.

&gt;&gt;&gt; i built myself a set of home made oil coolers for my '78 FLH with a
&gt;&gt;&gt; h-d silver and chrome Evo motor shoehorned into it.  photos of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; oil coolers are posted across the street.  i have been doing some
&gt;&gt;&gt; temperature testing and am now wondering if i am cooling my oil too
&gt;&gt;&gt; much.  these are built out of aluminum and were cut on my cad/cam
&gt;&gt;&gt; router.  i think they look pretty cool and they are cooling the
&gt;&gt;&gt; oil. but how much cooling is too much?
&gt;&gt;&gt; today we went for about a 150 mile ride.  the ambient air
&gt;&gt;&gt; temperature was hovering around 64 degrees F.  when we would come
&gt;&gt;&gt; to a stop at a stop sign or red light i would take a couple of
&gt;&gt;&gt; quick temperature readings.  the oil coming in to the coolers is
&gt;&gt;&gt; averaging about 115 degrees F.  the outgoing oil from the coolers
&gt;&gt;&gt; is measuring 85 degrees F.  the oil in the oil tank is hovering
&gt;&gt;&gt; about 115 degrees when rolling at a fair speed.
&gt;&gt;&gt; when we stop the bikes and i let the bike sit idleing for about five
&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes the oil tank temp goes up to about 125 degrees and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; difference from the inlet and outlet of the oil coolers is only
&gt;&gt;&gt; about 10 degrees.  130 going in and 120 coming out.

&gt;&gt;&gt; these numbers seem pretty significant when comparing them to the oil
&gt;&gt;&gt; temps from the shovelhead.  rolling down the road it runs on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; high side of 150 at the oil tank.  about 155 going into a store
&gt;&gt;&gt; bought aftermarket cooler and about 148 coming out.  (oh yeah, same
&gt;&gt;&gt; ambient air temp).
&gt;&gt;&gt; these are the only measurements i have taken in my experimentation
&gt;&gt;&gt; thus far. on the next ride i am going to work at recording crankcase
&gt;&gt;&gt; temps, cylinder temps, head temps and exhaust temps.  does anyone in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the bar know what the recommended temperature range for different
&gt;&gt;&gt; parts of the motor should be.  i know that too cool can be just as
&gt;&gt;&gt; bad as too hot.  i would assume that if the engine does not get to a
&gt;&gt;&gt; high enough temperature for everything to expand to what the
&gt;&gt;&gt; engineers have designed it to then there may be some goofey wear
&gt;&gt;&gt; issues.
&gt;&gt;&gt; aluminum, steel and other components expand at different rates and i
&gt;&gt;&gt; assume that even harley's engineers take this into account and
&gt;&gt;&gt; design stuff to work within a specific temperature range.  i don't

I couldn't offer any proof at this time of the morning, but IIRC the optimum
oil temps for an air cooled engine should be between 190 and 230 F.
Anything below will not be hot enough for moisture to cook off.  Anything
higher and the oil viscosity starts to break down.
In most cases, an oil cooler isn't needed until the ambient temps get into
the 90's and/or you are in slow moving traffic.  Too slow and the cooler
becomes a moot point.
Nonetheless, nice job on the coolers, but you may want to consider
installing a thermostat controlled bypass.

the oil gets considerably hotter in the engine, compared to
the oil tank,
and should burn off the moister.
least it does in mine.
my oil stays a lot cooler in my oil tank.

No. Sort of.

Water evaporates at anything above 32*.  The lower
the temp, the longer it takes.  It does not have to get
to 190* to evaporate.  Otherwise your kitchen floor
would never be dry.  Where does this mis-information
come from?  Probably the same knuckelheads who invented
global warming.

Air cooled or not, engine oil has an optimum
operating range; 190-220* is about right depending on
the oil.   Higher temperatures cause the oil to break
down sooner.  Some oils can withstand the higher temps
better/longer, but will still break down.  A good
synthetic oil will run at 250* all day long without harm.

Probably not any more than you're claiming that the way to rid your
engine of moisture accumulation in the oil during the winter is to
take lots of short trips, making sure that your engine oil gets up to
at least 32 degrees, at which point any water in your oil will
evaporate.

&gt;    Yes. that's too cool.  Is is designed to operate in a range.  It has to

&gt; That's just not true.  If it were, the water would never evaporate off the

&gt;  Every street machine with an oil cooler should have a thermostat.

&gt; You could use a manual bypass valve.  But you have to be sure and turn it
&gt; on BEFORE you start the engine. Once the oil in the engine is hot, you
&gt; can't just open the valve.  Then engine will get a sudden slug of cold

i am researching an automatic thermostat today.  when i decide which one
suits my needs the best i am going to get it ordered.  i imagine when the
georgia hot sun starts cooking us this summer i'll be glad that i have so
much cooling capacity.  as i am learning more i think keeping my oil in the
175 to 200 degree F range should suit my purposes.  the '07 road king
operates at much higher temps and can be miserable on a hot day although we
have cooled it significantly over what it originally was.

i started to make the fins 0.125" thick instead of 0.250" whick would have
doubled my amount of cooling surface.  that would have really put the oil in
the deep freeze.  that is my plan for this summer if these don't keep it as
cool as i want.  anyone have recommended head/cylinder/crankcase/exhaust
temperatures?  i would like this info for my shovel and twinkie along with
my evo.  i really enjoy pointing my non contact thermo at stuff and nodding

Bzzzzt! Wrong answer Bill. Water 'evaporates' at temps above 32° F.
Water 'sublimates' at temps of 32° F. and below.
Evaporation is the process of a liquid passing to a gaseous state.
Sublimation is the process of a solid passing to a gaseous state.
Pedantry is an undue display of learning.

Some nice pics there.  I stole one of the orange Superbird for this

i actually have so many car photos that i may never get them all posted.
between all of the year one events, mopar meets, barrett-jacksons and many
smaller shows i have literaly thousands and thousands of photos.  same with
climbing, skiing, motorcycles, bicycles, tractors and all that other stuff i
am working on.  i add to sections as the mood stikes and build new sections
occassionally.  the website is pushing 600 total pages at present and more
keep getting added.  right now i have about 2,000 pages laid out in my flow
chart.  if i live long enough to get everything done i want then it should
be a nice place for folks to wander about and kill some time.

submit all the photos you want and i'll eventually get them posted.
sometimes it takes a while but i try to be fairly prompt when someone goes
to the trouble to send me something.

I think you underestimate...there's a bunch o' gearheads in this

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;i know that too cool can be just as bad as too hot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;you want an oil temp of 200 degrees from time to time to get rid of moisture
&gt;&gt;&gt;accumulation.

&gt;&gt;    So.... you're saying moisture won't evaporate at
&gt;&gt;anything less than 200*?

&gt; Probably not any more than you're claiming that the way to rid your
&gt; engine of moisture accumulation in the oil during the winter is to
&gt; take lots of short trips, making sure that your engine oil gets up to
&gt; at least 32 degrees, at which point any water in your oil will
&gt; evaporate.
">

I didn't claim anything.  You did.  Saying that
"the way to get rid your engine of moisture
accumulation is to take lots of short trips" is just
absurd.  Nobody who knows anything about engines would
ever make that claim.
Evaporation is mostly a function of heat and
time.  Mostly.  Water will evaporate at 50*.  It just
takes a lot longer.
If you're riding in the winter, and the oil temp
never gets above 120*, water will still evaporate.  It
just takes longer.  Meaning that you have to ride
longer (Oh, darn!).
