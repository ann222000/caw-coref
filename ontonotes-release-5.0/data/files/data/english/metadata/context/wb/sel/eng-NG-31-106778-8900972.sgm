Here American, is America.  Here are the people YOU American xtian, are
forced to help as they destroy Israel.  And American, I know that not much
means much to you, but here, perhaps this will mean something to you.  You
American, join the rest of the world and help the cowards of islam that call
satan their god, desecrate the Holy Temple Mount.

Christian America is against Israel, and is against the people Israel.
America is against the G-d, Who Is the G-d of Israel.  And you wonder why in
the hell it is that the christians have ZERO credibility.

Aren't we proud to be Americans.  Because America, with no protest from the
American people, or from the American xtians, is against fully, in every way
imaginable, all that is Holy and Good in Israel.  And they all ride the
coattails of the evil character of this generation, George Bush, as he
destroys Israel, peace, and freedom.  All with the &quot;silent help&quot; of American
xtians.  The Nazi's album is skipping I think.  I have heard that every
other generation of men, raises their hands against G-d as the Babylonians
did thousands of years ago.  And I only live a couple of generations, so I
only get to see one.  Bush is frankly not that intelligent, so he is totally
unaware of most of reality.  He can't see it.  And frankly, without the help
of Hashem, no one can.

(Or, that used to be true. Today is seems that the Americans can see how bad
Bush really is.  How evil and devilish a character Bush is. As a result,
American media has seems to have become less free.  It 'seems' that they are
gleefully using the government as an excuse to not report the truth to the
Americans about the World War the cowards of islam have launched.  But now
it seems that the Americans are beginning to see despite Bush's effort to
cover up every terrorist attack in America.  Now it seems that everyone
sees.  American media is a lot less free, and is pretty much doing what it
can to quash freedom by not reporting the truth, and trying to get people
fired up against anyone that does not tow the line..  It seems that many
Americans are beginning to see that they are considered as nothing more than
'truly dumb' tools that are being so easily 'used' by this administration.

Is this all  bad?  No, in a way it is not.  Watching American media has
become so much like watching cartoons.  Fox News seems to do all they can to
make Fox News' shows, into some kind of dumb episodes of Laurel and Hardy.
The muslims who now own Fox News, LOVE that.  I knew that was one of the
things the Saudis would do to destroy Fox.  Plus, they were going to go to
the corners of Hollywood and get as many of those girls on air with Fox.
They did that almost overnight.  You see, the muslims Bush supports HATE
women and think they are all stupid.  So when they are on the news, muslims
think that no one pays attention.  So here in America, We get the privilege
of watching the ultra liberal president of America who dresses in
conservative drag to play Americans, getting serviced on what  we call Bart
Simpson's &quot;Fox News&quot;.  It very, very, very much seems that Fox News, which
Bush owns through his Saudi Boyfriends, the evil, anti-Semitic,
anti-American, ANTI-ISRAEL. and anti-ANYTHING to do with any god other then
the worm god of islam, the pagan moon god called &quot;allah&quot;. (Whew!  Gotta
catch my breath after that good and LONG sentence!  LOL) )

1. On PA TV, All of Israel to be Replaced by 'Palestine'

by Hillel Fendel

Even as Palestinian Authority chief Mahmoud Abbas declares his demand for
&quot;only&quot; all 6,205 kilometers of Judea, Samaria and Gaza, his official TV
station shows a PA flag covering all of Israel.

Palestinian Media Watch (PMW), a media watchdog group that monitors the
media in the Palestinian Authority, reports on a clip broadcast by
Fatah-controlled Palestinian television this week.  The clip shows a map in
which Israel, in its entirety, is painted in the colors of the Palestinian
flag - black, white, red and green.  The message is that the PA strives to
replace all of Israel, and not just Judea, Samaria and Gaza.

A PA map that &quot;wipes out&quot; the Jewish State

6735DBD637488.htm&gt; , Oct. '07)

Itamar Marcus and Barbara Crook of PMW write that the broadcast of the map
at this particular time renders the matter of even greater concern.  &quot;As
preparations for the American peace conference continue,&quot; they write, &quot;the
leaders of the Palestinian Authority have announced their demands for a
future Palestinian state with an area of 6205 square kilometers. This would
include the Gaza Strip, the West Bank [Judea and Samaria - ed.] and
[eastern] Jerusalem. However, the message they have conveyed to their people
for years, and continue to convey on the eve of the conference, is that
'Palestine' exists and it replaces all of Israel.&quot;

As documented by PMW for many years, the idea of turning Israel into an
Arab-Palestinian state is part of a formal educational approach throughout
the Palestinian Authority. &quot;The picture painted for the Palestinian
population, both verbally and visually, is of a world without Israel,&quot; PMW
writes. &quot;This uniform message of a world without Israel is repeated in
school books, children's programs, crossword puzzles, video clips, formal
symbols, school and street names, etc.&quot;

Street names in the PA have been changed to memorialize terrorists, for
instance, and PA textbooks regularly include references to the &quot;Israel is
Palestine&quot; canard.  For instance, a 12th-grade literature book states,
&quot;Palestine's war ended with a catastrophe that is unprecedented in history,
when the Zionist gangs stole Palestine and expelled its people from their
cities, their villages, their lands and their houses, and established the
State of Israel.&quot; [Arabic Language, Analysis, Literature and Criticism,
grade 12, p. 104

Crossword puzzles in the official PA newspaper, Al Hayat al Jadida, have
included clues such as &quot;A Palestinian city&quot; - with the proper answer being,
in various places, Haifa, Lod, and Ashkelon; all three, of course, are
present-day Israeli cities within the pre-1967 borders.  Another clue calls
Yad Vashem Holocaust Center a &quot;Jewish Center for eternalizing the Holocaust
and the lies.&quot;  Other crossword puzzle examples can be seen here

2. Knesset Majority: 'Don't Divide Jerusalem!'

by Hana Levi Julian

More than half of Knesset Members from both the opposition and the coalition
factions have signed a petition against plans to hand over parts of
Jerusalem to the Palestinian Authority.

The document rejects plans to relinquish Israel's sovereignty over holy
sites in the Old City and the City of David, just outside the Old City
walls, as well as possible intentions to give eastern Jerusalem's Arab
neighborhoods to the PA.

Likud MK Yisrael Katz and other Likud MKs spearheaded the drive, and they
were quickly joined by nearly 30 coalition MKs, including thirteen members
of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's own Kadima party and all of Shas.

Two Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel Our Home) MKs, David Rotem and Esterina
Tartman, signed the petition, as did Yoram Marciano of Labor - the only
Labor MK to do so.  Four ministers also signed the petition, including
Yaakov Edry and Ze'ev Boim of the Kadima party, and two others from the Gil
Pensioners' party.

&quot;It is possible that Olmert could divide Jerusalem
&lt; http://trailer.web-view.net/Links/0X23C1A2B60E9BD085653555D802EC59BF8...

6735DBD637488.htm&gt;  and we would have to face that reality, but it's
illegitimate, especially since he's putting Jerusalem on the agenda to
distract from his other problems,&quot; said Likud MK Reuven Rivlin.

Olmert: Knesset Not Necessary
The prime minister asserted earlier this month that he does not need the
Knesset

6735DBD637488.htm&gt; 's approval to reach a joint declaration with Palestinian
Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, including one that might include an
agreement to hand over parts of Jerusalem to the PA. He has said that
Jerusalem is not currently on the negotiating table, but several plans to
divide the capital have emerged from Olmert's close associates.

Prime Minister Olmert denied reports earlier in the week that his government
planned to give away parts of the sacred capital, but avoided specifically
defining the city limits, giving rise to speculation that he indeed intends
to give up Israel's control over some of Jerusalem.

Summit Still Not Certain
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said she would meet again today (Friday) with
PA negotiators in an attempt to come to a pre-summit agreement.  Abbas said
this week that the PA's participation in the US-sponsored summit was not a
certainty, and that the PA would not retreat from its demands for a joint
detailed pre-summit declaration with Israel.  Israel insists on only a
general declaration, with details to be ironed out later.

3. University Heads Repeal Strike Threat - But Not Professors

by Hillel Fendel and Hana Levi Julian

With the threat of a university strike looming only three days away - this
Sunday - Finance Ministry officials and university heads managed to reach a
compromise late Thursday night, and the universities will, in fact, be open.
However, the Professors Union is still holding out for increased wages, and
it is possible that the teachers will not show up for classes on the first
day of the new semester.

The Committee of University Presidents had said it would shut down the
campuses and delay the opening of the school year if the Finance Ministry
did not come through with an additional 300 million shekels.  In the end,
they agreed to accept 150 million shekels, with a possible 50 million more
in the future.

Representatives of the professors were to convene on Friday to decide if to
accept an offer to hold off on a strike while negotiations continue in
parallel.  The lecturers have been working without a collective wage
agreement for the past six years.

University studies face a threat from a third direction as well, with
students threatening to resume their own strike if the decision is made to
increase tuition by 70%.  The increase is one of the controversial Shochat
Committee reforms, and is set to be approved this coming January.

High School Teachers' Walkout Enters Second Week
Meanwhile, high schools students across the country continue to be locked
out of the classrooms by striking teachers, who are protesting the lack of a
wage agreement with the government.  A meeting on Thursday evening between
government officials and teachers' representatives was termed &quot;positive,&quot;
but led to no practical results.

The strike entered its second week on Wednesday, with teachers in the Arab
sector joining the walkout. Schools in the Arab sector had not been closed
earlier in respect for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ended last
Friday.

Schools in Sderot and other Gaza belt communities have been exempted from
the strike, due to security concerns. Parents and teachers alike appealed to
union officials not to close the schools, explaining the children were safer
in the classrooms than out on the street where they could be exposed to
Kassam rocket attacks.

Secondary School Teachers Association head Ron Erez says the teachers are
demanding a 15% wage hike - reduced from their original demand for a 20% pay
raise - as well as an improvement in working conditions. Talks with the
Finance and Education ministries have continued off and on for weeks, with
little progress.  Officials are not optimistic about the chances of the
strike ending any time soon.

Rabbi Cherlow: The Public Must Back the Teachers
Rabbi Yuval Cherlow, head of the Petach Tikvah Yeshivat Hesder, told
Arutz-7's Hebrew newsmagazine on Thursday that the strike must be seen not
only as a struggle for money, but &quot;as an attempt to increase the level of
education in Israel.&quot;

A founding member of the Tzohar Rabbis Organization, the rabbi said that the
strike is designed to &quot;encourage excellence among the teachers, improve
teaching conditions and education, and the like.  In the end, this will
benefit the entire Israeli public, and not just the teachers.  Therefore,
the entire public must support the teachers in their demands.&quot;

Regarding the Torah obligation not to call of Torah studies, Rabbi Cherlow
said, &quot;This is a problem that occupies the religious teachers every day.  I
propose an arrangement whereby the teachers will teach material that is not
part of the matriculation curriculum, so that they will not hurt the strike
but will also not cause bitul Torah [the abrogation of Torah study].&quot;

Haifa Open Facilities for High School Students During Strike
The city of Haifa has decided to take steps to ensure its 20,000 high school
students are not left to wander the streets in the absence of daily lessons.
Using teachers from the non-striking Histadrut Teachers Union, it is trying
to arrange regular studies for the minority of students who appear willing
to come - though not with great success.  The teachers explain that they are
not strike-breaking, but protesting statements made by Erez against Haifa's
educational system.

Haifa Mayor Yona Yahav told reporters, &quot;We will not leave the children
outside to hang around all day.&quot;  Erez said that Yahav was :slapping the
teachers in the face and spitting in their faces at the same time.&quot;

4. PM Olmert, Pres. Putin Meet for Three Hours

by Nissan Ratzlav-Katz

Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Russian President Vladimir Putin met
privately for three hours in Moscow on Thursday evening. At the conclusion
of the meeting, which had not been publicly announced prior to Olmert's
abrupt departure for the Russian capital earlier that day, the Prime
Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian Authority negotiations were priority items.
Minister's Office (PMO) released a statement saying that the talks were
&quot;held in an open, serious and good atmosphere....&quot;

According to the PMO and the official Russian news agency, TASS, the issues
of Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian Authority negotiations were priority
items on the leaders' agenda. However, the PMO added that they also
discussed bilateral issues and the need to confront global terrorism. TASS
said that Olmert and Putin agreed there are &quot;good prospects for development&quot;
of bilateral relations between Russia and Israel, while Israeli sources
noted that they would &quot;remain in close contact in order to advance the two
countries' mutual interests.&quot;

In discussing the role of Russia in the Middle East, Putin reportedly made
it clear that his country views Israel's security interests as a significant
component of its regional policies.

Regarding Iran's development of a nuclear arsenal, Prime Minister Olmert
reiterated for President Putin Israel's stance that an Iran with nuclear
weapons poses a threat to international peace. Olmert emphasized the
important role of the steps being currently pursued in the matter, such as
international sanctions. Those efforts, he said, have led to a halt in
Iran's enrichment of uranium.

For his part, the Russian leader tried to ease Israel's concerns over Iran's
development of nuclear power. &quot;We know how much you are worried by Iran's
nuclear program,&quot; Putin told Prime Minister Olmert.

The Moscow meeting came on the heels of the Russian President's visit to
Tehran earlier this week, during which he attended a summit of Caspian Sea
nations - Russia, Iran, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. During the
summit, Putin pledged to assist Iran to complete its Bushehr nuclear
facility, and warned against the use of force to prevent Iranian nuclear
development.

The leaders of the Caspian Sea nations in attendance agreed to bar foreign
powers from using their territory for military strikes against any other
member country. However, it was also reported that Putin suggested to
Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that Iran suspend its nuclear development
program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.

In discussing the planned international Middle East peace summit sponsored
by the United States, planned for November, Prime Minister Olmert emphasized
Israel's commitment to its success. President Putin said that Russia, which
is to play a role in the summit as a member of the Quartet, supports the
diplomatic process underway and will act to promote the success of the
Middle East talks, as well. He also commended the
&quot;Relations between Russia and Israel are developing.&quot; -- Russian President
Putin
Prime Minister on his personal efforts on the diplomatic front with the
Palestinian Authority.

During a press conference ahead of the Olmert-Putin meeting, the Prime
Minister expressed the hope that &quot;this meeting will help us reach progress
in bilateral relations.&quot; Responding, President Putin said, &quot;It will.&quot;

Noting that Olmert had visited Moscow one year ago, Putin added, &quot;I must say
that our contacts have continued. Relations between Russia and Israel are
developing both in the political and economic spheres.&quot;

In characterizing the meeting between himself and Putin, Olmert said the
talks were &quot;aimed at the strengthening of relations between Russia, a world
power, and the State of Israel.&quot;

5. Ohr Akiva and Caesarea to Merge

by Hillel Fendel

The Knesset has passed the first reading of a bill, sponsored by Eli Gabbai
of the NRP, to merge the towns of Caesarea and Ohr Akiva.  The bill passed
by a 32-4 vote, following a Cabinet decision to this effect three months
ago.  The bill must still pass two additional readings, held almost
simultaneously, in order to become law.

Caesarea is considered an upper-class beachfront resort town on the
Mediterranean, while Ohr Akiva, immediately to its east, is populated
largely by working-class strata.  They are located some ten kilometers north
of Hadera.

Caesarea is municipally run by the Ceasaria Foundation and a development
company founded by Baron de Rothschild, the only locality in Israel to be
run in this manner.  Its population is approximately 4,500, while Ohr
Akiva's is roughly 16,000.

Ceasaea was originally one of the most important Roman Empire cities, and
was later a Crusader fortress along the road from Acre to Jerusalem.  A
large Roman theater built by King Herod is still in use today for concerts
and shows.

The Interior Ministry has long had a policy of trying to reduce the number
of local councils, merging small pairs of towns into one wherever possible.
Specifically, the goal is to do away with independent entities that have
fewer than 10,000 residents.  However, most of the Ministry's suggestions
and initiatives in this regard are thwarted by local interests who oppose
the merge.

MK Gabbai (National Religious Party), the bill's sponsor, explained, &quot;The
State of Israel cannot afford to support only strong populations, and must
act to close the gaps between the various sectors.&quot;  He admitted that
property taxes in Ohr Akiva will rise in the short term, but promised a
corresponding drop later, as well as an improvement in various municipal
services.

6. Haifa Teen Indicted for Neo-Nazi Assaults, Arson and Vandalism

by Hana Levi Julian

A 19-year-old Haifa resident was indicted Thursday in connection with a
series of neo-Nazi attacks in the northern port city during the month of
September.

Tomer Ben-Simon is accused of assaulting a 77-year-old woman after first
shouting, &quot;Heil Hitler!&quot; He is charged with attacking a second woman as
well.

Ben-Simon and another perpetrator reportedly attacked the elderly woman
while she was walking on the bridge connecting the Meridian Hotel with the
Neveh David neighborhood on September 17.

The victim told police that &quot;two gang members&quot; beat her, one kicking her and
causing her injuries while the other snapped to a Nazi salute, shouting
&quot;Heil Hitler!&quot;  She finally escaped when a street sweeper stepped in to help
her. The neo-Nazi youths beat him too, according to the report.

Ben-Simon also allegedly torched a sukkah (Sukkot-holiday temporary
structure) belonging to a local synagogue, burning it to the ground. He is
also charged with scrawling swastikas on holy books and on at least one of
the synagogue's Torah scrolls. The items were found cast aside not far from
the site.

Ben-Simon also allegedly vandalized several cars in his neighborhood,
allegedly engraving or painting neo-Nazi slogans and Satanist symbols. He
reportedly engraved the name of a girl who had died in a traffic accident on
her father's car, along with various epithets.

Police found several neo-Nazi songs and other propaganda on Ben-Simon's
personal computer.  Despite initial suspicions that Ben-Simon might be
legally insane, police said he has been found fit to stand trial. The
suspected neo-Nazi is apparently Jewish and police have emphasized that his
family is not from the former Soviet Union (FSU). Many other perpetrators
arrested for neo-Nazi activity were either born in the FSU or are children
of immigrants from the region.

Other Neo-Nazi Incidents in Haifa
Haifa has been hit by a number of other neo-Nazi incidents in the past two
months. Most recently, a young man shocked post office workers when he
requested a personalized stamp with a neo-Nazi theme, taking advantage of a
special &quot;My Stamp&quot; program that allows customers to send images and a
payment to post office workers, who then create a set of personalized stamps
for the customer's use.

The young man from Haifa sent a photo of himself wearing a black shirt with
a swastika on the left sleeve, similar to the uniforms worn by the Nazi SS
during the Holocaust. Postal officials notified police and said the stamp
would not be created.

Neo-Nazi incidents have escalated across the country since the arrest of a
neo-Nazi gang in Petach Tikva in late August. All the members of the gang
were teens who were either themselves born in the former Soviet Union (FSU)
or born to parents who emigrated from there to Israel.

7. Israeli Scientists En Route to Personalized MS Medicine

by Hillel Fendel

Scientists from the Technion in Haifa, Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, and
Teva Pharmaceuticals, continuing the success of the Israeli anti-MS drug
Copaxone, may have found the way to personalize it according to one's genes.

Copaxone is widely considered the most effective treatment in preventing or
reducing relapses in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).  The drug
molecule was the fruit of research by Weizmann Institute's Prof. Michael
Sela, who later became the institute's president, and his colleagues Prof.
Ruth Arnon and Dr. Dvora Teitelbaum.  Israel's top drug company, Teva,
developed Copaxone for the treatment of the disease, and produces and
markets it in over 40 countries worldwide.

Copaxone was the first original Israeli drug to be approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA).

MS is an autoimmune disease causing impaired vision and movement disorders,
in which the body's immune system attacks proteins in the fatty layer
surrounding nerve fibers.  These attacks prevent the conductance of
electrical signals through the nerve fibers. Prof. Sela used synthetic
molecules designed by his teacher and future President of Israel, Prof.
Ephraim Katzir, to curb the attacks.

Medical treatments in general rely on trial-and-error methods to determine
the correct dosage, often leading to errors and complications along the way.
Scientists from Teva performed tests at Weizmann Institute, using Israel's
only genome-variation scanning equipment, to determine specific genetic
markers and their link with the patient's response to Copaxone.

Prof. Doron Lancet of Weizmann's Department of Molecular Genetics says, &quot;We
analyzed the DNA sequences in 27 candidate genes from each patient
participating in the trial, and we identified two genes with a high
potential for determining the response to Copaxone. In the future, it may be
possible to use this method to scan the genome of MS sufferers, to predict
the response levels in advance, and to optimize the dosage and treatment
protocol to suit each patient personally.&quot;

8. Sip Some Green Tea, Repair Brain Cells

by Hana Levi Julian

Green tea has long been thought to have a healing effect on the human body.
Now a study by an Israeli scientist has found proof in the laboratory of the
Technion Institute of Science in Haifa.

A research team led by Dr. Silvia Mandel of the Technion's Eve Topf Center
for Neurodegenerative Diseases found that green tea extract fed to mice with
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease protected the brain cells from dying. It
also stopped the process of degeneration in cells that were already
affected.

A green tea plantation

The Uruguay native, who immigrated to Israel in 1979, has studied the
effects of green tea on health and healing for ten years, since she first
began working at the research center.

Mandel attended Ben Gurion University of the Negev, where she earned a
degree in Biochemistry. She went on to receive a Masters Degree and then a
PhD in Pharmacology at the Technion before joining the research center.

It was during her first year at the center that Mandel found a study that
indicated the EGCE in green tea extract could be used to prevent damage to
red blood cells. That was the spark that set her on the journey to explore
its effects on neurodegenerative disease.

A green tea bud

&quot;I looked up some more articles and decided that maybe I could study this
compound - in any event, it is natural so it can't do any harm and it would
be nice to tell people that they can drink something pleasant like tea and
get beneficial effects from it,&quot; she explained.

The research findings in Mandel's study showed that the main anti-oxidant
polyphenol found in green tea extract, called EGCG, reduced compounds at the
molecular level that lead to lesions in the brain. The amount of EGCG
injected into the mice was equal to that found in approximately two to four
cups of green tea per day.

Her study, presented in September at the Fourth International Scientific
Symposium on Tea and Human Health in Washington D.C., was one of the first
to show the actual mechanism of EGCG when it enters the neurons in the
brain.

&quot;It was received really well,&quot; Mandel said in an interview with Israel21c.
&quot;It was novel in the sense that most studies presented dealt with how the
consumption of tea impacts several parameters in patients affected with
different maladies like cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.&quot;

Green tea

Mandel also said a &quot;neurorescue&quot; study by one of her Ph.D. students, Lydia
Reznichenko, showed EGCG not only prevented further deterioration of brain
cells in mice affected with Parkinson's disease, but also helped regenerate
the neurons that were already damaged.

&quot;We're the first to show that green tea is effective in doing this,&quot; said
Mandel. &quot;In the past, it was thought that once brain cells were damaged,
there was no way to repair them. The major question is whether these
promising results are reproducible in humans.&quot;
