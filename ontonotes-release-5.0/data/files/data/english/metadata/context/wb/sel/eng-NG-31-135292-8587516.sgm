hi there.

back in the days of cfmx 7.x 1.5gb was the max amt of
ram you could specify on a windows server to allocate to
coldfusion.

has that changed with cf8?

thanks!

The memory limitation is in the Windows JVM, not CF.

On 32-bit processor machines, the largest contiguous memory address space
the operating system can allocate to a process is 1.8GB. Because of this,
the maximum heap size can only be set up to 1.8GB. On 64-bit processor
machines, the 1.8 GB limit does not apply, as 64-bit processor machines have
a larger memory address space.

From what I understand, it is due to the 32 bit architecture. Currently
Adobe only supports one 64 bit server version and configuration, and
that is on Solaris. Last time I asked Adobe was exploring other 64 bit
architectures, but with no time frames.

On Windows, you mean.

A 32-bit processor can address 4Gb and I've worked on operating
systems - on 32-bit chips - that do indeed let you allocate 4Gb to a
process.

It's probably more correct to say the jvm heap and permanent space has to be
under 2GB for a 32-bit arch. So if for some reason you had a small permanent
space, the heap could be slightly bigger than 1.8GB. But that's a finer
point than most people need to have. CF needs at least 128 for the permanent
space, so the 1.8 limit for the heap. 64-bit doesn't fall under this memory
limitation, but to run CF on 64-bit it would have to be CF8 on Solaris since
that's all that is supported currently.

If you are running high on your heap sizes, you may need to switch out your
GC engine to one that can handle the heavier load. Here's an article on
this...

http://labs.fusionlink.com/katapult/index.cfm?page=articles/jvmtuning

Also, take a closer look at your code to see if you can trim stuff there.
Whenever optimizing the server check your CF code first to see if anything
is taking up a larger than normal memory block. For example, doing a simple
select * on a table query could easily mess with you.

rather how the O/S &amp; chipset address memory. 32-bit non-Windows
systems are perfectly capable of addressing 4Gb and therefore can run
CF with a heap in the 3Gb range.

Now there's a question as to whether you really want to use such a
large heap: it means longer GC cycles and &quot;lumpier&quot; performance. In
many ways, you're better off with the smallest heap that can handle
your peak load since that will give you much better GC performance...

Naturally this depends on the OS/Arch hence the reason I mention that.

Adobe must be doing something very particular with their JVM setup Sean. For
example running a 32-bit JVM on a 64-bit Solaris. I would certainly like to
know if that's what they are doing and to know how stable that is.

A straight quote from Sun on this...

On most modern 32-bit Windows systems the maximum heap size will range from
1.4G to 1.6G. On 32-bit Solaris kernels the address space is limited to 2G.
On 64-bit operating systems running the 32-bit VM, the max heap size can be
higher, approaching 4G on many Solaris systems.

This came up on the cf-community thread as I just got a new laptop with 4gig
of memory and only see something like 3.5gig available. Still bangin for how
I use it, regardless with what all those posers say about vista, pays to
have 4 gig ran I guess.

While I'm not complaining because who buys 3.5 gig of ram and then again
what the heck works in native 64bit systems yet, the following url addresses
some of the pitfalls of 32bit systems, also addressing where some of your
memory goes at least on vista.

Interesting... I guess the Macromedia servers must have been 64-bit
then. I thought they predated 64-bit. I stand corrected. Consulting
the Sun FAQ (which looks like where you lifted that quote), shows that
SPARC-based Solaris systems are 64-bit capable and Java 1.4.2 on that
h/w / O/S combo is also 64-bit capable. Well, that's what we were
running on since ColdFusion MX (6.0 Updater 3, at the launch of
macromedia.com).

I'm sure everything is working but not in what I should have stated, native
64bit mode. In two years, it will be time to upgrade my system again and
maybe it would be worth checking out a 64bit system then.

For me, FinalScratch is not supported on a 64bit system at this time. FS has
the worst sound drivers as it is, I'm not going to push it ;-)

This goes double now I'm getting an Ubuntu laptop at home, which means a new
