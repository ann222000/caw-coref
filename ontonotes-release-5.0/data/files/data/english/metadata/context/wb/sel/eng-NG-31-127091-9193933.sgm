I found this on Fark.

A fascinating tale of a young drone's ethical standards when all
around him fume breeders, brats and incompetent colleagues.

This guy is reasonably articulate. He will will likely find success
one day.

It's long, but worth the effort.

The “Vinegar Boy” Saga, as told by Aaron

Thursday, April 3
This is what happens when I swap work hours with the day shift - I get
all their weirdoes!
About 2 pm today, in storms this woman who starts going totally
apeshiat at me and screaming incoherently while waving around a
half-full bottle of malt vinegar.
I had no idea what she was on about and, before I could find out, the
police arrived - but I hadn't called them!
Now, I know nearly every cop within fifty miles of my site (I call
them all often enough), so when they come in, I greet them by name and
they do the same back and tell me they've been called here because of
allegations I've poisoned a small child.
Wuh?

The crazy lady identifies herself as the kid's parent and tells them I
poisoned her lad. To avoid describing twenty minutes of ranting and
gibbering on the woman's part, I'll cut right to the chase.
I had sold a 1L bottle of malt vinegar to a kid (about fifteen years
old) that morning and he had taken the bottle home and drunk half of
it - yes that's right, he had drunk vinegar. Of course, he got sick as
a dog and &quot;redecorated&quot; the walls and floor of several rooms.
[No, I do not know why a teenager, who should be old enough to know
better (and be at school too, for that matter) would drink half a
litre of malt vinegar.]

At this point the cops and I exchange looks and one said, &quot;Damn Aaron,
and we all thought you had finally snapped.&quot; Ha ha. There's always a
comedian.

The woman demanded that I be arrested, but the police weren't buying
it now that they knew the situation. She eventually relented on her
demands that I be be thrown in jail, but demanded an apology from me
for &quot;failing to tell her son not to drink vinegar.&quot;
I said, &quot;I don't tell people not to stick the fuel nozzle up their
nose and fill their brainpan with diesel either. And do you know why?
Because most people aren't that stupid!&quot;

End result: I refuse to apologize, and stand firm by my statements
that her child is a moron. She demands apology, threatens to sue for
slander, and promises to return tomorrow when the manager is here.
And I thought the loons only came out after dark
I'm curious to see what sort of reaction she'll get from my half-wit
manager if she comes back. But knowing him, he'll probably apologize
to her, and make a new rule that all staff will have to tell people
not to chug-a-lug vinegar

Monday, April 7
She came back in! This time she apparently brought both the
vinegar-drinker and her husband.
I got the call from my manager around noon today after they had been
in to see him. The story they gave him was, unsurprisingly, very
different from how it happened.
In their revised version, the kid asked me whether or not you could
drink vinegar and I said yes. However, since we now have cameras that
record sound (I don't know how I ever got along without them!), the
manager played back the transaction to them. Apparently she now claims
we edited out the sound

Despite all that, my worthless sack of shiat manager caved in to them
and apologized, and told me on the phone that he wanted me to write
them a letter of apology.

THAT was never going to happen and, after an extended argument, with
my manager using the &quot;saying sorry does not mean you accept blame, it
just means you're sorry&quot; speech, he's decided to write one for me
which he tells me I have to sign.

Well, that's never going to happen either. He can sign the damn thing
himself if he wants, but there's no way I'll be apologizing to this
stupid woman because of her stupid child.
So much for unwinding on my days off .

Tuesday, April 8
A lot of nasty stuff happened today.
My manager called me again today and told me to come in to work for a
meeting. He wouldn't say why, but I guessed it was either about
Vinegar Boy or the recent hassles we've been having with 'Sudsy', the
drug dealer I had arrested, and his junky horde.
When I get in to work, I find my store manager (SM), the territory
manager (TM), the stupid mother, and Vinegar Boy all there.
Can you spell 'ambush'? My manager can.

We go out to the back office, and my SM and the TM tell me off in
front of the idiot family for failing to exercise due care in selling
a fifteen year old boy a bottle of vinegar. The TM tells me to
apologize immediately. I ask, for what should I apologize?
The stupid mother chose this moment to pipe up and screech, &quot;I want
you to say sorry for telling my son it was okay to drink vinegar - he
could have DIED!&quot;

I reply that I never did any such thing, and told her that her son was
either grossly in error or a liar.
Both my SM and the TM again say to apologize - and now they want me to
say sorry for calling the kid a liar. I say I have nothing to
apologize for, and that I never told the kid it was okay to drink
vinegar.

At this point I should point out that I managed to keep my temper
under check for the entire time, even though I was extremely angry at
being ambushed. I figured there was a time and a place to unleash it,
and that it could wait for a little while.

Then the TM says that they know I did tell Vinegar Boy it was okay,
they have it on film (technically, we have it on computer disk, but
who's quibbling?). I ask to see the replay and if, from that viewing I
am seen to tell the kid it is okay to drink vinegar, not only will I
apologize, I will donate my last month's salary to the kid as
restitution.

The mother goes off about how we edited the footage to remove my words
and the manager started to get a bit shifty. The TM looked curious
about all this, and I thought that if the TM really hadn't seen the
footage, I might get out of this with my manager getting his lazy arse
kicked right out of the company.

Silly me - like that was going to happen.

So, at the TM's insistence, we watch the footage and sure enough, all
I say to the kid is to greet him, tell him the price, count him his
change, and a goodbye as he leaves.

The TM looked pretty angry and glared at my SM, but said nothing.
Nothing! He then repeats his demands to apologize.
I was floored by this. The TM saw I did nothing wrong, and still
demanded I grovel to this sack of waste after he and my SM publicly
abused me in front of her.

I refused to apologize (again!) and this time, demanded an apology
from both the SM and TM for ambushing me, attempting to humiliate me
in front of a proven liar and for trying to get me to apologize to
Vinegar Boy and his mother.

The TM told me to apologize, or I would be suspended for a week and
written up. I say, &quot;Fine&quot; and walk out with the stupid woman trailing
me and gloating at how I got what I deserved. As I get to the door,
the SM comes out and says, &quot;If you walk out the door, don't bother to
come back!&quot;
I didn't even pause.

When I got home, I had nearly a dozen messages from work on my
machine, but I deleted them without listening to them. I've now
changed the message on my machine telling my ex-SM that anything he
has to say to me can now be done through the union and to stop calling
my number - of course he hasn't listened and has called me at least
another fifty times since I got home.

When I had calmed down a bit, I called the site owner to see if he
could take a look at what happened. The owner of my site is a totally
cool guy, he's been in the fuel business since Henry Ford was a boy
and is very clued-in. But as he's semi-retired now, it's pretty hard
to get into contact with him. I did manage to catch his wife, so I
explained things to her.

Tomorrow, I'm going to my union rep to see about suing those sons of
biatches till they farking bleed.

But right now, despite how angry I am at what happened, there's a big
upswelling of sheer, unadulterated joy bubbling to the surface because
I'm free of that damn craphole, and I'll be making my SM's and TM's
life hell for as long and as hard as is humanly possible.

Thursday, April 10
Well, a lot's happened in the last two days!
Yesterday:
- I decided to start listening to the messages on my machine again,
both the store manager (SM) and territory manager (TM) left a large
number of very unpleasant messages about how I should be disgusted
with myself for leaving them in the lurch with the irate mother*, and
that I was a 'bad' employee and worthless sack of shiat. The list of
personal and professional insults was quite long, and I got it all on
tape. Both the TM and SM told me that I was never welcome at the
company again, and they will tell all the other petrol stations in the
area about me.

* I didn't mention this in my last post, but when I left the store
after the incident, Vinegar Boy's mother followed me out saying how I
&quot;got what I deserved&quot;. As soon as I was outside (and out of the range
of our in-store cameras) I let her have a huge blast of bile. Not my
best moment, and I'm not proud of myself, as I don't believe in using
foul language in front of women. But I forgot myself this once.

- Had meeting with union rep at 11 am and explained the situation.
Took the answering machine tapes with me. He got a union lawyer on the
phone then and there, and she came over in less than five minutes.

- Lawyer says I have a very good case, as the answering machine tapes
alone indicate I was forced out of the job due to hostile working
conditions. She gets all the papers I need to sign and goes off to
file them with the court.

- I get home and get swamped with phone calls from my coworkers asking
what the hell happened. The SM is telling them not only Vinegar Boy's
version of the story, but that I told the SM and TM to &quot;get farked&quot;,
so they had to fire me, but they all wanted to hear my version of
events. That last part, about swearing at them, is NOT true. I held my
tongue until I was out of the

The little moron must be so stunningly stupid that he thought malt

get drunk. Here's hoping he's still puking!

On further thought, I think the clerk showed great restraint when
dealing with the moo. If I had been told that it was &quot;my&quot; fault that a
15 year old drank vinegar, I would have asked the moo why on earth her
special ed crotch-dropping had been allowed out without its home
health aid.

Many, many moons ago, in a former career, I had an acronym for clients
like this, &quot;TDTL&quot;, or &quot;too dumb to live&quot;. The truly too-stupid-to-
remember-to-breathe clients ended up in my &quot;hall of feeb fame&quot;, which
I kept as a caution to newbies on the reference desk that with some
students you just can't underestimate their intelligence enough. Gawd,
how much do I NOT miss that job!

You'd have thought the moo would have been mortified to admit that her
runt was that dim, but I guess not. Wow. Just, wow.

What I find most fascinating about this story isn't the stupidity of
Vinegar Boy and his fucked-up, evil Moo. It's the confirmation of my
conclusion that in most corporate organizations, integrity is found
only at the levels of the founder (usually) and the rank-and-file
(usually).

The managers in this saga were all crass, greedy, selfish idiots. The
writer, who exists at the lowest rung of the corporation, had better
social skills, better management skills, better judgment and better
morals than the &quot;home office&quot; clowns making 5 times his salary in
their positions of power.

Granted, most workers think they know more than the &quot;suits&quot; do.
Sometimes they're right, sometimes they're wrong. I'm glad that my
company (a Japanese company) is run intelligently by a group of smart
(mostly smart) people. I love my Japanese overlords!

I think you could take 90% of middle managers and &quot;vice presidents&quot; of
American corporations and throw them into a furnace without negatively
affecting the company's operations in the slightest. Yet all we ever
hear about is how awful unions are and how heroic corporate suits are.

This story puts that mindset to shame.

Thinking of SM. It's fascinating to see how that collection of
behaviors is so often found together:

Cheats on and probably steals from his employers
Abusive to those under him
Rolls over and submits to abuse when there is nothing forcing him to
Lies to others
Can't tell truth from lies when someone lies to him
Relies on contacts, friends, nepotism rather than testing himself
against the world

I wonder what his marriage is like, if he has one.

No, it is you who is so stunningly stupid. Grab yourself a bottle of malt
vinegar, take a few swigs and see if you can still believe this story. It
is crap. No one is likely to take more than a very small sip of malt
vinegar before they realize that there is no future in drinking more of it.
Like much of the stuff I have been googling on this group, it is pure crap.

But if you're dumb enough to believe it ...?
