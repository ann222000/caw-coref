Weird iBook AirPort problems...

Hello,

My iBook G3 has had some really weird issues. It will not see my
Wireless network most of the time. I know it isn't my router because I
also have a windows laptop that picks up the network no problem.
When it does pick it up, it drops it very randomly, even when I am
right next to the router.

What could be the problem here? I would hate to go back to a windows
laptop. Mac's have much better battery life, and lets face it, macs
are better.

Any suggestions would be appreciated!
Thanks!
Jake

Most likely problem is a loose antenna connection or Airport card.
Pop the keyboard out, disconnect the Aiport Card, both from the
computer and the antenna cable, then put it back.

Tried that, didn't fix it.
Any other ideas?

Have you tried changing the base station channel.  Even though
another computer has worked okay you might still be having
interference.

The first thing I always do when setting up a WiFi network is to do a
site survey.  I use MacStumbler to identify any existing networks and
pick a channel that won't conflict with them, or at least one that
conflicts the least.  Check all around the area you expect to have
connectivity.

If you have an already working connection and it goes south it's a
good idea to do this also, someone may have set up a WiFi network
(and didn't check to see what was already active).

Of course you may also be having interference from 2.4GHz phones,
Bluetooth, microwave ovens and assorted other radio devices.  That's
why just changing the base channel is worth trying.

Jake,

I know with my iBook G4 you had to push the Airport antenna into the
card until it clicked twice. After the first click to seems to be
connected but really wasn't. I don't know if this is true with the G3
iBooks but you might try it.

P.S. If the antenna is really connected, the square metal end should
be snug against the card.

I changed the channel on the router, and I reseated the AirPort card,
and the antenna, and it is still giving me problems.
Could it be a Mac OS X problem?
Thanks for all the suggestions so far!
