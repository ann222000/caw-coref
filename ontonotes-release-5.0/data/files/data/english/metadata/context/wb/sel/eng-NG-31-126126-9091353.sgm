Iron Man conveniently de-powered?

Has Iron Man gotten so powerful that he's fallen into the &quot;Superman
syndrome&quot; of having to be conveniently de-powered when he guest stars
in other books? Especially these days, when he needs to be &quot;taught a
lesson&quot; that he never seems to learn?

Lately, Iron Man has had his rusty bucket handed to him when he's
guest-starred in other comics.  Even though I've enjoyed some of these
stories, it dawned on me that he's being beaten in ways that might
have slowed him down back in the 1970's, but certainly not today, when
he's ridiculously powered-up with Extremis and is as obsessively
prepared for any challenge as Batman is over at DC.

On the best day of his life, and with special mystic 'Thor-busting'
armor he couldn't take the real Thor. There is a possibility that he
could take Hercules because Herc can't fly and doesn't have Mjoiner.
With a smarter play he could have maybe taken Hulk. But one of Iron
Man's biggest current flaws, is that he has improved his armor to it's
current state and it's made him cocky. That's how he's been taken by
guys like Cap and the Panther. I've known this for years, I was finally
validated in th most recent Classic Avengers where Tony and Hank were
talking about why they contnued to try and improve their abilities. Back
then they felt inferior to guys like Thor, Hulk, and Sub Mariner. Tony
also had the bad heart. With his current level of upgrades Tony's early
armor seem like learning to make fire compared to splitting the atom. It
would be like if Patton had had M1-A1 Abrams tanks in the first World
War. Personally, I hope Tony gets pounded into baby powder.

--I disagree with this one.
While Tony can anticipate battles with most opponents, he had no way
of knowing how powerful the Hulk would be upon returning to Earth.  I
really can't imagine anything in Stark's arsenal that could hurt the
Hulk, let alone enable him to win.

We've seen Spider-man string him up in the upcoming previews, New
Hawkeye took him down briefly with an EMP arrow (provided by Black
Panther), Old Hawkeye then allow her escape and tell Tony off, She-
Hulk deck him, The Hulk kick his ass and now Thor pound him stupid.

Actually, I was going to do a post about how Iron Man fans can even
read him any longer.  He's no longer a glamorous playboy/superhero.
Now he's a sociopathic bueracrat/desk jockey/politician/superhero/
whipping boy.  Maybe the movie will force them to redeem him.

String him up is one thing; JMS has Parker at a power level where he can
pound the armor like you or I would mangle tinfoil without even hurting
his hands.  Idiotic.

Kind of like the beating Spidey gave Iron Man 2020 about... 20 years
ago. Nothing to see here.

Those last three are about the same as they've been for 20 or more
years. Hulk and Thor are several orders of magnitude more powerful
than Iron Man.

And you fail to menion what happened after She-Hulk decked Iron Man.
He shut off her powers. Decking doesn't mean shit.

Tony's practically become Dr. God. I am halfway surprised that Tony
didn't use his magical nanites to shut off Thor's powers.

hmm...I remember seeing something _years_ ago in a Spider-Man comic (I
think it was Spider-Man) that gave a rough breakdown of power levels
in the MU, and it had Iron Man at the same level as Thor and Hulk. I
was surprised, because it made IM even more powerful than the Thing.
(How is that holding up these days, by the way?) I guess what I was
supposed to get from that was that there were the guys at the top
level, and then there's everybody else, but the folks at the top can
have vastly different power levels, though all ridiculously high. I
didn't read it like that at the time, though.

Actually back in the 80's...sufficiently powered, IM could take on
Thor for a brief moment. But Tony was too busy monologuing to take
advantage of the moment.
