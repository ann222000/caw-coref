Hello all. Semi-new to this group. Have been in and out over time due to
various trips out of the country and such. Also sorry about the cross
posting but I wanted to get as many opinions as possible. I recently came
back from the 450 Mile Yard Sale from Alabama to Kentucky and did the entire
route over the 4 days it was run. This is my 5th time but normally I only do
about 50 miles in Tennessee one day and thats it, this time I did it all. I
was looking for some specific items. Items to trade, sell and keep. I found
a couple of Guitars I was looking for. And my wife was looking for glass and
especially Fenten. SHe found plenty. We also were looking for various types
of pottery. I was looking for fishing lures and other fishing related items
as well as some antique guns. What we found in the probably 300 yard sales,
flea markets and antique stops was that EVERYTHING was way overpriced except
for a few pieces of Fenten Glass that people were willing to deal with. I
decided the reason for the Fenten glass deals was because they werent marked
until 1974 so everything pre 74 is unmarked and hard to tell Fenten from non
Fenten. But as I said EVERYTHING was priced to its value limit or totally
overpriced. It became clear that between access to the internet, The
Antiques Roadshow and Appraise It!, pretty much everyone who has a plate or
a bowl or a house full has an idea of what they SHOULD get for it. I travel
all over the Southern States looking for antiques and collectibles. It has
become clear to me after this 450 miler that these shows and the Internet
have all but destroyed the Antiques and Collectibles market as far as deals
go. There is no longer any such thing as getting a &quot;Deal&quot; on anything. I
also believe that Antiques Roadshow has caused the proliferation of fakes. I
saw things on the 450 miler that people referenced to the AR and which were
obviously fakes. Recently Antiques Roadshow had a story on Fishing Decoys
for Ice Fishing. Newer Ones were in the 35 to 40 dollar range and some of
the older ones were in the 400-500 dollar range. Now, these are for Ice
Fishing. I found them all up and down the 450 miles. Not a whole lot of Ice
Fishing in South Alabama, but thier they were...looking exactly like the
ones on the Roadshow. One of a kind paint schemes that were shown on the
roadshow, were being sold in South Alabama! Recently the AR had shown a few
Indian Rugs which were very valuable. One a pretty good time ago which
belonged to an old man was valued at $500,000. Now, in 4 years I had never
seen an Indian Rug hanging up in Tennessee. This year I saw at least 10 of
them. Hanging on the same type of hanger as was shown on the Roadshow,
obviously fakes. The same went for Arrowheads. Arrowheads that were clearly
of African type, 8 and 9 inches long, were being sold as Indian Arrowheads
from Alabama and Tennessee for 600 and 700 dollars. They were so new as to
clearly have been fake and a couple of collectors who I was standing near
informed me that Arrowheads were some of the easiest collectibles to knock
off and they sell a lot of them. I am sure antique buying selling and
collecting will not go away, nor will collecting, but IMHO everything is now
way over the limit and eventually the market is going to take a big hit and
all these people buying all these items for Roadshow Appraised prices are
going to get a rude awakening. JMO.

Thanks
J

Hmmm....I'm not seeing that everything is overpriced. There are a good
number of real old ice fishing decoys that I'd snap up in a heartbeat
at 400-500 with my next stop being the auction house that I run
sporting goods through, some would buy me a new car.

There are people who gladly buy reproductions and other new items made
to look old not because they think they are going to make a buck, but
because they are decorator types who like the look. What a
collector/dealer sees as a high price on something made to look old may
be a bargain to one who is used to buying from an interior designer.

I don't see it all that odd to find things from other places in the
South, the parental units always bring back wonderful New England
antiques when they visit the South. Compaired to the local market the
things tend to be undervalued in small shops where they know their
bric-a-brac but don't know their antiques.

The only people who are going to get screwed the most are the dealers
who can't sell the overpriced fakes and have to figure out how to clear
the warehouse that they can no longer pay rent on because no one is
buying fakes. Surely anyone who's been in the game for any length of
time has seen a number of shops that sold new as old fail.

With all the talk locally and online about the antique/collectibles
business going to hell in a handbasket, I've had the best profit
margins and highest sales in the past five years this year.

That's it, Jeffie, it's the hangers that matter.

Jesus Christ, ignorance is one thing. Stupidity is another.

Tell us all about the obviousness of the fakes. We are hanging on your
every stupid word.

"/> Of course the hangers matter. They're not the only guide to a fake, but
they add to the amusement of catching one.

One of my interests is in Japanese swords. Now WW2 swords have been
faked by the Chinese since the mid-40s and in the recent &quot;eBay years&quot;
we've seen an absolute flurry of poor quality fakes of all periods of
sword - usually $50 bargain bucket rubbish of appalling quality. Lately
though we're seeing good quality fakes starting to appear - 17th
century styles, no stainless steel, no screwheads, generally pretty good
work.

And if you open up a standard reference book like Sato you can turn to
an illustration of a wel-known historical sword and play spot the fake
with it. And what's more, the fake will also have exactly matching
irrelevances like the sageo tying cords and the stand it was arranged on
for the book photo.

Good fakers fake the piece. Lesser fakers fake _everything_, even the
surroundings. We've heard the stories of the copied museum inventory
labels showing up on a &quot;found&quot; piece before.

I have always wished I had held onto the only Japanese WW2 sword I ever
had. Sold it on eBay to a guy in Hawaii for $250. It wasn't anything
terribly special, but it would have been good to have around if someone
broke into the house late at night. ;)
