People are very wise to refuse 'HIV testing.'

-----  Begin quote -----

Too many people are refusing HIV tests at sex health clinics - and a
key government target could be missed as a result, says an Aids
charity.

The target aimed to halve the number of people whose HIV infection is
missed when they visit a sexual health clinic for another reason.

Many people who have contracted HIV remain unaware of this, as it may
be some time before symptoms begin to appear...

LOL.  Symptoms?  What symptoms?  HIV doesn't have any.

A list of things that may be warning signs of advanced HIV infection.

Interestingly, a falling or low CD4 count is not a symptom of HIV
infection. :)

Who cares if they're aware of their HIV status?  It doesn't make any
difference in their behavior at all.  The government seems to think
that it can take a bunch of cracked-out sex addicts and counsel them
with a slogan or two and they suddenly become sober and celibate.

Since the HIV testing is not combined with physical incarceration in
case of a positive result, there is no point in doing it and it is
just a waste of tax money, not only for the lab test but also for the
very expensive medications that are legally mandated to be given free
of charge to AIDS patients.  Awareness of their HIV+ status and
medical treatment doesn't alter their sexual behavior, though, so it
makes the problem worse by keeping them alive longer to infect even
more sexual partners.  There are even some cracked-out, HIV-infected
lunatics who believe the virus is harmless or know it's dangerous and
deliberately try to transmit it.  Such people should be gassed.

Since most would follow a doctor's advise on how not to infect others,

Do you have any evidence at all to support your assertion that new HIV
patients follow their doctor's advice?  Besides, the doctor isn't
going to tell them anything they haven't already heard before, and since
they didn't follow the previous advice they aren't going to follow the
same advice from their doctor.

Do you even know an actual AIDS patient?  The ones I know are so cracked

in a fantasy world, you live in your own fantasy world where the problem
of HIV can be resolved with a few propaganda slogans and infotaining

time chanting slogans at crackheads before deciding that this approach is
effective.

21 year olds who grew up in a sexually repressive part of the U.S.

I previously suggested budgeting a strictly fixed amount for total
HIV medical treatment and preventative propaganda campaigns.  Unlike
the current system, providers of HIV services will not get budget
increases for additional HIV cases, instead they will be required to
treat new HIV patients out of their existing budget.  No reward for

If they are using your &quot;tax money&quot;, then it is ultimately the
responsibility of the people you elected to make sure the funds are
being used effectively.  If you don't like how the elections are
turning out, you might consider making some campaign contributions
to get people more to your liking elected.

I hear people moan about money being spent on HIV/AIDS prevention, but it is
so far the only thing that has proved to have any effect on this health
problem

The approach in many countries (UK NZ AUS to name some) where education has
been the key to having a controlling effect on this scourge. Their numbers
of HIV/IDS victims per 1000 is much less that the numbers in the USA, thus
indicating it does have an effect.

The very same people who moan about their tax dollars being spent on
HIV/AIDS prevention would scream load and long if a member of their family
is infected, and be screaming that more should have been done to stop this
disease.

Some of the one who moan and whine about spending money for these victims
and prevention, have no problem with gays and lesbians paying taxes to pay
for schools for their children etc, they think that is fair that others who
get no benefit from these schools should pay for them. IE most gays and
lesbians do not have children to send to school.

The old head in the sand syndrome is alive and well with the bigot
community, The &quot;it will not happen to me or mine is the thought&quot;. But it is
happening and it must be stopped, and this needs money.

I have reason to deal with some backpackers for a business reasons, and
these people enjoy sex, most of them have girl friends, and most of them
have unprotected sex if what they talk about is any indication.

I assume it is not much different with other young people, and if HIV gets a
big hold in the het community in these Western Countries, it is going to be
very difficult to eradicate.

Let us spend the money and help stop this horrible disease.

Because history changes, lol

Thu Aug 16, 2007

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People using CIA and FBI computers have edited entries in the online
encyclopedia Wikipedia on topics including the Iraq war and the Guantanamo prison, according to a new
tracing program.

The changes may violate Wikipedia's conflict-of-interest guidelines, a spokeswoman for the site said
on Thursday.

The program, WikiScanner, was developed by Virgil Griffith of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico
and posted this month on a Web site that was quickly overwhelmed with searches.

The program allows users to track the source of computers used to make changes to the popular
Internet encyclopedia where anyone can submit and edit entries.

WikiScanner revealed that CIA computers were used to edit an entry on the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq
in 2003. A graphic on casualties was edited to add that many figures were estimated and were not
broken down by class.

Another entry on former CIA chief William Colby was edited by CIA computers to expand his career
history and discuss the merits of a Vietnam War rural pacification program that he headed.

Aerial and satellite images of the U.S. prison for terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were
removed using a computer traced to the FBI, WikiScanner showed.

CIA spokesman George Little said he could not confirm whether CIA computers were used in the changes,
adding that &quot;the agency always expects its computer systems to be used responsibly.&quot;

The FBI did not have an immediate response.

Computers at numerous other organizations and companies were found to have been involved in editing
articles related to them.

Griffith said he developed WikiScanner &quot;to create minor public relations disasters for companies and
organizations I dislike (and) to see what 'interesting organizations' (which I am neutral towards)
are up to.&quot;

It was not known whether changes were made by an official representative of an agency or company,
Griffith said, but it was certain the change was made by someone with access to the organization's
network.

It violates Wikipedia's neutrality guidelines for a person with close ties to an issue to contribute
to an entry about it, said spokeswoman Sandy Ordonez of the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikipedia's parent
organization.

However, she said, &quot;Wikipedia is self-correcting,&quot; meaning misleading entries can be quickly revised
by another editor. She said Wikimedia welcomed the WikiScanner.

&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People using CIA and FBI computers have
&gt; edited entries in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia ....

And what he ignores is the article in Nature that showed that the
Wikipedia is comparable to the Enyclopedia Brittanica in accuracy
on technical topics.  It's been known for years that on hot button
subjects, politics, or anything else where people have a vested
interest in lying, there may be problems.

Sounds like &quot;neither&quot; should be &quot;both&quot;.  Someone else brought up
ancient China, which isn't relevant, and your &quot;fantasia&quot; is even
less relevent.

Otherwise, one can only conclude that your ad hominem argument is
just an attempt to cover up having made a fool of yourself after
you tried to inject some sort of &quot;fantasia&quot; into the discussion.

Come back when you have something substantive to say.

I've posted it several times:
&lt; http://www.nature.com/news/2005/051212/full/438900a.html &gt;.

The publication date is December 2005.  As I said, it deals with the
accuracy of the Wikipedia for technical topics (science, mathemetics,
engineering, etc.), not politics.

Nature is a high-quality peer-reviewed publication, not some random
web site.

There are some pretty choice quotes from shockingly honest Zionists.

1. &quot;We came here to a country that was populated by Arabs and we are building here a Hebrew, a Jewish
state; instead of the Arab villages, Jewish villages were established. You even do not know the names
of those villages, and I do not blame you because these villages no longer exist. There is not a
single Jewish settlement that was not established in the place of a former Arab Village.&quot; ­ Moshe
Dyan, March 19, 1969, speech at the Technion in Haifa, quoted in Ha'aretz, April 4, 1969.

The State of Israel was built after a movement called Zionism.The term Zionism first came to public
attention as a result of the works of Viennese Jewish journalist Theodor Herzl, who argued in his
1896 book Der Judenstaat (The Jewish State) that the best way of avoiding anti-Semitism in Europe was
to create an independent Jewish state or national homeland. (He was originally thinking of Uganda or
South America). The movement eventually culminated in establishing the State of Israel in 1948 in
Palestine. Some 700,000 Palestinians became refugees and a similar number of Jews arrived in the new
state. Since then, the term &quot;Zionism&quot; properly refers to supporters of the Israeli state.

The term racism refers to discriminatory beliefs and practices that presume inherent and significant
differences exist between different human races; that assume these traits can be measured on a scale
of &quot;superior&quot; to &quot;inferior&quot;; and that can result in the social, political and economic advantage of
one group in relation to others.

In November 1975, the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 declared that &quot;Zionism is a
form of racism and racial discrimination.&quot; In December 1991, the General Assembly rescinded this
resolution through Resolution 4686. At the time, the Soviet Union, a major sponsor of the &quot;Zionism is
racism&quot; doctrine (see Zionology), had completed its rapid collapse. Israel made revocation of
resolution 3379 a condition of its participation in the Madrid Peace Conference.

Some Racist statements by main Israeli and Zionist figures

* &quot;The Palestinians are like crocodiles, the more you give them meat, they want more&quot;.... Ehud Barak,
Prime Minister of Israel at the time - August 28, 2000. Reported in the Jerusalem Post August 30,
2000
* &quot; (The Palestinians are) beasts walking on two legs.&quot; Menahim Begin, speech to the Knesset, quoted
in Amnon Kapeliouk, &quot;Begin and the Beasts&quot;. New Statesman, 25 June 1982.
* &quot;The Palestinians&quot; would be crushed like grasshoppers ... heads smashed against the boulders and
walls.&quot; &quot; Isreali Prime Minister (at the time) in a speech to Jewish settlers New York Times April 1,
1988
* &quot;When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around
like drugged cockroaches in a bottle.&quot; Raphael Eitan, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defence Forces,
New York Times, 14 April 1983.
* &quot;How can we return the occupied territories? There is nobody to return them to.&quot; Golda Maier, March
8, 1969.
* &quot;There was no such thing as Palestinians, they never existed.&quot; Golda Maier Israeli Prime Minister
June 15, 1969
* &quot;The thesis that the danger of genocide was hanging over us in June 1967 and that Israel was
fighting for its physical existence is only bluff, which was born and developed after the war.&quot;
Israeli General Matityahu Peled, Ha'aretz, 19 March 1972.
* Ben Gurion also warned in 1948 : &quot;We must do everything to insure they ( the Palestinians) never do
return.&quot; Assuring his fellow Zionists that Palestinians will never come back to their homes. &quot;The old
will die and the young will forget.&quot;
* &quot;We declare openly that the Arabs have no right to settle on even one centimeter of Eretz Israel...
Force is all they do or ever will understand. We shall use the ultimate force until the Palestinians
come crawling to us on all fours.&quot; Rafael Eitan, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defense Forces - Gad
Becker, Yediot Ahronot 13 April 1983, New York Times 14 April 1983.
* &quot;We must do everything to ensure they (the Palestinian refugees) never do return&quot; David Ben-Gurion,
in his diary, 18 July 1948, quoted in Michael Bar Zohar's Ben-Gurion: the Armed Prophet,
Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 157.
* &quot;We should prepare to go over to the offensive. Our aim is to smash Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, and
Syria. The weak point is Lebanon, for the Moslem regime is artificial and easy for us to undermine.
We shall establish a Christian state there, and then we will smash the Arab Legion, eliminate
Trans-Jordan; Syria will fall to us. We then bomb and move on and take Port Said, Alexandria and
Sinai.&quot; David Ben-Gurion, May 1948, to the General Staff. From Ben-Gurion, A Biography, by Michael
Ben-Zohar, Delacorte, New York 1978.
* &quot;We must use terror, assassination, intimidation, land confiscation, and the cutting of all social
services to rid the Galilee of its Arab population.&quot; Israel Koenig, &quot;The Koenig Memorandum&quot;
* &quot;Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages. You do not even know the names of these
Arab villages, and I do not blame you because geography books no longer exist... There is not a
single place built in this country that did not have a former Arab population.&quot; Moshe Dayan, address
to the Technion, Haifa, reported in Haaretz, April 4, 1969.
* &quot;We walked outside, Ben-Gurion accompanying us. Allon repeated his question, What is to be done
with the Palestinian population?' Ben-Gurion waved his hand in a gesture which said 'Drive them
out!'&quot; Yitzhak Rabin, leaked censored version of Rabin memoirs, published in the New York Times, 23
October 1979.
* Rabin's description of the conquest of Lydda, after the completion of Plan Dalet. &quot;We shall reduce
the Arab population to a community of woodcutters and waiters&quot; Uri Lubrani, PM Ben-Gurion's special
adviser on Arab Affairs, 1960. From &quot;The Arabs in Israel&quot; by Sabri Jiryas.
* &quot;There are some who believe that the non-Jewish population, even in a high percentage, within our
borders will be more effectively under our surveillance; and there are some who believe the contrary,
i.e., that it is easier to carry out surveillance over the activities of a neighbor than over those
of a tenant. [I] tend to support the latter view and have an additional argument:...the need to
sustain the character of the state which will henceforth be Jewish...with a non-Jewish minority
limited to 15 percent. I had already reached this fundamental position as early as 1940 [and] it is
entered in my diary.&quot; Joseph Weitz, head of the Jewish Agency's Colonization Department. From Israel:
an Apartheid State by Uri Davis, p.5.
* &quot;Everybody has to move, run and grab as many hilltops as they can to enlarge the settlements
because everything we take now will stay ours... Everything we don't grab will go to them.&quot; Ariel
Sharon, Israeli Foreign Minister, addressing a meeting of militants from the extreme right-wing
Tsomet Party, Agence France Presse, November 15, 1998.
* &quot;It is the duty of Israeli leaders to explain to public opinion, clearly and courageously, a
certain number of facts that are forgotten with time. The first of these is that there is no
Zionism,colonialization or Jewish State without the eviction of the Arabs and the expropriation of
their lands.&quot; Yoram Bar Porath, Yediot Aahronot, of 14 July 1972.
* &quot;Spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment... Both the process
of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly.&quot;
Theodore Herzl, founder of the World Zionist Organization, speaking of the Arabs of
Palestine,Complete Diaries, June 12, 1895 entry.
* &quot;One million Arabs are not worth a Jewish fingernail.&quot; -- Rabbi Yaacov Perrin, Feb. 27, 1994
(Source: N.Y. Times, Feb. 28, 1994, p. 1)
* &quot;We will establish ourselves in Palestine whether you like it or not...You can hasten our arrival
or you can equally retard it. It is however better for you to help us so as to avoid our constructive
powers being turned into a destructive power which will overthrow the world.&quot; (Chaim Weizmann,
Published in &quot;Judische Rundschau,&quot; No. 4, 1920)

Arie Dayan: &quot;The Debate over Zionism and Racism: An Israeli View&quot;; Haaretz, 27 December 1991;

Right of return

The Israeli law of the right of return which, despite Israel's otherwise restrictive immigration
policies, grant every Jew in the world the right to settle in Israel. This is especially agitating
for the Palestinian refugees, who were expeled from their lands that is modern Israel, but are denied
their right to return.

The Article 11 of the UN General Assembly Resolution 194, &quot;resolves that the refugees wishing to
return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the
earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing
not to return and for loss of or damage to property...&quot;. Like many other resolutions by UN, Israel
still refuse to comply with this resolution.

Many opponents of Zionism declare that Zionism is racist, and compare its continuation to the reform
of Germany's former 'Blood Laws', which had

ROTFLMAO - the _Nature_ article, which pointed out the known problems
with political Wikipedia pages, compared the Wikipedia to the
Encyclopedia Britannica on technical topics (e.g., math, science,
engineering) and found the two were comparable in accuracy.  What does
&quot;Disturbing Quotes from Leading Zionists&quot; mean, particular if the
pages are flagged as ones that are questionable?

&quot;Death&quot; of course really want to push his homophobic agenda and finds
the facts inconvenient for him.  That's all there is behind his rants.
