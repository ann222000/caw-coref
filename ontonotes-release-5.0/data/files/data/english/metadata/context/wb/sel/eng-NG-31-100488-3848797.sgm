THE website belonging to alt.autos.citroen is back on-line.
The website was hosted by a cheap hoster in Belgium (nuke Belgium!
Nuke Canada!) but I guess it went bankrupt.
It took me a lot of work to get it back on-line with a new host.
Despite -=Hawk=- his suggestion I opted not for a cheap host this time
(thanks anyway for the suggestion). This website is costing me an arm
and a leg.

Some URL's
http://www.aacity.net to get new internet users into
alt.autos.citroen.
http://nntp.aacity.net the famous stolen links from -=Hawk=- with some
minor additions.
http://nntp.aacity.net/srf.htm for SRF calculation.
http://nntp.aacity.net/tf.htm for the Troll FAQ.
http://johan.aacity.net for some of my poor pictures.
Wonder how long this host lasts (can't nuke The Netherlands).
Could use some help though. If you have a Citroen related website I
would appreciate a link to the website. The reward, everlasting
thanks.
Any suggestions regarding webcontent are always welcomed.

I have a few days left to make a webpresentation of my poor and broken
XM.
I'll drive a Xantia soon.
Could buy another brand but than I would be expelled form the
newsgroup I helped to create. Adrian and Whiskers are quite strict on
those things.

1&amp;1's not a cheap host, they're a low cost host. If you're paying an arm

Pitty about those two CXs.

Oh. BTW. I'll collect my Xantia tomorrow.
It's a 1997 TD sx with 300.000km. It's red. Don't ask what I am going
to pay for it. It's probably way to much but I had some support from
the insurance company.
Made pictures of my XM today. Won't have time this week to make a
webpresentation.
I'll drop the XM, he'll probably scrap it. That hurts.

'82 Athena - 40k miles from new. I got it for £40, with a hole in the side
of the engine and a couple in the rear subframe, and nearly got evicted by
my landlord because of the swearing doing the engine swap. My dad parked
it, no tax, round the corner from his flat. And left it. And left it. And
left it. And didn't return the phone calls when the plod rang him to say it
was in their compound... (Or was that the 604GTi? I forget...)

'82 Athena - My first CX. Needed front arm bushes and door bottoms and a
respray. Then it cracked a cylinder liner, shortly after the rattly bottom
end (from a leaking oil filter mount that really needed the engine to come
out to sort) got a lot worse. He stripped a lot of it out, to benefit other
CXs, then it disappeared one afternoon from the car park behind his new

Good-looking cars; I certainly wouldn't mind having one.

I think the one I saw was like their 'Lomax'

Called the insurance today. Transferred insurance from the XM to the
Xant. They only asked my zip code and the license plate numbers.

The car is a gem. It looks close to new. No scratches and just one
tiny dent.
The Engine is vivid, much metter than expected. I have had a BX TRD,
no turbo, just 1.9cc of raw diesel power with a mind of it's own.
"So, you think I am not going fast enough and that's why you push the
throttle? Now way, I'll do what I want to do no matter how hard you
step on it"
Not with this (1.9 turbo) diesel. You push it and it goes faster. You
push it harder and it 'll try extra. It acts like a petrol car,
unexpected.
No clicking diesel sounds in the car. It's close to silent. Less noise
as with my XM.
The suspension is better as the XM. Less wobbly, just as smooth.
The interior is boring (is it a Volkswagen?), the exterior is likable
but without the impressive front look of the XM.
The XM I had (end '93) looks a lot better. The XM (2.0i) is faster and
has more raw power.
But the Xant definitely has a smoother ride.
Julian was right (in 1998).
http://www.citroenet.org.uk/html/x/xanana.htm
I like it.

Fuel economy should be better and the price of diesel is a lot lower
compared with normal petrol. Insurance is lower since new-value is
lower (weird) but taxes are higher due to higher weight. I have three
months of warranty.

The BOTH likes it. Not sure if that is good.

Freedom to roam, eh?

I've seen an amusing re-bodied Reliant, with a small motor-launch shell and
fore-deck instead of a car body.  It looked as if it was a real boat, until
it turned right when the car in front turned left.  Another one I see
sometimes has no body at all, and has been stretched so that the driver
sits on a motor-cycle saddle behind the engine, with the gear-lever between
the legs and a long horizontal steering-column, and an old bus seat welded
onto the back for anyone daft enough to be a passenger.

Someone recently announced that they wanted to inmport some Indian
'put-put' three-wheeled taxis to ply for hire in the middle of London (we
already have a few pedal-powered rickshaws); I don't know if that will ever
come to pass.  The 'black cab' drivers won't like it.

A TV show in the UK (a series on Channel 5 called "Britain's Worst
Celebrity Driver Live!") recently made one of the celebrities drive a 2CV
as 'punishment'.  I think it was the car they were punishing, although that
isn't what they meant.  (The show may have been "Road Rage School" on BBC1;
I get them mixed up).  Bad Driving seems to be the new Cookery on British
TV.  Some of the driving is really scary; there are some right nutters out
there.  I, of course, am a faultless paragon of perfection behind the
wheel  ;))

We have something similar out here. A so-called hidden camera and the

&gt;&gt;&gt; :-) Now where have you been?

&gt;&gt; Lurking in the shadows.  Sort of 'film noir' but without the
&gt;&gt; cigarette smoke.

&gt; So you were the man in the black raincoat. I was wondering who that
&gt; was.

Do you like the wide-brimmed hat?  With the beard and dark glasses I should
be invisible.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Freedom to roam, eh?

&gt; Always :-)

&gt;&gt; I've seen an amusing re-bodied Reliant, with a small motor-launch
&gt;&gt; shell and fore-deck instead of a car body.  It looked as if it was
&gt;&gt; a real boat, until it turned right when the car in front turned
&gt;&gt; left.  Another one I see sometimes has no body at all, and has been
&gt;&gt; stretched so that the driver sits on a motor-cycle saddle behind
&gt;&gt; the engine, with the gear-lever between the legs and a long
&gt;&gt; horizontal steering-column, and an old bus seat welded onto the
&gt;&gt; back for anyone daft enough to be a passenger.

&gt; I guess those things won't be allowed to drive out here. You aren't
&gt; even allowed to change the colour of a car, it doesn't match the
&gt; papers.
">

We can change the 'papers'.

Perhaps our regulations for 'one-off' vehicles are more flexible than
yours.  The main thing here seems to be that there should be no sharp edges
on the outside, and the brakes should be up to a certain standard.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Someone recently announced that they wanted to inmport some Indian
&gt;&gt; 'put-put' three-wheeled taxis to ply for hire in the middle of
&gt;&gt; London (we already have a few pedal-powered rickshaws); I don't
&gt;&gt; know if that will ever come to pass.  The 'black cab' drivers won't
&gt;&gt; like it.

&gt; It's the future in that clogged city. Go Dutch! Drive bikes!
">

Pedal-cycles have become a lot more popular lately, thanks to the
disruption caused by the recent bombs.  I don't know how many of those
people will continue to cycle to work through the winter - although once
you get over the first shiver in the morning, cold weather is better than
hot for cycling.

Around here, they are stereotyped as being careless of the safety or
convenience of anyone else; their cars are big and heavy and and tank-like
so they drive without consideration for others.  (Citroen drivers are seen
as harmless mild eccentrics).

Out here the only reason why people buy a Volvo is they think it's
safe. Those are the people that drive slow where they are allowed to
drive fast. They are the jam collectors.
