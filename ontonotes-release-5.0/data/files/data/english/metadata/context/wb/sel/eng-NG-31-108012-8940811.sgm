Barley goes very well with beef.
Some people don't like barley, but I've
always loved it.  It has very powerful
thickening qualities.  I suppose you
could extract the thickening principle
from the barley and add it to the beef
without the barley, but I've never heard
of anybody doing that.  All you'd have
to do is boil and strain it.

I use Veloutine, the terrific thickener that no one here ever seems to know
about.

I use my wife's method of braising for stew.  Season the meat with salt,
pepper, and savoury. Heat up pan and add a little olive oil and brown the
meat being careful not to crowd it. Remove the meat and toss in chopped
onion, carrots celery, mushrooms and some garlic. Once they are well
sweated, throw in some beef broth and 1-2 Tbsp. tomato paste, bring it to a
boil and add some Veloutine to thicken, but not too much. Return the meat
to the pan, put a lid on it and stick it into a 300 degree oven for a few
hours. Then add chopped potato and carrots.... not too much carrot or it
overpowers the stew. About 5 minutes before serving add some frozen peas.

I find that stews always taste better the next day, so before I add the
potatoes and carrots I cool it and refrigerate it overnight. When it goes
back into the oven the next day I add the potatoes and carrots.

Disclaimer..... seasoning and amounts vary with the amount of meat used and
the number of people to be served.

I prefer using flour as a thickener.  If you don't want to use flour,
use instant potato flakes or sacrifice a potato or two.

As far as your hockey pucks go.... sheesh.  Haven't you looked past
your name in the recipe section of http://www.recfoodcooking.com/ ?

This recipe was posted by me and they are deeevine!

Cream Biscuits

2 1/4 C all purpose flour
2T baking powder
1/2 C (1 stick) butter, cut into pieces
2-2 1/4 C whipping cream

Heat oven to 450°F

Sift flour with baking powder and salt.  Cut in butter.  Add 2 C
cream, blend to soft dough.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured
surface and roll out to 3/4 inch thickness.  Cut into 1 1/2 inch
squares.  Transfer to an un-greased baking sheet, spacing 1/2 inch
apart.

Bake until golden, about 15-20 minutes.

Probably late on this, but as someone else said, barley is great in stew
and also helps to thicken it. As an additional suggestion, skip the
biscuits / hockey pucks and instead try either dumplings cooked on the
stew, or popovers.

I love barley in stew!  And one of my grandmother's always dropped dumplings
on top of bubbling hot stew 20 minutes before serving time.  Simmer 10
minutes without a lid, 10 minutes with.

Potato.

You can buy potato starch or add some dehy mashed potato flakes but I
prefer to grate in a potato early so it breaks down.  I also sometimes
add okra.  I don't like flour as a stew thickener, it makes the sauce
cloudy and dull, I prefer clear and glossy... regardless what you
choose, go easy, you don't want to make library paste.

You can add 2-3 tablespoons of bread crumbs. Or carmelized onion, which
after long cooking will fall apart and thicken the stew. You can also
add 1 tablespoon of flour mixed with 1 tablespoon of sour cream and 1/2
cup liquid from your stew. Mix well and stir into the pot. Lower the
heat to simmer to cook the flour through.

I don't ever add thickener to stew. I just use less liquid, and if
it's still needing thickening, I mash up a couple of the potatoes
(stew HAS to have potatoes, for me) with a fork, and they do the
thickening.

It's based on potato starch isn't it? How much different is the

Yes, Steve's right.  Arrowroot is great for almost instant thickening right
at the end of cooking; e.g., most asian dishes.  On further heating, it
thins down.  For stew I'd probably opt for potato starch.  Even small
amounts of instant mashed potatoes (granulate/powdered, not flaked) work
well.

I don't know if they make this flour-in-a-cardboard container product
anymore, but years ago I spent a weekend with a friend who left on a stew
for hours and we would go to the kitchen to attend to it every 45 minutes or
so.  She would sprinkle this granular-flour from a cylindrical container - a
brand name as I recall - into the broth.  It would thicken slightly; it
would brown a bit and she'd come back and add some more.  I think this went
on for at least 4 hours.

I don't care a lot for beef stew, but I remember it being pretty good.

It's still available, both in the cylindrical containers and in boxes,
depending on where you are.   I usually see it near the cake flour.

I first heard about it from one of Julia Child's programs where she
recommended it for some things that needed a non-lumping flour.  For
some reason crepes come to mind.  I will have to look in her books a
bit later on and check it out.

If I caught the thread right, it's a beef stew right?  Flakes may 'clump' on
you.  You don't have to go out special and get powdered though if ou have
flakes handy.  Just crush them up well or use a blender if that suits you
better.  Me, I just throw'em in a baggie, press out as much air as possible
then beat the hell out of it (grin).

&gt;&gt; It's still available, both in the cylindrical containers and in boxes,
&gt;&gt; depending on where you are.   I usually see it near the cake flour.

&gt;&gt; I first heard about it from one of Julia Child's programs where she
&gt;&gt; recommended it for some things that needed a non-lumping flour.  For
&gt;&gt; some reason crepes come to mind.  I will have to look in her books a
&gt;&gt; bit later on and check it out.

&gt;&gt; Christine

&gt; Ahhh... I *do* remember the smallish cylindrical cans of it.  I
&gt; remember
&gt; buying a small container of it years ago for something. I don't
&gt; remember
&gt; what I was making, but the recipe (handwritten by a friend IIRC) called
&gt; for
&gt; Wonder.  I'll have to see if I can find it.

Or just use a slurry of flour and water.  make about cream consistency or
thinner.
Of course the Wondra works too.

&gt; flakes wouldn't work for this?

I suppose you could use them, but they don't disintegrate quite as readily
into the stew.  That's the only reason I keep instant mashed potatoes
(granulated) on hand.  I never make them as &quot;potatoes&quot;.

&gt;If I caught the thread right, it's a beef stew right?  Flakes may 'clump' on
&gt;you.  You don't have to go out special and get powdered though if ou have
&gt;flakes handy.  Just crush them up well or use a blender if that suits you
&gt;better.  Me, I just throw'em in a baggie, press out as much air as possible
&gt;then beat the hell out of it (grin).

yes, that occurred to me.  i guess i was wondering if they just became
'individual' flakes, which doesn't make sense because i don't think
they do that if cooked as intended.
