Geoff

I've been trying to use a version of Method:Wildseek
I've found on the newsgroup and it calls GCSString2Array()
the name of which suggests it might be something you have
had a hand in. ;&gt;)

Is the source available?

Cheers

Will

this is in geoffs emailer ...

IF SLen(cTemp) == 0
RETURN aRet

great product for managing all their record drawinhs etc etc

Thanks Richard but that isn't the one as it accepts two params,
one looks like it might be a token.

I know the CEO and several directors at BW (British Waterways)
but not on a commercial footing (I'm the founder/Chair of a
campaign that is sometimes trying to get better funding for
them and sometimes knocking them!).

I do also know someone who set up their website
( www.waterscape.com ) and he may well be familiar with
what software tools they use/need.

If you want more info contact me privately nbquidditch at
dsl dot pipex dot com

Thanks Geoff. The sample of Lutz's WildSeek that I found contains
another '3rd party' routine but I was able to figure that one
out. It was the second parameter that foxed me with yours.

I'll resist the temptation to shorten the name to GString - ;&gt;)

Best wishes of the season.

Cheers

Will

It's still one of the best tools for Cavo, we use it all through our
programs. We have written a wildseek for memofields too 3 years ago,
in case you are interested. You can download it from
http://www.ic2.com/cavo/captainmemo.zip
