Yesterday at the ATM, I inserted the card, and entered the pin. I was
then informed that my transaction was being processed. Well! I had not
entered my transaction! Then it demanded that I take the money and the
receipt. I did, and my card was returned. I always withdraw the same
amount, and I always require a receipt. Well, I counted the cash, and it
was the same as I always withdraw! Is this the newest trend? Mary

I know my bank has a "your transaction" key.
It now remembers (woo hoo!) that i speak english and that i often
wish to withdraw a certain amount from one of my accounts.
This shows up as an option on the screen, however, not as a fully automatic
transaction as you've just seen.  Perhaps you hit the enter key twice
without realizing it?

I haven't seen that one yet.  At several banks I've used in the past several
years, the ATMs always default to a sum of $60.00 when I try to withdraw
money.  At an ATM, I rarely take less than a hundred bucks out at one time,
so I don't know where this magical 60 buck figure comes from.  What's
annoying is that you have to punch through to the next screen to then
manually enter the amount that you want to withdraw.  If I never take out 60
bucks (and I never have), then why do I have to scroll past that screen with
each and every withdrawal?

This has happened at four different banks I've used, none of them related in
any manner.  What is up with that 60 buck withdrawal default?

It sounds like your bank goes a step further and automatically gives you
cash based on past transactions.  That would annoy me even more than having
to punch past the 60 buck screen constantly.  -Dave

Dave, it really did annoy me. I do like to be in control, especially of
my finances. I was in a hurry yesterday, but I will inquire about this
tomorrow. Bank of America is just down the street. I might need help in
some areas, but that was not one of them. Mary

Aren't they the guys who are running TV ads claiming faster money
withdrawals from ATMs?  Maybe the next stop is they will start spitting
money out (from your account) anytime a human walks by an ATM.  :(  -Dave

They are also the ones offering the "no problem" accounts for illegal
aliens. A citizen has to undergo a protological exam to open a bank
account. Not so for an illegal.

No shit.  You wouldn't believe all the hoops my wife had to jump through to
get a bank account recently.  At first, it was DENIED, even though she could
produce:
1)  Original birth certificate
2)  State-issued photo driver's license with current address on it
3)  Original social security card
4)  I forget what-all

But that wasn't enough to prove her identity!!!  The bank wanted a utility
bill with her name on it.  All the utilities have always been in my name
only.  They wouldn't budge.  They'd open an account for me only (without her
name on it), but they wouldn't give her an account at all!!!

So we had to switch the electric bill to HER name (after we'd already used
the electric bill to open my bank account, ironically), wait for the next
electric company statement to be delivered (now with my wife's name only on
my account), and then hand-deliver the FORGED electric bill to the bank.
Then, when they received the FORGED electric bill from us, they were happy
to open an account for her!!!  Go figure.  -Dave
