The Bible contains six admonishments
to homosexuals and 362 admonishments
to heterosexuals. That doesn't mean that
God doesn't love heterosexuals.  It's just that

For starters:

The Earth is the Lord's, and everything in it; the world, and all that
lives upon it.  (Psalm 24:1)

And every man that striveth for mastery is temperate in all things. (I
Corinthians 9:25)

For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are
in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions,
or principalities, or powers, all things were created by him and for
him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
(Colossians 1:16-17)

Hurt not the earth, neither the sea nor the trees... (Revelation 7:3)

And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the
dead, that they should be judged, and thou should give reward unto thy
servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name,
small and great; and should destroy them which destroy the earth.
(Revelation 11:18)

The Land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; for
you are strangers and sojourners with me. And in all the country you
shall possess, you shall grant a redemption of the land. (Leviticus
25:23-24)

So these things shall be for a statute of judgement unto you
throughout your generations in all your
dwellings.
Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death....
So you shall not pollute the land wherein you are...
Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell:
for I, the Lord, dwell among       the children of Israel. (Numbers
35:29-30,33-34)

Was it not enough for you to graze on the best pasture, that you had
to trample the rest of your
pasture with your feet?
Was it not enough to drink the clearest water, that you had to foul
the remainder with your feet?
(Ezekiel 34:18-19)

In God's hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the
mountains are his also. (Psalm 95)

Let's get a few things straight...

1    ER is a poor spokesperson for God, and what He thinks,
2    What we mere mortals view as destruction may not be the same in God's
eyes,
3    God's natural calamities have done more &quot;destruction&quot; than MTR, and
4    Al Gore is an idiot.  I got that di-rectly from God.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Bible contains six admonishments
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to homosexuals and 362 admonishments
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to heterosexuals. That doesn't mean that
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; God doesn't love heterosexuals.  It's just that
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they need more supervision.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   -- Lynn Lavner

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The Bible has no admonishments about mountaintop removal either.

&gt;&gt; &gt; For starters:

&gt;&gt; &gt; The Earth is the Lord's, and everything in it; the world, and all that
&gt;&gt; &gt; lives upon it.  (Psalm 24:1)

&gt;&gt; Agreed, but what does that have to do with MTR? That's one for my side.
&gt;&gt; 1-0

&gt; Seems to me the implication is man does not have the right to destroy
&gt; the earth, since it belongs to God.

&gt;&gt; &gt; And every man that striveth for mastery is temperate in all things. (I
&gt;&gt; &gt; Corinthians 9:25)

&gt;&gt; Agreed, but what does that have to do with MTR? That makes it 2-0.
&gt;&gt; 2-0

&gt; MTR is hardly &quot;temperate&quot; behavior.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are
&gt;&gt; &gt; in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions,
&gt;&gt; &gt; or principalities, or powers, all things were created by him and for
&gt;&gt; &gt; him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
&gt;&gt; &gt; (Colossians 1:16-17)

&gt;&gt; Yep, He done good, but what does that have to do with MTR?
&gt;&gt; 3-0.

&gt; Again, does man have the right to destroy what is God's?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hurt not the earth, neither the sea nor the trees... (Revelation 7:3)

&gt;&gt; OK, that's one for your team.
&gt;&gt; 3 -1

&gt;&gt; &gt; And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; dead, that they should be judged, and thou should give reward unto thy
&gt;&gt; &gt; servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name,
&gt;&gt; &gt; small and great; and should destroy them which destroy the earth.
&gt;&gt; &gt; (Revelation 11:18)

&gt;&gt; Holy smokes!  I ain't figgered that one out but lemme outta hyar!!!
&gt;&gt; 3-1-1

&gt; . . .destroy them which destroy the earth.  MTR is certainly the
&gt; destruction of the earth, at least to the degree man's capable of
&gt; such.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The Land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; for
&gt;&gt; &gt; you are strangers and sojourners with me. And in all the country you
&gt;&gt; &gt; shall possess, you shall grant a redemption of the land. (Leviticus

&gt;&gt; Agreed, but what does that have to do with MTR?
&gt;&gt; 4-1-1

&gt; &quot;. . .grant a redemption of the land.&quot;  Check out a Concordance.

&gt;&gt; &gt; So these things shall be for a statute of judgement unto you
&gt;&gt; &gt; throughout your generations in all your
&gt;&gt; &gt;      dwellings.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death....
&gt;&gt; &gt; So you shall not pollute the land wherein you are...
&gt;&gt; &gt; Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell:
&gt;&gt; &gt; for I, the Lord, dwell among       the children of Israel. (Numbers

Only that we all destroy something just by being alive. If ya take the
verse literally ( Hurt not the earth, neither the sea nor the trees...
(Revelation 7:3) , should we be destroying trees? Yes they are renewable,
but only if they are  re-planted and then it takes years and years. Usually
more than the turn around to cut more trees.

Using verses to prove or disprove this stuff creates more argument than it
solves.
I'm not for MTR, but I'm not against mining coal either. I not against using
wood, in fact, I
think we should use more of it.

It's just that a verse cited to prove or disprove a point can be twisted
round and round.

&gt; THANGS, I GUESS I BETTER GIT YEW HALF CREDIT SO AS TO AVOID THE PLAGUES....
&gt; 3-7-3

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you are strangers and sojourners with me. And in all the country you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shall possess, you shall grant a redemption of the land. (Leviticus
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 25:23-24)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Agreed, but what does that have to do with MTR?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4-1-1

&gt; &gt; &quot;. . .grant a redemption of the land.&quot;  Check out a Concordance.

&gt; I'M TOO LAZY TO LOOK THANGS UP SO I'LL TAKE YORE WORD AND GIVE YEW A POINT
&gt; ON THIS.... 4-7-3

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So these things shall be for a statute of judgement unto you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; throughout your generations in all your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      dwellings.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death....
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So you shall not pollute the land wherein you are...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for I, the Lord, dwell among       the children of Israel. (Numbers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 35:29-30,33-34)

&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, that's anothern - that makes two.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4-2-1

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Was it not enough for you to graze on the best pasture, that you had
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to trample the rest of your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      pasture with your feet?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Was it not enough to drink the clearest water, that you had to foul
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the remainder with your feet?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Ezekiel 34:18-19)

&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, that's three.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4-3-1

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In God's hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mountains are his also. (Psalm 95)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Agreed, but what does that have to do with MTR?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5-3-1

&gt; &gt; Man destroying what is God's.

&gt; OK, ANOTHER POINT FOR YORE SIDE.... 4-8-3

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've labored long and hard for bread,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For honor and for riches.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But on my corns too long you've trod
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You fine-haired sons of bitches.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    --Charles &quot;Black Bart&quot; Boles, a stage-coach robber and poet

&gt; &gt; &gt; Is that New or Old Testamint?

&gt; &gt; The Gospel According to Charles Boles, I reckon.

&gt; &gt; In any case, the Bible _does_ have &quot;admonishments about mountaintop
&gt; &gt; removal.&quot;
