Good morning or good evening depending upon your location. I want to ask you the most important question of your life. Your joy or sorrow for all eternity depends upon your answer. The question is: Are you saved? It is not a question of how good you are, nor if you are a church member, but are you saved? Are you sure you will go to Heaven when you die? GOOGLE·NEWSGROUP·POST·154

This is the most important question of your life.

The question is: Are you saved?

It is not a question of how good you are,
nor if you are a church member, but are you saved?

Are you sure you will go to Heaven when you die?

The reason some people don't know for sure if they
are going to Heaven when they die is because they
just don't know.

The good news is that you can know for sure that
you are going to Heaven.

The Holy Bible describes Heaven as a beautiful
place with no death, sorrow, sickness or pain.

God tells us in the Holy Bible how simple it is
to be saved so that we can live forever with Him
in Heaven.

"For if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord
and believe in your heart that God raised Him from
the dead, you WILL BE SAVED." (Romans 10:9)

Over 2000 years ago God came from Heaven to earth
in the person of Jesus Christ to shed His blood
and die on a cross to pay our sin debt in full.

Jesus Christ was born in Israel supernaturally to
a virgin Jewish woman named Mary and lived a sinless
life for thirty-three years.

At the age of thirty-three Jesus was scourged and
had a crown of thorns pressed onto His head then
Jesus was crucified.

Three days after Jesus died on a cross and was
placed in a grave Jesus rose from the dead as Jesus
said would happen before Jesus died.

If someone tells you that they are going to die and
then three days later come back to life and it
actually happens then this person must be the
real deal.

Jesus Christ is the only person that ever lived a
perfect sinless life.

This is why Jesus is able to cover our sins(misdeeds)
with His own blood because Jesus is sinless.

The Holy Bible says, "In Him(Jesus) we have
redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of
sins..." (Ephesians 1:7)

If you would like God to forgive you of your past,
present and future sins just ask Jesus Christ to be
your Lord and Saviour.

It doesn't matter how old you are or how many bad
things that you have done in your life including
lying and stealing all the way up to murder.

Just pray the prayer below with your mouth and mean
it from your heart and God will hear you and save you.

Dear Jesus Christ, I want to be saved so that I can
have a home in Heaven with You when I die. I agree
with You that I am a sinner. I believe that You love
me and want to save me. I believe that You bled and
died on the cross to pay the penalty for my sins and
that You rose from the dead. Please forgive my sins
and come into my heart and be my Lord and Saviour.
Thanks Lord Jesus Christ for forgiving me and saving
me through Your merciful grace. Amen.

Welcome to the family of God if you just allowed God
to save you.

Now you are a real Christian and you can know for
sure that you will live in Heaven forever when this
life comes to an end.

As a child of God we are to avoid sin(wrongdoing),
but if you do sin the Holy Bible says, "My dear
children, I write this to you so that you will not
sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks
to the Father in our defense Jesus Christ,
the Righteous One."

Those of you that have not yet decided to place your
trust in the Lord Jesus Christ may never get another
chance to do so because you do not know when you
will die.

Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth and the life:
no one can come to the Father(God)(in Heaven), but
by me." (John 14:6)

This means that if you die without trusting in Jesus
Christ as your Lord and Saviour you will die in your
sins and be forever separated from the love of God in
a place called Hell.

The Holy Bible descibes Hell as a place of eternal
torment, suffering, pain and agony for all those who
have rejected Jesus Christ.

The good news is that you can avoid Hell by allowing
Jesus Christ to save you today. Only then will you
have true peace in your life knowing that no matter
what happens you are on your way to Heaven.

Praise the Lord!
Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ

Yes, and if God was in Canada, The satellite signal coalition or
whatever the fsck they're called would lobby the Ministry of Canadian
Heritage, who would then get the RCMP to raid Gods crib.  No vetrans of
this newsgroup would deney this.

I'm certain that the CRTC has something on God, otherwise how else
could they stay in power? The CRTC:Corrupt Ruthless Totallatarian
Commission.

If I was in Montreal, the damage I could do..  Jews are my best friends
for a reason. I'm certain that if the Dealers actually used their
brains, they could get priacy legalized in Canada.  However their
shortcomings will be their downfall.
