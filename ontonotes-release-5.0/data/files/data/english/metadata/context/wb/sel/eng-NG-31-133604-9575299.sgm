Bible study is probably the number one way to keep your kids on
the right path, and keep them out of trouble. We can't watch our
kids all day and night, and we can't keep bad influences from
coming to them. But what we CAN do is make sure they know wrong
from right. This will help them when they face problems and major
decisions on their own.

How Can Bible Study Help Kids Grow Up?
Copyright (c) 2007 Adam Barnett
The Animated Kids Bible

Bible study is probably the number one way to keep your kids on
the right path, and keep them out of trouble. We can't watch our
kids all day and night, and we can't keep bad influences from
coming to them. But what we CAN do is make sure they know wrong
from right. This will help them when they face problems and major
decisions on their own.

Inspiring Confidence

One of the biggest difficulties children face is lack of
confidence. How can they be sure what is the right or wrong thing
to do? Our kids need constant reassurance and encouragement in
order to grow into healthy adults.

Teaching our kids Bible verses is a great way to instill
confidence in them. The Bible has a lot to say on the subject. We
can teach our children not to shy away from trouble, but to face
it head on, knowing that they will make the right decision.

Also, kids need self-esteem. It is good for them to be reminded
as much as possible that God loves them, and that they should
never question their self worth. Lack of self esteem can destroy
kids, especially in their teenage years.

Peer Pressure

We all know the kind of trouble peer pressure can get our teens
into. Peer pressure is really just another way of saying
&quot;temptation.&quot; What do our kids do when they are tempted by
their friends at school?

The Bible is full of stories about people resisting temptation.
It's a common theme. Always, some great reward is waved in front
of a Bible character's face, and they refuse, knowing that the
Lord's way is best.

If your kids understand the terrible odds people in the Bible
faced, from terrible fiery furnaces to a night spent in the
lions' den, they will be better able to just say no when the
time comes. They can understand that sticking to God's word is
never wrong, no matter what the &quot;group&quot; thinks.

Something To Hold Onto

Society is always changing, and it sends mixed messages to young
people. Fads come and go, but the Word of God has remained the
same for thousands of years.

Mass media, in particular, gives kids lots of ideas that are not
always appropriate. Among celebrities and other role models, who
are they to look up to? The Bible provides a solid guideline
about how to live our lives right in the eyes of God. This is
increasingly important these days.

Bible stories always have an important message, and that message
has not changed over time.

The younger kids begin to know the Bible, the better. They face
difficulties everyday, and understanding the stories of the Bible
and the ways of God can help them deal with these difficulties
with confidence.
