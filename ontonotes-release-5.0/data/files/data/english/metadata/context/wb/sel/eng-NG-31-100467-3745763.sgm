It's an idea that's been proposed a number of times, though I can't tell
you by who exactly. All I can say is that throughout my astrological
"career", I've been told that Uranus is associated with computers.

As you might perhaps induce from other postings I do here I am now
investigating Leo/Cancer (Sun + Moon) versus Aquarius/Capricorn (Saturn
(+Uranus)), trying to find out what are the main differences between
them, and what they go back on, if taken a step or two beyond the
keyword level. What are the key words _about_? How do they relate to
one another?

So far I am speculating along these lines:

Sun and Moon are about hereditary traits. They also relate to
procreativity in general, rearing children, being parent. The genetic
makeup. Families are social clusters of a very specific kind in that
they are biologically based, somehow. "Blood is thicker than water."
"You don't choose your family."

Saturn (Uranus) on the other hand relates to not what we're given from
the start but rather about relations of the "weak ties" sort
( http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item.jhtml?id=4516&amp;t=innovation ).

Relationships that are not of the body but which are rather distant
oftentimes and which require pretty symbolic and abstract
communication, and over distance (semaphoric communication). Aquarius'
relationships is about joining because of shared ideas, Capricorn is
about joining to achieve a common purpose ("work"), in neither case do
you need to be in any way related to the ones you join with. You get
social clusters based on ideas or achievement (merit), respectively.

Communication with help of the telegraph or over the Internet are
long-distance and thus Aquarian.

Well, I went off on a tangent, but, as I said, I am trying to
understand these things... :-)

All input and/or corrections appreciated!

P.S.
Your advice elsewhere to go back and reread the basics is a good one,
sometimes I overcomplicate the simple stuff. And poor you all here have
to endure me while I do it! ;-)

You might find traditional rulerships a helpful starting point. There,
Saturn is yin as the ruler of Capricorn and yang as the ruler of
Aquarius. The two faces of Saturn also sit opposite the Sun and the

Assuming that it is properly installed you can use Riyal right now to
calculate easily the position of *any* transneptunian object (more than
1000 so far) through the "all distant objects" menu option:

1-) Calculate a chart for the date and time in question

2-) go to "All distant objects"

3-) look for 2004 SB60 in the list (the list is sorted by desgination
as default but can be sorted according to any of the tabulated
quantities)

4-) the default position is the approximate 2-body calculation (Sun and
planet, no planetary perturbations)

5-) right-click on it to perform a fast numerical integration that
gives the accurate result.

Example: Samuel Morse was born April 27, 1791 (from the Wikipedia).
Calculate an approximate chart for 12h GMT, then go to "All distant
objects" and look for 2004 SB60. The approximate position listed is
20,09 Taurus. Click or right-click on it and you will get 21,13 Taurus,
which is the correct position (conjunct Morse's Mercury near 21,48
Taurus).

He's right. It's there.But you can't make an ephemeris of it which is really needed for
this research. And it is big compared with some of the small stuff that has been included.
I think he should delete the 2 body position because it is really misleading.
Just go to the best calculation and be done with it.

2004 SB60's approximate size (derived from its brightness or albedo)
meets Riyal's selection criteria, but its orbit was updated only in
late August. Before that time its positions outside the present were
mostly inaccurate or meaningless, and that it is the reason why it was
not included in the last update. Right now its orbit is accurate enough
and the object will be added to the next version of the program.

Size alone is not the only reason why an astrological planet becomes
powerful or meaningful. There are other reasons (such as the domain and
shape of the orbit) why objects are included in Riyal's main list of
objects. The several selection criteria are explained in the program's
manual.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I think he should delete the 2 body position because it is really misleading.
">

The 2-body positions serve a number of purposes for serious research:

1-) they allow to calculate *very accurately* tens of thousands of
transiting positions in the blink of an eye (Riyal includes so far in
this option all the named minor planets and all distant objects --a
total of more than 13,000) without the need for additional ephemeris.

2-) for Kuiper-belt objects, the 2-body positions remain
un-distinguishable at the arcminute level for over a decade. Even in
1791, when Morse was born, the difference between the reference 2-body
position and the real position is just 1,04', and this for all 1000+
objects in the blink of an eye!

3-) they allow you to study the effect of planetary perturbations. You
can, for example, add to the list the orbital elements of the Hamburg
School "Uranian" or "transneptunian planets" --or any other
hypothetical planet-- which are calculated without planetary
perturbations, and then compare what its position would have to be if
they really existed.

etc.

Well if you like including small objects, why don't you include comets?
You and astro.com have nothiing in regards to comets. That's shameful.
In my chart, the september comet of 1948 sextiles my mercury.
2 friends of mine didn't do any homework in highschool because they have this comet
conjunct the sun.
Think about it..
Now you say that you are so great at astronomic calculations.
Comets should be easy to figure out.
I use Guide 5 software for it. It's under $100US.

What I said is that size is not or should not be the criteria with
which to include or exclude astrological objects for study or research.
If small objects are included, it is not because they are small.

Why doesn't Riyal include comets? Because it is not designed to deal
with comets. The reasons are technical and specific to that program, so
I invite you to post the question in the "Riyal_compute" Yahoo forum,
which was made just for that.

I agree! ;-)

However, I know that traditionally, comets were known to "bring" particular
effects. So I wonder if we shouldn't give them more importance. Giving this
thought, where can we get the position of a comet that actually comes near
the Earth, since it is then that they are most effective?

There are hundreds of catalogued periodic comets that never come close
to Earth and therefore remain invisible to the naked eye. You are
referring to those that do come very close and their tail can be seen
in the sky, which is a very small minority.

Of these, many are one-apparition comets, or comets with orbital
periods of thousands of years that have been observed historically only
once. The position of most one-apparition comets can be obtained only
for the time they were observed, outside that time in most cases it is
not possible, or is only a guess.

Comets have by definition very unstable or chaotic (unpredictable)
orbits, so if you are interested in finding the position of a comet
outside the period of observation, and if the time is *not* between 2
observations, you may be in trouble: if the comet had a close approach
to a planet during that period, an accurate position cannot be
obtained, only a statistical approximation.

Of course, well-known comets that have been observed and recorded many
times don't have this problem, but even then, the position between
observations or the position in the future can only be approximate.

Most planetarium software can give you the position of any comet that
is in its database. But in almost all cases, the calculations are
2-body only (Sun and comet, no planetary perturbations, which can be
substantial during a close approach). To obtain the position, orbital
elements at the time of the closest (in time) apparition are used, but
if the time one is interested in (i.e., a birth chart) is too far from
the moment of apparition or observation, and the comet had a close
approach to the Earth or to any other planet, the position obtained
will probably be meaningless.

For example, the documentation of the software "Guide" (mentioned by
Jim Birke as his source for comet positions) explains that it uses
exclusively 2-body calculations for the ephemerides of comets,
switching between different sets of orbital elements to guarantee that
the orbit used is the closest in time to the desired date. However, if
the desired time is too far from the time of observation (for example,
a comet discovered or found, say, in 1995, for which there are no
observations available before that time) "Guide" explains that "its
accuracy would be horrible".

Accurate positions of comets, in the cases when that is possible, can
be obtained with numerical integration software or online services
(such as NASA "Horizons", which can give the ecliptic longitudes
instead of the usual r.a. and decl.). But if you are interested in the
spectacular comets with big tails in the sky that made history, in most
cases you will be only able to find its position at the time of its
apparition, and nothing else, because the "closse encounter" with the
planets will render the orbit chaotic in the short-range.

For these reasons and some others (such as the long-term
non-gravitational effect of out-gassing), the production of accurate
"100 years" or so ASTROLOGICAL ephemerides of comets, assuming that we
are dealing with cases when that is possible at all (in the case of
many of the spectacular comets it isn't), requires a lot more work and
a different approach or modelling. It is not easy, and the simplified,
2-body approach of most amateur astronomical software (such as
"Guide"), which can give accurate positions only for the time of the
osculating elements, is useless.
