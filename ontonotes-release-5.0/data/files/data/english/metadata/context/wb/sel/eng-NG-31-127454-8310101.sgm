I know JKR has no intention of writing a Book 8, but the unsatisfying
ending to Book 7 just begs for one.  Without giving it too much
thought here are a few of the dangling plot threads that could fill up
another several hundred pages.  I know JKR has addressed a few of
these questions in interviews, but I don't consider a question truly
answered unless it's in a book.  Please note that I'm not asking this
newsgroup for answers to these questions, I'm just listing a few of
the topics that are begging for another book to be written.

Do Harry, Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts to finish their
education? You'd think at least Hermione would want to.

What becomes of Hermione's parents?

Tell us more about the Ministry.  Kingsley is acting Minister of
Magic, but how does he clean up the place?  Is Percy involved?  There
must be some who resist giving up the power they gained.

What about Azkaban?  Is such a cruel place going to continue under the
new regime?

What about Dementors?  Are such evil creatures going to continue to be
part of the wizarding world?

Does George continue the joke shop without Fred, and if so how does he
cope with his twin's death?

Are there pockets of resistance among the remaining Death Eaters?  It
seems unrealistic that they would all just lay down their wands and
surrender.

How about Dolores Umbridge?  Is she punished and if so how?

Who becomes Headmaster of Hogwarts?  Tell us about the repair of the
damage to the school, the return of the students, and what the faculty
does to help the return to &quot;normalcy.&quot;  You'd think a special
Quidditch tournament or something along those lines would help restore
morale.

Tell us more about the Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione romances.

Describe the 7th years' graduation.  (Has there been a graduation
ceremony in the series?  I can't think of one off the top of my head.)

What about the funerals/memorial services for those who died in the
battle?

What does Neville do after graduation?  Is he recognized properly for
his heroism in dispatching Nagini?

What about the house-elves?  Does Hermione continue her effort to free
them and is she successful?

What about the goblins and Gringotts?  Are they going to tighten up
security even more or even threaten to cut off their banking services?
This looks to me like a potential goblin war brewing, after the Book 7
incident.

What happens to the dragon?

Is You-Know-Who REALLY dead this time?  Or is the shred of his soul
that's left in the baby-thing in King's Cross enough to regenerate
again?  (It might be -- we don't know too much about it -- no one ever
made seven horcruxes before -- and maybe souls can gain strength over
time.)

How does Harry respond to no longer having Voldemort in his head?  We
are told he no longer has headaches; but getting rid of Voldemort is
such a big change, psychologically speaking, it would be very
interesting to tell us something about the effect on Harry.  Harry is
free now; how does this change him?

That's not the point.  My point is that JKR left so much unfinished
plot, it just begs for another book.  Not an internet discussion, not
an interview giving the information, but a Book 8 in the series.

It is the books in the series that have enthralled me; I'm really not
interested in reading or watching interviews with the author, as
brilliant as she is.  There is just so much more story to tell at the
end of Book 7 .... and by including the epilogue she has essentially
slammed the door on the possibility of another book in the series.

The thing is though, that if she cleared up every possible thing that
could be cleared up, the interest would wane for the future sales of
the books.  As it is, they will resell over time because of exactly
what this group is doing; discussing the issues and the problems and
the philosophies.  If she spelled it all out, there'd be no more need
for discussion and hence the death of the future of the books as is.

Does your sarcasm here indicate you are thoroughly satisfied with the
way the book ended?  My post was meant to indicate that I am not.  I
mentioned specifically that I wasn't looking for the newsgroup to copy
answers to the questions from JKR interviews  -- I was just listing
some of the (many) plot threads left unfinished.  It's also true that
if JKR answers these questions in an interview, it hardly answers
these questions for someone who picks up the series ten, or thirty, or
even a hundred years from now.   Only another book in the series would
do that.

She had enough material left over to easily fill another book, and
it's a darn shame she slammed the door on the possibility with that
sappy epilogue, which was the worst five pages in the entire series.

&gt; It is the books in the series that have enthralled me; I'm really not
&gt; interested in reading or watching interviews with the author, as
&gt; brilliant as she is.  There is just so much more story to tell at the
&gt; end of Book 7 .... and by including the epilogue she has essentially

I don't agree with you.  There is a lot more that can be told, but the
information you want is another story, not this one.  This one
involved creating all these characters, but this story was promised to
end when either Harry or Voldy died.  Anything beyond that is a
bonus.   I think she should have left the whole epilogue off and just
added a chapter about the beginning of the rebuild after the final
battle, but I'm sure she wanted to put an end to her story of Harry
Potter.

What would you have in the final book, besides answers to the
questions?  What would be the conflict to create interest in the
story?  Another book would be very dull because there wouldn't be a
villain that could match Voldy and anything less would be
anticlimactic.  What you seem to want is answers to your questions, so
a post history report would be more in order.  The promised
Encyclopedia Harry Pottercus should answer your questions.  That is
the eighth book you want.  Not a full story, which could never measure
up.

As I said in another thread, I was more forgiving towards the
epilogue, since I assumed it was written together with PS/SS. If you
look at it this way, you will recognize the much more childish tone,
written to a series that was supposed to have seven 200-page books and
sell a few thousand copies, not the political and social juggernaut it
became.

&gt; I know JKR has no intention of writing a Book 8, but the unsatisfying
&gt; ending to Book 7 just begs for one.  Without giving it too much
&gt; thought here are a few of the dangling plot threads that could fill up
&gt; another several hundred pages.  I know JKR has addressed a few of
&gt; these questions in interviews, but I don't consider a question truly
&gt; answered unless it's in a book.  Please note that I'm not asking this
&gt; newsgroup for answers to these questions, I'm just listing a few of
&gt; the topics that are begging for another book to be written.

&gt; Do Harry, Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts to finish their
&gt; education? You'd think at least Hermione would want to.

&gt; What becomes of Hermione's parents?

&gt; Tell us more about the Ministry.  Kingsley is acting Minister of
&gt; Magic, but how does he clean up the place?  Is Percy involved?  There
&gt; must be some who resist giving up the power they gained.

&gt; What about Azkaban?  Is such a cruel place going to continue under the
&gt; new regime?

&gt; What about Dementors?  Are such evil creatures going to continue to be
&gt; part of the wizarding world?

&gt; Does George continue the joke shop without Fred, and if so how does he
&gt; cope with his twin's death?

&gt; Are there pockets of resistance among the remaining Death Eaters?  It
&gt; seems unrealistic that they would all just lay down their wands and
&gt; surrender.

&gt; How about Dolores Umbridge?  Is she punished and if so how?

&gt; Who becomes Headmaster of Hogwarts?  Tell us about the repair of the
&gt; damage to the school, the return of the students, and what the faculty
&gt; does to help the return to &quot;normalcy.&quot;  You'd think a special
&gt; Quidditch tournament or something along those lines would help restore
&gt; morale.

&gt; Tell us more about the Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione romances.

&gt; Describe the 7th years' graduation.  (Has there been a graduation
&gt; ceremony in the series?  I can't think of one off the top of my head.)

&gt; What about the funerals/memorial services for those who died in the
&gt; battle?

&gt; What does Neville do after graduation?  Is he recognized properly for
&gt; his heroism in dispatching Nagini?

&gt; What about the house-elves?  Does Hermione continue her effort to free
&gt; them and is she successful?

&gt; What about the goblins and Gringotts?  Are they going to tighten up
&gt; security even more or even threaten to cut off their banking services?
&gt; This looks to me like a potential goblin war brewing, after the Book 7
&gt; incident.

&gt; What happens to the dragon?

&gt; Is You-Know-Who REALLY dead this time?  Or is the shred of his soul
&gt; that's left in the baby-thing in King's Cross enough to regenerate
&gt; again?  (It might be -- we don't know too much about it -- no one ever
&gt; made seven horcruxes before -- and maybe souls can gain strength over
&gt; time.)

&gt; How does Harry respond to no longer having Voldemort in his head?  We
&gt; are told he no longer has headaches; but getting rid of Voldemort is
&gt; such a big change, psychologically speaking, it would be very
&gt; interesting to tell us something about the effect on Harry.  Harry is
&gt; free now; how does this change him?

Can Harry still talk to snakes?

Nope... JKR said he lost that ability with the piece of Voldie's soul.
