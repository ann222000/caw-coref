Battery Industry Safety Standards    by Angela Oliver

All battery manufactures are required to meet guidelines set forth by
various national and international organizations. There are several
organizations and they all have different focuses and concerns. Here are
some of the most influential safety standards organizations and what
battery manufactures must provide for compliance.

International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC): The IEC is an
international standards organization that deals with all electrical and
electronics related technology. When reporting to the IEC, battery
manufacturers must include general specifications, physical and
electrical specifications, information about watch batteries, the safety
of lithium batteries < http://batteryweb.com/ub_lithium.cfm > , and the
safety of batteries with aqueous electrolyte.

American National Standards Institute (ANSI): ANSI is a private,
non-profit organization that oversees the development for standards for
products, services, and systems in the United States. ANSI also
coordinates US standards with international standards. That being said,
there are several American National Standards that must be followed by
battery manufacturers depending on types of products. These standards
are as follows: American National Standard for Portable Primary cells
and batteries with aqueous electrolyte, the American National Standard
for Portable Rechargeable Cells and Batteries, and the American National
Standard for Lithium Primary cells and batteries.

Battery manufactures are subject to the standards of other notable
organizations such as the American Society of Toy Manufacturers (ASTM),
which holds standards for Consumer safety and specification for toy
safety, as well as the Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS), which holds
safety standards for alkaline primary cells and batteries.

Safety Standards and specifications are essential to keep product
quality where it must be for safe consumer use. Without these standards,
anyone could attempt to manufacture batteries and handle all the
dangerous materials that are used therein.
