This article says &quot;US researchers&quot; have found a way of producing cheap,
abundant hydrogen from renewable sources.

&lt; http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20071112/ts_alt_afp/ussciencefuel &gt;

Will this be the answer to dependence on foreign oil, global warming,
and disrespectful teenagers?

Back in April 2004 (or maybe 2003) Science (or maybe Nature) ran an
article (or maybe not) about some guy who'd developed a technique for
producing oil from anything from chicken offal to used tires. Anyone
remember that? We discussed it here. Whatever happened to that?

Probably not the last one.  The linked article says:

_What_ is the theoretical maximum?  If it takes a bathtub full of the

Probably not.  For one thing, hydrogen storage still isn't solved.  For
another thing, when they talk about something being economically viably,
they generally conveniently neglect to count much of the costs.  Something
like &quot;We can generate 0.10 coal-dollar equivalents of hydrogen out of $0.01
of electricity, every hour, once you give us $100,000,000 worth of
equipment and 4 PhDs to watch things 24/7&quot;.

But you never know.  One day one of these things will probably actually pan
out.

Well, according to Wiki the plant was operating as recently as
summer 2006.  It had taken a hit to profitability once it had to

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_depolymerization#Current_status

As reported on 04/02/2006 by Discover Magazine, the Carthage plant was
producing 500 barrels a day of oil made from 270 tons of turkey guts and
20 tons of pig fat. A federal subsidy (the Energy Policy Act of 2005)
allowed a profit of $4/barrel of output oil.

Company expansion

The company has explored expansion in California, Pennsylvania, and
Virginia, and is presently examining projects in Europe, where animal
products cannot be used as cattle feed. TDP is also being considered as
an alternative means for sewage treatment in the United States.

[end quote]

I think that post-dates the rebuttle posted upthread.  According to the
Wiki article, their two big problems right now are having to pay for
turkey guts (hence the interest in Europe, where there are fewer
competing uses for guts) and dealing with smell complaints (which may
be due to their neighbors, who also process disgusting animal by-
products).

Flim flam may not be a fair description, but there is a huge difference
between extracting oil out of turkey carcasses and general &quot;garbage&quot; as
described in the 2003 Discover article.

Apparently, the pilot plant cannot make more than a token profit with
$80 a barrel oil. That's using turkey carcasses and pig fat.

If you go to their web site, it still contains more material about what
they are going to do than what they have done. I would think that if
their process was a real breakthrough they would have been able to
demonstrate it by now.

Until they can show a profit without government subsidies, I'll consider
them in the category of things like nuclear fusion, where success is
always just around the corner.

The United States used over 20 million barrels of oil a day, in 2004,
according to the CIA Factbook. Granted the Carthage plant is a pilot,
but even if they could scale up the plant 100-fold, how many plants
would it take to make a sizeable contribution to our energy needs?

If they can actually convert sewage and garbage other than animal
carcasses, there would be a benefit besides the oil produced. But so
far, they don't seem to have been show that they are able to do that.

It's a proven technology.  That it is more expensive than gas from
crude oil right now (when crude is now pushing $100 a barrel, but
turkey guts prices are still the same...) doesn't matter much.  We

Well, yes and no.  The point is well taken that as the price of oil
goes up, more alternative sources, whether wind power or processed
turkey guts, become viable.  But these alternative sources have
limitations of their own.  The supply of turkey guts is not
unlimited.  While turkey gut production could be increased, this means
resources are being redirected from something else to do this, and
even with this there will come a point of diminishing returns.

I do not know if your deception here is deliberate (thought I tend
to lean that way), but the statements of profitability etc. from the
wikipedia site were all dated in 2006.  Now that oil has hit $100
a barrel, their situation has no doubt improved.

My understanding is that they have demonstrated the process with grass

Sure, but even sewage is a limited resource.  The idea seems to be
that gasoline (or some equivalent) will always be &quot;reasonably priced&quot;
because as the price goes up more alternative sources will become
viable.  Even passing gently over the vagueness of &quot;reasonably
priced&quot;, this is really another way of saying that the price will go
up, but this price increase will not be directly tied to petroleum
supplies.  It is also a good bet that the low hanging fruit will be
plucked first.  As the demand outstrips the supply of turkey guts and
sewage, they will figure something else out.  But it is unlikely to be
cheaper than oil from turkey guts and sewage, or they would have tried
it first.

Are you speaking as a financial &quot;genius&quot;, or a chemist?  the supply of
GASOLINE is finite and not replaceable.  If we continue to pump and
consume petroleum based fuels, they WILL, at some point in time,
become depleted - no economist can change that inevitable fact.

However, it's likely that we can develop some sort of renewable energy
source to make it possible (affordable) to stop or greatly reduce our
dependence on petroleum as an energy source.

Your statement above, as written, is bullshit, no matter how you try
to spin it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;remember that? We discussed it here. Whatever happened to that?

&gt;&gt; &gt;I remember the write-up in Discover magazine. He was building a test

&gt;&gt; As reported on 04/02/2006 by Discover Magazine, the Carthage plant was
&gt;&gt; producing 500 barrels a day of oil made from 270 tons of turkey guts and
&gt;&gt; 20 tons of pig fat. A federal subsidy (the Energy Policy Act of 2005)
&gt;&gt; allowed a profit of $4/barrel of output oil.

&gt;&gt; Company expansion

&gt;&gt; The company has explored expansion in California, Pennsylvania, and
&gt;&gt; Virginia, and is presently examining projects in Europe, where animal
&gt;&gt; products cannot be used as cattle feed. TDP is also being considered as
&gt;&gt; an alternative means for sewage treatment in the United States.

You can turn *some* of the organic matter into methane, true.  And
some landfills are now being designed to make use of this, BTW.  The
question is whether you get more net fuel by thermally depolymerizing
the sewage vs. waiting for it to decompose.  Also, I suspect that
thermal depolymerization is faster, which probably matters in a high-
throughput situation.

I agree.  But the answer depends on what your goal is, as I said.
The &quot;your&quot; is the generic &quot;your&quot;, not the Greg Goss-specific &quot;your&quot;.
If your goal is to displace foreign oil, then turning sewage into
electricity (mostly displacing coal or natural gas usage) just won't do.

Dependence on furriners is always bad, especially when it makes you
subservient to people whose values you don't respect.  And when it
goes bad, it can go VERY bad very fast.

I am also a fanatic on global warming.  US domestic energy in the very
short term is most likely going to depend on switching electrical
generation back to coal, which horrifies me.  I'd rather see nuclear.
Or cellulose-based ethanol.  (I don't trust the numbers on corn-based
ethanol.)

Paul's reply was more on point in criticising my points.  I'm not sure
what your point is.  Whether I would like to see less greenhouse
gasses or less foreign war is irrelevant to whether the fast or slow
path to pulling energy from sewage is better.  Either way you don't
release the methane.  And you want to pull the maximum net energy from
the energy source.

My paranoia and my delusions are irrelevant here.  If you want to
capture energy that's sitting there in sewage, there are two
technologies that might be used.  I haven't expressed a belief in
background tampering in the competition between the two technologies.

Some analyses of ethanol production, especially corn-based, point out
that more fuel is consumed growing the plants than is produced from
them.

Cellulose-based ethanol may or may not break even: on the plus side,
we can make use of what is now scrap material left over after
threshing.  On the minus side, it is very inefficient to produce
ethanol that way currently.  Research is focussing on catalysts,
better bacteria, better yeasts, and better pulping techniques, but
they're only a little farther along than the fusion people.

For nuclear power, the &quot;pebble&quot; plants look interesting, but I don't
think they've been proven practical at large scale.  And one objection
to the French scheme is that it makes more plutonium available for
terrorists to steal.  Of course the American scheme makes more waste
available for dirty bomb making, so Washington may want to rethink
that objection.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Well, yes and no.  The point is well taken that as the price of oil
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;goes up, more alternative sources, whether wind power or processed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;turkey guts, become viable.  But these alternative sources have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;limitations of their own.  The supply of turkey guts is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;unlimited.  While turkey gut production could be increased, this means
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;resources are being redirected from something else to do this, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;even with this there will come a point of diminishing returns.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence the interest in applying the process to sewage.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure, but even sewage is a limited resource.  The idea seems to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; that gasoline (or some equivalent) will always be &quot;reasonably priced&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; because as the price goes up more alternative sources will become
&gt; &gt; &gt; viable.  Even passing gently over the vagueness of &quot;reasonably
&gt; &gt; &gt; priced&quot;, this is really another way of saying that the price will go
&gt; &gt; &gt; up, but this price increase will not be directly tied to petroleum
&gt; &gt; &gt; supplies.  It is also a good bet that the low hanging fruit will be
&gt; &gt; &gt; plucked first.  As the demand outstrips the supply of turkey guts and
&gt; &gt; &gt; sewage, they will figure something else out.  But it is unlikely to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; cheaper than oil from turkey guts and sewage, or they would have tried
&gt; &gt; &gt; it first.

&gt; &gt; The answer is nuclear power.

&gt; Well, nuclear power is *an* answer, and almost certainly part of the
&gt; overall answer.  But nuclear power creates problems of its own.
">

What I'm saying is that without nuclear power, there is currently no
answer to the energy dilemma if CO2 emissions matter. Obviously if they
don't matter, we have plenty of coal. Wind and solar and the like are
dirty power (dirty in the sense of random fluctuations) and therefore
are unusable directly as a large percentage of grid power. Nuclear power
is the perfect base power. In fact, if you have moderating mechanisms
for dumping excess &quot;base power&quot;, say into aluminium smelting, you could
run much of your grid directly on &quot;base power&quot;. Furthermore, by
connecting AC grids with HVDC, we can dump power as needed between grids
without unbalancing them. So maybe the smelter is in California but the
power is coming from Ohio.

Gasoline isn't a specific mixture. You can run internal combustion
engines on almost any flammable gas. That means vaporized petroleum
products, natural gas, mostly methane, on hydrogen, on producer gas from
charcoal, wood, whatever.

Mechanisms for reforming to something like petroleum gasoline from
various gasified materials exist and have been known for decades. I
recall something like $2 or $3 a gallon (pre-tax) in 1970 or something
like that dollars per gallon.

By using crop residues, forest residues, all using as clever means as
possible, the US could produce a boatload of gasoline without having to
import oil for that portion of its gasoline needs. This has the added
benefit of using up the various residues which if done correctly could
then have their ash spread back on the field or forest as fertilizer
little different from what you get if you have a forest fire/slash burn
or burn your fields.

How much trouble have the French had with people trying to steal
Plutonium?

While Plutonium can always be used for dirty bombs--in fact, the
component of American nuclear waste that activists go nuts about is
the Plutonium that we refuse to use as fuel--it is easy to &quot;poison&quot;
it such that it makes a lousy bomb material, but is still useful for
power production.  If fact, you need to make Plutonium is a special
type of breeder reactor in order for it NOT to be sucky bomb material.

The easiest nuke to make is an enriched uranium &quot;gun&quot; device anyway,
and Uranium is found all over the world.

India has been building Thorium reactors that incorporate other people's
reactor waste as &quot;starter&quot; material, and turn it into stuff with shorter
half lives.  The new material they use, Thorium, is as common as lead.

I lived in a jurisdiction that had lots of natural gas but not much
oil.  A government subsidy led to a rather large number of methane
powered vehicles on the road.  I looked at a used dual-fuel Colt for
$2200 in 1988.  Phone tag problems is why I didn't buy it.  There are
lots of Methane filling pumps at &quot;gas&quot; stations in urban BC.

If I was looking at buying a car that ran on methane in the eighties,
then how can you say that methane isn't a candidate for oil
replacement twenty years later?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;far, they don't seem to have been show that they are able to do that.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Vancouver sewage treatment plant put roofs (rooves?) over the
&gt; &gt;&gt; ponds (settling ponds?  brewing ponds).  I suspect that this was done
&gt; &gt;&gt; to make the commute more pleasant on the nearby major bridge.  But
&gt; &gt;&gt; once you have enclosed the sewage treatment process, won't you get
&gt; &gt;&gt; significant methane from it?  Do we really need to turn sewage into
&gt; &gt;&gt; oil if we already know how to turn it into natural gas?

&gt; &gt;That depends on what your goal is.  Are interested reducing global warming,
&gt; &gt;reducing dependence on furrine oil, or indulging your paranoid delusions?

&gt; Um, I don't see where paranoia comes in.  Greg is asking whether a
&gt; proposed scheme for getting fuel from sewage is really better than
&gt; one that is already in use.  That sort of question is always a good
&gt; one to ask.

Where does the sewage go now? If you look, it ends up in the bays and
estuaries, tide flats and other bodies of water that are nearby. Even if
taken to secondary treatment, you are likely to see a rise in nutrient
levels that can cause harmful &quot;blooms&quot; of various things. Even if the
output is a wash, if the sewage can be truly dealt with and done so
without net energy cost, I say go for it.
