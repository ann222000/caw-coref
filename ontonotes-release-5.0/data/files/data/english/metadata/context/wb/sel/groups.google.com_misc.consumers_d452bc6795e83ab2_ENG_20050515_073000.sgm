Growing body of research bodes ill for private Social Security

Experts Are at a Loss on Investing
Nobel winners and top academics fumble the sorts of decisions Bush's
Social Security overhaul plan would ask average Americans to make.
By Peter G. Gosselin, Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON - Harry M. Markowitz won the Nobel Prize in economics as the
father of &quot;modern portfolio theory,&quot; the idea that people shouldn't put
all of their eggs in one basket, but should diversify their
investments.

However, when it came to his own retirement investments, Markowitz
practiced only a rudimentary version of what he preached. He split most
of his money down the middle, put half in a stock fund and the other
half in a conservative, low-interest investment.

&quot;In retrospect, it would have been better to have been more in stocks
when I was younger,&quot; the 77-year-old economist acknowledged.

At least Markowitz invested more wisely than some of his fellow
Nobelists. Several of them concede that they have significant portions
of their nest eggs in money market accounts, some of the
lowest-returning investment vehicles available.

&quot;I know it's utterly stupid,&quot; confessed George A. Akerlof, a UC
Berkeley professor and 2001 winner of the Nobel Prize in economics.

As President Bush crisscrosses the country promoting his plan to
overhaul Social Security, he argues that Americans are ready to trade
in a portion of their traditional benefits for ownership and control
over their own investment accounts. People have grown so comfortable
with stocks and bonds, he asserts, that they can invest their way to
more prosperous retirements by watching their quarterly statements,
adjusting their portfolios and looking out for themselves.

But a growing body of research shows that millions of Americans fail to
get even the most elementary investment decisions right.

More than one-quarter of those eligible for employer-provided 401(k)s
fail to sign up for them, according to the Federal Reserve. More than
half of those who do sign up funnel their money either into overly
conservative or overly aggressive investments, according to the
Employee Benefit Research Institute, a Washington think tank sponsored
by hundreds of companies.

Even more disconcerting, new research suggests that most people don't
behave anything like the economically savvy men and women that
free-market advocates and economic theorists claim they are. They often
shut down in the face of many choices. They sometimes even fail to go
after free money.

In committing investment errors such as these, ordinary Americans turn
out to be in good company. Even some winners of the Nobel Prize in
economics admit to making similar mistakes, either by failing to pay
attention to their own retirement arrangements or by making faulty
decisions when they do.

&quot;I think very little about my retirement savings, because I know that
thinking could make me poorer or more miserable or both,&quot; quipped 2002
Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University.

&quot;I would rather spend my time enjoying my income than bothering about
investments,&quot; said Clive W.J. Granger, an emeritus professor at UC San
Diego and a 2003 Nobel Prize winner.

White House officials dismiss such remarks as largely irrelevant to the
Social Security debate. They describe the president's proposed
investment accounts as voluntary and low-risk.

They suggest that those who oppose the accounts are taking a special
swipe at low-income Americans, who otherwise would not have the money
to invest on their own.

&quot;It's almost an insult to the ability of some Americans to take charge
of their retirements,&quot; Bush spokesman Trent Duffy said.

That Nobelists and other highly educated professionals get tripped up
by retirement is hardly proof that people can't handle their own
retirement investments. But it does suggest that few are terribly good
at the job, and fewer have the time or inclination to get better
quickly.

And the president's accounts plan would require people to do a very
good job at investing.

Under the proposal, Americans born in 1950 and after would be able to
divert a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes into individual
investment accounts. But in return for doing so, their traditional
Social Security benefit would be reduced - by the amount diverted plus
a 3% annual after-inflation charge on that amount.

With inflation now running about 3%, that means account holders might
have to earn 6% a year just to break even. Anyone who followed
Markowitz's approach - putting half of their balance in a low-interest
investment - would almost certainly lose money by signing up for
accounts. So would someone who followed Akerlof's approach - placing a
substantial amount of it in money market accounts, which now pay about
2%.

Markowitz, Akerlof, Kahneman and Granger are not the exceptions among
the nation's most-educated elite or the general population in taking a
cautious or hands-off approach to retirement investment.

In interviews and e-mails, five of the 11 Nobel winners in economics
during this decade and a handful of others since 1990 said they failed
to regularly manage their retirement savings. One even says he missed
the mark in how he invested his prize winnings.

Several had or have retirement funds parked in money market accounts or
other low-interest investments that they say are probably too
conservative.

The same is true of an estimated 50% of Harvard's 15,000-member faculty
and staff, who permit all of their retirement savings to be funneled
into money market accounts, according to the university, by failing to
specify how they want their funds invested.

The forget-about-it approach also applies to most of the 3.2 million
members of TIAA-CREF, or Teachers Insurance and Annuity Assn.-College
Retirement Equities Fund. TIAA-CREF oversees retirement investments for
most of the nation's college professors and research scientists. Almost
three-quarters fail to make a single adjustment in their retirement
accounts during the course of their careers, despite repeated urgings
by experts that people change their mix of investments as they age.

&quot;If the creme de la creme of the economics profession and American
academia can't get these sorts of things right, why should we expect
everyone else to?&quot; asked Yale finance theorist Robert J. Shiller. &quot;Why
should we be surprised that people who already carry a heavy burden
paying their bills and keeping up with their 401(k)s, if they have
them, are reluctant to take on new responsibilities with these [Social
Security] accounts?&quot;

Part of the problem is that retirement investment is one of the most
difficult financial tasks Americans undertake - far more difficult than
financing a house or paying for college because it involves so many
imponderables so far in the future.

&quot;Retirement is not like buying a cup of coffee,&quot; said Joseph E.
Stiglitz, a 2001 Nobel Prize winner, former Clinton administration
economist and Columbia professor. &quot;It's not something you get to do
over and over again and learn from your mistakes.&quot;

Recent research suggests that people, by nature, often make poor
economic decisions.

Analysts examining the actual behavior of individuals - as opposed to
what most economists' theories predict - find that it rarely conforms
to standard notions of what's rational. Instead, it often involves
systematic mistakes that end up producing the very opposite of what
people say they intend.

Consider, for example, the matter of choice. Polls find that by wide
margins, Americans favor the idea of having choices.

But research on 401(k) plans by Columbia's Sheena S. Iyengar and others
shows that, as the number of account choices that people are offered
goes up, the number of choices that people make goes down - about 2%
for every 10 additional accounts.

&quot;People say they want more choice, but when they're given it, they get
overwhelmed and use it as a reason to opt out of deciding,&quot; Iyengar
said.

Or consider economic self-interest. Analysts have long wondered why so
many people fail to take advantage of their employers' offers to match
their 401(k) contributions. The reason often cited by those who don't
participate is that they don't want to risk having to pay
government-imposed tax penalties should they need to get at their money
quickly.

But when David Laibson of Harvard, Brigitte Madrian of the University
of Pennsylvania and a colleague studied working people who had reached
the age when the penalties no longer applied, they discovered that 40%
still failed to take the match.

&quot;It's astounding. These people are doing the economic equivalent of
leaving $100 bills on the sidewalk,&quot; said Laibson. The implication, he
said, is that &quot;just because people have the economic self-interest to
do something and just because they are given a substantial incentive to
do it doesn't mean they're going to do it, or do it correctly.&quot;

Not even if they're highly educated, not even if they're Nobelists.

Edward C. Prescott of Arizona State University shared the Nobel Prize
last year for, among other things, writing about how central bank
policymakers lose credibility when they switch directions too often.
But he acknowledged that he and his family had been caught up in the
switching game as they had tried to ride the hottest investment trends.

&quot;There was a little time there in the '90s when my wife was gambling on
stocks,&quot; he said. More recently, he made an investment purchase of a
house in Phoenix to see if he could ride the real estate boom.

Akerlof, the Berkeley professor who shared the 2001 Nobel with Stiglitz
and Stanford economist A. Michael Spence, won for a paper on the
economics of used cars called &quot;A Market for Lemons.&quot; But he confessed
that he had a substantial chunk of his retirement savings in a lemon of
an investment - a money market account.

He said he placed the funds there because he couldn't decide what to do
with them.

A fallacy in the article is that money market accounts are &quot;a lemon of
an investment&quot;. If we assume that most people would select long
positions in stocks, or bonds, for retirement, money market accounts
are as good as it gets at this time.

Stocks (IMO) are overpriced, and the stock market itself is a sleazy
crapshoot, so any investment in equities right now has a high degree of
risk. Name a stock or a mutual fund you would put $100,000 in right now
and leave for 10 years. If you're thinking mutual funds, what about
Janus and their irregularities ?

Bonds are a horrible investment in the short-medium term if interest
rates rise.

This leaves cash, aka money market, as the only reasonably safe option.
One more terrorist attack and the stock market will tank. The
airlines are artificially held together financially by the government.
Ford and GM's bonds are rated as junk. The tech boom is long gone,
never to return.

If you bought stock in Merck 9 years ago, GM 41/years ago, Microsoft/7
years, Cisco/6 years, International Paper/10 year, GE/6 years, Coke/9
years - you still have the same value.

The classic case of Long Term Investment, subject of a book
and and PBS documentary. Several laureates founded this
company to hedge on &quot;scientific principles&quot;. They got stuck
in a trillion dollar bad play during the Russian currency collapse
of 1998(?). The fed reserve had to intervene, by putting
together a consortium of loan guarantees, to prevent a big
international economic downturn.

There were rumors of a simliar, but smaller event on 5/5/05
when GM stock went unexpectively up in a takeover bid.
Theres rumors that tens of billions were
lost by some hedge funds in bad positions.

Here is how the game is played. Based on your risk aversion profile, you
pick an investment medium that fits that profile. So, if you are risk
adverse, you will pick a low risk investment medium. If you are the direct
opposite, the odds are you will pick a more volatile investment medium. But
regardless of which medium you use, the only difference between the two is
one will likely give you more money when you are ready to retire than the
alternative. But you will still end up with a pot full of money, if you do
it for a long enough period of time, and if you put aside enough money
during that time. But there is a built-in advantage to the high risk
approach, and that is called dollar cost averaging and volatility. An
aggressive growth fund for example will be much more volatile that say an
income fund. But in the early years of your investment period, that is an
advantage, not a disadvantage (but obviously a risky strategy when you get
close to retirement).That is because of a concept called dollar cost
averaging. The more volitity you have when you are dollar cost averaging,
which is what you are doing when you build your retirement nestegg, the more
money you will make and of course the reverse is true, the less volitity you
have, the less money you will make.

&gt; it for a long enough period of time, and if you put aside enough money
&gt; during that time. But there is a built-in advantage to the high risk
&gt; approach, and that is called dollar cost averaging and volatility. An
&gt; aggressive growth fund for example will be much more volatile that say an
&gt; income fund. But in the early years of your investment period, that is an
&gt; advantage, not a disadvantage (but obviously a risky strategy when you get
&gt; close to retirement).That is because of a concept called dollar cost
&gt; averaging. The more volitity you have when you are dollar cost averaging,
&gt; which is what you are doing when you build your retirement nestegg, the more
&gt; money you will make and of course the reverse is true, the less volitity you
&gt; have, the less money you will make.

"/> Close enough. Dollar cost averaging is actually itself a product of
behavioural finance, rather than proper science. (I looked for the
reference, but I couldn't find it anymore.) Other than that, it's pretty
good.
One little thing: shares are more risky than bonds (to take two
examples). This difference does not decrease with your time horizon, but
increase. The longer your investment period, the greater the chance that
companies go bankrupt, etc., i.e. the greater the chance that you lose
your money on your shares. That's why option prices increase with their
time to maturity. This idea that shares really aren't that risky as long
as you hold on to them long enough is also a behavioural finance
fallacy. (By this I mean that it is inconsistent with rational analysis,
but behavioural finance shows why it is tempting for us to believe in it
anyway, the same as the dollar cost averaging above.)

When a fund manager does well, other fund managers figure out how it was
done and then bid up the prices of good stock picks as soon as they can be
determined to be good stock picks. Fund managers get fired for failing to
do that. As a result, as soon as a stock can be determined to be a real
winner, its price usually goes up before fund managers can buy really
large quantities of it.

"/>  I think what Steve was talking about what to do if you have a lot of
money now. Possibly the best to do if you have a large sum of money is
to get it in now. If I won the Powerball, I would get most of this money
into Vanguard Index Total by the end of the year rather than dollar cost
average for a longer period of time and miss a somewhat likely market gain
before I got all the money in. What I would do is equal amounts in weekly
(or daily if I had many millions and quit my job and had time to do so)
from now to early December, or a larger amount on the Tuesday before
Thanksgiving - traditionally a good day to buy stocks. (On a long term
average, the two months where the market gains the most are December and
January.)

Then again, if I had $100 million, I may not worry about dollar cost
averaging with equal $ daily purchases of shares over the next several
months, but just dump it all in now since if I had $100 million I will be
rich whether or not I gained a little extra by dollar cost averaging.

But if you have a paycheck, then certainly for putting money from
your paycheck into a retirement account you may as well put in equal
dollars per paycheck (or equal dollars per month if you can only spare the
money at a certain time of the month). Dollar cost averaging works quite
fine then. You invest the money when you get it, and you buy more shares
when they are low and fewer shares when they are high.

&gt;&gt;It's not amazing that the better funds have lower expense ratios. When

&gt;&gt;looks after both ends of the ledger.

&gt;What do you mean by &quot;better&quot;? If you're referring to total returns,
&gt;there are plenty of high-expense funds that have had stellar returns
&gt;over various time periods, and plenty of low-expense funds that have
&gt;had lousy returns.

"/>  Stellar funds that were stellar over &quot;various time periods&quot; mostly
became par at best to subpar after 5 or 10 years.
One fund that I condsidered notable for beating the market was one that
became notable for significant outperformance of the market mainly in a
couple years where they managed to beat the market, and otherwise they
were close to market. This was one of the &quot;Berger&quot; funds.

I also remember enough ads several years ago visible to subway riders
for a mutual fund that had a year with total return in the 40's percent
and maybe-probably 3 years significantly beating the S&amp;P 500. But this
fund was a &quot;midcap growth&quot; fund, and was one that managed in that era to
do just a few percentage points better than &quot;midcap growth&quot; stocks in
general did in that timeframe which was a brief era when &quot;midcap growth&quot;
did much better than other stocks.

==================================

Beware of &quot;Juice Pumping&quot;! This is a tactic where a typically smaller
mutual fund picks stocks that have prices that significantly move up as a
result of the fund buying these stocks. If you notice such a fund
bragging about their results, chances are you can only get in by buying at
such artificially high prices that gave them the results they used for
selling you on such a mutual fund.

==================================

Beware of &quot;Window Dressing&quot;. This is a tactic where mutual funds buy
winning stocks so as to report that they owned the winners - but all too
often they bought the winners after they went up although before the end
of the period that had defined reporting requirements.
In addition, the &quot;window dressers&quot; get rid of the losers after the
losers caused losses. This enables the &quot;window dressers&quot; to tell you that
they did not own the losers - but this is only as of close of reporting
period, as opposed to when they incurred the losses by owning the losers.

===================================

Now for more waryness about trying to beat the market: Let me tell
you about psychic ability and &quot;The Force being with me&quot; to require a bit
of luck to do this!

I forget the year, but most of that year Best Buy looked good. Most of
the middle of that year BBY price was around $30. I received a vibe that
I could buy BBY at $24 the following October of that year.

As a result, I bought some BBY at 24-7/8.

At that time and for all too many of the days in the following few
months, I had good vibe reception as to how BBY share price was doing.
Many days I could predict the closing price to $.25 on days when the price
moved $1 or more, at a couple hours before market close with no
non-telepathic contact during trading hours.

And what good did that do me?

I received enough vibes - from &quot;The Herd&quot; on Wall Street!

After I bought 400 shares at 24-7/8, before seeing any share price
after buying them, I felt the downward momentum not stopping after I
bought them. Saw 23-7/8 next day and 22-something a day after that.
And I knew telepatically that this happened before I could get the share
price via ordinary channels, although after my purchase of 300 shares!

BBY continued going down, and I bought 400 shares around $16 apiece.
After that I saw BBY going down to about $8 and then turning up.

I sold my 700 shares of BBY at a following time when doing so greatly
beat the market in a period when the market did well.
So what went wrong? I sold my 700 shares at around $40, and BBY went
into the 50's not much longer afterwards.

My next major stock move was Ford and beat the market doing so.

So what could go wrong? After selling Ford I bought Intel. I sold
Intel close to peak of the NASDAQ bubble. What next? I rebought Intel
after they fell noticeably, betting they were &quot;Blue Chip&quot; enough to not
fall outright through the toilet, and betting on prospects of sales growth
in &quot;emerging nations&quot;. I rebought Intel in steps through their descent
after the NASDAQ bubble, but too soon, as in all-too-early in the NASDAQ
descent that I overestimated there immunity to, and I also underestimated
how bad the NASDAQ descent would be until all of its damage was done. A
good 5 years later the NASDAQ is about 40% of its high over 5 years old,
and I did better than that with Intel but still am in negative territory
from rebuying them during their descent.

Bottom line: Even telepathy and &quot;The Force&quot; won't help you much to beat
the market. Better off just dumping your money into an index fund, and
any extra skills that you wanted to use to &quot;beat the market&quot; you should
use for other purposes.

===================================================

Possible retirement fund strategy to beat the market a little: Use
three Vanguard index funds that are roughly equal thirds of the USA stock
market, namely:

* Index Value (lower price/book-value half of the S&amp;P 500)
* Index Growth (higher price/book-value half of the S&amp;P 500)
* Index Extended (approximates investing in all stocks smaller
than those in S&amp;P 500)

Every paycheck or every month, put an equal amount of money into each.
This results not only buying more shares when the price is low, but also
more shares of what is running low.

In a non-retirement account, I advise buying Vanguard &quot;Index Total&quot;. In
a taxable account, this fund has the advantage of not selling shares (and
causing you taxable capital gains distributions) - this fund can only
cause you a taxable capital gain prior to you selling by owning shares
that get destroyed at a gain, and that can't be much.

Vanguard has another stock fund designed for tax advantage, and that one
is VTMF (&quot;Vanguard Tax Managed Fund&quot;) &quot;Capital Appreciation&quot; - and that
one buys stocks in roughly the lower dividend-yield half of the largest
roughly 1,000 USA stocks, and does not sell at price above *zero* except
should the fund have a cash outflow due to redemptions exceeding
contributions. What you gain in this fund in a taxable account is mostly
tax-deferred to when you cash out.
However, I see this fund having only a minor tax advantage over Vanguard
&quot;Index Total&quot;, and I see &quot;Index Total&quot; having an advantage of mostly (but
not always - BEWARE!) less volatility than &quot;VTMF Capital Appreciation&quot;,
which concentrates to large-cap and largish-midcap &quot;growth stocks&quot;.

If you are in a lower tax bracket but have money to put into a mutual
fund whose realized gains and dividends you have to pay taxes on
year-by-year, then whatever advantage to you of &quot;VTMF Capital Apprecian&quot;
over &quot;Index Total&quot; is decreased - may as well go for the better
diversification of &quot;Index Total&quot;.

Another thing: I find notable two Vanguard stock funds that are good
for mostly deferring taxes on their total return until you cash out, if
this is for a year-by-year taxable account as opposed to an IRA or 401K.
These funds are &quot;Index Total&quot; and &quot;VTMF Capital Appreciation&quot;. I find

A Continuous-Time Re-examination of the Inefficiency of Dollar-Cost
Averaging

MOSHE ARYE MILEVSKY
York University
STEVEN E. POSNER
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co. Inc. - London

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----
January 1999

SSBFIN-9901

Abstract:
Ever since the landmark article by Constantinides (1979), the academic
literature has been decrying the inefficiency of the investment strategy
known as dollar-cost averaging (DCA). In fact, despite more than twenty
years of damning evidence, DCA remains as popular as ever amongst the
press and individual investors. The purpose of this article is to
re-examine DCA, but using tools from continuous-time option pricing. We
believe that this framework yields additional and previously
undocumented insights into the nature of DCA. Our main results are as
follows:

(1) We show that the end-of-period stochastic payoff induced by
DCA--although neither normal nor lognormal--is identical in distribution
to the stochastic payoff of a derivative security known as a zero strike
(zepo) arithmetic Asian option.

(2) Standard results in continuous-time finance theory dictate
that--given the inefficiency of DCA--one can always construct a constant
proportions continuously rebalanced portfolio that will stochastically
dominate DCA, in a mean variance framework. We add to this by showing
that for typical volatility and drift rates, one can construct a static
buy-and-hold portfolio that will stochastically dominate DCA, in a mean
variance framework. By typical conditions, we mean that the underlying
assets volatility is lower than some--relatively large but
known--critical threshold that depends on the drift rate. This enables
us to quantify and display the inefficiency of DCA by 'moment matching'
to a static buy-and-hold strategy. In other words, we 'moment match' the
variance and then solve for the implicit loss in expected return, and
vice versa, we 'moment match' the expected return and then solve for the
excess variance. Furthermore, we confirm--to a first order of
approximation--that the nominal Sharpe ratio from DCA is reduced by 13%,
compared to any buy-and-hold strategy. However, if the volatility and
drift rates are not typical, we show that the Sharpe ratio of DCA is
higher than the Sharpe ratio of any buy-and-hold strategy.

(3) Finally, using techniques from the theory of Brownian bridges, we
compute the expected payoff induced by DCA, conditional on knowing the
final value of the underlying security. We are thus able to prove--among
other properties--that when the underlying security ends-up exactly
where it started, the expected payoff from DCA is uniformly better than
lump-sum investing. The magnitude of this conditional benefit to DCA,
increases with higher volatility of the underlying security.

"/> I'm sorry, but you're generalizing. If you want to build a well balanced,
allocated portfolio with 12-15 different index investments over multiple
401Ks and multiple IRAs and a taxable account, its challenging to set up in
the proper balances. Sure, if you only have one account and have access to
all financial instruments through it, it's easy; but in my case, my 401K
contains only half my total investment assets and only provides two dozen
different options, all of which are institutional funds which are not
market-traded. So, it's relatively complex matter of determining what
objectives I CAN meet with the limited options I have in the 401K, then
addressing the others outside the 401K, all the while making sure that the
dividend bearing instruments are in the right places.

You'll also notice that I didn't say to &quot;fiddle&quot; with it monthly. I said it
required some attention, and how much attention has to do with your personal
objectives and/or how quickly you get out of balance. Clearly, few Americans
are building properly balanced portfolios, meaning that the're either
finding it too difficult or finding it something that they're just not
interested in mucking around with, and to that end, Fidelity and Vanguard
and others are now geting involved with funds which actually do all the
asset allocation for you.

If everyone found it as easy as you do, those sort of financial instruments
wouldn't exist.

one) but I suspect that the difference between six and twelve is minor. IF
(and it's a large IF) an economic situation presented itself where world
indexes no longer closely moved with the S&amp;P, it would be nice (or bad) to
be in more than US equities.

digiits pretty quickly. Again, whether all that actually incrreases returns
or decreases risk substantially is another matter.

&gt; Higher expenses *usually* reduce returns. Most stock funds other than

&gt; higher is the percentage of non-index funds underperforming index funds.

&gt; When a fund manager does well, other fund managers figure out how it was
&gt; done and then bid up the prices of good stock picks as soon as they can be
&gt; determined to be good stock picks. Fund managers get fired for failing to
&gt; do that. As a result, as soon as a stock can be determined to be a real

&gt;&gt;Do what I did, or something similar. Use dollar cost averaging and see

&gt; I think what Steve was talking about what to do if you have a lot of
&gt; money now. Possibly the best to do if you have a large sum of money is
&gt; to get it in now. If I won the Powerball, I would get most of this money
&gt; into Vanguard Index Total by the end of the year rather than dollar cost
&gt; average for a longer period of time and miss a somewhat likely market gain
&gt; before I got all the money in. What I would do is equal amounts in weekly
&gt; (or daily if I had many millions and quit my job and had time to do so)
&gt; from now to early December, or a larger amount on the Tuesday before
&gt; Thanksgiving - traditionally a good day to buy stocks. (On a long term
&gt; average, the two months where the market gains the most are December and
&gt; January.)

"/> That is pretty obvious, but that does not apply to the vast majority of
people who want to accumulate wealth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually, many economists see DCA as irrational, given the likelihood
&gt;&gt;&gt;that you'll make more money in the long run by investing immediately.

&gt;&gt;But most people have income. There is money you won't have until next
&gt;&gt;month, money you won't have until 2 months from now, etc. Use some of
&gt;&gt;that money to buy shares when you get the money. Put some money into your
&gt;&gt;IRA or 401K every month or every paycheck, same amount each time (raise
&gt;&gt;when you get a raise), and you get dollar cost averaging.

&gt; True, but only incidentally. In this case, you're actually investing
&gt; the money when you receive it, which is the best you can do.

"/> Which is dollar cost averaging.

&gt;No, you are not necessarily better off. It depends on how well the fund

&gt;No, do what I did. Test the theory. Assume that there will be market

&gt;&gt; My favorite Vanguard funds have returns merely a little better than

&gt;&gt;change in fortune that most &quot;managed funds&quot; run into.
&gt;&gt; Another thing: I find notable two Vanguard stock funds that are good
&gt;&gt;for mostly deferring taxes on their total return until you cash out, if
&gt;&gt;this is for a year-by-year taxable account as opposed to an IRA or 401K.
&gt;&gt; These funds are &quot;Index Total&quot; and &quot;VTMF Capital Appreciation&quot;. I find
&gt;&gt;the latter preferable if you are in a higher tax bracket, and I find the
&gt;&gt;former preferable if you are in a lower tax bracket due to better
&gt;&gt;diversification.

&gt;Most index funds, by definition, are tax efficient - there's no reason
&gt;for them to have high turnover.

"/>  Index funds generally have low turnover. Some have lower turnover than
others. Pick an index that fewer stocks leave while having value, such as
Willshire 5000.

Some index funds have higher dividend yields, like Vanguard Index Value,
and some have lower dividend yields.

This matters in taxable accounts, mainly to those in higher tax
brackets. In IRAs and 401Ks turnover and dividend yield don't have tax
disadvantages.
