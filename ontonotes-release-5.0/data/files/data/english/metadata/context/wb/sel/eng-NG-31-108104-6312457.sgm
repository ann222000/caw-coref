Do cats have "off" days?

Yesterday I got up walked into the kitchen....and stood in a pile of cat sick
that seemed impossibly large for either cat, had visions (whilst cleaning it
off my bare feet-Ugh!) of the pair of them sitting next to each other and
going "1-2-3...PUKE!"

Anyway for some reason Dunzi seemed quieter than usual, which is very quiet
as she's not one to be in your face like Sarsi.

Then  another pile of puke appeared, this time in the bedroom, now as Sarsi
was at this point impersonating a dead cat (she's good at that) on the sofa
so it followed it was Dunzi's handiwork since she was in the bedroom.

She seemed a bit out of sorts all day, nothing I could put my finger on just
not quite herself. Through all functions normal apart from not seeming too
interested in her supper. This morning she was spotted diving to the food
bowl and seems to be her usual self.

Just wonder what that was about- did she get to eat something she shouldn't
have? (Cellophane springs to mind, she was trying to chew some the other day
but I took it away from her. When either Fugazi or Isis did that, me and Dave
knew our immediate future contained cat puke- we used to think they used it
instead of grass)

Snoopy occasionally has days like that, I do get worried but she's always
better the next day, if she wasn't I'd take her to the vet but so far that
hasn't been necessary.

Thanks for the reasurrance

Come to think of it I remember Isis(RB) going into this serious outbreak of
sneezing, eyes streaming etc and looking really unwell, so we rushed her to
the vets and by the time she got there, the vet could find nothing wrong with
her!

Then again that was probably a b***ard cat trick

Our have over the years.  Although we have been blessed with cats that
either don't puke very often or do it immediately after eating so it isn't
all that nasty.

I'm convinced there are things like colds and the flu that our furry masters
get, just like we do.  And that being indoor cats doesn't totally protect
them from it.

At the moment Jake is totally sacked out in "Charlie's favorite new chair".
Personally I think we just bought a rather expensive new cat bed.  And I
really can't tell if he's feeling poorly or is just playing a very extended
game of king of the mountain.

Last night was a bit scary. Dave emailed me at work to say he was a bit
worried about Dunzi as "Get home NOW!" worried and I rushed home fearing the
worst. She just seemed a bit quiet but to be on the safe side I called our
vets and couldn't get through.

As I am doing this, she is visibly perking up and this morning she is bright
eyed and bushy tailed back to her normal self.

I think it was a b***ard cat trick and when she realised I was upping the
ante by trying to contact the dreaded TED, she stopped playing around, in
case, I did take her to the land of butt thermometers!
