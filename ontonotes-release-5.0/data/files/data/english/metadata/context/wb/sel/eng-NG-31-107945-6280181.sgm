Dave Nadler's Antares electric self-launch was one of the hits of the SSA
convention. The fact that it was the first glider on display, nearest the
door, didn't hurt either! I didn't do an in-depth look see, so my comments
are first impressions only.

Since I already own a Schleicher ASH26E self-launch with Wankel rotary (a
very pretty and nice flying ship), I'm not in the market for a new toy just
yet, however, the Antares was most impressive in several unique ways. I'm a
machinist, by hobby, so appreciate nice machining and engineering - - the
Antares has that in spades.

Even the wing stand was nicely done, unlike any other I've seen, it uses a
gas spring to counter the weight of the wing, want it higher - just lift up
a bit, lower - push down some. The lateral movement was just as simple, a
slide to smoothly allow fore and aft movement on substantial bearings. The
closure to snug the cuff around the wing uses ball bearings and an
over-center lever. All clever and original thought.

This same "style" of engineering seems to have been applied all over the
place in the ship. Watching the engine retract, with its electro-hydraulic
actuators, was almost as much fun as watching the gear doors sequence on a
P-51 Mustang. After the prop disappeared, the engine bay doors take turns
gently closing as smoothly as the tray on a DVD player . . . no slamming
shut here!

Not being a true potential customer, I didn't want to take their time by
asking to sit in the ship, though it looked comfy and ergonomic. All of the
levers and controls appeared to be purpose built and with every decision
heavily influenced by "how can we make it better". If a part could have been
formed by flattening a piece of tubing, I think they CNC milled it instead.
Heck, even the rear view mirror, located near the front of the glare shield,
has a little lever near the front of the glare shield that allows the pilot
to flip the mirror down out of the way after confirming the engine/prop
computer has done its job properly. The wire enters the front of the mirror
in what looks like a smoothly faired composite housing. These people
lavished attention on this thing everywhere! A friend of mine, also a
"perfectionist machinist" type, opined that they were surely building it out
of passion and love, rather than a desire to get rich.

If you appreciate things that are nicely made, have look at the Antares. Now
if the EURO would just plummet in value by 50% . . .

All the best,

bumper

Another cool thing was that they could actually run the engine (at
idle) in the exhibit hall!

Yeah, but did you notice the propwash was aimed at all those vintage gliders
(grin). When they got a bit more rambunctious with the "throttle" setting,
those drapes on the dividers separating the two display areas started to
look like a wind sock!

Oh, another thing I forgot to mention, when they turn off the prop, the prop
rapidly "steps" backwards, maybe 10 degrees at a time being driven by the
motor in reverse to get to the vertical for retraction. Suppose there's no
advantage over just moving forward into position - - but it does look cool
as it's unexpected and reminds you that HAL is in charge.

Thank you for all your kind words.

Bumper: next time: try the machine on even if you are
not planning to buy one. The worst that can happen
is that you change your plans :P

As for 'getting Â bit more rambunctious with the 'throttle'
setting'; We never pulled more than 3 Amps (usually
1A). The Antares 20E has up to 160 A available (at
max 288V). If we had gotten rambunctious, then more
would have happened than that the drapes looking like
wind socks.

cheers,

Andor

Thanks for the kind words ! But, first and foremost, the Antares is
a magnificent glider, and a big step up in performance and handling.
The 18-meter version is the highest performance 18-meter glider
available. The handling is fabulous. And don't forget to feel how
incredibly smooth the controls move, feels like the ailerons
aren't connected. It was fun inviting people to move the stick,
and then watch as they leaned over to make sure the ailerons
were really moving !

See ya, Dave "YO"

PS: Still a position available in time for the 2008 season,
contact me directly...

PPS: Anybody get any good pictures at the convention ?
I was too busy !
