rec.antiques.marketplace is an unmoderated Usenet newsgroup, proposed
by Charleen Bunjiovianna and voted into creation in April 1995. It was
created for the purpose of posting for sale, wanted or trade notices
about antique objects, so that those ads would NOT be posted to
rec.antiques, the discussion group.

It is not within the scope of this article to define &quot;antique&quot; but it
is generally expected that objects offered in rec.antiques.marketplace
will have been made prior to 1950. ** Persons wishing to sell Barbies,
Elvis memorabilia, comic books, Star Wars toys, baseball cards and the
like are asked to use the existing rec.collecting or other appropriate
group instead. ** Persons wishing to sell old personal computers are
asked to use the appropriate computer marketplace group.

Items suitable for sale in rec.antiques.marketplace include (but are
not limited to): autographs, antique dolls, old jewelry, glass, china,
furniture, vintage clothing and accessories, old electrical devices,
art prints, calendars, silver, pottery, photographs, postcards, antique
toys, and magazines.

** Please price every item when posting For Sale ads. **

1. What about crossposting?

Crossposting a FS/WTB ad to rec.antiques and rec.antiques.marketplace
is a Very Bad Idea and likely to garner your mailbox lots of irate
mail. Please don't do it.

2. I can't find r.a.m on my newsreader! Can you mail me articles?

In a word, no.

You need to talk to your system support people locally. If all else
fails, try sending mail to both &quot;postmaster&quot; and &quot;usenet&quot;.
(Postmaster doesn't have anything to do with news, but sometimes that
person knows who you should contact.) Tell your news admin that
rec.antiques.marketplace is a legitimate Usenet newsgroup. If that
doesn't work or if your site is not adding any more newsgroups,
you will have to find another service provider.

3. I have a lot of items to sell. I want to post one article for
each one.

Please don't. Many people pay by the word (or byte) to download Usenet
news, and if you post many small articles instead of one large one, you
are creating extra expense for those folks. If you really have dozens
of items, consider posting several articles with a dozen or so items
per article, perhaps grouped by category.

3a. Someone is removing my posting! It was there yesterday! Guess I'd
better post it again today and tomorrow and the day after...

No one is removing your posting. Odds are that your newsreader is one
that doesn't show you an article again if you've already read it. Once
a week is plenty for re-posting. Some people think even that is too
often.

4. I don't want to sell anything, but I do have this neat reticulated
widget that my grandmother left to me and I want to find out what it's
worth.

Try your local library. Most libraries carry some or all of the major
price guides such as Schroeders, Kovels, Antique Trader and so on.
rec.antiques.marketplace readers expect to see postings about items
for sale *that are already priced*.

Comments for revisions of this FAQ are cheerfully encouraged.

No, I don't own rec.antiques.marketplace, or rec.antiques. But since the
charter is what the charter is, it's helpful to post it periodically
along with a reminder of why the group was created and why it exists.

You seem to have some sort of attitude problem. If the FAQ displeases

"/> Do you have to calll them &quot;antiques&quot; in order to value, enjoy, and talk
about wonderful works of art and architecture? Does your friend who deals
in Wright advertise in antique journals, or in Architectural Digest?

Do you need to have all the groups be random collections of comments and
advertisements in order to be happy?

I vote for the tone of this group to be moderate and dignified, and I vote
for us to continue to strive to keep this group to the discussion (not sale)
of antiques (not other things). I also join a folk dancing group, not a tap
dance group when I want to folk dance, and go to a Spanish class, not a Unix
class, when I want to learn Spanish.

The Internet isn't only American, but Americans who feel freedom means doing
whatever you feel like wherever you feel like don't seem to realize that the
Internet is about freedom of association as much as freedom of speech, and
that includes knowing enough about what people (democratically) decided
their group is about to join in the discussion.

There is nothing undemocratic about explaining our purpose, nor about
speaking up when it seems to be in danger of being lost in the shuffle. If
you don't like our club, you have the freedom to join another club, or
create your own.

"/> Well, you asked:

1. I would be happier if people with pseudonymous
accounts did not choose to hurl rude insults.
It's easy to be big and brave and nasty when
you know that you won't have to take responsibility
for your nastiness. But it's a form of cowardice
that I would just as soon not see when I am
searching for stories about the compulsive dealer/buyer
dance of the antiques/collectible field. If I'm
going to read about ethically reprehensible behavior
on this newsgroup I would just as soon read about
things that matter, like villainous auctioneers or scandalous
cheating dealers.

2. I would be happier if even the people who seem unable
to understand the paradigm of a Usenet newsgroup did not
violate the charter of a newsgroup. It doesn't seem too difficult
to understand the purpose and need for the topic division
that newsgroups require (flexible as they can sometimes be),
nor does it seem too difficult to understand that Usenet
requires a sense of communal behavior. Then again,
it doesn't seem too difficult to understand why chipped
or scratched Fiestaware shouldn't command book prices,
and yet you see this all the time as well.

3. I would be happier if discussion of a newsgroup charter
centered around that charter itself, and not the
supposed character defects of the individual who
merely posted the charter. I would also be happier if
Gene Florence's depression kitchenware books provided more
information than pricing. I recognize that my chances
of being happier in either of these particular instances
are quite low.

So it isn't so much that I would be happier if you
weren't here as I would be happier if the behavior
you have exhibited here were not here. Given your last
three posts, and your history of correspondence with
Dan Patnode, I don't have much hope of separating these
two issues out, however.

I have much more hope that this very weekend I will find
a Hall banded cookie jar with a cactus or flamingo
decal for a very low price. It springs eternal.

many posts I see chastising people who step outside the boundaries are
evidence enough that I am not alone. Keep it up Dan.

rapport with the group, despite stumbling along the way, but
raspberries, threats, name-calling, and rude behavior just doesn't

I am assuming you're over 20, and you sound very intelligent, so you
probably know the difference between &quot;in your face&quot; communication and
the more productive way of communication- open discussion of a
difference of opinion.
You might have proposed a change in the charter- solicited comments,
opened dialog about it, and taken a vote. Rude, child-like
communication does not win many allies, I'm afraid.
I would welcome you back immediately, however, should you wish to have
an open dialogs with people- without threat of intimidation,
assumptions about individuals, or debasement of ideas and opinions. I
suspect that you have a lot to offer here and would be an asset to
this group. I would hope that will be the case someday.

Wow,
Have not checked this group for a couple of days, what a stew is
brewing! Guess beatnik and others have not received my own personal
requests to those who post totally inappropriate items to this group.
Have never thought of myself as a mind policeman, enforcer, etc. just
a proper member of society, who reads the rules of the group I am in
and then follows them. (guess I must be below average in social
intelligence and IQ to do this old-fashioned and polite thing)
Perhaps from his handle beatnik is trying to reassert the rebellious
days of the 60's when rules were passe and the establishment was
pushed out of the way. That brought us a fine moral, legal, growing
society (end of social comment) didn't it?
Rules are for social interaction, rules define limits, rules give
guidance. Many do not like them, but they are needed, without rules I
would hate to land in an airport (who comes first), drive through an
intersection (who has the right to go through first) etc.
Guys and gals, let's just read the FAQ, read the intent and purpose of
the group, then agree to abide by these &quot;rules&quot; or go make our own
group and then become the rule police in our own domain.
Re: the remarks about true antiques.
Most of us would like to deal with true and certifiable antiques, but
most of us do not have that luxury. We are stuck in dealing and
discussing as antiques and collectibles, those things which are a
generation or so old.
Not all of us like to talk about 1950's stuff, or look at it. But
then again not all of us like to talk about hand made tools from the
1700's either. I learn from each person when we stick to the issue.
Let us get back to antiques, away from personal stuff. OK.
Just my own two cents worth.

So... I pop back into rec.antiques to see how things are, and what do I
find? Yet another arsehole with an attitude problem and a dysfunctional
sense of acceptable social behaviour.

Beatnik, there are a number of things about the person you present that
bother me, apart from your insistence in anonymity. I suspect that this
either demonstrates severe paranoia, or a desire to yank our chains
from a safe distance. Either way, it is both discourteous and
unneccesary.

Allow me to explain something to you... No-one, not even Dan Patenode
whom you have targetted so viciously, is trying to police or run this
group. This group has a charter, and one that the majority of
participants support and follow. You, sir, by your refusal to go along
with majority, are behaving like a spoilt brat, and are presenting
yourself as a complete arsehole.

Carl Ratner, I am one knowledgeable person who has [more-or-less] left
this group, but not, as you assert, as a result of Charleen and Dan's
behaviour, but as a result of the almost total lack of any discussion
about antiques, and the fact that WTB/FS adverts for modern crap are
submerging the group completely. Beatnik, whom you have supported, and
people like him are part of the problem. No, they *ARE* the problem.

Regards, Laurie.

and their advice seems to be heeded. That's a vast difference from the

I was looking for info. about some personal older items (191?,
and some newer) and noticed so many concerns about what should be
Antique and in this group. I figure myself and many others don't
really know that's why were looking here for insight.

I figure no one is making you read posts that are definetly not
about &quot;antiques&quot;. So why get your feathers rustled, just skip on
by and look at those things that really get your interest.

This group is rec.antiques, and in here we discuss antiques. That's
simple enough even for a clod like you, the only part that needs
explaining (although it shouldn't) is what is it that constitutes an
antique. We've already done that and argued about it, and it was agreed
many moons ago that *FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS GROUP* an antique could
be considered any item more than 50 years old. That doesn't even come
close to my view of what constitutes an antique, but we all have to
compromise.

"/>  On the face of it, this is a fair comment, and one that merits serious
consideration. However, it's fundamentally flawed.

Consider this: how many of the posts that this forum receives are
actually antique-related? Put another way, how many posts do I have to
ignore to read something relevant to the charter and name of the group,
and what is the proportion of antiques-related posts to the rubbish?

Consider too, the new reader on the net (and there are thousands every
day), who whilst excitedly scanning this new toy &quot;newsgroups&quot;, opens
rec.antiques expecting to read about antiques. What does he or she
find? Dozens of FS/WTB, dozens of posts about Barbie dolls, precious
moments and Coke trays. Oh yeah, and a pile of bitching and whining
from people who can't deal with being asked to stop posting all that
crap. What they don't find is very much about antiques.

So, what's the result of the two considerations above? They go away,
and they never bother coming back. And that, I suggest, is why there's
very little about antiques in here.

So please, consider that.

Cheers, Laurie.

&gt;I wouldn't know an antique if it jumped out of my

&gt;on with life. Maybe you should take up stamp
&gt;collecting.

"/> But stamp collecting has become a farce since countries simply print
the stamps for collectors instead of for use as true postage.

How many letters do you receive now with a lick 'n stick stamp on it ?

Nope...stamp collecting has been destroyed by commercialism.

BTW what age of postage stamp qualifies as an antique ?
