Islam: Cult or Religion?
By Ali Sina
Islam is known as the second largest religion. The very fact that 1.2 billion
people call themselves Muslims vests Islam with the mantel of legitimacy and
confirms the claim that it is a religion. But is it?
Can 1.2 billion people be wrong? Well, in logic we have something called
&quot;argumentum ad numerum&quot;. It states that something is true if a lot of people
believe in it. But argumentum ad numerum is a logical fallacy. Truth cannot be
established by the consensus of the majority. In fact many arguments have been
proven to be false, even though everyone in the world once accepted them as
true. For example, not until a few centuries ago everyone believed that the
Earth is flat and is at the centre of the universe. Despite that common belief
both geocentricity and the idea of the flat Earth were false. A false belief
does not become true even if everyone thinks they are true.
Therefore, not only 1.2 billion people, but the entire mankind can be wrong.
As Bertrand Russell said: &quot;The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no
evidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd; indeed in view of the
silliness of the majority of mankind, a widespread belief is more likely to be
foolish than sensible.&quot;   (Source)
After shattering the myth of argumentum ad numerum, let us put Islam under
scrutiny and see whether it is a religion or a cult.
The following is a description of what cult is:
1.      A cult is a religious group with extreme beliefs and practices -
beliefs that are often contrary to science and logic but they are believed as
&quot;obvious&quot; truth by the cult members.
2.      The members of cults often isolate themselves from friends, family and
society and use deceptive and unethical recruiting techniques
3.      Use manipulative methods to control the minds of followers
4.      Venerate a human leader or leaders
5.      Recruiting work is performed by all of the members
6.      People are not allowed to criticize the leader, the doctrine, or the
organization, or read information that is critical of the cult.
7.      Members are trained to reject and disbelieve criticism of the cult as
lies from Satan.
8.      Members spy on one another and report improper activities or comments
to leaders.
9.      Members are taught to suppress anything which might reflect negatively
to outsiders about the cult.
10.     The doctrine is absolutist and the ideology is internalized as &quot;the
Truth.&quot;
11.     Members are told to avoid contact with ex-members or critics, even
their relatives.
12.     Members are instilled with a deep fear about ever leaving the
organization, and anyone who does depart is of the devil and sometimes
severely punished.
13.     Members are emotional controlled and warned of being caught and
punished.
14.     Disciplinary action is administered by group leaders, which may
involve excommunication for such things as questioning organization policy or
doctrine.
15.     People are encouraged to sacrifice education, career and family
interests to server the interests of the cult.
16.     Advocate socializing only with other members in the organization and
avoiding outsiders.
17.     The belief in apocalypse and Dooms Day.
[Source]
All these traits are present in Islam.
1.      Islam claims to be a religion with strong devotion to Muhammad and a
set of unsubstantiated doctrines presented by him. Monotheism is used as a
pretext to exert absolute control over the believers, leaving them no chance
to question or investigate alternative paths.
2.      Muhammad forced his followers to leave their families (8:72) and
gathered them in Yathrib. He said: &quot;And those who believed but did not leave
their homes, ye have no duty to protect them till they leave their homes&quot;. He
warned those who did not follow him, leaving behind their families, will be
cursed by Allah and &quot;their habitation will be hell&quot;(4:97). Muhammad went as
far as to order his followers to murder those Muslims who defected his
barricade.(4:89)  In Yathrib he banished and killed the Jews who did not
believe in him, thus eliminating the chance of his followers coming in contact
with outsiders and being influenced by anyone. In this way he exerted absolute
control over the lives and the minds of his followers. Jim Jones did the same.
He called his town &quot;Jonestown&quot;. Muhammad changed the name of Yathirb to
Madinatul Nabi (Prophet's Town)
3.      He used manipulative methods to control the minds of his followers.
These methods ranged from threat of hellfire, and promises of paradise, to
exhaustive rituals of prayers and fasts, devised to numb the thought, and
threat of physical punishment including execution and constant warfare,
keeping his followers in perpetual state of agitation.
4.      He established himself as the sole authority among his followers and
the only source of guidance to the extent that they looked up to him for every
detail of their lives, including how to dress, how to shave, how to pray and
even how to urinate and how to clean after bowl movement. Ostensibly the
worship was to God but effectively he was the only object of veneration of his
followers and the only authority. Nominally God was to be obeyed but he was
God's proxy, thus assuming the authority of God.
5.      All believers were asked to promote his cause through Jihad,
propaganda or by giving generously from their wealth. 4:95, 9:20, 49:15, 61:11

6.      The criticism of Muhammad and Islam was totally prohibited and if
anyone dared to question him or his decisions, Omar swiftly unshielded his
sword and threatened to slash the throat of the intrepid questioner forcing
him to apologize. The message was sent in a very clear tone that no one must
question Muhammad and his authority. 1400 years later, the message remains the
same. If you question Islam you will be killed.
7.      Muslims are told to dismiss any criticism of Islam as coming from
Satan and they often avoid reading critical views about their Faith. I have
received testimonies of apostates who confessed that at first when they came
across this site they stopped reading it and dismissed it as the work of
Satan. See this I myself never read any book critical of Islam and once
frowned at a friend who expressed her curiosity about Salman Rushdie's Satanic
Verses.
8.      Muslims are encouraged to spy on each other and report any sign of
dissent. Amr bil Maroof wa Nahi anil Munkir (Commanding to follow the religion
and preventing from doing what is prohibited) is a tenet of Islam. Every
Muslim is required to poke his nose in the private lives of others, spy on
them and tell them what they should do and what they should not do. Every
Muslim is an enforcer of religion and the moral police for others.
9.      Muslims suppress anything that might present Islam in negative light.
Preserving the image of Islam is of utmost importance and Muslims lie with
clarity of conscience to misrepresent their religion and make it look good.
For example women in Islam are treated like animals and are considered as
deficient in intelligence. Every Muslim knows that including the women, who
blame the men for it but not the Islam. But they lie through their teeth
bragging about the &quot;elevated&quot; status of women in Islam. Jihad means aggressive
war to expand Islam. Every Muslim knows that. Yet all of them lie and say
Jihad means &quot;self defense&quot;. A couple of years ago I received a very angry
email from a Muslim who cursed me for revealing the fact that Muhammad had
slept with a 9-year old child and at the end he said &quot;the damage is already
done&quot; and I will be certainly punished for what I had done. The fact that
Muhammad slept with a child did not bother this Muslim but what bothered him
was revealing this fact.
10.     Islam is extremely absolutist and Muslims believe that it is the only
true religion. This &quot;truth&quot; however is not self evident. It is &quot;true&quot; because
Muhammad said so.
11.     Muslims are told to shun the apostates and the critics of Islam. New
converts are often circled and are isolated from their non-Muslim family and
friends. They are showered with love and receive a lot of emotional support
until the brainwashing is complete.
12.     Muslims are instilled with the fear of leaving Islam. This fear comes
in two forms. One is the fear of Hell and of eternal punishment and the other
is the fear of being caught and put to death by fellow Muslims, including
their best friends and family.
13.     Those who leave Islam must live in constant threat of being discovered
and killed. In Muslims' Comments section of this site you can see that Muslims
often talk about this fear and say they pity me for having to look over my
shoulders all the time and live in fear of being assassinated. The values are
so distorted that they do not pity themselves for being the assassins but pity
me for having to live in their fear.
14.     In Islam disciplinary action includes beating, maiming, stoning,
beheading or jail. Excommunication is for minor offenses. The poet Ka'b and
two others were excommunicated for fifty days and during that time no one
spoke to them. Ka'b's wife was told to leave him and wherever he went people
ignored him as if he was invisible. All this, because he did not accompany
Muhammad in the war of Tabutk.
15.     Muslims are told to sacrifice their comfort, their wealth and
including their lives to promote Islam. Young men are encouraged to leave
their studies and work, wage Jihad, and commit suicide bombing to make Islam
dominant. Family and even children are regarded as &quot;tests&quot; of the believers.
To prove their loyalty to Allah, they must be able to forgo all these &quot;worldly
attachments&quot; and get ready to sacrifice their lives in the cause of Islam.
16.     Muslims are discouraged to take friends from amongst
