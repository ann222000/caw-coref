He's a cipher,
a blunt instrument in the hands of government.

James Bond is a healthy, violent, noncerebral
man in his middle thirties, and a creature of his era. I wouldn't say he's
particularly typical of our times, but he is certainly of the times. Bond's
detached; he's disengaged. But he's a believable man - around whom I try to
weave a great web of excitement and fantasy

I very much wanted to win. I was on my way to America with the Director of
Naval Intelligence, Admiral Godfrey. We were in Estoril in Portugal, and
while we were waiting for transport, we killed some time in the casino.
While there, I recognised some German agents, and I thought it would be a
brilliant coup to play with them, break them, take their money. Instead, of
course, they took mine. Most embarrassing. This incident appears in Casino
Royale, my first book - but, of course, Bond does not lose. In fact, he
totally and coldly vanquishes his opponent.

FLEMING: I closed down SMERSH, although I was devoted to the good old
apparat, because, first of all, Khrushchev did in fact disband SMERSH
himself, although its operations are still carried out by a subsection of
the K.G.B., the Russian secret service. But in that book - I think it was
Thunderball that I was writing at the time of the proposed summit meeting -
I thought well, it's no good going on if we're going to make friends with
the Russians. I know them, I like them personally, as anyone would, as
anyone would like the Chinese if he knew them. I thought, I don't want to go
on ragging them like this. So I invented SPECTRE as an international crime
organisation which contained elements of SMERSH and the Gestapo and the
Mafia - the cosy old Cosa Nostra - which, of course, is a much more elastic
fictional device than SMERSH, which was no fictional device, but the real
thing. But that was really the reason I did it, so as not to rag the
Russians too much. But if they go on squeezing off cyanide pistols in
people's faces, I may have to make them cosa mia again.
