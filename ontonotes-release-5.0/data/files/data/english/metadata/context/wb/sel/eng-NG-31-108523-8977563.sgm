Ref. http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov
NASA says laser ranging to corner reflectors on the moon has
determined that the moon is receding at 3.8 cm/year. This remark is
puzzling:
&quot;Even under good atmospheric viewing conditions, only one
photon is received every few seconds&quot;.

With a signal that bad, how could they determine the range to within,
say, 1.0 cm out of about  4*10^10 cm? It would seem they would try to
time the onset of the return pulse and do lengthy cross-correlation,
but it's hard to say there is even a  signal.

It would be hard to test for the presence of the Pioneer effect with
such a poor signal. Using a Doppler radar signal would seem to be a
better idea, because the range to the moon is only about 1/40,000th of
the distance to the Pioneer at max range and the team was able to
detect minute changes in the Doppler velocity. (Of course, Pioneer
re-transmitted its signal at 7 watts).

Distance ranging is a function of wavelength.  Using radar is not
going to get the accuracy sought.

Maybe we can dust the reflectors off when we get there...

As far as &quot;Pioneer effect&quot;, are you talking about a Sunward
acceleration, or an Earthward acceleration?  Finding an anomalous
Earthward acceleration from the loss of Earth's rotational speed (and
the consequent boost of the Moon's altitude) might be problematic.

What's the difference between

and
http://www.androcles01.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Doppler/EinsteinShift.bmp ???

It would be hard to test for the presence of the Pioneer non-effect with
such a poor physicist.

Not so. Doppler radar would be ideal for this because they are testing
for an orbit *velocity* of 3.8cm/yr and the Doppler could run for
hours continually correlating, which is what you would need to extract
signal from noise. That's just basic information theory.

Not at all. I have my own solution to the anomaly. I was just looking

Now it's looking to me that the vaunted accuracy may not even be true.
I've seen it stated that general relativity is even more accurate than

After all my protestations, the remark about the 1 photon must be a
joke or an author's guess. I still don't think it could be done under
those conditions. But the arxiv above is well done and convincing, but
does not discuss the inevitable statistical problems.
It would be nice to see a diagram of the operation.

&gt; &gt;&gt; laser?

&gt; &gt;Multiple sites, mutiple firings.

&gt; Is there a  practical number of firings that could funnel a
&gt; microseconds wide pulse down to 3e-13 seconds?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It would be hard to test for the presence of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Pioneer effect with such a poor signal. Using a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Doppler radar signal would seem to be a better
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; idea, because the range to the moon is only
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about 1/40,000th of the distance to the Pioneer
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; at max range and the team was able to detect
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; minute changes in the Doppler velocity. (Of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; course, Pioneer re-transmitted its signal at 7
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; watts).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Distance ranging is a function of wavelength.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Using radar is not going to get the accuracy
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;sought.

&gt; This should really be done with velocity ranging as velocity is the
&gt; goal; the difference is profound, as explained just below. The Pioneer
&gt; used big arrays at  2.3GHz (13 cm) when the Pioneer was 10 billion km
&gt; away, detecting 8e-10m/ss acceleration.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Not so. Doppler radar would be ideal for this
&gt; &gt;&gt; because they are testing for an orbit *velocity*
&gt; &gt;&gt; of 3.8cm/yr and the Doppler could run for
&gt; &gt;&gt; hours continually correlating, which is what you
&gt; &gt;&gt; would need to extract signal from noise. That's
&gt; &gt;&gt; just basic information theory.

&gt; &gt;The Moon is travelling at several kilometers per second.  The Earth
&gt; &gt;station is similarly travelling at a kilometer per second.  The Moon,
&gt; &gt;when LLR is fired is not always directly overhead.  Your accuracy is
&gt; &gt;still limited by your wavelength.

&gt; Why do you keep saying that?

&gt; &gt;Can &quot;you&quot; collimate a radar beam to
&gt; &gt;be only a &quot;mile&quot; wide when it hits the Moon, after passing through our
&gt; &gt;atmosphere?

&gt; I don't see the need even for corner reflectors althought the WL 13cm
&gt; is about the size of the retroreflector.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Maybe we can dust the reflectors off when we
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;get there...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;As far as &quot;Pioneer effect&quot;, are you talking about
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;a Sunward acceleration, or an Earthward
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;acceleration?  Finding an anomalous Earthward
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;acceleration from the loss of Earth's rotational
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;speed (and the consequent boost of the Moon's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;altitude) might be problematic.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Not at all. I have my own solution to the anomaly.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I was just looking to this moon finding to prove /
&gt; &gt;&gt; disprove whether the Pioneer effect could influence
&gt; &gt;&gt; solar system objects.

&gt; &gt;Solar system objects have RTGs, leaks, are asymmetrically shaped, and
&gt; &gt;are heading outsystem at a good clip?  Cassini has passed the point
&gt; &gt;where Pioneer's effect was onset.  Cassini was designed not to
&gt; &gt;generate expected causes of the anomaly.  Cassini did not show the
&gt; &gt;anomaly.

&gt; Was cassini

&gt; &gt; http://de.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0203151

&gt; &gt;&gt; Now it's looking to me that the vaunted accuracy
&gt; &gt;&gt; may not even be true.  I've seen it stated that
&gt; &gt;&gt; general relativity is even more accurate than this
&gt; &gt;&gt; measurement.

&gt; &gt;Accuracy is only decimal places.  What Nature actually does must be
&gt; &gt;verified by measurement.  Because theories are not &quot;right&quot;, just not
&gt; &gt;yet proven wrong.

&gt; &gt;&gt; This example might be flakier than the 1917 eclipse
&gt; &gt;&gt; viewed with the 4&quot; telescope.  1/5th of a photon per
&gt; &gt;&gt; second. It's not enough.

&gt; &gt;In your opinion.  Repeat the experiment from multiple sites, thousands
&gt; &gt;of times.  The major remaining source of uncertainty is likely our
&gt; &gt;atmosphere, and its average index of refraction over the outbound and
&gt; &gt;inbound paths.

&gt; &gt;David A. Smith

&gt; After all my protestations, the remark about the 1 photon must be a
&gt; joke or an author's guess. I still don't think it could be done under
&gt; those conditions. But the arxiv above is well done and convincing, but
&gt; does not discuss the inevitable statistical problems.
&gt; It would be nice to see a diagram of the operation.

Because we still have nothing of any science instruments station

Finally somebody posting the &quot;correct&quot; answer.

The only modification I would make is to your statement about &quot;picosecond&quot;
accuracy. There is no need to transform this into the time domain. The
accuracy of the measurement is purely a function of the wavelength of the
light. Dividing a distance by c to get a time error and then multiplying the
time error by c to get a distance measurement is redundant.

Unless you can measure relative phase (which you can't do with a single
photon) the underlying accuracy of the distance measurement is comparable to
the the wavelength of the light - perhaps 500 nM to 1000 nM. All the rest is
practical limitations.

erroneous.  Second, the &quot;out of 4*10^10 cm&quot; part of the question is
not really relevant since the accuracy of the experiment depends on

The time tagging receiver has an active time interval of 400 nsec for

photons must arrive in a very tight time window, very tight angular
aperture, and very tight wavelength band.  All of these cuts serve to
reduce background to such a degree that a very large fraction of
received photons are real ranging photons.

The Doppler method is sensitive to velocity and velocity *change*.  It
took approximately a decade of data to detect and confirm the velocity
change of the Pioneer effect (not 1.38 seconds).  In practice, I
believe the doppler technique can detect absolute line of sight
velocities of ~0.1 mm/s at best, which is woefully inaccurate for the

It's unclear where such arrays would be (do you mean the Earth? the

&gt;&gt; &gt;  (a) It is possible to measure the arrival time of a photon very
&gt;&gt; &gt;  accurately, probably at the picosecond level for &quot;stopwatch&quot; type of
&gt;&gt; &gt;  measurements measurements.
&gt;&gt; Pulse width is 200 ps; power is 1500 mJ @ 10 Hz with .075microradian
&gt;&gt; beamwidth. They used a spinning disk as the T/R &quot;switch&quot;
&gt;&gt; Time resolution with a 10 Mhz clock and 4 plus 4 verniers is stated as
&gt;&gt; 50 psec.
&gt;&gt; 1cm of double range is about 66 psec.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  (b) The difficulty is not in the relative ranging, so whether it is
&gt;&gt; &gt;  1 cm out of 1e10 or 4e10 is not relevant.
&gt;&gt;    ?

&gt;It was you who questioned, &quot;with a signal that bad, how could they
&gt;determined the range to within, say, 1.0 cm out of 4*10^10 cm?&quot;
&gt;First, the premise of your question, that the signal was &quot;bad&quot; was
&gt;erroneous.  Second, the &quot;out of 4*10^10 cm&quot; part of the question is
&gt;not really relevant since the accuracy of the experiment depends on
&gt;the precision of time tagging (and modeling), and not on the distance
&gt;to the moon.  For example, the same basic ~tens of picosecond
&gt;precisions are achieved for spacecraft laser ranging.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  (c) The real issue is whether a single photon arriving from a
&gt;&gt; &gt;  distant source is really that source or a contaminating background
&gt;&gt; &gt;  photon.  The experimenters have carefully tuned the apparatus so
&gt;&gt; &gt;  that only photons within a narrow time and wavelength window are
&gt;&gt; &gt;  permitted, so the background contamination is exceedingly small.
&gt;&gt; &gt;  I.e. the return signal is still whoppingly bright compared to the
&gt;&gt; &gt;  background level.
&gt;&gt; It's hard to believe some of the specifications: 1500mJ must be 1.5J
&gt;&gt; (not megaJ) because even then, at 200ps pulse width, the peak laser
&gt;&gt; power would be 7,500 megawatts, but avg power of 15W. If it's
&gt;&gt; megajoules, avg power is 15,000 megawatts average and that doesn't
&gt;&gt; seem possible.

&gt;What you find hard to believe is not really relevant.  The McDonald
&gt;printed laser properties are consistent with the properties of other
&gt;laser ranging stations.
">

Craig you keep reading me wrong. It's not about my belief. (Your minor
in psychology will get you nothing but trouble).
I should have been explicit: I didnt know whether they meant
millijoules or megajoules, so I made the two calculations, so as to
rule one out. I'm going with 15W (but that can't be right).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It's hard to believe the .075 microradian beam width, because on
&gt;&gt; arrival at the moon the spot would span 28 meters. (Another article
&gt;&gt; mentioned &quot;4 miles wide&quot;-author's embellishment?). The required aiming
&gt;&gt; accuracy is unbelievable, certainly requiring better than .075
&gt;&gt; microradians. How accomplish that?

If the 28 meters is right, I think it's easy to show that there will
be lots and lots of photons coming back. I don't have the time firhgt
now to do the calculation.

&gt;It's not clear how the 0.075 microradian figure is derived (for
&gt;example, whether that is a property of the laser or the telescope
&gt;system), or perhaps whether it is a typo.  The newer site logs list 0
&gt;to 20 arcsec as the divergence, which is about 0 to 96 microrad.
&gt;Perhaps the older document was meant to say 75 microrad (in any case,
&gt;it is adjustable).

&gt;&gt; &gt;(The time window is of order 400 ns. &gt;While this
&gt;&gt; &gt;  is small, the window still allows ~0.1 km of variation in the lunar
&gt;&gt; &gt;  range, which is huge.  The wavelength window is also small because
&gt;&gt; &gt;  they are using a monochromatic laser).

&gt;&gt; What is a time window? 400 ns is 2000 times their 200 ps pulse width.

&gt;The time tagging receiver has an active time interval of 400 nsec for
&gt;each pulse.  I.e. for a 10 Hz pulse repetition rate, the receiver is
&gt;active for 4 usec out of each second, hence the background level is
&gt;reduced by a factor 250,000.  Furthermore, the receive aperture has a
&gt;selectable field of view which can reduce background.

&gt;The point is that the background is extremely small -- smaller than
&gt;one photon per 400 nsec time interval -- so the detection of a given
&gt;photon is very likely to be a &quot;return&quot; photon.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  (d) The experimenters do *not* use a single photon arrival time, but
&gt;&gt; &gt;  rather the average of many arrival times, since a *train* of pulses
&gt;&gt; &gt;  is sent up and then received.  This improves the precision.

&gt;&gt; The article implied that the return signal strength approximated 1
&gt;&gt; photon every few seconds (&quot;not that time, not that time, oh there's
&gt;&gt; one&quot;). That is probably nonsense.

Here is a rough calculation (pure geometry, no dispersion) of the
power back to earth. I calculate a huge number of photons per second,
6e22/sec, putting the lie to the /14 photon/sec that everyone was
assuring me was standard practice, especially as was mentioned, yhsy
the photons were so bright (or something).

We send a very narrow beam .075urad to the moon, but it is further
narrowed by the small size of the mirror, say .5m, so the effective
angle is given by
dmoon * .075urad = 28m subtended at moon
mirror is only .5 m = 1/56th of beam
mirror traps only 1/56^2 = .00032    fraction
The retroreflectors are tantamount to holes in the wall so the beam
bounces back making a double trip  and makes a spot here of 2 x the
mirror or 1m (assumed). (Don't  move). We sent peak pulses of (net)
7500 megawatts x .00032 = 2.4megawatts
The returned  image here is twice x mirror, via hole in the wall
effect, or 1m
The power density is
Pd = 2.4e6W/1m^2 =2.4e6 J/s/m^2

Find electric field back at station:
This should be an enormous electric field (?):
.5EH = .5E^2/Z = 2.4e6W/m^2 = energy density
It isn't:       E = 2.4V/m field strength
Conver this to photons per second:
Emission is at 532 nm and E = hc/lambda per photon.
Ep = 3.733e-19J/photon
Power density = 2.4e6J/s/m^2   Divide by Ep
2.08e6/3.733e-19 = 6.43e24 ph/s/m^2
Assume receptor is .1m square, giving
6.43e22 photons per second.
It's a number hard to believe, and hard to disbelieve. All this talk
of 1/4 photon per second is on a &quot;stands to reason&quot; basis.
At least that's the way I have it figured out.
Someone please check it out.

&gt; Here is a rough calculation (pure geometry, no dispersion) of the
&gt; power back to earth. I calculate a huge number of photons per second,
&gt; 6e22/sec, putting the lie to the /14 photon/sec that everyone was
&gt; assuring me was standard practice, especially as was mentioned, yhsy
&gt; the photons were so bright (or something).

&gt; We send a very narrow beam .075urad to the moon, but it is further
&gt; narrowed by the small size of the mirror, say .5m, so the effective
&gt; angle is given by
&gt; dmoon * .075urad = 28m subtended at moon
&gt; mirror is only .5 m = 1/56th of beam
&gt; mirror traps only 1/56^2 = .00032    fraction
&gt; The retroreflectors are tantamount to holes in the wall so the beam
&gt; bounces back making a double trip  and makes a spot here of 2 x the
&gt; mirror or 1m (assumed).
">

Here is the error.

The reflector on the moon is an aperture, and the return beam angle will be
diffraction limitted.

With a 1m reflector, the diameter of the central lobe on earth will be:

spot diameter = dist to moon x wavelength of light / mirror size

=  400,000 * 1000 x 500 * 10^9 / 1
= 2*10^2
= 200m

This is 100 times the figure you estimated, reducing the intensity back on
earth by a factor of 10^4 more than you calculated. If the mirrors in the
reflector are not aligned perpendicularly to much less than the wavelength
of light, the losses also increase dramatically. Such precision is extremely
difficult on a portable device that can withstand 8g acceleration and be
dumped on the ground by an astronaut. Note, also, that the intensity of the
return beam goes as the fourth power of the reflector diameter. You really
need to know the real world size, collimation and performance of the
reflectors to make a calculation - you are looking at possibly several more
orders of magnitude deriving from these systemic errors in your calculation,
in addition to the more obvious error of a 10^4 factor.

There may well be other errors, but this one is pretty obvious.

Here's another systemic error. The photon pulse is 0.00032 x 3 * 10^8 metres
long, or about 96,000 metres long. Only the first few centimetres are useful
for ranging. This reduces the number of usable electrons by a factor of
about 10^8.

So diffraction effects from the mirror reduce the photon intensity by about
10^6, and the usable &quot;exposure time&quot; reduces it by a factor of 10^8, so the
identified systemic errors so far in your analysis add up to a factor of
10^14 alone.

As I said, there may be more systemic errors before we even start
considering real world performance of lasers, mirrors, and detectors.

Of course, we know the actual number of photons received, because it has
been measured. So this is really just a textbook calculation in quantum
optics. If you find a huge error in the theory of optics that shows that it
doesn't correctly predict the number of returned photons, post it here. The
analysis you provided above obviously doesn't show any such error, because
it is massively wrong (by at least a factor of 10^14).

I disagree. Just to go along with your diffraction theme, I calculated
that at range Dmoon, the first quarter wave diffraction null would
occur at .026urad off axis, inside the .0375urad half cone of
transmission, so 1 diffraction ring. Calculating everything from first
principles, (as is my practice):
Dmoon(1-cos phi) = lambda/4
phi = .026urad
But it still does not invalidate my calculation, certainly not to
enlarge the patch on earth. The EM waves do not cancel, there is
superposition.

These are not mirrors, but an array of small glass prisms which are

&gt; &gt;It was you who questioned, &quot;with a signal that bad, how could they

&gt; &gt;First, the premise of your question, that the signal was &quot;bad&quot; was
&gt; &gt;erroneous.  Second, the &quot;out of 4*10^10 cm&quot; part of the question is
&gt; &gt;not really relevant since the accuracy of the experiment depends on
&gt; &gt;the precision of time tagging (and modeling), and not on the distance

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  photon.  The experimenters have carefully tuned the apparatus so
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  that only photons within a narrow time and wavelength window are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  permitted, so the background contamination is exceedingly small.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  I.e. the return signal is still whoppingly bright compared to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  background level.
&gt; &gt;&gt; It's hard to believe some of the specifications: 1500mJ must be 1.5J
&gt; &gt;&gt; (not megaJ) because even then, at 200ps pulse width, the peak laser
&gt; &gt;&gt; power would be 7,500 megawatts, but avg power of 15W. If it's
&gt; &gt;&gt; megajoules, avg power is 15,000 megawatts average and that doesn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; seem possible.

&gt; &gt;What you find hard to believe is not really relevant.  The McDonald
&gt; &gt;printed laser properties are consistent with the properties of other
&gt; &gt;laser ranging stations.
&gt; Craig you keep reading me wrong. It's not about my belief. (Your minor

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It would be hard to test for the presence of the Pioneer effect with
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; such a poor signal. Using a Doppler radar signal would seem to be a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; better idea, because the range to the moon is only about 1/40,000th of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the distance to the Pioneer at max range and the team was able to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; detect minute changes in the Doppler velocity. (Of course, Pioneer
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; re-transmitted its signal at 7 watts).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   (e) The experiment is lunar *ranging*, not doppler velocity
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   measurements.

&gt; &gt;&gt; But the significant finding is the detection of radial velocity,
&gt; &gt;&gt; namely 3.8cm/yr. With Doppler and phaselocking you can &quot;sit on the
&gt; &gt;&gt; signal&quot; for hours and get astonishing accuracies typical of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; Pioneer venture.

&gt; &gt;By all means, proceed with your experiment!

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  Doppler is accurate to perhaps 0.01 mm/s at its
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   best, but this is not nearly accurate enough to detect the signals
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   of ~0.1 mm *PER YEAR* the experimenters are looking for.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Pioneer team were able to detect the minute acceleration, Ap, of
&gt; &gt;&gt; 8e-10mss, which, multiplied by only 1.38 seconds would equal the
&gt; &gt;&gt; target 3.8 cm/yr. From that standpoint, Doppler is grossly
&gt; &gt;&gt; overqualified.

&gt; &gt;The Doppler method is sensitive to velocity and velocity *change*.  It
&gt; &gt;took approximately a decade of data to detect and confirm the velocity
&gt; &gt;change of the Pioneer effect (not 1.38 seconds).  In practice, I
&gt; &gt;believe the doppler technique can detect absolute line of sight
&gt; &gt;velocities of ~0.1 mm/s at best, which is woefully inaccurate for the
&gt; &gt;lunar ranging effects.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   For that matter there aren't any radio re-transponders on the moon's surface
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   for this purpose.
&gt; &gt;&gt; You don't need retroreflectors for radar; the large area arrays can
&gt; &gt;&gt; (and did) handle small signals for Pioneer.

&gt; &gt;It's unclear where such arrays would be (do you mean the Earth? the
&gt; &gt;Moon?)  Transporting anything large to the Moon is very difficult and
&gt; &gt;very expensive.  Transporting a retroreflector is only difficult and
&gt; &gt;expensive.  In any case, no such arrays or retransponders exist on the
&gt; &gt;moon today so your supposition is rather moot.

&gt; &gt;&gt; There's enough arithmetic to keep everybody busy, but I think I've
&gt; &gt;&gt; done my share and have highlighted some monstrous claims that must
&gt; &gt;&gt; have been confected by the authors.

&gt; &gt;Your description of &quot;monstrous claims&quot; are unsubstantiated, as
&gt; &gt;outlined above.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   The Pioneer measurements do not solve &quot;range&quot; but rather a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   trajectory through the solar system which is consistent with the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   doppler velocity measurements.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh, come now! Take it easy. I'm just learning.

&gt; &gt;I find that hard to believe.  You've been taking whacks at the Pioneer

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you for your assessment, and especially your declension into 5
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; genera of confusion a-e, but I believe it's misplaced. We were all

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; few radar pulses. We tried to work with that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, I found a URL that has the equipment specifications to help

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the discussion: http://cddisa.csfc.nasa.gov
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Equipment spec is dated 1994

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The web site address you linked is incorrect.  More recent information

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All I get is a map of the stations round the world from your site.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I goofed the URL; it's complicated: good luck.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;OK I found the error in the URL. The below should take you to the

&gt;&gt;&gt; Here is a rough calculation (pure geometry, no dispersion) of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; power back to earth. I calculate a huge number of photons per second,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6e22/sec, putting the lie to the /14 photon/sec that everyone was
&gt;&gt;&gt; assuring me was standard practice, especially as was mentioned, yhsy
&gt;&gt;&gt; the photons were so bright (or something).

&gt;&gt;&gt; We send a very narrow beam .075urad to the moon, but it is further
&gt;&gt;&gt; narrowed by the small size of the mirror, say .5m, so the effective
&gt;&gt;&gt; angle is given by
&gt;&gt;&gt; dmoon * .075urad = 28m subtended at moon
&gt;&gt;&gt; mirror is only .5 m = 1/56th of beam
&gt;&gt;&gt; mirror traps only 1/56^2 = .00032    fraction
&gt;&gt;&gt; The retroreflectors are tantamount to holes in the wall so the beam
&gt;&gt;&gt; bounces back making a double trip  and makes a spot here of 2 x the
&gt;&gt;&gt; mirror or 1m (assumed).

&gt;&gt;Here is the error.

&gt;&gt;The reflector on the moon is an aperture, and the return beam angle will
&gt;&gt;be
&gt;&gt;diffraction limitted.

&gt; Diffraction limited?  You'll have to explain that more. The aperture
&gt; is 1,880,000 wavelengths wide. We're not trying to form images, so
&gt; diffraction isn't in it, in my opinion.
">

Well, your opinion is wrong.

You almost got this correct when you likened the mirrors to a hole, and the
reflected light being the area illuminated by the hole. You used this to
calculate the image on earth of the hole would be twice as large as the
hole.

This is not correct. It is true for a near field image, but at far field the
hole acts as a &quot;single slit&quot; and returns a diffraction pattern (just like
any other aperture light source).

&gt;&gt;With a 1m reflector, the diameter of the central lobe on earth will be:

&gt;&gt;spot diameter = dist to moon x wavelength of light / mirror size

&gt;&gt;=  400,000 * 1000 x 500 * 10^9 / 1
&gt;&gt;= 2*10^2
&gt;&gt;= 200m
&gt; That sounds like it's right out of the cookbook.
&gt; I disagree. Just to go along with your diffraction theme, I calculated
&gt; that at range Dmoon, the first quarter wave diffraction null would
&gt; occur at .026urad off axis, inside the .0375urad half cone of
&gt; transmission, so 1 diffraction ring. Calculating everything from first
&gt; principles, (as is my practice):
&gt; Dmoon(1-cos phi) = lambda/4
&gt; phi = .026urad
&gt; But it still does not invalidate my calculation, certainly not to
&gt; enlarge the patch on earth. The EM waves do not cancel, there is
&gt; superposition.

It does. And I calculated it from first principes as well. I just didn't
bother converting it to angles, which is a redundant step. Your calculation
should give the same spot size on earth as mine. Why not do it?

&gt;&gt;This is 100 times the figure you estimated, reducing the intensity back on
&gt;&gt;earth by a factor of 10^4 more than you calculated. If the mirrors in the
&gt;&gt;reflector are not aligned perpendicularly to much less than the wavelength
&gt;&gt;of light, the losses also increase dramatically. Such precision is
&gt;&gt;extremely
&gt;&gt;difficult on a portable device that can withstand 8g acceleration and be
&gt;&gt;dumped on the ground by an astronaut.

&gt; These are not mirrors, but an array of small glass prisms which are
&gt; sturdy, and corner reflectors are mathematically immune to alignment
&gt; errors. (See my paper in October 1967 Journal of the Optical Society
&gt; where I innovated mathematics for use, initially in connection with
&gt; alignment of a Porro prism at the top of an inertial guidance system).

Whether they are prisms or a single set of three mirrors makes no
difference. I don't really care that you wrote a paper in 1967 talking about
prisms.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Note, also, that the intensity of the
&gt;&gt;return beam goes as the fourth power of the reflector diameter.

&gt; Please prove the last statement. The intensity of the beam is a point
&gt; function having nothing to do with mirror size.
">

The amount of light impinging the mirror varies as the square of the
diameter. The diameter of the principle diffraction lobe varies lineraly
with diameter, so the energy flux per unit of area varies as the square.
Together the return energy flux per unit of area varies as the fourth power
of the reflector diameter.

&gt;&gt;You really

&gt;&gt;more
&gt;&gt;orders of magnitude deriving from these systemic errors in your
&gt;&gt;calculation,
&gt;&gt;in addition to the more obvious error of a 10^4 factor.

&gt;&gt;There may well be other errors, but this one is pretty obvious.
&gt; It has to be obvious after serious reconsideration.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 7500 megawatts x .00032 = 2.4megawatts
&gt;&gt;&gt; The returned  image here is twice x mirror, via hole in the wall
&gt;&gt;&gt; effect, or 1m
&gt;&gt;&gt; The power density is
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pd = 2.4e6W/1m^2 =2.4e6 J/s/m^2

&gt;&gt;&gt; Find electric field back at station:
&gt;&gt;&gt; This should be an enormous electric field (?):
&gt;&gt;&gt; .5EH = .5E^2/Z = 2.4e6W/m^2 = energy density
&gt;&gt;&gt; It isn't: E = 2.4V/m field strength
&gt;&gt;&gt; Conver this to photons per second:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Emission is at 532 nm and E = hc/lambda per photon.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ep = 3.733e-19J/photon
&gt;&gt;&gt; Power density = 2.4e6J/s/m^2   Divide by Ep
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.08e6/3.733e-19 = 6.43e24 ph/s/m^2
&gt;&gt;&gt; Assume receptor is .1m square, giving
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6.43e22 photons per second.

&gt;&gt;If the reflector is 0.1m squared, the systemic error of 10^4 becomes a
&gt;&gt;systemic error of 10^6 (I assumed 1 sqm reflectors).
&gt; Re-read to see the receptor is assumed to be  .1m, and the
&gt; retroreflectors I reckoned as .5m and disposed of it in the first
&gt; attenuation of .0003.

I assumed the 0.0003 was the pulse duration in your above claculations.

If its not, where does the pulse duration appear? Its clearly critical,
because only the first tenth of a nanoseond or two of the pulse is of use in
ranging. (This is not strictly true, as they may modulate the laser signal
to overlay a signal which they detect. This is is the same thing except in
the frequency domain instead of the time domain - the mathematical effect is
exactly the same).

I didn't know the whole pulse was only 200 pS long. I am very surprised they

Yep, for example:

Pulsed ND Yag laser, pulsed at 10 Hz with a 200 ps duty cycle.  Those
parameters appear to be pretty standard (though the peak power varies
from one station to another).

Also, the beam-width of most laser systems reported on that page

Interesting. On a technbicality, it says the output is 200 pS, not the
return signal. Still it can't be much worse than that, or they wouldn't
bother getting it down that low. I guess you need it for centimetre
accuracy.

By my calculation they should get about 1.3 microradians. The light
wavelength is 1000 nM = 10^-6; the aperture is 0.75, divide them and out it
pops.

The tricky thing is how they get the laser beam to diverge to illuminate the
telescope primary. There is a lot of power going through a very small area
at the front end of whatever optical device they use. Maybe this imposes
losses.

Still, an interesting link; thank you for posting it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here is a rough calculation (pure geometry, no dispersion) of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; power back to earth. I calculate a huge number of photons per second,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6e22/sec, putting the lie to the /14 photon/sec that everyone was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assuring me was standard practice, especially as was mentioned, yhsy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the photons were so bright (or something).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We send a very narrow beam .075urad to the moon, but it is further
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; narrowed by the small size of the mirror, say .5m, so the effective
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; angle is given by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dmoon * .075urad = 28m subtended at moon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mirror is only .5 m = 1/56th of beam
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mirror traps only 1/56^2 = .00032    fraction
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The retroreflectors are tantamount to holes in the wall so the beam
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bounces back making a double trip  and makes a spot here of 2 x the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mirror or 1m (assumed).

&gt;&gt;&gt;Here is the error.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The reflector on the moon is an aperture, and the return beam angle will
&gt;&gt;&gt;be
&gt;&gt;&gt;diffraction limitted.

&gt;&gt; Diffraction limited?  You'll have to explain that more. The aperture
&gt;&gt; is 1,880,000 wavelengths wide. We're not trying to form images, so
&gt;&gt; diffraction isn't in it, in my opinion.

&gt;Well, your opinion is wrong.

&gt;You almost got this correct when you likened the mirrors to a hole, and the
&gt;reflected light being the area illuminated by the hole. You used this to
&gt;calculate the image on earth of the hole would be twice as large as the
&gt;hole.

&gt;This is not correct. It is true for a near field image, but at far field the
&gt;hole acts as a &quot;single slit&quot; and returns a diffraction pattern (just like
&gt;any other aperture light source).

A 1 meter mirror might be a slit for a 1 meter radar wavelength, but
it's no longer a slit at 532 nm wavelength.

&gt;&gt;&gt;With a 1m reflector, the diameter of the central lobe on earth will be:

&gt;&gt;&gt;spot diameter = dist to moon x wavelength of light / mirror size

&gt;&gt;&gt;=  400,000 * 1000 x 500 * 10^9 / 1
&gt;&gt;&gt;= 2*10^2
&gt;&gt;&gt;= 200m
&gt;&gt; That sounds like it's right out of the cookbook.
&gt;&gt; I disagree. Just to go along with your diffraction theme, I calculated
&gt;&gt; that at range Dmoon, the first quarter wave diffraction null would
&gt;&gt; occur at .026urad off axis, inside the .0375urad half cone of
&gt;&gt; transmission, so 1 diffraction ring. Calculating everything from first
&gt;&gt; principles, (as is my practice):
&gt;&gt; Dmoon(1-cos phi) = lambda/4
&gt;&gt; phi = .026urad
&gt;&gt; But it still does not invalidate my calculation, certainly not to
&gt;&gt; enlarge the patch on earth. The EM waves do not cancel, there is
&gt;&gt; superposition.

&gt;It does. And I calculated it from first principes as well. I just didn't
&gt;bother converting it to angles, which is a redundant step. Your calculation
&gt;should give the same spot size on earth as mine. Why not do it?
">

Diffraction interference and rings arise from change in pathlength,
being proportional to Dmoon x vers theta  (vers being 1-cos)= lambda/4
(or 2).

I shortchanged my self there, because the first ring at phi = .026urad
lies not inside a .0375urad laser cone but one that's 56 times smaller
so it would occur completely outside the reduced cone. (Light patch is
28m vs .5m of the mirror, defining the effective cone).

&gt;&gt;&gt;This is 100 times the figure you estimated, reducing the intensity back on

&gt;&gt;&gt;of light, the losses also increase dramatically. Such precision is
&gt;&gt;&gt;extremely
&gt;&gt;&gt;difficult on a portable device that can withstand 8g acceleration and be
&gt;&gt;&gt;dumped on the ground by an astronaut.

&gt;&gt; These are not mirrors, but an array of small glass prisms which are
&gt;&gt; sturdy, and corner reflectors are mathematically immune to alignment
&gt;&gt; errors. (See my paper in October 1967 Journal of the Optical Society
&gt;&gt; where I innovated mathematics for use, initially in connection with
&gt;&gt; alignment of a Porro prism at the top of an inertial guidance system).

&gt;Whether they are prisms or a single set of three mirrors makes no
&gt;difference. I don't really care that you wrote a paper in 1967 talking about
&gt;prisms.

reflectors.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Note, also, that the intensity of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;return beam goes as the fourth power of the reflector diameter.

&gt;&gt; Please prove the last statement. The intensity of the beam is a point
&gt;&gt; function having nothing to do with mirror size.

&gt;The amount of light impinging the mirror varies as the square of the
&gt;diameter. The diameter of the principle diffraction lobe varies lineraly
&gt;with diameter, so the energy flux per unit of area varies as the square.
&gt;Together the return energy flux per unit of area varies as the fourth power
&gt;of the reflector diameter.
">

Here's your arithmetic:
fden x mir^2 = flux
lobe = Kmir. So
fden x (lobe/K)^2 = flux
mir and lobe/K are interchangeable. f and fden at the mirror are
unchanged. There's no 4th power.

The light is not absorbed and reradiated. It just goes through the
virtual hole that is the mirror and makes another traverse of Dmoon
back to earth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You really

&gt;&gt;&gt;more
&gt;&gt;&gt;orders of magnitude deriving from these systemic errors in your
&gt;&gt;&gt;calculation,
&gt;&gt;&gt;in addition to the more obvious error of a 10^4 factor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;There may well be other errors, but this one is pretty obvious.
&gt;&gt; It has to be obvious after serious reconsideration.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Don't  move). We sent peak pulses of (net)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Find electric field back at station:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This should be an enormous electric field (?):
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .5EH = .5E^2/Z = 2.4e6W/m^2 = energy density
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It isn't: E = 2.4V/m field strength
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Conver this to photons per second:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Emission is at 532 nm and E = hc/lambda per photon.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ep = 3.733e-19J/photon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Power density = 2.4e6J/s/m^2   Divide by Ep
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.08e6/3.733e-19 = 6.43e24 ph/s/m^2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Assume receptor is .1m square, giving
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6.43e22 photons per second.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If the reflector is 0.1m squared, the systemic error of 10^4 becomes a
&gt;&gt;&gt;systemic error of 10^6 (I assumed 1 sqm reflectors).
&gt;&gt; Re-read to see the receptor is assumed to be  .1m, and the
&gt;&gt; retroreflectors I reckoned as .5m and disposed of it in the first
&gt;&gt; attenuation of .0003.

&gt;I assumed the 0.0003 was the pulse duration in your above claculations.
&gt;If its not, where does the pulse duration appear? Its clearly critical,
&gt;because only the first tenth of a nanoseond or two of the pulse is of use in
&gt;ranging.

200ps  was mentioned in the first message, a 1.5J pulse of 200ps in
duration, whose quotient gave me  7,500 megawatts average power per

&gt;&gt; &gt; Now that's really bad arithmetic. The 200ps pulse is 6 cm long, a far

&gt;&gt; I didn't know the whole pulse was only 200 pS long. I am very
&gt;&gt; surprised they can maintain this level of time correlation over a
&gt;&gt; 600,000 kms round trip. What is your source that the return pulse is
&gt;&gt; only 6 cms long - its far better than my gut reaction would expect?

&gt;Yep, for example:
&gt; http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/stations/sitelist/MDOL_sitelog.html

&gt;Pulsed ND Yag laser, pulsed at 10 Hz with a 200 ps duty cycle.  Those
&gt;parameters appear to be pretty standard (though the peak power varies
&gt;from one station to another).

&gt;Also, the beam-width of most laser systems reported on that page
&gt;appear to be in the 10's of arcsecond range, not the 0.075 microrad
&gt;values previously reported.

">

This spec says divergence is adjustable from 0-20 seconds. It also
says &quot;final beam diameter .75m  &quot;. This latter is probably as adjusted
out of the telescope which may have a final mirror of .75m.

20 sec = 96urad, larger by 1280 times the .075urad, reducing the flux
density by 1.6e6. On the other hand, 20 seconds of arc x Dmoon makes a
patch = 37000m or 23 miles! How does this fit with .75m? I have seen a
remark about &quot;4 miles wide&quot;.

With 20 seconds of beamwidth, (which I doubt, since, if it's
adjustable, what would be the point?) we reduce the photon count from
6.43e22 to 4.02e16 photons/s/m^2. The field strength would go down by
sqrt(1.6e6) or1265 to 1.9millivolts/meter.

Diffraction takes over when

where d is the distance &quot;behind&quot; the slit, and w is the wavelength. If the
mirrors on the moon are 1m across, this is 1,000 kms - way less than the
earth moon distance. If the mirrors are smaller, the distance is even less.

It should be obvious anyway that the beam width will be at least the width
of the main diffraction lobe. The mirrors on the moon are acting as a the
primary mirror of a very large telescope, with its prime focus on earth.

Fix this up in your calculations, and we can continue.

BTW, I calculated the spot size on the moon to be about 1 km across for the
main lobe. You might want to plug that into your equation.

&gt;It should be obvious anyway that the beam width will be at least the width
&gt;of the main diffraction lobe. The mirrors on the moon are acting as a the
&gt;primary mirror of a very large telescope, with its prime focus on earth.

&gt;Fix this up in your calculations, and we can continue.

&gt;BTW, I calculated the spot size on the moon to be about 1 km across for the
&gt;main lobe. You might want to plug that into your equation.

Your formulas are all from cookbook. We are talking about a mirror
diameter M = .5m, coherent light and a &quot;lens&quot; system with FL = Dm =
3.48e8m having an f-number of f#78,000,000 = Dm/M.

Let's go over it again:
A central ray has length L1 and one from the edge should have L2 = L1
+ lam/2, but with the mirror setting an extremely small angle, dthe
difference falls far short of creating the first interference

L1 = Dm = 3.48e8m,
and one from edge of the .25m half mirror, forms the half-angle A
A = .5M/Dm = 6.5e-10rad = 1.34e-4 sec. = .00065 uradians
The edge ray is longer by
dL = Dm *(1-cos A) use 1st term of series A^2/2
dL = Dm * A^2/2 = .081 nm vs 532nm of the laser.
The mirror would have to be sqrt(532/.081) or 81 times larger in order
for the first half wave interference to occur.

It seems clear we will not have agreement here, as you are 'dug in' to
your formulas, but you should refer us to some authority for your
statments.

Or, you have stated that they have measured the flux density and they
have calculated the photons per second, so you would be rendering a
royal service by posting specific numbers and of course citing your
sources.

There appears to be plenty of energy available, enough for them to
defocus to a wider beam in order to take the stringency out of the
tracking problem, contrary to the remark I made about no need to
broaden the beam.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Diffraction limited?  You'll have to explain that more. The aperture
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is 1,880,000 wavelengths wide. We're not trying to form images, so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; diffraction isn't in it, in my opinion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, your opinion is wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You almost got this correct when you likened the mirrors to a hole, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reflected light being the area illuminated by the hole. You used this to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;calculate the image on earth of the hole would be twice as large as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hole.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is not correct. It is true for a near field image, but at far field
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hole acts as a &quot;single slit&quot; and returns a diffraction pattern (just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;any other aperture light source).

&gt;&gt;&gt; A 1 meter mirror might be a slit for a 1 meter radar wavelength, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; it's no longer a slit at 532 nm wavelength.

&gt;&gt;It is, if the &quot;far field&quot; is far enough away. The earth moon distance is
&gt;&gt;plenty.

&gt;&gt;Diffraction takes over when

&gt;&gt;d  &gt;&gt;  a^2/w

&gt;&gt;where d is the distance &quot;behind&quot; the slit, and w is the wavelength. If the
&gt;&gt;mirrors on the moon are 1m across, this is 1,000 kms - way less than the
&gt;&gt;earth moon distance. If the mirrors are smaller, the distance is even
&gt;&gt;less.

&gt;&gt;It should be obvious anyway that the beam width will be at least the width

No. You seem to be confusing your units here, going from radians to seconds.

As I understand it, your claim is that the earth-moon distance is not
sufficient for a 1m aperture to be diffraction limitted on earth, so the
return spot from the mirror back on the earth is only 2m in diameter?  And
that answer is not obviously wrong to you?

Why don't you post the equation that you think governs far-field diffraction
patterns (as I have done), and show that the distance is less than this
(when I calculated this, it was about 400 times larger than would be needed
for diffraction limitted optics)? And having done this, why not simply work
out the diameter of the main diffraction lobe which will give you a (more)
correct figure for photon flux density on earth?

Do you actually want to find the error in your calculations or not?

Well, that is what you are trying to prove. The first step would be
calculating the diameter of the return beam from the reflectors. You
calculated 2 metres (or whatever double the reflector area is). This is
wrong, because it is a far field image (ie diffraction limitted). I provided
both the formula for when far field (diffraction) effects occur, and the

Tell me. If we had a parabolic mirror on the moon, reflecting laser light
from a point at the prime focus back to earth, how big would the main
diffraction lobe on earth be? What is the difference between this and the
setup where the laser light is produced on earth and reflected by a cubic
mirror on the moon? Photons don't &quot;remember&quot; where they were generated.

Forget your formulas. Cite a reference that emulates this phemenon and
does not involve lenses and is for coherent radiation.
You may enter it here:_______________________
I told you I had a purely kinematic anlaysis based on a beam still
coherent at the mirror and obviously monochromatic and when you quote
bulk effects it's too superficial and probably applies to *incoherent
light*.

I look at it as a 532nm wave going through a 500,000,000 nm hole. I
have already dealt with the possible role of long range producing
nulls and shown that this is ruled out.

I know exactly that a central ray mixing with an edge ray can produce
a nulling interference when the path difference is 1/2 wavelength.
Then I showed that the first possible such null required a mirror 81
times the current size. There is no diffraction at this aperture.

You seem infatuated with this debate about your diffraction formulas
and to what end? You haven't produced a number for the photon
reception rate nor to comment on the fractions photon rate nor
acknowledge that, take away 10^- 6 and you still have 10^16 of the

I'm sorry, if you don't understand the role of diffraction in optics, I
can't really help you. There are basically three routes to understanding
this (standard optics, quantum optics, and as a solution to Maxwell's
equation). They all provide the same result. Good things to google for would
be &quot;single slit experiments&quot;, &quot;quantum optics&quot;, and &quot;far field solutions to
Maxwells equations&quot; respectively. &quot;Fourier optics&quot; is the most comprehensive
analytical approach, but I suspect may be a little to advanced for you at
this stage, and isn't needed for the simple case we are discussing.

Clearly your calculations are wrong, because they do not produce the correct
(observed) photon density. I have shown you one obvious and very large
systemic error. If you think your errors are also in other places, I would
certainly agree.

Now, do you want to find the error in your calculations or not?

&gt; &gt;&gt; NASA says laser ranging to corner reflectors on the moon has
&gt; &gt;&gt; determined that the moon is receding at 3.8 cm/year. This remark is
&gt; &gt;&gt; puzzling:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Even under good atmospheric viewing conditions, only one
&gt; &gt;&gt; photon is received every few seconds&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; With a signal that bad, how could they determine the range to within,
&gt; &gt;&gt; say, 1.0 cm out of about  4*10^10 cm? It would seem they would try to
&gt; &gt;&gt; time the onset of the return pulse and do lengthy cross-correlation,
&gt; &gt;&gt; but it's hard to say there is even a  signal.

&gt; &gt; You seem to confusing the issues.

&gt; &gt;  (a) It is possible to measure the arrival time of a photon very
&gt; &gt;  accurately, probably at the picosecond level for &quot;stopwatch&quot; type of
&gt; &gt;  measurements measurements.

&gt; &gt;  (b) The difficulty is not in the relative ranging, so whether it is
&gt; &gt;  1 cm out of 1e10 or 4e10 is not relevant.

&gt; &gt;  (c) The real issue is whether a single photon arriving from a
&gt; &gt;  distant source is really that source or a contaminating background
&gt; &gt;  photon.  The experimenters have carefully tuned the apparatus so
&gt; &gt;  that only photons within a narrow time and wavelength window are
&gt; &gt;  permitted, so the background contamination is exceedingly small.
&gt; &gt;  I.e. the return signal is still whoppingly bright compared to the
&gt; &gt;  background level. (The time window is of order 400 ns.  While this
&gt; &gt;  is small, the window still allows ~0.1 km of variation in the lunar
&gt; &gt;  range, which is huge.  The wavelength window is also small because
&gt; &gt;  they are using a monochromatic laser).

&gt; &gt;  (d) The experimenters do *not* use a single photon arrival time, but
&gt; &gt;  rather the average of many arrival times, since a *train* of pulses
&gt; &gt;  is sent up and then received.  This improves the precision.

&gt; &gt;&gt; It would be hard to test for the presence of the Pioneer effect with
&gt; &gt;&gt; such a poor signal. Using a Doppler radar signal would seem to be a
&gt; &gt;&gt; better idea, because the range to the moon is only about 1/40,000th of
&gt; &gt;&gt; the distance to the Pioneer at max range and the team was able to
&gt; &gt;&gt; detect minute changes in the Doppler velocity. (Of course, Pioneer
&gt; &gt;&gt; re-transmitted its signal at 7 watts).

&gt; &gt; and

&gt; &gt;   (e) The experiment is lunar *ranging*, not doppler velocity
&gt; &gt;   measurements.  Doppler is accurate to perhaps 0.01 mm/s at its
&gt; &gt;   best, but this is not nearly accurate enough to detect the signals
&gt; &gt;   of ~0.1 mm *PER YEAR* the experimenters are looking for.  For that
&gt; &gt;   matter there aren't any radio re-transponders on the moon's surface
&gt; &gt;   for this purpose.

&gt; &gt;   The Pioneer measurements do not solve &quot;range&quot; but rather a
&gt; &gt;   trajectory through the solar system which is consistent with the
&gt; &gt;   doppler velocity measurements.

&gt; &gt; CM

&gt; Finally somebody posting the &quot;correct&quot; answer.

&gt; The only modification I would make is to your statement about &quot;picosecond&quot;
&gt; accuracy. There is no need to transform this into the time domain. The
&gt; accuracy of the measurement is purely a function of the wavelength of the
&gt; light. Dividing a distance by c to get a time error and then multiplying the
&gt; time error by c to get a distance measurement is redundant.

&gt; Unless you can measure relative phase (which you can't do with a single
&gt; photon) the underlying accuracy of the distance measurement is comparable to
&gt; the the wavelength of the light - perhaps 500 nM to 1000 nM. All the rest is
&gt; practical limitations.

But perhaps a single photon can be FM/quantum (frequency modulated).

Have you ever analyzed to see what actually happens to cause
diffraction?  There can be nothing involved other than phase-shifted
light waves due to inconvenient geometric considerations.

You say
spot diameter = dist to moon x wavelength of light / mirror size
Your formula boils down to
spot size = lambda/theta, the cone angle.

point) is that diffraction  makes it impossible to exactly reproduce a
point image of a point object because of the subtle changes in path
lengths across the diameter of the aperture producing diffraction
minima and maxima. The point image becomes the sum of maxima and
minima.
But here the f number is so huge that the mirror needs to be 81 times
its present size in order to enocunter its first null.

The far field Maxwell solutions have to do with trying to reconstsruct
the distorted images of object resulting from diffraction effects. We
have no objects here.

You seemingly  fail to grasp that there's so little going on here that
diffraction is not involved:

A narrow beam of 543nm WL is sent up to moon mirror that is 500
million nm wide. It's a corner reflector. The tensor for a corner
reflector is - delta_ij, which reverses all vectors irrespective of
orientation, and which obviously remains unchanged after applying any
reasonable similarity transformation. The rays are sent back home
without alteration. But in my case I choose to remove the -1 and rays
go through the mirror (hole) unscathed and carry on as if they had
never met a mirror.

The individual waves proceed on their own vectors, one having nothing
to do with the other, on through the hole and then back home.
Finally,  splat!, they land on the photo-cathode or equivalent.

divergence is 0-20 arcsec, and the divergence is adjustable.  It would
be an *extra* assumption that the operators can actually adjust the
divergence to any desired value.  More likely: they can control it to
less than 20 arcsec.

Thank you Craig for getting some real data.

Using their figures, the attenuation, as I figure it, is 7.7x10^-28
yielding a  &quot;robust&quot; 15 photons per pulse m/l in line with their
&quot;several photons per pulse&quot;.

They use much smaller mirror 3.8cm., and first patch of 7 km vs 28m
from a 3 second divergence and not microradians. They reckon the
return patch 21km vs the first patch of 7 km arose from divergence
angle tripling from 3 sec to 10 seconds on the way back. Twice would
be better.
My calculations:
WL = 532nm
Ep = hc/WL = 3.7e-19J per photon
Ebeam = 1.75J    Pwide = 200ps

N = photons/pulse = Ebeam/Ep = 4.02e18 photons/pulse Shelus:3e17
(Shelus figure is 13 times lower (wd make 15ppp go to 1ppp). I will
argue for my figure: 1.75joules, 3.73-19J/photon.

Phorate = N/Pwide = 2e28 ph/sec 1 pulse
Calculate attenuations starting from the .75m scope, their 7km patch
At1 = bexit/patch1 = (.75m/7km)^2 =  1.15e-8   7km patch not 28m
At2 = mirror/patch1 = (3.8cm/7km)^2 = 2.95e-11  3.8cm not 50
At3 = receiver/patch2 =( 1m/21km)^2 = 2.6e-9  1m vs .1m
Atoveral = 7.67e-28
Net photon rate 1 pulse = Phorate x Atoverall =15.4 ph/sec/pulse
This translates to 15 photons per pulse which is considerably more
than their newer stations record of  &quot;several photons per pulse&quot;.
So that still leaves them doing a hat trick ranging to cm's with a
parsimonious rate of signal information.

&gt;&gt;I'm sorry, if you don't understand the role of diffraction in optics, I
&gt;&gt;can't really help you. There are basically three routes to understanding

&gt;&gt;equation). They all provide the same result. Good things to google for
&gt;&gt;would
&gt;&gt;be &quot;single slit experiments&quot;, &quot;quantum optics&quot;, and &quot;far field solutions

&gt;&gt;this stage, and isn't needed for the simple case we are discussing.

&gt; Have you ever analyzed to see what actually happens to cause
&gt; diffraction?  There can be nothing involved other than phase-shifted
&gt; light waves due to inconvenient geometric considerations.

Yes, of course.

I note that you agree with the quote provided by Craig, which states:

Note that the first item given affecting the angle of the returning pulse is
&quot;diffraction&quot;.

Note that the beam spread on earth in the quote (that you agreed with) is
very much the same as the calculated beam width from diffraction. (Here is
the formula which I previously provided. Width = wavelength/aperture x
distance, = 1000 nM/0.38 x 4 x 10^9 = 3 x 10^-6 x 4 x 10^9 = 12 x 10^3 = 12
kms. The difference is a combination of inefficiencies in the system and
ambiguities in defining beam width, both of which I highlighted as a source
of error).

Note that including the diffraction effect on beam width increases the spot
size from 2 metres (which you calculated), to 10-20 kms (which I calculate
and the other post confirms), which reduces flux density by about 10^6 (also
a figure I provided).

There might be a lesson here for you. Perhaps you would learn more about
basic optics if you shut up and listened to people with at least a basic
knowledge of the subject, instead of spending your time telling them they
are wrong.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ref. http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; NASA says laser ranging to corner reflectors on the moon has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; determined that the moon is receding at 3.8 cm/year. This remark is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; puzzling:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Even under good atmospheric viewing conditions, only one
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; photon is received every few seconds&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; With a signal that bad, how could they determine the range to within,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; say, 1.0 cm out of about  4*10^10 cm? It would seem they would try to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time the onset of the return pulse and do lengthy cross-correlation,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but it's hard to say there is even a  signal.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You seem to confusing the issues.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  (a) It is possible to measure the arrival time of a photon very
&gt;&gt; &gt;  accurately, probably at the picosecond level for &quot;stopwatch&quot; type of
&gt;&gt; &gt;  measurements measurements.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  (b) The difficulty is not in the relative ranging, so whether it is
&gt;&gt; &gt;  1 cm out of 1e10 or 4e10 is not relevant.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  (c) The real issue is whether a single photon arriving from a
&gt;&gt; &gt;  distant source is really that source or a contaminating background
&gt;&gt; &gt;  photon.  The experimenters have carefully tuned the apparatus so
&gt;&gt; &gt;  that only photons within a narrow time and wavelength window are
&gt;&gt; &gt;  permitted, so the background contamination is exceedingly small.
&gt;&gt; &gt;  I.e. the return signal is still whoppingly bright compared to the
&gt;&gt; &gt;  background level. (The time window is of order 400 ns.  While this
&gt;&gt; &gt;  is small, the window still allows ~0.1 km of variation in the lunar
&gt;&gt; &gt;  range, which is huge.  The wavelength window is also small because
&gt;&gt; &gt;  they are using a monochromatic laser).

&gt;&gt; &gt;  (d) The experimenters do *not* use a single photon arrival time, but
&gt;&gt; &gt;  rather the average of many arrival times, since a *train* of pulses
&gt;&gt; &gt;  is sent up and then received.  This improves the precision.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It would be hard to test for the presence of the Pioneer effect with
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; such a poor signal. Using a Doppler radar signal would seem to be a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; better idea, because the range to the moon is only about 1/40,000th of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the distance to the Pioneer at max range and the team was able to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; detect minute changes in the Doppler velocity. (Of course, Pioneer
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; re-transmitted its signal at 7 watts).

&gt;&gt; &gt; and

&gt;&gt; &gt;   (e) The experiment is lunar *ranging*, not doppler velocity
&gt;&gt; &gt;   measurements.  Doppler is accurate to perhaps 0.01 mm/s at its
&gt;&gt; &gt;   best, but this is not nearly accurate enough to detect the signals
&gt;&gt; &gt;   of ~0.1 mm *PER YEAR* the experimenters are looking for.  For that
&gt;&gt; &gt;   matter there aren't any radio re-transponders on the moon's surface
&gt;&gt; &gt;   for this purpose.

&gt;&gt; &gt;   The Pioneer measurements do not solve &quot;range&quot; but rather a
&gt;&gt; &gt;   trajectory through the solar system which is consistent with the
&gt;&gt; &gt;   doppler velocity measurements.

&gt;&gt; &gt; CM

&gt;&gt; Finally somebody posting the &quot;correct&quot; answer.

&gt;&gt; The only modification I would make is to your statement about
&gt;&gt; &quot;picosecond&quot;
&gt;&gt; accuracy. There is no need to transform this into the time domain. The
&gt;&gt; accuracy of the measurement is purely a function of the wavelength of the
&gt;&gt; light. Dividing a distance by c to get a time error and then multiplying
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; time error by c to get a distance measurement is redundant.

&gt;&gt; Unless you can measure relative phase (which you can't do with a single
&gt;&gt; photon) the underlying accuracy of the distance measurement is comparable
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; the the wavelength of the light - perhaps 500 nM to 1000 nM. All the rest
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; practical limitations.

&gt; But perhaps a single photon can be FM/quantum (frequency modulated).
&gt; - Brad Guth -
">

This is what I thought they may have done. By imposing a baseband signal you
can get resolution down to the baseband wavelength (not the carrier
wavelength). As I noted before, this makes no real difference to the
mathematics, as the same issues exist in the frequency domain (if it is
modulated) as in the time domain (if it is a pulse).

Ohh, so it is diffraction limitted? And the formulas I gave were correct?

And so all that stuff about how diffraction effects had nothing to do with
it that you posted was wrong?

And all the arguments you gave about how the spot size would be 2m, and no
far field effects apply, that was wrong as well? (or, indeed, for a 3.8 cms
mirror the return spot would be 7.6 cms in diameter).

Next time, if you are discussing a subject you obviously know nothing about
with someone who obviously does know what they are talking about, perhaps
you would be better of shutting up and listening, instead of telling them
they are wrong.

&gt; &gt;From Dickey et al. 1994,
&gt; &gt;  Ranging to the moon is technically challenging.  An outgoing pulse
&gt; &gt;  of laser light transmitted from the a collimating telescope with a
&gt; &gt;  beam divergence of 3 to 4 s of arc, consistent with atmospheric
&gt; &gt;  seeing, spreads to an area of approximately 7 km in diameter on the
&gt; &gt;  lunar surface. ...

&gt; &gt;  [Corner cube ] arrays intercept only 10^{-9} of the area of the
&gt; &gt;  impinging light beam.  The angular spread of the returning pulse is
&gt; &gt;  set by diffraction, polarization properties, and irregularities of
&gt; &gt;  the array's individual corner cubes.  In the case of the the 3.8 cm
&gt; &gt;  diameter Apollo corner cube, the spread is approximately 10 sec of
&gt; &gt;  arc.  Thus, the diameter of the spot produced on the Earth is
&gt; &gt;  approximately 20 km.  A 1 m diameter receiving telescope would
&gt; &gt;  collect only 2 x 10^{-9} of the returning photons.  A variety of
&gt; &gt;  practical matters, such as quantum efficiencey, mirror reflectance,
&gt; &gt;  optical performance under thermal stress, and velocity aberration
&gt; &gt;  (which slightly shifts the center of the returning beam from the
&gt; &gt;  location of the transmitting and receiving telescope), make the
&gt; &gt;  product of the transmitting, lunar retroreflecting, and receiving
&gt; &gt;  efficiences considerably less than unity.  The overall signal loss
&gt; &gt;  of approximately 10^{-21} puts a premium on the detailed design of
&gt; &gt;  ground stations to minimize their losses.
&gt; &gt;  ...

&gt; &gt;&gt; With 20 seconds of beamwidth, (which I doubt, since, if it's
&gt; &gt;&gt; adjustable, what would be the point?) we reduce the photon count from
&gt; &gt;&gt; 6.43e22 to 4.02e16 photons/s/m^2. The field strength would go down by
&gt; &gt;&gt; sqrt(1.6e6) or1265 to 1.9millivolts/meter.

&gt; &gt;According to Shelus et al, approx 3 x 10^{17} photons are launched per
&gt; &gt;pulse, which is reduced by the losses to significantly less than one
&gt; &gt;returned photon per pulse (approx 1/3rd of a return per minute, at a
&gt; &gt;10 Hz pulse rate).  I have read elsewhere that under the best
&gt; &gt;conditions (rather than average), the McDonald station can return 1
&gt; &gt;photon per minute.

&gt; &gt;On the other hand, newer stations like APOLLO (Apache Point) can
&gt; &gt;return several photons per pulse.

Even if one were to assume pure geometric calculations (which are
incorrect), your calculations are still incorrect.  The number of
photons received at the retroreflector are,

N_retro = N_transmitted * (A_retro/A_lunar_spot)
= N_transmitted * (1100 cm^2 / 38 km^2)
= N_transmitted * (~2 x 10^{-9})

which is in line with the Dickey quotation.  The number received at
earth is,

N_received = N_retro * (A_receiver / A_earth_spot)
= N_retro * (0.44 m^2 / 346 km^2)
= N_retro * (~1 x 10^{-9})

again comparable to the Dickey estimates.  However, what you *don't*
account for by the geometry-only approach is the other loss factors
described above.  The true attenuation is around 10^{-21}, but this
actual value depends on observing angles and other factors.

So for 3e17 photons launched per pulse, about 0.0003 photons are
received.  Thus, it takes about 300 sec to receive one photon (my
previous estimate was incorrect).

The Apache Point observatory (which is *different* than McDonald) is
much more capable because of the much larger aperture area on the
earth.

Scrap that. By limiting it to a 10 pS signal on a 10 Hz duty cycle, they are

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;from one station to another).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Also, the beam-width of most laser systems reported on that page
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;appear to be in the 10's of arcsecond range, not the 0.075 microrad
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;values previously reported.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Craig
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This spec says divergence is adjustable from 0-20 seconds. It also
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; says &quot;final beam diameter .75m  &quot;. This latter is probably as adjusted
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; out of the telescope which may have a final mirror of .75m.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;snip

&gt; &gt;&gt; This is really valuable information that straightens things out
&gt; &gt;&gt; considerably:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;From Dickey et al. 1994,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  Ranging to the moon is technically challenging.  An outgoing pulse
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  of laser light transmitted from the a collimating telescope with a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  beam divergence of 3 to 4 s of arc, consistent with atmospheric
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  seeing, spreads to an area of approximately 7 km in diameter on the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  lunar surface. ...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  [Corner cube ] arrays intercept only 10^{-9} of the area of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  impinging light beam.  The angular spread of the returning pulse is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  set by diffraction, polarization properties, and irregularities of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  the array's individual corner cubes.  In the case of the the 3.8 cm
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  diameter Apollo corner cube, the spread is approximately 10 sec of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  arc.  Thus, the diameter of the spot produced on the Earth is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  approximately 20 km.  A 1 m diameter receiving telescope would
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  collect only 2 x 10^{-9} of the returning photons.  A variety of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  practical matters, such as quantum efficiencey, mirror reflectance,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  optical performance under thermal stress, and velocity aberration
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  (which slightly shifts the center of the returning beam from the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  location of the transmitting and receiving telescope), make the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  product of the transmitting, lunar retroreflecting, and receiving
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  efficiences considerably less than unity.  The overall signal loss
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  of approximately 10^{-21} puts a premium on the detailed design of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  ground stations to minimize their losses.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  ...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; With 20 seconds of beamwidth, (which I doubt, since, if it's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; adjustable, what would be the point?) we reduce the photon count from
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 6.43e22 to 4.02e16 photons/s/m^2. The field strength would go down by
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sqrt(1.6e6) or1265 to 1.9millivolts/meter.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;According to Shelus et al, approx 3 x 10^{17} photons are launched per
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;pulse, which is reduced by the losses to significantly less than one
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;returned photon per pulse (approx 1/3rd of a return per minute, at a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;10 Hz pulse rate).  I have read elsewhere that under the best
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;conditions (rather than average), the McDonald station can return 1
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;photon per minute.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;On the other hand, newer stations like APOLLO (Apache Point) can
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;return several photons per pulse.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Using their figures, the attenuation, as I figure it, is 7.7x10^-28

&gt; &gt;You are mistaken.

&gt; &gt;&gt; from a 3 second divergence and not microradians.

&gt; &gt;The area of a *single reflector* is 3.8 cm
&gt; &gt;diameter, but the assembly has multiple reflectors.  However, the 3.8
&gt; &gt;cm number is relevant for the returned diffraction pattern.

&gt; &gt;&gt;They reckon the
&gt; &gt;&gt; return patch 21km vs the first patch of 7 km arose from divergence
&gt; &gt;&gt; angle tripling from 3 sec to 10 seconds on the way back. Twice would
&gt; &gt;&gt; be better.
&gt; &gt;&gt; My calculations:
&gt; &gt;&gt; WL = 532nm
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ep = hc/WL = 3.7e-19J per photon
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ebeam = 1.75J    Pwide = 200ps

&gt; &gt;&gt; N = photons/pulse = Ebeam/Ep = 4.02e18 photons/pulse Shelus:3e17
&gt; &gt;&gt;    (Shelus figure is 13 times lower (wd make 15ppp go to 1ppp). I will
&gt; &gt;&gt; argue for my figure: 1.75joules, 3.73-19J/photon.

&gt; &gt;You of course are assuming peak power output which appears to be
&gt; &gt;incorrect.
&gt; No. I am using the stated *energy* per pulse of 1.75J, and dividing by
&gt; the classical energy per photon which has to be
&gt;    Ep = h*c/532nm = 3.7e-19J per photon giving
&gt;    N = 1.75J/3.7e-19JP = 4.02e18  photon/pulse as above.
&gt;    N' from article = 3e17, fewer by 13x
&gt; Why the 13 times discrepancy? 4 numbers, all givens, are involved.

The difference is likely to be that the energy consumed by the laser
is not all directed at the target.  This is one of the inefficiency
factors involved.

Your value (and units) are non-sensical.  If you *really* mean 15.4
photons per pulse *per second of laser on-time* -- per above, you
described as &quot;ph/sec ... during pulse&quot; -- then to find photons per
second, you should multiply by 10 pulses per second, times 200
picoseconds per pulse.  The result is an absolutely miniscule number
(3e-8 ph/sec).

But that is because you made multiple errors in calculating the
attenuation.
(a) your value for the area of the retroreflector array was
incorrect (as noted previously);
(b) you &quot;double-counted&quot; attenuation by computing (.../7 km)^2 twice;
(c) you did not account for other non-geometric losses, as detailed
by Dickey above.

The Dickey paper describes geometric losses of about 10^{-18}, but

That's quite possible.  But since the configurations have changed
multiple times at the earth ranging stations, it may be difficult to

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  arc.  Thus, the diameter of the spot produced on the Earth is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  approximately 20 km.  A 1 m diameter receiving telescope would

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;According to Shelus et al, approx 3 x 10^{17} photons are launched per

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm sorry, if you don't understand the role of diffraction in optics, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;can't really help you. There are basically three routes to understanding
&gt;&gt;&gt;this (standard optics, quantum optics, and as a solution to Maxwell's
&gt;&gt;&gt;equation). They all provide the same result. Good things to google for
&gt;&gt;&gt;would
&gt;&gt;&gt;be &quot;single slit experiments&quot;, &quot;quantum optics&quot;, and &quot;far field solutions
&gt;&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;Maxwells equations&quot; respectively. &quot;Fourier optics&quot; is the most
&gt;&gt;&gt;comprehensive
&gt;&gt;&gt;analytical approach, but I suspect may be a little to advanced for you at
&gt;&gt;&gt;this stage, and isn't needed for the simple case we are discussing.

&gt;&gt; Have you ever analyzed to see what actually happens to cause
&gt;&gt; diffraction?  There can be nothing involved other than phase-shifted
&gt;&gt; light waves due to inconvenient geometric considerations.

&gt;Yes, of course.

&gt;I note that you agree with the quote provided by Craig, which states:

&gt;&gt;  [Corner cube ] arrays intercept only 10^{-9} of the area of the
&gt;&gt;  impinging light beam.  The angular spread of the returning pulse is
&gt;&gt;  set by diffraction, polarization properties, and irregularities of
&gt;&gt;  the array's individual corner cubes.  In the case of the the 3.8 cm
&gt;&gt;  diameter Apollo corner cube, the spread is approximately 10 sec of
&gt;&gt;  arc.  Thus, the diameter of the spot produced on the Earth is
&gt;&gt;  approximately 20 km.

&gt;Note that the first item given affecting the angle of the returning pulse is
&gt;&quot;diffraction&quot;.

&gt;Note that the beam spread on earth in the quote (that you agreed with) is
&gt;very much the same as the calculated beam width from diffraction. (Here is
&gt;the formula which I previously provided. Width = wavelength/aperture x
&gt;distance, = 1000 nM/0.38 x 4 x 10^9 = 3 x 10^-6 x 4 x 10^9 = 12 x 10^3 = 12
&gt;kms. The difference is a combination of inefficiencies in the system and
&gt;ambiguities in defining beam width, both of which I highlighted as a source
&gt;of error).
">

No, you haven't been paying attention. I simply agreed with further
information that was provided that stated that the originating beam
had 3 seconds of arc not microradians and 3 sec x Dmoon = 5.6km. Then
the report stated 10 seconds on the way down, triple the original,
resulting in  a patch of 21 km at the earth.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Note that including the diffraction effect on beam width increases the spot

&gt;There might be a lesson here for you. Perhaps you would learn more about
&gt;basic optics if you shut up and listened to people with at least a basic
&gt;knowledge of the subject, instead of spending your time telling them they
&gt;are wrong.

I am almost as sick of hearing about your putative diffraction as I am

So what is the quantity of the photons received? If only 1 photon
every 300 seconds, then my question remains-how calibrate Dmoon to .1
or 1 cm? I'm not saying it can't be done. I am saying that it would be
mighty interesting. But first tell the photon count.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;appear to be in the 10's of arcsecond range, not the 0.075 microrad
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;values previously reported.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Craig
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This spec says divergence is adjustable from 0-20 seconds. It also
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; says &quot;final beam diameter .75m  &quot;. This latter is probably as adjusted
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; out of the telescope which may have a final mirror of .75m.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;snip

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is really valuable information that straightens things out
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; considerably:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;From Dickey et al. 1994,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  Ranging to the moon is technically challenging.  An outgoing pulse
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  of laser light transmitted from the a collimating telescope with a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  beam divergence of 3 to 4 s of arc, consistent with atmospheric
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  seeing, spreads to an area of approximately 7 km in diameter on the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  lunar surface. ...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  [Corner cube ] arrays intercept only 10^{-9} of the area of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  impinging light beam.  The angular spread of the returning pulse is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  set by diffraction, polarization properties, and irregularities of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  the array's individual corner cubes.  In the case of the the 3.8 cm
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  diameter Apollo corner cube, the spread is approximately 10 sec of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  arc.  Thus, the diameter of the spot produced on the Earth is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  approximately 20 km.  A 1 m diameter receiving telescope would
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  collect only 2 x 10^{-9} of the returning photons.  A variety of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  practical matters, such as quantum efficiencey, mirror reflectance,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  optical performance under thermal stress, and velocity aberration
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  (which slightly shifts the center of the returning beam from the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  location of the transmitting and receiving telescope), make the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  product of the transmitting, lunar retroreflecting, and receiving
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  efficiences considerably less than unity.  The overall signal loss
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  of approximately 10^{-21} puts a premium on the detailed design of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  ground stations to minimize their losses.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  ...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; With 20 seconds of beamwidth, (which I doubt, since, if it's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; adjustable, what would be the point?) we reduce the photon count from
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 6.43e22 to 4.02e16 photons/s/m^2. The field strength would go down by
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sqrt(1.6e6) or1265 to 1.9millivolts/meter.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;According to Shelus et al, approx 3 x 10^{17} photons are launched per
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;pulse, which is reduced by the losses to significantly less than one
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;returned photon per pulse (approx 1/3rd of a return per minute, at a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;10 Hz pulse rate).  I have read elsewhere that under the best
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;conditions (rather than average), the McDonald station can return 1
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;photon per minute.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;On the other hand, newer stations like APOLLO (Apache Point) can
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;return several photons per pulse.

&gt; &gt;&gt; No. I am using the stated *energy* per pulse of 1.75J, and dividing by

&gt; &gt; This is what I thought they may have done. By imposing a baseband signal

But isn't FM of far better data efficiency than AM?

How about forcing AM + FM on behalf of those same photon(s)?

Imagine the greater data throughput if we could reliably create and

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Pulsed ND Yag laser, pulsed at 10 Hz with a 200 ps duty cycle.  Those
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;parameters appear to be pretty standard (though the peak power varies
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;from one station to another).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Also, the beam-width of most laser systems reported on that page
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;appear to be in the 10's of arcsecond range, not the 0.075 microrad
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;values previously reported.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Craig
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This spec says divergence is adjustable from 0-20 seconds. It also
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; says &quot;final beam diameter .75m  &quot;. This latter is probably as adjusted
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; out of the telescope which may have a final mirror of .75m.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;snip

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is really valuable information that straightens things out
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; considerably:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;From Dickey et al. 1994,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  Ranging to the moon is technically challenging.  An outgoing pulse
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  of laser light transmitted from the a collimating telescope with a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  beam divergence of 3 to 4 s of arc, consistent with atmospheric
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  seeing, spreads to an area of approximately 7 km in diameter on the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  lunar surface. ...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  [Corner cube ] arrays intercept only 10^{-9} of the area of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  impinging light beam.  The angular spread of the returning pulse is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  set by diffraction, polarization properties, and irregularities of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  the array's individual corner cubes.  In the case of the the 3.8 cm
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  diameter Apollo corner cube, the spread is approximately 10 sec of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  arc.  Thus, the diameter of the spot produced on the Earth is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  approximately 20 km.  A 1 m diameter receiving telescope would
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  collect only 2 x 10^{-9} of the returning photons.  A variety of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  practical matters, such as quantum efficiencey, mirror reflectance,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  optical performance under thermal stress, and velocity aberration
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  (which slightly shifts the center of the returning beam from the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  location of the transmitting and receiving telescope), make the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  product of the transmitting, lunar retroreflecting, and receiving
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  efficiences considerably less than unity.  The overall signal loss
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  of approximately 10^{-21} puts a premium on the detailed design of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  ground stations to minimize their losses.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  ...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; With 20 seconds of beamwidth, (which I doubt, since, if it's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; adjustable, what would be the point?) we reduce the photon count from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 6.43e22 to 4.02e16 photons/s/m^2. The field strength would go down by
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sqrt(1.6e6) or1265 to 1.9millivolts/meter.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;According to Shelus et al, approx 3 x 10^{17} photons are launched per
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;pulse, which is reduced by the losses to significantly less than one
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;returned photon per pulse (approx 1/3rd of a return per minute, at a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;10 Hz pulse rate).  I have read elsewhere that under the best
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;conditions (rather than average), the McDonald station can return 1
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;photon per minute.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;On the other hand, newer stations like APOLLO (Apache Point) can
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;return several photons per pulse.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thank you Craig for getting some real data.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Using their figures, the attenuation, as I figure it, is 7.7x10^-28
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yielding a  &quot;robust&quot; 15 photons per pulse m/l in line with their
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;several photons per pulse&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You are mistaken.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from a 3 second divergence and not microradians.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The area of a *single reflector* is 3.8 cm
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;diameter, but the assembly has multiple reflectors.  However, the 3.8
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;cm number is relevant for the returned diffraction pattern.

&gt;This is the comment you missed previously.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;They reckon the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; return patch 21km vs the first patch of 7 km arose from divergence
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; angle tripling from 3 sec to 10 seconds on the way back. Twice would
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be better.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; My calculations:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; WL = 532nm
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ep = hc/WL = 3.7e-19J per photon
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ebeam = 1.75J    Pwide = 200ps

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; N = photons/pulse = Ebeam/Ep = 4.02e18 photons/pulse Shelus:3e17
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    (Shelus figure is 13 times lower (wd make 15ppp go to 1ppp). I will
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; argue for my figure: 1.75joules, 3.73-19J/photon.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You of course are assuming peak power output which appears to be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;incorrect.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; No. I am using the stated *energy* per pulse of 1.75J, and dividing by
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the classical energy per photon which has to be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;       Ep = h*c/532nm = 3.7e-19J per photon giving
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;       N = 1.75J/3.7e-19JP = 4.02e18  photon/pulse as above.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;       N' from article = 3e17, fewer by 13x
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why the 13 times discrepancy? 4 numbers, all givens, are involved.

&gt;&gt; &gt;The difference is likely to be that the energy consumed by the laser
&gt;&gt; &gt;is not all directed at the target.  This is one of the inefficiency
&gt;&gt; &gt;factors involved.
&gt;&gt; Yes, 8% efficiency would cover 13x. But how separate out, just from a
&gt;&gt; reading of input power,  the 532 nm energy draw from that of the
&gt;&gt; 1065nm energy &quot;that is not used&quot;?

&gt;That is not my problem.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Phorate = N/Pwide = 2e28 ph/sec 1 pulse during pulse.
&gt;&gt; This is photons per second during the pulse.

&gt;True.  But, as noted previously, you failed to multiply by pulse width
&gt;when you computed total number of photons received per second (which
&gt;is averaged over pulse and non-pulse time intervals).
">

I used photon rate while the pulse is on. That's when the detectins
must be done. When the pulse is over, the experiment is over in a
sense. Why would anyone care about averaging over all time? As you
note below, the narrower the better.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Calculating the photon rate &quot;per pulse&quot; is not relevant here, only the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;total number of photons per pulse.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I see you calculating the seconds per pulse below. That is a rate.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Total number is my N = 4.02e18.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In fact I make direct use of Phorate down below in my paragraph which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you had the bad taste to cut out.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Calculate attenuations starting from the .75m scope, their 7km patch
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; At1 = bexit/patch1 = (.75m/7km)^2 =  1.15e-8   7km patch not 28m
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; At2 = mirror/patch1 = (3.8cm/7km)^2 = 2.95e-11  3.8cm not 50
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; At3 = receiver/patch2 =( 1m/21km)^2 = 2.6e-9  1m vs .1m
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Atoveral = 7.67e-28

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I can't believe you cut this out, so here it is again:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Net photon rate 1 pulse = Phorate x Atoverall =15.4 ph/sec/pulse
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This translates to 15 photons per pulse which is considerably more
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; than their newer stations record of  &quot;several photons per pulse&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Your value (and units) are non-sensical.  If you *really* mean 15.4
&gt;&gt; &gt;photons per pulse *per second of laser on-time* -- per above, you
&gt;&gt; &gt;described as &quot;ph/sec ... during pulse&quot; -- then to find photons per
&gt;&gt; &gt;second, you should multiply by 10 pulses per second, times 200
&gt;&gt; &gt;picoseconds per pulse.  The result is an absolutely miniscule number
&gt;&gt; &gt;(3e-8 ph/sec).

&gt;I note that you did not respond.

I repeat, such a calculation would be of only obscure statistical
significance. Pulse over, game over.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt;But that is because you made multiple errors in calculating the
&gt;&gt; &gt;attenuation.
&gt;&gt; &gt;  (a) your value for the area of the retroreflector array was
&gt;&gt; &gt;      incorrect (as noted previously);

&gt;&gt; I used their literal value of 3.8cm, and lost track of previous
&gt;&gt; reference describing the array size.

&gt;I note that you did not try to correct your estimate.  Your use of 3.8
&gt;cm as the total reflector area is still incorrect.

No I had said I still couldn't retrieve the reference.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  (b) you &quot;double-counted&quot; attenuation by computing (.../7 km)^2 twice;

You're right, I did double count. Using total pulses is easier. Here's
the result I get using their numbers of 3e17ppp, 10x10 prisms of .038m
each, 7km, 21km with 1m receiver;

Final photons/pulse = 3e17*(.38*1m^2/(7km*21km))^2 = .0009
ph/pulse. That works out to .009 ph/second at prf of 10, or 111 real
seconds to the next photon.

&gt;&gt; No, I was working power density, so A1 is density thinning. A2 is

&gt;Incorrect.  As I pointed out in my derivation below, &quot;(7 km)^2&quot;

That depends upon how much you want to find the errors in your calculations.

If you do want to improve your knowledge in this area, could I make a
suggestion?

I have done a considerable number of similar calculations (and reviewed many
more) as I have designed space based and terrestrial radio comms networks.
The easiest way of doing it is to consider the various factors that cause
attenuation, and calculate each one as a dB of attenuation. You just add up
each of the attenuation sources to give you the final attenuation, and plug
Planck's constant in at the end. This means that you can calculate and
change attenuation sources independently. Your current approach - to count
absolute photon number after each source of attenuation - means that any
errors you make ripple through your whole calculation, and have to be
re-done.

For example, you can assume 0dB attenuation resulting from power losses in
the laser, and calculate the final attenuation. If you subsequently discover
that power losses in the laser produces 10 dB of attenuation, you can simply
add 10 dB to the final attenuation without having to adjust every subsequent
photon count in your calculations. It makes it far easier to see what is
going on, and where the errors are.

Professionals operate in this manner almost exclusively, because its far
easier.

Why don't you re-do your calculations as a series of attenuation factors as
decibels, and post them here? Then we can look at each term independently to
help you find your error.

No, that wouldn't be fruitful. Your suggestion is for me to modify my
treatment of the factors; I am using a math application not a
calculator.
But the data set is uncertain. There are discrepancies in mirror
sizes, telescope sizes, initial and final dispersion angles, initial
photon density and at each iteration one or more of these has shifted.
And it is time consuming. I find that I was doing all the multiplying
and you were doing all the diffracting!
It was not my intent to prove or disprove the overall efficiency as
much as to find out how one can determine orbit bloom of 3.8 cm/yr
with the such a parsimonious set of randomly timed photons.
Now I find that my vague sense of tedium has blossomed into full-blown
ennui! :&gt;)
On another note, you may have read that the 3.8cy is a sum of about
2.3cy of accountable drift plus 1.5 cm/yr of anomalous drift. Finding
the source of the anomaly would be interesting work.
Again, this brings us back to the original thread topic of how the
data is processed to get such finely tuned results of the moon's
orbit, which no doubt has an eccentricity problem also.
