Two days after Nawaz Sharif's deportation from Pakistan, the sense of
anger at the humiliation suffered by the civil society at the hands of a
military regime is finally subsiding, at least for me. Here is how I
look at the  events.

Even though NS is the most popular democratic leader, people are not
willing to sacrifice for him as they were willing to sacrifice for CJP.
This is the moment of truth for any politician with a conscience. They
need to do some serious soul searching (apnay man may doob kar paja
suragh-e zindagi) and ask themselves why people are not willing to rally
on their call (like they responded to CJP). The CJP is a man of courage,
honor and conviction. That is what people admire and follow. In a more
materialistic sense, people expected a change for good by supporting the
CJP. They don't appear to have very high expectations from the current
political leadership.

Let me be clear, this is not the same as what Ch. Shujaat, Durrani and
Musharraf will say. If Mush and company go out on the streets people
will urinate and and spit upon them. At least the masses were waiting
for NS to return and challenge the military hegemony.

PMLNs folly was that they got too excited when they saw the reception
given to CJP. They didn't realize that it takes a clean past, conviction
and courage on the part of the leader to elicit such a response from the
masses.

As for Pakistan's democratic struggle, I am not dejected. But the civil
society has a along struggle ahead. CJP, lawyers and the bench have
restored the honor of the judiciary in the eyes of the people.
Politicians have a long road ahead to restore their prestige and honor.
The argument that in our country people only respond to heriditary
leaders and political dynasties is wrong. Did Quaid hail from a
political family? I didn't even know the full name of the CJP before his

KM, written from  the heart. You make a good point and at this point I am
not concerned with anything other than Mush's audacity to DEFY the Supreme
Court judgment thereby giving a slap to every Pakistani citizen.

You all have seen the immediate reaction of that by MQM coming out full
fledge using strong arm tactics against Sind High Court plus murdering plus
murdering a lawyer in Karachi. MQM has been emboldened!This will get worse
if Mush is not challenged by someone. He will use MQM for murder and soon
you will have some judges knocked off or killed.

I don't know what the answer is or where it lies because the entire military
command is so corrupt that they cannot think beyond the luxuries of their
fortunes... 10 bunglows in DHA's, farm houses, stables,  agriculture lands,
power, above law, kids studying in Ivy League colleges, wife's with big
accounts overseas, servants, Mercedes's, quality booze or liquor,..... name
it!

As a nation we have come to a point of such hopelessness or call it total
submission to authority that nobody has the desire to rise up. I don't have
an answer but feel that EVERY sane man / family should get out of there if
they get a chance if simply to ensure that your next generation lives in
dignity.... where ever they live, at least they will grow as proud
citizens!!!

The government and it's allies have declared an open war on the judiciary:

1. A brazen violation of SC judgement by deporting NS
2. Storming of SHC in Karachi
3. Murder of a lawyer Raja Riaz in Karachi
4. Altaf Hussain declares that we will deal with the &quot;lucha lafanga&quot;
lawyers
5. Ch Shujaat says that nation will good news about judiciary and
judges soon (this came today)
6. Yesterday Ch Shujaat said that CJ is making unconsitutional
decisions and warned judiciary of a showdown with parliament.

Ch Shujaat never makes firvolous statements. Something's cooking for sure.

Unless people from other Provinces rise against the MQM mafia, even if a
100,000 march takes place in Lahore against the strong arm tactics of MQM
and Govt against the judiciary.... Mush will stop!

If nothing happens like on Nawaz's arrival, we will see action soon... It is
so easy to trample on dead people with no courage to stand up for their
rights....

Maybe this is a divine end to a great country that was created by Jinnah.

&gt; &gt; &gt; civilian leaders, I am not defending Mush and co at all. Instead of beating
&gt; &gt; &gt; their chests Durrani, Shujaat, Mush, Sh Rashid, Shaukat Aziz and Pervez
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ilahi should walk down the streets of Pakistan without security. If they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; merely pelted with  with rotten eggs, they should consider themselves lucky.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Many years from now when these people have passed, their graves will be
&gt; &gt; &gt; treated like the grave of Farooq Abdullah in Kashmir where people come to
&gt; &gt; &gt; relieve themelves.

No one from any other province will do anything. Its the people of
Karachi who need to raise their voices against this militant outfit
which unfortunately has been successful in hiding behind a mask of a
Hezbollah type face.

Somehow the brainwashed mohajirs think Altaf is their saviour just
like Halaku Khan or Cheghaiz Khans follower would. They are the other
side of the Taliban-equation, the social talibans. And they are happy
with their leaders however evil they be. You can't do much in this
case. Wait till they wake up and see reality and understand they need
to change their leaders else they keep on living in misery and poverty
and keep on crying on Punjab's dominance. It suits Punjab to see some
evil heads at the top of MQM so they can be shown jail when required
and be crowned ( just like now) when feasible.
