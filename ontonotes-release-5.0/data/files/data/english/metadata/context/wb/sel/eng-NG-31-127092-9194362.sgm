November 1, 2007 - 6:45am

A growing number of American companies, worried about the growing
waistlines of their employees and the impact on health care costs, are
considering either a carrot or stick approach to slim their workforce.
Earlier this year an Indiana hospital chain announced plans to dock workers
paychecks if they continued to smoke and/or didn't adopt healthy lifestyles
that would reduce their blood pressure and/or cut their cholesterol levels.

The proposal was to fine workers $5 per paycheck if they smoked and to trim
$10 from each paycheck if they were overweight and didn't take steps to
slim down. Naturally it caused a firestorm of complaints.

A larger firm decided on a positive approach. It promised extra dollars to
employees whose children got into physical fitness programs. Many companies
(including Uncle Sam) now help employees with the cost of quit-smoking
programs.

Some years back, the director of an important federal agency (its initials
rhyme with O-P-M) got into a heap of trouble, and almost lost her job, for
encouraging staffers to lose weight. Her motives, aides said, were pure.
They said she was shocked and worried by the physical stature of some of
her staffers.

Health insurance premiums everywhere are going up. Many private firms have
either cut back or dropped health insurance programs because of their high
costs. Premiums in the nation's largest group plan, the Federal Employee
Health Benefits Program, are going up next year. But not nearly as fast,
thanks to the use of FEHBP reserves, as health plan premiums in the private
sector.

Many scientists link smoking and obesity with heart disease, cancer, and
diabetes. Some say the latter disease has reached near epidemic
proportions. Or soon will.

So what, if anything, should the government do? It has one of the nation's
largest workforces and each employee (and retiree) is eligible for lifetime
health care coverage. Because it's a group program, people in the same
plans pay the same premiums whether they are 25 year old marathoners or 100
year old retirees with all the aches, pains and problems associated with
old age.

A married couple without children pays the same for family plan coverage as
a couple with 10 kids. Workers with healthy lifestyles (and good genes) pay
the same premiums as very unhealthy workers and retirees in their same
plans.

So what role, if any, does the employer, especially yours, have in policing
the health of workers? Should there be a carrot-like incentive (maybe extra
pay or bonuses) for those with healthy lifestyles? Or should Uncle Sam
wield the stick and whack the wallets and purses of those without healthy
lifestyles.

The issue raises a lot of questions and, for many, sets off a lot of alarm
bells. The only sure winners so far in the private sector are lawyers hired
to defend or attack enforced lifestyle rules.

Forget lawsuit. It's a bad incentive. People respond more positively
to 110% than to 90% as a potential salary.

If you offer a bonus to employees who lose weight or quit smoking,
or improve their health in other manners, this isn't discrimination
against
the overweight, smokers or other unhealthy people. It's discrimination
against the people who are already healthy non-smokers. However, a
carefully designed incentive system, offering bonus pay for
maintenance
of health in addition to improvements might prove lawsuit proof. If
you
are overweight and smoke, you can earn the bonus or you can continue
in your unhealthy ways and cost the company more money in lost
productivity (have cited the study in Journal of Occupational and
Environmental Medicine demonstraing lower productivity from heavier
employees) and higher insurance premiums (those insurance companies
know a thing or a thousand about risk profiling I imagine, since it's
their
whole business model).

Unless, of course, you could demonstrate a causitive link between
excess
weight and productivity. At that point it's not a capability issue,
but a
performance quality issue, in the aggregate. Now, if you're
overweight, you
probably don't want to hear it and would cry discrimination, but if
you're
an employer and you want to get the most productivity out of your wage
investments, well, it's another story entirely.

How about incent people to change with extra money. With the current

strongly linked
to cancer), european style coverage is probably not feasbile. And I'm

the idea of socialized medicine. Or at least expansion of the two-tier

Hrm, god forbid anyone try to make a fat person richer and thinner. I

that the fat acceptors will be the biggest obstacle (visual pun
unintentional, but
valid) to the progress of incentive based solutions.

pay is
viewed as entitlement. Bonuses, however, are good incentives, as they
are a
reward for doing more than the base requirement for base pay. That's

I don't know if such a plan would insure victory in a lawsuit, but I can
tell you right now one would be filed.  If fat people are less productive,
then give a bonus on productivity.  If fat people are sick more, then give
a bonus on less time off sick.  Then you are rewarding things that can be
measured, quantified, and recorded.  Docking pay because a worker is fat
is morally and ethically wrong, docking pay because the weight affects the
ability to do the job is more to do with the job then the weight directly.

The same can be said about smokers...  Smokers tend to take many smoke
breaks, many more then most non-smokers.  Docking pay because they smoke
will result in a law suit.  Docking pay for frequent breaks is a job issue
rather then a personal one.

If a fat smoker can do the job, doesn't take excessive time off work for
sickness, and doesn't take too many smoke breaks, docking their pay would
NEVER stand up in a court of law, because the personal habbits are NOT
affecting work productivity.  But if they are affecting productivity, dock
because of the reduction.

We are in agreement there.  But again, that's not what this story was

Can't be worked like that. You can pay for productivity. Unless you
are in a
unionized business, like the federal government. Google: &quot;Pay
Performance
Homeland Security&quot; or &quot;Pay Performance Defense Department&quot; to see some
massive failures ate getting that by. As an insider, you'd get more
motivation
out of paying extra for weight loss than tying pay to performance.

On sick leave use, if I recall my research in the Executive branch
(1.6Mil
workers), about 20% of sick leave use is variable, across the board,
from
year to year. If you figure that that accounts for better/worse
conditions for
sickness, you're really going to pay people more for showing up to
work
sick and making others sick in a year that is more friendly to
sickness?
Nice going with that incentive. You've just caused a local epidemic.
You have
to look at the externalities.

If you pay people to maintain/get to a healthy weight, your
externalities are
mostly to your benefit. The fat, non-productive people who don't want
to lose
weight (you), probably leave the company. The fat people who can be
motivated with a simple carrot, stay, because they get extra cash for
doing
something they probably wanted to do anyway. The employer gets more
productivity out of his workforce. And can probably negotiate lower
insurance
premiums, benefiting the company and the employees. Your system of
paying for unused sick leave generates none of these benefits.

You're hung up on the docking pay. I'm gonna give cash bonuses to
people who
stop smoking. Reinforce good behavior. If I can move enough of them, I
can
get better insurance rates because I've altered my risk pool. It pays
for itself
and since few companies just outright buy health insurance, it's more
money
in the pocket of employees as well. If you explain it well, you can
create a
reinforcing peer pressure system. That's probably anathema to you, but
for
a lot of people, public commitments work wonders.

Again, I'm not docking. I'm paying an incentive for a desireable
behavior. My
theoretical productive smoker who takes no time off and no smoke
breaks
and doesn't develop lung cancer while employed by me is out nothing.
My
theoretical smoker who quits (I can talk to my insurance company about
subsidzing/funding cessation programs, even), who takes fewer breaks
and who doesn't smell like ciggies anymore, gets extra money. If
enough of
them make the change, everyone's insurance premiums drop. I don't see
a lawsuit. At least one that goes very far.

The story talks about incentive systems. One company looked at
docking. Any

that's a bad idea. The second company was looking at rewarding
desireable
changes. Wrap your head around it, and reread the whole story. Here's

Clearly, you don't understand the Goal of a business. It's to make
money.
It's that simple. How do you make money? You sell a product/service
for
more money than it costs you to produce it. If you want to make more
money, you can sell more stuff or cut costs on the same volume of
stuff.
Few other ways, but for the audience here, that's good enough.

If I can spend a little more money on bonuses to make my people be
less costly, I have effectively made money, assuming sales stays
level.
I could spend it on productivity bonuses, but in a knowledge economy,
measurement is difficult to impossible. I can also spend on incenting
behavior that will save me costs (insurance premiums) and increase
productivity (through leave use, breaks, or general slacking). Why
should
one type of incentive be off the table, a priori?

Don't get confused here. Taking pay away is a bad incentive for a lot
of
reasons, mostly psychological. But incenting desireable behavior is
not
bad, in and of itself. The company that leads the story has the right
idea
according to my research, their execution is what sucked. If they'd
done
it as bonuses rather than pay dock, only those unwilling to change and
therefore missing on the bonuses can beef. And really, I might be
better
off if they were given incentives to leave anyway.

would indirectly encourage weight loss without discrimination. If that is

In Michigan a couple of years ago a company had introduced a no smoking
policy, employees could not smoke even on their own time.  Current employees
were given a year to quit with assistance programs provided.  Some employees
sued and lost, so there is some precedent for such programs being legal.

Uhm, no. You're having reading comprehension troubles. If people are
really sick, I don't want them at work. If I pay people based on
attendance,
people come to work sick. Just where I don't want them. Why don't I
want
sick people at work? Well, there's the 40% drop in productivity (I
guess 60%
is better than the 0% I get when they're out), but also because they
make
other people sick. And I lose a lot more days and productivity. Oh,
and when
they work sick, they stay sick longer. So, instead of 1 day off, I get
3 days of
60% productivity. I'm already behind the curve there (2 days of 100%
vs 3 days
of 60% = 200% vs 180%).

You're upset because YOU, an obese person with no desire to change (I

that's
BS. You also should know that designing incentive systems is very hard
because you have to cover all the angles, or as many of them as you

Blacks are more prone to diabetes then whites...  Same question would

What about the associated time off work?

You see, the rest of your argument is all fluff...  You argue it's not

is, IS IT REALLY OK, OR IS IT DISCRIMINATION?  If you can defend my above

American free enterprise has nothing to do with controlling personal
behavior in the individual's home. Although some states do not have
current legislation prohibiting this type of draconian activity on the
part of employers, this type of policy is ethically indefensible and
is clearly a violation of personal privacy.

Also it may just be much more discriminatory than it appears on the
surface. According to the CDC many minorities are much more prone to
tobacco usage and the diseases associated with those uses and
according to psychiatric studies those afflicted with various forms of
mental illness are also more prone to tobacco usage.

So therefore if you really want to open up this can of worms, any
employer/employee policy discriminating against smoking on personal
time can be construed as also being discriminatory toward those with
mental disorders and minorities.

No one is saying that fat people should not be hired on the grounds they

of their health insurance.  It's all about lifestyle choices.  Smokers and

Interesting...

Ok, so try this on for size...

A smoker can be terminated because they MAY get cancer, thus raising the
insurance premiums of the company.  But like being asian, once a smoker
actually GETS cancer, then they are stuck.  So, what about terminating
people who currently have medical problems, should that be ok also?

If you get cancer, can your employer terminate you just to save their
medical insurance costs?  Do you support that?

Again, Master, your mastery is flawed. Both your mastery of the
insurance process and your mastery of reading leave much to be
desired.

1- Insurance works on risk profiles. So, smoking increases risk of all
things expensive and medical. Therefore, smokers are more costly to
insure. The idea of risk pooling is that you can, given large enough
pools
of risks, accurately predict the risk. So, when a smoker becomes a
cancer, the pool price has already factored the price. He's not any
more expensive just because he's incurred the cost. We forecast that.
So, while I'm out the productivity due to the cancer treatment or the
death, I'm not out additional premiums. The big thing is to adjust the
risk pool while the risk is still outstanding. Therefore, obese and
smoker
bad vs. already sick, not as bad. Again, smoking is modifiable, black
is
black.

Lastly, my advocacy extends only to strategically aligned, incentive
based, healthy behavior modifications. That's not firing and it's not
discrimination, much as your lack of Mastery of The English Language
would lead you to alternative interpretations.

Thanks for playing. Now, back to work. And maybe, slim down to
increase your productivity and make yourself more valuable to your
employer, especially if you are self employed.

I'm asking you what YOU support.  What type of abuses the employee must
endure at the hands of an employer is what this discussion is about, and
I'm trying to pin point what abuses you do and do not support.

So far, your entire argument has been &quot;they increase insurance premiums
for the healthy, and it's legal to do it&quot;.  So I am asking what other
shady terminations would you support to keep insurance low.  Again, the
legality of such terminations at this point is not the topic, it's if YOU

As such, it would seem your mastery of the english language is a tad

&gt; November 1, 2007 - 6:45am

&gt; A growing number of American companies, worried about the growing
&gt; waistlines of their employees and the impact on health care costs, are
&gt; considering either a carrot or stick approach to slim their workforce.
&gt; Earlier this year an Indiana hospital chain announced plans to dock workers
&gt; paychecks if they continued to smoke and/or didn't adopt healthy lifestyles
&gt; that would reduce their blood pressure and/or cut their cholesterol levels.

&gt; The proposal was to fine workers $5 per paycheck if they smoked and to trim
&gt; $10 from each paycheck if they were overweight and didn't take steps to
&gt; slim down. Naturally it caused a firestorm of complaints.

&gt; A larger firm decided on a positive approach. It promised extra dollars to
&gt; employees whose children got into physical fitness programs. Many companies
&gt; (including Uncle Sam) now help employees with the cost of quit-smoking
&gt; programs.

&gt; Some years back, the director of an important federal agency (its initials
&gt; rhyme with O-P-M) got into a heap of trouble, and almost lost her job, for
&gt; encouraging staffers to lose weight. Her motives, aides said, were pure.
&gt; They said she was shocked and worried by the physical stature of some of
&gt; her staffers.

&gt; Health insurance premiums everywhere are going up. Many private firms have
&gt; either cut back or dropped health insurance programs because of their high
&gt; costs. Premiums in the nation's largest group plan, the Federal Employee
&gt; Health Benefits Program, are going up next year. But not nearly as fast,
&gt; thanks to the use of FEHBP reserves, as health plan premiums in the private
&gt; sector.

&gt; Many scientists link smoking and obesity with heart disease, cancer, and
&gt; diabetes. Some say the latter disease has reached near epidemic
&gt; proportions. Or soon will.

&gt; So what, if anything, should the government do? It has one of the nation's
&gt; largest workforces and each employee (and retiree) is eligible for lifetime
&gt; health care coverage. Because it's a group program, people in the same
&gt; plans pay the same premiums whether they are 25 year old marathoners or 100
&gt; year old retirees with all the aches, pains and problems associated with
&gt; old age.

&gt; A married couple without children pays the same for family plan coverage as
&gt; a couple with 10 kids. Workers with healthy lifestyles (and good genes) pay
&gt; the same premiums as very unhealthy workers and retirees in their same
&gt; plans.

&gt; So what role, if any, does the employer, especially yours, have in policing
&gt; the health of workers? Should there be a carrot-like incentive (maybe extra
&gt; pay or bonuses) for those with healthy lifestyles? Or should Uncle Sam
&gt; wield the stick and whack the wallets and purses of those without healthy
&gt; lifestyles.

&gt; The issue raises a lot of questions and, for many, sets off a lot of alarm
&gt; bells. The only sure winners so far in the private sector are lawyers hired
&gt; to defend or attack enforced lifestyle rules.

Incremental nannyism! Before we know it the government will be wiping
our
bottoms for us. You know what's great about living in a prison? You
have
all the security you want (even if you don't want it). But there's one
problem:
total security means NO FREEDOM. Mull that over, peeps.

I've been very clear what I support. Incentive based modifiable risk
modification.
If you want to know specifically what I would pay people more to do:
1- Quit smoking
2- lose some weight (or maintain over the holidays) (or gain some if
you're
unhealthy skinny)
3- Maybe move more, like walking or taking the stairs instead of the
elevator.

That's it. If you don't want to lose some weight, you get your base
pay, and
any bonus based on your performance, same as before. If you do want
to,
and you do it, you get some extra pay, maybe at the end of the year.
You
get the sense of accomplishment, and a reward. I get what I get.

I have not suggested terminating anyone. If I'm running the company,
I'm
gonna terminate 10% on a rolling basis for poor performance. If they
all
happen to be morbidly obese, well, we have correlation, and when they
sue (as they inevitably will), my portly trial lawyer will point to my
performance data and my policies regarding performance, lifted
straight
from management guru Jack Welch, and, well, I hope those unmotivated,
bottom 10% employees can figure out how to pay their lawyer without
their
jobs and a lawsuit victory, because they're not getting either.

I have been clear. Your understanding has been lacking. This is the
first
I have said about terminations. You continue to bring terminations
into
my argument, so clearly, you are either not paying attention or you
are
engaging in a less than worthy debate tactic. You're welcome to talk
about performance based terminations. And you're welcome to talk to
me about positive incentive based modifiable risk health promotion.
That's
all that I've talked about in this thread (or really anywhere else).

Your understanding of the business is lacking.

I insure 1000 smokers. If 1000 of them develop lung cancer, then, yes,
I will raise rates, or in all liklihood, will be out of business, and
will insure
no smokers (and no one else, either). If, however, the standard
percentage
develop lung cancer (this is an over simplified model for a simple
reader),
the fees I have charged them have covered all of their lung cancer
health
costs (the ones I cover), and left me with a tidy profit (and as an
exec,
a fat compensation package). I will raise rates with projections on
the
cost of treatment, but if incidence according to existing models
doesn't
affect my bottom line. Incidence below and above my model do.

Now, let's add a level of complexity. I insure a million people. 20%
of them
smoke. And 50% of the smokers go on to lung cancer, per the standard
rate (these are out the top of my head, not based in real, but will
suffice
for our purposes). So, 800K non smokers, and we'll give them a 10%
shot at lung cancer. (For the sake of this model, let's make lung
cancer
a proxy for all expensive occurances). And that's per model as well.
So,
I have 180K people who will get majorly sick over the course of my
insuring them. That's my prediction, so I charge fees that will allow
me to
invest, cover all the costs of these illnesses, and leave me with tidy
profits and a fat compensation package. Now, if I have profit sharing
(or stock options, or however you want to pay me more for having
more in the kitty at the end of the experiment), and I can move even
1% of my people away from smoking, I've increased my profit, assuming
I don't pay a lot to get there. Check the math. Say I move 50% of my
smokers off the ciggys and they rejoin the regular risk pool. So,
instead of 180K very sick people, I wind up with... er... ah... 50K +
90K = 140K very sick people. I've saved the cost of 40K sickies.

Back to the point. I'm an insurance company. I know people get sick.
It's
built into my fee schedule. It's a futures game. When one individual
actually gets sick in a risk pool, I was essentially expecting him or
someone else to get sick. I've already paid for it. So, why would I
change my rates. The thing I worry about is frequency of incidence.
As long as my projections are good (and the market doesn't screw
me: see 1999-2001), I don't need to raise rates, except with the
rising
cost of treating these people.

Before you respond, really think through an insurance company's
business model. Start with the question of how they make money.
It's the core question in any business and if you can't answer it,
you have no real business talking about that business. If you have
trouble understanding an insurance business model, maybe a
casino would be easier for you to understand. It's the same business
model.

At one point, I had medical insurance that had a very low requirement for
weight loss surgery.  All you had to do was have a high enough BMI to
qualify.  My wife at the time had her lap band covered by my medical

providers due to the drastic increase in premiums.  I also know for a fact
that the insurance company has since changed their qualifications for the
weight loss surgery to make it more difficult (but I don't know when the

I don't remember what the qualification BMI was, but I *THINK* it was
45...  Anyhow, they are gambling on several factors.  First, how many
people have a BMI over 45.  Then, how many have their medical insurance.

I haven't suggested I'm in the insurance business. I've only suggested

make an attempt to understand how the business works. You clearly

Master, please master yourself and your reason.

Here's a theory for you. They set the bar at BMI 45 (not low, maybe
for SSFA,
but not low for the general public). They made a guess at how many
people
would qualify and go through with it. It's novel (that means new...
and by that
I mean the widespread use of it is new), so the error bar on the risk
pool
projection is as wide as The Master's average girlfriend. More
evidence leads
to a better prediction as to costs. Considering the ease with which
local
news producers are able to obtain the B-roll of fat people from the
shoulders
down for use in obesity stories, clearly, there are more candidates
for
the surgery than perhaps they previously estimated. Consider the CDC's
estimation of obesity. I don't think they even estimate a BMI 45+
category,
but the rise in 30+ has been pretty steady and not really foreseeable
by
a government obsessed with dietary fat and cholesterol, never mind an
insurance company relying on that government's data.

That's one plausible explanation where one incidence of absurd medical
charges for one doesn't affect the costs of the masses. I can give you
others. Given the dates, we might look at market performance. Knowing
what we (or at least I) know about how an insurance company works,
we know that they invest in the market. Bad market conditions tend to
raise premiums. If your cautionary tale came from, I dunno, say 2001
or 2002, again, we have a very simple explanation that doesn't require
your wife's lap band surgery or your friend's chemotherapy or even
your
degenerative knee condition to explain a large rate hike.

I have a few other possible explanations that explain your anecdotal
experience while not exploding the entire basis of an insurance
company's
business model, but frankly, you've been exploded enough.

If you're so smart, please explain how an insurance company actually
makes money. Under 200 words. And then explain how that's consonant
with your belief that your (ex)wife's lap band surgery drove up your
employer's insurance premia to the point where your employer had to
switch. Perhaps your employer was insuring you through a very small
company or an in house plan. A small sample risk pool would skew
results.
