The owners usually have a litter every 6-12 months, and they usually
sell them for $200 each (according to the Freecycle ad).  Because the
local paper is no longer offering free, unlimited classifieds
(andalsoplustoo &quot;recent family tragedies&quot;), the owners are either
giving the pups away free or they're charging $150 or OBO.  (I'm
guessing they want to get as much money as possible, but made a
Freecycle post just in case?  I dunno what's up with the multiple
prices.)

Anyway, the next to last photo is pretty damned cute.  That's a pup
with Attitude.

Indeed.  Hopefully, they'll refrain from repeating this experiment,

I don't see that taking a free pup is supporting their bad decisions.
I mean, yes, it would mean taking a problem off their hands, but the
pups have to have homes.  As long as they aren't clogging up
shelters/rescues, and the &quot;breaders&quot; aren't getting paid for the
pups, I don't have a problem with it.

Apparently, as they were posted to our local Freecycle group.  Though
I'm sure the &quot;breaders&quot; would not turn down money.

And, no, I'm not going to get one of them.  I think a puppy might
drive me out of my mind, for one, and for two, I've got an ancient
cat who is starting to need more frequent vet care, so my
discretionary money has to be put aside for that.  Also, big chunks
of time, because some old cats apparently require all sorts of extra
attention.  Who knew?!

Oh yes, she needs lots and lots of attention and a warm lap at all times

I had a similar situation 6 years ago -- my elderly cat, Nickleby, who I
had from my mid-20's to my early 40's, died, and then 2 days later my
mother died suddenly. I was literally howling with grief. Two months
later, I got Zoe as a puppy. Not only did she make me laugh a lot, she
got me out of the house.

I've never experienced an unexpected pet death.  Still,
multiple dogs work well for me, and them, I think.  I like two
dogs in the house and by periodically having three, I know
that I won't be in a rush to replace.

I thoroughly enjoyed the years I thought about getting a puppy
and then the year I spent making it real.

Please post your about progress and thinking.

Yup - reminds one that training is not the same for every dog, that a
nap on the couch is potential for some serious mischief, all sorts of
interesting things.

Surely having more than one dog is enough to remind you of
that, but

and it's not just naps on the couch.  The world is full of
potential, and it takes a youthful puppy imagination to
tease out the possibilities.

Very early in the game, but I would ideally like to bring a puppy home
anywhere between May and October.  That means born March-August, bred
January-June.    Since Lucy is going to be 11 in December, and I really
do love having 3 dogs, next Spring/Summer/Fall is the target time frame.

Health is a really big priority, even though I know there are no
guarantees.  I'm looking at a currently cancer-free line and hoping for
one particular breeding that should take place sometime in March.  That
doesn't guarantee the puppy I'm looking for of course, but I want a
lightly built bitch puppy with good drive.  Field and flyball are my top
needs and I think those can be fairly easily fulfilled with the same
temperament details.

I'll be sure to post updates along the way, don't want to jinx anything
either!

&gt; I've never experienced an unexpected pet death.  Still,
&gt; multiple dogs work well for me, and them, I think.  I like two
&gt; dogs in the house and by periodically having three, I know
&gt; that I won't be in a rush to replace.

I think three dogs is a good number.  Whenever I take one of my dogs
somewhere alone, I always feel guilty about leaving one home alone.  If I
had two left at home and one with me, then I wouldn't feel as guilty because
at least they would have each other.  My plan is to finish grad school, move
somewhere more dog friendly and then get either a Standard Poodle or a PWD.
I've thought about PWD is the past but would definately want to live
somewhere I'll be able to be more dog active first so I can do water trials,
dock diving, agility, flyball, or something with the PWD.

&gt; I want a mini Bella. I just want to clone her and shrink her and keep
&gt; her for ever and ever. Spencer, too.

&gt; I swear I will end up as one of those people who spends years with an
&gt; auxiliary dog under her arm.

Yes, I have seen our old age first-hand, and it's not as scary as you
might think. The toy dogs welcome us to their teeny-tiny fold.

Yes, this form of rationalizing does actually work, at least for me.

But then, if you want to take 2 dogs somewhere, the other one is lonely.

Therefore, a safe number would be, um, 73.

(Just teasing, Jenny -- actually 3 does work well, IME.)

glad it works for you, then it should work for me too!

I can see where this is a problem.  I think I would rarelly take 2 anywhere
that the third couldn't also come.

ok, I will get right on that!
