Looking at the list, one sees who the original church fathers were , who
were sent by Christ to preach to the world, but not only their but also
where the church existed (though their presence)  in the  years
following the Crucifixion

http://benedictseraphim.wordpress.com/2007/01/04/the-synaxis-of-the-7...

&quot;The Church in particular venerates and praises the Seventy Apostles
because they taught us to honor the Trinity One in Essence and Undivided.

In the ninth century St Joseph the Hymnographer composed the Canon for
the Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles of Christ.&quot;
followed by the list and names.

&quot;....................................

27. Demas, who also became a priest of idols.

28. Apelles, bishop of Smyrna.

29. Aristobulus, bishop of Britain.

30. Narcissus, bishop of Athens.

31. Herodion, bishop of Tarsus.

32. Agabus the prophet.

................................&quot;

Presumably, they would have all been on the same page at that time.

From the above site (url) more text, with out the lists if names; the
mention of Joseph the Hymnographer last paragraph.
One may google for his works.

Also I found several sites with different accompanying info by doing a
google the seventy apostles. Very interesting stuff. Not usually
mentioned in the history of the Church.. whereveris took root.

Comments The Synaxis of the 70 Holy Apostles
Jan 4th, 2007 by Benedict Seraphim

Troparion of the Seventy Apostles Tone 3
With the use of divine faith you caught the nations,/ O Seventy Apostles
of the Lord;/ and you lead them into the knowledge of God/ as those who
had received the grace of the Spirit./ O inspired initiates,/ intercede
with Christ our God/ that He grant us His great mercy.

Kontakion of the Seventy Apostles Tone 2
Let us praise the choirs of Christ’s Seventy Disciples, O faithful,/ and
celebrate their festival./ They have taught us to worship the Undivided
Trinity;/ for they are divine lamps of the Faith.

From the OCA website:

The Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles was established by the Orthodox
Church to indicate the equal honor of each of the Seventy. They were
sent two by two by the Lord Jesus Christ to go before Him into the
cities He would visit (Luke 10:1).

Besides the celebration of the Synaxis of the Holy Disciples, the Church
celebrates the memory of each of them during the course of the year:

St James the Brother of the Lord (October 23); Mark the Evangelist
(April 25); Luke the Evangelist (October 18); Cleopas (October 30),
brother of St Joseph the Betrothed, and Simeon his son (April 27);
Barnabas (June 11); Joses, or Joseph, named Barsabas or Justus (October
30); Thaddeus (August 21); Ananias (October 1); Protomartyr Stephen the
Archdeacon (December 27); Philip the Deacon (October 11); Prochorus the
Deacon (28 July); Nicanor the Deacon (July 28 and December 28); Timon
the Deacon (July 28 and December 30); Parmenas the Deacon (July 28);
Timothy (January 22); Titus (August 25); Philemon (November 22 and
February 19); Onesimus (February 15); Epaphras and Archippus (November
22 and February 19); Silas, Silvanus, Crescens or Criscus (July 30);
Crispus and Epaenetos (July 30); Andronicus (May 17 and July 30);
Stachys, Amplias, Urban, Narcissus, Apelles (October 31); Aristobulus
(October 31 and March 16); Herodion or Rodion (April 8 and November 10);
Agabus, Rufus, Asyncritus, Phlegon (April 8); Hermas (November 5,
November 30 and May 31); Patrobas (November 5); Hermes (April 8); Linus,
Gaius, Philologus (November 5); Lucius (September 10); Jason (April 28);
Sosipater (April 28 and November 10); Olympas or Olympanus (November 10
); Tertius (October 30 and November 10); Erastos (November 30), Quartus
(November 10); Euodius (September 7); Onesiphorus (September 7 and
December 8); Clement (November 25); Sosthenes (December 8); Apollos
(March 30 and December 8); Tychicus, Epaphroditus (December 8); Carpus
(May 26); Quadratus (September 21); Mark (September 27), called John,
Zeno (September 27); Aristarchus (April 15 and September 27); Pudens and
Trophimus (April 15); Mark nephew of Barnabas, Artemas (October 30);
Aquila (July 14); Fortunatus (June 15) and Achaicus (January 4).

With the Descent of the Holy Spirit the Seventy Apostles preached in
various lands. Some accompanied the Twelve Apostles, like the holy
Evangelists Mark and Luke, or St Paul’s companion Timothy, or
Prochorus,the disciple of the holy Evangelist John the Theologian, and
others. Many of them were thrown into prison for Christ, and many
received the crown of martyrdom.

There are two more Apostles of the Seventy: St Cephas, to whom the Lord
appeared after the Resurrection (1 Cor. 15:5-6), and Simeon, called
Niger (Acts 13:1). They also were glorified by apostolic preaching.

There are discrepancies and errors in some lists of the Seventy
Apostles. In a list attributed to St Dorotheus of Tyre (June 5) some
names are repeated (Rodion, or Herodion, Apollos, Tychicus,
Aristarchus), while others are omitted (Timothy, Titus, Epaphras,
Archippus, Aquila, Olympas). St Demetrius of Rostov consulted the Holy
Scripture, the traditions passed down by the Fathers, and the accounts
of trustworthy historians when he attempted to correct the mistakes and
uncertainties in the list in compiling his collection of Lives of the
Saints.

The Church in particular venerates and praises the Seventy Apostles
because they taught us to honor the Trinity One in Essence and Undivided.

In the ninth century St Joseph the Hymnographer composed the Canon for
the Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles of Christ.

Hippolytus, spur. - Appendix: Dubious and Spurious Pieces
Works whose inauthenticity has been suggested or established: Discourse on
the End of the Word, Antichrist, and the Second Coming; On the Twelve
Apostles; On the Seventy Apostles; Heads of the Canons of Abulides or
Hippolytus, used by Aethiopian Christians; Canons of the Church of
Alexandria, wrongly ascribed to Hippolytus.

To any real scholar, the list by Hippolytus is considered spurious.

(or is anything you haven't  researched yourself 'spurious'  ?)

***********************
here's another source , Shall I  collect all of them which are available
to anyone who bother to look them up?) :

The Orthodox Church &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Church &gt;
tradition of supplying names to the Seventy whose &quot;names are written in
heaven&quot; is associated with a late 3rd century bishop Dorotheus of Tyre
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorotheus_of_Tyre &gt;, unknown except in this
context, to whom has been ascribed an account of the Seventy, of which
the surviving version is 8th century. The names of these disciples are
given in several lists: Chronicon Paschale
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicon_Paschale &gt;, and the
Pseudo-Dorotheus (printed in Migne's Patrologiae cursus completus
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrologia_Graeca &gt;, XCII, 521-524;
543-545; 1061-1065).

Roman Catholic &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic &gt; scholars
commonly judged that &quot;these lists are unfortunately worthless&quot; (Catholic
Encyclopedia &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia &gt;, 1908,
&quot;Apostle&quot;).

Eusebius &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusebius_of_Caesarea &gt; positively
asserted that no such roll existed in his time, and mentioned among the
disciples only Barnabas &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnabas &gt;,
Sosthenes &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosthenes &gt;, Cephas
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_of_Jesus#Cephas &gt;, Matthias
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias &gt;, Thaddeus
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus &gt; and James &quot;the Lord's brother&quot;
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_the_Just &gt; (Historia Ecclesiae I.xii).

Many of the names included among the Seventy are recognizable for their
other achievements. The names included in various lists differ slightly.
In the lists Luke &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_the_Evangelist &gt; is
also one of these seventy himself. The following list gives a widely

A little research would tell you that any list of the to apostles is based on Hippolytus, and thus based on a sourious work!!

If you pursue research, perhaps you should branch out to actual books, and not rely some much on the internet.

I will take your advice, and disregard the information I receive from
you via the internet.

As for the internet it allows one access to information  in a way that
is not possible  through buying books, running around the globe to
different cities that may have that 'special' copy.

You however seem to think you know more than anyone else  including many
with PHD's that have made their lifework available to all through the
internet. (without trashing the work of others as the ignorant tend to do)

t he catholic view point  often disagrees with  waht the Orthodox say.

so what?

Analyse what you read andwho it is from  and why they are saying it

The Pope even said recently that the Orthodox are in error  so what ,
That does not make it true.  I t is his opinion based on the facts he
believes are true.

hen you will have orthodox denouncing other denominations and what they
believe to be true  etc  etc.

Instead of accusing people of being dumb  .. learn to filter what you
read.   Even in propaganda there will be asome truth.

Whether it is hard copy or virtual copy doesn't matter.

And for you.. you seem to be a know-it all who hides behind a pseudonym
..  and  that indicates to me that  your  name should be filtered out

Thanks,
You know Who got me through it  :)

back to the thread, my hopes was to bring discussion between the
different  Apostolic Churches, looking back to our roots and those who
spread the faith,

I believe that they brought their message to different cultures and
through history and politics evolved different rites and customs
according to the society where they found converts.

I.E  Celtic brtain was vastly differnt that Coptic Ethioplia
Yet within these fiferences the core values remained the same.

Unfortunately today each rite seems to think it is the only
'church'...and the other are invalid, for so many reasons.

One thing I found interesting was yesterday at the Cathedral they were
using  book alternate services  which resemble the BCP  except 'thou' is
replaced by 'you' etc and notably the version of the Nicene Creed, has
the filioque removed  !!

&quot; We believe in the Holy Spirit,
the Lord, the giver of life,

who has spoken through the prophets.
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&quot;

An interesting point is that all the Apostolic
Churches have the same four Gospels whether
Aramaic, Greek, Coptic, Vetus Latin or others.
You need to be an expert to point out the differences.

Even in ancient times this was pointed out.

Let me give a quote by Terullian circa 200 A.D.

&quot;run over [to] the Apostolic Churches, in which the very thrones
of the Apostles are still pre-emminent in their places, in which
their own authentic writings (autheniticae) are read, uttering the
voice and representing the face of them severally . Achaia is very
near you, (in which) you find Corinth. Since you are not far from
Macedonia, you have Philippi;; (and there too) you have the
Thessalononians. Since you are able to cross to Asia[minor], you
get Ephesus. Since, morever, you are close upon Italy, you have
Rome, from which there comes even into our own hands the very
authority
(of the Apostles themselves).

Prescription against Heretics, p 36, Voll III, &quot;The Ante-Nicene
Fathers&quot;

Today, all you need to do is go over
to your local Bible Society to check
that out.

Most of the time we see references to the twelve (plus Paul)  however
there  are others - apostles that were sent out as well:

&quot;Luke:10:1: After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also,
and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place,
whither he himself would come.&quot;
These are the ones (in the list of seventy from the Orthodox church) who
went out in the first century, including  Aristobulus, Bishop of Britain.

And even more about Tertullian!!

It was after the year 206 that he joined the Montanist sect, and he seems to
have definitively separated from the Church about 211 (Harnack) or 213
(Monceaux). After writing more virulently against the Church than even
against heathen and persecutors, he separated from the Montanists and
founded a sect of his own.

Always amazes me, how religionists always quote from him, but never from his
writings against the church!!

But then the church always quotes selectively.

&gt; And that has what to do with the thoughts of Tertullian from 206Ad until his
&gt; death, when he was writing against the church??

THE CHOOSING OF THE SEVENTY HOLY APOSTLES
As recounted by Dorotheus, Bishop of Tyre, an ancient and pious man, who
became a martyr in the reign of the emperors Licinius and Constantine.
This above-mentioned and exemplary man left us various writings in Greek and
Latin, for he was proficient in both languages and possessed of great
intelligence. After the death of Diocletian and Licinius, he returned home
and ruled the church of Tyre until Julian the torturer came to power; for
Julian did not kill Christians openly, but secretly through his princes.
Dorotheus came once more to the city of Odessus polis, where he was seized
by Julian's princes and suffered many tortures in his very old age for
confessing Christ, and died as a martyr at the age of one hundred and
seventy. This saintly Dorotheus speaks of the seventy apostles and disciples
of Christ, many of whom were bishops among different peoples, while others
served as preachers, whom the divine Paul mentions in tile salutations in
his epistles. Many years after the resurrection of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, he found all of them and recorded them, their names being as
follows:

1.. JACOB , brother of the Lord, first bishop of Jerusalem, who was
ordained by the Lord Himself, whose head was crushed by a whiffletree and he
died.
2.. CLEOPAS was the second bishop of Jerusalem like Simeon, brother of the
Lord; he saw the Lord after the resurrection, and died crucified by Emperor
Dometian.
3.. THADDEUS , who carried the letter to Avgar in Edessa: he cured the
latter of his illness.
4.. ANANIAS , who baptized the holy Apostle Paul, was bishop of Damascus.
5.. STEPHEN , the first martyr, died after being stoned by the Jews.
6.. PHILIP , one of the seven [deacons], who baptized Simon the sorcerer
and Canalace's eunuch, was bishop of Asian Tralia.

first wrote the holy Gospel to a certain ruler Theophilus, who believed in
Christ. Then, many years after the passion of our Lord, and the holy Apostle
Peter having commanded him to narrate the acts of the holy apostles, Saint
Luke narrated the acts of the holy apostles to the same TheophiIus, And
having done this, he gave up his soul to God in peace; and thus he died in
Thebes. His holy relics were translated from Thebes to the church of the
Holy Apostles, and were layed under the altar table.

through all his persecutions; in the end they were beheaded in Rome by
Emperor Nero.
69.. ONESIMUS died in Potiole at the hands of the Roman ruler Tertillus.
All of these were bishops among the pagans. The saintly and most-blessed
Dorotheus, while he was bishop of the church of Tyre, wrote about them and
left his writings to the church, in order to commemorate the holy apostles,
about whom even Paul wrote, saying: they were servants of God before us. May
no one disbelieve it, for it is the truth.

THE FOURTH DAY OF THE MONTH OF JANUARY

The Synaxis of the Holy Seventy Apostles

From The Great Collection of the Lives of the Saints, Volume 5: January,
compiled by St. Demetrius of Rostov

After choosing the Twelve, Christ the Lord selected seventy lesser apostles
and sent them out to preach, as the holy Evangelist Luke writes: After these
things the Lord appointed other seventy also; and sent them two and two
before His face. The Twelve generally remained at Christ's side, serving as
witnesses to His life; but the Seventy preceded Him in every place He
visited. We do not know the names of all the original Seventy, for, as Saint
John the Evangelist tells us, the time came when many of His disciples went
back, and walked no more with Him. Then said Jesus unto the Twelve, Will ye
also go away? As the Lord's Passion approached, the number of His disciples
decreased further: hardly any of the Seventy remained, and one of the Twelve
betrayed Him. After the Resurrection Matthias was numbered with the Twelve,
while the ranks of the Seventy were gradually filled with men newly
converted to piety by the Twelve Apostles and Saint Paul, who was called by
heaven to preside (with Saint Peter) over the apostolic choir.

At the beginning of the printed version of the Book of Acts and in The
Prologue, the Seventy Apostles are identified in a listing ascribed to the
holy hieromartyr Dorotheus, Bishop of Tyre. However, some of the men
mentioned in the roll, while apostles at first, later fell from the faith
and the dignity of their office. Such were Nicholas, the proselyte of
Antioch (one of the seven deacons, who apostatized with Simon Magus);
Phygellus; Hermogenes; and Demus, about whom Saint Paul writes to Timothy:
This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me;
of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes; and, Demus hath forsaken me, having
loved this present world. Later, Demus became a heathen priest in
Thessalonica. Of these men Saint John the Theologian wrote in his First
General Epistle, They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they
had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us. They proved
themselves unworthy to be included among the saints whose synaxis we
celebrate today, for what communion hath light with darkness? Furthermore,
the Holy Church includes in the calendar of saints and reveres as apostles
of the Seventy a number of holy men (such as Timothy, Titus, Epaphras,
Archippus, Aquila, Olympas, Quadratus, and Achaicus) missing from the list
preserved under Dorotheus' name. Because of these and other deficiencies and
uncertainties in the enumeration ascribed to Saint Dorotheus, we have
carefully investigated the divine Scriptures, the traditions handed down by
the Fathers, and the accounts of trustworthy ecclesiastical historians and
chroniclers and compiled the following roster of holy apostles commemorated
on this day:

I. Saint James, Brother of the Lord (Commemorated October 23)

The holy Apostle Paul refers to James in the Epistle to the Galatians,
saying, I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, but other of the apostles saw I
none, save James the Lord's brother. Saint James was appointed Bishop of
Jerusalem by the Lord Himself. The Jews hurled him from the pinnacle of the
Temple for preaching Christ. He was injured, but not killed, when he struck
the pavement below, so one of the Pharisees shattered his skull with a club,
finishing him.

II. Saint Mark the Evangelist (April 25)

Mark wrote his Gospel under the direction of Saint Peter and is mentioned by
that Apostle in his First General Epistle. Peter writes, The church that is
at Babylon saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son. Peter ordained Mark Bishop
of Alexandria. The idolaters of that city bound him, dragged him over jagged
rocks, and beat him; whereupon, the Lord appeared, summoned him to heavenly
glory, and received his spirit.

III. Saint Luke the Evangelist (October 18)

Luke wrote his Gospel under the guidance of the holy Apostle Paul, who
mentions him in the Epistle to the Colossians, saying, Luke, the beloved
physician, and Demas, greet you. Saint Luke also wrote the Acts of the
Apostles. After toiling greatly in Christ's service, Luke completed his
labors in Thebes, a city of Boetia, where he was martyred.

IV. Saint Cleopas, Younger Brother of Joseph the Betrothed (October 30)

In his Gospel, Saint Luke writes that Cleopas was one of the two disciples
to whom the Lord appeared on the road to Emmaus after His Resurrection. Luke
was the other, although he does not mention his own name. Cleopas was
subsequently slain by the Jews for preaching Christ, the murder taking place
in the very house where the risen Lord was known by him in the breaking of
bread.

V. Saint Symeon, Kinsman of the Lord (September 17 and April 27)

Saint Symeon was the second Bishop of Jerusalem, James' successor. He was
crucified for the crucified Christ.

VI. Saint Barnabas, Also Known as Joses (June 11)

According to the fourth chapter of the Book of Acts, this saint was surnamed
Barnabas by the apostles. He is also mentioned in the second chapter of the
Epistle to the Galatians, wherein Saint Paul writes, I went up to Jerusalem
with Barnabas. Laboring in the ministry of the word, he was first (with
Saint Paul) to preach Christ in Rome. He became Bishop of Milan and met his
end on Cyprus, his homeland, being stoned by Greeks and Jews. Saint Barnabas
was buried with a copy of Saint Matthew's Gospel which he had written with
his own hand.

VII. Saint Joses or Joseph, Also Called Barsabas and Justus (October 30)

Joses was one of the two candidates chosen as possible replacements for the
fallen Judas (the other was Matthias). Saint Paul refers to him in the
Epistle to the Colossians as Jesus, which is called Justus. The teachers of
the Church say that Joses was a son of Joseph the Betrothed, like James,
Simon, and Judas (not Iscariot). He became Bishop of Eleutheropolis and died
a martyr.

VIII. Saint Thaddaeus (August 21)

Thaddaeus was first a disciple of Saint John the Forerunner, then of Christ.
He is not to be confused with the holy Apostle Jude or Judas Thaddaeus, also
known as Lebbaeus. Thaddaeus baptized Abgar, Prince of Edessa, and cleansed
him of leprosy. After laboring much in proclaiming the gospel of Christ, he
reposed in the Lord in the Phoenician city of Beirut.

IX. Saint Ananias (October 1)

The holy Ananias baptized Saint Paul and was Bishop of Damascus. Lucian,
Governor of Eleutheropolis, had him put to death by stoning outside that
city.

X. Saint Stephen, Protomartyr and Archdeacon (December 27)

Saint Stephen was stoned by the Jews for preaching the Lord Jesus Christ,
Whom he beheld standing in the heavens.

XI. Saint Philip, One of the Seven Deacons (October 11)

Philip baptized Simon Magus (in Samaria) and Candace's eunuch. He became
Bishop of Tralles in Asia Minor, enlightened many in the faith, and departed
unto eternal life in great old age.

XII. Saint Prochorus, One of the Seven Deacons (July 28)

Prochorus was Saint John the Theologian's companion and fellow-laborer. He
became the first Bishop of Nicomedia in Bithynia and suffered martyrdom
while preaching Christ in Antioch.

XIII. Saint Nicanor, One of the Seven Deacons (December 27 and July 28)

Saint Nicanor, with two thousand other Christians, was slain for Christ on
the same day as the holy protomartyr Stephen, as related in the Acts of the
Apostles, which states, At that time there was a great persecution against
the church which was at Jerusalem.

XIV. Saint Timon, One of the Seven Deacons (July 28 and December 30)

Timon was Bishop of Bostra in Arabia. He suffered greatly at the hands of
the Jews for preaching Christ. Cast into a fiery furnace, he emerged
unharmed, then departed unto the Lord.

XV. Saint Parmenas, One of the Seven Deacons (July 28)

Parmenas was slain before the eyes of the other apostles while preaching the
gospel.

XVI. Saint Timothy (January 22)

Timothy, the Bishop of Ephesus, helped Saint Paul spread the gospel and
received letters from him.

XVII. Saint Titus (August 25)

Titus, the Bishop of Gortyna in Crete, also labored with Saint Paul in
proclaiming the gospel and received a letter from him.

XVIII. Saint Philemon (November 22)

Philemon, the recipient of one of Saint Paul's letters, was Bishop of Gaza.

XIX. Saint Onesimus (February 15)

The holy Onesimus, mentioned by Paul in his epistle to Philemon, was
tortured by Tertillus, Prefect of Rome, and died in Puteoli.

XX. Saint Epaphras

Epaphras is also mentioned by Saint Paul in the Epistle to Philemon. Paul
states, &quot;Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee.&quot;
Epaphras was Bishop of Colossae and also of the churches of Laodicea and
Hierapolis. He shared Paul's captivity in Rome, whence the great Apostle
wrote the Colossians, Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ,
saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may
stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. For I bear him record,
that he hath a great zeal of you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in
Hierapolis.

XXI. Saint Archippus (November 22 and February 19)

Archippus, like Onesimus and Epaphras, is mentioned in the Epistle to
Philemon. While Saint Epaphras was being held at Rome in fetters, Archippus
succeeded him as Bishop of Colossae. Archippus was tending the flock of
Christ in that city when Saint Paul wrote him this reminder: Take heed to
the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.

XXII. Saint Silas (July 30)

With Saint Paul, the holy Silas preached the word of God, was flogged, and
imprisoned. The Acts of the Apostles relates that Paul chose Silas and
departed, confirming the churches. Silas became Bishop of Corinth and
greatly labored proclaiming the gospel. After working numerous miracles, he
departed to the Lord.

XXIII. Saint Silvanus

From the catholic encylopedia -

Again, in &quot;De pud.&quot;, Tertullian repudiates his own earlier teaching that the
keys were left by Christ through Peter to His Church (Scorpiace, x); he now
declares (De pud., xxi) that the gift was to Peter personally, and cannot be
claimed by the Church of the Psychici. The spiritual have the right to
forgive, but the Paraclete said: &quot;The Church has the power to forgive sins
but I will not do so, lest they sin afresh.&quot;

And -

This work, &quot;De exhortatione castitatis&quot;, implies that the writer is not yet
separated from the Church. The same excessive rigour appears in the &quot;De
corona&quot;, in which Tertullian defends a soldier who had refused to wear a
chaplet on his head when he received the donative granted to the army on the
accession of Caracalla and Geta in 211. The man had been degraded and
imprisoned. Many Christians thought his action extravagant, and refused to
regard him as a martyr. Tertullian not only declares that to wear the crown
would have been idolatry, but argues that no Christian can be a soldier
without compromising his faith.

Very interesting idea on a soldier!!

hit send before I was done -

Trinity??

His Trinitarian teaching is inconsistent, being an amalgamation of the Roman
doctrine with that of St. Justin Martyr. Tertullian has the true formula for
the Holy Trinity, tres Personae, una Substantia. The Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost are numerically distinct, and each is God; they are of one substance,
one state, and one power. So far the doctrine is accurately Nicene. But by
the side of this appears the Greek view which was one day to develop into
Arianism: that the unity is to be sought not in the Essence but in the
origin of the Persons. He says that from all eternity there was reason
(ratio) in God, and in reason the Word (Sermo), not distinct from God, but
in vulva cordis. For the purpose of creation the Word received a perfect
birth as Son. There was a time when there was no Son and no sin, when God
was neither Father nor Judge.

There was a time when there was no son??

Interesting.

And I like this one -

The formal secession of Tertullian from the Church of Carthage seems to have
taken place either in 211 or at the end of 212 at latest. The earlier date
is fixed by Harnack on account of the close connection between the &quot;De
corona&quot; of 211 with the &quot;De fuga&quot;, which must, he thinks, have immediately
followed the &quot;De corona&quot;. It is certain that &quot;De fuga in persecutione&quot; was
written after the secession. It condemns flight in time of persecution, for
God's providence has intended the suffering. This intolerable doctrine had
not been held by Tertullian in his Catholic days.

Once he changed his mind it became an INTOLERABLE DOCTRINE!!

Obviously the thrust of all this is way over your head.

The point, which seems to have escaped you, is that the man had different
points of view at different times in his life, and you like to pick out the
ones that you agree with, and reject the ones that you don't like.

That is selectively using his writings.

Sort of pick and choose!!

&gt; THE CHOOSING OF THE SEVENTY HOLY APOSTLES
&gt; As recounted by Dorotheus, Bishop of Tyre, an ancient and pious man, who

&gt; This above-mentioned and exemplary man left us various writings in Greek
and
&gt; Latin, for he was proficient in both languages and possessed of great
&gt; intelligence. After the death of Diocletian and Licinius, he returned home
&gt; and ruled the church of Tyre until Julian the torturer came to power; for
&gt; Julian did not kill Christians openly, but secretly through his princes.
&gt; Dorotheus came once more to the city of Odessus polis, where he was seized
&gt; by Julian's princes and suffered many tortures in his very old age for
&gt; confessing Christ, and died as a martyr at the age of one hundred and
&gt; seventy. This saintly Dorotheus speaks of the seventy apostles and
disciples
&gt; of Christ, many of whom were bishops among different peoples, while others
&gt; served as preachers, whom the divine Paul mentions in tile salutations in
&gt; his epistles. Many years after the resurrection of our Lord and Saviour

&gt; The formal secession of Tertullian from the Church of Carthage seems to have
&gt; taken place either in 211 or at the end of 212 at latest. The earlier date

&gt; followed the &quot;De corona&quot;. It is certain that &quot;De fuga in persecutione&quot; was
&gt; written after the secession. It condemns flight in time of persecution, for
&gt; God's providence has intended the suffering. This intolerable doctrine had

&gt;&gt; THE CHOOSING OF THE SEVENTY HOLY APOSTLES
&gt;&gt; As recounted by Dorotheus, Bishop of Tyre, an ancient and pious man, who
&gt;&gt; became a martyr in the reign of the emperors Licinius and Constantine.
&gt;&gt; This above-mentioned and exemplary man left us various writings in Greek
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; Latin, for he was proficient in both languages and possessed of great
&gt;&gt; intelligence. After the death of Diocletian and Licinius, he returned
&gt;&gt; home
&gt;&gt; and ruled the church of Tyre until Julian the torturer came to power; for
&gt;&gt; Julian did not kill Christians openly, but secretly through his princes.
&gt;&gt; Dorotheus came once more to the city of Odessus polis, where he was
&gt;&gt; seized
&gt;&gt; by Julian's princes and suffered many tortures in his very old age for
&gt;&gt; confessing Christ, and died as a martyr at the age of one hundred and
&gt;&gt; seventy. This saintly Dorotheus speaks of the seventy apostles and
&gt; disciples
&gt;&gt; of Christ, many of whom were bishops among different peoples, while
&gt;&gt; others
&gt;&gt; served as preachers, whom the divine Paul mentions in tile salutations in
&gt;&gt; his epistles. Many years after the resurrection of our Lord and Saviour
&gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, he found all of them and recorded them, their names being
&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt; follows:

&gt; Or if you prefer, from the catholic encylopedia -

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorotheus_of_Tyre
Saint Dorotheus bishop of Tyre (ca. 255 - 362) is traditionally credited
with an Acts of the Seventy Apostles (which may be the same work as the lost
Gospel of the Seventy), who were sent out according to the Gospel of Luke
10:1.

Dorotheus, a learned priest of Antioch, the teacher of the Church historian
Eusebius of Caesarea, was appointed director without having to renounce his
religion (Eusebius,VII.32). Dorotheus is said to have been driven into exile
during the persecution of Diocletian, but later returned. He attended the
Council of Nicaea in 325, but was exiled to Odyssopolis (Varna) on the Black
Sea in Thrace by Julian the Apostate. There the 107 year old priest was
martyred for his faith. His feast day is observed June 5 according to the
Gregorian calendar which consists with June 18 on the Julian calendar.

&gt; THE FOURTH DAY OF THE MONTH OF JANUARY

&gt; The Synaxis of the Holy Seventy Apostles

&gt; From The Great Collection of the Lives of the Saints, Volume 5: January,
&gt; compiled by St. Demetrius of Rostov

&gt; After choosing the Twelve, Christ the Lord selected seventy lesser apostles
&gt; and sent them out to preach, as the holy Evangelist Luke writes: After these
&gt; things the Lord appointed other seventy also; and sent them two and two
&gt; before His face. The Twelve generally remained at Christ's side, serving as
&gt; witnesses to His life; but the Seventy preceded Him in every place He
&gt; visited. We do not know the names of all the original Seventy, for, as Saint
&gt; John the Evangelist tells us, the time came when many of His disciples went
&gt; back, and walked no more with Him. Then said Jesus unto the Twelve, Will ye
&gt; also go away? As the Lord's Passion approached, the number of His disciples
&gt; decreased further: hardly any of the Seventy remained, and one of the Twelve
&gt; betrayed Him. After the Resurrection Matthias was numbered with the Twelve,
&gt; while the ranks of the Seventy were gradually filled with men newly
&gt; converted to piety by the Twelve Apostles and Saint Paul, who was called by
&gt; heaven to preside (with Saint Peter) over the apostolic choir.

&gt; At the beginning of the printed version of the Book of Acts and in The
&gt; Prologue, the Seventy Apostles are identified in a listing ascribed to the
&gt; holy hieromartyr Dorotheus, Bishop of Tyre. However, some of the men
&gt; mentioned in the roll, while apostles at first, later fell from the faith
&gt; and the dignity of their office. Such were Nicholas, the proselyte of
&gt; Antioch (one of the seven deacons, who apostatized with Simon Magus);
&gt; Phygellus; Hermogenes; and Demus, about whom Saint Paul writes to Timothy:
&gt; This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me;
&gt; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes; and, Demus hath forsaken me, having
&gt; loved this present world. Later, Demus became a heathen priest in
&gt; Thessalonica. Of these men Saint John the Theologian wrote in his First
&gt; General Epistle, They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they
&gt; had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us. They proved
&gt; themselves unworthy to be included among the saints whose synaxis we
&gt; celebrate today, for what communion hath light with darkness? Furthermore,
&gt; the Holy Church includes in the calendar of saints and reveres as apostles
&gt; of the Seventy a number of holy men (such as Timothy, Titus, Epaphras,
&gt; Archippus, Aquila, Olympas, Quadratus, and Achaicus) missing from the list
&gt; preserved under Dorotheus' name. Because of these and other deficiencies and
&gt; uncertainties in the enumeration ascribed to Saint Dorotheus, we have
&gt; carefully investigated the divine Scriptures, the traditions handed down by
&gt; the Fathers, and the accounts of trustworthy ecclesiastical historians and
&gt; chroniclers and compiled the following roster of holy apostles commemorated
&gt; on this day:

&gt; I. Saint James, Brother of the Lord (Commemorated October 23)

&gt; The holy Apostle Paul refers to James in the Epistle to the Galatians,
&gt; saying, I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, but other of the apostles saw I
&gt; none, save James the Lord's brother. Saint James was appointed Bishop of
&gt; Jerusalem by the Lord Himself. The Jews hurled him from the pinnacle of the
&gt; Temple for preaching Christ. He was injured, but not killed, when he struck
&gt; the pavement below, so one of the Pharisees shattered his skull with a club,
&gt; finishing him.

&gt; II. Saint Mark the Evangelist (April 25)

&gt; Mark wrote his Gospel under the direction of Saint Peter and is mentioned by
&gt; that Apostle in his First General Epistle. Peter writes, The church that is
&gt; at Babylon saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son. Peter ordained Mark Bishop
&gt; of Alexandria. The idolaters of that city bound him, dragged him over jagged
&gt; rocks, and beat him; whereupon, the Lord appeared, summoned him to heavenly
&gt; glory, and received his spirit.

&gt; III. Saint Luke the Evangelist (October 18)

&gt; Luke wrote his Gospel under the guidance of the holy Apostle Paul, who
&gt; mentions him in the Epistle to the Colossians, saying, Luke, the beloved
&gt; physician, and Demas, greet you. Saint Luke also wrote the Acts of the
&gt; Apostles. After toiling greatly in Christ's service, Luke completed his
&gt; labors in Thebes, a city of Boetia, where he was martyred.

&gt; IV. Saint Cleopas, Younger Brother of Joseph the Betrothed (October 30)

&gt; In his Gospel, Saint Luke writes that Cleopas was one of the two disciples
&gt; to whom the Lord appeared on the road to Emmaus after His Resurrection. Luke
&gt; was the other, although he does not mention his own name. Cleopas was
&gt; subsequently slain by the Jews for preaching Christ, the murder taking place
&gt; in the very house where the risen Lord was known by him in the breaking of
&gt; bread.

&gt; V. Saint Symeon, Kinsman of the Lord (September 17 and April 27)

&gt; Saint Symeon was the second Bishop of Jerusalem, James' successor. He was
&gt; crucified for the crucified Christ.

&gt; VI. Saint Barnabas, Also Known as Joses (June 11)

&gt; According to the fourth chapter of the Book of Acts, this saint was surnamed
&gt; Barnabas by the apostles. He is also mentioned in the second chapter of the
&gt; Epistle to the Galatians, wherein Saint Paul writes, I went up to Jerusalem
&gt; with Barnabas. Laboring in the ministry of the word, he was first (with
&gt; Saint Paul) to preach Christ in Rome. He became Bishop of Milan and met his
&gt; end on Cyprus, his homeland, being stoned by Greeks and Jews. Saint Barnabas
&gt; was buried with a copy of Saint Matthew's Gospel which he had written with
&gt; his own hand.

&gt; VII. Saint Joses or Joseph, Also Called Barsabas and Justus (October 30)

&gt; Joses was one of the two candidates chosen as possible replacements for the
&gt; fallen Judas (the other was Matthias). Saint Paul refers to him in the
&gt; Epistle to the Colossians as Jesus, which is called Justus. The teachers of
&gt; the Church say that Joses was a son of Joseph the Betrothed, like James,
&gt; Simon, and Judas (not Iscariot). He became Bishop of Eleutheropolis and died
&gt; a martyr.

&gt; VIII. Saint Thaddaeus (August 21)

&gt; Thaddaeus was first a disciple of Saint John the Forerunner, then of Christ.
&gt; He is not to be confused with the holy Apostle Jude or Judas Thaddaeus, also
&gt; known as Lebbaeus. Thaddaeus baptized Abgar, Prince of Edessa, and cleansed
&gt; him of leprosy. After laboring much in proclaiming the gospel of Christ, he
&gt; reposed in the Lord in the Phoenician city of Beirut.

&gt; IX. Saint Ananias (October 1)

&gt; The holy Ananias baptized Saint Paul and was Bishop of Damascus. Lucian,
&gt; Governor of Eleutheropolis, had him put to death by stoning outside that
&gt; city.

&gt; X. Saint Stephen, Protomartyr and Archdeacon (December 27)

&gt; Saint Stephen was stoned by the Jews for preaching the Lord Jesus Christ,
&gt; Whom he beheld standing in the heavens.

&gt; XI. Saint Philip, One of the Seven Deacons (October 11)

&gt; Philip baptized Simon Magus (in Samaria) and Candace's eunuch. He became
&gt; Bishop of Tralles in Asia Minor, enlightened many in the faith, and departed
&gt; unto eternal life in great old age.

&gt; XII. Saint Prochorus, One of the Seven Deacons (July 28)

&gt; Prochorus was Saint John the Theologian's companion and fellow-laborer. He
&gt; became the first Bishop of Nicomedia in Bithynia and suffered martyrdom
&gt; while preaching Christ in Antioch.

&gt; XIII. Saint Nicanor, One of the Seven Deacons (December 27 and July 28)

&gt; Saint Nicanor, with two thousand other Christians, was slain for Christ on
&gt; the same day as the holy protomartyr Stephen, as related in the Acts of the
&gt; Apostles, which states, At that time there was a great persecution against
&gt; the church which was at Jerusalem.

&gt; XIV. Saint Timon, One of the Seven Deacons (July 28 and December 30)

&gt; Timon was Bishop of Bostra in Arabia. He suffered greatly at the hands of
&gt; the Jews for preaching Christ. Cast into a fiery furnace, he emerged
&gt; unharmed, then departed unto the Lord.

&gt; XV. Saint Parmenas, One of the Seven Deacons (July 28)

&gt; Parmenas was slain before the eyes of the other apostles while preaching the
&gt; gospel.

&gt; XVI. Saint Timothy (January 22)

&gt; Timothy, the Bishop of Ephesus, helped Saint Paul spread the gospel and
&gt; received letters from him.

&gt; XVII. Saint Titus (August 25)

&gt; Titus, the Bishop of Gortyna in Crete, also labored with Saint Paul in
&gt; proclaiming the gospel and received a letter from him.

&gt; XVIII. Saint Philemon (November 22)

&gt; Philemon, the recipient of one of Saint Paul's letters, was Bishop of Gaza.

&gt; XIX. Saint Onesimus (February 15)

&gt; The holy Onesimus, mentioned by Paul in his epistle to Philemon, was
&gt; tortured by Tertillus, Prefect of Rome, and died in Puteoli.

&gt; XX. Saint Epaphras

&gt; Epaphras is also mentioned by Saint Paul in the Epistle to Philemon. Paul
&gt; states, &quot;Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee.&quot;
&gt; Epaphras was Bishop of Colossae and also of the churches of Laodicea and
&gt; Hierapolis. He shared Paul's captivity in Rome, whence the great Apostle
&gt; wrote the Colossians, Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ,
&gt; saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may
&gt; stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. For I bear him record,
&gt; that he hath a great zeal of you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in
&gt; Hierapolis.

&gt; XXI. Saint Archippus (November 22 and February 19)

&gt; Archippus, like Onesimus and Epaphras, is mentioned in the Epistle to
&gt; Philemon. While Saint Epaphras was being held at Rome in fetters, Archippus
&gt; succeeded him as Bishop of Colossae. Archippus was tending the flock of
&gt; Christ in that city when Saint Paul wrote him this reminder: Take heed to
&gt; the ministry which thou hast

Saint Dismas (sometimes spelled Dysmas or only Dimas, or even Dumas), also
known as the Good Thief or the Penitent Thief, is the apocryphal name given
to one of the thieves who was crucified alongside Christ according to the
Gospel of Luke 23:39-43:

And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, &quot;If
thou be Christ, save thyself and us.&quot;
But the other answering rebuked him, saying, &quot;Dost not thou fear God,
seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we
receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.&quot;
And he said unto Jesus, &quot;Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy
kingdom.&quot;
And Jesus said unto him, &quot;Verily I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with
me in paradise.&quot; (KJV)
The name of &quot;Dismas&quot; for this person, unnamed in the canonical Gospel
itself, appears first in the twelfth century in the Gospel of Nicodemus. The
name of &quot;Dismas&quot; was adapted from a Greek word meaning &quot;sunset&quot; or &quot;death.&quot;
The other thief's name is given as Gestas. The apocryphal Arabic Infancy
Gospel calls the two thieves Titus and Dumachus, and adds a tale about how
Titus (Dismas) prevented other thieves in his company from robbing Mary and
Joseph on their flight into Egypt. In medieval art, St Dismas is often
depicted as accompanying Jesus in the Harrowing of Hell as related in the
Apostles' Creed.

The town of San Dimas, California is named after him.

&gt;&gt; Gospel of the Seventy), who were sent out according to the Gospel of Luke
&gt;&gt; 10:1.
