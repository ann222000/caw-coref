Reading all this crap about aliens, I thought I would add my 2 cents.  The
only aliens we have are human aliens coming across our borders.  Anything
else is a joke.

Maybe all this UFO / Alien crap is just a race of humans that evolved years
before we did? Hell, I don't think I even need to make this a question
mark~! IMHO it's all a human thing.

What say you?

Do you possibly know just how big the universe is?
We can see galaxies from billions and billions of light years away.
In all those stars, with certainly many more planets,
can you imagine that only Earth has life?

I mean, why would God build a house without an occupant?

And of those that have life, don't you imagine some of those civilizations
are much older and advanced than ours, and are already visiting us on Earth?

The odds of there NOT being relatively intelligent life on another planet
somewhere in the universe is so small that our government spends millions
of dollars every year in vane attempts to prove it. The odds that we will
ever see any evidence of the same in our lifetimes, however, are also very
unlikely. So...  yes there are &quot;probably&quot; aliens, but no, we will probably
not ever observe one on our planet.

No we can't. We can only see what galaxies appeared to be like

You of course, as usual, would be wrong. Aliens exist. We ourselves
are aliens traveling to other planets. If a person does not assume
that this universe constantly generates life forms and that those
forms attain to intelligence, that person is too narrow minded to deal
with. Which is why I do not deal with you.

Aliens exist. They frequently visit and our technology isn't good
enough to investigate them.

Hope this was short enough fro your degenerated attention span. LOL!

Your claim is false, you do not understand the terminology involved, specifically,
the term &quot;relatively intelligent&quot;. On a better day, were i convinced that it would
be helpful in any manner, i would explain it to you. But knowing that you haven't
the ability to learn anything, offering such help would only meet contempt and be
a complete waste of time.

If we haven't the ability to observe, then your usage of the word &quot;exist&quot;
is incorrect. At best, aliens &quot;probably&quot; exist. But by the same token,
at best, we will never observe any in and/or around our planet. A UFO
is not evidence of alien life, it is only an unidentified flying object.

I have doubts about what mark said (no offence Mark) but I will say what I
always say when this topic comes up. Isn't believing human beings are the
only intelligent life in this vast universe (lets not forget all the other
parallel universes as well) a bit arrogant? Why would God create such a huge
universe just for one species who will probably wipe its self out because of
greed or hatred?
If humans are the most intelligent life out there that's sad.
I guess I'm saying aliens might not have made contact with us (or they
might. How would we know?) but there is life out there among the stars.

We see galaxies from many billions of light years away.
We see all the way to the Big Bang.
We see it in our minds' eye, because we know that what
we see is not the limit of the universe.

In other words, your usage of the word &quot;see&quot; is only of
your imagination and therefore not true, demonstrable,
provable, nor real.

We cannot see galaxies from billions and billions of light years away.

We can IMAGINE them only. I can only imagine Andromeda 2.5 light-years
away. I cannot see it in its present state or form even with the aid
of a telescope. I can only with the aid of a telescope be able to
see what it was like 2.5 million years ago. Since it takes 2.5 million
years for light to travel to earth from Andromeda, then the only light
i can see will have been emitted from that galaxy 2.5 million years
ago. It is also impossible that light from Andromeda after 2.5 million
years will be of the same quality that it was when first organized. In
other words, there will doubtless be distortion in both spectrum range,
spectrum quality, and time of delivery due to changes in temperature
along the course of travel of the light over 2.5 million years. That is
what makes stars &quot;twinkle&quot;. In effect, it is possible for some of the
light from Andromeda to arrive to my telescope aided eye with some
time lag and therefore the resulting composite picture that my eye can
reveal to my mind could very well be composed of several moments in
time overlapped one onto the next. The actual position of any object
emitting or reflecting light 2.5 million years ago from Andromeda would
not be able to be determined exactly due to that blur.

The naked human eye, without the aid of a telescope, can at best see
light that has traveled around 3 million years to our planet.

And to top it all off, the total observable universe is only around
45 billion light years in radius. 45 is VERY MUCH SMALLER than a
billion, so even with telescopes, we cannot see galaxies that are
&quot;billions and billions&quot; of light years away. Try 45 billion, and
you are getting closer to the limit.

So again, we cannot see galaxies from billions and billions of light
years away.

You are wrong, but i doubt you will ever admit it, even to yourself.
And because of that, you will never be able to learn.

But through the telescopes we see the spirit of the Cosmos.
And when we into the spirit of things, seeing is believing.

I can see into heaven and see God right now.
I am not imagining it.  I literally see him.
In the same way I can see the whole and entire universe.
It is only 8 light years from one side to the other.
That is because light travels much, much faster than
we think it does.  Only the exterior of light travels at
186,000 miles per second.  Light's interior travels very much faster
than its exterior, in much the same way as does a comet.

&gt; We cannot see galaxies from billions and billions of light years away.

&gt; We can IMAGINE them only. I can only imagine Andromeda 2.5 light-years
&gt; away. I cannot see it in its present state or form even with the aid
&gt; of a telescope. I can only with the aid of a telescope be able to
&gt; see what it was like 2.5 million years ago. Since it takes 2.5 million
&gt; years for light to travel to earth from Andromeda, then the only light
&gt; i can see will have been emitted from that galaxy 2.5 million years
&gt; ago. It is also impossible that light from Andromeda after 2.5 million
&gt; years will be of the same quality that it was when first organized. In
&gt; other words, there will doubtless be distortion in both spectrum range,
&gt; spectrum quality, and time of delivery due to changes in temperature
&gt; along the course of travel of the light over 2.5 million years. That is
&gt; what makes stars &quot;twinkle&quot;. In effect, it is possible for some of the
&gt; light from Andromeda to arrive to my telescope aided eye with some
&gt; time lag and therefore the resulting composite picture that my eye can
&gt; reveal to my mind could very well be composed of several moments in
&gt; time overlapped one onto the next. The actual position of any object
&gt; emitting or reflecting light 2.5 million years ago from Andromeda would
&gt; not be able to be determined exactly due to that blur.

&gt; The naked human eye, without the aid of a telescope, can at best see
&gt; light that has traveled around 3 million years to our planet.

&gt; And to top it all off, the total observable universe is only around
&gt; 45 billion light years in radius. 45 is VERY MUCH SMALLER than a
&gt; billion, so even with telescopes,

If what you are looking at is only 8 light years from one side to
the other, then it is not the &quot;whole and entire universe&quot;. Our
galaxy, the Milky Way, is around 100,000 light years across, therefore,
whatever you THINK is the entire universe is smaller than our own
galaxy. And that only goes to prove EVEN MORE SO that even YOU
cannot see galaxies &quot;billions and billions&quot; of light years away.
Your statements are contradictory to each other. According to the
composite of your statements, the &quot;whole and entire universe&quot; is
smaller than galaxies that are &quot;billions and billions&quot; of light
years away that are inside of it. The two statements are contradictory.
You are wrong.

Wrong. You haven't the capability to speak on behalf of others in
this matter. You haven't even the capability to agree with others

A light-year has only one meaning. You are wrong.
Billion has only one meaning. Again, you are wrong.
Galaxy has only one meaning. (* yawn *) so you are wrong.
And you are only changing the subject now and trying (again)
to say that i am somehow deficient in my capabilities rather
than the truth: that you are wrong.

You said: Galaxies are billions and billions of light years away.
You said: We can see galaxies that are billions and billions of light years away.
You are wrong on both counts.

You said: The whole and entire universe is 8 light years from one side to the other.
You are wrong.

BUT NOW, READ THIS VERY CAREFULLY:

8 is always less than a billion.
billions is always more than a billion.
Thus: 8 is always less than billions.

&quot;The whole and entire universe&quot; has only one meaning. There isn't any other
connotation or definition to it; period.

Therefore:

The &quot;whole and entire universe&quot; MUST BE GREATER than billions and billions of
light years IF (and this is YOUR premise, not mine) galaxies are billions and
billions of light years away.  And you said it was only 8 light years away.

...or on the other hand, if what you might consider amazing isn't really
that amazing after all. It's just a big pile of bricks, ya know. Also,
one might say that because it only deviates from pointing to due north
by a fraction of an amount, that this is an amazing feat. But in that
regard, the larger the structure, and longer the measuring rod one works
with, the easier it is to align rather than the reverse. Had they been
able to align a single stone the size of your hand to due north and had
it been set aside undisturbed for a few thousand years, then THAT would
have been amazing. Also, one should consider they had quite a large work
force involved. It would have been truly amazing had only one guy done
the whole thing on his own. That is how important they felt their Pharoah

not necessarily, but according to your usage, yes. The difference is
because you are referencing the quality of our observation. You didn't
say &quot;exist in actuality&quot;, and you implied only &quot;exist in reality&quot;,
the latter of which is based on the quality of our observations which
you negated in the second sentence.

Probable existence implies actual existence and not real existence.
The difference is that something may actually exist but not really
exist. Real existence occurs once something is observable.

A quick example are the stars. We know that they really existed, but
only in the past. They may at this current moment in time not actually
exist. Therefore, although the stars PROBABLY exist right now, it is
POSSIBLE that they do not. The answer can only be known in another 2.5
million years (here). In the meantime, the illusion exists such that
stars really exist and are actually there as well.

You are contradicting yourself. If investigation is beyond our technology
then observation could only determine them to be unknown rather than
known (alien craft). Therefore, the best we can say is that we observe
unidentifiable flying objects. And that means that we haven't got a clue
if they have any sort of intelligence whatsoever, but most especially
even if they fly in unusual patterns, faster than we can predict, or both.
Neither of those two traits indicate anything in regards to intelligent
behavior. On the contrary, we already know that there are several types
of odd behavior specific to metals and magnetism that in previous
generations we hadn't any knowledge of whatsoever. Jumping to a conclusion
that erratic flight pattern indicates intelligence is a leap that most
people in their right mind would just laugh at.

In other words... Just because you CAN'T explain it, doesn't mean that
you CAN.

I said aliens probably exist. That means they are probably actual. The
odds are in favor of it. Get it?  They do not, on the other hand, REALLY
exist, and the odds are against them ever really existing. Get it?

The reason the odds are against such a thing is because of the size of
the observable universe. The reason the odds are in favor of actual
existence though, is because here on this planet we have all sorts of
life. So the big question is, and tons of money are poured into trying to
reduce the odds of the former such that we might discover life somewhere
else. And i mean even a basic cell, virus, or anything beyond the level
of life of a simple salt. That in itself would reduce the odds of real
existence never occurring quite a bit. It DOES NOT MATTER if they only
actually exist, it only matters if they really exist. In the latter
case we have the option of doing something about it.

Consider ultra-violet radiation for a moment. We know NOW that it really
exists. There was a time when it only actually existed. Being bombarded by
it really didn't affect us much then, nor does it affect us much now.
But now we have the option of doing something about it, with it, and
learn from it.

I caught that. What does it matter their point of origin, though, if neither
an alien from &lt;----here or an alien from there---&gt; can't be engaged in any
useful or communicative fashion?  Being &quot;beyond our technology&quot;, we cannot
prove they really exist. Small super conducting meteors that enter our outer
atmosphere could have various magnetic/atomic properties that send them
whizzing around in all sorts of directions at high speeds. Would those be
intelligent rocks? Or would those be stupid aliens? If we can't study it,
then what's the difference?

The work force was around 30,000. Many of these were not full time
employees though. At the time of building the great pyramid Egypt was
a divided country, but united by a single belief. The great pyramid
brought the various tribes together into a nation in many respects. A
lot of the pulling power was provided by farmers who had to wait
between harvesting and the next Nile flood. They were overseen by
trained and skilled masons. Prepared blocks were dragged up gently
sloping sand ramps, and then aligned into the right place.

As for being primitive, who can judge what is primitive or not? They
could brew beer, and cater for a huge number, there was also medical
care for injured workers (the pyramids were NOT built by slaves).
Technology is only relative to its time, man went to the moon with (I
think) 28k of RAM.

yep, that's the one i had in mind.

it's messed up. The whole thing was done in copy-cat style of
Frank Lloyd Wright, including a light on top shooting up into
the sky. Just my opinion, of course, but the architect didn't
add anything original since the basic shape was, uhm, a pretty
old design as well. It's kind of a sore spot architecturally
since Frank Lloyd Wright tried to be unique in each building.
It's like a double insult to 1) put all of a various number
of unique things from unique buildings into a single collage,
and 2) defeat the whole purpose of Frank's designs. Had the
guy copied some other copycat, then at least that would have
been a compliment i suppose. As it stands, it reminds me of
a building one would find in DisneyWorld: phony.

Phony and me don't get along well. Plastic crap is crap wasted, imho.
It's the sort of thing that puts the impression into kid's minds that
doctors are infallible and can cure any/all diseases, food isn't dirty

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OK the archaeologists don't agree on some of the finer details, but

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So how could a group of so called primitives build something so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amazing? Unless they werent as primative as we'd like to believe.

&gt;&gt;&gt; ...or on the other hand, if what you might consider amazing isn't really
&gt;&gt;&gt; that amazing after all. It's just a big pile of bricks, ya know. Also,
&gt;&gt;&gt; one might say that because it only deviates from pointing to due north
&gt;&gt;&gt; by a fraction of an amount, that this is an amazing feat. But in that
&gt;&gt;&gt; regard, the larger the structure, and longer the measuring rod one works
&gt;&gt;&gt; with, the easier it is to align rather than the reverse. Had they been
&gt;&gt;&gt; able to align a single stone the size of your hand to due north and had
&gt;&gt;&gt; it been set aside undisturbed for a few thousand years, then THAT would
&gt;&gt;&gt; have been amazing. Also, one should consider they had quite a large work
&gt;&gt;&gt; force involved. It would have been truly amazing had only one guy done
&gt;&gt;&gt; the whole thing on his own. That is how important they felt their
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pharoah
&gt;&gt;&gt; was; i.e. that he could build such a thing and get all the credit.

&gt;&gt; It would have to be a pretty huge work force. The pyramids and ancient
&gt;&gt; egypt have always facinated me.

&gt; Well, consider how long it would take America to do the same project...
&gt; ...uhm, no forget that... we'd have to have air-conditioning, build it
&gt; stronger but lighter, use the cheapest materials and the lowest bid
&gt; contractor,...

&gt; they didn't have any of those problems.

America would probally get the ilegal imigrants to do it. That would be just
punishment.

nah, it would be the opposite in reality. Only union wages paid to union
labor. The only &quot;just&quot; thing for an illegal alien is for him to return
to his own country and change it for the better rather than trying to
usurp ours as his own and change it for the worse.
