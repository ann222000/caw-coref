Having trouble finding a printer who can handle really long charts? We
are The Printer You Need for your Long Family Trees.

Our colour inkjet printer can produce full colour charts - including
photos if you wish - up to 45 metres long on 420 mm (A3 long side)
wide
100 gsm continuous banner roll (no sprocket holes). The printer can
also handle cut sheets up to A2 size.

We can print charts for you from TreeDraw, Family Tree Maker, The
Master Genealogist, Genbox and other popular packages - and it could
cost as little as Ten Pounds.

All charts can be produced in portrait or landscape orientation.

And it's true! You don't need to have your data on computer to have a
printed chart prepared for you! If you send us a copy of your manual
data (typed or hand-written, it doesn't matter which) we can input it
into the computer and produce a printed chart for you.

We will also create a special personal web page for you so you can see
how the chart will look before you buy.

Payment can be by Sterling cheque/postal order or PayPal - whichever
is most convenient for you.

All the details are on our searchable web site at
http://www.jigrah.co.uk .

Regards,
Graham.
