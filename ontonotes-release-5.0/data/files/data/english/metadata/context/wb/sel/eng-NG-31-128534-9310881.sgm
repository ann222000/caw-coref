I create a domain using google apps and have several administrators
created then.

When I want to change admin users to ordinary users by unchecking the
&quot;Previlege box&quot; in &quot;user account&quot; control panel. I have the following
two problems.

1. After I changed one admin user like &quot;bob&quot; to ordinary user, this
user &quot;bob&quot; still have &quot;manage this domain&quot; link in the right top page
when logging into the domain.

2. Before I changed one admin user like &quot;bob&quot; to ordinary user, I have
several other users calendar showed in &quot;bob&quot;'s my calendar without
other user's permission, because &quot;bob&quot; have the admin previlege to
view all the calendars in domain.
But after I changed &quot;bob&quot;'s admin previlege, those user calendars are
still in &quot;bob&quot;'s my calendar entry, though &quot;bob&quot; no longer have the
previlege to see these user calendars.

I don't know that whether I have explained these problems clearly
using my poor english.
Can someone please help me with these problems?
Thank you in advance.

well, it seems it is not problem on the first one.
Because the &quot;manage this domain&quot; link disappeared after some time.

But on the second problem, I still have other users calendars on
&quot;bob&quot;'s calendar entry with no right to delete or modify them.

Please help me out.
