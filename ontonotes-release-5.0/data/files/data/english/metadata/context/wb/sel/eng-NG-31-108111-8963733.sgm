Vey,
I saw this item on the crawl on CNN last night.  I had not heard all
of the details, but as you said the subject just about covers the story.
It is so sad to me that we have billions to spend on war, but we do
not have money to feed starving people.
Actually, I am kind of selfish like that.  I would like the US to
spend our money on the US, but if we are going to rehabilitate the
Middle East, let's feed the people that are starving.

Apparently you're about as knowledgeable about Zimbabwe as you are
about Che Guevara, eh?

Have you ever heard of a guy by the name of Robert Mugabe?  No?  I'm
surprised that you don't have a t-shirt with his likeness on it, too,
since you love murderous Marxist thugs so much. Mugabe runs Zimbabwe,
and guess what?  Yep, he's a murderous Marxist thug, just like your
old buddy Che.

http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=8020

Yes, Mugabe is a murderous Marxist thug.  He ran off (by confiscating
their farms and ranches, and by murder) all the farmers and ranchers
who once made Zimbabwe the &quot;breadbasket of Africa.&quot;  Zimbabwe was
recently an *exporter* of food, darlin'.

Zimbabwe doesn't need food. It needs SOLDIERS!

Preferably UN soldiers, to depose Mugabe.

Otherwise those Zimbabweans not supportive of Mugabe will continue to
look for &quot;creative&quot; ways to find food to eat.

Tip: Don't hold your breath waiting for that to happen. The world just
loves to look the other way when tyrants and thugs are murdering and
starving their own people. Yeah, that includes you, Judy. So spare us
your concern for the Zimbabwean people.

Zimbabwe isn't part of the Middle East.  The crisis there is wholly of
Mugabe's making.  At any rate, we've sent 700,000 MT of food in the last
five years, over 140,000 MT this year alone, enough to feed many people.
(1)

The life expectancy for women in Zim has fallen from 65 to 34, the lowest in
the world, during Mugabe's reign. (2)

Please enlighten me.  Why should we continue to feed those starving people
when the crisis is entirely Mugabe's fault?  Wouldn't it make more sense to
oust Mugabe and help the Zims rebuild?

If your honest answer to the second question is yes, why would it be okay
for us to intervene in Zimbabwe and it wasn't okay to intervene in Iraq to
rid them of a similar murderous thug?

Flick,
I freely admit I am not as &quot;up&quot; on the numbers as you are when it
comes to how much food the US has supplied to Zimbabwe in the way of
food.  Obviously, it is not enough.  I also was surprised at the average
life span for women in Zimbabwe today.  I did not know they reached the
age of 34 on average.
So, because of Mugabwe's regime we can't spare enough food to feed
everyone there.  I really don't understand.  Mugabwe is an evil
dictator, so we let the Zimbabwe people die?
I am not above sending a few folks from the CIA to off the evil
dictator or how ever it is done these days (by the U.S.) covertly.
Hey, didn't we already off the guy that was the evil dictator in Iraq?
You know the one with the WMD that no one could find?  Ok, he's dead,
let's bring our troops home, end the &quot;war&quot; and we could afford to feed
the whole damn world.
I think I have a clue Zimbabwe doesn't have a damn thing that we want.
I think I have to agree with Alan Greenspan when he said &quot;this war is
over oil&quot;.  Oh, he's not the only one that has said it.
You have got your facts together on this Zimbabwe horror story.
Please break it down for me into dollars.  How much cash have we spent
on all that food we gave them?  It is a crime to let anyone starve to
death IMO.

Ok the grand total we have spent over all in Zimbabwe for food is 400
million.  We haven't lost any U.S. citizens lives over there.
If we really believed Hussein was a threat to the U.S. or even his
countrymen and he just had to be done away, with and we were the only
living souls capable of  killing him.  Great, we have accomplished that.
Do we really need to set up housekeeping over there?  Did all of the
United States service men and women have to die over there?
Who appointed us the caretaker of the world?  What about the U.N.?
This war is an atrocity.

Mugabe decided to seize many of the privately-owned farms in the country and
give the land to his friends.  Problem was, the friends didn't know how to
farm and/or weren't interested.

&quot; The 4,300 farms seized illegally by President Mugabe since 2000 have
followed the same pattern overwhelmingly, and turned one of the most robust
and enterprising agricultural industries into a model of neglect.&quot;

&quot;More than a million people living on commercial farms suffered incidents
of assault, torture, being held hostage, illegal detention and death
threats, it estimates. More than 10,000 farm workers are believed to have
died after their removal and the consequent loss of employment, housing,
nutrition and access to health-care on the farms.&quot;

&quot;Zimbabwe's maize production fell 74% between 1999 and 2004.  The national
cattle herd shrank by 90% and production of flue-cured tobacco fell from
237m kg (233,200 tons) to 70m kg .&quot; (1)

Zimbabwe is suffering from a manmade famine.  Just like Cuba, whose people
have been rationed since about 1962.  Funny how communism works, isn't it?
Seize everybody's property, everything belongs to the State, and production
goes all to hell no matter how many people you kill and threaten.

Are we supposed to rescue the whole world?  Or just the countries that we
aren't rescuing at this time?  I think this is a topic that the Left likes
to complain about.  We're never doing the right thing.  We deposed a brutal
dictator (Saddam) and are helping the people rebuild.  But, oh, it's WORSE
in another country, should've gone there, shame on the U.S.! &lt;whine&gt;

I know, it's been a mantra of the Left.

I, for one, don't much care if this war IS about oil.  The alternative is,
do without oil, and all that it brings you.  Don't buy anything that got
shipped to your local store.  Turn off the power and live without lights and
refrigeration.  Don't drive or take the bus.  Eat what you can gather from
public lands or cultivate in your backyard with a sharpened stick, or barter
for food that's locally grown.

It's all about the oil, after all.

The reason that the extreme right is vexed over Zimbabwe and
not the Congo or any of the other atrocity loci is simple:
Mugabe took land and farms away from white Africans and gave
them to black Africans, and there are black Africans
committing atrocities against white Africans.  It's the only
country in Africa where this is the case, as far as I know,
and it's consequently the only country in Africa right-wing

&lt;snipped a bunch of lies&gt;

I was upset when Mugabe began his land redistribution scheme because farms
were given to people who don't know how to farm and/or weren't at all
interested in farming the land they were given.  That's the reason for the
food shortage in Zimbabwe today.  The land is unproductive compared to what
it was.

No one is better off under this system except the relatively few favored
people who were given land.  Since it isn't being worked, the former
employees aren't any better off under their new black masters; many of the
workers were driven off, there's little work for them now, and they've
starved to death.

Mugabe didn't divide up the big farms and give them to the workers.  He gave
them whole to his nonfarming pals as favors.  As far as the employees, all
other things being equal the ethnicity of their boss probably wouldn't have
mattered much in the scheme of things.

So sorry to bust your bubble, stupid c*nt, but calling me a racist by
putting words in my mouth doesn't make me one.

Mugabe is the racist here.  Sounds like he's probably one of your heroes,
too.

&quot;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Clarifying a controversial comment in his new
memoir, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said he told
the White House before the Iraq war that removing Saddam Hussein was
&quot;essential&quot; to secure world oil supplies, according to an interview
published on Monday...

&quot;I was not saying that that's the administration's motive,&quot; Greenspan

somebody asked me, 'Are we fortunate in taking out Saddam?' I would
say it was essential.&quot;

And, as Flick already noted, try living without oil today.

There's really not much you can do about it, Flick, except to respond
in kind.

Calling people racists, bigots, homophobes, anti-Semites, etc. has
become a conditioned reflex for people like Mel.

If you even dare to disagree with Mel on the issues, any issue(!),
you'll immediately be branded a racist, a bigot, a homophobe, etc.

Not in person, of course, because they're cowards.

But from afar.

Sounds like genocide to me.

Tens of thousands of farm workers and their families (mostly black Africans,
btw), out of work since the property seizures, have died already.  Sounds
like genocide to me.

Between 500,000 and a million people - and possibly up to 1/10 of the
population - have been deprived of their homes and livelihood as part of
Mugabe's &quot;operation restore order&quot; and left to starve in the open.  Sounds
like genocide to me.

There are also Mugabe's militia groups, who per his orders go house-to-house
to shoot, imprison and torture people who voted for his opponents.  Sounds
like genocide to me.

Nope, no genocide here, move along &lt;sarc&gt;.

It would, if you get your information from the right-wing
echo machine.  &quot;Genocide&quot; doesn't mean letting a bunch of
your citizens go hungry.  &quot;Genocide&quot; doesn't mean locking up
a bunch of political prisoners, and it doesn't even mean

deliberate murder of an entire population because of ethnic,
racial, or religious hatred.

As I said, what's unique about what's going on in Zimbabwe,
as opposed to Congo and the recent miseries in Sierra Leone
and Liberia (or the current ongoing disaster that is Haiti,
which is a lot, lot closer) is that whites are being thrown
off their land.

Seizing the farms and making them unproductive was deliberate.  Harassing,

Evicting hundreds of thousands of people from their homes and bulldozing

&quot;Mugabe became a Marxist while studying in Ghana during the era of President
Kwame Nkrumah, the grand old man of African nationalism. Mugabe's Marxism
was an ideology that hardened during his 10-year prison term in Rhodesia and
was influenced by his Maoist allies in China.&quot; (1)

Plenty of historic precedent existed to show Mugabe that his plan would fail
as a means of growing the economy (or &quot;equitable distribution,&quot; either, for
that matter), but that it would succeed admirably as a means of controlling
the populace.  Keep 'em hungry and homeless, and they can't fight.

Genocide is the deliberate destruction of an ethnic, religious or national -
as in political - group.  The word fits just fine.  From the man who coined
it:

&quot;Generally speaking, genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate
destruction of a nation, except when accomplished by mass killings of all
members of a nation. It is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of
different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the
life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves.
The objectives of such a plan would be the disintegration of the political
and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion,
and the economic existence of national groups, and the destruction of the
personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the
individuals belonging to such groups.&quot; (2)

One example of Mugabe's genocide:

Yet it is primarily black folks that are suffering, in huge numbers.

I can't recall a recent disaster that was caused in part by the country's

No.  Seizing the farms was deliberate.  Making them

Look, I don't think you're a bad person and I don't know

that when someone relies on a small number of very biased
information sources that person tends to either take on
those biases or give the appearance of having taken on those
biases.  So, while you may or may not be personally

What's been going on in Zimbabwe is horrific.  But it's not
actual genocide.  It's not planned starvation.  Africa is
chockablock with countries where people are starving because
of mismanagement of their economies by corrupt totalitarian
governments.  It's full of civil wars where genocide *is*
taking place.  It's full of countries led by totalitarian
thugs who routinely use murder and rape to consolidate
power.  The American right has almost completely failed to
give a crap about any of this (some right-wing evangelicals
have been trying to work on hunger issues and sex slavery in
Africa, but that's pretty much it).  However, they do seem
to think that Zimbabwe is a very big deal.  It's inevitable
that people are going to wonder why you care about Zimbabwe
and not any of the other ongoing nightmares.

&quot;The main proponents of 'universal coverage' want to throw more money at the current health care system,
which strikes me as unwise. I believe that the 'universal coverage' mantra is dysfunctional for the same
reason that 'more money for public schools' is a dysfunctional mantra for education. When your current
approach is digging you into a hole, the sensible thing to do is not to dig faster. It is to stop digging.&quot;

Flick,
I really don't know what else you want me to say.  I have made my
case.  You disagree, there is no need for me to fumble around to try to
find stats to prove my case for a variety of reasons.
There are not sites/stats that confirm what I believe in my heart.  I
have had respect for you.  I don't know what Melinda said that would
elicit you calling her what you did.  I find it difficult to discuss
anything with someone that talks like that.
You are damn right I would be crying the blues if I had to do without
what I call the luxuries in life, AC, refrigeration, gas, etc. etc.  Who
do you think would be listening? My friends, my family, etc.  Just like
now, when I complain to my legislators about the war, NO one listens,
nothing changes. I vow that I would not want one single life lost for my
comfort.
I am as liberal as the day is long, but I have no more patience with
the Democrats than I do the Republicans FWIW.  I have lost faith that we
live in a democracy.  I think Bush and his cronies are corrupt.  It
doesn't really matter who is to blame for this war.  Bush announced
early on that we had prevailed. So, let's get the Hell out.
My point is that we have lost almost 4,000 lives and spent billions of
dollars and for what?
I suggest we spend more money on providing food to starving countries.
As I mentioned in another post, it would not hurt my feelings a bit to
send in some gung-ho CIA or thugs off the street to off dictators and
murderers.  Hey,  it's not like we haven't ever done it before.  You
know a secret operation.
I am impressed with your knowledge about Zimbabwe, but I don't
understand why you aren't as concerned about other starving, suffering
people that are being raped, tortured, and murdered.  I am aware of the
same horrors in other countries.  In fairness, perhaps you are only
honing in on them, because that was the topic of this thread?
I am sorry for all suffering people everywhere.  There is no way in
Hell that I want us to go to war against any country.
I repeat we could share our war chest money for food and medical
supplies if we did not have a war.
Actually, as selfish as it is, I do believe we need to take care of
our own first.  If the men and women that fought in this war are cared
for mentally and physically when they return, and if we care for the
survivors of the ones that don't, we won't have a nickel to spare to
argue about.
You may want to consider the above is my opinion, it does not make me
right and you wrong, it is my opinion.  I am allowed to think what I
want aren't I?

Be Free.....Judy

I find it difficult to keep my temper with Shore when she calls me a racist
and a right-wing extremist by inference.  It isn't the first time.

Shore:  &quot;The reason that the extreme right is vexed over Zimbabwe and
not the Congo or any of the other atrocity loci is simple:
Mugabe took land and farms away from white Africans and gave
them to black Africans, and there are black Africans
committing atrocities against white Africans.  It's the only
country in Africa where this is the case, as far as I know,
and it's consequently the only country in Africa right-wing
extremists give a crap about.&quot;

I voiced concern over and over again about the people who are starving due
to Mugabe's deliberate policies; the vast majority of those starving, of
course, are black Africans.  Yet *I'm* a racist and extremist?!?!   I won't
let that nasty and false an insult pass without a slap back.

Unfortunately, when a dictator who's been in power a while is offed, that

Where are your links and references, Shore?  It's been days since you were
asked for 'em.

My concern is that Mugabe's policies have turned Zimbabwe from the
breadbasket of its region into a land of starving people.  It's been
dramatic.  Had he taken productive land from *black* farmers to give to
inexperienced nonfarming cronies of any skin shade or ethnic background, I
would be just as concerned.  That land grab and his other policies have
resulted in much suffering, primarily of blacks.

Mugabe is most certainly a racist.  Just because his animosity is directed
against whites doesn't mean he isn't.  Perhaps you share some of the Left's
belief that black people cannot be so, or that white people deserve to be
hated.

I'm not responsible for anybody's opinion but my own.

The problems of the people in Afghanistan entered my consciousness around
the time of the Russian invasion, which pre-dated 9/11 by a couple of
decades, iirc.

Women's oppression is not a completely separate topic from oppression of the
society as a whole.  It ain't good for anyone (men, women, children) when
one segment of a society is so constrained, as under fundie Islam.
Flexibility and adaptability are key for societies to advance and prosper.

I've got no use for the violent radical Muslims - the ones that call the US
the Great Satan and plot to attack our civilians, and say they intend to
convert the world to Islam by force.  And I don't believe that all Muslims
are that way.  So, &quot;hating Muslims&quot;?  Nope.

You voted for it.  You oppose increasing tax revenues to
cover the deficit.  You support the Iraq mess, which is
ultimately going to cost in the neighborhood of $1 trillion
(it's already $600 billion).  The deficit situation sits
squarely on the shoulders of you and yours.  And yes, it
affects our ability to use our money to help manage crises
overseas, resolve diplomatic problems, and help people in
need.

And, btw, within the last six months the household savings
rate has rising above 0%.  The federal government is still
spending more than it's taking in.  No wonder George Bush
wants to keep the costs of the Iraq war off-budget and
handled in supplementals.  So, while you threw in a
reference to consumer spending, consumers are actually
managing their budgets somewhat better than George Bush is,
despite stagnant real wages.  (And a small point, but you'd
better hope that American consumers keep spending somewhat
freely, since personal consumption contributes *72%* of the
US GDP).

Thank you, GOP fiscal policy!

Zimbabwe came up in the discussion because of the original post wrt pets
being eaten there.  Why the hell would I post about Haiti or women in
Chechnya?

You're all over the place.

However, even though you posted this:  &quot;What I do know is that when these
questions come up, as they inevitably do (not just Zimbabwe,
but Congo, Haiti, Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone, starvation
in Malawi, ... ) the American right (with the exception of
evangelicals) has consistently failed to respond. &quot;

I refuted it with a list of the aid we're sending to those countries, even
in this so-called right-wing administration, under President Bush.  Pwned!

You know very little about my &quot;political life&quot; except that I used to call
myself a Democrat.  I may have more compassion than you do for the

I've been discussing Zimbabwe, not Bush's pipeline policy, not his foreign

That remains to be seen, at least on the east and west coasts, where the

Not hardly.  First, the Bush administration is sending aid
to countries with authoritarian dictatorships and in which

Don't spend this money on family planning!&quot;

I knew that.  Lots of southern Democrats switched parties.

Hi!  You're confusing Marxism (and I very much doubt you've

Well, okay.  So the fact that you voted for him for reason
&lt;a&gt; completely absolves you of responsibility for his
actions &lt;b&gt;, &lt;c&gt;, &lt;d&gt;, ...   Wow!  Now just how cool is
that!!!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I am in favor of first cutting pork and seeing where that leaves us.
">

I think I've heard that before.  The actual proposals I've
seen have been to cut a few 100ths of a percent here and a
few 100ths of a percent there.  Eliminating Social Security
(LIKE THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN) would also eliminate payroll tax
revenues, which are currently running a surplus and funding
the freakin' Bush deficits.  There's just not that much to
cut, besides the military, and you guys have already pretty
much gutted that so that we need to increase military
spending (both hardware and personnel), not cut it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I'd
&gt;also like to crack down more on tax offenders.

You'll be delighted to know that under the Bush
administration, the number of audits of people receiving the
Earned Income Tax Credit has jumped.  You'll also be
delighted to know that the prosecution of corporate tax
fraud has fallen, because corporate tax fraud is good for
business^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hthe
economy^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hbusiness^H^H^H^H^H^Hwhatever.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From what I've seen, the budget only gets balanced about every 30-40 years
&gt;or so, no matter who's in office.
">

Actually, over the past 50 years the budget has consistently
done better under Democrats than under Republicans.  So has
the economy (GDP growth, productivity growth), the stock
market, personal income gains, and so on.  It is remarkably
consistent.  Several explanations have been proffered:
1) spurious correlation, 2) Republicans are more interested
in giving breaks to business than they are in shepherding
the economy, and 3) G-d hates Republicans.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;That remains to be seen, at least on the east and west coasts, where the
&gt;foreclosure rate has gotten so high.  My reference was to consumer
&gt;*borrowing,* anyway.  I'm not in favor of the great deal of borrowing that's
&gt;occurred.
">

Well, that's the point.  We had these policies in place that
allowed a lot more liquidity than we were used to, we had
lax regulation of lenders combined with ratings firms that
were basically on crack (overrating extremely risky
mortgage-backed securities), and we had consumers who were
cashing out their homes to buy geegaws.  That's the &quot;Bush
recovery&quot; from the 2002 recession.  Consumer spending
constitutes 72% of all economic activity in the US.  When
that slows, which is happening, what exactly do you think is
going to happen to the economy!  Think hard!

And thank you for voting Republican!!

Politics makes strange bedfellows.  I don't expect that to change.

USAID does provide funds and assistance for family planning:

It's an old, old argument, Shore - claiming that &quot;true&quot; marxism is okay and
doesn't involve totalitarianism.  In the real world, though, it doesn't
wash.

I know firsthand that there's an enormous amount of fraud in the earned
income credit program, and it's easy to find, so it makes sense to crack
down on that.  As opposed to auditing corporate behemoths, which can take
years.

No President can micromanage the whole country.  You ought to be happy about
that, since you hate Bush so much.

Quit changing the subject.  Back to Zimbabwe.  Where are your links refuting
what I posted about Zimbabwe, which you said is untrue?
