The problem is that I am unsure if I want to go. My sister told my
parents that I was involved in Pornography (when I was not) she
thought I was when I got started in Modeling and met a guy in a hotel
room for him to take pics. He had come up from Tucson and that was the
only place. I admit it might have been against my better judgment,
however, my boyfriend went with me and met the guy and stayed in the
parking lot. He knew when I should be done and I kept my phone with me
at all times. However, my sister knew that my boyfriend had done some
amature stuff with his late wife and just automatically assumed I was
doing the same. No one believed me and therefore, my parents now knew
of him having done that in the past. They shut us out of their lives
and said some nasty stuff and would not believe anything I said. I
have much more respect for myself and have not gotten involved in that
kind of lifestyle. I told my sister she should have came to me first
and she said she just didn't think of that. I told her I did not want
to talk to her anymore. I felt totally separated from my family. I
became that way actually. About 2 months later I found out I was
pregnant and it was not planned and I thought my world was going to
fall apart since I couldn't involve my family in it. It is now over 2
years later. I forgave my sister many many months ago. In august I
think we started talking again. While we weren't though, she became
engaged. She told my daughter she was going to be the flower girl and
never asked me if it were ok. I finally confronted her on that and she
asked me if it were ok. I said yes of course (for my daughter's sake)
She was already excited about it. And my sister wants me to make her
wedding album and her garters. But I am going to attend the wedding as
her guest. I feel like I am only invited cause my daughter is in it.
Am I wrong to thing this is not right?and to be insulted?

I guess I don't understand why you are insulted. Our parents are both
gone now, and I have one brother and that is it - and he lives 1000
miles from me. He invited to me to his wedding, but no, I was not in
the wedding party. It didn't occur to me to be put out. I went, I had
fun, and I was happy for my brother!

If you really want to know, I'd rather not be a bridesmaid when I'm a
married lady with three kids - it might have been a thrill when I was
young and single and had time for all the duties, but now, feh!  More
fun to be a guest. As it was, I ended up having to drive a van full of
relatives to and from the reception, and ferry a batch of them to the
airport. Heck, we're family, and I really, really have no need for a
turquoise satin dress with shoes dyed to match.

Oh man, I have 4 sisters, ages at the time 33-44, all married, all
with kids. I thought it was silly to have grown women dress up in
matching costumes to be brides'maids'. So I asked instead that all
their daughters participate as bridesmaids or flower girls. Geez,
you'd think I'd have told them they weren't welcome! I couldn't
believe the fuss 3 of 4 of them caused (one was happy not to have to
dress up). Fortunately as it was a Catholic ceremony, I had them all
participate (as did mybrothers) by doing readings/prayers of the
faithful and that gave them a chance to "be on stage" which helped
calm the waters a bit.

Call me crazy but I am not into the whole bridesmaid thing. Much more
fun to be a guest!
