Last Tuesday, I finally got around to making my first braggot.  Using
a Scotch Ale as the base beer, I used buckwheat honey and made a four
gallon batch.

The recipe is:

(steep the following grain in 2 quarts 150 degree water for 30
minutes):  10 ounces 10L crystal malt; 2 ounces Belgian aromatic malt;
2 ounces British chocolate malt; 2 ounces peat-smoked malt.  Sparge
with 2 quarts 150 water.  Add 1/2 water to pot.  Bring to boil.

Add three pounds extra light DME and boil for forty minutes.

Add five pounds buckwheat honey.  Boil three more minutes.

Remove from heat.  Chill.  Add to carboy.  Top off to four gallons.
Pitch one packet Lalvin D-47.  Aerate the living hell out of.

OG: 1.093.

The must from the hydrometer flask was obviously sweet.  The honey was
heavier tasting than I anticipated.

No.  The style traditionally uses very little, or no hops at all. All,
I figure the yeast will dry it up enough.

I probably won't try it until the end of the year.  How long does a
braggot usually take to finish up?

Mine took 11 days to drop from 1.093 to 1.020 using EC-1118 - seemed
very fast to me.  It was in the secondary for three months due to my
having another surgery and dropped to 1.012.  Although it was ovrhopped,
it was drinkable at four months, but than is it possible to overhop an
IPA. It will be entered at Vahalla, a Mead only competition, in October
when it will be 11 months old.

my braggot was lighter on the honey and heavier on the malt side, but
even using nottingham it dried up a hell of a lot. It was in the
primary for a week, and the first taste was not good, very green. I
was hoping to turn this around like a normal beer, but I guess even
the light honey addition requires a lot of time to even out. Here's
the recipe:

3lbs wheat dme
2 lbs clover honey
1 lb wildflower honey
.75 oz ground coriander
.5 oz bitter orange peel
nottingham yeast

OG 1.045
FG .999 (!)
est. ABV 6.25%

My question is: how long do you think this guy will take to age? I
racked it to secondary after a week (was mostly done with ferment) and
it's been in there for week so far. Maybe I'll blend this into a
normal heffe down the road and see what that does. (was just listening
to the lecture on brewing network about beer blending)

With the bittering hops and low gravity, I imagine it must be pretty
bitter.  Do you plan to back-sweeten it?

If I do anything to it other than age it, I will probably blend a
heffe with a higher FG with it. I don't know the ratio yet, but I'll
experiment :) Has anyone done a low gravity braggot before? When was
it drinkable?
