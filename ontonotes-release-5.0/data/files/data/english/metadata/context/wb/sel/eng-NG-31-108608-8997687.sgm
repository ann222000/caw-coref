http://www.wired.com/science/space/news/2007/10/gravitational_waves

From the article:

The race is on to detect ripples from the most massive events in the
universe: spinning, orbiting, exploding or colliding ultra-dense
objects like black holes and neutron stars.

In 1918, Albert Einstein predicted these cosmic events would radiate a
propagating distortion of space and time: gravitational waves. After
spending hundreds of millions of dollars to detect them, scientists
have come up empty.

But don't write off the hunt just yet. Physicists worldwide have been
fine-tuning enormous, multimillion-dollar machines to filter out
background noise so they can observe the unique signatures of a
gravitation wave. Before the decade is out, they believe they'll
record the percussive crash of colliding black holes or the vibrant
hum of a pulsar -- a discovery that would be the proverbial shot heard
around the scientific world.

&quot;I tell students they're lucky,&quot; said Rana Adhikari, a principal
investigator at the Caltech-MIT Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory. &quot;They're getting in at the right time
-- it's right before we see something.&quot;

The first concrete proof that gravitational waves exist will not only
verify a key tenet of relativity theory, but provide unprecedented
insight into the mysterious lives of black holes, neutron stars, quark
stars (if these controversial objects exist), cosmic strings (also
controversial) and probably other as-yet unimagined treasures.

-------------------

This is Star-trek physics at its best, ahahaha... Of course, if they
don't find the gravitational waves, that's wonderful news because it
just means that they'll have to spend hundreds of millions more of the
tax payer's money to keep on looking. ahahaha... Very clever.

The concept of gravitational waves is pure crackpottery because it
assumes that gravity propagates at the speed of light. The truth is
that gravity is instantaneous, as Newton correctly assumed. Gravity is
a non-local, energy conservation phenomemon.

Not at all. This research is not trying to prove that gravity is
instantaneous. It's trying to prove that GR is correct. If they don't
find the waves, it does not mean (to them) that the waves don't exist.
It's simply means (to them) that they have to keep looking. That's the

Well, no. Quite a lot of things in science were expected to be found
and received quite a lot of funding. After decades of research they
were not found and the theories were changed...

For example, special theory was created as a result of this process.
The Aether was expected to permeate all of space around the earth and
light was expected to move at different speed demanding on the
direction it was travelling. The results of trying to measure that
speed difference turned out to be negative so the Aether theory was
rejected and replaced with special relativity.

Since this process of replacing a faulty theory by a better one which
accounts for all the facts happened everytime in history, I see no
reason to believe it won't happen here. The reason they keep searching
for gravitationnal waves is that they know their machine isn't
accurate enough to find them. Once detectors known to be accurate
enough are built - which returns negative results - then GR will be
accepted as false.

They argument you mention - the possibility of GR being false - is the
precisely the argument used to fund this research. They tell the
politicians &quot;we need to find g-waves, if we don't a century of
research will be false. Fund this research!&quot;

That will never happen. And don't compare this crap with the search
for the aether. There are all sorts of aethers, not just the
luminiferous kind. It took just a few experiments by M&amp;M (at their
expense, IIRC) to kill the aether idea completely. By contrast, the
gravity waves people have been searching for decades and they have
spent a shitload of other people's money in the process. There's no

Bullshit. They tell the politicians that GR needs further research to
prove that Einstein was right. Like I said, a null result simply means
they need more money to conduct more experiments. If Einstein knew
what he was talking about, it would be self-evident (from the theory)
that gravity propagates at the speed of light and there would be no
need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a wild goose chase.
Mark my words, this research will continue until some smart and honest
politician (not the relativists currently holding the purse strings)
realizes that the people are being conned out of their money. Besides,
it's not as if the result of this experiment will change the world in
the least. My TV, my car and my computer will still work as they did
before. It's just a bunch of useless crap.

No.  GR doesn't assume anything of the kind.  It's a prediction based
on outcomes of the field equations under linearized solutions.  Newton
made a lot of assumptions that have been refuted in later years.  And
maybe you could give us a comprehensive explanation of what that last
sentence actually means.   Or maybe you could explain to us how field
theory works in general.  But then again, with your feeble

That's how the grant trough is kept brimming full.

What better way than to delude ignorant politics into blindly funding
research that can never be proven either right nor wrong.

&gt; From the article:

&gt; The race is on to detect ripples from the most massive events in the
&gt; universe: spinning, orbiting, exploding or colliding ultra-dense
&gt; objects like black holes and neutron stars.

&gt; In 1918, Albert Einstein predicted these cosmic events would radiate a
&gt; propagating distortion of space and time: gravitational waves. After
&gt; spending hundreds of millions of dollars to detect them, scientists
&gt; have come up empty.

&gt; But don't write off the hunt just yet. Physicists worldwide have been
&gt; fine-tuning enormous, multimillion-dollar machines to filter out
&gt; background noise so they can observe the unique signatures of a
&gt; gravitation wave. Before the decade is out, they believe they'll
&gt; record the percussive crash of colliding black holes or the vibrant
&gt; hum of a pulsar -- a discovery that would be the proverbial shot heard
&gt; around the scientific world.

&gt; &quot;I tell students they're lucky,&quot; said Rana Adhikari, a principal
&gt; investigator at the Caltech-MIT Laser Interferometer
&gt; Gravitational-Wave Observatory. &quot;They're getting in at the right time
&gt; -- it's right before we see something.&quot;

&gt; The first concrete proof that gravitational waves exist will not only
&gt; verify a key tenet of relativity theory, but provide unprecedented
&gt; insight into the mysterious lives of black holes, neutron stars, quark
&gt; stars (if these controversial objects exist), cosmic strings (also
&gt; controversial) and probably other as-yet unimagined treasures.

PD makes a good point when he points out
that a handful of General Relativity Guru's
benefit from the billions of dollars
wasted trying to hack General Relativity
to bring it into compliance with observations.

As PD points out,
the taxpayers and the grunts get the shaft,
the General Relativity Guru's get the fame and fortune,

and the Einstein Cultists get to promote the Urban legend
that they are intellectually superiority to the masses,
even though in the free market,
they best they could do would be to
work at Taco Bell or McDonalds.

Einstein is incredibly famous and very well loved.
As far as I can tell, all those who ever disagreed with him
have been found wrong.  Tom Potter doesn't know the mind of God.

Stephen Hawking is also well liked ( and productive ),
but, throughout his life, he made more mistakes than Einstein.

After considering Q.M.'s path integral, Stephen Hawking said:
“ a true event horizon never forms, just an apparent horizon. ”.

Einstein said:
“ The essential result of this investigation is
a clear understanding as to why ‘ Schwarzschild singularities ’
do not exist in physical reality. ”.

Just as it's impossible to measure ( or produce ) a perfect vacuum,
it's impossible to empirically measure ( or produce )
something denser than planck density.

Regard Jeff Relf's comment:

&quot;As far as I can tell, all those who ever disagreed with him
have been found wrong. &quot;

It appears that Jeff Relf did not know that

Einstein took a cheap shot at Maxwell Electrodynamics,
a powerful model of reality that is used SUCCESSFULLY
every day in electronics, chemistry, the GPS System, etc.
in trying to discredit Maxwell,
and promote his &quot;Tower of Babel&quot;.

Einstein started off his infamous paper
with the following strawman:

&quot;It is known that Maxwell's electrodynamics--as usually understood at the
present time--
when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries
which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena.
Take, for example, the reciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a
conductor.&quot;

Note that Einstein tries to discredit Maxwell
by introducing the strawman,
about how the conductor and magnet interact with
a third point (The observer),
rather than how they react with each other,
as observed from the third point.

And Jeff Relf  did not know that Einstein was the
&quot;Poster Boy to prove superior Jewish intelligence&quot;,

and as Jews and Jewish controlled used Institutionalized Bigotry
to smear and discredit any Scientists
(Or for that matter, ANYONE),
who made an effort to oppose
the creation of the Einstein Myth,

that Bohr tried to engage Einstein in
debates to prove that Quantum Mechanics,
NOT General relativity&quot; was the more
useful and correct model of reality,
( Realty is discrete rather than continuous,
and it's multibody qualities necessitate the use
of a statistical approach.)

and that Einstein tried to equivocate,
and avoid Bohr and the efforts to
the founders of Quantum Mechanics to
make QM respectable, and when pressed to the wall,
got together with two other Jews ( Podolsky, and Rosen )
and came up with the discredited EPR Paradox
in a final effort to discredit Quantum Mechanics.

And tJeff seems to be unaware
hat Einstein supported the Gang that was
instigating the Class Wars of the 1900's,
and that as he could not be trusted with
American secrets, he was not allowed to
participate in the development of Military technology,

and Jeff seems to be unaware that Einstein
supported Zionism, a divisive and destructive
social force, that brought on 911,
the war against the Iraqi people,
the Pearl harbor attacks by Israel
on Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, etc,

and a force that is aggressively and systematically
trying to con American Blacks, Latinos and Rednecks
into sacrificing theory lives, limbs, liberties, and fortunes
to wage war against the Iranian people.

I suggest that Jeff Relf should come to understand
that a person, or a group, or a religion, or a nation
should be judged by their WORKS,
rather than by their propaganda.

I also suggest that folks should avoid
efforts to get them to waste their time, money,
energy and minds on things that have a
negative rate of return.

Charlatans, conmen, criminals and cult leaders
make use of babble to impose their
agenda upon ignorant and impressionable folks.

Like so many others, Tom, you'd censor the Sci.Physics if you could.
I can afford to “ waste time ” on Relativity,
just like billionaires can waste time on sports teams and stadiums.

I should judge you by your “ WORKS ”, you say ?
I don't see you earning money in the free market, bettering society.

You need one of those General Relativity

If you want to see me

I could easily become homeless Tom, as could Bert.
Personally, I doubt wealth has anything to do with happiness.
Feed the pigeons and you just get more of them.

In General Relativity both the past and future are fixed,
time is a spatial dimension;
i.e. the ( 4-D ) hypervolume is static, motionless, immutable.

G.R. doesn't allow forward-motion in time, much less backward.
Speaking of GR's gravitational field, Einstein said:

“ But this ether may not be thought of as
endowed with the quality characteristic of ponderable media,
as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time.

The idea of motion may not be applied to it. ”.
