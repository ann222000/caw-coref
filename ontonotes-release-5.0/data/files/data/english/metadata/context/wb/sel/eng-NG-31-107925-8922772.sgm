Now Rusty is playing WWE announcer and making a non-issue of the 24 bump on the 8.
It's really more like.... the 8 car had been running high on the wall for about a hundred laps, then
all of a sudden he decides to block the 24 by dropping low for one lap when he see him coming.
24 has no patience for that kind of shit driving. No matter how &quot;popular&quot; he is.

No, I didn't observe &quot;that (that is&quot;) the 8 was running higher around
the *entire* track, and just happen to move down to &quot;block&quot; Jeffy Poo.

I dunno, how many times have we seen Jr with a pretty good car
(running in the top 10) only to end up falling waaaaaay back during
night races?

I'm very curious to see if this still happens with Tony Eury Jr as his
CC at HMS.

If he wants to win a Championship right off next year he needs not to party

The ABC folks are obviously pro-Junior.  They entirely missed the
reason JG tapped him in the back, the reason being that Junior did run
the high line all the way around the track until Gordon was behind
him, and then he persistently moved down to block him in the inside
lane.  Good for JG - he didn't spin him out.

Junior was just toying with him, trying to add some excitement, but I
was listening to JG on HotPass, and he wasn't very appreciative of
it ;-)  It was obvious what Junior was up to, EXCEPT to Rusty and the
rest of the ABC crew, who thought Junior should be mad.  Right, Rusty,
just keep on thinking that.  I thought JG showed great patience
waiting for Junior to quit playing games.

After JG tapped him, he continued to run the high line the whole
race.  Too bad that ABC couldn't take a look at the whole picture.

There were 2 sides to this story, but I won't barge in on your HMS

FWIW, Junior was on HotPass all year except for 2 races (the road

Well, I signed up for HotPass with 11 to go - special, $20.  I
wouldn't use it for the whole season.  As to &quot;love fest,&quot; somewhere
between ABC and HotPass I would guess is the real story.  I know
things get skewed in the passion of racing.

BTW, DTV tells me that they and Nascar together decide who the 5
drivers on HotPass will be each week.

So what if he was blocking him Nancy.  It's the passing car that is
responsible for making the pass without contact.  I didn't see the
race but I saw the highlights.  IF what you say is true, (and I assume
it is) JG should have been in the fence very very quickly.  If he hit
Jr. on purpose, which I think you will agree he did, then old school
says Jr. should have immediately put him in the fence.  The fact that
he did not wreck Jr. has nothing to do with the fact that he hit him
to make the move.  Jr. and anyone else on track has every right to run
what ever line they choose, when ever they choose.  Racing isn't about
moving over.  Jeff or anyone else out there should either be able to
make a clean pass or stay put.  Not even Jeff can call Nascar and get
them to tell every other driver that Jeff wants to run x line so make
sure you don't run there.

Now if Jeff had banged into Jr.s door trying to go side by side
through the corners, that's racing.  I never will subscribe to the
logic of if you can't pass them, knock them out of the way.  Michael
Schumacher is even worse.  He will wreck him intentionally to attempt
to wreck his title rival to win a championship.  Don't believe me?
Then go ask JV.  He has first hand knowledge.  The knockem out of the
way attitude so I don't have to bother with a clean pass is only one
step away from an &quot;intentional but instinctive move&quot; and both are the
worst that motorsports has to offer.  Its low no matter who does it
and how successful one is when they do it.

Trouble is with SpecCAR, this situation is exactly what SpecCAR
wants.  The only good thing about the COT is that with the rear wing,
there is enough downforce that the move over hit won't work nearly as
well.  It will take a much harder hit and will be much more likely to
wreck someone because of the extra rear downforce.  When cars are so
close to the same, its harder to have a speed difference great enough
to make a clean  pass so drivers just wreckem instead of racing them.
Wrecks seem to be what some think are driving the ratings.

Honestly it I would have loved to have seen what Nascar would have
done to Jr. if he had pulled  a Days of Thunder on Jeff.

That is not true at all. If a driver is changing lines to block (or just
drivin' the hillbilly highway as in Jr.'s case), NASCAR (and Jeff Gordon)
have ways of dealing with them.

No open wheel driver is capable of the bump and run quite like the NASCAR

Just like ole' whiny boy Rusty, everyone is only speculating about JG's intentions.
It's likely that JG miscalculated his closing rate and accidently made contact.

He didn't &quot;miscalculate&quot; anything. LOL

I don't have any problem with what JG did, why some JG fans feel the
need to &quot;defend&quot; JG's driving style is beyond me.

News Flash - JG has *always* been a driver that would try to move/bump
a driver out of the way.

Dale Sr's comments from the 1996 exhibition race in Japan...
(pharaphrased) Look at that (pointing to the front of JG's car) don't
ever let anybody tell ya that he won't try to move ya. (bumper and
hood were bent in from trying to get around Dale Sr in the last 2 or 3
laps)

Well, first, I was mistaken about it being intentional.  JG's radio
conversation showed he was saying, &quot;WTF with Junior, why is he doing
this?&quot; but in his post-race interview, he said it was totally
unintentional, that Junior got in front of him and checked up and he
didn't mean to hit him, and for his crew to be sure to tell Junior
that he didn't hit him on purpose (this was immediately after the
bump).

In any event, Jr. was slower when he went down on the line than JG
was.  JG had the car to beat all night, and rode the bottom of the
track throughout the race, especially in the last 50 laps.

I think JG's frustration was that he didn't want to wreck Jr. if Jr.
kept popping down in front of him and then slowing up.

(According to a wide parsing of print media, ALL the top drivers think
slower cars not competing at the same level should move over for them,
starting back in the day and continuing to this day.  If you prefer to
think this describes JG, he certainly isn't the only one and he didn't
invent the attitude.)

Who knows....JG's the only one who really knows if he did it on
purpose, or if he just couldn't get whoa'd up.

What way does NASCAR have in dealing with a car that blocks?  Blocking is
not illegal.  And... as Mark says, it's not even unethical.  It's part of
racing.  I'm more tolerant than Mark is of nudges to get a car out of the
way if it won't move on its own after a while, but that's just me.

&gt; &gt; Now if Jeff had banged into Jr.s door trying to go side by side
&gt; &gt; through the corners, that's racing.  I never will subscribe to the
&gt; &gt; logic of if you can't pass them, knock them out of the way.  Michael
&gt; &gt; Schumacher is even worse.  He will wreck him intentionally to attempt
&gt; &gt; to wreck his title rival to win a championship.  Don't believe me?

&gt; No open wheel driver is capable of the bump and run quite like the NASCAR
&gt; boys. Equipment damage is a huge deterrent.

&gt; &gt; Honestly it I would have loved to have seen what Nascar would have
&gt; &gt; done to Jr. if he had pulled  a Days of Thunder on Jeff.

&gt; NASCAR's penalty would have likely paled in comparison to what HMS may have
&gt; had in store ;&gt;)
">

As long as what ever line the car ahead is a line and not a snake,
then he has every right to it.  It can be different at different
times.  It can be different at each end of the track.  It just needs
to be predictable.  IF someone takes the line Jeff wants, he has the
obligation to pass elsewhere. Most series have the guts to allow a
driver to make 1 move and 1 move only to protect a position.  After
that you face a penalty.  Trouble is Nascar hasn't got the guts to
really penalize a star on a consistent basis.  Fact is they can't do
anything on a consistent basis.  The highlight I saw, Jr. was holding
his line.  He was punted.  Jr. owes him one.  Jeff may win the title
this year, but with moves like that he will never be a champion.  True
champions don't need that to win.  Jeff is just a little above Michael
Schumacher and its nearly impossible to get lower than Michael in my
book.  Jeff isn't the first to use the move, and I feel just the same
regardless of who does it.

The bump an run is nothing to be glorified.  Its an admission that one
can not be faster than the car in front of them to pass them cleanly,
and sleezy enough to be willing to wreck them to make the pass.  With
the COT the rear end is going to be planted that the traditional bump
and run is going to be a wreckem and run.  Its going to take a much
harder hit to do anything and once it breaks loose, its going to be
much harder to catch.

There are a few in Nascar that are almost untouchable.  Jr and Jeff
are two of them.  What would HMS do?  Probably not much.  The extra PR
alone would have some guys actually stage the event when its a made
for tv event.  That's just the kind of the that made rasslin.  Nascar
is likely to catch on soon.  Grudge match Jr. Jeff, who punts who
first.  See it now.  See the big wrecks.  See the brawl afterwards.
Come one come all. Tickets on sale now.  IF HMS wants to keep that
from happening, they better pull the reins in on Jeff now.   I just
remember how Jeff was nearly crying having to run second because he
didn't put the 48 car to win, and he owns that one.  Jeff sure doesn't
like it when he is on the receiving end.

Predictable would be one driver thinking that if another car comes
down the track to get in front, that car would be faster, not slower.

There's a blogger at foxsports.com/nascar who has pics of the 8 and
the 24 with their attendant speeds.  He may have photoshopped the
pictures, but it doesn't appear so - it looks like he captured them
right off the TV, and it shows speeds nearly equal until Jr. got in

Regardless of speed Nancy it doesn't matter.  IF Jr. wants to slow up
to protect his position that is a part of racing and it should have
made it easier for Jeff to pass.  Now if Jeff had moved to the inside,
Jr. come down, then Jeff go high and Jr. go high that is the snaking
that I am talking about.  That would be way out of line.  The
highlight I saw (which was brief by my own admission) didn't show
anything like that.  IF Jeff is a 4 time champ and if Jr. is that much
slower, then Jeff should have more than ample talent to pass him with
intentionally hitting him. Jr didn't brake check him from the
highlight I saw.   It may take him a few laps to do something drastic
in racing these days.  Its called setting up a pass and planning where
its going to happen, then making it happen.  No driver is entitled to
any line, no matter how many titles or how well it works for them.  If
they want a line that isn't there, its up to them to make another
work, not just wreck the driver.  If Jeff were half the driver he
thinks he is, he would be ashamed that he didn't have the patience to
make a clean pass on a future teammate.

Nascar is beginning to figure out team racing.  For those that don't

hit the wrong part of the car.  It really wasn't the first time
either.  Ask Damon Hill.  Patrick Head, of the Williams racing team
was asked what he would do differently to a car that was in a title
fight with Michael Schumacher.  Without hesitation he said,&quot;Build a
stronger suspension.&quot;

This type of team racing tactics is slowly working into Nascar.
Nascar Now tonight was asking questions about team orders which were
valid questions, and for F1 are old hat.  There its a whole different
dynamic in that since no two teams have the same car its ones team
mate you need to beat the most.  Team orders just confirms to me that

Well some of the Roush drivers have said they would help a team mate
win a title.  IF you have to let them by instead of being able to pass
on their own, if its for position in a sense that is a team order as
well.  Faster should mean passing.  Now if a car is a lap down then
thats a bit different.  Yet every driver should be doing what ever
they can within the rules and within the spirit of fair play to get
and hold every single spot.

This awful chase format makes team tactics far more effective, and the
Nascar boys are figuring it out fairly quickly.  The only thing
slowing it down now is that different team cars have different sponsor
logos on them.

The highlight I saw had Jeff up on the rear bumper plenty of time to
avoid the contact.  Nancy are you going to say Jeff didn't do it
intentionally?  IF Jr. wasn't going to be his teammate next year, and
maybe it won't matter because he isn't now,  Jeff would not finish
Martinsville next week.  Old school he wouldn't have finished for
several weeks.  One thing is for sure.  Jr. won't forget and neither
would any driver out there.  You get raced how you race other people.
Jeff shouldn't say a single word the next time he is moved over, but
history shows he clearly will.

Jeff may win the title this year, but with moves like that he will
never be a champion.  True champions don't need them.

As far as Jeff goes, IIRC didn't Jeff punt Rusty not too long before
he retired?  Rusty will likely get that payback in the booth.

Rusty is just envious of JG's talent.  Punting to me means wrecking.
Jeff didn't &quot;punt&quot; Rusty. He bumped him to move him.  Rusty will never
get over it, or get over his envy.  It's eating him up this season,
because he can't get any satisfaction on the race track.  Furthermore,
JG seems not as unpopular, compared with some others, as he has been
in the past, and that probably pisses Rusty off, too.

Quite simply, there is no proof that he wasn't. That said, proof has
been presented that Hendrick has used team orders in the Chase this
season, while to the best of my knowledge, no such orders have been
issues at DEI so far.

&gt; what you would do in the same circumstance.

&gt; &gt;One thing is for sure.  Jr. won't forget and neither
&gt; &gt; would any driver out there.  You get raced how you race other people.

&gt; You don't know Jr. very well if you think he holds a grudge beyond the
&gt; end of a race.  He hasn't shown it so far in his career, that I
&gt; recall.  Others do - DJ for one.

&gt; &gt; Jeff shouldn't say a single word the next time he is moved over, but
&gt; &gt; history shows he clearly will.

&gt; He admits it, he's a whiner.  Although he hasn't whined much this
&gt; year, notice.

&gt; &gt; Jeff may win the title this year, but with moves like that he will
&gt; &gt; never be a champion.  True champions don't need them.

&gt; BS to the max.  Jeff has already been a &quot;real&quot; champion 4 times.  Are
&gt; you saying that DE Sr. wasn't ever a &quot;champion,&quot; either?  He was
&gt; famous for pushing people out of the way. LOL.

&gt; &gt; As far as Jeff goes, IIRC didn't Jeff punt Rusty not too long before
&gt; &gt; he retired?  Rusty will likely get that payback in the booth.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; Rusty is just envious of JG's talent.  Punting to me means wrecking.
&gt; Jeff didn't &quot;punt&quot; Rusty. He bumped him to move him.  Rusty will never
&gt; get over it, or get over his envy.  It's eating him up this season,
&gt; because he can't get any satisfaction on the race track.  Furthermore,
&gt; JG seems not as unpopular, compared with some others, as he has been
&gt; in the past, and that probably pisses Rusty off, too.

&gt; N.
">

The difference between pushing someone out of the way and wrecking
them falls into more the luck than skill.  Once you pushed someone out
of the way, they were punted as far as I am concerned.  What Jeff said
means nothing to me.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it has been
around a whole lot longer than Nascar.  What I saw was a car that was
totally under control easing up to the bumper of a car ahead of him
with the expressed purpose of cause control problems so they could get
by.  That's punting.

That's exactly what I am saying.  BP retired because he realized that
if he was leading on the last lap with a car on his bumper, he was
going to finish second.  IF he was second, he was going to finish
second because he refused to play that game. THAT is a true champion,
even if it was only one.  Sad thing is that Sr. might have been just
as successful without his knocking others out of the way, but we won't
ever know.

Frankly had Nascar had the guts to come down on Sr. then a lot of the
problems they are having now wouldn't be happening.  Jeff called Sr.
his hero. Yet Nascar is consistent at being inconsistent.  Jeff pushes
Jr. out of the way an maybe only a skilled driver saves the car and
Jeff is rewarded.  Robby Gordon pushes a driver who punted him out of
the way and punts him back and Nascar suspends him.  Both are equally
intentional. Seems real consistent to me.  Frankly I only remember Sr.
ever being penalized once for rough driving. Even I could wreck
someone to win.  No sport in that. Frankly I don't remember Jeff every
being penalized for rough driving, though he has deserved it many
times.

Team orders are not illegal in Nascar, they haven't been as blatant as
they are in F1 yet.  Give it time.

Rusty jealous???  Hardly. Lousy broadcaster?  Well I won't argue that
but jealous isn't something that I would think would come to mind any
more than Rusty would be jealous of Richard Petty.  Richard had more
wins, but in a totally different era just like Jeff and Rusty are in
different eras though there was some overlap. Holding a grudge over
getting punted?  Maybe.

Jeff shouldn't move over any more than Jr. should have.  Yet the next
time Jr. is on his bumper he should expect the same treatment he
dished out without whining.

Why should Rusty still hold a grudge now?
The following race at Richmond, he blatantly made a right turn and sent Jeff into the wall just as
Jeff was passing him on the outside.
I would say that's enough payback for a silly punt (times ten).
Those kind of cheap shots still won't put Rusty near the same level as JG's greatness though.

Putting who is the better driver aside, which many here can't seem to
look at the sport anyway other than through the eyes of their guy
which is a shame, that would be an old school payback.  You get raced
how you race others.  Race clean and you are raced clean.  Knock
someone out of the way and old school drivers kept a tally.  I was an
eye for an eye and one for one.   One payback is not good enough for 3
punts, especially if that punt kept you from a win.  Just another
score board, and it usually wasn't personal.  Yet it occasionally
could get that way.  Don't race clean, then don't expect to be raced
clean but they do.  Most will holler like an old dog hearing a
ambulance when that payback happens.

I don't remember all the details, but I bet Rusty could tell you right
off the top of his head who punted him when and how many times.  Jeff
is a great driver, but several things happened all at once to help him
along and most of them were timing and just dumb luck.  Jeff might
even admit it.  Mix that with talent and you almost always have
success.  It takes a certain amount of luck for anyone to be
successful, and no one should hold that against him.  Yet if you gave
Jeff the exact SAME SET OF SKILLS, and moved him back in time to the
early 60s I personally don't think he would have ever gotten the
opportunity and if he did he wouldn't have been nearly as successful.I
doubt he would have made it through the first year.  Never will know
but its one of those things you wonder about.  He surely wouldn't have
made it to cup as quickly with as little knowledge about a stock car
as he had in the beginning.  Yet he is a made for TV era driver.  Sad
thing is that the reverse is equally true.  Put Bill Elliott in the
mix for a ride today as shy as he was when he got started and he would
never have a ride.  He wouldn't have been able to deal with the
cameras to get the chance

I saw a highlight about a pass on the race this weekend and I was
shocked that they were talking about a &quot;dirty pass&quot; Newman made on
Gordon.  The Espn talking heads were discussing was it dirty or not.
After seeing the highlight all I saw was a short track pass.  Newman
didn't hit him in the rear bumper to get him loose.  He set him up and
made the move to the inside and I didn't see where Jeff made any move
that was out of line in any way to block him.  Might have been some
door handle to door handle contact, but certainly nothing that should
have angered either in the least.  Even that was very minimal and
definitely unintentional.  The way the talking heads were running
their mouths it was like someone didn't get a memo that you were not
surposed to pass Jeff.

I didn't watch the race so there could be more to it, but certainly
not from the highlight I saw.

The highlight I saw showed absolutely nothing either should have been
upset about, but with the coverage lately there was likely more to it
than TV caught and certainly more than made a highlight.  Maybe Jeff
got into RN somewhere else and RN returned the favor.  One thing is
for sure.  IF you make comments like &quot;I am going to put him in the
wall.&quot; over the radio, you better be ready to be in the wall yourself
and not complain.  IF Robby Gordon had made the comment, he likely
would have been black flagged for just saying it over the radio.  I
just wondered if it was a 24 temper fit because someone raced him the
way he races.  Yet it also could be that he has a beef, but Id tend to
lean toward temper fit.  One thing is for sure, no matter what they
say for TV afterwards, it isn't forgotten.

Now here is where Nascar needs to either step in or get out of the
way.  When statements like that are made, its time to park someone or
not get into it at all ever.  Either let the old school self policing,
self enforcing and certain return of like racing be the deterrent or
step in and totally stop it.  Advance your position as a result of
intentional contact, and you finish 5 spots behind the guy you knocked
out of the way.  Wreck them and ruin their day and yours is ruined as
well.  Frankly Nascar could not consistently enforce that rule any
more than they be consistent on anything else.  Old school was more
certain, but back then the money meant something to them.  Today it
really doesn't.  Tearing up a car then meant something.  Today its no
big deal and really no skin off the drivers nose.  Abusing an engine
then would cost you a ride.  Now they tear them up on purpose with
burnouts.

I sure don't fit into the Nascar of today.  That's for sure.

Whoa Mark - it's a comment that was made in the heat of it, - over the team
radio.  Nothing came of it, and it's a reasonably expected comment from
someone engaged in the competitive battle.  As you saw - Gordon thought
wiser of the idea, or was calmed down by his crew chief or spotter, or
whatever, but the point is he blew off some steam in harmless way and
nothing more came of it.

Precisely what was there to stop Mark?  They did some good hard door to door
racing - that's what it's all about.  The old school rule did indeed
prevail.  The only problem is that nobody got punted, so there is no
retribution for the old school rule to pass out.

How many engines have you seen blow up during a burn out.  I think I can
remember one.  That does not support the idea of tearing up engines on
purpose with burnouts.  The entire driveline takes a lot more abuse every
time it comes off the jack in the pit stall than it does from a burnout.

This is the problem with TV having access to everything.  They hear the
moments when a guy gets upset - whether he's right or wrong.  Hell, how many
of us haven't misconstrued some event around us?  So Gordon screwed up at
the moment and thought Ryan was doing something he really wasn't - big
freakin' deal.  But - TV gets a hold of it, makes it bigger than it really
is, and once it starts floating around on the Lake, it quickly becomes part
of the biology of the Lake - takes on a life of its own.  If ESPN had not
broadcast Gordon's comments, everyone would be here talking about how hot
the racing was between the two of them at the end.  Instead, the media not
only puts it out there during the race, but makes it part of shows that air
during the week after the show.  All for the purpose of creating something,
and keeping it alive.  People that are biting on this media bate and getting
their panties all wadded up over Gordon's comment are just playing into the
hands of the media puppet masters.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have angered either in the least.  Even that was very minimal and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitely unintentional.  The way the talking heads were running
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their mouths it was like someone didn't get a memo that you were not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surposed to pass Jeff.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't watch the race so there could be more to it, but certainly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not from the highlight I saw.

&gt; &gt; &gt; JG wasn't happy with &quot;the way RN was racing him&quot;, said if he wanted to
&gt; &gt; &gt; race like that he would &quot;put him in the wall&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have NO clue what JG was upset about. Newman didn't even touch him.

&gt; &gt; They did bump, twice or three times - they both talked about it -
&gt; &gt; they're all good with each other, anyway.  On to Atlanta.

&gt; &gt; The BBs always want to try and make a big deal out of nothing.  It's a
&gt; &gt; special class in broadcast school.  They dwelled so long and so often
&gt; &gt; yesterday on Gordon/Johnson/Stewart/Chase/M'ville records/last week/
&gt; &gt; Talladega, etc. ad nauseum, and ignored so many other stories, it was
&gt; &gt; just ludicrous.  I'm praying that ESPN changes things before next
&gt; &gt; year.

&gt; Nancy, you are the most unbiased JG fan in this group, but in the
&gt; video above, JG had no reason to be upset.

&gt; RN, didn't even touch JG's car...if he did it was slight, nothing to
&gt; be upset about.

&gt; I was surprised that INC didn't play JG's radio about that
&gt; &quot;altercation&quot;.- Hide quoted text -

Well, actually, during RN's interview immediately post-race, he did
acknowledge he bumped into the 24 once on purpose and once
accidentally, and Jeff bumped back at least once, etc.  So there was
some play between the two - but they both said, &quot;We're all good.&quot;  It
just wasn't a big deal.
