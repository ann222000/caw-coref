You know engine braking is so effective that on more modern sport
bikes &quot;slipper&quot; clutches are installed to reduce engine braking.

It seems down shifting from high speeds can cause the back end to get
all squirrley.  With engine braking it is impossible to modulate the
braking effect as precisely as with the rear brake itself.

I guess you could up shift to reduce the braking effect and then down
shift again.  I find just using the brakes to be easier.

As a matter of fact a slipper clutch would be a highly desirable
feature on my next bike.

On my sportbike I find just rolling off the throttle in any gear at
most any speed results in pronounced decelleration.

Might be a difference between scrubbing off speed
and holding back on a downhill.

I find engine braking very useful on downhills in dirt.
Less so if I'm trying to decelerate hard on pavement.

I figure the slipper clutch might also be installed to
protect both the bike and the clueless twit who just
bought it from severely over-revving the engine, but
then what do I know.

That's what I thought those things were for too.

Not that motorcycle manufacturers ever try to
sell into the clueless twit market segment of course :-)

There is a thread over in a.m.s where a poster grenaded his R6, and
according to his dealer it could be a direct result of high speed
downshifting.  Of he lives in Germany and rides the autobahn (i.e. he goes
really fast)

Help me out. Twit, or did you mean twin?  I assume every spells or typos as

Maybe. R6's rev to the Moon, though. The latest R6 has a tach that goes up to
18000 RPM.

The older R6 was designed to rev 2000 or 3000 RPM past its 13000 RPM power
peak so the rider didn't have to shift gears in the middle of a long corner.

GXR1000's are designed with the same idea. When you watch the data panel
during a race, you will see that the riders are staying in the lower three
gears and only getting into high gear on the longest straight.

A GSXR1000 will go about 90 to 100 mph in first gear, what does it need the
other gears for on the street?

But racers are always pulling a lot of high RPM and really need that slipper
clutch to take the binding load off the rear suspension when they roll off
the throttle.

When I used to do illegal road racing with a club of sportbike outlaws, I
would always drag the rear brake through tight corners. This upset one rider
who thought that I should get my braking down and then shoot the corner at
whatever entry speed I set up.

I told him that dragging the rear brake was like adding damping to the rear
shocks. I told him that it was like downshifting into passing gear in a car
with an automatic transmission when I wanted to firm up the suspension so the
rear end wouldn't feel like it was floating as I entered a high speed turn.

He wasn't satisfied. He wanted to know why if I needed stiffer shocks I
didn't just install stiffer shocks?

I told the guy that my only choices were the original equipment shocks, Dutch
Koni shocks that were designed for cars, or Boge shocks that were made in
Mexico.

So I dragged the rear brake to control the rear suspension.

That might work for you, if you want to go into a corner in a higher gear
dragging the rear brake slightly and downshift before driving out of the
corner.

Downshifting after the apex will annoy the shit out of riders on a race
course,
but what does it matter, if you're not on a race course?
