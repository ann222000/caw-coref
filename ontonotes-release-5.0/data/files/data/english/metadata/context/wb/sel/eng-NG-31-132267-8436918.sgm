Just See Amercian goals in Pakistan from this latest report published
in Christian Science Monitor:

WASHINGTON - In debating what to do about Pakistan - after a grim
National Intelligence Estimate last week found Al Qaeda to be re-
energized from its bases there and planning new attacks against the US
- the Bush administration is caught between a familiar rock and a hard
place.

Continue to defer to the regime of President Pervez Musharraf, which
has done little in six years to root out the havens Islamist
extremists have established along the northern border with
Afghanistan, and Osama bin Laden's organization is likely to continue
strengthening and building the next generation of leadership.

But press President Musharraf too hard for swift action against the
Islamist strongholds - especially as he faces the toughest political
pressures of his eight-year rule - and the key American ally could
fall. From the White House's perspective, that would create a
nightmare for the US-led war on terror.

&quot;For the moment, we're stuck,&quot; says Bruce Riedel, a former national
security adviser on counterterrorism and South Asian issues. &quot;We have
a policy that looks increasingly bankrupt, but I don't see the
administration prepared as yet to move away from it or the military
dictator&quot; who stands at its core.

US officials insist that no actions have been ruled out to address the
threat posed by Al Qaeda in Pakistan. They acknowledge, however, that
the US is still banking on cooperation from Musharraf, and is not
about to undertake any unilateral action without the general's
consent.

&quot;There are no options off the table in actionable intelligence
terrorism targets,&quot; White House homeland security adviser Frances
Townsend said last week. But she added, &quot;We will continue to work with
the Pakistani government to address the threat that comes from the
tribal areas&quot; and to &quot;press them to take action to ensure that no part
of Pakistan remains a safe haven for terrorists.&quot;

Pakistan reacted categorically to US talk of no options being ruled
out. &quot;Whatever counterterrorism action is to be taken inside Pakistan,
it will be taken by our own security forces,&quot; Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said Friday. &quot;This has been and remains the
basis of our cooperation with the US.&quot;

Senior officials' visits

Senior administration officials - including Vice President Dick Cheney
and Defense Secretary Robert Gates - have recently visited Pakistan to
urge that more be done to deny Al Qaeda, a resurgent Taliban, and
other extremist groups a haven in Pakistan's tribal areas. White House
officials were heartened by Musharraf's decision this month to seize
an extremist mosque in Islamabad - and by his speech after the violent
raid.

&quot;We are going to battle extremism in every nook of Pakistan and we are
going to rid ... all of Pakistan of extremism,&quot; Musharraf said on
national television this month after ending a truce reached in
September between the government and the tribal areas. He also said
that by year's end security forces along the northern border with
Afghanistan will be equipped with weapons, including tanks, to fortify
the battle with extremists in the region.

The US provides Musharraf with billions of dollars in military and
economic assistance. In June, the State Department announced a five-
year, $750 million counterterrorism initiative for the tribal areas,
consisting of education, health, and sanitation projects - all aimed
at winning over a largely hostile populace.

One policy change the US could adopt immediately, some experts say, is
to condition its largesse on clear action and verifiable progress in
the counterterrorism arena - in a sense, benchmarks.

&quot;If we're putting in $2 billion a year, we could make $1 billion of it
contingent upon developing an effective strategy and undertaking
action against Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other extremists,&quot; says
Stephen Cohen, an expert in South Asian issues at the Brookings
Institution.

Publicly, the administration subscribes to this principle. But critics
of the Bush administration's Pakistan policy - and of the president's
warm embrace of a military dictator - say the fact that Al Qaeda has
enjoyed a certain renaissance under Musharraf's rule suggests the need
for a change in policy.

Still, the options for US policy in Pakistan after six years of
unquestioned support for Musharraf range from &quot;worse to worst,&quot; Mr.
Cohen says. He says no alternative will be able to deliver a positive
result - a stable, democratic Pakistan where the Islamist extremist
fringes have withered away - in the short term.

Two military options, both unlikely

Militarily, the US has two options, says Mr. Riedel, now at the
Brookings Institution. One would be to seize or kill Mr. bin Laden and
his deputy, Ayman Zawahiri, in what military officials call a &quot;snatch
and grab&quot; operation. But Riedel says the intelligence for such a move
must be reliable and timely. &quot;The shelf life of that kind of
intelligence is generally measured in hours, not days or weeks,&quot; he
adds.

A second option, one Riedel says is getting an increased airing in
Washington, is for the US military to take out Al Qaeda and Taliban
camps in remote tribal areas - with or without Musharraf's accord. But
the US doesn't have the forces for such an operation, especially after
the &quot;surge&quot; of troops to Iraq, says Riedel. He and other experts say
such an action would probably cause more problems than it solves.

&quot;There can be no wait-and-see approach by the US in terms of Pakistan,
but neither can there be any unilateral action like a covert operation
against these areas,&quot; says Karl Inderfurth, a former assistant
secretary of State for South Asian affairs. &quot;That would be the kiss of
death for any broad move against the extremists, and it would inflame
the already strong anti-American feelings in the country.&quot;

The US should take advantage of an existing trilateral initiative
among NATO countries, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to address the threat
of terrorism from Pakistani territory, says Mr. Inderfurth, now
specializing in international relations at George Washington
University.

More broadly, however, the US must work - fast - to pressure Musharraf
into opening up Pakistan's political system and tapping into its
shallow but existing democratic roots, experts say. &quot;Musharraf simply
won't be able to mount an effective campaign against the extremists
without broad civilian support,&quot; says Cohen.

And for that, he adds, the military leader will have to move to a
system of power- sharing that encompasses Pakistan's political
parties.

Recent speculation suggested former prime minister Benazir Bhutto
might join Musharraf in a coalition government focused on tackling
extremism. But any moves toward a power-sharing deal may have been
halted by Friday's surprise ruling by Pakistan's Supreme Court, which
reinstated the chief justice Musharraf had suspended in March.

The ruling, which Musharraf announced he would respect, could embolden
the judiciary to challenge Musharraf's plans to secure a new
presidential mandate from the outgoing parliament.

Inderfurth says Musharraf's commitment to holding elections is
positive, but the quest to remain president and military chief is &quot;bad
news.&quot; He says, however, that the US must keep in mind that the 60-
year-old nation &quot;is in the fight of its life&quot; against Islamist
extremism.

Musharraf and the country's moderate political forces must find a way
to come together, he says, &quot;because if they don't the problems
identified in the National Intelligence Estimate will pale in
comparison to what could follow.&quot; The international community &quot;should
very much want Musharraf to prevail in this,&quot; he adds.

Others say Musharraf may be part of the preferred avenue for Pakistan,
but only if that includes a clipping of the general's power and a
broadening of the political power base. The problem for the US, Riedel
says, will be finding a balance between encouraging democratic forces
and abetting Musharraf's demise.

&quot;Having backed Musharraf to the hilt for six years, the slightest hint
of a turn by the US could set off his collapse,&quot; Riedel says.
