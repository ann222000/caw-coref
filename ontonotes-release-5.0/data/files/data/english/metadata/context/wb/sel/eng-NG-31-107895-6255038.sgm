Couldn't one create a ring around a tube with coper wire for this
purpose?  I was thinking small wire wrapped around the tube about the
size of a wedding ring?

What is the best spot on the tube (just below the getter?)

Try a regular tube socket &amp; shield combo.

The danger in putting a "ring" of metal on a tube is that it will
heat/cool at a different rate than the rest of the tube. The tube is
glass, it may cause it to crack the glass due to the differential
temperatures.

Also, a solid ring will not work.

The position of the getter is irrelevant for this application.

If it is microphonics you are concerned about, then finding a point of
maximum excitation for the frequency of interest is required?

Otoh, if the excitation is air borne sound, then perhaop the lowly
socket &amp; shield combo are sufficient, and also consider isolation
mounting of the socket itself.

Decades ago, one of the electronics magazines suggested wrapping thick wire
solder around a microphonic tube.  Solder is less springy than copper and
better at damping vibration.  Whether it also contributed any shielding, I
don't know.

In order for the solder to actually absorb vibration, I would think it
would have to deform. I don't think that a vibrating tube is going to
be able to deform it, especially with thick solder. Even if it did, it
would basically only work once. (It's like the way cars are designed
where the frontend will crush to absorb an impact. The structure will
deform and absorb energy, but it doesn't rebound because it isn't
elastic, so it can only do it once.)

Anything you apply to the outside of the tube is really only going to
act on the outside (the glass envelope) anyway, and the parts that are
microphonic are on the inside.

In order to be of any use as a shield, it would have to be grounded.

It doesn't have to deform; it just has to be heavy, and soft enough to
couple well to the glass envelope. Its weight lowers the resonant
frequency of the tube, making it less likely that external disturbances
will vibrate the tube elements.

That wouldn't make it damp vibration though, and that's what the OP
was talking about.

The added weight would likely lower the resonant frequency of the
glass envelope, but will that also keep the internal elements from
being microphonic?

We're not talking about keeping the elements from being microphonic;
that's the job of the tube designer. We're talking about keeping the
vibrations from getting to the elements, and that's where the added
weight comes in. After all, you have to shake the envelope to have much
effect on the elements, and since they're small, they vibrate at a high
frequency. Making the tube effectively heavier "slows it down" so to
speak. Tube shields reduce microphonics in much the same way; they just
prevent the tube envelope from vibrating independently of the chassis.
