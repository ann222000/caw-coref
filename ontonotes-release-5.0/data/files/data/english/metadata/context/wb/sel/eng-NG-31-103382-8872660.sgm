as a seeker of knowledge tho with low 100 IQ, can you tell me why our
present day thinkers mix up the present day religious beliefs to
support or denounce the ultimate questions and answers? the universes
with us all exist now. or is this illusion? myth? in a life span of a
100 yrs is it poss for me to grope and know the ultimate? no. then why
am i grappling with all great thinkers philo-sophers who have their
own deductions?

Good question and one which I have been considering lately.  Their is
so much to know.  When have we learned enough?  I guess it depends on
the questions we are trying to answer in our lives.  How to live
better.  How to leave the world a better place than when we arrived.
My world is focused on system engineering, enterprise architecture,
cosmology and philosophy (epistemology).  Why bother knowing more than
is required to make a living?

Hello sir,

Maybe we need to know a lot about psychology for instance as well, in order
to understand traumatised people ? For me, that is also part of
epistemology, as we may be able to observe in some comments here on this
forum. So can we really ever know enough ? I do not think so. Everything
connects.

Cheers !

X Jan
