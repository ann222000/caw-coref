Illiad (Book VI)

&lt;&lt;Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted after [Bellerophon],
and would have had him lie with her in secret;
but Bellerophon was an honourable man and would not, so she told
lies about him to Proetus. 'Proetus,' said she, 'kill Bellerophon or
die, for he would have had converse with me against my will.' The king
was angered, but shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent him to
Lycia with lying letters of introduction, written on a folded tablet,
and containing much ill against the bearer. He bade Bellerophon
show these letters to his father-in-law, to the end that
he might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore went to Lycia.

When he reached the river XANTHUS, which is in Lycia, the king
received him with all goodwill, feasted him NINE DAYS,
but when rosy-fingered morning appeared upon the tenth day,
he questioned him and desired to see the letter.&gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Xanthus &amp; Gorgus, SON OF Midas the king, invited HOMER to compose
a epitaph for the tomb of their father on which was a BRONZE figure
of a maiden bewailing the death of Midas. He wrote the following lines:

`I am a maiden of BRONZE and sit upon the TOMB of Midas. While
WATER FLOWS, and tall trees put forth leaves, and rivers swell,
and the sea breaks on the shore; while the SUN rises and shines
and the bright moon also, EVER remaining on this mournful TOMB
I TELL THE PASSER-BY that Midas here lies buried.'&gt;&gt;

Book I : CHAP. II. _Joseph Andrews_ by Henry Fielding

MR. Joseph Andrews, the Hero of our ensuing History, was esteemed
to be the only SON OF Gaffar and Gammer Andrews, and Brother to
the illustrious Pamela. . . Whether he had any Ancestors before
this, we must leave to the Opinion of our curious READER,
finding nothing of sufficient Certainty to relie on.
However, we cannot omit inserting an Epitaph
which an ingenious Friend of ours hath communicated.

STAY Traveller, for underneath this Pew
LIES fast asleep that merry Man Andrew;
When the last Day's great SUN shall gild the Skies,
Then he shall from his TOMB get up and *R I S E*
Be merry while THOU CAN'ST:
for surely thou Shall shortly be as sad as he is now.
-------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;. . .For these verses they gave [Homer] a SILVER BOWL
which he dedicated to APOLLO at Delphi with this inscription:

`Lord PHOEBUS, I, Homer, have given you a noble gift for
the wisdom I have of you: do you EVER grant me renown.'&gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------------
_Of Deformity_ by Francis Bacon

&lt;&lt;DEFORMED persons are commonly even with nature; for as nature hath
done ill by them, so do they by nature; being for the most part (as
the Scripture saith) void of natural affection; and so they have their
revenge of nature. Certainly there is a consent, between the body and
the mind; and where nature erreth in the one, she ventureth in the
other. Ubi peccat in uno, periclitatur in altero. But because there is,
in man, an election touching the frame of his mind, and a necessity in
the frame of his body, the stars of natural inclination are sometimes
obscured, by the sun of discipline and virtue. Therefore it is good to
consider of deformity, not as a sign, which is more deceivable; but as a
cause, which seldom faileth of the effect. Whosoever hath anything fixed
in his person, that doth induce contempt, hath also a perpetual spur
in himself, to rescue and deliver himself from scorn. Therefore all
deformed persons, are extreme bold. First, as in their own defence, as
being exposed to scorn; but in process of time, by a general habit. Also
it stirreth in them industry, and especially of this kind, to watch and
observe the weakness of others, that they may have somewhat to repay.
Again, in their superiors, it QUENCHETH [SPENSE: Italian QUENCHed]
jealousy towards them, as persons that they think they may, at pleasure,
despise: and it layeth their competitors and emulators asleep; as never
believing they should be in possibility of advancement, till they see
them in possession. So that upon the matter, in a great wit, deformity
is an advantage to rising. Kings in ancient times (and at this present
in some countries) were wont to put great trust in eunuchs; because they
that are envious towards all are more obnoxious and officious, towards
one. But yet their trust towards them, hath rather been as to good
[Spies], and good WHISPERERS, than good magistrates and officers.
And much like is the reason of deformed persons. Still the ground is,
they will, if they be of spirit, seek to free themselves from scorn;
which must be either by virtue or malice; and therefore let it not
be marvelled, if sometimes they prove excellent persons; as was
Agesilaus, Zanger the son of Solyman, AEsop, Gasca, President of
Peru; and Socrates may go likewise amongst them; with others.&gt;&gt;

The Triple Tau is one of the most important symbols
of [R]oyal [A]rch [M]asonry

but where did it come from, and what does it mean?

It has been said that three Taus come together

to form the Triple Tau:

Others say the Triple Tau is originally
the coming together of a T &amp; H, meaning

c
or the Temple of Jerusalem.

Christians interpreted the symbol as &quot;Holiness supporting Trinity&quot;.
Royal Arch records dating from 1767 show this symbol.

In addition to meaning

[T]emplum [H]ierosolyma

it is also said to mean

&quot;Clavis ad Thesaurum&quot;
&quot;A key to the Treasure&quot;

&quot;Theca ubi res pretiosa&quot;

Ovid, Heroides V

The BEECH-TREES still hold my name with your carving,
And I read &quot;OENONE,&quot; written by your blade.
And as much as those trunks grow, so much MY NAME increases.
RISE UP, and grow straight with my glory!
Poplar, live, I pray, planted by the river bank
With, in your furrowed bark, this verse:

&quot;If PARIS can still draw breath when he has abandoned OENONE,
Then the waters of the XANTHUS shall FLOW back toward their source.&quot;

XANTHUS, make haste backward, and FLOWing waters return!
PARIS endures his desertion of OENONE!

Chapter 1 of A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers
by Henry David Thoreau

The XANTHUS or Scamander is not a mere dry channel and bed of
a mountain torrent, but fed by the EVER-FLOWing springs of FAME:

'And thou Simois, that as an arrowe, clere
Through Troy rennest, aie downward to the sea;'--

and I trust that I may be allowed to associate our muddy but
much abused Concord River with the most famous in history.

'Sure there are poets which did never dream
Upon PARNASSUS, nor did taste the stream
Of HELICON; we threfore may suppose
Those made not poets, but the poets those.'
