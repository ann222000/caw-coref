Recently, a friend of mine was hospitalized after a sudden paralysis
of the arm and leg which was found to be a stroke on his CAT scan.  He
is about my age and was previously healthy with no risk factors such
as high blood pressure, smoking or obesity.  Thankfully, he recovered
quickly and back to normal at home.

Why did he get a stroke? What is a stroke and how can it be prevented?

There are two kinds of stroke, the first kind is ischemic which means
the blood flow is blocked off by a clot or plug, and the second kind
is a hemorrhagic stroke which means a small crack in the artery leaks
blood into the surrounding brain. 731,000 of these strokes occur
annually in the United States.  Even though heart attack and stroke
really have the same cause which is atherosclerotic vascular disease,
they are considered two separate diseases.

Stroke prevention by the medical system usually consists of blood
thinners such as aspirin, coumadin, or anti-platelet drugs which
prevent clot formation.  These are usually started after the first
stroke in hopes of preventing a second stroke.

A more important preventive measure which your doctor will usually
neglect to inform you about is the role of Vitamin C in stroke
prevention.  Vitamin C is cheap, pennies a day, so there is no
financial incentive to recommend it.

Here are two of many recent studies published in the peer reviewed
medical literature showing Vitamin C is very beneficial in reducing
the risk of stroke.

This first study was carried out in rural Japan, and blood levels of
Vitamin C were measured  in  880 men and 1,241 women ages 40 and older
who were initially stroke-free.  During the 20-year observation
period, 196 strokes occurred, and the villagers in the highest
quartile of serum Vitamin C had 70 per cent fewer strokes. (1)

A second study done in Finland and published in Stroke in 2002 also
showed similar results. (2)  Researchers tested blood levels of
vitamin C in about 2,400 Finnish men aged 42 to 60 to see if blood
levels of vitamin C could be correlated with stroke risk. Results
showed men whose blood levels of vitamin C fell into the lowest
quarter had a 2.4 times greater risk of stroke than those in the
highest quarter. Men with high blood pressure or those who were
overweight had even higher risk if they also had low blood levels of
the vitamin, 2.6 and 2.7 times, respectively.

How does Vitamin C work to make our arteries stronger?  The arteries
are made of a connective tissue substance called Collagen, and vitamin
C is the key nutrient for collagen synthesis.

Now that you are convinced that Vitamin C is beneficial in preventing
stroke, perhaps you might think that we all get enough vitamin C in
our diets. Well, a new study published in the American Journal of
Public Health says otherwise. The study included 15,769 participants
ranging in age from 12 to 74 years and found a distressing 10 percent
of women and 14 percent of men to be deficient in Vitamin C.  (3)

How much Vitamin C is enough?

These are the different recommendations depending on the source:

Daily Vitamin C                 Source
60-95 mg                U.S. Government RDA
200 mg                  Levin/NIH
400 mg                  Linus Pauling Institute
2500 mg                 Hickey/Roberts
4000 mg                 Robert Cathcart MD III
6-12 g          Thomas E Levy, MD, PHD

All animals with the exception of primates (humans), the guinea pig
and the fruit bat make their own vitamin C from glucose.  We humans
lack the final enzyme step needed.  However, on an equivalent-weight
basis with animals that can synthesize their own vitamin C, healthy
adult humans would produce internally from 2 to 4 grams (2,000 to
4,000 milligrams) of vitamin C daily.

Primates such as gorillas which also cannot make their own vitamin C
consume approximately 3 to 4 grams of vitamin C daily (calculated on a
"human-weight basis").

Determining how much supplemental vitamin C will meet your individual
requirements is fairly easy using a tolerance-test technique developed
by Dr. Cathcart. (4)

The tolerance test starts with a dose of 2 grams of vitamin C per day.
Then, slowly increase your dose each day until you start experiencing
excess gas or loose bowels. At that point, your body isn't absorbing
or able to use that much, so you should scale back to the largest
amount that doesn't produce these symptoms.

Another problem:

The vitamin C at the health food store is only half real vitamin C.
There are two types of Vitamin C, the L isomer is biologically active,
and the R isomer is Not active.  The Vitamin C you buy at the health
food store is a mixture of half L and half R, so half of it is
biologically inactive!!!. (5)

To avoid the inactive Vitamin C problem, our office provides to all
our clients a 100% L isomer Vitamin C powder which is buffered to PH
neutral from Perque Vitamins. The cost is about 5 cents a day. In
terms of medical prevention bang for the buck, you can't beat it.
