Pretty much all of Jerry's &quot;book&quot; is plagiarized and so he's
basically totally incoherent about what's actually going on
with providing praise.

The praise functions as a distractor, much like a penny
can but a lot less spooky.  In a purely-positive, 100% clicker
training world you'd wait for the dog to stop what it was doing
and then reward it for stopping.

In the real world it would take months (if ever) to get
the dog to knock it off, and so you distract the dog and
reward it when its (quiet) attention is back on you.

I guess Jerry's &quot;book&quot; is okay, but because he didn't write
it and doesn't understand dog training he can't answer
questions and becomes extremely abusive if you ask them.

Just by way of a heads-up on that.

AS STATED in my manual the conditional reflex was
COINCIDENTALLY discovered by Pavlov when he was
using dogs as the basis for human psychological
behavioral EXXXPERIMENTS:

From: &quot;George von Hilsheimer, Ph.D.&quot; &lt;drv ... @mindspring.com&gt;
Subject: The Amazing Jerry's take on psychobabble
Date: Fri, 29 Jul 2005 12:13:44 -0400

You might improve the learning of folk who actually
live with and train dogs to do useful things if you
excluded everyone who uses psychobabble from your lists.

I recommend to all of you who wish to taste the flavor
of sensible animal behaviorists to read THE MISBEHAVIOR
OF ORGANISMS, Breland and Breland.

This married pair of psychologists began the long trail
of highly trained animals who are symbolized by Shamu
eating a mackrel from a girl's hand instead of eating
the much more tasty pretty girl who is exactly the size
of the natural food of killer whales, seals.  Yum!

The essay, by the way, is a chapter in B.F. Skinner's
summing up book, CUMULATIVE RECORD.  They include a
sentence which more or less says, &quot;unless you understand
the personal history of the particular animal, and the
history of this animal's species and group, the developmental
history of the animal, you cannot effectively train the animal.

Pigs root and hen's scratch, if you try to train hens without
scratching or pigs without scratching or pigeons without pecking,
you aren't going to have much success.

A conditional reflex is one which is learned, the original
primitive reflex occurs no matter what the history of the
animal, and is hard wired.  If you train the animal to respond,
say by ringing a bell immediately before turning on a bright
light, then you've taught the animal and made his native reflex
of pupil constriction conditional upon the ringing of a bell.

Thorndyke added some terminology to this kind of training
and insisted that when you train the animal to make gross
motor responses that this learning is &quot;instrumental&quot;, the
animal takes action and uses an instrument.

The Russian word translated as &quot;conditional&quot; in all other
contexts was mistranslated by Pavlov's American translator,
Horsley Gannt, as &quot;conditioned&quot; and so American psychology
went haring after phantasmagora.

The major theorists for the development of the language of
operant conditioning are Edward Thorndike, John Watson, and
B. F. Skinner. Their approach to behaviorism played a major
role in the development of American psychology.

They proposed that learning is the result of the application
of consequences; that is, learners begin to connect certain
responses with certain stimuli. This connection causes the
probability of the response to change (i.e., learning occurs.)

Thorndike labeled this type of learning instrumental. Using
consequences, he taught kittens to manipulate a latch (e.g.,
an instrument). Skinner renamed instrumental as &quot;operant&quot;
because in this learning, one is &quot;operating&quot; on, and is
influenced by, the environment. Where classical conditioning
illustrates S--&gt;R learning, operant conditioning is often
viewed as R--&gt;S learning since it is the consequence that
follows the response that influences whether the response
is likely or unlikely to occur again.

It is through operant conditioning that
voluntary responses are learned.

One should note that Russian Psychology did very well
without the operant language, and only pettifogging
university professors ought to worry about what kind
of label we attach to the learning.  Pfui!

Even Skinner understood this!

And please note if you saw the original movie, THE
MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, you saw a Chinese psychologist
who was based on Andrew Salter, CONDITIONED REFLEX
THERAPY.

Alas, Salter didn't have a Ph.D., but he basically rescued
us from the long Freudian nightmare and returned psychotherapy
to a scientific basis.  Alas, the 2nd movie didn't even cite
Salter as a source.  &quot;...all the highest nervous activity, as
it manifests itself in the conditional reflex, consists of a
continual change of these three fundamental processes --
excitation, inhibition and disinhibition.&quot;  Ivan P. Pavlov

George von Hilsheimer, Ph.D., F.R.S.H.

What's important is, &quot;does Shamu reliably eat
the fish and not the pretty girl?&quot;

RESPONSE to any stimulus. I never read any more

Date: Fri, 19 Aug 2005

Dear Jerry,  I paged through some of the &quot;dog business&quot;
and was astonished at the low quality of opinions arising
from professors of behavior analysis.

I had the very great privilege of meeting Sam Corson
(Pavlov's last Ph.D. student) and his dogs at Ohio
University.  I even got to spend a night at Sam's house.

There is no question but that you are a spiritual brother
to Corson and to Pavlov, both of whom knew that the dog's
great capacity for love was the key to shaping doggie behavior.

Paradoxical reward and paradoxical fixing of attention are
both well documented Pavlovian techniques.  Even so humorless
a chap as B.F. Skinner taught students like the Breland's whose
&quot;The Misbehavior of Organisms&quot; demonstrate the utility of your
methods and their deep roots in scientific (as opposed to
commercial) psychology.

No DanO. You can't say my methods are the same

PRAISE IN ADVANCE and PROLONGED NON PHYSICAL
PRAISE INSTANTLY following the brief variably

Konrad Lorenz's work and Nietzche's philosophy:

Jerry!

You helped me with my pal Dundee about a year ago
regarding submissive peeing.  Just wanted to let you
know he's doing great- he was &quot;cured&quot; in about 2 days
using your techniques!

He has since become the &quot;smartest dog in the world&quot;!
Once I stopped thinking like a human and got inside his
head, I can teach him ANYTHING, usually in a matter
of minutes.  Makes me look like an expert dog-trainer.

I rescued two strays last week, cleaned 'em up, wormed
'em, and am getting them their shots. Time to get inside
their heads and teach them to teach themselves how to
be good dogs!

Instead of feeling like &quot;training&quot; is a chore, I look
forward to working with these guys a couple times a day...

Although I don't follow your instructions &quot;to a T&quot;, I
learned from you to &quot;think like a dog&quot; and stimulate
their brain rather than beating ass or pinching, or any
of that nonsense.

I know damn well I would NOT be loyal to someone
who beat MY ass lol!

Well, just wanted to thank you for rattling the bushes
out there and teaching folks the RIGHT way to &quot;train&quot; dogs.

A horseman friend of mine uses very similar techniques
in training his horses- he calls it &quot;natural horsemanship&quot;.

He is hated by nearly all the local &quot;trainers&quot; yet somehow
he repeatedly wins at every show he attends. He rarely
shows any more, but goes now and then to rub their noses
in it (pun intended)...

Too cool....

Have a great holiday season and keep up the good work!

&quot;Linda&quot; &lt;llindaleedan ... @msn.com wrote in message
news:

I have been trying for the last 18 months to help
my dog who became fear aggressive at 18 months of
age.

I do not know what started the problem but he
became aggressive first with dogs and then began
lunging and snapping at people. Until this time
he loved everyone and could play with any dog.

He was well socialized and I took him with me
everywhere.

At 13 months he passed the Canine Good Citizens
Test except he could let me leave him. I had used
clicker training to teach him manners and tricks
but it was not working on his aggression problem.

I took him to vets who suggested a low protein
diet, trainers who charged $800 to only make him
worse.

They tried to use a prong collar and he froze,
urinated and tried to climb on my head to help
him. they then suggested a shock collar I knew
this approach was not working as he was becoming
more aggressive.

I took him to an animal behaviorist with Ph. D.
400 miles away who told me to &quot;KEEP HIM SAFE&quot;
and read a book on the fearful canine. I tried
another trainer who tried to use a nylon choke
collar but it only made him worse.

I read hundreds of books,&quot;CULTURE CLASH&quot;,
&quot;DOG ARE FROM NEPTUNE&quot;, &quot;THE OTHER
END OF THE LEASH&quot;, ETC looking for help.
We finally went to Purdue University Small
Animal Behavior Clinic and they said he had
fear aggression, punishment would not work,
use the gentle leader and when out walking
and he got stressed have the people stop until
he could get in control using treats, and work
on clicker training.

At that point I knew more about clicker training
and using the gentle leader than they did!

Nothing was working--he would not come when I
called him and would run away when I tried to
catch him. I was afraid to walk him even in the
neighborhood as we had become that &quot;mean dog and
women who hasn't trained her dog&quot;

I went to four trainers in both Michigan and
Florida who were trainer/specialists in
aggression and the last two were so afraid of
him they could not approach him. No one said I
should give up on him and kill him but they would
say &quot;You have to realize he is dangerous and you
are responsible for him.&quot;

*(You got LUCKY, Linda... They coulda got
Sunshine DEAD on us. Damned near did... too.)

As last resort I tried the internet again--I had
had on going discussions with trainers from
Triple Crown and Dr. Meister with out any
help-and I found the ad to Doggy Do Right and
messaged Jerry to ask if this might help my dog.

He said solving the aggression problem was EZ but
I could not believe him even when I downloaded
the manual.

The name of the method was right I was at my Wits
End. I had been working for 18 months!

Using the can sound three time he came, and
still comes from anywhere with the command-
&quot;comegoodboy&quot;.

Next I tried the can when walking him--when he
saw a dog three blocks away he went off-lunging
and snapping-I used the can sound and he looked
at me like uhn?

I used it three more times and we got to the
other dog--the looked at me wagging his tail-
-the other person looked at me like why are
shaking that can but just walked on by.

When ever I try to explain about the sound people
look at me like &quot;you must be out of your mind&quot;

The results can make a believer!!!

Three weeks since beginning the Wits End Training
Manual program I walked him without the gentle
leader in a busy shopping area with many dogs.

He just seemed to not notice any one.

When people talked to him or ask his name he
would look at then and wag his tail and let
then pet him.

I still can not believe the change in him--we
can now enjoy life out in public.

If I had not found the Wits End method I know
there was no hope for him and he would have
hurt someone Through all this he never growled
at me, guarded his toys or food or showed any
sign of aggression with me.

My goal is to get the message out to all dog
lovers that dogs can be trained fast, easily
and problems solved with out force, pain, food
or anything but sound and praise!!!!

I know most people would have given up on him a
long time ago but he was and is my life. Solving
the problem was EZ but only with the right
approach-sound and praise.

I know because I tried everything else and
nothing worked!!!

Thanks for writing--I would be happy to do almost
anything to get your approach out to dog owners as
I know it would save so many lives.  I know at times
I was so frustrated I thought of giving up on Sunshine
but of course I never would have but many people
would have.  The world just does not know you can
train a dog in just a few sessions and actually solve
problems.

We will be here until late April and we really have no
plans--just to enjoy the warmth and sun of Florida, so
any time you could meet us would be great.  I drive so
I would be happy to come to you anytime anywhere!

We went to Celebration today and two little poodles
got right into his face and he just sat there--I GOT a
little scared but he handled it just fine.--a couple of
times people would ask his name and want to pet
him and he just went to them tail wagging and rolled
over for them rub his tummy.

He really just is not concerned about people passing,
even those on rollerblades!  I have always used a
gentle leader in public but he spent most of time
rubbing his face on the grass--today I used his collar
and he was so much happier!!

Only problem is he will stop to smell and I can not get
stopped soon enough to keep the leash loose.  He never
pulled ahead of me but when he gets into smelling I
have a hard time getting him going--at times  I think
he could smell a blade of grass for 10 minutes.

I can never thank you enough for giving Sunshine back!!!!!

I wrote to Purdue and told them about him being able
to walk in a crowd with out the /gentle leader and not
having a problem with other people and dogs.

I told them their advice did not work. Their advice was
to use the gentle leader at all times and when he was
around people or dogs to have him sit and reward with
treats--one really good suggestions was to have people
coming toward us stop when he got stressed or aroused
and not move until we backed away-

- can you just see me yelling at people to stop on the
street until I get his attention with treats.

They also suggested the possibility of using drugs-
prozac-but thought he was too dangerous as the drug
would make him less fearful and then he might attack

The Amazing Puppy Wizard is the cognomen of a dog behaviorist,
Jerry Howe, of Orlando, Fl.  Howe's primary teaching is that
dogs deserve unconditional love, respect, and attention and
that by providing these emotional needs dogs will regulate
their own behavior.

Howe is bombastically antagonistic to rewarders, but he is
aggressively hostile to punishers - he refers antagonists
to B.F. Skinner, Mary Cover Jones, and J.B. Watson and
especially to Samuel A. Corson when they mistakenly annunciate
behavioral principles to support their use of punishment.

Punishment always deranges behavior, says Skinner,
Jones, Watson, Corson and Jerry Howe!

Howe developed a sonic device which calms dogs and has
been broadly tested in a wide range of different situations.
The present author is a Who's Who recognized psychologist
who was asked to evaluate Howe's device by a former student.

Howe provided the author with a device, without
charge, and said device worked as reported.

Then cross reference to Jerry Howe, etc.

Jerry, the difficulty with these ignorant dog molesters
is that they cannot read.  Negative reinforcement is no
response by the trainer.

There is positive reinforcement, an action which is followed
by an increase in the targetted behavior (usually called
&quot;reward&quot; which is precisely and technically a misnomer),
negative reinforcement is the absence of any response.

Negative means 'No'.

Skinner's last book, &quot;CUMULATIVE RECORD&quot; reviews this
thoroughly. http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/proj/nru/nr.html

Negative reinforcement is stopping an aversive reinforcement
according to this author.   Read it, they have a sense of humor!

There are four forms of systematic reinforcement:

do nothing (negative reinforcement)

reward the behavior (positive reinforcement)

punish the behavior (aversive reinforcement)
after habituating the subject to punishment,

stop punishing (relief of aversion, which is negative reinforcement).

Logically, failing to reward after habituating a reward
is also negative reinforcement.  Actually intermittent
rewards work better than consistent, invariable rewards,
so there is actually another two categories.  Invariable
reinforcement and random reinforcement (on varying schedules).

Punishment is AVERSIVE REINFORCEMENT.

Actions which cause the animal being trained to avoid,
avert, cringe away from. Pavlovians always responded
to American psychologist's inability to reproduce Pavlov's
results with dogs with the comment, &quot;American's don't LOVE
their dogs&quot;.  If you ever observed a Russian psychologist
working with a dog, you'd instantly see the difference.

American psychologists were wooden, robot-like,
wanted to be &quot;scientific&quot;.

This meant to them that they should display no
affection, or any other emotion with the subjects.

When a Pavlovian dog started to misbehave or fail to respond,
doggie was taken out of the equipment, and taken home for a
loving vacation, with much TLC.  Sam Corson, Pavlov's last
student, demonstrated the same relationships at Ohio State.

Interestingly the first page of results for Sam Corson,
dog behaviorist is loaded with Jerry Howe quoting Dr. Von.
heh heh heh

Dr. Von

Oh, by the way, you once had a pompous fellow say that
Dr. Von was a figment of your imagination.  I don't

Leah: &gt; How in the world does the dog learn *not* to
&gt; do something by getting praised for doing it?
&gt;
&gt; IMHO, it's a silly idea.

No doubt.  I was more than a little perplexed myself, the
first time I tried it (with the chicken breast), but by
then I'd already come to the conclusion that almost everything
we think we know about dogs is wrong.

Praise is one of things.

So if it's silly, and if praise really works for the reasons
you *think* it does, why did it work with the chicken breast
example?  (Hint: I already explained it in a way that gibes,
on some level, with operant conditioning.)

leah: &gt; I can't fathom how praising them for an inappropriate
&gt; behavior could teach them anything.

Kelley: As I said, that's because praise is one of the most
misunderstood tools in dog training.  It may pain you to know
this but Jerry Howe is actually right (mostly) about how praise
works.

Since most of you have him filtered (and not without reason)
it might be helpful to read what he actually has to say,
without all the craziness mixed in.  To wit:

Howe: &quot;While we do want to interrupt undesirable behaviors,
we do not want to totally prevent or distract the dog
from the opportunity to attempt the behavior once again.&quot;

&quot;We want him to be able to resume THINKING of the behavior
in order to totally and permanently extinguish it. That will
usually happen in about four repetitions of the technique.&quot;

&quot;We want to tempt and distract and praise each thought
of the behavior till it's no longer thought of due to
non fulfillment through repetition of distraction and praise.&quot;

&quot;Most people try to prevent the behavior which means the
desire for that action will remain in the dogs repertoire,
only to occur at a less predictable and convenient time...&quot;

&lt;snip&gt;

&quot;Instantly correcting a behavior without addressing
it fully keeps that behavior available and the process
continues&quot;

Kelley: The only thing Jerry has wrong in this exlanation is
in saying that the dog has an &quot;idea&quot; or a &quot;thought&quot; about the
behavior.

I prefer to put it in simpler terms, that the dog has an impulse
to produce the behavior.  Just correcting the impulse doesn't get
rid of it, and in many cases, makes it that much stronger.

Praise is used to change the impulse to produce the unwanted
behavior into an impulse to reference the one doing the praise
and then to look to him or her for a cue as to what to do next.

I'm not 100% sure about the chronology, but Jerry may have
learned this from a case history detailed in my booklet &quot;No
Bad Dogs, Just Bad Trainers&quot;.

In that instance a dog was conditioned to turn the behavior
of barking every time the phone rang, into a completely new
behavior: the ringing of the telephone became a cue for him
to find a toy and take it to his bed and chew on it.

The chief compononent of my training strategy was to have
his ower immediately praise the dog for barking when the
phone rang, instead of correcting him, which had no effect
(he was a Jack Russell terrier.)

Then she jumped up, grabbed a toy, teased the dog with it,
played a bit of tug, then told him to take it to his bed.

Then she answered the phone.  (The whole procedure only
took four or five rings so it's not like she was prevented
from taking calls during the process, though she did put
up a fuss when I told her what she had to do.)  Within
three days the barking behavior had been replaced with
the finding a toy behavior.

One other thing: in this case I think it was important to
know the dog's temperament and WHY he was barking at the
phone.  The actual mechanics of he strategy were specifically
designed for that particular dog, though the underlying reason
for it and its effectiveness would be the same in other cases.

Here's more from that madcap Jerry Howe: &quot;HOWE COME PRAISE WORKS?

&quot;Every time your dog makes even the briefest eye contact
[with you], even a fleeting glance out of the corner of
his eye, THAT REQUIRES praise.&quot;

&quot;Not too long [a time praising him], no staring,
just a smile and a &quot;Good Boy, Nice Dog.&quot;

&quot;Pretty soon, every time you say Good Boy, he'll be looking
right at you. And when you say Nice Dog, he won't be able
to think of ANYTHING ELSE but YOU.&quot;

Maybe that's HOWE COME PRAISE WORKS?

Kelley: There's a bit more to it, of course, and that's the
fact that the common ideas about praise come, in some form
or another, from the ideas that a dog will adjust his behavior
to satisfy his supposed instinct to fit into a social hierarchy,
or to please his owner.

These ideas are false.  Due to the way the canine prey drive
evolved to enable dogs and wolves to hunt large prey by working
together in a spirit of group cooperation, dogs come genetically
programmed with a desire to work in harmony toward a common purpose.

Praise both stimulates and satisfies that genetic need.

Diane: &gt; The fact that you thought this was a good example
&gt; without understanding why it was not speaks volumes.
&gt; 1. She had no idea that you were praising her for
&gt; being ahead.  2. Since you allowed her to come back
&gt; the praise must not have been for being ahead. 3.
&gt; Ergo you did not reinforce the behavior of staying ahead.

All I can say is you have got the strangest way of looking at this.

First you seem to think that dogs have &quot;ideas&quot; about
what they're being praised for.  They don't.  They
just respond to things through their emotions.

Second, I didn't &quot;allow&quot; anything.  The point is most people
think that praising a behavior while it's happening reinforces
the behavior that immediately preceded the reinforcement.

I simply pointed to an example of how praising a
behavior doesn't follow that model of learning.

I wasn't trying to teach the dog anything to do in this example:
to stay ahead *or*to come back to me.  I was just pointing out a
flaw in the basic logic about praise that causes most people to
respond in a knee-jerk fashion to the idea that praise can
sometimes be used to correct a behavior.

You took that to a completely strange and irrelevant level by
turning it into another pissing contest about how hard it is
to train a dog to stay ahead of you for an obedience trial.

Who cares?

Diane: &gt; This is a good example of why trying to do more complicated
&gt; tasks than are typiucal in pet training would be so useful
&gt; to you in learning.
&gt;
&gt; When the tasks are set for you and the standards aren't
&gt; your own they are much more challenging to achieve.

The only thing I'm trying to do here is illustrate
that praise isn't what most people think it is.

The situations I've described are not necessarily a standard
part of my training practices, and as far as the particular
example of the dog walking ahead is concerned, it has no
practical purpose in training, except maybe to get the dog
to enjoy responding to you and reference you over the environment.

And may I just say to you and KBrown and others: I'm sorry,
but I think making a pissing contest out of who's won what
titles in what obedience trials as opposed to being &quot;just
a pet dog&quot; trainer is a crock of . . . well, you know what.

Teaching owners and puppies how to live a happy life together
and rehabiliting dogs with wounded emotions is a much higher
calling than earning titles in *anything*.

The only standard I'm concerned with is animal happiness.

If that's too low a standard for you -
- well, *that* speaks volumes about you.

Anybody out there who trains circus dogs?

You want to take me on next? (And don't get me started on
how *humane* it is to train dolphins to do tricks in a
little tank.)

Leah: &gt; I did try to get my head around your theories, but I
&gt; can't buy them. praise *reinforces* the dog's behavior

I'll give you an easier example: say you're walking through
the park with your dog.  She starts walking a little ahead
of you but not isn't intensely focused on something in the
environment, she's just a little restless to move ahead.

You praise her entususiastically and she turns and comes
back to your side.  If praise were only a reinforcer,
praising her for moving ahead of you would have made her
feel that *that* behavior was good and reinforced it, right?

She would have been more likely to
stay in front of you than come back.

So in this example how and why did praise have the
opposite effect and *change* the behavior rather
than reinforce it?

Leah: &gt; Coincidence.

If it were just one case, yes.  But I've used it consistently
in this manner, with a lot of different dogs, so &quot;coincidence&quot;
doesn't explain it.

Leah: &gt; I've seen it proven too many times that praise
&gt; *reinforces* the dog's behavior.

Me too.  I'm not saying that it *can't* be used as a reinforcer.
It can and should.  But how and why, exacly, does it &quot;reinforce&quot;
a behavior?

And why can it consistently be used to do *both* a
reinforcement and a correction (depending on the situation)?

Because the conventional understanding
of how and why praise works is wrong.

Leah: &gt; If a dog has something in his mouth he shouldn't,
&gt; praise tells him it's okay to have it.

Is that *really* what's going on?  If so why can it have
the exact opposite effect and motivate the dog to give up
the object?  What, exactly, happens to the dog's emotions
when you praise him?

Does it really make him &quot;think&quot; or feel that what he's
doing is right or good?  Or is something else going on
that you haven't considered?

Oh, but there's plenty about praising unwanted behavior
in order to extinguish it in Jerry Howe's manual, as well
as in most of his posts.

He gives precise indications of how to do it, step by step.
I can well understand that what he says about the regular
posters here is not pleasant to hear, but can't one see the
merits of the method only because one detested its author?

Also, in what Lee is concerned, he gave a few very interesting
examples that went almost without comment - the few posters who
cared to respond did so only to ridicule what - in their own
words - they had failed to understand.

And that was well before Lee mentioned the &quot;getting paid&quot; thing,
so it wasn't in response to it. Like the reaction to Lee's telling
about how he had dealt with a very aggressive Rottie. Did you see
that post? What do you think about such an approach to dealing
with aggression?

Perhaps. But for me, who am not a trainer, the practical
aspects of dealing with a dog, the way to figure out what's
in the critter's mind, are more interesting than the purely
theoretical aspects. In the end, what we want is to understand
the animal, don't we? Perhaps there are more than one possible
theoretical explanation, but that which matters is the one that
allows to develop a method that always works, doesn't it?

That was part of my initial impulse when I praised Fred after

out that very little of what passes for &quot;knowledge&quot; in the

Leah: &gt; I think you're being too liberal with assigning
&gt; &quot;emotional tension&quot; to every behavior.  A dog
&gt; doesn't counter-surf because he's stressed.  He
&gt; does it because he knows there are good things
&gt; on the counter.

Why would a properly-fed, emotionally balanced dog need
to eat anything more than what's in his bowl every day?

Ever look at statistics on how many people in this country
re overweight?  Is it because they're not getting enough
to eat?

No, they're eating to reduce emotional stress.

Eating more than you need is an unnatural behavior for
an animal, *any* animal, unless there's an underlying
psychological or physiological imbalance of some sort.

You mean on accHOWENTA you found some guy with a
Ph.D. who tells you sumpthin similar and you think
it's all the same same, DanO? Dr. Larry Male wrote
THIS several months AFTER he'd talked to Dr. Miller:

Dr. Larry Male a.k.a. TooCool wrote in
Subject: &quot;Learning Theory&quot; - An INSULT To Canines:

In regard to Dr Dare Miller, I am surprised at your
ignorance of him. He is a famous ethologist who
specializes in canine behavior. He trained dogs
instantly on live television with Art Linkletter,
Dick Cavett, Johnny Carson, Merve Griffin, Mike
Douglas, Barbara Walters, To Tell the Truth, Betty
White's Pet Set, Ralph Story on AM America, Friends
of Man, ABC, NBC, CBS TV News, etc. He is author
of the &quot;The Secret of Canine Communication&quot;, 1966
which is a textbook for veterinarians and others
interested in the etiology of canine behavior. He
was a pioneer in non-force training methods.

His methods employed sound distraction with praise
coupled with an ethologist's intimate knowledge of
canine behavior. His system for raising and training
dogs was designed to cater to a dog's ability to think.

His system of training is very, very similar to The
Puppy Wizard's Wits' End Training Method which
I wholeheartedly support.

===============

From: TooCool (larrym ... @hotmail.com)
The Puppy Wizard's Wits End Training Method

I have studied canine behavior and dog training for
years. I have a huge library that covers every system
of training.

The Puppy Wizard's (Jerry Howe's) Wits' End Training
Method is by far the most scientific, the most advanced,
the kindest, the quickest and the most effective training
method yet discovered.

It is not an assortment of training tips and tricks; it is
a logically consistent system. Every behavior problem
and every obedience skill is treated in the same logically
consistent manner.

Please study his manual carefully. Please endeavor to
understand the basis of his system and please follow
his directions exactly. His manual is a masterpiece.
It is dense with theory, with explanation, with detailed
descriptions about why behavior problems occur and
how their solution should be approached.

One should not pick and choose from among his methods
based upon what you personally like or dislike. His is
not a bag of tricks but a complete and integrated system
for not only training a dog but for raising a loving companion.

When I once said to Jerry that his system creates for
you the dog of your dreams, his response was that it
produces for your dog the owner of his dreams.

You see, Jerry has discovered that if you are gentle
with your dog then he will be gentle with you, if you
praise your dog every time he looks at you, then you
will become the center of your dogs world, if you use
Jerry's sound distraction with praise, then it takes
just minutes-sometimes merely seconds-to train your
dog to not misbehave (even in your absence) (Just 15
seconds this morning to train my 10 week old puppy to
lie quietly and let me clip his nails).

Using Jerry's scientific method (sound distraction /
praise / alteration / variation) it takes just minutes
to train you dog to respond to your commands.

What a pleasure it was for me to see my 6 week old
puppy running as fast has his wobbly little legs would
carry him in response to my recall command-and he
comes running every time I call no matter where we are
or what he is doing.

At ten weeks old now, my puppy never strains upon
his leash thanks to Jerry's hot &amp; cold exercises and
his Family Pack Leadership exercises.

Jerry has discovered that if you scold your dog, if you
scream at him, if you intimidate him, if you hurt him,
if you force him then his natural response is to oppose
you.

Is Jerry a nut?

It doesn't make any difference to me whether he is or not.
It is a logical fallacy to judge a person's ideas based
upon their personality. As far as dogs are concerned, Jerry
wears his heart upon his sleeve. It touches him deeply when
he hears of trainers forcing, intimidating, scolding or
hurting dogs.

More than that, he knows that force is not effective
and that it will certainly lead to behavior problems;
sometime problems so severe that people put their
dogs down because of those problems.

I believe that it is natural for humans to want to control
their dog by force. Jerry knows this too. We have all been
at our wits' end, haven't we?

Dogs have a natural tendency to mimic. In scientific
literature it is referred to allelomimetic behavior. Dogs
respond in like kind to force; they respond in like kind
to praise.

Don't bribe your dog with treats; give him what he
wants most-your kind attention. Give him your praise.
You will be astonished at how your dog 's anxiety will
dissipate and how their behavior problems will dissipate
along with their anxiety.

Treat Jerry Howe's (The Puppy Wizard) Wits' End
Training Method as a scientific principle just as you
would the law of gravity and you will have astounding
success.

Dog behavior is just as scientific as is gravity.

If you follow Jerry's puppy rules you will get a sweet
little Magwai; if you don't you will surely get a little
gremlin (anyone see The Gremlins?).

Here's Dr. Larry Male writing to Dr. Miller as
posted on his website PRYOR to studying my manual:

Dr. Larry Male (a.k.a. TooCool) ruminates
on Dog Behavior and Dog Training

Dr. Larry Male, Engineer, Scientist and
Mathematician, writes to Dr. Miller about
his dog Duke, the importance of DOG-MASTER®,
and his opinion on other dog &quot;training&quot; methods.

Dear Dr. Miller,

It was such a pleasure for me to talk with
you on the phone this morning.

I never did see your television appearances
although they were well within my era. I think
that I am perhaps 15 years your junior. I wish
I had seen them though.

It was a little ad in Dog Fancy, I think, that
I initially responded to back in 1992. I remember
that the wording seemed to be a bit like a snake
oil salesman, e.g., miraculous, magic learning
sound etc. But at that time, I was investigating
different dog training techniques and I could
easily afford a stamp to find out. But when I
received your literature, I immediately grasped
that this was important and scientific.

I already had my Golden when I received my DOG
MASTER kit and he was perhaps 2 years old at the
time. I had tried my best to train him, using the
choke chain dog training class once a week. Oh, I
should mention that I am currently a software
engineer, but I have a master's in zoology and a
doctorate in mathematics and biometrics.

Anyway, when I received your DOG MASTER System
book I was capable of understanding the magnitude
of your accomplishment.

I had such a great and immediate success that I dropped
out of the dog training class. For 9 more years my Duke
continued to learn more and more and more. He loved to
learn and to show off what he had learned. People were
so amazed at his behavior that they could not believe it.

He responded to complex commands, within
sentences spoken in a normal tone of voice.
To those watching, he must have seemed almost
human. His eyes were always upon me.

I remember that he would lie on the floor watching
me for hours. I could give him subtle hand signals
with my finger to make him sit up, lie down, stand,
stay etc. As he learned, I begin to make the hand
signals less and less obvious. And he learned to
respond to whisper commands. Oh, it was so much
fun and rewarding.

It has been two years now since Duke passed on
and now I have decided to get a Pembroke Welch
Corgi. I have been rereading the DOG MASTER
System book. My poor little book is falling apart
now. But as I reread I begin to realize how much
more effective I could have been if I had followed
your directions more closely.

How much better it will be for me now, to study
and to practice before I get my puppy. When you
already have your dog, you are so anxious to try
the DOG MASTER, that you don't take the time to
grasp the importance of each element of your system.

As I now reread your book, I think to myself,
&quot;How was he able to develop this complex system?&quot;
But each of your directions is supported by an
analysis of dog behavior. These explanations are
so important to me. A human mind requires those
explanations in order to apply the DOG MASTER
System intelligently.

I have purchased a number of top books on clicker
training (operant conditioning). This is the current
rage in dog training. But these authors freely admit
in their books that they no answers for dog behavior
problems.

They don't know how to prevent them or cure them.
They don't seem to know how to housetrain a dog.
Everyday I see dogs walking their owners (dragging
them forward and backwards through the park). The
owners plead and yell and tackle and treat and give
up in frustration.

Their only consolation is that everyone else's
dog behaves the same. I feel so sorry for everyone.

I know that there exists a training system that will
produce a dream dog, but it isn't advertised or
available. The DOG MASTER System is so vastly
superior to any other alternative that I experience
a feeling of great loss that it isn't readily available.

You know, instead of attending dog training classes
before or at least when they get their puppy.

Teach them about dog behavior and show them how
to use DOG MASTER; stress how important it is
to use it precisely according to the directions.

Tell them that they might as well throw it in
the trash if they don't intend to use it properly.
I think that it would be so much easier to grasp
in a good video production. Then you could watch
it over and over. Hey, don't we all need that
timing, rhythm and repetition to learn?

(... and so on....)

Sincerely,

Larry M. Male

My dogs (especially Clyde) are pretty sensitive, too, but
the sound I use is not something very loud or startling.
I rarely need to use a louder sound than a clap of my hands -
just enough to distract them for a second, so that they look
at me, and at that moment I start to praise, and I praise for
as long as their eyes are on me.

Then, if they start doing again whatever they were doing,
I distract them again, trying to make the sound come from
a different direction, just as Jerry says in his manual.

They look at me again, and I praise them, again, for as long
as they are looking. I rarely need to distract them more than
twice, before they give up the undesired behavior and walk away,
go to sleep or do something else which is acceptable to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Perhaps you could use something different as a distraction?

I remember reading that someone in this group was using a
bouncing ball, or something like that, to the same purpose.

How did you do, to make Khan &quot;bomb proof&quot;? I wish I could do
the same with Bonnie, who is afraid of thunder, firecrackers
and gunshots. Interesting that other loud sounds have no effect
on her, and she's totally indifferent to storms on TV, no matter
how loud the volume is.

He never says that the sound should be startling, much less
traumatizing. The way I understand it, all you have to do is
praise as you use the sound, and the dog won't perceive it
as threatening.

After all, there are lots of louder sounds in the environment
(and Jerry does recommend making use of them, if they happen
at the right time, from the right direction). The idea is just
to DISTRACT the dog, so that he looks at you and you PRAISE him.

Read the manual, everything is there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In certain circumstances, when it's used as classical

&gt; has to be more rewarding to the dog than the behavior,
&gt; enough so that it distracts him from it, and works best
&gt; if it's given *before* the behavior is in gear.
&gt; For example, if he's going after something on the ground,
&gt; you want to distract him before he actually puts it in his
&gt; mouth.  If it's yummy enough, he'll wag his tail at your
&gt; praise while he munches on it, and be reinforced that it's
&gt; okay for him to do it.
">

I say, &quot;Drop it, Clyde, good boy! What a GOOD BOY you are!&quot;
And he drops it. True, not always - because I'm not yet doing
it as Jerry recommends - my human nature getting in the way. :-)

So sometimes I just open his mouth and take the thing out
of his mouth myself. Clyde has no problem with that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Repeated enough times in a way that distracts him before
&gt; engaging in the behavior, the dog begins to associate the
&gt; *thought* of the behavior with your praise.  So instead of
&gt; engaging in it, when he thinks about it he automatically
&gt; comes to you.
">

Actually, I distract him with a sound (often a clap of my
hands) and then he looks at me and I praise him. I praise
him for as long as he looks at me. If he resumes the behavior,
I distract him again, with a sound coming from a different
direction - and I praise him, until he either goes back to
whatever he was doing, or does something else. If he goes
back to the undesired behavior, I repeat the procedure, as
above - until he stops and does something acceptable, instead.

It's really simple - and it works. :-)

Diane S.: &gt; There are multiple approaches to teaching people,
&gt; and some will work better than others for any
&gt; given person.

Dogs aren't people.  Human beings have far different cognitive
abilities and are able to grasp information via concepts, symbols,
language, etc. But to some extent, even with human beings, the
underlying learning process is always the same, no matter what
approach you take.

Diane S.: &gt; Ditto for dog training. No failure nor flaw of
&gt; method is involved - that's just acceptance of
&gt; reality.

First of all, I didn't say that there was a flaw in the method,
though anyone is welcome to make that leap.  I said there was a
flaw in the underlying philosophy and its model of learning.

And it's funny that you believe that no one besides me (and
others like me) think there's a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; philosophy
of learning, because according to operant conditioning all
behavior is learned through a process of reinforcement.

Tell a die-hard o.p. person that all dogs learn differently.

&quot;Nope,&quot; they'll say, &quot;it's all about reinforcement.&quot;

And according to the alpha theory all dogs learn to adjust
their behavior in respect to their ranking in the social
hierearchy, and if they don't learn they need to be made
aware of your higher position, etc.

Do these approaches to training work
some of the time (approximately 40%)?

Yes, but that's because roughly 40% of all dogs are adaptable
enough to supply the missing piece of the puzzle themselves.

What's the missing piece?

Finding a way to reduce emotional tension.

You can look at this through an operant conditioning lens
and say, &quot;Well, if that's really the case, then the dog is
learning due to reinforcement, because reducing emotional
tension would provide the dog with a positive experience,
in other words, reinforcement.&quot;

An alpha theorist would tell you that a dog feels less
emotional tension when he knows his place in the pack's
social structure, etc.  But the underlying principle -
- that dogs learn through their emotions -- is always
the same, no matter what form of training is used.

My point is that it's better to know how learning really
takes place and approach it from that angle than to go
about it in a hit-and-miss manner, using various philosophical
approaches that don't give you an accurate picture of what's
taking place when a behavior is learned.

Thanks Jerry,

I enjoyed the scientific discussion debunking
operant conditioning for teaching thinking animals.
Humans think by forming concepts. All of their
knowledge is held as a hierarchy of concepts
(more complex concepts defined in terms of
simpler ones). In my mind, to treat such a being
as a B. F. Skinner robot is criminal.

I don't believe that dogs hold their knowledge
as concepts as do humans but their ability to
think is unquestionable.

Operant conditioning doesn't utilize an animal's
ability to think. When you show a dog what you
want them to do, then they are able to grasp the
problem; they are able to think about it and to
integrate possible solutions into their mind.

But with operant conditioning a trainer is actually
hiding the problem to be solved from the animal.

For example, it is good for your dog's attention to
be upon you. When heeling, he will notice your
movements, your subtle hand signals, your facial
expressions and he will immediately sense your
next command. But the clicker trainers have forgotten
the reasons why a dog's attention should be upon you.

So they condition a dog to unnaturally cock his head
to stare upward at you. The dog doesn't appreciate
the meaning of this and neither does the trainer. Since
this unnatural behavior is prized in the obedience ring,
the clicker trainers are motivated to condition it.

Don't you think that the &quot;high five&quot; hand shake that
clicker trainers use to motivate novices looks like a
Nazi salute (an unthinking reflex). It is not at all
like a warm hand shake from a loving companion, is it?

Some of your testimonials bring tears to my eyes. I
love to see how some &quot;thinking&quot; people appreciate
your methods.

Jerry is not God and his manual is not the Bible.

His advice could be subject to an empirical analysis.

I doubt any major publishing house
would distribute Jerry's manual
because it is so verbose, so here
you find Jerry giving it away.

There is some wisdom in his manual but IMHO
there is even more wisdom in clicker training
approaches which are positive and though they
use food, food need not always be presented.

My favorite video, so far, is Karen Pryor's
_Clicker Magic_.

*(karen MURDERED her own DEAD KAT On AccHOWENTA
she COULDN'T CLICKER TRAIN IT not to shit an piss

Perhaps you can view it through your public library.

*(You think karen got a video of herself
MURDERIN her own DEAD KAT she COULDN'T TRAIN?)

The major pet supply retailers sell clickers
for about $2.

*(INDEED? You can get empty soda cans FOR FREE
an put a couple pebbles in it for NUTHIN.)

Also, try a keyword search with &quot;clicker training&quot;
at www.google.com as well as &quot;Jerry Howe&quot; or the
name of his method.

Then ask yourself this question:

Why is there so much interest in &quot;clicker training&quot;
and so little interest in Jerry's method?

Subject: one day

I started some of the simple techniques in
Jerrys manual today.

The family pack exercise.... come command.....
that's all so far though.

I did get the proper equipment as well.
20 foot leash, cans with pennies partially
crushed, flat collar, etc.

I have also stopped any negative reinforcment
such as loud &quot;No&quot; and &quot;Bad girl Sonique!&quot;
(Sonique is my Jack russell) and holding her
back, which I normally MUST do or she'll jump
and nip sometimes, but always jumping and barking.

Already tonight some has started working.
When someone came to the door, Sonique
went nuts as usual.

I said &quot;Thank you Sonique!&quot;
&quot;It's o.k. girl, thank you!&quot;

And we got a total of about 6 barks and then
no jumping on guests, no biting, growling
or the worst, the continued barking she
normally does.

She accepted my praise, and trooted around,
still excited over guests, but she was WAY
more under control.

Even my roomates noticed this.

She repeated this same thing
without all her normal fuss later
when another two friends came over.

So I do need more time, going to keep with it
another day, another month whatever until I
know I am getting results, although I must say,
so far I am impressed with my dog.

She really responds to praise better than
she ever has responded to treats as distraction
from the guests and doorbell, or me yelling
&quot;bad girl! go away now! shoosh up!&quot; all the time.

I am also verbally praising her everytime
she makes eye contact with me. so hopefully
things will continue going well!-

Hello Marshall,

The way I view it from my observation of how
my dogs react is that the distraction interrupts
the dogs thought, not for good or bad, just
interrupts, the dog is therefore distracted for
a second and then will either continue the
behaviour or do something else.

The praise reassures the dog that the sound
distraction is not a threat or punishment,
however if everytime the dog resumes a
particular behaviour it's distracted immediately
(and praised immediately for reassurance) then
it quickly decides this behaviour is not fulfilling
and it ceases.

A dog will offer another behaviour in it's place
and if that is acceptable to us then we let it be
otherwise the distraction continues until a suitable
alternate behaviour is offered.

One example, Sam used to jump up on me
when I arrived home, I would shake can to
distract him right at the moment he was
about to jump up, after about 4 repetitions
he tried sitting and offering me his paw, of
course this was fine so I let it be.

While the concept of shake cans is not new,
I haven't read any other advice that says to
praise immediately regardless of what the dog
does next (the common advice is to praise once
the dog is doing a desired behaviour or at least
stopped the unwanted behaviour), this is unique
to Jerry (and Marilyn) and from my own experiences
is an important part of the process.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thanks Paul! He does recommend praising
&gt; a dog for barking, but he appears to recognize
&gt; that this may not work and so distraction
&gt; is recommended as a back up procedure:
&gt; There really is NOTHING new about the advice above!

&gt; Hi Lynn,

&gt; When I read that section of Jerry's Manual,

&gt; &quot;What???? PRAISE her for barking?&quot; It sounded

&gt; Next time she went nuts at a person walking by

Could you be so kind as to post here the
section from Jerry's manual where he
writes that you should JUST praise the
dog when it barks?????????

As I recall, I thought he first advocates
distracting the dog from barking, with keys
or the soft sound of pennies in a can, before
praising.

Perhaps you can tutor me regarding
Jerry's system.

Thanks in advance!

Tracy,

What worked for me, in just one storm,
was to praise the dog after each clap
of thunder, telling him he's a Good Dog!

This is an almost 13 year old Doberman, BTW.

The next time it thundered, he did not even
react at all--you could not tell it was the
same dog as before.

There was more thunder just the other day,
and same thing, nada, nothing, zilch, no
cowering, whimpering, trying to hide at all,
it was that simple.

I got this idea from Jerry Howe, who might seem
to be a &quot;wild and crazy&quot; character, but his non-
abusive way of handling dogs WORKS.

Wonderfully.

Praise.

It's that simple.

A Professor and a Veterinarian compliment Dr. Miller

Correspondence from two professionals
in field of canine studies...

Dear Dr. Miller:

Sometime ago you sent me a complimentary copy of
your book &quot;The Secret of Canine Communication.&quot;
This book has been used extensively in the School
of Veterinary Medicine both by the faculty and the
student body. They have found this a very useful
text and have had much benefit from the opportunity
to review the fine work which you have done.

I do appreciate your kindness in sending me this
book. I will see that it is placed in our Veterinary
Medical Library for the full use of the faculty
and the student body of the school. I am sure that
many of the students will be interested in placing
order for copies of this book as they engage in the
practice of canine medicine.

Sincerely,

Wm. E. Jennings, Professor

Auburn University

School of Veterinary Medicine

-o-

Dear Dr. Miller:

The following review has been submitted to
New York City Veterinarian and should be
published in due course, at the discretion
of the Executive Editor:

**********

This is the unique training manual based upon
subliminal suggestion by means of a special
chain that is so constructed that when it is
shaken or thrown it takes advantage of certain
harmonic attributions of the dog, and training
takes place without leash restraint by means
of applying fundamental principles of conditioned
reflex psychology.

Apparent dramatic results have been obtained with
this approach to training, and it seems to render
more conventional approaches obsolete.

The reader who seeks a practical and thorough
lesson in applied canine psychology can learn
a great deal from the careful perusal of this
popularly written manual.

**********

So there you are. I trust it may be helpful to you.

Respectfully yours,

A. Barton, D.V.M.

Book Editor

Subject: Dog Behavior Problems

What causes dog behavior problems? Well, first
of all, a dog doesn't know that his behavior is
a problem until you tell him so. But if you
address his behavior negatively then your dog
will tend to repeat it-that is just the nature
of dogs.

Unfortunately for us humans, our natural tendency
is to rebel with emotional outburst, intimidation
or force when our dog's behavior annoys us. But
we must bite our tongue and praise our dog instead.

You do not believe that your dog is out to get
your goat? Just begin to carefully analyze his
behavior. Take for instance the case of the
Mozart hating dog.

Whoever heard of such a thing?  How could such a
bizarre behavior begin and become established? Who
knows for sure, but it could easily happen like this.
You are relaxing listening to your favorite Mozart
piece and your dog begins to play rowdily-he is
trying to attract your attention-but his commotion
annoys you.

You get upset and yell at him to shut-up.

Dogs are very sensitive to your emotions-positive
emotions calm them-negative emotions upset them.
But your negative attention has just given your
dog a lesson on how to get your attention.

How many times do think that it will take to make
this behavior automatic? Once, maybe twice is sufficient.

Does your dog act up when you are on the phone?
Why? Does he rush doors? Why? Does he jump up on
you or others? Why? Does he strain upon his leash?

Why?

What can you do to prevent such behaviors
and what can you do to cure them once they
have begun.

The classical conditioning and operant conditioning
schools of thought will advise you to condition your
dog to respond with some other, more acceptable,
behavior to the stimulus which instigates the misbehavior.

Elaborate schemes are often devised. For instance
condition your dog to run to his crate to get a
treat when guests arrive to prevent him from
jumping upon your guests.

But this school of thought has nothing to
say about preventing such behavior problems
in the first place. And what if you don't
have any treats left? Or what if you are at
your neighbor's house with him?

And what if you wished that your dog would
just sit quietly when guests arrived instead
of each time having to bribe him to come to
his crate?

The force training school of thought will advise
you to scold, intimidate or by some means punish
your dog for what you deem to be misbehavior.

You do not believe that this approach may cause
your dog to
