Breakfast was...

A one pound tub of strawberries, boysenberry yogurt dipped.

A sugar OD perhaps so, but, tough on me. It don't hurt, yet!

Andy I posted my breakfast on the &quot;profiteroles&quot; thread.

I hope you didn't ADD sugar to your strawberries!

Strawberries are actually OK as far as sugar content goes.

My breakfast was pancakes with butter and golden syrup.  There's your
sugar OD!

Fried eggs, bacon and french toast that is sweet enough, you do not need
syrup.

Pain Perdue (French Toast)

French bread (stale), sliced 1&quot; thick
8 large eggs
3 cups Half &amp; Half or milk
2 tsp vanilla
1 1/2 cups sugar (I use Splenda)
dash of salt
Butter
Cinnamon (optional)
Confectioner's sugar

Butter a 9x13 baking dish, arrange bread in the bottom of the pan.

In a large bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk, vanilla, sugar and
salt.  Pour the mixture over the bread.  The bread will float and you
can turn the bread over a couple of times to make sure it is coated.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate over night.

In the morning, remove from the refrigerator and allow to come to room
temperature. Preheat the oven to 350(F).  Sprinkle the bread with
cinnamon and dot with plenty of butter.  Bake uncovered for 45-50
minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes, or the
French Toast will stick to the pan.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar and
serve. This French Toast is sweet, so maple syrup is optional.

Jeez, that's a lot of sugar.  Have you tried leaving out the egg
whites, and using all yolks?  It's much better.  I never put whites in
French toast dippy stuff.  I also typically at least triple the
vanilla extract.

Actually it's perfect... only thing I'd do differently is instead of
baking I'd deep fry until golden and steamy custardy creamy inside...
dust with powdered sugar and serve with a side of cherry preserves.
Naturally I'm gonna prepare and serve...  we're going to munch this in
bed with a big pitcher of mimosas.  And you don't have to do a thing
you don't want to, you don't have to move a muscle... all you gotta do
is lay there and leave everything to me. ;)

If you're gonna cut out the whites (I like that idea) you'll have to cut back
on the half &amp; half, which sounded excessive to begin with! Maybe 1 part eggs
to 2 parts half &amp; half by volume at the most?

I'd definitely cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup!

And skip waiting overnight. Soak five minutes, flipping once and pan fry.

This is my grandmother's recipe, so I have not tampered with it much,
but sure, why  not.  I will try omitting the egg whites and see how it
turns out. To be honest, it tastes delicious.  It puffs up and turns
golden brown on the top and it tastes custardy on the inside. My Half &amp;
Half expired Friday, so I chunked it.  I used skim milk instead, and it
tasted fine.  I like using part milk and part Half &amp; Half.

It is a traditional French or Cajun version of French Toast, grandma
called it Pain Perdue.  You are right, that is a lot of sugar.  I used
Splenda, because I am trying to lose a few pounds.  It tastes sweet
enough, that you do not need syrup, which saves a lot of calories.
