Not sure about the relevance to Photoshop but try

Apparently it's the yolk that is to blame. If you boil an egg the yolk heats
up slowly, but in the microwave it heats up too fast and explodes.

I checked the Photoshop help files, and all my Photoshop manuals, but I
couldn't find an answer to your question.
Are you sure it's actually photoshop related?

To answer your question however, I believe it's a combination of 2 reasons.
It's to do with the speed at which the egg cooks, and the way in which the
egg cooks.

As the contents of an egg cook, they expand.
If you boil it in a pan of water, they expand slowly, and the shell can
generally take the increased pressure as it's applied gradually and gently.
The most you'll get is the shell cracking and the egg inside being exposed
to the water.
However, if you cook it in the microwave, the egg cooks very quickly and as
a result, it also expands very quickly. The shell simply cannot contain this
rapid expansion and the egg explodes.

Also, when you boil an egg, it cooks from the outside through to the inside.
This means, as it cooks, the reinforcing wall of cooked egg gets thicker and
thicker, proving more and more protection against the increasing pressure of
the expanding egg inside.
But if you microwave it, it cooks from the inside out, so there's only the
thin thickness of the shell to contain all that expanding pressure inside,
and eventually that's going to fail, resulting in an exploding egg.

It's the same principle.
The inside expands too quickly for the outside to contain it. The result is
an explosion.

They don't explode in th etraditional sense. They sort of go a bit Pyro and
burn like crazy, and they release a toxic gas too. Something like cyanide,
although it might be something else.

Perhaps more to the point - the inside of a boiling egg cannot exceed 100 degrees C, and in practice probably doesnr
get above 70-80 degrees when cooked for the normal length of time. As a result the inside of an egg being boiled, wont
itself reach boiling point. It also heats up fairly slowly. Whereas the inside of a microwaved egg heats up rapidly -
and can reach and exceed 100 degrees C quickly. thus the egg &quot;boils&quot; within the shell, produces steam and bursts. Same
with fruit/vegetables. You could get the same effect (but even more hazardously - so don';t try this at home kids) by
dropping an egg into hot oil.

I thought this was all under 'E' in the photoshop help pages, but haven't checked recently.

&gt; This is what I understand (or guessing), and 20+ years ago my younger
&gt; brother told me about someone put a *boiled* egg (with no shell) in
&gt; microwave and it exploded, and egg was all over the inside of
&gt; microwave.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I haven't tried but I read CD disc explode in microwave too.

&gt;&gt; They don't explode in th etraditional sense. They sort of go a bit
&gt;&gt; Pyro and burn like crazy, and they release a toxic gas too.

&gt; I was thinking about some sparkling, but never tried to know for sure.

In the UK we have a TV show called Brainiacs.
They do all sorts of crazy and pointless experiments and pretend it's real
science.
One of the things they did was a series of experiments to see what would
happen if you put different things in a microwave oven.

&gt; Here in US we have a show called &quot;MythBusters&quot; they experiment many

We get Mythbusters here too. It's great.
They're both similar shows.
In Brainiacs they do things like seeing which gas is best for blowing up a
caravan, which type of fire extinguisher is best for making a rocket
propelled office chair, and seeing if you can cook an egg by surrounding it
with 100 mobile phones, all ringing at the same time.

Well that is just magic. However, if you can get a whole raw egg inside a glue bottle you will find that the egg sticks
to the inside walls of the bottle.

You can get grapes to do amazing things in microwaves, how about some
plasma, as in the burning type???

You can do eggs in the shell in the mcrowave, you just have to prick a small
hole in the end.
