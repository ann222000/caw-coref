Evening all-

Before I split my lid, I thought I'd ask a bit of advice.  2 weeks ago
I looked at and sulphited my wines to 50 ppm (the ones that had
completed MLF).  The ones that hadn't were still floating dangerously
low at 20 ppm (reds), but I expected them to finish soon.

Regardless, when I walked downstairs I was greeted with two carboys
(14 gallons) of Cab with white bubbles and a hazy, almost 'pinched'
surface, and the other with floating islands of white.  See here:

http://www.gotSheep.com/Wine/CRW_4059_sm.jpg
http://www.gotSheep.com/Wine/CRW_4058_sm.jpg

The one that has the bubbles reeks of of H2S.

I have sterile filtration equipment available.  I could filter the
wine, dump it outside in the sub zero weather, and then re-innoculate
it with MLF, as well as treat it to remove the smell.

I also have a number of chards that seem to be exhibiting other film
yeasts- all from the same bloody batch of juice, from the same
location.

I guess I just don't understand it:  I bought 120 gallons from these
folks- the ONLY trouble I have are in the same strains (Muscat and
Cab), and ONLY when bought at the same time.  I'm very frustrated
because I never know if I'm screwing up or if I'm just getting ****
ingredients, and I have NO idea how to fix that problem.

And to top it off (unrelated) my beautiful 10D stopped working after
these pics.

So.... anyone post any suggestions to brighten my day?

Thanks in advance-

Jason

I think we are going to need a bit more
information.  When did you start the wine? What
is the history on the batches so far? What was
the Brix? Did you ever rack the wine? What was /
is the pH?  Did you add SO2 prior to ML?

">

Wine started on October 14th- spent about 2 hours in a jug as I moved
it.  No SO2 added, ML added on day 5 of fermentation.  Wine racked,
then oaked, and maintained at 68-72F.  Initial Sugar SG was 1.085.
Wine was racked 2x- carboys were sterilized with Iodine at 35ppm for a
min of 10 mins.  Prior to and during the racking process the carboys
were inerted with CO2- three 'strong' blasts lasting 5 seconds each,
then a  long slow purge to maintain a layer of CO2 over the wine.  ML
was with the 3x from PiWine and fed with Bactivaid or (whatever) the
nutrient is that they offer to go with it.  ML was proceeding just
fine according to MLC- last CHR was done about 4 weeks prior- I tend
to do 1/2 batch every 2 weeks or so, depending on the strength of the
'spot'.

Does this help any?

The pictures seems to show that your carboys are not topped up.  I
fear that your problems may be a direct result of this.  Have they
been like this the entire time?
What does the wine taste like?

Jason,
Too much oxygen may be your basic problem.  Using inert gases effectively
involves much more than a few squirts of carbon dioxide gas.  More info here

No idea yet on the taste.  I didn't want to disrupt the surface
tension until I knew what actions I wished to take- and inserting a
2mm syringe might work, but the surface is fairly well covered.
Previously (2 - 3 weeks ago) it tasted fine.  The carboys have been
topped down at this level the entire time, approximately 1/3 the neck
(I'd estimate about 24 square inches of SA).

I have the equipment also to rig a vacuum aspirator / suction setup to
remove the top layer without using a spoon...

I truly appreciate everyone's help.  This has not been a particularly
happy week on any front, and if I come across as, well, cross, it's
not directed at anyone here.

drink it!

Thanks Lum-

I was mainly describing the process to show my attempts at minimizing
oxidation and blow out any particulates during the racking process- no
CO2 was kept over the surface during the aging process.  That Argon
system sounds very nice tho- I'm sure I could get an Argon MIG setup
fairly cheap...

Well, I gave her another whiff and they both had hints of H2S.  What
was interesting is that a 3rd bottle, 3L in size, had H2S but no foam
on the surface.  Not knowing what else to do I rigged up a 7 gallon
vaccuum aspirater, and then gently 'sucked' off as much of the layers
as I could.  This wine I discarded.

I prepared the carboys for transfer by sterilizing (yes) using 1
capful of Iodophor in 3L of solution- approximately 40 ppm ( &gt;3x the
12.5ppm for 60 seconds mandated by law).

I then racked the wine and, during the racking process, injected it
with 60 ppm K-Sulphite (2.6g/7 gallons) using the standard technique
of weighing, placing it in a shot glass, adding 5 cc of boiling water
via sterilized syringe, and then replunging until it's mixed.  Wine
was topped off to within 1" of the surface.  Used oak was discarded.
No new oak was added.

I'll let it sit now for a little while, unless anyone suggests I
should go ahead and sterile filter it.  It tasted 'off', no berry
taste, just some of the oak overtones.  Drinkable (and not a large
amount of H2S which was surprising to me), just not 'great'.

Now the Merlots, on the other hand, taste very berry and would be an
excellent blend if I have any cab left at the end of the year.

Thanks for the support and ideas-

Jason
