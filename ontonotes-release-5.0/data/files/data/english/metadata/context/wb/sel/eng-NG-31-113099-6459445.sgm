"The most honest congress in history"  Nancy Pelosi
THE JIM WEBB / PHILLIP THOMPSON GUN ARREST STORY has had the salutary effect
of bringing more attention to the District of Columbia's silly gun laws. The
Washington Post headlines its story this way: You Can Bring Gun to Capitol,
But Not Through D.C. and observes:

The arrest this week of Phillip Thompson, an aide to Sen. James Webb
(D-Va.) who carried a loaded pistol into a Senate office building, brought
to light a contradiction between the regulations governing the Capitol
grounds and the laws covering District streets.

The Capitol grounds are federal property and not subject to the District's
strict gun laws, which generally prohibit firearms.

Although some people are allowed to bring guns into the Capitol, they
cannot legally get them there, said Lt. Jon Shelton, the longtime head of
the D.C. police department's gun unit.

"They can't helicopter them in," Shelton said.

Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance W. Gainer said he would advise lawmakers
to "abide by D.C. laws" when not on Capitol grounds. He said members of
Congress who want guns at the Capitol should ask police to transport the
weapons for them.

Jeez. Though it seems to me that this may violate the right-to-travel
provisions of the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986. I'm not an expert
here, but I doubt that the D.C. police are, either.

Meanwhile, Timothy Noah, in Slate, parses Webb's statements and observes:

To one of the reporters present, this sounded as though Webb were saying
not only that he carried a gun with him when he was in Virginia, where it's
legal, but also that he carried a gun with him when he was in D.C., where
it's not. (D.C.'s handgun ban was recently struck down by the D.C. Court of
Appeals, but it remains in force while the city government seeks a review by
the full D.C. Circuit.) The reporter therefore asked, "Do you, senator, feel
that you are above Washington, D.C.'s gun law?" Webb replied: "I'm not going
to comment in any level in terms of how I provide for my own security." Webb
then reaffirmed his belief in the Second Amendment; said he couldn't comment
on any aspect of Thompson's case; denied, bafflingly, that he ever gave the
weapon to Thompson (Did that mean he gave it to another aide who in turn
gave it to Thompson?); and stated, most bafflingly of all, "I have never
carried a gun in the Capitol complex." Was Webb saying he's carried a gun
elsewhere in the District of Columbia? His office won't answer that
question.

Webb's silence increases the suspicion that he either has broken or
continues to break the D.C. law, more or less daring the local authorities
to do anything about it. That could be posturing; as Dana Milbank points out
in the March 28 Washington Post, nobody ever lost a vote in the state of
Virginia by thumbing his nose at gun control. Legally, though, Webb's
evasiveness constitutes probable cause, entitling the next D.C. cop Webb
encounters within city limits (but outside the Capitol) to frisk him. That's
probably the last thing D.C.'s new mayor, Adrian Fenty, and his new chief of
police, Cathy Lanier, would like to see happen. I therefore recommend that
Fenty or Lanier phone Webb and ask the senator straight out whether he
intends in the future to obey D.C.'s gun laws. (Figuring out whether Webb
has broken these laws in the past is the job of Thompson's prosecutors.) If
Webb answers anything other than "yes," then Lanier should dispatch a police
officer to frisk Webb at the senator's next public appearance outside the
Capitol. If Webb is carrying a handgun, that police officer should arrest
him. Sounds absurd, I know. But how can the D.C. government do otherwise
while on a daily basis it arrests less-well-dressed young black men for the
very same offense?

There's a solution to these absurdities -- adopt a sensible gun law in
Washington, D.C. The laws of neighboring Virginia -- or, heck, Tennessee --
would provide a good model. That would make it easy and legal for
law-abiding citizens to carry guns, without having to rely on the political
clout of being a U.S. Senator to avoid police harassment. After all,
reliance on that sort of clout isn't very populist.

Webb has said he's for liberal laws on gun carriage, and, I believe, for
national reciprocity laws that would make states recognize one another's
carry permits. So let's see less talk about legislation on the subject and
more action. Then we won't have to worry about this sort of thing happening
again.

On a humorous note, elsewhere in Slate Webb's comments are parsed
differently: "Coincidentally, in the new film Shooter, Ned Beatty plays a
U.S. senator who says, 'I don't carry a gun,' and then pulls out a Beretta
92."

UPDATE: The gunnies weigh in! First, a humorous comment from reader George
Lukes:

Ned Beatty's character spoke the truth. He wasn't carrying a gun, only a
poorly designed gun wannabe, the Beretta 92.

Ouch! There are people who like 'em, but I'd prefer a Sig, a Glock, or a
model 1911 .45. Still, it's a gun, sort of. And reader Michael Seifert
writes:

Some observations I have not seen elsewhere.

1. Isn't part of this story irresponsibility? As a former Boy Scout
Marksman, I was drilled on not only the proper shooting of a firearm, but it's
handling, transportation and storage. A loaded handgun has only two places
to be. On your person under immediate control, or in a locked case. Some
would argue the locked case should never contain a loaded weapon. Carrying a
loaded weapon in a shopping bag, backpack or briefcase is, to me, the height
of irresponsibility on the part of the owner. Once Jim Webb surrendered his
personal control of the weapon, it should have been secured AND unloaded. I
would like to hear him explain that!

2. Congress members are free from arrest going to and from legislative
business. Combine that with the 2nd amendment and I think the DC police
would not be well advised to try to enforce what looks like a shaky law.

But the part that bugs me the most is the lack of gun owner's
responsibility.

That may be a little strong, but this was not good practice. If Webb's too
busy and distracted to take care of his gun -- not implausible for a
Senator -- then he shouldn't carry one. This is why busy, distracted people
who can afford them hire bodyguards. Even if you possess all the skills to
defend yourself, if you can't properly implement them in your daily life
you're better off recognizing that fact. On the other hand anyone -- even
professional bodyguards, like the one working for Edward Kennedy who got
caught with an illegal submachine gun in the Capitol -- can suffer a lapse
of attention.

As for the immunity claim, I don't think it works, as the privilege against
arrest extends to all cases except treason, felony, and breach of the peace.
Illegal guns are a felony in the District; I'm not sure, but I think that
illegally carrying a gun may qualify as a breach of the peace. I wouldn't
advise Webb to rely on that, anyway . . . .

And it's not necessarily bad news for Webb on the political front. As Dave
Hardy observes: "I thought Webb showed great potential for becoming the
Right Sort of Democrat, and this tends to confirm it."

If Jim Webb has been a Republican the Drive-By Media would STILL be talking
about this.  Chris Matthews would be screaming Gun Nuts at the top his
already screechy whine.  The NY Times would be running article asking for a
resignation.  But what do you hear instead?  &lt;crickets&gt;  Do you need anymore
proof that the liberal media is clearly biased?

"Chris Matthews is a Republican"?! The same Chris Matthews that worked
as a speech writer for Jimmy Carter? Really? We're talkin' about the

Now then what were you saying about "fucking nitwit[s]"?

&gt;&gt; think that illegally carrying a gun may qualify as a breach of the peace.
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't advise Webb to rely on that, anyway . . . .

&gt;&gt; And it's not necessarily bad news for Webb on the political front. As
&gt;&gt; Dave Hardy observes: &quot;I thought Webb showed great potential for becoming
&gt;&gt; the Right Sort of Democrat, and this tends to confirm it.&quot;

&gt; If Jim Webb has been a Republican the Drive-By Media would STILL be
&gt; talking about this.  Chris Matthews would be screaming Gun Nuts at the top
&gt; his already screechy whine.  The NY Times would be running article asking
&gt; for a resignation.  But what do you hear instead?  &lt;crickets&gt;  Do you need
&gt; anymore proof that the liberal media is clearly biased?
">

rotfl

You make an assertion of what you think would happen if Webb were a
Republican and then use it as PROOF of a liberal media bias.  That is the
most illogical thing that I have ever heard.  It's no wonder nobody pays any
attention to you.

Yes.
We're talking about the same Chris Mathews that admitted voting for King
Georgie iv. We're talking about the Chris Mathews who's brother is
running for public office in the GOP. Just because you are a member of a
public servant's staff, it doesn't make you part of that party, MORON.

Alas you may be right in the sense that Republics have fucked things
over so bad that the GOP may not last much longer.

I think Chris Mathews calls himself an Independent (ever since Bush
has tarnished the GOP, completely and thoroughly, for the next 100
years) now. I thought Chris was a democrat who did not like Hillary
Clinton. He is a nice person otherwise.

I have a feeling Hillary will be our next President, after an 8 year
vacancy in the job office of the president.

This may come as a shock to you, but some people do change their party
affiliation every once in a while.  For instance, Ronald Reagan . . . yes,
the Republican icon and conservative late-President . . . was at one time a
Democrat.  And liberal talk show host Stephanie Miller not only used to be a
Republican, but is the daughter of Barry Goldwater's 1964 running-mate, the
late Bill Miller.  Rudy Giuliani used to be a Democrat.  Heck, even little
old me, a Democratic Party Ward Chair in my own state, used to be a
Republican.  You see, as some Republicans mature they acquire a certain
level of knowledge and wisdom, and become Democrats.  As some Democrats grow
older they begin to lose their minds to Alzheimer's or other mental
ailments, and they become Republicans.

All of which is immaterial when talking about Chris Matthews, who describes
himself as an Independent, even though his brother was the candidate for
Lieutenant Governor on the Republican ticket in Pennsylvania last year, and
Chris himself has worked as a speechwriter for a Democratic President.  By
the way, to the best of my knowledge, Chris was never a candidate in the
Democratic Party's primary process.

&gt;&gt; This may come as a shock to you, but some people do change their party
&gt;&gt; affiliation every once in a while.

&gt; Fine, show me where Chris Matthews has ever claimed to be a
&gt; Republican.

&gt;&gt; For instance, Ronald Reagan . . . yes,
&gt;&gt; the Republican icon and conservative late-President . . . was at one time
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; Democrat.  And liberal talk show host Stephanie Miller not only used to
&gt;&gt; be a
&gt;&gt; Republican, but is the daughter of Barry Goldwater's 1964 running-mate,
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; late Bill Miller.  Rudy Giuliani used to be a Democrat.  Heck, even
&gt;&gt; little
&gt;&gt; old me, a Democratic Party Ward Chair in my own state, used to be a
&gt;&gt; Republican.

&gt; What has any of this to do with Matthews? You're a nut.

&gt;&gt;  You see, as some Republicans mature they acquire a certain
&gt;&gt; level of knowledge and wisdom, and become Democrats.

&gt; Like those old-fart dims in South Florida back in 2000 that couldn't
&gt; figure out how to punch a hole in a piece of paper? Yea, bunch of
&gt; fuckin' Mensa members ya got there.

&gt;&gt;  As some Democrats grow
&gt;&gt; older they begin to lose their minds to Alzheimer's or other mental
&gt;&gt; ailments, and they become Republicans.

&gt; Alzheimer patients memory loss is well documented, even short
&gt; term...like the old-farts in South Florida in 2000 who couldn't
&gt; remember if they punched the ballot for gore or accidentially punched
&gt; for Pat Buchanan.

&gt;&gt; All of which is immaterial when talking about Chris Matthews, who
&gt;&gt; describes
&gt;&gt; himself as an Independent, even though his brother was the candidate for
&gt;&gt; Lieutenant Governor on the Republican ticket in Pennsylvania last year,
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; Chris himself has worked as a speechwriter for a Democratic President.
&gt;&gt; By
&gt;&gt; the way, to the best of my knowledge, Chris was never a candidate in the
&gt;&gt; Democratic Party's primary process.

&gt; Well, the best of your knowledge sucks. Look it up.

based on things he's said.  As far as my not being able to accept the idea

I don't need a cite.  I said probably.  You don't need to prove what you
believe is "probably true".  However, it really is quite logical.  Mensa
members, by definition, have a high degree of intelligence.  Intelligent
people tend to think for themselves.  The Democratic Party encourages free
thought and the questioning of the logic of maintaining the status quo.
Those who advocate making progress . . . progressives, or liberals . . .
tend to be free thinkers who find a natural home in the Democratic Party.
Those who advocate maintaining the status quo . . . conservatives . . . or
reverting back to the ideas of a bygone age . . . regressives . . . tend to
gravitate toward the party of dogma and "the way things used to be in the
good old days" . . . the GOP.

&gt; &gt;  I much prefer the old farts who punched
&gt; &gt; the hole directly across from Gore's name, not realizing that if you
held
&gt; &gt; twisted the ballot just right you could figure out that it was a punch
for
&gt; &gt; Buchanan.

&gt; Of course you do...you're a dopey liberal fuckwit.

&gt; &gt; At least that's an honest mistake, instead of dereliction of
&gt; &gt; duty.

&gt; What have you show show that it was an honest mistake and not a
&gt; dereliction of duty? With the right to vote comes with responsibility.
&gt; If those old dims Want they're vote to count they need to take the
&gt; time to be sure they do it right, not bitch about it after their man
&gt; loses.

Repeat that in English, and I'll try to respond.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of which is immaterial when talking about Chris Matthews, who
&gt; &gt; describes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself as an Independent, even though his brother was the candidate
for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lieutenant Governor on the Republican ticket in Pennsylvania last
year,
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris himself has worked as a speechwriter for a Democratic
President.
&gt; &gt; By
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the way, to the best of my knowledge, Chris was never a candidate in
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Democratic Party's primary process.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, the best of your knowledge sucks. Look it up.

&gt; &gt; Yeah, I found it in one place on the web . . . Wikipedia, which is the
same
&gt; &gt; place that Matthews says he was a Goldwater Republican.

&gt; Before he became a dim. Where does he say he switched back?

&gt; &gt; But you don't want
&gt; &gt; to believe that part.  You want to selectively believe what you want to
&gt; &gt; believe.  You're an idiot.

&gt; Funny how you had to ignore the part of the Wikipedia entry where it
&gt; talks about him running in the '74 dim primary. Must really suck to
&gt; think yourself so open minded then realize you're nothing but a fraud.
&gt; Stay slow, dimbulb.

Idiot!  Read my post again!  You insisted I show you where Matthews ever
said he was a Republican.  I knew I'd heard it before, but didn't know
exactly where from, so I looked it up.  In the process of finding it I also
stumbled across the reference to the '74 primary.  I then posted that "the
best of my knowledge", prior to finding that tidbit was less than complete,
and admitted that you were right about the primary.  I, at least, admitted
that my knowledge of Chris Matthews' background was incomplete, and that you
were actually correct about something.  That's called being "open minded".
You, on the other hand, still refuse to admit that he was once a Republican.
And you call ME a "fraud"?  Give it up, Junior.  You're out of your league.
