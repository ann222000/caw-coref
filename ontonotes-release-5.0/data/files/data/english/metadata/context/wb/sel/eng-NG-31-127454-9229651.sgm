For me, the high point of the series was &quot;Lightning Struck Tower&quot;.
Draco is holding DD hostage.  He is, at first, defiant in the manner
of a child hoping the adults will stop him.  But there is a moment
when he realizes, belatedly, that he has actually won.  He has beaten
and disarmed the greatest wizard of all time and succeeded in the Dark
Lord's mission.  No longer a scared child and a victim, he has become
a man and a Death Eater of distinction -- or rather, he will, if he
completes his victory.

Draco's lowering of his wand proves the crowning grace note of a
series where the predominant morality of both good and bad seems to be
use of brute force to seek power and status for one's self and
friends.  Loyalty to one's own House and Family are the predominant
virtues.  &quot;Honor&quot; is defended with force: An insult to a boy's mother
can result in severe two-on-one retributive violence, and docking
House points was once avenged with attempted murder (in both cases,
&quot;Good Guy&quot; behavior).  Draco's submission was a rare moment of
Strength yielding to Morality, to come over the the RIGHT side, not
the stronger one.  A similar grace note was struck, albeit humorously,
when Hermione Granger slapped Draco in POA.  Draco and Co. had been
looking for a fight, but instead received a moral rebuke, causing them
to unexpectedly back off.

Such moments are rare.  The House Feud at Hogwarts is a savage Gang
War, not a sportsmanlike rivalry.  Any moral rules that are introduced
by the heroes are instantly violated by their own behavior.  Sirius in
particular imparts moral lessons without noticing he does not live by
them, a point Rowling emphasized in interview.  Gryffindor teacher
&quot;Moody&quot; severely punishes Slytherin Draco for attacking from behind,
and the Trio seemingly approve.  But when the Twins attack the
Slytherin Trio from behind later in the same book, none of the heroes
object.  Draco's speech about pure-bloodedness rankles insecure newbie
Harry in the first book, but Hagrid comforts him by explaining that
the Malfoy's are all &quot;bad blood&quot;.  It isn't that one side are bigots
and some are not, but that each chooses the form of bigotry that
aggrandizes one's self and one's friends.  Dumbledore makes
politically correct speeches about werewolves and giants and Muggles
and other Blood bigotry.  But his idea of a compliment to a Slytherin
is to suggest that he should have been in Gryffindor - a &quot;Very white
of you, Kingsley&quot; sort of remark.

The use of humor to cover up evildoing is also a repeated theme,
related to the above hypocrisy.  For both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; guys, what
is evil when THEY do it is a joke when WE do it.  The House Elf heads
on the walls indicate Dark Wizardry to Harry at Grimmauld Place, but
it is all good fun when the Twins use a living but petrified garden
gnome as a Christmas tree ornament.  The Twins attack-for-fun on
Dudley is quickly followed by the Death Eaters attack-for-fun on a
Muggle family.  It is cruel when Aunt Marge sets her dog on little
Harry, but &quot;a highly amusing joke&quot; to set a deadly werewolf on Snape.
It is bullying when Draco jinxes Neville, but a joke when Harry jinxes
random students in the halls.  It is cruel when Dudley and his little
pals shove Harry's head in a toilet and laugh, but a joke when a
similar experience leaves Montague brain-damaged.  Shortly, after the
ferret incident, the class screams with laughter as Moody uses the
Imperius Curse on a spider.  Moody snaps:  &quot;Funny, is it?  You'd like
it, I suppose, if I did it to you.&quot;  The class shuts up.  What they
don't do is reflect on how this principle applies to their out-of-
class behavior.

I like Harry's face-off against fellow-hypocrite Narcissa Malfoy in
HBP.  Narcissa has no beef with what her husband does to muggles for
fun, but she sure doesn't like Harry treating her son the same way.
Harry was willing to reduce Draco to a bloody spot on the Quiddich
green for insulting his mother, but he and Ron don't mind threatening
a woman with real force.  When Draco breaks Harry's nose on the
Hogwarts Express shortly afterwards, Harry's hatred of Draco, as he
lies there miserable and helpless, probably reflects the way Draco
felt towards Harry during his similar experiences at the end of the
previous two books.  But this is a connection left to the READER to
make.  It never occurs to Harry to reflect that maybe HE should not
have kicked a helpless enemy when he was down any more than Draco
should have.

When Harry watches the victorious Draco lower his wand before the
helpless Dumbledore, we are treated to the hope that what the Hat has
been wishing for might come to pass.  That there will be some
transcendence of the pettiness, cruelty, and bigotry that has
characterized both sides.  But in the end, it is all about who has the
biggest wand after all.  The Trio return to a Hogwarts which despite
upheavals is at heart EXACTLY the same as what they left: Three Houses
(&quot;good&quot;) v. Slytherin (&quot;bad&quot;).  Harry has not much changed either,
except for the worse.  If a Slytherin spits on his Head of House, it
is the CRUCIO for them instead of a mere Levicorpus.  Harry develops
some pity for Draco, yes, and in the Room of Requirement Harry saves
Draco's life.  Nice and all, but they have have just ended up the
moral equivalent of James Potter.  Our payoff for seven books of
escalating cruelty is that yes, it continues through the next
generation, but hey it isn't lethal.

In the end, this story offers little moral reflection or moral
growth.  Harry begins and ends an impulse-driven child who does what
he feels like doing.  This is often compassionate, but if it isn't
that is too bad, because he will do it anyway.  In the NARNIA series,
the oldest boy Peter regrets that he used defending someone from a
bully as an excuse to be a spiteful bully himself. This is the sort of
reflection one would hope a youth destined to wield power (or anybody,
really) would be capable of.  Instead, Rowling gives us a &quot;hero&quot; who
preaches remorse to a SOCIOPATH (an exercise in futility if there ever
was one) but ignores the mote in his own eye.  Bartemius Crouch was
considered as bad as the Death Eaters because he condoned their
methods when under extreme duress.  Does that not make Harry -- who
used Crucio out of prideful vindictiveness -- even worse?  Are we
supposed to be happy at the man he has made of himself?

Despite her unheroic heroes and lack of overt moralizing, Rowling
emphasizes the humanity of her bad guys in subtle ways, which is its
own argument against &quot;good guy&quot; brutality and abuse of power.  This
makes her story a huge humanistic improvement over, say, Pullman.  But
when we are reminded that &quot;the world isn't divided into good guys and
Death Eaters&quot;, the message isn't that we need to recognize and oppose
evil, cruelty and wrong even in ourselves and our friends.  It comes
across more as &quot;We are all Death Eaters at heart, but that is no
biggie&quot;.  Everyone has their petty, cruel lives spared by the
Christlike sacrifice of the un-Christlike hero.  Men teach their sons
to ape their bullying ways.  Women make token protests while smirking
behind their hands Lily-style.  And after seven long, looooong books,
our Epic Quest ends in yet another mean-spirited squabble with the
Sackville-Bagginses.

In some ways JKR believes in &quot;show, don't tell&quot;, and expects the
reader to observe the kind of contrasts you have pointed out.

This is what we're supposed to notice.  The sheer number of examples
is an indication that JKR is trying to get people to see the

It was not presented as a joke to the reader; every reference
to that indicates that it was reprehensible.  It was only a joke
to the teenage Sirius (and, possibly, to Wormtail), and Sirius is
presented as a stereotypical juvenile delinquent.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I don't recall that - I do recall Harry jinxing Crabbe and Goyle,
who were disguised at the time in order to guard Draco's undercover
work, but Harry knew who they were.  It was not a random jinxing.
It was also not a joke when there was a fight in the hall.  JKR
showed Harry age 12 laughing at the Slytherins who were spattered
with potion as a side effect of the plan to steal boomslang skin,
but that wasn't written entirely as a joke for the _reader_.

They never actually did that in the book.

The gang-war aspects show in that reaction by some of the boys
but IIRC Hermione points out the problem.  Hermione is usually
the moral compass point.

At least one student didn't, and it was made very obvious.
JKR can't tell us everything in so many words; the books would be
the size of the unabridged OED, and duller to read.  Here she is
actually more explicit than usual, having Moody make the point.
This may be part of her growth as a writer, finding out what parts
of the books needed to be made clearer.

Sometimes the point of a story is not that the hero is perfect,

Also, I don't recall Harry doing the kicking; I thought that was
the Twins.

There are changes.  Part of the point is that it takes time to
make major changes. Generally at least a full generation have
to be brought up in the new way and be old enough to take the
jobs that oversee the new system.

Harry is a teenager who is still only 17 at the end of the series.
Moreover, he is deliberately not made an intellectual giant; that's
Hermione's job.  The overpowering force behind the story is supposed
to be &quot;love&quot;, and even in its lower forms, it is love that overpowers
reason, even for Hermione.  Harry follows his developing magical
intuition, which makes even his more sensitive decisions seem to be
merely impulsive.

True, but Harry hasn't studied psychology; he doesn't know what
a sociopath is.  Neither does Dumbledore.  (Muggle Studies should
be a required course.)  The incident is there for the purpose of
allegorical teaching.  The important part is not the success or
failure but the attempt.

Harry used Crucio several times, but I don't recall any pridefulness

That was in book one... Neville standing up against his friends for
principle.  Harry observes and eventually is shocked by the incidents
he observes.  It takes him longer than one book to become even close
to being adult enough to be able to object.

The series is not a simple morality play.

It wasn't a token protest - it resulted in a change of statement by
the offender.

I really don't know where you get that bit.  I didn't see any
mean-spirited squabbling.  I did find young Albus's behavior
disturbing; admittedly Harry has had no real experience of good
parenting (nor has Ginny IMO), but I suspect too much influence
from Uncle George.  At least it seems that Slytherin has had its
behavior and image upgraded, since Harry seems happy enough with
the idea that Albus might be in Slytherin.  (So where did Albus
get the idea that it would be bad? from Uncle George, I bet).

Yes, I noticed in Book One.  I read the series anyway hoping for some

that makes him a believably flawed hero, and makes his ultimate

makes him a dense little git who would make a perfect Nazi, albeit a
heroically self-sacrificing Nazi.

He is shocked to observe some bad behavior of the Marauders - but he
himself is just as guilty.  He too bullies like James did, and he too
tags along with and supports the bullying of others even when it
nearly kills somebody, as Lupin did.  And he never realizes it, stops
it, or grows out of it.  Yeah, okay, we're &quot;supposed to notice&quot;.  Are
we supposed to be happy about it, or what?

&gt; Draco is holding DD hostage.  He is, at first, defiant in the manner
&gt; of a child hoping the adults will stop him.  But there is a moment
&gt; when he realizes, belatedly, that he has actually won.  He has beaten
&gt; and disarmed the greatest wizard of all time and succeeded in the Dark
&gt; Lord's mission.  No longer a scared child and a victim, he has become
&gt; a man and a Death Eater of distinction -- or rather, he will, if he
&gt; completes his victory.

&gt; Draco's lowering of his wand proves the crowning grace note of a
&gt; series where the predominant morality of both good and bad seems to be
&gt; use of brute force to seek power and status for one's self and
&gt; friends.  Loyalty to one's own House and Family are the predominant
&gt; virtues.  &quot;Honor&quot; is defended with force: An insult to a boy's mother
&gt; can result in severe two-on-one retributive violence, and docking
&gt; House points was once avenged with attempted murder (in both cases,
&gt; &quot;Good Guy&quot; behavior).  Draco's submission was a rare moment of
&gt; Strength yielding to Morality, to come over the the RIGHT side, not
&gt; the stronger one.  A similar grace note was struck, albeit humorously,
&gt; when Hermione Granger slapped Draco in POA.  Draco and Co. had been
&gt; looking for a fight, but instead received a moral rebuke, causing them
&gt; to unexpectedly back off.

&gt; Such moments are rare.  The House Feud at Hogwarts is a savage Gang
&gt; War, not a sportsmanlike rivalry.  Any moral rules that are introduced
&gt; by the heroes are instantly violated by their own behavior.  Sirius in
&gt; particular imparts moral lessons without noticing he does not live by
&gt; them, a point Rowling emphasized in interview.  Gryffindor teacher
&gt; &quot;Moody&quot; severely punishes Slytherin Draco for attacking from behind,
&gt; and the Trio seemingly approve.  But when the Twins attack the
&gt; Slytherin Trio from behind later in the same book, none of the heroes
&gt; object.  Draco's speech about pure-bloodedness rankles insecure newbie
&gt; Harry in the first book, but Hagrid comforts him by explaining that
&gt; the Malfoy's are all &quot;bad blood&quot;.  It isn't that one side are bigots
&gt; and some are not, but that each chooses the form of bigotry that
&gt; aggrandizes one's self and one's friends.  Dumbledore makes
&gt; politically correct speeches about werewolves and giants and Muggles
&gt; and other Blood bigotry.  But his idea of a compliment to a Slytherin
&gt; is to suggest that he should have been in Gryffindor - a &quot;Very white
&gt; of you, Kingsley&quot; sort of remark.

&gt; The use of humor to cover up evildoing is also a repeated theme,
&gt; related to the above hypocrisy.  For both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; guys, what
&gt; is evil when THEY do it is a joke when WE do it.  The House Elf heads
&gt; on the walls indicate Dark Wizardry to Harry at Grimmauld Place, but
&gt; it is all good fun when the Twins use a living but petrified garden
&gt; gnome as a Christmas tree ornament.  The Twins attack-for-fun on
&gt; Dudley is quickly followed by the Death Eaters attack-for-fun on a
&gt; Muggle family.  It is cruel when Aunt Marge sets her dog on little
&gt; Harry, but &quot;a highly amusing joke&quot; to set a deadly werewolf on Snape.
&gt; It is bullying when Draco jinxes Neville, but a joke when Harry jinxes
&gt; random students in the halls.  It is cruel when Dudley and his little
&gt; pals shove Harry's head in a toilet and laugh, but a joke when a
&gt; similar experience leaves Montague brain-damaged.  Shortly, after the
&gt; ferret incident, the class screams with laughter as Moody uses the
&gt; Imperius Curse on a spider.  Moody snaps:  &quot;Funny, is it?  You'd like
&gt; it, I suppose, if I did it to you.&quot;  The class shuts up.  What they
&gt; don't do is reflect on how this principle applies to their out-of-
&gt; class behavior.

&gt; I like Harry's face-off against fellow-hypocrite Narcissa Malfoy in
&gt; HBP.  Narcissa has no beef with what her husband does to muggles for
&gt; fun, but she sure doesn't like Harry treating her son the same way.
&gt; Harry was willing to reduce Draco to a bloody spot on the Quiddich
&gt; green for insulting his mother, but he and Ron don't mind threatening
&gt; a woman with real force.  When Draco breaks Harry's nose on the
&gt; Hogwarts Express shortly afterwards, Harry's hatred of Draco, as he
&gt; lies there miserable and helpless, probably reflects the way Draco
&gt; felt towards Harry during his similar experiences at the end of the
&gt; previous two books.  But this is a connection left to the READER to
&gt; make.  It never occurs to Harry to reflect that maybe HE should not
&gt; have kicked a helpless enemy when he was down any more than Draco
&gt; should have.

&gt; When Harry watches the victorious Draco lower his wand before the
&gt; helpless Dumbledore, we are treated to the hope that what the Hat has
&gt; been wishing for might come to pass.  That there will be some
&gt; transcendence of the pettiness, cruelty, and bigotry that has
&gt; characterized both sides.  But in the end, it is all about who has the
&gt; biggest wand after all.  The Trio return to a Hogwarts which despite
&gt; upheavals is at heart EXACTLY the same as what they left: Three Houses
&gt; (&quot;good&quot;) v. Slytherin (&quot;bad&quot;).  Harry has not much changed either,
&gt; except for the worse.  If a Slytherin spits on his Head of House, it
&gt; is the CRUCIO for them instead of a mere Levicorpus.  Harry develops
&gt; some pity for Draco, yes, and in the Room of Requirement Harry saves
&gt; Draco's life.  Nice and all, but they have have just ended up the
&gt; moral equivalent of James Potter.  Our payoff for seven books of
&gt; escalating cruelty is that yes, it continues through the next
&gt; generation, but hey it isn't lethal.

&gt; In the end, this story offers little moral reflection or moral
&gt; growth.  Harry begins and ends an impulse-driven child who does what
&gt; he feels like doing.  This is often compassionate, but if it isn't
&gt; that is too bad, because he will do it anyway.  In the NARNIA series,
&gt; the oldest boy Peter regrets that he used defending someone from a
&gt; bully as an excuse to be a spiteful bully himself. This is the sort of
&gt; reflection one would hope a youth destined to wield power (or anybody,
&gt; really) would be capable of.  Instead, Rowling gives us a &quot;hero&quot; who
&gt; preaches remorse to a SOCIOPATH (an exercise in futility if there ever
&gt; was one) but ignores the mote in his own eye.  Bartemius Crouch was
&gt; considered as bad as the Death Eaters because he condoned their
&gt; methods when under extreme duress.  Does that not make Harry -- who
&gt; used Crucio out of prideful vindictiveness -- even worse?  Are we
&gt; supposed to be happy at the man he has made of himself?

&gt; Despite her unheroic heroes and lack of overt moralizing, Rowling
&gt; emphasizes the humanity of her bad guys in subtle ways, which is its
&gt; own argument against &quot;good guy&quot; brutality and abuse of power.  This
&gt; makes her story a huge humanistic improvement over, say, Pullman.  But
&gt; when we are reminded that &quot;the world isn't divided into good guys and
&gt; Death Eaters&quot;, the message isn't that we need to recognize and oppose
&gt; evil, cruelty and wrong even in ourselves and our friends.  It comes
&gt; across more as &quot;We are all Death Eaters at heart, but that is no
&gt; biggie&quot;.  Everyone has their petty, cruel lives spared by the
&gt; Christlike sacrifice of the un-Christlike hero.  Men teach their sons
&gt; to ape their bullying ways.  Women make token protests while smirking
&gt; behind their hands Lily-style.  And after seven long, looooong books,

&gt; Sackville-Bagginses.

DH shows us that both Dumbledore and Snape are reformed characters,
albeit not pure white after their conversion, so it's not completely
bleak. I agree that it shows a much darker picture than we might expect,
had it been a story of middle class life in a liberal democracy. &quot;This
is a story that starts with a double murder,&quot; is a phrase that has stuck
in my mind, although I do not know the source. The Potterverse is darker
than that. This is a story that takes place in a world where the
government does not have anything close to a monopoly on the use of
physical force. The Minister of Magic has less power over his subjects
than almost any Muggle government except the Narco-states. All parties
know this, and it would be true even if the Ministry was not corrupt; it
is a cause of that corruption, not its effect. Without a trustworthy
government capable of controlling its most powerful subjects, there is
no independent arbitrator to enforce law and order. And yet Harry Potter
grows up in the middle of this turmoil as a sort of Parseval; he has the
strength of ten (or in his case the power of love) because his heart is
pure. Even Harry isn't perfect - I agree that he has a filthy temper -,
but he is good without being weak, never stops trying to do the right
thing, and eventually kills the villain without becoming a murderer
himself.

I don't require that a work of fiction function as a treatise on ethics,
and I don't believe that it says that &quot;we are all Death Eaters at
heart,&quot; but it would do us no harm to realise that enough of us are
capable of becoming Death Eaters that we need to worry about it. That is
why the colonies (:-)) put checks and balances in their constitution
when they decided to stop being part of a constitutional monarchy. Much
later on, in 1963, Milgram
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment ) showed that most
people could be put into situations in which they deliberately did
things that they believed caused great pain and perhaps permanent damage
to people under their control. To quote &quot;Experiments with People&quot; (2004:
Abelson, Frey, and Gregg) &quot;Milgram's results are an antidote to moral
self-complacency, making it harder for us to assume that we could never
act like Adolf Eichmann in Nazi Germany, Lt. Calley in My Lai, or one of
the suicide victims in Jonestown, Guyana.&quot; (end quote) We should
remember that there are situations we should avoid, and ways of
organising people that we should never use, because under those
conditions some people are likely commit horrific crimes.

&gt;Well I wasn't really complaining.  Just setting the scene created in

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&gt; In some ways JKR believes in &quot;show, don't tell&quot;, and expects the
&gt;&gt; reader to observe the kind of contrasts you have pointed out.

&gt;And judging from Book 7, she expects the reader not to mind them.
">

It isn't always necessary to say it in so many words.  There's a
scene in the movie, _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_, that uses
a similar effect.  Lancelot charges into a wedding party, expecting
to rescue an imprisoned maiden.  But the real situation is that
the imprisoned unwilling one is the male, and the young woman whose
teeth he knocked out in his mad rush was the bride-to-be.  When
they first show him rushing in and causing mayhem in general, the
speed and direction is such that the audience seems to be expected
to laugh at her pain.  But when Lancelot comes back downstairs,
no longer in his &quot;hero mode&quot;, he sees the pain he has caused,
and the audience - most of whom laughed at that first scene - now
are wincing as he does, remembering that they laughed at a young
woman having her teeth knocked out.  It is an _intensely_ uncomfortable
moment, and it is never mentioned in dialogue.  The audience either
gets it or they don't. (P.S. the unwilling son's father marries her,
but there's no magical dentistry to repair the damage.)

Sometimes it's a stronger lesson when it isn't pointed out
explicitly.  Yeah, some of those scenes are written to get the
reader to laugh - but the alert reader will figure it out later.
It's a risky way to write, but when it works, it really works.

&gt;&gt; &gt; For both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; guys,
&gt;&gt; &gt;what is evil when THEY do it is a joke when WE do it.

&gt;&gt; This is what we're supposed to notice.  The sheer number of examples
&gt;&gt; is an indication that JKR is trying to get people to see the
&gt;&gt; contrasting behaviors.

&gt;Well, so I thought.  But the &quot;hero&quot; never notices, which ruins the
&gt;point of slogging through seven long books waiting for him to catch
&gt;on.
">

I agree it would be better if Harry ever specifically noticed, but
several times Hermione notices, and Harry is in &quot;hero mode&quot; most of
the time.  Part of what JKR is doing is making Harry a totally
ordinary boy (as Snape fairly accurately describes him), a deliberately
&quot;Everyman&quot; type of hero, rather than a perfect saintly Victorian hero
like the ones Dickens wrote.  If it weren't for the plot-required
ability to love and to get others to care about him, and a generally
friendly attitude despite having been abused for ten years, Harry
wouldn't be particularly unusual as a wizard.  He is required by
the plot to be thicker than average, so that things can be explained
to him and so he can be shown having to practice and study, instead
of having everything come as easily as flying a broom did.

&gt;Yes, I noticed in Book One.  I read the series anyway hoping for some
&gt;payoff.  If the hero doesn't notice his flaws for a long, long time,
&gt;that makes him a believably flawed hero, and makes his ultimate
&gt;realization the more meaningful.   If he never notices AT ALL, that
&gt;makes him a dense little git who would make a perfect Nazi, albeit a

Flawed, old-fashioned, gray-area, anti-, whatever - Harry was not
designed as a shining example, only as a boy who had a destiny forced
on him and had extremely bad examples for behavior while growing up.
The Dursleys and Aunt Marge weren't exactly good examples of behavior,
let alone examples of someone noticing their own flaws.  The point of
having such an ordinary, flawed hero is that the reader is supposed to
gain the hope that s/he, too, might become heroic at least to some
extent because it is so clear that a hero need not be perfect in all
ways.

Yes, even as Lupin supported the Marauders despite being a prefect,
Harry does go along with the general Gryffindor belief that anything

&gt; For me, the high point of the series was &quot;Lightning Struck Tower&quot;.
&gt; Draco is holding DD hostage.  He is, at first, defiant in the manner
&gt; of a child hoping the adults will stop him.  But there is a moment
&gt; when he realizes, belatedly, that he has actually won.  He has beaten
&gt; and disarmed the greatest wizard of all time and succeeded in the Dark
&gt; Lord's mission.  No longer a scared child and a victim, he has become
&gt; a man and a Death Eater of distinction -- or rather, he will, if he
&gt; completes his victory.

&gt; Draco's lowering of his wand proves the crowning grace note of a
&gt; series where the predominant morality of both good and bad seems to be
&gt; use of brute force to seek power and status for one's self and
&gt; friends.  Loyalty to one's own House and Family are the predominant
&gt; virtues.  &quot;Honor&quot; is defended with force: An insult to a boy's mother
&gt; can result in severe two-on-one retributive violence, and docking
&gt; House points was once avenged with attempted murder (in both cases,
&gt; &quot;Good Guy&quot; behavior).  Draco's submission was a rare moment of
&gt; Strength yielding to Morality, to come over the the RIGHT side, not
&gt; the stronger one.  A similar grace note was struck, albeit humorously,
&gt; when Hermione Granger slapped Draco in POA.  Draco and Co. had been
&gt; looking for a fight, but instead received a moral rebuke, causing them
&gt; to unexpectedly back off.
">

Draco's actions on the tower had nothing to do with grace or morality.
He was simply a frightened child who had got in too deep. While he was
capable of plotting murder by poison or a cursed object, he lacked the
force of will needed to kill face to face.  Draco didn't submit to
Dumbledore's moral authority, he simply dithered until other Death
Eaters arrived and he was trapped. There was no change in Draco
afterwards. He lacked the courage either to renounce Voldemort or to
serve him effectively.

Your comment on &quot;severe retributive violence&quot; shows a serious lack of
perspective. Harry was responding to deliberate and premeditated
provocation from Draco and his friends. The Slytherins had been taunting
Ron for the whole match. Harry had just been hit with an illegal bludger
attack so his nerves were on edge. Even after all of that, Harry still
tried to restrain George from going after Draco until Draco rounded on
Harry with the cruelest insult he could throw at him. Draco wanted Harry
to attack him and did whatever he could to provoke the attack.

&gt; Such moments are rare.  The House Feud at Hogwarts is a savage Gang
&gt; War, not a sportsmanlike rivalry.  Any moral rules that are introduced
&gt; by the heroes are instantly violated by their own behavior.  Sirius in
&gt; particular imparts moral lessons without noticing he does not live by
&gt; them, a point Rowling emphasized in interview.  Gryffindor teacher
&gt; &quot;Moody&quot; severely punishes Slytherin Draco for attacking from behind,
&gt; and the Trio seemingly approve.  But when the Twins attack the
&gt; Slytherin Trio from behind later in the same book, none of the heroes
&gt; object.  Draco's speech about pure-bloodedness rankles insecure newbie
&gt; Harry in the first book, but Hagrid comforts him by explaining that
&gt; the Malfoy's are all &quot;bad blood&quot;.  It isn't that one side are bigots
&gt; and some are not, but that each chooses the form of bigotry that
&gt; aggrandizes one's self and one's friends.  Dumbledore makes
&gt; politically correct speeches about werewolves and giants and Muggles
&gt; and other Blood bigotry.  But his idea of a compliment to a Slytherin
&gt; is to suggest that he should have been in Gryffindor - a &quot;Very white
&gt; of you, Kingsley&quot; sort of remark.

&gt; The use of humor to cover up evildoing is also a repeated theme,
&gt; related to the above hypocrisy.  For both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; guys, what
&gt; is evil when THEY do it is a joke when WE do it.  The House Elf heads
&gt; on the walls indicate Dark Wizardry to Harry at Grimmauld Place, but
&gt; it is all good fun when the Twins use a living but petrified garden
&gt; gnome as a Christmas tree ornament.  The Twins attack-for-fun on
&gt; Dudley is quickly followed by the Death Eaters attack-for-fun on a
&gt; Muggle family.  It is cruel when Aunt Marge sets her dog on little
&gt; Harry, but &quot;a highly amusing joke&quot; to set a deadly werewolf on Snape.
&gt; It is bullying when Draco jinxes Neville, but a joke when Harry jinxes
&gt; random students in the halls.  It is cruel when Dudley and his little
&gt; pals shove Harry's head in a toilet and laugh, but a joke when a
&gt; similar experience leaves Montague brain-damaged.  Shortly, after the
&gt; ferret incident, the class screams with laughter as Moody uses the
&gt; Imperius Curse on a spider.  Moody snaps:  &quot;Funny, is it?  You'd like
&gt; it, I suppose, if I did it to you.&quot;  The class shuts up.  What they
&gt; don't do is reflect on how this principle applies to their out-of-
&gt; class behavior.

&gt; I like Harry's face-off against fellow-hypocrite Narcissa Malfoy in
&gt; HBP.  Narcissa has no beef with what her husband does to muggles for
&gt; fun, but she sure doesn't like Harry treating her son the same way.
&gt; Harry was willing to reduce Draco to a bloody spot on the Quiddich
&gt; green for insulting his mother, but he and Ron don't mind threatening
&gt; a woman with real force.

Where exactly did Harry threaten Narcissa? He and Ron were pointing
their wands at Draco (clearly out of line) when Narcissa uttered death
threats against Harry.

&gt; When Draco breaks Harry's nose on the
&gt; Hogwarts Express shortly afterwards, Harry's hatred of Draco, as he

&gt; felt towards Harry during his similar experiences at the end of the
&gt; previous two books.  But this is a connection left to the READER to
&gt; make.  It never occurs to Harry to reflect that maybe HE should not
&gt; have kicked a helpless enemy when he was down any more than Draco
&gt; should have.

&gt; When Harry watches the victorious Draco lower his wand before the
&gt; helpless Dumbledore, we are treated to the hope that what the Hat has
&gt; been wishing for might come to pass.  That there will be some
&gt; transcendence of the pettiness, cruelty, and bigotry that has
&gt; characterized both sides.  But in the end, it is all about who has the
&gt; biggest wand after all.  The Trio return to a Hogwarts which despite
&gt; upheavals is at heart EXACTLY the same as what they left: Three Houses
&gt; (&quot;good&quot;) v. Slytherin (&quot;bad&quot;).  Harry has not much changed either,
&gt; except for the worse.  If a Slytherin spits on his Head of House, it
&gt; is the CRUCIO for them instead of a mere Levicorpus.  Harry develops
&gt; some pity for Draco, yes, and in the Room of Requirement Harry saves
&gt; Draco's life.  Nice and all, but they have have just ended up the
&gt; moral equivalent of James Potter.  Our payoff for seven books of
&gt; escalating cruelty is that yes, it continues through the next
&gt; generation, but hey it isn't lethal.

&gt; In the end, this story offers little moral reflection or moral
&gt; growth.  Harry begins and ends an impulse-driven child who does what
&gt; he feels like doing.  This is often compassionate, but if it isn't
&gt; that is too bad, because he will do it anyway.  In the NARNIA series,
&gt; the oldest boy Peter regrets that he used defending someone from a
&gt; bully as an excuse to be a spiteful bully himself. This is the sort of
&gt; reflection one would hope a youth destined to wield power (or anybody,
&gt; really) would be capable of.  Instead, Rowling gives us a &quot;hero&quot; who
&gt; preaches remorse to a SOCIOPATH (an exercise in futility if there ever
&gt; was one) but ignores the mote in his own eye.  Bartemius Crouch was
&gt; considered as bad as the Death Eaters because he condoned their
&gt; methods when under extreme duress.  Does that not make Harry -- who
&gt; used Crucio out of prideful vindictiveness -- even worse?  Are we
&gt; supposed to be happy at the man he has made of himself?

Rowling is not writing  a series of  morality tales but a story of
heroic conflict. True to life heroes are not saints and they are usually
more interested in defeating the villain than in meditating on morals.
In any real-world conflict -- be it Brtian vs. Nazi Germany, United
States vs. U.S.S.R. or the current war on terror -- you can scrutinize
the behavior of both sides in the way you compare the Gryffindors and
the Slytherins,  and conclude that there wasn't much to choose between
them. This is the nature of conflict. To win, you have to be prepared to
kill or at least harm your enemies. Tempers run high and moral
compromises are made. When it is all over, you get not the New Jerusalem
but a society more or less like the one you had before.

Yet your defense of Book 7 is that it's lameness is didactic and
morally instructive.

That seems to be the modern attitude, though.  Seemingly LORD OF THE
RINGS, or stories where the characters wise up or attain moral growth
are &quot;pounding it in with a sledgehammer&quot;.  Even if it is plausible,
realistic, earned, and completely true to the character.  Writers who
serve up moral nihilism are &quot;making us think&quot;, even if they trash
characters and plot to do it.

I would not accuse Rowling of moral nihilism (though that is how many
fans read it - and like it).  But the ridiculous moral downslide of
Harry and Co., throwing IMPERIO and CRUCIO around all of a sudden for
contrived or implausible reasons (without training yet), that is what
*I* call &quot;pounding it in with a sledgehammer&quot;.  The hero/villain
echoing, and Harry's brushes with the dark side, were BELIEVEABLE in
earlier books.  Here it is just completely contrived.

Rowling could have done WONDERFUL things with the issue of the Trio
having to use despised methods a la Crouch.  I'd have loved to have
seen them ally with a Death Eater.  I'd love to have seen a REAL break
among the trio over a serious moral issue, rather than a replay of RON
SULKS LIKE A FIVE YEAR OLD from Book 4.  Rowling just heaps on the
Moral Downsliding, devoid of characterization or craftsmanship or
point, just to make the ham-handed point that We Are All Sinners,
which anyone with half a brain figured out from the pigs tail incident
in Book One.  Six books of wincing through PAINFUL viciousness, and
Book 7 gives us not growth or trancendence, but more of the same, only
now no longer even plausible.

But that is how authors pretend to be &quot;deep&quot; these days.  It is easier
than writing a good ending to a story.

rationalization used by Dudley to justify the fact that he and his
friends used superior force on Mark Evans.  &quot;He cheeked me&quot; is
Dudley's justification for ganging up on a ten-year-old.  Or as
another might say, &quot;he wanted Dudley to attack him and did everything
he could to provoke the attack.&quot;

This is another example of &quot;mirroring&quot; that Rowling uses.  &quot;Draco
provoked us&quot; is the defense used by Harry and George, &quot;He cheeked me&quot;
is the defense used by Dudley about Mark Evans.  Both of them are
acting this way, of course, because they are very abused and angry
children, in Harry's case under extreme stress which made his behavior
highly plausible.

That does not somehow change the definition of what they did to
anything other than &quot;severe retributive violence&quot;.  Nor does it make
it right.

Could anybody who has different moral values on this point kindly step
up and plonk me.

You may not like it but that is the nature of conflict. heroes who spend
too much time in self-examination in the heat of battle usually end up
dead. Harry crosses a moral line when he casts the cruciatis curse and
doesn't spend any time consciously worrying about it. However, it is not
correct to suggest that he does not learn humility. After this incident,
he learns to regard both Snape and Dumbledore, whom he had previously
judged very harshly, with new trust and understanding.

There is also the much maligned epilogue where Harry has had 19 years of
peace to reflect on his experiences. We see him trying to put a damper
on the spirit of house rivalry by telling his younger son not to worry
if he is sorted into Slytherin. Boys don't turn into wise and virtuous
men over the course of a few months. It is a process that lasts a
lifetime and with Harry it is well underway.

&quot;Torture as Payback for Spitting is Overkill&quot; requires how much Deep
Reflection?

As a history buff with a particular interest in people engaged in
&quot;Resistance&quot; (a very messy business), I can tell you that I know the
difference between &quot;the nature of confict&quot;, and a contrived and stupid
attempt by an author to force a morally suspect point.

I also can tell the difference between a soldier acting out of
necessity of war, and a bully USING &quot;It is War&quot; to dispense with those
nasty morals and societal rules he never wanted anyway.

My moral value system includes an understanding that verbal abuse can be
as damaging as physical violence. For a 15 year old boy, an insult can
cause more lasting pain than a punch in the stomach. Harry has a major
problem with self-control but he is not a bully. A good teacher like
McGonagall sees this and tries to deal with it appropriately.
Unfortunately, schools and society in general have more difficulty
regulating purely verbal abuse.  A bully like Draco knows this and
manipulates the system to his advantage. I see a large moral difference
between someone who commits an act of physical violence under serious
stress and someone who deliberately sets out to inflict pain and stress
through words.

I think you are missing a key point here. In the instances you mention
(Dudley reporting on his beating-up a small boy, and Harry attacking
Draco after a quidditch match), it is made very clear who are the
bullies both times. In the first place, there is Dudley and his gang,
bored, big, strong bullies, who wanted some excitement, so they
manufacture a &quot;cheek&quot; so they can beat up a much younger and weaker
boy and not feel too bad about it. In the second place, you have Draco
Malfoy, a weak, intelligent spoiled brat who has just lost a game,
partly because of his own ineptitude. The hired muscle he usually uses
is currently unavailable, but that doesn't matter, because he knows
how to hurt people with words. He tries hurting the Weasleys in such a
manner that is not recognised as hurting by the authorities, in the
hope that they will try and hurt him in a way that is recognised as
such, and be punished for it. But Harry is there to hold at least one
of them back. So, as Harry is a higher-priority &quot;target&quot;, Draco
switches his verbal attack to Harry. There is no-one available to hold
Harry back when he snaps and attacks Draco. Hence, Draco provokes
Harry to attack him, so that they will be punished. It is a very
common tactic of bullies, and the fact that you seem to be so
dismissive of it hints that you yourself were never bullied. The
difference between Draco and Dudley is that Draco knows of this tactic
and can employ it successfully (hurting someone verbally until they
can no longer restrain themselves from physically hurting the bully,
and being punished for it by a nearby authority figure), whereas
Dudley is limited to waiting until a target is out of range of
authority and then hurting them physically. It does not make Harry a
bully, it just demonstrates his poor judgement and control of his
temper.

I'm not going to plonk you. I don't think our moral values differ
*that* much - just our understanding of context and blame. However, if
you're so desperate to be plonked, may I suggest that you leave the
group, and save everyone the trouble?

&gt; As a history buff with a particular interest in people engaged in
&gt; &quot;Resistance&quot; (a very messy business), I can tell you that I know the

&gt; I also can tell the difference between a soldier acting out of
&gt; necessity of war, and a bully USING &quot;It is War&quot; to dispense with those
&gt; nasty morals and societal rules he never wanted anyway.

One point you neglected to mention is that Harry's victim had himself
rewritten the rules. Amycus Carrow had spent the last year using the
Cruciatis curse on students who had earned detentions and teaching other
students to use it.  A few moments before Harry attacked, he had been
threatening to us it on innocent students. One presumes that the
Ministry of Magic had suspended the penalties against using it.  It
wasn't just payback for spitting. It was payback for a whole year of
torturing others. This does not excuse Harry's behavior, the enemy does
it too is not a defence under the laws of war, but it is a very strong
mitigating circumstance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Draco's lowering of his wand proves the crowning grace note of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; series where the predominant morality of both good and bad seems
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be use of brute force to seek power and status for one's self
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and friends.  Loyalty to one's own House and Family are the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; predominant virtues.  &quot;Honor&quot; is defended with force: An insult
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to a boy's mother can result in severe two-on-one retributive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; violence, and docking House points was once avenged with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attempted murder (in both cases, &quot;Good Guy&quot; behavior).  Draco's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; submission was a rare moment of Strength yielding to Morality,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come over the the RIGHT side, not the stronger one.  A similar
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grace note was struck, albeit humorously, when Hermione Granger
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; slapped Draco in POA.  Draco and Co. had been looking for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fight, but instead received a moral rebuke, causing them to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unexpectedly back off.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your comment on &quot;severe retributive violence&quot; shows a serious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lack
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of perspective.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; More like &quot;lack of euphemistic doublespeaking&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Harry was responding to deliberate and premeditated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; provocation from Draco and his friends.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And he responded with severe retributive violence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Slytherins had been taunting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ron for the whole match. Harry had just been hit with an illegal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bludger attack so his nerves were on edge.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which caused him to respond with severe retributive violence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Even after all of that, Harry still
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tried to restrain George from going after Draco

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tried to restrain George from administering severe retributive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; violence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; until Draco rounded on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Harry with the cruelest insult he could throw at him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Insulted his mommy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Draco wanted Harry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to attack him and did whatever he could to provoke the attack.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Everyone who uses superior force on someone weaker uses the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fatuous defense.  &quot;He/she (provoked/asked for/wanted it) by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (hurting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my precious little feelings/looking at me funny/turning me on) and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FORCING me to (defend myself/teach him a lesson/fuck her)&quot;.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't like hearing such garbage outside of criminology case
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; studies, so cut it out.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now back to the POTTERVERSE.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The above rationalization for the attack on Draco is an example
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rationalization used by Dudley to justify the fact that he and his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; friends used superior force on Mark Evans.  &quot;He cheeked me&quot; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dudley's justification for ganging up on a ten-year-old.  Or as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another might say, &quot;he wanted Dudley to attack him and did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything he could to provoke the attack.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is another example of &quot;mirroring&quot; that Rowling uses.  &quot;Draco
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; provoked us&quot; is the defense used by Harry and George, &quot;He cheeked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is the defense used by Dudley about Mark Evans.  Both of them are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; acting this way, of course, because they are very abused and angry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; children, in Harry's case under extreme stress which made his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; behavior highly plausible.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That does not somehow change the definition of what they did to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything other than &quot;severe retributive violence&quot;.  Nor does it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make it right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Could anybody who has different moral values on this point kindly

&gt;&gt;&gt; My moral value system includes an understanding that verbal abuse

Very good points. You saved me a lot of time.

One significant point you neglected to mention that while Dudley shows
some signs of remorse and reform, there is no similar suggestion of
change in Draco. Physical bullies usually outgrow their tendency when
they reach adulthood (although sometimes it may resurface as domestic
violence).  On the other hand, verbal bullies can continue to indulge in
their vice for their whole life.

So your position is that anybody who has experienced verbal harassment

But you are incorrect.  I was verbally bullied quite often.  Twice it
was by gangs who engaged in systematic harassment that was usually not
physical (not till I got off school grounds anyway).  That is not even
counting ordinary everyday classroom bad-mouthing.  Don't get me

Further, I have often argued right here on this newsgroup against the
position that bullying is all good fun as long as it doesn't
physically damage anybody.  The difference between my position THEN
and yours NOW, is that when I argued against verbal abuse, I was NOT
trying to justify PHYSICAL abuse.

Your position seems to be (?) that Draco's verbal provocation
justified a two-on-one physical assault -- including a weapon (the
metal snitch) -- that continued long after Draco was down on the
ground and a bloody pulp.  If this is really your position, I don't
think either of us, or the NG either, will benefit from further
discussion.

I failed to mention a lot of things which are not relevant.  If Harry

The problem, though, with a lot of posts is that they assume the
subtitle for this thread is &quot;WHY HARRY POTTER IS THE ANTICHRIST&quot;,
rather than &quot;WHY I HATED BOOK SEVEN&quot;.

So in Book 7, Harry remains a childish jerk with dangerous adult
power, but he has a lot of six year old EXCUSES to justify it.  &quot;The
other guy started it&quot;  &quot;Yes, the good guys are pretty bad, but the bad
guys are worse.&quot;  &quot;Now, it's not like he killed anybody&quot;.  Etc.

What can I say?  I agree.  He's not the Antichrist.  He had a really
bad childhood, so what do you expect?  He could have turned out a lot
worse.  Maybe he'll go on torturing people when he becomes an Auror,
but he probably won't outright MURDER anybody.

That really isn't my idea of a payoff, though.  It's lame and wishy
washy, neither a triumph over evil, or a tragic fall to evil.  It just
has everyone take their banal dreary petty HIGH SCHOOL EVIL and drag
it all into adulthood with them.

Verbal abuse, including language inappropriate to the situation, which
would normally cause an average person to react in a violent way is
called 'inciting to riot', and is illegal, at least in THIS political
environment.  It appears, from numerous, situations in the books, that
such a law doesn't exist in the UK, at least among the wizarding
community.  Certainly the teachers openly allow such abuse by Malfoy in
a number of cases.  In my area, he would be severely punished for his
mouth, IF he didn't end up in the hospital.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We are finished with this discussion.  I humbly repeat my
&gt;&gt;&gt; request for you to plonk me.

&gt;&gt; I think you are missing a key point here. In the instances
&gt;&gt; you mention (Dudley reporting on his beating-up a small
&gt;&gt; boy, and Harry attacking Draco after a quidditch match), it
&gt;&gt; is made very clear who are the
&gt;&gt; bullies both times. In the first place, there is Dudley and his
&gt;&gt; gang, bored, big, strong bullies, who wanted some
&gt;&gt; excitement, so they manufacture a &quot;cheek&quot; so they can
&gt;&gt; beat up a much younger and weaker boy and not feel too
&gt;&gt; bad about it.

&gt; There is no evidence that Mark did not cheek them, and no decent
&gt; adult
&gt; hearing about the incident would care for a SECOND whether Mark
&gt; &quot;cheeked&quot; Dudley or not.  You seem to care.  Are you saying that
&gt; Dudley would be justified in beating a MOUTHY ten-year-old?
">

There is also no evidence that Mark did cheek them, just Dudley's
word, and we know how reliable that is. I am saying that Dudley and
his gang manufactured a justification for their actions - a
justification that does not stand up under any sort of scrutiny.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In the second place, you have Draco
&gt;&gt; Malfoy, a weak, intelligent spoiled brat who has just lost a
&gt;&gt; game, partly because of his own ineptitude. The hired
&gt;&gt; muscle he usually uses is currently unavailable, but that
&gt;&gt; doesn't matter,

&gt; Gee, it will in a moment . . .

&gt;&gt; because he knows how to hurt people with
&gt;&gt; words. He tries hurting the Weasleys in such a
&gt;&gt; manner that is not recognised as hurting by the authorities,
&gt;&gt; in the hope that they will try and hurt him in a way that is
&gt;&gt; recognised as such, and be punished for it. But Harry is
&gt;&gt; there to hold at least one
&gt;&gt; of them back. So, as Harry is a higher-priority &quot;target&quot;,
&gt;&gt; Draco switches his verbal attack to Harry. There is no-one
&gt;&gt; available to hold Harry back when he snaps and attacks
&gt;&gt; Draco. Hence, Draco provokes Harry to attack him, so that
&gt;&gt; they will be punished. It is a very
&gt;&gt; common tactic of bullies, and the fact that you seem to be
&gt;&gt; so dismissive of it hints that you yourself were never bullied.

&gt; So your position is that anybody who has experienced verbal
&gt; harassment
&gt; would NATURALLY condone a two-on-one assault against a classmate as
&gt; a
&gt; way of shutting him up?
">

No, my position is that someone who has been verbally bullied is less
likely to be able to restrain themselves from taking physical revenge.
The fact that it ends up as two-on-one is irrelevant - if Fred had
broken free of Harry's restraint before Draco had insulted Harry's
mother, it would have still have reslted in &quot;severe retributive
violence&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But you are incorrect.  I was verbally bullied quite often.  Twice

&gt; even
&gt; counting ordinary everyday classroom bad-mouthing.  Don't get me

Right. I do not know anything about you, other than what you post and
what can be deduced from your posts. Sometimes those deductions are
wrong. I too was bullied, both physically and verbally, and since then
it has been my experience that those who discount verbal bullying have
never been on the receiving end of it themselves.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Further, I have often argued right here on this newsgroup against
&gt; the
&gt; position that bullying is all good fun as long as it doesn't
&gt; physically damage anybody.  The difference between my position THEN
&gt; and yours NOW, is that when I argued against verbal abuse, I was NOT
&gt; trying to justify PHYSICAL abuse.
">

I am not justifying physical abuse. I am explaining how Harry
justified a physical *assault* - if he ever got to the stage of
justifying it, that is. The book makes it pretty clear that he snaps,
he is not thinking, he is letting his emotions take control. Under
those circumstances, you do not have an internal monologue going, &quot;he
insulted the thing most dear to me, he's an arrogant little twat, and
so that makes it okay for me to break his jaw,&quot; you just have one
thought, and that is &quot;KIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLL!!!!!&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Okay, first, the fact that that the assualt ended up as two-on-one is
irrelevant. If Fred had broken free before Draco insulted Harry's
mother, it would have been one-on-one (and Harry would probably have
tried to pull Fred off Draco, but Draco would have spun it so that he
was being attacked by both of them anyway). And second - a weapon? A
snitch is the size of a walnut - that's not going to add any damage to
a punch.

My position is that Harry and Fred reacted emotionally, they did not
give themselves the opportunity to justify their actions to even
themselves before attacking Draco, who provoked the reaction, who knew
he was provoking the reaction, and knew what the likely result would
be, in order to get his targets in trouble with authority. To him,
some pain and some bruises that can be magically removed in a few
minutes is worth getting two enemies a detention (or more, as it
turned out). Draco may have justified his actions to himself, but Fred
and Harry did not, and that is how they did what they did. That
doesn't make what they did right, or justifiable objectively, but it
does make what they did understandable.

Darker than would be implied even by a double murder. A story that
starts with a double murder could be a murder mystery in which chapter
one starts with the discovery of the bodies and the rest of the book
shows us how the clever, charming, and aristocratic hero sorts
everything out. Such a story need not exercise the moral sensibilities
of author, reader, or characters.

My argument is that the characters in this story are put under stresses

&gt;&gt; This is a story that takes place in a world where the
&gt;&gt; government does not have anything close to a monopoly on the use of
&gt;&gt; physical force. The Minister of Magic has less power over his subjects
&gt;&gt; than almost any Muggle government except the Narco-states. All parties
&gt;&gt; know this, and it would be true even if the Ministry was not corrupt; it
&gt;&gt; is a cause of that corruption, not its effect. Without a trustworthy
&gt;&gt; government capable of controlling its most powerful subjects, there is
&gt;&gt; no independent arbitrator to enforce law and order. And yet Harry Potter
&gt;&gt; grows up in the middle of this turmoil as a sort of Parseval; he has the
&gt;&gt; strength of ten (or in his case the power of love) because his heart is
&gt;&gt; pure. Even Harry isn't perfect - I agree that he has a filthy temper -,
&gt;&gt; but he is good without being weak, never stops trying to do the right
&gt;&gt; thing, and eventually kills the villain without becoming a murderer
&gt;&gt; himself.

&gt;Most atrocities are done by people who claim/believe think that they
&gt;are &quot;trying to do the right thing&quot; or think themselves &quot;justified&quot; --
&gt;as the series itself spends six books happily demonstrating.

&gt;The hero ends up &quot;trying to do the right thing&quot; -- and using this fact
&gt;as justification to commit TORTURE as a bit of petty vengeance (for
&gt;spitting).  That is not just &quot;dark&quot;, it is stupid.  Ending the book on
&gt;that note amounts to complete moral pessimism.

&gt;&gt; I don't require that a work of fiction function as a treatise on ethics,
&gt;&gt; and I don't believe that it says that &quot;we are all Death Eaters at
&gt;&gt; heart,&quot; but it would do us no harm to realise that enough of us are
&gt;&gt; capable of becoming Death Eaters that we need to worry about it. &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;The fact that the hero never worries about it, and learns enough
&gt;humility at least to restrain himself from the &quot;I'm the Good Guy, so I
&gt;get to torture people who Really Deserve It if I FEEL Like It&quot;
&gt;attitude -- THAT is the problem with the ending, in a nutshell.
">

Elsewhere in this thread you mention Harry's use of the cruciatus curse.
There are no situations in which that curse is justified; in the two
situations that come to mind a stunning spell or a full body bind jinx
would have been both more practical and more humane. (On Bellatrix in
OTP &quot;The only one he ever feared&quot; and on Amycus in DH: &quot;The sacking of
Severus Snape&quot;). The later use in DH is more serious and does show signs
of moral decline, rather than redemption. McGonagall does not seem to
regard it as serious, at least compared to everything else going on at
the time, which doesn't help.

That is the flawed part of Harry the flawed hero, Of course he goes on
to save the magical world (after giving Riddle one last chance for a
deathbed conversion) and to help pick up the pieces in the aftermath.
That is the hero part. I think I am not going to criticise J K Rowling
for giving us Harry for the same reason that I wouldn't criticise Harry.
The positive contribution is so great, compared with somebody who might
have been quietly inoffensive, but also ineffectual, that I am prepared
to avoid second-guessing, or judging, the negative side.

PS - just to show the difficulty of pushing a moral line through
fiction, I believe that JK Rowling was surprised and disappointed by the
number of female fans who found themselves attracted to Severus Snape or
Draco Malfoy. Recall also the complete fiasco (from this point of view)
of a film in which Kevin Costner was so blatantly politically correct
that he wrapped up the film http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102798/ and
handed it over on a silver plate to its only charismatic character, Alan
Rickman playing the Sheriff of Nottingham. I suspect that the practical
effect of a scene in which Hermione or Remus dissected the meaning of
the phrase &quot;unforgivable curse&quot; for Harry would be less than you expect.

I am sorry, but as applied to the current discussion, despite some
buried fragments of truth applied in the wrong context, you are
fundamentally wrong about almost everything you say -- particularly as
applied to the circumstances under discussion -- and are so wrong
about so many things that it is hard to know where to begin in
correcting your many misconceptions.

Discussion of legal norms has, at best, only marginal relevance to a
moral discussion.  Legality and morality do not necessarily coincide.
That said, however, let us proceed with the discussion of the law ....

I will start by discussing the law of justification for assault.
Under the criminal law of virtually every western democratic nation
(and very likely -- the non-western non-democratic nations as well&quot;)
&quot;he insulted my mommy&quot; is not an excuse or a justification for an
assault.  The law tolerates no other justification for attacking
someone except imminent self defense or defense of others.  Self
defense requires an immediate and substantial fear of immediate
physical attack by a non-aggressor -- it does not under ANY
circumstances involve the right to retaliate physically for hurt
feelings induced by insults.  Provocation MAY under some circumstances
be a mitigating factor.  For instance, if your wife hurts your
feelings by sleeping with your best friend, and after you walk inon
them, they both taunt you and laugh at you and insult your sexual
prowess, and you lose your cool completely stab them both to death,
and you sob to the judge and jury that you were provoked and could not
help it, the jury may convict you of &quot;heat of passion&quot; manslaughter
instead of murder, and the judge may give you 15 years instead of
life.  But MITIGATION is never the same thing as JUSTIFICATION.

We could end the discussion there, because that it the only legal
discussion that is relevant here.  After all, no-one argued that Draco
was morally (or even legally) justified in insulting anyone's mommy.
It was only argued that Harry was NOT morally justified in assaulting
Draco in retaliation.  Anyone familiar with the  phrase &quot;two wrongs do
not make a right&quot; will see no possiblity of contradiction here -- the
two moral issues -- or two legal issues -- are entirely
independent. .  Harry, in attacking Draco, was not only morally wrong,
but he was also committing an act which, if committed by an adult,
would be considered a criminal act that would probably be punishable
by a short prison term.  Here in New York, the crime would be &quot;Assault
in the 3rd Degree&quot; and the punishment would be (for adults) a maximum
1 year in jail, but all other jurisdictions have similarly-named
crimes with roughly similar punishments.  If Harry were prosecuted (as
an adult) for such a crime it would be no defense -- none at all --
that Draco insulted Harry's parents.

To illustrate the &quot;two wrongs do not make a right&quot; principle, let's
tell the following hypothetical -- Scorpius insults Albus's parents.
Albus gets mad, raises his fist to go take a swing at Scorpius.
Scorpius sees Ablus coming at him with flailing fists, gets scared,
pulls out a knife to defend himself &amp; stabs Albus in the arm.  Albus,
seeing that he is bleeding and seeing the knife in Scorpius's hands,
pulls out a 44 magnum and shoots Scorpius 4 times in the head and
chest.  Scorpius, miraculously, manages to survive, and manages to
disable Albus with a Petrificus Totalis.  Scorpius then reloads
Albus's 44 magnum and shoots the helpless Albus 4 times in the head.

Which of these acts were LEGAL?  None of them, except the petrificus
totalis and (under freedom of speech principles) the original
insult.   Which of these acts were MORAL?  Only the petrificus
totalis.  If both idiots survive their wounds, the State would be
perfectly justified in charging them both with attempted murder and
locking them up for the protection of society.

It was illegal for Albus to attempt to punch Scorpius.

Notwithstanding Albus's illegal punch, it was illegal for Scorpius to
stab Albus.  Even when you are subject to an illegal assault, you may
not escalate to deadly force.  One may not resort to deadly force
unless one is in reasonable fear of one's life.  A reasonable fear of
a black eye or a bloody nose does not justify resort to the use of a
deadly weapon such as a gun or knife.

Notwithstanding Scorpius's illegal use of deadly force, it was illegal
for Albus to shoot Scorpius.  Why?  Because the justification of &quot;self
defense&quot; does not work for someone who is an original physical
aggressor.  After having initiated the physical assault, Albus does
not regain the right to self defense until and unless he makes some
attempt to retreat or withdraw from the combat.

Notwithstanding Albus's illegal shooting of Scorpius, it was illegal
for Scorpius to shoot Albus. Why?  Because by the time Scorpius shot
Albus, Albus was completely helpless.  It was now merely revenge, and
no longer imminent self defense.

Now, although it is not relevant, let us turn to the independent issue
of your misconceptions regarding freedom of speech, and when the state
may, or may not, punish verbal abuse.

It is absolutely NOT true that &quot;verbal abuse&quot; is generally illegal in
western nations.  Virtually all western democracies recognize &quot;freedom
of speech&quot; as an important right, and regard protecting this right as
so important that a large degree of immoral, vile and insulting
conduct must be protected so as to ensure that the right is not
compromised and that government is not given too much power to punish
its enemies.  In the United States for instance, this right comes
under the purview of the First Amendment of the Consitution.  Because
of the strictures of the First Amendment, free speech is protected
even more strongly in the  United States than almost any other western
nation, including the UK.

This right is subject to a number of VERY NARROWLY CONSTRUED
exceptions, none of which are applicable here.

&quot;Incitement to Riot&quot;, or incitement to any other illegal activity,
merely reflects the idea that it is illegal to actually encourage and
advocate the commission of crimes.  Again, this is very narrowly
construed.  For instance, you could not be convicted of &quot;incitement to
assault&quot; merely because you just written a post that attempts to
justify illegal assaults against people who insult you.  However, if
you said to your buddy, &quot;let's go out and assault someone&quot; and you
then just stood by and watched while he beat up someone else, you
could be convicted as an accomplice simply because you encouraged
him.  However, in the United States at least, it remains legal for
communists and anarchists to preach the ultimate necessity of the
violent overthrow of government, provided they do not advocate that it
be done right away.

Another exception is the &quot;fighting words&quot; doctrine, which is probably
what you had in mind when you mentioned &quot;incitement to riot&quot;.  Again,
this is very narrowly construed, and just because something qualifies
as &quot;fighting words&quot; in some broad sense, does not necessarily mean it
will not be protected under the First Amendment.  It is NOT legal for
Bill Clinton to send the FBI to beat you up just because you say mean
things about his wife Hillary, and it is NOT legal for Harry to beat
up Draco just because Draco expresses a negative opinion of Harry's
parents.  Both forms of speech are fully protected under the First
Amendment.

Please not that, even when the &quot;fighting words&quot; doctrine is
applicable, and where the conduct is judged to be so extreme that it
is not protected by the First Amendment, and gives the Goverment the
right to arrest and punish the insulter, it does not give the insulted
person the right to attack the insulter.  That remains a completely
illegal assault.

But you mention this in the context of the right of School Officials
to punish foul-mouthed students by expelling them.  In a private
school, this is not an issue, because the First Amendment only limits
the conduct of government.  Private Schools, however, may only expel
foul-mouthed students -- not assault them or condone illegal assaults
against them.  In a government-run school, however, such an expulsion
is a government-punishment, and is therefore limited by the First
Amendment.  The Supreme Court has ruled that, because of legitimate
educational concerns, the First Amendment has somewhat less protection
in the context of a school attempting to maintain order among its
students.  It does not have NO protection, however, and it is at the
very least arguable that, if Draco and Harry were attending an
American Public School together, Draco would have every right to tell
Harry what he thinks of Harry's parents, and school officials would
have no right, under the First Amendment, to punish Draco in any way.

In the UK, school officials probably have a much broader right to
punish student speech.  But again, this does not mean that anyone has
the power to condone of justify physical assaults that are not
motivated by imminent self defense.

To some extent you may have a point.  Many people who advocate moral
courage from the safety of their armchairs may find that, in the
stress of battle (so to speak) they fail the test.

On the other hand, such people are certainly more likely to pass the
test, in the heat of battle, than those who, from the safety of their
armchairs, advocate moral cowardice.

And I see no reason to cut any slack to those who, from the safety of
their armchairs, advocate moral cowardice.  After all, they have no
excuse at all.

Now that the series is over, I have to agree that the problem with the
Harry Potter series is not that it fails to forgive its flawed heroes
for their crimes, but rather that it goes too far in justifying
and condoning their conduct itself.  I would have been happier if this
book, aimed at children, had upheld higher moral standards -- and I
don't mean I wanted perfect goody 2-shoes heros.  I knew perfectly
well I did not have that -- and I still thought that Book 7 would
justify the series.  But in the end, JK Rowling let me down.

&gt;discussion that is relevant here.  After all, no-one argued that Draco
&gt;was morally (or even legally) justified in insulting anyone's mommy.
&gt;It was only argued that Harry was NOT morally justified in assaulting
&gt;Draco in retaliation.  Anyone familiar with the  phrase &quot;two wrongs do
&gt;not make a right&quot; will see no possiblity of contradiction here -- the
&gt;two moral issues -- or two legal issues -- are entirely
&gt;independent. .  Harry, in attacking Draco, was not only morally wrong,
&gt;but he was also committing an act which, if committed by an adult,
&gt;would be considered a criminal act that would probably be punishable
&gt;by a short prison term.  Here in New York, the crime would be &quot;Assault
&gt;in the 3rd Degree&quot; and the punishment would be (for adults) a maximum
&gt;1 year in jail, but all other jurisdictions have similarly-named
&gt;crimes with roughly similar punishments.  If Harry were prosecuted (as
&gt;an adult) for such a crime it would be no defense -- none at all --
&gt;that Draco insulted Harry's parents.

&gt;To illustrate the &quot;two wrongs do not make a right&quot; principle, let's
&gt;tell the following hypothetical -- Scorpius insults Albus's parents.
&gt;Albus gets mad, raises his fist to go take a swing at Scorpius.
&gt;Scorpius sees Ablus coming at him with flailing fists, gets scared,
&gt;pulls out a knife to defend himself &amp; stabs Albus in the arm.  Albus,
&gt;seeing that he is bleeding and seeing the knife in Scorpius's hands,
&gt;pulls out a 44 magnum and shoots Scorpius 4 times in the head and
&gt;chest.  Scorpius, miraculously, manages to survive, and manages to
&gt;disable Albus with a Petrificus Totalis.  Scorpius then reloads
&gt;Albus's 44 magnum and shoots the helpless Albus 4 times in the head.

&gt;Which of these acts were LEGAL?  None of them, except the petrificus
&gt;totalis and (under freedom of speech principles) the original
&gt;insult.   Which of these acts were MORAL?  Only the petrificus
&gt;totalis.  If both idiots survive their wounds, the State would be
&gt;perfectly justified in charging them both with attempted murder and
&gt;locking them up for the protection of society.

&gt;It was illegal for Albus to attempt to punch Scorpius.

&gt;Notwithstanding Albus's illegal punch, it was illegal for Scorpius to
&gt;stab Albus.  Even when you are subject to an illegal assault, you may
&gt;not escalate to deadly force.  One may not resort to deadly force
&gt;unless one is in reasonable fear of one's life.  A reasonable fear of
&gt;a black eye or a bloody nose does not justify resort to the use of a
&gt;deadly weapon such as a gun or knife.

&gt;Notwithstanding Scorpius's illegal use of deadly force, it was illegal
&gt;for Albus to shoot Scorpius.  Why?  Because the justification of &quot;self
&gt;defense&quot; does not work for someone who is an original physical
&gt;aggressor.  After having initiated the physical assault, Albus does
&gt;not regain the right to self defense until and unless he makes some
&gt;attempt to retreat or withdraw from the combat.

&gt;Notwithstanding Albus's illegal shooting of Scorpius, it was illegal
&gt;for Scorpius to shoot Albus. Why?  Because by the time Scorpius shot
&gt;Albus, Albus was completely helpless.  It was now merely revenge, and
&gt;no longer imminent self defense.

&gt;Now, although it is not relevant, let us turn to the independent issue
&gt;of your misconceptions regarding freedom of speech, and when the state
&gt;may, or may not, punish verbal abuse.

&gt;It is absolutely NOT true that &quot;verbal abuse&quot; is generally illegal in
&gt;western nations.  Virtually all western democracies recognize &quot;freedom
&gt;of speech&quot; as an important right, and regard protecting this right as
&gt;so important that a large degree of immoral, vile and insulting
&gt;conduct must be protected so as to ensure that the right is not
&gt;compromised and that government is not given too much power to punish
&gt;its enemies.  In the United States for instance, this right comes
&gt;under the purview of the First Amendment of the Consitution.  Because
&gt;of the strictures of the First Amendment, free speech is protected
&gt;even more strongly in the  United States than almost any other western
&gt;nation, including the UK.

&gt;This right is subject to a number of VERY NARROWLY CONSTRUED
&gt;exceptions, none of which are applicable here.

&gt;&quot;Incitement to Riot&quot;, or incitement to any other illegal activity,
&gt;merely reflects the idea that it is illegal to actually encourage and
&gt;advocate the commission of crimes.  Again, this is very narrowly
&gt;construed.  For instance, you could not be convicted of &quot;incitement to
&gt;assault&quot; merely because you just written a post that attempts to
&gt;justify illegal assaults against people who insult you.  However, if
&gt;you said to your buddy, &quot;let's go out and assault someone&quot; and you
&gt;then just stood by and watched while he beat up someone else, you
&gt;could be convicted as an accomplice simply because you encouraged
&gt;him.  However, in the United States at least, it remains legal for
&gt;communists and anarchists to preach the ultimate necessity of the
&gt;violent overthrow of government, provided they do not advocate that it
&gt;be done right away.

&gt;Another exception is the &quot;fighting words&quot; doctrine, which is probably
&gt;what you had in mind when you mentioned &quot;incitement to riot&quot;.  Again,
&gt;this is very narrowly construed, and just because something qualifies
&gt;as &quot;fighting words&quot; in some broad sense, does not necessarily mean it
&gt;will not be protected under the First Amendment.  It is NOT legal for
&gt;Bill Clinton to send the FBI to beat you up just because you say mean
&gt;things about his wife Hillary, and it is NOT legal for Harry to beat
&gt;up Draco just because Draco expresses a negative opinion of Harry's
&gt;parents.  Both forms of speech are fully protected under the First
&gt;Amendment.

&gt;Please not that, even when the &quot;fighting words&quot; doctrine is
&gt;applicable, and where the conduct is judged to be so extreme that it
&gt;is not protected by the First Amendment, and gives the Goverment the
&gt;right to arrest and punish the insulter, it does not give the insulted
&gt;person the right to attack the insulter.  That remains a completely
&gt;illegal assault.

&gt;But you mention this in the context of the right of School Officials
&gt;to punish foul-mouthed students by expelling them.  In a private
&gt;school, this is not an issue, because the First Amendment only limits
&gt;the conduct of government.  Private Schools, however, may only expel
&gt;foul-mouthed students -- not assault them or condone illegal assaults
&gt;against them.  In a government-run school, however, such an expulsion
&gt;is a government-punishment, and is therefore limited by the First
&gt;Amendment.  The Supreme Court has ruled that, because of legitimate
&gt;educational concerns, the First Amendment has somewhat less protection
&gt;in the context of a school attempting to maintain order among its
&gt;students.  It does not have NO protection, however, and it is at the
&gt;very least arguable that, if Draco and Harry were attending an
&gt;American Public School together, Draco would have every right to tell
&gt;Harry what he thinks of Harry's parents, and school officials would
&gt;have no right, under the First Amendment, to punish Draco in any way.

&gt;In the UK, school officials probably have a much broader right to
&gt;punish student speech.  But again, this does not mean that anyone has
&gt;the power to condone of justify physical assaults that are not
&gt;motivated by imminent self defense.

Thank you for a discussion rather than trying to start and argument or
name call.  That's what would be nice to see on this

That was back in book 4.  The rest of the students did get chewed out

&gt;&gt; &gt;He is shocked to observe some bad behavior of the Marauders - but
&gt;&gt; &gt;he himself is just as guilty.  He too bullies like James did, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;he too

It's a first novel.  It's a really long one, but it is still a plotline

&gt; I am sorry, but as applied to the current discussion, despite some
&gt; buried fragments of truth applied in the wrong context, you are
&gt; fundamentally wrong about almost everything you say -- particularly as
&gt; applied to the circumstances under discussion -- and are so wrong
&gt; about so many things that it is hard to know where to begin in
&gt; correcting your many misconceptions.

&gt; Discussion of legal norms has, at best, only marginal relevance to a
&gt; moral discussion.  Legality and morality do not necessarily coincide.
&gt; That said, however, let us proceed with the discussion of the law ....

&gt; I will start by discussing the law of justification for assault.
&gt; Under the criminal law of virtually every western democratic nation
&gt; (and very likely -- the non-western non-democratic nations as well&quot;)
&gt; &quot;he insulted my mommy&quot; is not an excuse or a justification for an
&gt; assault.  The law tolerates no other justification for attacking
&gt; someone except imminent self defense or defense of others.  Self
&gt; defense requires an immediate and substantial fear of immediate
&gt; physical attack by a non-aggressor -- it does not under ANY
&gt; circumstances involve the right to retaliate physically for hurt
&gt; feelings induced by insults.  Provocation MAY under some circumstances
&gt; be a mitigating factor.  For instance, if your wife hurts your
&gt; feelings by sleeping with your best friend, and after you walk inon
&gt; them, they both taunt you and laugh at you and insult your sexual
&gt; prowess, and you lose your cool completely stab them both to death,
&gt; and you sob to the judge and jury that you were provoked and could not
&gt; help it, the jury may convict you of &quot;heat of passion&quot; manslaughter
&gt; instead of murder, and the judge may give you 15 years instead of
&gt; life.  But MITIGATION is never the same thing as JUSTIFICATION.

I guess that depends on where you live.  Obviously it isn't in the UK.

It's an interesting topic.  There is a double standard and, as Rowling
recently stated, Harry is certainly not a saint.  So she is aware.
There are obvious parrallels between the behaviors of the good guys
and the bad guys in just about every book.  Or, I guess they are
supposed to be obvious, otherwise, we could worry about what message
Jo intends to be sending.

I do think it is easier for a kid to empathize with a kid who gets
angry and reacts than with a perfect angel.  It certainly makes the
books more interesting to read.  What concerns me is that none of the
characters in the story point out the double standard.  And, that in
spite of everything, we manage to have a perfect fairy tale ending
where everyone Harry loves either survives or will be seen again in an
afterlife that Harry is certain of.  and, if he wants to see them
sooner, there is a good chance he can recover the stone he left in
Aragog's lair.  In the meantime, the end of Voldemort justifies all
those sins sins he committed and all is forgiven.

I don't know the details of UK school law but my impression of Hogwarts
is that it is much less legalistic than schools are today. Student
misbehavior is dealt with by the teachers at their discretion without
too much regard for strict rule of law. In practice, the results seems
to be more or less the same as between students. Physical violence is
punished but verbal abuse is ignored.

On a moral level, slightly different principles apply. There moral basis
to distinguish between hurtful words and hurtful acts. I generally agree
that there are good reasons for not attempting to regulate hurtful
speech by law however these are largely pragmatic. It is often difficult
to distinguish between &quot;hate speech&quot; and controversial opinions.
However, this does not alter the fact that the pain of an insult can
linger long after the pain of a punch fades.

&gt; To some extent you may have a point.  Many people who advocate moral

&gt; stress of battle (so to speak) they fail the test.

&gt; On the other hand, such people are certainly more likely to pass the

&gt; armchairs, advocate moral cowardice.

&gt; And I see no reason to cut any slack to those who, from the safety of
&gt; their armchairs, advocate moral cowardice.  After all, they have no
&gt; excuse at all.

&gt; Now that the series is over, I have to agree that the problem with the
&gt; Harry Potter series is not that it fails to forgive its flawed heroes
&gt; for their crimes, but rather that it goes too far in justifying
&gt; and condoning their conduct itself.  I would have been happier if this
&gt; book, aimed at children, had upheld higher moral standards -- and I
&gt; don't mean I wanted perfect goody 2-shoes heros.  I knew perfectly
&gt; well I did not have that -- and I still thought that Book 7 would
&gt; justify the series.  But in the end, JK Rowling let me down.
">

I think that the last book is aimed at seventeen year olds and for that
level, the morality is perfectly appropriate. Rowling shows us a world,
much like our own, where good people sometimes do bad things. She
doesn't waste a lot of time in either passing judgment or making
excuses. She simply shows the characters as they are and lets the
readers make their own decisions.  The ultimate point is that in times
of trouble the lines between good and evil can become blurred, but they
still exist.

Anyone remember the 40's  50's or 60's when kids could be put in a
corner?  Wear a dunce cap? Be pinched or grabbed by the ear (I got
that one in second grade)?  Slapped on the knuckles with a ruler (ah
yes, the Nuns at the catholic school my sister went to and the ONE day
I went to were great at that!).  Now that was effective punishment.
Kids knew to respect their elders back then. I am not saying it's good
to give that punishment.  But I do have to wonder how the kids got the
way they are (speaking of US mostly as I am from here - Just
clarifying that).  Kids now are rude, mouthy, carry guns to schools,
there's a lot of gang fights (remember one where they killed a girl
here accidentally in a &quot;hazing&quot; incident).  It's so bad.  We didn't
have these problems back then; so could it be the methods applied
today are NOT the answer?  And yes, name calling hurts too.  Both have
consequences.  However, as contrary to what some made me out to be
before (saying I apparently condoned Snape's abuse of Harry), I don't
think kids get scarred for being rapped on the knuckles, slapped on
the behind, or grabbed by the ear.  Of course there are limits to
those things; but I don't know a soul alive that lived through these
things that was scarred for life.  If a kid is wearing an earring and
is grabbed by the earlobe now, that would be different.  Or if they
made a bruise on the child.  Or broke skin.  Likewise with name
calling.  Giving a kid self-confidence and teach them to suck it up
and know they are not what the people said, names will not hurt them.
You have to do that, because there 'll always be some immature jerk
out there who will resort to name calling (happens on this board a
lot; especially today).  Even Snape (this is where I got blasted
before); he doesn't call the kids names does he?  He picks on them and
tries to make life hard for them.  But the worst thing I remember him
saying is &quot;insufferable know it all&quot; to Hermione.  It's possible he
said worse (do tell me as I forget) but even that won't scar someone?
I think in her case, it might teach her not to be so overtly eager to
answer (and act a little smug when she gets a question right).  It's
all about balance!

It's not fun to be picked on and embarrassed in class, but perhaps if
it happened a little more often, kids wouldn't keep doing the things
they do today.  They might be more prone to stop trying to usurp
teacher authority.  I think I mentioned this before.  While in the Eye
doctors office, I spoke with this nice man in the waiting room and he
really got to me. Very memorable. I asked what he did and he said he
was an English teacher at my son's high school.  He was so down on
teaching!  Said he didn't like the kids and he really couldn't teach
because of the disruptions etc.  They basically pass kids who can't
put two sentences together because they fear the wrath of parents and
the school board.  I was very saddened to hear that.  I have to wonder
if a little punishment might be good for kids.

&gt; Most atrocities are done by people who claim/believe think that they
&gt; are &quot;trying to do the right thing&quot; or think themselves &quot;justified&quot; --
&gt; as the series itself spends six books happily demonstrating.

&gt; The hero ends up &quot;trying to do the right thing&quot; -- and using this fact
&gt; as justification to commit TORTURE as a bit of petty vengeance (for
&gt; spitting).  That is not just &quot;dark&quot;, it is stupid.  Ending the book on
&gt; that note amounts to complete moral pessimism.
">

I totally disagree with what you are saying here.  The fact that Harry used
the cruciatus curse on Amycrus does not put him in the same moral sink hole
as when Amycrus or other DE used it on other people.  DE, Belletrix,
Amycrus, Voldemort, etc used the curse to obtain information from DISARMED,
CAPTURED, and HELPLESS individuals.  They also used it as a form of
amusement.

Harry did not do anything of the sort.  Yes, he used the cruciatus curse on
Amycrus, but this does not make Harry a bad person.  Amycrus was armed with
his wand, ready for a fight. Both Harry and Amycrus were combatants in a
war, and Harry used the spell on a combatant in a conflict to essentially
take him out.  Amycrux was not a prisoner of Harry or had been disarmed by
Harry previous to the spell being cast, and Amycrus was far from helpless.
There is nothing wrong with what Harry did.  Harry did not use it to extract
information or for his amusement, nor did he continue on when Amycrus was
taken out.  Big difference.  This was a war.  Harry used a weapon/spell to
effectively take out an enemy combatant, nothing more.  I will admit that
Harry probably gained some sadistic pleasure from giving Amycrus &quot;a taste of
his own medicine&quot; for a moment.  However, Harry didn't carry on after
Amycrus was neutralized, and again, that's the big difference.

As for the Harry fighting Draco thing, yeah, I agree with you that he lost
it.  He had no excuse to do what he did and should (and was) punished IIRC,
whereas Draco seemed to get away with abuse of others with the stamp of
approval from some of the other teachers.  Frankly, I don't know of anyone
in the real world that could go through what Harry has gone through and be
on the receiving end of so much sh#t and abuse both at home and at school
without snapping.  What happened doesn't make Harry a saint, but it makes
him human.  If you want to read/watch about kids who are saint-like, rent a
cheesy disney movie or one of those old after-school-tv-specials.  Frankly,
I prefer my characters human that grow over time.

And Harry does grow.  Despite all the crap, bullsh#t and abuse he gets from
Draco, despite the fact the little creep sided with the guy who murdered his
parents, despite the fact that Draco was best buds with the teacher that
told Voldemort about the prophecy that got his parents murdered, despite the
fact that Draco insulted and abused his friends and despite the fact that
Draco's father gave the diary to Ginny in order to release the basilisk to
kill kids, in the end, Harry risks his life and the life of his best friend
to save the little ungrateful bastard.  Sounds like a growing moment to me.

In 1990, at secondary school, I was dragged by the earlobe for a few

In 1992, at a much better secondary school, I was made to stand in a

It's possible those punishments stopped being applied in the US before
the UK. It's also possible that the degeneration of children's
behaviour has accelerated exponentially in the last ten years.

Those occurrences (as were mine) were obviously memorable to you.  Do
you think they caused you severe harm?  Just curious. How are kids in
the UK behaved at school these days? Also, did you think you deserved
to be punished?  Probably not at the time I bet but now looking back,
what do you think?
In the 90's (probably the 80's as well) no way would anyone in the US
get away with grabbing a kid by their earlobe!  Kids know it too.  I
remember punishing my son once (forget exactly what the punishment
was, but probably restricting him from several privileges) and he
threatened to call social services!  LOL  Kid's are out of control a
lot of times here in the US.  Not all but a greater number than in
decades past that's for sure. I just wonder what the decline is... how
did it happen?

Thank you.  And thank you for being the one who actually gets what I
am talking about.  Everyone else thinks it is all about trying to
explain to me that poor Harry was under stress at that Quiddich game.
I know that, because that was a terrifically written scene and Rowling
made that quite clear.  It is Book 7 I am complaining about, not Book
5.

&gt; There is a double standard and, as
&gt; Rowling
&gt; recently stated, Harry is certainly not a saint.  So she is aware.
&gt; There are obvious parrallels between the behaviors of the good guys
&gt; and the bad guys in just about every book.  Or, I guess they are
&gt; supposed to be obvious, otherwise, we could worry about what message
&gt; Jo intends to be sending.

That is what I'm worried about.

&gt; I do think it is easier for a kid to empathize with a kid who gets
&gt; angry and reacts than with a perfect angel.  It certainly makes the
&gt; books more interesting to read.
">

Exactly what I was thinking Books 1 through 6.  In fact, both I and
people I know have made the same mistakes as Harry in terms of
duplicating his &quot;moral blindness&quot;.  One girl I knew was in a
situations where she had all the information to see her friends were
doing bad but she &quot;stepped on it&quot; (in her words).

So to have Rowling duplicating that with Harry's viewpoint, often
tricking the viewer into &quot;stepping on it&quot; (at least temporarily), was
VERY VERY clever.  I loved Books 1 - 6.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What concerns me is that none of the
&gt; characters in the story point out the double standard.

Except in oblique ways that Harry (and the reader who so chooses) can
easily ignore.  Or even more frequently, are LED to feel they SHOULD
easily ignore.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

YES.

&gt; Aragog's lair.  In the meantime, the end of Voldemort justifies all
&gt; those sins he committed and all is forgiven.

Don't mind forgiveness, if it comes with awareness of wrongdoing and
humility.  Instead, we have him going out to do a job in law
enforcement when he has already demonstrated a fondness for using
CRUICO when a stunner would easily do, felt no remorse, and received
no rebuke about it.

&gt; To some extent you may have a point.  Many people who advocate moral

&gt; On the other hand, such people are certainly more likely to pass the

There are some weird exceptions, in history, though.  The people who

SCREWTAPE about the English being &quot;incorrigible milksops&quot; who loudly
proclaim that torture is too good for the enemy, and then bring tea
and biscuits to downed German fighter pilots.

Harry is sometimes an example of this sort of thing (frothing at the
mouth about killing Sirius, and then saving Pettigrew, for example).
Then there is &quot;KILL MUDBLOODS . . . who ME?&quot; Draco.

One English preacher during WWII said that he has said a great many
things from the pulpit that he was very ashamed of.  Possibly, when
push came to shove, his &quot;flock&quot; was more obedient to the sort of
things he said in peacetime, and possibly they weren't.  Either way,
he didn't think it excused him saying them.  I think we can say things
that we ultimately don't mean, and have those things acted upon by
other people.

It is actually very scary to me now that we are living in a world that

I saw in HP was perfectly responsible (except for Winky).  What about
the bullying, attempted murder, dealing illegal pharmeceuticals to
young kids, and Torture?  None of this is objected to in the books
except by the rule-abiding Hermione whom the boys all slightly
disparage because she doesn't think Quiddich is God.

I really am wondering what Rowling was thinking on these points.  And
I'm wondering if anybody has asked her.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;And judging from Book 7, she expects the reader not to mind

&gt; &gt;&gt; It isn't always necessary to say it in so many words.

&gt; &gt;I disliked Book 7 because Harry failed to conquer his worst faults,

&gt; &gt;not a postscript of philosophical commentary on the ending.  Okay?

&gt; Sure.

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt; I was not clear enough: At least one student didn't /scream with
&gt; &gt;&gt; laughter./ Neville and Hermione were both very uncomfortable.

&gt; &gt;You were plenty clear.  Let me be clear.  For the sake of brevity,
&gt; &gt;I write things like &quot;The students laughed&quot; rather than &quot;most of
&gt; &gt;the students laughed and none of them felt uncomfortable about
&gt; &gt;it except for Hermione and Neville&quot;.  The distinction makes no
&gt; &gt;difference to my point, as I ALREADY told you.

&gt; That was back in book 4.  The rest of the students did get chewed

&gt; from it.

I don't have a problem with Book 4.  It is there to illustrate the
situation and the problem.  I have a problem with Book 6, where the

&gt; &gt;&gt; The point of having such an ordinary, flawed hero is that the

&gt; &gt;IF the POINT of the flawed hero is to &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;inspire&quot;, then
&gt; &gt;he should attain moral growth by the end.

&gt; That depends on what the writer is trying to teach.  JKR has a
&gt; different agenda.  I don't agree with some of her opinions either.

Whatever they are.  She seems to set up a morally compromised
situation, and has the hero buy into it, which she does very well and
very plausibly and, in B1-6, with great dramatic effectiveness.  Then
she leaves the whole situation lying around like a dead fish in Book 7
and has our heroes wander in the woods for a bit.

&gt; &gt; If he doesn't bother, but

&gt; &gt;boys!  So go right ahead and be cruel little sadists, just don't
&gt; &gt;kill anybody.&quot;

&gt; Like James, for instance.  Though his virtuous friend with the
&gt; conscience turned away from the victim, whom she had known since
&gt; childhood, because of a single word she had no doubt heard before.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Why have the hero fail the moral challenge
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;asked of the villain?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Which of the many challenges?  Which villain?

&gt; &gt;The MORAL challenge of feeling regret and remorse.  Voldemort.

&gt; What did Harry do that he was supposed to feel remorse for?
">

His eager contributions to the growing hatred and increasing nastiness
between the Houses.  Particularly, carrying his hatred of Draco well
past self-defense and into sadism on a couple of occassions.  Covering
up an attempted murder by the twins, and generally condoning bullying
as long as the &quot;cool&quot; guys do it.  His tendecy to disregard what is
right for US VERSUS THEM thinking.

What specifically triggers this remorse, or causes him to move past
this adolescent flaw, isn't important.  But it needed to happen for me
to feel he'd finally ACTUALLY become a &quot;man&quot; capable of right action
no matter what his friends do, rather than a schoolboy in a man's body
who still thinks that Gryffindors are always right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Harry observes and eventually is shocked by the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; incidents he observes.  It takes him longer than one book to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; become even close to being adult enough to be able to object.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;He is shocked to observe some bad behavior of the Marauders -
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;but he himself is just as guilty.  He too bullies like James
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;did, and he too
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;tags along with and supports the bullying of others even when it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;nearly kills somebody, as Lupin did.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't recall Harry bullying quite the same way James did.

&gt; Who did Harry bully to the point of almost causing death?
&gt; It was the Twins who shoved the Slytherin into the cabinet.
">

He is not QUITE the same as James, obviously.  But his relationship
with Draco is meant to parallel James/Snape, becomes increasingly
brutal, and nearly ends in Draco's death in Book 6.  But what I was
referring to was his condoning of the TWINS behavior -- they are the
REAL James and Sirius of this generation.

Harry is a James/Lupin mix.  Like James in 1) his rivalry with Draco
and 2) his flirtation with the &quot;Prince&quot;, who turns him into a guy who
likes jinxing people (Crabbe and Filch) in the halls for fun, as James
did.  (BTW, I know he DID feel remorse for that, which was a very good
scene, but he only wised up after he realized the Prince was
Snape).

But I think Harry is MOSTLY like Lupin.  He has a vile temper like
James, but also a good heart.  It is his tendency to turn a blind eye
to the twins which I found more disturbing.  He didn't seem aware that
there was anything wrong with them at all.

Harry was actually aware of, and afraid of, the darkness within
himself, which in itself makes that Darkness less dangerous.  I guess
my problem with Book 7 is I lost the sense that he was in any way
aware of his inner darkness any more.  People who do that become
scary.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; And he never realizes it, stops it, or grows out of it.  Yeah,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;about it, or what?

&gt; &gt;&gt; We're supposed to think about it, and maybe even worry a little,
&gt; &gt;&gt; since we're being shown a &quot;hero&quot; who does some things that we
&gt; &gt;&gt; (and others, e.g., Hermione) disapprove of.  With any luck, the
&gt; &gt;&gt; generation growing up reading HP will look at some of their
&gt; &gt;&gt; real-life heroes and be able to see that perhaps there are flaws
&gt; &gt;&gt; that ought to be addressed in their behavior, too.

&gt; &gt;If THAT was the point, then Harry should have addressed HIS flaws.

&gt; He improved to the point that he would save Draco and Goyle even
&gt; in the literal heat of battle.
">

That isn't an improvement.  Since when would he ever have killed Draco
(on purpose)?  &quot;Look, he made it through the series without becoming a
murderer&quot; is quite an acheivement for DRACO, considering his family
and situation.  From Harry I wanted more than &quot;Oh, look he is not a
murderer&quot;.  Draco was trying not to kill Harry too.  Maybe Rowling's
point was that they were a lot alike, but neither of them gets morally
any farther than did James Potter.

&gt; &gt;Harry and Co., throwing IMPERIO and CRUCIO around all of a sudden

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mouth, IF he didn't end up in the hospital.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I am sorry, but as applied to the current discussion, despite some
&gt;&gt; &gt; buried fragments of truth applied in the wrong context, you are
&gt;&gt; &gt; fundamentally wrong about almost everything you say -- particularly as
&gt;&gt; &gt; applied to the circumstances under discussion -- and are so wrong
&gt;&gt; &gt; about so many things that it is hard to know where to begin in
&gt;&gt; &gt; correcting your many misconceptions.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Discussion of legal norms has, at best, only marginal relevance to a
&gt;&gt; &gt; moral discussion.  Legality and morality do not necessarily coincide.
&gt;&gt; &gt; That said, however, let us proceed with the discussion of the law ....

&gt;&gt; &gt; I will start by discussing the law of justification for assault.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Under the criminal law of virtually every western democratic nation
&gt;&gt; &gt; (and very likely -- the non-western non-democratic nations as well&quot;)
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;he insulted my mommy&quot; is not an excuse or a justification for an
&gt;&gt; &gt; assault.  The law tolerates no other justification for attacking
&gt;&gt; &gt; someone except imminent self defense or defense of others.  Self
&gt;&gt; &gt; defense requires an immediate and substantial fear of immediate
&gt;&gt; &gt; physical attack by a non-aggressor -- it does not under ANY
&gt;&gt; &gt; circumstances involve the right to retaliate physically for hurt
&gt;&gt; &gt; feelings induced by insults.  Provocation MAY under some circumstances
&gt;&gt; &gt; be a mitigating factor.  For instance, if your wife hurts your
&gt;&gt; &gt; feelings by sleeping with your best friend, and after you walk inon
&gt;&gt; &gt; them, they both taunt you and laugh at you and insult your sexual
&gt;&gt; &gt; prowess, and you lose your cool completely stab them both to death,
&gt;&gt; &gt; and you sob to the judge and jury that you were provoked and could not
&gt;&gt; &gt; help it, the jury may convict you of &quot;heat of passion&quot; manslaughter
&gt;&gt; &gt; instead of murder, and the judge may give you 15 years instead of
&gt;&gt; &gt; life.  But MITIGATION is never the same thing as JUSTIFICATION.

&gt;&gt; I guess that depends on where you live.  Obviously it isn't in the
&gt;&gt; UK.

&gt;As I tried to explain (you don't seem to want to believe me) it does
&gt;NOT depend on where you live -- unless where you live is somewhere
&gt;really alien like some non-western non-european culture.  All common-
&gt;law jurisdictions follow more-or-less the same principles.

&gt;&gt; &gt; We could end the discussion there, because that it the only legal
&gt;&gt; &gt; discussion that is relevant here.  After all, no-one argued that Draco
&gt;&gt; &gt; was morally (or even legally) justified in insulting anyone's mommy.
&gt;&gt; &gt; It was only argued that Harry was NOT morally justified in assaulting
&gt;&gt; &gt; Draco in retaliation.  Anyone familiar with the  phrase &quot;two wrongs do
&gt;&gt; &gt; not make a right&quot; will see no possiblity of contradiction here -- the
&gt;&gt; &gt; two moral issues -- or two legal issues -- are entirely
&gt;&gt; &gt; independent. .  Harry, in attacking Draco, was not only morally wrong,
&gt;&gt; &gt; but he was also committing an act which, if committed by an adult,
&gt;&gt; &gt; would be considered a criminal act that would probably be punishable
&gt;&gt; &gt; by a short prison term.  Here in New York, the crime would be &quot;Assault
&gt;&gt; &gt; in the 3rd Degree&quot; and the punishment would be (for adults) a maximum
&gt;&gt; &gt; 1 year in jail, but all other jurisdictions have similarly-named
&gt;&gt; &gt; crimes with roughly similar punishments.  If Harry were prosecuted (as
&gt;&gt; &gt; an adult) for such a crime it would be no defense -- none at all --
&gt;&gt; &gt; that Draco insulted Harry's parents.

&gt;&gt; You have just defined another reason I don't even VISIT New York unless
&gt;&gt; I can duck back into a civilized area quickly.

&gt;Without knowing where you live, I can tell you, with 99% certainty,
&gt;that the situation where you live is fundamentally the same.

&gt;But why don't you tell me where you live?  I have access to legal
&gt;research resources, and I may be able to tell you precisely the law of
&gt;your jurisdiction.

&gt;&gt; &gt; To illustrate the &quot;two wrongs do not make a right&quot; principle, let's
&gt;&gt; &gt; tell the following hypothetical -- Scorpius insults Albus's parents.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Albus gets mad, raises his fist to go take a swing at Scorpius.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Scorpius sees Ablus coming at him with flailing fists, gets scared,
&gt;&gt; &gt; pulls out a knife to defend himself &amp; stabs Albus in the arm.  Albus,
&gt;&gt; &gt; seeing that he is bleeding and seeing the knife in Scorpius's hands,
&gt;&gt; &gt; pulls out a 44 magnum and shoots Scorpius 4 times in the head and
&gt;&gt; &gt; chest.  Scorpius, miraculously, manages to survive, and manages to
&gt;&gt; &gt; disable Albus with a Petrificus Totalis.  Scorpius then reloads
&gt;&gt; &gt; Albus's 44 magnum and shoots the helpless Albus 4 times in the head.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Which of these acts were LEGAL?  None of them, except the petrificus
&gt;&gt; &gt; totalis and (under freedom of speech principles) the original
&gt;&gt; &gt; insult.   Which of these acts were MORAL?  Only the petrificus
&gt;&gt; &gt; totalis.  If both idiots survive their wounds, the State would be
&gt;&gt; &gt; perfectly justified in charging them both with attempted murder and
&gt;&gt; &gt; locking them up for the protection of society.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It was illegal for Albus to attempt to punch Scorpius.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Notwithstanding Albus's illegal punch, it was illegal for Scorpius to
&gt;&gt; &gt; stab Albus.  Even when you are subject to an illegal assault, you may
&gt;&gt; &gt; not escalate to deadly force.  One may not resort to deadly force
&gt;&gt; &gt; unless one is in reasonable fear of one's life.  A reasonable fear of
&gt;&gt; &gt; a black eye or a bloody nose does not justify resort to the use of a
&gt;&gt; &gt; deadly weapon such as a gun or knife.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Notwithstanding Scorpius's illegal use of deadly force, it was illegal
&gt;&gt; &gt; for Albus to shoot Scorpius.  Why?  Because the justification of &quot;self
&gt;&gt; &gt; defense&quot; does not work for someone who is an original physical
&gt;&gt; &gt; aggressor.  After having initiated the physical assault, Albus does
&gt;&gt; &gt; not regain the right to self defense until and unless he makes some
&gt;&gt; &gt; attempt to retreat or withdraw from the combat.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Notwithstanding Albus's illegal shooting of Scorpius, it was illegal
&gt;&gt; &gt; for Scorpius to shoot Albus. Why?  Because by the time Scorpius shot
&gt;&gt; &gt; Albus, Albus was completely helpless.  It was now merely revenge, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; no longer imminent self defense.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Now, although it is not relevant, let us turn to the independent issue
&gt;&gt; &gt; of your misconceptions regarding freedom of speech, and when the state
&gt;&gt; &gt; may, or may not, punish verbal abuse.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It is absolutely NOT true that &quot;verbal abuse&quot; is generally illegal in
&gt;&gt; &gt; western nations.  Virtually all western democracies recognize &quot;freedom
&gt;&gt; &gt; of speech&quot; as an important right, and regard protecting this right as
&gt;&gt; &gt; so important that a large degree of immoral, vile and insulting
&gt;&gt; &gt; conduct must be protected so as to ensure that the right is not
&gt;&gt; &gt; compromised and that government is not given too much power to punish
&gt;&gt; &gt; its enemies.  In the United States for instance, this right comes
&gt;&gt; &gt; under the purview of the First Amendment of the Consitution.  Because
&gt;&gt; &gt; of the strictures of the First Amendment, free speech is protected
&gt;&gt; &gt; even more strongly in the  United States than almost any other western
&gt;&gt; &gt; nation, including the UK.

&gt;&gt; Sorry, but abusive speech, and speech which incites to riot, are
&gt;&gt; NOT protected by the First Amendment.

&gt;&quot;Abusive&quot; speech is protected.  Incitement to riot is not, if more
&gt;narrowly construed than you are doing -- as I explained.

I think Karnak is right; if abusive speech wasn't protected, someone
like Michael Richards would be in jail?  Or perhaps Don Imus?

&gt;&gt; &gt; This right is subject to a number of VERY NARROWLY CONSTRUED

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Incitement to Riot&quot;, or incitement to any other illegal activity,
&gt;&gt; &gt; merely reflects the idea that it is illegal to actually encourage and

&gt;&gt; &gt; assault&quot; merely because you just written a post that attempts to
&gt;&gt; &gt; justify illegal assaults against people who insult you.  However, if
&gt;&gt; &gt; you said to your buddy, &quot;let's go out and assault someone&quot; and you

&gt;&gt; &gt; could be convicted as an accomplice simply because you encouraged

&gt;&gt; &gt; communists and anarchists to preach the ultimate necessity of the

I can chime in a little here. I got to Washington DC frequently and on

&gt;&gt; To some extent you may have a point.  Many people who advocate moral
&gt;&gt; courage from the safety of their armchairs may find that, in the
&gt;&gt; stress of battle (so to speak) they fail the test.

&gt;&gt; On the other hand, such people are certainly more likely to pass the
&gt;&gt; test, in the heat of battle, than those who, from the safety of
&gt;&gt; their armchairs, advocate moral cowardice.

&gt; There are some weird exceptions, in history, though.  The people who
&gt; talk the worst turn out to walk the best.  There is that line from
&gt; SCREWTAPE about the English being &quot;incorrigible milksops&quot; who loudly
&gt; proclaim that torture is too good for the enemy, and then bring tea
&gt; and biscuits to downed German fighter pilots.

&gt; Harry is sometimes an example of this sort of thing (frothing at the
&gt; mouth about killing Sirius, and then saving Pettigrew, for example).
&gt; Then there is &quot;KILL MUDBLOODS . . . who ME?&quot; Draco.

&gt;&gt; And I see no reason to cut any slack to those who, from the safety
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; their armchairs, advocate moral cowardice.  After all, they have no
&gt;&gt; excuse at all.

&gt; One English preacher during WWII said that he has said a great many
&gt; things from the pulpit that he was very ashamed of.  Possibly, when
&gt; push came to shove, his &quot;flock&quot; was more obedient to the sort of
&gt; things he said in peacetime, and possibly they weren't.  Either way,
&gt; he didn't think it excused him saying them.  I think we can say things
&gt; that we ultimately don't mean, and have those things acted upon by
&gt; other people.

&gt;&gt; Now that the series is over, I have to agree that the problem with
&gt;&gt; the Harry Potter series is not that it fails to forgive its flawed
&gt;&gt; heroes
&gt;&gt; for their crimes, but rather that it goes too far in justifying
&gt;&gt; and condoning their conduct itself.

&gt; Exactly.

&gt;&gt; I would have been happier if this
&gt;&gt; book, aimed at children, had upheld higher moral standards -- and I
&gt;&gt; don't mean I wanted perfect goody 2-shoes heros.  I knew perfectly
&gt;&gt; well I did not have that -- and I still thought that Book 7 would
&gt;&gt; justify the series.  But in the end, JK Rowling let me down.

&gt; It is actually very scary to me now that we are living in a world that
&gt; will soon be run by the generation raised on these books.  I mean,
&gt; what are KIDS getting out of this.  There is a whole thread on
&gt; Underaged Drinking and will that Corrupt young kids.  All the drinking
&gt; I saw in HP was perfectly responsible (except for Winky).  What about
&gt; the bullying, attempted murder, dealing illegal pharmeceuticals to
&gt; young kids, and Torture?  None of this is objected to in the books
&gt; except by the rule-abiding Hermione whom the boys all slightly
&gt; disparage because she doesn't think Quiddich is God.

&gt; I really am wondering what Rowling was thinking on these points.  And
&gt; I'm wondering if anybody has asked her.
">

Are you worried that the generation raised on Harry Potter might produce
political leaders who defend torture? Maybe even an attorney general or
two who writes memos suggesting that the international conventions
against torture are &quot;quaint&quot;? How awful!

Oh, wait, we've already got that.

I think Rowling was writing with her eye very firmly on contemporary
events. In the real world the use of torture by the 'good guys' is an
accomplished fact and her young readers are going to have to learn to
live in that world. Rather than engaging in overt and obvious
moralizing, she shows various ways people can respond. Neville goes into
hiding rather than agreeing to torture other students. Harry does not
have that option. He has a job to do and in the course of doing it he
crosses a moral line and uses torture. But he only does it once. He
steps back across the line and shows bravery and self-sacrifice.

Can you say which of the two is better or braver? Would Harry have used
the the cruciatis curse if Amycus had not spat on McGonagall? Might
Neville have yielded to temptation if he had had a clear shot at Bellatrix?

&gt; Harry crossed a moral line when he used the curse.

I have a serious problem with this comment, and the whole notion of
&quot;unforgivable curses.&quot;

According to Moody, using the AK, Imperius curse or Cruciatus curse on
another human being gives you an automatic life sentence in Azkaban.  My
question is: &quot;Why?&quot;  Why are these three spells singled out and others are
not?  Why isn't Sectumsempra included?  Snape admits it's dark magic, and it
can cause serious injury and death, so why does it get a pass?  Even the
Expelliarmus spell was strong enough to lift snape off his feet, throw him
against the wall and KO him.  What if Snape hit his head when he plowed into
the wall or broke his back?  Would Harry just get a detention and the MOM
would look the other way?  What if Harry used the Imperius curse on some
depressed muggle to prevent him from stepping off a bridge in a suicide
attempt?  Would the MOM say &quot;I know you did it for a good reason, but the
law is the law, so enjoy the rest of your life in Azkaban.&quot;

And what about in time of war.  What is the difference between Harry casting
an AK and hitting DE who was chasing him when leaving the Dursleys, and
Hagrid pressing a button on his bike, creating a floating brick wall where a
DE crashes into it at a 100klicks/hour, probably shattering every bone in
his body (his broom broke so I'd assume his bones would do the same), and if
he lived, he fell several thousand feet and smashing into the ground at
180km/h?  In comparison, the AK curse is downright humane because it's
instantaneous.  Why would the person casting the AK be punished with an
automatic life sentence, but not the dude flying the motorbike?  In both
examples, the person is still dead.

Using the AK in combat is probably the smartest thing a person could do.
Look at the DE Dolohov.  Harry stupefied him in that muggle restaurant, then
left him (memory slightly erased).  Then Dolohov shows up at the end of the
book during the battle of Hogwarts.  Just how many defenders of Hogwarts did
he snuff because Harry didn't AK him when he had the chance.  The same goes
for Yaxley in the MOM battle.

To me, it's not the spell that's used that should determine if you're going
to rot in Azkaban for the rest of your life, but rather the reasons for
using such a spell and who you hit that are more important.  Using an AK
curse during a time of war on an enemy combatant, or an Auror-sniper using
it to take out a dark wizard who has taken hostages at Gringots during a
botched bank robbery seem perfectly fine to me.

Under US of A law at least, there is a big jump between speech, which
is protected, and Call to action, which is not.

For example, I can say &quot;All people of X should die&quot; - which is
protected
but if I where to say, &quot;Go out and Kill people of X&quot; - then that is a
call to action and is NOT protected.

The point is that AK kills, no matter what.  The MoM does allow AKing
on select occasions, however for the most part there are plenty of
defensive spells that can take someone down without killing them.
For example, if you have a crazy on the street with a gun with no
hostages, a police sniper is going to shoot the gun out of his hand
instead of shooting him in the head.   Also thats why there is Beanbag-
guns.

Give me ONE reasion why you would need torture someone in the
potterverse when there is truth-serums around...

Harry's momentary use of the Cruciatus Curse does not constitute
torture. It constitutes lashing out in anger. Can you honestly picture
Harry holding the spell on and keeping it there over an extended
period, turning the screw so to speak? That would be torture. By
contrast, flinging a bolt of pain at someone is precisely what a slap
across the cheek is all about, and although Harry delivered a mighty
big slap, at the end of the day a slap is all it was.

In warfare, killing combatants is quite necessary.  If you don't, they will
come back again and again and again (See Yaxley and Dolohov for perfect
examples).  In Potterverse, there was a war going on between Voldemort and
his followers vs the Order.  I think using the AK in this situation is quite
acceptable.  You'd be targeting combatants only, not civilians, and really,
the AK is quite humane.  And again, what is the difference between killing a
combatant with an AK curse and killing them with another spell?  I don't see
a difference except one is a lot more effective and quick.

Shooting a gun out of someone's hand is incredibly difficult for even the
best sniper, that's why they are trained to go for the center of mass (the
body).  If the person is moving, it becomes a lot harder.  Robocop would
have no difficulty, but most humans would.  I do agree with you partly.  In
a non-combat civilian setting, there are other options that most law
enforcement employ before resorting to lethal force, and that's the way it
should be.  Lethal force should be used only as the last resort.  Again,
it's the situation that dictates what has to happen.  But to sit there and
say &quot;just because you AKed someone, you're gonna rot in prison for the rest
of your life&quot; is just wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Potterveres or the real world, torture is unacceptable.  As a soldier, there
is no circumstances where I agree with torturing a captured combatant.  In
the Potterverse, the Cruciatus curse is used for torture, there's no doubt
about that.  But I believe it can be used to immobilize an enemy too.  What
I mean is look at electricity.  It can be used to torture an individual --
attach a couple of electrodes to someone's private areas, turn on the juice
and watch them twitch and scream.  It appears to be quite painful (just like
the Cruciatus curse).  But a modified version (the Taser) can be used to
immobilize an individual quite effectively.  Harry's attack on Amycrus
seemed more Taser-like then torture-like, that's why I'm not too bent out of
shape that he did it.
