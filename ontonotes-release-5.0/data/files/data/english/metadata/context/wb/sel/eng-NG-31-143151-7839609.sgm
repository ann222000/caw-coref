AMERICA AND THE US POLITICS TOWARD CAMBODIA IN 1975

Part Five: The Death of Throes of Diplomacy
Earlier this year, John Gunther Dean, the last US ambassador to Cambodia
before it fell to the Khmer communists, turned over thousands of documents
to the Jimmy Carter Library in Atlanta, Ga., part of the US National
Archives. The documents show an increasingly desperate ambassador calling
for negotiations that were likely too late, despite terse reprimands from
his bosses in Washington and in the face of a collapsing Khmer Republic.
This is the fifth in a series of reports on the Dean documents.

I  READ  WITH SYMPATHY ABOUT THE SITUATION AND THIS REPORT  .
&quot;Dean then sketched for his boss, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the
portrait of a ruined city: an undersupplied army led by morale-weakened
officers, a collapsing economy plagued by corruption, refugee settlements
“wiped out,” prices likely to “spiral upward dramatically,” and
anti-government demonstrations imminent. Dean was unhappy that weak attempts
by Washington to find a controlled solution had led to nothing in his nearly
one year in Cambodia.

“The kind of picture I paint in this message was projected in the Mission’s
assessment sent to the Department in four parts last June,” he wrote. “We
concluded at that time that a political solution must be found to the
Cambodian dilemma as soon as possible. The obvious conclusion remains that,
while we will try to do our best here to maintain some form of stability in
the military-political-economic-social field, we are heading towards a
debacle unless a political solution can be found rapidly.”

FOR A RESEARCHER  THE FACTS ARE :
-May 4, 1970 The PRC issues a statement pledging full support to Cambodia,
Laos and Vietnam against US aggression.
-May 8, 1970 Pres. Nixon says all US troops would be withdrawn from Cambodia
by June 30.1970
-Jan. 23, 1973 Pres. Nixon announces that Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho
have initialed an agreement in Paris to end the Vietnam War.
-Jan. 24, 1973 Prince Sihanouk meets with Chinese PM Zhou Enlai in Beijing.
The Prince is told: &quot; According to what the Vietnamese side told our
ambassador in Hanoi, the armistice in Vietnam does not cover Cambodia and
Laos. .&quot;
Sept. 4, 1973 US Ambassador Swank gave farewell press conference.

Oct. 8, 1973 Zhou Enlai meets with Le Thanh Nghi ....
On Cambodia, Zhou says: &quot;Negotiations in Cambodia are not suitable for the
time being. Sihanouk is against negotiations. So is the internal faction of
FUNK. They want to prolong the fighting for some more time.

Jan. 28, 1974 Khmer Rouge end six days of shelling on Phnom Penh, which
killed 89 and wounded 229 civilians……….
In a letter to Lon Nol, Pres. Nixon promises maximum US assistance to Phnom
Penh in the fight against the Khmer Rouge.

March 31, 1974 New US ambassador, John G. Dean, arrived in Phnom Penh……..
April 3, 1974  John Dean presented his letters of credential as American
ambassador to Cambodia.
Aug. 9, 1974 US Pres. Richard Nixon resigned.

CONCLUSION :
- BETRAYAL BY DR.KISSINGER TO THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE, TO US AMBASSADOR John G.
Dean,
TO US ARMY IN VIETNAM......
-PRINCE NORODOM SIHANOUK WAS DUPED BY THE NORTH VIETNAMESE AND HIS BETRAYAL
TO CAMBODIA

US AMBASSADOR John G. Dean WAS VICTIM OF THE US POLITICS, MANIPULATED BY THE
US DEMOCRATE CONGRESS AND DR KISSINGER ... WHILE PRINCE SIHANOUK WAS TOTALLY
UNDER THE CONTROLE OF THE COMMUNISTS  , DUPED AND CHEATED BY THE NROTH
VIETNAMESE LEADERS.

consequences as of today ?
Cambodia remains occupied by Vietnam with King Sihanouk/his son as
Vietnamese puppet Kings..

America calls Vietnam to restore Cambodia Independence .
President Reagan's address to the 43d Session of the United Nations General
Assembly in New York, New York,September 26, 1988.
&quot;Mr. Secretary-General, there are new hopes for Cambodia, a nation whose
freedom and independence we seek just as avidly as we sought the freedom and
independence of Afghanistan. We urge the rapid removal of  all Vietnamese
troops ....&quot;

As of today,Cambodia is still occupied by the Vietnamese troops despite the
call from the US president to Vietnam to cease her occupation of Cambodia
since 1988.
Cambodia needs Independence from Vietnam and the Vietnamese invaders.

The Year Before Zero: Dean's Controlled Solution- The Death of Throes of
Diplomacy

Part Five: The Death of Throes of Diplomacy

Earlier this year, John Gunther Dean, the last US ambassador to Cambodia
before it fell to the Khmer communists, turned over thousands of documents
to the Jimmy Carter Library in Atlanta, Ga., part of the US National
Archives. The documents show an increasingly desperate ambassador calling
for negotiations that were likely too late, despite terse reprimands from
his bosses in Washington and in the face of a collapsing Khmer Republic.
This is the fifth in a series of reports on the Dean documents.

With Phnom Penh gasping for supplies and troops, in early 1975, New York
Times reporter Sydney Schanberg interviewed several refugee families
snatched from their besieged town, Neak Loeung, by Khmer Republican forces.
They had been rescued by boat on the condition the men fight for the
national army. Wearing olive green uniform shirts, their wives and families
in tow, the men were uneasy about their new prospects, Schanberg wrote.

“The Government took special steps to prevent the men from deserting,”
Schanberg wrote. “When the boats pulled up to the river landing at 11 am,
the trucks and officers that were to take them to the training center had
not yet arrived, so the boats were kept from unloading for two hours. In the
meantime, the military police brought some bread and threw it to the refugee
conscripts.”

Such were the defense efforts of Phnom Penh, surrounded by communist
insurgents and cut off from supplies by all but airlifts. As the weeks
passed, the US chief of mission, Ambassador John Gunther Dean, began to feel
the intense heat of his unenviable position. He cabled Washington a status
report.

“Being in the kitchen and sitting in the frying pan right on top of the
burner, I would like to take a few minutes to give you my assessment of the
present situation and how we should proceed as perceived from Phnom Penh,”
he wrote.

Dean then sketched for his boss, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the
portrait of a ruined city: an undersupplied army led by morale-weakened
officers, a collapsing economy plagued by corruption, refugee settlements
“wiped out,” prices likely to “spiral upward dramatically,” and
anti-government demonstrations imminent. Dean was unhappy that weak attempts
by Washington to find a controlled solution had led to nothing in his nearly
one year in Cambodia.

“The kind of picture I paint in this message was projected in the Mission’s
assessment sent to the Department in four parts last June,” he wrote. “We
concluded at that time that a political solution must be found to the
Cambodian dilemma as soon as possible. The obvious conclusion remains that,
while we will try to do our best here to maintain some form of stability in
the military-political-economic-social field, we are heading towards a
debacle unless a political solution can be found rapidly.”

The Americans were failing the Cambodians, Dean wrote in another cable.

“I must state very frankly that the Khmers of this side are waiting, and
waiting desperately, for us to get involved…. What they must be wondering is
what is holding us back?” he wrote. “They certainly are not holding us back,
and if they are not, who or what is? I must say I do not have the answers to
these questions.”

Dean’s argument still centered on reaching Prince Norodom Sihanouk, in exile
in Beijing and the theoretical head of a government in exile for the Khmer
communists and monarchists. Dean’s continuous cables were not well received.
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger finally warned Dean to stop.

“As a friend, I want to give you my very personal reactions to your latest
messages on how to proceed with negotiations,” Eagleburger wrote. “In
utterly frank terms, these messages are seen here as confirmation that your
interest in negotiations has now become an obsession. I must tell you that
such cables are increasingly counterproductive.”

Eagleburger cautioned Dean that Washington had tried every channel to reach
Sihanouk. He reminded the ambassador that the strong military position of
the communists, who saw themselves “on the verge of victory,” meant they
would not negotiate, and that Sihanouk “will not or cannot assert himself in
this matter.”

“I therefore strongly suggest that you recognize that no useful purpose can
be served by continued harping on the question of negotiations,” Eagleburger
wrote. “Your cables cannot by themselves bring Sihanouk back, nor do they
suggest any line that has not already been pursued. What they do suggest…is
an attempt to build a record of your own perspicacity. I know this is not
the case, nor would it be necessary in any event, since no one has any
intention of leaving you holding the bag.”

His bosses were concerned Dean’s obsession was distracting him from his
primary mission: “to bend every effort to keep the [Republic] together.”
They also worried his repeated calls for negotiation could “rattle” the
Cambodians “and increase their despair.”

Dean’s relationship with policymakers in Washington, including Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger, was deteriorating. Several weeks before Eagleburger’s
reprimand, a disgruntled Dean wrote Washington to say that the US had a
moral obligation to find a solution for Cambodia. Washington’s refusal to do
so, he said, would be enough for his resignation, if things weren’t so bad
in the war-ravaged country.

“When an ambassador is at odds with the policy pursued by the Department, it
is customary under normal circumstances for him to submit his resignation,”
Dean wrote. “These are not normal circumstances and such an act might be
misinterpreted as a desire on my part to get out. As a disciplined foreign
service officer, I will therefore desist from such action at this time.”

Dean’s letter would serve as a registry of his “profound disagreement” with
the State Department’s reasoning: “that developments will have occurred
[later] in the US or in Cambodia which will shed a kind light on our
five-year effort in Cambodia.”

By the time he wrote these words, the chance for a controlled solution was
evaporating. Sihanouk no longer had any power to broker, even if Washington
could reach him, which, for whatever reason, it had not done. The communists
were sure of victory and would never negotiate. By April 10, they’d broken
the capital’s defenses, and the following day Dean led his people away by
helicopter, famously draping the US flag over his arm, to prevent anyone
burning it.

On April 11, at 9:07 am in Washington, the men who Dean worried had not
worked hard enough for a solution, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and
his subordinate, Philip Habib, spoke by phone of the US evacuation,
codenamed Eagle Pull. Habib told Kissinger Eagle Pull could not be delayed.

“[The insurgents are] very, very close in,” he said. “And the final thing is
that if the Cambodians still want to do what we’ve opened the door for them
to do with Sihanouk, they can do it without our presence now, because we’ve
passed all the messages that we need to pass.”

“OK,” Kissinger replied. “It’s not a proud day, but we did the best we
could.”

Dean left Cambodia for Bangkok feeling “terrible sadness,” convinced that
Americans “didn’t live up to our responsibilities and our promises.” No
negotiations ever took place. A dark curtain fell over the small Buddhist
country, and even 30 years later Dean would insist that more could have been
done. The last Phnom Penh heard of the ambassador and his hopes for a
controlled solution were the dull thuds of helicopter rotors, as America
left Cambodia to its fate.
