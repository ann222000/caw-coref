Who was it on here that told me about Lion Heads?  I'm going to
Chinatown on Wednesday and I'm going to eat the hell out of some, if I
can find them.  What else might they be called?

Furthermore, what else should I get?  I don't want anything with the
consistency of eyeballs, and I dont' want anything with the toenails
still on it.  I will be feasting in more than one location.

Tell me what to eat.  It's not often I'll ask for something like that,
because usually I know.  Thanks in advance.  I love you all so very
madly, each and every single one of you without exception.

Have you ever had General Tso's chicken?

YUMMY. GOOD FOOD.

Braised pork and glutinous rice meatball. Light and tasty. If you get a casserole, look
for the Chinese bacon.

I don't know about Lion's Heads, but I do know to STEER CLEAR of Mongolian
Hot Pots.

First thing, if they contain LAMB, it will be just an ankal boan or
something like that.  A dog would puke on it.

Second thing, they use some kind of pine-scented vegetabal.  Tastes like
Vicks VapoRub oanly it's green and crunchy.

Third thing, they make the moast horrable thing out of soy milk.

First they coat a skillet with oil, then apply a thin layar of tofu.  Cook
it until it turns brown AND THEN ROLL IT UP LIKE AN ACE BANDAGE.  Texture is
like eating a rubbar glove.

They stick the tightly rolled up soy bandages in the pot endwise with the
vaporub vegetable filling in the interstices, so that they look like brown
rose buds about to opan, then covar it with a non-descript brown gravy
(which is about the oanly edable part of the dish).  Then they plop the
ankal boan on top, put it in a little ceramic crock, and VIOLA.

I was in San Francisco when I got adventuras and ordared the dish without
knowing what it was.  That was the first time EVAR that I became almost
nausias enuff to upchuck at the tabal.  I thought I was eating somebody's
tumors.

Just say NO to hot pots, unless you like that kind of stuff.

I don't know if I'm feeling adventurous enough to eat braised bandages
in vaporub sauce.  Sounds like there could be a little cilantro in
there, too.  Blech.

However, I am feeling a bit superhuman today, like I could eat, drink,
or fix anything (more on that latar?), so maybe rubber gloves and
ankle fragments is just what the doktor ordered.

Wednesday will be a carnival of culinary delights and squeamish
surprises, including the possability of fish that look at you with one
staring eye while you are eating their innards out, and sweet and sour
elephant testicles.  Unfortunately or fortunately for me, this will be
genuine chinese food and not the kind of kitschy stuff you can get
with drinks in a giant panda with a paper umbrella jutting out of his
dome.  There's a time and a place for that, and THIS IS NOT IT.
Barbecued tumors, here I come.

Serias poast.

I've been to Chinatown in NY a couple times.  Can't remembar where, but the
best places seemed to be these small hole in the wall places with a buffet
line and/or steam tables.  You pay one money and then eat your heart out on
Bob knows what.  Although, they didn't match the meal I had in
Philadelphia's Chinatown one time.

Some of the restaurants there will put on a 38 course Cantonese Feast for a
group of peopal.  There were 17 of us on a business dinnar there, and one of
them was a Chinese gal from Brooklyn (you had to hear her accent), so she
knew exactly what to ordar!

I have NEVAR seen any of those dishes available anywhere else.  A lot of it
was identifiable veggies and meat products wokked in varias sauces, so that
was OK.  One dish was made out of fancy decorated chicken skulls with beaks
attached.  But you oanly had to use the chickenheds as a handle to get to
the meat pile they each sat on.

The othar thing I ate looked like silverfish lightly breaded and fried.
Quite tasty evan though you could see the EYES sticking undar the light
breading.

It took us about three hours to work through all 38 courses.  It wasn't a
ton of food, just such a dizzying variety.  If evar I get my time machine
working, that's one of the places I want to go BACK TO.  Mighta been 1991 or
1992, which was while I was still not so much a foodie as opposed to EATAR.

But if you find a place willing to put on a Cantonese Feast, have one, and
then let me know wherevar it is so I can go there one time too.

I used to date a Thai woman while I was living in Germany and she was
part of a whole Thai community.  When we used to go out to eat, we
would go to Chinese restaurants, and they weren't the ones that white
people usually go to.

They would serve the way you are talking about, they would bring a
half-dozen or dozen trays with different stuff on them.  I had never
had Chinese food at the time and have no idea what it was.  It was
fucking good though.

Everybody would just share off these trays until they were gone.  They
would serve like that even if it wasn't a big feast, everybody would
order one thing but then everybody would share it.

I kind of miss that ... really though, you can eat that way at most
asian restaurants ... but because their customers don't get it, most
of them just serve one meal on a plate.  You CAN eat that way though.

It's a nice way to eat really because you can experiment and even if
there are one or two things that are bad, you still have other stuff
that's good.  But you really have to be eating as a group to do it
right, five or six people at least.

how does ANY church deal with the answers to the
questions you ask? &quot;Am I to give up all my earthly possessions for
God/Jesus/Allah/L Ron Hubbard/The Great Rotating Arkleseizure? How
will I live?&quot;

And they would all tell you the same thing. You must have FAITH. The

it WILL come back to you miraculously! But you must GIVE IT AWAY
COMPLETELY, and BELIEVE COMPLETELY, or it doesn't work.

If you order a Dragon Roll at a Sushi Bar you may want to avoid
the pinkish stuff on the edge of the plate that looks like somebody
shaved their skin and laid it on the same. That's raw ginger and it
tastes EXACTLY like Cheer or All powdered clothing detergent in
the 50-load box. The green stuff is Wasabi and makes a great dipping
sauce when a eye-dropper sized amount is mixed with genuine
Japanese Soy juice. Be careful of the General Tso's chicken if your at
a 'cheaper' chinese take-out place as it's likely to be 80% bread
dough
wrapped around a tiny piece of badly cooked stringy chicken.
An asian college roommate of mine told me that's how his family used
to get rid of the lower quality chicken scraps and low-quality pork
went
into the egg rolls. Finally remember that there's always Taco Bell
with
the HS kid back in the 'kitchen' wrapping up the burritos with the
same
hands he uses to pick his itchy nose and asscrack with every now and
then..

fyi, sushi is japanese, not chinese...japanese and chinese food are
very very different, as are their cultures in general, although
americans tend to mix them up a lot...

~~~~~~~

as for Rev. Back It On Up's question, i suggest:

*something with lotus root...lotus is my absolute favorite veggie in
chinese cooking...i think it's best sliced and fried, rather than
chopped up small...

*something with taro root...yumm!!!  taro is found in a lot of deserts
(usually a drink/soup with coconut milk and tapioca), but i prefer it
as part of something fried with meat, the best i've had was a
restaurant that made it into yummy breaded deep fried balls filled
with scallops...

*i &lt;3 chicken feet...and chicken waddle...but i know lots of people
don't fancy them...so maybe i'm weird...i absolutely adore frog too,
so if they have that i'd order it...

*egg tofu is my favorite kind of tofu...it's tofu mixed with egg and
made into little round pieces and then fried...it's the softest most
amazing kind of tofu ever...

*sweet and sour fish!!!  it's so funny how american chinese
restaurants always have sweet and sour pork made with pineapple (never
saw that in china ever!), but chinese people really love sweet and
sour fish (not made with pineapple, thank goodness, since i'm
allergic)...mmmm deep fried fish with sweet &amp; sour sauce (the best has
pine nuts too!)

*fried greens of some sort...bok choi is good, but i'd ask if they
have any special chinese green leafy veggies other than that...if they
are authentic chinese retaurant they may, and there's so many good
ones it's worth it to ask...my favorite in china (ate it every day)
was pronounced shung tsai, but i don't know what it is in english and
i haven't seen it here ever...

*green beans with black bean sauce (one of my favorite dishes ever)

oh geez, now i am so hungry for chinese food...thank goodness there's
one authentic chinese restaurant in portland (and i know how to cook a
lot myself), or i'd probably go crazy...

hope this helps!
