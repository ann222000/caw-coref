I like all these bands, but these bands refused to change/tinker with
their sound as much as I would have liked...

Don't get me wrong I like all these bands...
The Doors - the same gothic style with the drunken &quot;Morrison tone&quot; in
most of their songs
The Velvet Underground - they seemed to be downbeat in almost every
album they made
The Moody Blues - I like this band a lot, but they had a lush pop/rock
style which they rarely changed during their classic era
The Jimi Hendrix Experience - all their songs are acid stuff. but they
lasted only 3 albums, so probably can't be blamed
Cream - like TJHE but a bit more blues. They also lasted few albums,
so dont know whether can be blamed.
CCR - as good they were, they had the same styled songs.
Black Sabbath - could never get rid of their doom laden music
Deep Purple - Mark 1 was heavy pyschedelia, then later on starting
with Mark 2, they just became a loud band
Genesis - all their Gabriel era album sounded quite similar except the
awful first album, then they changed their style drastically in the
Collins era and then continued with the new rotten style... so in
essence a two styled one dimensional band
Aerosmith - even more one dimensional than Deep Purple and then they
sold out too
AC/DC - my most favorite one style band ever!
ELP - the bombastic sound continued until decadance and sell out
Ramones - the same riffs and the same style
U2 - nothing much has changed over the last 25 years

Iron Maiden - They had a different sound with Paul DiAnno, but the
classic Bruce Dickinson had one major style
Metallica - Again like Iron Maiden, not much a change starting Ride
the Lightning until sellout
Nirvana - same whiny style
Pearl Jam - see Nirvana
Radiohead - same downbeat style with a little electronic music thrown
in, ever since Pablo Honey

I dont like these bands and they were one-dimensional
Allman Brothers Band - the wanking never stopped
Grateful Dead - the weed never stopped
Jefferson Airplane - one dimensional hippies like TJHE, but not even
half as good.
Eagles - very annoying with their polished stuff
Van Halen - just like AC/DC, the one difference, I hate them
Talking Heads - same jerky style of singing with some world music
thrown in

Bands which I like and were good and also multi-dimensional IMO are
Beatles, Stones, Yardbirds, Who, Kinks, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, Led
Zeppelin, Yes, Queen

Some average bands which had a multi-dimensional style Byrds, Beach
Boys, Band, Bee Gees, Fleetwood Mac, Santana, King Crimson, Chicago,
Steely Dan, Clash, Blondie, Police, Rush, and Guns N Roses

Really, all you are saying is that your musical tastes are very close to
his.  But knowing some of what you know about music, I'd find it hard to
believe that you'd accept the following claims by Raja:
&quot;The Jimi Hendrix Experience - all their songs are acid stuff&quot;
&quot;U2 - nothing much has changed over the last 25 years&quot;
&quot;Nirvana - same whiny style&quot;
&quot;Pearl Jam - see Nirvana&quot; (I would agree about Nirvana, it's lumping Pearl
Jam with them that I find very superficial)

(described as &quot;one-dimensional&quot;):
&quot;Allman Brothers Band - the wanking never stopped&quot;
&quot;Talking Heads - same jerky style of singing with some world music
thrown in&quot;

(described as &quot;average&quot;):  Byrds, Beach Boys, Steely Dan

I mean it's all very well and good to express your taste and say you don't
like certain bands, but as usual Raja's characterizations are vastly
oversimplified and in some cases just plain wrong.  I mean, Jimi Hendrix,
all acid?  Please!

I liked bits of both eras: Selling England... and Trick Of The Tail

But how could anyone describe them as one-dimensional?  Compare

I mean ************relatively************* one dimensional... Most of
Jimis stuff is a  combination of pyschedelia and blues and they have
the same dopey tone. You guys wont get it ... forget it. And yes
Genesis had a similar sound in the prog era too. How much did the
waver. It is not that they had albums as different as Piper and Dark
Side.

&gt; Eagles - very annoying with their polished stuff
&gt; Van Halen - just like AC/DC, the one difference, I hate them
&gt; Talking Heads - same jerky style of singing with some world music
&gt; thrown in

&gt; Bands which I like and were good and also multi-dimensional IMO are
&gt; Beatles, Stones, Yardbirds, Who, Kinks, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, Led
&gt; Zeppelin, Yes, Queen

&gt; &gt; &gt; I certainly am one of them. I own many of the Gabriel-era Genesis CDs

&gt; &gt; &gt; Collins. I don't think Gabriel did that well either after he left
&gt; &gt; &gt; Genesis.

&gt; &gt; I liked bits of both eras: Selling England... and Trick Of The Tail

Ah, but I think they did.  Compare Trespass to Invisible Touch and
tell me that's a one-dimensional band?  Even relativley? They are at

Dead right when you say &quot;You guys won't get it&quot; (except you missed the
apostrophe :-) but, tit-for-tat, you don't get it either.  We all have
our areas of delight which we know intimately; we also have areas of
disinterest which we tend to see in monochrome. It's like saying the
Sahara desert and the Antarctic snow fields are the same.  In terms of
having no trees, they are.  To those who don't like prog, no doubt
Genesis and Pink Floyd sound pretty much the same - just like I can't
tell one style of rap from another.

Many bands can be accused of being one-dimensional - but all would
answer &quot;Not guilty!&quot;
You'll have to come up with a better (more detailed) argument - but

I would say Genesis had 3 eras..

One with Gabriel (all albums sounded the same except debut)
One with Hackett and no Gabriel (both albums sounded same)
One with Collins and no Hacket or Gabriel (all albums sounded same).

So they are relatively one-dimensional.

I would say so too, but those three eras brought about the most change
to Genesis's musical experience. Each era is different musically.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Haha! You have to be kidding me! Hackett was a vital member of Genesis
and was most noted for his nylon and electric guitar playing while
with Genesis. In understanding the Hackett, you have to understand his
interest in chords and their progressions. Hackett tends to kept in
mind the like of Bach (some of his pieces move leisurely and slowly
through its changes) and Mario Lanza (an opera composer) when he
composes his music. The reason he quit Genesis in the first place was
because he got tired of bringing ideas to a band that wanted to move
in a different direction musically speaking. So listening to the
Gabriel influence and Hackett influence in Genesis,  it is different
as night and day. I would say Genesis is more steamlined and were
smart for jettisoning the prog style and in favor of something shorter
and media friendly. It's just a question of how long a band will
remain in the spotlight.
