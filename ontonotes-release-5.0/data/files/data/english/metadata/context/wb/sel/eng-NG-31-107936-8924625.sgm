Missteps in the Bunker

By Joby Warrick and Walter Pincus
Washington Post Staff Writers
Sunday, September 23, 2007; A01

Just after 9 a.m. on Aug. 29, a group of U.S. airmen entered a sod-
covered bunker on North Dakota's Minot Air Force Base with orders to
collect a set of unarmed cruise missiles bound for a weapons graveyard.
They quickly pulled out a dozen cylinders, all of which appeared
identical from a cursory glance, and hauled them along Bomber Boulevard
to a waiting B-52 bomber.

The airmen attached the gray missiles to the plane's wings, six on each
side. After eyeballing the missiles on the right side, a flight officer
signed a manifest that listed a dozen unarmed AGM-129 missiles. The
officer did not notice that the six on the left contained nuclear
warheads, each with the destructive power of up to 10 Hiroshima bombs.

That detail would escape notice for an astounding 36 hours, during which
the missiles were flown across the country to a Louisiana air base that
had no idea nuclear warheads were coming. It was the first known flight
by a nuclear-armed bomber over U.S. airspace, without special high-level
authorization, in nearly 40 years.

The episode, serious enough to trigger a rare &quot;Bent Spear&quot; nuclear
incident report that raced through the chain of command to Defense
Secretary Robert M. Gates and President Bush, provoked new questions
inside and outside the Pentagon about the adequacy of U.S. nuclear
weapons safeguards while the military's attention and resources are
devoted to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Three weeks after word of the incident leaked to the public, new details
obtained by The Washington Post point to security failures at multiple
levels in North Dakota and Louisiana, according to interviews with
current and former U.S. officials briefed on the initial results of an
Air Force investigation of the incident.

The warheads were attached to the plane in Minot without special guard
for more than 15 hours, and they remained on the plane in Louisiana for
nearly nine hours more before being discovered. In total, the warheads
slipped from the Air Force's nuclear safety net for more than a day
without anyone's knowledge.

&quot;I have been in the nuclear business since 1966 and am not aware of any
incident more disturbing,&quot; retired Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger, who
served as U.S. Strategic Command chief from 1996 to 1998, said in an
interview.

A simple error in a missile storage room led to missteps at every turn,
as ground crews failed to notice the warheads, and as security teams and
flight crew members failed to provide adequate oversight and check the
cargo thoroughly. An elaborate nuclear safeguard system, nurtured during
the Cold War and infused with rigorous accounting and command
procedures, was utterly debased, the investigation's early results show.

The incident came on the heels of multiple warnings -- some of which
went to the highest levels of the Bush administration, including the
National Security Council -- of security problems at Air Force
installations where nuclear weapons are kept. The risks are not that
warheads might be accidentally detonated, but that sloppy procedures
could leave room for theft or damage to a warhead, disseminating its
toxic nuclear materials.

A former National Security Council staff member with detailed knowledge
described the event as something that people in the White House &quot;have
been assured never could happen.&quot; What occurred on Aug. 29-30, the
former official said, was &quot;a breakdown at a number of levels involving
flight crew, munitions, storage and tracking procedures -- faults that
never were to line up on a single day.&quot;
Missteps in the Bunker

The air base where the incident took place is one of the most remote
and, for much of the year, coldest military posts in the continental
United States. Veterans of Minot typically describe their assignments by
counting the winters passed in the flat, treeless region where January
temperatures sometimes reach 30 below zero. In airman-speak, a three-
year assignment becomes &quot;three winters&quot; at Minot.

The daily routine for many of Minot's crews is a cycle of scheduled
maintenance for the base's 35 aging B-52H Stratofortress bombers --
mammoth, eight-engine workhorses, the newest of which left the assembly
line more than 45 years ago. Workers also tend to 150 intercontinental
ballistic missiles kept at the ready in silos scattered across
neighboring cornfields, as well as hundreds of smaller nuclear bombs,
warheads and vehicles stored in sod-covered bunkers called igloos.

&quot;We had a continuous workload in maintaining&quot; warheads, said Scott Vest,
a former Air Force captain who spent time in Minot's bunkers in the
1990s. &quot;We had a stockpile of more than 400 . . . and some of them were
always coming due&quot; for service.

Among the many weapons and airframes, the AGM-129 cruise missile was
well known at the base as a nuclear warhead delivery system carried by
B-52s. With its unique shape and design, it is easily distinguished from
the older AGM-86, which can be fitted with either a nuclear or a
conventional warhead.

Last fall, after 17 years in the U.S. arsenal, the Air Force's more than
400 AGM-129s were ordered into retirement by then-Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld. Minot was told to begin shipping out the unarmed
missiles in small groups to Barksdale Air Force Base near Shreveport,
La., for storage. By Aug. 29, its crews had already sent more than 200
missiles to Barksdale and knew the drill by heart.

The Air Force's account of what happened that day and the next was
provided by multiple sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity
because the government's investigation is continuing and classified.

At 9:12 a.m. local time on Aug. 29, according to the account, ground
crews in two trucks entered a gated compound at Minot known as the
Weapons Storage Area and drove to an igloo where the cruise missiles
were stored. The 21-foot missiles were already mounted on pylons, six
apiece in clusters of three, for quick mounting to the wings of a B-52.

The AGM-129 is designed to carry silver W-80-1 nuclear warheads, which
have a variable yield of between 5 and 150 kilotons. (A kiloton is equal
to the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT.) The warheads were meant to
have been removed from the missiles before shipment. In their place,
crews were supposed to insert metal dummies of the same size and weight,
but a different color, so the missiles could still be properly attached
under the bomber's wings.

A munitions custodian officer is supposed to keep track of the nuclear
warheads. In the case of cruise missiles, a stamp-size window on the
missile's frame allows workers to peer inside to check whether the
warheads within are silver. In many cases, a red ribbon or marker
attached to the missile serves as an additional warning. Finally, before
the missiles are moved, two-man teams are supposed to look at check
sheets, bar codes and serial numbers denoting whether the missiles are
armed.

Why the warheads were not noticed in this case is not publicly known.
But once the missiles were certified as unarmed, a requirement for
unique security precautions when nuclear warheads are moved -- such as
the presence of specially armed security police, the approval of a
senior base commander and a special tracking system -- evaporated.

The trucks hauled the missile pylons from the bunker into the bustle of
normal air base traffic, onto Bomber Boulevard and M Street, before
turning onto a tarmac apron where the missiles were loaded onto the B-
52. The loading took eight hours because of unusual trouble attaching
the pylon on the right side of the plane -- the one with the dummy
warheads.

By 5:12 p.m., the B-52 was fully loaded. The plane then sat on the
tarmac overnight without special guards, protected for 15 hours by only
the base's exterior chain-link fence and roving security patrols.

Air Force rules required members of the jet's flight crew to examine all
of the missiles and warheads before the plane took off. But in this
instance, just one person examined only the six unarmed missiles and
inexplicably skipped the armed missiles on the left, according to
officials familiar with the probe.

&quot;If they're not expecting a live warhead it may be a very casual thing
-- there's no need to set up the security system and play the whole
nuclear game,&quot; said Vest, the former Minot airman. &quot;As for the air crew,
they're bus drivers at this point, as far as they know.&quot;

The plane, which had flown to Minot for the mission and was not
certified to carry nuclear weapons, departed the next morning for
Louisiana. When the bomber landed at Barksdale at 11:23 a.m., the air
crew signed out and left for lunch, according to the probe.

It would be another nine hours -- until 8:30 p.m. -- before a Barksdale
ground crew turned up at the parked aircraft to begin removing the
missiles. At 8:45, 15 minutes into the task, a separate missile
transport crew arrived in trucks. One of these airmen noticed something
unusual about the missiles. Within an hour, a skeptical supervisor had
examined them and ordered them secured.

By then it was 10 p.m., more than 36 hours after the warheads left their
secure bunker in Minot.

Once the errant warheads were discovered, Air Force officers in
Louisiana were alarmed enough to immediately notify the National
Military Command Center, a highly secure area of the Pentagon that
serves as the nerve center for U.S. nuclear war planning. Such &quot;Bent
Spear&quot; events are ranked second in seriousness only to &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;
incidents, which involve the loss, destruction or accidental detonation
of a nuclear weapon.

The Air Force decided at first to keep the mishap under wraps, in part
because of policies that prohibit the confirmation of any details about
the storage or movement of nuclear weapons. No public

Well, that tells us a little bit more about how it happened.  The incident
definitely revealed a laxness throughout the entire command structure.   Time to

If you build as a security check a radiological alarm into a Nuclear weapon
storage area security system then you would make sure that the nuclear
weapons stored within will set it off.

This is just a guess but I would suspect you would have network of sensors
with triple reduncancy.  At the gates, along the roads and maybe even at the
door of the individual bunkers.

The alarm would go off at the WSA security command post, Base Security HQ
and the wing command post and perhaps else where.

So how do you get nukes past these?

The only nuclear weapons I have ever been associated with were alarmed in
such a way that they could not be moved or tampered with in any obvious way.
That must not be happening at Minot.

And the US complains about irresponsible handling of nuclear materials
in the FSU!

Although I believe that any of those nuclear warheads can only be
activated by Presidential order (AFAIK) and that there never was any
real danger of them going off even in a crash... makes you wonder what
a rogue crew would do with them?

Could the missiles have been dropped over a specific rural location
and picked up by domestic or foreign terrorists?

Since 9/11 it is important to think of all scenarios and I bet no one
thought of this one!

Sorry, Rob, but there's a lot about US nuclear weapons that you don't
know. And, unfortunately, it's pretty difficult to explain it in a
public forum. You know the old drill, if I told you then I'd have to
kill you.

Suffice it to say that there are a lot of safeguards and a lot of
things have to happen in a particular sequence before you get a yield.
And, I sure wouldn't want to be around a weapon that had enough of an
external radiation signature that it would set off movement alarms as
Leadfoot as asked about.

As a former hand-receipt &quot;owner&quot; of a nuke (B-57 and B-61) I always
thought that so much needed to be perfect in the sequence that it was
more likely to dud than to work if the balloon every went up.

You have been watching too many movies, xenia, the president is the
only one that can order the use of U.S. nuclear devices. Once the
weapons are loaded a &quot;rogue crew&quot; is capable of using them. There is no
magic device that needs to have buttons pushed only by the president.

Certainly, xenia, but there are mechanical safeties that will lock
and make them useless except for materials sources. The neat little
light up code panel John Travolta played with doesn't exist on real bombs.

You're right Ed, I make no claims of knowledge regarding postwar
nuclear devices nor their operation, but answer me just this- could
the warheads of any of those missiles be activated by the crew or did
they only have control of the missile launches?

Also, from all the broken arrows I ever read about crashes and intense
fires involving nuclear weapons cannot set any of them off.

Lastly, here is one broken arrow I cannot understand:

5 DECEMBER 1965: While the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga
(CVA-14) steamed en route from bombing operations off Vietnam to the
U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka, Japan, an A-4E attack jet loaded with a
B-43 thermonuclear bomb rolled off the Number 2 elevator, and sank in
16,000 feet of water. The aircraft carrier was positioned about 70
miles from the Ryuku Islands and about 200 miles east of Okinawa. The
bomb, aircraft and pilot were not recovered

Is that b/c they did not have a precise location for the a/c or they
just made no attempt at all? And why is it that several operations
worldwide were made to recover Soviet lost nukes and not our own
(between 7-11 estimated missing in the oceans)?

Common, except for the Broken Arrow part of it.  Its deep, its not
likely to ever impact civilians of any nation, so let it just dissolve
in place.

Because we already know the specs and details our nukes, and we need
to understand theirs.  Plus, recovery ops at 16,000' is about as easy
as mounting a moon mission.

You know, at some point, you'll need to explain your behavior.  Now
that you have put your female alter ego back in the box, you appear to

&gt;&gt; 16,000 feet of water. The aircraft carrier was positioned about 70
&gt;&gt; miles from the Ryuku Islands and about 200 miles east of Okinawa. The
&gt;&gt; bomb, aircraft and pilot were not recovered

&gt; Common, except for the Broken Arrow part of it.  Its deep, its not
&gt; likely to ever impact civilians of any nation, so let it just dissolve
&gt; in place.

&gt;&gt; Is that b/c they did not have a precise location for the a/c or they
&gt;&gt; just made no attempt at all? And why is it that several operations
&gt;&gt; worldwide were made to recover Soviet lost nukes and not our own
&gt;&gt; (between 7-11 estimated missing in the oceans)?

&gt; Because we already know the specs and details our nukes, and we need
&gt; to understand theirs.  Plus, recovery ops at 16,000' is about as easy
&gt; as mounting a moon mission.

&gt; You know, at some point, you'll need to explain your behavior.  Now
&gt; that you have put your female alter ego back in the box, you appear to
&gt; simply ignore the fact that you insulted us and played some bizarre
&gt; game for over a week.  You need help, Rob.

As an ex-officer who once had some nuclear missile responsibility, my
reaction was that this scenario was impossible.  Not unlikely, not
something out of a Clancy novel, just flat-out, 100%, impossible.

There's a big difference between ICBM and aircraft released nuclear
weapons procedures. I stand by what I said. I do know more details, but
as Ed said some things are best held close.

I will say this, the cockpit layout pictures for F-4E are available
in books and on line. F-4E was nuclear capable. There was a &quot;nuclear
consent&quot; switch in the back cockpit. If the GIB agrees to release the
weapon the stick actuator can select the weapon and release it.

There's a photograph available on the web of the components of B-61
thermonuclear bomb. There is no light up keyboard like the one John
Travolta played with in that stupid movie.

Think about this logically. When an aircraft is cocked and locked the
whole idea is for the aircrew to hop in and go, not push a bunch of
buttons. The aircraft has to vacate the immediate vicinity immediately
to reduce the possibility of being taken out before they can launch.

As far as &quot;rogue crews&quot; are concerned there's a greater chance of a
person refusing to launch than the other way around. Back in the 1970s
there was a case of a Minuteman crewman who was relieved because he said
he couldn't say with certainty he would launch if ordered to do so.

That is correct. The two-place aircraft made the concept of  &quot;two-man
control&quot; a lot easier to implement in fighters. Prior to that time
there were a lot of single seat fighters with only the pilot in charge
of the weapon after launch. Getting to launch, however, took a lot of
cooperating people doing their jobs.

The nuclear consent switch required that both cockpits operate the
switches to get a weapon armed and released.

There was also the PAL, a locking device that was implemented during
the Eisenhower administration. Initially it was an electronic panel
with four rotary dials to set a four-digit code to  unlock the weapon.
In the mid-sixties PAL was upgraded to six digit code with limited
trials before deactivation. (All of this was &quot;long ago, far away&quot; and
published in the unclassified manuals--i.e., public domain.)

What would movies be without a red digital countdown timer on the
weapon? No drama at all.

The B-61 did have a green light indicating electrical continuity from
the aircraft to the weapon. It also had a cannon plug to attach an
external control box to allow PAL enabling from the ground in the
event of aircraft malfunction prior to launch.

The concept of PRP and &quot;no lone zone&quot; as well as all you have said
pretty much reduces xenia's plot line to zero. Anyone who doubts that
should see what happens when a non-alert airplane starts engines or
moves without clearance. The whole flight line goes nuts. Add that to
the base supplement to AFR 207-1 (I hope I am remembering the correct
one) not only gives base specific responses but also has instructions as
to what part of assigned aircraft the sky cops are to shoot at to
rapidly disable. While an M-16 can poke all kinds of pretty holes in
aircraft most military aircraft are amazingly difficult to disable.

Having said that I still get a giggle out of the Incirlik sky cops
standing around an H-53 from 1 SOW trying to figure out what to do next
when the rotors started spinning without clearance. This was when people
were being evacuated from Iran during the hostage crisis. They would run
rotors every morning for a few minutes. Someone forgot to call it in.
Maintenance knew, the tower didn't.

I used to be in Rickover's Navy.  Believe me, everyone from the Captain on
down knew the meaning of fear.  It was very effective.

For example: They had roving teams of inquisitors that could come aboard at
any time without notice, inspect whatever they pleased, give written and oral
exams without the slightest opportunity for preparation, and then run drills and
mock nuclear emergencies until we were asleep on our feet.  Failure was a
career-ender.  The only time we were truly safe was when we were on submerged
patrol.

Selective editing doesn't change what I told xenia/rob/jon/watch this
space. Having said that there are other sites that describe PALs. Google
B-61 bomb and you will find a few more.

There's a lot of Hollywood/fiction out there about nuclear weapons
that can be dismissed out of hand. There are a few sites that have
excellent educated guesses and even fewer that are written by people
with the physics background to be correct. The fun part is trying to
figure out who is correct.

The real bombs are rather boring critters to look at. The first time
you get to stand near one is a tad anticlimactic. I guess Hollywood
needs flashing lights or moving parts to tell you it's a bomb.

I get a kick out of &quot;experts&quot; on television who go for drama rather
than fact. My favourite gag is used by the area 51/UFO/conspiracy crowd
who point to restricted area signs that say uses of lethal force is
authorized and say something like &quot;if you take one step past that sign
you will be shot.&quot; It's a gas.

&quot;I claim no expertise in nuclear weapons design.&quot;

He does, however, know a fair amount about cryptography &amp; security
