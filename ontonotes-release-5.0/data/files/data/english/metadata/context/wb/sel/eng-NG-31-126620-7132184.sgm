Salmon Fillet En Papillote With Julienne Vegetable - Serves 1
Recipe By: Alton Brown

Ingredients

1/3     cup     julienned fennel bulb
1/3     cup     julienned leeks -- white part only
1/3     cup     julienned carrots
1/3     cup     julienned snow peas
1       teaspoons       salt
1/8     teaspoons       freshly ground black pepper
1/8     teaspoons       whole coriander seed -- ground fine
1               (8-ounce) salmon fillet -- pin bones removed
1               orange cut into wedges with white -- pithy membrane removed
1       tablespoons     dry vermouth

Instructions

Take a 15 by 36-inch piece of parchment paper and fold in 1/2 like a
book. Draw a large 1/2 heart on paper with fold of paper being the
center of the heart. Cut out heart and open. Lay fennel, leeks,
carrots, and snow peas on parchment in center to 1 side of fold. Mix
together salt, pepper, and ground coriander. Sprinkle vegetables with
1/2 of salt, pepper, and coriander. Lay salmon on top of vegetables
and season with remaining salt, pepper and coriander. Top with the
orange wedges and sprinkle with vermouth. Fold other side of heart
over fish and starting at top of heart shape, fold up both edges of
parchment, overlapping folds as you move along. Once you reach the
end tip, twist several times to secure tightly. Place on microwave
safe plate and cook for 4 minutes, on high in microwave, or until
fish reaches 131 degrees. Open parchment carefully and serve for a
complete meal.
