Very true.  Early childbirth is very damaging to girls, and has a high
correlation with health problems in the baby, due to prematurity and
other problems.

It's post parturition depression. Very common, when a woman becomes

The few that had an abortion were depressed because of the pressure and
guilt put on them by their familys.  Remember; pro-life means anti-choice.
These women, girls really, were not ready to be mothers.  One had a history
of depression prior to the abortion.

Nope.  Women who &quot;regret&quot; aborting tend to be poor on coping skills in

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;nyms to hide from the elders at his KH, doesn't care.  JWs believe the woman
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;should pay for her dreadful sin of having sex even if it kills her or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;destroys her life.  They would still stone them to death if the laws allowed
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;them to do so.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I know however if liars are not challenged the less intelligent will
&gt; &gt;&gt; accept their lies. So they need to be corrected. All evil needs is to
&gt; &gt;&gt; be ignored to triumph.

&gt; &gt;Abortion isn't evil, but forcing women to gestate is.

&gt; &gt;Tell me, do you wear women's undies when you post as a female?

&gt; I never post as a female. My wife volunteers at a women's shelter and
&gt; Planned Parenthood. I man a crisis hot line 4 evenings a week, and
&gt; listen to women who are depressed often.

Looking at it logically.. the first choice that was made was to have sexual
relations with a male. 90% of all pregnancy are borne from consentual sex.

So, by having sex (protected or unprotected, on or off 'the pill)
constitutes the acknowledgement that pregnancy is an option.

When they get pregnant, suddenly they aren't ready to deal with the
consequences of their actions - they're 'too young' or too interested in
continuing to party or feel that they haven't received enough education,
etc. etc. etc.

The end result is that the pregnancy, a living human being with a soul sent
by/from God the Father, is now in their womb. Personally, abortion is never
a choice - it's a cop-out. No matter what the consequence(s) may be for
going through with the pregnancy, those are consequences that the woman
acknowledged at the time she chose to start having sex, and she should have
to live with them and/or the new being God has formed in their womb.

Some of you may reference cases of rape or situations where having the baby
might kill the mother in the process. How the pregnancy began doesn't
matter - God uses/used that situation to gift the woman by entrusting a new
soul to her. She should be willing to die to give birth to the new being  -
that is what the love of a mother should be/is all about. And as this is a
Christian newsgroup, we ought to strive to be Christ-like... Christ died for
us.

Be willing to die for someone else.

Your non existent Christ died for 3 days before his decomposing corpse

First, you have exactly zero evidence that a soul is involved at any
point in time close to conception.

Second, millenia of human lar and tradition have put the start of a
person life at birth.  That means that a embryo is not a person.
