Head Gasket Problem, '02 Pontiac Grand Prix

I'm currently attending college in upstate New York, about 200 miles
from my home (and my regular mechanic).  During the past week or two, I
would occasionally smell antifreeze after parking my car (a 2002
Pontiac Grand Prix), but I figured it could wait until Thanksgiving
break, when I could take it to my mechanic and get it taken care of.

Apparently not.  I brought my car to get an oil change today, and about
30 seconds after pulling the car into the garage the mechanic came into
the waiting room holding a plastic cap in his hand and told me that he
wasn't going to change the oil because there was a problem with my head
gasket, and antifreeze was getting mixed into my oil.  He recommended
that I take it to a mechanic as soon as possible and get it repaired to
prevent my motor from getting destroyed.

The problem is that I'm far from my regular mechanic and I'm pretty
uneasy about driving 200 miles home with a damaged head gasket.  So I'm
curious about how much a repair is likely to cost and I'm wondering if
there's anything I should know about this kind of problem before I
start looking for a mechanic.  I realize the details I've given are
kind of vague, but my knowledge of head gaskets (and engines in
general) is pretty limited.  Are there any national chains that I
should look into for this kind of work, or, better yet, does anyone
have any recommendations of good mechanics in the Capital District of
New York?

Thanks,
Bill

What engine in the car 3.4 if so it is much more likely it is an intake
gasket than a head gasket. To be sure, if no one recommends a mech. I would
let a GM dealer do this. Post back which engine , the 3800 is an entirely
different issue. PS, I am in the Lake George are, by coincidence. I would
not drive this period or the engine will suffer internal damage, if coolant
has reached the oil!!!

Bill,
I just happen to live in the area.  You can try H&amp;V Autocare in Troy,
but I think they're focusing more on collision repair these days.  If
they tell you they won't, see if they have a place they suggest.  I've
done business with them in the past, they're a good shop and are not
in business to gouge customers.

You can also try Mark's automotive in Clifton Park, I know they do
some major mechanical repairs, and I even got a quote for HG
replacement several years ago.

You can also ask around, even with your professors, see who people at
the school suggest.

If all else fails, try the Pontiac/GMC dealer on Rte. 9 in Latham or
New Country Pontiac/GMC/Buick in Mechanicville (just bought my car
there).

Whatever you do, don't tell them what the other shop said, just
mention that you THINK you have coolant in your oil but want it
diagnosed and repaired.  If you tell them it's the HG's, they'll
repair that, even if it turns out to be only the intake gaskets.

It looks like it's a 3100.

Right, I don't plan to drive it at all except for the trip to the
mechanic's.  I'm a little worried that I may have already done damage
though, since I've been driving it for at least a week without any idea
what was happening.

Cool, thanks for the advice.  I'm lacking enough in common sense that I
probably would have gone in and mentioned the head gasket. :)  I'll
give those guys a call.

Very unlikely its a head gasket.
Very probable its the intake gaskets.
If there is water in the oil, then don't drive
it unless its a very short trip to the mech/tech.

I would not drive the vehicle at all...not even to the repair
facility.   Find someone to fix it and have it towed in.  Coolant and
bearings do not get along well at all.  This is one of those cases
where a $30 tow could save you a $3k engine.

I'm curious how you made out with this.  Did you find a shop and get
it fully diagnosed?  What shop did you use?
