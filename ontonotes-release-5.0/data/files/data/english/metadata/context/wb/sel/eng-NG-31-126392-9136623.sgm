[Discussions of topicality are always topical. Nothing in this article
should be construed as suggesting otherwise - where I say something like
&quot;only &lt;foo&gt; is topical here&quot;, this should be read as if it said &quot;only
&lt;foo&gt; and topicality discussions are topical here&quot;!]

One of the (several) bugbears that haunts this group is the issue of
topicality. There appear to be several topicality camps within clc at the
moment, which I'll attempt to categorise as neutrally as I can manage.
I'll assign a name and a letter to each group in an attempt to make it
easier for us all to discuss the various camps.

Group P (Purists): only code that can be written entirely in K&amp;R C, C90, or
C99 is topical here; where functions or symbols that are not defined by
the Standard are mentioned, the source code should be available, at least
in principle, and that source code should be written entirely in one of
the above &quot;standard dialects&quot;. Citations from K&amp;R, from either of the
ISO/IEC 9899 documents, or from drafts are all acceptable.

Group N (Neopurists): only code that can be written entirely in the latest
version of C is topical here; where functions or symbols that are not
defined by the Standard are mentioned, the source code should be
available, at least in principle, and that source code should be written
entirely in C99. Drafts of the Standard don't count, and any citation from
a draft is off-topic.

Group C (Conservatives): whilst the principal focus should be on standard
C, discussions of particular implementations and extensions for
illustrative purposes are acceptable.

Group M (Moderates): As well as standard C, common extensions should be
considered topical (e.g. those that are common in Windows (GUI and
console) and in Unix-a-likes).

Group X (eXperimentalists): These folks would like discussions of possible
changes and enhancements to the language to be considered topical.

Group L (Liberals): Anything written in a vaguely C-like syntax or in a
language based on C is topical (including C++, Objective-C, Java, and C#).

Group A (Anarchists): Anything and everything is topical, including device
drivers, Shrek, CD marker pens, jokes about viola players, and the
Metropolitan District of South Humberside.

At present, the majority of regular contributors fall into group P, or so
it seems to me, but all the other groups are represented here to a greater
or lesser degree.

Some fall into more than one camp - for example, at least one person (who
will remain nameless!) appears to be both a Neopurist and a Liberal (or
possibly a Moderate), despite the apparent contradiction between these
positions.

When deciding what is topical and what is not, we should remember that
comp.lang.c is *not* the only newsgroup in town. There are newsgroups for
discussing the language definition, POSIX, Windows, and individual
implementations. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that some people
gravitate towards comp.lang.c even though their discussion subject bears
little or no relation to standard C. Should we be sending these folks on,
or should we be answering their questions here?

I have carefully refrained from putting forward my own opinion, partly
because I should imagine that just about everyone who reads this already
knows what it is, and partly because I don't want this thread to get
bogged down until people have had a chance to think about the issues for
themselves.

Any topicality stance is bound to have advantages *and* disadvantages. So
please think carefully before weighing in too heavily in favour of a
particular stance!

Thanks. Over to you.

Well if a reasonably suitable and active group, or groups, that are better
suited to the question exist, then, IMHO, a redirection is appropriate. The
tricky issue is what to do when no suitable group exists, or that such a
group appears to be dead. In this case, if someone knows something that
might possibly help the poster, then a suitably qualified answer with
possible redirections to other places on the Net might not be too out of
line.

Personally I don't think that disagreements on topicality are
the real source of acrimony in this group. The reasons are probably
psychological. If this was a marriage the couple would visit a
marriage counsellor but since there's no such thing as a newsgroup
counsellor we'll just have to accept that the acrimony will
continue and all the metadiscussion in the world about topicality
isn't going to change that. I've seen situations in various
message boards where some of the regulars , perfectly respectable
and knowledgeable people in their own right , did not get along
with each other and metadiscussion didn't change anything. So I'll
probably stay out of the rest of this discussion since I cosnider
it pointless.

I was really unsure how much of your post to quote or snip, without risking
being flamed all over the planet.
Let's hope for the best...

I'd vote against N (not enough compliant compilers around, if need be get a
group comp.lang.c99 created), X (comp.std.c is the group for this), L (There
are active groups available that deal with these topics and these topics are
too different from C) and A (would significantly affect the readbility and
S/N ratio here).
For X and L a _polite_ pointer to the relevant groups should do. I don't
care about politeness to Anarchists 8-).
Not sure about M (e.g. POSIX is at least a fully fledged standard, Windows
is not). I think a short (and polite) answer plus a redirect/pointer to an
appropriate group should be OK.
Leaves (for me) P and C.

I don't weigh in on this newsgroup often, but I do pay attention to as
much of it as is possible, so I'd like to think that I do hold some
reasonable views on the subject.

I wholeheartedly agree that there are other places for X, L, and A...
the newsgroup name may be perhaps misleading to some of those in group
X, but, as others have said, a pointer to comp.std.c should be
sufficient.

Group M is a bit trickier. I would say that, in general, those posters
should be redirected to the appropriate newsgroup (if possible and if
anyone knows it); however, it seems that sometimes the regulars here
can be overzealous in pointing out off-topic posts. If a code example
given in a question simply CONTAINS references to some non-standard
extensions, but the question applies to other (standard) things, I'd
say it's very relevant here.

Out of the remaining three, I'd place myself most in group C. I don't
find a problem with providing  much of anything (including non-
standard or non-portable examples) for illustrative purposes, because
it may provide someone reading the topic with some insight for the
future.

As for group N... while I personally try to make my code as C99-
conformant as possible, and take advantages of the new features it
provides when possible, I agree with Joachim that it's not completely
implemented in a large enough number of compilers and standard
libraries to be the ONLY possible discussion topic.

Besides my above mention of why I prefer group C to group P, I have
one more (slight) objection to raise to group P. Namely, it's been 17
years since C90... why should anyone still be encouraging K&amp;R C styles
or providing examples in K&amp;R C? As demonstrated from C99 (with the
removal of implicit int), more and more of it may become obsolete in
the future. I feel it's our responsibility to point this out to
posters who mention the C Programming Language (ed. 1) or give
examples that reek of K&amp;R C. I'd like to have the same objection to
C90, but C99 just hasn't seen a lot of implementation - certainly not
enough to make C90 anywhere near obsolescent.

It is OK to point out that K&amp;R(pre ANSI) style is obsolecent, but it isn't
off topic IMHO.
Where else should the person having such code ask for

There's quite a difference between encourage and call something off topic.

IMHO, setting strict limits on topicality is a futile exercise.
As a general principle why not just agree that any topic of
interest related to C programming is appropriate, otherwise
ignored? Marginally topical issues will inevitably be discussed
whatever formal guidelines are adopted.

Topicality is always on topic.

Personally, I'm in group C; references to specific implementations
(including the DS9k) should be considered acceptable for _illustrative_
purposes.  I can see the point of the P folks because it's a slippery slope,
but the educational value of providing examples of _why_ something is
nonportable outweighs the risk, IMHO.

It'd be a lot easier for me to join group P if there were comp.lang.c.posix
and comp.lang.c.windows.  Shuffling people off to platform-specific groups
that are not specific to C and do not have the C expertise available here,
even if they do discuss C a lot by default, doesn't seem friendly.

I guess I'm mostly in group C, then, with occasional forays into group X.

Basically, I think the topic of this group should be &quot;the language C in
the real world&quot;, as opposed to &quot;the language C as described in the
standard&quot;, which is on-topic in comp.std.c. In the real world, C is a
group of dialects, and while the principal focus should be on elements
of the standard language, I see nothing wrong in discussing the
idiosyncracies of a specific dialect.

There is a long standing convention that discussion of topicality is
always topical.

I consider pre-standard C to be topical, and C as defined by all
versions of the standard, including drafts (some implementations may
have been updated to be in line with a draft before the next version is
published).

I see nothing wrong with using real (or imaginary) implementations to
make a point. Sometimes even posting a snippet of assembler to
illustrate what optimisations a compiler can do is appropriate.

Questions asking &quot;can you do X&quot; or &quot;is Y part of standard C&quot; are always
acceptable in my opinion. The answer might be no, or only by using
extensions, but that is not a problem.

Questions about the Windows API or Unix extensions or extensions for
embedded systems I would not consider topical, since there are
groups/mailing-lists/web-forums focused on these things. The same
applies to instructions on how to install/use specific toolsets,
although the odd suggestion of switches to get better diagnostics is fine.

Questions about which toolset to use are marginally topical but probably
better dealt with on groups about the relevant OS. I'm unlikely to
complain about such discussions.

I see nothing wrong with providing an answer to a question I consider to
be off topic *provided* it includes a redirection to somewhere more
appropriate for the discussion to be continued.

I also don't mind the odd digression, although I reserve the right to be
a grumpy git at times.

I'll vote for C.

Firstly what irritates some people is not so much the fact of off-topic
redirections as the tone. Supercilious references to &quot;your particular
platform&quot; when the particular platform is Windows don't always help. The
reality is that for many people Windows is computing, and no one likes to be
made to feel inferior because he doesn't have a nice Unix box to play with.

Then I don't think there is enough in the standard itself to sustain a
newsgroup. There is a limit to the amount you can say about padding and
bitfields. Nor, and this is strictly a personal view, do I find
standards-based threads the most useful.

If we are move away from the standard that implies some relaxation of
topicality. This implies a certain amount of commonsense. A thread about
linked lists is appropriate, but there comes a point at which data
structures become so specialised as to belong in comp.programming. However
it is not the end of the world if the line isn't always drawn exactly where
it ought to be. Similarly indscussion of particular compilers or development
environments. There comes a point at which the discussion ceases to be of
any interest to those who don't use those tools, however knowing that xcc
has a flag to turn on bounds checking and that it is implemented with triple
pointers is not that point.

Also quantity is important. For instance one poster to comp.programming used
to write about left-wing politics, though with some relation to programming.
A single thread on Marxist analysis of software development is OK, if there
are constant atempts to derail every programming discussion into politics
then it become wearing. The same goes for people's projects. We are
interested in hearing what you are working on, but not ad nauseum.

A problem with that is that off-topic answers tend to lead to lengthy

I think this is probably the most important criterion to keep in mind.
If there is already another place for these discussions, then it should
be moved on.

However, I do also believe that part of the problem stems from the way
in which these redirections are communicated, or, worse, not
communicated.

There are quite a few posts that simply state that something is
off-topic, with no help to the poster as to where to go instead. It
would greatly help if that information were included, where possible, in
the response post. A small paragraph with part of the answer, or even
the whole answer is probably ok as well, as long as it's accompanied by
the note that it's offtopic and where to find the better source of
information.

If you don't know the answer, and you don't know where a better forum
would be, and you're not feeling kindly dispositioned today, you should
probably refrain from answering at all.

If you do know the answer, or you think you do, and you know it's
off-topic, by all means, provide what you think is the answer, expand
the newsgroups header, set a follow-up, and say in your post that there
is a better forum to discuss this.

Positivie answers are generally better received than all-negative ones.

I don't like this one, even if there were really a way to come up with
a reasonable definition of &quot;common&quot; that everyone could agree on. That

I actually think this category should be welcomed far more warmly than
it is.  There is a real difference between comp.lang.c and comp.std.c
when it comes to discussing possible future additions to the language.

Personally I would not mind seeing serious proposals from qualified
proposers (and that includes Jacob) for extensions to the language.  I
think they actually belong in comp.lang.c before they belong anywhere
else.

As members of the C committee have pointed out, proposals for language
extensions and library additions have a much greater chance of being
taken seriously if they have wide support, and even more so if there
is a working implementation.

And I think comp.lang.c is the best place to find out if such
proposals have wide support.  Plus feedback provided here could help
the proposer sharpen and fine-tune the proposal.

Then such a proposal could be made in comp.std.c with a pointer to the
discussion threads here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

And again, no way.

So I'll have the P, with a side order of C and just a pinch of M. With

Wikipedia expresses it pretty well (entry on &quot;meta&quot;):

Meta (from Greek: μετά = &quot;after&quot;, &quot;beyond&quot;, &quot;with&quot;), is a prefix
used in English in order to indicate a concept which is an abstraction
from another concept, used to complete or add to the latter. The Greek
meta is equivalent to the Latin post.

In epistemology, the prefix meta- is used to mean about (its own
category). For example, metadata are data about data (who has produced
it, when, what format the data are in and so on). Similarly, metamemory
in psychology means an individual's knowledge about whether or not they
would remember something if they concentrated on recalling it.

&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta &gt;

So &quot;metatopical&quot; could be considered topicality about topicality.

That's a bit too extreme, but if we replace the part after the
semicolon with &quot;functions or symbols not defined by the Standard
can be mentioned only if their meaning is either self-evident or
clearly explained by the poster, and if the &quot;core&quot; of the matter
being discussed doesn't lie in them.&quot; it would be perfectly
reasonable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The silliest thing about this, excluding the scarce availability
of C99 compilers, is that, since TC1, 2 and 3 have been accepted,
n1256 accurately reflects the *current* state of the Standard,
while the Real Thing is outdated.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Perfectly reasonable. Writing &quot;assuming CHAR_BIT is 8 and we're
using the ASCII charset&quot; shouldn't make a post OT, and neither
should &quot;For example, on Unix-like systems...&quot; as long as it is
really just an example.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Group X (eXperimentalists): These folks would like discussions of
&gt; possible changes and enhancements to the language to be considered
&gt; topical.

If they come across in a discussion about C-as-is, and the crux of
the matter doesn't become C-as-it-could-be, OK, but comp.std.c is
out there for a reason, isn't it?

Well, no, but how comes that subthreads about the sign of complex
numbers or quantum physics survive much longer than any thread
starting with a mention of a POSIX function? :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; At present, the majority of regular contributors fall into group P, or
&gt; so it seems to me, but all the other groups are represented here to a
&gt; greater or lesser degree.

&gt; Some fall into more than one camp - for example, at least one person
&gt; (who will remain nameless!) appears to be both a Neopurist and a Liberal
&gt; (or possibly a Moderate), despite the apparent contradiction between
&gt; these positions.

&gt; When deciding what is topical and what is not, we should remember that
&gt; comp.lang.c is *not* the only newsgroup in town. There are newsgroups
&gt; for discussing the language definition, POSIX, Windows, and individual
&gt; implementations. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that some people
&gt; gravitate towards comp.lang.c even though their discussion subject bears
&gt; little or no relation to standard C. Should we be sending these folks
&gt; on, or should we be answering their questions here?

&gt; I have carefully refrained from putting forward my own opinion, partly
&gt; because I should imagine that just about everyone who reads this already
&gt; knows what it is, and partly because I don't want this thread to get
&gt; bogged down until people have had a chance to think about the issues for
&gt; themselves.

&gt; Any topicality stance is bound to have advantages *and* disadvantages.
&gt; So please think carefully before weighing in too heavily in favour of a
&gt; particular stance!
">

Using common sense should in theory be a more accurate way to
decide what's topical than clause 1 of ISO/IEC 9899:1999, at
least for people who have some and know how to use it. Too bad
that not everybody does. ;-)

The original &quot;meta-&quot; word of this kind is metaphysics, which was the
name given to one of Aristotle's works.  In that case, the meaning is
said to be &quot;after&quot;, in that the work was taught after Aristotle's
&quot;Physics&quot;.

The relation between the subject matter of Aristotle's Physics and

probably influenced the use of the prefix in English as much as

I don't feel that the topic is a problem, but how it is policed is.

Topicality breaches should not be clamped down on every single time, and
that topicality policing should both be friendly and explain properly to
the poster /why/ their post is offtopic and /where/ they can get the
info they seek.

On top of that, I think that simply mentioning an
implementation-specific feature or using it within a posted program
shouldn't be a crime, especially if it's obvious to that the problem is
a standard C problem. For example, consider the following program:

#include &lt;conio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void) {
char *name = &quot;David&quot;;
gotoxy(10,20);
printf(&quot;Hello, %c!\n&quot;,name);
return 0;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
}
">

While it is not standard C, because it uses &lt;conio.h&gt; and gotoxy(), I
feel that the ideal response to this would be to politely explain that
implementation-specific features are offtopic but to point out the
problem anyway, because the problem here is in standard C code[1]. I do
/not/ think that redirection would be appropriate.

I think that topicality violators are often treated with a short temper
here, because the regulators are tired of such violations. However
because there are so many different people asking questions, it might be
their first time posting here and so simply shouting &quot;Offtopic!&quot; at them

I also think it is childish that some posters will immediately jump on
anyone mentioning C++ or (horrors!) &quot;C/C++&quot;. Questions about C++ are
offtopic. But simply mentioning these things is not. This problem is
even mentioned in the clc++ FAQ, question 5.4:

'Do not refer to &quot;C/C++.&quot; Some people get testy about that, and will
(unfortunately!) ignore everything else you say just to correct you with
something like, &quot;There is no such language.&quot; It borders on pathetic, but
you'll probably be okay if you say &quot;C or C++&quot; instead of &quot;C/C++.&quot; Sigh.'

In short, while I would put myself into the C group above, I feel that
minor topicality infractions should be tolerated, and blatant ones
treated with patience.

&gt;&gt;Meta (from Greek: [...] = &quot;after&quot;, &quot;beyond&quot;, &quot;with&quot;), is a prefix
&gt;&gt;used in English in order to indicate a concept which is an abstraction
&gt;&gt;from another concept, used to complete or add to the latter. The Greek
&gt;&gt;meta is equivalent to the Latin post.

&gt; The original &quot;meta-&quot; word of this kind is metaphysics, which was the
&gt; name given to one of Aristotle's works.  In that case, the meaning is
&gt; said to be &quot;after&quot;, in that the work was taught after Aristotle's
&gt; &quot;Physics&quot;.

&gt; The relation between the subject matter of Aristotle's Physics and
&gt; Metaphysics (&quot;natural philosophy&quot; and &quot;ontological philosophy&quot;) has
&gt; probably influenced the use of the prefix in English as much as
&gt; meaning of the Greek prefix itself has.
">

Orinally it was purely a librarians' term, referring to the shelving of the
two volumes.
Now it means &quot;applied to itself&quot;. You often need a meta-discussion about say
the medium of communication, or rules for functioning of the group. Or you
might want to do a meta-study about how scientists come to their
conclusions, or write a meta-language for describing other programming
languages.

&quot;Metaphysics&quot; is now an exception. It doesn't mean &quot;physical things applied
to other physical things&quot;, but &quot;what arises from the physical world but is
not of it&quot;.

The problem I have is when the question is cross posted to the C and C++

&gt; important as very few use just pure ISO C.

[...]

Why would the OP have been sent to a Unix group to ask about &quot;spawn&quot;?
That's not a Unix function.

I don't remember the specific discussion, but IMHO a reasonable
response to someone asking about &quot;spawn&quot; would have been something
like:

The &quot;spawn&quot; function is not part of standard C.  You'll get better
information if you ask in a newsgroup that discusses whatever
operating system you're using.  The standard C function &quot;system&quot;
*might* server your purposes, but it's hard to tell without more
information about what you're trying to do.

If the OP asked something like &quot;How do I use spawn&quot;, I might also
suggest that a better question would be &quot;How do I do foo&quot;, where the
OP needs to replace &quot;foo&quot; with whatever goal he's trying to achieve
rather than assuming a specific solution.

And ideally, if the OP really did need information about &quot;spawn&quot;, that
would be the end of it as far as comp.lang.c is concerned.  Of course,
due to the asynchronous nature of Usenet, there will inevitably be
multiple replies saying more or less the same thing -- and perhaps one
or two trying to explain how to use &quot;spawn&quot; (with subtle errors)
without bothering to mention that it's not portable.

I'd try to provide a more specific redirection if I knew what system
provides &quot;spawn&quot; (I honestly don't), but surely the OP knows what
system he's using, and can find a more appropriate newsgroup or other
forum himself.

I generally quote from n1256.pdf.  This is not just a draft un-issued
document; it consists of the C99 standard as amended by TC1, TC2, and
TC3, all four of which are official documents issued by the ISO C
committee.  I could construct a citation by using the official C99
standard and carefully cross-referencing the section number against
TC1, TC2, and TC3 (I have copies of all four documents), but it would
take several time as long, and I expect that the result would be
exactly the same -- except that it would introduce more opportunities
for error than just citing n1256.  I trust the editors who produced
n1256 to have gotten it right; I see no point in re-doing their work.
In a critical context (say, where a contract requires strict standard
conformance), I'd go to the trouble of checking the actual standard
and the TCs (even if the TCs are excluded, I'd want to know about any
changes) -- but a Usenet post is not nearly that critical.

In cases where n1256 differs from C99, I mention it.

Do you *really* maintain that n1256 isn't good enough for citations in
the casual discussion that is comp.lang.c?

I know of exactly one person who commonly quotes from a pre-C99 draft,
n869, and I've complained about that myself.

I object to your use of the word &quot;censorship&quot;.  I am not able to

I disagree.  If nobody ever points out that some posts are off-topic,
this newsgroup will most likely become known as a place where you can
ask about anything with &quot;C&quot; in its name.  (That may be an
exaggeration, but it's not much of one.)

I for one don't want this newsgroup to discuss POSIX-specific
functionality, or Windows-specific functionality, or C++ or C# or
Objective-C.  There are *already* newsgroups for those things.
comp.lang.c is the *only* newsgroup for discussion of standard C; I
don't want to lose that.

I'll grant you that some of us are sometimes a bit too abrupt in
pointing out that something should be discussed elsewhere.  Pretending
that some system-specific function doesn't exist is less than
constructive; if I happen to recognize the name &quot;fork&quot;, for example,
I'll suggest posting to comp.unix.programmer rather than asking to see
the source code for &quot;fork&quot; in portable standard C.  Insults are
inappropriate, except perhaps in the most blatant cases of abuse.

In my opinion, the trolls are a much bigger problem than the so-called
Net Nannies.  There are several posters here whose only purpose in
life seems to be to complain, and who rarely if ever make any
technical contribution.  (I certainly don't count you in that group,
Chris.)

By and large, it is polite. I'll admit I don't like &quot;What is your C
language question?&quot; I've also complained in the past about the &quot;willful

Neither am I, actually! But I wanted to give people /some/ kind of common
