I have a problem with hooking up my steering column to the mustang II rack.
The clearance is a bitch. The truck has a small block and mustang II IFS
setup. The exhaust is a corvette rams horn. This helped to allow clearance.
The linkage cant go straight so I need to bend it around the obstacles.

Ididit has the joints at about $61 per joint plus double u joint at $140 plus
the rod and stabalizing bar thing. Is there an alternative to this expense?
Seems hard to believe that I need to spend @$300.00 for this set up. Please,
any help is appreciated.

The small headers that dump in the Centre can give you extra clearance. They
are about $100 per pair. But you have to put up with the extra noise. Do
not skimp on the steering components, if it costs it costs. . Despite what
our wives say we still have some value.

You might like to go find some less expensive U-joints. I personally don't
think much of &quot;billet&quot; things and would rather have forged parts.

I don't read attachments to posts as they may give me a
virus If I expect an attachment from you I will open it..
You may have a brilliant thought but if you put it into an
attachment I won't read it and thus both you and I lose.
I don't like to say it but unfortunatly, there are those who
insist upon being nasty to the rest of us. Bob May
