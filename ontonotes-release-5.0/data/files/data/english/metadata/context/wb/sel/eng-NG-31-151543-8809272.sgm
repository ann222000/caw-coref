Hi Rivendellians and other classic riders-

I have heard from many of you . So far we want GG bridge north ,
south....we want coastal.  How many of you have ever ridden across the
Golden Gate Bridge? On a Sunday (or Saturday, we haven't decided that
yet) it is packed with tourists- and worse, many are on rented
mountain bikes coming right at you with no inclination of danger or
even, manners. You barely have handle bar clearance from the closeness
of the pedestrians. Just putting that out there-I certainly would
never stand in the way of someone wanting to make that steep twisty
climb up through the anti-terror barricades and making it through the
skinny gate-way and then, in total headwind, crossing that beautiful
International Orange landmark . My only issue would be riders getting
lost or slammed by a tourist.We could certainly work the bridge in if
we do that side of the Bay in September.

With that said, we have many options for a coastal ride. We could do
the SF side and ride Mt Tam to Stintson Beach.or Stintson Beach to
Mill Valley via Tamalpais. .or we could check out the Presidio.Or we
could go south and ride on HWY one to Davenport from Santa Cruz and do
the Swanton Loop in the redwoods, coming up for air at Bonny Doon and
that area. The good news is, the beaches are warmer in fall than
summer. So put your wooly thinking caps on and email me privately with
your ideas, suggestions, dreams...

April

When I used to commute over the GG Bridge, I found a couple things:
1. A bell can double your speed in the morning; foreign tourists actually
know what a bell signifies.
2. The bikes coming AT you are commuters and training cyclists (who ride two
abreast). The mtb tourists generally go north over the bridge, and return
via the Tiburon ferry.
3. In the evening, cyclists used to use the ocean side (no peds). No idea if
this is currently the case. This was way back when singlespeed cyclists used
to acknowledge each other... :^)
4. The fog and the wind can be real buzzkills, unless you get into the epic
aspect of the thing. Look out for the big wet metal plates! Riding around
the North tower when the foghorn goes off below you is kind of an intense
experience.

Ah, it's too bad you can't do the Swanton Loop in strawberry season! Oh, my.
Philip

Weekend bicycle bridge traffic is routed to the west walkway.  The tourists
and pedestrians are shuttled over to the east (city) side. My experiences
have been uniformally positive in dealing with other cyclists, on rental
bikes or otherwise.

Yeah, I ride the west sidewalk of the Golden Gate
Bridge at least 4 times per week.  She must be
describing a different bridge than the one I ride on.

For the record, the east sidewalk ( the crowded side)
is open everyday for ped's and on weekdays for bikes.
however, on those same days, the bikes are allowed to
use the west sidewalk after 3:30 pm when the
maintenance crews are off work. No ped's are allowed
on the west sidewalk at anytime. So, I do try to
reserve my crossing times to weekends, holidays, or
after 3:30 on weekdays to avoid the throngs of ped's
one will encounter on the east side.

Terroism barricades? ! ? Where and what are they?  I
must be slipping through their net !  :)

Actually, I stand corrected. I now think she is
referring to the staggered K-rails at the bottom of
the pathway between the north/west parking lot and
Fort Baker. Those are easyly perceived as barricades,
although they have been there for years.  I so seldom
ride down there that I forgot about them.  Most of us
who cross the bridge on a regular basis stay &quot;on top&quot;
and follow Bridgeway to and from Sausalito. I stand
corrected also about the winds.  They can be
problematic, but no more so than winds anywhere.

I like the bridge, and rode it all the time when I lived in the Marina
of San Francisco. Now I live in Berkeley, the bridge is still my
preferred way to Marin because I am trying to avoid driving to my
rides (i take BART to the city then ride it across). Never had
problem, or even close call with anyone. The west side is only open to
cyclists during the time it's open, and even though it can get windy
often, the experience of looking out the pacific ocean invigorating,
and it's really quite short. Going up to the bridge is neither steep
nor twisty (there are certainly steeper pitches in Marin county, in
fact right off the bridge) and if you descend via Alexander, it's not
that twisty. There are some barricades on both sides if you take
certain route to the bridge, but I welcome them as they fenced the
cars off.

Once you get past the bridge, there is so many rides you can do. You
can ride to Tomales through inland route and take the coast back and
ride the tail wind; you can ride Tam from Fairfax and descend into
Mill Valley; you can ride to the lighthouse in Pt Reyes. I guess I
prefer rides in Marin because I could get to them without getting into
a car.

Sounds good to me. I'm not a fan of riding the GG Bridge. One time I
was riding it with my son in the trailer. As I went around a pylon,
the wind picked up the trailer and moved it three feet to the side!

But I'm in Mendocino right now, planning to ride home to the south
bay, and there's no avoiding the bridge unless I detour considerably
east and take a ferry, so a Golden Gate crossing is in my near future.

This strand just shows you that planning a social ride is like nailing
Jell-o to the fence. Opinons vary on steep, twsity, windy and what is
or is not a barricade.

Thanks Anne, I hope to see you on the Social- it will NOT be including
the GG Bridge, By popular demand, BTW. be careful of the winds, in
whichever direction they blow you.

I'll join you in spirit- from clear across the country.
Maybe I'll have some ceremonial Jello...blue, like my Rambouillet perhaps?   :)
