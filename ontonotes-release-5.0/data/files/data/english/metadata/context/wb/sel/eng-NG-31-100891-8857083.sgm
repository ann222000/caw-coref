Hi Everyone...

One of my female rats (about 1-1/2 years old) has a tumor near her
left armpit on her chest.  I've done a bit of online reading and based
on things I've read, it &quot;appears&quot; to be a benign tumor, but I'm not
sure.  The reason I believe it may be benign, is that it's very
&quot;movable&quot; and soft and has not, as of yet, affected my rat in regards
to movement, appetite, disposition, pain, etc.  I read that with these
kind of tumors, they essentially get so big, the rat can't move...
and this is exactly what I see happening to my girl.   I noticed this
tumor about just over a month ago. I took her to the vet a couple
weeks ago and paid the ridiculous fee just to have her seen, and this
particular vet, whom I've never been to before, seemed to know nothing
about rodents or anything.  My impression was that he was BS'ing his
way around things just to appease me.  He told me it would be around
$400 to test and remove the tumor.  Yikes!   Crazy IMHO, especially in
view of the fact that these loving little creatures have such a short
lifespan.  I feel he was trying to ream me.  Does this price range
sound normal?  I called my local humane society to see if they could
refer to me someone who even has a knowledge of working on rodents or
if they could refer me to low cost veterinary care somewhere...
they couldn't help.  I also called a few veterinary hospitals in my
area, and from what they told me that although they could do it, none
of them worked much on rodents much.  Can someone refer me to anywhere
that has a listing of particular areas with vets that have an
expertise, or at least know SOMETHING about rodents?   Or even who I
could ask for referrals.  The pet store didn't know anything either!
&lt;sigh&gt;   I ache to have my little girl taken care of, but financially,
I just can't do it.  I hate being gouged by people.

Any suggestions?  Thanks.

Sad Rattie Momma.

It costs me $150 for surgery to get tumours removed from rats. The fee
is based on the length of time it takes the vet to do the surgery. I
wonder if your vet was charging so much because he didn't want to do
the job?

I know these critters have a short life and are cheap to purchase, but
honestly, they are not cheap to look after simply because of the vet
fees. At least your little girl only has one tumour!

If you look in the yellowpages (or whatever your equivalent is) some
rat savvy vets will list themselves as exotic vets.

I'm assuming that you are in the US or Canada. You could try the
following links for vet listings. There is one link (bottom) with some
UK vets, but that list isn't very extensive.
http://www.ratfanclub.org/vetref.html
http://www.rmca.org/Vets/ (there are a whole heap listed here!)

I hope your girl can get the tumour removed and get well soon.

Thank you so much for the links below.  $150 I can manage, but $400 is
very steep for me.  I'll search through the links and also check out
vets in the phone book that list themselves as exotic vets.  This
helps me a lot. :)

Thanks again!

P.S.  I'm in Southern California, USA

I know what you mean about vets knowing how to charge and, at least here in
UK, it seems to differ quite a bit from vet to vet.

I think what I'd do is search for rodent rescue centres in California via
Google and then contact them see if they can recommend a good vet that
doesn't charge the earth.  You could also join rodent/rat forums and put a
post up asking if anybody can recommend a good vet in your area.  Somebody
here may even reply recommending one.  Also if the treatment is going to be
too much for you to pay all at once it may be worth asking if you could have
a payment plan where you pay in installments.  Not all vets will allow this
but some do.

I hope you manage to find a good vet for your girl.  Good luck!

Thank you Tracey.

I am thrilled to say that after checking one of the links Dewi posted
above, I found a vet in my area who, incidently, no longer works on
rats, but was able to refer to me to an exotic vet who is pretty local
to me.  This exotic vet has done numerous tumor removal surgeries on
rats with successful results, and that gives me great peace of mind.
And...   she charges half of what that first vet quoted me, and he
didn't even know what he was doing!   I made an appointment for my
little girl and I am very relieved, to say the least! :)

Thanks again for your help and support.
