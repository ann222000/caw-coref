Hello,

This is my first post here, and I would like to ask about the
instrument that is used to probe and explore the teeth upon
examination for caries, etc. I fear this exam so much that it is the
primary reason I hesitate to visit the dentist. It is very painful
when it hits a nerve, and I sit expentantly waiting for this pain
throughout the entire procedure, because it always comes. I know that
for any other procedure, filling, extraction, there is an anesthetic,
but not for this one, obviously because that is the intent of it, to
see a reaction.

I think too that moving this probe from tooth to tooth will pass
bacteria from one infected tooth or gum to another.

I have begged my dentist to not use this instrument, to try another
way, air, etc. but he insists that this is the best way to detect
problems. He did relent once and used air, but he seemed irritated
that I was insistent. I like him as a dentist but for this one
procedure.

So is there another, better way to detect cavities without using this
metal probe?

Thanks for any help,
Sandr

You could extract all the teeth and then examine them under the microscope.

While that may seem a bit harsh, was going to say the same thing.

However there is a new instrument called the DiagnoDent or something like that,
that supposedly detects dental caries (decay) with a laser light.

But really for an obviously carious tooth you don't need a probe, just good eyesight.
For the questionable tooth the probe is the best detector, can't really remember a
patient having pain while using one, but then again I have a light touch.

But, DiagnoDent is not useful if a filling is too close to the spot being
checked.

Also,,,,,,,,,, I got the impression the OP may be talking about a
perio-probe.  Just a feeling.

Could be.
That's something that I didn't consider.

IME perio probs are relatively easy to check w/o using a probe
in an aggresive manner.

Didn't know that about the diagnodent.
Stain or breakdown at the margin is my usual tip off.

DiagnoDent is really good for those borderline teeth with stained grooves
that you cannot feel any catches in and nothing shows up on the radiograph.
The device will give you a very reading on these teeth that you can use to
base your treatment decision on.

Are you talking about the explorer being used on top of the tooth to
find holes or between tooth and gums ? If you know you always get hit
by pain, is it always the same spot? What does your dentist say is
causing this?

If you can find a dentist who is not in a rush maybe you can convince
him to use anesthesia the next time he's probing your teeth..

I'm sorry, I don't understand about using anesthesia. I thought the
purpose of using the probe was to see if the probe would elicit any
painful reaction when it was inserted between the teeth or in the
grooves of the tops of the tooth. I thought no pain meant no problem.
Whenever I have had this exam, it was not just on one tooth, but my
entire mouth, every tooth, several times over even. When they are
finished, they tell me what teeth need filling.

San

Your pain might help finding things that are wrong, but for a usual
checkup that's not what it is about. The dentist should be able to do
this with your teeth numb or you sedated- so ask for these options the
next time you make an appointment.
