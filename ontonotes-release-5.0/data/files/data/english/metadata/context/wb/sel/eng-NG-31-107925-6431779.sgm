COT Drivers' View
I was curious if any RASNer might have info on what
drivers may have said when it comes to new perspectives
from inside the COT cockpit?

For example:
Did moving their seat towards the center of the car
affect their distance-judging or other kind of perception?

Did making the car 4 inches wider affect their
distance-judging from the wall or from other cars?

Did standing up the windshield affect vision at all?

Did lengthening the car &amp;/or trunk
change rear-view like when doing a 'slide job'?

Does the wing help or hurt rear vision?

I just haven't heard the Racin Media ask these questions
&amp; it seems to me they should have been asked, since there
have been a number of significant (if not radical) changes
that may affect driving ability.

My GUESSES, one and all:

Nope. I've driven karts (center seat) and late models (far left seat)
and a few other things here and there (Legends, Baby Grand - center
seats, VIR track days in Corvettes with left side seat) and going from
one to the other just never really has ever been an issue for me. As
such, I seriously doubt it would be an issue for a pro. You figure a
handful of these guys have driven Rolex Daytona protos the past few
years - they're center-seat bubble-top cockpits - and no worries have
arisen. Some have even won the Daytona 24 as co-drivers in these
cars... (Casey Mears, JPM?)

No, IMO. For the same reasons as cited above. Once you're hooked up in
your seat, you have visual reference points in the car in which to
guage where the extremes of the body "should be" (just like you and
your own street car). I'm sure these reference points were learned
quickly in the test sessions that lead up to Bristol. The only area
I've seen so far that would be a mild concern is the extreme right and
left edges of the splitter. They do protrude enough to worry about,
even if we can't say definitively if they were the cause to some of
those cut LRs this past Sunday. I personally *think* they could knock
off a valve stem, and maybe even rub enough sidewall rubber off a
competitor's tire to cause it to go down, but am not certain of it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Did standing up the windshield affect vision at all?
">

Yes, I'd think. It opened it up "up top" which is handy in short
banked bullrings like Bristol where you are literally looking out the
top of the windshield to see the track ahead (due to banking and sharp
corners). IOW, I think it helps at certain tracks (Bristol, Dover,
maybe even Richmond and Martinsville), and will have little to no
positive or negative affect most anywhere else. They may have to tape
up the top more at certain places when the sunlight and glare become
an issue tho.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Did lengthening the car &amp;/or trunk

I doubt it really. Slide jobs today, with today's cocoon-type seats
anyway, really require a good spotter to begin with. And honestly -
and don't laugh - you make passes like that almost as much on "sound &amp;
feel" as you do sight. When you're out there on the track, even
through a helmet and earplugs, you can tell where cars are around you
by their sound and/or feel. (Feel = racing engines put out a pretty
good rumble that is felt as well as heard when close to them
on-track...certainly when they're only inches away from your car, to
which you yourself are literally connected via a 6 or 7 point harness
system.) Ever been on a riding mower cutting grass and been able to
hear/feel another mower in the vicinty/neighborhood just by the
difference in harmonics between theirs and yours? Same thing. And it
is more pronounced, the closer together you are.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Does the wing help or hurt rear vision?

Have heard no complaints anywhere. I personally doubt, so long as the
wing is comparably as tall today as it was yesterday, that the view is
all that dissimilar. Again tho, with the seats the way they are, the
view has been limited for some time anyway. If it is a problem, it
could be easily addressed between people that make the seats and the
folks that make the mirrors IMO.

I don't think the typical Racin' Media will pick this type of
discussion up until there are drivers complaining about it, which
apparently isn't happening just yet. Lots of conjecture? Sure, but no
real complaints based on experience yet that I've heard. If issues do
develop, you can bet they'll pick it up since there are so many
outlets doing so many daily shows/columns now and yet they continue to
race only once a week, that stuff like this is perfect Tues-Thurs
media fodder.

Sim, et.al., Great 'sperience answers to great questions.
I encourage many more RASNer's to make this a long thread
to answer basic questions that should have been answered
long before SimRacer gave his answers.

The only thing I have heard is that it has moved the A pillar, so
that it's now in the way in places it didn't used to be (and by
the same token isn't in the way in places where it was).  I don't
think that's an issue at Bristol or Martinsville, where the drivers
look out the side window more than thru the windshield, but it
might be an annoyance at places like Dover &amp; Loudon.

Good questions, tho...now I'll be looking for answers :-)
