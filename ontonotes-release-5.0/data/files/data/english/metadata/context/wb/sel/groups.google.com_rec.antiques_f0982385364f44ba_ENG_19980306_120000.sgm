I have some questions about what I am calling a pharmacy or physicians
set. If anyone can lend any insight, it would be appreciated. I am an
antique newbie, forced to learn through the purchase of a 110 year old
house in Victorian Haddonfield NJ.

The set is oak, with a laquer type finish - kind of orange hue.

There are two cabinets, made to sit as one seven foot unit. The bottom
one is about 36 inches deep and wide. The top is 36 incehes wide, and
perhaps 18 inches deep. They have two oak framed glass doors and
antique brass hardware - very utilitarian and simple. This is
work-a-day stuff.

There is a four drawer chest, which is intended to be the end support
for the desk top. The chest is the same oak and laquer. There is a y
shaped brace which connects to the side of the desk and to the two 4 x 4
legs, which supports the desk top.

There is a second table, with x brace and four 4 x 4 legs.

The table legs are all oak with laquer. The table tops are black. It
looks as if they were originally painted black. They are 6 feet long,
about 40 inches wide, and 2 inches thick. They are oak. They weigh
about 250 pounds.

My impressions for your comment:

The tables were painted black so the doctor or pharmacist could count
out pills and more easily see powders, etc.

The second table was an examination table, more likely for the dead,
because it's so hard and uncomfortable, which leads me to believe this
may be a pathologist's set.

The set was made as laboratory furniture in Waukeegan, Wi., about 100
years ago.

I am thinking of using the set as office furniture. I have some
questions:

Is this unique, rare, coveted stuff?

Does anyone know anything about this type of furniture, and whether I
would be untrue to the original if I had the black table tops stripped,
rather than repainted? If I applyed a stain to darken the thing?

I cannot do the work myself. Is it worth it to spend the estimated
$1,000 on refinishing the set?

Does it make sense that the thing is laquered? Would not the laquer
react poorly with the solvents (alcohol, etc.) that the old pharmacist
or pathologist used?
