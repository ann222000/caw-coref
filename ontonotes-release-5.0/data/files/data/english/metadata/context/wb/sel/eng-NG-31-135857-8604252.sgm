Hi all

I have been doing some thinking about the future of Spatialware for
SQL server 2008, now that Microsoft are moving into the spatial
database realm.  I use PB MapInfo Pro as the client and store all my
geometries in SQL server running Spatialware and for the most part,
this is quite adequate.  What I would really like is a truely client
independent implementation, using the native database geometry on the
backend, allowing me to use what ever client GIS on the front end.

At the moment, I can do this to a certain extent using Spatialware,
and transforming the geometry in WKT/WKB which many other client
applications can read.  Now as we move to SQL server 2008, will PB
MapInfo Pro support the native Microsoft geometries?  If they do, why
would they continue to support Spatialware for SQLserver, as I would
imagine that everything that is in Spatialware would be rolled into
SQLserver 2008.  So I suppose this leads me on to thinking why would
PB MapInfo support the new Microsoft geometries if it means that
Spatialware becomes effectively useless?  All this leads to me
thinking that PB MapInfo will not support the Microsoft geometries.
Anyone else got ideas on this?  Perhaps they could see more markets
opening up by supporting the Microsoft geometries, so they may well
support it?  I put the question of whether Spatialware was going to be
supported on SQL Server 2008 to a sales rep here in Australia and they
came back that it was.  Is it going to run side by side with SQL
server 2008?  Are the two types of geometry going to be able to
convert to each other?

Personally, I would like to see PB MapInfo continueing to go down the
same path as they have with Oracle, by supporting the native geometry
type that the database contains.  I can't afford to go down the Oracle
path, but I would love to see PB MapInfo Pro support the new Microsoft
SQL server 2008 geometries, along with PostgreSQL geometry.  A big
advantage of supporting PostgreSQL is that there aren't many GIS
clients that have good read / write / edit capabilities of the native
geometry.  I suppose my next (perhaps retorical) question is how long
before we can expect these things?  Are they even on the drawing
board?

I know many of these questions can't be answered, but opinions are
welcome.  I just thought I would throw it out there.

Hi James,

I have had similar thoughts.  And I have published some of these on my
blog site ( http://iantidy.blogspot.com or http://iantidy.ath.cx ).  I
have asked questions directly of PB MapInfo, and parts of their
responses are published here.

There will be some advantages to using SpatialWare for the short term
once SQL Server 2008 is released.  The main advantage will be the number
of functions (SpatialWare has 140+, SQL Server 2008 around 70) and that
SpatialWare supports a Z value and can do 2.5D calculations, where
Microsoft are currently only releasing 2D support.

SpatialWare for SQL Server needs to under go some work before it will be
compatible with SQL Server 2008.  This is because in SQL Server 2005,
Microsoft announced that they would end support for the IMAGE data type,
and encouraged people to convert to a varbinary(max) data type.  Now I
have asked PB MapInfo if SpatialWare will work with the varbinary(max)
data type, and the have told me &quot;NO&quot;.

My personal opinion is that PB MapInfo SpatialWare should be an
extension of the spatial support in SQL Server 2008, to give MapInfo
users the best of both worlds.

Cheers Ian

Another question is whether SQl Server 2008 Express will include the

another alternative.

Fuel for thought.

Robert,

Support for the new formats is also available in Safe FME 2008 beta, which is currently available.

The performance figures I have heard about for SQL Server 2008 are very good, I don't know what kind of hardware there where achieved on, but the are looking at a million geometries in under 20 seconds (retrieving and rendering).

James,

I too am very interested in what the future holds for spatialware and am in
total agreement that a native backend database would open many things up.
If PBMI cleans up the GUI on Pro and keeps it as clean and simple as it
appears to be now you just might see users of other GIS software move to MI
Pro if the backend data can be accessed.  Then it would finally come to what
tools and GUI users like to use and remove the proprietary junk from the
middle.

I would be keen to see if some type of MI Pro beta is available for us
Spatialware folks to test on SQL 2008.  Even some type of beta for the
spatial sql extenstions that are already out there.

Think of the other camp (so to speak) of what ramifications sql 2008 will
have with SDE !!

http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=MsSqlSpatial

I really wonder what type of licensing MS will use with sql2008...  Are
spatial extensions going to be in all levels?

That means that I could get my data down in a bit over 6 minutes.  I think
that is robably comparable to spatialware.  The real slow part in
spatialware, as you know, is inserting a million geometries to a table with
indexes intact....  That may need a calendar to measure.

Subject: [MI-L] The future of Spatialware on SQLserver 2008

Hi all

I have been doing some thinking about the future of Spatialware for
SQL server 2008, now that Microsoft are moving into the spatial
database realm.  I use PB MapInfo Pro as the client and store all my
geometries in SQL server running Spatialware and for the most part,
this is quite adequate.  What I would really like is a truely client
independent implementation, using the native database geometry on the
backend, allowing me to use what ever client GIS on the front end.

At the moment, I can do this to a certain extent using Spatialware,
and transforming the geometry in WKT/WKB which many other client
applications can read.  Now as we move to SQL server 2008, will PB
MapInfo Pro support the native Microsoft geometries?  If they do, why
would they continue to support Spatialware for SQLserver, as I would
imagine that everything that is in Spatialware would be rolled into
SQLserver 2008.  So I suppose this leads me on to thinking why would
PB MapInfo support the new Microsoft geometries if it means that
Spatialware becomes effectively useless?  All this leads to me
thinking that PB MapInfo will not support the Microsoft geometries.
Anyone else got ideas on this?  Perhaps they could see more markets
opening up by supporting the Microsoft geometries, so they may well
support it?  I put the question of whether Spatialware was going to be
supported on SQL Server 2008 to a sales rep here in Australia and they
came back that it was.  Is it going to run side by side with SQL
server 2008?  Are the two types of geometry going to be able to
convert to each other?

Personally, I would like to see PB MapInfo continueing to go down the
same path as they have with Oracle, by supporting the native geometry
type that the database contains.  I can't afford to go down the Oracle
path, but I would love to see PB MapInfo Pro support the new Microsoft
SQL server 2008 geometries, along with PostgreSQL geometry.  A big
advantage of supporting PostgreSQL is that there aren't many GIS
clients that have good read / write / edit capabilities of the native
geometry.  I suppose my next (perhaps retorical) question is how long
before we can expect these things?  Are they even on the drawing
board?

I know many of these questions can't be answered, but opinions are

On my server downloading 1 million geometries takes longer than 20 seconds.

I am more interested in the querying performance.  The comments I have had back from MapInfo, is that the performance should be the same if not better than what SpatialWare currently is. Hopefully, they mean the speed of the SP_SPATIAL_QUERY stored procedure, because most of the UDFs are painfully slow.

I have found that the quickest way to upload data into SpatialWare (SQL Server), is create well known text (WKT), import using the native Microsoft import features in SQL Server, and build the geometries from the WKT.  This has reduced some of my data imports from 72 hours to around 3 hours (6 if I build all the indexes).

Cheers Ian

That means that I could get my data down in a bit over 6 minutes.  I think
that is robably comparable to spatialware.  The real slow part in
spatialware, as you know, is inserting a million geometries to a table with

Robert,

Support for the new formats is also available in Safe FME 2008 beta, which
is currently available.

The performance figures I have heard about for SQL Server 2008 are very
good, I don't know what kind of hardware there where achieved on, but the
are looking at a million geometries in under 20 seconds (retrieving and
rendering).

James,
Good questions, that deserve some discussion.  Our stuff is currently
largely based on SQL Server/ Spatialware rather than Oracle as my clients
are Microsoft based.  Our largest client is currently asking exactly that
question of Microsoft and MapInfo to determine their strategic direction.
So for me this is quite relevant as it will influence some major decisions
on our product line, possibly even if MapInfo will still be the core of it.

Surely MapInfo would not support a different spatial structure than the
native SQL Server architecture in the future.  However, we don't know how
much spatial functionality will be provided in the backend of SQL Server,
and even if it is planned, it may not work reliably until SP 2 is released
in 2010......  So perhaps there is still a place for Spatialware to do those
back-end spatial queries for a while.

While Spatialware is an add-on, I don't think its performance can be tuned
to the same degree as with Oracle.  Try adding 0000's or records to a
Spatialware table with the indexes intact as see how slow it is compared to
Oracle.  Hopefully if the geometries and functionality were part of SQL,
this would be integrated and we'd get a similar performance boost.

Using the SQL Server native geometries would mean that any number of clients
could work with data stored in the DB, including non-mapinfo based clients.

Interesting strategic choice that each vendor will face.  Support the format
and open up the option for using different products for different uses,
Mapinfo for analysis, Manifold for raster, MapServer for web display, Arc
for digitising ( ;) ).  Don't support it and force your clients to use your
products for everything, or have them translate between each format, or do
they just jump ship?

ESRI are claiming to be a development partner with Microsoft, and manifold
already support it.  Someone will develop an interface for MapServer for
sure.  This was discussed previously and there has been some indication that
MapInfo will support it also, but we don't know any details.  Manifold are
claiming to already support it.  AutoCad's MapGuide does also.

Another question is whether SQl Server 2008 Express will include the

Ian,
Thanks.

I think I do something similar,

I generate a vertex list in the form of an object definition using the code
below that creates a text definition of the object in Spatialware format
(note I am only creating points or simple lines), and inserts this into a
varchar(5000) field called c_vertext_list

If bCreatePoint Then
rtn = &quot;ST_Spatial(ST_Point(&quot; + str$(OrigCoords(1).x) + &quot;,&quot; +
str$(OrigCoords(1).y) + &quot;))&quot;
sObjectType = &quot;POINT&quot;
Else
rtn = &quot;ST_Spatial(ST_Polyline(LIST{&quot;
For i = 1 To UBound(NewCoords)
rtn = rtn + &quot;ST_Point(&quot; + str$(NewCoords(i).x) + &quot;,&quot; +
str$(NewCoords(i).y) + &quot;), &quot;
Next
rtn = Left$(rtn, Len(rtn) - 2) + &quot;}))&quot;
sObjectType = &quot;POLYLINE&quot;
End If

Then I run a stored proc that is basically:

Update TMP_GPS_TRACKS Set sw_geometry = C_VERTEX_LIST

I then insert this into the target table in one sql statement.

Interesting technical discussion...

I do it in the same manner, more or less:

- Inserting the values and geometry as WKT/STSpatial into a temp table
- insert the values from the temp table into the base table using this:

Insert into dbo.tbDAVVejmidter
(GEO_LOCATION,OPRET_DATO,OPRET_AF)
exec sp_spatial_query
'select GEO_LOCATION,OPRET_DATO,OPRET_AF From dbo.tbDAVVejmidterTEMP'

I must admit that I can't remember the figures, but this is much faster than inserting into the base table, even thought the indexes have been dropped.

I think I do something similar,

I generate a vertex list in the form of an object definition using the code below that creates a text definition of the object in Spatialware format (note I am only creating points or simple lines), and inserts this into a
varchar(5000) field called c_vertext_list

If bCreatePoint Then
rtn = &quot;ST_Spatial(ST_Point(&quot; + str$(OrigCoords(1).x) + &quot;,&quot; +
str$(OrigCoords(1).y) + &quot;))&quot;
sObjectType = &quot;POINT&quot;
Else
rtn = &quot;ST_Spatial(ST_Polyline(LIST{&quot;
For i = 1 To UBound(NewCoords)
rtn = rtn + &quot;ST_Point(&quot; + str$(NewCoords(i).x) + &quot;,&quot; +
str$(NewCoords(i).y) + &quot;), &quot;
Next
rtn = Left$(rtn, Len(rtn) - 2) + &quot;}))&quot;
sObjectType = &quot;POLYLINE&quot;
End If

Then I run a stored proc that is basically:

Update TMP_GPS_TRACKS Set sw_geometry = C_VERTEX_LIST

I then insert this into the target table in one sql statement.

On my server downloading 1 million geometries takes longer than 20 seconds.

I am more interested in the querying performance.  The comments I have had back from MapInfo, is that the performance should be the same if not better than what SpatialWare currently is. Hopefully, they mean the speed of the SP_SPATIAL_QUERY stored procedure, because most of the UDFs are painfully slow.

I have found that the quickest way to upload data into SpatialWare (SQL Server), is create well known text (WKT), import using the native Microsoft import features in SQL Server, and build the geometries from the WKT.  This has reduced some of my data imports from 72 hours to around 3 hours (6 if I build all the indexes).

Cheers Ian

That means that I could get my data down in a bit over 6 minutes.  I think that is robably comparable to spatialware.  The real slow part in spatialware, as you know, is inserting a million geometries to a table with indexes intact....  That may need a calendar to measure.

Robert,

Support for the new formats is also available in Safe FME 2008 beta, which is currently available.

The performance figures I have heard about for SQL Server 2008 are very good, I don't know what kind of hardware there where achieved on, but the are looking at a million geometries in under 20 seconds (retrieving and rendering).

Cheers Ian

James,
Good questions, that deserve some discussion.  Our stuff is currently largely based on SQL Server/ Spatialware rather than Oracle as my clients are Microsoft based.  Our largest client is currently asking exactly that question of Microsoft and MapInfo to determine their strategic direction.
So for me this is quite relevant as it will influence some major decisions on our product line, possibly even if MapInfo will still be the core of it.

Surely MapInfo would not support a different spatial structure than the native SQL Server architecture in the future.  However, we don't know how much spatial functionality will be provided in the backend of SQL Server, and even if it is planned, it may not work reliably until SP 2 is released in 2010......  So perhaps there is still a place for Spatialware to do those back-end spatial queries for a while.

While Spatialware is an add-on, I don't think its performance can be tuned to the same degree as with Oracle.  Try adding 0000's or records to a Spatialware table with the indexes intact as see how slow it is compared to Oracle.  Hopefully if the geometries and functionality were part of SQL, this would be integrated and we'd get a similar performance boost.

Using the SQL Server native geometries would mean that any number of clients could work with data stored in the DB, including non-mapinfo based clients.

Interesting strategic choice that each vendor will face.  Support the format and open up the option for using different products for different uses, Mapinfo for analysis, Manifold for raster, MapServer for web display, Arc for digitising ( ;) ).  Don't support it and force your clients to use your products for everything, or have them translate between each format, or do they just jump ship?

ESRI are claiming to be a development partner with Microsoft, and manifold already support it.  Someone will develop an interface for MapServer for sure.  This was discussed previously and there has been some indication that MapInfo will support it also, but we don't know any details.  Manifold are claiming to already support it.  AutoCad's MapGuide does also.

Another question is whether SQl Server 2008 Express will include the capabilities to store the spatial data.  This low end competitor allows a single solution to be used for clients that do not require SQL Server backends without supporting 2 platforms.  Support for PostGis would be another alternative.

Fuel for thought.

Subject: [MI-L] The future of Spatialware on SQLserver 2008

Hi all

I have been doing some thinking about the future of Spatialware for SQL server 2008, now that Microsoft are moving into the spatial database realm.  I use PB MapInfo Pro as the client and store all my geometries in SQL server running Spatialware and for the most part, this is quite adequate.  What I would really like is a truely client independent implementation, using the native database geometry on the backend, allowing me to use what ever client GIS on the front end.

At the moment, I can do this to a certain extent using Spatialware, and transforming the geometry in WKT/WKB which many other client applications can read.  Now as we move to SQL server 2008, will PB MapInfo Pro support the native Microsoft geometries?  If they do, why would they continue to support Spatialware for SQLserver, as I would imagine that everything that is in Spatialware would be rolled into SQLserver 2008.  So I suppose this leads me on to thinking why would PB MapInfo support the new Microsoft geometries if it means that Spatialware becomes effectively useless?  All this leads to me thinking that PB MapInfo will not support the Microsoft geometries.
Anyone else got ideas on this?  Perhaps they could see more markets opening up by supporting the Microsoft geometries, so they may well support it?  I put the question of whether Spatialware was going to be supported on SQL Server 2008 to a sales rep here in Australia and they came back that it was.  Is it going to run side by side with SQL server 2008?  Are the two types of geometry going to be able to convert to each other?

Personally, I would like to see PB MapInfo continueing to go down the same path as they
