We got POWAH!! We got Internet!!

From this point forward we should be able to make rapid progress in
establishing a viable home and business environment in Floyd, VA.

These drab enclosures mark a major transition in our lives. The
pad-mounted transformer on the left supplies us with 400 amps of 120/240
volt power for home and workshop. The slim green box houses the
telephone connection that brings us telephone and high-speed Internet
service. Even though our house is out in the country, our utilities come
in through underground cables.

No longer are we refugees stranded in the awful gulf between homes.
Thanks to the hospitality of Doug and Amy Thompson, we have been able to
stay in communication with family and friends, but there is no
substitute for having our own base of operations.

When we arrived at the homesite yesterday, a contractor was already
filling in the trench that brought the power and phone cables to the
nearly completed workshop. An hour later, he had installed the meter and
we were good to go as far as electrical power is concerned. I was
pleased to see that the power cables were 3/4 inch in diameter, as the
run from the transformer is about 200 feet.

The telephone company still needs to do its peculiar magic before we
can log onto the Internet, but that too should be handled in the next
few days.

Unlike some family and friends who are content to live &quot;off the
grid&quot; as a solution to finding a satisfying lifestyle, I feel that
we live in a connected world and a satisfying lifestyle has to involve
involve open communication.

There is incredible power available to those who are in a position to
communicate with those who live and work elsewhere. Communication is the
first step in harnessing the power of relationships and mutual efforts.
Since communication requires power, the appearance of these two green
boxes on our property signals the beginning of a new cycle of
communication and opportunity.

More to come

We are still battling glare ice on our street and on our driveway. I
had scattered dirt on the icy snow so I could walk without falling, but
this did not handle the entire driveway.

The delivery of our new refrigerator and stove was stymied when the
delivery truck could not negotiate the final 200 feet to the house.

The well-drilling contractor is unable to put in the trench which
will bring a water line to the house.

The heating company will not be able to deliver our new wood stove
until there is a safe way to carry the 420 pound stove from thwe truck
to the house.

Hopefully, we will have a solution to this problem today. Our
excavating contractor will spread gravel on the driveway until we have
more stable access to house and workshop. This is our immediate hurdle
to overcome, as we must have water, heat, and an operational kitchen.

When we have these handled, we will tackle floor coverings, unpacking
Smart vaults and furnishing the house.

A question for readers

This series of posts has developed a life of its own and I would like
to continue developing the theme through the establishment of a fully
working house and workshop environment. On the other hand, there are
business, aging, and post-corporate issues that I enjoy writing about
and these get short shrift with the amount of attention I put on the new
house cycle.

I am concerned that so much writing about building a new home will be
a distraction for those who are looking for more philosophical and
analytical articles about life and work.

My question for you is: Should the house articles be spun off into a
related blog, which would have a link from this site, or should I leave
them as part of this increasingly eclectic site?

I know that readers have less and less time to read, so my instinct
is to leave everything in one convenient place and let readers decide
whether today's offering is worth spending time on.

Let me know your thoughts!

Hi David, I like it all on one blog. I can scroll, read, look at
pictures, and even check the categories for the subject threads that
intrest me most. Just my 2 cents.

I have enjoyed the house-building series as we will be facing the
same in a few years or sooner if another Katrina hits New Orleans. The
things we take for granted we learn to appreciate when we lose them. We
have been moving in stages over the last few weeks into an undamaged
house in New Orleans so my hurting body has great sympathy for you and
Gretchen. Please keep posting the progress and take lots of notes
because one day we will be asking you for them when we move there and
are neighbors.

I like your posting about what you are doing and what all is
necessary to do the things you do - call it a check and balance thing to
avoid dreaming about "oh, why again did I not move out to a nice house,
out there on the country?" *g*

I know I don't represent the majority, being an independently
successful internet development entrepreneur whose major interests
beyond family include a new horse farm and various farm and home
improvement projects :) But my vote is for writing related to
establishing a home and home business related endeavours. Perhaps you
can intertwine business and home interests in an interesting way. So
many people I know in this area have home offices. In Blacksburg,
neighbors to either side of me also were based out of a home office. I
am a frequent watcher of home shopping and improvement related shows on
HGTV and find that nearly every family requires a home office. So there
is certainly interest in that vein of thought and self improvement.

I think you should leave them in the same blog. They do and don't
seem to fit with what you've described on your "What kind of blog is
this?" page. But I really enjoy reading about your adventure.

Heck, leave it all together as far as I'm concerned. It's your
publication, though, so if it's a distraction for you then go ahead and
change it.

My feeling is that it is all part of one package. You are having this
particular post-corporate adventure because you have made the other
decisions that you have made about your life and your career. You
wouldn't be moving to Floyd if you were still working a corporate job.
I'm interested in reading it all, so you won't lose me as a reader in
either case.

Would definitely spin off. I've enjoyed ready about your housing
adventures, but that is not what draws me to your writings. As a
relatively new consultant, I am negotiating my way through the
post-corporate life. I'm finding the life of a soloist to be re-creative
and value the views and experiences of others who find or who have
chosen this more solitary place as the place to be.

I'd say just mix them into the whole, and let people filter by
category if they only want to see house entries, or whatever their
interest may be. I enjoy your writing on all this, and can relate to the
ice - I lived near there for 6 years, and during one storm we had
between 4 and 6 inches of pure ice on the ground. That took about a week
to melt enough to be remotely normal. Cheers, -met.

Delurking to say leave it as one--I enjoy all of your writings and
it's much easier to keep up with just one blog. Plus I think it's
interesting to see different sides of people!

Thanks to all who took the time to comment. I will leave the blog
format alone, but I will intersperse other topics more frequently to
keep the mix interesting to those who are looking for professional
topics as well as post-corporate life topics. Stay tuned for posts on
Life in Floyd. :) Merry Christmas!
