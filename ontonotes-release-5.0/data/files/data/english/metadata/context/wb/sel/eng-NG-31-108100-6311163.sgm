I had been thinking about buying a motorhome, but the gas prices in
Oregon have been shooting up and are close to $3.00 per gallon.  Has the
gas price raising put a damper on your motorhome travel/purchase, or is
it just me, thinking about maybe I should not buy one now.

We have, jokingly, discussed taking out a second mortgage to travel this
summer, but it hasn't changed our plans.

If you want an RV and can afford the gas, buy one. If you can't afford
the gas to travel, then don't buy one.

If you can't afford the gas, then you definately can afford the motorhome!
We bought out first RV 3 years ago, and gas is the cheapest part of owning
the darn thing. CG fees, buying touristy stuff everywhere you go, food,
dishes, cleaning stuff, etc. is what gets you. Heck, we've probably spent
more on bedding (ours and guests) for the blasted thing than on gas.

If you take a 1000 mile trip and get 10mpg, you'll burn about 100
gallons of gas.  $200 if gas is $2.00 a gallon or $300 if it is $3.00.
Is there any other thing that costs $100 or less that you would allow
to spoil a fun and relaxing trip?  That's probably the least of your
trip expenses.  Heck, you'd blow more than that on Disney tickets.

Perhaps if you leave your TV at home and get used to not having one
while you're on your first trip, you'll toss it out when you get home
and slowly your logical thinking will clear up.  Only media-numbed
robots pay more than a passing mind to the price of fuel for
recreation.  Where was the hue and cry as the price of dairy products
more than doubled in the last few years?  No media attention, that's
where.

I don't like to watch $100 click over on the pump any more than anyone
else so you know what?  I don't watch.  I stick my debit card in the
slot then turn my back on the pump and intentionally don't look at the
register.  I keep the receipt just long enough to make sure some
towel-head doesn't yell "drive off".  Then I enjoy my trips.

If you can afford the RV (IMO, if you have to finance it then you
can't afford it) then now is an EXCELLENT time to buy one.  Many of
the other mind-numbed robots, thinking like you were when you asked
the question, will be dumping their RVs and taking baths.  A panic is
an excellent time to acquire something you want if you have the cash
laying around.

Another excellent reason to buy now is that with all the panic in the
air, the RV-oriented amenities will be much less crowded.  You might
find that you have a whole row in the CG to yourself.  That's nice!

On my research travel through Utah, Idaho, Montana, Washington, Oregon, and
California late last month through early this month, I interviewed many of
the campground owners about this and other things. They say that people are
staying more nights at their campgrounds now, typically twice as many
nights.

Longer stays would save gas. And if you are making longer stays, maybe a
bigger motorhome could make more sense--since you're not moving it as often
or as far and will be spending more time in it.

Oh, I thought you were going to say, "...more than that on speeding
tickets." Well if gas costs more, certain newly unfuelish ones could get
fewer of those to make up the difference in gas prices.

Still, its aggravating considering they are paying only 1/20th of the cost
for gas in Veneszuala. That's why the oil companies are calling President
Hugo Chavez a terrorist. He terrorfies them in their hopes to gouge the
world with high prices.

1/20th of the cost is what we should be paying here. Honestly.

We're retired and budgeted so much for food so much for park fees, so much
for each of a bunch of things.  We're able to move the numbers around within
the budget.  If that were not practical we could simply stay put a bit
longer and spend the same money for fewer miles traveled.

As long as I'm enjoying myself I can have fun right here as well as more
miles down the road.

My wife says I wake up in a different world every morning regardless of if
we move the bus or not.

Long time back we had a sail boat.  The wind was free but the sails cost
like fury but that did not stop us from enjoying the trips.

When you look at all the costs involved in buying, owning, and using an
RV, fuel costs are usually way down the list. depending upon how many
miles you travel.  If you're travelling 300 miles a day or more, then fuel prices
become more of a concern, otherwise RV travel is primarily a lifestyle question.

300 miles a day, day after day is only for when I *have* to be somewhere.

I don't like the numbers on service station signs either.  But the fact
remains that the inflation-adjusted price of gas today is pretty close to
what it was in the 70's.  In those days you could buy a new, full-sized
Chevy Impala for around $4,400 - and it was a big, luxurious car in its
time.

We RV'd, on a smaller scale, then.  We will continue to RV.  However, we do
pull a 5th wheel with a diesel which makes our non-pulling economy quite a
bit better.

I have seen some folks become so obsessed with the price of gas that they do
incredibly dumb things.  Among these:

- Haul 30 to 40 gallons of gas, in the trunk of their car, so they can save
.02 at a cross town filling station.

- Sell paid for automobiles and start payments on new cars that get
marginally better mileage

-  Sell their RV and then realize they made a mistake and buy higher cost
vehicles to restart their passion.

All I'm saying is get things in focus and do some real cost analysis before
you make a decision.

Where are you paying this at? Here fuel tax is around 50 cents a

Correct.  In fact, here's a place where one can play around with
inflation-adjusted prices

http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl

1975 was the earliest time I kept expense logs, when I started driving
long distance to work and back.  If I input 1975 and 50 cents (what I
was paying for a gallon of gas at the end of the year.), that comes
back as the present day price of $1.89.  Figure in the increase in
fuel tax which this calculation doesn't account for and the result is,
we're paying for gas today right at or maybe a little less than we
were in 1975.

What's really interesting is to go back to say, 1931 and input the
price of gas then, 19 cents ( http://www.tvhistory.tv/1946%20QF.htm ).
In today's dollars, $2.54!!  Youch!  Shows just how ignorant those old
pharts are when they so fondly reminisce about "cheap gas" "back
then".

Another revealing thing is how the price of milk changed.  Forty Nine
cents a gallon in 1931.  That's $6.56 a gallon in today's dollars!
Think about that the next time you feel the need to whine about
corporate agriculture.

This also starkly highlights the cost of regulations, especially
excessive environmental ones.  Relative to petroleum, dairy farming
has remained effectively unregulated.  Milk prices reflect the
unfettered economies of scale.  That gas has only managed to keep up
with the rate of inflation, IMO, reflects the "hidden" costs of
regulation.

And before someone jumps in to note that milk has had price supports
and price fixing, that is true but so has petroleum over the years.
Irrelevant to this comparison since both nowadays are on the free
market, as much as it can be free in this country.

When diesel prices went way up in the summer of 2005, I slowed down.
Driving at 55 mph, we have been averaging close to 9 mpg. Before that,
we averaged 7.5 mpg. That 20% increase in fuel economy has gone a long
way toward making up for the 20-50% increase we have seen in the price
of fuel. It's also a more relaxing drive.

We eke out another few percent savings buy using a credit card that
rebates cash and buying all our fuel at Flying J, where the RV Card gets
you the cash price and an additional penny per gallon off when using a
credit card. Finally, I use the Flying J web site to choose where we
fuel up. We last filled up on Oklahoma City, and we won't fill up again
until Mathews, MO. Prices in those cities are up to $.30/gal less than
some alternative stops.

Hope that helps.
