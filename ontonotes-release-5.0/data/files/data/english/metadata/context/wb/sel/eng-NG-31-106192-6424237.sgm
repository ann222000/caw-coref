Tantra is the original spiritual science first taught in India more than
7000 years ago. TAN is a Sanskrit root which signifies, "expansion", and TRA
signifies "liberation."  Thus, Tantra is the practice which  elevates human
beings in a process in which their minds are expanded. It leads human beings
from the imperfect to the perfect, from the crude to the subtle, from
bondage to liberation.

The development of Tantra is intertwined with the development of
civilization in ancient India.  During the time when Tantra emerged as an
important spiritual practice, India was passing through a crucial historical
period. In the Northwest nomadic tribes from central Asia, the Aryans, began
to enter the country which they named Bharata Varsha (the land which
nourishes and expands human beings). Although the Aryans were a nomadic
warrior culture, amidst them there were certain sages known as Rishis who
began to ask the basic questions about the origin and destiny of the
universe.

These sages presented oral teachings, which were later compiled in books
known as The Vedas. In these teachings they put forward the idea of a
Supreme Consciousness, advancing beyond the previous concepts of a world in
which many deities were thought to animate the forces of nature. They also
developed a system of prayer and worship in order to enter into a
relationship with this Supreme Consciousness, but their practices were
mostly of an external, ritualistic nature.

In India the Aryans encountered and began to fight with the indigenous
peoples - the Austrics, Mongolians, and Dravidians. They considered these
races to be inferior to them, and in the epic tales of India such as The
Ramayana, these races are depicted as monkeys and demons.

However inferior these races were considered to be, the Aryans were very
much interested in the spiritual practices which the indigenous peoples of
India were practicing. The spiritual approach of the non-Aryans was Tantra
and it differed from the Vedic practices of the Aryans because it was
fundamentally an introversive process rather than an external ritual. Many
Aryans began to learn the Tantric system of spiritual development, and later
Vedic books were influenced by Tantra.

During this epoch of warfare between the Aryans and non-Aryans, a great
personality was born. His name was Sadashiva  which means "he who is always
absorbed in consciousness and one whose only vow of existence is to promote
the all-around welfare of living beings". Sadashiva, also known as Shiva,
was a great spiritual preceptor or Guru. Although Tantra was practiced
before his birth, it was he who for the first time gave humanity a
systematic presentation of spirituality.

Not only was he a great spiritual teacher, but he was also the founder of
the Indian system of music and dance, which is why he is sometimes known as
Nataraj (the Lord of the Dance). Shiva was also the founder of Indian
medicine, and presented a system known as Vaedyak Shastra. In the social
sphere too Shiva had an important role to play. He introduced a system of
marriage in which both partners accepted a mutual responsibility for the
success of the marriage, irregardless of caste or community. Shiva himself
was of mixed parentage, and by marrying an Aryan princess he helped to unite
the warring factions of India and gave them a more universalistic social
viewpoint. Because of these social innovations Shiva has been called  the
Father of human civilization.

Shiva's greatest contribution to the birth of civilization was to introduce
the concept of dharma. Dharma is a Sanskrit word which signifies the "innate
characteristic" of something. What is the innate characteristic and
specialty of humans? Shiva explained that a human being wants more than the
pleasure provided by sensory gratification. He said that the human being is
different from plants and animals because what he or she is striving for is
absolute peace. This is the goal of human life, and Shiva's spiritual
teachings were aimed at enabling any human being to attain this goal.

Like most ancient teachings, Shiva's ideas were first taught in an oral
form, and only later were they transcribed into books.  Shiva's wife,
Parvati, used to  ask him various questions regarding the spiritual science.
Shiva replied to these questions, and the compilation of these questions and
answers are known as the Tantra Shastra (Tantric scriptures). There are two
types of Tantric scriptures. The principles of Tantra are found in books
known as Nigama while the practices of Tantra are contained in books known
as Agama.

Some of these ancient books have been lost and others are indecipherable due
to their having been written in a code language designed to keep the secrets
of Tantra away from the uninitiated; thus the ideas of Tantra have never
been clearly explained.

In his commentaries on the Tantra Shastra and in his  book about the life
and teachings of Shiva,  Shrii Shrii Anandamurti  has presented some of the
basic ideas found in the ancient teachings. One of the most important
elements in Tantra is the relationship of Guru and disciple. Guru means "one
who can dispel darkness" and Shiva explained that for spiritual success
there must be a good teacher and a good disciple.

Shiva explained that there are three major categories of Guru. The first
type is a teacher who gives a little bit of knowledge but does not follow up
the lessons. That is, he or she may leave and the disciple is then left
alone without guidance. The second or middle level is one who teaches and
then guides the disciple for a little while but not for the complete period
needed by the disciple to reach the final goal. The best type of teacher
according to Tantra is one who gives a teaching and then makes continued
efforts to see that the disciple follows the instructions and finally
realizes the ultimate state of human perfection.

The qualities of this highest guru are further enumerated in the Tantra
Shastra. The guru is one who is tranquil, can control his mind, is humble
and modestly dressed. He earns his living in a proper way and is a family
man. He is well versed in metaphysical philosophy and established in the art
of meditation. He is one who knows the theory and practice of imparting the
teaching of meditation. He loves and guides his disciples. Such a guru is
called Mahakaola

But even if there is a great teacher, there must also be someone who can
absorb his lessons. The Tantra Shastras describe three different categories
of disciples. The first type is compared to a glass which is placed in the
water with the mouth facing downward. While it is in the water it appears to
be full but if it is lifted out of the water it becomes empty. This is like
a student who practices well in the presence of the teacher, but after the
teacher leaves, the student discontinues the practice and cannot apply the
teachings to his or her every day life. The second type of disciple is like
a glass placed in the water at an angle. It also appears to be full when it
is immersed, but when it is raised out of the water it loses most of the
water. This disciple is one who practices in the presence of the teacher but
after a while he or she practices less and less and finally discontinues the
spiritual way of life. The third kind of disciple is the best of all and is
symbolized by a glass  which is immersed in the water in an upright
position. While in the water it is completely full and when it is taken out
of the water it remains full. This kind of student practices in the presence
of the master and continues the practice even if he or she is physically
separated from the teacher.

The relationship of guru and disciple is very important and is a key feature
of Tantra. The path of spirituality has been described as being as thin as a
razor's edge. At any moment it is possible to deviate from the path and then
it is very difficult to reach liberation. The guru is always there to love
and guide the disciple at all stages of the practice.

Shiva was a Mahakaola, but after his death there was a lack of teachers of
the same stature and Tantra fell into decline. Some of the teachings were
lost and others were deformed. Today Tantra is shrouded in mystery and there
are many misconceptions about it. To understand the source of these
misconceptions it is important to examine the 5 M's. These are  spiritual
practices beginning with the letter M. When Shiva first taught he gave
teaching according to the development of the student. He saw that certain
people were at a level in which they were dominated by animal passions and
others were at a higher stage of development. He gave different practices
depending on the qualities of the disciple.

The first M is known as Madya. It has two meanings. One meaning of madya is
"wine". For those people who were dominated by physical instincts Shiva
instructed them to continue drinking wine, but he showed them how to control
the habit and then finally leave it. For those at a higher level of
development Madya has another meaning, it refers not to wine but to a divine
nectar. Each month the pineal gland secretes a fluid known as amrta. A yogi
who has purified his or her mind and practices fasting can taste the fluid
and experience  the profound effect of the fluid on his or her whole being,
which has been described as a state of bliss. Thus, there is both a crude or
material
interpretation of Madya and a subtle or spiritual understanding of the term.

Another of the five M's is Mamsa. One meaning of Mamsa is meat. For those
who ate much meat, Shiva told them to continue to take it with a spiritual
idea and finally to control the urge and quit the habit. For the subtle
practitioner of Tantra, mamsa refers to the tongue and the spiritual
practice of controlling one's speech.

Matsya, the third of the M's, refers to fish. For the physically minded
practitioner Shiva applied the same instruction regarding fish as he did
with wine and meat. In spiritual or subtle Tantra the "fish" refers to two
subtle nerves which run up the body, starting at the base of the spine and
crisscrossing each other and ending in the two nostrils. These nerves are
known as the ida and pingala. By the science of breath control, Pranayama,
the currents of the nerves are controlled and the mind becomes calm for
meditation. This is the Matsya of the spiritual practitioner.

Another of the M's is Mudra. Mudra has only a spiritual significance and
there is no physical or crude practice associated with it. Mudra means to
maintain contact with those who help us to make spiritual progress and to
avoid the company of those who might harm our development.

The last of the M's, Maethuna, is the one which has caused the most
confusion regarding Tantra. Maethuna means union. In its crude sense it
means sexual union. For those who were dominated by the sexual instinct
Shiva told that the sex act must be done with a spiritual idea and that
gradually this instinct must be controlled.  For the more advanced
practitioners, those who were practicing subtle or spiritual Tantra, Shiva
taught another practice of Maethuna. In this case "union" refers to the
union of individual consciousness with Supreme Consciousness.  In this case
the spiritual energy of the human being, lying dormant at the base of the
spine, is raised until it reaches the highest energy center (near the pineal
gland), causing the spiritual aspirant to experience union with the Supreme.

The Ananda Marga yoga of today is based on the spiritual and subtle
interpretation of the 5 M's.

One of the distinctive aspects of subtle Tantra is the introversive  method
of meditation. The concept of mantra is of key importance in the Tantra idea
of meditation. "Man" means "mind" and "tra" means "that which liberates",
thus mantra is a particular vibration which liberates the mind.

The ancient yogis experimented with sound vibration and began to utilize
special sounds which they found useful in the process of expansion of mind.
They found that there are seven principle psycho-spiritual energy centers in
the human body. They further learned that there are 50 sounds which emanate
from the centers. These sounds are found in the alphabet of Sanskrit, and
certain combinations of the sounds were used in ancient processes of
concentration and meditation. During Tantric meditation the meditator is
concentrating on the mantra and trying to keep only one sound vibration (and
its associated idea) in his or her mind. Constant repetition of the mantra
leads a practitioner to higher states of consciousness.

Not any sound can be chosen at random for use in meditation, rather there
are certain qualities which the mantra must possess in order for it to be
effective. First of all the mantra must be pulsative, that is, there will be
two syllables which are repeated in synchronization with the inhalation and
exhalation of breathing. In addition the mantra must have an idea associated
with it. The general idea of the mantras used in meditation is that "I am
one with the Supreme Consciousness". The mantra thus helps the individual to
associate his or her own individual consciousness with the totality of
consciousness in the universe.

The final characteristics of the mantra is that it must create a certain
vibration which acts as a link between the individual vibration of the
meditator and the vibration of the Supreme Consciousness. As people are not
all alike, the mantras which are used in meditation are also not all alike.
The meditation teacher chooses a mantra which matches the particular
vibration of the individual and can link this individual vibration with the
universal rhythm of the Supreme Consciousness.

Tantra is more than just a collection of meditation or yoga techniques.
There is a particular world-view associated with it. According to Tantra,
struggle is the essence of life. The effort to struggle against all
obstacles and move  from the imperfect to the perfect is the true spirit of
Tantra.

In this movement from imperfection to perfection, there are three basic
stages an individual passes through. In the first stage, the person is
dominated by animal instincts, but in the next stage he or she gains control
over these instincts and reaches the state of true human development.
Finally, by constant struggle and effort, a state is reached where the human
being becomes godlike. Tantra thus has an optimistic worldview. It shows how
each individual is moving in a cosmic circle from a state of less developed
consciousness to the most highly developed status.
