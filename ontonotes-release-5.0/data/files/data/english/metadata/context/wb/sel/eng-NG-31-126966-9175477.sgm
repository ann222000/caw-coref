.he was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. She-it. I hadn't seen
much evidence in years that he even HAD a heart. And how does that
happen with a pacemaker? Battery goes dead? Aren't the docs supposed to
replace that sucker before the battery's life is up?

They said in the AP report that his heart doesn't have a strong beat,
it quivers.  Maybe he has a jellfish in his family tree.  It's not a
pacemaker problem.  IIRC, they said they were going to give him an
electric charge to strengthen the heartbeat.  Maybe they should send
him to a black site where they can attach electrodes to his..., oh,
never mind.
