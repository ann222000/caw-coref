Hi All,

Does anyone know of a program that reindents erb so its actually
readable again. I'm working with a designer who hasn't grasped the
concept of the tab key.

Cheers,
ALan

Hi Alan

If you have a lot of code unindented you can use Vim (I know, that's
probably not what you meant by &quot;program&quot;, but maybe it helps). Here's how
you can indent a whole file with a few comands:

1) Open the file inside Vim
2) While in editing mode, press G, then =, and then Esc.

The whole file should now be properly indented.

I think you need the vim-ruby plugin installed, otherwise Vim might not know
how to indent the erb syntax.

Cheers,
Caio

Hi Alan

I've just tested the command again and it didn't work (don't know why it did
the first time). There's another way to do it:

1) Open the file inside Vim
2) While in editing mode (and on the first line), press Shift ^ V (to get in
visual mode), then Shift ^G (to select all the lines), and then =
