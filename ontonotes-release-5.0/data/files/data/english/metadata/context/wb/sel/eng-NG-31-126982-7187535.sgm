Two Bulls preserved her Lakota culture

It hurts to lose our loved ones, knowing we will never hug them again
or watch them smile or hear them laugh. But we can thank them for the
memories.

Thank you, Nellie Two Bulls.

Grandma Nellie, the 81-year-old cultural matriarch of the Lakota
Nation, died Sunday.

We can thank Nellie for giving us joy. And we can thank the Creator
for blessing her with gifts. He gave her a voice to sing - and a mind
to keep and share the stories of the Lakota people.

Unci, or Grandma Nellie, will never be replaced. She hails from a
generation of elders who were pure in their culture, tradition and
beliefs.

She was born on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and grew
up in the Payabaya Community, a child born from a long line of
traditional medicine men and women.

She grew to represent all that is good with the Lakota people,
exhibiting the virtues of generosity, strength, fortitude and wisdom.

Nellie is a direct descendent of Chief Man Afraid of His Horse. She
was the daughter of George Whitehorse and Susan Blacksheep. In the
Lakota tradition, Nellie was raised by her grandmother Bessie White
Rabbit-White Horse.

Grandma Nellie married Matthew Two Bulls. They lived as man and wife
for more than a half-century. They had seven children - Sylvester,
Zackery, Enoch, Doreen, Melvina, Cheryl and Linda.

In her life, Nellie played many roles, including wife, mother,
sister, grandma and friend. She had 34 grandchildren, 70 great-
grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild. She had more than
100 "hunka" relatives, meaning she had many adopted daughters, sons
and grandchildren.

The Creator blessed me as one of her hunka relatives, making me a
sister adopted by Nellie's daughters, Melvina, Cheryl and Linda.

Nellie also gave me my Lakota name, Tells the People What's Happening.

Nellie was a natural at making people comfortable. People gravitated
to her like a river that leads to the ocean.

In her company, it was easy to feel like you were in the presence of
someone bigger than life. But she never acted like that. She was just
a friend and a grandma who liked to sing and tell stories.

She is best known for her singing. Lynette Two Bulls, who was raised
by her grandma Nellie, said every time she heard Unci sing, it made
her cry. Her grandmother's voice made her feel happiness and sorrow
at the same time.

Nellie was given the name Zintkala To Win, or Blue Bird Woman. It
came to her in a vision in which she received the gifts of songs and
storytelling. She sang for the people, including veterans, children
and a memorial service for Robert Kennedy in Rhode Island. She also
composed and recorded songs.

Nellie shared her songs and stories on the Pine Ridge Reservation and
across Indian Country. She taught Lakota culture at the Red Cloud
Indian School for more than two decades. Many of those students today
call her grandma. She was a member of the Lakota Advisory Committee
for the Journey Museum in Rapid City, S.D., and a board member for
KILI Radio, the tribal radio station.

Nellie also served as a tribal council representative for the
Wakpamni District. She was honored at the Northern Plains Tribal Arts
for her role in passing on traditions and received the South Dakota
Living Indian Treasure Award.

The city of Rapid City honored Nellie and her late husband by
proclaiming "Matthew and Nellie Two

Bulls Day."

And the Black Hills Powwow Association recognized her with a Lifetime
Achievement Award and the Oglala Lakota College bestowed her with an
honorary doctoral degree.

Nellie once said: "My art is my ability to sing and tell stories
about my people, the Oglala Lakota. I have spent the majority of my
life telling stories, and singing the traditional Lakota songs. This
is my contribution to preserving our culture."

Services will be held at 10 a.m. Friday at the Billy Mills Center on
the Pine Ridge Reservation.

Nellie is gone. But she left us to carry forward her memories,
stories and songs.
