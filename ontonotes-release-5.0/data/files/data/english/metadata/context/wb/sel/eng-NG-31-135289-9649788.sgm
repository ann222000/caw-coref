I have recently discovered Second Life.
http://magikomputer.blogspot.com/2007/11/get-second-life.html

My overall impression is that this is quite an awesome technology.
It looks like it is going to become the next big thing in our lives,
superseding the Internet itself as we know it.

I love the concept, but I have to say that I have this uneasy feeling
that somehow there's something evil in this scheme, something that one
day will get out of our hands.
Don't know why. It kind of reminds me of the first Terminator movie.
Because the next logical step would be to physically build many of
those 3-D human models in the real world. Combine that with the latest
advances in artificial intelligence and with the increasing isolation
of human beings in today's societies and you'll soon get androids
living our lives for us.

You don't get it.
What all this means is that in the no so distant future the webmaster
will be required not just to create an e-commerce shop for example,
but to actually build the shop's premises, so customers can walk in,
have a look at the products from every angle, try them on and purchase
them.
And that is already happening NOW.
No HTML, no CSS, no PHP, forget about all that. 3D is what a webmaster
will need from now on.

To a certain extent the concept already works in Second Life. I doubt
it would be difficult to implement a real life payment/delivery
gateway into a store in Second Life. Technology is probably ready, but
I agree that usability could be a problem still.

But, even if technology and usability and even full accessibility
could be tackled, I still think that flat info on screen will remain
the general and most used way of doing business online. (can't
remember ever having heard people wanting to discover the news in 3D
holograms in their newspaper either ;-) )

When Amazon.com or any of those others you mentioned completely

A company has recently started advertising around my area that claims to
be a direct supplier of organic produce that is locally sourced and in
season. They bring you a box full of veg once a week, and you need do
nothing - not even tell them what you want - they'll just bring you
fresh veg that is in season.

I've been thinking of giving them a go. As I am pretty handy in the
kitchen, and like to experiment with food, it seems like an ideal service.

As for books, I usually know what I want before I start looking (title,
author, the lot), but I imagine that most people in your position
wouldn't...

No we're not, SecondLife has been doing it for the last year.
EverCrack, WoW etc. have been doing it even longer, in a more
restricted context. This stuff _works_, and it works right now. If you
want a 3d vshop, you can build it and open one.

The problem is that SecondLife is still fairly clunky for the users,
the corporate shops just weren't exciting enough to sustain the
&quot;community vibe&quot; they sought (boo.com anyone?) and the market voted
with its little avatar feet by just not bothering to use it. The
disposable recreational-shopping dollar seems to prefer throwing
vampires at each other on Facebook, rather than wandering through a
virtual mall.

It's the Microsoft Bob of online commerce. Bob failed because it covered
up the power to do things behind a fancy interface, and any attempt to
do the same for e-commerce will likely go the same way.

If I am buying something online, I want to type in what I am looking for
and find it, then maybe take a look at a 3D model in a Flash viewer of
some sort (but that isn't necessary either, merely nice).

I don't want to have to walk round a virtual shopping centre/mall. If I
wanted to do that, I would go to the city centre and walk around *real*
shops with *real* staff that I can talk to.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What all this means is that in the no so distant future the webmaster
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will be required not just to create an e-commerce shop for example,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but to actually build the shop's premises, so customers can walk in,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have a look at the products from every angle, try them on and purchase
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And that is already happening NOW.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No HTML, no CSS, no PHP, forget about all that. 3D is what a webmaster
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will need from now on.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're insane.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're an ignorant fool.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usability one.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We are (NOT you that's for sure) already supporting that interactive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experience.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Companies like Toyota, Dell, Sears, and Adidas have already

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Get used to it, because this is the way we'll be conducting business
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very soon.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just because you don't know about it doesn't mean you have to dismiss
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it, you fool.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When Amazon.com or any of those others you mentioned completely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; switches to a 3D interface (not a pretend one on Second Life, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their own actual website), you can call me a fool.  Until then, you're
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing more than a troll.  Every thread you start is little more than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an attempt to goad people into fighting with you.  You're so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; transparent that it isn't even a good trolling.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Your problem, fool, is that you think for some weird reason, that you
&gt;&gt;&gt; can insult people as a way of greeting and get away with it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; And when they reply to you in the same manner, you come back winging.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pathetic fool you are.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually &quot;Second Life&quot; would be beneficial to morons like you, that is
&gt;&gt;&gt; if you were not so stupid as to dismiss it before hand.

&gt;&gt; Is that the best you can do?  Seriously, if that's all you have in

&gt; Yeah I could not agree more.

Exactly.  I think a 3D view of a particular product is immensely
useful.  However, an entire shopping environment is another story
altogether.  Like I said, the usability problems in providing such an
experience are immense.  Your Microsoft Bob analogy is spot-on, IMO.

Bob never failed! I'm still using it today!

Bob was a vast success. 5 minutes of joke coding, which we're _still_
talking about today. It was never intended to be a serious
_replacement_ for anything, but as a joke proof-of-concept demo, it
was excellent. It got us all thinking about alternative and agent-rich
UIs like this.

Yes, that's called &quot;shopping&quot;. It's a proces with a defined goal,
where efficiency is important. You probably do all of that that you
need to do, and little is going to make you do more of it. It's a
saturated market.

Now what do you (or your teenage offspring) do instead? What do you
spend hours a day doing? What section of your &quot;online time&quot;, or your
disposable income, is still up for grabs?  How does corporate commerce
help itself to a fatter share of your cash? Focussed shopping is
already saturated, so how can they turn your &quot;leisure&quot; into
&quot;spending&quot;?  You won't pay more than a pittance to consume media, you
already think everything on-line ought to be free, so they need to
turn something you will still spend money on. Just about the only
market left is buying tangible products with a brand-value inflated
above their production costs - recreational shopping.

The intention of boo.com was to be the first Second Life (and no-one
realised). Yes, I _was_ wrong. Ernst, you were right. The High Boos
were right all along, just premature by about 10 years rather than the
2 years we thought at the time. The Boo business model _did_ fly, it's
just that it needed Facebook to acheive it, not just a web shop, not
even just a 2D web shop with avatars.

Boo's business model was to make shopping a &quot;fun&quot; experience based
around &quot;community&quot;. An on-line setup where people would cheerfully let
it suck their lives dry of every spare hour, because they _wanted_ to.
And while they were there, they'd spend money on stuff they didn't
need, for more than they needed to, because they regarded it as
&quot;fun&quot;.  No-one intended it to be cheap, or efficient for the sort of
focussed shopping you mentioned before. That's not what it's there
for.

This is how Facebook already works, except there's no way to buy
stuff. All you can do on Facebook is throw vampires at people you
vaguely remember from school. Yet people still spend their whole lives
on there! It's worthless crap, yet they still flock to it in droves.

Now take Facebook's vacuous yet powerful lock-in, and add retail
consumption to it. You've got the cattle, now find a way to round 'em
up and milk 'em.

This is the idea behind shopping in Second Life. It's not &quot;shopping
with a clunky interface&quot;, it's sucking you into online captivity, then
picking your pockets in exchange for consumer tat. And that, if people
will fall for it, is a lot of market.

&gt; altogether.  Like I said, the usability problems in providing such an
&gt; experience are immense.  Your Microsoft Bob analogy is spot-on, IMO.

It's getting better by the day.
They haven't accomplished such things as shadows and the rendering is
not that good, but there's talking of using the same technology that
has been applied to Halo 3, but in real-time at different scenarios
and unexpected situations.
The technology is there, they just need more processor power, i.e.
chained servers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is that SecondLife is still fairly clunky for the users

&gt; &gt; It's the Microsoft Bob of online commerce. Bob failed

&gt; Bob never failed! I'm still using it today!

&gt; Bob was a vast success. 5 minutes of joke coding, which we're _still_
&gt; talking about today. It was never intended to be a serious
&gt; _replacement_ for anything, but as a joke proof-of-concept demo, it
&gt; was excellent. It got us all thinking about alternative and agent-rich
&gt; UIs like this.

&gt; &gt; If I am buying something online, I want to type in what I am looking for
&gt; &gt; and find it, then maybe take a look at a 3D model in a Flash viewer of
&gt; &gt; some sort

&gt; Yes, that's called &quot;shopping&quot;. It's a proces with a defined goal,
&gt; where efficiency is important. You probably do all of that that you
&gt; need to do, and little is going to make you do more of it. It's a
&gt; saturated market.

&gt; Now what do you (or your teenage offspring) do instead? What do you
&gt; spend hours a day doing? What section of your &quot;online time&quot;, or your
&gt; disposable income, is still up for grabs?  How does corporate commerce
&gt; help itself to a fatter share of your cash? Focussed shopping is
&gt; already saturated, so how can they turn your &quot;leisure&quot; into
&gt; &quot;spending&quot;?  You won't pay more than a pittance to consume media, you
&gt; already think everything on-line ought to be free, so they need to
&gt; turn something you will still spend money on. Just about the only
&gt; market left is buying tangible products with a brand-value inflated
&gt; above their production costs - recreational shopping.

&gt; The intention of boo.com was to be the first Second Life (and no-one
&gt; realised). Yes, I _was_ wrong. Ernst, you were right. The High Boos
&gt; were right all along, just premature by about 10 years rather than the
&gt; 2 years we thought at the time. The Boo business model _did_ fly, it's
&gt; just that it needed Facebook to acheive it, not just a web shop, not
&gt; even just a 2D web shop with avatars.

&gt; Boo's business model was to make shopping a &quot;fun&quot; experience based
&gt; around &quot;community&quot;. An on-line setup where people would cheerfully let
&gt; it suck their lives dry of every spare hour, because they _wanted_ to.
&gt; And while they were there, they'd spend money on stuff they didn't
&gt; need, for more than they needed to, because they regarded it as
&gt; &quot;fun&quot;.  No-one intended it to be cheap, or efficient for the sort of
&gt; focussed shopping you mentioned before. That's not what it's there
&gt; for.

&gt; This is how Facebook already works, except there's no way to buy
&gt; stuff. All you can do on Facebook is throw vampires at people you
&gt; vaguely remember from school. Yet people still spend their whole lives
&gt; on there! It's worthless crap, yet they still flock to it in droves.
">

A rather simplistic view of how Facebook works,
According to that, even e-mail clients fall into that worthless
communication crap category.

Facebook is much more than that. It allows you to develop and maintain
relationships in a way that you can't in other communities, much less
in the real world.
I love for example, the slides that you can adjust to get News Feeds
from Friends you care about most, and filter away the ones you don't
care about.
And you can select &quot;friends&quot; that you prefer not to see in your News
Feed.
You will only get stories from these people if nothing else is
available.

They should implement it here.

8-)

To be fair to Second Life though, it's not a &quot;web app&quot;, it's quite
distinct from a web app, nor does it claim to be one.

It's a &quot;thick thin-client&quot;, which isn't the oxymoron it sounds. It's a
thin client, in that it's a general-purpose client, not specific to
any one function or task (you can shop with it, chat with it, browse
large dataspaces or whatever). It's thick because it requires a lot of
processing and display horsepower compared to a minimal web browser or
IRC client.

Secondly, it doesn't actually need much client capacity. It's more
than a phone or the 10 year old browser that can still get you onto
eBay, but it's not asking all that much, compared to recent 3D games
or even Vista.

Now Second Life on an Xbox or PS3, that would be interesting!
