Now the Stones Will Speak [Excerpts]

For those who hate Israel, one of the most dangerous things a Jew can
do in
Jerusalem is to start digging. Because the more you dig there, the
worse it
gets for those who would like to pretend that Israelis are alien
colonists
imposing their rule on the so-called indigenous people of the region.

You might think arguments claiming that the Jews were alien to the
place are
limited to the nonsensical propaganda that emanates from the less
enlightened portions of the Islamic world. Claims from the Muslim Wakf
that
administers the Temple Mount in Jerusalem that the place has been a
mosque
since the days of Adam and Eve are, we hope, laughed off by those who
read
the mainstream press.

But though few in this country outside of academia have noticed, the
notion
of Israel being the historical homeland of the Jewish people has been
under
attack from far more reputable sources. In recent decades, a new front
in
the war on Israel was opened in intellectual journals and classrooms.
Its
goal? To trash the notion that the Bible's accounts of the history of
ancient Israel have the slightest value, and to debunk the idea that
the
United Kingdom of David ever existed.

As professor Jonathan Rosenbaum, president of Gratz College here in
Philadelphia and himself a leading authority on Ancient Near East
studies,
said: &quot;If you can upend the idea that King David was a historic figure
and
that ancient Israel was real, then you can delegitimize modern Israel.&quot;

And in the spirit of the post-Zionist fashion that has swept over
Israel in
the last decade, these ideas have been embraced by a number of
influential
Israeli archaeologists, too. Most prominently, Israel Finkelstein of
Tel
Aviv University has written that the idea of the Davidic kingdom is not
based on fact, and that David's Jerusalem was nothing but a &quot;poor
village.&quot;

But last week, the debunkers of Jewish history got some bad news. And
all it
took was for a dedicated archaeologist to start digging.

Dr. Eilat Mazar, senior fellow of the Jerusalem-based Shalem Center's
Institute for the Archaeology of the Jewish People, made public the
results
of the dig she had been conducting since February in an area south of
the
walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, where scholars believe the city of
David
existed. What she produced ought to help quiet those who think Jewish
history is bunk.

Amid the soil and rocks of the place that is now the village of Silwan,
Mazar uncovered the ruins of the building she's sure was the palace of
David
itself -- the very same structure that was built, according to the
Bible,
by King Hiram of Tyre for Israel's greatest king, around 1,000 BCE.

Directly underneath the structure that was uncovered were &quot;masses of
pottery&quot; all dating to the 11th and 12th centuries BCE, the era that
archaeologists call Iron Age I, which predates the era of David. By its
position in the site, this pottery, which was a unique find in of
itself,
makes it clear that &quot;Iron I was over or almost over by the time the
building
was started,&quot; said Mazar.

&quot;Once I started to excavate,&quot; says Mazar, &quot;it was as if I had written
nothing. Now, the stones will speak, not me.&quot;

And speak they do.

For those who contend that what she found was more likely the Jebusite
fort
David conquered or something else that predates his kingdom, Mazar said

that
the placement of the Iron I pottery right underneath it makes such a
conclusion &quot;problematic.&quot;

&quot;How come I didn't find any remains of any construction underneath it?
It
doesn't make any sense. If this is the fortress, it was erected a day
before
King David captured the city.

ŒA NAME IS A NAME¹
Just as telling was an artifact only 1 centimeter long, uncovered from
a
slightly later period. It was an impression of an ancient seal, or
&quot;bullah,&quot;
which bore the name of Jerucal, son of Shelemiah, son of Shevi.

Who was he? Nothing less than a minister of the Kingdom of Judah in its

last
days before the Babylonian destruction of the city in 586 BCE. We know
of
him only because he is mentioned in the book of Jeremiah. But the
bullah
proves his existence isn't a literary flight of fancy.

&quot;Layer by layer, we must take the Bible much, much more seriously than
was
ever thought, and treat it as a most important historic document that
contains a lot of realistic descriptions,&quot; declares Mazar (Tobin,
Jewish
World Review, August 11, 2005).

&gt;&quot;If you can upend the idea that King David was a historic figure

&gt;nothing but a &quot;poor village&quot;

If you can &quot;delegitimize modern Israel&quot; then you can also delegitimize
Islam. If Muslims claim they are decendants of Abraham and claim that
&quot;the Temple Mount in Jerusalem has been a mosque since the days of Adam
and Eve&quot;, then they are verifying the Old Testament up to the times of
Abraham.

I compare their prophet Mohummad to the likes of Joseph Smith, David
Koresh, and Jim Jones. I also compare their religion to cults like the
Mormons, and since they are suicidial, to Heavens Gate.

If you can &quot;delegitimize modern Israel&quot; then you can also delegitimize
Christianity and the teachings of Jesus Christ, along with the Bible.

By accomplishing these goals you can open up the possibility that
evolution is fact instead of theory, the possibility that there is no
God of Creation, and the possibility that there is no salvation for
modern man. Only men can change our destiny and course through time.

Those are the beliefs of &quot;modern&quot; atheist who claim there is no God but
yet puts man in His place.

Christ taught that if you do not have him (in you) then you are of the
world. God gave Satan dominion over the world. So, if you do not
believe in Christ and believe in only things of the world then you are
under Satans dominion.

More simply put:

1. Father + Son + Holy Spirit = Salvation
2. World = Satan + Unsaved

Using these simple formula you can see that all Christians fall under
1, and atheist along with all other religions fall under 2.

That is why Christians get so much flack for their religion. You are
with God or against him and there is no middle ground or grey areas.
God does not comprimise but men do and that is why we have so many
denominations, or I like to call them - demonminations, because by
living in (on) the world Satan has dominion over Gods people until they
die and face Him.

As far as &quot;arguments claiming that the Jews were alien&quot; I will share a
little story with with you. In 1988 on a flight from Australia to LAX a
group of Australian orthodox Jews got up and where banging their heads
on the walls of the airplane. These guys where wearing some kind of
black head band with a wooden block tied on their foreheads. They also
had black leather or cloth wrapped around one arm from the wrist up to
thier shoulders. That was pretty alien to me! To top it off the flight
attendants had a hell of a time making them stop. To add icing on the
cake one was sitting in front of me next to Hindu and they argued the
whole trip in defence of their religions - wish I had a tape recorder
because it was quite an arguement as I recall.

You have the floor
