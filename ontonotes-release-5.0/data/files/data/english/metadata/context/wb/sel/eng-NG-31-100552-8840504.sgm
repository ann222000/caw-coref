Anyone know where I can find an upper radiator hose for a 1958 Golden
Hawk?  The part number is 1545037.  I have ordered two, each from a
different major Studebaker vendor and both have sent the incorrect
hoses. The first vendor sent me one for an A/C car so it is too
short.  The second sent me something that isn't any where near close.
The hose they sent has a 90 degree bend in it so I know without even
trying it there is no way it will work.

The hoses w/90 deg bends are for the 56-7 hawks with the crooked neck on the
radiator. A 1-1/2 x 1-1/4 flex hose available at your FLAPS should do fine.

Thank you Barry.  I ordered one from Autozone using a part number I
found on Bob Johnstones web-site.  It was a good year hose.  It
nowhere near fit!  It was only 16&quot; long.  So I went through the hoses
at Autozone and found one that fit perfectly by trimming off one end.

Michael - Contact Bob Palma.   I seem to remember him discussing
finding a hose for George's 1958 GH.  They wanted a moulded hose and
not a fits all style.  I am sure that you would prefer a hose that
appears to be factory.
