Shambling, mindless corpses are getting all gussied up for 4E Although it
might be hard to believe that something as simple as an animated carcass
needed an overhaul, with ample influences in movies and video games, the
designers knew the zombie was an ideal guinea pig for applying the new
monster philosophy. So they set about keeping the zombie simple to run,
but they gave it a clear role and made it feel more like the zombies from
the big screen.

Every 3rd Edition D&amp;D player thinks of a zombie, at best, as a tough bag
of hit points that can take a beating. At worst, the zombie is seen as a
really slow fighter or grist for the turn undead mill. Unfortunately, a
Large or smaller 3E zombie really required a weapon to be scary on the
damage-dealing side, and they were a lot easier to take out than any
movie zombie.

Rethinking the zombie required harkening to the zombie in popular culture
while maintaining the D&amp;D elements that make undead cool. Zombies move
slowly, dragging their lifeless feet, and it takes a heck of a blow to
kill one, so tough is right. But zombies don’t pick up weapons, even
convenient ones. They tear you apart with their bare dead hands. They
overwhelm you with numbers, drag you down, and eat you.

The new zombie is a brute with just enough reasoning power to know who to
kill. It’s easy to hit—zombies don’t dodge—but it’s rotten body just
soaks up blows that would kill a living creature. You had better be
hitting the zombie hard every time, or it’ll just keep coming. If you
manage to hit it really hard, say with a critical hit or a power that
deals hefty damage, you might just take the creep out in one fell swing.

That’s right. I did say, “critical hit.” The zombie is vulnerable to that
now, which is sweeter than a head shot in any zombie flick.

If you’re a player, take a moment right now to thank the merciful
designers that turn undead is still in the game. That power doesn’t send
the zombies running off to gods knows where, but if it doesn’t turn them
to putrid dust, it does hold them at bay. Believe me—you don’t want
zombies close to you. Even though they won’t come wielding greataxes,
zombies can take your head off with their vicious slams. The bigger the
zombie, the uglier the thump. And when zombies swarm you, some of them
are going to grab you, maybe even pulling you to the ground. That’s not
the place to be when the dead come knocking.

As a DM, you don’t have to worry about creating the gnoll zombie or the
orc zombie. The one set of Medium zombie statistics should do you fine.
The players won’t know the difference, except by virtue of your
descriptive talents. They should be most worried about the pummeling
their characters are taking anyway.

At appropriate levels, a fight against zombies should look more like a
horror movie scene. Protagonists have to maneuver to keep away from the
possibility of devastating damage while trying to cut their way through a
relentless wall of dead flesh. The players get a thrill when a zombie
goes down to massive damage, and the DM gets the satisfaction of using a
monster that lives up to popular expectations.

It’s a whole new game, even from the very bottom of the undead barrel.
Now if we only had a few zombies that added some spice to the basic
shambling corpse recipe. Perhaps I’ll go dig a few up for our next look
at zombies....

That looks awesome.  I like the idea that you can critical hit zombies,
mimicking the &quot;head shot&quot; from the various Dead movies.  The thematic ideas
they discussed in the article, like hordes of zombies pulling you down and
overwhelming you with numbers, are great.  I just hope they improve Turn
Undead significantly.

It won't/can't be.  Not all the monsters in the monster manual are
being reimagined constantly like the zombie is.  Hollywood loves the
zombie, and there is a new comic book, movie or video game about
zombies pretty much every year.

Much of this inspiration for this comes from recent zombie movies.

I'm a little surprised they didn't make the zombies have a base move
of 40, like the fast zombies in &quot;28 days Later&quot;.

Technically the baddies in -28 Days Later- weren't zombies. They were
diseased humans. I will avoid discussing how silly the Rage &quot;virus&quot; is...

Zombies should be slow and lumbering. Romero got it right with his
&quot;ghouls&quot;. The horror isn't in one or two zombies, or even a couple
dozen. It's in the fact that they just will not stop. They are
relentless. No matter how hard you run, you will get tired, but the
zombies won't... fast zombies are interesting but not something I want
in D&amp;D. For that you have ghouls and ghasts...

Agreed.  Hopefully, the popular and interesting monsters get this level of
treatment, and the rest get a slightly lower, but still thorough treatment.

Recent?  Not really.  Recent movies have fast zombies, and this is going for
a more classic feel, a la Night of the Living Dead.

Those weren't zombies, just zombie-esque contagious plague victims (of
course, that could be an interesting monster as well).  Then again, I would
welcome fast zombies (like those in the newer Dawn of the Dead) as a
separate creature, especially if they moved slow until they saw their
victims, as a nice surprise.

Technically, they weren't zombies.  They were living people affected
by a Rage Virus.  They don't want to eat you, just kill you, but it's
not explained why they don't attack each other.

The fast zombies of the Dawn of the Dead remake, though, was stupid.
Slow moving but effective zombies is part of what makes them creepy.

Ghouls are a far better way to represent the &quot;fast zombie&quot; of more recent
films. They don't lumber, they like eating flesh, and being killed by one
raises you as one. Ghouls are quite a bit more intelligent than the
uh...modern zombie, but that's an easy fix, and dropping their int by say,
8 points wouldn't have any real effect on their CR or other attributes.

Actually, the human sense of smell is better than it's often given credit
for, and there's no reason why someone infected with something couldn't
exude a certain scent. The question is why no uninfected person ever
noticed.

I do not agree.  They are different, not stupid.  There is no real reason to
have them be either way.  There was a really creepy bunch of zombies in one
of the Anita Blake books that were fast, and quite scary.

Agreed.  That is a different sort of creepy.  I think the default zombie

My biggest issue with the virus is that it does its voodoo in 20 - 30
seconds. that is just plain silly...

I realize that the human sense of smell is good. But it isn't THAT good...

One thing that has always bugged me is how the &quot;biting as vector&quot; type
of zombie plagues spread... A zombie is programmed with &quot;eat living&quot; as
its sole bit of software. So if they get a human they eat them. They
don't bite one and let it go to make more zombies. There is no &quot;catch
and release&quot; policy amongst the Living Dead. So how does a zombie plague
spread? This is why Romero is such a genius, if you die, for ANY reason,
you Rise...

A comic artist by the name of Ross Campbell
[ http://www.greenoblivion.com/ ] has created another zombieverse that is
good. I also happen to really like his style. The book is called The
Abandoned. In it the Event takes place one random weeknight. At midnight
anyone older than 23 just dies. About an hour later they Rise. No
explanation, no reason, it just happens. Now that is Instant Zombie
Plague! You can pick up a copy on Amazon...

Thanks for the non sequitur.  Incidentally, I have always been annoyed with
undead being immune to critical hits.  In my view, it should be the

behead them, crush them, or tear them asunder.

Untemplated zombies are bland. They don't get bite attacks, they
don't get a tougher hide, don't get less or more slowness, they don't get
a swim speed. You get the picture. In a world as varied as DnD, not all
medium zombies should play the same. And tagging some pretty words on a
simpler stat block doesn't make it any less so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There's certainly room to differentiate the humanoids in terms of
culture, beliefs, and response to a crisis. But one stat-block with their
own special non-player only combat trick isn't the only way to do that,
and not even a good way for a tabletop game, IMO.
Also, bland zombies don't help.

pretty bad. Of course, the only one we /know/ made any money was Eberron,

Zombies have NEVER been that.

Except for the Strahd Zombies in the original Ravenloft, zombies have
always been Wussy Undead Easily Killed By Just About Anyone. And they
still are. They serve as threats only in large numbers, and more
because they can impede and distract you from the main enemy than that
they have any likelihood of hurting you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; might be hard to believe that something as simple as an animated carcass
&gt;&gt;&gt; needed an overhaul, with ample influences in movies and video games, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; designers knew the zombie was an ideal guinea pig for applying the new
&gt;&gt;&gt; monster philosophy. So they set about keeping the zombie simple to run,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but they gave it a clear role and made it feel more like the zombies from
&gt;&gt;&gt; the big screen.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Every 3rd Edition D&amp;D player thinks of a zombie, at best, as a tough bag
&gt;&gt;&gt; of hit points that can take a beating. At worst, the zombie is seen as a
&gt;&gt;&gt; really slow fighter or grist for the turn undead mill. Unfortunately, a
&gt;&gt;&gt; Large or smaller 3E zombie really required a weapon to be scary on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; damage-dealing side, and they were a lot easier to take out than any
&gt;&gt;&gt; movie zombie.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rethinking the zombie required harkening to the zombie in popular culture
&gt;&gt;&gt; while maintaining the D&amp;D elements that make undead cool. Zombies move
&gt;&gt;&gt; slowly, dragging their lifeless feet, and it takes a heck of a blow to
&gt;&gt;&gt; kill one, so tough is right. But zombies don't pick up weapons, even
&gt;&gt;&gt; convenient ones. They tear you apart with their bare dead hands. They
&gt;&gt;&gt; overwhelm you with numbers, drag you down, and eat you.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The new zombie is a brute with just enough reasoning power to know who to
&gt;&gt;&gt; kill. It's easy to hit-zombies don't dodge-but it's rotten body just
&gt;&gt;&gt; soaks up blows that would kill a living creature. You had better be
&gt;&gt;&gt; hitting the zombie hard every time, or it'll just keep coming. If you
&gt;&gt;&gt; manage to hit it really hard, say with a critical hit or a power that
&gt;&gt;&gt; deals hefty damage, you might just take the creep out in one fell swing.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's right. I did say, &quot;critical hit.&quot; The zombie is vulnerable to that
&gt;&gt;&gt; now, which is sweeter than a head shot in any zombie flick.
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you're a player, take a moment right now to thank the merciful
&gt;&gt;&gt; designers that turn undead is still in the game. That power doesn't send
&gt;&gt;&gt; the zombies running off to gods knows where, but if it doesn't turn them
&gt;&gt;&gt; to putrid dust, it does hold them at bay. Believe me-you don't want
&gt;&gt;&gt; zombies close to you. Even though they won't come wielding greataxes,
&gt;&gt;&gt; zombies can take your head off with their vicious slams. The bigger the
&gt;&gt;&gt; zombie, the uglier the thump. And when zombies swarm you, some of them
&gt;&gt;&gt; are going to grab you, maybe even pulling you to the ground. That's not
&gt;&gt;&gt; the place to be when the dead come knocking.
&gt;&gt;&gt; As a DM, you don't have to worry about creating the gnoll zombie or the
&gt;&gt;&gt; orc zombie. The one set of Medium zombie statistics should do you fine.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The players won't know the difference, except by virtue of your
&gt;&gt;&gt; descriptive talents. They should be most worried about the pummeling
&gt;&gt;&gt; their characters are taking anyway.
&gt;&gt;&gt; At appropriate levels, a fight against zombies should look more like a
&gt;&gt;&gt; horror movie scene. Protagonists have to maneuver to keep away from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; possibility of devastating damage while trying to cut their way through a
&gt;&gt;&gt; relentless wall of dead flesh. The players get a thrill when a zombie
&gt;&gt;&gt; goes down to massive damage, and the DM gets the satisfaction of using a
&gt;&gt;&gt; monster that lives up to popular expectations.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's a whole new game, even from the very bottom of the undead barrel.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Now if we only had a few zombies that added some spice to the basic
&gt;&gt;&gt; shambling corpse recipe. Perhaps I'll go dig a few up for our next look
&gt;&gt;&gt; at zombies....
&gt;&gt; If this level of deisgn philosphy was applied to all the critters in
&gt;&gt; the M Manual I would be really impressed

&gt; It won't/can't be.  Not all the monsters in the monster manual are
&gt; being reimagined constantly like the zombie is.  Hollywood loves the
&gt; zombie, and there is a new comic book, movie or video game about
&gt; zombies pretty much every year.

&gt; Much of this inspiration for this comes from recent zombie movies.

&gt; I'm a little surprised they didn't make the zombies have a base move
&gt; of 40, like the fast zombies in &quot;28 days Later&quot;.

Or like the &quot;Return Of The Living Dead&quot; ones:

get around me, and start biting and eating me alive.

Spider: I see.

Trash: First, they would tear off my clothes...

Chuck: Hey, somebody get some light over here, Trash is taking off her

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; overwhelm you with numbers, drag you down, and eat you.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The new zombie is a brute with just enough reasoning power to know who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kill. It's easy to hit-zombies don't dodge-but it's rotten body just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; soaks up blows that would kill a living creature. You had better be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hitting the zombie hard every time, or it'll just keep coming. If you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manage to hit it really hard, say with a critical hit or a power that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deals hefty damage, you might just take the creep out in one fell
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's right. I did say, &quot;critical hit.&quot; The zombie is vulnerable to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now, which is sweeter than a head shot in any zombie flick.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you're a player, take a moment right now to thank the merciful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; designers that turn undead is still in the game. That power doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; send
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the zombies running off to gods knows where, but if it doesn't turn
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to putrid dust, it does hold them at bay. Believe me-you don't want
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; zombies close to you. Even though they won't come wielding greataxes,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; zombies can take your head off with their vicious slams. The bigger the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; zombie, the uglier the thump. And when zombies swarm you, some of them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are going to grab you, maybe even pulling you to the ground. That's not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the place to be when the dead come knocking.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As a DM, you don't have to worry about creating the gnoll zombie or the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; orc zombie. The one set of Medium zombie statistics should do you fine.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The players won't know the difference, except by virtue of your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; descriptive talents. They should be most worried about the pummeling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their characters are taking anyway.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At appropriate levels, a fight against zombies should look more like a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; horror movie scene. Protagonists have to maneuver to keep away from the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibility of devastating damage while trying to cut their way through
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relentless wall of dead flesh. The players get a thrill when a zombie
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goes down to massive damage, and the DM gets the satisfaction of using
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; monster that lives up to popular expectations.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's a whole new game, even from the very bottom of the undead barrel.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now if we only had a few zombies that added some spice to the basic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shambling corpse recipe. Perhaps I'll go dig a few up for our next look
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at zombies....
&gt;&gt;&gt; If this level of deisgn philosphy was applied to all the critters in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the M Manual I would be really impressed

&gt;&gt; It won't/can't be.  Not all the monsters in the monster manual are

&gt;&gt; I'm a little surprised they didn't make the zombies have a base move
&gt;&gt; of 40, like the fast zombies in &quot;28 days Later&quot;.

&gt; Or like the &quot;Return Of The Living Dead&quot; ones:

&gt; Spider: I try not too think about dying too much.

&gt; Trash: Mm. Well for me, the worst way would be for a bunch of old men to
&gt; get around me, and start biting and eating me alive.

&gt; Spider: I see.

&gt; Trash: First, they would tear off my clothes...

&gt; Chuck: Hey, somebody get some light over here, Trash is taking off her
&gt; clothes again.

That was an awesome punk rock spoof.  Some characters even mention Night of
the Living Dead in the beginning of the film.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really slow fighter or grist for the turn undead mill. Unfortunately, a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Large or smaller 3E zombie really required a weapon to be scary on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; damage-dealing side, and they were a lot easier to take out than any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; movie zombie.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rethinking the zombie required harkening to the zombie in popular
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; culture
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while maintaining the D&amp;D elements that make undead cool. Zombies move

Bah, I like Spelljammer.  Admittedly as a Monty Python setting.  I
think it falls in the 'not enough of an audience' not because it
sucked (which it didn't).  I never ran a strictly Spelljammer game,
but it was always in the background and had some events that affected
several campaigns in the same world.

I liked Dark Sun quite a lot, and it was quite popular at least among
the players I knew far more than Eberron at least. I don't know how
monetarily successful it was though.

I never cared for Ravenloft, or Planescape.  Planescape was where they
introduced all the names with apostrophes all over the place and was
for the 'cool' kids. It just didn't make any sense to me, and Eberron
has a bit of that in my opinion.

I think Dragonlance did fairly well, it certaintly sold a lot of
books, and Forgotten Realms as well.  Both of those were very minor
departures from standard 'greyhawk' D&amp;D.  Dragonlance more so.
Eberron is probably the most successful big departure, but I don't
have sales/marketshare numbers to give any real answers, just my
perception.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I introduced a bunch of changes for the campaign I'm running up for
vote last game, one was to have a reality change to change the game
world retroactively to Greyhawk from Eberron as I was getting tired of
trying to follow what was what and convert everything. This change was
unanimously approved.

I actually prefer FR over Greyhawk, mostly because I like the gods
better - of course that's original 1st ed FR before they introduced
Cyric and Drips D'oh Earwig etc.

Back to Eberron... I actually like a lot Eberron introduced -
warforged, artificers.  O.k. that's about it really. The rest of it
not so much.  I don't like the changes to the origins of beholders,
mindflayers, etc.  I think it's too interconnected (airships &amp;

Apparently they are getting rid of monster hit dice entirely, and just going
for hit point ranges for creatures in different combat roles (e.g. Combat
Brutes have a lot, Skirmishers have fewer, and Controllers have even fewer).

While I like aspects of Eberron, I haven't truely liked
a setting since, Darksun, Ravenloft, and Dragonlance.

Darksun for the various races. Who doesn't like being able to play a bug.

Ravenloft because I'm a horror fanatic and since it gave me the ability to
create my own dread realm within a structure of areas where the players were
true champions.
So much of a champion, that the world around them was out to get them. The
same thing can be said of Darksun, the deserts were unforgiving.

I got addicted to Dragonlance because of the original trilogy of novels.
Plus I liked Dracoians and it was the first setting that I saw that seemed
to give dragons a place above treasure hording lizards.

Sure, most of my annoyance comes from the marketing angle. Changes
are often being presented as a fix for problems that don't seem to exist
outside the marketing department's dreams, while the /real/ problems with
3e mostly go unmentioned.
But I guess they can't talk about how much time it takes to build a

&gt; Zombies and skeletons should not be valuable.  They are throwaway

If they're cheap, why isn't everyone using them? OK, so they could
spread disease, and the smell could make people sick, but that's two
powers they don't want to give to Zombies.
Perhaps the designers need to be shown what a real corpse behaves
like after a week in the sun. That necromantic magic must be quite the
preservative.

I suppose the game needs another 9th level spell that raises all the
local dead as zombies and skeletons for a chunk of XP. Then you can have
the best of both worlds.
However, they don't want to give us mass combat rules, so they can't
include spells that create proper hordes of undead.

Where does one put the notes on how each culture sees undead,
constructs, animals, slaves, and so on? The most common stance logically
goes with the undead in question, variations with those who see it
differently.
&quot;In most lands, zombies are forbidden by ancient custom and law and
expected to be destroyed on sight by those capable of doing so. Those that
are created in secret are often instructed to kill anyone who sees them so
they won't be reported. In times of urgency, a few may be temporarily
created for assistance by less law-abiding types.&quot;

Having a default flavour doesn't stop you adding your own, though

&gt;&gt;    OA, Dragonlance, Spelljammer, Ravenloft, Darksun, Al-Quadim,
&gt;&gt; Maztica, Planescape, Birthright, Mystara/Red Steel, Eberron.

&gt; Those settings did not redesign all the monsters and races.  Some did
&gt; some.

Well, yes, and 4e won't do them all beyond the need to fit the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Spelljammer would've been better set in the etherial plane, sailing
between alternate primes, githyanki pirates, Moander island, that sort of
junk. Too many nerds take their DnD seriously for miniature giant space
hamsters to have a place, even though they inspired best NPC quote EVAR.

The story arc in darksun was kinda overwhelming to me, even if you
liked the big-stat, psi-heavy, gear-lite idea (which was way too harsh for
many players) it always seemed difficult to avoid the background story.

Birthright was OK. But they couldn't decide what type of game it was
supposed to be, and trying to be all three left everyone with unwanted
baggage. The games other than DnD in it just weren't all that good either
(and being 2nd edition, neither was the DnD, in retrospect).

Now, Al-Quadim was great stuff. AFAICT, it sold well, played well, had
some top suppliments, and they killed it inside a year so they could start
on the next one. The Complete Sha'irs Handbook is one of the best books
DnD's had over the years, IMO.

Ah, the memories. I totally knew a guy at uni who spent all his
money, and all his loans, on DnD books. At least until he started taking
his alcoholism more seriously. If the exchange rate had been a little
kinder I might have been able to read them all.

I was running the Savage Tide in Eberron, but I've come to the conclusion that
it does the setting a disservice - because you simply *can't* get into the world
as it actually is without abandoning the plot of the modules - and will probably
end up starting a new campaign with the same PCs, doing something
Eberron-specific.

This is something of which I think the players will approve, because most of
them are playing to try out the setting, not because they care about Savage
Tide. Can't blame them for that; they haven't read it, they don't know how cool
it is.

If I ever do Savage Tide in the future, I'll probably use my own setting.

You are confusing &quot;crappy vampires&quot; with &quot;zombies.&quot;  You may have noticed
that they sabotaged everything in a very planned way before they attacked,
and used other intelligent tactics.  Too bad the movie sucked; the premise
was very good.

They have mentioned a few times that making NPCs will be much easier.  If
the skills are SAGA skills, that is one factor that would simplify NPCs.
Less reliance on gear would help as well.  Also, NPC &quot;classes&quot; a la
Mastering Iron Heroes would *really* speed things up for non-PC class NPCs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;    Though I do recognise they're fixing some real problems too. 3e stat

True.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;    Come on Mal, play the game. Spellcasters and some monsters make
&gt;&gt;&gt; Zombies, and they're generally too valuable to leave lying around any
&gt;&gt;&gt; old place.

&gt;&gt; I see that as a problem, quite frankly (forgive the tangent, please).
&gt;&gt; Zombies and skeletons should not be valuable.  They are throwaway
&gt;&gt; monsters to a necromancer or demon, and should be treated as such.  How
&gt;&gt; the Hell are you going to assemble a proper zombie horde if you have to
&gt;&gt; pay a king's ransom to do so?  You are better off hiring ogre
&gt;&gt; mercenaries ;-)

&gt;    If they're cheap, why isn't everyone using them?
">

Well, a lack of bodies might slow things down.  I think any necromancer who
has any decent level of power *should* be able to assemble a horde.  Instead
of having an undead control limit based upon Level times a multiplier, they
should make it Level squared or the like.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; OK, so they could spread disease, and the smell could make people sick,
&gt; but that's two powers they don't want to give to Zombies.
&gt;    Perhaps the designers need to be shown what a real corpse behaves
&gt; like after a week in the sun. That necromantic magic must be quite the
&gt; preservative.

I figure it is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;    I suppose the game needs another 9th level spell that raises all the
&gt; local dead as zombies and skeletons for a chunk of XP. Then you can have
&gt; the best of both worlds.

That is not a bad idea.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However, they don't want to give us mass combat rules, so they can't
&gt; include spells that create proper hordes of undead.

Yeah, we need those too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    Minor undead aren't supposed to be important.

&gt;&gt;&gt;    Can be != should be.

&gt;&gt; I think they should be, in certain adventures.  For example, have you
&gt;&gt; ever run the Role Aids module Undead?

&gt;    My groups back then were never much into 3rd party stuff, TSR was
&gt; producing more than anyone could expect to buy anyway. So no, and I'm not
&gt; aware of anyone redoing it more recently.

It was a great setting.  A group of Lichlords, and tons of minor undead to
be dealt with continuously.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; The designers are removing that from the game, alongside various other
&gt;&gt;&gt; things I have come to enjoy about it.

&gt;&gt; Such as?

&gt;    Resource management and the ability to exaust your mojo,
">

I think resource management is going to be even *more* important, in
general.  You are going to have &quot;per day,&quot; &quot;per encounter,&quot; and &quot;per round&quot;
stuff.  The former two must be managed for *all* character classes, rather
than just spellcasters.  In comparing, say, a Warblade to a Fighter, the
Fighter has almost no resource management, while the Warblade has quite a
bit.  I like the Warblade more, due to the resource management coupled with
tactical expertise needed to play one fully.
