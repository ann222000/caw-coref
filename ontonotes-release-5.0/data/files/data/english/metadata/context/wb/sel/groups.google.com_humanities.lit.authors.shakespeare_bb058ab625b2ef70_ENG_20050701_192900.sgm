Go Back!

This is some stuff stolen from George Carlin. He's been working for
something on the order of 40 years, so there's a lot of material to rob
him of.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This little diddy is from his latest special, Complaints and Greivances.
I put it up as a .wav because I didn't think reading it was as funny. So
here.
And take this one for good measure.
If ya click and it does nothing, right click and &quot;Save Target As...&quot; so
you find it and listen to it later.

Am I the only one who's laughing when these commercials come on TV for
Snapper lawnmowers?
A snapper is a pussy, okay? That's what it means: Snapper means Pussy.
It's derived from an older, more specific term: Snapping Pussy. This
describes a particular type of pussy, one with good quick muscular
control, kind of an elasticity in the vaginal wall, that'll grab a hold
of ya and give ya a decent hump, ya know what I mean?
But now, snapper means any kind of pussy and they named a lawnmower
after it. Now I have seen a few snappers in my day...
Never saw one that could cut grass.

&quot;I'd like to talk a little bit about the war in the Persian Gulf. BIG
doings in the Persian Gulf. Ya know my favorite part of that war? It's
the first war we had that was on every channel plus cable. It got good
ratings, too. Well, we like war! We're a war-like people. We like war
because we're good at it. Ya know why? 'Cause we get a lot of practice.
This country's only 200 years old and already we've had ten major wars.
We average a major war every 20 years in this country, so we're good at
it! And it's a good thing we are, we're not very good at anything else.
Can't make a decent car. Can't make a TV set or a VCR worth a fuck.
Can't educate our young people. Can't get healthcare to our old people.
But we can bomb the shit out of your country! Especially if your country
is full of brown people. Right? That's our new job in the world: bombing
brown people. Iraq, Panama, Grenada, If you got some brown people in
your country, tell 'em to watch da fuck out. Well can ya remember any
white people we've ever bombed? The Germans are the only ones, and thats
'cause they were cutting in on our action. They wanted to dominate the
world. Bullshit, that's our fuckin' job!
&quot;Anyway, I don't feel the same way about war that most people do, I
don't get all choked up about yellow ribbons and American flags. To me,
war is a lot of prick waving. That's all it is. War is a lotta men
standing in a field waving their pricks at one another. Men are insecure
about the size of their dicks and so they have to kill each other over
the idea. That's what that jock bullshit and strutting in bars and
locker rooms is all about. It's called Dick Fear. Men are terrified that
their dicks are inadequate, so they have to compete with one another to
feel better about themselves. And since war is the ultimate competition,
basically, men are killing eachother to improve their self esteem. Ya
don't have to be a political scientist or a history major to see the
Bigger Dick Foregn Policy theory at work. It sounds like this: &quot;What?
They have bigger dicks? Bomb them!&quot; And the bombs and bullets and
rockets are all shaped like dicks. It's that sub- conscious need to
project the penis into other people's affairs. It's called Fucking With
People!
So, as far as I'm concerned, that thing in the Persian Gulf was a BIG
prick-waving dick fight. In this case, Saddam Hussein had questioned the
size of George Bush's Dick. And George has been called a wimp for so
long that he now has to at out his manhood fantasies by sending other
people's children to die. This whole country has a manhood problem. You
can tell by the language we use. What did we do wrong in Vietnam? We
pulled out. Not a very manly thing to do, is it? Before the war, George
Bush said, &quot;This will not be another Vietnam...&quot; He actually used these
words, &quot;This time we're going all the way!&quot; Imagine that, an American
President using the sexual slang of a thirteen-year-old to describe his
foregn policy. If you wanna know what happened in the Persian Gulf just
remember the names of the two men running that war: Dick Chaney and
Colin Powell. Somebody got fucked in the ass!

The first time a child hears lyrics are nursery rhymes. And they hear
them at that much more gathering age, zero through five. And that's
their first introduction to bizzare behavior. You've thought about your
nursery rhymes. Quite a gang we had in there. They were all on obvious
various drug experiences. And each of them had his or her fave. I got to
thinking of this when the phrase Snow White occured to me. I though,
&quot;Heheh, Snow White, right.&quot; I didn't know if it was smack or coke. And I
thought, &quot;Well... can't be smack, too much housework to do with those
seven little devils running around. Gotta be somethin' to pep you up,
somthin' to make you wanna wash the garage.&quot;
The seven dwarves were each on different little trips:
Happy was into grass and grass alone. Just occasionally some hash, make
a little holiday for him.
Sleepy was into reds.
Grumpy: too much speed.
Sneezy was a full-blown coke freak.
Doc was a connection.
Dopey was into everything. Any old orifice will do for Dopey. He's
always got his arm out and his leg up.
And then the one we always forget because he was Bashful. Bashful didn't
use drugs, he was paranoid on his own. Didn't need any help on that
ladder.
Other people in those nursery rhymes... take Old King Cole. Figure what
they did: Old King Cole was a merry old soul, and a merry old soul was
he. He called for his pipe and he called for his bowl, I guess we all
know about Old King Cole. He wanted to get high and listen to the
fiddlers.
Hansel and Gretel discovered the Gingerbread House about forty-five
minutes after they discovered the mushrooms.
&quot;Yeah, I see it too.&quot;
Mary, Mary, quite contrary, how does your garden grow? Silver bells and
cockle shells and an acre and a half of Killer Shit
Little Jack Horner sat in the corner eating his christmas pie. Stuck in
his thumb and pulled out a plumb and said, &quot;Holy shit, am I high.&quot;
Mary had a little gram? no...
Mary had a little lamb. It's stash was white as snow. And every where
that Mary went, they'd both enjoy the blow!
Little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey. Along
came a spider and sat down beside her and they rapped for about an hour
and a half.
Goldilocks was a speed freak looking for a place to crash. It's obvious,
who else would go to a bears house? And you notice, she didn't eat much,
little porridge, right in the sack.

Scientists in Sweden today may have engineered a plant that can solve
the world's hunger problem. The plant itself has no food value to speak
of, but when it reaches maturity, it uproots itself in the night and
sneaks over and steals food from the neighbors.

A prayer to separation of church and state:
Our father who art in heaven and to the republic for which it stands,
Thy kingdom, one nation, indivisible, as it is in heaven,
Give us this day as we forgive those who so proudly we hail,
And crown thy good into temptation,
But deliver us from twilight, Amen

&quot;My job essentially is... thinking up goofy shit. It comes right down to
that- I mean, you don't have time all week. Signing checks, going to the
laundry, answering the door, 'Herbie, c'mere'. Lot of interruptions...
&quot;So I think up the goofy shit and I come here on the weekend and report
it to you. For instance: have you ever noticed on the escalator... that
the handrail moves a little bit faster than the thing you're standing
on? Have you noticed that all frozen peas are the same size? There are
no really large frozen peas. It's like... have you ever started a path?
No one bothers to start one. We don't mind using the ones that are
there. &quot;Over here on the path, Ding.&quot; Y'ever take the time, start a
path. It's hard, you gotta hold the grass down yourself at first.
&quot;If you're a discuss thrower, and you practice alone, you gotta go get
it yourself. All the shit you can talk about, nobody bothers talkin
about. Who empties the wishing well?
&quot;Acupunture: We all know you can go to the acupunturist if your
complaint is pain. Can you go to the acupuncturist if your complaint is
that you have thousands of tiny needle holes all over your body? What
would he do?&quot;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------
&quot;Y'ever been talking with someone and you accidentally laugh through
your nose and blow a snot on your shirt? And ya kinda have to keep
talking... and make believe its part of the design.&quot;
&quot;If two guys are in an elevator and one guy farts everybody knows who
did it.&quot;
Things you don't wanna here:
&quot;Honey, its the police. They have a search warrant, and the cocain is
still in the living room.&quot;
&quot;Mom, I got a big date tonight, can I borrow a french tickler from you?&quot;
&quot;Remember how we always told the children never to play on the railroad
tracks?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm trying to save space. I wanna put more Short Takes here though, so
what I'm gonna do is make a buncha links. It's gonna be in Windows 95
Wordpad .doc format, if your computer can't read that, fuck you, go buy
the books like I did ya cheap bastard.
Part I
Part II

Oh, if the links are broken, come back in like a week. I should've fixed
it by then.

YOU ARE ALL DISEASED
Has anyone else had enough of this cigar-smoking shit? White Pussy
Businessman suckin' on a Big Brown Dick! That's all it is, that's all it
ever was, a Big Brown Dick! Sigmund Freud said,&quot;Sometimes a cigar is
just a cigar.&quot; Oh yeah? Well, sometimes it's a Big Brown Dick! And a
White Pussy Businessman is suckin' on the wet end of it.

A True Story of Immunization:
When I was a little boy, in New York City, in the 1940's, we swam in the
Hudson River. And it was filled with raw sewage, OK? We swam in Raw
Sewage! You know, to cool off! At that time, the big fear was Polio,
thousands of kids dying of Polio. In my neighborhood, no one ever got
Polio, No one, Ever, ya know why? 'Cause we swam in Raw Sewage! It
strenghtened our immune systems. The Polio never had a prayer, we were
tempered in raw shit!

Political Bullshit Words:
Happens to be:
He happens to be Black, like it's a fuckin' accident. &quot;He happens to be
black?&quot;
&quot;Yes, he happens to be black.&quot;
&quot;Oh, yeah, yeah... he had two black parents?&quot;
&quot;Oh, yes, yes he did.&quot;
&quot;And they fucked?&quot;
&quot;Oh, indeed they did.&quot;
&quot;So where does the surprise part come in? I should think it would be
more interesting if he just happened to be Scandinavian.&quot; Openly:
He's openly gay. But that's the only one they use it on. You wouldn't
say he's openly black... well maybe James Brown. Or Louis Farakhan (I
don't know how to spell His last name). Louis Farakhan is openly black.
Colin Powell is not openly black. Colin Powell is openly white. He just
happens to be black.
