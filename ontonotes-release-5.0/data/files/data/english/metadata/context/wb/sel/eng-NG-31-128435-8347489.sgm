Below is a letter published in the Baltimore Sun today.  Let's see some
similar letters in Virginia.

Warner's proposal would continue war

Far from calling for a meaningful troop pullout, Sen. John W. Warner
actually laid down a blueprint for the indefinite continuation of the Iraq
debacle (&quot;Senator advises start of pullout,&quot; Aug. 24).

First, rather than call for a meaningful troop withdrawal, Mr. Warner called
for a symbolic drawdown of as few as 5,000 troops by Christmas.

This is an obvious public relations ploy designed not to begin winding down
this disaster but to pacify the American public with an emotional
Christmas-time return of a token number of troops.

Mr. Warner also jumps on the &quot;it's al-Maliki's fault&quot; bandwagon.

By scapegoating Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki for the disaster in
Iraq, which is clearly President Bush's responsibility, Mr. Warner joins the
chorus of those who may give Mr. Bush an opportunity to indefinitely
continue this madness - by dumping Mr. al-Maliki and then arguing that we
must give his replacement a reasonable opportunity to fix things.

Why can't the mainstream media see through this nonsense?

Just remain calm Kevin.  Yes it's more BS and posturing but the continuing
word from The PALMS drinking crowd is that he is stepping down.  A Labor Day
announcement was circulating last night and one has to believe that Tom
Davis is wearing out the carpet in his office pacing.  There is some
juggling going on in the backrooms, excuse me in the DCshadows, and as soon
as the veracity of additional input canbe determined it will be posted at
that blog.

If I were a betting man; I would say that al-malki is a dead man.

I expect Sen. Warner is stepping down as well but his &quot;withdrawal&quot; is
exactly the type of thing the peace movement needs to watch out for because
it is where the leadership of the Democrats and Republicans are.  There will
be a reduction in troops - probably even some lovely &quot;troops come home for
Christmas&quot; photos - maybe even tens of thousands come home next year.  But,
we won't get below 100,000 troops and by the time Hillary is in office it
will be time to re-escalate to &quot;win the peace&quot; Democratic Party style (think
LBJ killing millions of Vietnamese).  The first woman president will
calculate that she will not be able to &quot;lose&quot; the war and get re-elected.
She may even have to bomb Iran if Bush does not do the deed.  A
warrior-goddess is the image she wants - after-all it is the warrior
presidents that get monuments on the mall!

In other words - calm the people down for the election year so the war can
continue and the American way of life (i.e. oil dependency) can continue.

As to Virginia's next senator - the choice of Rep. Davis - a leadership
Republican with a pretty ugly record even though he is considered a
&quot;moderate&quot;; or former Governor Warner - a corporate Democrat who is as
mainstream as they come and who will not rock the boat when it comes to
corporate-government dominated by militarism - not a very hopeful choice for
changing the direction of the government.

Kevin you are away out of line on your Hillary assumption of being nominated
and shartly I will be posting the stradegy to dead lock the convention and
have to move to draft a Gore/Obama ticket with Sec. of Defense Edwards, and
Attorney Gen. Kucinich.  I meet tomorrow for lunch with three plus me at the
heart of managing the convention.  Again take it easy...this race is a long
way from the finish!

I agree the Christmas Package is pure insulting Bull (BuShit)!

Seriously, I have not doubt that helped.  Tony, Steve and Ron are the kind
of messengers that would have an impact on Warner.
