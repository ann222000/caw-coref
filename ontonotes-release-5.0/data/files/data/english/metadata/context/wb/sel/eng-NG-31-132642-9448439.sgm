TATA STEEL, SAIL LIKELY TO FORM JV FOR COAL MINING

NEW ENTITY MAY HAVE AN INITIAL CAPITAL OF RS 2CR, SHARED EQUALLY

Tata Steel and the state-run SAIL--the country's two biggest makers of
the alloy -- are all set to form a joint venture to mine coal blocks
for securing assured coking coal supply to meet their increasing
production needs. &quot;Steel Authority of India and Tata Steel are likely
to sign an agreement to form a JV company for mining four coking coal
blocks, most likely in Jharkhand, which have reserves of about 500
million tonnes for meeting their production needs,&quot; a senior
government executive told. He said, both the companies would seek to
put in place a formal JV company through the pact and then begin
scouting for more coal blocks. The board would have representatives
from both the companies. The new entity is likely to have an initial
capital of Rs 2 crore, to be shared equality. In view of the growing
steel demand, both the firms have embarked on major capacity
expansions to ramp up production capacities. While SAIL aims to
increase output to 26 million tonnes at a cost of more than Rs 50,000
crore, Tata is also executing major brown-field and greenfield
expansion projects. The move comes amid efforts by many metal
companies in India and abroad to ensure raw material supplies. SAIL
itself has formed another joint venture with four other public sector
firms to acquire overseas coal properties. Besides, the overseas wing
of Coal India is also reported to be scouting for coalmines in
Mozambique and Australia. &quot;Due to major expansion plans of steel
firms, securing raw materials is crucial for them. By 2020, more than
70 million tonnes of coking coal will be required, of which 85 per
cent will have to be imported if not produced domestically,&quot; the
executive said. India's demand for coking coal may exceed to two
billion tonnes a year by 2031-32, up from about 460 million tonnes a
year currently, the steel ministry executive said. Separately, the
Coal Ministry is in the process of allocating 23 blocks for captive
use by public and private companies as per directions of the Energy
Coordination Committee (ECQ, headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
These blocks have non-thermal grade coal and would be allocated to
steel and cement sectors. To implement the ECC decision, 44 blocks of
CIL that are not scheduled for production during the llth Plan would
be allotted to others. During 2007, the Coal Ministry allocated 17
coal blocks to central and state PSUs for commercial selling without
the restriction of captive mining. This followed allocation of 10
blocks to PSUs exclusively for captive mining for power generation.
Another 15 blocks were allotted to private companies for captive use
for power generation.

TATA STEEL BEGINS EXPANSION OF JAMSHEDPUR PLANT

Steel today began work on its Jamshedpur plant with a groundbreaking
ceremony for enhancing capacity to 10 million tonnes by 2010. The
expansion includes 2.4 million tonnes of steel capacity and a 6
million tonnes iron ore pellet plant. The activity would entail
augmentation of the pellet plant to six million tonnes, expansion of
Hooghly Met coke to 1.6 million tonnes and improving logistics. The
activity would entail augmentation of steel capacity to 2.4 million
tonnes and the iron ore pellet plant to 6 million tonnes. Besides, the
capacity at Hooghly-Met Coke and Power Company, the company's joint
venture with West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, would be
increase to 1.4 million tonnes. B Muthuraman, managing director, Tata
Steel, said, &quot;Though there are many challenges involved in the
project, I am confident that it will be managed efficiently. In
December 2010, when the project will be completed, Jamshedpur will
become the single largest unit and one of the most modern plants in
the world. With the completion of this project, we will be able to
fulfil the promises made to customers better.&quot; The groundbreaking
ceremony was performed inside the works premises by Muthuraman, Also
present were H M Nerurarkar, chief operating officer (steel),
Raghunath Pandey, president, Tata Workers Union, R P Singh, vice-
president (engineering services and projects), among others. At
present, the Jamshedpur facility has a capacity of five million
tonnes. With the acquisition of Corus, the combined enterprise has an
aggregate crude steel production capacity of around 28.1 million
tonnes. Apart from expansion at Jamshedpur, Tata Steel has undertaken
three Greenfield projects in Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh for a
combined capacity of 23 million tonnes.

FULFIL 17-PT WISH LIST, TAKE LAND FOR POSCO: VILLAGERS

'The villagers of Posco plant 1 site area, barring the Dhinkia revenue
village in Jagatsinghpur district of Orissa, have agreed to give their
land to the company for establishment of its 12 million tonne, Rs
51,000 crore steel plant if their 17-point charter of demand is
fulfilled by the government and Posco authorities. The villagers
decided to put forth these demands, at a meeting held under the banner
of the United Action Committee (UAC) at Nuagaon village yesterday. The
UAC members had met twice earlier to finalise the list of demands to
be placed before the administration and the company authorities as a
pre-condition for land acquisition, but failed to arrive at a
conclusion. The UAC has 55 members. Fifty of them, including ten
villagere from Dhinkia, the epicenter of anti-Posco agitation,
participated in the meeting. UAC will submit its demands to district
administration within three days. The final list of demands includes
payment of compensation amounting to Rs 25 lakh an acre, jobs to one
person per family in three panchayats and extending the facility to
the next generation following retirement of the person concerned,
provision of 20 decimal land to each displaced family with three pucca
rooms having electricity, latrines, bath room and other facilities,
setting up schools and colleges.

RATNAGIRI PROJECT CAPACITY TO BE DOUBLED TO 5, 000MW

LNG FACILITY NOT TO BE BEHIVED OFF; PM TO DEDICATE PROJECT TO NATION
IN NEXT YEAR

Ratnagiri Gas and Power Project, earlier known as the Dabhol project,
will be dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in
the coming year, chairman of the empowered group of ministers (EGoM)
said here on Monday. The EGoM, which took the decision at a meeting on
Monday, also gave the clearance in principle for doubling the
generation capacity of the Ratnagiri power project to 5,000 mw from
the current level of 2,150 mw by 2015, which will entail an investment
of nearly Rs 10-12,000 crore. Mukherjee also said RGPPL would nothive
off its 5-mmtpa LNG facility. The LNG facility comprises a
regassification plant (3 x 1,60,000 cubic meter tanks), fuel jetty and
breakwater (2.3km). NTPC, Gail India and the Maharashtra government
were asked to explore all options of hiving off the LNG facility or
taking it over. However, NTPC and Gail India have agreed to pump in
additional Rs 500 crore each on the condition that the LNG facility is
not hived off. Mukherjee, who was a companied by other members of the
EGoM -- agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, power minister Sushil kumar
Shinde chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and officials from NTPC and
GAIL India and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) -- said the
expansion of the project would be done only with the available
infrastructure, subject to availability of fuel at an affordable cost,
Mukherjee
said.
COAL WORKERS SLAM GOVT MOVE

Coal sector workers on Monday criticized government's move to take
away coal blocks from state-run Coal India Ltd's domain and threatened
to launch an agitation if these blocks were not restored. &quot;The
ignominious part of the current exercise has been when a glorified PSU
like SAIL is denied of allotment, a number of mushroomed private
companies are offered blocks, &quot;Jibon Roy, general secretary of the
CITU-affiliated All India Coal Workers Federation of India, said in a
statement.

IRON ORE PRICES HIKED

India's leading state-run miner, National Mineral Development Corp,
has raised prices of iron ore fines sold under long-term contract to
domestic clients by 47.5%, a company official said on Monday. Overseas
customers will not be affected by the move as iron ore is sold to them
the cost of fines to Rs 1,783 ($45.25) per tonne from RS 1, 209 and
will apply retrospectively from October 1.

STEEL NOT TO CATCH COLD IN THE NEW YEAR

Steel is likely to remain the hottest commodity in2008 with prices set
to remain firm throughout the year. An unprecedented rise in raw
material prices, including iron ore, coal, ferro alloys, is expected
to keep the alloy dear. Most importantly, demand is expected to
strengthen substantially, despite higher prices, as infrastructure
development activity speeds up ahead of the Olympic Games 2008 in
China and Commonwealth Games 2010 in India. Experts, however, are
divided on the extent of the surge due to economic, geopolitical and
demand factors. In an interview with a private TV channel, J Mehra of
Essar Steel Holdings and Seshagiri Rao of JSW Steel projected the
price togoupby!5-20percentnext year, while Nitin Johari, CFO. Bhushan
Steel expects prices to go up by 10 per cent. Mehra and Rao said that
the current spurt in raw material prices should be passed on to
consumers and, therefore, a 15-20 per cent rise can be foreseen. But
an estimated slowdown in demand in the second half may bring down the
extent of rise in the first half, feels Johari. S K Gupta, director,
Jindal Steel, too, is circumspect on the extent of the rise in 2008.
&quot;The demand from China, which controls 35 per cent of world
production, will continue till the Olympic games,&quot; says Gupta.
Although the slowdown in demand is not very likely, raw material
prices may not reflect on the alloy. The US economy has shown signs of
recovery and, therefore, demand from the country is likely to renew.
Steel producers, who have enjoyed good margins in the last two-three
years, are expected to fell the squeeze in 2008 with mounting input
costs. However, growing demand, led by the domestic infrastructure
boom, is projected to be met through brownfield and greenfeld
expansions and imports. Year 2008 is set to witness total capacity
expansion of four-five million tonnes to prop up total annual
production to 51 million tonnes. In the international market, steel
prices are quoted in the range of $640-650 a tonne, which are likely
to hit $700 in 2008.

COAL MINISTRY TO ALLOCATE 23 BLOCKS FOR CAPTIVE USE

THE Coal ministry is in the process of allocating 23 blocks for
captive use by public and private sector companies as per directions
of Energy Coordination Committee. ECC had recommended allocation of 81
blocks, with a total coal reserve of about 21 billion tonnes, of which
the government has already allotted 51 blocks during 2007. To
implement the ECC decision, 44 blocks of CIL that are not scheduled
for production during the 13th Plan have been de-allocated for
allotment to others. During 2007, the ministry allocated 17 coal
blocks to central and state PSUs for commercial selling without the
restriction of captive mining. This was soon followed by allocation of
10 blocks to PSUs exclusively for captive mining for power generation.
Another 15 blocks were allotted to private companies for captive use
for power generation. Out of 16 blocks earmarked for the ultra mega
power projects, three each were alloted to Orissa and Madhya Pradesh
UMPP and one block for that in Jharkhand. Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut
Utpadan Nigam Limited was allotted two blocks for power generation.

STEEL SET TO TURN COSTLIER AS NMDC HIKES IRON ORE PRICES

Domestic mining giant NMDC has raised long-term contract prices of
iron ore fines by 47.5%, bringing the price to Rs 1, 783 per tonne--a
move that is bound to hit hard the bottom lines of steel producers
making their demand for captive ore mines even stronger. &quot;The new
prices would come into effect retrospectively from October 1,&quot; NMDC
executive director (corporate communication) Kumar Raghavan said. The
move is bound to hit the steel industry hard as most of the producers,
barring Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India (SAIL), are heavily
dependent on the state-run miming giant for sourcing ore to meet their
production need. Raghavan, however, said there is nothing unusual
about the hike in ore prices. &quot;We have raised prices as per the terms
of long-term agreements entered with various steel companies,&quot; he
added. The company had sold about 27 million tonne of iron ore in the
domestic market last year and intends to sell two million tonnes more
this year.

JSW HOPES TO GET MOEF NOD SOON FOR RS 35K-CR STEEL UNIT

JSW Bengal Steel, a company promoted by Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel
Group, hopes to get environment clearance soon for beginning
construction of the Rs 35,000 crore integrated steel plant in the
state. &quot;The final meeting with ministry of environment and forests
(MoEF) was concluded on December 27 and we have received positive
feedback form the ministry,&quot; JSW Bengal MD Biswadip Gupta said.

ANTI DUMPING DUTY NOTIFICATION
14/8/2005-DGAD; Dated: 28.11.2007
FINAL FINDINGS

Anti-dumping investigations concerning imports of Flat Base Steel
Wheels originating in/exported from China PR.

Having regard to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 as amended in 1995
(hereinafter referred to as the Act) and the Customs Tariff
(Identification, Assessment and Collection of Anti-Dumping Duty on
Dumped Articles and for Determination of Injury) Rules, 1995,
(hereinafter referred to as the Rules) thereof:

2. WHEREAS on the basis of an application filed by M/s. Kalyani
Lemmerz Ltd, Pune and Wheels India Ltd, Chennai (herein after
&quot;referred to as the Applicant) the Designated Authority (hereinafter
referred to as the Authority), in accordance with the Act and Rules
made there under, issued a public notice dated 31st May 2006,
published in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary, initiating Anti-
Dumping investigations into alleged dumping of flat base Steel Wheels
(herein after referred to as subject product/goods), originating in or
exported from China PR (herein after referred to as subject country).
3. The Authority notified its preliminary findings vide
Notification dated 12th January 2007 and amendments dated 21st
February 2007 and 12th March, 2007 recommending provisional
antidumping duty on import of subject goods from the subject country
and acting upon such recommendations of the Authority, the Department
of Revenue, vide its notification No.51/ 2007-Customs dated 29th March
2007, imposed provisional anti-dumping duty on the subject goods.

A. PROCEDURE
4. The procedure described below has been followed with regard to this
investigation after issuance of the public notice notifying the
preliminary findings of the Authority.
(i) The Designated Authority sent copies of preliminary findings dated
12th January 2007 to all known interested parties including, the
responding exporter, importers and users of the subject goods, Embassy
of the subject country in India, and the domestic industry and invited
the comments of the interested parties on the preliminary findings.
Parties to this investigation were requested to make their views known
in writing within 40 days of the notification of the preliminary
findings. (ii) The comments of the interested parties in response to
the preliminary findings have been taken on record and the Authority
has examined the issues raised therein in this disclosure statement,
(iii) The Authority made available non-confidential version of the
evidence presented by interested parties in the form of a public file
kept open for inspection by the interested parties, (iv) Optimum cost
of production and cost to make and sell the subject goods in India was
worked out based on the information furnished by the petitioner on the
basis of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) so as to
ascertain whether anti-dumping duty lower than the dumping margin
would be sufficient to remove injury to domestic industry. (v) The
Authority held a public hearing on 14.02.2007 to provide an
opportunity to all interested parties to present their view. Oral
submissions made by the parties during the public hearing reproduced
in writing have been taken on record for the purpose of this
investigation, (vi) Confidentiality claims of various interested
parties in respect of the data submitted by them have been examined.
The information, which is by nature confidential or which has been
provided on a confidential basis by the interested parties, along with
non-confidential summary thereof, has been treated confidential, in
this finding represents information furnished by the domestic industry
on confidential basis and so considered by the Authority under the
Rules. (vii) The essential facts of the case were disclosed to all
interested parties in the form of confidential and general disclosures
on October 2007. Comments of the interested parties on the disclosure
statement, to the extent they are relevant and supported by evidence,
have been considered by the Authority, (viii) Investigation was
carried out for the period starting from 1st January 2005 to 31st
December 2005 (POI). (ix) For the sake of brevity, the comments of
interested parties and issues raised prior to the preliminary findings
and addressed therein have not been repeated in this finding.
B. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND LIKE ARTICLE

5. As recorded in the preliminary findings, the product involved in
the current investigation is flat base steel wheels of size 16&quot; to 20&quot;
nominal diameter used in tubed tyre applications in commercial
vehicles. A wheel is an assembly of rim and disc with a demountable
ring, which is mounted on the axles of vehicles and fitted with tyres
to enable vehicle movement. Commercial vehicles classified as light,
medium and heavy vehicles comprise of buses, lorries including trucks,
trailers and tempos. Wheels are defined under heading 8708.70 in
Chapter 87 of the Customs Tariff Act and ITC HS classification. The
Customs classification, however, is indicative only and is in no wav
binding on the scope of the present investigation. There is no issue
raised by any interested party in this regard.
6. There is no difference in the subject goods produced by the
domestic industry and the subject product imported from the subject
country. The product is being directly imported by the consumers, who
use the domestic and imported product interchangeably. The two are
technically and commercially substitutable. The products produced by
the domestic industry and imported from the subject country are
identical in all essential characteristics and therefore, are like
articles within the meaning of the term under the Rules. No issue has
been raised by any interested party in this regard.

C. STANDING OF THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRY
7. The application has been jointly filed by M/s. Kalyani Lemmerz Ltd.
and Wheels India Ltd. The applicants are the only two domestic
producers of the subject goods and account for 100% of domestic
production. The petitioners, therefore, satisfy the standing to file
the present petition and constitute domestic industry within the
meaning of the Rules. No interested party has raised any issue in this
respect.
D. ISSUES RAISED BY INTERESTED PARTIES
D.I Confidentiality

8. In addition to comments relating to various aspects of the case,
both the domestic industry and the participating exporter from China
PR have raised the issue of excessive confidentiality claimed by the
other party. The domestic industry has argued that (a) the exporter
has made a lot of submissions without simultaneously providing a non
confidential version; (b) the exporter has not disclosed a lot of
information nor given any reason for claiming confidentiality (c)
neither in law nor in fact can the business licence of a company be
claimed confidential as the exporter had done and (d) given the manner
of exporter response, they should be allowed to comment on the
information provided to the Authority to rule out the possibility of
the exporter filing incorrect information.. The exporter, however, has
argued that the domestic industry has not provided a proper n on-
confidential version of its cost of Production and other details or of
submissions made subsequent to the initial application.
9. The Authority noted the degree and extent of cooperation and
information submitted by the participating exporter and that non-
confidentiality issues have been subsequently addressed by filing non-
confidential versions of submissions made. The submissions filed by
the exporter have been accepted though certain claims made have not
been accepted, but the non-acceptance of certain claims or rejection
of certain information by the Authority does not render the exporter
non-cooperative. The information, which is by nature confidential or
which has been provided on a confidential basis by the interested
parties' along with non-confidential summary thereof, has beer treated
confidential.

D.2 On inputs and related aspects
a) Prices of Steel
10. In its post-preliminary findings comments, the domestic industry
has charged that Chinese steel prices were lower than international
prices and as the exporter had conceded the advantage of a lower
price, market economy status could not be granted as prices of major
inputs did not substantially reflect market values. The exporter has
refuted this submission, stating that the law did not provide that
prices prevailing in the exporting country should be higher than the
international prices and the former should be considered irrespective
of whether they were in line with international prices.
b) Subsidies on Steel

11. The domestic industry has claimed that the Chinese Government
provided support to the steel industry in the form of grants of cash
and land, transfer of ownership rights on noncommercial terms, equity-
conversion of and waiver of debt, inaction on non-performing loans,
grant of preferential loans, directed credit and tax incentives
including exemptions, targeted infra-structure development,
manipulation of raw material prices and value of the Chinese renminbi
(RMB), subsidies on inputs like coal, metallurgical coke, electricity,
etc. Therefore, steel prices in China were not the result of any
natural advantage enjoyed by that country but of ad-hoc interference
in the industry by the Govt, to make steel cheaper. Such adhoc systems
of subsidies that were not sector/industry/ product region-specific
and lacked well laid-down objective eligibility criteria typified
State interference and did not lend themselves to countervailing duty
investigations. Economic decisions of Chinese firms were, thus, not
made in response to market signals and were with significant state
interference. Besides, the United States has reportedly sought WTO
ruling against Initially, the manufacturing process was stated to be
an assembly of disc, rim and ring, as established by statement of cost
of production, which showed that 93% of the cost was on account of the
raw material, steel, which could only be the case if the production
process was an assembly line operation. Besides, the company had
earlier claimed that the material of production of disc was steel coin
but later claimed that the raw material used was HR coil. In addition,
though China's steel subsidies.
12. The exporter has rejected these contentions, stating that the
submissions of the domestic industry lacked merit, as they had not
provided evidence about the alleged subsidies to the steel industry.
Further, Chinese electricity prices were comparable to prices
prevailing in a number of market economy countries. Ad-hoc subsidies,
by nature, would be specific to industries/enterprises and have
restricted availability, so that they were counter-vailable. Besides,
subsidies did not make an economy non-market, as all countries grant
them. The domestic industry could file a separate petition-seeking
levy of countervailing duties depending upon the subsidies.

D.3 Contradictory responses made by the exporter
a) On production process
13. The domestic industry has claimed that the exporter has created a
lot of confusion about the production process as below the exporter
had claimed earlier that it was purchasing all the inputs, they
subsequently maintained that coin and coil were the raw materials. The
domestic industry has held that coin and coil were two different
products, coin being an intermediate stage in disc production. In
response, the exporter has stated that due to certain translation
errors, as clarified to the Authority, inputs have been denoted as
steel of coin, rim and ring whereas it should have been steel for
coin, rim and ring. In any case, they had provided a detailed
production process chart that expressly shows that coin, rim and rings
are manufactured by them and not bought out,
b) On wastage
14. The domestic industry states that the exporter has charged the
domestic industry with higher wastage, but in truth, the exporter has
not provided actual information on steel consumed and has under-stated
consumption by resorting to apportionment of cost between the subject
product and other products on product weight basis. Initially, the
exporter had stated that they did not prepare standard cost reviews,
but later they reported wastage which could not flow from the has
stated that the exporter's response clearly showed the existence of a
number of affiliated companies, some involved in the production and
sale of the subject product. All the related companies were required
to file the questionnaire response. The exporter has argued that on
the one hand, the domestic industry claimed that the subject goods
were not available off-the-shelf and on the other, that related
companies should file the questionnaire response, when only one
company has developed the product to meet the Indian importer's
specifications, production and quality control requirements. Hence,
the question of supplying material produced in other companies, even
if affiliated, did not arise. Further, the company's system and was,
therefore, unreliable. The domestic industry has alleged that wastage
from the stage of steel coin differed entirely from the stage of coil
production, being lower. Besides, the company's investment plans
testified that there had been no effort to add the press required for
coin forming. Hence, the company was not undertaking production from
the stage of steel coil, but starting with steel coin, which would be
costlier to account for the wastage and the conversion costs involved
in its production.
c) On affiliated companies
15. The domestic industry has highlighted contradictions made by the
exporter as below and companies were located very distant.
D.4 Process of Transformation
16. The domestic industry has alleged that the company's conversion
from collective * ownership to private was not transparent in that no
settlement took place between the three owners at the time of
conversion, that the exporter had not disclosed that the company was
not privately owned until recently. The name &quot;Zhangzhou Zhengxing
Wheel Factory&quot; indicated that it was a wholly state-owned enterprise.
A company held by three persons could not be collectively owned and
the response of the exporter could not be relied upon. Besides, there
was the issue of contradictions on the legal identity of the company
as follows:
The exporter has denied suppression of any information about
ownership.
D.5 Capacity expansion
17. The domestic industry has claimed to have expanded their capacity
for wheel production including for the subject product, based on an
earlier indication by Tata Motors Ltd (hereinafter referred to as
TML), which importing company, however, has resorted to dumping
threatening idling of capacities set up. TML has refuted this, stating
that the size of orders placed with the domestic producers had never
been lower than the indicative quantities discussed with them and
hence, the statement was factually incorrect.
E. DETERMINATION OF DUMPING AND DUMPING MARGINS
E.I Market Economy Treatment (MET)

18. The Authority, noted in its preliminary findings that in the
past three years China PR has been treated as a non-market economy
country in the anti-dumping investigations by WTO members such as
European Union, the United States of America and India. Therefore, in
terms of paragraph 8 (2) of Annexure 1 of the Anti Dumping (AD) Rules,
China PR was treated as a non-market economy country for the purpose
of provisional. assessment of the normal value.
19. Paragraph 8, Annexure I to the Rules as amended provides that
the

presumption of non-market economy against a country can be rebutted by
individual exporters for individual treatment if they provide
information and sufficient evidence, on the basis of the criteria
specified in paragraph 8(3) and prove the contrary. The cooperating
exporters/producers of the subject goods from People's Republic of
China were asked to furnish necessary information/sufficient evidence
as per paragraph 8(3) in response to the MET questionnaire to enable
the Authority to consider the following criteria as to whether: -
a) the decisions of concerned firms in China PR regarding prices,
costs and inputs, including raw materials, cost of technology and
labour, output, sales and investment are made in response to market
signals reflecting supply and demand and without significant State
interference in this regard, and whether costs of major inputs
substantially reflect market values;
b) the production costs and financial situation of such firms are
subject to significant distortions carried over from the former non-
market economy system, in particular in relation to depreciation of
assets, other write offs, barter trade and payment via compensation of
debts;
c) such firms are subject to bankruptcy and property laws which
guarantee legal certainty and stability for the operation of the firms
and
d) the exchange rate conversions are carried out at the market rate.
20. Only one manufacturer of the subject goods in China i.e., M/s
Zhengxing Group Wheels Company Ltd (ZGWCL) filed their questionnaire
response and Market Economy Questionnaire response claiming market
economy status and individual treatment.
E.2 Views of the interested parties on MET
21. The domestic industry has argued that rebuttal of the presumption
that China PR was a non-market economy country and claiming market
economy status (MES) by establishing that individual producer/
exporter(s) satisfy the various criteria laid down under the Rules
should be on the basis of &quot;evidence and information&quot;, not mere bald
statements. The onus that the company deserved MES rested solely on
the exporter. Besides, as per the Accession treaty signed by China
before the WTO, only the industry as a whole could claim MES, not
individual firms. Even the present legal provisions implied that a
claim of MES could be considered only if it was made by producers who
were representative of the industry. Hence, MES treatment could not be
granted to the responding Chinese producer. AH information relevant
and necessary to establish that the exporter was operating under
market economy environment as below had to be provided.
22. Legal form of company: The domestic industry has argued that the
exporter has stated that the company was held by three persons all
along and was sometime &quot;collectively owned&quot;. The exporter has to
establish the interplay of market forces and lack of insignificant
state interference in their economic decisions. Insufficient and
misleading information has been provided about past ownership and how
a collectively owned enterprise became a private entity. In the
absence of proper disclosure, it cannot be concluded that State-owned
shares have been sold freely at market price during the process of
transformation. Assets valuation report was only a starting document
in the process. The appropriateness of the process of transformation
itself had to be examined, whether the company was made available to
any interested party or it was decided to hand over ownership to
specified individuals and then valuations effected. Such a valuation
would not be reliable unless it had been offered in the market.

23. The domestic industry has further stated that the transformation
of the company from very small and with a very low capital to one of
the largest wheels producers in China over 10 years as well as the
large investments of over RMB 110 million made in subsidiaries when
possessed of income of less than RMB 10 million was evidence of Govt.
support. Besides, the capital employed was enhanced to RMB 90 million,
85% contributed by one person alone, which considering profits in
2004, represented 53 years of profits. Therefore, the source of these
funds must be investigated.
24. The exporter has denied the charge of suppressing information.
The Authority had been informed of the company having been originally
sponsored by the Association but invested by three private
individuals. At the time of the company's incorporation, the promoters
sought the Association's sponsorship, feeling that a collective form
of organization was socially more acceptable to labourers and others.
But as the Association was not investing funds, an agreement on funds
to be invested by the promoters and their role was entered into with
the Association. The investors brought in substantial additional
capital and expanded capacity after it became private. The capital and
asset base of the company before-transformation were insignificant, as
seen from the financial statements at the time of conversion and the
asset valuation reports. Even if they had benefited under the
erstwhile status, the carryover effects would be negligible
considering the current capital and assets base of the company.
Further, the WTO law did not require that a transformation from state
ownership should be made only by offering it to the public at large
and not to specified individuals. In any case, the promoters held the
company right from the beginning and only their association with the
sponsor was cut off. As regards source of funds, the Authority could
examine the same to the extent necessary,

25. Shareholding beyond 5%-The domestic industry has demanded that
exporter should provide information on companies where they directly/
indirectly held more than 5% shareholding, shareholders with 5 % or
more of the company's outstanding voting stock and disclose whether
the company was under common control of controlled another legal
entity as veil as of affiliation with another company with the
potential to manufacture the subject goods. Further, that State
interference was not restricted to the &quot;fact of actual interference by
the State&quot;, but also if the State was legally or operationally &quot;in a
position to exercise restraint or direction over the company&quot;. The
exporter had made contradictory statements by admitting on the one
hand, having a number of subsidiaries and on the other, that the
company was under no common control with another entity.
26.*The exporter has denied any contradictions in their response.
Zhengxing was the parent/holding company of the group and they had
provided a list of and information on all companies in the group. As
the parent company, Zhengxing was not under the control of any other
company, but controlled other companies in the group. The criterion
for defining affiliated companies under the customs law had no
application in anti-dumping.
*27. Identity of shareholders - The domestic industry has held that
information on each shareholder, viz., individual/ company,
nationality, legal, operational and organizational structure,
ownership pattern and shareholders who made the company collectively
owned, etc., was vital. The exporter has claimed that the identity of
shareholders had already been provided.
28.Articles of Association (AOA: The domestic industry has charged
that the exporter has not made it available, which violated the trade
notice with regard to non confidential version. The exporter has
claimed that the Articles of Association was not a public document and
was confidential, not being susceptible of summarization.
29.Applicable Chinese laws - The domestic industry has held that there
was no information on these laws in the questionnaire response or that
the exporter has followed the laws, despite a request in the petition
itself for such information. The exporter has stated that they had
already provided the information. The objective of examining the laws
was to assess if they provided a reasonable degree of operational
freedom, continuity and certainty to enterprises in China without
undue governmental interference and an examination if the exporter has
complied with the law was unwarranted. Also, the exporter's
questionnaire did not seek information about provincial laws; of which
none related to areas concerned with company formation and
administration relevant for examination in an antidumping
investigation.
30. Raw materials and other inputs - The domestic industry has stated
that the exporter has to demonstrate that input prices paid reflect
fair market values, as prevailing in the international market and
disclose if there was freedom to source inputs (without interference)
in response to the market, supplier identity, their legal &amp;
operational status, the source of and rate paid for power and details
of the power companies. The exporter has countered this demand stating
that the contention that 'in response to market signals' had to be
considered as the prices prevailing in the international market and
not in China was contrary to the express text, that the identity of
its raw material suppliers had already been made known, that the
actual price of power paid was not lower than those prevailing in many
market economy countries and finally that requirement of details of
the power companies was uncalled for.
31. Industrial property rights and legal requirements- The domestic
industry has said that the exporter must indicate product-related
contractual links of any kind with other companies/ authorities/
governments
on R&amp;D, production, licensing, agreements etc, authorizations required
for domestic production and sale, exports, terms, conditions and
obligations. The exporter has denied that any authorization was
required from any governmental authority for producing/ selling/
exporting the product and has stated that all decisions were made
without any State interference.
32. Bankruptcy &amp; Property Laws, on distribution of profits,
repatriation of capital invested, labour policies: On the domestic
industry's demand for information on all these, the exporter has
stated that they have already provided the relevant information.
33. The domestic industry has stated that restrictions on production,
domestic &amp; export sales, freedom in setting prices which are not State-
influenced or set by State- owned/ controlled enterprises should be
indicated, supported with a complete list of all Chinese steel wheel
producers and details of ownership, capacity, production, domestic and
export sales. ' The exporter has stated that details of other
producers to establish State interference in price setting was an
impossible demand, as no individual exporter had information about all
the other producers in his country. The domestic industry has further
argued that OEM customers would demand low prices and the prices of
all suppliers to them would be in the same band, so that the supplier
would not be able to set prices on its own. This statement has been
dismissed by the exporter as lacking merit since when a supplier met
the price demands of its customers, it was in response to market
signals, which action could not be treated as non-market and prices of
different suppliers to an OEM or prices of the same product by one
supplier to different OEMs and actions of government and non-
government controlled OEMs may vary. Just because big volume customers
had a bargaining power in price setting, it could not be held that
supplier prices were not reflective of market conditions, as precisely
for this reason, prices should be treated as such.
34. Accounts information- The domestic industry has demanded that the
exporter should provide copies of financial statements, disclose if
they, were audited and if statutory books of accounts were
maintained., in line with GAAP and IAS, accounting rules followed,
valuation of assets and if reflected in books of accounts, outstanding
loans, their special terms &amp; conditions, source of investments:
whether capital additions/ loans, banks financing policies, loan
applications made, terms of and actual repayments. The exporter has
stated that they had furnished complete details of their annual
audited accounts as per China's GAAP and of investments. The mere fact
of huge investments having been made in recent years did not imply
Govt support and hence, ruled out State interference.
35. The domestic industry has also claimed that Chinese GAAP differed
from the international GAAP (IAS), and information required to be
disclosed under IAS were not required under Chinese GAAP. Even then,
annual reports of Chinese companies did not fully comply with their
GAAP. The exporter has claimed that their annual reports fully
complied with Chinese GAAP and that the domestic industry has not
shown where the difference between the two accounting standards lay.
36. Foreign Exchange:- The domestic industry has asked whether the
exporter obtained exchange rate as per prevailing market rates in
China; regulations impacting the business, to which the exporter has
responded that they had already provided information about the
exchange rate system followed in China which is primarily market
driven. China was a signatory to Article VIII of IMF charter and did
not undertake any administrative setting up of exchange rates.
37. The domestic industry has stated that even if one condition was
not satisfied, the exporter cannot be granted MES, to which the
exporter has claimed that they have provided adequate information and
evidence to rebut the presumption of NME.
38. In their comments post-preliminary findings, the exporter has
claimed that the Authority had rejected their market economy claim on
the ground that raw material prices were significantly lower than the
prevailing market rates in China and the international market, and the
exporter had so far not established that prices of major inputs
substantially reflected market values. In this context, there was no
evidence on record which market rate in China and in international
markets was considered. Steel had been procured from seven domestic
suppliers during the POI, one being state-owned and all details of
quantity and value of purchases made had been provided. The actual
prices reported reflected the correct market prices prevailing in
China PR during POI. Besides, prices labelled as &quot;international
prices&quot; were designated as FOB or CIF and by definition would be
higher than the domestic selling price, so that for comparison,
suitable adjustments to the international prices were required, which
had not been done. Therefore, the determination that their procurement
prices were lower than international prices was without any basis.
39. The domestic industry, on the other hand, has claimed that the
Authority's preliminary findings were fully justified as the exporter
had provided no evidence to establish that the prices of major inputs
substantially reflected market values, so that a vital condition for
MES was not satisfied. Though the company had purchased steel from a
number of suppliers, mostly private, it did not imply that the
supplier prices reflected market values. Barring their own purchase
prices, there was no evidence provided.   Besides, the Authority had
information on domestic prices paid by producers of steel wheels in a
number of countries and in China, to state steel prices paid by the
exporter-are substantially lower compared with the price in China.
40. The domestic industry has further submitted that steel prices had
increased in the post-POI by over $ 6o PMT but the exporter still
maintained the same price levels for the subject product, despite the
raw material constituting a very significant proportion of total cost,
implying operations under non-market economy conditions. Producers in
a market, economy country would pass on cost increases in the form of
higher product prices. -The exporter has dismissed these submissions
as unsubstantiated and meaningless.
E.3 Examination by the Authority
41. The Authority has noted the arguments of the interested parties.
The questionnaire response and Market Economy Response of the Company
were examined and an on-spot investigation and verification was
carried out in the premises of the exporter.
E.3.1 Salient features emerging from the exporter verification
42. Zhangzhou Xiangcheng Xiaoxi Automobile Wheel Factory was
registered on * as &quot;collective enterprise&quot; supervised by Economic
United Association of * having registered capital of RMB of * which
was increased to RMB * on *. On *, it became a sole proprietorship,
having registered capital of RMB *. The Association organized an
evaluation and auditing of all assets of the enterprise and the
profits were paid to the Association and the principal invested by the
investors was repaid to them. The restructured enterprise was solely
owned by *, one of the original investors. On *, Zhangzhou Xiangcheng
Zhengxing Automobile Wheel Factory was converted into a joint stock
cooperative, having registered capital of RMB *. As per business
license of *, it was registered as &quot;limited liability company&quot; having
registered capital of RMB *, which was increased from time to time and
became RMB * during *.
43. On being asked why a private individual had to start the company
as a collective form of enterprise, the exporter attributed this to
the fact that the private individuals did not have land use rights and
the investors had to go to the Association to get these. The rights,
which were with another company, were transferred to the exporter
through an agreement in * for a total payment of * RMB paid in
instalments from * to *. The Authority noted, however, that the
exporter had 'claimed that a collective form of organization was
socially more acceptable to labourers and others.
44. The exporter was asked why in the business licence of *, the
enterprise was depicted as Zhangzhou Xiangcheng Xiaoxi Automobile
Wheel Factory, but in the fund raise agreement of * the word &quot;Xiaoxi&quot;
was missing. The response was that Zhangzhou and Xiangcheng
represented names of geographical locations in China, and the
investors had planned to use these names, but at the time of
registration, Xiaoxi was included to distinguish it from others likely
to be set up in the same location, an inclusion that was itself
indicative of private ownership, as it would not have been required of
a state owned enterprise. Xiaoxi was replaced by Zhengxing in *.
45. The verification showed that as per the asset evaluation report
of**, there as a huge revaluation from ** RMB when the enterprise was
restructured from collectively owned to ?ole proprietorship through
(a) an unexplained re-valuation of inventory by RMB *. (b) increase in
quantity of wheels, without clarifying if these were &quot;the company's
own or purchased from others, (c) revaluation of building at RMB *,
though, as per the books of accounts, there was none, (d) unexplained
increase in accounts payable of RMB *. The exporter held that some
part of the inventory and buildings had not been accounted for piror
to revaluation, which admission itself raised doubts on the
reliability the audited accounts. Further, that the increase in net
assets after
Revaluation was only RMB *, the rest being the investment by * from
personal sources. It was found that the total asset value went up by
RMB *, funded through creditors to the extent of RMB *. Besides, the
details of financing of the capital base of the sole proprietorship by
* were not divulged during the verification.
46. The capital base was reduced to RMB * in less than a month on
conversion from sole proprietorship to a joint stock cooperative and
then enhanced to RMB * in * on further restructuring to a limited
liability company. The exporter has denied any special reason why the
sole proprietorship was converted in to a limited liability company in
two stages, instead of directly, stating that the sole proprietor had
the freedom to choose the form of organisation. The enhanced capital
base of the limited liability company was contributed in kind of RMB *
and in cash of RMB * (as per the capital verification report of *}. In
a short span of 4 months, as per the capital verification report of *,
there was an increase in registered capital to RMB *, contributed as
RMB * in cash and RMB * in assets. In Jan 2005, * contributed physical
assets valuing RMB *, raising the registered capital of the company to
*.
47. Further, as per capital verification report of**, in *, ** had
consigned * school to pay RMB * into the company's bank account and
later paid RMB *, thus enhancing the capital contribution to RMB *,
including assets valued at RMB *. The reason for transferring the
money through the school was held to be that borrowings from companies
could not be directly transferred to the individual private accounts
due to limitation on cash withdrawal. Besides, * owned the school,
too.

JSW IN JV WITH GEO STEEL

JSW steel is forming a joint venture with Georgia-based Geo Steel LLC
for setting up a steel plant in Rustavi, Georgia. The company will set
up a steel plant for manufacturing of TMT bars for catering to the
growing needs of construction industry in Georgia, Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Russia and former CIS Countries. The company in its board
meeting today approved the proposal to invest in Geo Steel LLC (GSL),
to the extent of 49 per cent of equity. Geo Steel is incorporated
under the laws of Georgia. The project will cost around Rs 165, crore
and will be financed by way of debt of Rs 110 crore and balance
through equity of 54 crore.

NTPC PLANS JV FOR PLANT COMPONENTS

NTPC, India's biggest power producer is in negotiations with Bharat
Forge to set up a joint venture to produce components for power
plants. &quot;There is a shortage of good quality forgings and pipes for
the power industry in India and I we want to meet the growing demand,&quot;
NTPC Chairman T Sankara Jingam said in a interview. &quot;We are in talks
with Bharat Forge. The decision depends on our board of directors.&quot;
Demand for power-plant equipment has surged with Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh's government set to make huge investments in the next
five years on boosting generation capacity and upgrading the
transmission network. &quot;Backward integration through the forgings
venture can help NTPC increase its revenue by up to Rs 500 crore ($126
million) according to our estimate,&quot; said K D Mehru, vice-president at
Mumbai-based stock brokerage Darashaw &amp; Co. &quot;The market needs all the
equipment it can get,&quot; Sankaralingam said the state-run company has
informed the power ministry of its plans to enter the business. He
didn't say how much the company plans to invest in the venture. NTPC,
which produces 28,334 mw of power, plans to raise its output to 51,000
mw in the next five years. The company, on October 9, formed a joint
venture with power equipment maker Bharat Heavy Electricals to build
power projects and help reduce component shortages. The government
estimates peg a two percentage-point loss in annual growth to
electricity shortages and plans to add 78,577 mw by 2012 to help beat
peak hour shortages of up to 13 per cent.

MITTAL TAPS HPCL FOR NEW AFRICA PLAY

STEEL TYCOON and London-based billionaire Lakshmi N. Mittal is
exploring the feasibility of setting up refineries in Congo and
Nigeria and is looking at possible tie-up with state-owned Hindustan
Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). The proposed refinery in Nigeria
is expected to have a capacity of 10 million tonnes. Sources indicated
that preliminary discussions have been initiated with Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation. ONGC Mittal Energy Ltd, a joint
venture company of Mittal Steel and ONGC, has recently won two
lucrative oil fields in Nigeria. The recoverable reserves potential
estimated from a few clearly delineated prospects in the blocks are
expected to be over 1 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas.
ONGC Videsh Ltd holds 49.98 per cent equity in ONGC Mittal Energy and
Mittal Investments Sari, family's investment arm, holds 48.02 per
cent. The balance 2 per cent is with SBI Caps. Earlier this year,
Mittal Investments had picked up 49 per cent in HPCL's 9 million tonne
Bhatinda refinery in Punjab, pumping in Rs 3,506 crore. This is the
second largest foreign investment in the energy sector and the third
largest ever that the country has received. Mittal had earlier this
year lost a bid to take over Nigeria's biggest oil refinery at Port
Harcourt. India's government-owned oil companies have already drawn
out elaborate plans to tap the Egyptian oil and gas market and are in
discussions to set up refineries, gas distribution networks and
possible export of gas from the hydrocarbon rich African nation to
India. ONGC is discussing a strategic alliance with Egyptian Gas
Company (EGas) for exploration and development of gas fields in the
Abu Qir area. Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Egyptian General
Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) are also currently discussing the
feasibility to set up a refinery in Egypt.

JUDGMENT

K.L. Manjunath and Akali Nagaraj, JJ.

1. Though the matter is listed for admission, by consent of parties
the appeal is taken up for final hearing.
2. The short and important question that arises for consideration
of this Court in this appeal is the actual date to be reckoned for the
purpose of calculation of interest leviable under Section 61 of the
Customs Act, 1962. The Respondent M/s Jindal Vijayanagar Steels Ltd.,
Bellary is manufacturing steel falling under Chapter 72 of Central
Excise Tariff Act, 1985. Certain goods were imported and enter the
territory of India at Chennai Port. Under the supervision of the
Appellant, the goods were transported to Toranagallu where warehouse
is situated and from the warehouse the Respondent has to clear the
goods.
3. The Respondent has paid the duty payable on the warehouse goods
under Section 61 of the Act. The Appellant levied the interest on the
ground that the goods were cleared beyond the period prescribed under
Section 61(1) of the Customs Act, 1962. The Respondent paid the
interest demanded by the Appellant. Thereafter, the Respondent
preferred four refund claims with the Asst, Commissioner of Central
Excise, Bellary, on the ground that the Department has collected
excess interest and therefore, the Respondent requested the Department
to refund the excess interest recovered from the Respondent.
Therefore, four Show Cause Notices were issued by the Department on
28th January 2003, 29th January 2003 and 30th January 2003 to show
cause why the refund claims made by the Respondent should not be
rejected under Section 27 of the Customs Act, 1962. On 23rd June, 2003
the Asst. Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise, Bellary,
rejected the refund claims on the ground that the Respondent has
failed to prove unjust enrichment and that the period of one year has
to be calculated from the day on which the goods entered Chennai Port.
Against which the Respondent filed four appeals in appeal No. 53 to
56/2003 before the Commissioner of Customs (Appeals) Bangalore. On 5th
February, 2004 the Commissioner of Customs (Appeals) dismissed the
appeals upholding the Order passed by the Asst. Commissioner of
Central Excise. Being aggrieved by the concurrent findings of the
Regional Authority and the Commissioner of Customs (Appeals), the
Respondent filed four appeals before the CESTAT, Bangalore in Appeal
No. 1247 to 1250/2006 contending that both the authorities have
committed an error in not calculating the interest payable under
Section 61 of the Act from the actual date of physical deposit of the
goods in the warehouse of Toranagallu, Bellary District. The Tribunal
after hearing the parties has allowed the appeals filed by the
Respondent on the ground that the time has to be reckoned only from
the date on which the goods were deposited physically at Toranagallu
and therefore, the Respondent was entitled for refund of the excess
interest paid by then, by its Order dated, 19!h July, 2006. Being
aggrieved by the Orders of CESTAT of Bangalore the present appeal is
filed by the department.
4. According to Mr. Bhaskar, the Tribunal has committed a serious
error in not considering the provision of Section 59 of the Act in
Order to reckon the date on which the interest has to be calculated or
to show that the period of one year has to be reckoned. According to
him as per Section 59, the goods will be under the control of the
Department from the day on which all the goods entered the port at
Chennai, Since the responsibility of the department would commence
from the moment the goods enter the Port at Chennai. Therefore, he
contends that in Order to recover the interest the date has to be
reckoned from the day on which the goods entered Chennai Port.
5. The learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent contends that
even though the goods have entered the Port at Chennai, the same
cannot be termed as the actual warehouse as the goods will be under
transit. According to him after fulfilling the formalities as required
under law under the provision of the act and at the cost of the
Respondent the goods will be transported from the Port to Toranagallu
warehouse and the actual goods will be deposited in the warehouse on
the day on which the goods were received by the Customs officer in the
Warehouse of Toranagallu. Relying upon Sub-sections (43) and (44) of
Section 2 of the Customs Act contends that the warehouse goods means
the goods deposited in a warehouse. According to him, the goods were
actually deposited in the warehouse of Toranagallu and not in the
warehouse of Chennai Port, This factual position is not disputed by
Mr, Bhaskar is appearing for the Appellant.
6. If the goods were actually deposited in the warehouse of
Toranagallu and not deposited at Chennai Port the question to be
considered by us is whether the time stipulated for taking delivery of
the goods within one year has to be reckoned either from the date on
which the goods entered the Port at Chennai or actual deposit in the
warehouse of Toranagallu.
7. When the learned Counsel appearing for the Appellant does not
dispute the fact that the physical delivery of the goods to the ware
house was delivered at Toranagallu, we are not in a position to
understand how the time to levy interest can be reckoned from the day
on which the goods were entered the Post at Chennai. It is no doubt
true the goods were under that supervision of the Appellant
department. But the goods were transported at the cost of the
Respondent-assessee from Chennai Port to the warehouse of Toranagallu.
The actual deposit was made in the warehouse of Toranagallu under the
supervision of the Warehouse officer at Toranagallu. On facts we are
clear that actually the goods were deposited in the warehouse at
Toranagallu and the goods were not in the warehouse of the department
either in Chennai or in any other place. Therefore, we are of the
opinion that in Order to reckon the time stipulated under Section 61
of the Act to take delivery of the goods from the warehouse has to be
reckoned only from the day on which the physical deposit was at
Toranagallu and not from the date of goods entering the Port at
Chennai.
8. In the result, we do not see any question of law to interfere
with the findings of the Tribunal in allowing the appeal of the
Respondent.
9. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
10. At this stage it is brought to the notice of the Court by the
Respondent that after the Orders were passed by the Tribunal, the
Appellant department has already refunded the claim by holding that
the Respondents are legally entitled for refund. But Mr. Bhaskar
submits that the money was refunded to the Respondents without
prejudice to their right to challenge the Orders of the Tribunal.
Whether it was refunded without prejudice to the rights of the
Appellant to challenge the Orders of the Tribunal before this Court or
not, it is not for us to consider at this stage. Since we have
dismissed the appeal on merits, therefore, we need not consider the
said submission.

INDIA READY TO JOIN OECD STEEL PANEL IF NO NEW NORMS IMPOSED

India on Wednesday made it clear that it is ready to join the OECD's
steel committee provided no additional conditions are imposed &quot;over
and above&quot; the obligations under the World Trade Organisation. &quot;We
have received an invitation to join Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) steel committee. We are ready
provided no conditions are imposed over and above the obligations
under the World Trade Organisation,&quot; secretary, steel ministry, Raghav
Sharan Pandey said. &quot;Once they agree to this we have no problem in
joining the committee, &quot;he said. With its 30 members and observers
including India, China and Russia the committee accounts for around
65% of world steel production and 80% of global steel exports. China,
which has also been invited to join the committee is considering the
same, while Russia is understood to be willing to join the committee.
&quot;Though currently we have observer status in the committee, but in
view of our massive-capacity expansion plans we are slated to be the
world's second biggest steel producing nation in next few years. So
that is why OECD wants us to be a part of this committee,&quot; Pandey
reasoned. &quot;We are surging towards achieving a steel production of 124
million tonne by 2011-12 and even if we achieve 90% capacity
utilisation it will be 110 mt,&quot; the secretary said. In India,
production figures have been revised upwards, making the country the
fifth largest producer in the world last year. &quot;Indian production
continued to increase rapidly this year, driven by strong demand, &quot;the
committee's chairman Risaburo Nezu observed in Paris earlier in
December. Nezu said consumption in India is also growing at a double-
digit pace, though it is at a much lower level of around 45 million
tonne.

SUMITOMO METAL OFFERS TECH SUPPORT TO BHUSHAN STEEL

JAPANESE steel maker, Sumitomo Metal Industries said on Thursday it
would provide technical assistance to Bhushan Steel for a steel plant
it is building in Orissa. Sumitomo Metal would also provide Bhushan
with technical assistance lor the production of auto steel sheet, the
companies said in a statement. &quot;The alliance is intended to deepen
this relationship and give further impetus to Sumitomo Metals'
strategy to grow its steel sheet business,&quot; they said. Bhushan's
Orissa project includes a blast furnace, steel making facilities, and
a hot strip mill. It is expected to have an initial annual capacity ol
2.2 million tonne when it is completed. Sumitomo said it is providing
technical support to Bhushan since 1997.

TATA STEEL-CORUS DEAL WAS BIGGEST BUY OF THE YEAR

The year 2007 witnessed the biggest-ever mergers and acquisitions
(M&amp;A) deal of the country when Tata Steel acquired Britain's largest
steel maker Corus Group Pic for a whopping $12 billion, The deal
catapulted the country's second largest steel producer, Tata Steel,
among the top five steel producers globally, besides rendering other
Indian companies the confidence to follow suit in their respective
sectors. Besides overseas acquisitions of steel companies by other
domestic producers like Essar Steel and Sajjan Jindal-con trolled JSW
Steel, steel producers also bought equity stakes in coal blocks to
ensure the supply of input materials. Among other deals in the private
sector, Tata Steel signed an agreement with Vietnam Steel Corp to set
up a 4.5 mt plant in the South-East Asian nation. The company also
inked a deal for coal in Mozambique in partnership with Riversdale
Mining, which is listed in Australia. While, Essar bought Algoma Steel
(Canada) for $1.58 billion, Not only that Indian companies bought
properties overseas, India-born Anil Agrawal-owned metal company,
Vedanta Resources (UK-based), bought Sesa Goa, a private iron ore
exporter with mines in Goa and Karnataka. The government also
announced a special purpose vehicle (SPV) jointly funded by public
sector units--Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), National Thermal
Power Corp (NTPC), National Mineral Development Corp (NMDC), Coal
India Ltd (GIL) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL)--to acquire coal
blocks overseas. Domestic steel makers also came forward to announce
massive expansion plans. 'As per proposals made by public and private
steel makers, the sector would see an investment of Rs 2,75,00 crore
by 2011-12 and Rs 8,70,000 crore by 2019-20 to achieve the targets of
producing 110 mt and 200 mt respectively,&quot; a senior steel minis try
official said. Considering the prospects of steel, the government
revised the steel production target to over 110 mt by 2011-12 from the
current 56 mt. State-owned SAIL also announced a decision to invest
over Rs 53,000 crore to raise its production capacity to 26 mt from
about the current 14mt The year also witnessed the government imposing
export duty on iron ore in the Budget. It, however, was revised at the
insistence of the mining lobby. Initially the government levied a duty
of Rs 300 on per tonne of iron ore exports. Later it reduced the duty
to Rs 50 per tonne on ironore below the 62 grades. South Korea-based
Posco and the world's largest steel producer Arcelor Mittal, having
announced huge investments to set up plants in India, could not start
construction process in the two states of Orissa and Jharkhand owing
to problems in land acquisition and mining leases.

STEEL OUTPUT TO RISE 12 PC TO 55.5MT

Domestic production of finished steel will rise 12 per cent in
2007-08, aided by increased output. Production will climb to 55,5
million metric tonnes from 49.6 million tonnes, the steel ministry
said in a statement published on its Website on Thursday. Demand for
steel is expected to grow 10 per cent annually over the next five
years and is likely touch 124 million tonnes by 2012.

NTPC URGES CENTRE TO RELAX CEILING ON EQUITY INVESTMENT

NTPC, after making vain attempts to bag contracts for various ultra
mega power projects (UMPPs), has made afresh plea to the Centre that
condition relating to the ceiling of 15% of the net worth of NTPC in
one project and the overall ceiling of 30% in all projects be relaxed.
NTPC's fresh plea deserves importance especially since the existing
guide-lines for Navratna companies envisage that, &quot;The ceiling on
equity investment to establish financial joint ventures and wholly-
owned subsidiaries in India or abroad shall be 15% of the net worth of
the public sector enterprise (PSE) in one project limited to Rs 1,000
crore. The overall ceiling on such investment in all projects put
together shall be 30% of the net worth of the PSE.&quot;  The Centre has
already waived the ceiling of Rs l, 000 crore. Power minis try sources
said, &quot;NTPC has approached the Centre so that there should not be any
violation of guidelines applicable for Navratna companies. The Centre
has partially accepted NTPC's plea whereby the ceiling of Rs 1,000
crore has been removed.&quot; The relaxation in guidelines for Navratna
companies would enable NTPC to participate in the bidding process for
the upcoming UMPPs in Maharashtra, Kamataka, and Orissa. Meanwhile,
the NTPC has submitted request for qualification (RFQ) documents under
case-2 competitive bidding guidelines to execute the seven up coming
power projects. These projects would be executed through the formation
of a special purpose vehicle (SPV), and NTPC would acquire the shares
of the SPV As the total investment is pegged at Rs 4 crore/mw, the
proposed equity participation by NTPC in a debt equity ratio of 70:30
would be as follows-- Shahpura in MP (1,500 mw) Rs 1,800 crore, Sara
in UP, (1,980 mw) Rs 2,736 crore, Karchana in UP (1,320 mw) Rs 1,584
crore, MIDC in Maharashtra (l, 320mw) Rs 1,584 crore, Chamalpura in
Karnataka (l, 320mw) Rs l, 584 crore, Ghataprabha in Karnataka, (1,320
rnw)Rs 1,584 crore and Jeewargi in Karnataka, (1,320 mw) Rs 1, 5 84
crore.

GOVT ISSUES WARNING ON HIGH STEEL IMPORTS

THE STEEL ministry expressed serious concerns on Tuesday over rising
steel imports and warned that unless production of the alloy grew, it
could spell crisis for the domestic steel industry &quot;After due
examination, we found out that steel imports have shot up by 4.18
million tonne between April and November this year, against 2.3
million tonne in the same period last year, marking an increase of 77
per cent, which is a cause of serious concern,&quot; a top steel ministry
official said. Though production has improved by 6,7 percent from
31.66 million tonne to 33.6 million tonne during the period,
consumption too has substantially grown by 12.6 per cent. &quot;It was
found that in the absence of new capacities and rising input prices,
small steel producers were being affected and they were resorting to
imports to meet their domestic requirement,&quot; he pointed out. Iron ore
spot prices have shot up by more than $50 during the past few months,
which have put small-scale producers at a disadvantage. Besides, steel
prices in the international market have been somewhat stable &quot;and that
was leveraged by the small-time producers to hold on to their
clientele,&quot; the official said. Surprisingly, steel exports too have
risen 6 per cent to 3.38 million tonne against 3.16 million tonne
during April-November this year. &quot;A stumbling block in the way of new
capacities is the undue delay in land acquisition. Take the case of
Posco and Tata Steel. Both are facing problems in taking physical
possession of their land,&quot; he said. Moreover, the allocation of
captive mines remains a big problem with mineral-rich states rarely
being able to take any decision in this connection. &quot;What is more
concerning is the fact that the mining is becoming more prone to
litigation. There is clearly a case for reviewing the entire gamut of
issues relating to the mining sector,&quot; the official said. &quot;The inter-
ministerial group (IMG) constituted by the government is regularly
reviewing the situation. We are trying to talk to the concerned
ministries and state governments as well as the stakeholders on how to
streamline various procedural delays,&quot; he said.

IRON AND STEEL ON THE UPSWING IN BENGAL

The West Bengal government has pressed ahead with the process of
industrialization, with the state receiving investment proposals to
the tune of Rs 86,000 crore in 2007, mainly in the iron and steel
sector. Several companies like JSW Bengal Steel, Jai Balaji group,
Adhunik, Videocon and Abhijeet group expressed their intention to set
up integrated steel, cement and captive power plants in the state with
investments amounting to Rs 86,000 crore. JSW Bengal Steel has
announced an investment of Rs 35,000 crore for setting up a 10 million
ton integrated steel plant at Salboni in West Midnapore district of
the state.

ARCELOR MITTAL TO ACQUIRE AUSTRIA, URUGUAY COS

Arcelor Mittal on Monday announced the acquisition of Cinter SA, a
stainless steel tube producer in Uruguay, and Eisen Wagner GmbH, an
Austrian steel distribution company. The world's largest steel company
said the acquisitions would strengthen its position in South America
and Central Europe. Luxembourg-based Arcelor Mittal said it had signed
a share purchase agreement to acquire 100% of shares in the Austrian
company, but its statements did not say how much it had paid for
either company, Arcelor Mittal said Cinter enjoys a strong position in
stainless steel tubes with net sales for the year up to September of
$47 million. &quot;It is an efficient company that will perfectly integrate
within die growth plan of ArcelorMittal in South America,&quot; the company
said in a statement. Eisen Wagner had a last yearly turnover of S183
million. &quot;Once Eisen Wagner will be integrated into our Central
European distribution network, it will allow Arcelor Mittal to both
strengthen its presence within this market and better serve its
customers in Austria,&quot; said ArcelorMittal board member Gonzalo
Urquijo. Arcelor Mittal said both deals were subject to regulatory
approval. Earlier, Arcelor Mittal received approval from an Argentine
regulator to buy all the shares of Acindar lndustria Argentina de
Aceros SA it doesn't already own. The Argentine Securities Regulator
approved the offer to buy 34.76% of Argentina's second-largest
steelmaker. ArcelorMittal offered to buy the 297,6 million shares at
5.75 Argentine pesos ($1.83), valuing the stake at the equivalent of
$546million. Arcelor Mittal is tightening its grip over assets in the
Latin American region. As part of Mittal Steel Co's $35.9 billion
acquisition of Arcelor SA, the merged company was obliged to buy the,
remaining 34% of its Brazilian arm. Arcelor paid about $6 billion for
Arcelor Brasil after the country's securities regulator ordered the
company to raise its original bid. Arcelor Mittal sees great potential
in the Latin American steel market, CEO Lakshmi Mittal said in the
statement. &quot;This offer highlights our commitment not just to Acindar
and Argentina, but also to the region.&quot;

SHINDE TO REVIEW POWER CRISIS SITUATION IN MAHARASHTRA

Power minister Sushil kumar Shinde has finally stepped in to find
solutions to the prevailing power crisis Maharashtra. The state is
currently facing a daily shortage of 4,000 to 5,000 mw, which is
expected to be over 10,000 mw by the end of the 11th Plan period.
Shinde has convened a special review meeting on Wednesday in Mumbai to
discuss the current demand-and-supply mismatch, proposed generation
capacity addition plans by Maha Genco and independent power producers
(IPPs), investments in transmission by Maha Transco and in
distribution by Maha Vitaran. These companies have proposed a total
investment of Rs 60,000 crore in the next five years. The meeting will
be attended by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, energy minister Dilip
Walse-Patil, energy secretary Rahul Ashthana and the managing
directors of the MSEB Holding Company, Maha Genco, MahaVitaran and
Maha Transco. According to state government sources, the meeting would
also review the time schedule promised by the state-run Bharat Heavy
Electricals Ltd (Bhel) for the supply of power plants and equipment
for the timely completion of Maha-Genco's proposed capacity addition.
The delay in the commissioning of the block of 740 mw of Ramagiri
power project will also come up for discussion. Block I, which is
under revival, was to be commissioned in December. However, due to
technical difficulties and problems in the procurement of gas,
commission of the Ratnagiri project has been rescheduled for March
2008. Maha Genco has proposed a capacity-addition of nearly 6,000, mw,
which comprises New Parli 'TPS unit 2 (250 mw), Paras TPS Expansion
unit 2 (250mw), Khaperkheda TPS Expansion Project (500 mw), Bhusawal
TPS Expansion (l, 000mw). Subsequent to these projects, Maha Genco is
also planning to take up the following projects for implementation,
subject to availability of fuelinthephase2--Koradi TPS Expansion
(1,000 mw), Chandrapur TPS Expansion (500 mw), Coal-Based Costal
Project (1,600 mw), Uran Gas Turbine Project Expansion project (1,040
mw), Talegaon Combined Cycle Project (1,400 mw}. Besides, Tata Power
Company has proposed imported coal-based 1,600 mw project at Shahapur,
Raigad district, Reliance Energy Ltd's 2,400 mw imported coal-based
project at Shahapur, Raigad district, 1,000-mw of imported coal-based
project at Jaigad, Ratnagiri district by Jindal Power, 1,000-mw coal-
based projects at Gondiya by Adani Power.

CHINA PLANS TO RAISE STEEL, IRON EXPORT TARIFFS

China, which makes one third of the world's steel, will introduce
export tariffs on some steel products from January 1 and boost rates
on other items to rein in a record trade surplus and cut energy
consumption and pollution. There will be a new 10-15 % tariff on
stainless- steel sheets; a new 15% levy on steel rubes; and a 15%
tariff on cold-rolled sheets, the ministry of finance said in a
statement. Existing tariffs on the export of other products, including
carbon steel, billets, and pig iron, will be raised. China, seeking to
curb a record trade surplus, cut tax rebates and raised duties on some
steel shipments earlier this year. The Asian nation's exports have
pressured rivals, leading the European Union last month to threaten
tariffs to shield its producers, including Arcelor Mittal. &quot;We had
expected the government to keep tax policies unchanged next year as
exports have been falling' said Ma Haitian, an analyst with Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co., referring to steel shipments.
&quot;Still, the government raised the tax barriers as it's apparently
under pressure from the EU and the US &quot;The export-tax changes on steel
products are part of wider set of revisions released today by the
government that also covered taxes on overseas sales of metals and
agricultural products, such as cotton. The government's intention to
raise or introduce tariff rates on steel products was announced
December 21. Steel-product exports from China for the first 11 months
of this year rose 55% to 57.86 million tonne from a year earlier.

CHINA MOVE TO RAISE TAXES ON COAL, STEEL TO HURT LOCAL FIRMS

China will increase export taxes on coking coal and some varieties of
steel, besides introducing such taxes on other types of finished
products, a move that could create serious problems for coking coal-
starved domestic steel industry. &quot;China will impose or raise export
duties on products including wood pulp, coke, alloy steel, steel
billets, and some finished steel products in 2008, the ministry of
finance (MOF) announced on Friday, The move aims to rein in the rapid
expansion of the industries that consume more energy and discharge
more pollutants,&quot; according to a China's commerce ministry statement.
The announcement made on December 21, confirms rumours that Beijing is
planning further measures to curb exports of high polluting and
resource-intensive steel products. Although India does not import
steel directly from China, certain Chinese varieties of the alloy make
way into India through other countries due to lower prices, sources
said. &quot;China will next year levy lower temporary import duties on more
than 600 kinds of products including crude oil, coal, key equipment
and component parts, doubling the figure of last year, amid efforts to
trim the trade surplus and optimise economic structure,&quot; the statement
said. The ministry also said China will impose special preferential
tariff on some exports from 39 African, Southeast Asian and middle
east nations. The ministry added the nations general tariff level for
2008 will be held at 9.8%, with the tariff level for farm produce
would be at 15.2% and that for industrial products at 8.9%.

STEEL PRODUCERS TO HIKE PRICES IN RISING COSTS

In a move that will impact a slew of sectors, integrated steel
producers like Steel Authority of India Ltd, Tata Steel, JSW, Essar
Steel and Ispat Industries are likely to hike their prices next month
to offset the rising prices of key raw materials like iron ore and
coking coal. Industry sources said these companies would take a final
decision on the price hike by the end of the week. The sources said
the hike in the price of hot-rolled (HR) coils-- the base product--
would be Rs 800-1,000 a tonne. At present, HR coils are priced in the
domestic market at Rs 28,000-29,000 a tonne. Globally, HR coil prices
rule in the region of $650 a tonne. Sources said the 15-20% hike in
the price of iron ore and coking coal mandates an upward revision in
steel prices. While iron ore prices are at around $150 a tonne, coking
coal is at around $135 a tonne. For both raw materials, most domestic
steel companies depend on imports. With steel production rising, the
supply of these raw materials has tightened considerably in recent
months. Between January and December this year, steel companies hiked
prices thrice, with the last revision in October, when prices were
increased by around Rs 500 a tonne. An increase in steel prices will
impact a wide range of industries, from automobiles to white goods.
Automobile companies have already announced that they would be
increasing the sticker price on passenger cars from January due to
rising input costs. How- ever, a price hike is not expected in long
products, which are mostly used in the construction sector, since
prices are already ruling high here. Though the government does not
usually interfere in such price revisions, the steel ministry
constituted a committee earlier this year under a joint secretary with
industry members to monitor .the price situation. Industry sources
said that since no prior permission from the government is required to
raise prices, they do not apprehend any problem.

MINISTRY SOUNDS ALERT ON COAL SHORTAGE
&quot;SEEKS POWER MINISTRY'S HELP TO IMPORT 20 MILLION TONNE OF COMMODITY&quot;

The coal ministry has rung a warning bell after a number of coal-based
power projects face acute shortage of the black diamond. It has sought
the power ministry's help to ensure the import of 20 million tonne
(mt) of coal, consulting ministries of railways &amp; shipping and surface
transport as well as canalizing agencies involved. All these for a
quick movement of imported coal out of ports, there by avoiding
demurrage charges for the detention of ships at ports. The coal
ministry has communicated to the power ministry that, of late, a large
number of plants have been facing depletion in their coal stock at a
much faster pace, A detailed analysis made by Coal India Limited (GIL)
in this regard indicates that requirements and specific coal
consumption have gone up considerably in the recent past. Moreover, a
large number of units are operating beyond 85% of plant load factor.
Further, there has been pressure on the production in some of the coal
companies owing to factors including the law and order problem in some
stares. Power ministry sources told that according to the new coal
distribution policy, coal companies are supposed to meet requirements
of the power sector and other consumers, both through indigenous
sources as well as imports. At present, about 85% of the total
dispatches by CIL is committed to the power sector alone, leaving the
rest to meet requirements of other sectors, including cement and
steel. Considering the linkages/LOAs (letter of approvals) already
granted to the power sector and to other consumers, there is
substantial pressure on coal companies to meet existing as well as
future commitments. The power ministry is already in the process of
finalising normative quantity for power plants, based on which coal
will be supplied. The ministry is considering the plant load factor
base at 85% for working out the norms. In the case of a plant
operating beyond 85% PLF, additional requirement will have to be met
through imports. But for plants operating below 85% PLF, the norms
will be worked out on the basis of an actual or average PLF during the
preceding periods.

STEEL PRICE RISE TRIGERS COMPETITION ISSUES

A drop in China's steel production growth rate to 4.3% should not
immediately be seen as the trend for the days to come. If so, the
country's exports will drop and world prices will have another reason
to rise. Seasonal increases have come in. There will be one more round
of that once the iron ore and coal price contracts are over with their
expected hefty increases. Most steel makers will keep smiling even
with the raw materials price hikes. If there is any favourable factor,
real or speculative, proving another chance to raise prices, they will
have a bonus. The point is, where are the market forces in steel or
the competition? Steel prices are rising- at a time when the queue for
it is shortening. The adverse impact of a US subprime crisis-led
global recession on steel demand is real. One should be prepared to
face a major drop in steel demand at a global level and also in India.
Iron ore prices are set to rise by at least 30%. There are forecasts
of up to 50%. The higher range has been justified by analysts seeing
the current spot price premia on the world market. Coking coal prices
may also reach $140 per tonne from the below a 100 level currently.
While the mining companies can talk about supply constraints and
inability to supply these minerals to all in the queue (their costs
are not up correspondingly!), why are the steel makers lining up and
accepting any price? It is because; they are in a position to pass the
extra costs onto the steel consumers. There is no long queue out here
everywhere. The steel consumers have not been able to pass the extra
burdens onto their customers. One may not have seen the prices of
automobiles, appliances etc moving up in the same proportion. If the
housing costs have moved up, it is mainly due to land prices. Where is
then the strength of the steel industry today? The steel industry is
consolidated and globalised. At one level, the non-Chinese industry is
taking advantage of high costs of Chinese steel production. The impact
of global consolidation is everywhere to be seen. If a couple of
behemoths manage to raise prices or hold on to that even in an adverse
situation, the rest of the industry follows. The steel industry which
is running after iron ore or coal mines to save costs and raise their
profitability, should have made more efforts to raise its steel
production capacity, invest on infrastructure to improve supply of raw
materials to the industry streamlined logistics. If one looks at the
last few years of the steel boom, where do you see capacity increase
outside China? Raw materials have been an issue. But, have you seen
any serious dent in the industry's profit on that account, again
outside China? The steel industry will face &quot; several   competition
issues, globally as also in India.

GST TO CARRY ADVANCE TAX RULING COMFORT

&quot;MECHANISM ON LINES OF I-T AUTHORITY FOR ADVANCE RULINGS TO BE PUT IN
PLACE FOR UNIFIED GOODS &amp; SERVICE TAX&quot;

TAXPAYERS will be able to ascertain their tax liability before
entering into a transaction under the unified goods and service tax
(GST) regime. The GST regime will provide for advance ruling on the
lines of the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) for taxes levied by
the Centre. Advance rulings are binding on both the tax department and
the taxpayer who has sought the ruling, According to the new modified
draft circulated to state governments, there would also be a single
dispute resolution mechanism at the federal level, This mechanism will
be set by the Centre as well as the states, sources told. The issue
also figured in the discussions at the meeting of the empowered
committee on Thursday. Sources said the proposal for providing advance
rulings has also found favour with state governments. This system
would make the GST setup more taxpayer-friendly and take it one step
ahead of the present value-added tax system. The draft also seeks to
limit deviations in the rates and items under the proposed tax regime
in various states. While the value-added tax regime allows for
deviations up to 1%, most slate governments are not adhering to this
limit. State governments have been asked to firm up their views on
deviations to maintain uniformity. It has been decided thai there
would be two slabs for taxes on goods but one slab for services. Also,
state governments would be able to levy tax only on intra-state
services. Inter-state services would be taxed by the Centre. The
report submitted by the joint working group on GST was accepted by the
empowered committee in November. However, some modifications were made
in the draft before Thursday's meeting after taking into account state
governments' responses. The discussions held on Thursday will also be
reflected in the final draft, which would be taken up for discussions
on January 24. If the draft is approved by the empowered committee, it
would be recommended to the Centre.
