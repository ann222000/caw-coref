You Are What You Eat

Spiritually speaking, what kind of food do you feast on every day? In
whom or what do you delight or take great pleasure? The answers to these
questions will determine what kind of Christian you really are.

The Scriptures talk about being fed, feeding, or eating certain things.
Figuratively speaking, they are referring to what a person delights in or
in what a person takes great pleasure.

Our appetites determine if we are healthy or sick in a spiritual sense.

Some people are hungering and thirsting after the Word of God. They
cannot seem to get enough of it. They are constantly reading, studying,
meditating on, and memorizing it. Others are choosing things that are
unprofitable, unsubstantial, and even dangerous to their spiritual well
being.

What about you?
Are you delighting in the Truth or in sin?
Are you taking pleasure in the things of this world that afford no
nourishment for your soul rather than the substantial Word of God?
Are you spiritually healthy with a good appetite or spiritually sick with
a depraved appetite?

Let's examine our lives in the light of the Scriptures and see where we
stand in our walk with the Lord -

* Psalm 37:3 - "Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in
the land, and verily thou shalt be fed."

To "trust in the LORD" is to rely and rest on, confide in, and conform to
His image and likeness. In other words, it means that we have totally
relinquished all into His hands - while being confidently assured that He
rules and reigns and has everything under control.

The best way to keep from complaining, murmuring, or fretting while
undergoing fiery trials is to "do good" - always be engaged in some form
of benevolence toward another.

"Verily thou shalt be fed" - The word "verily" refers to the Truth. You
will find your sustenance in the Truth of God's Word. You will seek after
it and delight in it. You will find great comfort and support in its
pages.

Are you feeding on the Truth of God's Word today?
Is it your great delight?
Are you diligently seeking after it with all of your heart?
How much time do you spend reading and studying from its pages?
What, if anything, keeps you from the Word of God? What occupies your
time?

Are you trusting or fearing today?
Are you a giving person or are you stingy, greedy, and covetous?
It all depends on how much of the Truth you are feeding.

* Proverbs 10:21 - "The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die
for want of wisdom."

The righteous man is full of the Word of God - the Bread of Life - Sound
Doctrine. The true minister of righteousness will feed and nourish others
and guide them in the right paths.

"Fools" - on the other hand - have nothing to offer but death and
destruction. These are the "Christians" who are so full of themselves and
are in the flesh. They profit nothing. They can also be the False
Prophets - the "Blind Guides" as the Lord Jesus calls them - who are
leading people astray down the broad road of compromise, worldliness,
lasciviousness, and sin. Or they can refer to the "believers" who sit at
the feet of these false teachers and faithfully support them with their
tithes and offerings. They are dying for lack of true wisdom.

* Proverbs 15:14 - "...but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness."

A fool delights in the gratification of his own appetite. He runs after
sensual pleasures and worldly pursuits. To him, "Stolen waters are sweet,
and bread eaten in secret is pleasant"(Proverbs 9:17).

Are you delighting in forbidden fruit today?
Does your heart yearn for that which is sinful and wicked?
On what do you set your gaze?
What kind of books or magazines do you read?
What kind of TV shows do you delight in?
Are you feeding on "foolishness"?

* Isaiah 44:20 - "He feedeth on ashes..."

Who in their right mind would eat "ashes"? Yet, sad to say, there are
those who are doing just that every time that they pursue after sin and
the world's ways. They are seeking happiness in money, things,
relationships, positions, honors, etc. and are willing to compromise
their holy  standards in order to keep their "treasure" once they attain
it.

How about you?
Are you seeking for satisfaction from the "ashes" of this world?
Are you delighting in that which is vain, unsubstantial, and
unsatisfactory to your soul?
On what do you bestow all of your labor throughout the day?

What are you striving for?
Does it afford nourishment for your soul?
What are the "ashes" in your life that you are trading the Word of God
for?

* Hosea 12:1 - "Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east
wind..."

If the Prophet Hosea - under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit - would
have simply mentioned the "wind," then we would have taken this to mean
that there are those who are feeding themselves with vain hopes and
objects which can never bring true satisfaction to their souls.

However, he did not stop with the "wind." He went on to mention the "east
wind." This refers to the simoon - the east wind in Palestine that comes
from Arabia and the far East. It is a very scorching, parching, wasting,
injurious, destructive, oppressive, and violent wind.

Hence, what the Prophet was saying here was that the people of God were
not only delighting in that which was vain and empty, but they were also
pursuing after that which was deadly to their souls.

Is there anything in your life that you are allowing that is detrimental
to your spiritual health and well being?
Are you -
...playing with sin?
...toying with a lust of any kind?
...looking for satisfaction in all of the wrong places?
...frequenting places that Christians have no business visiting?
...hanging around with the wrong crowd - thinking that you are "strong"
enough to withstand their wickedness?
...ensnared in business deals that are dishonest?
...or making every excuse to justify your deceitful ways just to keep
your job, home, or worldly treasures?

If so, then you are "feeding on the wind" and "following after the east
wind."
Your end will be utter emptiness as well as destruction to your soul - if
you do not turn around and repent.

* Proverbs 1:31 - "Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own
way..."

Proverbs 14:14 says - "The backslider in heart shall be filled with his
own ways..." Are you a backslider today? Have you "refused" to come to
repentance when God called you?(Proverbs 1:24). Have you "set at nought"
His counsel because it did not line up with your plans and  agenda for
your life( Proverbs 1:25)? Have you "despised" His correction or word of
rebuke that He sent your way to get you to turn around(Proverbs 1:30)?

Did you -
...like a spoiled brat - bawl and squall and demand your own way?
...reject the Word of the Lord because it did not line up with your plans
for your life?
...throw fits before the Lord until He had no other recourse than to give
you your "own way"?
Are you presently eating the "fruit" of your "own way"?

* Hosea 10:13 - "...ye have eaten the fruit of lies..."

All sin is a lie. Satan tempts us by offering us satisfaction or pleasure
from a forbidden act, but, in the end, it turns out to be nothing but a
Big Fat Lie. Something may look fair on the outside, but - when bitten
into - it is full of worms and death. It is nothing but a Lie. It cannot
and will not profit nor bring true satisfaction.

So many are listening to the "lies" of the devil concerning themselves,
God, the Bible, and others. For instance, they are believing that sin is
not as bad as the Bible says it is. They are twisting the Truth to say
that "evil is good" and "good is evil"(Isaiah 5:20). They cannot believe
that God can give anyone the power to live above sin each day in thought,
word, and deed. They believe that the Grace of God is a license to sin
rather than what the Bible says it is - the Power to live above sin!

What about you? Are you partaking of the "lies" of Satan? Are you eating
off of his fruit trees? What kind of "lies" have you partaken of?

Do you believe that -
...you are worthless and will never amount to any good
...there is no hope for you
...things will never change
...you will never be healed, delivered, or set free
...you will always be in the situation that you presently find yourself
...God does not love you, is against you, or is judging you for something
that happened in the past
...He does not perform miracles any more - they went out with the
Apostles
...He does not care about you or your needs - He is too busy taking care
of the universe
...everyone hates you and is against you
...you cannot ever have a healthy relationship again
...something must be wrong with you
...you are ugly, stupid, and disgusting to be around
...nothing ever goes right for you
...you are a failure?

If you have believed any of the above, then you have been eating the
"fruit of lies." It's time for you to lay aside the devil's "fruit," pick
up your Bible, and begin to feast on what God has to say about Himself,
you, your life, and others.

* Proverbs 18:21 - "Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and
they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof."

Every day we are faced with the choice of "Death" or "Life." We can eat
the "fruit" of "Death," or we can eat the "fruit" of "Life." No one else
can make that choice for us. It all depends on what words we choose to
speak.

What kind of words are you speaking?
Are you a negative person always running yourself and others down?
Are you always complaining and murmuring about the situations that you
face?
Are you a source of discouragement and depression to your family?

Or are you a faith-inspired person - always quoting what the Bible says
about your circumstances?
Do you always believe for the best to happen?
Are you always looking for victory in your life and in the life of
others?
Do you lift people up with your words?
Do you minister "Life" unto others through your words?

You are what you eat.

You make the choice of what you will feed on or delight in. Will it be
the Word of God or the Word coming from His ministers? Or will you seek
to find satisfaction in "foolishness" or sin..."ashes" or worthless
things...empty things like the "wind" or harmless things like the "east
wind"?

You can eat the "fruit"of your "own way," the "fruit of lies," or the
"fruit" of "Death."

When it comes right down to it, you are actually faced with two choices -

Death or Life.
Which will you choose?

Just Remember - You are what you eat.

May God Bless His Word.
