Trimble: Honor the Goons? Never!  Email this page     Print this page

In a recent editorial, the Lakota Journal (February 13 - 20, 2004)
suggested honoring the Goons of the Dick Wilson era during his years
as President of the Oglala Sioux Tribe in the early 1970s. According
to the Journal, &quot;The so-called GOONS stayed to clean up the mess left
on the Pine Ridge Reservation by the (AIM) occupiers of Wounded Knee.
These are the people who should be honored for their tenacity,
selflessness and dedication.&quot;

Nothing is said in the editorial about what was cleaned up, nor about
the methods used in the clean-up. For the sake of historical accuracy
and journalistic honesty, that editorial needs to be answered.

For those who do not recall that era, it was in the turbulent times
when the American Indian Movement went to Pine Ridge in response to
Oglalas who felt that their rights were being trampled by a tyrannical
tribal regime. In the ensuing confrontation, AIM occupied the village
of Wounded Knee in a three-month standoff against the combined forces
of U.S. Marshals, the FBI, U.S. military, and the Goons. The story was
front-page news throughout much of the world for the duration.

AIM was spawned in Minneapolis and other urban areas in the 1960s, at
a time of much racial unrest throughout the country. They formed in
reaction to mistreatment of Indian people at the hands of the police
in urban ghetto areas where many relocated Indian people tended to
congregate. The organization made its first foray onto the Pine Ridge
reservation in 1971 to protest the murder of Raymond Yellow Thunder in
a nearby Nebraska border town. A mild-mannered, middle-aged Lakota
laborer, Yellow Thunder was mugged, stripped and publicly humiliated,
then beaten to death by a group of young white thugs. On the
reservation AIM found a new constituency, much of it in the fullblood
and traditional communities, and this served to legitimize their
militant advocacy throughout Indian country.

A year later, AIM again rallied in South Dakota to protest the killing
of Wesley Bad Heart Bull, a young Oglala, in the border town of
Buffalo Gap. This started a chain of militant actions in the Black
Hills towns of Custer and Rapid City, then back to Pine Ridge. AIM was
called to the reservation by a local civil rights group seeking
recourse in the face of heavy-handed police tactics against the
growing number of tribal dissidents.

When it appeared that AIM would return to Pine Ridge, Richard &quot;Dick&quot;
Wilson, President of the OST Council, informed the media that they
would not be tolerated and added, &quot;If Russell Means shows up on this
reservation, I, Dick Wilson, will personally cut his braids off.&quot;
Under the leadership of Means, AIM did show up ... and stayed.

The Goon squads were formed by Wilson, reportedly with funding from
the BIA, initially as a &quot;ranger&quot; group to supplement federal and
tribal police in maintaining law and order in the event of disruptions
brought on by AIM. Although the term &quot;goons&quot; began as a derisive
epithet by those who feared and loathed them, members of the group, in
a gesture of arrogant levity, adopted the name as an acronym meaning
&quot;Guardians of the Oglala Nation.&quot; In the fashion of the Tonton
Macoutes of Baby Doc Duvalier in Haiti, and the Dignity Battalion of
Manuel Noreiga in Panama, the Goons served as Wilson's personal
militia to put down dissent by intimidation.

In separate books by Peter Matthiessen, and more objectively perhaps
by investigative reporter Joe Starita in his book, &quot;The Dull Knifes of
Pine Ridge,&quot; various fullblood and traditional leaders describe what
the Goons' clean-up tactics entailed: these included unwarranted
arrests, fire-bombings, arbitrary searches and seizure, brutal
beatings, and gunfire.

In the first days of the AIM occupation of Wounded Knee in 1973, I
went to Pine Ridge, at the direction of the NCAI Board, to offer
support to the Oglala Sioux tribal government and its president,
Wilson. Tribes are the first line membership of NCAI, and we saw the
Oglala Sioux as a tribe embattled by outside forces, and
misrepresented in the reportage of the mainstream media. I enlisted
the help of Leo Vocu, a longtime friend and my predecessor as NCAI
executive director, and we worked to advise Wilson in political
strategy and media relations. We tried to get him to take a more
conciliatory stance, and to tone down his belligerent rhetoric. When
he would agree to take our advice, he was swayed by his Goons back to
a hard line, and goaded by the press to bellicose outbursts.

I returned to Washington dismayed at what I saw. From my time on that
front I saw that the dissidents had ample reason for their rebellion.
It was not only with Wilson, but many years running that they had
endured neglect and abuse, all too often by their own government.
Their cause was just, and they were being brutalized over their
demands for justice.

The Goons' brutality hit home two years later in 1975 when my brother,
Al Trimble, as a reform candidate, defeated Wilson for the tribal
presidency. That campaign was bitter one. Trimble was able to rally
the support of the fullblood and traditional communities, mostly in
the outlying districts, against what he saw as the stranglehold of the
colonial center at Pine Ridge.

He faced physical violence, including an attack in a border town
restaurant where he and his wife were having dinner. Later, two of his
high school-age sons were beaten - pistol whipped, according to
reports, at the hands of Goons. His car and those of his wife and
relatives were tailed constantly, and were often stopped for perceived
violations or non-violations. Evening hours and dinners at home were
shattered by gunshots from passing cars, apparently driven by Goons.

In the four-month interim between Trimble's electoral victory and his
inauguration, the tribal government offices and treasury were sacked.
Goons were dispatched to Wanblee, a traditionalist stronghold and the
Trimble family hometown, in a punitive raid to &quot;straighten out&quot;
loyalists there who campaigned for him. The straightening-out included
a hail of automatic weapons fire and a car chase that left one dead
and another severely wounded.

Such was the clean-up work of the Goons.

It must be said that some, perhaps most, of those who made up the Goon
squads, look back on those days with less than a sense of pride, some
have expressed regret. Some have gone on to become respected tribal
political leaders, others business leaders. But, for the sake of the
Oglala Lakota and all Indian country, the Goon squads must never be
forgotten for what they were and what they did.

Those were dark times of true and justifiable revolution. The tribal
government survived, but the lessons were bitter, and the schism
between mixed-blood and fullblood/traditionals has served to all but
immobilize governance and development to this day.

Should the goons be honored? Never!

Charles E. Trimble is an Oglala Lakota from the Pine Ridge Indian

Association in 1970, and served as executive director of the National

Willow Institute in Omaha, Neb., and a columnist for Indian Country
Today.
