After two weeks of waiting to watch the repeat of episode 2 of Atom the
mother fuckers at Sandy Heath have taken BBC4 off-air once again. What have
these bastards got against me? Don't they want me to watch Atom. Why?

It's not them but you. BBC4 is on mux B which from Sandy Heath is on
Ch 67 which is at the extreme edge of the band. If your aerial and
coax aren't up to it you will suffer dropouts.

Those crafty so-and so's at Sandy Heath will stop at nothing.

We think it's time you knew. The fact is, you have been identified by the
government's Centralised Annoying Twat Systematic Harrassment by Information
Technology (CATSHIT) as a totally irritating twat, or 'TIT'. In order to
drive you completely mad so that you commit suicide to everyone's relief
your living room has been bugged with a camera that points at your TV
screen. Whichever channel you try to watch is instantly turned off by a man
at Sandy Heath. He has a massive array of 1000A knife switches, each one
labelled with a channel name. This man isn't paid. He actually pays to do
the job, because he knows what an Irritating Twat you are and he gets great
pleasure from spoiling your viewing.

I'm sorry to break the news to you, but it had to be done. Now fuck off.

Bill

It's not just you. The BBC have some new technology which allows them to
deny specific people access to specific programmes. It is known in
Broadcasting as the Counter-Reception Activation Project (CRAP). They need a
good reason to activate it, however, and in this case I would imagine that
MI6 or the Chief Constable of Cambridgeshire or John Prescott certified that
you shouldn't see this programme because it could have been the catalyst for
your unique and totally enquiring mind to have produced some sort of
mathematical equation which when applied in practical terms using the laws
of Physics could have been catastrophic for the human race. The proof of
this would be that transmissions to you of CBBC are not blocked?

FFS can't you realise that your outside the area served by the top end
MUX.

Why don't you get a second-hand Sky box and the free card and get on
with watching BBC 4 and stop annoying us poor usenet readers?.

FWIW BBC 4 is fine here in Cambridge, in the service area!..

they don't keep taking it off the air either!....

I have a similar problem. They are sending out some sort of control signal
that makes my VCR record the wrong channel, or record at the wrong time, or
even run out of tape. Once they caused a power cut that plunged the whole
area into darkness just to stop me recording something.

If you drive around with ladders on your roof for years and years you will
inevitably end up trying to get cats down from trees. Believe me it's a
mug's game. The cats are invariably ungrateful and the owners act as if you
are a free service provided by the council.

Twice in 40 years I've had to climb in though a bedroom window to turn off
the gas under the chip pan, the householder having left it on whilst nipping
out and forgetting to put the yale on the sneck.
