I know that some mobile phone places will pay off the end of your existing
contract if you enter a new deal with them. Anyone know which companies do
this? I know I've seen an advert somewhere but cant think where or who was
advertising!!

what you ask for is effectively a form of cash back and according to a
recent (You and Yours?) programme certain companies have signed up users but
did not end the original contract ( check the terms and conditions in your
contract ) leaving the user liable for charges for both phones  with no way
of reclaiming.If you listen to the clip you will hear how sympathetic Orange
are.

He isn't asking about cashback con-tracts!  Read what he is asking about,
not what you want to give an answer to.
I also remember some companies that would pay whatever your existing
contract rental would cost if you transferred to them.  Vodafone used to
advertise it outside their shops.
Not many of the companies will do it now.
