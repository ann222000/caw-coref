The entire fucking strider attack was made unplayable for me by the
fact that you had to kill the fucking hunters first.

Sorry, I no longer care about how this ends. Logic dict-fucking-tates
that the strider busters should function whether the hunters are there
or not.

They lost me. I don't feel like finishing Ep 2 because I no longer
care about it. Good job, Valve, for the masturbatory bullshit.

Down...........

That bit did my head in. I think I tried for about an hour to get past it and
the best I could manage was losing two buildings. You don't have to kill the
Hunters off first but it sure is easier if you do. What I did was wait till I
was quite close to the Strider and the lob it while quickly switching to the
SMG before the Hunters target it and knock it off. Most of the time it works
but I think I wore out my quickload button while doing it.

I agree.  That end level was so much bullshit.  Why did the hunters target
the bombs?  Why didn't the bombs work unless they hadn't been hit by
anything?  Shouldn't they have worked against the hunters too?

One bit at the end, a hunter was stood there shooting the bombs as they
appeared in the machine - which made it impossible to use them!

The answer is simple if annoying. In much the same way that modern infantry
protect tanks from other infantry with AT gear, the hunters are looking out
for their big brothers. The only bit that didnt make sense to me is why their
weapons fire doesn't set them off like yours does. Perhaps their energy
weapons don't have the same effect as lead.

That must have been annoying! I made a point of using that carrier on the back
of the car but often if I was ramming through the hunters, they would shoot
after me as I passed and destroy the damn thing! Quite possibly the most
annoying level in the entire HL series.

You can't really, you have to take out the hunters by driving into them
(judicious use of your turbo and handbrake are vital) then take out the
striders.

It would be impossible without quicksave - because you would have to throw
your rig from a top floor window in frustration if you have to replay the
whole thing!

Yeah, because there are only a dozen or more dispensers around.  Once you
take out the hunters, the strider practically ignores you while your allies
shoot at it, so your free to go run for the nearest dispenser.  Not to
mention, if you miss the hunters with the car, turn around and try again or
reverse over it.  Even if you hit them at slow speeds, you can still kill
them with one or two good bumps.  I never had one destroy my bomb on the car
while attempting to run them over.

Easy peasy. Well, fairly easy peasy. Normally when a Strider appears,
it's accompanied by 2 Hunters. So drive at full tilt at one, and hit
Turbo just before you hit it; you'll probably kill one outright. Even
if you don't, doesn't matter.

Bail out of the car, and use the Grav Gun to grab a log. Yes a _log_.
They're by far the most effective weapon against the Hunters. (I
presume this is intentional on the part of Valve; they're shrewn all
around the level). Hold it up in front of you to act as a shield while
moving up to a Hunter; it'll block the darts it fires at you. The
darts will eventually explode of course, but if you do it right, you
can hit the Hunter not only with the log, but also time it so the
darts explode at the same time. Two whacks with a log will normally
take one out. When you've done it a few times it's relatively easy.

They never survive two decent speed hits (and you don't even need to use
turbo normally).  Then when I cleared out the hunters I'd run right up close
to the strider with the bomb, and take it out.  And don't worry about the
car, it can take a beating.

Spoiler for the Strider battle

...more

They do.  I took out a Strider with Hunters still around.  Admitted I
probably fluked it cos the Hunters are damn good shots but they somehow
missed this one.

However it really is easiest to just take out the Hunters first.  It
doesn't seem like it but you do have time.  In the first wave and the
first Strider of the second wave use the car to ram them.  After that
they're too close to the base to mess around with the car so leg it
(sprint) and use logs to take out the Hunters.  Two whacks and they're
down.  Stick around the buildings while fighting and there's plenty of
health for between Hunters if you're low.

Yeah, from my standpoint it is you.  I found a really tough to predict arc
on the bomb when I threw it for any distance and missed consistently the few
times I shot from that length before abandoning the strategy.  In fact, most
of the time, I had run over the hunters and quickly exited the car, ran
around to the back of the car to retrieve my bomb and shot the bomb onto the
strider from practically right underneath it.  Then took the bomb out with
the pistol.

But I'm sure there are multiple ways to finish the level...which is what
makes it so cool.

To enabled god modes for HL2 games...

Then, enter in a cheat command (i'm copy/pasting the following from a
walkthrough; this list is *not* exhaustive)...

- Infinite power for your suit: infinite_aux_power
- All weapons and ammo: impulse 101
