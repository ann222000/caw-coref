If you had only a few minutes to evacuate like those down in the SoCal
fire zone, what would you take?  My animals come first, of course. I
have a suitcase by my front door filled with family pictures and other
papers I consider priceless.  There is also a container in that room
with cash I might need during the emergency.

I'm sitting here mentally going through each room to see if anything I
owned was as critical to me as the items I've listed.  Library? Only
books and cat food there. Front bedroom? Nothing. Kitchen and
bathroom? Same thing here, nothing. Back two rooms? In the remaining
minutes, if any, I'd grab this laptop and my diabetes medicines.

So? Do any of you have a plan for a quick evacuation in case of fire,
earthquake, or any other natural disaster?

One of the experts this morning said to grab a utility bill.  It's the
universally accepted form of proof of residence -- better than a
driver's license, which isn't required to be updated if you move.

I'd hope you would grab your diabetes medicine first.  You won't be much use
to your animals if you're in a coma, girl.

If we had as much warning as most of the people in the fire storm, we'd have
our bags packed (clothing, medicines, insurance and financial papers,
medical paperwork, family pictures and flash drives) and the oxygen
equipment ready to go into the car.  We wouldn't wait until the fire was
only a few miles away and the roads blocked, we'd leave as soon as the
danger was made evident (neither of us move very fast any more), and we'd
take pictures of every room before we left.  I can't imagine trying to
remember everything I had to list as inventory.  But, it's my understanding
that many of these houses were in areas that aren't insurable anyway so I
guess that wouldn't matter for those in that area.

Easy for me!

1.  People, obviously.
2.  Cats.
3.  Box of photos and mementos, all together in one spot in the
closet.
4.  Jewelry box.
5.  Two pictures on the wall cross-stitched by my mom.
6.  My degrees, if there's still time left by then.

The rest of it can burn, baby, burn!

Good point about the diabetes meds.  Taking them has become such a
habit that I forget how important they might be.

After reading the posts by Anne and Phyllis, I grabbed a container and
pour  a bunch of the three meds I take into it and stuffed it into the
suitcase...just in case.

Today's prompt in a contest on Writing.com was to write a story about
evacuating after a disaster.  I wrote my story just now, linked  it
below after posting it in my portfolio.

I'm curious. Have I forgotten anything I should have ready for an
emergency?

As far as photos go, now with digital it isn't as much of a concern, as
you can always have family members keep duplicate CDs. My sister in law

Rae, most of the photos in that suitcase were sent to me after Mum

I have three cat carriers, two large and one smaller. They would all
fit in the back of Blue Satyr along with their food and litter box
supplies. Can you imagine the noise they would make?

You might consider having some of those photos put onto cd. That way
you'd have backups. Is there much issue with these wildfires in your
area.

I am just sick at the thought of this gal from our horse boards. Turns
out everything is gone - but one house on the ranch - her horse and
four or five others. I well up every time I think about it.

Our biggest danger is hurricanes, for which, fortunately, we usually have
plenty of advance warning.  We have a fire season, too, but we have a pretty
good safety zone around our home complex, so our plan is to fortify our home
so we will not have to evacuate.  We had a metal roof put on after Hurricane
Wilma, which is the best for hurricanes, and a very good fire prevention.
Before the next hurricane season we will have shutters that are easier to
activate instead of the labor intensive plywood which we definitely need
help to cope with.  We have an internal room that is quite well fortified.
In other words we would NOT evacuate with hurricane warnings.  During Andrew
some of the places that were open suffered more damage than our home.  We
lost a horse with Andrew, and we really have no safe place for them.  The
recommendations are to leave them out, not in the barn, and after Andrew
definitely that was the best advice.  Our barn was destroyed, and so would
the horses have been if they had been in it.

A fire that might start in the house would be disastrous.  Family and
animals come first.  I would grab my laptop.  I make it a point to have
important things on that, or on disks next to it that I could grab in a
hurry.  We have a designated point to meet should we get separated.  I keep
things like insurance policy #s, and information about important papers on
my laptop, and we also have a small fireproof safe where I keep policies.
We are not in a flood zone.  So, picking up the laptop takes all that
information with me.

Lets hope none of us has to put these plans into use.  I'd rather face
Florida's hurricanes than California's fires and earthquakes, but really
there is no place that is completely safe.  Look at the tornados recently in
the upper mid west!

I think of it often, but as of right now - run is pretty much it. I
know what I would like to grab, but getting things organized just
doesn't present itself very often. I hope to get more accomplished in
that arena now that my baby is already almost 2 years old and is
starting to be able to play while I take on a project. I have a
storage room full of foodstuffs/water/batteries, etc. though for any
emergency that keeps us at home, and I have a bin on the ready for
tornado warnings, but I don't have all of my things that would sadden
me to lose, other than my family of course.

Sue, I have a gallon of water plus a flashlight in Blue Satyr.  I
still need to add a blanket and some peanut butter and cheese
crackers. When I cleaned out my old Colt before buying this new
Yaris,  I found crackers about 15 years old behind the passenger seat.
Probably stale, so I threw them away.

I scan important old photos to my computer.  I then store them on archival
disks.  I did not know this, and learned it in a class for Photo Shop.  The
average CD is recommended only for storage for a couple of years.  There are
archival disks you can buy that are supposed to be good for something like
at least 50 years.  Only a couple of countries make them, and you will have
to get them over the internet, as most stores don't carry them--though a
high-end photo store might.  The ones I have are made by Delkin Devices
(made in USA!!!!) and are called Archival gold--quoting them, &quot;The 300 Year
Disc.&quot;  They cost a good bit more than regular CDs, but are not
prohibitively expensive--I have forgotten what I paid for them about a year
ago.

Anyway, I thought I would pass this on.  Before I took the class I was not
aware of them, and now anything I want to keep for sure I use these for.  I
am currently working on scanning old pictures and making a disk for the
children.  We have some really interesting old photos I am sure they would
like to have.

I actually have 2 scanners, but one will only scan black and white and is an
&quot;all-in-one.&quot;  My scanner I use for photos is an HP Scanjet 6300C.  I have
had it for several years and do not remember what it cost.  It was a
middle-of-the-line scanner, upper middle, at the time.  It does a beautiful
job and in fact I have scanned some old photos and the copies have come out
better than the originals--don't know how, but they do.

You want a flat-bed scanner.  I personally would go for a good one if you
want to scan old photos, though something in the middle price range is
probably good enough.  Mine also will scan colored slides which is something
to consider if you have a slide collection.  At the time I bought it, the
HP's had the best reputation.  I would have to do some research if I were
going to buy one now, but this one--at least 5 years old, probably
more--works just fine.

Incidentally in the note about the archival disks I meant companies, not
countries.  I have a really bad cold and am not functioning well!

Someone a little more tech oriented than I could give you a better answer.
This one should do the work.  When I bought mine we went into a big computer
store and I looked at print-outs of scanned images.  It was also important
to me that I could scan colored slides, as we had years worth from our
family, and my parents.  This one will not do slides.  If you don't need to
scan slides then that feature is not important.  The price seems so low I
would just wonder if the quality of the finished product would be what I
wanted.  I don't know as things have changed so much since I bought mine,
which I think was well over $100.  Canon is a good name and it seems to be
rated well.  You're not risking that much my trying it.  Mine is AT LEAST 5
or 6 years old.  Anyone out there have more recent experience for Judity?

&gt; I'm thinking of getting this scanner through Amazon.com.

&gt; I only need a scanner since I already own machines that print and
&gt; copy.

&gt; Is this what I need to scan and eventually put my photos and documents
&gt; to a CD?

((If you don't need to
scan slides then that feature is not important. ))

I hadn't even thought of slides. Years ago at a science fiction
convention, I bought dozens of slides of paintings by the artist,
Morris Scott Dollens, along with two of his actual paintings

I'd love to have the slides on a CD where I could look at them instead
of having to dig out my little slide machine.  Thanks for the nudge in
that direction.

&gt;If you had only a few minutes to evacuate like those down in the SoCal
&gt;fire zone, what would you take?  My animals come first, of course. I
&gt;have a suitcase by my front door filled with family pictures and other
&gt;papers I consider priceless.  There is also a container in that room
&gt;with cash I might need during the emergency.

&gt;I'm sitting here mentally going through each room to see if anything I
&gt;owned was as critical to me as the items I've listed.  Library? Only
&gt;books and cat food there. Front bedroom? Nothing. Kitchen and
&gt;bathroom? Same thing here, nothing. Back two rooms? In the remaining
&gt;minutes, if any, I'd grab this laptop and my diabetes medicines.

&gt;So? Do any of you have a plan for a quick evacuation in case of fire,
&gt;earthquake, or any other natural disaster?

Well, you don't get much warning in an earthquake! I can't say we have
any kind of evacuation plan in case of a quake, just a shut-off valve
for the gas line.

My list is pretty much the same as Sandi's. All I'd grab is the stuff
that isn't replaceable. But I was thinking as I looked at pictures of
burned-out cars - I'd probably have my son drive out my 1969 Mustang
and leave the 1988 Corvette behind to burn!
