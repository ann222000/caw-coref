Hi folks,

my partner and I have just purchased a double kayak (Prijon Excursion, w.
rudder).  We did go a bit crazy and forked out for carbon paddles and other
nice gear and have really put some effort into making use of it all.  Soon
we'll begin some overnight touring out of Sydney, Aust.

There are times when I would like the convenience of a smaller craft when on
my own and have considered a surf ski (otherwise known as a wave ski here in
Oz) for training.  I guess my thoughts were to have something which would
fit inside my sedan on the folded front passenger seat, limiting it to about
7 to 8 feet.

This is what I hope to be able to do with such a craft:

- be able to approximate the stroke needed in the kayak to build up
technique/stamina and for general training purposes,
- paddle both flat waters and some smaller surf,
- use existing paddle.

Some have commented that a short surf-ski will be a real pain on flat water
as it will rotate too much under paddling torque.  It has been some time
since I paddled a surf-ski but will give one a go shortly.

Am I hoping for too much here, heading in the *wrong* direction?  Any
thoughts will be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
David E (Sydney)

Surf Ski &lt;&gt; Wave Ski.

Surf skis are long and thin with displacement hulls.

Wave skis are short and fat with planing hulls.

For inside your car, you're definitely talking "Wave Ski" unless you have a
really big car or van and then you might look at the 10' version of Hunt
Johnson's WaveWitch.

I've got the 12' Wave Witch - which is basically a big wave ski with a rudder -
something between a surf ski and a wave ski, but biased towards a wave ski.

Rotation isn't an issue.   Hull speed is the issue.    The diff between an
honest cruising effort and a flat-out sprint is 4.8 mph vs 5.6 mph.   That .8
mph just doesn't satisfy in terms of rewarding more effort with a feeling of
acceleration and more speed.

I've been doing my exercise paddling on the Wave Witch since early spring and
will be going back to a surf ski for that function as soon as I can verify that
some particular make/model actually fits me by paddling it and doing a few
remounts.

I haven't paddled a wave ski yet (got one on order though). Ping me in late Feb.
But I expect it to have significantly less glide than the Wave Witch.

Bottom line for me: the WaveWitch doesn't cut it for glide/speed when paddling
for exercise and I wouldn't expect a wave ski to either.  OTOH either of the two
surf skis I've owned did.

My personal agenda:
----------------------------------------------
- Surf Ski for training and distance paddling
- Wave ski for the waves.
- Wave Witch when I only want to carry one craft and
could go either way wherever I plan to paddle
that day.

Hi Pete,

many thanks for your response.  I guess I've had some dodgy advice and have
had the terms used interchangeably by surf shop salespeople lately.

Certainly it is the wave ski option that I'm considering - my car is not a
Cadillac (or a Hummer)!  Just had a look at the Wave Witch online - I wonder
if/where these are sold here in Oz?  Wonderful little craft.

Sadly, the word here in Australia is that such craft have been in demise
since the mal came back into 'fashion' - older guys (excluding myself of
course...) could now put aside their cumbersome surf/wave skis and opt for
the higher street cred of a mal.  Last week in Port Macquarie (coastal town
in NSW, Aust - noted for its surf community) I could find not a single shop
that didn't ask me "why?" when I made enquiries.

I'll try to remember to ask!

So, not sure where to from here but will try out a few items and will see
what happens!

Again, thanks for your help.

If you live in Australia, I'd say it's pretty much a no-brainer to get a wave
ski.  Even if it doesn't work out for you intended use, I'd think you'd have a
lot of fun with it in the waves.

What's a "mal"?
