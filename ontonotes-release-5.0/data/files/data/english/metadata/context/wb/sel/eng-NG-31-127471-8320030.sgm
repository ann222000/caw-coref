People cannot be intimidated from posting on Usenet by spammers. loonies,
bozos,hateful people and jus plain idiots if they use killfiles to block the
garbage and insanity.

Killfiles can be loaded more quickly and efficiently than bozos can change
identities or make obnoxious postings.

As far as I know, I'm the only member of the Summerlands staff that posts
regularly to alt.religion.druid. The others have better things to do with
their time.

I post here to meet new people; to on the rare occasion discuss matters of
Druid religion and tradition and to not leave a newsgroup that I've served
since before it was founded.

Summerlands is a friendly Celtic Pagan sort of cyber-place. It's not a cult
but it is spiritual and religious.

Everyone who agrees with me is not a member of a cult. Some of these people
have very astute and strong minds.

Everything I post does not have a hidden meaning for the people who are
certain that it does. :-)

I don't think the gods are people or even necessarily human-like, contrary
to what one person goes on and on about. I do think the gods are spirits
that can inhabit bodies or anything else they so desire. They are
shapechangers in that respect but don't have to have a body to effect their
purposes here. In fact, their will is better worked on us from another place
not in this world but that contains this world within it.

I'm not making money off of being here but it would not hurt my feelings or
my principles if I did.

I don't want to be a Druid Pope or an Arch-Druid. I've turned down such
things when offered on many occasions. I do expect to be the master of my
selves and my many skills. I hope to acquire a greater mastery as I continue
doing the work of the Cauldron of Vocation.

I don't read anything by Dan, Dana, Jim or Root if I can help it as they
don't post on subjects that concern actual Druid religion or traditions and
frequently are just baiting me or other people when they do post (but not
always, but I don't really care any more).

I may not post as often to this newsgroup in the near future because I'm
doing some Druid work elsewhere, but I haven't given up on it, am not the
least bit intimidated by anything said to me or about me here, and am not
hiding from anyone. I'm right here in plain sight though I *AM* ignoring
some people.

I was a part of the petition that established this newsgroup in its very
beginnings and I'll not leave it because some people have behavior problems.
I like the idea of Druid religion too much to abandon its newsgroup.

I love alt.religion.druid. It's a part of my life and also a part of the
Druid way whether others know that, like that or want to change that fact.

Alt.religion.druid will prosper because of Druids and it will not fall or
fail because of those who attack it.

Pedant (oh and very true)

There was however a Druid Caste, and they died out (due to whatever
reasons), the producers and the warriors (other main castes) kept
going with the new and not so improved priestly types that came along.

Really now... what have we got so far?
A lad from Noozyland who can tell a Spaniard from a real sword and
then some (yeeeeeeh!), the sweetest Lady on Usenet with a brain, an
English Admiral who is sinking fundie-fanatic ships by will-power alone,
a Welshman who not only knows his stuff but also lives in Wales, some
Swiss dude who has no say in all of this according to majority vote
amongst Anglos and last not least... The Guruine of them all?

In my opinion, people cannot be intimidated from posting on Usenet by
any of the above if they do not choose to be intimidated.
That being said, there are instances of *real* intimidation that include
taking things to real life such as stalking and interfering with jobs
and external to usenet relationships.
That's a different kettle of fish.

I disagree.
I have seen otherwise.
Someone with the intent of disrupting a newsgroup may have the skills
and know-how to flood a group faster than any killfile can keep up.
Newsgroups have died because of trolls of that calibre, please don't
invite trouble like that.
Someone might decide to show up just to prove you wrong.

What you read is your own business. I disagree with your arbitrary
position that what they post on is never of concern to &quot;actual Druid&quot; stuff.
To do so seems to me to say that you are right and they are wrong and
even though you both might discuss the same topics, which has happened,
their opinions on those topics are absolutely incorrect as far as
Druidry goes.

if that's not what you meant, then ok.

That works well for me.
I'd prefer to qualify that a bit though... there was no &quot;Druid Religion&quot;
but there was a religion/spiritual focus that Druids kept/knew.
I think that nowadays Druid is just a shorthand for people who are
trying to follow/live the spiritual focus of those people - who were not
all Druids.
And, I think that people get too wrapped up in shorthand, confusing it
with the meat within the shell... which comes with the turf of labels
and specialization and pigeonholes.

yada yada yada, opinions and all that.

The Brehon Laws are certainly a worthwhile subject of study &amp; I don't think
anyone has ever heard/read me say otherwise.  And individuals can attempt to
follow Brehon Laws if they *choose* to, either singly or in a group that has
made an agreement to that effect.  They do not, however, get to try to
*force* other people to and then ridicule and slander them when they refuse.
Some of us are content with the laws of the countries we're living in and
don't want to resort to some older system that supports things like slavery
&amp; a father having unaccountable power of life and death over his children.
Some of us aren't Irish &amp; don't consider the Brehon Laws as any part of our
heritage.  Some of us have no patience for the xtian or islamist fundies who
wander in here and try to proselytize &amp; are damned if we're gonna put up
with it just because someone calls themselves pagan.

There was never a Druid Religion with a pantheon and prayers/liturgies and
dogma and a hierarchy of clergy standing between &quot;the gods&quot; and everybody
else.  If people want to follow one of these recently-manufactured religions
inaccurately labeled &quot;Druid&quot;, that's their choice, but again--they don't get
to *force* other people to agree with them--or ridicule and slander them
when they refuse.

By all means keep all the old lore--but bear in mind that in being written
down it may have been distorted.  Learning about the mindset of the people
who did the writing will help in discerning where the distortions may occur.

Most of all keep the reverence for the Land and the devotion to living in
balance with Her.  Keep the connection to the Otherworld that every human
has been born with from the beginning of the species &amp; work to strengthen
it.  Keep remembering that everyone is ultimately responsible for their own
path.  Toss anything that gets in the way of this, especially hierarchies &amp;
dogmas &amp; self-styled authorities who demand you do things their way no
matter what.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't read anything by Dan, Dana, Jim or Root if I can help it as they

&gt; I'm confused.  Y'all say we don't need to follow no Brehon laws because
&gt; they are from the olden days but there is no druid religion because in the
&gt; olden days there was no druid religion.  What do we keep from the olden
&gt; days and what do we toss?

&gt; Stacey

Things to keep: Practical stuff. Stuff that needs no bickering n' arguing
over in order to be beneficial. Obvious stuff. Stuff that modern
civilization has tried to supplant with its &quot;new and improved!&quot; version and
obviously failed. Authentic stuff. Stuff which doesn't need fifteen-hundred
pages of footnotes to be real.

Toss?   everything else  :-)

As to &quot;Brehon Law&quot;...
If someone would like to see certain aspects of it make a comeback, they
better get politically active by legitimate means. Write your
congressperson. Form a committee. Start an Internet Movement. Get yerself
elected, so *you* can change the law. Whatever. Most of all, get real. This
role playing BS sure won't cut it and personally, I'd rather subscribe to
the &quot;Law of the Intergalactic Federation&quot; before I would want to do a
voluntary somersault back to the (almost) dark ages.

ICK!

No need to worry about authenticity. I say do what feels good in an
interpretive  free form way.

Nobody knows everything or ever will.  Don't angst too much about finding
the One True Way......because there isn't one.  Find *your* way to what is
Truth (what Kevin calls &quot;firenne&quot;).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's where the self-responsibility comes in, to keep asking questions &amp;
researching, to keep an open mind and maintain as much objectivity as
possible.  And just because a person is participating in something founded
on a fallacy doesn't mean they can't learn valuable lessons.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How do you tell what is authentic in this day and age?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Ask yourself.
&gt;&gt;&gt;That's all there is to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Dan

&gt;&gt; What if I don't know?  Or ask myself and in reality I am wrong?

&gt; Nobody knows everything or ever will.  Don't angst too much about finding
&gt; the One True Way......because there isn't one.  Find *your* way to what is
&gt; Truth (what Kevin calls &quot;firenne&quot;).

&gt;&gt;For example
&gt;&gt; there are lots of folks out there who are wiccan who think what they are
&gt;&gt; practicing is authentic and ancient.

&gt; That's where the self-responsibility comes in, to keep asking questions &amp;
&gt; researching, to keep an open mind and maintain as much objectivity as
&gt; possible.  And just because a person is participating in something founded
&gt; on a fallacy doesn't mean they can't learn valuable lessons.

My idea of core druidry are the seasonal grove rituals. There are basic
universal elements of ritual construction.

Once the ritual outline i.e. progression is remembered no script is
necessary as the thought/intent is all that counts.

The specifics for any given occasion are just inserted in the middle and one
must if they can insert the proper props, players, food and drink.

Ask permission of the local spirits of place as you commence and thank them
when done and put out food and libation offerings for them afterwards.

Hmm! Well, I'm not overly keen on the expression 'druid religion'. One
couldn't say that there was a single pagan Celtic religion; rather there was
a multiplicity of them, each one being the religion of their tribe. OK, one
might argue that these religions had something in common, in the same way
that their cultures had common elements by virtue of cultural contact
through trade (both short distance and long distance), clientship and so on.

Then again, one can say exactly the same thing about the Greeks - each
city-state had its own religion, although the Greeks had in idea of
Greekness (itself the result of the Persian Wars and the comparison between
their cultural similarities and the Other) and subscribed to a common
cosmological framework that revolved around a common set of gods and heroes,
plus a common set (relatively speaking) of cultural values. Aegean culture
seems to have emerged as a result of convergent evolution and acculturation
mediated by trade so that a common culture and language emerged *before*
there was a sense of 'Greekness' - the idea of 'Greekness' versus the
barbarian is absent from, for example, the Odyssey. It required the threat
of a culture that did not conform to 'Greek' cultural norms to crystallise
the idea of being Greek, and then only by opposition to the barbarian. That
was Athens' contribution. One might note that later Greeks used the idea of
'Greekness' to claim that some Greeks (them) were more Greek that other
Greeks (whoever they had a down on).

A similar mechanism - i.e. cultural similarities and a common language
developing through trade and other forms of contact - have been proposed for
meso-America and, interestingly, for the emergence of Germanic languages. In
the latter case it has been proposed that this developed from a trading
culture centred on the Baltic.In short, cultural similarity precedes an
overall ethnic identity, which may not develop until the culture bangs into
another unrelated culture and survives it. This doesn't mean that common or
similar institutions aren't in the process of developing - in the ancient
world religion and trade were intertwined, since the gods were taken as
witnesses to contracts. A certain degree of similarity is helpful in such
cases - then again, prolonged trade contact might well drive convergence in
this field.

Now you could argue that the 'Celts' were in the same position as the Greeks
were before the Persian wars. As I remarked in my dissertation, if the
Greeks hadn't taken up writing, we might now have Hellenosceptics arguing
that there were no such thing as 'Greeks'! :-) After all, you have a
multiplicity of city-state religions, different burial customs, no overall
centralised structure, and even the existence of Greeks for whom the polis
was not the natural basis of organisation. :-) How on earth could there be a
pan-Greek identity? :-)

There's plenty of mechanisms for acculturation between Celtic-speaking
peoples - including trade - over very long distances. You could therefore
argue with some justification that, over wide areas, individual tribal
religions would have elements in common. Some awareness of the cultural
similarities between themselves and the differences between them and the
Greeks and the Romans was probably there, though this does not mean that
there was a pan-Celtic identity nor does it mean that there was one Celtic
religion, anymore than there was one Greek religion. If you like, you could
say that there were many variations (but then there are those
Celtic-speaking cultures that were further away from Mediterranean
influences).

Of course, how the everyday person thought about religious ideas, and how
the druids thought about them are two entirely different things. One might
compare and contrast the perspectives of the average Hindu and the Brahmins.
Given the possibility of  common religious framework over wide areas,
chances are that druids from different tribes might have developed broadly
similar abstract ways of thinking about things - this does not however
constitute a druid religion, anymore than you can talk about a Brahmin
religion. In fact given that the notion of firenne gets in the way of
developing dogma (not to mention the love of ambiguity), it is difficult to
see how one could have one overall 'druid religion'. The Colloquy of the Two
Sages, by contrast, would suggest the possibility of many different
understandings of a common framework, but that's more like philosophy
(itself originally a religious pursuit) than religion.

Now OK, you might be able to use the term 'druid religion' as a shorthand
expression of a multiplicity of different abstract understandings based on a
common religious framework, or relatively common religious and cultural
frameworks. However, the term is also open to misunderstanding.

As for the Brehon laws. Hmm! Well, speaking logically, folks may chose to
follow them personally, but they are not part of a recognised modern legal
system and they are unenforceable if someone chooses not to follow them. Nor
would modern courts accept them as a defence if they led you to break the
established secular law. I can imagine the reaction of a court (and the
young lady) if someone claimed that they were now married to a woman by
virtue of abducting her. :-)

Though they are purely Irish, it is not unlikely that other Celtic speaking
areas had something similar. As I recall, the laws of Hywel Dda are a mix of
Late Roman law with indigenous law - there is some evidence of indigenous
law still operating under the Empire, the only requirement being that it
agreed in the important particulars with Imperial law. Perhaps that might be
a good model to follow. :-)

On the various specifics I've seen mentioned recently, I can't recall
anything, anywhere, from the law codes that says that an Irish druid can't
be satirised. Come to that, there's nothing to say that a file can't be
satirised either. In fact satire was a just response for the failure of a
party. To argue that no one from outside Ireland could satirise a druid or
file would be to argue that Irish druids and filidh were always in the
right - and the stories suggest otherwise. Whilst an outsider's honour price
might be lower - though not always, since they might be a client of a king,
or even the 'client' of a god (and you try paying the eric of a god!) - they
were still due their honour price if wronged. If that wasn't forthcoming,
satire might be an appropriate response. Mind you, the law codes were
largely concerned with matters internal to Ireland, so they don't discuss
the matter specifically - but the logic of the codes as a whole would lead
me to conclude that an Irish druid or file could indeed be satirised by
someone from outside Ireland under circumstances where the Irish person had
wronged the outsider.

Secondly, you're not allowed to be a bystander. In principal I agree with
this. However, neither should it be used to argue that all and sundry should
join in on one side or the other. When you just have several people shouting
at each other, you can pretty much presume that each party will consider
themselves wronged, and that you'll be getting a biased view from all
involved, no matter who is in the right. Of course in some cases, none of
them may be entirely in the right (or even in the right in any sense at
all), and each is worse than the other. :-) One might, for example,
postulate a situation where several robbers fell out over dividing the
spoils of their robbery, and each justifying the reasons why they betrayed
or attacked the other by saying that they were in the right.

If you are aware of the rights and wrongs of the matter then sure, make your
judgement and chose a course of action. If you're not - well, that's why you
have a brain. You head is for more than simply keeping your hat on. You find
out what facts you can and, taking into account things like culpability,
form a judgement. Having assessed the situation, you then decide what, if
anything, you should do about it.

Of course, there's the whole question of 'joining in'. If the whole venture
is ill-wished, then you'll be doing no good service by joining in. I'm
minded of a woman I knew once, years ago, who got beaten up by her then
boyfriend whilst he was drunk. She knew that he was somewhat impressed by
me - well, frightened might be nearer the mark - so she asked me to put the
frighteners on him to ensure that he didn't do it again. I refused. She
asked why. I pointed out that the fact that she'd asked me meant that she
was pretty sure that it was going to happen again. Sure, I could frighten
the guy whilst he was sober - he was not however a problem whilst sober. He
was, OTOH, likely to have the potential consequences slip his mind whilst
drunk, start on her, remember half way through, and then hit her harder so
that she didn't tell me. The whole notion was ill-wished. A better course of
action, since she was obviously sure he'd do it again, was to dump him and
find somewhere else to live. If she wanted to do that - well, there's the
couch. She could put up till she got

&gt;&gt; I'm confused.  Y'all say we don't need to follow no Brehon laws because
&gt;&gt; they are
&gt;&gt; from the olden days but there is no druid religion because in the olden
&gt;&gt; days
&gt;&gt; there was no druid religion.  What do we keep from the olden days and what
&gt;&gt; do we
&gt;&gt; toss?

&gt;&gt; Stacey

&gt; The Brehon Laws are certainly a worthwhile subject of study &amp; I don't think
&gt; anyone has ever heard/read me say otherwise.  And individuals can attempt to
&gt; follow Brehon Laws if they *choose* to, either singly or in a group that has
&gt; made an agreement to that effect.  They do not, however, get to try to
&gt; *force* other people to and then ridicule and slander them when they refuse.
&gt; Some of us are content with the laws of the countries we're living in and
&gt; don't want to resort to some older system that supports things like slavery
&gt; &amp; a father having unaccountable power of life and death over his children.
&gt; Some of us aren't Irish &amp; don't consider the Brehon Laws as any part of our
&gt; heritage.  Some of us have no patience for the xtian or islamist fundies who
&gt; wander in here and try to proselytize &amp; are damned if we're gonna put up
&gt; with it just because someone calls themselves pagan.

&gt; There was never a Druid Religion with a pantheon and prayers/liturgies and
&gt; dogma and a hierarchy of clergy standing between &quot;the gods&quot; and everybody
&gt; else.  If people want to follow one of these recently-manufactured religions
&gt; inaccurately labeled &quot;Druid&quot;, that's their choice, but again--they don't get
&gt; to *force* other people to agree with them--or ridicule and slander them
&gt; when they refuse.

&gt; By all means keep all the old lore--but bear in mind that in being written
&gt; down it may have been distorted.  Learning about the mindset of the people
&gt; who did the writing will help in discerning where the distortions may occur.

&gt; Most of all keep the reverence for the Land and the devotion to living in
&gt; balance with Her.  Keep the connection to the Otherworld that every human
&gt; has been born with from the beginning of the species &amp; work to strengthen
&gt; it.  Keep remembering that everyone is ultimately responsible for their own
&gt; path.  Toss anything that gets in the way of this, especially hierarchies &amp;
&gt; dogmas &amp; self-styled authorities who demand you do things their way no
&gt; matter what.

Find the spirit within the rules, the writings, the tales, the
practices, and follow that.

Wise words.

And listen with your heart - when you ask permission, wait until you're
sure the answer isn't no. And if it is no, move on to where you're welcome.

sorry for butting in there, White Plastic Elder, Sir... I see folk
assume that just 'cause their heart is in the right place, everything's
cool.
Respect is as important an element as love.
In my opinion.

&gt;&gt;&gt; what do we
&gt;&gt;&gt; toss?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Stacey

&gt;&gt; The Brehon Laws are certainly a worthwhile subject of study &amp; I don't
&gt;&gt; think anyone has ever heard/read me say otherwise.  And individuals can
&gt;&gt; attempt to follow Brehon Laws if they *choose* to, either singly or in a
&gt;&gt; group that has made an agreement to that effect.  They do not, however,
&gt;&gt; get to try to *force* other people to and then ridicule and slander them
&gt;&gt; when they refuse. Some of us are content with the laws of the countries
&gt;&gt; we're living in and don't want to resort to some older system that
&gt;&gt; supports things like slavery &amp; a father having unaccountable power of
&gt;&gt; life and death over his children. Some of us aren't Irish &amp; don't
&gt;&gt; consider the Brehon Laws as any part of our heritage.  Some of us have no
&gt;&gt; patience for the xtian or islamist fundies who wander in here and try to
&gt;&gt; proselytize &amp; are damned if we're gonna put up with it just because
&gt;&gt; someone calls themselves pagan.

&gt;&gt; There was never a Druid Religion with a pantheon and prayers/liturgies
&gt;&gt; and dogma and a hierarchy of clergy standing between &quot;the gods&quot; and
&gt;&gt; everybody else.  If people want to follow one of these
&gt;&gt; recently-manufactured religions inaccurately labeled &quot;Druid&quot;, that's
&gt;&gt; their choice, but again--they don't get to *force* other people to agree
&gt;&gt; with them--or ridicule and slander them when they refuse.

&gt;&gt; By all means keep all the old lore--but bear in mind that in being
&gt;&gt; written down it may have been distorted.  Learning about the mindset of
&gt;&gt; the people who did the writing will help in discerning where the
&gt;&gt; distortions may occur.

&gt;&gt; Most of all keep the reverence for the Land and the devotion to living in
&gt;&gt; balance with Her.  Keep the connection to the Otherworld that every human
&gt;&gt; has been born with from the beginning of the species &amp; work to strengthen
&gt;&gt; it.  Keep remembering that everyone is ultimately responsible for their
&gt;&gt; own path.  Toss anything that gets in the way of this, especially
&gt;&gt; hierarchies &amp; dogmas &amp; self-styled authorities who demand you do things
&gt;&gt; their way no matter what.

&gt;&gt; Dana

&gt; Find the spirit within the rules, the writings, the tales, the practices,
&gt; and follow that.

&gt; L.
&gt; (who thinks Stacey already does that, and is merely saying what feels like
&gt; the bottom line)

No argument whatsoever.....just writing for the larger audience as usual

&gt; I don't think the gods are people or even necessarily human-like, contrary

&gt; I don't want to be a Druid Pope or an Arch-Druid. I've turned down such

&gt; I may not post as often to this newsgroup in the near future because I'm
&gt; doing some Druid work elsewhere, but I haven't given up on it, am not the

&gt; I was a part of the petition that established this newsgroup in its very

&gt; I like the idea of Druid religion too much to abandon its newsgroup.

There is much merit in this. I have reservations but the spirit of
this sharing should encourage and support those who seek the truth.

But

the Internet is not the same as sitting around a fire - the tone,
pause and all the other things that happen when people speak cannot be
replaced by a virtual media. It is my hope that the spirit of what
Searles has said is seen as a positive sharing. Sit around a real

There is a need for compassion on this forum.

It may be that compassion is the measure of a true druid.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Toss?   everything else  :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As to &quot;Brehon Law&quot;...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If someone would like to see certain aspects of it make a comeback,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better get politically active by legitimate means. Write your

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elected, so *you* can change the law. Whatever. Most of all, get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; real.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; role playing BS sure won't cut it and personally, I'd rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subscribe to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the &quot;Law of the Intergalactic Federation&quot; before I would want to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; voluntary somersault back to the (almost) dark ages.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ICK!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dan

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How do you tell what is authentic in this day and age?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ask yourself.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's all there is to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dan

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What if I don't know?  Or ask myself and in reality I am wrong?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Nobody knows everything or ever will.  Don't angst too much about
&gt;&gt;&gt; finding the One True Way......because there isn't one.  Find *your* way
&gt;&gt;&gt; to what is Truth (what Kevin calls &quot;firenne&quot;).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For example
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there are lots of folks out there who are wiccan who think what they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; practicing is authentic and ancient.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's where the self-responsibility comes in, to keep asking questions
&gt;&gt;&gt; &amp; researching, to keep an open mind and maintain as much objectivity as
&gt;&gt;&gt; possible.  And just because a person is participating in something
&gt;&gt;&gt; founded on a fallacy doesn't mean they can't learn valuable lessons.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dana

&gt;&gt; My idea of core druidry are the seasonal grove rituals. There are basic
&gt;&gt; universal elements of ritual construction.

&gt;&gt; Once the ritual outline i.e. progression is remembered no script is
&gt;&gt; necessary as the thought/intent is all that counts.

&gt;&gt; The specifics for any given occasion are just inserted in the middle and
&gt;&gt; one must if they can insert the proper props, players, food and drink.

&gt;&gt; Ask permission of the local spirits of place as you commence and thank
&gt;&gt; them when done and put out food and libation offerings for them
&gt;&gt; afterwards.

&gt;&gt; White Plastic Elder

&gt; Wise words.

&gt; And listen with your heart - when you ask permission, wait until you're
&gt; sure the answer isn't no. And if it is no, move on to where you're
&gt; welcome.

&gt; sorry for butting in there, White Plastic Elder, Sir... I see folk assume
&gt; that just 'cause their heart is in the right place, everything's cool.
&gt; Respect is as important an element as love.
&gt; In my opinion.

I have been told no by the spirits of a particular place many times. I
consider it an honor for the spirits to be kind enough to tell me to go
learn some more or get my act togther. When they say no, at least they are
listening. That in itself to me is a rich experience.

Here in this country they are not comfortable with the ways of another land.

This is why I gravitate to a pantheistic approach. I work to gain the
support of the many types of local nature spirits. This can be achieved by
avoiding thinking or discussing forign supposed gods.

The gods and goddesses of say Ireland, match the energy of that land and are
best worked with there.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; don't post on subjects that concern actual Druid religion.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Dearest Charlie, if you can see me beyond the veil of your killfile:

&gt; &gt;&gt;THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A 'DRUID RELIGION', AND THERE NEVER WAS.

&gt; &gt;&gt;golwg

&gt; &gt;&gt;Matthew

&gt; &gt; I'm confused.  Y'all say we don't need to follow no Brehon laws because
&gt; &gt; they are
&gt; &gt; from the olden days but there is no druid religion because in the olden
&gt; &gt; days
&gt; &gt; there was no druid religion.  What do we keep from the olden days and what
&gt; &gt; do we
&gt; &gt; toss?

&gt; Hmm! Well, I'm not overly keen on the expression 'druid religion'. One
&gt; couldn't say that there was a single pagan Celtic religion; rather there was
&gt; a multiplicity of them, each one being the religion of their tribe. OK, one
&gt; might argue that these religions had something in common, in the same way
&gt; that their cultures had common elements by virtue of cultural contact
&gt; through trade (both short distance and long distance), clientship and so on.

&gt; Then again, one can say exactly the same thing about the Greeks - each
&gt; city-state had its own religion, although the Greeks had in idea of
&gt; Greekness (itself the result of the Persian Wars and the comparison between
&gt; their cultural similarities and the Other) and subscribed to a common
&gt; cosmological framework that revolved around a common set of gods and heroes,
&gt; plus a common set (relatively speaking) of cultural values. Aegean culture
&gt; seems to have emerged as a result of convergent evolution and acculturation
&gt; mediated by trade so that a common culture and language emerged *before*
&gt; there was a sense of 'Greekness' - the idea of 'Greekness' versus the
&gt; barbarian is absent from, for example, the Odyssey. It required the threat
&gt; of a culture that did not conform to 'Greek' cultural norms to crystallise
&gt; the idea of being Greek, and then only by opposition to the barbarian. That
&gt; was Athens' contribution. One might note that later Greeks used the idea of
&gt; 'Greekness' to claim that some Greeks (them) were more Greek that other
&gt; Greeks (whoever they had a down on).

&gt; A similar mechanism - i.e. cultural similarities and a common language
&gt; developing through trade and other forms of contact - have been proposed for
&gt; meso-America and, interestingly, for the emergence of Germanic languages. In
&gt; the latter case it has been proposed that this developed from a trading
&gt; culture centred on the Baltic.In short, cultural similarity precedes an
&gt; overall ethnic identity, which may not develop until the culture bangs into
&gt; another unrelated culture and survives it. This doesn't mean that common or
&gt; similar institutions aren't in the process of developing - in the ancient
&gt; world religion and trade were intertwined, since the gods were taken as
&gt; witnesses to contracts. A certain degree of similarity is helpful in such
&gt; cases - then again, prolonged trade contact might well drive convergence in
&gt; this field.

&gt; Now you could argue that the 'Celts' were in the same position as the Greeks
&gt; were before the Persian wars. As I remarked in my dissertation, if the
&gt; Greeks hadn't taken up writing, we might now have Hellenosceptics arguing
&gt; that there were no such thing as 'Greeks'! :-) After all, you have a
&gt; multiplicity of city-state religions, different burial customs, no overall
&gt; centralised structure, and even the existence of Greeks for whom the polis
&gt; was not the natural basis of organisation. :-) How on earth could there be a
&gt; pan-Greek identity? :-)

&gt; There's plenty of mechanisms for acculturation between Celtic-speaking
&gt; peoples - including trade - over very long distances. You could therefore
&gt; argue with some justification that, over wide areas, individual tribal
&gt; religions would have elements in common. Some awareness of the cultural
&gt; similarities between themselves and the differences between them and the
&gt; Greeks and the Romans was probably there, though this does not mean that
&gt; there was a pan-Celtic identity nor does it mean that there was one Celtic
&gt; religion, anymore than there was one Greek religion. If you like, you could
&gt; say that there were many variations (but then there are those
&gt; Celtic-speaking cultures that were further away from Mediterranean
&gt; influences).

&gt; Of course, how the everyday person thought about religious ideas, and how
&gt; the druids thought about them are two entirely different things. One might
&gt; compare and contrast the perspectives of the average Hindu and the Brahmins.
&gt; Given the possibility of  common religious framework over wide areas,
&gt; chances are that druids from different tribes might have developed broadly
&gt; similar abstract ways of thinking about things - this does not however
&gt; constitute a druid religion, anymore than you can talk about a Brahmin
&gt; religion. In fact given that the notion of firenne gets in the way of
&gt; developing dogma (not to mention the love of ambiguity), it is difficult to
&gt; see how one could have one overall 'druid religion'. The Colloquy of the Two
&gt; Sages, by contrast, would suggest the possibility of many different
&gt; understandings of a common framework, but that's more like philosophy
&gt; (itself originally a religious pursuit) than religion.

&gt; Now OK, you might be able to use the term 'druid religion' as a shorthand
&gt; expression of a multiplicity of different abstract understandings based on a
&gt; common religious framework, or relatively common religious and cultural
&gt; frameworks. However, the term is also open to misunderstanding.

&gt; As for the Brehon laws. Hmm! Well, speaking logically, folks may chose to
&gt; follow them personally, but they are not part of a recognised modern legal
&gt; system and they are unenforceable if someone chooses not to follow them. Nor
&gt; would modern courts accept them as a defence if they led you to break the
&gt; established secular law. I can imagine the reaction of a court (and the
&gt; young lady) if someone claimed that they were now married to a woman by
&gt; virtue of abducting her. :-)

&gt; Though they are purely Irish, it is not unlikely that other Celtic speaking
&gt; areas had something similar. As I recall, the laws of Hywel Dda are a mix of
&gt; Late Roman law with indigenous law - there is some evidence of indigenous
&gt; law still operating under the Empire, the only requirement being that it
&gt; agreed in the important particulars with Imperial law. Perhaps that might be
&gt; a good model to follow. :-)

&gt; On the various specifics I've seen mentioned recently, I can't recall
&gt; anything, anywhere, from the law codes that says that an Irish druid can't
&gt; be satirised. Come to that, there's nothing to say that a file can't be
&gt; satirised either. In fact satire was a just response for the failure of a
&gt; party. To argue that no one from outside Ireland could satirise a druid or
&gt; file would be to argue that Irish druids and filidh were always in the
&gt; right - and the stories suggest otherwise. Whilst an outsider's honour price
&gt; might be lower - though not always, since they might be a client of a king,
&gt; or even the 'client' of a god (and you try paying the eric of a god!) - they
&gt; were still due their honour price if wronged. If that wasn't forthcoming,
&gt; satire might be an appropriate response. Mind you, the law codes were
&gt; largely concerned with matters internal to Ireland, so they don't discuss
&gt; the matter specifically - but the logic of the codes as a whole would lead
&gt; me to conclude that an Irish druid or file could indeed be satirised by
&gt; someone from outside Ireland under circumstances where the Irish person had
&gt; wronged the outsider.

&gt; Secondly, you're not allowed to be a bystander. In principal I agree with
&gt; this. However, neither should it be used to argue that all and sundry should
&gt; join in on one side or the other. When you just have several people shouting
&gt; at each other, you can pretty much presume that each party will consider
&gt; themselves wronged, and that you'll be getting a biased view from all
&gt; involved, no matter who is in the right. Of course in some cases, none of
&gt; them may be entirely in the right (or even in the right in any sense at
&gt; all), and each is worse than the other. :-) One might, for example,
&gt; postulate a situation where several robbers fell out over dividing the
&gt; spoils of their robbery, and each justifying the reasons why they betrayed
&gt; or attacked the other by saying that they were in the right.

&gt; If you are aware of the rights and wrongs of the matter then sure, make your
&gt; judgement and chose a course of action. If you're not - well, that's why you
&gt; have a brain. You head is for more than simply keeping your hat on. You find
&gt; out what facts you can and, taking into account things like culpability,
&gt; form a judgement. Having assessed the situation, you then decide what, if
&gt; anything, you should do about it.

&gt; Of course, there's the whole question of 'joining in'. If the whole venture
&gt; is ill-wished, then you'll be doing no good service by joining in. I'm
&gt; minded of a woman I knew once, years ago, who got beaten up by her then
&gt; boyfriend whilst he was drunk. She knew that he was somewhat impressed by
&gt; me - well, frightened might be nearer the mark - so she asked me to put the
&gt; frighteners on him to ensure that he didn't do it again. I refused. She
&gt; asked why. I pointed out that the fact that she'd asked me meant that she
&gt; was pretty sure that it was going to happen again. Sure, I could frighten
&gt; the guy whilst he was sober - he was not however a problem whilst sober. He
&gt; was, OTOH, likely to have the potential consequences slip his mind whilst
&gt; drunk, start on her, remember half way through, and then hit her harder so
&gt; that she didn't tell me.

&gt; &gt; Killfiles can be loaded more quickly and efficiently than bozos can change
&gt; &gt; identities or make obnoxious postings.

&gt; &gt; As far as I know, I'm the only member of the Summerlands staff that posts
&gt; &gt; regularly to alt.religion.druid. The others have better things to do with
&gt; &gt; their time.

&gt; &gt; I post here to meet new people; to on the rare occasion discuss matters of
&gt; &gt; Druid religion and tradition and to not leave a newsgroup that I've served
&gt; &gt; since before it was founded.

&gt; &gt; Summerlands is a friendly Celtic Pagan sort of cyber-place. It's not a cult
&gt; &gt; but it is spiritual and religious.

&gt; &gt; Everyone who agrees with me is not a member of a cult. Some of these people
&gt; &gt; have very astute and strong minds.

&gt; &gt; Everything I post does not have a hidden meaning for the people who are
&gt; &gt; certain that it does. :-)

&gt; &gt; I don't think the gods are people or even necessarily human-like, contrary
&gt; &gt; to what one person goes on and on about. I do think the gods are spirits
&gt; &gt; that can inhabit bodies or anything else they so desire. They are
&gt; &gt; shapechangers in that respect but don't have to have a body to effect their
&gt; &gt; purposes here. In fact, their will is better worked on us from another place
&gt; &gt; not in this world but that contains this world within it.

&gt; &gt; I'm not making money off of being here but it would not hurt my feelings or
&gt; &gt; my principles if I did.

&gt; &gt; I don't want to be a Druid Pope or an Arch-Druid. I've turned down such
&gt; &gt; things when offered on many occasions. I do expect to be the master of my
&gt; &gt; selves and my many skills. I hope to acquire a greater mastery as I continue
&gt; &gt; doing the work of the Cauldron of Vocation.

&gt; &gt; I don't read anything by Dan, Dana, Jim or Root if I can help it as they
&gt; &gt; don't post on subjects that concern actual Druid religion or traditions and
&gt; &gt; frequently are just baiting me or other people when they do post (but not
&gt; &gt; always, but I don't really care any more).

&gt; &gt; I may not post as often to this newsgroup in the near future because I'm
&gt; &gt; doing some Druid work elsewhere, but I haven't given up on it, am not the
&gt; &gt; least bit intimidated by anything said to me or about me here, and am not
&gt; &gt; hiding from anyone. I'm right here in plain sight though I *AM* ignoring
&gt; &gt; some people.

&gt; &gt; I was a part of the petition that established this newsgroup in its very
&gt; &gt; beginnings and I'll not leave it because some people have behavior problems.
&gt; &gt; I like the idea of Druid religion too much to abandon its newsgroup.

&gt; &gt; I love alt.religion.druid. It's a part of my life and also a part of the
&gt; &gt; Druid way whether others know that, like that or want to change that fact.

&gt; &gt; Alt.religion.druid will prosper because of Druids and it will not fall or
&gt; &gt; fail because of those who attack it.

&gt; &gt; Is mise le meas,

&gt; &gt; Searles O'Dubhain

&gt; There is much merit in this. I have reservations but the spirit of
&gt; this sharing should encourage and support those who seek the truth.

&gt; But

&gt; the Internet is not the same as sitting around a fire - the tone,
&gt; pause and all the other things that happen when people speak cannot be
&gt; replaced by a virtual media. It is my hope that the spirit of what
&gt; Searles has said is seen as a positive sharing. Sit around a real
&gt; fire. Share love and try to see the inner truth of any person who
&gt; shares their truth.

&gt; There is a need for compassion on this forum.

&gt; It may be that compassion is the measure of a true druid.

Again, do you have an historical reference for that? By the 7th century the
filidh have become the sole inheritors of the rights and privileges of the
druids so they would have inherited that right as well. Druids, on the other
hand, disappear from law codes after the 8th or 9th century. Indeed one
could make a reasonable academic argument that the two groups were
essentially the same, that the process was one of evolution rather than
replacement, and that in fact the term 'druid' had changed by the 8th or 9th
century, as language always changes, to mean, more or less, sorcerer or
magician, rather than the far more complex role seen in earlier times.

As support for this, one might note that the law codes stipulate health care
for an 8th century druid based on relative status. Whilst this would have
meant a reduction in status for one of the elite to be what was meant by
'druid' in the 8th century, it would have been a step up in status for
someone below the rank of bo-aire. It would thus have been a suitable step
up in status for someone of a lower status to be known for their magic, and
thus as a druid. Or to put it another way, it would have been a reduction in
status for a file to break ranks and use magic that way, whilst it would
have been an increase in status for non-filidh to do so.

On balance, I'd suspect the law was largely to control what the filidh and
their students got up to, and not for the first time in Irish history. OTOH,
no one was too fussed about magical practitioners from the lower orders, as
long as their activities were covered by the codes, particularly by codes
concerning status. Issues of status were of big concern to ancient Irish
jurisprudence.

Consequently, whilst the members of the elite group known in former times as
druids (as well as poets and brehons) were evolving into the filidh, the
term 'druid' was coming to mean someone from a very different group who was
simply known for using magic, before effectively becoming obsolete
altogether prior to the later Revival druids. None of which is at all
surprising - Gildas uses the Latin 'magi' (sing. magus) to describe the
probable British equivalent of druids in the courts of 6th century kings
such as Maelgwn Gwynedd.

&gt;&gt; long as their activities were covered by the codes, particularly by codes
&gt;&gt; concerning status. Issues of status were of big concern to ancient Irish
&gt;&gt; jurisprudence.

&gt;&gt; Consequently, whilst the members of the elite group known in former times
&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt; druids (as well as poets and brehons) were evolving into the filidh, the
&gt;&gt; term 'druid' was coming to mean someone from a very different group who
&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt; simply known for using magic, before effectively becoming obsolete
&gt;&gt; altogether prior to the later Revival druids. None of which is at all
&gt;&gt; surprising - Gildas uses the Latin 'magi' (sing. magus) to describe the
&gt;&gt; probable British equivalent of druids in the courts of 6th century kings
&gt;&gt; such as Maelgwn Gwynedd.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Shall I come and starve outside your doors?

&gt;&gt; If you feel you must. Do it quietly though.

What a schoolboy knows is irrelevant. Some schoolboys know that Santa exists
and that the Tooth Fairy leaves money under their pillow.

Now cite an academic reference - there must be one if every schoolboy knows
it, so you can cite a schoolbook - otherwise it is unsupported opinion only,
and worthy of no more consideration than a belief in the Easter Bunny.

In practice, all that punishment by banishment requires is the power to
enforce it. I doubt the paramilitaries include many druids. I suppose that
you could always tell them that they were contravening ancient Irish law,
leastways as you understand it. I doubt that they would be impressed.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; On the various specifics I've seen mentioned recently, I can't recall
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; anything, anywhere, from the law codes that says that an Irish druid
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be satirised. Come to that, there's nothing to say that a file can't be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; satirised either. In fact satire was a just response for the failure of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; party. To argue that no one from outside Ireland could satirise a druid
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; file would be to argue that Irish druids and filidh were always in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; right - and the stories suggest otherwise. Whilst an outsider's honour
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; price
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; might be lower - though not always, since they might be a client of a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; king,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; or even the 'client' of a god (and you try paying the eric of a god!) -
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; were still due their honour price if wronged. If that wasn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; forthcoming,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; satire might be an appropriate response. Mind you, the law codes were
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; largely concerned with matters internal to Ireland, so they don't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; discuss
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the matter specifically - but the logic of the codes as a whole would
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lead
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; me to conclude that an Irish druid or file could indeed be satirised by
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; someone from outside Ireland under circumstances where the Irish person
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; had
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wronged the outsider.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;An Irish person may not be satirised by any person without the Land of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Ireland.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you have an historical reference for that? Something by Fergus Kelly
&gt; &gt;&gt; for
&gt; &gt;&gt; example? A quote from the Senchus Mor or other law codes? Because without
&gt; &gt;&gt; actual factual support - as in a reference to a particular law code - as
&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; its historicity and its existence in what was, after all, codified
&gt; &gt;&gt; customary
&gt; &gt;&gt; law, it is merely opinion and therefore has no customary, traditional or
&gt; &gt;&gt; historical standing.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Of course banishment was considered the worst punishment of all, worse
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;than
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;death. A banished
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;person was, anyway, dead, to all intents and purposes. Only a Druid for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that task
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;appointed, could banish, not a Filidh.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Again, do you have an historical reference for that? By the 7th century
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; filidh have become the sole inheritors of the rights and privileges of
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; druids so they would have inherited that right as well. Druids, on the
&gt; &gt;&gt; other
&gt; &gt;&gt; hand, disappear from law codes after the 8th or 9th century. Indeed one
&gt; &gt;&gt; could make a reasonable academic argument that the two groups were
&gt; &gt;&gt; essentially the same, that the process was one of evolution rather than
&gt; &gt;&gt; replacement, and that in fact the term 'druid' had changed by the 8th or
&gt; &gt;&gt; 9th
&gt; &gt;&gt; century, as language always changes, to mean, more or less, sorcerer or
&gt; &gt;&gt; magician, rather than the far more complex role seen in earlier times.

&gt; &gt;&gt; As support for this, one might note that the law codes stipulate health
&gt; &gt;&gt; care
&gt; &gt;&gt; for an 8th century druid based on relative status. Whilst this would have
&gt; &gt;&gt; meant a reduction in status for one of the elite to be what was meant by
&gt; &gt;&gt; 'druid' in the 8th century, it would have been a step up in status for
&gt; &gt;&gt; someone below the rank of bo-aire. It would thus have been a suitable
&gt; &gt;&gt; step
&gt; &gt;&gt; up in status for someone of a lower status to be known for their magic,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; thus as a druid. Or to put it another way, it would have been a reduction
&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt; &gt;&gt; status for a file to break ranks and use magic that way, whilst it would
&gt; &gt;&gt; have been an increase in status for non-filidh to do so.

&gt; &gt;&gt; On balance, I'd suspect the law was largely to control what the filidh
&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; their students got up to, and not for the first time in Irish history.
&gt; &gt;&gt; OTOH,
&gt; &gt;&gt; no one was too fussed about magical practitioners from the lower orders,
&gt; &gt;&gt; as
&gt; &gt;&gt; long as their activities were covered by the codes, particularly by codes
&gt; &gt;&gt; concerning status. Issues of status were of big concern to ancient Irish

&gt;&gt;&gt; My idea of core druidry are the seasonal grove rituals. There are basic

&gt;&gt;&gt; Once the ritual outline i.e. progression is remembered no script is

&gt;&gt;&gt; The specifics for any given occasion are just inserted in the middle and
&gt;&gt;&gt; one must if they can insert the proper props, players, food and drink.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ask permission of the local spirits of place as you commence and thank

I think that love and respect are bound together.
Unfortunately some folk don't see it that way.
They think that love has to do with possessing and respect doesn't need
to go any deeper than the surface.
The way I see it, loving the Earth and Respecting Spirit of Place is a
joint-venture.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stacey

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Things to keep: Practical stuff. Stuff that needs no bickering n' arguing

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;civilization has tried to supplant with its &quot;new and improved!&quot; version

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Toss?   everything else  :-)

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;As to &quot;Brehon Law&quot;...
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;If someone would like to see certain aspects of it make a comeback, they
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;better get politically active by legitimate means. Write your

&gt; &gt; I post here to meet new people; to on the rare occasion discuss matters of
&gt; &gt; Druid religion and tradition and to not leave a newsgroup that I've served
&gt; &gt; since before it was founded.

&gt; &gt; Summerlands is a friendly Celtic Pagan sort of cyber-place. It's not a cult
&gt; &gt; but it is spiritual and religious.

&gt; &gt; Everyone who agrees with me is not a member of a cult. Some of these people
&gt; &gt; have very astute and strong minds.

&gt; &gt; Everything I post does not have a hidden meaning for the people who are
&gt; &gt; certain that it does. :-)

&gt; &gt; I don't think the gods are people or even necessarily human-like, contrary
&gt; &gt; to what one person goes on and on about. I do think the gods are spirits
&gt; &gt; that can inhabit bodies or anything else they so desire. They are
&gt; &gt; shapechangers in that respect but don't have to have a body to effect their
&gt; &gt; purposes here. In fact, their will is better worked on us from another place
&gt; &gt; not in this world but that contains this world within it.

&gt; &gt; I'm not making money off of being here but it would not hurt my feelings or
&gt; &gt; my principles if I did.

&gt; &gt; I don't want to be a Druid Pope or an Arch-Druid. I've turned down such
&gt; &gt; things when offered on many occasions. I do expect to be the master of my
&gt; &gt; selves and my many skills. I hope to acquire a greater mastery as I continue
&gt; &gt; doing the work of the Cauldron of Vocation.

&gt; &gt; I don't read anything by Dan, Dana, Jim or Root if I can help it as they
&gt; &gt; don't post on subjects that concern actual Druid religion or traditions and
&gt; &gt; frequently are just baiting me or other people when they do post (but not
&gt; &gt; always, but I don't really care any more).

&gt; &gt; I may not post as often to this newsgroup in the near future because I'm
&gt; &gt; doing some Druid work elsewhere, but I haven't given up on it, am not the
&gt; &gt; least bit intimidated by anything said to me or about me here, and am not
&gt; &gt; hiding from anyone. I'm right here in plain sight though I *AM* ignoring
&gt; &gt; some people.

&gt; &gt; I was a part of the petition that established this newsgroup in its very
&gt; &gt; beginnings and I'll not leave it because some people have behavior problems.
&gt; &gt; I like the idea of Druid religion too much to abandon its newsgroup.

&gt; &gt; I love alt.religion.druid. It's a part of my life and also a part of the
&gt; &gt; Druid way whether others know that, like that or want to change that fact.

&gt; &gt; Alt.religion.druid will prosper because of Druids and it will not fall or
&gt; &gt; fail because of those who attack it.

&gt; &gt; Is mise le meas,

&gt; &gt; Searles O'Dubhain

&gt; There is much merit in this. I have reservations but the spirit of
&gt; this sharing should encourage and support those who seek the truth.

&gt; But

&gt; the Internet is not the same as sitting around a fire - the tone,
&gt; pause and all the other things that happen when people speak cannot be
&gt; replaced by a virtual media. It is my hope that the spirit of what
&gt; Searles has said is seen as a positive sharing. Sit around a real
&gt; fire. Share love and try to see the inner truth of any person who

&gt; There is a need for compassion on this forum.

Dear Stacey.

We keep the truth from the religion of Druids. That is their knowledge with
the three forms of understanding that clarifies it.  Every person can of
course find their own way through these truths into knowledge and religion,
even those who have no religion.

Only those who fear clear thinking and open understanding fear religion.

&gt; Hmm! Well, I'm not overly keen on the expression 'druid religion'. One
&gt; couldn't say that there was a single pagan Celtic religion; rather there
&gt; was a multiplicity of them, each one being the religion of their tribe.
&gt; OK, one might argue that these religions had something in common, in the
&gt; same way that their cultures had common elements by virtue of cultural
&gt; contact through trade (both short distance and long distance), clientship
&gt; and so on.

&gt; Then again, one can say exactly the same thing about the Greeks - each
&gt; city-state had its own religion, although the Greeks had in idea of
&gt; Greekness (itself the result of the Persian Wars and the comparison
&gt; between their cultural similarities and the Other) and subscribed to a
&gt; common cosmological framework that revolved around a common set of gods
&gt; and heroes, plus a common set (relatively speaking) of cultural values.
&gt; Aegean culture seems to have emerged as a result of convergent evolution
&gt; and acculturation mediated by trade so that a common culture and language
&gt; emerged *before* there was a sense of 'Greekness' - the idea of
&gt; 'Greekness' versus the barbarian is absent from, for example, the Odyssey.
&gt; It required the threat of a culture that did not conform to 'Greek'
&gt; cultural norms to crystallise the idea of being Greek, and then only by
&gt; opposition to the barbarian. That was Athens' contribution. One might note
&gt; that later Greeks used the idea of 'Greekness' to claim that some Greeks
&gt; (them) were more Greek that other Greeks (whoever they had a down on).

&gt; A similar mechanism - i.e. cultural similarities and a common language
&gt; developing through trade and other forms of contact - have been proposed
&gt; for meso-America and, interestingly, for the emergence of Germanic
&gt; languages. In the latter case it has been proposed that this developed
&gt; from a trading culture centred on the Baltic.In short, cultural similarity
&gt; precedes an overall ethnic identity, which may not develop until the
&gt; culture bangs into another unrelated culture and survives it. This doesn't
&gt; mean that common or similar institutions aren't in the process of
&gt; developing - in the ancient world religion and trade were intertwined,
&gt; since the gods were taken as witnesses to contracts. A certain degree of
&gt; similarity is helpful in such cases - then again, prolonged trade contact
&gt; might well drive convergence in this field.

&gt; Now you could argue that the 'Celts' were in the same position as the
&gt; Greeks were before the Persian wars. As I remarked in my dissertation, if
&gt; the Greeks hadn't taken up writing, we might now have Hellenosceptics
&gt; arguing that there were no such thing as 'Greeks'! :-) After all, you have
&gt; a multiplicity of city-state religions, different burial customs, no
&gt; overall centralised structure, and even the existence of Greeks for whom
&gt; the polis was not the natural basis of organisation. :-) How on earth
&gt; could there be a pan-Greek identity? :-)

&gt; There's plenty of mechanisms for acculturation between Celtic-speaking
&gt; peoples - including trade - over very long distances. You could therefore
&gt; argue with some justification that, over wide areas, individual tribal
&gt; religions would have elements in common. Some awareness of the cultural
&gt; similarities between themselves and the differences between them and the
&gt; Greeks and the Romans was probably there, though this does not mean that
&gt; there was a pan-Celtic identity nor does it mean that there was one Celtic
&gt; religion, anymore than there was one Greek religion. If you like, you
&gt; could say that there were many variations (but then there are those
&gt; Celtic-speaking cultures that were further away from Mediterranean
&gt; influences).

&gt; Of course, how the everyday person thought about religious ideas, and how
&gt; the druids thought about them are two entirely different things. One might
&gt; compare and contrast the perspectives of the average Hindu and the
&gt; Brahmins. Given the possibility of  common religious framework over wide
&gt; areas, chances are that druids from different tribes might have developed
&gt; broadly similar abstract ways of thinking about things - this does not
&gt; however constitute a druid religion, anymore than you can talk about a
&gt; Brahmin religion. In fact given that the notion of firenne gets in the way
&gt; of developing dogma (not to mention the love of ambiguity), it is
&gt; difficult to see how one could have one overall 'druid religion'. The
&gt; Colloquy of the Two Sages, by contrast, would suggest the possibility of
&gt; many different understandings of a common framework, but that's more like
&gt; philosophy (itself originally a religious pursuit) than religion.

&gt; Now OK, you might be able to use the term 'druid religion' as a shorthand
&gt; expression of a multiplicity of different abstract understandings based on
&gt; a common religious framework, or relatively common religious and cultural
&gt; frameworks. However, the term is also open to misunderstanding.

&gt; As for the Brehon laws. Hmm! Well, speaking logically, folks may chose to
&gt; follow them personally, but they are not part of a recognised modern legal
&gt; system and they are unenforceable if someone chooses not to follow them.
&gt; Nor would modern courts accept them as a defence if they led you to break
&gt; the established secular law. I can imagine the reaction of a court (and
&gt; the young lady) if someone claimed that they were now married to a woman
&gt; by virtue of abducting her. :-)

&gt; Though they are purely Irish, it is not unlikely that other Celtic
&gt; speaking areas had something similar. As I recall, the laws of Hywel Dda
&gt; are a mix of Late Roman law with indigenous law - there is some evidence
&gt; of indigenous law still operating under the Empire, the only requirement
&gt; being that it agreed in the important particulars with Imperial law.
&gt; Perhaps that might be a good model to follow. :-)

&gt; On the various specifics I've seen mentioned recently, I can't recall
&gt; anything, anywhere, from the law codes that says that an Irish druid can't
&gt; be satirised. Come to that, there's nothing to say that a file can't be
&gt; satirised either. In fact satire was a just response for the failure of a
&gt; party. To argue that no one from outside Ireland could satirise a druid or
&gt; file would be to argue that Irish druids and filidh were always in the
&gt; right - and the stories suggest otherwise. Whilst an outsider's honour
&gt; price might be lower - though not always, since they might be a client of
&gt; a king, or even the 'client' of a god (and you try paying the eric of a
&gt; god!) - they were still due their honour price if wronged. If that wasn't
&gt; forthcoming, satire might be an appropriate response. Mind you, the law
&gt; codes were largely concerned with matters internal to Ireland, so they
&gt; don't discuss the matter specifically - but the logic of the codes as a
&gt; whole would lead me to conclude that an Irish druid or file could indeed
&gt; be satirised by someone from outside Ireland under circumstances where the
&gt; Irish person had wronged the outsider.

&gt; Secondly, you're not allowed to be a bystander. In principal I agree with
&gt; this. However, neither should it be used to argue that all and sundry
&gt; should join in on one side or the other. When you just have several people
&gt; shouting at each other, you can pretty much presume that each party will
&gt; consider themselves wronged, and that you'll be getting a biased view from
&gt; all involved, no matter who is in the right. Of course in some cases, none
&gt; of them may be entirely in the right (or even in the right in any sense at
&gt; all), and each is worse than the other. :-) One might, for example,
&gt; postulate a situation where several robbers fell out over dividing the
&gt; spoils of their robbery, and each justifying the reasons why they betrayed
&gt; or attacked the other by saying that they were in the right.

&gt; If you are aware of the rights and wrongs of the matter then sure, make
&gt; your judgement and chose a course of action. If you're not - well, that's
&gt; why you have a brain. You head is for more than simply keeping your hat
&gt; on. You find out what facts you can and, taking into account things like
&gt; culpability, form a judgement. Having assessed the situation, you then
&gt; decide what, if anything, you should do about it.

&gt; Of course, there's the whole question of 'joining in'. If the whole
&gt; venture is ill-wished, then you'll be doing no good service by joining in.
&gt; I'm minded of a woman I knew once, years ago, who got beaten up by her
&gt; then boyfriend whilst he was drunk. She knew that he was somewhat
&gt; impressed by me - well, frightened might be nearer the mark - so she asked
&gt; me to put the frighteners on him to ensure that he didn't do it again. I
&gt; refused. She asked why. I pointed out that the fact that she'd asked me
&gt; meant that she was pretty sure that it was going to happen again. Sure, I
&gt; could frighten the guy whilst he was sober - he was not however a problem
&gt; whilst sober. He was, OTOH, likely to have the

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't read anything by Dan, Dana, Jim or Root if I can help it as
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; don't post on subjects that concern actual Druid religion.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Dearest Charlie, if you can see me beyond the veil of your killfile:

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A 'DRUID RELIGION', AND THERE NEVER WAS.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;golwg

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Matthew

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm confused.  Y'all say we don't need to follow no Brehon laws because
&gt;&gt;&gt;they are
&gt;&gt;&gt; from the olden days but there is no druid religion because in the olden
&gt;&gt;&gt; days
&gt;&gt;&gt;there was no druid religion.  What do we keep from the olden days and
&gt;&gt;&gt;what do we
&gt;&gt;&gt; toss?

&gt;&gt;'Brehon Law' used to exist, 'Druid Religion' did not.
&gt;&gt;We use what is useful, we ignore the rest, but keep it safe, just in
&gt;&gt;case...

&gt;&gt;golwg

&gt;&gt;Matthew

&gt; Isn't that kind of arbitrary?

Some people fearto go down that road as it has presented them with problems
in the life they've chosen for themselves. This fear does not invalidate
religion, deity or spirit. It is the energy that drives conventional
behavior and its coin is disbelief in anything that is not accepted widely.
