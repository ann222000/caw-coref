After ten years, Jerusalem had yielded no career and no man. It was time to
go to the city of intense dating.

After ten years in Israel, in Jerusalem no less, where the air gave off a
white light that was suffused with a kind of holiness, I left and moved back to
the United States. The whole time, I'd been studying and teaching Torah. I
hadn't read an American newspaper or seen a movie (except for E.T.), let alone
television, in ten years. After pickling in Jewishness in Jerusalem -- the food,
the politics, the religion, the people -- I sought out the most Jewish place I
could find outside of Israel: Hassidic Boro Park.
When I stepped onto the El-Al plane, I felt like someone had ripped out my
insides. Before I left, a rabbi had told me: The good, geshmak feeling you get
from walking the streets of Israel, that's comparable to the pleasant feeling
you get from a Shabbat in America. The soul-brimming-over high you get from
Shabbat in Israel -- that compares to Yom Kippur in America. As for the spiritual
high of Yom Kippur in Israel? For that no counterpart exists in America.
So why was I leaving? I loved it but I was going nowhere. After ten years,
Jerusalem had yielded no career and no man. It was time to go to New York, the
city of intense dating. I also hoped to get my MFA in fiction. Maybe America
still was the land of opportunity.
Back in the U.S.A, so much had changed in the last ten years. The cars'
windshields looked different, very postmodern. Store doors kept opening
magnetically when I least expected them to, as my arms would grope the air in front of
me, utterly befuddled at the technological advances that had occurred in my
absence. When I confided to a friend that I didn't know who Indira Gandhi was, she
ordered me to read the New York Times, cover to cover, for the next six
weeks.       I could tell people pitied me. I had no real job, no husband, and I
obviously didn't know how to dress in this community.
I was disoriented. Every time I entered a bank, I'd reach to kiss the
non-existent mezuzah on the doorpost. Communism had collapsed and I had barely taken
notice. My friends from yeshiva high school had gone on to become actuaries,
psychologists, editors, teachers and physical therapists. Many of them were now
married with children. But, I brightly reminded myself, I could decipher
scores of medieval Biblical commentaries, and was so well-versed in the intricate
laws of keeping kosher that I could take over any mashgiach's job in a
restaurant. Yet somehow I didn't think these skills would amount to much, even here,
in the most Jewish of towns, Boro Park.
I could tell people pitied me. I had no real job, no husband, and I obviously
didn't know how to dress in this community, for soon after my arrival in
Brooklyn, a friend kindly took me aside and explained: The clothes you wear every
day in America, are those you wear for Shabbat in Israel. The clothes you wear
for Shabbat in America -- you wear for a wedding in Israel. As for weddings
in America, there's no such equivalent in Israel. &quot;What about the clothes I
wore every day in Israel?&quot; I asked. &quot;Those clothes?&quot; she said. A look of
consternation furrowed her forehead as she puzzled that one. &quot;Ah.&quot; Her face relaxed
and she answered, &quot;Those are the clothes you take out the garbage or clean
with.&quot;
Shortly after, my sister &quot;encouraged&quot; me to throw out my Birkenstocks and
nowhere skirts that she said looked like appliance covers, and took me to buy --
yech -- suits, straight, black, synthetic blend skirts and pointy-toed shoes.
Thanks to her, I blended in with the New York natives. Still, I felt like a
greenhorn. Upon entering a Shop Rite, I'd instinctively show the fruit guy or
the store manager the contents of my purse to check for bombs. They gave me the
oddest looks. I walked down the aisles, pushing my cart along, trying to blend
in, and it seemed that a tension and sweetness had been sucked out of the
atmosphere, leaving only the stale stuff behind, especially when I recalled the
spiritually charged air of Jerusalem. There was no buzz here. I didn't feel
God's presence one whit. I tried to adjust.
Meanwhile I had to pay the bills and had no time to get my MFA. I took a job
as a residence manager of a home for the developmentally disabled and was in
over my head. There was no way I could make peace between the Polish cleaners,
the Hungarian cook and the Jamaican caregivers, not to mention a few other
warring nationalities.
As I sat in a crowded Boro Park synagogue on a particular Shabbat in June,
all my misery came crashing down on me. I knew absolutely no one in that shul
and the tunes and prayers failed to move me. Here, too, I couldn't intuit God's
presence. I couldn't help feeling angry. No potential man or MFA could justify
this vapid existence. Added to my loneliness, I had a new roommate who was a
lovely person, but something wasn't clicking. (The old roommate I loved, but
her basement apartment was a decrepit mess and it was unbearable.)
Brooklyn was darkest exile to me, and for lack of imagination, I blamed it all on
God.
There in the Boro Park synagogue, I reached a low point. I never should've
left Israel. Brooklyn was darkest exile to me, and for lack of imagination, I
blamed it all on God.
During the haftorah reading, the women began talking animatedly to each
other. Was this some Hassidic custom I didn't know about? If so, I hated it, and it
didn't help that I had no one to talk to myself. Suddenly I put down my
prayer book and exited the synagogue.
I walked down the street, shocked at myself. I'd never left in the middle of
prayers before and it seemed sacrilegious. My face was wet and I couldn't tell
if it was from tears or from the fact that it had just started raining. Where
was I supposed to go? Back to my new, polite roommate in her immaculate
apartment? At that moment a thought crossed my mind that had never surfaced before:
I wanted to die. I even might have said it out loud, softly: God, let me die.

I stumbled along in the rain, turning down this street and up that one, not
knowing where to go. The rain came down harder. I passed a bunch of
black-knickered Hassidic children playing in a front yard, oblivious to the rain. I
decided to take refuge under a huge oak tree, at least 50 feet high. There, I
watched the children play tag, running, dodging, side-curls wet against their
cheeks. Now and then they stopped to stare gravely at me as I stood under the oak.
Even these small children knew I was a misfit who didn't belong. The rain
intensified, the children ran indoors, and I stood protected under the oak tree.
Even though I wanted to die, I still didn't want to get wet.
My thoughts frightened me. How could I want to die? Was life really that bad?
Was I truly depressed -- or just displaced? The questions were giving me a
headache. I stood under the tree and watched the early summer rain falling.
I stood five, ten, fifteen minutes, and I began to grow attached to that
towering oak tree, with its profuse, leafy overhang. My back and limbs seemed to
draw strength from the trunk's knots and whorls. This was my spot. I'm never
leaving here, I told myself, even after the rain had subsided a bit. I thought
of the prophet Jonah, how he'd been wandering dejectedly in the broiling
desert, asking to die, grieving after God had favored Ninveh's penance. God made a
gourd-like plant grow overhead to protect him from the elements. When a worm
ate up the plant, the prophet in his distress again asked to die. And God said
in effect, &quot;Is that all it takes?&quot; God's words in essence reduced Jonah's
existential despair to -- a tantrum.
I stared up at the canopy of thick branches overhead. The rain had stopped. I
felt a little better. I realized that I too had no real wish to die and was
mostly having a tantrum. My self-pity and grandiosity were a little much.
Things in America weren't going as well as I would've liked, and I would have to be
more mature about it, I supposed. Certainly there were steps I could take to
make a viable spiritual life here. I could move to a more suitable
neighborhood. And there was no reason I couldn't go for my MFA in the evening at Brooklyn
College.
Now, looking around me, Boro Park looked kind of pretty, all watery and
green. Across the street I noticed a short, burly Hassid making his way down the
sidewalk. He cast a surprised look at me there under the tree then turned his
gaze away. I decided I'd visit my old roommate who lived a few blocks down 15th
Avenue. Why hadn't I thought of that earlier? I pushed myself off the tree and
began walking energetically down the street.       I had taken about ten
steps when I heard a sharp, cracking noise.
I had taken about ten steps when I heard a sharp, cracking noise. I turned
and looked back at my tree, at my spot. A huge branch, as thick as a man's
torso, had severed itself from the top of the tree, and I watched it come tumbling
down, crashing through the foliage, like a giraffe falling off a cliff. It hit
the spot where I'd been standing less than half a minute ago. I stood still
as a stone. I couldn't move. This didn't really happen, I said to myself. Uh
uh. I'm imagining this.
I lifted my eyes and saw the short Hassid across the street stopped in his
tracks. His eyes looked stunned. He just stood there, staring, his hands at his
side, his palms outward. He'd seen me standing under the tree and now he'd
seen the branch falling down from at least 50 feet high. If I hadn't moved just
then I would've been crushed by it. We looked at each other across 15th Avenue.
He cupped his hands around his mouth. &quot;You have to bentsch gomel!&quot; he shouted
at me.
Dazed, I nodded. He was saying I had to recite the blessing for deliverance,
for somebody who had experienced a personal miracle. This surely counted as
one, and I roused myself from my shock, and continued on my way. I felt like I'd
received both a smack and an embrace, God's judgment and love intertwined. As
if God had heard my words and said, &quot;Don't ever ask to die. I just might take
you up on it.&quot; As if He'd judged me and I'd passed muster, but just barely. I
heard that, and, &quot;No, I'm not letting you die, Ruchama. Not yet. You still
have some things you need to accomplish. I've got plans for you.&quot; I felt like I
was overhearing God's thoughts about me.
It was the most extraordinary feeling. God was saying, I care enough to move
a tree branch out of your way. God was intervening in my life intimately, even
though I was living in chutz l'aretz. I felt the presence of God even though
I was no longer living in Israel.
I had to tell my old roommate. The Hassid had been my witness but now if I
didn't tell someone; it would be as if it had never happened. I was spooked. I
began to run, almost slipping in a patch of rainwater. I ran faster. And now
something really strange started to happen. As I rushed past, balcony doors
began sliding open and children ran out onto their porches. The Hassidic children
were waving at me as I flew past, smiling at me. Balcony doors were opening up
the entire avenue, or so it seemed at the time, though perhaps it was just
four or five doors. As dismal and unwelcoming Boro Park had seemed, now the
place had transformed, washed by the rain, the children beckoning to me with waves
and smiles. It was like I was seeing the soul of Boro Park. If I could adjust
my vision, godliness could be discerned in most places. It was harder outside
of Jerusalem but not impossible. Perhaps I would make it in America after
all. I kept running.
I reached my old roommate's apartment. I pounded on the basement door until
she opened it. I fell into her arms and sobbed out my story. An hour later we
went to the actual site and examined the tree branch, as if to verify it had
really fallen. Part lay on the grass, part on the sidewalk, and Boro Parkers
stepped around it, giving it a wide berth, as if the dead branch might rise with
reptilian cunning and snap them into pieces.
The next day it was gone, the flattened grass the only reminder. Later I
checked out whether indeed I was required to recite the blessing for miracles and
deliverance. Technically, as it turned out, I wasn't required, but what did it
matter? I had experienced my own private miracle.
A week later I pointed out the tree to a guy I had started seeing. He was
properly impressed. But my true satisfaction came years later, when, passing
through Boro Park, I introduced my husband and children to the tree on 15th
Avenue. Together, we made a L'Chaim.
