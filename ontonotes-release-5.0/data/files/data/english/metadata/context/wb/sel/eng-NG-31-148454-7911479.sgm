Transformers (2007)

A long time ago, far away on the planet of Cybertron, a war was being waged
between the noble Autobots (led by the wise Optimus Prime) and the devious
Decepticons (commanded by the dreaded Megatron) for control over the
Allspark, a mystical talisman that would grant unlimited power to whoever
possessed it. The Autobots managed to smuggle the Allspark off the planet,
but Megatron blasted off in search of it. He eventually tracked it to the
planet of Earth (circa 1850), but his reckless desire for power sent him
right into the Arctic Ocean, and the sheer cold forced him into a paralyzed
state. His body was later found by Captain Archibald Witwicky, and before
going into a comatose state Megatron used the last of his energy to engrave
a map, showing the location of the Allspark, into the Captain's glasses, and
send a transmission to Cybertron. He is then carted away by the Captain's
ship. A century later, Sam Witwicky, nicknamed Spike by his friends, buys
his first car. To his shock, he discovers it to be Bumblebee, an Autobot in
disguise who is to protect Spike, as he bears the Captain's glasses and the
map carved on them. But Bumblebee is not the only Transformer to have
arrived on Earth - in the desert of Qatar, the Decepticons Blackout and
Scorponok attack a U.S. Military base, causing the Pentagon to send their
special Sector Seven agents to capture all _specimens of this alien race,_
and Spike and his girlfriend Mikaela find themselves in the middle of a
grand battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons, stretching from
Hoover Dam all the way to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, within the depths of the
Pentagon, the cryogenically stored form of Megatron awakens
