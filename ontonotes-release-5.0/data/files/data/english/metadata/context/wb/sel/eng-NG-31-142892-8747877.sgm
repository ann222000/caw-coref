It's a really good movie.  This girl I like recommended it to me, and
I wasn't thinking about watching it before that.  I'm not really a
racist but I saw an SNL sketch where the main character had his girl
on a chain, and it looked like he was keeping her in his dungeon.
That ain't what the movie is about at all, and I think it has got to
be the best movie of the year.  I hope it wins an award, but most
people are probably like me and don't go out to even watch it unless
someone recommends it.  The movie doesn't really remind me of my real
life, because it is more like a modern day fantasy that deals with
drama.  People probably don't ever wind up in situations that mixed
up.  Keeps you entertained throughout, and has a happy ending.  I
don't like half the movies out there that try to keep you on the edge
of your seat &amp; don't have a plot.  So for a movie I thought looked
like a porno, the story line really had a moral and made you think.

While I was watching it, I was just working on a new idea I had.
About 7 months ago I decided I wanted to put an implant into my hand,
but I couldn't find a way to do it.  I attempted to cut open my skin
with a razor, and put in some steel balls that were magnetic.  I
couldn't even get one of these tiny balls into my hand.  Then
yesterday my cigarette burned my finger, and it blistered up. I heal
really fast, but before the boil went down I had to pop the blister &amp;
let all the puss come out.  It has healed up really naturally, 'cause
I haven't picked at it.  But I think that this method seems like the
best way to implant something into my hand.  Just give myself a good
burn, and after draining the juice out of the blister, slide it into
an opening in the fleshy scar left over.

I'm going to be like magneto.  These little steel balls can keep
magnets stuck on my palm, and the back of my hand.  I already have a
few quarters with magnets in them, so it will be a great little
trick.  Really isn't much of a point in it though, because a trick
like that won't take you to vegas.

Really good movie though, even if my mind was somewhere else.

It's a San-Francisco-based industrial band which existed before the movie
came out:

http://www.blacksnakemoan.com/

(Guitarist Aki Sasaki participates in the SF Goth e-list.)

It's also a blues song written in 1927; the band got its name from the song,
so they don't have rights to the name &quot;Black Snake Moan.&quot; Here's what the
bandleader has to say about the movie:

======================================================================

ABOUT THE MOVIE: Black Snake Moan

Due to the large number of emails, phone calls and letters we have received
about the upcoming film entitled Black Snake Moan, I wanted to take the
opportunity to make a few things clear. Simply put, no one is suing anybody.
You cannot actually place a copyright upon a title. Even if you could, the
title Black Snake Moan is actually taken from the blues song, &quot;That Black
Snake Moan #1,&quot; written in the 1920's by the now deceased country blues
artist, Blind Lemon Jefferson. Lemon was a blues genius, on par with Robert
Johnson, and I highly recommend listening to his work for yourself.

Beyond that, I started the band in 1997, and our first album as Black Snake
Moan was copy written in 1999. So for what it's worth, we stole it first.

After contacting the filmmakers at Paramount Vantage Pictures, we were
invited to submit some of our music for possible inclusion in the film's
soundtrack. After doing so, we did not get a response. That's the short
version. Suffice it to say, we are a band; they are making a film. It is
unlikely that anyone will confuse the one with the other. Moreover, if you
know anything about us, you know that one thing we are not, is a blues band.

To the curious, we are currently rehearsing in preparartion for our next
album. We invite you to take a look around, and hope you enjoy what you see
and hear.

With deepest respect to Papa Lemon and all of our musical forebears, thank
you for watching and listening.

Paige Lawrence
Founder, Black Snake Moan
Est. 1997 - San Francisco, CA

Really?  You tried this?  Then show us the scar.  And show us your implants
when you try the blister method.  And while you're at it, hold the
pseudoscope in front of the scar when you take the picture.

If you don't show us everyone will know it's BULLSHIT!

Since this is supposed to be a magic group, most anybody here could do that
without implants.  But I'll withhold judgment for now.

If you want to use this to produce magical effects, why would you put it on

There are kids who have died from magnets being swallowed. Possibly it
would have no ill affects being implanted but have you checked on
that? I just do not want to see you get sick from them.

I am not one to say you should not do it as I tried to brand myself
once by heating up a sun necklace I have to red hot.

I am one to tell you though what you think in your head to be a good

Yeah, I've read that magnetic implants can possibly be quite
dangerous.  I don't think I'll get sick from it though.  The magnet is

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seemed like a good place.  I'm going to do the front as well.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are kids who have died from magnets being swallowed. Possibly it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would have no ill affects being implanted but have you checked on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that? I just do not want to see you get sick from them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not one to say you should not do it as I tried to brand myself
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once by heating up a sun necklace I have to red hot.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  I am one to tell you though what you think in your head to be a good
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; idea does not always go from brain cells to reality with the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; results. Mine came out looking like an amoeba.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I've read that magnetic implants can possibly be quite
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dangerous.  I don't think I'll get sick from it though.  The magnet is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too small.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Human life is very resilient.  You can suck on a magnet all day long &amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; it won't kill you, and some people have lead bullets lodged in them
&gt; &gt; &gt; that are doing fine.  I don' think its that big a deal.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; Okay, but, why would you suck on a magnet all day?

&gt; Yeah, maybe there is a risk, but it is freaking cool.  At least now I
&gt; have a little something nobody else does.  Just look at me in this
&gt; youtube video:
