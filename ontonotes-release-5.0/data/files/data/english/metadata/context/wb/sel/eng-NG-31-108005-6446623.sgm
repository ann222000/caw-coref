OK, so what I had planned didn't work.  Rats.  The cute Winnie the Pooh
satin binding looks like crap on the Winnie the Pooh quilt.  So . . .  I'm
going to bring the blue flannel to the front for binding.  Easy-peasy, as
NZL would say,  NOT!!  What exactly do I do with the corners?  They are just
too bulky to stitch.  So, could one of you wizards please enlighten this
beginner? Thanks,

See if you can figure out how to go back to 2/5, Terri.  I've never done the
'backing as binding' but it was discussed quite thoroughly here and that
thread will tell you all you need to know and more.  There were a lot of
wizards contributing.  So sorry the binding didn't look good.  You can bring
the backing around.  Yes you can.  Polly

read messages.  Thanks Polly!!!

TerriLee:
I gave you the book info. In case you can't get to
Library soon, here is a brief description of how to do
a "Wrapped Edge Binding." YMMV!!!!!

- Trim top and batting even.
- Leave the extra backing fabric for now.
- Baste (SM  or Hand) about .25" from edge... all layers.
- Trim backing to about twice what you want for a
finished 'binding.' I make this generous, so I get a
double layer when I fold it up.
- Now it gets a tad tricky. Play with a few scraps to
figure this out. Eat lots of chocolate.
- At the corner, fold the backing up so it creates a
diagonal fold, so the fold is precisely on the
top/batting corner. Press.
- Trim the loose backing fabric corner a bit, so you
have a slant at the corner of the backing; parallel to
that fold.
- Pin the fold, over corner.
- Turn the long side to the width you want. Pin the
side. Repeat all sides.
- Fiddle with those earlier corner folds so they look
like miters in the corners. Pin.
- Check for square corners all around. Stitch.
- Wonder why you didn't take the time to get the book,
which has great pictures and details!!!

Oh, nothing is wrong with the binding itself, I love ready-made satin
binding.  It was a color issue.  When I get the foldover binding done, I'll
post a pic, and you'll be able to see - the colors in the quilt didn't like
the white binding. I hope to finish it tonight, or tomorrow.

Oh, Pat!!  These are great directions.  Thank you so much.  I figured that I
had to fold the corner diagonal, but wasn't sure what to do next.  And I'll
have to look for that book. I very well may own one, since I now have all my
mom's books home and mostly unpacked.
