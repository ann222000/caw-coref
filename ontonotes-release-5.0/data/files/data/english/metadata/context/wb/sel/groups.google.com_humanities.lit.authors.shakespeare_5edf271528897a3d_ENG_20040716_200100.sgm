Stimulated by Bob's thread, &quot;A simple Question No Oxfordian will Answer&quot;,
I've been thinking about evidence in general and how we interpret it. Bob
seems to be asking Oxfordians to distinguish between different kinds of
evidence, and weigh up one kind against another. But that's a problem all by
itself. We'd have to agree on the categories. For example, Diana Price has
done a lot of work on a new kind of evidence involving something called
&quot;explicit terminology&quot;, which she introduces us to when dealing with
Jonson's De Shakespeare Nostrati. Just to remind you, the piece begins as
follows:-

I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an
honour to Shakespeare that in his writing, (whatsoever
he penn'd), he never blotted out line.

Price cautions us, &quot;Nothing in De Shakespeare Nostrati describes a writer&quot;,
and then goes on to say: &quot;When Jonson referred to literary men, he used
explicit terminology&quot;, and quotes him on Beaumont, amongst others, as an
example of what she means by that: &quot;'For writing better I must envy thee'&quot;.
Unfortunately, she didn't give a definition of &quot;explicit terminology&quot; that
would enable us to judge the one quote against the other. I suppose that
must be our job. Now, if you eliminate what is common to both - namely, the
word &quot;writing&quot; (even though it might sound a bit terminologically explicit
to the layman) - it leaves you lining up &quot;better&quot; and &quot;envy&quot; as
terminologically explicit words against &quot;penn'd&quot; and &quot;blotted out&quot; to see
why Beaumont passes the test of terminological explicitness and Shakespeare
fails. And the answer is...well, I'm not sure what the answer is. I'm only
sure that she's sure that Beaumont wins it hands down. &quot;De Shakespeare
Nostrati is devoid of any such *literary* terminology&quot;, she says (her
emphasis). Obviously, though, if &quot;writing&quot; doesn't refer to writing (except
with Beaumont, where it does), it must refer to something else. It leaves us
pondering the knotty question of what kind of activity that opening

&quot;blotted out&quot; constitute *some* kind of terminology, we think - but in what
area of human endeavour? And is it explicit?

Maybe we could do a little collective work on this, similar to what we're
doing on the sonnets - a group effort. Why doesn't some Oxfordian kick off
the match by clarifying this complicated &quot;explicit terminology&quot; thing? But I
doubt Malcrowleyo would want to do it, since there's no bawdy involved, and
Mary Queen of Scots doesn't come into it anywhere. So I think that just
leaves Lynne.

I'm not sure what you're asking, Buff. You'd need another non-Strat to talk
about &quot;explicit terminology.&quot; Diana is not, of course, an Oxfordian; but
let's begin with the whole quote:

I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an honour to
Shakespeare, that in his writing, (whatsoever he penn'd) hee never blotted
out line. My answer hath beene, would he had blotted a thousand. Which they
thought a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity this, but for their
ignorance, who choose that circumstance to commend their friend by, wherein
he most faulted. And to justifie mine owne candor, (for I lov'd the man, and
doe honour his memory (on this side Idolatry) as much as any.) Hee was
(indeed) honest, and of an open, and free nature: had an excellent Phantsie;
brave notions, and gentle expressions: wherein hee flow'd with that
facility, that sometime it was necessary he should be stop'd: Sufflaminandus
erat; as Augustus said of Haterius. His wit was in his owne power; would the
rule of it had beene so too. Many times hee fell into those things, could
not escape laughter: As when hee said in the person of Cæsar, one speaking
to him; Cæsar thou dost me wrong. Hee replyed: Cæsar did never wrong, but
with just cause: and such like; which were ridiculous. But hee redeemed his
vices, with his vertues. There was ever more in him to be praysed, then to
be pardoned.

There are several things that strike me immediately--and God knows I've
looked at this passage enough times and found out the story of Haterius. the
poor unfortunate, etc.

1. Since this is from Timber, a notebook and presumably, at the time it was
written, a private one, we must trust what Jonson says. I imagine it is not
meant to be a public statement, like the folio poem. But I'll be pleased to
stand corrected.

2. I have no idea whom he considers Shakespeare to be in this passage. Many
will presume it is WS of Stratford.

3. Any &quot;writing&quot; such as it is, has been reported by others. The passage
concerns an anecdote that the players have told to Jonson.

4. I can't remember what Diana thinks about it, since it's ages since I've
read her book and ill health intervened, but I find the passage ambiguous.
Like almost any statement about Shakespeare, much of it could mean many
things.

Here is the Beaumont quote in context:

How I doe love thee BEAUMONT, and thy Muse,
That unto me do'st such religion use!
How I doe feare my selfe, that am not worth
The least indulgent thought thy pen drops forth!
At once thou mak'st me happie, and unmak'st;
And giving largely to me, more thou tak'st.
What fate is mine, that so it selfe bereaves?
What art is thine, that so thy friend deceives?
When even there where most thou praisest me,
For writing better, I must envy thee.

It is only really different, I think, in that Jonson seems to have direct
experience of Beaumont's writing, rather than having others tell him about
it. He talks about Beaumont's muse, the words that issue from his pen, the
quality of his work, etc., in response, presumably, to Beaumont's &quot;Letter.&quot;
But I'm no expert on this stuff.

Is this how we should start?

No it isn't. We should start by correctly identifying the question. (Have
you been taking Thornton's Thicko Tablets?)
To make it easier I shall erase the name from Jonson's piece. It's now
called De Mr.X Nostrati.

I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an
honour to Mr X that in his writing, (whatsoever
he penn'd), he never blotted out line.

Diana Priceless has told us that &quot;There is nothing in De Mr X Nostrati that
identifies a writer&quot;, and your mission, should you choose to accept it, is
to tell us what Mr X is being described as doing in that paragraph instead
of writing. Something that seems to involve a quill, ink and perhaps paper.
Is it solving crossword puzzles? Or doing the family accounts? Or some other
thing that I haven't thought of? Whatever it is, it makes Mr X worth an
article in Jonson's notebook.

I have been taking thicko tablets. Or the opposite. I'm sorry. I thought you
knew. It's called withdrawing from a medication after chemo that is
apparently worse than heroin to withdraw from. It's taken me a year to get
off two thirds of it and it affects memory, mood, (spelling) etc.

Let's not bring Diana into it, whatever she wrote. Her book has been argued
to death both here, apparently, and on the Fellowship boards, where the
battle rages even now and I don't really want a part of it. Let's just look
at it ourselves.

Of course it's about writing. The only thing that may weaken it is that it's
reported by someone else--the players.

Is that better?

To Price, &quot;explicit terminology&quot; means parsing words so they don't mean what
they say. She searches for unusual and rare definitions in order to insert
her interpretations between Jonson's intended meanings and modern readers.
The result is bizarre.

Even better -- we could all buy copies of Diana Price's book and study
them closely so we can learn how to do what she does. How can we
criticize what she says unless we've made ourselves into people who
have the same skills and knowledge as her? Obviously, it's
impossible. Why would she write a book using techniques nobody else
in history has ever used before, if her purpose were not to teach some
group of people how to use her own special techniques?

&gt;&gt; Stimulated by Bob's thread, &quot;A simple Question No Oxfordian will
Answer&quot;,
&gt;&gt; I've been thinking about evidence in general and how we interpret it.
Bob
&gt;&gt; seems to be asking Oxfordians to distinguish between different kinds of
&gt;&gt; evidence, and weigh up one kind against another. But that's a problem
all
&gt; by
&gt;&gt; itself. We'd have to agree on the categories. For example, Diana Price
has
&gt;&gt; done a lot of work on a new kind of evidence involving something called
&gt;&gt;&quot;explicit terminology&quot;, which she introduces us to when dealing with
&gt;&gt; Jonson's De Shakespeare Nostrati. Just to remind you, the piece begins
as
&gt;&gt; follows:-

&gt;&gt; I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an
&gt;&gt; honour to Shakespeare that in his writing, (whatsoever
&gt;&gt; he penn'd), he never blotted out line.

&gt;&gt; Price cautions us, &quot;Nothing in De Shakespeare Nostrati describes a
&gt; writer&quot;,
&gt;&gt; and then goes on to say: &quot;When Jonson referred to literary men, he used
&gt;&gt; explicit terminology&quot;, and quotes him on Beaumont, amongst others, as an
&gt;&gt; example of what she means by that: &quot;'For writing better I must envy
&gt; thee'&quot;.
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, she didn't give a definition of &quot;explicit terminology&quot;
that
&gt;&gt; would enable us to judge the one quote against the other.

&gt; To Price, &quot;explicit terminology&quot; means parsing words so they don't mean
what
&gt; they say. She searches for unusual and rare definitions in order to insert
&gt; her interpretations between Jonson's intended meanings and modern readers.
&gt; The result is bizarre.

&gt; I suppose that
&gt;&gt; must be our job. Now, if you eliminate what is common to both - namely,
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; word &quot;writing&quot; (even though it might sound a bit terminologically
explicit
&gt;&gt; to the layman) - it leaves you lining up &quot;better&quot; and &quot;envy&quot; as
&gt;&gt; terminologically explicit words against &quot;penn'd&quot; and &quot;blotted out&quot; to
see
&gt;&gt; why Beaumont passes the test of terminological explicitness and
&gt; Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; fails. And the answer is...well, I'm not sure what the answer is. I'm
&gt; only
&gt;&gt; sure that she's sure that Beaumont wins it hands down. &quot;De Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; Nostrati is devoid of any such *literary* terminology&quot;, she says (her
&gt;&gt; emphasis). Obviously, though, if &quot;writing&quot; doesn't refer to writing
&gt; (except
&gt;&gt; with Beaumont, where it does), it must refer to something else. It
leaves
&gt; us
&gt;&gt; pondering the knotty question of what kind of activity that opening
&gt;&gt; paragraph of De Shakespeare Nostrati is describing. &quot;Writing&quot;, &quot;penn'd&quot;
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&quot;blotted out&quot; constitute *some* kind of terminology, we think - but in
&gt; what
&gt;&gt; area of human endeavour? And is it explicit?

&gt; If you've read Price, you know the ridiculous lengths she goes to in order
&gt; to deny Shakespeare his authorship. Standing word definitions upside down
is
&gt; just one of them.

&gt;&gt; Maybe we could do a little collective work on this, similar to what
we're
&gt;&gt; doing on the sonnets - a group effort. Why doesn't some Oxfordian kick
off
&gt;&gt; the match by clarifying this complicated &quot;explicit terminology&quot; thing?
But
&gt; I
&gt;&gt; doubt Malcrowleyo would want to do it, since there's no bawdy involved,

&gt; Don't be so sure when it comes to Crowley. The word &quot;penn'd&quot; is fraught
with
&gt; possiblities to complusive minds like his.

&gt; and
&gt;&gt; Mary Queen of Scots doesn't come into it anywhere. So I think that just
&gt;&gt; leaves Lynne.

&gt;&gt; Lynne - over to you. What is it that Shakespeare is doing when he's
&gt; writing,
&gt;&gt; penning or blotting out?

&gt; Lynne has already answered. Of course, she trots out the &quot;ambigous&quot;
&gt; explanation, only in her case, like Price, the word's definition has
changed
&gt; to one of her own making. when she uses it, the word means &quot;occult&quot; or
&gt;&quot;cryptic.&quot;

"/>

Tom, that's nonsense. I think that the passage itself may be ambiguous, or
at least, difficult for us to us to understand. I have no idea whether
Jonson meant it to be so, but neither do I have any hesitation in saying
that the quote Buff picked is about writing.

My guess is that if you looked at some of my notebooks you'd have difficulty
deciphering them, although *I* know what I mean.

I'd like to participate in this thread, but don't really want to if it's
going to be discussing Price as her book has been analysed to death and the
argument is still going strong on the Fellowship boards. I'd much rather
look at the primary sources and see what meaning we can wrench from them.

Going away tomorrow if the dog doesn't hurl chunks again. Hope you'll all
miss me.

Regards of some kind. ;)

&gt; We should start by correctly identifying the question. (Have
&gt;&gt; you been taking Thornton's Thicko Tablets?)
&gt;&gt; To make it easier I shall erase the name from Jonson's piece. It's now
&gt;&gt; called De Mr.X Nostrati.

&gt;&gt; I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an
&gt;&gt; honour to Mr X that in his writing, (whatsoever
&gt;&gt; he penn'd), he never blotted out line.

&gt;&gt; Diana Priceless has told us that &quot;There is nothing in De Mr X Nostrati
&gt; that
&gt;&gt; identifies a writer&quot;, and your mission, should you choose to accept it,
is
&gt;&gt; to tell us what Mr X is being described as doing in that paragraph
instead
&gt;&gt; of writing. Something that seems to involve a quill, ink and perhaps
&gt; paper.
&gt;&gt; Is it solving crossword puzzles? Or doing the family accounts? Or some
&gt; other
&gt;&gt; thing that I haven't thought of? Whatever it is, it makes Mr X worth an
&gt;&gt; article in Jonson's notebook.

&gt; I have been taking thicko tablets. Or the opposite. I'm sorry. I thought
you
&gt; knew. It's called withdrawing from a medication after chemo that is
&gt; apparently worse than heroin to withdraw from. It's taken me a year to get
&gt; off two thirds of it and it affects memory, mood, (spelling) etc.

&gt; Let's not bring Diana into it, whatever she wrote.

"/>

It would hardly be possible to discuss anti-Stratfordian claims without
reference to anti-Stratfordian writers, and Price seems to be the most
revered at the moment. (Conversely, you can hardly expect a discussion of
Stratfordian claims without reference to Chambers.) Just because she has
been debated exhaustively on some other board, that doesn't impose any
moratorium here.

Lynne, when it comes to authorship claims there is no &quot;of course&quot;.
Everything has to be spelled out. You say *of course* it's about writing
(and so do I); Price says *of course* it isn't: &quot;Nothing in De Shakespeare
Nostrati describes a writer&quot;. If you disagree with her assertion, it's as
well to put it on record. It's then worth asking to what extent that
assertion can even be called an &quot;interpretation&quot;. If someone is described
as doing something involving the words &quot;writing&quot;, &quot;penn'd&quot; and &quot;blotted out&quot;
and some commentator declares that it does not describe a writer, can that
honestly be called a matter of opinion? When a commentator has crossed the
line that divides honest opinion from outright falsehood, we are bound to
ask whether that commentator can be trusted in *any* respect.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The only thing that may weaken it is that it's
&gt; reported by someone else--the players.

"/>

Yes, that would certainly weaken it, if we thought that Jonson is treating
Shakespeare as a writer only because the Players have told him he's one. But
since he then goes on to say &quot;would he had blotted a thousand&quot;, that appears
to confirm that Jonson already knew he was a writer, and didn't need the
Players to tell him. Moreover, it tells us he had already formed opinions
about this writer that the Players didn't share. So, no, it doesn't weaken
it after all. Jonson is clearly talking about someone he knows to be a
writer and not someone he has merely heard is a writer.

Why did I single you out for this question? You told me recently that your
belief in Oxford is something less than 100%, and that seems to make you the
mirror image of me. My belief in William as the author is also less than
100% - call it 90%. The ten percent or so of doubt that both of us have
makes discussion possible, as it wouldn't be possible in the case of David
Kathmann and Mark Alexander, who can only shout at each other from their
respective mountain fortresses. I don't see much mileage in addressing
questions to people with fixed positions.

Hmm, you know, there IS some Janicery up there, after all. It's impossible to
criticize someone (validly, I assume) unless you have the same skills and

as mockery of Price, or of anti-Priceans. Price uses no new techniques, by the

We're trying to discuss the sonnets without recourse to any secondary

when we get to sonnet 27, I'll mention new material which I've just read,

I'll take another look for it when I come back from Montreal. Oops. My

Let me make it quite clear. I believe the passage you quoted is about a
writer. I'm just not sure who that writer is. Diana may have an argument

Agreed. Or at least, that Jonson had seen the PRODUCT, in the sense of
having read the published plays or watched them being enacted. The players
said Sh didn't blot a line, suggesting that they had seen him at work or had
seen the mss. Jonson says he wishes Shakespeare had blotted a thousand
lines. This doesn't suggest that he had seen him at work. I think he's being
a critic here.

Um, having a bit of a problem. Knowing that Shakespeare is a writer (who
could not know it by that time?) doesn't mean that Jonson had personal
knowledge of him ACTUALLY writing. Do you see what I mean? It's a bit
quibbly, but I thought I might as well bring it up; however, to look at the
other side of the argument, if we examine the whole passage, it appears as
though Jonson knew &quot;Shakespeare&quot; very well. That's why I introduced the
passage in its entirety. It's hard to take a little quote out of context and
discuss it, or at least, it is for me.

I have argued in the past that the passage is about Oxford, on the basis of
&quot;flowed with that facility&quot; and &quot;Sufflaminandus erat,&quot; but everyone, Strat
and Oxie alike, thinks my argument hysterically ridiculous and keels over
laughing, so we'll just leave it at that for the present.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Why did I single you out for this question? You told me recently that your
&gt; belief in Oxford is something less than 100%, and that seems to make you

That's not quite it. I said I had difficulty in linking Oxford's early
poems, with the exception of about three (some two of which are probables),
to Shakespeare, and thus needed to think of them as juvenilia for the
&quot;Oxford as Shakespeare&quot; story to make sense to me. Therefore it wouldn't
break my heart if another candidate turned up, although I doubt it would be
WS of Stratford; however, Oxford is the best candidate for me at present.
I've just been rereading his letters and was struck by a metaphor about
siege which reminded me of one of the marriage sonnets. But I strive always
to keep an open mind so I don't discount evidence that may not be in favour
of my candidate. Saying, of course, is easier than doing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;My belief in William as the author is also less than

OK. Mine is rather stronger than that the other way.

That's likely true; however, it's interesting to note that it was Mark
Alexander who first suggested to Oxfordians in a paper he gave about a year
ago that we must strive to keep open minds so that we aren't selective in
the evidence we accept. That was very helpful to me, and it's one of the
reasons that I continue to participate on hlas. If I keep hearing only from
Oxfordians, I can't help but be selective with regard to evidence. The
other, more important reason that I participate is to examine the works
themselves without the kind of censorship that exists on the Shaksper list.

&gt; beene, would he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought

"/>

&lt;snip&gt;

Like Lynne, I have no wish to get into a discussion about
what Diana Price may or may not have meant by some phrase
she used, partly because I haven't read her book, but
mainly because I am far more interested in what *Jonson*
may have meant. There is little doubt that this particular
passage is a hurdle which anyone of an anti-Stratfordian
turn of mind needs to clear if they are not to leave them-
selves open to the criticism of ignoring any evidence
which runs counter to their views.

As always with this sort of thing, of course, one's idea
of what such an extract might mean will be very influenced
by what one believes the background situation to be. Strat-
fordians will therefore read it assuming that Jonson is
referring to Shakespeare as the sole writer of the plays
attributed to him, and interpret it accordingly. This then
becomes in their minds the &quot;right&quot; answer, and any other
interpretation wrong. My view is that another meaning can
be taken from his words which better fits what *I* think
is the probable background situation, and that *if* my
scenario is correct, then my interpretation is more likely
to be the right one. In neither case, however, can Jonson's
words be taken as evidence on behalf of one story to the
*exclusion* of the other.

The background situation, as I see it, is (to quote my
essay on the monument) &quot;that Marlowe and Shakespeare
probably worked as a team, using the name of the latter
as a sort of 'trading name' for the partnership. Marlowe
was responsible for by far the greater part of any writing
that was done, but Shakespeare was the public face, the
provider (and polisher up) of the scripts, the interface
with the players, provider of the 'sides' they worked from,
and the apparent authority on what the plays were all about,
how they should be presented, etc.&quot;

So, with that in mind, let's look at Jonson's words,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an
&gt; honour to Shakespeare, that in his writing (whatsoever
&gt; he penn'd) hee never blotted out line.

"/>

If we ignore for a moment the bit in parentheses, It seems
fairly obvious that the Players are talking about writings
which are in Shakespeare's own hand and which he has given
to them.

Acknowledging the immense help that Clark Holloway's
page is in doing such a thing, let us look at the ways in
which Jonson tends to use the verb 'to write', or forms
of it, in his plays. They seem to fall into roughly three
groups, not unlike how we would use the word today:

1) The physical activity of setting down words etc on
paper or the like. I found about 3 examples of this.

2) Reporting or assembling information and setting it down,
such as the writing of annals or day-to-day letters.
This is the most common use, my having found 14 in all.

3) An activity requiring imagination and intended to affect
the emotions, such as the creation of verse, plays,
speeches, songs, love-letters. I found 7 of these.

We must of course assume that the Players are referring to
plays they have been given, but the reference to what is
'blotted out' tends to give the physical activity more
emphasis. It is also worth noting that the word is
'writing' rather than 'writings', which has a similar
tendency to push it in that direction.

It needn't be, but I take the parentheses to indicate that
this is an aside by Jonson, and not what the Players have
said. If it were from their words, then they would be
probably saying that no matter what type of thing he wrote
- whether comedy, history or tragedy, for example - it was
always like this. One might wonder why it was necessary to
amplify it in this way of course, but it is possible.

If it is his additional comment, however, we perhaps need
to look a little more closely at those words 'whatsoever'
and 'penned'.

He tended to use 'whatsoever' to mean either 'anything
which' or 'no matter what'.

Examples (both from *Every Man out of His Humour*) are:

and hence we do conclude,
That whatsoe'er hath Fluxure and Humidity,
As wanting power to contain it self,
Is Humour.
('anything which')

Nay, look you Carlo: this is my humour now! I
have Land and Mony, my Friends left me well,
and I will be a Gentleman whatsoever it cost me.
('no matter what')

It is when we come to the verb 'pen' and its variants
(and excluding any 'shut in' meaning) that it gets
interesting, and surprising as far as I was concerned.
Without exception, every one of the 17 examples I found
in Jonson was of the third type I mentioned above, the
one requiring imagination. He does therefore clearly
distinguish the two words as to his usage of them.

If, then, we assume that a similar distinction is being
made in *Timber*, and if the word 'penned' is emphasized,
he could be saying that in the plays they have received
in Shakespeare's handwriting (no matter what he composed
himself) he had never blotted out a line.

And is Jonson perhaps objecting to 'a thousand' lines
among those which he knows full well that Shakespeare,
&quot;You know what he's like&quot;, must have added to the ones
he received from you-know-who?

Now I would like to move on to that bit at the end of the
extract:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Many times hee fell into those things, could not escape
&gt; laughter: As when hee said in the person of Cæsar, one
&gt; speaking to him; Cæsar thou dost me wrong. Hee replyed:
&gt; Cæsar did never wrong, but with just cause: and such like;
&gt; which were ridiculous.

"/>

I want to suggest something which I don't think has been
suggested before (at least not here), which is that
Jonson is referring to a speech he half-remembers in his
own *Sejanus*, in which we know Shakespeare acted.
Sejanus (Burbage?) addresses Tiberius (Shakespeare?):

Sej. Cæsar doth wrong
His Dignity and Safety, thus to mourn
The deserv'd End of so profest a Traitor,
And doth, by this his Lenity, instruct
Others as factious, to the like Offence.
Tib. The Confiscation meerly of his State
Had been enough.

I think it quite likely that, before carrying on with his
'correct' words, Shakespeare ad-libbed the line that
Jonson - typical playwright - remembers much better!

And if I am right in this, then we may safely assume that
virtually everything he says about Shakespeare from around
where he claims to have &quot;loved the man&quot; is about Shake-
speare as a witty and imaginative, if over-enthusiastic,
person, rather than Shakespeare (necessarily) as a writer.

One final thought about that part of the extract:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ... (for I lov'd the man, and doe
&gt; honour his memory (on this side Idolatry) as much as
&gt; any.)

"/>

He loved the *man* and honoured his memory as much as
any, but did *not* idolize him as others apparently did.
Why not, I wonder?

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Like Lynne, I have no wish to get into a discussion about
&gt; what Diana Price may or may not have meant by some phrase
&gt; she used, partly because I haven't read her book, but
&gt; mainly because I am far more interested in what *Jonson*
&gt; may have meant. There is little doubt that this particular
&gt; passage is a hurdle which anyone of an anti-Stratfordian
&gt; turn of mind needs to clear if they are not to leave them-
&gt; selves open to the criticism of ignoring any evidence
&gt; which runs counter to their views.

&gt; As always with this sort of thing, of course, one's idea
&gt; of what such an extract might mean will be very influenced
&gt; by what one believes the background situation to be. Strat-
&gt; fordians will therefore read it assuming that Jonson is
&gt; referring to Shakespeare as the sole writer of the plays

"/>

I don't know why think that assumption is particularly Stratfordian. Why
don't you test it out by asking someone who knows nothing about the
authorship question? How would they interpret it? Would they think Jonson
was hinting at the existence of some &quot;assistant&quot;?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This then

But, as usual, the anti-Stratfordian interpretation relies upon words not
actually meaning what they appear to mean. The innocent reader mentioned in
my reply to the last point would undoubtedly make the Stratfordian reading,
and would need quite a bit of prompting before they would make any other
reading.

Where does this word &quot;probably&quot; come from? Even the survival of Marlowe

Not if the First Folio means anything, since Jonson is only repeating an
implicit criticism he made in his encomium - namely, his belief that
Shakespeare should have cut and revised his texts more than he did. The
criticism is only implicit, since it would not be appropriate in a
celebratory document like the First Folio to voice such reservations
outright. The extended passage that deals with Shakespeare's &quot;Art&quot; (meaning
his learned technique rather than his native talent) describes the process
by which first thoughts are cut and shaped, a process in which &quot;blotting out
line&quot; would play a big part. Here in his private notebook, that criticism
can be more explicit. If you are determined to construct a two-author
theory, you would have to show how this criticism is a reference to the
inferiority of Shakespeare's additions to Marlowe's original - and show it
in the First Folio, not just by some ingenious re-interpretation of words
like &quot;writing&quot; and &quot;penn'd&quot; in Jonson's private notebook.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now I would like to move on to that bit at the end of the

But doesn't remember it so well that he correctly identifies the meaning.

&gt;and the apparent authority on what the plays were all about,
&gt;how they should be presented, etc.&quot;

&gt;So, with that in mind, let's look at Jonson's words,

&gt;&gt; I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an
&gt;&gt; honour to Shakespeare, that in his writing (whatsoever

&gt;If we ignore for a moment the bit in parentheses, It seems

&gt;which are in Shakespeare's own hand and which he has given
&gt;to them.

&gt;Acknowledging the immense help that Clark Holloway's
&gt;page is in doing such a thing, let us look at the ways in
&gt;which Jonson tends to use the verb 'to write', or forms
&gt;of it, in his plays. They seem to fall into roughly three
&gt;groups, not unlike how we would use the word today:

&gt;1) The physical activity of setting down words etc on
&gt; paper or the like. I found about 3 examples of this.

&gt;2) Reporting or assembling information and setting it down,
&gt; such as the writing of annals or day-to-day letters.
&gt; This is the most common use, my having found 14 in all.

&gt;3) An activity requiring imagination and intended to affect
&gt; the emotions, such as the creation of verse, plays,
&gt; speeches, songs, love-letters. I found 7 of these.

&gt;We must of course assume that the Players are referring to
&gt;plays they have been given, but the reference to what is
&gt;'blotted out' tends to give the physical activity more
&gt;emphasis. It is also worth noting that the word is
&gt;'writing' rather than 'writings', which has a similar
&gt;tendency to push it in that direction.

&gt;It needn't be, but I take the parentheses to indicate that
&gt;this is an aside by Jonson, and not what the Players have
&gt;said. If it were from their words, then they would be
&gt;probably saying that no matter what type of thing he wrote
&gt;- whether comedy, history or tragedy, for example - it was
&gt;always like this. One might wonder why it was necessary to
&gt;amplify it in this way of course, but it is possible.

&gt;If it is his additional comment, however, we perhaps need
&gt;to look a little more closely at those words 'whatsoever'
&gt;and 'penned'.

&gt;He tended to use 'whatsoever' to mean either 'anything
&gt;which' or 'no matter what'.

&gt;Examples (both from *Every Man out of His Humour*) are:

&gt; and hence we do conclude,
&gt; That whatsoe'er hath Fluxure and Humidity,
&gt; As wanting power to contain it self,
&gt; Is Humour.
&gt; ('anything which')

&gt; Nay, look you Carlo: this is my humour now! I
&gt; have Land and Mony, my Friends left me well,
&gt; and I will be a Gentleman whatsoever it cost me.
&gt; ('no matter what')

&gt;It is when we come to the verb 'pen' and its variants
&gt;(and excluding any 'shut in' meaning) that it gets
&gt;interesting, and surprising as far as I was concerned.
&gt;Without exception, every one of the 17 examples I found
&gt;in Jonson was of the third type I mentioned above, the
&gt;one requiring imagination. He does therefore clearly
&gt;distinguish the two words as to his usage of them.

&gt;If, then, we assume that a similar distinction is being
&gt;made in *Timber*, and if the word 'penned' is emphasized,
&gt;he could be saying that in the plays they have received
&gt;in Shakespeare's handwriting (no matter what he composed
&gt;himself) he had never blotted out a line.

&gt;And is Jonson perhaps objecting to 'a thousand' lines
&gt;among those which he knows full well that Shakespeare,
&gt;&quot;You know what he's like&quot;, must have added to the ones
&gt;he received from you-know-who?

&gt;Now I would like to move on to that bit at the end of the
&gt;extract:

&gt;&gt; Many times hee fell into those things, could not escape
&gt;&gt; laughter: As when hee said in the person of Cæsar, one
&gt;&gt; speaking to him; Cæsar thou dost me wrong. Hee replyed:
&gt;&gt; Cæsar did never wrong, but with just cause: and such like;
&gt;&gt; which were ridiculous.

&gt;I want to suggest something which I don't think has been
&gt;suggested before (at least not here), which is that
&gt;Jonson is referring to a speech he half-remembers in his
&gt;own *Sejanus*, in which we know Shakespeare acted.
&gt;Sejanus (Burbage?) addresses Tiberius (Shakespeare?):

&gt;Sej. Cæsar doth wrong
&gt; His Dignity and Safety, thus to mourn
&gt; The deserv'd End of so profest a Traitor,
&gt; And doth, by this his Lenity, instruct
&gt; Others as factious, to the like Offence.
&gt;Tib. The Confiscation meerly of his State
&gt; Had been enough.

&gt;I think it quite likely that, before carrying on with his
&gt;'correct' words, Shakespeare ad-libbed the line that
&gt;Jonson - typical playwright - remembers much better!

&gt;And if I am right in this, then we may safely assume that
&gt;virtually everything he says about Shakespeare from around
&gt;where he claims to have &quot;loved the man&quot; is about Shake-
&gt;speare as a witty and imaginative, if over-enthusiastic,
&gt;person, rather than Shakespeare (necessarily) as a writer.

&gt;One final thought about that part of the extract:

&gt;&gt; ... (for I lov'd the man, and doe
&gt;&gt; honour his memory (on this side Idolatry) as much as
&gt;&gt; any.)

&gt;He loved the *man* and honoured his memory as much as
&gt;any, but did *not* idolize him as others apparently did.
&gt;Why not, I wonder?

Peter, the main problem with your interpretation is that it ignores the
inescapable meaning of &quot;the Players have often mentioned it as an
honour to Shakespeare, that in his writing . . .&quot;&quot;Writing&quot; means the use of
some implement like a pen to put words (units of verbal expression) on paper or
the equivalent in order to communicate thoughts or ideas to other people. &quot;His&quot;
is a third person singular possessive pronoun. Here its referent is undeniably
&quot;Shakespeare.&quot; Ergo, Jonson is speaking of Shakespeare's writing. We know from
his other works that Jonson was a competent writer. Consequently, we have
little reason to believe he would start a paragraph discussing a man's writing,
then in the middle of it start discussing his conversation--with no warning,
with no hint that that was what he was doing, answhere.

Because Jonson took people for what they were, not as gods or demigods the way
some of his twittier acquaintances no doubt did. He was also fond of whatever
rhetorical device it is in which one qualifies one's praise--to show one is not
a trivial sycophant.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hee was (indeed) honest, and of an open, and free nature:

&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; Like Lynne, I have no wish to get into a discussion about
&gt;&gt; what Diana Price may or may not have meant by some phrase
&gt;&gt; she used, partly because I haven't read her book, but
&gt;&gt; mainly because I am far more interested in what *Jonson*
&gt;&gt; may have meant. There is little doubt that this particular
&gt;&gt; passage is a hurdle which anyone of an anti-Stratfordian
&gt;&gt; turn of mind needs to clear if they are not to leave them-
&gt;&gt; selves open to the criticism of ignoring any evidence
&gt;&gt; which runs counter to their views.

&gt;&gt; As always with this sort of thing, of course, one's idea
&gt;&gt; of what such an extract might mean will be very influenced
&gt;&gt; by what one believes the background situation to be. Strat-
&gt;&gt; fordians will therefore read it assuming that Jonson is
&gt;&gt; referring to Shakespeare as the sole writer of the plays
&gt;&gt; attributed to him, and interpret it accordingly.

&gt; I don't know why think that assumption is particularly
&gt; Stratfordian.

"/>

My apologies. I should perhaps have said &quot;those who accept
the othodox authorship position&quot;. Not that it makes any
difference to my argument, of course.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why don't you test it out by asking someone who knows
&gt; nothing about the authorship question? How would they
&gt; interpret it? Would they think Jonson was hinting at
&gt; the existence of some &quot;assistant&quot;?

"/>

No of course not. They would, as I said, base their inter-
pretation upon what they assumed the background to be.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; This then
&gt;&gt; becomes in their minds the &quot;right&quot; answer, and any other
&gt;&gt; interpretation wrong. My view is that another meaning can
&gt;&gt; be taken from his words which better fits what *I* think
&gt;&gt; is the probable background situation, and that *if* my
&gt;&gt; scenario is correct, then my interpretation is more likely
&gt;&gt; to be the right one.

&gt; But, as usual, the anti-Stratfordian interpretation relies
&gt; upon words not actually meaning what they appear to mean.

"/>

As is, of course, very often the case with things written
that long ago.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The innocent reader mentioned in my reply to the last
&gt; point would undoubtedly make the Stratfordian reading,
&gt; and would need quite a bit of prompting before they
&gt; would make any other reading.

"/>

No doubt. Partly for the reasons I give above, and partly
though ignorance. For example, my own assumption of what
the most common use of the verb &quot;to pen&quot; would be turns out
to be the very opposite of the way in which Jonson (and
Shakespeare and Marlowe for that matter) actually use it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In neither case, however, can Jonson's
&gt;&gt; words be taken as evidence on behalf of one story to the
&gt;&gt; *exclusion* of the other.

&gt;&gt; The background situation, as I see it, is (to quote my
&gt;&gt; essay on the monument) &quot;that Marlowe and Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; probably worked as a team, using the name of the latter
&gt;&gt; as a sort of 'trading name' for the partnership.

&gt; Where does this word &quot;probably&quot; come from?

It comes, as I said, from my essay on the Stratford monument,
in which I claim that there is a hidden message which leads
to this conclusion, and show that the probability of the
message having occurred by accident is negligible.

'We' may not, but I do. And it is my opinion concerning the
background situation that I am explaining here. My reasons

&gt;&gt; but Shakespeare was the public face, the
&gt;&gt; provider (and polisher up) of the scripts, the interface
&gt;&gt; with the players, provider of the 'sides' they worked from,
&gt;&gt; and the apparent authority on what the plays were all about,
&gt;&gt; how they should be presented, etc.&quot;

&gt;&gt; So, with that in mind, let's look at Jonson's words,

&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an
&gt;&gt;&gt; honour to Shakespeare, that in his writing (whatsoever
&gt;&gt;&gt; he penn'd) hee never blotted out line.

&gt;&gt; If we ignore for a moment the bit in parentheses, It seems

&gt;&gt; such as the writing of annals or day-to-day letters.
&gt;&gt; This is the most common use, my having found 14 in all.

&gt;&gt; 3) An activity requiring imagination and intended to affect
&gt;&gt; the emotions, such as the creation of verse, plays,
&gt;&gt; speeches, songs, love-letters. I found 7 of these.

&gt;&gt; We must of course assume that the Players are referring to
&gt;&gt; plays they have been given, but the reference to what is
&gt;&gt; 'blotted out' tends to give the physical activity more

&gt;&gt; always like this. One might wonder why it was necessary to
&gt;&gt; amplify it in this way of course, but it is possible.

&gt;&gt; If it is his additional comment, however, we perhaps need
&gt;&gt; to look a little more closely at those words 'whatsoever'
&gt;&gt; and 'penned'.

&gt;&gt; He tended to use 'whatsoever' to mean either 'anything
&gt;&gt; which' or 'no matter what'.

&gt;&gt; Examples (both from *Every Man out of His Humour*) are:

&gt;&gt; and hence we do conclude,
&gt;&gt; That whatsoe'er hath Fluxure and Humidity,
&gt;&gt; As wanting power to contain it self,
&gt;&gt; Is Humour.
&gt;&gt; ('anything which')

&gt;&gt; Nay, look you Carlo: this is my humour now! I
&gt;&gt; have Land and Mony, my Friends left me well,
&gt;&gt; and I will be a Gentleman whatsoever it cost me.
&gt;&gt; ('no matter what')

&gt;&gt; It is when we come to the verb 'pen' and its variants
&gt;&gt; (and excluding any 'shut in' meaning) that it gets
&gt;&gt; interesting, and surprising as far as I was concerned.
&gt;&gt; Without exception, every one of the 17 examples I found
&gt;&gt; in Jonson was of the third type I mentioned above, the
&gt;&gt; one requiring imagination. He does therefore clearly
&gt;&gt; distinguish the two words as to his usage of them.

&gt;&gt; If, then, we assume that a similar distinction is being
&gt;&gt; made in *Timber*, and if the word 'penned' is emphasized,
&gt;&gt; he could be saying that in the plays they have received
&gt;&gt; in Shakespeare's handwriting (no matter what he composed

&gt;&gt; And is Jonson perhaps objecting to 'a thousand' lines
&gt;&gt; among those which he knows full well that Shakespeare,
&gt;&gt;&quot;You know what he's like&quot;, must have added to the ones
&gt;&gt; he received from you-know-who?

&gt; Not if the First Folio means anything, since Jonson is only
&gt; repeating an implicit criticism he made in his encomium
&gt; - namely, his belief that Shakespeare should have cut and
&gt; revised his texts more than he did. The criticism is only
&gt; implicit, since it would not be appropriate in a celebratory
&gt; document like the First Folio to voice such reservations
&gt; outright. The extended passage that deals with Shakespeare's
&gt;&quot;Art&quot; (meaning his learned technique rather than his native
&gt; talent) describes the process by which first thoughts are
&gt; cut and shaped, a process in which &quot;blotting out line&quot; would
&gt; play a big part.

some re-written and not others seems unlikely to me. Does
it matter? This is the interpretation that you are basing
on an orthodox view of the background, right?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; Now I would like to move on to that bit at the end of the
&gt;&gt; extract:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Many times hee fell into those things, could not escape
&gt;&gt;&gt; laughter: As when hee said in the person of Cæsar, one
&gt;&gt;&gt; speaking to him; Cæsar thou dost me wrong. Hee replyed:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cæsar did never wrong, but with just cause: and such like;
&gt;&gt;&gt; which were ridiculous.

&gt;&gt; I want to suggest something which I don't think has been
&gt;&gt; suggested before (at least not here), which is that
&gt;&gt; Jonson is referring to a speech he half-remembers in his
&gt;&gt; own *Sejanus*, in which we know Shakespeare acted.
&gt;&gt; Sejanus (Burbage?) addresses Tiberius (Shakespeare?):

&gt;&gt; Sej. Cæsar doth wrong
&gt;&gt; His Dignity and Safety, thus to mourn
&gt;&gt; The deserv'd End of so profest a Traitor,
&gt;&gt; And doth, by this his Lenity, instruct
&gt;&gt; Others as factious, to the like Offence.
&gt;&gt; Tib. The Confiscation meerly of his State
&gt;&gt; Had been enough.

&gt;&gt; I think it quite likely that, before carrying on with his
&gt;&gt; 'correct' words, Shakespeare ad-libbed the line that
&gt;&gt; Jonson - typical playwright - remembers much better!

&gt; Except that Jonson's remark indicates that Shakespeare's
&gt; Caesar wronged someone else, not himself.

Yes, I have already conceded this one, although on far
better grounds than these!

&gt;&gt; Paul, Jonson was discussing Shakespeare's WRITING.

&gt;Maybe. Do you think that's why Jonson

Jonson says that because he felt strong affection for the man, Shakespeare, and

his writing to be priased than pardoned.

Jonson was talking about the actors' friend. If he was talking about Oxford, as

Peter, I'll admit that I missed your suggestion that the players and Jonson were
talking about Shakespeare's being, in effect, a scribe as opposed to being a
writer. Or maybe I took it in but forgot it quickly in my confusion. My
problem is that your interpretation seems to me to have so many things wrong
with it that it's hard to argue against.

To begin with, Heminges and Condell wrote (or signed their names to a text) that
spoke of Shakespeare as a writer who didn't blot. So it's hard to believe
Jonson is in Timber is now speaking of Shakespeare as a scribe. Also, as Jim
points out, Jonson is speaking of him in a section Jonson says is about writers,
and which IS about writers in the rest of it. Also, where else does Jonson
discuss the merits of scribes' handwriting? Also, Jonson goes on to talk about
verbal utterances of the man he is speaking of--with no indication whatever that
he is changing the subject. What do they have to do with penmanship? Also, did
Shakespeare add Bohemia's shoreline to someone else's play? Just what is Jonson
honoring him for? Adding junk to another's plays, and not blotting lines you
think he added. (This bit, I really don't get; why would Jonson think he should
have blotted lines he added instead of not added them in the first place? Not
to mention the obvious fact that Jonson says nothing whatever to suggest he
thinks anyone is adding lines to anything.)

All that, and I think I've probably left out five or ten arguments against your
interpretation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Like Lynne, I have no wish to get into a discussion about
&gt;&gt;&gt; what Diana Price may or may not have meant by some phrase
&gt;&gt;&gt; she used, partly because I haven't read her book, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; mainly because I am far more interested in what *Jonson*
&gt;&gt;&gt; may have meant. There is little doubt that this particular
&gt;&gt;&gt; passage is a hurdle which anyone of an anti-Stratfordian
&gt;&gt;&gt; turn of mind needs to clear if they are not to leave them-
&gt;&gt;&gt; selves open to the criticism of ignoring any evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt; which runs counter to their views.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As always with this sort of thing, of course, one's idea
&gt;&gt;&gt; of what such an extract might mean will be very influenced
&gt;&gt;&gt; by what one believes the background situation to be. Strat-
&gt;&gt;&gt; fordians will therefore read it assuming that Jonson is
&gt;&gt;&gt; referring to Shakespeare as the sole writer of the plays
&gt;&gt;&gt; attributed to him, and interpret it accordingly.

&gt;&gt; I don't know why think that assumption is particularly
&gt;&gt; Stratfordian.

&gt; My apologies. I should perhaps have said &quot;those who accept
&gt; the othodox authorship position&quot;. Not that it makes any
&gt; difference to my argument, of course.

"/>

But it certainly makes a difference to the impression your argument will
make on others. No, I am not talking about &quot;those who accept the orthodox
authorship position&quot;, which is just another way of saying &quot;Stratfordian&quot;,
but about those who have no position at all - just reasonably intelligent
people invited to read Jonson's piece. Would they detect any reference at
all to a second playwright? I doubt it very much. Any argument that demands
that the reader deviate from the kind of common-sense reading that an
*average person* would make is an argument that already has a credibility
gap. This seems to be the one thing that anti-Strats can never quite grasp -
this idea that the surface meaning of anything is the interpretation most
likely to be believed by most people. And the problem with all
anti-Stratfordian theories is that deviating from surface meanings is what
they do demand - over and over again. And the pattern of development then is
that the theorist somehow thinks that an unlikely premise can be made more
credible by building a second unlikely premise on top of it, and a third one
top of the second, and so on. In no time at all, we have flourishes like
this:-

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Marlowe
&gt;was responsible for by far the greater part of any writing
&gt;that was done, but Shakespeare was the public face, the
&gt;provider (and polisher up) of the scripts, the interface

"/>

You're really off and running, aren't you? One would think you had a pile of
documents in front of you from which you are able to construct your
estimates -&quot;by far the greater part&quot;, etc. One would never know from this
confident assertion that you had not an atom of evidence that even one word
of the Shakespeare works came from Marlowe's pen. The only explanation I can
think of is that your hypotheses have such a magnetic pull that each one you
come up with only lasts as a hypothesis for a few sentences, after which it
migrates into some other part of the brain labelled &quot;fact&quot;. That then
enables you to build a second hypothesis based on this &quot;fact&quot;, which in its
turn becomes a second &quot;fact&quot;, and provides the platform for a third
hypothesis, and so on.

It might not, as you put it, &quot;make any difference to your argument&quot; that
your interpretation of De Shakespeare Nostrati strains the average reader's
credulity, but it certainly makes a difference to its reception. It
guarantees that all the ingenuities built upon it will count for nothing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Why don't you test it out by asking someone who knows
&gt;&gt; nothing about the authorship question? How would they
&gt;&gt; interpret it? Would they think Jonson was hinting at
&gt;&gt; the existence of some &quot;assistant&quot;?

&gt; No of course not. They would, as I said, base their inter-
&gt; pretation upon what they assumed the background to be.

"/>

Yes, we're back to the old &quot;assumptions&quot; game again - despite the fact that
I clearly said &quot;someone who knows nothing about the authorship question&quot;.
It's all part of this pretence that the common-sense reading of a document
is only the common-sense reading to those burdened with Stratfordian
&quot;assumptions&quot;. But it isn't. The common-sense reading is the reading that
*any* intelligent person would make. There is no common-sense reading of
Jonson's piece that can find a second playwright hiding behind the first.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; This then
&gt;&gt;&gt; becomes in their minds the &quot;right&quot; answer, and any other
&gt;&gt;&gt; interpretation wrong. My view is that another meaning can
&gt;&gt;&gt; be taken from his words which better fits what *I* think
&gt;&gt;&gt; is the probable background situation, and that *if* my
&gt;&gt;&gt; scenario is correct, then my interpretation is more likely
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be the right one.

&gt;&gt; But, as usual, the anti-Stratfordian interpretation relies
&gt;&gt; upon words not actually meaning what they appear to mean.

&gt; As is, of course, very often the case with things written
&gt; that long ago.

"/>

As is hardly ever the case with things written that long ago. Most
Elizabethan documents are clear once the usual meaning of words has been
established. What is or might be obscure is any factual material that it
speaks of, events or people unknown to us. Even hurriedly or clumsily
written pieces like Heywood's epistle to his printer yield up their meaning
after a little effort from the reader. When I spoke of &quot;words not actually
meaning what they appear to mean&quot; I was not referring to obscurities of
Elizabethan language or vocabulary. I was referring to efforts made by
authorship-theorists to subvert the *surface* meaning of a document (just to
remind you, that's the meaning that most people will believe) to fit their
particular theory.
I began this thread with an assertion from Diana Price: &quot;nothing in De
Shakespeare Nostrati describes a writer&quot;. I leave it to you to work out how
much subversion of surface meaning has to take place before the first
paragraph of the piece falls into line:

I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an
honour to Shakespeare that in his writing, (whatsoever
he penn'd), he never blotted out line.

But that - as always - is what anti-Stratfordian theories require from the
reader, a willingness to say that black means white, up means down, and
butter means cheese.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The innocent reader mentioned in my reply to the last
&gt;&gt; point would undoubtedly make the Stratfordian reading,
&gt;&gt; and would need quite a bit of prompting before they
&gt;&gt; would make any other reading.

&gt; No doubt. Partly for the reasons I give above, and partly
&gt; though ignorance. For example, my own assumption of what
&gt; the most common use of the verb &quot;to pen&quot; would be turns out
&gt; to be the very opposite of the way in which Jonson (and
&gt; Shakespeare and Marlowe for that matter) actually use it.

"/>

Let's focus on Jonson. I take it you've trawled for examples of his use of
the word &quot;writing&quot; to mean the mere physical act of putting words on
aper - as opposed to &quot;penning&quot;, which is creative writing. Would you list
some of those examples?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; If, then, we assume that a similar distinction is being
&gt;&gt;&gt; made in *Timber*, and if the word 'penned' is emphasized,
&gt;&gt;&gt; he could be saying that in the plays they have received
&gt;&gt;&gt; in Shakespeare's handwriting (no matter what he composed
&gt;&gt;&gt; himself) he had never blotted out a line.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And is Jonson perhaps objecting to 'a thousand' lines
&gt;&gt;&gt; among those which he knows full well that Shakespeare,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;You know what he's like&quot;, must have added to the ones
&gt;&gt;&gt; he received from you-know-who?

&gt;&gt; Not if the First Folio means anything, since Jonson is only
&gt;&gt; repeating an implicit criticism he made in his encomium
&gt;&gt; - namely, his belief that Shakespeare should have cut and
&gt;&gt; revised his texts more than he did. The criticism is only
&gt;&gt; implicit, since it would not be appropriate in a celebratory
&gt;&gt; document like the First Folio to voice such reservations
&gt;&gt; outright. The extended passage that deals with Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&quot;Art&quot; (meaning his learned technique rather than his native
&gt;&gt; talent) describes the process by which first thoughts are
&gt;&gt; cut and shaped, a process in which &quot;blotting out line&quot; would
&gt;&gt; play a big part.

&gt; [snip]
&gt;&gt; So, with that in mind, let's look at Jonson's words,

&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an
&gt;&gt;&gt; honour to Shakespeare, that in his writing (whatsoever
&gt;&gt;&gt; he penn'd) hee never blotted out line.

&gt;&gt; If we ignore for a moment the bit in parentheses, It seems
&gt;&gt; fairly obvious that the Players are talking about writings
&gt;&gt; which are in Shakespeare's own hand and which he has given
&gt;&gt; to them.

&gt;&gt; Acknowledging the immense help that Clark Holloway's
&gt;&gt; page is in doing such a thing, let us look at the ways in
&gt;&gt; which Jonson tends to use the verb 'to write', or forms
&gt;&gt; of it, in his plays. They seem to fall into roughly three
&gt;&gt; groups, not unlike how we would use the word today:

&gt;&gt; 1) The physical activity of setting down words etc on
&gt;&gt; paper or the like. I found about 3 examples of this.

&gt;&gt; 2) Reporting or assembling information and setting it down,
&gt;&gt; such as the writing of annals or day-to-day letters.
&gt;&gt; This is the most common use, my having found 14 in all.

&gt;&gt; 3) An activity requiring imagination and intended to affect
&gt;&gt; the emotions, such as the creation of verse, plays,
&gt;&gt; speeches, songs, love-letters. I found 7 of these.

&gt;&gt; We must of course assume that the Players are referring to
&gt;&gt; plays they have been given, but the reference to what is
&gt;&gt; 'blotted out' tends to give the physical activity more
&gt;&gt; emphasis. It is also worth noting that the word is
&gt;&gt; 'writing' rather than 'writings', which has a similar
&gt;&gt; tendency to push it in that direction.

&gt;&gt; It needn't be, but I take the parentheses to indicate that
&gt;&gt; this is an aside by Jonson, and not what the Players have
&gt;&gt; said. If it were from their words, then they would be
&gt;&gt; probably saying that no matter what type of thing he wrote
&gt;&gt; - whether comedy, history or tragedy, for example - it was
&gt;&gt; always like this. One might wonder why it was necessary to
&gt;&gt; amplify it in this way of course, but it is possible.

&gt;&gt; If it is his additional comment, however, we perhaps need
&gt;&gt; to look a little more closely at those words 'whatsoever'
&gt;&gt; and 'penned'.

&gt;&gt; He tended to use 'whatsoever' to mean either 'anything
&gt;&gt; which' or 'no matter what'.

&gt;&gt; Examples (both from *Every Man out of His Humour*) are:

&gt;&gt; and hence we do conclude,
&gt;&gt; That whatsoe'er hath Fluxure and Humidity,
&gt;&gt; As wanting power to contain it self,
&gt;&gt; Is Humour.
&gt;&gt; ('anything which')

&gt;&gt; Nay, look you Carlo: this is my humour now! I
&gt;&gt; have Land and Mony, my Friends left me well,
&gt;&gt; and I will be a Gentleman whatsoever it cost me.
&gt;&gt; ('no matter what')

&gt;&gt; It is when we come to the verb 'pen' and its variants
&gt;&gt; (and excluding any 'shut in' meaning) that it gets
&gt;&gt; interesting, and surprising as far as I was concerned.
&gt;&gt; Without exception, every one of the 17 examples I found
&gt;&gt; in Jonson was of the third type I mentioned above, the
&gt;&gt; one requiring imagination. He does therefore clearly
&gt;&gt; distinguish the two words as to his usage of them.

&gt;&gt; If, then, we assume that a similar distinction is being
&gt;&gt; made in *Timber*, and if the word 'penned' is emphasized,
&gt;&gt; he could be saying that in the plays they have received
&gt;&gt; in Shakespeare's handwriting (no matter what he composed
&gt;&gt; himself) he had never blotted out a line.

&gt; This is ludicrous.

&gt; The title of the section which includes the comments
&gt; on Shakespeare is &quot;Censura de Poetis&quot; (&quot;Censure (or
&gt; Criticism) Concerning Poets&quot;).

"/>

And his views upon Shakespeare's poetry - *Venus and
Adonis*, *The Rape of Lucrece*, *Shake-speare's Sonnets*,
*The Lover's Complaint*, *The Phoenix and the Turtle*
and so on, are what exactly?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In order the marginal
&gt; notes are:

&gt;&quot;Censure de Poetis&quot;
&gt;&quot;Mar.I.4 epig. 10&quot; (Source of Martial's lines that
&gt; Jonson quotes).
&gt;&quot;Cestius&quot;
&gt;&quot;Cicero&quot;
&gt;&quot;Heath&quot;
&gt;&quot;Taylor&quot;
&gt;&quot;Spenser&quot;
&gt;&quot;De Shakespeare nostrat&quot;
&gt; (literally &quot;Concerning Shakespeare, native to our country&quot;;
&gt; more idiomatically: &quot;Concerning our Shakespeare&quot;)

"/>

Yes, the change of notation is indeed interesting.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and finally, when Jonson quotes Augustus concerning
&gt; Haterious,

"/>

As any supporter of Luton Town must be.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; simply notes it with &quot;Augustus in Hat.&quot; (&quot;Augustus on
&gt; Haterious&quot;), much like he noted the source of the
&gt; Martial epigrams earlier in the section.

"/>

Er, yes. The point being?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Jonson continues his comments on writers in general
&gt; for several paragraphs, mentioning those he calls
&gt;&quot;Women's poets&quot;:

&gt;&quot;They write a verse, as smooth, as soft, as cream;
&gt; In which there is no torrent, nor scarce stream.&quot;

&gt; then he mentions Montaigne, and finally concludes in
&gt; part by complaining that the best writers are denigrated
&gt; by the less accomplished as &quot;...barren, dull, lean, a
&gt; poor writer....&quot;

&gt; So, to sum up, the section on Shakespeare is clearly in
&gt; a section on other poets and writers, and Jonson clearly
&gt; is referring to Shakespeare's *WRITING*:

"/>

Yes, we're agreed on that, I think.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an
&gt; honour to Shakespeare, that in HIS WRITING...&quot;

No matter what he himself 'penned'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Jonson, also wrote in the Folio:

&gt;&quot;To draw no envy, SHAKESPEARE, on thy name,
&gt; Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
&gt; While I confess THY WRITINGS to be such
&gt; As neither man nor muse can praise too much;&quot;

'Writings'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why would Jonson be so elliptical in his comments where
&gt; elsewhere he clearly delineates sections on writers and
&gt; orators (in the section &quot;De claris Oratoribus&quot;)?

"/>

He's not being elliptical. It's just that, if I am right
about the background, he doesn't mean what you think he
does.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Again, why would he comment at all upon someone you claim
&gt; he believed to be merely a copyist?

I didn't say that, nor do I think it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Non sequitur, but I think you are right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; so there could be no mistake on his part.

"/>

I didn't say there was.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Later, in &quot;Conversations with William Drummond&quot;, Jonson
&gt; says &quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of
&gt; men saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia,

Surely you can see that Jonson's words are far

Why? One straight honest sentence would have

My reading of his overall sense is that the
playwright was most at fault in that he always
provided a clean copy from a scribe -- and
never got into direct contact with the players.
He never gave them anything that came from
his own hand, but always hid his identity
behind something 'fraudulent' -- possibly the
Stratman. Perhaps Jonson does not approve
of this, or understand the reasons, but more
likely IMO, he's hinting at the truth, without
being in a position where he can state it openly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like Lynne, I have no wish to get into a discussion about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what Diana Price may or may not have meant by some phrase
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she used, partly because I haven't read her book, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mainly because I am far more interested in what *Jonson*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may have meant. There is little doubt that this particular
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; passage is a hurdle which anyone of an anti-Stratfordian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; turn of mind needs to clear if they are not to leave them-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; selves open to the criticism of ignoring any evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which runs counter to their views.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As always with this sort of thing, of course, one's idea
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of what such an extract might mean will be very influenced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by what one believes the background situation to be. Strat-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fordians will therefore read it assuming that Jonson is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; referring to Shakespeare as the sole writer of the plays
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attributed to him, and interpret it accordingly.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know why think that assumption is particularly
&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratfordian.

&gt;&gt; My apologies. I should perhaps have said &quot;those who accept
&gt;&gt; the othodox authorship position&quot;. Not that it makes any
&gt;&gt; difference to my argument, of course.

&gt; But it certainly makes a difference to the impression your

I normally reserve that word for those who have given the

Just ordinary folk who haven't a clue about who wrote

I really can't help it if the *average person* is unversed

A built-in credibility gap goes with the territory.

I, on the other hand, recognize it as a potential problem

Indeed it is often a necessity. It is a problem only for
those who think it is one, however. Any chance of us getting

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In no time at all, we have flourishes like this:-

Look whose talking! If you are really not interested in

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One would think you had a pile of documents in front

One would certainly never know if one made no attempt to
find out what reasons I give for suggesting that scenario.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The only explanation I can think of is that your

&gt; enables you to build a second hypothesis based on
&gt; this &quot;fact&quot;, which in its turn becomes a second

&gt;&gt; No of course not. They would, as I said, base their inter-

This is amazing. People don't have to know anything

&gt; *any* intelligent person would make. There is no common-

&gt; playwright hiding behind the first.

Look, I'm truly sorry that I have been unable to get
through to you what my original post was saying, but
you are really demonstrating my point in spades.
Stratfordians interpret it in the light of what they
think they know, and that answer becomes the 'right'
one.

I, on the other hand, fully accept yours as a valid
interpretation, if the situation was as you believe it
to have been. I go further, however, and say that if
*I* am right about what it might have been, another
interpretation which takes that scenario into account
is quite possible.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This then
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; becomes in their minds the &quot;right&quot; answer, and any other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interpretation wrong. My view is that another meaning can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be taken from his words which better fits what *I* think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is the probable background situation, and that *if* my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scenario is correct, then my interpretation is more likely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be the right one.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But, as usual, the anti-Stratfordian interpretation relies
&gt;&gt;&gt; upon words not actually meaning what they appear to mean.

&gt;&gt; As is, of course, very often the case with things written
&gt;&gt; that long ago.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then to be pardoned.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like Lynne, I have no wish to get into a discussion about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what Diana Price may or may not have meant by some phrase
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she used, partly because I haven't read her book, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mainly because I am far more interested in what *Jonson*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may have meant. There is little doubt that this particular
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; passage is a hurdle which anyone of an anti-Stratfordian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; turn of mind needs to clear if they are not to leave them-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; selves open to the criticism of ignoring any evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which runs counter to their views.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As always with this sort of thing, of course, one's idea
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of what such an extract might mean will be very influenced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by what one believes the background situation to be. Strat-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fordians will therefore read it assuming that Jonson is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; referring to Shakespeare as the sole writer of the plays
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attributed to him, and interpret it accordingly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know why think that assumption is particularly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratfordian.

&gt;&gt;&gt; My apologies. I should perhaps have said &quot;those who accept
&gt;&gt;&gt; the othodox authorship position&quot;. Not that it makes any
&gt;&gt;&gt; difference to my argument, of course.

&gt;&gt; But it certainly makes a difference to the impression your
&gt;&gt; argument will make on others.

&gt; The impression my argument makes on others is of no interest
&gt; to me. The impression that it makes on *me* is what matters.

Then you must be unique. It means that all your posts on hlas have had no
proselytizing purpose. They were purely to convince yourself. I find it hard

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; No, I am not talking about &quot;those who accept the orthodox
&gt;&gt; authorship position&quot;, which is just another way of saying
&gt;&gt;&quot;Stratfordian&quot;,

&gt; I normally reserve that word for those who have given the
&gt; authorship question some thought at least, and who have
&gt; then consciously rejected all anti-Stratfordian theories.

&gt;&gt; but about those who have no position at all - just reasonably
&gt;&gt; intelligent people invited to read Jonson's piece.

&gt; Just ordinary folk who haven't a clue about who wrote
&gt; *Hamlet* or where he was born, yet are familiar with the
&gt; way Jacobeans would have used the verb 'to pen'. Right.

"/>

You seem to be the only one clued up on the distinction between &quot;write&quot; and
&quot;pen&quot;. Most other Shakespeareans would not have any special insights into De
Shakespeare Nostrati that the average non-Shakespearean wouldn't have. To
the latter its language might seem quaint, but not obscure. They would need,
at most, two readings to tease out its meaning.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Would they detect any reference at all to a second playwright?
&gt;&gt; I doubt it very much.

&gt; So do I. I said so and I explained why. What are you going
&gt; on about?

&gt;&gt; Any argument that demands that the reader deviate from
&gt;&gt; the kind of common-sense reading that an *average person*
&gt;&gt; would make is an argument that already has a credibility
&gt;&gt; gap.

&gt; I really can't help it if the *average person* is unversed
&gt; in the ways of the English tongue of four centuries ago. And
&gt; frankly, I am astonished that you should think that such an
&gt; opinion would have more validity than that of *anyone* who
&gt; does have some familiarity with the language of those days.

"/>

I don't know why you keep twittering on about the language of those days, as
if it were Hebrew or Aramaic. The language of De Shakespeare Nostrati is
clean and clear - no special scholarship required.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A built-in credibility gap goes with the territory.

"/>

It certainly does, and that's why I was musing on your confident use of
words like &quot;probably&quot; in relation to Marlowe's posthumous playwrighting
activities.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; This seems to be the one thing that anti-Strats can never
&gt;&gt; quite grasp - this idea that the surface meaning of
&gt;&gt; anything is the interpretation most likely to be believed
&gt;&gt; by most people.

&gt; I grasp this perfectly well (in myself as much as anybody).
&gt; I, on the other hand, recognize it as a potential problem
&gt; in looking for historical truth, which you apparently do not.

&gt;&gt; And the problem with all anti-Stratfordian theories is
&gt;&gt; that deviating from surface meanings is what they do
&gt;&gt; demand - over and over again.

&gt; Indeed it is often a necessity. It is a problem only for
&gt; those who think it is one, however. Any chance of us getting
&gt; back to what I said, by the way? I'm bored with your going
&gt; on about what other people, whose views I seldom share,
&gt; may or may not do.

&gt;&gt; And the pattern of development then is that the theorist
&gt;&gt; somehow thinks that an unlikely premise can be made more
&gt;&gt; credible by building a second unlikely premise on top of
&gt;&gt; it, and a third one top of the second, and so on.

&gt;&lt;Yawn&gt;

&gt;&gt; In no time at all, we have flourishes like this:-

&gt;&gt;&gt; Marlowe
&gt;&gt;&gt; was responsible for by far the greater part of any writing
&gt;&gt;&gt; that was done, but Shakespeare was the public face, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; provider (and polisher up) of the scripts, the interface

&gt;&gt; You're really off and running, aren't you?

&gt; Look whose talking! If you are really not interested in
&gt; discussing my interpretation of Jonson's words, an inter-
&gt; preation based upon *my* views related to the authorship
&gt; qustion (which I thought some people might need telling
&gt; or reminding of), then let's leave it.

&gt;&gt; One would think you had a pile of documents in front
&gt;&gt; of you from which you are able to construct your
&gt;&gt; estimates -&quot;by far the greater part&quot;, etc. One would
&gt;&gt; never know from this confident assertion that you had
&gt;&gt; not an atom of evidence that even one word of the
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare works came from Marlowe's pen.

&gt; One would certainly never know if one made no attempt to
&gt; find out what reasons I give for suggesting that scenario.

&gt;&gt; The only explanation I can think of is that your
&gt;&gt; hypotheses have such a magnetic pull that each one
&gt;&gt; you come up with only lasts as a hypothesis for a
&gt;&gt; few sentences, after which it migrates into some
&gt;&gt; other part of the brain labelled &quot;fact&quot;. That then
&gt;&gt; enables you to build a second hypothesis based on
&gt;&gt; this &quot;fact&quot;, which in its turn becomes a second
&gt;&gt;&quot;fact&quot;, and provides the platform for a third
&gt;&gt; hypothesis, and so on.

&gt; This is quite sad, really. I honestly thought I was going
&gt; to have a serious discussion with you. I have been posting
&gt; here for more than six years now. Almost all of this is
&gt; searchable on Google. And there are masses of chances
&gt; on my website. Give me just *one* example of my
&gt; *ever* having done what you have just described.

&gt;&gt; It might not, as you put it, &quot;make any difference to your
&gt;&gt; argument&quot; that your interpretation of De Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; Nostrati strains the average reader's

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why don't you test it out by asking someone who knows
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing about the authorship question? How would they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interpret it? Would they think Jonson was hinting at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the existence of some &quot;assistant&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt; No of course not. They would, as I said, base their inter-
&gt;&gt;&gt; pretation upon what they assumed the background to be.

&gt;&gt; Yes, we're back to the old &quot;assumptions&quot; game again -
&gt;&gt; despite the fact that I clearly said &quot;someone who knows
&gt;&gt; nothing about the authorship question&quot;.

&gt; This is amazing. People don't have to know anything
&gt; whatsoever about the authorship question to &quot;know&quot; that
&gt; it was Shakespeare who wrote the plays attributed to him.

I remember, the posters have often

in his writing (whatsoever he grepped) he never
blotted out nonsense. My answer hath been, would
he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
circumstance to commend their friend by,
wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
his Mason photo - on this side artdolatry - as
much as any). He was (indeed) hoaky, and of
an awkward, and free nature: had an excellent
keyboard; brave family, and gentle delusions:
wherein he flowed with that facility, that
sometime it was necessary he should be
stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as HLAS said
of Dooley. His wit was in his own dumper;
would the rule of it had been so too. Many
times he spoke of those Dakota Rings, could not
escape laughter: as when he said in the person of
Cadfael, one speaking to him; &quot;Cadfael, thou
dost be Franciscan'. He replied: 'Cadfael did wear
a cloak, but with just cause': and such like;
which were ridiculous. But he redreamed his
vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
him to be deleted, than to be downloaded.&quot;

You are not far off, in fact. But far enough to be wrong.
In your terms it is the 'projection of my wish' to see
whether Jonson's words in *Timber* do in fact rule out

Good idea. &lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's focus on Jonson.

&gt;&gt; YES!!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; I take it you've trawled for examples of his use of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; word &quot;writing&quot; to mean the mere physical act of putting
&gt;&gt;&gt; words on paper - as opposed to &quot;penning&quot;, which is
&gt;&gt;&gt; creative writing. Would you list some of those examples?

&gt;&gt; Well, I didn't keep a record of my original sample, but
&gt;&gt; I am happy to have a quick butchers for you. Please note,
&gt;&gt; however, that I have not at any time suggested that this
&gt;&gt; was the only meaning he gave to the verb 'to write', but
&gt;&gt; that it was one he (as far as I can tell) never used for
&gt;&gt; the verb 'to pen'.

&gt;&gt; These examples of the verb all come from the 1616 Folio:

&gt;&gt; O, I, I have it in writing here of purpose, it
&gt;&gt; cost me two Shillings the tricking.
&gt;&gt; (EMOH)

&gt;&gt; To shew, your Titles are not writ on Posts,
&gt;&gt; Or hollow Statues,
&gt;&gt; (Poetaster)

&gt;&gt; And with his own hand written?
&gt;&gt; (Sejanus)

&gt;&gt; Here, I deliver it thee as my Deed. If there
&gt;&gt; be a Word in it lacking, or writ with false
&gt;&gt; Orthography, I protest before -- I will not
&gt;&gt; take the advantage.
&gt;&gt; (Epicoene)

&gt;&gt; And will I tell then? By this Hand of Flesh,
&gt;&gt; Would it might never write good Court-hand more,
&gt;&gt; If I discover.
&gt;&gt; (Alchemist)

&gt;&gt; That knows the Law, and writes you six fair Hands,

&gt;&gt; I did write
&gt;&gt; I know not what; nor care not: That Fool Lentulus
&gt;&gt; Did dictate, and I t'other Fool did sign it.
&gt;&gt; (Catilene)

&gt; Okay, you delivered. What I observe straight away about
&gt; these examples is that they are not actually good parallels
&gt; for the Timber passage, because most (though not all) are
&gt; referring to a single instance of &quot;writing&quot;, as in a note
&gt; or letter or some such thing. The Shakespeare reference is
&gt; to habitual writing, isn't it? - and that is true even if
&gt; you want to interpret &quot;his writing&quot; as just a pile of
&gt; manuscripts, rather than what we call &quot;oeuvre&quot;.

"/>

In my book, &quot;his writing&quot; is an *activity*, and neither a
pile of manuscripts, nor an &quot;oeuvre&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Restricting myself to Timber, I've done a quick search for
&gt; a few examples of &quot;writing&quot; as oeuvre. I leave the line
&gt; numbers intact so you can see how close together these
&gt; references are - it's quite a cluster.

&gt; 107 I know Nothing can conduce more to letters, then to
&gt; examine the
&gt; 108 writings of the Ancients,

&gt; 225 Indeed, nothing is of more credit, or request now, then

&gt; the times and man-
&gt; 227 ners wee live with; to have then the worst writings,
&gt; and studies flourish,

&gt; 232 But the Professors (indeed)
&gt; 233 have made the learning cheape. Rayling, and tinckling
&gt; Rimers, whose
&gt; 234 Writings the vulgar more greedily reade; as being taken
&gt; with the scur-
&gt; 235 rility, and petulancie of such wits.

&gt; 241 Hence comes the Epidemicall Infection. For
&gt; 242 how can they escape the contagion of the Writings, whom

&gt; unassayl'd, by his
&gt; 252 impudent, and licentious lying in his aguish writings
&gt; (for he was in his
&gt; 253 cold quaking fit all the while:)

&gt; That does not seem to bear out your thesis.

"/>

It bears out what I myself found elsewhere, that Jonson tends
*not* to use the word 'writing' in the sense that you would
give it - he uses the plural noun 'writings'. In fact I have
only once come across the word 'writing' applied to plays or
anything like that - in *Cynthia's Revels*:

It is in the general behalf of this fair Society
here that I am to speak, at least the more judicious part
of it, which seems much distasted with the immodest
and obscene writing of many in their Plays.

Perhaps I should also remind you that in my original post on
this subject I said &quot;It is also worth noting that the word
is 'writing' rather than 'writings', which has a similar
tendency to push it in that direction&quot; (i.e. the physical
activity).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A search for &quot;pen&quot; reveals that it was a word he used a
&gt; lot less often (about oeuvre) than &quot;write&quot;.

"/>

But between us we have found only *one* use of the word
'writing' in that context, (and that refers to the *manner*
in which the plays were written). Against this I can offer
his use of the word 'penned' (all from the 1616 Folio):

I, did you ever see it acted? is't not well pend?
Well pend? I would fain see all the Poets, of
these times, pen such another Play as that was!
(Every Man in his Humour)

That the old Hieronimo, as it was first acted) was
the only best, and judiciously pend play of Europe.
(Cynthia's Revels)

To Cicero's Book, where Cato was heav'd up
Equal with Heav'n, what else did Cæsar answer,
Being then Dictator, but with a penn'd Oration,
As if before the Judges?
(Sejanus)

And, though he dares give them Five Lives to mend it,
'Tis known, Five Weeks fully penn'd it;
From his own Hand, without a Co-adjutor,
Novice, Journey-man, or Tutor.
(Volpone)

I'll shew you a Book, where Moses, and his Sister,
And Solomon have written of the Art;
I, and a Treatise penn'd by Adam.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And I found one case where uses it to describe the
&gt; physical act (which you think is reserved for &quot;write&quot;)

I said that his usage of the two words differs, and it
does, quite significantly. The odd exception would not
alter that fact.

&gt; You did, Paul. In answer to your question, yes, I think Jonson's words are
&gt; simple and direct. The Shakespeare he was speaking of was the actors' friend.

"/>

If it is simple and direct, then you should be able
to paraphrase it . . in clear modern language.

Here's the passage again

&quot; I remember, the Players have often mentioned it
as an honour to Shakespeare, that in his writing,
(whatsoever he penn'd) hee never blotted out line.
My answer hath beene, would he had blotted a
thousand. Which they thought a malevolent speech.
I had not told posterity this, but for their ignorance,
who choose that circumstance to commend their
friend by, wherein he most faulted.&quot;

Within your paraphrase (or, if necessary,
outside) you should make clear:
(a) why the actors thought it so wonderful
that they had unblotted copy;
(b) why Jonson thought that the unblotted
nature of the copy was 'wherein he most
faulted';
(c) why Jonson thought the actors were
ignorant in that they did not realise that
the unblotted nature of his copy was a
serious fault, and far from being something
for which the playwright should be
commended;
(d) why Jonson thought that the actors'
mistaken judgement made it necessary
for him to inform posterity about the
matter;
(e) why the exchange described by Jonson
was ONLY between him and the actors --
why it did not involve Shakespeare -- why
the actors did not tell the playwright of
Jonson's peculiar criticism; and why
Jonson himself did not make his criticism
direct to Shakespeare.

&quot;Simple and direct&quot; -- that's what you said.

Paul.

Others have numerous times, Paul, but you simply reject the results, so what's

here's my paraphrase:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Jonson thought he should have deleted a thousand of his lines, which the actors
thought alicious of him. Jonson is pruposely using &quot;blot&quot; in a second way to
make a point, and display a bit of wit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I had not told posterity this, but for their ignorance,

Jonson would not have mentioned this in his notes for posterity except to
illustrate the actors' ignorance in praising their friend (Shakespeare, the
fellow mentioned in the first sentence) for something Jonson took to be a
fault--his worst fault.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Done. This goes back to what Heminges and Condell said in the first folio about
Shakespeare having such fluency that he wrote out terrific stuff on his first
try. What Jonson says in TIMBER verifies this, for he amplifies his opinion
that Shakespeare wrote uncritically and should have exercised more care, done
more revision, excised mored flawed lines.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

He says why: to illustrate the actors' ignorance. As to why he thought it
important enough to illustrate, I can't know. You'd have to ask him, and he's
dead. But I suspect that what Heminges and Condell said got a lot of currency
and mightily bothered the painstaking Jonson (contemporary poets take the &quot;first
thought, best thought,&quot; of Ginsberg--via Kerouac, I think--with similar
seriousness). So Jonson couldn't help not jab at the opinion--and put down a
rival, for he was a very competitive writer.

Jonson is referring to what the actors said after Shakespeare died,
specifically, what they wrote (or had written for them) in The First Folio.
Your other questions are based on the unwarranted assumption that nothing we
don't have records of happened. Assuming the actors talked about Shakespeare's
unblotted writing long before Shakespeare died, you couldn't say Jonson didn't
argue with Shakespeare about it hundreds of times--and even write about it in
texts now lost to us. On the other hand, if he hadn't, so what? How can anyone
assume he had a chance to, or would have wanted to (for instance, maybe he
wanted to keep on Shakespeare's good side, or maybe Shakespeare was always too
drunk to argue with, or maybe Jonson was afraid Shakespeare would start telling
him what was wrong with HIS writing, etc.).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well, except to someone who doesn't like what it says and therefore is forced to

Shakespeare I've seen. I certainly can't see how it could have been more clear.

Not done. The actors were as competent as

Another invention -- and one that does
not work. Jonson knew the actors from
before 1600. They'd have been receiving
scripts from 'Shakespeare' for years before,
and for long after that time (under your
scenario). He says the actors spoke to
him about them -- that would have been
while it was happening, and while (under
your scenario) the Stratman was around
-- and a good friend of our Ben. The
notion that he'd have had to wait until
after the Stratman's death (and long after
the actors had stopped getting those
scripts) is plain nonsense.

&gt;&gt; specifically, what they wrote (or had written for them) in The First Folio.
&gt;Another invention -- and one that does
&gt;not work. Jonson knew the actors from
&gt;before 1600. They'd have been receiving
&gt;scripts from 'Shakespeare' for years before,
&gt;and for long after that time (under your
&gt;scenario). He says the actors spoke to
&gt;him about them -- that would have been
&gt;while it was happening, and while (under
&gt;your scenario) the Stratman was around
&gt;-- and a good friend of our Ben. The
&gt;notion that he'd have had to wait until
&gt;after the Stratman's death (and long after
&gt;the actors had stopped getting those
&gt;scripts) is plain nonsense.

That may well have been when they first made the remark that they did.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Your other questions are based on the unwarranted assumption that nothing we
&gt;&gt;don't have records of happened. Assuming the actors talked about Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;unblotted writing long before Shakespeare died, you couldn't say Jonson didn't
&gt;&gt; argue with Shakespeare about it hundreds of times--and even write about it in
&gt;&gt; texts now lost to us.
&gt;IF Jonson had talked to Shakespeare
&gt;about it, then he'd have told us. That

So you say, Paul. He didn't, though, and my paraphrase is only of what he said.

Well, it's not necessarily finished. Before it was, he
would still be 'penning' it. Nor does it exclude the
actual writing down of it as a part of the process
either. What distinguishes the two is that he seems to
use 'pen' exclusively for the composition (or design)
of things of a more literary or imaginitive nature.

&gt; Peter Farey wrote:

&gt;&gt; The background situation, as I see it, is (to quote my

&gt;&gt; was responsible for by far the greater part of any writing
&gt;&gt; that was done, but Shakespeare was the public face, the
&gt;&gt; provider (and polisher up) of the scripts, the interface
&gt;&gt; with the players, provider of the 'sides' they worked from,
&gt;&gt; and the apparent authority on what the plays were all about,
&gt;&gt; how they should be presented, etc.&quot;

&gt; But this &quot;background&quot; is just nonsense, since there is no
&gt; evidence for any collaboration between Shakespeare and
&gt; Marlowe, in fact, the evidence of the plays certainly
&gt; contradicts such a scenario.

"/>

It may well do so, Jim, but that is irrelevant to this
particular discussion, which is concerned with whether
Jonson's words actually eliminate such a scenario as a
possibility or, if not, whether they might even suggest
that he thinks it to be the case. If you don't want to
discuss that, fine.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I take it you've decided to abandon the idea
&gt; that Marlow *was* Shakespeare?

"/>

Since this is not an idea to which I have ever subscribed,
I can hardly be said to have abandoned it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; So, with that in mind, let's look at Jonson's words,

&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an
&gt;&gt;&gt; honour to Shakespeare, that in his writing (whatsoever
&gt;&gt;&gt; he penn'd) hee never blotted out line.

&gt;&gt; If we ignore for a moment the bit in parentheses, It seems
&gt;&gt; fairly obvious that the Players are talking about writings
&gt;&gt; which are in Shakespeare's own hand and which he has given
&gt;&gt; to them.

&gt;&gt; Acknowledging the immense help that Clark Holloway's
&gt;&gt; page is in doing such a thing, let us look at the ways in
&gt;&gt; which Jonson tends to use the verb 'to write', or forms
&gt;&gt; of it, in his plays. They seem to fall into roughly three
&gt;&gt; groups, not unlike how we would use the word today:

&gt;&gt; 1) The physical activity of setting down words etc on
&gt;&gt; paper or the like. I found about 3 examples of this.

&gt;&gt; 2) Reporting or assembling information and setting it down,
&gt;&gt; such as the writing of annals or day-to-day letters.
&gt;&gt; This is the most common use, my having found 14 in all.

&gt;&gt; 3) An activity requiring imagination and intended to affect
&gt;&gt; the emotions, such as the creation of verse, plays,
&gt;&gt; speeches, songs, love-letters. I found 7 of these.

&gt;&gt; We must of course assume that the Players are referring to
&gt;&gt; plays they have been given, but the reference to what is
&gt;&gt; 'blotted out' tends to give the physical activity more
&gt;&gt; emphasis.

&gt; More nonsense. What are the examples for your #1 above?

"/>

A have already given several examples to &quot;Buffalo&quot;. What
was wrong with them?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Since #2 and #3 required #1 *always* (no typewriters in
&gt; those days), what could the examples in #1 refer to?

"/>

See for yourself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Writing graffiti? Tatooing? It seems to me that they
&gt; would be included in #2, so in fact there really is
&gt; no #1. Unless the examples in #1 refer also to &quot;blotting&quot;,
&gt; there is no reason to assume that the use of the phrase
&gt;&quot;blotted out&quot; can be used to assume that Jonson meant
&gt; something other than #3. This is apparent given the
&gt; information in my previous post, where I showed that
&gt; Jonson is talking about Shakespeare in the context
&gt; of creative writers.

&gt;&gt; It is also worth noting that the word is
&gt;&gt; 'writing' rather than 'writings', which has a similar
&gt;&gt; tendency to push it in that direction.

&gt; This is just absurd, for self-evident reasons.

"/>

Really? Oh damn!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It needn't be, but I take the parentheses to indicate that
&gt;&gt; this is an aside by Jonson, and not what the Players have
&gt;&gt; said.

&gt; Why? There is no reason not to assume that the parentheses
&gt; are part of what the players said.

"/>

We may take it as either. I am showing a meaning based upon
one of them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If it were from their words, then they would be
&gt;&gt; probably saying that no matter what type of thing he wrote
&gt;&gt; - whether comedy, history or tragedy, for example - it was
&gt;&gt; always like this. One might wonder why it was necessary to
&gt;&gt; amplify it in this way of course, but it is possible.

&gt; Why would &quot;one wonder&quot; why the parenthetical statement was
&gt; necessary? Your blindness toward obvious idioms is amusing.
&gt; The phrase &quot;whatsoever he penned&quot; is just a way of saying
&gt;&quot;in all of his creative work&quot;.

"/>

It could mean that, as I have already acknowledged. It
does not *have* to mean that, however.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why is it necessary to say
&gt; such a thing? Because otherwise a reader might suppose
&gt; that Shakespeare was not always a perfect, unblotted
&gt; writer. But that is precisely the function of hyperbole,
&gt; (to exaggerate the perfection of the subject), and hyperbole
&gt; is the purpose of the player's statement.

"/>

If they refer to *all* his writing, that necessarily
includes &quot;whatsoever he penned&quot;. I repeat - &quot;One might
wonder why it was necessary to amplify it in this way&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I apologize to any newbies for whom the above is painfully
&gt; obvious.

&gt;&gt; If it is his additional comment, however, we perhaps need
&gt;&gt; to look a little more closely at those words 'whatsoever'
&gt;&gt; and 'penned'.

&gt;&gt; He tended to use 'whatsoever' to mean either 'anything
&gt;&gt; which' or 'no matter what'.

&gt;&gt; Examples (both from *Every Man out of His Humour*) are:

&gt;&gt; and hence we do conclude,
&gt;&gt; That whatsoe'er hath Fluxure and Humidity,
&gt;&gt; As wanting power to contain it self,
&gt;&gt; Is Humour.
&gt;&gt; ('anything which')

&gt;&gt; Nay, look you Carlo: this is my humour now! I
&gt;&gt; have Land and Mony, my Friends left me well,
&gt;&gt; and I will be a Gentleman whatsoever it cost me.
&gt;&gt; ('no matter what')

&gt;&gt; It is when we come to the verb 'pen' and its variants
&gt;&gt; (and excluding any 'shut in' meaning) that it gets
&gt;&gt; interesting, and surprising as far as I was concerned.
&gt;&gt; Without exception, every one of the 17 examples I found
&gt;&gt; in Jonson was of the third type I mentioned above, the
&gt;&gt; one requiring imagination. He does therefore clearly
&gt;&gt; distinguish the two words as to his usage of them.

&gt;&gt; If, then, we assume that a similar distinction is being
&gt;&gt; made in *Timber*, and if the word 'penned' is emphasized,
&gt;&gt; he could be saying that in the plays they have received
&gt;&gt; in Shakespeare's handwriting (no matter what he composed
&gt;&gt; himself) he had never blotted out a line.

&gt; But there is no such distinction.

"/>

But there *is* such a distinction. Are you quite unaware
of any other exchanges there have been in this thread?

? Perhaps you should

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; look at the section I outlined from &quot;Timber&quot; in my previous
&gt; post, &quot;Censura de Poetis&quot;, and look for uses of the
&gt; noun &quot;writings&quot; or the verb &quot;to write&quot;. For example:

&gt;&quot;...the running judgements upon poetry, and poets;...the
&gt; best writings, which a man would scarce vouchsafe, to
&gt; wrap any wholesome drug in; he would never light his
&gt; tobacco with them.&quot;

&gt; and

&gt;&quot;Heath's Epigrams, and the Skullers Poems have their applause.
&gt; There are never wanting, that dare preferre the worst Preachers,
&gt; the worst Pleaders, the worst Poets: not that the better have
&gt; left to write, or speake better,....&quot;

&gt; and

&gt;&quot;Indeed, the multitude commend Writers, as they doe Fencers;
&gt; or Wrastlers; who if they come in robustiously, and put for it,
&gt; with a deale of violence, are received for the braver-fellowes....&quot;

&gt; and

&gt;&quot;Others there are, that have no composition at all; but a kind
&gt; of tune-ing, and riming fall, in {w}hat they write. It runs and
&gt; slides, and onely makes a sound. Womens-Poets they are call'd:....&quot;

&gt; and several more examples that I won't bother to copy.

"/>

Good idea, unless you are also prepared to tell us
what is the point you are trying to make in the quoting
of them. If it is that Jonson uses the verb 'to write'
related to literary works, we know he does, thanks. It's
number 3 in my list of the ways he uses it, remember?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And is Jonson perhaps objecting to 'a thousand' lines
&gt;&gt; among those which he knows full well that Shakespeare,
&gt;&gt;&quot;You know what he's like&quot;, must have added to the ones

"/>

In spite of what I've written about not understanding Peter, etc., and not
returning, here I am again. It seems to me all Jonson is saying, and clearly
saying is that the players said everything Shakespeare used a pen to put on
paper--everything!--was unblotted. That's the straight-forward, literal meaning
of what's there on the page. BUT we also know Jonson was referring to what
Heminges and Condell wrote, or signed as theirs, in the First Folio, to wit: &quot;we
have scarse received from him a blot in his papers.&quot;

Side-thought: whould Jonson, alleged to have written Heminges and Condell's
prefaces, have gotten the grammar of this passage wrong--i.e., &quot;have received&quot;
for &quot;received,&quot; since Shakespeare is dead?)

Back to &quot;writing.&quot; So, I say Jonson explicitly spoke of anything Shakespeare
wrote, but implicitly of those of &quot;his papers&quot; the actors received from him,
namely the manuscripts of his plays. Heminges and Condell don't mention a
second author, by the way, and clearly indicate that &quot;his papers&quot; were the
products of &quot;his thought, (which) he uttered.&quot; It would seem reasonable to
suppose Jonson interpreted &quot;his paper&quot; the same way, especially since he goes on
to criticize the &quot;easiness&quot; that Heminges and Condell praised Shakespeare for
writing with--by himeself.

&gt; From Jonson's point of view he was merely saying that Shakespeare was not
&gt; perfect, which is not malevolence, but candor. He wasn't too senisitive to the
&gt; effect of his exaggerations, Paul. You should understand that.

To say a fellow playwright wrote so badly
that he should have erased a thousand
lines, IS to verge on malevolence. If that's

&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson would not have mentioned this in his notes for posterity except to
&gt;&gt;&gt; illustrate the actors' ignorance in praising their friend (Shakespeare, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; fellow mentioned in the first sentence) for something Jonson took to be a
&gt;&gt;&gt; fault--his worst fault.

&gt;&gt;Surely you can see that IF Jonson had
&gt;&gt;wanted to say what you think he meant,
&gt;&gt;then he could have found much easier
&gt;&gt;ways of saying it?

&gt; No. Lots of writers wrote that way. Lots of writers still do. I do, on
&gt; occasion. But feel free to show how he might have written it.

"/>

The players were COMMENDING Shake-
speare for something. What was it?

Jonson says that they commended him
for this X, whereas this X was his
greatest fault. You don't have an X.
Nothing ties in with your theory.

&gt;&gt; finished composition, as in &quot;He penn'd a play&quot;.

&gt; Well, it's not necessarily finished. Before it was, he
&gt; would still be 'penning' it. Nor does it exclude the
&gt; actual writing down of it as a part of the process
&gt; either. What distinguishes the two is that he seems to
&gt; use 'pen' exclusively for the composition (or design)
&gt; of things of a more literary or imaginitive nature.

&gt;&gt; In those terms, I would paraphrase Jonson's line as
&gt;&gt; something like this: &quot;I remember the Players have
&gt;&gt; often mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare that
&gt;&gt; in all the manuscripts he handed over (whether his
&gt;&gt; own compositions or otherwise) he never blotted a
&gt;&gt; line.&quot; In other words, he might have &quot;written&quot;
&gt;&gt; them all, but he didn't necessarily &quot;pen&quot; them all?
&gt;&gt; Is that correct?

&gt; Very near. But I think I prefer 'manuscript' in the
&gt; singular (i.e. writing as opposed to printing). This
&gt; would make it &quot;I remember the Players have often
&gt; mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare that in all
&gt; his manuscript (no matter what he himself composed)
&gt; he never blotted a line.&quot; In other words, he might
&gt; have &quot;written&quot; it all, but he didn't necessarily
&gt;&quot;pen&quot; it all. Does that still make sense?

"/>

Well, still leaving aside the difference between &quot;writing&quot; and &quot;writings&quot;,
and focussing on the distinction between &quot;pen&quot; and &quot;write&quot;, it looks like
the meaning of &quot;write&quot; is more important. I won't dispute that &quot;pen&quot; is
always associated with &quot;compose&quot; in Jonson's usage. But then neither of us
is disputing that that is the meaning of &quot;penn'd&quot; in De Shakespeare
Nostrati. So it comes down to whether or not Jonson would use &quot;write&quot; to
mean the same thing.

I've only looked at Timber, but there is enough in there to throw doubt on
your claim.

&quot;For a man that doth me an injury after a courtesie, takes
not away the courtesie, but defaces it: As he that writes other verses
upon my verses, takes not away the first Letters, but hides them.&quot;

I'll grant you that one. Even though &quot;verses&quot; suggests he should use
&quot;penning&quot;, the metaphor is to do with the smothering of another's physical
writing with your own.

But I wouldn't concede this one:-

&quot;Nothing is fashionable, till it bee deform'd; and this is to write like a
Gentleman&quot;

Surely he isn't referring to calligraphy or anything like that. It's a
reference to style.

&quot;There are never wanting, that dare preferre the worst Preachers, the worst
Pleaders, the worst Poets: not that the better have left to write, or speake
better, but that they that heare them judge worse;

Ditto, I think. The reference is to the quality of the content - more a
&quot;penning&quot; type of writing.

&quot;Others there are, that have no composition at all; but a kind of tuneing,
and riming fall, in {w}hat they write.&quot;

Ditto again. The reference is to the content.

&quot;They write a verse, as smooth, as soft, as creame; In which there is no
torrent, nor scarce streame.&quot;

That one speaks for itself. Definitely a &quot;penning&quot; type of writing.

And I think all the following fall into the &quot;penning&quot; category:-

&quot;Some, that turne over all bookes, and are equally searching in all papers,
that write out of what they presently find or meet, without choice;&quot;

&quot;These in all they write, confesse still what bookes they have read last; &quot;

&quot;How he doth raigne in mens affections; how invade, and breake in upon them;
and makes their minds like the thing he writes.&quot;

&quot;I confesse, my Lord, they will seeme but petty, and minute things I shall
offer to you, being writ for children, and of them.

&quot;Which was, as to tell him, he could not write a verse.&quot;

So I can't see it. Suggesting different meanings for &quot;write&quot; and &quot;pen&quot; in De
Shakespeare Nostrati depends on showing that Jonson made the distinction
consistently in his work, and it looks to me that he didn't. Although I
agree that &quot;pen&quot; is exclusively used for literary composition, he has used
&quot;write&quot; often enough in the same context that any subtle distinction he
might have been making in De Shakespeare Nostrati would have been lost on
his readers.

Such a case as you might have rests on any difference between the meaning of
&quot;writing&quot; and &quot;writings&quot;. I'll concede that the sentence in question is the
only place in Timber where he used &quot;writing&quot;, having used &quot;writings&quot;
everywhere else to refer to a body of literary work. But I have to express
the same doubt about whether any of his contempories would pick it up. After
all, the &quot;s&quot; isn't the only letter he dropped from that sentence. &quot;Never
blotted out line&quot; has a missing &quot;a&quot;. Why wouldn't they think (as I think)
that it's just a calligraphic error?

It's a good try, Peter. But really, it's tenuous.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(whatsoever he penn'd) hee never blotted out line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The actors frequently said Shakespeare didn't mess up his writing

&gt;&gt; CORRECTION: didn't makes mistakes he had to blot out

&gt; Note your 'frequently'. Wasn't this when
&gt; they got new scripts, and remarked on their
&gt; pristine nature?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My answer hath beene, would he had blotted a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;thousand. Which they thought a malevolent speech.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson thought he should have deleted a thousand of his lines,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which the actors thought malicious of him.

&gt;&gt; CANCEL THE FOLLOWING:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson is purposely using &quot;blot&quot; in a second way to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make a point, and display a bit of wit.

&gt; Why do you want to cancel this? Aren't
&gt; you saying that Jonson IS using 'blot' in
&gt; a different way from the actors?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Somehow I would never have imagined anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;would take this line. It shows the importance of
&gt;&gt;&gt;asking for paraphrases.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If that were what Jonson meant, how could it not
&gt;&gt;&gt;have been regarded as malevolent?

&gt;&gt; From Jonson's point of view he was merely saying that Shakespeare was
not
&gt;&gt; perfect, which is not malevolence, but candor. He wasn't too senisitive
to the
&gt;&gt; effect of his exaggerations, Paul. You should understand that.

&gt; To say a fellow playwright wrote so badly
&gt; that he should have erased a thousand
&gt; lines, IS to verge on malevolence.

"/>

According to Oxen and quasi-Oxen, to think he should have erased even one
line is malevolent. That's because Oxen and quasi-Oxen are such Bardolaters
that they think Shakespeare's every word is a precious jewel. Listen up,
Malcrowleyo, Ben Jonson is expressing the wish that Shakespeare had done for
himself what every stage director since has had to do for him - which is to
blot out a thousand lines and cut Hamlet down from a five-hour play to
something practically stageable. I won't ask why that is so difficult to
grasp, because someone with his head stuck permanently up his arse has to
feel around just to grasp his own kneecaps. Have you called the Fire Brigade
yet, as I advised?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If that's
&gt; what he meant, then he need to make some
&gt; explanation why it's not. He doesn't make
&gt; the slightest -- he implies that the players
&gt; quite misunderstood the meaning of what
&gt; he was saying.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I had not told posterity this, but for their ignorance,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;who choose that circumstance to commend their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;friend by, wherein he most faulted.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson would not have mentioned this in his notes for posterity
except to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; illustrate the actors' ignorance in praising their friend
(Shakespeare, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fellow mentioned in the first sentence) for something Jonson took to
be a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fault--his worst fault.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Surely you can see that IF Jonson had
&gt;&gt;&gt;wanted to say what you think he meant,
&gt;&gt;&gt;then he could have found much easier
&gt;&gt;&gt;ways of saying it?

&gt;&gt; No. Lots of writers wrote that way. Lots of writers still do. I do,
on
&gt;&gt; occasion. But feel free to show how he might have written it.

&gt; The players were COMMENDING Shake-
&gt; speare for something. What was it?

&gt; Jonson says that they commended him
&gt; for this X, whereas this X was his
&gt; greatest fault. You don't have an X.
&gt; Nothing ties in with your theory.

&lt;&lt;BELLEROPHON is regarded as a nickname or epithet.

King Proetus of Tiryns sent BELLEROPHON to his father-in-law,
the King of Lycia, with a sealed message containing his death
sentence, saying &quot; Pray remove the bearer from this word;
he has tried to violate my wife, your daughter&quot;. This is
the origin of the literary phrase &quot;BELLEROPHONtic letters,&quot;
which is used to describe any communication designed
to bring harm to the unwitting bearer of the message.

Iobates imposed several impossible tasks on BELLEROPHON.

But Athena appeared to BELLEROPHON in a dream and gave him
a magic golden bridle, Chalintis. He left for Mt. HELICON,
to the fountain Peirene, sacred to the Muses &amp; Aphrodite

BELLEROPHON easily bridled &amp; mounted PEGASUS.

Yes, Bob. We know that this is how it seems to you. It

I guess the imperfect would have been better, but I

&gt; Back to &quot;writing.&quot; So, I say Jonson explicitly spoke

Yes. That's more or less what I said to start with, &quot;We

I don't get this. Do you mean that he would have inter-

'to write' and 'to pen' with different meanings

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I wouldn't concede this one:-

&gt;&quot;Nothing is fashionable, till it bee deform'd; and
&gt; this is to write like a Gentleman&quot;

&gt; Surely he isn't referring to calligraphy or anything
&gt; like that. It's a reference to style.

"/>

It's a bit like one I found in *Volpone*

A Lady, indeed, t' have all, Letters, and Arts,
Be able to discourse, to write, to paint,

Not absolutely watertight, but I think you are probably
right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;There are never wanting, that dare preferre the worst
&gt; Preachers, the worst Pleaders, the worst Poets: not
&gt; that the better have left to write, or speake better,
&gt; but that they that heare them judge worse;

&gt; Ditto, I think. The reference is to the quality of the
&gt; content - more a &quot;penning&quot; type of writing.

"/>

Absolutely. As I said right at the beginning I think I
found seven or more examples like this in the plays.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;Others there are, that have no composition at all;
&gt; but a kind of tuneing, and riming fall, in {w}hat they
&gt; write.&quot;

&gt; Ditto again. The reference is to the content.

&gt;&quot;They write a verse, as smooth, as soft, as creame;
&gt; In which there is no torrent, nor scarce streame.&quot;

&gt; That one speaks for itself. Definitely a &quot;penning&quot;
&gt; type of writing.

&gt; And I think all the following fall into the &quot;penning&quot;
&gt; category:-

&gt;&quot;Some, that turne over all bookes, and are equally
&gt; searching in all papers, that write out of what they
&gt; presently find or meet, without choice;&quot;

"/>

Looks nearer to my type 2, I would say.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;These in all they write, confesse still what bookes
&gt; they have read last; &quot;

"/>

Uncertain. As I said, 'penning' seems to be restricted
to &quot;an activity requiring imagination and intended to
affect the emotions, such as the creation of verse,
plays, speeches, songs, love-letters&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;How he doth raigne in mens affections; how invade,
&gt; and breake in upon them; and makes their minds like
&gt; the thing he writes.&quot;

&gt;&quot;I confesse, my Lord, they will seeme but petty, and
&gt; minute things I shall offer to you, being writ for
&gt; children, and of them.

&gt;&quot;Which was, as to tell him, he could not write a verse.&quot;

&gt; So I can't see it. Suggesting different meanings for
&gt;&quot;write&quot; and &quot;pen&quot; in De Shakespeare Nostrati depends
&gt; on showing that Jonson made the distinction consistently
&gt; in his work, and it looks to me that he didn't.

"/>

I disagree that it is necessary to show this. It is for
me to show that he *could* have used the words in two
different ways (which I have). And as I have already
conceded that he could have used the words with the
same meaning, it is for you to demonstrate that he
*would* have done so (which you have not).

My point has always been that either interpretation is
possible, but that the one we choose as the one it
*would* be depends almost entirely upon what we assume
the background to have been.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I agree that &quot;pen&quot; is exclusively used for literary
&gt; composition,

"/>

Not strictly true, in fact. For example, he also used
it for the designing of costumes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; he has used &quot;write&quot; often enough in the same context
&gt; that any subtle distinction he might have been making
&gt; in De Shakespeare Nostrati would have been lost on
&gt; his readers.

"/>

Your assumptions being (a) that he had readers in mind
and, if so, (b) that he would have wanted them to get
what he was really saying?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Such a case as you might have rests on any difference
&gt; between the meaning of &quot;writing&quot; and &quot;writings&quot;.

"/>

Something which became evident only after you had listed
those examples!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'll concede that the sentence in question is the only
&gt; place in Timber where he used &quot;writing&quot;, having used
&gt;&quot;writings&quot; everywhere else to refer to a body of
&gt; literary work. But I have to express the same doubt
&gt; about whether any of his contempories would pick it up.

"/>

I confess, I haven't got a clue whether he expected
*Timber* ever to be published or not. But if it was for
publication, then I'm assuming that he is being delib-
erately equivocal, and if it was not, then it was quite
enough for him to know what he meant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; After all, the &quot;s&quot; isn't the only letter he dropped
&gt; from that sentence. &quot;Never blotted out line&quot; has a
&gt; missing &quot;a&quot;. Why wouldn't they think (as I think)
&gt; that it's just a calligraphic error?

"/>

Yes, they might. Clever, isn't it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's a good try, Peter. But really, it's tenuous.

"/>

But is it impossible? Here's an imaginary dialogue:

Jonson: (looking over a Player's shoulder) That looks
like Shakspeare's writing.

Player: Yes. it is. We miss him.

Jonson: Have you got more than this?

Player: Course we have. Drawers full of the stuff.
Look at that - not a single blotting out.
Brilliant.

Jonson: You mean all of his writing was like that?

Player: Sure it was. Every bit of it. Fantastic!

Jonson: But surely it made a difference if it was
something he'd penned himself rather than
if he was editing or copying out someone
else's words?

Player: No, in his writing (whatsoever he *penn'd*)
he *never* blotted out line.

Jonson: No kidding. I must remember that!

&gt; How could Jonson's words eliminate a scenario which is

It's certainly unlikely, which is why I went on to the
second bit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; I take it you've decided to abandon the idea
&gt;&gt;&gt; that Marlow *was* Shakespeare?

&gt;&gt; Since this is not an idea to which I have ever subscribed,
&gt;&gt; I can hardly be said to have abandoned it.

&gt; I'm not going to argue this a second time. Years ago
&gt; you claimed that you never believed that Marlowe was
&gt; the author and I had to dredge up lots of your old
&gt; posts to prove that you did. I'm not going to bother
&gt; this time.

"/>

Then, if I made that claim &quot;years ago&quot; (as you say) that
was a pretty stupid question for you to ask now, wasn't it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, with that in mind, let's look at Jonson's words,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; honour to Shakespeare, that in his writing (whatsoever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he penn'd) hee never blotted out line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If we ignore for a moment the bit in parentheses, It seems
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fairly obvious that the Players are talking about writings
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which are in Shakespeare's own hand and which he has given
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Acknowledging the immense help that Clark Holloway's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; page is in doing such a thing, let us look at the ways in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which Jonson tends to use the verb 'to write', or forms
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of it, in his plays. They seem to fall into roughly three
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; groups, not unlike how we would use the word today:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) The physical activity of setting down words etc on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; paper or the like. I found about 3 examples of this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Reporting or assembling information and setting it down,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such as the writing of annals or day-to-day letters.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the most common use, my having found 14 in all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) An activity requiring imagination and intended to affect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the emotions, such as the creation of verse, plays,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; speeches, songs, love-letters. I found 7 of these.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We must of course assume that the Players are referring to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plays they have been given, but the reference to what is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'blotted out' tends to give the physical activity more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; emphasis.

&gt;&gt;&gt; More nonsense. What are the examples for your #1 above?

&gt;&gt; A have already given several examples to &quot;Buffalo&quot;. What
&gt;&gt; was wrong with them?

&gt; A lot. Here they are:

&gt; O, I, I have it in writing here of purpose, it
&gt; cost me two Shillings the tricking.
&gt; (EMOH)

&gt; To shew, your Titles are not writ on Posts,
&gt; Or hollow Statues,
&gt; (Poetaster)

&gt; And with his own hand written?
&gt; (Sejanus)

&gt; Here, I deliver it thee as my Deed. If there
&gt; be a Word in it lacking, or writ with false
&gt; Orthography, I protest before -- I will not
&gt; take the advantage.
&gt; (Epicoene)

&gt; And will I tell then? By this Hand of Flesh,
&gt; Would it might never write good Court-hand more,
&gt; If I discover.
&gt; (Alchemist)

&gt; That knows the Law, and writes you six fair Hands,
&gt; (Alchemist)

&gt; And, on the East-side of your Shop, aloft,
&gt; Write Mathlai, Tarmiel, and Baraborat;
&gt; (Alchemist)

&gt; Was not all the Knowledge
&gt; Of the Ægyptians writ in mystick Symbols?
&gt; (Alchemist)

&gt; I did write
&gt; I know not what; nor care not: That Fool Lentulus
&gt; Did dictate, and I t'other Fool did sign it.
&gt; (Catilene)

&gt; These all would count under category #2. *There is no
&gt; category #1*.

"/>

I see, so two balls is the same as one ball because
there is one ball in each case. Right.

Not that it matters. I found it helpful to make that
distinction (and still do) but it makes not one iota
of difference to the argument.

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If they refer to *all* his writing, that necessarily
&gt;&gt; includes &quot;whatsoever he penned&quot;. I repeat - &quot;One might
&gt;&gt; wonder why it was necessary to amplify it in this way&quot;.

&gt; Again your blindness to common idioms is hilarious. The
&gt; entire phrase *in all his....whatever he...., he did such and
&gt; such*, is just a form of hyperbole:

"/>

&quot;Common idiom&quot;, as you managed to find in a 1958
translation of a 271 B.C. document? Hilarious indeed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;The caretaker of the Altar of Zeus at Olympia was renowned
&gt; in that city of Elis. In all he mowed, whatsoever he mowed,
&gt; his lawn lines were perfectly regular.&quot;
&gt; Apoxines, 271 B.C. (Tr. by Newborn Phipps, 1958)
&gt; Phipps notes in his footnote that &quot;[the caretaker] was not
&gt; only responsible for the altar but for the lawns of the
&gt; wealthy landowners in Elis.&quot;

"/>

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But there *is* such a distinction. Are you quite unaware
&gt;&gt; of any other exchanges there have been in this thread?

&gt; The distinction you claim is non-existent. &quot;Write&quot;
&gt; is simply the more general word, &quot;pen&quot; was used not only
&gt; by Jonson but the entire English speaking word

"/>

I am talking about the way Jonson used the verb 'to pen'.
I have noticed that Shakespeare and Marlowe used it the
same way. I am not interested in how you imagine the
the rest of the 'word' would have used it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; to not only creative writing but any professional writing.
&gt; It was therefore possible to say &quot;He wrote some graffiti
&gt; on the wall&quot; or &quot;He wrote a novel&quot; or &quot;He wrote a history&quot;
&gt; or &quot;He penned a novel&quot; or &quot;He penned a history&quot;, but one
&gt; would not, even today, say &quot;He penned some graffiti&quot;.

"/>

No, they use spray cans round our way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The only way you could make a distinction between &quot;write&quot;
&gt; and &quot;pen&quot; in that passage is if Jonson exclusively used
&gt;&quot;pen&quot; when referring to creative writers, but he does not,
&gt; neither in the rest of the section in &quot;Timber&quot; nor in
&gt; his other writings. In fact, the majority of the time he
&gt; uses &quot;write&quot;, while &quot;pen&quot; is the rarer form, and in this
&gt; passage in particular, he probably used it just so he
&gt; didn't repeat the same word in close proximity.

Could be. But might not be.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(whatsoever he penn'd) hee never blotted out line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The actors frequently said Shakespeare didn't mess up his writing

&gt;&gt; CORRECTION: didn't make mistakes he had to blot out

&gt;Note your 'frequently'. Wasn't this when
&gt;they got new scripts, and remarked on their
&gt;pristine nature?

"/>

They made the remark in their preface--which, I think, they and others repeat
several times to Jonson, and he--irked by it--exaggerated the number of times
he'd heard it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My answer hath beene, would he had blotted a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;thousand. Which they thought a malevolent speech.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson thought he should have deleted a thousand of his lines,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which the actors thought malicious of him.

&gt;&gt; CANCEL THE FOLLOWING:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson is purposely using &quot;blot&quot; in a second way to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make a point, and display a bit of wit.

&gt;Why do you want to cancel this? Aren't
&gt;you saying that Jonson IS using 'blot' in
&gt;a different way from the actors?

"/>

No. Both meant blot the line in order to delete it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Somehow I would never have imagined anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;would take this line. It shows the importance of
&gt;&gt;&gt;asking for paraphrases.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If that were what Jonson meant, how could it not
&gt;&gt;&gt;have been regarded as malevolent?

&gt;&gt; From Jonson's point of view he was merely saying that Shakespeare was not
&gt;&gt;perfect, which is not malevolence, but candor. He wasn't too sensitive to the
&gt;&gt; effect of his exaggerations, Paul. You should understand that.

&gt;To say a fellow playwright wrote so badly
&gt;that he should have erased a thousand
&gt;lines, IS to verge on malevolence. If that's
&gt;what he meant, then he need to make some
&gt;explanation why it's not. He doesn't make
&gt;the slightest -- he implies that the players
&gt;quite misunderstood the meaning of what
&gt;he was saying.

"/>

It IS to verge of malevolence--but I claim Jonson would not have thought it
particularly malevolent since just, in his eyes. What else could it mean?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I had not told posterity this, but for their ignorance,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;who choose that circumstance to commend their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;friend by, wherein he most faulted.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson would not have mentioned this in his notes for posterity except to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; illustrate the actors' ignorance in praising their friend (Shakespeare, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fellow mentioned in the first sentence) for something Jonson took to be a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fault--his worst fault.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Surely you can see that IF Jonson had
&gt;&gt;&gt;wanted to say what you think he meant,
&gt;&gt;&gt;then he could have found much easier
&gt;&gt;&gt;ways of saying it?

&gt;&gt; No. Lots of writers wrote that way. Lots of writers still do. I do, on
&gt;&gt; occasion. But feel free to show how he might have written it.

&gt;The players were COMMENDING Shake-
&gt;speare for something. What was it?

"/>

I thought I told you: for being so brilliant he didn't have to write something
over and over to get it right--it came out perfect the first time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Jonson says that they commended him
&gt;for this X, whereas this X was his
&gt;greatest fault. You don't have an X.
&gt;Nothing ties in with your theory.

"/>

I have an X which you seem not to understand. You snipped one passage I wrote
about it. It is writing quickly, spontaneously, without painstaking revision.
The actors thought the method worked and therefore was a virtue, Jonson thought
it didn't always work, so was a vice.

&gt;&gt; It seems to me all Jonson is saying, and clearly
&gt;&gt; saying is that the players said everything Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; used a pen to put on paper--everything!--was unblotted.

&gt;Yes, Bob. We know that this is how it seems to you. It
&gt;is a perfectly straight-forward, literal meaning. and
&gt;- given your beliefs related to the backgound - it is
&gt;the obvious meaning. Unfortunately, as a Stratfordian,
&gt;you will probably also believe that this must therefore
&gt;be the right meaning and thus the only possible one.
&gt;This is what I am disputing.

"/>

I do believe it is the only reasonable meaning, yes. Texts, even ones about . .
. The Bard, can have a single reasonable meaning.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; That's the straight-forward, literal meaning of what's
&gt;&gt; there on the page. BUT we also know Jonson was
&gt;&gt; referring to what Heminges and Condell wrote, or
&gt;&gt; signed as theirs, in the First Folio, to wit: &quot;we
&gt;&gt; have scarse received from him a blot in his papers.&quot;

&gt;Probably. Again, however, as I said to &quot;Buffalo&quot;, I'm
&gt;going to leave any discussion of what the First Folio
&gt;says on this subject until some other time.

"/>

It is so clearly a reference to it that I don't seen how you can. But I'm not
really arguing here, just trying to get my own understanding straight--which is
hard when being confused by the twists you are applying to the text.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Side-thought: would Jonson, alleged to have written
&gt;&gt; Heminges and Condell's prefaces, have gotten the
&gt;&gt; grammar of this passage wrong--i.e., &quot;have received&quot;
&gt;&gt; for &quot;received,&quot; since Shakespeare is dead?)

&gt;I guess the imperfect would have been better, but I
&gt;can't see that it makes much real difference to the
&gt;meaning - it is still the past tense.

"/>

I'm questioning the proposition that Jonson wrote the Hemings/Condell materail
based on my feeling that Jonson would not have gotten the grammar wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Back to &quot;writing.&quot; So, I say Jonson explicitly spoke
&gt;&gt; of anything Shakespeare wrote, but implicitly of those
&gt;&gt; of &quot;his papers&quot; the actors received from him, namely
&gt;&gt; the manuscripts of his plays.

&gt;Yes. That's more or less what I said to start with, &quot;We
&gt;must of course assume that the Players are referring to
&gt;plays they have been given&quot;, but Tom Reedy seemed to
&gt;take some exception to this.
&gt;&gt; Heminges and Condell don't mention a second author, by
&gt;&gt; the way, and clearly indicate that &quot;his papers&quot; were
&gt;&gt; the products of &quot;his thought, (which) he uttered.&quot;

&gt;&quot;And what he thought, he uttered...&quot;. A most unusual
&gt;way of describing the workings of the Muse, wouldn't
&gt;you say? This just off the top of my head, and having
&gt;done no research whatsoever on this passage (and I do
&gt;know they say &quot;conceived&quot; earlier).

"/>

I don't see where the Muse comes in. For me, they're just saying that a thought
entered his head, and he immediately wrote it down, and he was so telented that
he didn't have to do more: his first thought was brilliant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It would seem reasonable to suppose Jonson interpreted
&gt;&gt;&quot;his papers&quot; the same way,

&gt;I don't get this. Do you mean that he would have inter-
&gt;preted &quot;his writing&quot; to be the same as whatever the
&gt;players meant by &quot;his papers&quot;?.

"/>

I mean that Jonson would have thought that by &quot;his papers&quot; was meant what the
players meant by it: &quot;his thought, (which) he uttered,&quot; not something he
collaborated on. So, by &quot;whatsoever he penned,&quot; or &quot;in his writing&quot; (no &quot;all&quot;
there, by the way), Jonson meant what Shakespeare wrote as a single author.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; especially since he goes on to criticize the &quot;easiness&quot;
&gt;&gt; that Heminges and Condell praised Shakespeare for
&gt;&gt; writing with--by himself.

&gt;That is certainly the impresssion one is given, even if
&gt;it doesn't actually say so in those words.

"/>

We seem to agree about the above matters. Now I have to work out just how
you're finding a second author in what Jonson says.

Okay, I'm slow, but I think I understand Peter at last. He is claiming Jonson's
saying the players commended Shakespeare for not making mistakes in his
writing--which Jonson modifies as ONLY the writing he did of his own words.
Peter then assumes Jonson makes this distinction because of the writing he did
as a scribe for Marlowe. Or did Marlowe pen that and Shakespeare just add his
lines to it and deliver it?

The first problem with this that strikes me is that the players clearly spoke in
the First Folio ONLY of what Shakespeare wrote by himself, about his own
thoughts. Well, the actual first problem with it is that no sane reader would
guess Jonson was carefully making sure that someone would know that he was
talking only about Shakespeare's own creative writing, not about creative
writing someone else did using his name.

It all seems wishlexia to me. I could say that Jonson thought Shakespeare wrote
magic words that flew away if flawed, so he needed to make it plain he meant
only those that Jonson was able to put in a pen they couldn't escape from. And
why did he use &quot;whatsoever&quot; instead of &quot;whatever&quot;? Was Shakspeare a seamstress?
I'll leave &quot;ever&quot; for the other crowd to explicate.

I'm sorry, but it just gets so quickly crazy, and I get confused, and get
Peter's scenario wrong, but I can't help tracing the ramifications of what I
take to be his position. Jonson would have liked Shakespeare to delete a
thousand of his lines. Would it not follow that he did not want him to delete
all his lines? Some, then, were as good as Marlowe's? Which ones were his?
Why did Jonson not wish that Shakespeare had blotted ALL his lines? No, why
didn't he wish he'd blotted his lines rather than left them out? Why all this
ingenious avoidance of revealing . . . The Truth, anyway, when Jonson could
simply not have brought up the players' ignorance? Did Jonson discuss Marlowe
anywhere in Timber? Why not? He could have spoken of him as having &quot;gone&quot; in
1593, then used his writing/penned ingenuity to hint at . . . The Truth. Why
didn't he if he felt able to risk speaking of Shakespeare?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Very near. But I think I prefer 'manuscript' in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; singular (i.e. writing as opposed to printing). This
&gt;&gt;&gt; would make it &quot;I remember the Players have often
&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare that in all
&gt;&gt;&gt; his manuscript (no matter what he himself composed)
&gt;&gt;&gt; he never blotted a line.&quot; In other words, he might
&gt;&gt;&gt; have &quot;written&quot; it all, but he didn't necessarily
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;pen&quot; it all. Does that still make sense?

&gt;&gt; Well, still leaving aside the difference between
&gt;&gt;&quot;writing&quot; and &quot;writings&quot;, and focussing on the
&gt;&gt; distinction between &quot;pen&quot; and &quot;write&quot;, it looks
&gt;&gt; like the meaning of &quot;write&quot; is more important. I
&gt;&gt; won't dispute that &quot;pen&quot; is always associated with
&gt;&gt;&quot;compose&quot; in Jonson's usage. But then neither of
&gt;&gt; us is disputing that that is the meaning of &quot;penn'd&quot;
&gt;&gt; in De Shakespeare Nostrati. So it comes down to
&gt;&gt; whether or not Jonson would use &quot;write&quot; to mean the
&gt;&gt; same thing.

&gt; Yes that's right. We know that he could. But do we also
&gt; know that he *would*.

&gt;&gt; I've only looked at Timber, but there is enough in
&gt;&gt; there to throw doubt on your claim.

&gt; My claim is he *could* have used the verbs 'to write'
&gt; and 'to pen' with different meanings.

"/>

This is dissolving into nothing. Now my task is to prove a negative? He
could have used them with different meanings. He could have been writing of
someone else and wrote &quot;Shakespeare&quot; by mistake. He could himself have been
someone else impersonating Ben Jonson. I can't prove any of those
propositions false. How does this help?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I'll grant you that one. Even though &quot;verses&quot; suggests
&gt;&gt; he should use &quot;penning&quot;, the metaphor is to do with
&gt;&gt; the smothering of another's physical writing with your
&gt;&gt; own.

&gt; OK, so you agree that he *could* have used the verbs
&gt; 'to write' and 'to pen' with different meanings

"/>

No one had a gun to his head forcing him to use them with the same meaning.
If you have a theory to advance, can you do it by building one unproven
negative on top of another?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But I wouldn't concede this one:-

&gt;&gt;&quot;Nothing is fashionable, till it bee deform'd; and
&gt;&gt; this is to write like a Gentleman&quot;

&gt;&gt; Surely he isn't referring to calligraphy or anything
&gt;&gt; like that. It's a reference to style.

&gt; It's a bit like one I found in *Volpone*

&gt; A Lady, indeed, t' have all, Letters, and Arts,
&gt; Be able to discourse, to write, to paint,

&gt; Not absolutely watertight, but I think you are probably
&gt; right.

&gt;&gt;&quot;There are never wanting, that dare preferre the worst
&gt;&gt; Preachers, the worst Pleaders, the worst Poets: not
&gt;&gt; that the better have left to write, or speake better,
&gt;&gt; but that they that heare them judge worse;

&gt;&gt; Ditto, I think. The reference is to the quality of the
&gt;&gt; content - more a &quot;penning&quot; type of writing.

&gt; Absolutely. As I said right at the beginning I think I
&gt; found seven or more examples like this in the plays.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Others there are, that have no composition at all;
&gt;&gt; but a kind of tuneing, and riming fall, in {w}hat they
&gt;&gt; write.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Ditto again. The reference is to the content.

&gt;&gt;&quot;They write a verse, as smooth, as soft, as creame;
&gt;&gt; In which there is no torrent, nor scarce streame.&quot;

&gt;&gt; That one speaks for itself. Definitely a &quot;penning&quot;
&gt;&gt; type of writing.

&gt;&gt; And I think all the following fall into the &quot;penning&quot;
&gt;&gt; category:-

&gt;&gt;&quot;Some, that turne over all bookes, and are equally
&gt;&gt; searching in all papers, that write out of what they
&gt;&gt; presently find or meet, without choice;&quot;

&gt; Looks nearer to my type 2, I would say.

&gt;&gt;&quot;These in all they write, confesse still what bookes
&gt;&gt; they have read last; &quot;

&gt; Uncertain. As I said, 'penning' seems to be restricted
&gt; to &quot;an activity requiring imagination and intended to
&gt; affect the emotions, such as the creation of verse,
&gt; plays, speeches, songs, love-letters&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&quot;How he doth raigne in mens affections; how invade,
&gt;&gt; and breake in upon them; and makes their minds like
&gt;&gt; the thing he writes.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&quot;I confesse, my Lord, they will seeme but petty, and
&gt;&gt; minute things I shall offer to you, being writ for
&gt;&gt; children, and of them.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Which was, as to tell him, he could not write a verse.&quot;

&gt;&gt; So I can't see it. Suggesting different meanings for
&gt;&gt;&quot;write&quot; and &quot;pen&quot; in De Shakespeare Nostrati depends
&gt;&gt; on showing that Jonson made the distinction consistently
&gt;&gt; in his work, and it looks to me that he didn't.

&gt; I disagree that it is necessary to show this. It is for
&gt; me to show that he *could* have used the words in two
&gt; different ways (which I have).

"/>

Then you've done something that did not need doing. To say that Jonson
*could* have used the two words in two different ways is to say something
that could have been said before you began your researches. You only needed
to find *one* example where &quot;write&quot; was used as a general-purpose word
describing the non-compositional putting of words on paper, and you'd have
had your &quot;could have&quot;. But this &quot;could have&quot; is not peculiar to Jonson. You
would be hard pressed to find a writer of the times who didn't ever use
&quot;write&quot; in that general purpose sense at least once. And once is all you
need.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And as I have already
&gt; conceded that he could have used the words with the
&gt; same meaning, it is for you to demonstrate that he
&gt; *would* have done so (which you have not).

"/>

I'm sorry, Peter, you're just chasing your own tail. I cannot prove this
positive without disproving the complementary negative, and that would be an
impossible task with any writer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My point has always been that either interpretation is
&gt; possible, but that the one we choose as the one it
&gt; *would* be depends almost entirely upon what we assume
&gt; the background to have been.

"/>

No. Proving both interpretations possible is not the same thing as proving
them equally likely, or equally credible. Jonson could be saying whatever
you say he is saying, only because it can't be disproved. That puts it in
the lowest category of possibility - the very bottom of the theoretical
barrel. To go on from that to say we would choose our interpretation
according to our existing assumptions is to say that an ounce weighs the
same as a ton because they both move the pointer on the scales. But the
&quot;surface&quot;, or &quot;obvious&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; reading of the Jonson piece outweighs
your &quot;special-insight&quot; reading by about the same amount. It's a reading that
requires no particular explication, apart from the place where Jonson
mangles his Caesar quote. It doesn't need special meanings attached to
words, it doesn't need long word-trawls through other texts, it doesn't need
any kind of special pleading. I've already put to you the proposition that
this piece could be given to any educated person - with the name
&quot;Shakespeare&quot; changed to &quot;Witherspoon&quot;, thus nullifying any &quot;background
assumptions&quot; - and that person would get the &quot;obvious&quot; reading first time
through. They'd say, &quot;It's clear enough. What's your problem?&quot; And that
circumstance puts the &quot;obvious&quot; reading ahead of your &quot;special insight&quot;
reading by a country mile. No - both interpretations do not carry equal
weight.

&gt; They made the remark in their preface--which, I think, they and others repeat
&gt; several times to Jonson, and he--irked by it--exaggerated the number of times
&gt; he'd heard it.

So Jonson did not talk to the actors?
They communicated solely by means
of prefaces and the like. Your

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;To say a fellow playwright wrote so badly

&gt; It IS to verge of malevolence--but I claim Jonson would not have thought it
&gt; particularly malevolent since just, in his eyes. What else could it mean?

"/>

I have given you my interpretation. The
actors understood the pristine nature of
the scripts as indicating that the playwright
was a superb genius -- not having to do
any re-writes. But they did not know they
came from a secretary, and that the plays
had been re-written many times when they
were put on for court audiences (about 20
years earlier) -- OR, more likely, they did
know (or suspect) the truth and were
joking about the nature of the deception
that they were all obliged to work under.
Jonson knew the truth in any case, and
was saying the _deception_ involved was
the playwright's greatest fault.

You are making all manner of strange
and complicated assumptions about the
thought processes of the actors. You
then assume that Jonson understood all
this thinking, but disagreed in a minor way
on their overall aesthetic judgements as
to whether or not the plays were good.

Whereas Jonson says that particular
CIRCUMSTANCE is &quot;wherein he most

If Jonson had thought (a) the actors

&gt;&gt;- given your beliefs related to the backgound - it is
&gt;&gt;the obvious meaning. Unfortunately, as a Stratfordian,
&gt;&gt;you will probably also believe that this must therefore
&gt;&gt;be the right meaning and thus the only possible one.
&gt;&gt;This is what I am disputing.

&gt; I do believe it is the only reasonable meaning, yes. Texts, even ones
about . .
&gt; . The Bard, can have a single reasonable meaning.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's the straight-forward, literal meaning of what's
&gt;&gt;&gt; there on the page. BUT we also know Jonson was
&gt;&gt;&gt; referring to what Heminges and Condell wrote, or
&gt;&gt;&gt; signed as theirs, in the First Folio, to wit: &quot;we
&gt;&gt;&gt; have scarse received from him a blot in his papers.&quot;

&gt;&gt;Probably. Again, however, as I said to &quot;Buffalo&quot;, I'm
&gt;&gt;going to leave any discussion of what the First Folio
&gt;&gt;says on this subject until some other time.

&gt; It is so clearly a reference to it that I don't seen how you can. But I'm
not
&gt; really arguing here, just trying to get my own understanding
straight--which is
&gt; hard when being confused by the twists you are applying to the text.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Side-thought: would Jonson, alleged to have written
&gt;&gt;&gt; Heminges and Condell's prefaces, have gotten the
&gt;&gt;&gt; grammar of this passage wrong--i.e., &quot;have received&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; for &quot;received,&quot; since Shakespeare is dead?)

&gt;&gt;I guess the imperfect would have been better, but I
&gt;&gt;can't see that it makes much real difference to the
&gt;&gt;meaning - it is still the past tense.

&gt; I'm questioning the proposition that Jonson wrote the Hemings/Condell
materail
&gt; based on my feeling that Jonson would not have gotten the grammar wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Back to &quot;writing.&quot; So, I say Jonson explicitly spoke
&gt;&gt;&gt; of anything Shakespeare wrote, but implicitly of those
&gt;&gt;&gt; of &quot;his papers&quot; the actors received from him, namely
&gt;&gt;&gt; the manuscripts of his plays.

&gt;&gt;Yes. That's more or less what I said to start with, &quot;We
&gt;&gt;must of course assume that the Players are referring to
&gt;&gt;plays they have been given&quot;, but Tom Reedy seemed to
&gt;&gt;take some exception to this.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Heminges and Condell don't mention a second author, by
&gt;&gt;&gt; the way, and clearly indicate that &quot;his papers&quot; were
&gt;&gt;&gt; the products of &quot;his thought, (which) he uttered.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&quot;And what he thought, he uttered...&quot;. A most unusual
&gt;&gt;way of describing the workings of the Muse, wouldn't
&gt;&gt;you say? This just off the top of my head, and having
&gt;&gt;done no research whatsoever on this passage (and I do
&gt;&gt;know they say &quot;conceived&quot; earlier).

&gt; I don't see where the Muse comes in. For me, they're just saying that a
thought
&gt; entered his head, and he immediately wrote it down, and he was so telented
that
&gt; he didn't have to do more: his first thought was brilliant.

"/>

I think he's suggesting the word &quot;uttered&quot;, as opposed to &quot;put down&quot; or
&quot;penn'd&quot; or something, looks suspicious. Things are getting horribly
complicated when the Players themselves start being &quot;ambiguous&quot;. Up to now
we've been taking them as just about the only straight talkers in the whole
of Elizabethan England, the only ones not talking in code, or &quot;tipping the
wink&quot; to those in the know. But it couldn't last. It's like one of those
murder mysteries where everyone gets a chance to act suspiciously.
Eventually Inspector Hound will gather them all in the drawing-room and
reveal....

Yes, that's more or less it, as far as I can tell. It just leaves us

Even more to the point, if Jonson thought Marlowe was the true or the chief

&gt;&gt; It IS to verge of malevolence--but I claim Jonson would not have thought it

&gt;I have given you my interpretation. The

&gt;the scripts as indicating that the playwright

&gt;any re-writes. But they did not know they

Johnson was part of the theatre world
from around 1597. He was mixing with
the same actors as Shakespeare (under
your scenario) from then until the Bard
retired around 1612. Yet, according to
you, he had to wait until 1623, eleven
or more years after the Stratman had
stopped producing scripts, to learn
this item of information about them.

He is saying that the truth is better than lies;
that it would have been far better for the
actors to have known the author (when he
was alive) and got their scripts direct from
the man himself, without all the palaver
and deceit involved. The scripts would
then have been blotted -- in the usual
manner of hand-written scripts.

I'd need better evidence of this 'consensus'

thought it simple or obvious. Perhaps it's
the only theory that works within your

you are right, then every 'scholar' repeated

so a 'consensus' was achieved.

Only a very foolish person, who knew little
about the theatre, would say that in any
event. Jonson doesn't begin to fit that
description. There is, as all actors and
other theatrical folk agree, little that is
easily cut from the canonical plays. They
often have to be cut for performance, but
it is always done with regret.

low. BRYNNYS are bourns or streams. BRUCHE, a brook.

BRESTE is the oldest word I can find, and which is A. Sax, meaning To burst.
BRECHE is also A. Sax, breeches

BREACH has a meaning (2) of break-of-day by Harrison's Description. However
is often used for 'break' in an obscene sense, as in Heywood's Royall King

Aah, you're full of it about ol' Peter, Jim: he's no Marlowe-Booster; he just
feels 100% willing to entertain the hypothesis that he has proven beyond
reasonable doubt that Marlowe wrote the works of Shakespeare. Surely, you see
the difference?

&gt;&gt;Read what I said above. They mentioned the unblottedness in their preface, then
&gt;&gt; probably repeated their opinion to Jonson a few times later.

&gt;Johnson was part of the theatre world
&gt;from around 1597. He was mixing with
&gt;the same actors as Shakespeare (under
&gt;your scenario) from then until the Bard
&gt;retired around 1612. Yet, according to
&gt;you, he had to wait until 1623, eleven
&gt;or more years after the Stratman had

He waited, probably, till then to hear the actors' express their opinion using

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have given you my interpretation. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;actors understood the pristine nature of
&gt;&gt;&gt;the scripts as indicating that the playwright
&gt;&gt;&gt;was a superb genius -- not having to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;any re-writes. But they did not know they
&gt;&gt;&gt;came from a secretary, and that the plays
&gt;&gt;&gt;had been re-written many times when they
&gt;&gt;&gt;were put on for court audiences (about 20
&gt;&gt;&gt;years earlier) --

&gt;&gt; which they could have been with no secretary involved

&gt;&gt;&gt;OR, more likely, they did
&gt;&gt;&gt;know (or suspect) the truth and were
&gt;&gt;&gt;joking about the nature of the deception
&gt;&gt;&gt;that they were all obliged to work under.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Jonson knew the truth in any case, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;was saying the _deception_ involved was
&gt;&gt;&gt;the playwright's greatest fault.

&gt;&gt; Why did Jonson say Shakespeare should have blotted a thousand lines?

&gt;He is saying that the truth is better than lies;
&gt;that it would have been far better for the
&gt;actors to have known the author (when he
&gt;was alive) and got their scripts direct from
&gt;the man himself, without all the palaver
&gt;and deceit involved. The scripts would
&gt;then have been blotted -- in the usual
&gt;manner of hand-written scripts.

What does the error of Oxford in concealing his identity have to do with
Jonson's explicitly criticizing him for gushing--for, that is, using too many
words and the like in his writing? That is, to make it plainer (though there's
no way you'll allow it through your defenses), why would Jonson criticize
Shakespeare for being too wordy if he thought his fault was concealing his True
Identity?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have an X which you seem not to understand. You snipped one passage I wrote
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;about it. It is writing quickly, spontaneously, without painstaking revision.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The actors thought the method worked and therefore was a virtue, Jonson
&gt;&gt;thought
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it didn't always work, so was a vice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You are making all manner of strange
&gt;&gt;&gt;and complicated assumptions about the
&gt;&gt;&gt;thought processes of the actors. You
&gt;&gt;&gt;then assume that Jonson understood all
&gt;&gt;&gt;this thinking, but disagreed in a minor way
&gt;&gt;&gt;on their overall aesthetic judgements as
&gt;&gt;&gt;to whether or not the plays were good.

&gt;&gt; No, Paul, you are trying desperately to ambiguate a very simple passage that
&gt;&gt; everyone who read took as meaning what I say it does until the Baconians
&gt;&gt; arrived.

&gt;I'd need better evidence of this 'consensus'
&gt;than your assertion, but no one could have
&gt;thought it simple or obvious. Perhaps it's
&gt;the only theory that works within your
&gt;scenario -- but it has to be contrived. If
&gt;you are right, then every 'scholar' repeated
&gt;the words of the first one to work it out, and
&gt;so a 'consensus' was achieved.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Whereas Jonson says that particular
&gt;&gt;&gt;CIRCUMSTANCE is &quot;wherein he most
&gt;&gt;&gt;faulted&quot;. Jonson is saying _nothing_
&gt;&gt;&gt;about the overall quality of the plays
&gt;&gt;&gt;-- nor about any aspect of them.

&gt;&gt; The circumstance of not blotting or removing lines.

&gt;Only a very foolish person, who knew little
&gt;about the theatre, would say that in any
&gt;event. Jonson doesn't begin to fit that
&gt;description. There is, as all actors and
&gt;other theatrical folk agree, little that is
&gt;easily cut from the canonical plays. They
&gt;often have to be cut for performance, but
&gt;it is always done with regret.

"/>

Right: you know just how Jonson had to have felt. But we know abolutely that he
thought Shakespeare had faults. He is quoted by Drummond as saying
Shakespeare &quot;lacked art.&quot; There is anecdotal evidence of his differences with
Shakespeare as an artist. But you don't want Jonson to have said that he wished
Shakespeare has blotted out a thousand lines, so you simply state that he did
not--because he could not have. Even though it's right there: he did.

&gt;&gt;The 'gushing' was in his conversation --
&gt;&gt;NOT in his writing. Do you think that
&gt;&gt;he was seen to break into laughter while
&gt;&gt;he was writing his plays? This is the
&gt;&gt;full text of what we have from Timber:

&gt;&gt; De Shakespeare nostrat.
&gt;&gt;I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an honour to Shake-
&gt;&gt;speare, that in his writing, (whatsoever he penn'd) hee never blotted out
&gt;&gt;line. My answer hath beene, would he had blotted a thousand. Which
&gt;&gt;they thought a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity this, but for
&gt;&gt;their ignorance, who choose that circumstance to commend their friend
&gt;&gt;by, wherein he most faulted. And to justifie mine owne candor, (for I
&gt;&gt;lov'd the man, and doe honour his memory (on this side Idolatry) as
&gt;&gt;much as any.) Hee was (indeed) honest, and of an open, and free na-
&gt;&gt;ture: had an excellent Phantsie; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
&gt;&gt;wherein hee flow'd with that facility, that sometime it was necessary he

&gt;&gt; Augustus in Hat.
&gt;&gt;should be stop'd: Sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said of Haterius. His
&gt;&gt;wit was in his owne power; would the rule of it had beene so too. Many
&gt;&gt;times hee fell into those things, could not escape laughter: As when hee
&gt;&gt;said in the person of Cæsar, one speaking to him; Cæsar thou dost me
wrong.
&gt;&gt;Hee replyed: Cæsar did never wrong, but with just cause: and such like;
&gt;&gt;which were ridiculous. But hee redeemed his vices, with his vertues.
&gt;&gt;There was ever more in him to be praysed, then to be pardoned.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That is, to make it plainer (though there's
&gt;&gt;&gt; no way you'll allow it through your defenses), why would Jonson
criticize
&gt;&gt;&gt;Shakespeare for being too wordy if he thought his fault was concealing
his True
&gt;&gt;&gt; Identity?

&gt;&gt;There are _two_ main topics in Jonson's
&gt;&gt;remarks in Timber (a) on the cleanest
&gt;&gt;of the scripts; and (b) on the facility of
&gt;&gt;his speech. The latter has little or nothing
&gt;&gt;to do with the former.

&gt; Okay. I will merely say that I disagree. Jonson is obviously
exemplifying in
&gt; his second section what he charged Shakespeare with in his first.

&gt;&gt;(In fact, there is a connection. The similarity
&gt;&gt;to Winston Churchill is remarkable. The
&gt;&gt;same words could have been used of WSC
&gt;&gt;as of WS. WSC was often extraordinarily
&gt;&gt;eloquent, not just when he prepared in
&gt;&gt;advance, but often in the most casual of
&gt;&gt;conversations. He soon learnt how to use
&gt;&gt;stenographers, keeping several going when
&gt;&gt;he was most active. I'm sure this is how
&gt;&gt;'Shake-speare' often worked. Of course,
&gt;&gt;when the recipients of his letters, 'prayers',
&gt;&gt;memoranda, books, etc., etc., got their
&gt;&gt;copy, it had come from the hands of a
&gt;&gt;professional scribe and had no 'blots'.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Only a very foolish person, who knew little
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;about the theatre, would say that in any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;event. Jonson doesn't begin to fit that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;description. There is, as all actors and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other theatrical folk agree, little that is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;easily cut from the canonical plays. They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;often have to be cut for performance, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it is always done with regret.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Right: you know just how Jonson had to have felt. But we know abolutely
that he
&gt;&gt;&gt; thought Shakespeare had faults. He is quoted by Drummond as saying
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare &quot;lacked art.&quot;

&gt;&gt;And we know what THAT meant -- he
&gt;&gt;despised (and did not follow) all the neo-
&gt;&gt;Aristotelian rules Jonson liked so much.

&gt; Perhaps. But it does mean he found flaws in Shakespeare. In fact, he
found
&gt; precisely the flaw of lack of self-constraint he attacks Shakespeare for
in
&gt; Timber.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is anecdotal evidence of his differences with
&gt;&gt;&gt;Shakespeare as an artist. But you don't want Jonson to have said that
he wished
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare has blotted out a thousand lines,

&gt;&gt;He didn't, and you should accept the
&gt;&gt;texts for what they state. There is no
&gt;&gt;'out'. 'Blotting' is NOT the same as
&gt;&gt;'blotting out'.

&gt;&gt;&gt; so you simply state that he did
&gt;&gt;&gt; not--because he could not have. Even though it's right there: he did.

&gt;&gt;The principal difference between us is
&gt;&gt;that we POINT OUT that in the very few
&gt;&gt;statements about Shake-speare that we
&gt;&gt;have from Jonson (et al) we almost
&gt;&gt;always find strange, curious, ambiguous,
&gt;&gt;apparently self-contradictory expressions,
&gt;&gt;and the statements are always full of
&gt;&gt;lacunae.

&gt;&gt;We can say why that is the case. You
&gt;&gt;simply say that it's like that because it's
&gt;&gt;like that. Or else you deny it (as you
&gt;&gt;seem to be doing here) maintaining
&gt;&gt;that some weird convoluted statement
&gt;&gt;is a crystal clear expression of whatever
&gt;&gt;it is you want it to say.

&gt;&gt;Paul.

&gt; Can't argue with you if you won't even admit that Jonson said BLOT OUT.

"/>

Why leave that until last, fer Chrissake? This is the same fool who says &quot;I
see no 'friend'.&quot; Now he sees no &quot;blotted out&quot;. Soon he'll see no
&quot;Shakespeare&quot;.

Who was it said, &quot;Never argue with a fool, lest you become like him&quot;?

Well it was me. Just now.

&gt;&gt; I take it you've decided to abandon the idea

&gt; Since this is not an idea to which I have ever
&gt; subscribed, I can hardly be said to have abandoned it.

In 1982, William Honey published his theory that it was
*Shakespeare* who was in fact killed in 1593, with the
object of allowing Marlowe from then on to take over his
identity as William Shakespeare. In other words, that
Marlowe *was* Shakespeare, to use Jim's phrase (and
vice versa). It is, as I said, not an idea to which I have
ever subscribed.

As far as what I do think most probably happened, this
is what I posted here (to Richard Nathan) *five and a
half years ago*, on 22 Jan 1999:

If you go to the website shown below and click on
'A Deception in Deptford' you will see the follow-
ing words, which state fairly clearly where I stand
on this.

Christopher Marlowe's alleged death
is investigated by Peter Farey
And new evidence is presented, which shows:
. that Marlowe was, beyond reasonable doubt, still
alive two years after his supposed death in May
1593,
. that his survival would have made possible a
collaboration explaining the exceptional influence
Marlowe is said to have had upon the works of
Shakespeare,
. that Marlowe probably played a major part in such
a collaboration.

When I say 'beyond reasonable doubt', I am thinking
of a high probability (p &gt;.99) and when I say 'probably'
I am merely saying that it is more likely than not
(p &gt;.5).

The essay itself had been uploaded and I had pointed it
out to HLAS a couple of months *before* the ancient post
which Jim has managed to find, and (beyond some changes
in the stated confidence levels), my views are in no way
different now from what I said then.
