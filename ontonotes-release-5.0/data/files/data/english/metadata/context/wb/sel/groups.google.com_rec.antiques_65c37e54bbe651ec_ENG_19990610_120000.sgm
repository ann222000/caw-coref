Ebay changed the look of their pages. I can view the list of items, but when
I click an item, I get an error message &quot;connection reset by peer&quot; (whatever
the hell that means). Basically, any page with &quot;dll&quot; in its URL no
longer works.

All other non-Ebay web sites still work, BTW

There's some auctions I'd like to bid, but can't!!!

Not to worry, it was just the regularly scheduled unscheduled 8 hour outage
because an overworked hamster in their database server keeled over.

I didn't write this but wish I had:

Ebay's error message says that if the problem persists contact customer support.
LOL. When ebay goes down like this, do you picture everyone at the office
scurrying around saying &quot;Oh my God, we're down, customers will be furious, let's
bust some butts around here and get this thing back up&quot;. I used to think like
that, but anymore I believe it's some overweight, sweaty balding guy eating a
sandwich and guzzling a beer looking at a monitor going &quot;Huh Huh looksa like I a
betta go kick the puter, maybe thater geter goin Huh Huh.&quot;

limited to their now routine nightly crashes. Apparently folks in Taiwan,
Russia and Nigeria have got hold of credit card info via their security

I think they run the database on a RAM drive. Someone tripped over the
extension cord unplugging the system loosing all data. They have to
manually input all the data from their printout on their 9-pin dot
matrix printer.

I think they need to spend more time keeping the system reliable instead
of the fancy 'glitz' and 'glam' they waste time on. Who needs ebay chat,
and the cafe, and 'my-ebay', a paging system, and on and on.....

"/> I must not have made myself clear in my previous message since someone
who wrote to me privately seemed to think I suggested it was the
person's own computer who was giving the trouble.
I think the person who wrote the original letter regarding the error
message, was &quot;not&quot; referring to the problem ebay is having currently
at all, but an error message which usually appears in a blue box when
ebay is overloaded, which frequently happens, and among other things
it does say &quot;...connection reset by peer&quot;
This is the message I thought was originating from my own machine when
it first started happening but found out later it was when ebay was
busy or at peak viewing times for them.
The problem they are having today is nothing like the error message I
believe the poster was referring to. Others have also told me they too
get the blue box error message, and if they have the time and
patience, they do eventually get through.

yourself more a &quot;web presence&quot; to make yourself more attractive to a

"/> I also find &quot;My eBay&quot; quite well-designed and useful. The graphics
do tend to slow things down some, with the &quot;cutesy&quot; animated graphics
some sellers insist upon using...and the &quot;third party graphics hosting&quot;
(often unreliable) other sellers use...being &quot;time and resource wasters&quot;.

eBay's recent troubles may indeed be a &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; for them.
It's made them realize the necessity of a redundant system to minimize
system down-time (translating into lost revenues). With their database
operating on Sun Sparcs running &quot;customized&quot; Paradox software, they do
a remarkable job when considering the &quot;hits&quot; received. Recently eBay's
provider (Exodus.net) suffered outages of unknown origin here on the
East Coast...the problems are not always at eBay itself (tho the
most recent extended outage was). This outage may have been a &quot;blessing
in disguise&quot;, however; it has made eBay realize and seriously consider
the value of a redundant system to minimize down-time (i.e., lost profits).
Time will tell...but I'm willing to bet that eBay will implement changes
in both equipment and operating procedures which will insure more customer
confidence, system reliability, and ultimately profitability. Afterall,
that is the name of the game, is it not?

The story is fairly well known. Twas invented by a guy who wanted to
create a site to help his girlfriend buy and sell items of her
collection of Pez candy containers. Nobody was more surprised than he
at eBay's success. As for ownership, us stockholders own a goodly
chunk -- but the insiders are the really fat cats.

Liz,

I own ebay, along with a lot of other stockholders. Sometimes when
the crap leaks over into this newsgroup, I wish it didn't exist, but
it has been &quot;berry berry good to me.&quot; Bought it at $45, they had an
outage, price dropped to $40. Bought more. It went to $120 a share,
then down a little, then split. Sitting at $37 a share now, and the
doodoo hasn't hit the fan from this recent major outage. I'm hoping
the price will plunge on Monday, and I'll buy more! It's a good idea
whose downfall so far has been a result of its success. I think
it'll be around a good while, and stronger technically.

Remember, a keen financial mind is the product of heredity. This
message is brought to you by the fellow whose grandfather bought into
the Sucker Creek Mining Company. ;&lt;)

Best regards,

Tom

What gets me is that every time there is a major breakdown on eBay, they
tell us they're working &quot;diligently&quot; to get a hot backup system in
place. I've been working with computers since the 70's... and one thing
I've learned is that if you have a mission critical system (which eBay
is in a way), the FIRST thing you do is set up a hot backup system, a
RAID system just can't cut it, especially with the size system they have
(gigs of memory per server, etc).

Have fun, Michele

Tom, you might want to check your eBay stock again... eBay closed at 165
7/8th on Friday, quite a bit higher than the $37/share you mentioned...
&lt;grin&gt; Of course, Monday will tell whether stockholders (who are mostly
eBay sellers) will continue to hold onto their stock, or decide to
sell...

Have fun, Michele

Who owns eBay? Her name is Meg Whitman. She is supposedly the richest
woman CEO in the world. She has been CEO for about a year. Before that,
she was general mgr of Hasbro's preschool division. Even after her little
disaster last week her worth on paper was $1.1 billion. She graduated from
Harvard Business School &amp; Princeton U. She is married to a brain surgeon.
She is now in the process of acquiring Butterfield &amp; Butterfield (the 134
yr old fine arts auction house) for $260 million.
She's only 42 yrs old, though, and so cannot qualify as an antique!

This outage a &quot;blessing in disguise&quot;? How about the numerous other
outages they have had, they didn't seem to take that as any message to
get their hardware (hot back-up) upgraded to prevent this sort of
problem. They made 34 million last year, I don't think resources are
the problem. eBay had it made, they had the internet auction market to
themselves pretty much and now they are screwing up and letting the
other guys (Amazon/Yahoo) in. Check out this article...

&gt; Is there any evidence that this time they are going to learn their
&gt; lesson?
&gt; Maybe. Maybe not. The priciples you describe were in operation
&gt; in the past too, weren't they? Well, they didn't learn their lesson
&gt; back then. Is their any real reason to assume they are going to learn
&gt; their lesson THIS time?

&gt; Just curious,

Although I hate myself for defending Ebay, I don't really see any of
these other new and exciting auction sites taking much away from them. I
have not seen one of them yet do anything really different in the way of
service; they are just small versions of Ebay. The only one that I have
even looked at more than a few times is EHammer, and only because of the
promotion they receive from one of their investors (Maine Antique
Digest). They all take pretty much the same stand: &quot;We are only a
faciliator - caveat emptor&quot;. (For what it's worth, although I am
hardwired to the ISP located on the floor below us, Ehammer for some
reason is incredibly slow - worse than eBay ever is). Amazon might make
a dent if they can allow buyers to pay for auction purchases with
MC/VISA; but I suspect they cannot or will not want to get into the
middle of business disputes.

I think Ebay works for buyers and sellers due to its massive presence
and recognition. And in spite of their problems, that will be one tough
nut to crack.

"/> I think I know where it came from but I've never been able to confirm
it. (OK, I never tried all that hard.) So this is speculation.

The Milpitas, California campus of Sun Microsystems is referred to as
ebay.sun.com and when I worked there (in the days before AuctionWeb), my
e-mail address was charl ... @ebay.sun.com. I suspect relevance here
because of 1) eBay's curious devotion to Sun hardware even while it
blames Sun for its continuing problems and 2) there's a well-known (in
sysadm circles) senior engineer at ebay.sun.com who may have had an
early eBay server named for him. It would not surprise me if he was
instrumental in getting eBay off the ground.

Sorry for the non-antique content.

"/> I agree 100%. I would prefer to stick with eBay. The more online auctions
there are, the small my customer base and the harder it will be to sell my
merchandise. In order to stop the others from getting a foothold EBay is going
to have to do a better job. I wonder if they ever really ask customers what
they want. They take surveys but do they listen? I don't think any of us has a
problem with the format. All we need is to be able to complete a transaction
quickly and cleanly. We need eBay to stay on line. Ebay needs to focus on this
issued and leave the cosmetics to the others. But than again, they have done
just fine without my input the past almost 5 years and will most likely come out
of all this a better Company. I'm really not bashing them. I've only been
selling for 9 months and have enjoyed every trip to the bank. I guess It's been
such a good thing I just hat to see it change.
