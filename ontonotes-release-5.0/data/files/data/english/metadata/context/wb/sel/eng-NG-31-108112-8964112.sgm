RTFM is age-old computer lingo.... It stands for
&quot;Read The F***ing Manual&quot; ;-) I used the manual
and it works very good!

But it is a long text to read (76 pages printed on
A4-size paper) My lab is 1year old now, and
teaching him something new takes about 30
minutes  (depending on what to teach of course)

My other dog (a 7year old staffordshire terrier-mix)
is a bit slower in learning, but he is used to me calling
him a &quot;bad dog&quot;whenever he did something i didn't
want him to do, or it might be the age.

Sometimes it looks like Sam (the lab) WANTS to learn
something new: he wants me to bring along the can
filled with washers whenever we go for a walk. It is a
very &quot;humane&quot; way of teaching: the dog is allways a
&quot;good dog&quot;, and never a &quot;bad dog&quot;

There is nu punishment or prong-collars involved.

For a fact i tought him to heel in 15min's without
beeing on a leach at-all !!! When he spotted a dog,
he used to run towards it, but now i tought him to &quot;ask
permission&quot; first, and to my surprise it worked!

My dogs never went to puppy-training
(lucky for them), maybe this helped too.

&quot;The IMBECILITY of some of the claims for operant

six days the boys are reported to have been learning
new words with alacrity. HOWEver, when REWARDS
were moved to a delayed contingency the behavior
and learning immediately deteriorated.&quot;

&quot;It is NO WONDER that the marked changes in
deviant behavior of children can be achieved
through brief, simple educative routines with
their mothers which modify the mother's social
behaviors shaping the child (Whaler, 1966).

Some clinics have reported ELIMINATION ofthe
need for child THERAPY through changing the
clinical emphasis from clinical to parental HANDLING
of the child (Szrynski 1965).

A large number of cases improved sufficiently after
preliminary contact with parents that NO treatment
of children was required, and almost ALL cases
SHOWE a remarkably shortened period for therapy.
Quite severe cases of anorexia nervosa have been
treated in own to five months by simply REPLACING
the parents temporarily with EFFUSIVELY LOVING

No, the dog learned that I would hold still

Well if she wanted to stop and go in another
direction.. say to sniff my neighbors yard..

She learned if she wanted to do it I would stop
walking and she could go.. and if there wasn't
enough slack on her lead she would just pull me.

Then when she got done doing *her* thing, she woudl
heel.. smile at me and wait for me to say &quot;let's go&quot;
and finish *my* thing.  I would refuse to move .. i
looked like an idiot.. freezing mid walk for minutes
waiting for *my* dog to heel and give *me* permission
to go again.

I did the treats and the let's go... she got to do her
stuff and get a cookie.. if she even wanted the cookie.

I wound up calling Jerry.. as I have a half red nose
pit and half amstaff.. who is incredibly protective..

we had a new pup on the way.. and i needed help.. i
followed petsmarts trainnign guides.. memorized them...
and they *did* work, don't get me wrong.. but only
when my pet wanted a cookie or felt the cookie was
better than what she wanted.. which was not often.

She quickly learned to ignore my commands if she
could see my hands were empty.  So I called Jerry...
he chatted me for about an hour and a half.. gave me
his link... and even when i had probs intro'ing the
pup he called me withn i5 mins of my email for help
at 10pm on a sunday night.

One.. singular.. uno family pack exercise after
the hot and cold exercise and i could zig zag
down my street.. about face .. whatever.. and
never had tension.

two men were acrossed the street and she walked right
by them... ordinarily she'd snarl and protect us.

And in two days.. my dog.. who bit the puppy if he
even looked like he was going near my husband or kids..
is nursing him every hour.. cleaning him.. rough housing
gently.. and teaching him to go potty outside..

actually watches him to make sure he doesn't go in
the house... and has milk.. which is awesome since
she's 19 months old and has never had a litter.

She also has stopped barking non stop at our neighbor's
dogs and pig.. does not bark at eveyr car that drives by
and has stopped jumping on people.  she's even starting
to ignore our cat who has lived on her dome litter box
and our window sill (literally) for over a year and a half.

She also does her commands on cue..
and doesn't look for a treat.

Hi Jerry,

When I talked to you on the phone to order to machine
for daughter's new pup, I told you that I had an older
Chessie. I rescued him at 9 years old and have had
him for 3 years.

It's funny, but I thought I'd try some of your book
training with him. Where I used to say &quot;come&quot; and
then say &quot;good boy&quot; when he obeyed, I have reversed
it with a &quot;good boy&quot; first.

It really does work.

He was very confused at first, wondering what he
had done to get the praise.

But it really gets the attention and distracts him from
whatever he may have going through his brain when
he hears it.

Dogs are funny, but people are too. Can't wait to get
the Doggy do Right, etc.

Thanks,

There may be a few reasons, sometimes it's ignorance,
simply a failure to  realise what you are doing is
futile and you need to adopt a different  approach.

Sometimes you may be learning a new technique and
need to  experiment with it to be sure it's not just
the way you are applying it  that  is the problem,
you may need to try slight variations of the same
technique to see if there is a different result
before you dismiss it completely.

Sometimes you are doing the only thing you can
think of, even though it's  not working but you
simply don't know what else to do.

Either way as long as you are able to reflect
and learn from your experiences and move forward
then a few failed attempts are all part of the
learning process.

My best example was teaching both dogs to walk
to heel, alone and together in the brace position.

I was determined to teach them without any aids
choke, prong collars or treats etc) and without
forcing the heel by  jerking  or restraining them
using a leash, I knew it could be done, despite
the scorn of friends and even family who &quot;knew
better&quot; (but had never  actually  trained a dog
in their lives).

It took me a while trying various ways to entice
them to want to walk beside me, someone else at
the dog park  whose  dog appeared to heel very
well ( but held it's ears back and tail down and
looked very intimidated about being at heel)
suggested I give up and use a choke collar like
him, but I was obstinate.

One day like a switch it all fell into place,
first one dog then the other then both together
all  walked  to heel, then I tried without leads
and it worked, the dogs were happy  and  so was I.

I had persevered and succeeded and learnt a lot
in the  process.

People said &quot;it took you long enough&quot; but now I
could teach heel easily and quickly when I need
to do it again. And now when I walk my dogs and
I see the same scornful people with their dogs
still pulling on the choke  collars  saying &quot;heel,
heel&quot; it's me who has the last laugh.

Okay, I gotta speak up here... We've been using Jerry's
methods with our dog. We had the same problem as the
original poster has with Buzz. One day working with the
family pack exercise and practicing the recall command
with the family and she'll now go out with hubby and
daughter instead of needing me to reassure her or even
refusing to go with anyone but me.

I really urge you, regardless of the negative things you
might hear about Jerry &amp; Wits' End here, to try the method
and *judge the results for yourself*.

Let's see what other areas she's improved in... always
comes when called, not chewing stuff even if we leave
it laying around, &quot;re&quot;housebroken after long shelter stay,
walks perfectly on leash, doesn't try to steal food from
our plates or beg... probably a few more things I'm
forgetting to mention. *(Yeah, the kats lay off the koi
and don't wander. jh).

That's in about a week's time.

Her overall demeanor has changed. When we brought
her home she was very untrusting and ultra-submissive
(except with her area/toys where she was possessive and
nippy).

She had been abused and beaten by previous owners,
then she was in a shelter for months. They (most of them)
wanted to give up and kill her Now she's gained confidence
and trust with us. Last night was another big breakthrough
(in my eyes). She barked! Big deal, she barked just once
when she heard the front door. Great!

Anyway, you'll be told lots of nasty stuff about Jerry or
that the Wits' End manual is culled from other sources.
In my opinion, even if it is, it takes only the good stuff
and leaves out the bad. Works for me.

(And I suppose I gotta say this... I don't know Jerry
personally.

I've emailed him and instant messaged him. I have not
bought a &quot;Doggy Do Right&quot;. He's offered help for free.)

&gt; &gt; I am wanting to get a rhodesian ridgeback soon

&gt; &gt; about food treats and violence)
&gt; &gt; Thanks for any intelligent replies
&gt; I have tried his methods and found them extremely
&gt; effective.  There are several areas in particular I
&gt; found useful.
&gt; He teaches you and the dog to pay attention to each
&gt; other all the time. He teaches you to have such good
&gt; communication with your dog you don't need leash
&gt; corrections or shock collars or even food, you can get
&gt; the dogs attention any time you like by calling it or with
&gt; a snap of your fingers.
&gt; When I trained both my dogs to &quot;heel&quot; or walk close
&gt; to me I ended up going to the parks and teaching
&gt; them without a lead at all, that ensured I had to use
&gt;  good communication and was unable to be tempted
&gt; to use the lead to correct them.
&gt; Another part of the training I agree with is not using
&gt; the &quot;policeman&quot; approach, where you tell a dog &quot;no&quot;
&gt; or react with it in such a way that you become involved
&gt; in the behaviour (by trying to stop it), this approach
&gt; often results in a dog ceasing the behaviour when you
&gt; are about but doing it when you aren't (bin raiding,
&gt; counter surfing etc).
&gt; Basically you are taught to make your dog a good
&gt; friend who likes and wants to work for you for the
&gt; pleasure of working for you (setting the hierarchy
&gt; is included in this), teach it to recall reliably,
&gt; then to do everything else (sit, stay down etc etc).
&gt; Unwanted behaviours are addressed as they occur.
&gt; If you understand what you are trying to achieve and
&gt; are prepared to work with it you can get great results.

If you have read the newsgroup posts then you must
already have a good idea about what I think.

His methods are the best I have come across. They
aren't a quick fix but an entire training concept so if
you aren't in for the long haul then don't bother.  If
you go his way then you have to forget all the other
gibberish that other people spew, you have to believe
in what you are doing, then and only then will you get
the results.

You can't combine his methods with other training
methods, not until you understand what  you are
trying to achieve, and even then I have only ever
combined about 2 other trainers ideas and even
then just a snip of what they suggest which works
in parallel with the Wits End concept.

His methods make you as the trainer completely
responsible for your actions, his methods make
you think and work out your own solutions for
any given situation, the default (the recall) is
always there to get things under control again.

His ideas and concepts teach you to work with
the dog, to develop a team and a willingness to
work together which is surely the best way to be.
His methods don't use force or intimidation but
they do totally emphasize the absolute importance
of pack (family pack) structure, without that you
can achieve almost nothing.

If you are wondering how a dog can be trained
without any negativity the answer lies in the recall,
anytime your dog doesn't follow through with a
request you call him / her to you, since the recall
is the first thing taught and it is taught in such a
way it becomes a reflex the dog always returns
to you, it is a subordinate position for the dog and
we release it by asking for a &quot;heel&quot; which is an
&quot;equal&quot; position.

His methods are very good, his understanding of
dogs is excellent, I recommend his methods.

Hey J,

I see nothings changed on the NG. Still the same
old crappy advice and misunderstanding of the
only advice worth reading.

The problem with your method J is that I can't
answer the questions on the NG no more, people
are after a quick fix, they don't want to understand
that dog training requires a disiplined method, I'm
now really understanding that they are all result
orientated, they want the dog to sit, to down, to
stay, to come, to stop it's &quot;bad&quot; behaviours, they
want to stamp out each anxiety one at a time not
realising they create a new one as they deal with
the last.

I feel sorry for them, they don't understand, they
don't even realise the errors of thier ways and
they arn't self thinkers, they follow the majority,
after all if everyone says thats the way then it
must be. I've finally realised people don't want
to learn to train dogs they want a trained dog,
they want a little puppet that sits and stays and
downs and does all the nice doggy stuff or so
they think, then when the dog acts like a dog
they come squealing to the NG asking how to
stop the dog being a dog.

I have a nice little visulisation of a dogs mind
that I think demonstrates the way we approach
dog training. Imagine lots of little circles all in a
cluster, each one representing a dog anxiety or
behaviour ( desied or not), each circle represents
something about the dog, all of them create what
a dog is.

The traditional way to train a dog is to stamp out
the &quot;bad&quot; circles, try to eliminate as many as you
can, problem is each one you stamp out another
takes it's place (anxiety circles can't be destroyed
they just change), obviously it's a futile exercise,
but thats the traditional way.

Now imagine a big circle that completely surrounds
all the small circles, this big circle is the whole dog,
that's what we get hold of with all the little circles
inside, we don't see the little circles we see the BIG
circle the macro as you put it and use that to train.

I laugh now when I see posts critisising you, they
are critising something they don't even understand
or even have the capacity to understand.

See ya,

Paul

&gt; and Anya kept trying to head out to the
&gt; sidewalk. When I didn't follow, she came
&gt; and sat beside me at heel! (Thanks to
&gt; your help!) She'd NEVER done that before.

It's the same principle as in the Hot And
Cold Exercise.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I rewarded that with a few steps of a walk,
&gt; but we came in after about 30 seconds. She
&gt; stopped and looked at me as if she were
&gt; thinking, &quot;What? But we just got out here!&quot;
&gt; The second and third times, she was even
&gt; MORE eager when she saw the leash, and
&gt; I got the same look when I turned around
&gt; to  go back in. The fourth time, she just
&gt; bounced a bit as she walked to the door
&gt; with me, and sat nicely to wait until I hooked
&gt; up the leash, and this last time, I HAD
&gt; TO CALL  HER TO ME!!!!!!!!!!
">

Fine. That's because dogs learn on the basis of
four repetitions. That's not to say they can't learn
some things faster, but for breaking habits, it
usually happens the fourth time we repeat a lesson.

Then we need to repeat the lesson at three more
locations our time in each to generalize the idea.
Let's say your dog gets excited when you take her
lead and go to the front door. She would probably
do the same at the back door, but to not such a degree.

Likewise for any other door.

It would behoove you to repeat the exercise with
several other doors and it would be easiest to
start with a door that had less excitement involved
with it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If I knew it would be that easy, I would have
&gt; done this a long time ago saving myself 5
&gt; years of dealing with a bouncy, over excited dog!
">

The non force methods work fast and easy
because we are not challenging the dog or
calling our attention to their behavior problems.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have to tell you how the walk is going though.
&gt; I have a lot of problems there, but it is all ME.
&gt; I have been so conditioned to &quot;correct&quot; her,
&gt; that I still find myself yanking on her collar.
">

Yes, those habits are hard to break. It's easier for
me to train a person who has no experience at all
because they have no bad habits of pulling and
forcing control.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I feel so awful! We have only been working
&gt; in the yard without distractions, because I
&gt; honestly don't know what will happen if she
&gt; sees another dog and I won't have the pinch
&gt; collar to keep her from dragging me over for
&gt; a fight.
">

You know that working the dog in the back
yard is not preferable, because that causes
them some anxiety because it's their free area.
But with your dog and with the difficulty he is
to handle, I don't see any reason you shouldn't
do the Family Leadership Exercise and the come
command several times out there, and then you'll
have the control to do it in a more neutral area.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The upside is, when I take the leash off it's
&gt; hook and don't take the pinch collar, her
&gt; excitement to go for a walk is NO LONGER
&gt; combined with the intense fear I used to see
&gt; in her eyes at the sight of the pinch!
">

Our group likes to think that is EXCITEMENT and
eagerness to work. It is sheer terror. The pinch
collar works by overriding the opposition reflex
through fear and that cause tremendous stress
and anxiety that must be released through anxiety
relief mechanisms like barking, digging, whining,
chewing, self mutilation and aggression.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That does it for me. I can't believe I instilled
&gt; fear in my beautiful dog just for the  sake that
&gt; I didn't know how to train. Well, I still don't
&gt; know how, but I'm learning!
">

That's where I was three dozen years ago. I was
ready to just quit. I wasn't going to sour any more
dogs to make them work.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thanks for your help. Please send more
&gt; suggestions if you saw something I could
&gt; be doing differently!
&gt; Jenn &amp; Anya
">

I was thinking about your difficulties with
your dog. Just getting the Hot And Cold
Exercise and the Family Leadership Exercise
and the come command installed will solve
most of your difficulty with him.

I presume you've got msn messenger. We
can speak over that if you are set up for it,
and I can demonstrate the timing and tone
and tempo for using sound distractions
and praise, or we could speak on the phone.

The most important thing to remember is to
pick up and handle the lead in a relaxed manner,
no white knuckles, keep your elbow relaxed and
your arm down at your side with the length of the
lead breaking just below the knee.

Let me know if you need further help.

&gt; Hello Jerry,
&gt; He is adorable. Because of the way he behaves
&gt; (walking politely without straining on his lead),
&gt; people think that he is an adult rather than just
&gt; 14 weeks.
&gt; He follows me everywhere and every time I look
&gt; up from what I am doing I find that he is looking
&gt; at me. In the woods he follows off lead and he
&gt; continually checks back. I have introduced him
&gt; to everything that I can think of (dogs, cats, people
&gt; of all different races, giants, dwarfs, kids, bicycles,
&gt; motorcycles, cars, trains, airplanes, thunder,
&gt; firecrackers, skateboards, horses, ducks, geese,
&gt; downtown, etc.)
&gt; He feels comfortable everywhere now.
&gt; Besides retrieving, I have now taught him to search
&gt; for things based on scent. I show him the item and
&gt; then hide it and he will locate it by scent and then
&gt; bring it to me--and I only have to shock him once to
&gt; get him to obey. Just kidding about the shock.
&gt; My girlfriend thinks I am crazy for praising him for
&gt; everything. When I am talking to her on the phone
&gt; and I say &quot;Good Boy, good boy&quot; she thinks that he
&gt; just shit on my floor. Ha, ha.
&gt; When I put him on his leash to go out, he now
&gt; waits for me to say &quot;Kit Outside&quot;. And when we
&gt; come back he waits for me to say &quot;Kit Inside&quot;.
&gt; When I leave without him, I tell him where I am
&gt; going and that I will be back soon. He doesn't
&gt; bark or cause any trouble while I am gone.
&gt; However I might have to buy a DDR so that I
&gt; can live in peace with the dogs in my adjacent
&gt; apartment.

Just use the same same techniques on them,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have taught him to sit quietly on my 3rd floor
&gt; patio and to not bark at other dogs or at passers-by.
&gt; Oh heck, I can't think of everything I have taught him.
&gt; I always think of him from a training perspective. If I
&gt; am displeased with his behavior, then I train him. At
&gt; the vet's yesterday he picked something off the floor
&gt; and some lady got all excited and said &quot;Oh my god,
&gt; he's got something in his mouth&quot;. She began to chase
&gt; him to get it out. Ha, ha. Think you could catch him?
&gt;  I just called him over and said &quot;Out&quot; and he gave it to me.
&gt; You should have seen those people's jaws drop when he
&gt; dropped that ball point pen cap in my hand.
&gt; The vet wanted to examine his teeth. He griped him
&gt; tightly and began to force his mouth open. Kit snapped
&gt; at him. So the vet grabs him on either side of his head,
&gt; sticks his face down close to Kit, glares into his eyes
&gt; and says No!
&gt; The vet wasn't too happy when I said let me show
&gt; you how. I held his face gently, told Kit &quot;Good boy,
&gt; good boy&quot;, and gently opened his mouth and showed
&gt; the vet his teeth. I did the same when they gave him
&gt; his shots.
&gt; Those vets aren't very kind to dogs. I asked them
&gt; why they always take a rectal temperature when
&gt; I visit for scheduled shots. They don't' have a good
&gt; answer.
&gt; I have met a number of people in the park who said
&gt; that they owned Welsh Corgis. &quot;We have to warn you&quot;,
&gt; they say, &quot;they will chew up your house&quot;.
&gt; They got mad and walked away when I tried to explain
&gt; that that wouldn't happen if you raised them properly.
&gt; I think that I know why their dogs weren't walking in
&gt; the park with them. &quot;They are yippers&quot;, some of them
&gt; said. They also got mad and walked away when I
&gt; tried to explaining that that wouldn't happen if you
&gt; trained them properly.
&gt; Oh well, it seems that most people think that a
&gt; dog is born either good or bad. They never blame
&gt; themselves, they always blame the dog.
&gt; The remarkable thing that I see is that Kit's personality
&gt; is becoming unbelievably close to Duke's (my previous
&gt; Golden Retriever). I think that it is because I am raising
&gt; him in the same way as I raised Duke, using praise and
&gt; sound distraction with praise and no corrections.
&gt; I am so pleased.
&gt; It seems that these Corgis naturally want to herd.
&gt; And you have to train them to not nip the heels of
&gt; children. Perhaps I will get to the herding hand
&gt; signals later, but I don't know that I will really have
&gt; any use for them unless I happen to move to a farm.

Thanks Jerry,

I enjoyed the scientific discussion debunking
operant conditioning for teaching thinking animals.
Humans think by forming concepts. All of their
knowledge is held as a hierarchy of concepts
(more complex concepts defined in terms of
simpler ones). In my mind, to treat such a being
as a B. F. Skinner robot is criminal.

I don't believe that dogs hold their knowledge
as concepts as do humans but their ability to
think is unquestionable.

Operant conditioning doesn't utilize an animal's
ability to think. When you show a dog what you
want them to do, then they are able to grasp the
problem; they are able to think about it and to
integrate possible solutions into their mind.

But with operant conditioning a trainer is actually
hiding the problem to be solved from the animal.

For example, it is good for your dog's attention to
be upon you. When heeling, he will notice your
movements, your subtle hand signals, your facial
expressions and he will immediately sense your
next command. But the clicker trainers have forgotten
the reasons why a dog's attention should be upon you.

So they condition a dog to unnaturally cock his head
to stare upward at you. The dog doesn't appreciate
the meaning of this and neither does the trainer. Since
this unnatural behavior is prized in the obedience ring,
the clicker trainers are motivated to condition it.

Don't you think that the &quot;high five&quot; hand shake that
clicker trainers use to motivate novices looks like a
Nazi salute (an unthinking reflex). It is not at all like
a warm hand shake from a loving companion, is it?

Some of your testimonials bring tears to my eyes. I
love to see how some &quot;thinking&quot; people appreciate
your methods.

Jen, your request for a positive only dog training list,
needs the same answer as I give the folk who ask why
I don't have a list for what I do with biofeedback.

The method is so simple, and if you adopt it and relate
to your dog in such a positive manner you won't have
any more problems and there is no need for any more
technique.

With Puppies we Ph.D. psychologists have been
outflanked by the entirely practical and effective
methods described in
http://www.freewebs.com/thesimplyamazingpuppywizard
Free download, nothing sold, no mailing list, no
distribution of your name. Free support if needed.

With ADHD kids I provide similar information at
www.drbiofeedback.com and there is no need for
a list dealing with problems with kids.  Apply
as directed and have happy healthy doggies or
kiddies.

Not difficult.

George von Hilsheimer, Ph.D., F.R.S.H.

P.S. jerk and choke, spanking, shocking, scruff shake,
choke, chin chucks, all those negatives, denial of
affection etc. are harmful, dranging, obscenities.

You might want to consider Pavlov's typology to
understand &quot;hard and soft dogs&quot; - essentially he
taught that there are outward and inward responding
organisms in weak and strong nervous systems and
if you grasp this firmly you'll shape your training
methods effectively.

Punishment ALWAYS deranges behavior, and so is
recommended and given only by deranged humans.

Of course, it doesn't matter if we are talking
dogs, cats, people, sheep, even husbands.

Dear Mr. Puppy Wizard,

I have, of late, come to recognize your genius
and now must applaud your attempts to save
animals from painful training procedures.

You are indeed a hero, a man of exceptional talent­,
who tirelessly devotes his days to crafting posts ­
to alert the world to animal abuse.

We are lucky to have you, and more people should
come to their senses and support your valuable
work.

Have you thought of establishing a nonprofit
charity to fund your important work?

Have you thought about holding a press conference
so others can learn of your highly worthwhile
and significant work?

In closing, my only suggestion is that you
try to keep your messages short for most
readers may refuse to read a long message
even if it is from the wise, heroic Puppy Wizard.

I wish you well in your endeavors.
