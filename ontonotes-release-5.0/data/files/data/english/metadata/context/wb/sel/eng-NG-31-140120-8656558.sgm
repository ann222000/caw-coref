And you're sure they were the same scouts that recommended Cain and
Lincecum?  Are those who scout high school and college players the same
scouts who scout at the major league level?

Lincecum is too early to tell, but Cain hasn't improved this year but
has regressed slightly.  While Cain's ERA is so far better this year
than last year, his WHIP and BAA have been worse.  And in the previous
years, Cain was able to pitch deeper into the games.

And Lowry hasn't improved either but has stayed about the same (with the
exception of his WHIP which has steadily gotten worse each year).

Also, how often to you hear or read about ANY of the Giants pitchers
complimenting Righetti on helping them become better pitchers?  In the
past, Giants pitchers used to regularly give props to the pitching coach
for helping them become better pitchers, but since Righetti arrived nary
a good word is said about him by the pitchers.

(The only person who regularly compliments Righetti is Mike Krukow, but
he likes EVERYBODY.)

While Righetti might not be the number one problem with the Giants
pitching staff, he is definitely not part of the solution, IMHO.

I don't remember Giants pitchers heaping praise upon previous pitching
coaches.  If there is a change, however, I think it could have to do
with something trivial like the reporting habits of the beat writers.

Who knows?  Jason Schmidt went from being an average pitcher to a
perennial Cy Young candidate.  Scott Eyre pitched amazingly well for the
Giants despite pitching like garbage before and after.  Are Schmidt's
and Eyre's success due to Righetti's influence?  I don't know. But I do
know that for every pitching disappointment that you can offer up during
Righetti's tenure, I can counter with a surprising success.

I wouldn't be upset if Righetti was replaced.  He is not Leo Mazzone.
But I don't think the Giants should replace Righetti just for the hell
of it. I don't see any evidence that he is having an adverse impact on
the pitching staff.

Wow.  Lowry was so bad last year that I couldn't believe his WHIP was worse
this year, so I had to look it up.  Of course, you're right.  But it's
interesting that while his WHIP has gone up each year, his ERA has gone down
each year (except last year).  I don't know what this means, or if it has
anything to do with Rag.  What I do know is that he used to get his
strikeouts with his changeup and his changeup has gone progressively
ineffective each year.  He's changed the way he pitch, more curve and less
changeup, I think.

I'm one of Lowry's biggest fans, so I'm very happy he's doing so well this
year.  Yet I don't really understand why he's doing so well right now with
the stuff he has, and think he could easily blow up next year.  So while I'd
*hate* to trade him, I think it *might* be a good idea.  But that really
depends on what we can get back, because he's so inexpensive and doesn't
really hurt the team in terms of salary at all.  I'm afraid the chances are
we'd get some crap back for him and he'll become an outstanding pitcher in a
different uniform.  That would really suck!

Unless you're going to argue that Righetti used to be good and isn't any
more, then that's the wrong question.  A better question, IMO, is
whether you would have taken their careers so far if you were asked on
the day they were called up (or brought in from elsewhere).  I think
with Cain and Lincecum the answer has to be yes, and with Lowry it's a
huge yes.  The only current pitcher who I think would be the other way
would be Zito.  I mean, did anyone expect Hennessey to be a lights out
closer?

Looking back, and figuring that the pitching coach is more responsible
for young pitchers than established guys, I think the only two flameouts
(at the major league level) in recent years were Foppert, which was an
injury thing (and not an injury because of misuse in the majors; it must
have happened before), and Jerome Williams.  So you can blame the
pitching coach in that case if you want, although it must count for
something that no one else could get Jerome straightened out, either.

I don't think coaches are very important, at any rate, but it's hard to
see how he's to blame for anything.

Righetti surely helped Schmidt in various ways, but for the key change
in pitch selection that proved more effective than what he was doing as
a Pirate Schmidt did not give Righetti the credit. IIRC it was in his
very first start as a Giant, against the Pirates, when he began to use
that changeup more, and he gave credit for that to Santiago afterward.

He was just a year removed from surgery to repair a frayed rotator cuff
when the Giants got him, and part of his improvement through that period
and in the next year must have been due to returning strength. Looking
at his game log now for 2001, his performances aren't so neatly divided
into &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; categories. He was definitely better after
becoming a Giant, but there was no immediate vault into the top tier of
NL pitchers.

Whatever sort of program Righetti offers, he doesn't appear to be one of
those guys who monitors and makes adjustments to delivery mechanics. Not
that it's never happened, but I can't recall just now any cases of
pitchers saying things like, &quot;He noticed that I was throwing my
different pitches from different arm slots, and the hitters were keying
on that, and he worked with me to correct it.&quot; That's what BFI said, in
so many words, about Randy St. Claire's contribution to his improved
effectiveness in 2003. Or, &quot;He noticed I was taking the ball from my
glove at a differently, and it impeded my delivery,&quot; or whatever Russ
Ortiz more or less said about Leo Mazzone's advice last year.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Who knows?  Jason Schmidt went from being an average pitcher to a

changeup
&gt; &gt; &gt; as a strikeout pitch.

&gt; &gt; I don't remember who he gave the credit to, but I do remember watching a
&gt; &gt; special Schmidt segment once, and they talked about how Schmidt was a
&gt; &gt; fastball/slider pitcher in Pittsburgh, and changed to a
fastball/changeup
&gt; &gt; pitcher as a Giant.  The segment interviewed a number of hitters, and I
&gt; &gt; *think* one of them was Todd Helton who said he used to like to hit
against
&gt; &gt; Schmidt but after the switch he became unhittable.

&gt; Righetti surely helped Schmidt in various ways, but for the key change
&gt; in pitch selection that proved more effective than what he was doing as
&gt; a Pirate Schmidt did not give Righetti the credit. IIRC it was in his
&gt; very first start as a Giant, against the Pirates, when he began to use
&gt; that changeup more, and he gave credit for that to Santiago afterward.

Maybe he needed some time to perfect his changeup.  It might be asking too
much to think that the moment he switched, he'd immediately dominate the
league.  If his changeup was that good he would've discovered it much
earlier in his career.

I just remember another story now.  Schmidt supposedly never ate anything on
the day of his starts, until he came to the Giants and someone corrected
him.  Was that Rag, or someone else?  (Not that it was some super wise
advice anyway; Schmidt was simply stupid.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With all the ragging of our bullpen, one would think they might have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; turned it around.  Instead they have almost totally imploded.  Who pitched
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the best recently. The two guys they brought up from the minors.  Atchison
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (not even sure of the spelling) and  Wilson.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wait ... Rags will set the new guys straight and their ERA will start
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; soaring.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Agreed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's just a matter of time before Rag's expert pitching advice rubs off
&gt;&gt;&gt; on them.

&gt;&gt; Yes, he's certainly ruined Cain, Lincecum, and Lowry with his awful
&gt;&gt; coaching.

&gt;Lincecum is too early to tell, but Cain hasn't improved this year but
&gt;has regressed slightly.  While Cain's ERA is so far better this year
&gt;than last year, his WHIP and BAA have been worse.  And in the previous
&gt;years, Cain was able to pitch deeper into the games.

&gt;And Lowry hasn't improved either but has stayed about the same (with the
&gt;exception of his WHIP which has steadily gotten worse each year).

&gt;Also, how often to you hear or read about ANY of the Giants pitchers
&gt;complimenting Righetti on helping them become better pitchers?  In the
&gt;past, Giants pitchers used to regularly give props to the pitching coach
&gt;for helping them become better pitchers, but since Righetti arrived nary
&gt;a good word is said about him by the pitchers.

&gt;(The only person who regularly compliments Righetti is Mike Krukow, but
&gt;he likes EVERYBODY.)

&gt;While Righetti might not be the number one problem with the Giants
&gt;pitching staff, he is definitely not part of the solution, IMHO.
">

My goodness, you tripped all over yourself there to try to defend your
rather weak (and yet very common on this newsgroup) position that it's all
Righetti's fault that these scrub pitchers pitch like scrubs when they
come to the big leagues.  It was the same thing when some of you
ignoramuses blamed Felipe Alou for all the team's problems, but yet they
continue to suck with a manager who has won several NL West titles.

Righetti is an adequate, but unspectacular pitching coach.  He's now been
retained through three Giants managers, which I personally think is a
mistake.  One of the things I like least about Sabean is how he foists
previous regime's coaches down the new manager's throat.  Your manager
should pick his coaching staff.  Period.  But while I would have allowed
Bochy to pick his own pitching coach, I seriously doubt that Righetti is
to blame for our pitching woes when it's pretty apparent that the talented
guys do well, the older washed guys pitch like older washed guys, and the
scrubs pitch like scrubs.

Like everything else with the Giants, the problem is talent, not coaching.
Put a talented team on the field first and THEN if they don't perform, you
can whine about coaching.

I know you've made this point before and just as I did before, I don't
agree with it. Not without knowing the absolute inside scoop, anyway.

We know that Bochy brought Tim Flannery with him from San Diego. That
was not Sabean's doing. In conjunction with that, the previous regime's
third and first base coaches (Gene Glynn and Luis Pujols) were
dismissed. Maybe that was Sabean's doing but it's pretty much of a given
that Flannery was brought in to replace Glynn in the third base box.

As for Righetti, once again, it is not a known fact that Sabean forced
him down Bochy's throat (sorry for that not-so-pretty picture). I do
remember Bochy saying very early on (in spring training, I believe) how
happy he was that Righetti was retained as pitching coach. Naturally, I
don't give that much credibility because I am so used to anybody in
Giants management spoon-feeding pablum to usso we'll behave and be quiet
little babies about all things Giants.

For me, I believe that Bochy, just as he did with Flannery, could have
brought in other coaches if he had been unhappy or dissatisfied with
those who were already here. I just don't believe (until I hear
otherwise from someone in the know on the inside) that Sabean forced
coaches on Bochy that the latter didn't want.

Looks like I remembered some of the details wrong.  Sounds like he actually
started eating before he became a Giant.  Someone posted it here a few years
ago.  It's quite interesting rereading it again.

I meant: coaches at the major league level are not very important.

I'm sure that good coaching matters a lot in high school and earlier.

Once they get to the professional level, I don't know whether or not
coaching matters, but I very much doubt that there's a lot of variation
between organizations.  So, it's possible that having good coaching at
the minor league level is way better than no coaching at all at the
minor league level, but in reality the difference is between good
coaching and not-quite-as-good coaching.

But at the major league level?  I don't think it matters much, in most
cases.

I'm really not sure about this. I mean there are organizations that
are good at finding talent. But some (like the Twins under Kelly)
aren't particularly good at turning talent into players, while
others (the Braves come to mind) have a great record at turning
prospects into players.

OK, Twins in particular could just be a systematic mis-evaluation
of the prospects in question.

I also have little doubt that bad coaches can ruin a player, while
even the most successful hitting coach I can think of -- Ted Williams
--
had very little long-term impact. Look at his record and you'll see
an amazing amount of short-term gain, but within two years pretty
much everybody was back where they started.
