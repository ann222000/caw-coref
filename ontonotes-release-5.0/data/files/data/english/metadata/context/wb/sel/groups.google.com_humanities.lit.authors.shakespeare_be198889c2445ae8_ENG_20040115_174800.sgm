-------------------------------------------------------
Babylonian Captivity

&lt;&lt;For twenty and one days I did no work and he drank no wine for twenty
and one days. For he had made a certain request of the Lord. And on the
twenty and first day there came an angel and said. &quot;O Daniel, a man
greatly beloved, from the first day that your request was made, I was
sent. But the prince of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: until
Michael the prince came and helped me. Now what is thy request?

I read the letter that Jeremiah the prophet wrote to those that were
bound in Babylon that their captivity should be long even SEVENTY years.
And they should plant vineyards and eat of the fruit and marry and give
in marriage and seek the peace where they were dwelling for with its
peace was their peace also. Now I would know about the SEVENTY.

And the angel said there are SEVENTY weeks of years determined upon thy
people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make
an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in
everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and
to anoint the most Holy. Then I said, I would know the meaning of the
last seven.

And he said, they are sealed until the time of the end. Then I said the
second time, but I would know the meaning of the last seven. Again he
said they are sealed until the time of the end. People will run to and
fro and knowledge shall increase.

And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and
sealed till the time of the end and thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot
at the end of the days. Now I must return and continue to fight
with the prince of Persia.

So I knew but I understood not. Then I returned and worked of the king
as before, Oh if I could only understand the meaning of the last seven!
At the time of the end many shall hear and understand! Daniel 9:2--;
Daniel 10:20--&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;In the Talmud story when Joseph is brought before Pharaoh,
the throne is at the top of SEVENTY steps.
Joseph came up 3 steps and Pharaoh came down 4 steps and the
two spoke to each other. They are now separated by 63 steps.&gt;&gt;

1609 Sonnets Quarto, old-fashioned spelling.

63
AGain?t my loue ?hall be as I am now
With times iniurious hand chru?ht and ore-worne,

49
AGain?t that time ( if ever that time come )
When I ?hall ?ee thee frowne on my defects,
----------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Sonnet 63 shares the same opening words as sonnet 49. The numbers of
the two are important, as they are climacteric numbers, and were for the
Elizabethans crucial years in a person's life. According to some, all
the years denoted by multiples of 7 (7, 14, 21, etc.) were climacterics:
others admitted only the odd multiples of 7 (7, 21, 35, etc.); some
included also the multiples of 9. The 63rd year of life (63 = 7 × 9),
supposed to be specially critical. (According to some, the 81st year
(81 = 9 × 9) was also a grand climacteric.) The astrologers were deeply
concerned for Elizabeth's welfare in her 63rd year and foretold numerous
disasters. The fact that Elizabeth survived her grand climacteric
(1596) was a matter of some import. The 'sad augurs' (Sonnet 107) must
have thought it most unlikely that she would survive, but in the end had
to 'mock their own presage'. They had already predicted dire calamity
for 1588, a year which was exactly 70 years after Martin Luther
had defied the Pope, an event which marked the end of
a cycle of human affairs. And 70 years was exactly the span
of the Babylonian Captivity (See Daniel &amp; Revelation).&gt;&gt;

GENESIS 4:23 And LAMEcH said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah,
Hear my voice; ye wives of LAMEcH, hearken unto my speech:
for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly LAMEcH SEVENTY and sevenfold.

&lt;&lt;Athens put Socrates on trial in 399 B.C. when he was 70,
a ripe old age at the time. Socrates boasted about how the
Oracle at Delphi declared that Socrates was the wisest,
most free, just, and prudent man in the world. In other words,

&quot;I am a fool, but I know I'm a fool
and that makes me smarter than you.&quot;

The jury convicted him on both counts. Then Socrates asked
that his penalty be that he be declared a civic hero and
fed at the public table for life! That did not go over too well.
The jury, incensed, gave out the death penalty.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------------------

James, son of Alphaeus, also an apostle (Matthew 10:3, etc.), is known
as James the Lesser. He was clubbed to death and is often confused
with &quot;James, the brother of the Lord.&quot;

This James is the presumed author of the New Testament's Letter of James.
He may have been Jesus' cousin; other members of his family headed
the Church in Jerusalem until that city was destroyed in 70 A.D.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PSALM 70:1 MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME;
MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them
be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. Let them
be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, AHA, AHA.

&lt;&lt;[François RABELAIS] died in a Paris house in the street called La Rue
de' Jardins, aged 70. His enemies, the monks and some others tell us,
that he seemed much less concerned &quot;when he paid the grand shot of life,
than when he discharged A SMALL TAVERN RECKONING.&quot; Rabelais being very
sick, Cardinal Du Bellay sent his page to him, to have an account of
his condition; his answer was, &quot;Tell my Lord, in what circumstances
thou findet me; I am just going to leap into the dark. He is up in the
cock-loft, bid him keep where he is. As for thee, thoul't always be a
fool: let down the curtain, the farce is done.&quot; He left a paper sealed
up, wherein were found three articles, as his last will, &quot;I owe much,
I have nothing, I give the rest to the poor.&quot; He lies buried in
St. Paul's Church yard, at the foot of a great tree still to be seen.&gt;&gt;

&quot;A grizzly bear represented the many bears seen in [California].&quot;

&lt;&lt;&quot;Among the men who remained to hold Sonoma was
William L. Todd who painted, on a piece of brown
cotton, a yard and a half or so in length, with old
red or brown paint that he happened to find, what he
intended to be a representation of a grizzly bear. This
was raised to the top of the staff, some 70 feet from the
ground. Native Californians looking up at it were heard
to say 'COCHE,' the common name among them for PIG or
shoat. More than thirty years afterwards I chanced to
meet Todd on the train coming up the Sacramento Valley.
He informed me that Mrs. Lincoln was his aunt, and that
he had been brought up in the family of Abraham Lincoln.&quot;&gt;&gt;

Chapter One

A never writer to
an ever reader:
News.

In which Pickleherring takes his pen to tell
of his first meeting with Mr Shakespeare

I had never before been spoken to by a man in a copataine hat. Mr
Shakespeare was tall and thin, and he wore that hat with an air of great
authority. He had also a quilted silken doublet, goose-turd green; grey
velvet hose; and a scarlet cloak. Never believe those who tell you he
was not a dandy.

This first meeting of ours took place in the yard of a tavern
called the Cock. A small rain fell like brightness from the air.
Ah, what a dream it seems now, SEVENTY years away.

&lt;&lt;Abimelech: A son of Gideon (Judg. 9:1), who was proclaimed king after
the death of his father (Judg. 8:33-9:6). One of his first acts was to
murder his brothers, SEVENTY in number, &quot;on one stone,&quot; at Ophrah. Only
one named Jotham escaped. He was an unprincipled, ambitious ruler, often
engaged in war with his own subjects. When engaged in reducing the town
of Thebez, which had revolted, he was struck mortally on his head by a
mill-stone, thrown by the hand of a woman from the wall above.

Perceiving that the wound was mortal, he desired
his ARMOUR-BEARER to THRUST HIM THROUGH WITH HIS SWORD,
that it might not be said he had perished
by the hand of a woman (Judg. 9:50-57).&gt;&gt;

The History of Herodotus
Written 440 B.C.E By Herodotus
Translated by George Rawlinson

&lt;&lt;&quot;Oh! Croesus,&quot; replied the other, &quot;thou askedst a question concerning
the condition of man, of one who knows that the power above us is full
of jealousy, and fond of troubling our lot. A long life gives one to
witness much, and experience much oneself, that one would not choose.

SEVENTY years I regard as the limit of the life of man. In these SEVENTY
years are contained, without reckoning intercalary months, twenty-five
thousand and two hundred days. Add an intercalary month to every other
year, that the seasons may come round at the right time, and there
will be, besides the SEVENTY years, thirty-five such months, making an
addition of one thousand and fifty days. The whole number of the days
contained in the SEVENTY years will thus be twenty-six thousand two
hundred and fifty, whereof not one but will produce events
unlike the rest. Hence man is wholly accident.&quot;&gt;&gt;

March 15, 1604 coronation parade:

&lt;&lt;Beyond an arch at Temple Bar, [James] was stopped by a tailpiece,
thrown up at the last moment, in which a rainbow, the sun, moon, and
the Pleidades soared between two 70 foot obelisks, and a human comet,
Electra, hailed him as the new AUGUSTUS of the British Isles.&gt;&gt;
