Scientists test out-of-body experiences

Virtual-reality experiments give subjects that disembodied feeling

By Dave Mosher       LiveScience       August 23, 2007

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

New virtual-reality experiments show the brain can be tricked into
believing it's outside the body, lending credence to the strange
claims of some patients and shedding light on how the brain might
generate its &quot;self-image.&quot;

&quot;We have decades of intense research on visual perception, but not
very much yet on body perception,&quot; said Henrik Ehrsson of University
College London.

&quot;But that may change, now [that] virtual reality offers a way to
manipulate full-body perception more systematically and probe out-of-
body experiences,&quot; said Olaf Blanke, a Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology neuroscientist.

The researchers worked on separate studies, which are detailed
Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.

Researchers equipped subjects with virtual-reality goggles that showed
images from a stereoscopic video camera setup - two cameras spaced
like a pair of eyes. When placed behind the person wearing the
goggles, the cameras acted as a &quot;virtual self&quot; that looked at the
subject's back.

As subjects watched themselves from behind, an experimenter prodded
their chests with one hand while prodding the air just below the
cameras at the same time. Because subjects could see the
experimenter's hand but not the spot it was poking, researchers said
subjects felt as if they were being poked in the chest - outside their
bodies.

&quot;This was a bizarre, fascinating experience for the participants,&quot;
Ehrsson said. &quot;It felt absolutely real for them and was not scary.
Many of them giggled and said 'Wow, this is so weird.'&quot;

Where's my body?

But the researchers didn't stop there. They also performed the
experiment with cameras behind a wigged mannequin to test the brain's
limits of self-perception.

&quot;When they saw a bodily shape, they still felt it was them,&quot; said
Bigna Lenggenhager, a psychologist also with the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology. She explained that touching both the fake
body and the real body at the same time tricked many of the subjects.

&quot;They felt a touch was there but couldn't pinpoint it,&quot; Lenggenhager
said, noting that some felt as if the mannequin was their own body.

Going even further to test the effect, researchers removed subjects'
goggles and asked them to move to where they believed they were
standing during the experiment. Almost every time, she said, they
overshot and walked back to their virtual self's location - and not
where their real or simulated body was situated.

&quot;They didn't localize themselves where their real body was,&quot;
Lenggenhager told LiveScience.com. &quot;Where the camera was is where they
believed they were.&quot;

Ehrsson's group also tested the technique's limits by swinging a
hammer just below the camera setup, or virtual self. By measuring how
much subjects sweated - a bodily response to fear - Ehrsson said he
showed that subjects felt threatened by the hammer swings.

Lenggenhager noted that the setup, while an extremely useful tool for
testing the limits of self-perception, is only the beginning of better
research on the brain.

&quot;We've shown the body and self is somehow separate in the brain, even
though we didn't invoke a completely realistic [out-of-body
experience],&quot; she said. Lenggenhager thinks the next step is to
monitor the brain's activity with special electrodes during similar
experiments. By doing so, the researcher and her colleagues hope to
better understand which regions of the brain are responsible for self-
perception.

imho, all this shows is that if you bombard the visual information channels,
the brain works as it's been design and tries to compute the input .. if the
input doesn't compute as per a lifetime of patterns things go a little weird
for the perceiver  ... bottom line being these experiments are NOT
simulating anything like what an out-of-body, or near death experience is
about .. because in those 'tradional' situations the brian is NOT processing
physical light vision data as is done on these experiements ..

But that's just my opinion ... fwiw

Sean,

Maybe somebody is trying to redefine O.O.B. experiences
according to academia. I mean, if the experimenters actually
had O.O.B. experiences themselves and were adept at Soul
Travel, would they compare sensations from virtual reality ex-
periments with same?

In the article I read it mentioned &quot;out-of-body sensations&quot;.

&quot;Exploring the connection between our mental and physical
perceptions of ourselves, scientists said Thursday [08/23/07]
that they used virtual reality goggles to induce out-of-body
sensations in healthy volunteers. [....]&quot;

However, the title and subtitle in the newspaper headline
read:

&quot;Virtual reality experiments fool brain / Test subjects reported
feeling an out-of-body experience during illusion.&quot;

Semantics, perhaps, are the real illusion.

&gt; &gt; Scientists test out-of-body experiences

&gt; &gt; Virtual-reality experiments give subjects that disembodied feeling

&gt; &gt; By Dave Mosher       LiveScience       August 23, 2007

&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ­-----

&gt; &gt; New virtual-reality experiments show the brain can be tricked into
&gt; &gt; believing it's outside the body, lending credence to the strange
&gt; &gt; claims of some patients and shedding light on how the brain might
&gt; &gt; generate its &quot;self-image.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &quot;We have decades of intense research on visual perception, but not
&gt; &gt; very much yet on body perception,&quot; said Henrik Ehrsson of University
&gt; &gt; College London.

&gt; &gt; &quot;But that may change, now [that] virtual reality offers a way to
&gt; &gt; manipulate full-body perception more systematically and probe out-of-
&gt; &gt; body experiences,&quot; said Olaf Blanke, a Swiss Federal Institute of
&gt; &gt; Technology neuroscientist.

&gt; &gt; The researchers worked on separate studies, which are detailed
&gt; &gt; Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.

&gt; &gt; Researchers equipped subjects with virtual-reality goggles that showed
&gt; &gt; images from a stereoscopic video camera setup - two cameras spaced
&gt; &gt; like a pair of eyes. When placed behind the person wearing the
&gt; &gt; goggles, the cameras acted as a &quot;virtual self&quot; that looked at the
&gt; &gt; subject's back.

&gt; &gt; As subjects watched themselves from behind, an experimenter prodded
&gt; &gt; their chests with one hand while prodding the air just below the
&gt; &gt; cameras at the same time. Because subjects could see the
&gt; &gt; experimenter's hand but not the spot it was poking, researchers said
&gt; &gt; subjects felt as if they were being poked in the chest - outside their
&gt; &gt; bodies.

&gt; &gt; &quot;This was a bizarre, fascinating experience for the participants,&quot;
&gt; &gt; Ehrsson said. &quot;It felt absolutely real for them and was not scary.
&gt; &gt; Many of them giggled and said 'Wow, this is so weird.'&quot;

&gt; &gt; Where's my body?

&gt; &gt; But the researchers didn't stop there. They also performed the
&gt; &gt; experiment with cameras behind a wigged mannequin to test the brain's
&gt; &gt; limits of self-perception.

&gt; &gt; &quot;When they saw a bodily shape, they still felt it was them,&quot; said
&gt; &gt; Bigna Lenggenhager, a psychologist also with the Swiss Federal
&gt; &gt; Institute of Technology. She explained that touching both the fake
&gt; &gt; body and the real body at the same time tricked many of the subjects.

&gt; &gt; &quot;They felt a touch was there but couldn't pinpoint it,&quot; Lenggenhager
&gt; &gt; said, noting that some felt as if the mannequin was their own body.

&gt; &gt; Going even further to test the effect, researchers removed subjects'
&gt; &gt; goggles and asked them to move to where they believed they were
&gt; &gt; standing during the experiment. Almost every time, she said, they
&gt; &gt; overshot and walked back to their virtual self's location - and not
&gt; &gt; where their real or simulated body was situated.

&gt; &gt; &quot;They didn't localize themselves where their real body was,&quot;
&gt; &gt; Lenggenhager told LiveScience.com. &quot;Where the camera was is where they
&gt; &gt; believed they were.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Ehrsson's group also tested the technique's limits by swinging a
&gt; &gt; hammer just below the camera setup, or virtual self. By measuring how
&gt; &gt; much subjects sweated - a bodily response to fear - Ehrsson said he
&gt; &gt; showed that subjects felt threatened by the hammer swings.

&gt; &gt; Lenggenhager noted that the setup, while an extremely useful tool for
&gt; &gt; testing the limits of self-perception, is only the beginning of better
&gt; &gt; research on the brain.

&gt; &gt; &quot;We've shown the body and self is somehow separate in the brain, even
&gt; &gt; though we didn't invoke a completely realistic [out-of-body
&gt; &gt; experience],&quot; she said. Lenggenhager thinks the next step is to
&gt; &gt; monitor the brain's activity with special electrodes during similar
&gt; &gt; experiments. By doing so, the researcher and her colleagues hope to
&gt; &gt; better understand which regions of the brain are responsible for self-
&gt; &gt; perception.

Sean,

Maybe somebody is trying to redefine O.O.B. experiences
according to academia. I mean, if the experimenters actually
had O.O.B. experiences themselves and were adept at Soul
Travel, would they compare sensations from virtual reality ex-
periments with same?

In the article I read it mentioned &quot;out-of-body sensations&quot;.

&quot;Exploring the connection between our mental and physical
perceptions of ourselves, scientists said Thursday [08/23/07]
that they used virtual reality goggles to induce out-of-body
sensations in healthy volunteers. [....]&quot;

However, the title and subtitle in the newspaper headline
read:

&quot;Virtual reality experiments fool brain / Test subjects reported
feeling an out-of-body experience during illusion.&quot;

Semantics, perhaps, are the real illusion.

Do you have a soul?

To know truth you must have a deep desire to see it, and a willingness
to let go of the old lies.

When I was a child, I was an atheist and only believed in what I
could see and touch.  By age 19 I started to believe in the existence
of souls and reincarnation as a result of my exposure to a number of
famous Indian yogis and the majestic J. Krishnamurti, who once claimed
to have remembered all of his past lives.  At age 21 my belief in soul
was dramatically reinforced by explosive experiences I had with
Acharya Rajneesh, later known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and Osho.  I
never believed in any &quot;God,&quot; but for 35 years I lived under the shadow
of the great meditation masters and was fairly certain that we all
possessed souls that would survive our physical death.  [see photo of
J. Krishnamurti  * This essay was written in 2004]

Unlike Hindus, most Buddhists believe in some mysterious and
poorly defined soulless form of personal karma which survives death.
I never believed in the Buddhist concept of immortal personal karma
without soul, because when you reject the idea of a soul you lose the
only credible vehicle for the transference of karma from one lifetime
to the next.  To my mind, if there is no soul then there is no
possibility of immortal personal karma and reincarnation.

When I met Acharya Rajneesh in 1970, he not only spoke of souls
and reincarnation, but also claimed to have the power of astral
projection.  I believed his claim because of what I thought were
authentic experiences I had with this &quot;master&quot; astrally projecting
himself, not just into my room, but into my body while he was
physically several miles away.  After reading Matthew Alper's book,
The &quot;God&quot; Part of the Brain, I wonder if those amazing experiences
were really what I thought they were.  Alper summarizes the latest
scientific research into how the human brain functions while having
religious experiences.  In this essay I have added additional
neurological data obtained from medical journals, and my own
observations and theories regarding several of the main points of
Alper's book.

Medical research has shown that if you stimulate certain areas of
the brain with a small electric current, you can give people the
experience of spiritual visitation.  You may feel that Jesus is
touching your heart, or that the soul of a dead relative is near you.
There is no evidence to support a belief in authentic soul travel,
however, as all studies indicate that consciousness only exists in the
brain cells which create it.  You cannot remove consciousness from the
physical body because consciousness is a physical phenomena created by
chemistry, just as a firefly's light is created by chemical
reactions.  That is why you can turn consciousness on or off by
injecting a person with drugs to wake them up or to put them to
sleep.  [see Scientists test out-of-body experiences]

Near death experiences and even certain drugs, such as ketamine
and sodium pentothal, can give you the feeling of being outside of
your body, but researchers say that is just an illusion of the
holographic nature of the human brain.  When neural communications
between the body and brain are reduced, the brain is free to project
your sense of self anywhere it chooses, and this can happen while
under partial anesthesia, while partially asleep, or even during the
preliminary (and reversible) stages of death.  Prolonged fasting and
isolation can also produce hallucinations and distortions of reality,
and such ascetic practices are a major source of the Asian myths of
astral projection.

While true astral projection may be impossible, there is credible
scientific evidence to suggest that telepathic communication is
possible between human beings.  The human brain is an organic
electrochemical computer so complex that no existing silicon based
supercomputer can approach its capabilities. [see Mouse brain
simulated on computer ]  Think of all the things your relatively
simple cell phone can do.  There is plenty of computer power in the
human brain to imagine that some portion of its circuitry could be
allocated to broadcasting and receiving messages, or at least sensing
basic electromagnetic radiation from other human brains.  Such an
ability would have obvious survival value for the species, and thus
would be understandable in terms of evolution and survival of the
fittest.  A rudimentary telepathic communicative ability may be the
reason disciples feel the presence of their spiritual teachers so
strongly.  [see scans prove meditation alters the brain]

The brain is the most metabolically active human organ, and
requires a steady supply of oxygen and glucose as fuel.  Although the
brain represents less than 2% of the body's mass, it utilizes 20% of
the body's oxygen consumption and 15% of its cardiac output.  Thus,
the brain produces an extraordinary amount of energy in relationship
to the rest of the body.  The entire human body uses chemical
reactions to produce both mechanical movements and electrical currents
that flow through all of our living cells.  The brain acts as both an
analog and a digital computer, and the DNA code which creates it is
digital.  The average human brain contains approximately 100 billion
neurons connected by approximately 50 trillion synapses.  It is
therefore not difficult to imagine that this fantastically complex
organic electrochemical device could have mysterious abilities beyond
our current  level of understanding.

Perhaps what I thought was astral projection was simply Rajneesh
concentrating on me, sending me his supermental energy long distance.
That powerful jolt of energy may have caused my brain to supply the
added illusion of personal visitation on top of the strong telepathic
transmission.  There is no doubt that Rajneesh had tremendous mental
powers, but was that power really supernatural or just a product of
his own unique brain structure and meditative skill?

If you inject any human being with enough sedative, enlightened
or not, they will become unconsciousness.  If you damage certain areas
of the brain you can drastically alter human behavior.  You can turn a
conservative bank president into a garbage eating bum just by killing
off some of the brain cells that contain the biocomputer program for
his personality.  If you damage other areas of the brain, you can
erase all memory.

If consciousness, personality, and memory are all physical
phenomena of brain cells, then when your brain dies there is nothing
left of your individual identity.  Your permanent identity of time-
energy-space (see The TES Hypothesis) continues unharmed, but there is
no soul, no reincarnation, and no Buddhist transference of personal
karma.  If this is true, it means that all of the major world
religions are wrong.  It also means that we all achieve
&quot;moksha&quot; (liberation) at the time of our death because there is no
personal cycle of birth and death to escape from, and no magical
afterlife.  You are born once and you die once, and you will never
come back.

One theory states that we have souls and/or personal karma which
transmigrates from one life to the next, and another theory states
that nothing survives death and only DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and
the will of the living determines the future of our species.  Which
theory is correct?   I once believed in reincarnation with a high
level of certainty.  After many years of seeing the rampant corruption
of gurus, &quot;enlightened&quot; or not, the idiocy of disciples, cults, and
organized religion, and with the new scientific evidence in hand, I
find the soul-reincarnation-karma theory far less plausible.

You do not have to believe in anything supernatural to believe in
cosmic consciousness (satori).  Anyone can take the drug psilocybin
and get a dramatic imitation of the natural religious experience.
Clinical research shows that our brains are built to have religious
experiences.  As time-energy-space is one singular phenomena, it is
only natural that we occasionally experience the grand cosmic unity.
I personally suspect that even animals have satoris, though they
apparently have no ability to give it a name or understand its
implications.

One of the most interesting concepts of Matthew Alper's book
concerns the rise of self-consciousness in human animals and how
knowledge of our impending death has affected our brains and even our
DNA code.  If you put a dog in front of a mirror, he will never figure
out that he is looking at his own reflection.  If you put a higher
primate in front of a mirror, such as a chimpanzee or human child, the
higher primate will eventually use the mirror for grooming purposes
because he recognizes himself in the reflection.  Man's self-
consciousness is so highly developed that humans have come to realize
that our life expectancy is short and that our personal demise is
inevitable.

Other animals fear death, danger, and pain, but they have no real
understanding of time and the inevitability of their own destruction.
The time-death equation that adult human animals understand becomes a
constant source of anguish.  A strong survival instinct is built into
our DNA code from our long evolutionary journey from bacteria to man.
When the survival instinct collides with the self-conscious knowledge
of our impending death, the human brain needs both a psychological and
a neurological barrier to block the conflict and tension.  That
barrier we call religious belief and &quot;the God part of the brain.&quot;  The
theory states that man has invented myths of God, soul, reincarnation,
karma, and afterlife as a way to provide the brain with mental opium,
a buffer to the constant ticking clock inside our heads that tells us
that our inevitable doom is getting closer every day.

The psychological need for a feeling of immortality is so great
that our religious tendencies have become

&gt; transmission.  There is no doubt that Rajneesh had tremendous mental
&gt; powers, but was that power really supernatural or just a product of
&gt; his own unique brain structure and meditative skill?

&gt;      If you inject any human being with enough sedative, enlightened
&gt; or not, they will become unconsciousness.  If you damage certain areas
&gt; of the brain you can drastically alter human behavior.  You can turn a
&gt; conservative bank president into a garbage eating bum just by killing
&gt; off some of the brain cells that contain the biocomputer program for
&gt; his personality.  If you damage other areas of the brain, you can
&gt; erase all memory.

&gt;      If consciousness, personality, and memory are all physical
&gt; phenomena of brain cells, then when your brain dies there is nothing
&gt; left of your individual identity.  Your permanent identity of time-
&gt; energy-space (see The TES Hypothesis) continues unharmed, but there is
&gt; no soul, no reincarnation, and no Buddhist transference of personal
&gt; karma.  If this is true, it means that all of the major world
&gt; religions are wrong.  It also means that we all achieve
&gt; &quot;moksha&quot; (liberation) at the time of our death because there is no
&gt; personal cycle of birth and death to escape from, and no magical
&gt; afterlife.  You are born once and you die once, and you will never
&gt; come back.

&gt;      One theory states that we have souls and/or personal karma which
&gt; transmigrates from one life to the next, and another theory states
&gt; that nothing survives death and only DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and
&gt; the will of the living determines the future of our species.  Which
&gt; theory is correct?   I once believed in reincarnation with a high
&gt; level of certainty.  After many years of seeing the rampant corruption
&gt; of gurus, &quot;enlightened&quot; or not, the idiocy of disciples, cults, and
&gt; organized religion, and with the new scientific evidence in hand, I
&gt; find the soul-reincarnation-karma theory far less plausible.

&gt;      You do not have to believe in anything supernatural to believe in
&gt; cosmic consciousness (satori).  Anyone can take the drug psilocybin
&gt; and get a dramatic imitation of the natural religious experience.
&gt; Clinical research shows that our brains are built to have religious
&gt; experiences.  As time-energy-space is one singular phenomena, it is
&gt; only natural that we occasionally experience the grand cosmic unity.
&gt; I personally suspect that even animals have satoris, though they
&gt; apparently have no ability to give it a name or understand its
&gt; implications.

&gt;      One of the most interesting concepts of Matthew Alper's book
&gt; concerns the rise of self-consciousness in human animals and how
&gt; knowledge of our impending death has affected our brains and even our
&gt; DNA code.  If you put a dog in front of a mirror, he will never figure
&gt; out that he is looking at his own reflection.  If you put a higher
&gt; primate in front of a mirror, such as a chimpanzee or human child, the
&gt; higher primate will eventually use the mirror for grooming purposes
&gt; because he recognizes himself in the reflection.  Man's self-
&gt; consciousness is so highly developed that humans have come to realize
&gt; that our life expectancy is short and that our personal demise is
&gt; inevitable.

&gt;      Other animals fear death, danger, and pain, but they have no real
&gt; understanding of time and the inevitability of their own destruction.
&gt; The time-death equation that adult human animals understand becomes a
&gt; constant source of anguish.  A strong survival instinct is built into
&gt; our DNA code from our long evolutionary journey from bacteria to man.
&gt; When the survival instinct collides with the self-conscious knowledge
&gt; of our impending death, the human brain needs both a psychological and
&gt; a neurological barrier to block the conflict and tension.  That
&gt; barrier we call religious belief and &quot;the God part of the brain.&quot;  The
&gt; theory

Not really.  If telepathy does exist, it's not going to be electromagnetic
in nature: the signals from the brain are too complex, and far, far too
weak to serve as the medium for telepathy.

Even if it could be shown that there were the equivalent of systems to
encode the ultra-complex signals in the brain, into something
which _could_ be transmitted sensibly, an equivalent system to _decode_
those signals would have to have evolved in parallel; which doesn't seem
likely.

And, of course, the signals are way too weak to be detected beyond the
skull without some serious amplification.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Such an
&gt; ability would have obvious survival value for the species, and thus

&gt; strongly.  [see scans prove meditation alters the brain]

I rather suspect that it has more to do with their belief in the spiritual
qualities of their teachers, than any objective phenomenon.

&gt;      The brain is the most metabolically active human organ, and

&gt; the brain produces an extraordinary amount of energy in relationship
&gt; to the rest of the body.  The entire human body uses chemical
&gt; reactions to produce both mechanical movements and electrical currents
&gt; that flow through all of our living cells.  The brain acts as both an
&gt; analog and a digital computer, and the DNA code which creates it is
&gt; digital.  The average human brain contains approximately 100 billion

I can tell from your post that you have never sat eye to eye with an
enlightened person.  There is nothing &quot;weak&quot; about the signals coming
from their brains. They knock you over with their energy.   It's an
experience you would have to have first hand to believe.

The whole point is that enlightened people have more powerful brains,
and those who meditate also have more energy in their brains for
telepathy to work.  You do not even have to be enlightened to send and
receive simple messages through telepathy.  It's no good for complex
messages, but simple messages of greeting, danger, or a calling to
meet can be achieved through telepathy.

You are making so many assumptions here that it's hard to know where to
start picking them apart.

Why do you assume that your experience is objectively real (and not, for
example, in part due to your belief that these people are spiritually

Why do you assume that it's mediated by some part of the e-m

&gt; I don't think their brainwaves are any stronger or weaker than anyone
&gt; else's.  If we exist in a medium which we're all connected to, then
&gt; telepathy depends only on your ability to pull out of the noise that which
&gt; you want.  It's been suggested that each of us has our own &quot;frequency,&quot; so
&gt; to speak, and that by thinking of the person we want to communicate with,
&gt; we tune in to that person, and that person tunes in to us.  You've surely
&gt; heard of those people who suddenly wake up in the middle of the night,
&gt; sitting bolt upright in bed and they know something horrible has happened,
&gt; and sometimes they know who it's happened to.  Possibly the last thought a
&gt; person might have had before they were killed in a car crash was an inner
&gt; cry for the person who suddenly woke up in the middle of the night.  Of
&gt; course, the person is now dead so there's no way to know, which is the main
&gt; problem with many topics like this.

&gt; Unfortunately the skeptics and mainstream scientists like to haugtily
&gt; posture themselves as far FAR more intelligent than those who believe
&gt; things that the scientists claim haven't been scientifically proven.
&gt; Sometimes convincing research has been done, but the skeptics refuse to
&gt; even look at it.

&gt; Some people like to look up to Michael Shermer as their god of skepticism,
&gt; and he knows it.  But he has a vested interest in being skeptical.  He's
&gt; the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine, and the Executive Director of
&gt; the Skeptics Society.  If he allows himself to be convinced of something he
&gt; was skeptical of in the past, the people who think it's fun to be skeptical
&gt; may no longer look up to him, and some may not subscribe to his magazine
&gt; anymore. Plus that's one less topic he'll be able to write about in his
&gt; magazine, and people might wonder what else might be true that he was once
&gt; skeptical about.

&gt; One of these days when I have time, I need to make a list of things that
&gt; spiritualists have believed in for ages which scientists are now finding to
&gt; be possible, or even true.  I find it interesting that scientists can
&gt; explain how birds know which way north is, how bees can find their hives,
&gt; how ants communicate with each other, and it's all factual.  Yet we humans,
&gt; who are supposedly more complex than these other species of animals, are
&gt; portrayed as chunks of meat totally separated from their environment.  No
&gt; communications over vast distances, no inner compass, no intuitive
&gt; generalizations about how the universe may work.

&gt; &gt; The whole point is that enlightened people have more powerful brains,
&gt; &gt; and those who meditate also have more energy in their brains for
&gt; &gt; telepathy to work.  You do not even have to be enlightened to send and
&gt; &gt; receive simple messages through telepathy.  It's no good for complex
&gt; &gt; messages, but simple messages of greeting, danger, or a calling to
&gt; &gt; meet can be achieved through telepathy.

&gt; I think there's more than that, but I think words are crude for telepathy.
&gt; Telepathy is suited best for communicating things that can't precisely be
&gt; put into words: feelings.  I think people use their telepathic abilities
&gt; without even realizing it in the form of empathy.  I think sometimes people
&gt; experience the feelings of others and confuse them with their own feelings.
&gt; Kind of like crying at a funeral.  I was at a funeral once and, being a
&gt; rather unemotional type, and having a different outlook on death than some
&gt; people have, and not even having seen for a long time the man who had died,
&gt; I found myself feeling the tears come, even though I had no inner thoughts
&gt; of what the world was going to be like without the deceased in it.  I
&gt; believe contagious laughter may also be a telepathic or psychic event.

not every student feels like that. same prana can have different effect on
different people. some people feel fear, some nausea, some bliss, some
confusion, sleep etc. the guru is giving you a good &quot;psychic shaking&quot;. how
the box rattles and quietens down depends on what was in the box.

in general, the more subtle the experience, the better.

not all gurus are equal. your mileage may (and will) vary. the guru is a
guide and you still have to carry on the journey yourself. he has given you
a small taste of the &quot;state&quot; to get you interested. the prana will also
remain with you forever and be your guide.

do not conflate guru with god. the word Guru is used with different
connotations, and it can be difficult even for indians to be sure which
context to apply. it can mean the human guru, who is a practioner advanced
on the path, or it can mean the teacher aspect of the supreme spirit - the
aspect which always acts for your benefit and advnacement.

a very angry guy can make you upset just by his presence. sensitive people
can notice these things. he has, in an involuntary way, given you his
(angry) prana patterns.

Shaktipat is voluntary transfer of clear prana with a beneficial intention.
