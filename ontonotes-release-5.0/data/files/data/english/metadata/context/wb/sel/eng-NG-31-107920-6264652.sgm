Bernie Ecclestone has confirmed that Imola will not feature on the Formula
One calendar of 2007.

After the traditional San Marino Grand Prix was still missing from the
latest provisional calendar, the F1 supremo told an Italian newspaper on
Thursday that Imola's 'Enzo e Dino Ferrari' circuit would indeed not host a
race next year.

The venue was reportedly in doubt due to delayed circuit renovations, but
also a rumoured increase in Ecclestone's annual fees.

"I'm sorry, but we have lost Imola," 75-year-old Ecclestone was quoted as
saying by the Corriere della Sera daily.

The Italian newswire Ansa added that Imola mayor Massimo Marcignoli has just
returned from meetings with Ecclestone in London with a personal letter
confirming the non-renewal of the Imola contract.

But Ansa also asserted that Imola could return in 2008 with a different
organiser, following the expiry of the 'Sagis' deal, and if new paddock and
pit facilities have been erected.

Yet they will still go to Brazil..?
