A man goes into an Irish Pub in New York on St. Patrick's
Day, orders three pitchers of beer and spends the next few
hoursdrinking the beer.

A year later, again on St. Patrick's day he does the same.

The next year, the owner of the pub gets curious and asks
why he always orders three pitchers of beer on St. Patrick's
Day.

The guy replies that he has two brothers in Ireland and to
honor them and St. Patrick he orders one pitcher for himself
and one for each of his brothers.

This goes on for a couple of more years and finally the guy
comes in and orders only two pitchers of beer.  The pub owner
is concerned, thinking that something must have happened to
one of the brothers.  He goes over to the guy and as gently
as he can inquires if something happened to one of the guy's
brothers.

"Oh no" he replied, "I ordered two pitchers of beer because
my doctor told me I had to stop drinking."

... St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland.
... They're now in the U.S. Congress.
