That would be great, not only will people find out that you are not only a
racist but a hypocrite as well.  Maybe you could gather up all of the Made
in China products and have a nice burning or how about getting some
concentration camps together and we will really show them who we are.  This
is the United States of America and I am proud of that fact, but I do not
segregate another race for any cause.  Made in China products are not the
problem here.  Let me also give you a little history lesson also, it is your
type of mentality that was used against the Jews not so long ago.  These are
the kind of things that happen when someone else blames another race or
group of people for a problem.  Please take your hateful thoughts and
business somewhere else.  And please stop responding to my emails via a Made
in China computer, find another brand of computer and send your message.
You could send me a letter in the mail, but please check the envelope may
also be made in China.  The problem with your sort of mentality you do not
want to look at the real issues.

I remember the time someone told Imus that the Imus Coffee mugs were labeled
as made in China and he pulled them on the spot.

What most concerns me here is being labeled a racist for wanting to know
where a product is made like it's not even my right to inquire.

We should all inquire, then say no thanks.  Your local harley dealer has
lots of clothes made in the usa.

Intensive manufacturing origin of most products would include several
countries. For example a shirt could contain polyester from the US,
cotton from Egypt with fabric woven in Korea, dyed in Japan and made
into shirt in China.

Last &quot;American&quot; car I owned was a Ford, assembled in Mexico with parts
from who knows where.  It was a POS.

I'm watching a little of the Lou Dobbs show right now.  He has a
segment on apple juice.  Most of the apple juice sold in the US comes
from ....... China.  The apple pickers there don't make much.  China
made a point of targeting ag exports.
There is one company that sells apple juice made exclusively from US
grown apples. There was some mention of country of origin labeling.
The USDA has raised concerns about the conditions the apples are
grown under but that won't stop imports.
Maybe the best we can do is choose stuff that is made in countries
that don't pose the potential threat that China does.  I was at a farm
supply store looking at jackets.  Some of them were made in Bangladesh.
I had a Mazda car before my current one.  It was made in Flat Rock,
Michigan.
Did you complain to the boss of the dummy who sent you that email?
Some toy companies are having recalls due to lead levels in the Chinese
made stuff.
