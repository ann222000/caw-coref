My fellow racists (Whites only),
A new report from a.p.n.w.'s Committee
On Scumbags Who Make A Living Out Of Lying
Into Microphones finds 'pawmarks' leading
from the outrages committed by a letter
bomber to the neverending succession of reports
pumped out by &quot;mainstream&quot; media inciting
hostility towards a 'surveillance society'.
More details here:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7016053.stm

Vulnerable People are impressionable people so
irresponsibility lies with the same clique of librul nasties
orchestrating virulent 'anti' racist propaganda which
culminated in the murder of Pym Fortuyn in 1992.
Clearly, Something Must Be Done.

Apart from your racist, hate-filled drivel, I cant work out whether
you are trying to elicit sympathy for this fellow-moron of yours.

He was sending bombs to felow victims. Sounds like a very BNP thing to
do......

Hey don't shy about a trivial error like that. Your use of the word
'aryan' to describe yourself is much more interesting: it's origins are
Sanskrit, meaning noble or spiritual (an apt description for you I am sure).

So your moniker comes from highly developed civilisation from the areas
we know as northern India, Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan. Oh and it
dates from a time when our honky ancestors were still painting
themselves in wode and thought that fire and bronze axes were high-tech.
Quite ironic really.

Mind you there is a plus side to your multicultural roots: maybe David
Cameron will invite you and all your hate-filled xenophobic pals into
the Tory party now that he's pretending to be all touchy-feely and
inclusive.

Sanskrit is just one, probably the purest, of the IndoEuropean languages
of which English is also a member. The origins of the language probably
lie around the Caspian Sea.

Quite. However I don't think you would have needed to use your
phenomenal psychic powers of remote viewing (website on your signature)
to work out that I was not attempting to engage the xenophobic OP in a
rigorous debate about his nom de plume.

Thank Fuck he wasn't a Nu lavatory supporter then.

No need to apologise.
The Peace and Love veneer is a REAL
strain isn't it.
No wonder you people get so grumpy!
And murderous.
By way of light relief, here's Sir Andrew
Mard, Guardian-BBC community leader:

&quot;...the final answer [to the 'problem' of racism], frankly, is the
vigorous use of state power to coerce and repress. It may be my
Presbyterian background, but I firmly believe that repression can
be a great, civilising instrument for good. Stamp hard on certain
'natural' beliefs for long enough and you can almost kill them off.
The police are first in line to be burdened further, but a new Race
Relations Act will impose the will of the state on millions of other
lives too.&quot;

And then you woke up... You do have a vivid imagination - ever
considered writing children's books?

Keep wearing the tinfoil hat and watch out for the black helicopters.

Ian

P.S. As an aryan I was hoping you might tell me a bit more about your
culture and history: I think Kashmir in particular is a fascinating part
of the world, is that where you're from?

Remember Carl, this the Daily Wail school of 'journalism':
(i) Make up an outrageous headline;
(ii) look through all the vaguely related stories available;
(iii) select the one story that at least in some minor way backs the
headline;
(iv) remove all of the inconvenient information from the story that
gives the lie to your headline;
(v) add/inflate a few details for that elusive 'hysteria' factor;
(vi) publish and be damned.

Unfortunately the OP in this case doesn't even reach the appallingly low
levels of veracity and coherence of Daily Wail right-wing
hysteria/'journalism'.
