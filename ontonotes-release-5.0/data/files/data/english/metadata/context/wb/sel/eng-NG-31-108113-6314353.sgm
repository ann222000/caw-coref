Jerry!

You helped me with my pal Dundee about a year ago regarding
submissive peeing.  Just wanted to let you know he's doing
great- he was "cured" in about 2 days using your techniques!
He has since become the "smartest dog in the world"!  Once I
stopped thinking like a human and got inside his head, I can
teach him ANYTHING, usually in a matter of minutes.  Makes me
look like an expert dog-trainer.

I rescued two strays last week, cleaned 'em up, wormed 'em,
and am getting them their shots. Time to get inside their
heads and teach them to teach themselves how to be good dogs!
Instead of feeling like "training" is a chore, I look forward
to working with these guys a couple times a day...

Although I don't follow your instructions "to a T",
I learned from you to "think like a dog" and stimulate
their brain rather than beating ass or pinching, or any
of that nonsense.  I know damn well I would NOT be loyal
to someone who beat MY ass lol!

Well, just wanted to thank you for rattling the bushes out
there and teaching folks the RIGHT way to "train" dogs.  A
horseman friend of mine uses very similar techniques in
training his horses- he calls it "natural horsemanship".  He
is hated by nearly all the local "trainers" yet somehow he
repeatedly wins at every show he attends. He rarely shows any
more, but goes now and then to rub their noses in it (pun
intended)...  Too cool....

Have a great holiday season and keep up the good work!

can, before praising.

Perhaps you can tutor me regarding

&gt; &gt; Not to mention, the manual has a lot regarding how dogs

&gt;  Dear Lisa,
&gt;  How would you know if Jerry's analysis
&gt;  of &quot;how dog's think&quot;  is correct?
&gt;  That is, if thinking is some invisible process inside of a
&gt;  dog's head how would we know if Jerry or anyone is correct?
">

Of course, it isn't necessary at all to know how dogs think,
or even if they *do* think.  I believe that they do, but of
course I can't prove it, and neither can Jerry.

The heart of the matter is, the discussion in the manual
regarding "how dogs think" is part of a wholistic approach to
dog training.

It helps to comprehend the reasoning behind the
methodology.  The methodology works quickly
and easily, therefore lending credence (as far as
I'm concerned) to his theory of how dogs think.

It's the same sort of thing regarding theories of whether the
earth revolves around the sun, or contrariwise.  Is it possible
to send a rocket to the moon, based on the assumption
that the sun revolves around the earth?

The answer is, of course, yes, though it would most likely
be enormously complicated.  The better solution is to begin
with the theory that the earth revolves arou­nd the sun.

In other words, the simplest answer or description is the
best, even though it may not be empirically provable.

And so, I am willing to take Jerry's theory on how dogs
think as a likely one, simply because the dog training
methodology he describes (based on his suppositions)
works so well.

I hope this helps you to understand from which perspective
I say the things that I do about Jerry's method and manual.

regards,
Lisa

&gt; The second and third times, she was even
&gt; MORE eager when she saw the leash, and
&gt; I got the same look when I turned around
&gt; to  go back in. The fourth time, she just
&gt; bounced a bit as she walked to the door
&gt; with me, and sat nicely to wait until I hooked
&gt; up the leash, and this last time, I HAD
&gt; TO CALL  HER TO ME!!!!!!!!!!
">

Fine. That's because dogs learn on the basis of
four repetitions. That's not to say they can't learn
some things faster, but for breaking habits, it
usually happens the fourth time we repeat a lesson.

Then we need to repeat the lesson at three more
locations our time in each to generalize the idea.
Let's say your dog gets excited when you take her
lead and go to the front door. She would probably
do the same at the back door, but to not such a degree.

Likewise for any other door.

It would behoove you to repeat the exercise with
several other doors and it would be easiest to
start with a door that had less excitement involved
with it.

&gt; If I knew it would be that easy, I would have

Yes, those habits are hard to break. It's easier for
me to train a person who has no experience at all
because they have no bad habits of pulling and

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; a fight.
">

You know that working the dog in the back
yard is not preferable, because that causes
them some anxiety because it's their free area.
But with your dog and with the difficulty he is
to handle, I don't see any reason you shouldn't
do the Family Leadership Exercise and the come
command several times out there, and then you'll
have the control to do it in a more neutral area.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The upside is, when I take the leash off it's
&gt; hook and don't take the pinch collar, her
&gt; excitement to go for a walk is NO LONGER
&gt; combined with the intense fear I used to see
&gt; in her eyes at the sight of the pinch!
">

Our group likes to think that is EXCITEMENT and
eagerness to work. It is sheer terror. The pinch
collar works by overriding the opposition reflex
through fear and that cause tremendous stress
and anxiety that must be released through anxiety
relief mechanisms like barking, digging, whining,
chewing, self mutilation and aggression.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I was thinking about your difficulties with
your dog. Just getting the Hot And Cold
Exercise and the Family Leadership Exercise
and the come command installed will solve
most of your difficulty with him.

I presume you've got msn messenger. We
can speak over that if you are set up for it,
and I can demonstrate the timing and tone
and tempo for using sound distractions
and praise, or we could speak on the phone.

The most important thing to remember is to
pick up and handle the lead in a relaxed manner,
no white knuckles, keep your elbow relaxed and
your arm down at your side with the length of the
lead breaking just below the knee.

Let me know if you need further help.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hello James,
&gt;&gt; &gt; I have used his recommended techniques and
&gt;&gt; &gt; ideas with great success, and over the period
&gt;&gt; &gt; I've used these methods the more I've become
&gt;&gt; &gt; to understand and appreciate how his methods
&gt;&gt; &gt; work and how effective they can be if carried out
&gt;&gt; &gt; correctly.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; His manual isn't conventional and as such gets
&gt;&gt; &gt; critisized and misunderstood. The basic concept
&gt;&gt; &gt; is to allow the dog to choose whatever behaviour
&gt;&gt; &gt; it wants for any situation but to distract (and
&gt;&gt; &gt; immediately praise ) it from behaviours we deem
&gt;&gt; &gt; undesirable, because of the correctly timed
&gt;&gt; &gt; distractions repeated usually about 4 times (in
&gt;&gt; &gt; each location) the dog decides of it own accord
&gt;&gt; &gt; that this behaviour is undesriable and therefore
&gt;&gt; &gt; pursues something else, if that behaviour is also
&gt;&gt; &gt; inappropriate to us then we carry on distracting,
&gt;&gt; &gt; very soon the dog finds a behaviour that is mutually
&gt;&gt; &gt; acceptable. The benefits of this type of approach
&gt;&gt; &gt; are numerous, firstly we aren't challenging the dog
&gt;&gt; &gt; so there is no conflict so the dog does't develop any
&gt;&gt; &gt; possible negativity to us, the dog decides of it own
&gt;&gt; &gt; free will that a behaviour is unsatisfying so chooses
&gt;&gt; &gt; to cease it (in other words even if we are gone the
&gt;&gt; &gt; dog won't have any desire to pursue that behaviour
&gt;&gt; &gt; i.e. bin raiding etc).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I would recommend his manual.

Hello Marshall,

The way I view it from my observation of how
my dogs react is that the distraction interrupts
the dogs thought, not for good or bad, just
interrupts, the dog is therefore distracted for
a second and then will either continue the
behaviour or do something else.

The praise reassures the dog that the sound
distraction is not a threat or punishment,
however if everytime the dog resumes a
particular behaviour it's distracted immediately
(and praised immediately for reassurance) then
it quickly decides this behaviour is not fulfilling
and it ceases.

A dog will offer another behaviour in it's place
and if that is acceptable to us then we let it be
otherwise the distraction continues until a suitable
alternate behaviour is offered.

One example, Sam used to jump up on me
when I arrived home, I would shake can to
distract him right at the moment he was
about to jump up, after about 4 repetitions
he tried sitting and offering me his paw, of
course this was fine so I let it be.

While the concept of shake cans is not new,
I haven't read any other advice that says to
praise immediately regardless of what the
dog does next (the common advice is to
praise once the dog is doing a desired
behaviour or at least stopped the unwanted
behaviour), this is unique to Jerry (and Marilyn)
and from my own experiences is an important
part of the process.

Tracy,

What worked for me, in just one storm,
was to praise the dog after each clap
of thunder, telling him he's a Good Dog!
This is an almost 13 year old Doberman, BTW.
The next time it thundered, he did not even react at
all--you could not tell it was the same dog as before.

There was more thunder just the other day, and same
thing, nada, nothing, zilch, no cowering, whimpering,
trying to hide at all, it was that simple.

I got this idea from Jerry Howe, who might seem
to be a "wild and crazy" character, but his non-
abusive way of handling dogs WORKS.
Wonderfully.

Praise
.
It's that simple.

Hi Jerry,

When I talked to you on the phone to order to machine
for daughter's new pup, I told you that I had an older
Chessie. I rescued him at 9 years old and have had him
for 3 years.

It's funny, but I thought I'd try some of your book training
with him.

Where I used to say "come" and then say "good boy"
when he obeyed, I have reversed it with a "good boy" first.
It really does work. He was very confused at first,
wondering what he had done to get the praise.
But it really gets the attention and distracts him from
whatever he may have going through his brain when
he hears it.

Dogs are funny, but people are too. Can't wait to get

Hi !
Our black lab girl is 3 months old (she will be 4 months
on the 30th).

When we first brought her home she had a bad habit
of trying to nip our faces (including my 3 year old twins)
during playtime.  It drove everyone in the house nuts
and it brought my little girls to tears as you can imagine.

We tried saying no, and that would just get her even
more excited, so we would yell no and that would just
get her "scared" but still excited.  In short it just wasn't
working.

So we finally did what Jerry has suggested to you.
We used a sound do distract her and we would
immediately praise her.

I have to say that it worked great.  BUT she then
moved on to nipping at the feet LOL silly little thing.

So again, we tried no, and then louder no, but again
it didn't work so we went for the distraction and praise.
I must say that she is doing great!

I hope that helps.

Hello.

I never posted here (or anywhere) before.
I never trained or owned a dog before this
year.

I downloaded the Wit's End, read it, corresponded
with Mr. Howe and trained my dog to come and to
stop barking in a weekend.

Our dog, Jake, had been treated with kindness the
whole time we had him, about 10 months, but his
earlier life is unknown.

I worked on the hot-cold exercise for about 30
minutes when he suddenly "got it". After that
he came to me every time with no hesitation.

I used the cans filled with pennies to teach him
not to bark. If he now starts to bark, I go to the
door or window, say "Good Boy, its' alright" and
he usually calms down right away.

A couple of times I had to get the cans
out again to reinforce the behavior.

We feel a strong bond with this animal
and he is very eager to accept our love.

So with all the vitriolic spewing going on,
I have to believe Mr. Howe is right.

His method worked for us.

I don't know if it would have been quite
as effective if we had tried another method first.

"Chloe" (the one we adopted--a. k. a.

She responds even better than our other

We tried out the surrogate toy technique, and
not a thing was touched when we got back!

We were both surprised because Chloe isn't
that interested in toys and was still very uptight
about us reaching for the door... anyway, it
seemed to work.

We both work all day today so we'll see
how that goes... Regardless, we will be

I wouldn't recommend offering a physical

INDEEDY. That's the bottom line for successful

thinking and processing the information.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Jerry it is so hard not to yell at the dog when

bribe and avoid... IOW, we've HOWEtwitted the

It helped clear problems from my dogs in the
field using the can penny distraction technique.
Works  like a charm. My dogs get distracted easy
from their jobs ie, retrieving or training to find lost
people, oh did I mention that I am a Search and
Rescue Team Leader.

Sorry that slipped my mind.

I have read volumes of training books and don't
know where people get that Jerry copied others
work as I have NEVER come across his methods
before. I would like to see proof.

Just like Jerry outlined I eliminated problems one
at at time as they arose. I used to try and train to
the way I wanted them but this is backward, you
train out the problems leaving what you want left
over.

Funny part is the second dog who had the same
problems as the other didn't need correcting for
some of his habits after I cleared it from the first
dog. Seemed he learned through osmosis.

Nice side benefit there.

It nearly came to giving them up to a 3rd party
trainer as they were not performing well. The
VAST majority of working dog trainers are
agressive in their actions with the dogs.

I tried it and it didn't work and guess what?
I was at my "Whits End" then someone I
knew turned me onto Jerry and the rest is history.

I referred friends and families to Jerry's manual
and all have had great results. Starting puppies
out on the distraction technique is especially
good because they never develop the habit.

I had my sisters dog healing, sitting and down
stay reliably at 8-9 weeks.

The first night home following Jerrys advice
we ditched the crate and put the pup on the
floor beside the bed and after 2 whimpers
NOT A SOUND OUT OF THAT DOG FOR
6 HRS! first night, that has never happened
in all my days.

Sorry, the man understands dogs its that simple.
