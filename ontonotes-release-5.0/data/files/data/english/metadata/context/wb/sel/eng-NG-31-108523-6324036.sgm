Methane threatens to bake humanity like Turkeys in an Oven
Global Warming could accelerate out of control 20 times current trends
Compiled by Peter Mackenzie

A study co-authored by a Florida State University scientist and
published in the Sept. 7 issue of the journal Nature has found that as
the permafrost melts in North Siberia due to climate change, carbon
sequestered and buried there since the Pleistocene era is bubbling up
to the surface of Siberian thaw lakes and into the atmosphere as
methane, a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

In turn, that bubbling methane held captive as carbon under the
permafrost for more than 40,000 years is accelerating global warming
by heating the Earth even more --- exacerbating the entire cycle. The
ominous implications of the process grow as the permafrost decomposes
further and the resulting lakes continue to expand, according to FSU
oceanography Professor Jeff Chanton and study co-authors at the
University of Alaska-Fairbanks.

"This is not good for the quality of human life on Earth," Chanton
said.

The researchers devised a novel method of measuring ebullition
(bubbling) to more accurately quantify the methane emissions from two
Siberian thaw lakes and in so doing, revealed the world's northern
wetlands as a much larger source of methane release into the
atmosphere than previously believed. The magnitude of their findings
has increased estimates of such emissions by 10 to 63 percent.

Understanding the contribution of North Siberia thaw lakes to global
atmospheric methane is critical, explains the paper that appears in
this week's Nature, because the concentration of that potent
greenhouse is highest at that latitude, has risen sharply in recent
decades and exhibits a significant seasonal jump at those high
northern latitudes.

Chanton points to the thawing permafrost along the margins of the thaw
lakes -- which comprise 90 percent of the lakes in the Russian
permafrost zone -- as the primary source of methane released in the
region. During the yearlong study, he performed the isotopic analysis
and interpretation to determine the methane's age and origin and
assisted with measurements of the methane bubbles' composition to shed
light on the mode of gas transport.

"My fellow researchers and I estimate that an expansion of these thaw
lakes between 1974 and 2000, a period of regional warming, increased
methane emissions by 58 percent there," said Chanton. "Because the
methane now emitted in our study region dates to the Pleistocene age,
it's clear that the process, described by scientists as 'positive
feedback to global warming,' has led to the release of old carbon
stocks once stored in the permafrost."

In addition to Chanton, the John Widmer Winchester Professor of
Oceanography at FSU, co-authors of "Methane bubbling from Siberian
thaw lakes as a positive feedback to climate warming" include K. M.
Walter (Institute of Arctic Biology, University of Alaska-Fairbanks);
S. A. Zimov (Northeast Science Station, Cherskii, Russia); and D.
Verbyla (Forest Science department, University of Alaska-Fairbanks).

Methane clathrate, also called methane hydrate or methane ice, is a
form of water ice that contains a large amount of methane within its
crystal structure (a clathrate hydrate). Originally thought to occur
only in the outer regions of the solar system where temperatures are
low and water ice is common, extremely large deposits of methane
clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of
Earth.

Global Warming amplification?

One explanation of rapid climate change at the end of the last
glaciation, argues Dr. Euan Nisbet of the University of Sakatchewan,
is that it was initially driven by methane from natural gas fields and
gas hydrates during a period of extreme insolation.

Methane hydrates are solids which lock methane gas up under pressure
in an ice-like lattice of water molecules. They are present under the
oceans and permafrost in vast quantities. In the offshore Arctic, the
cold allows their formation at sufficiently shallow depths that
warming can reach them and destabilize them.

Nisbet is one of a number of geologists who fear methane hydrates as a
potentially major positive feedback. He wrote in a 1989 paper that
"any slight warming of the Arctic water will release hydrate from the
sea floor almost immediately. A temperature change of a few degrees
will liberate methane from the uppermost sea-floor sediments at this
depth within a few years." The worst- case analysis is grim indeed:
"the danger of a thermal runaway caused by methane release from
permafrost is minor, but real ...even if there is only a 1 per cent
chance that such events will occur, the social implications are
profound." (E. Nisbet, "Climate change and methane," Nature, v. 347,
p. 23, September 1990).

Fire in Ice: What Are Gas Hydrates?

In 1810, Sir Humphrey Davy discovered a new class of materials, known
as gas hydrates or clathrates. These ice-like structures form when
high pressure and low temperature trap light natural gases within
rigid cages of water molecules. The trapped gas can be methane (hence
"methane hydrate"), butane, propane, ethane or a number of other light
natural gases.

The hydrates containing hydrocarbons, such as methane, are truly "fire
in ice." If you light a methane hydrate deposit, it will burn like an
oil lantern wick.

Gas hydrates occur in permafrost regions as well as beneath and just
above the seafloor on the slopes flanking every continent, where the
pressure is high and the temperature is low. Both industry and the
academic community are studying the substances to better understand
their past, present and future roles for climate, energy and
development.

Some researchers speculate that blowouts of marine gas hydrates in the
geologic past may have released enough methane, a potent greenhouse
gas, to drive up global temperatures. Additionally, some researchers
hypothesize that when hydrates broke away from steep slopes on the
seafloor, they could have triggered massive seafloor avalanches and
even tsunamis. Other scientists are cynically investigating the
potential of gas hydrates, onshore and offshore, as a future energy
source.

Estimates show that oceanic gas hydrates currently hold somewhere
between 1,000 and 22,000 gigatons of carbon as methane, with most
studies suggesting about 10,000 gigatons. Considering that our
atmosphere contains about 700 gigatons of carbon, even the low mass
estimates make gas hydrate a major component of the global carbon
cycle.

This carbon pool, however, is sensitive to relatively small changes in
deep-ocean temperature and sea level. Thus, in the past, gas hydrates
may have destabilized, releasing methane into the atmosphere through
gas bubbles rising rapidly through the water column or gas hydrates
floating to the surface. Because methane is about 10 times more
powerful a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, its release could have
resulted in a potentially abrupt climate change.

Conceivably, we live in a world with an enormous amount of gas hydrate
and free gas that affects climate and global systems over time. Most
current models for global carbon cycling and climate change, however,
have continued to omit the large and dynamic seafloor methane cycle.
We may be sitting on the brink of a major shift in thinking about the
carbon cycle and climate change, one that would permeate throughout
the broad geoscience community.

Atmospheric CO2 Emissions Background context

Up to now it has been generally assumed that global warming will be a
linear process. However evidence from the geological past linked with
climate modelling that takes into account the global warming that is
already locked into the system indicates that there may not be a
linear response to rising CO2 levels. There is a danger that at some
point we will cross a threshhold when global warming accelerates. By
continuing to increase the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere we are
getting closer to that point.

From the analysis of the bubbles of air trapped in ice cores taken
from the Greenland icecap that are up to 500,000 years old it has been
shown that the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and the CO2
content has followed a regular 100,000 year cycle of change with the
CO2 content and temperature closely linked and following the same
graph line. Within this regular cycle there are some recently
discovered very short periods of approximately only a few hundred
years duration when temperatures rise dramatically by 8 degrees
centigrade above the slower rises of up to 7 degrees centigrade. This
gives a total range of 15 degrees centigrade from peak to trough.
These records show natural processes at work before the impact of
man's activities. We are currently in the lower temperature part of
the cycle.

During the period covered by the ice core research the CO2 content of
the atmosphere has varied between 170 and 280 ppm. (parts per
million). From 1850 to today with the added input from the burning of
fossil fuels the CO2 content has risen to 350 ppm. So we are now well
outside of the historic range of values and CO2 levels are going to
continue to rise for a long time yet and temperatures will follow.

Recent research has shown that the Amazon rain forest is not a stable
mature forest with growth and decay in balance but is in fact an
expanding forest that is being fertilised by the excess atmospheric
CO2. The trees are getting bigger and there is a net take up of 5000
kg of carbon per hectare per year ( 1 hectare = 100 x 100 metres ).
The total area of forest is 400 million hectares so the whole forest
could be absorbing 2 billion tons of carbon per year.

Research in the savanah lands to the east of the Amazon Basin has
established that the crucial factor determining the development of the
rain forest is the length of the dry season. The savanah to the east

Notice that the only time this alleged "20 times current trends" is

Nowhere else.

This is one of the reasons why we should adopt measures against global
warming OTHER than cutting back on CO2. What is proposed by the
world's politicians simply wont work. One reason is methane which we
can do little about. The other is that quite simply we will be unable
to control China and India.

The ONLY way to cut global warming which stands any chance of working
is a sunshield, either at L1 or in MEO. L1 will require less material
but MEO will give greater flexibility in that it can do fine climate
control. Also if we get a volcanic eruption we may find ourselves
needing MORE sunlight not less. MEO will provide this flexibility.

My own hobbyhorse the Von Neumann machine is well known. It is a
hobbyhorse of mine precisely because I feel that building one is a lot
easier than is supposed. Forget about Biology and DNA - All you need
is CAD/CAM and something that can assemble flatpacks.

Von Neumann machines are irrelevant since there is no
local raw material for them to use to create copies of
themselves or the flatpacks in situ. What you need is
a lifting system to get the flatpacks into orbit and
just a single assembly robot to connect them together.

I suggest you start by calculating the area needed,
and then mass of a structure with sufficient strength
to remain fairly rigid given the tidal forces at L1
and hence the mass. Given that we can barely afford
to repair the Hubble, the idea of lifting that amount
of mass to L1 is ludicrous.

The _logical_ solution is simple, reduce coal and oil
production by 5% per year and let market forces raise
the price to the point where renewable alternatives
like wind power for electricity and bio-fuels for
transport and chemical feedstock become viable. That
would give a huge boost to the agriculture industry
in many of the developing countries which would be
hardest hit by restrictions on fossil fuel and could
be backed by technology transfers to give them the
processing capabilities.

Fossil sources will run out eventually so it's a bullet
we will have to bite sooner or later. Of course, while
it is a logical solution, it is as feasible politically
as your sunshade is economically.

What about the Moon/asteroids. You dont need a big lift on the Moon
and on asteroids hardly any. In fact you could take off with ion drive

Hubble is the NASA establuishment. The whole principle of the VN
machine is once you have sent the seed you can replicate. The whole
idea is to build a self replicating entity. The NASA establishment
seems to believe in something like "Intelligent Design" (As does the
boss) Astraunauts seem to be enddowed with the kind of "vital force"
postualated by (some) 19th century chemists. My contention is that
anything an astranaut can do a machine can do - probably better.

As far as total amounts are concerned. This has in fact already been
discussed by other people (see sci.space.policy) 1/10 of the area of
the Earth's circumferance has been discussed. In the case of VN the
weight is largely irrelevant. A non VN Earth transportable solution
with mirrors weighing 55kg/km^2 has been proposed. Rigidity is not in
fact a probem. If you did want a rigid structure you would spin it.
The spped of rotation required would by of the order (minimum) of one
revolution per YEAR. Let's say one revolution every month to keep the
structure really taught. We would have a circumferance of some
12,000km. This works out at rather less than 20km/h. The tensile
stress is proportional only to velocity.

It is economic. Once a seed is developed it is fire and forget (not

Ion drive to lift from the Moon? Not even close. From
a small asteroid with microgravity perhaps but you then
still have to get it to L1. In fact what ou would do if
the manufacturing technology was available would be to
land a mass driver on the asteroid, push it to the right

We are nowhere close to that level of technology. The
rovers on Mars are the best. If there was an astronaut
there, he could blow the dust ou of the failed motors
and get them working again. The rovers can't even do
that and if they could it would still take a human
operator to control it remotely. A computer could
easily detect the motor had failed but wouldn't be
able to work out why or how to repair it and again we
are many years away from anything like that capability.

&gt;&gt;So, does methane pose a threat today? Let us review the situation. We
&gt;know there are extensive methane hydrate and permafrost deposits all
&gt;around the world. We have evidence that we are at the beginning of a
&gt;period of global warming that is probably being made worse by the
&gt;continuing build up of CO2 in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel
&gt;burning. Recent computer modelling incorporating the feed back effects
&gt;of global warming that has already occurred suggests that by about
&gt;2050 we may start to loose the beneficial effects of the Amazon rain
&gt;forest as a carbon sink. This could lead to temperature rises of 5 to
&gt;8 degrees centigrade by 2100. This would be uncharted territory and no
&gt;one really knows at present how the world's environmental systems
&gt;would change but we now have the evidence from the geological past. On
&gt;the basis of this evidence global warming can lead to methane releases
&gt;which once started would escalate. This would be the worst possible
&gt;thing to happen because once started there would be no way of stopping
&gt;a runaway methane global warming event. We CAN reduce our CO2
&gt;emissions from fossil fuels but we COULD NOT reduce methane emissions
&gt;once they started, huge natural forces would take over and change our
&gt;world. This would probably result in the melting of the Antarctic
&gt;icecap which would raise sea levels by 50 metres and would completely
&gt;change the climates of the world.

&gt;So what should we do? We should be careful and not risk starting the
&gt;sequence events described above. To do this we must reduce total CO2
&gt;emissions from now onwards and take measures to protect carbon sinks

Lift from an Asteroid. Of course you can't have ion drive from the

fact that would be easier in space than a solid mass. After
manufacture it could be used to concentrate sunlight and fuel the ion

How much is the ISS and NASAs infatuations costing? A far lower sum
would bring capabilities up. You are right though to focus on the low
level of achievment of NASA. In fact games distributors are doing
better than NASA. If we break the problem down into its logical
components we have at its bare bones a problem in dynamics. Now
dynamical systems are inherently predictable. They consists of
matrices and transfer functions. CAD/CAM systems already do good
simulations. Robots are now starting to be developed using Javalink. I
will again point to the basic infatuation and failure of NASA.
Progress is being made by CAD/CAM manufacturers, games (quite
surprisingly) Sonic the hedgehog stands a far better chance of
repairing Hubble than ever NASA has and of couse general manufacturing
industry.

As far as working out why a component had failed. This is quite
simple. How would we do it? Well we would probably take a circiut
diagram, put probes on the various points. We would check the
continuity of circuits in (for example) the coils before coming to the
conclusion that the armature had burned out. If we had a new part we
would then repair the motor. If we did not have the part a robot could
not repair it, but then neither could an astronaut. In fact the
example you give is a rather poor one because car firms like Ford
ALREADY have a plug into which you can place a probe and a computer
then dianoses the fault. It is in fact an integral part of an engine
management system. My car has its ABS controlled from EMS and
increasingly a variety of functions are going onto EMS. I could sttick
a probe in drive the car and proform an emergency stop while going
fast round a corner on a wet road. The system will tell me what is
happenning, and any faults with ABS. Expert systems are in fact used
in fault diagnosis including medicine - which is really just another
form of fault diagnosis and repar. The barrier is not the ability of
the system to diagnose it is patient acceptability and the fact that
diaglogue has to be done via NL (elastic station The season of spring
= La estacion de ressorte). In a car we do not use NL and a probe on
EMS is a lot simpler.

How far should Ford take it? It depends on whether they are paying
their mechanics $180 million a week

No it isn't! Point is that an asembly from pre prepared components can
be viewed as a dynamical task. The basic Pons Assinorum is the ability
to perform a dynamical task. Producing the robot itself (not from pre
prepared components) can be broken down into a series of dynamical
tasks. If our task is in CAD/CAM we have a desciption of it which a
robot can understand. If we can describe an astronaut's task on the
Moon (or better still an asteroid) and can break down all the
processes into simple steps which can be described dynamically we can
construct a Von Neumann swarm. We should really talk about a swarm not
a machine if we are speaking strictly. We can in fact construct a
definition of a VN swarm along the following lines. We have a number
of processes each with inputs and outputs. The inputs could be
assemblies like a flatpack or they could be sunlight and asteroid
rock. Outputs for some processes are inputs for other processes. We
take the sum of the ensemble. When the only inputs, which are not
matchable by outputs is sunlight and rock we will have achieved the
goal. In fact if we have processes floating around in a CAD/CAM system
we need an algorithm (possibly a GA) to get the fittest solution.
Those who are interested in the origin of life might care to ponder
how a similar sort of algorithm might have operated in ponds some 3.8
billion years ago.

Can we go the whole way in one go? I think that as a first stage
complex chips should be blasted from Earth in rockets.

I think we are talking slighly at cross purposes. There is the L1
solution which may or may not be rigid and there is the MEO solution
which is definitely NOT rigid. In fact MEO would work rather like the
quadrantal rule for aircraft in VFR. One orbital plane would consist
of rigid structures a few km across and at constant spacing and
different orbital planes would be at different heights (they need
differ by only 100m or so).

My rotation in a year was an estimate of the rough magnitude of tidal
forces on an L1  Now you can have a structure at 55Kg/km^2 in tension
quite easily, but you need a box girder type of structure for
compression. In fact you would have thin wires arranged in a fractal
like structure.

However I would like to point out a few things.

1) This approach has been advocated as an alternative to the VN
approach. With a VN appoach the weight is less important as you are
REPLICATING.

2) A rigid strucure is not really needed.

3) I think we have a little bit of confusion about 5km/h. It does not
matter how large a structure is. The important thing is the speed an
object attains in traversing it. If we build a brick wall 5m high at
10m/s^2 (10 = R&amp;R 9.81) we have 10m/s or 18km/h.

The return to the Moon is in fact proposing just that smelters. Ca you
build a smelter that is small? If you are talking about building a
sunshield  you can have small pieces (even down to a cm^2) and small
tools. If you are talking about high temperature processes there is a
minimum size required. For low temperature processes you cut the
sizeProbably the best answer within current technological capabilities
is to heat by directing sunlight onto the furnace.

As I have explained nanotechnology is suspect because we want to build
any CAD/CAM object which is compliant, but it is useful for certain
processes. Clearly the further we can minaturize the basic seed the
lower will be the launch cost. Of corse because of thermal
considerations a high temperature process has an intrinsic size.

I think it iss fair comment. There has been an incredible amount of

Thetre is perhaps a deeper reason here. Should we be spending large
amounts of public money in a free society? Shouldn't industry be
spending the money? I tend to feel that manned spaceflight with
current technology is basically a dead end. We need to improve
technological capability.

So what do you think killed off the mammoths at the end of the last ice age?
Methane eruptions asphyxiated them before they could escape - hence the good
condition of their bodies with full stomachs.

You would not want to be fishing near one of those lakes if it erupted (like
that crater in Nigeria that belched CO2 and killed hundreds of humans and
lots of livestock).

The radiative properties of CH4 are well known, its just the amount waiting
to be released that's a bit uncertain. You want to bet your descendants
lives on this?

"high". If the centre is in freefall, what is the gravity at

Lets reduce this to its basics. NASA in its heady days was proposing

What about all the extractive technology here on Earth. It is an

concede one point. If we could substitute LOW temperature processes

the Amazon" is of course a crude statement. It implies that we are

Human haemoglobin comprises four similar protein subunits, each

And JFTR the Greek word _haima_ means "blood"; "iron" is _sideros_. The

refers to granular iron-rich substances deposited in body tissues due to
certain metabolic abnormalities. A "siderite" is a meteorite containing
a large proportion of iron; "siderite" is also the geological name for
ferrous carbonate.

BTW some have connected the Greek _sideros_ with the Latin _sidus_,
"star", from which we get "sidereal", as an allusion to meteorites as an

&gt; Let me tell you a secret. 55kg/km is in fact not my figure. This topic
&gt; was discussed in sci.space.policy. Most oof the contributers had the
&gt; idea of transporting material from Earth using rockets. All the
&gt; material - not just chips and critical parts. If you say 55kg/km^2 is
&gt; unrealistic I am not going to argue with you - but it makes total

Agreed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you have a machine of
&gt; exponential growth then weight does not matter in the same way. You
&gt; will go for MEO.

The choice between MEO and L1 is probably not driven
primarily by mass. MEO has concerns with such a large
number of objects in orbit in regard to making the
system stable in the event of an individual plate
having a guidance fault. See the thread entitled
"Orbiting Junk, Once a Nuisance, Is Now a Threat"

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; They have achieved 5 gsm, compared to 80 gsm for typical
&gt;&gt; office paper. That is 5000 kg/km^2 (5 tonne/km^2) so
&gt;&gt; 55 kg/km^2 is two orders of magnitude less than credible.

&gt;&gt; Replication is not relevant, you are making thin panels
&gt;&gt; which have no capability to reproduce because that extra
&gt;&gt; function would increase the mass. Besides which, we do not
&gt;&gt; have self-replicating technology in any form, nor are we
&gt;&gt; going to have it in the timescales of the possible methane
&gt;&gt; problem.

&gt; It is not. A CAD/CAM based VN not only replicates it also makes
&gt; anything that is compliant.
">

We use CAD/CAM at work to make a variety of metalwork
and have used it on occassion for rapid prototyping
where any arbitrary shape can be made using UV setting
to produce a mould, but it's uses are very limited and
the technique is extremely expensive. You seem to have
a very odd idea of what it can do.

To produce vast numbers of thin plates either to
assemble into a single rigid shield at L1 or for a
Dyson swarm, you need a factory churning out those
plates, not more machines. Those factories would
need to be lifted from Earth because you have a
chicken-and-egg situation, there are no factories
in space capable of making factories, and there's
no sense using replication because the equipment
needed to manufacture all the parts of the factory
would be quite different from what is needed to
churn out the shield plates.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) I think we have a little bit of confusion about 5km/h. It does not
&gt;&gt; &gt; matter how large a structure is. The important thing is the speed an
&gt;&gt; &gt; object attains in traversing it. If we build a brick wall 5m high at
&gt;&gt; &gt; 10m/s^2 (10 = R&amp;R 9.81) we have 10m/s or 18km/h.

&gt;&gt; Yes, and if your shield passes the Earth edge on it is 600km
&gt;&gt; &quot;high&quot;. If the centre is in freefall, what is the gravity at
&gt;&gt; the top and bottom? What speed do you attain falling from the
&gt;&gt; centre to the bottom (the edge nearest the Earth)?

&gt; If you have the sunshield at L1 the answer id something like 5km/h. I
&gt; mentioned a year as being the critical time at L1. Forces there are
&gt; very small.

I agree, that's not what I was discussing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Getting there? The assembly would be folded.

Yes, or better sent as panels for assembly in situ. You
can set up the factory near Earth and send individual
panels which are added to the structure at L1 over some
time. What that means though is that you first locate an
asteroid of several million tonnes and bring it into
Earth orbit, then process it into panels and send them
either into individual Earth orbits or for assemble at L1.

What I was talking about some posts back was the tidal
problem if you made the entire assembly elsewhere and
tried to bring it into L1.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; More importantly, with an areal density of 5 tonne/km^2, what
&gt;&gt; is the tension at the centre?

&gt; The important parameter is the free fall speed. At the center the

Yes, once it is at L1. It would be tension from tidal
force as a completed L1 shield was manouvered past the
Earth to get it into location.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The return to the Moon is in fact proposing just that smelters. Ca you
&gt;&gt; &gt; build a smelter that is small?

&gt;&gt; You can, but at 5 tonne/km^2, a 700km diameter shield
&gt;&gt; has a mass of nearly 2 million tonne. Unless each

No, a smelter takes in ore and produces pig metal. A VN

them into a copy of itself which could also act as a
smelter. The downside is that it needs components to
assemble which you don't have and the vast majority of
the final item would be geared to the more complex task
of replication, not smelting. A smelter need only be
some refractory container, a large mirror, some means of

methods for loading and unloading.

Exactly. Now you have a choice:

a) create a copy of all of that in space and put all

b) keep the industry down here and only lift the end

c) produce the simplest and lightest factory capable

My money would be on (c) but it is still sci-fi nonsense,
there's no way we could bring a 2 million tonne asteroid

The point is that you have a vast array of
different types of factories on Earth, each
making a very limited range of parts. For
the shield, we only need a panel factory,
not factories to make all the parts necessary
to build more factories. Putting the whole of
Earth industry into space is nonsensical.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Yes, or better sent as panels for assembly in situ. You
&gt; &gt; can set up the factory near Earth and send individual
&gt; &gt; panels which are added to the structure at L1 over some

&gt; &gt; asteroid of several million tonnes and bring it into
&gt; &gt; Earth orbit, then process it into panels and send them
&gt; &gt; either into individual Earth orbits or for assemble at L1.

&gt; &gt; What I was talking about some posts back was the tidal

&gt; &gt; Yes. You are trying to create a sunshield, nothing more.
&gt; &gt; You have suggested VN as a means to that end only and
&gt; &gt; I have pointed out that we do not have a capability of
&gt; &gt; self-replication in any form whatsoever

&gt; &gt; &gt; A VN system takes in raw material and replicates. The replication is
&gt; &gt; &gt; complete. If we have smelters we produce more smelters.

&gt; &gt; No, a smelter takes in ore and produces pig metal. A VN
&gt; &gt; machine would take in pre-processed components and turn
&gt; &gt; them into a copy of itself which could also act as a
&gt; &gt; smelter. The downside is that it needs components to
&gt; &gt; assemble which you don't have and the vast majority of
&gt; &gt; the final item would be geared to the more complex task
&gt; &gt; of replication, not smelting. A smelter need only be
&gt; &gt; some refractory container, a large mirror, some means of
&gt; &gt; separating the products when in liquid phase (there's no
&gt; &gt; gravity so maybe it has to rotate like a centrifuge) and
&gt; &gt; methods for loading and unloading.

No, there are two points here. First factories

It gets even worse after that. Space is an irradiated near vacuum with
large mountains flying around everywhere at very high speed, and the
next nearest two planets are a boiling inferno and a frozen desert.

However, on the bright side, the basic laws of physics that apply to our
dire planetary situation are fairly well understood right now.

Even if civilization collapsed tomorrow, we'd still have a chance.

I agree that we have probably rxhausted the aruments. There is however
one twist. A think tank commissioned by Tony Blair has talked about
STRONG AI (robot rights) before 2050. Strong AI will mean all the
concomitants of weak AI. You cannot have it both ways.

I think that the differences between us are those of expected time
scale. My proposal for VN technology is based on 2 things.

1) The long time scales proposed by the global warming doommongers.
2) Ray Kurzweil says that we will have a singularity by 2030-40. I
think he is over optimistic. My views in fact lie somewhat between
Kurzweil and the GW doom mongers.

You say "been and gone". We can of course try to live with global
warming. There is yet another twist on hydrogen. If lands are going to
become arid you can use solar energy to desalinate water.
Delaslinatioon, as well as hydrogen production does not have to be
24/7 unlike general power generation.

All my suggestions reduce the amount of fossil carbon
being introduced into the atmosphere which is the key,
if you get the heating from C)2 down, the stored
methane will not get released, or at least the amount

The time constant is caused by the fact that there is methane in
permafrost. As this thaws methane gets released. There has been

the unstable equilibrium caused by methane. The fact that methane

Let us do a little thinking round this problem Suppose we built a
robot with similar joints to a human and with electric motors or
fluidic circuits to activate them. Personally I like the idea of a
fluidic robot woth one central pump and pistons for limbs. Building
this (without AI) is a fairly trivial extercise. We could provide
pressure sensors for the finger tips to provide a general "feel".
There is nothing here, except of course for the AI element which could
not be built by a reasonable tean of engineering undergraduates.

Of course without a brain our assembly could not do anything useful.
If it had radio transmittor/receivers it could do a range of things
with telepresence but it would not be capable of acting autonomously.
Put in AI and it then becomes an autonomous machine that you could
send up to repair Hubble, and if in space would do everything an
astronaut could do - and more as we know that robots in medicine are
capable of cutting with a precision that no surgeon can manage.

That is why I talk about AI (need only be weak) as being the key to
achieving Von Neumann + other robotic tasks. Of couse the
"understanding" we need is different from "?Quieres dormir con
fosforo?". CAD files of course form a basis for geometrical and
physical understanding. This sentence BTW is quite an embarassment to
singularists as it does imply a certain amount of the "emotion" they
talk about!

Let us think a little bit more deeply about how we might repair
Hubble. We have of course Hubble CAD files. AI would then be able to
tell us the sort of robot we would need for the task. Chances are it
would be far simpler than the full anthropomorhism I have spoken about
above.

True and not true. There is one thing you have forgotten. In 1815

That comment does not address the economic case I made above,
nor is it even correct.

We have has several volcanic eruptions in the past few decades
and while their effect is visible in the records, it is small
compare to the greenhouse heating and lasts only a few years.
The CO2 already in the atmosphere _now_ will still be causing
elevated temperatures next century so while a major eruption
might give some partial temporary respite, its effects will
disappear in less than a decade. Nobody will be trying to burn
more carbon until the fossil fuels have run out and we are
looking for a way to combat the next ice age, and that could
be thousands of years away.

Good point. Dexterity is a function of 2 things. It is a function of
the AI system and it is also a function of the motors used. Prothetic
limbs up to now have used stepping motors which stop after every
click. It is this insistance on stopping after every click which is
limiting dexterity. An agile Prothsetic Limb would not have this
limitation. Indeed we could define "agile" a meaning unable to stop
after every click. It is interesting to note that when normal limbs
move the die is cast as soon as they start moving. Indeed sports
coaches have just discovered this and they tell a sportsperson to look
elewhere as soon as the "commit" is over.

The other thing an APL needs is a measure of AI. If the nerves can be
grafted on this problem is circumvented. An APL could be controlled in
a number of ways. It could be controlled by balance, an artificial
horizon in a pair of spectacles could ensure that you did not fall
over and balance was maintained. Full AI could take you up and down
stairs using a camera.

Stepping motors are used to some extent because of the lack of
confidence in AI. With AI one would immediately abandon the need to
stop.

There is one point on social policy and cost. Would it be cheaper to
develop an APL or to pull down buildings and use ramps instead of
steps. Using ramps strikes me as being very expensive. A footbridge
with a ramp costs many times one with steps. In fact to simply climb
steps you do not need full AI. You just need a set of LEDs (possible
NIR) on each step as APL aligners.

Another point. You say later on that the cost would be prohibitive. I
think the cost of ramps is prohibitive! There is an important point
here. If this is done in stages there will be money all the way down
the line. NOT the case with ISS.

&gt; &gt; Of course without a brain our assembly could not do anything useful.
&gt; &gt; If it had radio transmittor/receivers it could do a range of things
&gt; &gt; with telepresence but it would not be capable of acting autonomously.
&gt; &gt; Put in AI and it then becomes an autonomous machine that you could
&gt; &gt; send up to repair Hubble, and if in space would do everything an
&gt; &gt; astronaut could do - and more as we know that robots in medicine are
&gt; &gt; capable of cutting with a precision that no surgeon can manage.

&gt; Sure it could, and if we had anything like that capability
&gt; it would be up there doing it, but nobody has built a
&gt; general purpose robot hand that can put a nut on a screw
&gt; with sufficient feeling to avoid cross-threading it.

This is being developed by Andrew Ng at Stanford. When you say "it
would be put up there". The establishment of NASA is wedded to manned
space flight. Hubble could have been designed differently. Good idea -
cross threading is a problem we might give a student!

You are raising a number of specific problems. I don't believe these
are showstoppers. They do mean that you need a completely dedicated
team. Andrew Ng is also doing research in linguistic AI. BTW - Google
is going into AI but they don't seem to know what they are about.
Stations are still elastic "La estacion de resorte". Whle I wonder
whether you would want to go out with a "fosforo". It does not seem to
know the different types of match.

&gt; &gt; True and not true.

&gt; True. The alternatives I have suggested may not yet be at
&gt; break-even point but all provide a commercial return which
&gt; is comparable to the outlay. Your scheme is vastly more
&gt; expensive, thousands of billions of dollars at least, and
&gt; provides no return whatsoever. It is not a credible
&gt; alternative to existing schemes in any way whatsoever.

I think the intermediate points will.

&gt; &gt; There is one thing you have forgotten. In 1815
&gt; &gt; Tambora erupted and we had the &quot;year without a summer&quot;. A space based
&gt; &gt; system would be capable of INCEASING the amount of sunlight falling on
&gt; &gt; Earth. In the next volcanic eruption we might well try to persuade
&gt; &gt; people to burn MORE carbon!

&gt; That comment does not address the economic case I made above,
&gt; nor is it even correct.

&gt; We have has several volcanic eruptions in the past few decades
&gt; and while their effect is visible in the records, it is small
&gt; compare to the greenhouse heating and lasts only a few years.
&gt; The CO2 already in the atmosphere _now_ will still be causing
&gt; elevated temperatures next century so while a major eruption
&gt; might give some partial temporary respite, its effects will
&gt; disappear in less than a decade. Nobody will be trying to burn
&gt; more carbon until the fossil fuels have run out and we are
&gt; looking for a way to combat the next ice age, and that could
&gt; be thousands of years away.

Tamborra was the biggest. True you don't want more CO2 but you might
want more sunlight.

People are scaring us with a VEI 8 such as Yellowstone.
