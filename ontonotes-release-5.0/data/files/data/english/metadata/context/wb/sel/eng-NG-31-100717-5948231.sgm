Koizumi's Bad Bet on Iraq

By Chris Rowthorn
Created Oct 22 2006 - 9:24am

When former Prime Minister Koizumi deployed Japan's Self Defense Force to
Iraq in 2004, it was clear that he did so in hopes that the Bush
administration would, in return, be obliged honor the Japan-US Security
Treaty. According to the terms of this treaty, the United States is legally
bound to protect Japan from external military threats. It is now clear that
Mr. Koizumi's "investment" in Iraq did not pay off, and that the Japan-US
Security Treaty was yet another international treaty that the Bush
administration had no intention of honoring.

It is not just Mr. Koizumi and his successor, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who
should be upset with Mr. Bush; every Japanese citizen ought to feel outraged
at the Bush administration. For the Bush administration did more than just
allow the regime of Kim Jong Il to develop nuclear weapons: the Bush
administration actually compelled North Korea to develop nuclear weapons.

Soon after taking office, Bush labeled North Korea a member of the "Axis of
Evil," along with Iraq and Iran. This completely unnecessary announcement
served no purpose other than to put the leaders and citizens of these
countries on full alert, causing them to expect an attack by the United
States. The citizens of Iraq didn't have to wait long for these fears to be
realized. And even as the occupation of Iraq drifted inexorably into a
quagmire, Bush made well-publicized preparations to invade Iran, accompanied
by the usual media barrage of anti-Iran media stories.

At the same time, the Bush administration ended the Clinton administration's
successful policy of direct negotiations with North Korea, under which North
Korea had agreed to suspend its development of plutonium in exchange for
economic aid. And while he flexed his military muscles in the Middle East,
Bush made it clear that he had no intention of a entering into a military
conflict with North Korea, famously cutting America's troop presence in
South Korea and pulling troops back from the border with North Korea.

Thus, it is clear that Bush gave North Korea a huge incentive to develop
nuclear weapons (fear of attack), and then removed its incentive for not
doing so. It is hard to think of a more spectacular example of inept
statesmanship in recent history.

The tragedy here is that the development of a nuclear weapon is a check-mate
move on the part of North Korea, since that country already possesses
missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons to Tokyo and Seoul. And
despite billions spent on "Star Wars" missile defense programs, there is no
way to stop such missiles once they are launched. Thus, the only defense
against an enemy like North Korea is to prevent the country from developing
nuclear weapons in the first place.

This is precisely what George W. Bush failed to do. He sat back while Kim
Jong Il maneuvered himself into a position where he could hold the 12
million citizens of Tokyo and the 10 million citizens of Seoul hostage to
his mad whims. With a gun pointed at the heads of these 22 million Japanese
and Korean citizens, Kim can now dictate the terms of his negotiations with
his Asian neighbors and the United States.

We should remember that Bush originally refused to negotiate with the North
because he felt it was a sign of weakness to "negotiate with a dictator".
Now that Kim has nuclear weapons, he will be forced to negotiate with him,
only from a position of incredible weakness.

Adding to this farce is the Bush administration's current attempt to resolve
the crisis via the United Nations. Bush deliberately went against the UN in
invading Iraq, thereby significantly undermining the authority of the UN.
Bush appointed John Bolton as America's ambassador to the UN, a man who once
said, "There is no such thing as the United Nations. There is only the
international community, which can only be led by the only remaining
superpower, which is the United States." Now that his "policy" on North
Korea has proved a spectacular failure, it is pathetic to see Bush appealing
to the United Nations to step in and save the day. It would be laughable if
millions of lives didn't hang in the balance.

Now that the Japanese have been so thoroughly let down by George W. Bush and
the Republican Party, what are they to do? I believe that it is time for
Japan to exert some of its enormous power over the United States. Japan
holds some 690 billion dollars of America's foreign debt. Japan should make
clear to the Bush administration that it will diversify its holdings and
start purchasing Euros and other currencies unless the Bush administration
reopens direct negotiations with North Korea. Furthermore, it should its
huge influence over the United States to see that the Bush administration
and future American presidential administrations act as responsible players
on the world stage, upholding not just the Japan-US Security Treaty, but
also major international treaties.
