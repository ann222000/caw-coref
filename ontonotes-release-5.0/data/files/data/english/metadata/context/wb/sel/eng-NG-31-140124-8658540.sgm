CAM INMAN: TIMES COLUMNIST

OAKLAND -- congratulations, Coach K, you got your first &quot;W.&quot;

All it took was a blocked field goal on Sunday's final play, giving your
Raiders a 26-24 win over the Cleveland Browns and mercifully snapping an
11-game franchise losing streak.

You, Lane Kiffin, are off the schneid. So are your Raiders. Finally.

You took the win in stride, though you could have come into your
postgame press conference with champagne or a cold beer in your hand.
Heck, that's what the coach next door does in the winter time, God love
Nellie.

&quot;There's a relief of the win,&quot; you said, &quot;because it helps your team and
it helps what you're selling all along.&quot;

For you to keep selling your goods to the Raider Nation, you needed this
win. Falling to 0-3, and doing so against the Cleveland Browns, and with
the unpopular Josh McCown as your starting quarterback, you would have
had one miserable Monday.

But, in the nick of time, you called a T.O., baby! Or, should I say, you
pulled a Shanahan.

Yes, surely you remember last week, when your first NFL victory was
snatched from your clutches, all because Denver coach Mike Shanahan
called a last-ditch timeout to nullify what would have been a winning
field goal by Sebastian Janikowski.

So, having learned from that shrewd move in last week's heartbreaking
loss, you opted to ice Phil Dawson, who hit a winning field goal here
two years ago as time expired to lift the Browns to a 9-7 win.

&quot;Oh yeah. I learned from Mike,&quot; you said of the timing of Sunday's
timeout. &quot;Thanks Mike.&quot;

You should also thank Tommy Kelly. He's the one who smacked down
Dawson's low, 40-yard attempt. It was the Raiders' &quot;Hand of God&quot; block,
with apologies to Diego Maradona's &quot;Hand of God&quot; goal in the 1986 World Cup.

Before Kelly's magic touch, you told the officials you were going to
call The Timeout, and you quickly learned you didn't quite have the same
rank as Shanahan.

&quot;I don't have as many years in the league as Mike, so I had to signal
for it,&quot; you said. &quot;I went a second before I wanted to, but it worked.&quot;

Yep, just like a week ago, the visiting kicker went through the motion
and booted his attempt through the uprights, only to have it waved off
because of a timeout.

&quot;I didn't hear the whistle,&quot; Dawson said. &quot;So I thought we won the game.&quot;

Hah! Ain't payback a ...

Well, for you, Lane, it's an official NFL win, something most
32-year-old coaches can't claim on their resumes.

You told us the whole team gets a ceremonial game ball for this victory.
You need not be so humble.

Your backup quarterback -- or, may I please say, your &quot;starting
quarterback&quot; -- Daunte Culpepper told us that linebacker Kirk Morrison
presented you the game ball.

&quot;And (you) deserved it,&quot; Culpepper said.

&quot;Someone just gave it to me,&quot; you said. &quot;I didn't grab it. I told our
team ... that's going to everybody. No individual won that game.&quot;

You're correct. But it must be nice to know your players thought enough
to single you out afterward.

&quot;People don't see the time and effort he puts in,&quot; Morrison said. &quot;He's
got the team where we want to be.&quot;

Your team is not starting a season 0-3, as it has the previous two seasons.

Eight months ago, you got the job because Al Davis liked your offensive
mind and your energy. Those traits showed up Sunday.

You finally called on Culpepper to replace a hobbling McCown, whose bad
foot compounded his penchant for bad fumbles.

Yet you didn't stray from your game plan, which was to run, run, run,
run, and, oh, run.

You didn't scold fans for crudely booing McCown when he got hurt on the
field. Instead, you told us (with a smirk) you didn't hear them because
you were too busy coaching.

You didn't make excuses for one of your USC prodigies, bumbling wide
receiver Mike Williams.

You did show faith in Culpepper, having him throw a crucial third-down
pass to Jerry Porter, who caught it for 20 yards and a first down with 2
minutes, 18 seconds left.

&quot;That was a great call,&quot; Culpepper said.

You wisely didn't go for it on fourth-and-one with 1:14 to go. You
punted. You left it up to your defense and special teams.

Then, after some tense moments, after the &quot;Hand of God&quot; block, you heard
the roar of the crowd.

You heard Greg Papa's classic call replayed on the loudspeakers: &quot;It is
blocked! And the Raiders won the game!&quot;

&quot;It feels good,&quot; you said.

It didn't necessarily look good Sunday, but that one &quot;W&quot; must look real
nice today. It's something five other coaches still don't have this season.

Congratulations.
