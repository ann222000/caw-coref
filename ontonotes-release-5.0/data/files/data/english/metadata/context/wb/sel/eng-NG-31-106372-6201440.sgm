IF there are 3 parnters all owning 1/3 equally in a corporation - can
two band together to get rid of the third?  There are no shareholders
just the three partners.  Is there a buy-out or someting that has to
happen?

If it's a corporation they're shareholders, not partners.  I suppose it
would be possible for them to form a partnership that owns all the
shares, but that really wouldn't change anything.

In the case of a partnership or (in some states) a corporation, you
can't just "get rid" of one of the owners.  What you can do is to sue
to partition the property (business).  A court will order it sold to
the highest bidder.  If two of the "partners" get together and bid,
they can end up buying out the third if their price is the highest.

First, this is the sort of thing that a prudent investor would be sure
is covered by a written agreement at the outset.   Nobody wants bad
things to happen, but the job of a lawyer drafting such an agreement is
to anticipate all the ways they might happen, and to provide a pre-set
and agreed path to be followed for each such contingency as part of the
deal.

Second, your terminology is confusing.   Corporations don't have
partners, they have shareholders, even if no fancy stock certificates
are issued and even if it is privately held.  Each person who owns a
share of the corporation is by definition a "shareholder."

A corporation is a separate legal entity from the individuals who own
it, a "fictive person", which must be created under the laws of a
particular sovereign and comply with that state's registration
requirements to even exist.   If a corporation does something wrong, it
is only the corporation, and not its shareholders, who can usually be
sued.    In order to even be created, a corporation needs written
"articles of incorporation" to be filed with a public records office
that spell out certain parameters of its existence, as well as written
"bylaws" governing its internal operation.   That would be the first
place to look.

A partnership, OTOH exists any time 2 or more persons get together for
a business venture, whether or not they spell out their rights and
duties vs. each other in writing, and whether or not it is intended to
be a permanent bond (like a marriage) or a one-time joint venture for a
particular project.   The general partners are all individually liable
for any debts or torts of the partnership.   If there is no written
partnership agreement, the law provides what will have to happen in the
event various situations occur.

So, was a separate legal entity created under the laws of your state,
or not?

If the venture you are talking about is simply an unwritten
partnership, it can be dissolved (in fact, technically it _is_
dissolved) at any time when one or more of the partners wants "out".
If the 2 remaining partners decide to continue in business together,
that is in effect a brand-new partnership involving just the 2 of them.
But the partnership assets and debts of the "old" partnership would
still have to be split equitably between the 3 former partners.

But you said this was a corporation, so you would have to look to the
rules set out in the corporation's organizing papers (articles of
incorp. and bylaws) as well as what the law requires, to answer your
question.

Yes.  All other things being equal, the majority of shareholders
(owning 2/3 of the corporation) can force the other shareholder out of
managerial control but can't dissolve the minority owner's ownership
interest which is generally represented as a share of the ongoing
profit stream, which does have a calculable market value for sale
purposes.   The majority owners could buy out his interest but only if
he consents.   The only other way to force the minority owner to give
up all interest in the corporation is to dissolve the corporation.   In
that case, the old corporation would cease to exist, and the corporate
assets would have to be fairly split among the shareholders, after
paying off all corporate debts, same as with a partnership.

Obviously, nothing anybody says here is going to be of much direct use
to you since your terms are mixed up.   So, before doing anything rash,
do consult a local lawyer who can get all the facts and review all the
documents and advise you accordingly, if this is a real situation
happening to you.  Good luck,

You seem to have some confusion between a partnership and a
corporation.  A corporation _always_ has stock, although it is
possible for all the stock to be owned by one person -- as was the
case with my father's business in the 1970s.  A partnership never has
stock.

So, let's address the possibilities:

1. The business is a corporation, equally owned by 3 people (_not_
partners).  Each owns 1/3 of the shares.  Those shares can be sold,
although there may be a "shareholder's agreement" restricting who they
can be sold to.  That's fairly common for small and/or closely-held
corporations: the shareholders can sell only to each other, and the
agreement specifies the method for determining the "fair" price to be
paid.  In my experience, this will not be favorable to the person who
"wants out".

OTOH, if two stockholders want to be rid of the remaining one, they
would have to form a new corporation, sell the business to it at a
fair price, and then distribute the value equally among the three
shareholders.  If they try to sell it at below market value, the third
shareholder can ask a court to intervene to protect his interest, and
or sue for "breach of fiduciary duty" -- the management of a
corporation has a duty to operate the corporation for the benefit of the
shareholders, which in practice means maximizing the value of their
shares.

2. The business is a partnership.  Any(*) partner or partners can demand
dissolution of the partnership and distribution of the net assets
(what's left after paying the debts).  If two partners want to be rid
of the third, they can either go to court for a formal dissolution
(expensive), or reach an agreement with the third partner on a fair
price for his "share" of the partnership, then continue the business
as a two-person partnership.  If they can't agree on a price, they
will have to got to court, which costs money.  And it can be hard to
keep the business operating while busy in court, not to mention that
the court may have no option but to dissolve the business in order to
determine the "fair" price.  That will probably be lower than an equal
share of the running business, and it may be possible for the
remaining partners to get the business back in operation again, but
it's not a sure thing.

(*) This assumes a general partnership.  In a "limited" partnership, I
think only the general partner(s) can dissolve the partnership, but
the limited partners are still entitled to be bought out if the
general partner wants to be rid of (some of) them.
to leave.

I'm guessing you mean no shareholders aside from the three.

In no cases I'm aware of can the two just toss the third out w/o
compensation. This is true unless there is something in the nature of
the organizational agreement which would allow such a move. I seriously
doubt such an agreement element would exist.
