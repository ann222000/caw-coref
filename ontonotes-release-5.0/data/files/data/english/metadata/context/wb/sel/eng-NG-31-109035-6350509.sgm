As a top, I like plotting and planning scenes, and I like
playing with new people.  It's really fun for me to figure out
what someone likes and put together a scene that will delight
them.  I'm told that I'm rather good at this.  The general
process is that we chat about what we both like and dislike,
and then my brain starts processing until inspiration hits.
Once it does, I construct a scene around whatever idea works.

A few weeks ago, I played with someone new-- new to me,
though definitely not new to the scene.  I've been around the
community for around fifteen years, and this person predates
me by a fair bit.  I wanted to make this scene excellent,
both because the person involved is particularly interesting
and intriguing, and partially because he has a very strange
but special niche in my heart.

So we chatted about interests.  I waited for inspiration, but
none was forthcoming.  We chatted some more.  I eliminated
a few things, but no inspiration.  We chatted some more,
and then zilch.

It came time to pack the toys.  Now what?  I eventually punted
and packed a generic sort of toybag, with some of this, some
of that, some of the other thing, and the usual assortment of
stuff that has permanent residence in the bag.

I picked him up, and we went to dinner.  I had no idea at
all what I was going to do with him, and I was running out
of time to figure it out.  Dinner ended, we headed for the
playspace, and still nothing.  Oh shit.  We hung out a bit,
decided on a playstation, and he headed off to the restroom.
While he was gone, I decided to try one of my favorite
mood-setting techniques-- unpack a strange assortment of
toys and lay them out as though I was preparing for surgery.
The assortment included:

- hot pink rope
- cuffs
- some random whips
- battens
- a rat trap
- pom pons

That should be enough to make anyone wonder what was up,
but my friend came back, glanced at the collection, and then
casually started getting undressed.  Argh!  I'm so not used
to playing with people who have as much experience as I do.
And I still have no idea what I'm about to do.

I get him tied to the table, and pull out my claws to do some
random sensation play while I figure out what's next.  OK, that
seems to work... quite nicely, in fact.  A bit more of that,
and I'm in full-on improv mode.  I've completely forgotten that
I have no idea what I'm about to do, and I'm just doing it.
Everything falls into place like I'd planned it all along.

It turned out to be an amazingly wonderful evening.

You're so lucky.  It drives me nuts that I always seem to work the
other way 'round--I cna do all the planning I want, but every scene
eventually becomes improv.  They usually also go well, but I'd like to
have them go well inadvance, if you know what I mean.

If the scene you're describing is the one I heard going on a couple of
weeks ago (I heard the shouting), then I'd bet that said person trusts
you and was simply playing you back by acting non-challant.

Now come on, if the thing is going right you don't have enough brain on the
planet to still be able to decide how to act. Its  the old brain chemistry
that we are   altering here after all.

That was singing.  I know it was probably hard to tell.

Oh, they're always improv.  I just like figuring out the rough
shape of the story ahead of time when I can.  Starting a scene
and having no clue at all what I expect to be doing in ten seconds
can be terriflying.
