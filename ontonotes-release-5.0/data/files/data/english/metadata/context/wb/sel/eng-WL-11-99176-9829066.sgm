Things I don't understand :

Pakistani and Western security experts said the governmentâ€™s insistence that Ms. Bhutto, a former prime minister, was not killed by a bullet was intended to deflect attention from the lack of government security around her.

This is absurd. We know there were gun shots fired at Bhutto. We know there was a bomb exploded near her car. It is 100% clear that there was insufficient security around her, be it &amp;quot;government&amp;quot; security or her own security. Whether she was actually killed by the gunshots, shrapnel from the bomb, or by smashing her head into the car thanks to the force of the bomb, makes absolutely no difference whatsoever , other than which individual gets charged with attempted murder and which individual with actual murder. Otherwise it's a complete tempest in a teapot, and the idea that what is happening is some kind of government conspiracy rather than routine confusion surrounding an event like this is nonsense, and a complete diversion from the real story.

Update: And a close runner-up :

The United States provided a steady stream of intelligence to Benazir Bhutto about threats against her before the former Pakistani prime minister was assassinated.

A &amp;quot;steady stream&amp;quot; of intel, eh? That must be a real testament to the value of U.S. intelligence, right? Uh, not so much:

Much of what was passed on dealt with general threats from Taliban extremists and al-Qaida sympathizers and &amp;quot;was not actionable information.&amp;quot;

Yes, I'm sure Bhutto really needed that &amp;quot;steady stream of (unactionable) intel&amp;quot; to let her know she was in danger. I wonder if John McCain will be going after this wasteful government spending, an &amp;quot;intelligence&amp;quot; agency which knows no more than every reader of a newspaper.

&amp;quot;and the idea that what is happening is some kind of government conspiracy rather than routine confusion surrounding an event like this is nonsense&amp;quot;

Exactly, why would it be nonsense to investigate a possible conspiracy by Musharraf to remove her security detail?

Especially when Bhutto herself wrote to hold him responsible for her death?

Maybe it's not the case, but why is it nonsense to inquire?

As for the shooting vs. bombing, you have to wonder why the government is warping the facts, I can't see who benefits or what the different accounts might reveal about the identity of the assassins.

As Robert Fisk wrote today:

&amp;quot;...let's run through this logic in the way that Inspector Ian Blair might have done in his policeman's notebook before he became the top cop in London.

Question: Who forced Benazir Bhutto to stay in London and tried to prevent her return to Pakistan? Answer: General Musharraf.

Question: Who ordered the arrest of thousands of Benazir's supporters this month? Answer: General Musharraf.

Question: Who placed Benazir under temporary house arrest this month? Answer: General Musharraf.

Question: Who declared martial law this month? Answer General Musharraf.

Question: who killed Benazir Bhutto?

Er. Yes. Well quite.

You see the problem? Yesterday, our television warriors informed us the PPP members shouting that Musharraf was a &amp;quot;murderer&amp;quot; were complaining he had not provided sufficient security for Benazir. Wrong. They were shouting this because they believe he killed her.&amp;quot;

On a side note, I was wondering if anyone had seen this:

33

I find it amazing that A) Frost asked no follow-up questions, and B) that no major newspaper (or minor one) has picked up this story from less than two months ago.

z, I'm not saying it's nonsense to investigate, or that Musharraf wasn't directly or indirectly responsible. All I'm saying is that the idea that it somehow makes him &amp;quot;look better&amp;quot; if the gunman missed than if he was on target is preposterous.

Eli,

This thing has to do with whether she
is a martyr or not.
If she hit her head on the handle.
Twisted logic says she is not a martyr.
This is just muslim fighting over the meaning of word &amp;quot;is&amp;quot;.

This is the most sensible commentary on the shambles that I have read so far. Most western observers, including the revered and usually responsible Fisk, have leapt to conclusions based on conviction rather than evidence.

What is more important for Pakistan is the democratic process. The Pakistan People's Party quite rightly demands free and fair voting. It's a pity they didn't allow a free and fair vote to choose their party leader after Benazir's murder.

I would like to know why people were allowed to crowd her car. Why were they not kept a distance away? How can you have security with a crowd mobbing her?

I recommend this commentary from Socialist Worker, which includes a discussion of &amp;quot;Who Killed Benazir
Bhutto?&amp;quot;:

Paxnik,

Pakistan has always been a coalition between
the military and land holding families.
There is is no democracy. So their is no choice. It is the military that is not allowing free and fair election. Nothing will change that. this is 60 years of Pakistan's history.
It is in the social and cultural fabric that cannot change just because you wish it to.

Brain,
The reason crowd was allowed close
is because she wanted to project her image as champion of the people (a false image).
