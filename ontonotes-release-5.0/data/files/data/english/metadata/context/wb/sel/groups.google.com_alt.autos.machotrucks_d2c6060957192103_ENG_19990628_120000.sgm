Now THAT'S how to do it!

Thank you for providing an example of the RIGHT way to make pictures and
such available to readers of this newsgroup, _without_ posting huge
encoded-binary articles where they don't belong -- as, it seems, so many

You are absolutely right, Lee. i'll stop this nonsense now.
Its been provene time and time again that nobody gives in, in a NG.
All i would've like was that we cut new commers some slack so that
they run off again. Thank you for stopping me before this thread got
out of hand TOO. Some people seem to thrive on that.

NOSPAM or Jay or whatever. YOu win. Do what ever you want in here (
that you would never do to somebody inperson ). I don't care.

&gt; You are absolutely right, Lee. i'll stop this nonsense now.
&gt; Its been provene time and time again that nobody gives in, in a NG.
&gt; All i would've like was that we cut new commers some slack so that
&gt; they run off again. Thank you for stopping me before this thread got
&gt; out of hand TOO. Some people seem to thrive on that.

&gt; NOSPAM or Jay or whatever. YOu win. Do what ever you want in here (
&gt; that you would never do to somebody inperson ). I don't care.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [snip]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Since you're trying _so_ hard to be ignorant, let me enlighten you to
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;obvious...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Virtually every standard personal Internet access account offered by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;virtually every ISP in the country includes at least as few MB of
&gt;&gt;&quot;Personal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Web Space&quot;, and complete step-by-step instructions on how to use it
&gt;&gt;appear
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;on the ISP's home page. For those relatively few users who may not
have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this feature included in their basic ISP account, there are several
FREE
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;picture-hosting sites on the WWW which will happily allow you to post
any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;non-pornographic image, and link to it. So, there is NO excuse for
&gt;&gt;posting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;picture files to non-binary newsgroups, PERIOD.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guess you dont have any tolrenace or emagination to figure out why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some people post to the ng. YOu are such a self righteous prick.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [snip]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It doesn't take much imagination (that is the word you were trying
for,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wasn't it?) to figure that out: Sheer ignorance -- and, sometimes,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;arrogance (much like you habitually display). Attempting to defend
it,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;especially in such juvenile terms as you seem wont to use, is the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;approximate equivalent of procaiming, &quot;I'm proud to be stupid!&quot;

yeah you could do that boris but then you oud have to notify most ISp
cause most poeple in here break the ruel once or twice by either
posting pic's or use bad language.
I am am afraid that i am to balme for this nonesencial thread since i
took it upon myself to correct Jay in his manors of &quot;asling&quot; somebody
not to post binary in this NG.
This thread has become non-productive and so we should really drop it.

Gotta tell ya, I for one am sick and tired of these self appointed, pompous,
tight assed people that spend all day either correcting or belittling
others. Most of them must spend their life with one hand on the keyboard and
the other in their lap.Learn to cut people some slack and lighten the heck
up.
Nomex on, flame away&gt;

elses.
