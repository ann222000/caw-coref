I am trying to find a simple theoretical derivation of refraction.  Here
is my thinking so far.  Light in absence of charge satisfies
dE/dt=c1 curl B
dB/dt=-c2 curl E
where c1 and c2 are constants of the medium (permeability or something
like that?), and my minus sign might be misplaced.  Presumable in the
two different mediums, the constants c1 and c2 are different.

Solving the wave equation itself is the easy part.  What is giving me
difficulties is figuring out the boundary conditions at the interface
between the two media.  Presumably something has to remain continuous
across the interface.

If I simply work with the scalar wave equation
d^2L/dt^2=c^2 Laplacian L
and assume something like L and the normal directional derivative of L
are continuous across the interface, my back of the envelope
calculations seem to give rise to strange phenomena at the critical
angle of incidence, namely that there is zero internal reflection, but
in the other medium is some strange kind of standing wave traveling
parallel to the interface - some extreme kind of evanescent wave.

But perhaps instead I should assume that E and B are continuous across
the interface.  But really, I am completely guessing.

Maybe this is something that is worked out in a typical graduate physics
course, but I never took one of those, so I don't know.

In your answers, you may assume I am mathematically sophisticated, but
know very little about physics.

Glad you are having mathematical fun reinventing the wheel!
You are guessing correctly about E and B except that you have to
separately consider the normal and tangential components.

I don't want to spoil the ending for you, but if you get tired
wandering in the wilderness, get a copy of Plonsey and Collin
&quot;Principles and Applications of Electromagnetic Fields&quot; and start
reading about page 348 or so. Hell, on second thought, read the whole

I will definitely take your advice.

Feel free to spoil the ending for me by answering the following
question.  If I assume that the permittivity and permeability constants
change across the interface, but by different ratios, does that lead to
the reflected and refracted light being polarized?

Thanks, Stephen

Even then you'll be in trouble. Different frequencies refract through

I'd suggest looking at diffraction first and then consider the media

not
crystalline and nor is water, so it would seem that some statistical
function
might be involved.  Then there is polarisation:

Yes, I do appreciate that the simple model I am considering would not
account for different frequencies giving different amounts of
refraction.  I am just trying to get some kind of first order approximation.

I bet it's harder than even this.  You have this electrically polarized
material called water, and presumably on the macro scale this
polarization appears just to be a material satisfying Maxwell's
equations, but with a different permittivity than a vacuum.  But
presumably this is simply a convenient approximation, and at different
frequencies the quantum nature of the water molecules (i.e. they are
discrete things) gives rise to different apparent permittivities in the
macro scales.

But I'm really interested in only deriving the first order
approximations, and my guess is that the more detailed calculations
rapidly become next to impossible to perform.

Then there is polarisation:

On the other hand, my guess is that my simple minded approach (change in
permittivity but permeability stays constant) will very much account for
polarization.  My impression is that the polarizing effect of refraction
and internal reflection is by no means a subtle effect, and as such
should be explainable without doing the really advanced difficult
calculations.

but I don't see its relevance to this discussion.

Anyway, curl is precisely a 3D phenomenon.  In 2D curl produces a
scalar, and in 4D curl produces a &quot;6 vector&quot; (more precisely an
anti-symmetric 4x4 matrix).

Actually, a 2D curl of a vector is technically a pseudo-scalar.  In
general, curls make up a class of Clifford objects known as bi-vectors
and can indeed be defined for any number of dimensions without any
problems arising.  But, talking to Androcles about vector calculus is
a complete waste of effort.  He doesn't understand what any of it

Yes.  What I meant was the notion of an operator &quot;curl,&quot; satisfying the
appropriate properties, taking vectors to vectors, can only take place
in 3D, because it is only in 3D that &quot;bi-vectors&quot; (or &quot;2-forms&quot;) are 3D
objects.

: &gt;
: &gt;
: &gt; Even then you'll be in trouble. Different frequencies refract through

: account for different frequencies giving different amounts of
: refraction.  I am just trying to get some kind of first order
approximation.
:
: &gt; I'd suggest looking at diffraction first and then consider the media
: &gt; interface
: &gt; as a molecular lattice, except that doesn't work too well. Flint glass
is
: &gt; not
: &gt; crystalline and nor is water, so it would seem that some statistical
: &gt; function
: &gt; might be involved.
:
: I bet it's harder than even this.  You have this electrically polarized
: material called water, and presumably on the macro scale this
: polarization appears just to be a material satisfying Maxwell's
: equations, but with a different permittivity than a vacuum.

Well of course. Vacuum doesn't have any permittivity. Maxwell's aether
was disposed of by the Michelson-Morley experiment so its properties
have to vanish as well.

&quot;It is known that Maxwell's electrodynamics--as usually understood at the
present time--when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do
not appear to be inherent in the phenomena.&quot;
http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/ , opening sentence.

&quot;But the ray moves relatively to the initial point of k, when measured in
the stationary system, with the velocity c-v&quot;
http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/ , section III.

At least you can simplify your c1 and c2 constants to unity by assuming the
refraction is for one medium only, the other being vacuum. That should make
it
easier to understand.

But
: presumably this is simply a convenient approximation, and at different
: frequencies the quantum nature of the water molecules (i.e. they are
: discrete things) gives rise to different apparent permittivities in the
: macro scales.

Yes, well, it's mostly vacuum between the molecules anyway, as are the
molecules
themselves. What we are concerned with is electromagnetic forces steering
photons like the bumpers on a pin-table steer the ball and why the ball
always
reaches the flippers.  As I said, there is a statistical function involved,
permittivity and permeability are macroscopic constants that need not apply
to a single photon but will retard most. If traffic lights in a city are 88
feet
apart and synchronised to 30 mph you can drive through at 60 mph or
15 mph without stopping (theoretically, that is, watch out for cops).

: But I'm really interested in only deriving the first order
: approximations, and my guess is that the more detailed calculations
: rapidly become next to impossible to perform.

You'll never solve it; there are no solutions to the three-body problem,
let alone many bodies as in molecules. There are special cases, of course.

:   Then there is polarisation:
: &gt; http://www.brantacan.org.uk/PolaBox.jpg
: &gt;
:
: On the other hand, my guess is that my simple minded approach (change in
: permittivity but permeability stays constant) will very much account for
: polarization.  My impression is that the polarizing effect of refraction
: and internal reflection is by no means a subtle effect, and as such
: should be explainable without doing the really advanced difficult
: calculations.

Guess away and have impressions; as I said, have fun.

: Here I don't understand you at all!!!!  I get the sense that you are
: somehow trying to point me towards the so called &quot;hairy ball theorem&quot;,
: but I don't see its relevance to this discussion.

To understand refraction you need to understand what a photon is, because
that's what is being refracted.
Maxwell thought light was a wave in aether, a kind of &quot;sound in air&quot;
or &quot;ripples on water&quot; model.  The photon is a hairy ball problem,
hence polarisation. I'm all in favour of simplification, but first we need
to discard the ideas Maxwell introduced with his aether. Divergence
I can accept, but I cannot construct curl in 3D.  It's a hairy ball.
Try it. Start with a swastika in the x-y-plane and rotate about all three
axes.

: Anyway, curl is precisely a 3D phenomenon.  In 2D curl produces a
: scalar, and in 4D curl produces a &quot;6 vector&quot; (more precisely an
: anti-symmetric 4x4 matrix).
:
Draw it in 3D then.  If you are competent in mathematics then
you'll know mathematics is all about proof, not merely symbol

Actually mathematics at its most pure is just symbol pushing - what you
are really saying is that you want some kind of physical demonstration
of what curl is.

My understanding of curl comes from fluid dynamics rather than
electrodynamics.  If you have a vector field u, it generates a flow
(that is, just follow the vector field).  Now consider a small particle
carried by the flow.  As it moves with the flow, it might also
experience a rotation.  The angular velocity of the rotation is the curl
(in this case also called vorticity).  In 3D, angular velocity is often
described by a vector (or pseudo-vector if you want to be more precise),
whose direction is the axis of rotation, and whose length is the actual
velocity.  In 2D this is simply a scalar.  In 4D this is a 6D quantity -
because if you think about it, 4D rotations have 6 degrees of freedom.

Solving the wave equation is easy because we know that we have plane-wave
solutions. Yes, boundary conditions matter. For the fields, the components
of E and H parallel to the interface are continuous across the interface.
The more important boundary condition affecting refraction is that the
component of the wavevector parallel to the interface is the same in both
media. When the speed of the waves differs in the two media, this gives
you Snell's law (also that the angle of reflection equals the angle of
incidence).

That's usual. At the critical angle, the wave in the 2nd medium should be
a uniform plane wave propagating parallel to the interface. For angles
beyond the critical angle, then the amplitude of the wave decays
exponentially as you go away from the interface. You shouldn't have zero
internal reflection for EM waves. Perhaps this is correct for scalar
waves.

Most good EM books and optics books should cover this. The magic words are
&quot;Fresnel coefficients&quot;.

Basically, use the correct boundary conditions for E and H, and you get
two equations, with the reflection and transmission coefficients being the
unknowns. Solve.

For more fun, do the same problem with cylindrical waves and an infinite
cylinder (iirc, this was first done by Rayleigh), and spherical waves and
a sphere (Mie scattering).

The reason this surprises me is because the problem exists to real
fluids, as well as magnetic or electric fields.  In other words, one can
easily visualize two side by side leaves carried by a flow of water,
both of them rotating in the same direction.  The resolution of this
apparent paradox is that this kind of motion is also accompanied by a
large amount of shearing or stretching of the media.

In other words, a flow is fully described by its derivative matrix
D=(du_i/dx_j).  This matrix can be split into its anti-symmetric part
(D-D^T)/2, and symmetric part (D+D^T)/2.  The anti-symmetric part is
precisely what the curl is, and the symmetric part is the strain tensor
that deforms the fluid.  Thus, in a sense, curl is a projection onto the
space of anti-symmetric matrices of the full flow of that fluid element,
and as such is only a partial summary of the fluid's motion.  (I say &quot;in
a sense&quot; because as I'm sure you know, the full flow can be recovered
from only knowing the curl, via the Biot-Savart law.)

This excessive stretching of the underlying media is most certainly
observed in fluids.  I think it is also observed in magnetic fields,
where according to my admittedly &quot;Science Channel&quot; level of expertise,
planetary and solar magnetic fields tend to get highly twisted.  This is
why the surface of the sun is so violent, and perhaps why once in a
while the north and south pole on the earth get reversed.

The &quot;paddle wheels&quot; analogy isn't too bad for 2D flows.  But for 3D
flows it can only be a partial description, because the curl of a vector
field has to have zero divergence.  Thus vorticity in 3D cannot exist
only locally, but must somehow exist in &quot;vortex rings.&quot;  The trouble
with the vortex ring is that its mathematical idealization, where the
ring has infinitesimal width, interacts with itself, and under the
Biot-Savart law moves with infinite velocity.  Nevertheless, if you push
the &quot;vortex rings&quot; notion, you actually get an alternative (and not very
well known) form of the Navier-Stokes equation, which has the added
advantage of being a co-ordinate free description.  (Try rewriting the
Navier-Stokes equation into a different co-ordinate system, say
cylindrical or spherical coordinates, and you will see that it is a
highly non-trivial task.)

Actually one of the most insightful fluid flow models of curl comes
from Airy's study of water waves.  Your insight in the dimensionality
being a key factor is is right on. Airy noticed how waves on the
surface of the water caused circular motion of each element of water
near the surface. &quot;Ball bearings&quot; were not needed! The &quot;flatland&quot;

curl E = -dB/dt is meaningless as the E across a motor brushes clearly
shows. Perhaps this may help:

Here we see a pulse of energy tracing a path in time, alternating
between its magnetic and electric state and of constant magnitude.
It is essentially the same as this:
http://www.kettering.edu/~drussell/Demos/SHO/damp.html
The mass and spring are not moving in the x-direction, the trace
is against time.
This is a photon as much as any other. A finite quantity of
energy starts it off and with no radiation is retained indefinitely.

If you pump energy into it and let it radiate you have a transmitter.

Igor is correct.  You really don't understand vector calculus.  I

Also, Igor, thanks for the heads up.  You saved me a lot of time and

Well, first of all I was only asking to understand refraction.  Vector
calculus concepts like div and curl are things that I think I understand
extremely well.  While I welcome the discussion, I don't think that this
is where I need help.

As to your specific proposal, in the absence of charge, Maxwell's
equations specify that div E and div B are both zero.  This is precisely
the condition satisfied by an incompressible fluid.  Thus I can see why
if one wants to try to understand EM, that a good understanding of the
principles of incompressible fluids is an extremely good place to start.

I personally have invested a great deal of time trying to understand
incompressible fluids, and so this is why when I watch Science Channel
shows about the sun, and how its magnetic fields get all twisted up,
that it all makes total sense to me.  I have written computer programs
to solve incompressible fluids, and you really do see dramatic amounts
of twisting and shearing in the vorticity fields.  They get twisted up
so much that very large vorticities in totally different directions get
very close to each other, and the whole thing looks very much like a
puff pastry.  Very quickly the layers of vorticity get thinner than the
size of molecules.  In the case of fluids, these layers get broken up by
viscosity.  This will result in release of energy.  In the case of
magnetic fields around the sun, the Science Channel tells me that a
similar mechanism releases huge amounts of energy in the magnetic fields
- this causes sun flares - but the Science Channel being what it is,
they didn't give details as to what this mechanism for magnetic fields
might be.  (In the case of fluids, the released energy is boringly
small, especially when one considers that the specific heat capacity of
water is large and so the resulting temperature increase is negligible.)

In any case, it makes complete sense to me that Maxwell would have used
incompressible fluid dynamics in his efforts to understand EM.  It is
just a pity that he couldn't comprehend how neighboring pieces of EM
could both have the same curl without imagining some kind of &quot;ball
bearings&quot; in the aether, when in fact regular normal fluids display
exactly the same behavior.

Androcles is a bitter retired engineer who apparently knows very
little about either physics or math.  How he can arrive at a
conclusion about a purely mathematical notion such as a curl based on
a physical system like a commutator brush is entirely beyond me.  He's
said some really stupid things over the years, and if he wasn't so
mean and nasty, he might even be entertaining.  But, trust me, you'll
never learn anything new from him.

The ideal-gas aether went out as soon as polarisation was recognised as

You might like reading Maxwell's papers from 1861-2 and 1865. His
Treatise, by and large, is stripped down to the equations when it comes to
electrodynamics. His physical reasoning is in the papers.
