Duncan Phyffe was New York's most famous cabinet maker, working from the
late 1780's to 1846. His shop produced quality furniture in successive
versions of the classical style, any example of which is extremely desirable
today. (Here in the states anyhow....I don't know about the rest of the
world when it comes to this......or when it comes to much else
either.....&lt;g&gt;)
However, in the common vernacular, the term Duncan Phyffe furniture has come
to be synonymous with one of the styles which he produced. This style
featured chairs with a thick top rail &amp; stiles joined in one piece with the
seat rail. The carving on the top rail was executed in specific
motifs......thunderbolt, sheaf of wheat &amp;/or a festoon of drapery. The lyre
&amp; the harp motifs were used as splats &amp; a substitute for a baluster on
tables with a center support. Curule legs often appeared on pieces also.

"/> Roy, I think you'll find that a &quot;curule leg&quot; is a revivalist term used
mainly in the USA during their Greco-Roman revival era, first quarter of
the 19th century. As a leg only, IMO, it's a bit of a misnomer, as far as
I know, we over here don't solely apply it to a leg.

Curule, was originally a Roman chair, used by the 'curule' or higher
magistrates, with curved legs and no back so that it could be folded,
made like a campstool with curved legs. It probably derived its name from
the chariot (currus) in which a magistrate was conveyed to a place of
judgment - it served early as a seat of judgment. Subsequently
it became a sign of all higher offices right up to the emperor.

Here's a couple of examples showing what I believe are Roman curule
chairs. ..

Roy,

The curule leg, used late in the classical period on dressing tables &amp; the
like, is based on an ancient Roman type (&amp; probably Egyptian before that)
where two legs on each side roughly form an &quot;X.&quot; Usually the &quot;X&quot; is rounded
though, giving an appearance of grace.

Ronnie, while the pics you show are definitely in the same style as some Duncan Phyfe furniture, it's the legs in this pic:

http://home.cfl.rr.com/last2k/phyfe.jpg

that are commonly found on 1940's furniture. Granted, the 1940's stuff doesn't have the style and carvings that this piece does, but the general shape of the legs are retained.

Have fun, Michele

"/> Michele, this has nothing to do with &quot;curule&quot; nor indeed Cabriole legs,
you have missed the point.

What you show is a typical centre pedestal support, this support
method/style appeared on English long dining tables around the late 18th
century (double, triple and multi-pedestal) when it became fashionable
for smaller dining tables, the single centre pedestal came widely into
fashion, there after, the single pedestal extends to many other
functional pieces. As in the case of the piece in your pic, which appears
to be a turn-over-leaf tea-table or games-table (usually made in matching
pairs) if the leaves were polished on the inside then it was a tea-table,
covered instead with a baize interior then for games use. The platform
pedstal and the hyperboloid, c1830 onwards then become the dominant
fashion which continued well into the 2nd half of the 19th century,
although by then the style and generally workmanship declined, and it all
became rather ugly and uncouth.

... this piece you show is typical of the neoclassical style, drawing
direct influence from the fashionable English pieces of the time frame. I
do not wish to comment on 1940s pieces, as such furniture of that late
date and made in the neoclassical style are nothing more than
reproduction, not antique and never will be antique, ever. The
neoclassical style is still of course reproduced today by the bucket
load, IMO no better no worse than most of the repro of the 1940s.

In the picture shown by Mary Bellack, this is all neoclassical, in the
Adam and Sheraton style .... those dining chairs in the picture, with the
&quot;cross-back&quot; design, they are screaming Sheraton. Mr.Phyffe may have been
a wonderful craftsman this is not in dispute, however, if Mary's picture
is typical Phyffe then there is nothing unique in his design work, merely
manufacturing fashionable English and Euro furniture in the neoclassical
style of Adam and of the Regency (or French Empire) taste. Probably, his
Empire style pieces, being more in the French taste than in the English
Regency taste, obvious reasons.

btw Roy, I made a typo in my last respond to you ...

&quot; ... in England (Britain) by the mid-late 18th century this support
style had lost all its beauty and elegance.&quot;

that &quot;mid-late 18th century&quot; reference obviously should have read
'mid-late 19th century.' ;)

"/> Michele, just a follow up, reference the curving, splayed leg form. This
leg form can be found in the &quot;klismos chair&quot; - developed by the ancient
Greeks. Perfected by the 5th century BC and popular throughout the 4th
century BC, the klismos had four curving, splayed legs the design was
resurrected in the French Directoire and English Regency styles and in
the American Empire style.

Here's a side by side view. The pic to the left is a marble gravestone
relief showing a &quot;kilismos&quot; the 2nd half of the 5th century BC - the
chair shown in the right hand picture, is an English chair of the Regency
period c1825, with the sabre leg of the Greek klismos.This Regency design
is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Trafalgar chair&quot; because it reached its
height of development in 1805, the year of Nelson's famous victory.

Ronnie, Is the chair as delicate as it looks? It appears as though you
can't lean
back without breaking off the design, or was it just for show? Doris

&quot;I am&quot; is reportedly the shortest sentence

Ronnie, it looks like I confused the Quiz thread with the person who wanted to know about the $2500 dining room set. &lt;sigh&gt;

However, whenever the legs in my pic show up on furniture around here, the auctioneers always call the furniture &quot;Duncan Phyfe,&quot; meaning, of course, &quot;Duncan Phyfe STYLE.&quot;&lt;grin&gt;

In reality, as you mention, those legs are a lot older and not specific to just DF furniture, but that doesn't stop most folks from generalizing anyway. If you saw some of the stuff that gets labeled &quot;Chippendale&quot; or &quot;Queen Anne&quot; around here, you'd probably have a fit! Most places &quot;forget&quot; to put &quot;style&quot; after the words, and even then it's a stretch.

Have fun, Michele

chair can suffer weakness in the leg itself. The structural weakness in
the sabre leg, due to the fact it must be cut across the gain at some
point, the scrolling arms on carvers with their wide radius suffer from
the same inherent weakness. Provincial makers were mindful of this
structural weakness in the sabre leg chair so instinctively avoided this
style of chair. As a result, there are some very fine examples and the
rest tend to be good *town* quality workmanship. This fact makes the
period examples expensive chairs, even as singles or pairs, a small set
6s/8s will realize big money and a full blown set 10 -14 one will need a
second mortgage, those with brass inlay are considered to most valuable.
In this case, the repros, late 19th century and especially the Edwardian
copies command high prices as an alternative option to the period pieces.

In the originally Greek &quot;klismos&quot; version, the legs appear to have been
of the steamed and bent wood technique. The Roman form was known as a
&quot;cathedra&quot; from the Latin &quot;chair,&quot; or &quot;seat&quot; although the Roman version
was of a heavy structure, not as delicate as the Greek klismos. Must bear
in mind Doris, the klismos is known not from any ancient specimen still
extant, but from a wealth of pictorial material.

"/> Duncan Phyfe STYLE!! ... god help us all. ;&gt;)

Duncan Phyffe did not originate a new furniture style, he interpreted
fashionable European styles in a graceful manner and with excellent
proportions that he became a major spokesman for Neoclassicism in the
United States. There's no doubt Phyffe had his followers in the States,
but the driving force and major influence for him and his followers
(contemporary or later) were the designs of Sheraton and Sheraton's
four-part &quot;Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterers' Drawing Book.&quot; I am sure Mr.
Phyffe had a copy of that Sheraton book in his own workshop or by the bed
at home, a major and lasting book of work and designs for both the
British and the American neocolonialist.

Phyffe's other major influence was the great English neoclassicist Robert
Adam (1728-1792) - btw Robert Adam was a Scot, as was originally Duncan
Phyffe (Fife) - the Fife family went to the States in 1784, settling in
Albany, N.Y., where Duncan Phyffe worked as an apprentice
cabinetmaker. The Duncan Phyffe furniture, with its low relief carvings
decorated with typical period ornaments - harps, lyres, acanthus leaves,
bow knots, and lion masks, etc was typical of Robert Adam's design and
manner. Later as taste changed Phyffe's pieces developed into the Empire
style. The cross-shaped curving support, as described by someone as
&quot;curule leg&quot; was a design straight out of the Sheraton design book.

However, the 1940s furniture of this period neoclassical style has sweet
bugger all to do with Duncan Phyffe, Sheraton, Robert Adam or the rest of
the period pack. :)

This bent wood constuction seems to me
would be cushiony to sit down on ,nice.
If they were more springy, to me comfortable, and since there are no
specimens perhaps the Greeks figured out how to do what we are all
trying to do.
Take it with them.&lt;g&gt; Thanks for the info.

Duncan Phyfe (1768-1854)
Though he was born near Loch Fannich, Ross and Cromarty, Duncan Phyfe
achieved fame in New York City, where his furniture designs had a lasting
influence in the United States and where he achieved his reputation as
perhaps the greatest of all American cabinetmakers. After emigrating in his
teens and serving his apprenticeship at Albany, he moved to New York City in
1792. His skills led to such a demand for his products that he eventually
employed over 100 carvers and cabinetmakers. It was no longer necessary for
the colonists to send to England for quality furniture.

After the Revolution, Phyfe's workshops were the equal of any in the world.
By 1825, taste dictated that he change his production from the Sheraton,
Regency and French Directoire styles to what is known as the Empire style.
Strongly influenced by the great work of fellow-Scot Robert Adam, Phyfe
satisfied the tastes of wealthy New Yorkers in a rapidly growing metropolis,
especially the particular needs of multi-millionaire and highly influential
John Jacob Astor. Phyfe himself became extremely wealthy.

Mike, here's a piece attributed to Duncan Phyfe from 1810, which has the curule legs, but has a very modern look to it:

http://home.cfl.rr.com/last2k/phyfe1.jpg

And this table from 1815, also by DF, while not modern looking, has quite a bit of grace to it:

http://home.cfl.rr.com/last2k/phyfe.jpg

He may have been catering to the neoclassical styles of the day, but I've gotta admit, it looks a heck of a lot better than the 1940's stuff that bears his name (as a &quot;Style&quot; of course!). &lt;grin&gt;

Have fun, Michele
