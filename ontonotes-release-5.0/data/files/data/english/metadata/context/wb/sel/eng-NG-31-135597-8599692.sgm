For another example, suppose Deriv is a function that takes a function
f and returns a function g, and we want to apply g to a variable x.
In lisp, we would write “((Deriv f) x)”. In Mathematica, we would
write “Deriv[f][x]”.»

There are few things i like to say about currying, and your comment.

*         *         *

I don't like the term “currying”. It smacks of academic mumbo jumbo.
The primary fuel of its use among programers, is its obscurism. It
makes the users of the term looks bigger then than they are. (not
accusing you in anyway though)

As you know, there's the concept of of turning a function with
multiple parameters into a function with fewer parameters. This
concept as a theory, and in particular as a actual implementation of
it in a computer language as a feature, needs a name. And, the term
“currying” has been adopted. (the particular reason for the word, as
we know, is from the mathematician Haskell Curry)

If we were to make a general judgement on the naming of scientific/
technical concepts (as a criticism about terminology), then, i think
terms based on people's names are not to be preferred. (primarily
because it imparts no information about what it means, secondarily
because often it has nothing to do with the person (i.e. the named is
often not the primary contributor of the theory/concept although it
many cases it is meant to be and is)) Further, i nomenclature has
critical importance, in education, effciency of communication, and in
how something is perceived.

(Richard Stallman has popularly made this point clear for non-
scientific terms, mostly regarding Linux and his ideologoy about
software in society (e.g. GNU/Linux, “Intellectual Property”, “Content
Management System”/“Website Revision System”, “digital right
management”/“ digital restrictions management” ... etc. (however,
himself, in my opinion, have hijacked terms intentionally or
unintentionally for his gain (e.g. Free, Hacker (anyone who is gonna
write to me about the terms “Free” or “Hacker” automatically gets a
moronic tech geeker moniker in my mind, unless, you have a Ph D in
English or philosophy or human animal ethology or history or similar
fields)))))

*         *         *

Now, in the above, i expressed a few things:

• What Currying means.
• It justification in having a name.
• I do not like this terminology.
• some opinions about terminology

But actually, i wanted to speak about another issue, and that is: how
the term Currying is often used by high-powered tech geekers (such as
the lispers and functional programers) to simply mean applying a
function that is returned by a function, and this subtle but different
meaning, generates confusion.

For example, in the following:

((f a) b)  Lisp
f[a][b]    Mathematica
f a b      ML

Are they Currying? or are they just applying a return value of a
function?

The significance of the term “currying”, usually lies in the context
of language design in particular that the language is such that its
compiler can break apart a function of multiple parameters into a
function with less.

So, in Mathematica, form like this f[a][b] isn't “currying” in anyway.
It simply means applying the value of f[a] to b.

Similarly, i do not think currying makes any sense in lisp. (i know
Emacs Lisp and have familiar with literature of scheme)

*         *         *

In Mathematica, forms like f[a][b] or f[a1,a2,...][b1,b2,...]... etc
are actually used a lot in Mathematica. Both in build-in functions as
well as in third-party products. Most notable example is the function
named “Derivative”. As a idiom, it is used in just about every
sufficiently complex and well-designed third-party programs. It is
probably in all Mathematic programing books.

Such a form can be defined using pattern matching.
So for example,

f[a_][b_] := a+b;

In this case, f[x] won't even be defined.

However, often, f is considered as a function that returns a function.
So, f[x] returns the function that adds a to it, i.e. in lisp: (lambda
(x) (+ a x)). In this case, f can be defined using pattern matching,
or not using pattern matching. Example:

f[x_]:= a+x;            (*using pattern matching*)

f=Function[x,a+x]        (*without using pattern matching*)

In all 3 cases above, f[a][b] evaluates to a+b.

In the over one thousand pages of the Mathematica Book (its official
manual), covering hundreds of advanced math functions and
computations, one will find no menitioning of Currying or its concept
whatsoever. (and this is in supreme contrast to the common programer
and academics obfuscation and elitism of throwing out lambdas,
currying, liiinda-meryer types, garbage collection, tail-recursion,
and other shit.)

*         *         *

(Note in wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying
it defines currying as:
«In computer science, currying or Schönfinkelisation[1] is the
technique of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments
into a function that takes a single argument (the other arguments
having been specified by the curry).»
Note how it says it is a “technique”.
)

(Note: I'm not familiar with Mathematica 6, which is a major release
made few months ago that contains fundamentally new features. All the
statements about Mathematica above applies to version 4 or before 6.)

You have a point in that this is incorrect. Currying, named after
Haskell Curry, has to do with transforming a function of N arguments
into a function of N-K arguments, by fixing the values of K arguments.

What the above describes is something else. But I don't think that

... just to have some fun, let me make a assertion (fun aside, i
seriously think it true):

The Haskell community, would benefit greatly (say, as tripling its
popularity or number of users), by forbidding literature associated
with its teaching, of using the term Currying.

This is something that can be done, and in my opinion, trivially.
However, of course it will never happens because haskell is too much
tied to academics and social and human issues regarding terminology or
the use of English, is not likely to change...

As to what would be better term for Currying... umm... perhaps Arity
Shrink, Arity Collapsing, parameter reduction ...

Technically that would be easy, but politically, it's impossible to ban
certain words. To establish a working ban, you'd need a censoring
machinery, and the side effects would eclipse any good that this could

All you can do is to propose a less intimidating nomenclature.

No, it won't happen because censoring free speech doesn't work. Such a
mechanism would immediately attract those who didn't achieve greatness
and saw a post in a censoring office as a way to achieve a position of

When cooking a curry, you need a bunch of ingredients. You throw some
stuff into the pot.  You now have something that when you add
more ingredients, makes more a more complicated/closer-to-complete
curry.  You can separate making a curry into a whole heap of
add-a-thing-to-the-pot operations.

Okay that's pretty loose, and if anything probably encourages
currying/partial-application confusion, but still, the name
&quot;curry&quot; always appealed to me for that reason.

umm... that seems unfortunate. I think things like this, effectively
functions like a damnation on the language's reach.

It is not surpring, since Haskell is made by academics, who have
little contact and understanding of the real, daily, average
programers in the computer industry. (and Haskell wasn't intented that
it might be a language for general industrial use)

Similar problem cripples the Schemers. Personally for me, it was sad.
When at the dot-com era (~1998), new langs and techs like Java, perl,
cgi, javascript, css, html 3!, VRML! ...etc are seething with a bright
utopian future.  At the time, Python is very little known. (like a
niche little thing nobody knows or cares) And, whenever Python is
mentioned, Scheme is often also mentioned, and tcl as well, for
comparisons and potentials. (i read most of SICP and most of R5RS in
1998)

Now, it's almost a decade later. Python has grown and risen into the
limelight, and is used by many major corporations. Perl is still not
dying. CGI has faded, VRML dead. Javascript stands firm. Java got
pressed into OpenSource by Microsoft (sounds like Netscape to me, and
i do hope Java and Sun Microsystems die a painful, miserable, DEATH).
Pretty Home Page, technically a extremely badly designed, weak, Perl-
based language (was just Perl scripts), has risen and surpassing perl
to become a pillar language in today's world. And then, there's still
Scheme, the same old fucking Scheme, with it's cons and lambdas and
tail-recursions and continuations motherfucking fuck nobody knows
about and nobody gives a hot damn.

Who to blame? I blame the Schemers. Not because their language being
technically lacking (quite the contrary), nor because they lack mature
tools or compilers or libraries. (There is scsh, which by itself
already sufficiently surpasses the most advanced or popular shells
such as Bash and the entire unix tool bags that are pervasively used
in the industry, and scsh has been around for long). if Scheme lacks,
then tcl, python, php, ruby all lacks and some starts at 0 while
scheme is some 30+ years old of experience) But primarily, due to the
Schemers themselves with their academic drivels. Fuck Schemers.

(and consider the baby Ruby (Oh my god another language with nothing
new), which is rising like a star today)

See also:
Computer Language Popularity Trend
http://xahlee.org/lang_traf/index.html

*       *       *

The above thoughts gave me a insight. That is, a language's wide
adoption in the industry has a lot to do with the original purpose of
the language and the community it is associated with. So, Scheme,
Haskell, i dont think will be widely adopted in foreseeable future.
While Ruby, considered as a computer language, really offers nothing
new, but due to its origin, will likely grow with far more users and
libraries then Scheme or Haskell.

Likewise, consider Common Lisp. Considered with respect to computer
science, really is inferior to Scheme or Haskell in many ways, but
will nevertheless be more popular, given its industrial background.
(and as we know, in fact has garnered a lot publicity and users in
recent years) (in the same way, consider emacs lisp, probably has been
quietly far more popular than Common Lisp throughout their existance,
despite the fact that consider as pure computer languages, elisp lacks
many language features as well as libraries when compared to CL)

... not sure how this thoguht applies to erlang, Ocamel, f#. It would
suggest that these, with their industrial background, will become more
popular than Haskell. (if not already a fact)

... to recapitulate this thought: that a lang's primary concern and
primary community dictates what new users will be using the lang. So
Scheme, Haskell, have focuses on elegance and computer science
research, and thus, that's what they will be. Common Lisp, Ruby, f#
has focuses on practical industrial use, all things considered, thus
that's how they will be.

*       *       *

...now back to the discussions on terminology...

Does Microsoft's f#'s literature uses jargons?

That would be interesting to see, if Microsoft, in its functional lang
f#'s documentation (or naming of things in the lang), takes care to
not only avoiding uncessary use of jargons, but whether they also take
steps to replace computer-science jargons by more practicality
oriented terms.

Most words are little used.  Nevertheless, I find the estimate of
250,000 words used to be on the high side.  I've read that the average
person has a working vocabulary of only 2000-3000 words and a passive
vocabulary (words they know but don't often use) of 15000-20000 words.

The unabridged OED set in my local large library comprises 17 volumes
and claims definitions for some 950,000+ words.  There is a companion
Oxford slang dictionary which comprises 20 volumes and claims
definitions for 1.1 million words (there is necessarily some overlap).

I would guess the estimate at askoxford is for the &quot;normal&quot; dictionary
which purports to deal only with words actively in use.

<POSTDATE> 2007-08-20T06:58:00 </POSTDATE>
Dear moron Ingo Menger,

In this thread, i posit some thoughts. One of which, is about how the
naming of technical concepts, would be better served, by choosing a
name that conveys's the meaning, instead of simply by the scientist's
name.  (e.g. Cartesian coordinate, Abelian group, Fourier transform,
Mobius transformation, Green's theorem, Schwartzian transform,
Reidemeister move, Euclidean geometry, Hilbert space, ..., and of
course, Currying.)

Here's the complete excerpt of my message on the part where i
expressed this opinion:

«
I don't like the term “currying”. It smacks of academic mumbo jumbo.
The primary fuel of its use among programers, is its obscurism. It
makes the users of the term looks bigger then than they are. (not
accusing you in anyway though)

As you know, there's the concept of of turning a function with
multiple parameters into a function with fewer parameters. This
concept as a theory, and in particular as a actual implementation of
it in a computer language as a feature, needs a name. And, the term
“currying” has been adopted. (the particular reason for the word, as
we know, is from the mathematician Haskell Curry)

If we were to make a general judgement on the naming of scientific/
technical concepts (as a criticism about terminology), then, i think
terms based on people's names are not to be preferred. (primarily
because it imparts no information about what it means, secondarily
because often it has nothing to do with the person (i.e. the named is
often not the primary contributor of the theory/concept although it
many cases it is meant to be and is)) Further, i nomenclature has
critical importance, in education, efficiency of communication, and in
how something is perceived.

(Richard Stallman has popularly made this point clear for non-
scientific terms, mostly regarding Linux and his ideology about
software in society (e.g. GNU/Linux, “Intellectual Property”, “Content
Management System”/“Website Revision System”, “digital right
management”/“ digital restrictions management” ... etc. (however,
himself, in my opinion, have hijacked terms intentionally or
unintentionally for his gain (e.g. Free, Hacker (anyone who is gonna
write to me about the terms “Free” or “Hacker” automatically gets a
moronic tech geeker moniker in my mind, unless, you have a Ph D in
English or philosophy or human animal ethology or history or similar
fields))))) »

Now, one of the first response to this message, is a mockery, arguing
that my opinion is unfounded. I quote below:

“David Formosa (aka ? the Platypus)” wrote:

propose we ban the use of the word &quot;curry&quot; and propose that we as an
alternative use the phrase &quot;spicy Indian style sauce&quot;.

Also I think that the terminology around the naming of spades is over
complex (meany people get spades and shovals confused for example).  I
propose an OO naming soultion of tool.dig.manual.pointed
»

This person, judged on this response, i deem a moron. However, there
are so many moronic newsgroup posts, that i could not possible reply
to each.

Now, it is to my displeasure, that 3 responses followed this mockery.
They are all one-liner responses, 2 of which kinda furthered the pun
silliness in a meaningless way. The 3rd response is from Moron Ingo
Menger. In this guy's one-liner states: “You hit the nail on its
head.”. In a unambiguous way, it indicated that the Platypus's mockery
is right on, implying my opinion stupid.

I would like to do some explanation to these morons, whoever you are,
because in my educational experience, i learned that, in order to
teach something, doesn't matter how obvious it is to me, i need to be
clear, precise, and very DETAILED, giving full examples, supports,
references. Essentially, the degree of effectiveness of teaching by
writing, is almost asymptotic to writing a book. If i write sloppily,
in a blog, then it will have effect just like that. But if i take the
time (tremendous time), to formulate it, use proper writing styles,
edit it, give detailed explanations, examples, gather references,
format the text properly, and so on, like a formal publication, then
as such, it makes a much larger impact on the readers. In short, i
could not assume a very learned audience that have special knowledge
in the areas of my topic. Of course, those who do, will find my
opinion considerable, and the informal and short presentation
sufficient for presenting a opinion, but the vast majority of
newsgroup readers (say, 95%), will respond by drivel.

«surprise to myself! how did i already wrote so much and getting off
tangent!! and becoming a general treatise and yet not started to
explain the main subject of this message yet! Fuck Jesus!»

Ok, now back to terminology. Here, i explain briefly, the inanity of
the mockery.

I will now take some reasonable assumptions about the mockery, since
it is short, and one cannot accurately infer what's the author's real
meanings.  The basis of the mockery is that, there are many words used
in natural languages that are fucked up in one way or another that has
little connection to what the word means. The above sentence is
probably nonsensical, but stupid writing forces one to give
nonsensical interpretations. Alternatively, perhaps the mockery
writer's intention was that, it is hopeless to change the established
scientific jargons, or the establishment, or its habits... This would
be a valid opinion, albeit mundane. If the mocker do mean this line of
thought, he failed to embedded it.

Ummm... looks like i wasted 1 hour. Fucking newsgroup morons rob my
time.

According to an insight of the famous Mr Lee,

&quot;Fun aside, i seriously think it true:

The thai restaurant community, would benefit greatly (say, as
tripling its business volume or number of eaters), by forbidding
menus or advertisement, of using the term 'Curry'

This is something that can be done, and in my opinion, trivially.
However, of course it will never happens because thai cuisine is
too much tied to gastronomy and social and human issues regarding
terminology or the use of English, is not likely to change...

As to what would be better term for Curry ... umm... perhaps spicy
Indian or Thai style sauce, eater reduction sauce or tastebuds
collapsing sauce ...&quot;

(BTW: If I remember right, &quot;curry&quot; is not the sauce, but the dish.)

Shakespeare is reputed to have _made_up_ 20000 of the words that he used.

The point that Xah is missing is that words are just symbols for concepts,
and they mean precicely what their authors intend them to mean.  There is
very seldom any or much significance in the form of the symbol itself.
Certainly, one can write a little story, using more common words, every
time you wish to convey a concept, but that may well be *less* accurate
and meaninful than just using the word/symbol that has been accepted to
correspond to the concept.  So you encounter words that you haven't seen
before, or haven't seen used in a particular context before: that's what
context, dictionaries and the literature are for.

But of course you all already knew that.  Please pardon the rant.

At least I've wasted less than the hour that Xah spent on his drivel, on

Perhaps you should consider the possability that just because people
disagree with you they are not morons.

You have to understand your audience.  Just as someone posting to this
newsgroup can assume that thouse reading this newsgroups will have a
familuarity with the ideas of functional programing.

I've been reading your posts for quite a while on this newsgroups and

Again this is a mattor of understanding your audience.  I expected
(quite reasonably it turns out) that thouse reading what I wrote would
get my points.

One of the things I was trying to express was that the naming of
concepts is to some degree arbitrary.  We name things so that the name
is smaller then the concept that it points at, this allows us to
compress language and communicate already established ideas.  Because
of this we can't embed the meaning of the word inside the word itself.

Anyone who is trying to express the currying idea is going to be
exposed to it via teaching.  They will get the concept and the name at
the same time.  I haven't seen anyone have difficulty with the concept
of currying due to its name, I've seen people have difficulty with the
concept of currying because of it requires a high order functional
form of thought that a imperative mindset gets in the way of.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Alternatively, perhaps the mockery
&gt; writer's intention was that, it is hopeless to change the established

To communicate you need to use the same words as the person your
communicating with.  If you use diffrent words then you limit your
audience.  If you established an alternative term for currying then
thouse people who used your term would be at a loss to the majority
who stuck with the use of the word.

&gt; Dear moron Ingo Menger,

&gt; In this thread, i posit some thoughts. One of which, is about how the

And here is the first error in your thought.
Or please, can you tell me how the name &quot;oven&quot; conveys the meaning of
an artifact made of stone or iron, that serves to heat a room or to
cook food or both?
The truth is that most words do not convey any meaning before the
meaning has been learned.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

This, indeed, is a sufficient reason for using it even more, I'd
think. Insofar, your postings are quite valuable: One almost cannot go
wrong by doing just the opposite of what you were suggesting.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Your anti-academic attitude is so poor and ludicrous, I am not going

You think so. Ok. And other people don't think so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

This is not an argument, since this holds for almost every word.
Besides, more often than not, a particular person is well known for
one single, outstanding contribution to a field of science or
technology, so everybody not absolutely unfamiliar with that field
knows very well what the meaning is.
Sometimes, this goes so far that it is no longer well known that the
word is actually a name.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

So what? It suffices that people associated the concept or whatever
with his name for whatever reason.

No. The basis is that a word per se does not mean anything. If this
were not so, everybody could read and understand a russian newspaper.
But, alas, only those that have learned what the russian words are
meant to mean are able to do so.
There is, for example, the word &quot;da&quot;. Intepreted as a russian word, it
means &quot;yes&quot;. Interpreted as german word, it means &quot;there&quot;. Interpreted
italian, it means &quot;from&quot;. What now is THE meaning of &quot;da&quot;? Or do you
prefer to speak of 3 (and more) different &quot;da&quot; words? But what, then,
would be a word anyway? The same as it's meaning? In that case, you're
claims were clearly self-contradicting, for, if &quot;currying&quot; is the same
as &quot;the meaning of 'currying'&quot; then how can you claim that &quot;currying&quot;
does not convey it's meaning?

I might be a coincidence, but Xah Lee's article is clearly
confucianistic. One basic idea of confucianism is that social disorder
and confusion stems from the failure to call things by their proper
names.

Compare, for example:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism#Rectification_of_Names

&quot;Xun Zi chapter (22) &quot;On the Rectification of Names&quot; claims the
ancient sage kings chose names (ming 名 &quot;name; appellation; term&quot;) that
directly corresponded with actualities (shi 實 &quot;fact; real; true;
actual&quot;), but later generations confused terminology, coined new
nomenclature, and thus could no longer distinguish right from wrong.&quot;

And the human brain is really good in that: I mean, if human brains
can do anything good, it's associating. E.g. if I'd coin the term
Xahism for a specific firgure of spech or Xahdom for a certain kind of
behaviour, I'm quite sure, a huge number of people would (almost)
_exactly_ know what I mean. Abso-f*cking-lutely am-azing. :-)
