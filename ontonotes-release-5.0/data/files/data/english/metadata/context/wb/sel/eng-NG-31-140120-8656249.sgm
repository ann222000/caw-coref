after some bruatal ragging of messenger the last few games, he comes in with
men on second and third no outs, and gets the side out without a run.  The
guys in here are good.  Now its time to rag Zito, even though he was a bit
of a victim of the squeeze, and his counterpart Davis was not, he still
sucked.  And, he developed back into his K. Reuter syndrome of being afraid
to throw strikes.  Sometimes his pitch selection is questionable.  Both
pitch and location, I don't know what he and Bengie are thinking.   This is
one of those games that Zito's team scored 4 runs, and he had the lead, that
he will not be getting the win, and could be tagged with a loss.
