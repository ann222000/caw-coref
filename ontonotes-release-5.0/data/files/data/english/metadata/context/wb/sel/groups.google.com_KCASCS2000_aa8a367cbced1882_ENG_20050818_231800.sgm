world by 2050.&quot;
Alec Jones

Mr. Philip McDonagh
Irish Ambassador to India

people, not its ability to put them into seats - it's the skill level
that exists here.&quot;

&quot;I see a big change in corporate India. Indian companies which earlier
enjoyed protected markets, have adapted well to the opening up of the
economy. India is a classic example. I am impressed by how well Indian
companies have moved from a management style rooted in a protected
environment to a management style which is exploiting global
competitiveness.&quot;

&quot;By 2020, 47% of Indians will be between 15 and 59, compared with 35%

workers and consumers. That's a big reason why Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. (GS
) thinks India will be able to sustain 7.5% annual growth after 2005.&quot;
Business Week Magazine (Cover Story, December 8, 2003)

&quot;As a nation you have great DNA. This advantage will have a multiplier
effect on the economy when second generation policy reforms present

growing middle class consumers&quot;
Harris N Miller
President
Information Technology Association of America

&quot;India has natural and multiple advantages over countries like China or
other Asian or Latin American countries that are emerging as

advantageous position.&quot;
