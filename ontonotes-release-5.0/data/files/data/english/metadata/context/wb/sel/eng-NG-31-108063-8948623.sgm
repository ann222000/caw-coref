How do you break up your leaves for your leaf mold pile. Just wondering
since fall is coming and I want to get a good pile started.

I don't have a chipper or anything to break them up however, so I
thought I'd ask you all what you do to prep new leaves.

Or, just toss 'em on a pile and let 'em soak down with each rain, mixing
now and then.. ;)

So, do tell! :)

I just toss them (mostly pecan leaves) in a welded wire fence enclosure,
make a slurry of alfalfa meal (50 lb. sack from a feed store lasts a long
time) in a 5 gallon bucket, and pour that in the middle. Cover with more
leaves and hose it down. Keep adding leaves until the neighbours stop
putting out the sacks. I may fork it a little now and then to add more
slurry, but I don't bother turning it anymore and just let it set longer.

Take it that works better than fresh grass clippings, then.. I may try
that at some time.. Thanks! :)

We've got a HUGE pecan tree on the property, plus an oak, 2 elms, 3
chestnut.. Quite a bit to make use of..

Minus the black walnut which I can't use for anything. :|

&gt; I know.....the damn things are hell on garden areas as well.   The
&gt; hulls are a staining nightmare on everything.  Isn't it great when the
&gt; squirrels start in on them and drop hull pieces on your vehicle and
&gt; stain the hell out of the finish?

&gt; Most people don't care for the nuts either.

Haven't had the pleasure of that yet since we just moved in.. However it
reminds me of when I was living in PA. Had black berries growing wild as
well as a huge mulberry tree.. Needless to say when they were ripe, they
poop purple...

Odd color to smear across your window with the wiper blades..

So how do you hull your nuts? I'd heard of people using old corn hullers
on them..

It gets the pile smokin'....... I usually cover it in black plastic to
retain moisture and heat. The steam shoots out small holes on cool mornings.
I generally take a couple of scoops from a plastic pitcher per bucket
and let it soak for a few minutes. I used to use rabbit food pellets, until
I realized how cheap a 50 lb. bag was.

Oh yeah. And, especially when there are no fresh clippings and tons of
leaves. I've also used alfalfa meal and alfalfa tea to fertilize pecans in
the Spring. Great source of nitrogen, trace minerals and growth stimulants.

I just toss the leaves on a pile.  It's in an out-of-the-way corner
where a block wall makes a turn.  Every so often (not often enough), I
wet it down.  Every so often (again not often enough), I use a spading
fork to turn it over.  In the fall, I pull the pile apart, put fresh
leaves at the bottom, and rebuild the pile with the old leaves and
partially decomposed matter on top.

This is indeed mostly leaf mold.  It's about 95% dead leaves and 5%
grass clippings.  The clippings are from my red fescue lawn, which is
mowed only once or twice a year.  The leaves are oak, liquidambar,
zelkova, and ash.

I'd just pile them up.   A chicken wire ring will help contain them.
It is true that putting leaves through a shredder will speed up the
decomposition process, but this is not necessary.   You can mix in
some green (grass clippings, etc) to add some nitrogen.

There is no need to shred the leaves unless you need to hurry nature.
There is no need to add nitrogen unless you need to hurry nature.
A pile large enough to insulate itself will heat and begin to break
down all on it's own.

If you want to hurry or use the leaves as mulch and don't want them to
mat down, run them over with a mower a time or two. A wall or plank
for a backstop helps.

Whoo boy..... It was only last Spring that someone here said that I

bacteria, or worms particularly care about the words we humans use to
describe decaying organic matter, or the plants care about what specific
methods we use to create it.
My potted tomatoes enjoyed growing in it, and my bedding plants have
enjoyed having it layered on top, a la lasagna gardening.
And, don't tell symplastless, but the pecan tree grove I tend at a local
park has thrived and has a bountiful crop this year, whether I spread
composted tree mulch, or fresh wood chips.
Spread it on the ground, pile it up, add stuff or not....... Just don't
bag it up and throw it away. It's all good.

Sound advice!  Would add the less energy we put in the better.  May
not be real fast but time is not the issue preserving  organic matter
is.  I value anything that was once alive.  Anything that passed thru a
living organism better.  That may make it easier for plants to recycle
again to us.

The opine that I'm working with is that loosening the soil in the manner
you described would damage the hallways the worms have built (reducing
aeration of the soil and damage the mycelium of fungi in the garden
beds. Both are important for the ecology of the bed. If your beds aren't
raised, you may want to consider stepping stones to spread out the
pressure from foot steps and reduce compaction. I'm trying to grow
clover between the stones.

My current plan is to lay down newsprint or card board on the garden as
it shuts down and then spread mulch on top of that. Maybe I'll add some
bone meal and phosphate as well.

How long is it till March?

I won't pretend to have an answer here. But, I noticed that after a few
years of incorporating soil ammendments with a fork, it always seemed to
revert to the same come Spring. Sandy loam that's fine when damp and rock
hard when dry. I figured the plants roots would best adjust to homogenous
soil, rather than a top layer of potting mix and then hit normal soil. Billy
said it best that perhaps it's doing more damage to the soil strata, that
then has to recover.

Yeah, it pained me that I might be trashing the worms environment. I
stopped using Miracle Gro when I noticed that the worms seemed to seek
refuge around a plants roots, away from the chemical bath I was giving them.
I rarely even water the beds anymore. Some things do better than others,
and the ones that don't are not meant to be. I have some day lillies in the
front beds that rarely bloom, next to the hippeastrum that bloom and
reproduce like rabbits. The transplanted day lillies in the back that I
really neglect bloom nicely.

I kinda came to my own conclusions, but it most definitely parallels the
Stout Method. Mostly because I was disinterested in the digging, and in the
two houses I've lived in, I inherited long neglected beds. So, I'd throw
some mulch on top and see what came up the next year. I couldn't really
wreck it all by digging it up, and after planting a few extra things, it
became impractical to do so.

And your discussions here have re-directed my interest in growing
something edible, rather than ornamental. Actually both, as next year I'm
going to rip out the shrubs along the street and plant peppers. Anyone who
wants to pick them as they walk by are welcome. And maybe peas and beans,
instead of wisteria on the trellises and fence. Front yard food......

I like them all but I also like to see them transform or go.  Early Dec
snow is wonderful but about April it is time to see new life.   Summer
heat and swimming a joy but dry crisp fall becomes desirable.  In a way
what we have we like but soon tire of it and want change perhaps.
This with the knowledge that San Francisco or Mykonos  are alluring.
My son was at  a house on Mykonos last week. . Photos are beautiful with
sea and sky but plant life is rare.  I'd say desolate.  But some folks
say plant life and others say plant material.
New growth in the spring and  who does not think a little bit of Druid
lies in one's heart.  Now where is that mistletoe we found ?  Dark sky
can be forboding  or a promise of rain.

I've been reading this thread with great interest, in particular the part
about alfalfa meal for the compost pile (embarrassed to say I've never heard
of this one,
and I was a nursery manager/buyer for 12 years in D.C.)

Question:  are those of you who don't dig the soil or add materials
referring solely to edible plants/annuals/very tough perennials? Wouldn't
you dig the soil well and add
organic matter for shrubs, trees, and perennials, especially those which
require excellent drainage?

&gt;    Do you mean Mykonos Greece?  Greece and its islands have probably the

&gt; season. People travel there in spring  to see the fantastic natural
&gt; carpets of  brilliantly coloured bulbs and annual wildflowers that erupt
&gt; from stony ground after the winter wet; it looks just like some medieval
&gt; painting of Paradise with cyclamen, poppies, cistus, daisies, crocus,
&gt; scillas. Everything goes quickly to seed as summer arrives then all the
&gt; foliage burns off and disappears again.

&gt;  Just a tiny glimpse of it here

Require excellent drainage is not something we speak of about here in
sandy loam country.  I guess if you want excellent drainage or acidic
soil you must apply sand and acid creating amenities.  I use oak leaves
which are about big time.  Seems you may want to plant something that
would not live there unless you apply help or energy.  Your additions
are added expense but going cheap has it virtues.

Bill whose brother is a nursery manager too for about 30 years.  We
differ on plant life philosophy.  I favor my Dad and  that English guy
long gone.

Any way here is a video.

&gt;&gt;   Why do all the work that worms will do for free? I keep topping up a
&gt;&gt; deep layer of soft  mulch material  on the soil surface (grass
&gt;&gt; clippings, leaves, wood ash, seaweed,  herbage such as comfrey, nettles,
&gt;&gt; bracken, home made compost), which attracts a huge breeding population
&gt;&gt; of worms to feed on the decaying material.. The worms make soil tunnels
&gt;&gt; (which  let in air and water and nutrients), and  excrete perfect
&gt;&gt; fertiliser all through the soil. Birds looking for the worms, constantly
&gt;&gt; scratch and turn over the mulch, breaking it down even faster and
&gt;&gt; gobbling up all sorts of slugs and bugs they find.

&gt;&gt; The superiority of the natural, undisturbed soil structure this creates,
&gt;&gt; is demonstrated by the amazing growth rate of plants  (without any
&gt;&gt; chemical fertilisers at all).

&gt; Well, I'm convinced... and pleased that less work appears to be another
&gt; benefit.  Even what I have been doing has had great results; less
&gt; weeds, increased production, increased plant population (which results
&gt; in cooler soil temps and a living mulch canopy) and very few bad bugs.
&gt; I am looking forward to this.  This sounds like it could easily be
&gt; implemented on a large scale.
