Your idea of Massive Response consists of flooding this group with your
hyper whining. Are you going to quit now?
You are sounding just like a bitchy little 12 year old girl who is
experiencing her first menstrual cycle along with her first ever case of
PMS. Gawd. I hope Gavi changed your tampon, Mark. You should have shoved one
in your mouth, too.

You pissy little bitch.

Cough up, Rog.  Please post anything at all which confirms your
ridiculous claim.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The term is "Megalomaniac" but you still used it incorrectly, Rog.  If
you use "delusional" you'd have to use "megalomaniacal"  Be that as it
may, I submit that in your deranged state, you are incapable of judging
whether another is impaired.  In other words, it'll take a trip to Terra
Alta for repairs before you can make a sound judgment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I told you that you're incapable of making judgment.  Nothing I've
written to or about Mark begins to compare to your statements behind
what you think is the anonymity of a sock puppet.

You're getting mixed up again.  I keep telling *you* that.

No, I meant that I've never received a warning letter or notice of
violation from any regulating body.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Or that

To be "caught", I'd had to have been breaking the regulations I operated
under.  That didn't happen.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I've never run into another person who had to retest.

He passed?  Yes, *you* passed.

You've received two letters and were forced to retest.  What do you
think will happen the next time you have a run-in with or deliberately
QRM someone on the air, UnWiseman.  Do you think you'll receive a third
warning letter and have to retest yet again?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You have to know better than that, Rog.  I could make ten telephone
calls and come up with ten signatures for a nominating position.

Do you know some puppies and kittens with amateur radio license, Nutball?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There's no one from Cameron, West Virginia filling usenet with tales of
sex between humans and animals, fathers and sons, fathers and daughters,
or mothers and sons.  Glen Dale seems to have a problem over on Glen Haven.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Where they actually do have sex with animals.
">

Could you phrase your comment in the form of a sentence?
Where does one go to research such a thing, UnWiseman.  It doesn't
appear in the local paper.  You seem to be the expert on such things.
How do you find out?

Maybe that's why you chose to live there.

I hadn't heard of it until you mentioned it.  I'll concede that you're
the expert in that particular and peculiar field.
