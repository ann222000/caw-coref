&quot;Innocent men don't talk in code&quot;
a.. NEW: Chicago's biggest mob trial in years soon will be in jury's hands

b.. Prosecutor tells jurors not to be afraid of star witness

c.. Defense says witness lied before and he's lying now

d.. Five reputed mobsters face life in prison if convicted
CHICAGO, Illinois (AP) -- Men who have nothing to hide don't talk in heavy code,
prosecutors say.

Such men don't urge jail visitors to conceal their mouths, for fear of
surveillance cameras and lip readers. And they don't pay $240,000 in hush money
to an admitted hit man.

Those were the arguments made by a federal prosecutor Wednesday as he told
jurors that Chicago's biggest mob trial in years rests on more than the
testimony of that admitted hit-man, Nicholas Calabrese.

&quot;Nicholas Calabrese is not on trial in this case, and he will be held
accountable,&quot; the trial's lead prosecutor, Mitchell Mars, said after defense
attorneys tried to destroy the credibility of the government's star witness
during closing arguments.

The five men on trial are accused in a racketeering conspiracy that allegedly
includes 18 unsolved murders, illegal gambling, loan sharking and extortion tied
to the Outfit, as Chicago's organized crime family is known.

They are reputed mobster Joseph &quot;Joey the Clown&quot; Lombardo, 78; convicted jewel
thief Paul Schiro, 70; reputed mob boss James Marcello, 65; retired Chicago
policeman Anthony Doyle, 62; and convicted loan shark Frank Calabrese Sr., who
is the brother of Nicholas Calabrese.

Nicholas Calabrese agreed to spill mob secrets to avoid the death penalty after
his DNA was matched to blood on a glove at a 1986 murder scene.

During the trial, he told jurors he took part in about a dozen of the murders in
the indictment and provided details of other killings that he said he learned
from other people, at least one of whom he later killed.

Prosecutors were expected to finish delivering the rebuttal portion of their
closing arguments on Thursday, followed by jury instructions.

Although defense attorneys delivered their closing arguments separately for each
defendant, they had one common message: Nicholas Calabrese has admitted lying to
authorities in the past and cannot be trusted.

Joseph Lopez, representing Frank Calabrese Sr., called his client's brother &quot;a
walking piece of deception&quot; and a &quot;grim reaper.&quot;

Schiro attorney Paul Wagner called him a &quot;stone-cold killer&quot; who had forfeited
his right to live in a decent society.

And Marc Martin, representing Marcello, told jurors if Nicholas Calabrese said
it was raining, they should check for themselves.

Several defense attorneys suggested Nicholas Calabrese had sprinkled their
clients' names into his stories to please federal prosecutors and earn a lighter
sentence. Wagner said Calabrese is trying to avoid leaving prison in a box
headed to the cemetery.

But Mars told jurors that Nicholas Calabrese's sentence will be up to a judge
and that he could still spend the rest of his life in prison.

Mars also tried to refresh in the jurors' memories how Marcello and Frank
Calabrese Sr. used heavily coded language while communicating in prison, and how
Marcello told his visiting brother to cover his mouth while talking.

Nicholas Calabrese was paid $240,000 in $4,000 installments over five years by
Marcello, Mars said, citing a witness who said he was the delivery man. The
money was paid because Outfit leaders were worried Nicholas Calabrese was about
to start talking to the feds, the prosecutor said.

&quot;You don't give money to someone to keep them from telling a lie,&quot; Mars said.
&quot;You pay money to someone -- hush money, bribe money -- to keep them from
telling the truth.&quot;

I think we can all agree with the prosecutors here.

If someone isn't guilty, why would they object to letting the
government keep records of every aspect of their life.  Search
warrants shouldn't be needed because if you've got nothing to hide
they why would you object to a police search of your house and
papers.  Same goes for phone conversations and even more so on the the
Internet. Coded secure links should be banned at once. I repeat. If
you are innocent, why do you need to hide your Internet
communications? Why should you keep ANY secrets?  This case sums it
up. &quot;Innocent men don't talk in code!&quot;

In the US, all new cellphones must conform to the FCC's &quot;E911&quot;
requirements for providing accurate location information during
emergency calls. Most providers are doing this by requiring all new
phones to have GPS receivers onboard and to report their location
during 911 calls.

For example, Verizon Wireless says:

&quot;As part of our compliance with FCC requirements, Verizon Wireless
allows only GPS-compliant devices to be activated on our network.&quot;

Point, Click. Eavesdrop: How the FBI Wiretap Net Operates
By Wired.
The FBI has quietly built a sophisticated, point-and-click surveillance system
that performs instant wiretaps on almost any communications device, according to
nearly a thousand pages of restricted documents newly released under the Freedom
of Information Act.

The surveillance system, called DCSNet, for Digital Collection System Network,
connects FBI wiretapping rooms to switches controlled by traditional land-line
operators, internet-telephony providers and cellular companies. It is far more
intricately woven into the nation's telecom infrastructure than observers
suspected.

It's a &quot;comprehensive wiretap system that intercepts wire-line phones, cellular
phones, SMS and push-to-talk systems,&quot; says Steven Bellovin, a Columbia
University computer science professor and longtime surveillance expert.

DCSNet is a suite of software that collects, sifts and stores phone numbers,
phone calls and text messages. The system directly connects FBI wiretapping
outposts around the country to a far-reaching private communications network.

Many of the details of the system and its full capabilities were redacted from
the documents acquired by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, but they show that
DCSNet includes at least three collection components, each running on
Windows-based computers.

The $10 million DCS-3000 client, also known as Red Hook, handles pen-registers
and trap-and-traces, a type of surveillance that collects signaling
information - primarily the numbers dialed from a telephone - but no
communications content. (Pen registers record outgoing calls; trap-and-traces
record incoming calls.)

DCS-6000, known as Digital Storm, captures and collects the content of phone
calls and text messages for full wiretap orders.

A third, classified system, called DCS-5000, is used for wiretaps targeting
spies or terrorists.

What DCSNet Can Do
Together, the surveillance systems let FBI agents play back recordings even as
they are being captured (like TiVo), create master wiretap files, send digital
recordings to translators, track the rough location of targets in real time
using cell-tower information, and even stream intercepts outward to mobile
surveillance vans.

FBI wiretapping rooms in field offices and undercover locations around the
country are connected through a private, encrypted backbone that is separated
from the internet. Sprint runs it on the government's behalf.

The network allows an FBI agent in New York, for example, to remotely set up a
wiretap on a cell phone based in Sacramento, California, and immediately learn
the phone's location, then begin receiving conversations, text messages and
voicemail pass codes in New York. With a few keystrokes, the agent can route the
recordings to language specialists for translation.

The numbers dialed are automatically sent to FBI analysts trained to interpret
phone-call patterns, and are transferred nightly, by external storage devices,
to the bureau's Telephone Application Database, where they're subjected to a
type of data mining called link analysis.

FBI endpoints on DCSNet have swelled over the years, from 20 &quot;central monitoring
plants&quot; at the program's inception, to 57 in 2005, according to undated pages in
the released documents. By 2002, those endpoints connected to more than 350
switches.

Today, most carriers maintain their own central hub, called a &quot;mediation
switch,&quot; that's networked to all the individual switches owned by that carrier,
according to the FBI. The FBI's DCS software links to those mediation switches
over the internet, likely using an encrypted VPN. Some carriers run the
mediation switch themselves, while others pay companies like VeriSign to handle
the whole wiretapping process for them.

The numerical scope of DCSNet surveillance is still guarded. But we do know that
as telecoms have become more wiretap-friendly, the number of criminal wiretaps
alone has climbed from 1,150 in 1996 to 1,839 in 2006. That's a 60 percent jump.
And in 2005, 92 percent of those criminal wiretaps targeted cell phones,
according to a report published last year.

These figures include both state and federal wiretaps, and do not include
antiterrorism wiretaps, which dramatically expanded after 9/11. They also don't
count the DCS-3000's collection of incoming and outgoing phone numbers dialed.
Far more common than full-blown wiretaps, this level of surveillance requires
only that investigators certify that the phone numbers are relevant to an
investigation.

The Justice Department reports the number of pen registers to Congress annually,
but those numbers aren't public. According to the last figures leaked to the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, judges signed 4,886 pen register orders
in 1998, along with 4,621 time extensions.

CALEA Switches Rules on Switches
The law that makes the FBI's surveillance network possible had its genesis in
the Clinton administration. In the 1990s, the Justice Department began
complaining to Congress that digital technology, cellular phones and features
like call forwarding would make it difficult for investigators to continue to
conduct wiretaps. Congress responded by passing the Communications Assistance
for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, in 1994, mandating backdoors in U.S.
telephone switches.

CALEA requires telecommunications companies to install only telephone-switching
equipment that meets detailed wiretapping standards. Prior to CALEA, the FBI
would get a court order for a wiretap and present it to a phone company, which
would then create a physical tap of the phone system.

With new CALEA-compliant digital switches, the FBI now logs directly into the
telecom's network. Once a court order has been sent to a carrier and the carrier
turns on the wiretap, the communications data on a surveillance target streams
into the FBI's computers in real time.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation requested documents on the system under the
Freedom of Information Act, and successfully sued the Justice Department in
October 2006.

In May, a federal judge ordered the FBI to provide relevant documents to the EFF
every month until it has satisfied the FOIA request.

&quot;So little has been known up until now about how DCS works,&quot; says EFF attorney
Marcia Hofmann. &quot;This is why it's so important for FOIA requesters to file
lawsuits for information they really want.&quot;

Special Agent Anthony DiClemente, chief of the Data Acquisition and Intercept
Section of the FBI's Operational Technology Division, said the DCS was
originally intended in 1997 to be a temporary solution, but has grown into a
full-featured CALEA-collection software suite.

&quot;CALEA revolutionizes how law enforcement gets intercept information,&quot;
DiClemente told Wired News. &quot;Before CALEA, it was a rudimentary system that
mimicked Ma Bell.&quot;

Privacy groups and security experts have protested CALEA design mandates from
the start, but that didn't stop federal regulators from recently expanding the
law's reach to force broadband internet service providers and some
voice-over-internet companies, such as Vonage, to similarly retrofit their
networks for government surveillance.

New Technologies
Meanwhile, the FBI's efforts to keep up with the current communications
explosion is never-ending, according to DiClemente.

The released documents suggest that the FBI's wiretapping engineers are
struggling with peer-to-peer telephony provider Skype, which offers no central
location to wiretap, and with innovations like caller-ID spoofing and
phone-number portability.

But DCSNet seems to have kept pace with at least some new technologies, such as
cell-phone push-to-talk features and most VOIP internet telephony.

&quot;It is fair to say we can do push-to-talk,&quot; DiClemente says. &quot;All of the

Good news for Sly and Mr. Small ... bad news for you &quot;literalist&quot; 2nd Amendment
gun-nutters, to wit:

On 17 November 2003, Small filed a Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court
of the United States. The government did not oppose, citing an interest in
&quot;being able to apply a uniform national rule in regulating or giving advice to
persons with foreign convictions who seek to become licensed firearm importers,
manufacturers, or dealers, or who seek to possess firearms.&quot; On 29 March 2004,
the Court granted Certiorari, agreeing to hear the case.

Oral arguments were presented on 3 November 2004. The Supreme court ruled on
April 26, 2005, in favor of Small, in a decision written by Justice Breyer,
joined by justices Ginsburg, Stevens, O'Connor, and Souter. Justice Thomas,
joined by justices Scalia and Kennedy dissented. The majority opinion emphasised
anomalies resulting from a reading of &quot;any court&quot; to include foreign courts. The
dissent insisted on a literal interpretation of the word &quot;any&quot; and argued that
applying the law to foreign convictions was not irrational enough to rebut the
usual meaning of the word &quot;any&quot;.

Source?

STILL think that your PGP

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; messages are &quot;unbreakable&quot;?
">

I think that in the volume of traffic that is sent on the internet it's
impossible with current resources to sift through it all in mass. As to
whether pgp is unbreakable by the NSA I don't know and neither do you.
You're clearly speculating it is but unless you have set up some sort of
elaborate test (and I doubt you would be the first or even the 100th to have
tried) you don't know one way or the other and the NSA is not going to
intentionally tell you. For that reason unless you're involved in something
they really really really care about they are not going to directly use
information obtained by breaking a pgp encrypted transmission against you
anyway because if they do their capabilities become known. If you REALLY
need to communicate secretly use a one time pad and it cannot and will not
be broken unless the key is directly compromised.

Which is why, unless you are involved in something very high level you don't
need to worry about the NSA breaking your pgp encrypted messages even if
they can.

Hypothetical:

IRS seizes suspected tax evaders computer. Files are pgp encrypted and exist
nowhere else. Yeah, the suspect has used good real time file wiping software
to delete all plain text copies. IRS asks NSA to break encryption. Do you
think they are going to do it even if they can when doing so will let the
suspect and his attorneys know that they can in fact break pgp?

Dream on. But even amateurs on the net have

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Effectively and quickly compromising most modern encryption including pgp
usually involves stealing the unencrypted key. If you have spyware on your
computer and encrypt anything with a key that's entered in plain text, such
as creating an .sda file, the encryption will obviously be worthless against
whomever controls the spyware.

This statement is not correct. The correct version would be that you
don't have to worry about NSA REVEALING that they broke your code.
No, it is not likely that they will haul your decrypted messages into
court.  It would take a very, very, very, important case to counter
the loss of secrecy surrounding PGP decryption abilities. However, the
fact that they won't reveal that they read your messages does NOT mean
that they didn't read them.

The above is totally true. Security is attacked on MANY levels. My
guess is that the spyware to snoop America or at minimum the trapdoor
for entry has already been placed in your computer by Bill himself.
The best way to &quot;break&quot; codes is to steal the key or monitor the plain
text before it's encrypted.  But most amateurs even computer experts
don't think like this.
