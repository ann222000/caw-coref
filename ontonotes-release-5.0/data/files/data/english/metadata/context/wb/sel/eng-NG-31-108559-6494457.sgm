I am trying to create electronic source control drawings from pdf
vendor catalog pages.  I want to copy a small piece of the pdf and
paste it into the SCD.  Most of the time, the results are marginally
readable, especially the printouts.  Are there known techniques to
improve the quality of this process?

Our backup method at this time is to include a full copy of the pdf
file in the SCD folder in the the CM area of our network.  It goes
without saying that that uses up a lot of disk space.

You're probably copying as a bitmap, which is bad.
You need to copy as vectors. I think it depends on the PDF itself.
The only way to work these things I aware of, in Windows, is to open
the clipboard viewer and use a program called Metafile Companion.
Metafiles are Window's way of encapsulating all kinds of image
information.
I was able to create vector clip art for Office by copying from
Autocad's screen and pasting into Companion.
Then you can re-size with no quality penalty. Thing is, they look as
bad on-screen as before, but they print out nice.

BTW disk space is pretty much free these days no? 500G for less than
200$. That's a lot of PDFs.

Are you cutting just a portion of a page, or a whole page?

If whole page, use Adobe to extract that page.

If partial, perhaps use something like Universal Document Converter to
make a GIF that you can manually edit/crop?

To extract single pages, I use pdftops to convert the multi-page PDF into a
PS file, then I extract the page(s) that I want using psselect, and convert
the resulting PS back to PDF. All wrapped nicely into a shell script.

I have come across two types of Adobe documents in this effort.  In
some, I can use the Acrobat reader snapshot tool to get a piece of a
page.  In others, the snapshot is disabled, so I have used the Windows
Printscreen function to get a bitmap I can crop down to the part I
need.

I am including in the SCD the URL for the origianl docuemnt, and a
link to the copy of the document where it is stored on our network.
Unfortunately, all networks (including our own) are temporary, so I
wnat to include in the SCD itself as good an image as possible of the
information in the original pdf, then print it out and store it in a
real steel file cabinet.

Even early versions of Adobe will extract single pages.

I think the problem is how to compactly get just a portion of a
page... if you "crop" a PDF page the file size DOES NOT reduce.

Depends. If the PDF contains a bitmap (such as a scanned page), you can
extract that bitmap, crop out the section of interest with an image editor,
and convert the result back to PDF. The file size will reduce accordingly if
you use the same (or even a better) compression scheme as the original.

If the PDF is a vector document, cropping out a part can be hard or
impossible. But vector docs typically occupy much less space than bitmaps
anyway.

Adobe, as usual, works against us.

If you open a doc in (the incredibly stupid) Adobe Reader8, you can
zoom in and print the current view. If you have the Microsoft Office
Document Image Writer, or the Universal Document Converter, you can
then print to a file. It looks pretty good, not perfect but better
than snapping a bitmap.

You can't print the current view to CutePDF, pity.

Adobe photoshop can open a PDF. If it is multipage, you can select
which page to open. You can set the resolution that you want for
rendering.

I haven't use ghostview in some time, but it may be pdf tools as well.
This is an alternative if you don't have photoshop.
