I think that one of the most dangerous &quot;stumbling-blocks&quot; to the
presentation of the true Christian message comes from &quot;misplaced dogmatism&quot;.
Here is an article I wrote to my fellow Christians regarding this problem
and I would love to hear their thoughts on the subject.  And, for the
non-Christains, I would appreciate your thoughts as well, since it might
help my fellow Christians get a better &quot;feel&quot; for how this entire issue
might be effecting the presentation of the Christian message from your point
of view.

You may be right. If I had ever been or would ever be inclined to become
Christian, it would be a serious deterrent if I were required to believe
absurd things in order to do so, the more of those things and the more
absurd they were, the worse. (Kierkegaard, in my opinion, was a serious
nut.) I will hasten to add that standard Christian theology is absurd
enough to deter me, but creationism certainly adds to the mix.

Re:  &quot;Most did not even know that there were Christians who accepted
evolution, which shows how sheltered their lives had been.&quot;

IMO, that's less of a shelter and more of a mental prison.  This is
probably part of the reason why children from evangelical homes leave
the church in huge numbers.  It's ironic that fanatic attempts to shut
out the world seem more likely to lessen their own numbers over time.

In one article I found this interesting admission:  &quot;In 2002 the
Southern Baptist Council on Family Life reported to the SBC annual
meeting that 88% of children raised in evangelical homes leave church
at the age of 18, never to return. Any army that suffers 88% losses is
defeated disastrously.&quot;

Admission of corruption.

General Reader:

VBM is a Darwinist. His &quot;silent&quot; motive to change and corrupt the
Bible is to make it more appealing to secular. Logic says, of course,
that real Christians would not corrupt the Holy Bible for any reason.
VBM and his forthright admission of corruption falsifies his claim
that he is a Christian.

Real Christians, according to history, died to preserve the Bible.

How do we explain VBMs view about himself (&quot;I am a Christian&quot;)?

The same way the Bible explains other persons who &quot;walked with&quot; Christ
and were &quot;close&quot; to Him: Judas the Betrayer.

Therefore, VBM proves Biblical typology absolutely correct: persons
close to Christ (Judas/VBM) betray Him and His word (= attempted and
admitted corruption while claiming to be a Christian): the Bible
corresponds to reality, that is, VBM corresponds directly to Judas
proving that the typology is true.

Read your history book again Ray.

How is it that creationists often know as little about Christianity as
they do about science?  I sometimes get the impression that many
creationists aren't so much angry about science as they are about
people much smarter than themselves, regardless of the topic.

What if you determined that with the present cultural makeup, that you
could gain
more converts with YECism than any other explanation of origins?
Wouldn't that be
the way to go, regardless of the truth?  Salvation through Christ is
essential, not being
scientifically correct, right?

Reality says, that people who think themselves 'Real Christians' corrupt
the Bible all the time.  Ray, for example claims that an entire book of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You may be right. If I had ever been or would ever be inclined to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; become Christian, it would be a serious deterrent if I were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; required to believe absurd things in order to do so, the more of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those things and the more absurd they were, the worse.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Kierkegaard, in my opinion, was a serious nut.) I will hasten to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; add that standard Christian theology is absurd enough to deter me,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but creationism certainly adds to the mix.

&gt;&gt; General Reader:

&gt;&gt; VBM is a Darwinist. His &quot;silent&quot; motive to change and corrupt the
&gt;&gt; Bible is to make it more appealing to secular. Logic says, of course,
&gt;&gt; that real Christians would not corrupt the Holy Bible for any reason.
&gt;&gt; VBM and his forthright admission of corruption falsifies his claim
&gt;&gt; that he is a Christian.

Ray is a Scottist. His very noisy motive is to ignore those bits of the
Bible he isn't comfortable with (e.g. the parts where Jesus talks of
love, peace, camels, needles, etc.) in order to make it more appealing
to racist fuckwits who advocate genocide.

&gt;&gt; How do we explain VBMs view about himself (&quot;I am a Christian&quot;)?

&gt;&gt; The same way the Bible explains other persons who &quot;walked with&quot;
&gt;&gt; Christ and were &quot;close&quot; to Him: Judas the Betrayer.

&gt;&gt; Therefore, VBM proves Biblical typology absolutely correct: persons
&gt;&gt; close to Christ (Judas/VBM) betray Him and His word (= attempted and
&gt;&gt; admitted corruption while claiming to be a Christian): the Bible
&gt;&gt; corresponds to reality, that is, VBM corresponds directly to Judas
&gt;&gt; proving that the typology is true.

Ray has never once been accused of being close to Christ. Literally or

I don't get that VBM is saying that at all.  He is opposed to any
&quot;dogmatic&quot; rendering of creationism that insists it is the only
interpretation compatible with Christianity.  If one is able to accept
Christianity and be a YEC, or an OEC, or an IDer, that is fine, the
main thing is to be a Christian and not be dogmatic about one's own
scientific view.  The truth of biological origins is of minor
importance.  Of course, it would be helpful to hear VBM himself
response to this!

Yes, that is right.  The main point is that we want to tell the truth
regarding what the Bible says and doesn't say, and what we are not sure
about.   That type of honesty is necessary, and is not undermining of the
strength of our convictions.   To accept that we don't know exactly how God
did things is, and to point out that the Bible actually does not make any
attempts to tell us that exactly, is not a blow to Christian evangelism, but
is actually a benefit to it, since it removes the stumbling block for those
who would otherwise see a direct conflict between the science they accept
and Scripture.

For too many years (since the late 60's), Christians have bought into the
Modernistic worldview that everything that is &quot;real&quot; can be explained by
science, and thus went off to science to prove everything they believed.
Not only was this misguided in the first place (you can't prove the things
of God scientifically), it was even worse when they were trying to prove
INCORRECT views of Scripture with science!  If geocentrism taught us
anything, it was that if there is a seeming contradiction between science
and Scripture, the first place to look is your interpretation of Scripture
to see if that may be where the fault lies!   As it turns out, in almost
every case (possibly EVERY case), it has been just that.

And this is not just retrofitting Scripture to fit science.   We allow
science to inform how we read Scripture, but in every case a reasonable
approach to Scripture shows that the direction we are being pulled by
scientific knowledge ends up being the better approach anyway.  Modern
secular scholarship agrees that the ancient Israelites would never have
considered the creation texts to be strict literal historical narrative, for
example.

In the end, Christians need to stop battling with science and focus on
presenting a different worldview other than the Modernistic,
Post-Enlightenment concepts that everything that is &quot;real&quot; can be determined
by the study of the natural world.  We need to remind the world, and gently
without rancor, that &quot;there is more in heaven and earth, Horatio, than is
dreamt of in your philosophy.&quot;

Seriously.  I know that religious ideas customarily have this &quot;Get out

respect for a man's similar belief that his wife is beautiful and his

Suppose that somehow (*) you were presented with a videotape of the
Feeding of the 5000. It either does or doesn't show a straightforward
and literal miracle. Wouldn't your faith be affected according to
whether the miracle happened or not? Or would you expect to see a sort
of foggy ambiguity where the miracle happened in a 'spiritual' sense
without any actual food?

Agreed, because nobody (much) claims that Christianity is a cure for

Oh, I agree that getting the facts right matters, to the extent that the
facts are determinable.  And, to the extent they are determinable, I do not
think that they have (or really ever could, but that is a faith issue) shown
Christian belief to be inherently incorrect.  My point is that while science
COULD disprove various aspects of Christian fact claims (but has not yet),
it can not go the other direction and PROVE Christian theological claims.  I
believe there is a realm of truth beyond that which scientific inquiry can
reach.  And that is where the creationist movement has gotten off-track,
especially with ID.  They have swollowed the blue pill and accept that all
that is true should be able to be proven scientifically, so that if we
believe something to be true, we better go out and find that natural
evidence.

I think this is misguided for the reasons I mentioned.  I think science can
direct us, and can help correct interpretive points, but we can not weild it
like a scepter to prove things outside of the natural realm.

Would you say that the theory of common descent has been proven?  If
so, then the theory is determinable and is one of the facts that you
say matters (whether to believe it or not.) On the other hand, you say
that it's OK to be a YEC or have any position on this determinable
fact, as long as you aren't dogmatic about it. This seems
contradictory and I'm not clear on what you are saying, unless, of

&gt; Would you say that the theory of common descent has been proven?  If
&gt; so, then the theory is determinable and is one of the facts that you
&gt; say matters (whether to believe it or not.) On the other hand, you say
&gt; that it's OK to be a YEC or have any position on this determinable
&gt; fact, as long as you aren't dogmatic about it. This seems
&gt; contradictory and I'm not clear on what you are saying, unless, of
&gt; course, you are saying that the theory of common descent is not
&gt; determinable.
">

Well, even though I believe that common descent is the most likely
explanation of the variety of species, and would hold that to the same
degree of certainty that just about anyone here does, I could not say it has
been proven.  It is a theory, and theories are not proven.  They are only
supported by evidence to a certain degree.  And, yes, to a degree that can
rise right up to a level that could be called &quot;fact&quot; when that word is
properly defined.  But no, not proven.

But, that is a quibble, and I will not use it to dodge since I get the point
you are making.  Where I disagree would be whether it is one of the points
that matter in regards to Christian belief.   As far as Christian theology
is concerned, it does NOT matter in the least.   The only thing that matters
in Christian terms is the degree to which it impacts the validity of
Scripture, and there it is important to be truthful and factual: there is
nothing about evolution which absolutely, without doubt, impacts the
validity of Scripture one way or the other.   Now, if a person happens to
believe, based on the evidence, that the earth is 6,000 years old and all
species (oops, &quot;kinds&quot;) are specially created, that is there prerogative,
and I would say they are wrong, and they would say I am wrong (but I would
be right!).   And, if they believe that evolution would impact on the
validity of Scripture, that is fine, if it is what they honestly believe.
BUT, to present it to others as if it is an absolute truth, rather than
their conclusion based on their review of the evidence, would be a reckless
misrepresentation of the issues.  In fact, I would call it dishonest.

">

As long as he was clear to explain what that meant, rather than just use the
layman's version, as if it was proven, then it would be borderline.  The
reason I say borderline is that I think he would have a hard time presenting
the YEC position as established in a scientific way with that degree of
certainty.  I think where the dishonesty would come in would be if he would
act as if scientific evidence alone, absent any theological presuppositions,
would lead to this level of certainty for the YEC position.  After all, when
we are talking about &quot;facts&quot; of that type, we are talking about those able
to be established by the material evidence alone.

If he presented it as a conclusion reached to that level of certainty based
on his faith presumptions as well (Scripture being inerrant, etc),  then he
might be able to get away with it.  But then, since he would be presenting
theological truths from a Christian perspective, I think it would be
incumbent upon any honest YEC to explain the variety of belief on the
subject at the same time.

Needless to say, very few YEC's meet these standards.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GS

&gt; &gt; &gt; Given his target audience, I can see writing from the shared
&gt; &gt; &gt; presumption that Christianity (of an evangelistic-ish flavor) is
&gt; &gt; &gt; factually accurate. Same as writing an article for &quot;Extreme Skiing
&gt; &gt; &gt; Magazine&quot; which takes it for granted that the reader considers skiing
&gt; &gt; &gt; a worthwhile use of his time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure that for the same reason, the article assumes&quot;Getting people
&gt; &gt; &gt; Saved is the important thing&quot; to equate with &quot;telling the truth is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; best way to get people Saved.&quot; But yeah, it's a little disquieting
&gt; &gt; &gt; when you see a possible division between the two options and it's not
&gt; &gt; &gt; addressed.

&gt; &gt; I don't get that VBM is saying that at all.  He is opposed to any
&gt; &gt; &quot;dogmatic&quot; rendering of creationism that insists it is the only
&gt; &gt; interpretation compatible with Christianity.  If one is able to accept
&gt; &gt; Christianity and be a YEC, or an OEC, or an IDer, that is fine, the
&gt; &gt; main thing is to be a Christian and not be dogmatic about one's own
&gt; &gt; scientific view.  The truth of biological origins is of minor
&gt; &gt; importance.  Of course, it would be helpful to hear VBM himself
&gt; &gt; response to this!

&gt; Yes, that is right.  The main point is that we want to tell the truth
&gt; regarding what the Bible says and doesn't say, and what we are not sure
&gt; about.   That type of honesty is necessary, and is not undermining of the
&gt; strength of our convictions.   To accept that we don't know exactly how God
&gt; did things is, and to point out that the Bible actually does not make any
&gt; attempts to tell us that exactly, is not a blow to Christian evangelism, but

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose that somehow (*) you were presented with a videotape of

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe something to be true, we better go out and find that natural
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is misguided for the reasons I mentioned.  I think

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would you say that the theory of common descent has been proven?  If
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so, then the theory is determinable and is one of the facts that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say matters (whether to believe it or not.) On the other hand, you say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it's OK to be a YEC or have any position on this determinable
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fact, as long as you aren't dogmatic about it. This seems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contradictory and I'm not clear on what you are saying, unless, of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course, you are saying that the theory of common descent is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; determinable.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, even though I believe that common descent is the most likely
&gt; &gt; &gt; explanation of the variety of species, and would hold that to the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; degree of certainty that just about anyone here does, I could not say it
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; &gt; been proven.  It is a theory, and theories are not proven.  They are
&gt; only
&gt; &gt; &gt; supported by evidence to a certain degree.  And, yes, to a degree that
&gt; can
&gt; &gt; &gt; rise right up to a level that could be called &quot;fact&quot; when that word is
&gt; &gt; &gt; properly defined.  But no, not proven.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But, that is a quibble, and I will not use it to dodge since I get the
&gt; point
&gt; &gt; &gt; you are making.  Where I disagree would be whether it is one of the
&gt; points
&gt; &gt; &gt; that matter in regards to Christian belief.   As far as Christian
&gt; theology
&gt; &gt; &gt; is concerned, it does NOT matter in the least.   The only thing that
&gt; matters
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Christian terms is the degree to which it impacts the validity of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Scripture, and there it is important to be truthful and factual: there
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing about evolution which absolutely, without doubt, impacts the
&gt; &gt; &gt; validity of Scripture one way or the other.   Now, if a person happens
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe, based on the evidence, that the earth is 6,000 years old and
&gt; all
&gt; &gt; &gt; species (oops, &quot;kinds&quot;) are specially created, that is there
&gt; prerogative,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and I would say they are wrong, and they would say I am wrong (but I
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; be right!).   And, if they believe that evolution would impact on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; validity of Scripture, that is fine, if it is what they honestly
&gt; believe.
&gt; &gt; &gt; BUT, to present it to others as if it is an absolute truth, rather than
&gt; &gt; &gt; their conclusion based on their review of the evidence, would be a
&gt; reckless
&gt; &gt; &gt; misrepresentation of the issues.  In fact, I would call it dishonest.-
&gt; Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; In your opinion, would it be dishonest for the YEC to present his
&gt; &gt; views not as absolute truth, but as &quot;fact&quot;, defined as you define it?

&gt; As long as he was clear to explain what that meant, rather than just use the
&gt; layman's version, as if it was proven, then it would be borderline.  The
&gt; reason I say borderline is that I think he would have a hard time presenting
&gt; the YEC position as established in a scientific way with that degree of
&gt; certainty.  I think where the dishonesty would come in would be if he would
&gt; act as if scientific evidence alone, absent any theological presuppositions,
&gt; would lead to this level of certainty for the YEC position.  After all, when
&gt; we are talking about &quot;facts&quot; of that type, we are talking about those able
&gt; to be established by the material evidence alone.

&gt; If he presented it as a conclusion reached to that level of certainty based
&gt; on his faith presumptions as well (Scripture being inerrant, etc),  then he
&gt; might be able to get away with it.  But then, since he would be presenting
&gt; theological truths from a Christian perspective, I think it would be
&gt; incumbent upon any honest YEC to explain the variety of belief on the
&gt; subject at the same time.

&gt; Needless to say, very few YEC's meet these standards.- Hide quoted text -

Now it sounds like on the one hand you're saying it's OK to believe
what you want with regards to origins, the main thing is to become a
Christian.  On the other hand, the real world YECs (and probably OECs
and IDers) are dishonest, so it's not OK to espouse that.  The YECs
you want to be open minded about don't exist.  It seems like you're
trying to say that Christians should be openmined about creationism,
but for all practical purposes, the standard scientific model is the
only honest one.  Your plea for openmindedness only makes sense in a
fantasy world of honest YECs.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GS

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Given his target audience, I can see writing from the shared
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; presumption that Christianity (of an evangelistic-ish flavor) is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; factually accurate. Same as writing an article for &quot;Extreme Skiing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Magazine&quot; which takes it for granted that the reader considers
skiing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a worthwhile use of his time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure that for the same reason, the article assumes&quot;Getting
people
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Saved is the important thing&quot; to equate with &quot;telling the truth is
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best way to get people Saved.&quot; But yeah, it's a little disquieting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when you see a possible division between the two options and it's
not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; addressed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't get that VBM is saying that at all.  He is opposed to any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;dogmatic&quot; rendering of creationism that insists it is the only
&gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation compatible with Christianity.  If one is able to accept
&gt; &gt; &gt; Christianity and be a YEC, or an OEC, or an IDer, that is fine, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; main thing is to be a Christian and not be dogmatic about one's own
&gt; &gt; &gt; scientific view.  The truth of biological origins is of minor
&gt; &gt; &gt; importance.  Of course, it would be helpful to hear VBM himself
&gt; &gt; &gt; response to this!

&gt; &gt; Yes, that is right.  The main point is that we want to tell the truth
&gt; &gt; regarding what the Bible says and doesn't say, and what we are not sure
&gt; &gt; about.   That type of honesty is necessary, and is not undermining of
the
&gt; &gt; strength of our convictions.   To accept that we don't know exactly how
God
&gt; &gt; did things is, and to point out that the Bible actually does not make
any
&gt; &gt; attempts to tell us that exactly, is not a blow to Christian evangelism,
but
&gt; &gt; is actually a benefit to it, since it removes the stumbling block for
those
&gt; &gt; who would otherwise see a direct conflict between the science they
accept

No, that is not quite where I am coming from.  I think science and religion
cover two very different fields and should not be mixed up.  Science is the
study of how the natural world works, religion is the study of those areas
of SUPER-natural things, which is, by definition, something science can not
deal with.

I think the problem is that in Modern times (using the term purposefully),
too many have come to think in entirely philosophical naturalistic terms,
and have thus elevated science from merely the study of how natural things
work naturally, to the final answer on what IS.  I do not think we should
mix up religion and science, since they cover different areas, but that we
should be open to both forms of knowledge and sources of evidence to
determine the whole of what is.  It is not a balance that is needed, it is
the sum of both.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would you say that the theory of common descent has been proven?  If
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so, then the theory is determinable and is one of the facts that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say matters (whether to believe it or not.) On the other hand, you say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it's OK to be a YEC or have any position on this determinable
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fact, as long as you aren't dogmatic about it. This seems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contradictory and I'm not clear on what you are saying, unless, of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course, you are saying that the theory of common descent is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; determinable.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, even though I believe that common descent is the most likely
&gt; &gt; &gt; explanation of the variety of species, and would hold that to the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; degree of certainty that just about anyone here does, I could not say it
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; &gt; been proven.  It is a theory, and theories are not proven.  They are
&gt; only
&gt; &gt; &gt; supported by evidence to a certain degree.  And, yes, to a degree that
&gt; can
&gt; &gt; &gt; rise right up to a level that could be called &quot;fact&quot; when that word is
&gt; &gt; &gt; properly defined.  But no, not proven.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But, that is a quibble, and I will not use it to dodge since I get the
&gt; point
&gt; &gt; &gt; you are making.  Where I disagree would be whether it is one of the
&gt; points
&gt; &gt; &gt; that matter in regards to Christian belief.   As far as Christian
&gt; theology
&gt; &gt; &gt; is concerned, it does NOT matter in the least.   The only thing that
&gt; matters
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Christian terms is the degree to which it impacts the validity of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Scripture, and there it is important to be truthful and factual: there
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing about evolution which absolutely, without doubt, impacts the
&gt; &gt; &gt; validity of Scripture one way or the other.   Now, if a person happens
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe, based on the evidence, that the earth is 6,000 years old and
&gt; all
&gt; &gt; &gt; species (oops, &quot;kinds&quot;) are specially created, that is there
&gt; prerogative,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and I would say they are wrong, and they would say I am wrong (but I
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; be right!).   And, if they believe that evolution would impact on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; validity of Scripture, that is fine, if it is what they honestly
&gt; believe.
&gt; &gt; &gt; BUT, to present it to others as if it is an absolute truth, rather than
&gt; &gt; &gt; their conclusion based on their review of the evidence, would be a
&gt; reckless
&gt; &gt; &gt; misrepresentation of the issues.  In fact, I would call it dishonest.-

&gt; &gt; In your opinion, would it be dishonest for the YEC to present his
&gt; &gt; views not as absolute truth, but as &quot;fact&quot;, defined as you define it?

&gt; As long as he was clear to explain what that meant, rather than just use the
&gt; layman's version, as if it was proven, then it would be borderline.  The
&gt; reason I say borderline is that I think he would have a hard time presenting
&gt; the YEC position as established in a scientific way with that degree of
&gt; certainty.  I think where the dishonesty would come in would be if he would
&gt; act as if scientific evidence alone, absent any theological presuppositions,
&gt; would lead to this level of certainty for the YEC position.  After all, when
&gt; we are talking about &quot;facts&quot; of that type, we are talking about those able
&gt; to be established by the material evidence alone.

&gt; If he presented it as a conclusion reached to that level of certainty based
&gt; on his faith presumptions as well (Scripture being inerrant, etc),  then he
&gt; might be able to get away with it.  But then, since he would be presenting
&gt; theological truths from a Christian perspective, I think it would be
&gt; incumbent upon any honest YEC to explain the variety of belief on the
&gt; subject at the same time.

&gt; Needless to say, very few YEC's meet these standards.- Hide quoted text -

Curious how Google Groups works sometimes.  I can see that you've
replied to my latest post on the tree on the left, but if I click on
it, it shows my note instead.  The numbering is such that it skips
your note on the right.  Right now, your note is 27, on the right it
has all the notes, except for yours, going 25,26,28,29.  Strange...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would you say that the theory of common descent has been proven?
If
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so, then the theory is determinable and is one of the facts that
you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say matters (whether to believe it or not.) On the other hand, you
say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it's OK to be a YEC or have any position on this determinable
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fact, as long as you aren't dogmatic about it. This seems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contradictory and I'm not clear on what you are saying, unless, of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course, you are saying that the theory of common descent is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; determinable.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, even though I believe that common descent is the most likely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explanation of the variety of species, and would hold that to the
same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; degree of certainty that just about anyone here does, I could not
say it
&gt; &gt; has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been proven.  It is a theory, and theories are not proven.  They are
&gt; &gt; only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supported by evidence to a certain degree.  And, yes, to a degree
that
&gt; &gt; can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rise right up to a level that could be called &quot;fact&quot; when that word
is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; properly defined.  But no, not proven.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, that is a quibble, and I will not use it to dodge since I get
the
&gt; &gt; point
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you are making.  Where I disagree would be whether it is one of the
&gt; &gt; points
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that matter in regards to Christian belief.   As far as Christian
&gt; &gt; theology
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is concerned, it does NOT matter in the least.   The only thing that
&gt; &gt; matters
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Christian terms is the degree to which it impacts the validity of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scripture, and there it is important to be truthful and factual:
there
&gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nothing about evolution which absolutely, without doubt, impacts the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; validity of Scripture one way or the other.   Now, if a person
happens
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe, based on the evidence, that the earth is 6,000 years old
and
&gt; &gt; all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; species (oops, &quot;kinds&quot;) are specially created, that is there
&gt; &gt; prerogative,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I would say they are wrong, and they would say I am wrong (but I
&gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be right!).   And, if they believe that evolution would impact on
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; validity of Scripture, that is fine, if it is what they honestly
&gt; &gt; believe.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BUT, to present it to others as if it is an absolute truth, rather
than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their conclusion based on their review of the evidence, would be a
&gt; &gt; reckless
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misrepresentation of the issues.  In fact, I would call it
dishonest.-
&gt; &gt; Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; In your opinion, would it be dishonest for the YEC to present his
&gt; &gt; &gt; views not as absolute truth, but as &quot;fact&quot;, defined as you define it?

&gt; &gt; As long as he was clear to explain what that meant, rather than just use
the
&gt; &gt; layman's version, as if it was proven, then it would be borderline.  The
&gt; &gt; reason I say borderline is that I think he would have a hard time
presenting
&gt; &gt; the YEC position as established in a scientific way with that degree of
&gt; &gt; certainty.  I think where the dishonesty would come in would be if he
would
&gt; &gt; act as if scientific evidence alone, absent any theological
presuppositions,
&gt; &gt; would lead to this level of certainty for the YEC position.  After all,
when
&gt; &gt; we are talking about &quot;facts&quot; of that type, we are talking about those
able
&gt; &gt; to be established by the material evidence alone.

&gt; &gt; If he presented it as a conclusion reached to that level of certainty
based
&gt; &gt; on his faith presumptions as well (Scripture being inerrant, etc),  then
he
&gt; &gt; might be able to get away with it.  But then, since he would be
presenting
&gt; &gt; theological truths from a Christian perspective, I think it would be
&gt; &gt; incumbent upon any honest YEC to explain the variety of belief on the
&gt; &gt; subject at the same time.

&gt; &gt; Needless to say, very few YEC's meet these standards.- Hide quoted

&gt; Curious how Google Groups works sometimes.  I can see that you've
&gt; replied to my latest post on the tree on the left, but if I click on
&gt; it, it shows my note instead.  The numbering is such that it skips
&gt; your note on the right.  Right now, your note is 27, on the right it
&gt; has all the notes, except for yours, going 25,26,28,29.  Strange...
">

That is odd.  The wonders of technology! :)

Anyway, my response was simply a flippant agreement, something like &quot;so my
theory of the &quot;honest YEC&quot; is not supported by sufficient evidence?&quot;

Or something like that.

The Protestants have a neat explanation for that.  It's a sort of having

I'd say it died out when St. Paul stole the show.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; like a scepter to prove things outside of the natural realm.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; In short, you conveniently move certain pieces of the board, declaring
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; forever after safe from the peering eye of science.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not at all, I am just rational about what science can analyze and what
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And my main concern is that you seem to be giving license to any manner of
&gt; &gt; &gt; claim.  Or even worse, not trying to do that, but trying to formulate a
&gt; &gt; &quot;Get
&gt; &gt; &gt; out of Jail free&quot; card for your particular religious beliefs.

&gt; &gt; Well, it comes down to whether you believe that there is reality outside of
&gt; &gt; the natural or not.  If you do not, then you do not, and I don't pretend
&gt; &gt; that I can prove to you that it exists.  But, at the same time, you seem to
&gt; &gt; be insisting that I can't possibly really believe that this supernatural
&gt; &gt; exists, and am just creating a hedge around it anyway.  What would be the
&gt; &gt; sense of that?

&gt; &gt; &gt; For instance, we know that people who have been dead three days don't come
&gt; &gt; &gt; back to life.  Tissues are breaking down, the decaying process is under
&gt; &gt; way.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And yet I'll wager right now you insist the resurrection is possible.
&gt; &gt; How?
&gt; &gt; &gt; With magic, of course, magic which conveniently is wielded by an
&gt; &gt; omnipotent
&gt; &gt; &gt; supernatural being who, by gum, science is powerless to measure, define or
&gt; &gt; &gt; predict the behavior of.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Very convenient that.

&gt; &gt; Maybe, but I am not arguing that science can't analyze it for convenience's
&gt; &gt; sake.  I am simply pointing out what is true: science can't analyze it.  If
&gt; &gt; we could somehow verify it with natural evidence in some way, then I would
&gt; &gt; be very happy with that.  I just happen to believe in something that is
&gt; &gt; outside of scientific verification.  Again, I sense that you think this is
&gt; &gt; somehow a trick and I don't really believe it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  I think all the ID folks are wrong in presuming that they can prove
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a supernatural causation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you have their motivations entirely wrong, or at least the
&gt; &gt; &gt; motivations of the formulators of Intelligent Design.  They know quite
&gt; &gt; well
&gt; &gt; &gt; that what they're saying is bullshit.  They're just trying to sneak
&gt; &gt; &gt; Creationism into public schools.  They're doing what other marketers of
&gt; &gt; &gt; pseudo-scientific products do, making it sound &quot;sciencey&quot; with crapola
&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematics and technical-sounding jargon.

&gt; &gt; That is part of it, sure.  But I think a lot of the impetus behind it is
&gt; &gt; holding a sincere belief, then attempting to establish it on grounds that
&gt; &gt; they have been raised to believe is essential.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are you, instead, asserting that science CAN analyze the supernatural?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would agree that, to the extent that a proposed supernatural event
&gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily leave behind certain evidence (like a global flood), science
&gt; &gt; can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disprove that a particular supernatural even occurred, but it does this
&gt; &gt; by a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; review of the natural, of course.  Other than that, I don't see how
&gt; &gt; science
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be expected to answer questions about things outside of the
&gt; &gt; natural.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If we modified the Flood Story to say God hid the evidence after the fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; (in short, invoking omphalism) does that mean the story now becomes
&gt; &gt; &gt; potentially true?  Is there any limit to the claims that I can make and
&gt; &gt; hide
&gt; &gt; &gt; via &quot;It's supernatural, now go away&quot;?

&gt; &gt; Sure, that limit would be intellectual honesty.  If I believe in a
&gt; &gt; supernatural event, and it is established that it did NOT happen, such as
&gt; &gt; the global flood, I would be required to abandon that belief.  Such as
&gt; &gt; special creation, a global flood, etc.  There are many beliefs that I hold
&gt; &gt; entirely on faith that science can't prove did not happen, though.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree that science cannot deal with hypothetical entities like an
&gt; &gt; &gt; omnipotent being.  But that, it seems to me, says more about the people
&gt; &gt; who
&gt; &gt; &gt; advocate an omnipotent being than about science.

I see what you mean, but you do not claim to have some special source of
moral edification and uplifting, like the Holy Spirit, which is meant to
help us rise above our basic selfish natures and move toward &quot;loving one
another&quot; in ways that we can't do on our own.  If there are two equally rude
individuals, even if both are equally desiring to be moral, it is still the
one who is claiming supernatural assistance that has set a higher bar for
himself.

&gt;&gt;avowed atheist would stand little chance of election to public office
&gt;&gt;almost anywhere, whatever his other virtues.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have seen enough on both sides to say that neither can claim the moral
&gt;&gt;&gt;high ground.  This, of course, is more of a condemnation of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;fundamentalist than the atheist, given their claims.

&gt;&gt;That seems a bit condescending and dismissive too. (And in fact I find
&gt;&gt;the statements of most religionists regarding atheism to be highly
&gt;&gt;dismissive and condescending.) Who says that an atheist wouldn't want to
&gt;&gt;claim the moral high ground? In fact I do, and could attempt to defend
&gt;&gt;the claim that atheism is a moral choice superior to religion, if you

&gt; cared.

&gt;&gt;This is of course entirely off-topic for TO.

&gt; I see what you mean, but you do not claim to have some special source of
&gt; moral edification and uplifting, like the Holy Spirit, which is meant to
&gt; help us rise above our basic selfish natures and move toward &quot;loving one
&gt; another&quot; in ways that we can't do on our own.  If there are two equally rude
&gt; individuals, even if both are equally desiring to be moral, it is still the
&gt; one who is claiming supernatural assistance that has set a higher bar for
&gt; himself.

I would say that in that case the extra condemnation is due not for
failing to live up to a moral code, but for claiming special status for
that moral code in the first place.

Hmm, I wouldn't really call it a special &quot;status&quot; since that implies that we
are somehow part of a special &quot;super-club&quot; that is automatically more moral.
Would that it were that easy.   What I, as a Christian, believe is that we
have access to a &quot;helper&quot; who can give us a boost in that regard, and only
if we avail ourselves of it.  It is something free to all, so there is
nothing exclusive about it, or allow us any self-congratulation.  On the
contrary, I believe that we are then held to a higher standard of care, and
one which we rarely meet.

And that is in fact what many Christians do claim. I will accept that
you are not one of them.

I doubt the existence of this helper, and there seems little evidence
for one; if it existed, wouldn't it have the effect of making
Christians, on average, more moral than non-Christians?

What makes you think you're held to a higher standard?
