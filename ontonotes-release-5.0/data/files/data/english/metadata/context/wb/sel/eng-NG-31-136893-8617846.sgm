Did anyone other than Banyan race last weekend at Explore park?  He
got robbed of the victory because they only counted the number of
orienteering points that you captured, not the time of the race.

Yup, did the race.  They announced in the pre-meeting how they were
going to score it so you had to counter how much time you too versus
how many points you tried to get with a 3pm cutoff.  The time only
came into play if the same number of points were posted.  If you went
by time only then people would have skipped the O course entirely.
Unless he stayed out until 3pm trying to get points, he didn't make
good use of his time.

This the Banyon and &quot;getting robbed&quot; is a little strong Pit Bull, but
thanks for the message. However to me this was not an AR it was a
Orienteering Race with running,biking and canoeing being the tie
breaker.  It was not clear in the pre-race brief that the orienteering
points would be the main reason in determining the winner.  It was
said that there was a cut off time of 3:00pm, and the race would be
decided by the orienteering and the race time, not the race time as an
tie breaker.  My goal since I was not doing that well in the
orienteering was to make up the time in the actual race, but i guess I
should of stayed spent all my time in the orienteering field. I need
to some experience in that area anyway.

Is this format normal in AR's?  I know from what I could tell it was
not done like this in the other two sprints.

Anyway, enough said.  It was still a great race and a lot of fun.  The
event was set up A+. But, I will know next time to inquire how much
the orienteering points are worth.

In a pre-race AR briefing this is the most critical piece of info you
can get - how is finish being scored.  If you are unclear be sure to
ask.  I would suggest you go and checkout the handout they had, I
think (but not positive) that it's there also. You are right in that
in the briefing it was confusing if you didn't see what he was going
for (Opoints THEN time).  What I missed in the briefing was that they
were using streamers as well as O flags on the course, so I had
trouble finding the first one).

What I can say from the few races I've done, and the many more I've
researched and followed, is that every race is different.  Its really
up to how the race director wants to weigh things - which is why it's
so important to understand what really is being counted.

The previous sprint race in the series was very close except that that
O course was very last and each point was worth a time deduction.  But
really decided the finisher order was how many you got and how quickly
you did it - so pretty much the same except it was last and the math
was alot more complicated.

Folks,
This is Mark Montague. I am a race director for the newly formed
JROC (James River Orienteering Club). I am planning an Extreme-O race for
Nov that sounds like it will be similar to this race in Explore Park. Can
someone please connect me to the race director (email address or #) as I'd
like to ask about the race and ideas for our race here in the Tidewater area
on Nov (10th).

Thanks,

Mark M

Mark,
Go to OARevents.com.
The contact info is at the bottom.

This is a great team and very experienced in putting on races.

Let us know what are the details on the race.  That would be a good
time for our team to do another one.
I also could use the experience in orienteering.
