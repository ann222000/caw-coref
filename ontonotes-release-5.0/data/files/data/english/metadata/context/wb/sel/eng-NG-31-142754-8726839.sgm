government officials to axe it.]

THIS is one tree that has defied death several times. Standing amidst acres
of the now barren sandy tract, about 15 km from Hisar, an old peepul tree
has weathered many a storm since 1973 when it first shot into limelight
after appearing in an old Brahmin's dream. It is believed to be the tree
under which a warrior Babreek, widely believed to be a grandson of Bhima of
Mahabharata fame, demonstrated his unique skill with the bow and arrow in
the presence of Lord Krishna and Arjuna by roping all its leaves with a
single arrow.

For 28 years now, this tree has survived several attempts by government
officials to axe it. The latest attempt was made a few weeks ago when the
entire area was cleared of thick forest cover to convert it into a research
farm. While thousands of trees were mowed down by giant earthmoving
machinery, no machine operator was prepared to cut down this huge tree. It
is now the only tree visible on several hundred acres of land around it. The
tree is located at Bir Babran in the farmland originally attached to the
Central Sheep Breeding Farm, previously known as the Indo-Australian Sheep
Breeding Farm. The land has now been given to the Chaudhry Charan Singh
Haryana Agricultural University for research farming.

Even before this tree shot into fame in 1973, legend had it that the Bir
Babran village was named after Babreek, the warrior grandson of Bhima. (Bir
in common parlance means a forest and Babran is said to be the distorted
name of Babreek). It is said that before the Mahabharata war Lord Krishna
and Arjuna were scouting the area for warriors in the garb of saffron-clad
sadhus. They were resting under this tree, when a young athletically-built
horse rider accosted them.

He told them that he was the grandson of Bhima and his mother had sent him
to join the Mahabharata war. He said his mother had directed him to join the
losing side and convert defeat into victory through his skill with the bow
and arrow. Lord Krishna is said to have asked him to demonstrate his skill.
Babreek looked at the huge peepul tree and told them that he could rope all
the leaves with a single arrow. He then shot an arrow which began piercing
each leaf.

According to the folklore, Lord Krishna hid one of the leaves under his
foot. The arrow after piercing the leaves began to hover over Lord Krishna's
foot. Babreek then asked him to lift his foot or else the arrow would pierce
the foot too. The arrow then collected that leaf and jumped back into
Babreek's quiver. The young warrior's exceptional skill surprised both Lord
Krishna and Arjuna.

However, his insistence that he would side with the loser made them think
deeply. They realised that if Babreek joined the Kauravas he could
single-handedly convert Pandava's victory into defeat. Lord Krishna then hit
upon an idea. Since he was posing as a sadhu, the lord asked Babreek for
alms. Babreek asked him to name anything that he could give. The lord asked
for his head and got it. However, the lord told him that in return Babreek
would be known as Shyam Baba and that devout Hindus would worship him
forever.

Since then Shyam Baba has been worshipped in various temples. The most
famous temple is located at Khatuji in Rajasthan. It is also said that
before giving his head in alms to the lord, Babreek requested that his head
be placed atop a tall tree so he could watch the war. The lord is said to
have accepted his request and the head was put atop a tree from where the
beheaded warrior watched the goings on in the war. This peepul tree is
different from a normal tree of this genus. Its young leaves develop small
round brownish spots which, over a period, become small holes. While legend
has it that these holes are the result of piercing by Babreek's arrow, the
non-believers term it as an unknown disease.

Baaj Singh whose dhani (house located in a field outside the residential
area of a village) is located about 150 metres from the tree, says he
shifted here from Ferozepore in 1950 when his family was allotted this land.
As a child of eight he used to accompany his father to the bir to graze
cattle late in the evenings. He said he and his father noticed that on
poornmashi (full moon day), their cattle got restless after hearing the
sound of hoofs. It was accompanied by a tinkling of bells that are generally
tied to a horse's neck. It appeared as if a horse was moving from the tree
towards a pond some distance away. On the bank of the pond is a mark which
resembles the mark of a hoof. Several other old villagers recount similar
experiences.

This tree stands in the middle of a bowl-shaped area which is believed to
have been a pond during the Mahabharata period. What remains of the pond is
now an old well built of small fired bricks. The well's water is no longer
fit for drinking. The well is surrounded on all sides by a round narrow
tunnel-like structure which has a small opening towards the west. The side
wall of the opening has a stone on which something has been carved. Nobody
has yet been able to decipher it. The carving has been damaged considerably
over the years and it is now hardly visible to the naked eye.

A long and narrow drain-like structure is built on the western side of the
well. It appears that in the days of yore travellers drank water from the
well while this drain quenched the thirst of their horses and other animals.
However, the purpose of the tunnel-like structure around the well continues
to be mystery. Baaj Singh remembers that as a child he used to enter the
tunnel for playing hide-and-seek. He said it had a hard floor. The roof and
the walls were plastered. The roof of the tunnel-like structure caved in the
last year.

The tree remained an enigma till 1973 when Pandit Ram Gopal, a Brahmin of
Hisar, began to see a peepul tree in his dreams. It had a well underneath it
and a supernatural power directed him to look for the tree. He tried to take
his mind off the dream but it continued to haunt him day after day until a
few friends offered to help him locate it. Their search led them to Bir
Babran where Baaj Singh's father and another Sikh woman Chann Kaur showed
him this peepul tree. The pandit took a vow of silence for a month and
started meditating under it.

Chann Kaur recalls that for a month he only drank a cup of cow's milk a day.
In the beginning she and other villagers suspected him of being a fraud.
However, they kept watch over him during the nights until they were
convinced that the pandit was not eating anything on the sly. After a month
the pandit passed on a written message to the villagers to dig the area
around the tree. The next day the villagers dug a pit and 20 feet below they
found the head of an idol made of black stone. Chann Kaur says the pandit
fell unconscious when he held it. The land belonged to the Indo-Australian
Sheep Breeding Farm which was run by Australians. As crowds began to throng
the tree, the worried farm officials physically removed the pandit and the
idol outside the farm. The idol was later temporarily shifted to the Rani
Sati Temple in Hisar awaiting its consecration in a temple. It continues to
be there since.

But the government never allowed a temple to be built. The idol still lies
at its temporary abode. Villagers say the Australians ordered labourers to
axe the tree and demolish the well. However, they claim, the farm hand
dropped dead after the first blow of the axe. Thereafter, every attempt to
fell it failed. It is learnt that officials argued with earthmover operators
to mow the tree down recently when the entire area was cleared of trees.
However, they refused to do so. The blessed tree is now more conspicuous
than ever before.

Hundreds of families which shifted from Hisar and surrounding areas to
Mumbai, Calcutta, Assam and Gujarat come here every year to offer prayers
and hoist red and yellow flags atop the tree. Brij Mohan Gupta, who is now
settled in Calcutta came here last week to hoist flags. He says he owes his
success in business to the blessings of the tree. His family,therefore,comes
here every year. He has been doing so for 20 years now. The villagers too
offer prayers at the tree, irrespective of their religions. Most of the
villagers are Sikhs who were allotted land here in the early fifties by the
then Punjab Chief Minister Partap Singh Kairon. But they pray here regularly
and want a temple built. There are many rich devotees who are willing to
foot the bill but the government is not prepared to give a chunk of land for
the purpose. Officialdom still treats the whole story as a hoax, yet no one
is willing to pass the death sentence on the tree.
