hey everyone.

a friend sends me pictures to my yahoo account. When I open her email,
all i see are the broken icons, this is using both firefox and safari.

I can view pics using my Mail app, I can also view the pics if i get on
my pc.

So i thought it was Yahoo, or one of those mac things, that we just live
with.

Well i was playing with a friends macbook, i was able to view the images
with no problem.

So it's my mac. i have a intel mac pro, 10.4.9, home folder transfered
from my dead G5, using Migration Assistant.

i will shortly create another user account, if i can see her images,
where should i start looking, in my home folder?

any help would be most appreciated

matt

jpeg

it can be from her camera, or a pic she downloaded from some random
site. thing is i see all other pics.

I do plan on doing a clean install of 10.5, hopefully that will take
care of the problem.
