So, does anyone on this list shop regularly at this store?

This store, to my recollection, never been all that great in terms of
their GF offerings -- seemingly never as good as the Carmel store.

But this week I had an appointment near St. V and decided to stop in
and get a few things.  The frozen items had but TWO packages of any
GF bread-type stuff.  One was a package of rolls and the other was a
very frosty old looking package of Glutino white bread.  Ugh.  They
had a few odd GF Amy's items, but just one package of Mac &amp; Cheese
and no Amy's GF pizzas.  That was IT.  The frozen foods manager was
right there, so I asked him about it, and he practically bit my head
off by saying, &quot;I don't have any room in these cases to carry any
gluten free items, so I don't.&quot;  Huh?  Boy, that made MY day.  (Guess
he wasn't having a very good day, himself!  But is this the new
&quot;Whole Foods&quot; attitude?  Wow -- that's hardly what I remember from
California!)

I finally found the &quot;GF&quot; section in the other part of the store,
which was just a tiny half-aisle (both sides) display.  They had an
OK selection, but I daresay my Kroger store has significantly more.
And many standards were pretty much missing.  There were no Whole
Foods GF breads whatsoever, not even their GF baking mixes.  No Whole
Foods GF anything, in fact.  All making the GF selection at Winding
Way look like a veritable Mecca.

So, perhaps I am blind, and there was much more there than I could
see.  But is this experience of others on the list?  I'd say, at this
point, I won't even waste my time going inside their doors.

It depends on the Kroger -- but amazingly, some do carry a pretty
good supply of GF foods.  In my store, it's in with the other health
and natural foods.  Meijer carries quite a few as well.  Marsh (at
least ours) has almost nothing.

I can say that the Kroger on 116th and Allisonville has a very disappointing, pitiful GF section.? They have some Bob's stuff but not much else.? And no matter how many time I ask about Amy's GF pizza, it never shows on the shelves.?

I live in Pendleton so it is a trip to go to Wild Oats at Nora so I go there
and then Trader Joe's.  I agree with you completely about no GF items.  I
had said before that I wouldn't go back since our Meijer's store in Anderson
has a lot more GF items at a lesser price.  Even our Marsh store in
Pendleton is starting to have more.  The Kroger in Anderson has a large
selection of GF and Organic items.
This last time I was at Wild Oats I said for sure I wouldn't go back.
Trader Joe's is not much better.
Well that's my opinion and you just happen to mention after I had been
there two days ago.  Evelyn

Hi Suzanne, I was there last Thursday and I have found the same
thing.  Nothing in the freezer section.  Not too much in the gluten
free section.  However, you do have to look around the store.  They
have these little gluten free signs and products are mixed in with the
regular products.  Like gf pasta is with the pasta.  GF crackers are
with the crackers.  I had been looking for buckwheat flour and I found
that with the regular flour.  As you said, Kroger has a lot of gf
products.  I have been disappointed with Wild Oats.  And their prices
are kind of high too.  No fresh baked goods like the stores in
California.

I used to shop at WO's Nora when I lived in the ripple.  The selection always seemed to be better in Carmel, but they still (for me, at least), had more gf offerings than anywhere else I went.  Their gf aisle I find to be a bit annoying actually :) ...  as there are plenty of other gf items spread throughout the store.  Some end up in the aisle and some don't.  I think its misleading to people, esp those getting started on the diet.  I haven't been to the Nora one since its switched over.  The one in Carmel has a great selection I think.  The prices aren't cheap of course, but I like the selection.  I think we will always have to dart across town to get what we want though...  how Meijer is the one place with S'better farms, another place has the tortillas I like, WO's only carries my favorite cookies...yadda yadda.  No such thing as &quot;one stop shopping&quot; for us Celiacs.

**A note too--remember many of the Whole Foods/365 brand products are gf, and often less expensive than the name brand natural foods products.

Suzanne--Have you been to the Whole Foods in Carmel yet?  Maybe you can play one off the other...they have quite a few of the whole foods bakery gf items.  I can say I don't keep great track of the bread items as I probably eat bread but a few times a year.  Cookies and cereal are probably my main gf items :)  It is funny how we each flock to certain stores!  I have been to Winding Ways twice--and one of those visits was before I was diagnosed!  :)  I do like Georgetown Market, but rarely get there b/c of location.

As for Kroger, the one at Keystone at 71/75th St area had a &quot;decent&quot; selection--some cereal, lundberg chips, amy's products.  The Kroger Signature at Hazel Dell and 146th is my favorite though--they have the best selection yet.  I go to Whole Foods once or twice a month, but Kroger has enough that I can rely on them weekly.  They have several of my soy/non-dairy products too, ie. whole soy co yogurt and turtle mountain 'ice creams.'

The Nora store had almost no 365 Brand items at all.  Whether GF or
otherwise.  It's like they somehow aren't &quot;on the program&quot; or
something.  And they all seem a little twitty about the whole thing.
I don't know if they are resentful of having to make changes, or if
Whole Foods isn't keeping them in the loop.  Whatever it is, it's
like shopping in a completely different store from Carmel -- even
more than it was before the merger.  Unfortunately, I don't get up to
Carmel that much -- Nora seems to be closer to other things I have to
do about town.  But I don't think I'll be going to Nora Wild Oats,

Shopping alternatives where we live, in Fishers, are pretty
slim.

I 100% agree with that!  Fishers could really use some sort of health food store or at least a good Kroger.  Every time I see a new retail place going up, I get hopeful.

The new Kroger at 146th and Hazel Dell (I think Jen mentioned it) is really good.  Our daycare is very close to there, so I can stop by if I really need something.  But, it is still a hike from Fishers.

I stopped going to the Nora Wild Oats a while back because the bagels I bought from there were moldy.   When I got home and opened up the bag only to see mold, I almost cried. I was so excited to get those stupid bagels too.  I should've taken them back, but Nora is out of my way, so I didn't ever make it.  I did call and complain, but I doubt it did much good.

I'm really ready for the new Whole Foods store!  I remember how nice they were when we lived in Chicago.  I hope this one is as nice!

I have been having problems ever since we moved into a new office area at work they have been slowly doing each floor.  The rug squares are glued down and the furniture is hard plastic.  My asthma went nuts we moved in Jan 21 and I had a biopsy done the 29th and they moved my stuff to a temp office building the company is renting until the 4th floor is done (April).
I ended up having to go back over to the third floor to have my review in my Jerk of a manager's OFFICE.  With in 15 min I was in bronchial cough dying and I had a paper towel over my mouth and noise the whole time trying to filter it some.
I left there and went to the doctors office and was seen 3 hours after being in the office for an hour.  I'll be on prednizone 3 days big dose and taking inhalers 4 times a day.

The biopsy from the 29th came back mild sprue acting up I have not eaten any gluten is there any studies tying breathing gluten to flair ups.  I hate to have to get a new job but this is crazy I can not breath they are hoping the smells will be gone by April.   long story sorry Janice Weeks

&gt; Subject: GF-Indy biopsy showed mild sprue

&gt; I have been having problems ever since we moved into a new office area at work
&gt; they have been slowly doing each floor.  The rug squares are glued down and the
&gt; furniture is hard plastic.  My asthma went nuts we moved in Jan 21 and I had a
&gt; biopsy done the 29th and they moved my stuff to a temp office building the
&gt; company is renting until the 4th floor is done (April).
&gt; I ended up having to go back over to the third floor to have my review in my
&gt; Jerk of a manager's OFFICE.  With in 15 min I was in bronchial cough dying and I
&gt; had a paper towel over my mouth and noise the whole time trying to filter it
&gt; some.
&gt; I left there and went to the doctors office and was seen 3 hours after being in
&gt; the office for an hour.  I'll be on prednizone 3 days big dose and taking
&gt; inhalers 4 times a day.

&gt; The biopsy from the 29th came back mild sprue acting up I have not eaten any
&gt; gluten is there any studies tying breathing gluten to flair ups.  I hate to have
&gt; to get a new job but this is crazy I can not breath they are hoping the smells
&gt; will be gone by April.   long story sorry Janice Weeks

Hi, Janice,

I do have an article about CD symptoms from inhaled gluten.  I will try
attaching it but I don't think that will post to the list, so I will send it
to your email address too.

Formaldehyde is another possible culprit.  My mother is very sensitive to
new carpet, apparently because of that.  No telling what chemicals they are
using.

Janice,

So sorry to hear about your asthma attacks and other
problems.  I know that literature says that CD lies
&quot;dormant&quot; (my word)...sometimes for years...until
triggered by various things...like infection,
sunlight, stress, etc.  So that may explain the lady
in Idaho.  But as for you...hmmm...that's interesting.
Any chance of any of the drugs that you took having a
&quot;bad starch filler&quot; in them?

Hope you're better now!!

Carla
