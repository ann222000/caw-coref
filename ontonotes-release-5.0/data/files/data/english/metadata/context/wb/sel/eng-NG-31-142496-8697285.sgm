Interview with William N. Thetford, PhD
New Realities Magazine: Sept/Oct 1984

An exclusive candid conversation with one of the two &quot;hidden personalities&quot;
behind the manifestation of one of the Century's most enigmatic and profound
spiritual thought systems - A Course In Miracles. Once a professed agnostic,
Dr. Thetford now openly discusses his secret role in scribing the Course and
how it personally affected him and his work in psychology, as well as the
prestigious positions he held as Professor of Medical Psychology at Columbia
University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, and as Director of the
Psychology Department at the Presbyterian Hospital in New York City.

NR:  As one of the two persons responsible for scribing &quot;A Course In
Miracles,&quot; what has been the impact of it on your life?

WT:  It has changed my life totally.  I recall typing the first fifty
principles on miracles that came through Helen Schucman in the fall of 1965,
and realized that if this material was true than absolutely everything I
believed would have to be challenged - that I would have to reconstruct my
whole belief system. At the time, however, I thought that would be
impossible; I didn't know how I could do it.  Yet I felt that was a
requirement, since the material that came through Helen in the beginning
phase seemed to authentic and genuine.  I went into shock for a brief
period, wondering how it would be possible to make such an abrupt change in
my perception of life and the world. Later I realized that God is merciful,
and does not ask us to make changes so abruptly, that there would be
adequate time to gradually begin to shift my perception.  I think what was
important was my willingness to change, not mastery of the material. And, of
course, I moved from the middle of Manhattan, where I had lived for
twenty-three years to Tiburon, California, something I thought would never
happen. I had settled into my routine as a New Yorker, and felt that the Big
Apple was the center of the Universe, and the place where I belonged.  That
move was probably the greatest cultural shock I have ever experienced,
making an abrupt transition from the turmoil of a hectic life in New York
City to the tranquility of Tiburon, California.  Eventually I left academia
as well.  First by retiring from my position as Director of the Psychology
Department at the Presbyterian Hospital of the Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center, and several years later retiring from my position as Professor of
Medical Psychology at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia
University.

NR:  Was that to devote full time to the Course, or to pursue other
interests?

WT:  A combination, I think.  After twenty years at Columbia I felt that it
was time to leave academia.  It seemed natural to leave when the Course was
published.

NR:  What exactly was your role in the scribing process of the Course?  Did
you hear a voice too?

WT:  Both Helen and I knew from the beginning that this was a collaborative
assignment, although I did not hear a voice.  While Helen heard the inner
dictation, she was incapable of transcribing the material directly herself,
since she found the content of the Course too threatening.  My role was to
offer the considerable support and reassurance needed each day for Helen to
continue her shorthand notebook recording.  She would then read the material
to me, and I would type it directly from her dictation.

NR:  Since the Course challenged your own belief and thought system too, why
didn't you just reject it, chuck it out?

WT:  Well, my intellect did rebel at times.  But I was the one who had asked
for &quot;another way&quot;, a better way, with regard to the extremely stressful
professional context in which Helen and I were trying to function.  When the
material in A Course In Miracles began coming, it was obvious to me that
this was the answer to my question, very clearly the answer.  So to reject
it or even disregard it was never even a consideration.

NR:  What specifically about it made it obvious to you that this was indeed
your answer?

WT:  Perhaps the fact that it was so totally different from the way I had
been operating throughout my life.  But the authenticity of the material
more than anything else struck me.  I knew that Helen had not made this up,
even with her very fertile imagination.

NR:  The authenticity. . ?

WT:  Well, the material was something that transcended anything that either
of us could possibly conceive of.  And since the content was quite alien to
our backgrounds, interests and training, it was obvious to me that it came
from an inspired source.  The quality of the material was very compelling,
and its poetic beauty added to its impact.

NR:  It seems quite unusual that you, an established psychologist holding
two very prestigious positions, would even consider embracing such material,
considering your training and the rigid tenets within academia to which you
no doubt subscribed and adhered.

WT:  I think if it had not been for many of the extraordinary experiences
that occurred during the summer of 1965, neither Helen nor I would have been
willing to accept the material she scribed.  You have reported some of those
experiences in these pages in the material from Robert Skutch's new book
&quot;Journey Without Distance, The Story Behind A Course In Miracles&quot;.  However,
our experience associated with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, was
not reported in &quot;New Realities.&quot;  Perhaps as much as anything, this series
of events crystallized the whole new direction that we would take.

NR:  The Mayo Clinic even occurred in September and didn't the Course begin
the next month in October?

WT:  Yes.  I had been asked to go to the Mayo Clinic and find out why they
made money on their psychological service operations, while at
Columbia-Presbyterian it seemed that we were always losing money.  I thought
I knew the answer to that question because we saw primarily clinic patients
who couldn't afford fees, and the patients at the Mayo Clinic were middle or
upper class and able to pay.  Nevertheless, it seemed this was an important
trip to make and I asked Helen to accompany me.  Just before we took off - I
think it was the night before - Helen had this very vivid image of a church,
which she described to me in great detail, she even made a sketch of it.  It
was an old church with a number of turrets and towers.  She thought it was
probably a Lutheran Church.  She was convinced that somehow we would see
that church from the airplane window as we were about to land in Rochester.
That, of course, seemed rather unlikely, since the airports I know aren't
built near churches.  Anyway, we kept our attention very closely focused on
the windows during landing, and much to Helen's disappointment and distress
no such church was visible.  In fact, Helen was so upset at not finding her
church that I didn't hold out much hope of accomplishing our business the
next day unless she could somehow be reassured.  Rather desperately I
suggested to Helen that we hire a taxi and see if we could find her church
anywhere in the Rochester metropolitan area.
So Helen and I went church hunting.  At first we thought we would confine
ourselves to Lutheran churches.  I think there were two of those, and
neither one was remotely like Helen's image.  Then we decided that we might
as well see all the other churches while we were at it.  I think there were
twenty-seven altogether in the environs of Rochester.  And not one of them
bore any resemblance to Helen's image.  Obviously, she was pretty crushed,
but we pulled ourselves together in preparation for the following day's
business.
The next day after we had successfully completed our survey, Helen and I
prepared to leave our hotel.  I went down to the lobby to wait for her with
the luggage, and noticing a newsstand I decided to get a paper.  Instead, I
saw a little booklet entitled, &quot;The History of the Mayo Clinic.&quot;  Thinking
it would be nice to have a souvenir of our visit, I purchased it for a
dollar.
As I leafed through it very quickly, I saw a picture of Helen's old church,
exactly as she had described it with all the turrets and towers.  It was
even a Lutheran church.  The only problem was that it had been razed and the
Mayo Clinic was actually built on the former site of this Lutheran church.
It was a very dramatic moment, and I was eager to share it with Helen.
When she came down, I said quickly, &quot;Helen you really weren't out of your
mind after all.  Your church was there but it's no longer around.  When you
thought you were looking down on it as from an airplane you were really
looking back through time.&quot;
Helen displayed a peculiar mixture of emotions.  On the one hand, relief
that she wasn't totally crazy, on the other hand, it was clear that she was
doing something which she regarded as highly paranormal, and this was an
area that made her very uncomfortable.
On our way back to New York, we had to change planes in Chicago.  While we
were sitting in the waiting room, Helen spied a young woman in the corner
reading a magazine and looking vaguely unhappy in the way people frequently
do when they are waiting for planes in airports.  I was surprised when Helen
said to me, &quot;See that young woman over there, she's really in serious
trouble - she's got a lot of problems.&quot;  Helen insisted that she would go
over and speak to this woman.  As it turned out the woman, whose name was
Charlotte, had never been on an airplane before.  She had flown on Ozark
Airlines to Chicago enroute to New York and was in a state of panic.  She
knew nothing about New York.  We later found out that she was leaving her
husband and two young children, and was in a state of great distress.
Charlotte was booked on the same plane as we.  During the flight, we sat on
either side of her, holding her hand, and trying to calm and

What methods of evaluation have you employed to ascertain that this
story is any more true or valid than those told by countless other
alleged &quot;healers&quot;, &quot;teachers&quot;, &quot;prophets&quot; and &quot;channellers&quot;?

What tests did this story pass that Gary Renard's, Benny Hinn's  or
Jachass Purr-sell's failed, for example?

Thanks in advance for your respect for my curious mind and right to
ask questions, it's very open-minded and equitable of you!
