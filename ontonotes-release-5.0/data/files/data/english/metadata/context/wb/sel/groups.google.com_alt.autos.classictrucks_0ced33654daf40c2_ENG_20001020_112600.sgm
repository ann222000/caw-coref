What is a good cleaner for getting grease and grime off of a garage floor?
Preferrably non flammable.
Thanks, Tom

"/> There is a product called CitraStrip I use it at the plating shop i
work at, The stuff smells like fast orange works in seconds, I don't
know if you can buy it where you are at but give it a look.

If you can get it in a consentrated form dilute it, it is an caustic
solution!

The citrus products work well, Home Depot sells a zep product
that is quite good. Castrol Super Clean is the best, 3X stronger than
Simple Green. Walmart carries Super Clean.

For a dry solution, use Floor Dry, comes in big
bags at auto parts stores, I get mine at Car Quest.
Needs to sit a while, but I've seen it pull a 5 year
old stain out of concrete, with no trace.
After all's spiffy, seal the floor good, then later spills
can be covered in Floor Dry, then swept up a few
minutes later. Gives good traction to the area while
it is on the floor, also.

SC2000 or 717J. Environmentally safe and does wonders. The alternative to
that is Simple Green.

I used to use cat litter in the gas station I worked at years ago. The only
way we found it to work is to sprinkle it around, turn the flat push-broom
upside down, and grind the stuff into powder then sweep it up. That's what
makes the difference. Dry litter by itself just doesn't absorb much.

Try a mixture of 50% water and 50% frozen orange juice. Don't laugh, it works.
We use it in commercial kitchens.
If it's a 10 oz. can of frozen orange juice, add 10 oz. of water to the
contents and mix. Mop onto the floor and let sit a little while. Obviously,
you will need to rinse it very good.

Quit snickering....it really works.

In my shop the drill is to drizzle a bit of solvent on the stain and scrub
it with the broom. Then sprinkle floor dry ( kitty litter) on the wet spot
to absorb both the solvent and the grease. I believe that the secret is to
loosen the stain with a cleaner and absorb with something.
