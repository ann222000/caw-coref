I dropped into one of my favourite bookshops and discovered on one of their
display tables, a book titled &quot;Mr Baggins&quot;, and supertitled &quot;The History of
the Hobbit&quot;.

I couldn't get it at the time because of budgetary considerations; has
anyone read it?

If you enjoyed &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; and would like to the process
by which the story evolved then yes. It's amazing to find again how much of
the final version was there at the beginning and how other parts appeared
at the 11th hour. I must buy the second part myself.

When it first came out, were there not reports of production problems
(missing pages, poor-quality paper)? It might be a good idea to leaf
through the copy you are planning to buy to make certain it is
complete and in good shape.

Yes, that was me moaning about faults in the paper stock. I returned the
copy to Amazon and was sent a blemish-free copy. Maybe I was unlucky but it
would be prudent to give any purchase a quick inspection.

Has the second part been published yet? I thought that wasn't for a few
months yet?

It's been out here in the UK for at least a month.

I haven't noticed any problems with the actual physical condition of
the book, but' I HAVE been surprised at the number of internal flaws
I've found. For instance, on page 459 of book one there is a note
indicating that details of the creation and insertion of the character
'Thrain the Old' could be found in, &quot;The Fourth Phase: The 1947
Hobbit, pp. 780, 788, &amp; 791... yet 'The Fourth Phase' ends at page
762. No problem I think, I'll just look it up in the index... but then
it turns out there is no entry for this character in the index. I did
eventually track it down to page 757 and thereabouts, but there are
alot of little things like this which serve as minor hurdles to use of
the text.

That aside, lots of interesting stuff in here. Rateliff doesn't have
quite the mastery of organizing and analyzing textual history which CT
developed by the later HoME volumes, but to all appearances he has
provided an exhaustive account of the materials and thus I'm sure it
will all get sorted out and assimilated into the body of collective
Tolkien knowledge eventually. Rateliff's commentary is extensive and
he provides alot of 'external' facts (brief plot summaries of texts
Tolkien described as inspirations, translations of names from the
Eddas, et cetera). I suspect THAT has been one of the major causes of
delay in publication... Rateliff seems to have tracked down nearly
every 'loose thread' and 'passing comment' to provide background
beyond the bounds of the story itself. While this book has long been
described as a sort of 'HoME for the Hobbit', now that I've had some
time to skim through it I'd say it has at least as much in common as
Hammond &amp; Scull's Reader's Companion as it does HoME.

I don't have a copy yet, so...

Was I right?  Was I right? :) (In particular, there was some issue
with my old Thrain essay where I came to a conclusion about the
textual history different from what pretty much everyone had assumed
up to that point; I'd need to look back in the essay to see what that
was.  But I'm interested in knowing whether the overall conclusion was
right, too.)

Heh.

Rateliff covers pretty much all of the various evidences we have
discussed in the past and (like CT and Anderson) states it as a given
that 'Thrain the Old' was created after the fact to explain the error
on the map. He lays out the case in exacting detail and has the
original draft texts available to back it up... showing where each
error was made and how it happened. However, the clincher for me is
that he also has it in JRRT's own words;

&quot;As for the actual runes in the book and your question p.p stands for
Thror son of Thrain. But that is an error that besides myself you
alone have spotted. On p. 202-3, the order is given as Thorin - Thrain
- Thror. The map-maker was confused and had the order Thorin - Thror -
Thrain. But even that was erroneous as dwarf-kings don't abdicate, and
the 'grandfather' was still alive when the map was made. In the sequel
it will appear that the grandfather Thror was son of an older King
Thrym (Thistlebeard). So that p.p stands for Thror Thrym's son.&quot;
-- JRR Tolkien, September 26, 1947 - previously unpublished letter to
Jennifer Paxman, responding to question about 'TH TH' runes on jar in
'Conversation with Smaug'

Tolkien says the map was in error both in the order of descent and in
stating that 'Here of old was Thrain King under the Mountain'...
because if 'Thrain' were the grandfather and thus still alive and King
when the map was made, then it couldn't have been 'of old'. He was
King at the time, not in the past. Clearly showing that the person
named on the map was meant to be Thorin's &quot;grandfather&quot;, and not some
distant ancestor.
