I doubt that such a thing should be done. Members are private by
default in C#, which is a good thing. If you are making everything
within a class public, you need to rethink your class design.

&quot;Encapsulation&quot;

&quot;Private members&quot;

&quot;Public properties&quot;

&quot;Property accessors&quot;

I wonder if any of these concepts have relevance here?

You might joke Andy, but I bet for a decent %% of this list, it is
their first experience of programming OO... or programming at all!

Gone are the days where you learned Assembly, then C, then C++, then
Java/ .NET, meaning (imo) that a lot of the fundamentals are &quot;glossed
over&quot; or omitted altogether!

I hear ya ... I started out in BASIC myself, over 20 years ago ... didn't
see dot notation until I played with JavaScript in the mid 90s, didn't even
begin to grok OO until 97, didn't REALLY start to grok OO until 2005. And to
this day, a lot of finer points elude me.

Have you tried using &quot;struct&quot;?

Also your question falls into the pattern of

1. I can't do this
2. But I want to

know ! :P
