Exactly, the transcript reveals that if it was a &quot;kangaroo&quot; court, they
couldn't have written better testimony themselves. Ron et al shot both
feet off on their own.

I found them as captivating and dramatic as we all wish, to the point of
sensationalizing for the fun of things, any kangaroo court with Macca, SF,
and FIA (I mean Max) should be!

Observations:

1. The people involved all seem to be be very intelligent people- keeping
all of the facts in play, organized arguments even in free discussion, etc.
(reading this page would be like taking a dip in a septic tank to them,
mentally)

2. PdlR and Ron did seem shoot themselves in the foot from a
perception/persuasion point of view.

3. While Mosley entered this last session clearly pre-dispositioned to find
McL guilty of infringements, the first hearing's conclusion seemed
appropriate.

4. All of the combatents have a very effective way of telling eachother
politely to f-off, amusingly.

5. McLaren's assertion that the information was not used by the team, rather
only be a rogue employee, was really problematic in light of PdlR's
testimony and Alonso's statements. At that point, the FIA could not say that
McLaren was innocent, as was their original argument. Perhaps if they got to
this in the original hearing, and premised the argument that no damage was
done to the sport as a result, they might have fared better, but not likely.
They got caught.

Except that the FIA seem blind to what is obvious to everyone else: that
what PdlR and FA were discussing was just the sort of
tittle-tattle/gossip/low-grade intelligence that you would expect in F1 all
the time, and unrelated to the 'dossier' of Ferrari 'secrets'.

Well I'm a member of  everyone else and I don't agree.  McLaren got caught
with their pants down.

Ron knows this and he's not prepared to piss the FIA off any more with an
appeal.  Clearly Vodaphone and Santander are sticking by McLaren and
stumping up the extra cash.

Seriously, did you read the transcripts? No one at McLaren denied that there
was a direct link to a Ferrari employee who was feeding relevant technical
secrets to an employee of McLaren.

It's reasonable to argue that it goes on all the time in some form or
another, but if you get caught with your hand in the cookie jar you take
your medicine. They clearly pushed the limits in this case. Talk is talk.
Email exchanges to download whatever information you'd like via a rival team
members' openly breaking standard business laws is another.

How is this different from an employee of one team who goes to another
team the next year?

Because that would be an employee of one team who went to another team the
next year. Really, do you need someone to explain the difference to you?

What is different about the final result though?  Is the team the
employee went to guilty of possessing confidential information from
the other team?
