At first glance, the ring  around his eye might make you think of Petey, the
Little Rascals' canine  companion. When you hear his name though - Hoss - you
might think of Hoss  Cartwright, the &quot;gentle giant&quot; character on the western
television series  Bonanza that was always seen wearing a brown vest while
blurting out  expressions like &quot;dadburnit&quot; and &quot;dangumit.&quot; OK - so maybe I'm aging
myself,  but whatever connection you make to this sweet little Australian
Cattle  Dog, I hope he'll steal your heart just like he has the staff and
volunteers at the Grayson County Humane Society/SPCA in Leitchfield,  KY.

A stunning, stubby-tailed, stray found running  around town back in April of
2007 (yep - almost one year ago), Hoss is described as a &quot;sweet, people-loving
dog that just  wants to give kisses and hugs.&quot; You can see for yourself by
watching one of his videos at  _ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErCobaOgIMU_
( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErCobaOgIMU ) . This boy is a serious and willing
student who just aches to learn new things. He  keeps his kennel clean  and
he doesn't pull on the leash when he's taken out to one of the fenced-in
fields to run and play. Although he arrived at the shelter with a slightly  damaged
eye, it was treated and no longer seems to be a  problem.

Estimated to be at  least three-years-old, this precious pooch needs a job to
keep him busy  or he becomes bored, as you can see in his other video at
_ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4EY-qPmJU_
( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4EY-qPmJU ) . If the video is  too dark for you to see what's happening, what
you'll hear is a common  occurrence at the shelter - as the shelter staff and
volunteers describe it,  &quot;Sometimes when you arrive at the shelter, you'll hear a
metal banging and  scraping. When you go to investigate, it will be Hoss
tossing his food bowl  around. It's the toy that he prefers over everything else we
have to offer  him.&quot; This poor boy either loves to entertain those who take
care of him or  he's going stir crazy and he's trying to entertain  himself.

Being in a kennel for almost a year, while  life-saving, is simply no place
for a working boy like Hoss. The only reason this handsome fellow has lingered
so long is  probably due to the fact that he doesn't like other male dogs and
he plays a  little too rough with the ladies (he herds them around, which
tends to scare  most of them). More than likely, cats also probably shouldn't be a
part  of Hoss' world. Even with all of these strikes against him for
successfully  finding a rescue or a loving home, the folks at Grayson have persevered
at  trying to make just such a miracle happen for this loving little  guy.

Already neutered, vaccinated, and partially sponsored,  this boy is available
for adoption or rescue for only $50. If you're interested in finding out more
about Hoss, willing to  sponsor his $50 adoption/rescue fee, or if you  have
a home - or better yet, a FARM - where he can burn off some  energy and help
you round up the barnyard animals,  please send an email to
_dwh ... @aggressiveonline.net_ (mailto:dwh ... @aggressiveonline.net)   (@aggressiveonline.net) or
call  270-230-8839. You can also check out his somewhat outdated Petfinder file
at _ http://search.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=10172457_
( http://search.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=10172457 ) .

Please don't  let distance prevent you from rescuing or adopting Hoss. The
Grayson  County Humane Society has an incredibly dedicated group of volunteers
who not  only donate their time and energy to transport these furry angels, but
whom  also often pay for such life-saving journeys out of their own pocket
(although  a donation for gas is ALWAYS appreciated).

The name Hoss is actually a Swedish word that signifies &quot;big in  stature and
big in spirit.&quot; While this Hoss might not be  a big package, he IS big in
spirit. It would be a shame to see such  a spirit come to an early end, much like
it did for Dan Blocker, the actor  that played the kind-hearted, animal-loving
Hoss on  Bonanza. Please help this furry lovable Hoss find his own special
Ponderosa where he'll be the &quot;Boss Hoss&quot; and where he can enjoy a long,  happy
life.

-------------------------------------------------------

This speckled  sensation is in need of job to earn his keep (or so he
thinks). If you need a  ranch hand, Hoss would LOVE to apply for the position!
Unemployed for almost a  year now, he can start work IMMEDIATELY.

So he'd be prefer to be  an only dog......he's got enough love and energy to
fill your life as if you  owned 20 dogs! As Hoss on Bonanza would have said,
&quot;DADBURNIT - someone give this feller' a chance to prove  himself worthy of
being the Top Dog!!!&quot;

These posts are sent out by me as a  small way to try to help those in need.
They are NEVER meant to upset those  who cannot offer assistance.

Please know that I thank each and every one of  you
who works so  tirelessly doing what you do on a never-ending  basis.
