Do I know you? So does anyone know if the new game real and if it lags like
the rest of BF games. Did the people of BF also worked with the people of
DC? Like they did to make BF2. When is ET2 coming out? Its been sometime now
and I thought its soon.

Trevor you live on campus!!! How is that? Can you drink on campus? We just
switched some of our on-campus housing to allow drinks. We also just added a
beergarden and tail gate parties. Hmm weird but I guess their are trying to
get people to the football games. HA. When is the new eps of Family Guy?
Next Sunday?
