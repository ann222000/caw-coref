Sorry for the double post if it occurred.

Hey Coach,

I just went back to my old school and now that I just finished college,
considered taking up an offensive assistant position there. The head coach
was showing me his offensive system, running the single wing. I was curious
if you had ever played against a single wing offense, and if so how you
defended it with what success. Any info would be appreciated.

Thanks
Ryan

True single wing offense with an emphasis on counters, inside traps and buck
sweeps, or some bastardization of it?
In thirty years, we've played against every type of offensive system that
you can imagine.
Send me his three bread and butter plays with the blocking schemes and I'll
tell you how most coaches will defend it.

That's the one. Based on Ken Keuffel's system from way back when.

Its a Total Running formation the QB actually blocks as much as the FB. The
HB gets the ball 90% of the time on a direct snap from center and the strong
side is totally overloaded with "Wingbacks" which can be seen as tightends,
at least the version we ran. I played both HB and FB in the single wing in
JR Pee Wee football (8-10 yearolds, altho it went by weight too). It was
installed because kids that young can't throw the ball. If i'm correct it
was the in vogue formation before the T formation. Funny thing is the QB is
basically just a signal caller and blocker, at least in the old school
version.

Thanks, Iommi. I got the basic rundown on the system, but was more curious
as to how a defensive coordinator would approach scheming against, as coach
calls it, their bread and butter plays, so I could further solidify the
system in my mind by working out a way to beat that scheme (punch, counter
punch).

True. The T formation swept most the NFL in the 1940s. The Steelers
were the last to adopt it and still used the single wing as late as the
mid 1950s.

Actually, I read about that before I grew all my teeth. Don't mention
teeth right now, Coach. I just had a root-canal. It was almost as
miserable as watching the Cowboys win.
