Dear Narasimhaye,
I a have posted things before and hello to everyone in the group. I
have a dear friend that is quite ill she was born with osteo rheumatory
arthritis She has since developed diabetes and is in terrible pain. Recently
she had a double hernia operation and I feel as if stress is eating her
alive. She lived a very abusive life in her earlier years. She is very
devoted to the Supreme Being and prays daily. I was wondering if you could
please make a recommendation not just for her but as a learning experience
for many.
For those who know me I have experienced great, great success with the
rudraksha beads. This is a wonderful society and everyone here is so very
kind and helpful. Thank you for all you do.
Ommmmmmmmmmm
Kevin

Namaste dear Kevin, yes remember you, welcome back !  So sorry to hear
of your friend's condition, pain, having developed diabetes, a double
hernia operation and high stress levels.  Its great to know that despite
all her sufferings, she is still devoted to the Supreme Being and prays
everyday.

Please ask her to listen to Mahamrityunjaya Mantra everyday as much as
possible. This Mantra is Lord Shiva's Moksha Mantra and it saves from
many things in samsara. When played, the holy words resound around the
house and seep into the listening person/s subconscious being/s. They
help on a subtle and unseen level. To what extent and speed of recovery
(if any), will depend on the person's past life karmas. Even if it does
not help or results not seen at once, they nevertheless guides a person
onto Moksha (Liberation in many aspects including those of sad childhood
traumas) or at least peace of mind along the way.

When traumas and stress were not released but held in for far too many
years, they result in different ailments in different parts of the body
or organs. Its therefore also important for your friend to seek therapy,
supportive counselling or open up to someone who is patient, kind,
understanding and able to listen to her for a few hours each time they
visit. These will also help tremendously too.

A person who is ill, mostly feels lonely or isolated without even
knowing it sometimes, and if they do know it, they are unable to express
it verbally. Therefore sentivity and care, kind words and assistance
never go astray especically when they have been so beaten along the way
since childhood and formative years. The persons who are willing to help
her without condition or expecting anything back, will be doing good
dharma (you too Kevin).

As time goes, your friend will have an impression of the words. Then
she can begin recitation by following the tape or CD to learn it.  Later
on when she is ready, she can recite it without following the tape or
CD.  Please try to perform the version that has the Gayatri 'covering' :

Om Hoom Joom Saha, Om Bhu Bhuvah Swaha
Om Triyambhakam Yajamahey, Sugadhim Pushti Vardanam
Uruvarukamiva Bandhanan, Mrityor Mukshiya Mamritat
Om Swaha Bhuvah, Bhu Om Saha
Joom Hoom Om.......

Would also like to suggest Rudraksh Mat and a Personal Mala for your
friend.  They are last a lifetime when properly maintained with oiling.
Shall post a message later with details about Rudraksh mat for you to
read.

A Personal Mala will take into account her details and will be
recommended accordingly.  For info about Personal Mala, please send an
Enquiry to: http://www.rudraksha-ratna.com/sendEnquiry.php

Namaste Kevin, for your perusal :

Made of approx 3950 beads of chikna smooth beads of size 9mm.
Comfortable to sit on for meditation.
Purpose: Serves as an aid for curing illness. When unwell, lying on
rudraksha mat is amazingly helpful for painful physical parts and for
mental soothing. The beads help massage aching body parts and due to
electro magnetic properties assist in speeding up recovery. A cloth may
be placed over the mat before lying on it or directly one may lie on it.
This also maybe be placed in altar or an auspicius area for adding grace
and beauty.

Namaste Kevin, more info for you to read and decide. Or please also ask
your friend to read it.  This info is from previous discussions about
Rudraksha Mat and Mattress in this Group :

Rudraksha Mat and Mattress

As a step forward towards Rudraksha Therapy rudraksha beads can also be
used as a mat for curing various sorts of illness and as an aid in
meditation.

Presenting some extracts of the conversation on
RudrakshaBeadsSocietiesClub:
The benefits of Rudraksha Mat and Mattress:
* When unwell, lying on rudraksha mat is amazingly helpful for
painful physical parts, mentally soothing.     * Once a person gets used
to if after a few days, the mattress actually feels very comfortable and
comforting.      * The beads also help massage injuries and due to
electro magnetic properties, assists in speeding up recovery.       *
The rudraksha mattress keeps the body warmth in.      * The mat for
sitting on during meditation, is also great. It would take some people a
bit of time to get used to sitting on a rudraksha mat when doing asanas.
Its most comfortable and just perfect for my needs. It differs from
individual to individual of course.      * In chronic pain or who had
undergone major surgery due to severe injuries.      * Those who are
seriously into meditation will find the mat or mattress particularly
conducive to their states of minds, being the Witness, rather than the
"player".      *
Heightens meditation and helps one focus, stopping the mind's "chatter"
that distracts or interrupts the jiva during serious meditation
sessions.
* They can also be used as seats (made in smaller size) for Murtis on
altars or sewn onto clothing for deities with upa-ratna (semi-gemstones
or crystals).

Myths:

*
Please do not insult the spiritual believes of people by raising topics
like making rudraksha mat or mattress. If you believe that rudraksha is
holy and has spiritual power then how come some one think of preparing a
mattress with that ?
*
I am of the opinion that it is not fair to use Rudraksha mat or mattress
or blanket for sleeping or sitting purpose  since we respect rudraksha
bead like Lord Shiva himself.  We also set rudraksha in our holy altar
for worshipping purpose.  Please do not insult our holy feelings and
rudraksha especially.

Facts:

*
I think if the beads are used for the right purposes it is fine, mat or
whatever. I am of the opinion that Shiva loves the aspirant more then
the beads, would the almighty Shiva refuse to help his beloved if they
were in need? If we study the scriptures about exalted beings we can see
many acts of mercy and kindness. If someone is ill, why should they not
use the beads as a mat? The beads are a vehicle for realisation, they
are not the realisation itself, nothing wrong with respecting them, but
if it ties down your consciousness, and you fail to see the supreme
oneness of all things, then we have failed to realise their true
purpose.
*
The Tears of Lord Shiva is meant by the Lord to relieve Mankind of
suffering and misery. Rudraksha contains natural electromagnetic and
other healing properties. They are also used in Ayurvedic medicine. If
someone is in great pain and suffering due to physical injuries and no
chance to get well, they cry to the Lord to help them. Those who have
been in accidents that resulted in a choice between life and death, the
Lord comes to the rescue. By sitting or lying on rudraksha mats does not
mean that a person is insulting Lord Shiva or Lord Rudra.
*
If the person gets well from doing this, then it shows Lord Shiva has
given His Blessings for this person to recover and continue with dharma
and seva as well as other unfinished spiritual works in this lifetime.
If Lord Shiva felt insulted, do you think He will give blessings for
this person to get well? Of course not. Hence, it shows the Lord does
not discriminate what way or how a sincere devotee performs their
worship. If the Bhakti is in the person who is lying on rudraksha beads
due to not being able to move (paralyzed), Lord Shiva knows and hears,
then He blesses. Then the person resumes normal life after a healing
period from the rudraksha mat or mattress.

A Small Tale to disregard the Myths

This situation kind of reminds me of the story of Dhanna. who saw God
incarnate many times and was able to converse with him. One day he asked
the lord, is there anyone who loves you more than me? The lord replied
there are many who love me more. But be warned if you ask this question
both of us will cease to exist. The lord instructed him to go to a place
where he would find such a soul. Dhanna went to the place as instructed,
but turned away in dismay, when he saw the Sadhu standing with one foot
on a stone, and in deep samadhi. Dhanna had used a similar stone as his
Guru, and was saddened to see a person with his foot on his 'Guru'.
Dhanna replied to the lord, but he is standing upon my Guru how can he
be a lover of the Lord? The Lord told Dhanna to go back to the same
place and the Sadhu would enable Dhann to see the Lord in all things. He
went back and inquired as to why the Sadhu had his foot on the stone.
The Sadhu replied 'Dhanna, I behold the lord in all things, the i-am
ness within me has vanished, there is no-one else but the Lord left, so
who has his foot on who?" This enabled Dhanna to be fully realised and
God incarnate himself. I don't think everyone can be like Dhanna, but
this is really the goal of life.

If rudraksha are the tears of Shiva and given to mankind out of the
Lord's Grace, it would seem that they should be used for the welfare of
mankind to heal the pains of the body. All is based on motive. If one's
motive is of love and to serve, how can the rudraksha be abused when
used in this way ???
