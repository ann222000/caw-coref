I have a Boston Gazette No. 779 - Monday - March 12, 1770,
detailing what later became known as the Boston Massacre,
in what I would say is fair to average condition. Anyone have
an idea as to its worth and where I might sell it. Thanks.

The Boston Massacre occurred in September, 1978 when my beloved Yankees
thrashed and swept the BoSox in Boston nearly completing their
come-from-behind 15-1/2 game defecit on the way to yet another World Series
title.

Seriously, though, try HCA auctions bobn ... @aol.com

They conduct periodic Americana auctions and one of their founders, Eric
Caren, is an early newspaper specialist.

good luck,
