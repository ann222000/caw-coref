"Curiosity is one of the permanent and certain characteristics of a
vigorous mind."
-- Samuel Johnson

"What spirit is so empty and blind, that it cannot recognize the fact
that the foot is more noble than the shoe, and skin more beautiful
than the garment with which it is clothed?"
-- Michelangelo

"Most of our obstacles would melt away if, instead of cowering before
them, we should make up our minds to walk boldly through them."
-- Orison Swett Marden

"We are all born ignorant, but one must work hard to remain stupid."
-- Benjamin Franklin

=============

Where I live in Missouri, the Spring progression is well underway.  The
magnolias have peaked, and the redbud trees are coming on strong.  The
closest tree outside my window has gone from swelling buds to maple
whirligig seeds in a few days.  How does it know how to do that?  Iran
and Britain have been in dispute about the location of some ships.
Both claim to be right, but at the same time the waters in question are
in dispute.

It depends on which map you are using, and who drew the map.  Is the
problem about GPS location, or where is the boundary, and if there is
dispute about the boundary, maybe both are wrong.  I see so many issues
in the world as disputed boundaries, disputed maps and maybe many are
wrong if they do not see that they may not have all the answers and that
there are shades of grey like understanding that there is no agreed
internationally recognized boundary.

Even with all the human caused problems in the world, there is also
amazing talent and insight.  Here are some things which impressed me in
recent days.  And thanks to all who made these links possible.  Perhaps
you will be inspired to find a cheap bucket and cut a hole in the
bottom.  I know I am.

Conversation about Nature

God: Frank, you know all about gardens and nature; what in the world is
Going On down there in the U.S.? What happened to the dandelions,
violets, Thistles And the stuff I started eons ago? I had a perfect
no-maintenance garden Plan. Those plants grow in any type of soil,
withstand drought, and multiply With Abandon. The nectar from the
long-lasting blossoms attracts butterflies, Honeybees, And flocks of
songbirds. I expected to see a vast garden of color by now. All I see
are patches of green.

St. Francis: It's the tribes that settled there, Lord. They are called
The Suburbanites. They started calling your flowers "weeds" and went to
great Lengths to kill them and replace them with grass.

God: Grass? But it is so boring, it's not colorful. It doesn't attract
Butterflies, bees or birds, only grubs and sod worms. It's temperamental
With Temperatures. Do these Suburbanites really want grass growing
there?

St. Francis: Apparently not, Lord. As soon as it has grown a little,
they Cut It....sometimes two times a week.

God: They cut it? Do they bale it like hay?

St. Francis: Not exactly, Lord. Most of them rake it up and put it in
Bags.

God: They bag it? Why? Is it a cash crop? Do they sell it?

St. Francis: No sir, just the opposite. They pay to throw it away.

God: Now let me get this straight...they fertilize it to make it grow
and When it does grow, they cut it off and pay to throw it away?

St. Francis: Yes, sir.

God: These Suburbanites must be relieved in the summer when we cut back
On The rain and turn up the heat. That surely slows the growth and saves
Them a lot Of work

St. Francis: You aren't going to believe this Lord, but when the grass
Stops Growing so fast, they drag out hoses and pay more money to water
it so They Can continue to mow it and pay to get rid of it.

God: What nonsense! At least they kept some of the trees. That was a
Sheer Stroke of genius, if I do say so myself. The trees grow leaves in
the Spring to Provide beauty and shade in the summer. In the autumn they
fall to the Ground And form a natural blanket to keep the moisture in
the soil and protect The Trees and bushes. Plus, as they rot, the leaves
become compost to enhance the soil It's a Natural circle of life.

St. Francis: You'd better sit down, Lord. As soon as the leaves fall,
the Suburbanites rake them into great piles and pay to have them hauled
away.

God: No way! What do they do to protect the shrubs and tree roots in the
Winter to keep the soil moist and loose?

St. Francis: After throwing the leaves away, they go out and buy
Something Called mulch. They haul it home and spread it around in place
of the Leaves.

God: And where do they get this mulch?

St. Francis: They cut down the trees and grind them up to make mulch.

God: Enough! I don't want to think about this anymore. Saint Catherine,
You're in charge of the arts. What movie have you scheduled for us
Tonight?

St. Catherine: "Dumb and Dumber," Lord. It's a really stupid movie
About.... God: Never mind--I think I just heard the whole story from
Saint Francis!

An Irish woman of advanced age visited her physician to ask his
help in reviving her husband's libido.

"What about trying Viagra?" asks the doctor.

"Not a chance," she said. "He won't even take an aspirin!"

"Not a problem," replied the doc. "Give him an Irish Coffee Viagra.
Drop it into his coffee. He won't even taste it. Give it a try and call
me in a week to let me know how things went."

It wasn't a week later that she called the doctor, who inquired
as to progress.

The poor dear exclaimed, "Oh, faith, bejaysus and begorrah!
T'was horrid. Just terrible, doctor!"

"Really? What happened?" asked the doctor.

"Well, I did as you advised and slipped it in his coffee and the
effect was almost immediate. He jumped hisself straight up, with a
twinkle in his eye and with his pants a-bulging fiercely! With one swoop
of his arm, he sent the cups and tablecloth flying, ripped me clothes to
tatters and took me then and there, making wild, mad, passionate love to
me on the tabletop! It was a nightmare, I tell you, an absolute
nightmare!"

Why so terrible?" asked the doctor. "Do you mean the sex your
husband provided wasn't good?"

"Oh, no, no, no, Doctor, the sex was fine indeed! Twas the best
sex I've had in 25 years!

But sure as I'm sittin' here, I'll never be able to show me face
in Starbucks again!

Gardening tip from valued contributor Nikki:

For those of you who are interested in gardening.  This is not a picture
of my crop, mine are recently planted and much smaller.  But they are
growing great.
http://img471.imageshack.us/img471/7605/gardentipxh4.jpg

This is what I am doing with the tomatoes, peppers and cukes.  It works
with flowers, as well.  I am using cheap buckets from the Dollar Store
with a hole cut in the bottom.  Makes a tasty and useful yard
decoration.  I have 13 buckets hanging right now and it is sure going to
save my back and hoeing time!  They actually have this unit for sale on
the net for $15 US, but so silly when a cheap bucket of any kind works
great.

You can water, feed, trim and harvest without bending or kneeling-and
since your crop is upside down and will never touch the ground, staking,
caging, bacteria, ground rotting, fungus and small animals become
problems of the past.
