'07 draft class progress ranks behind previous years

By Tom Pelissero
tpeli ... @greenbaypressgazette.com

Ted Thompson's strength-in-numbers approach to the NFL draft produced 19
first-year contributors out of 23 picks in his first two seasons as Green
Bay Packers general manager.

Nearly three weeks into training camp, Thompson's third wave of rookies is
only slightly off that pace. Seven of its 11 members are close to locking up
roster spots, and an eighth is in a one-on-one battle for place-kicking
duties.

But Thompson's willingness to gamble on potential in Year 3 makes it
unlikely this year's class will match the five full- or part-time rookie
starters who emerged last season.

Only second-round pick Brandon Jackson is atop the depth chart at his
position, and his ascension owes as much to injuries as anything he's
flashed in camp. The clearest standout, third-rounder James Jones, is locked
in as the No. 3 receiver.

The Packers' other Day 1 picks, first-rounder Justin Harrell and
third-rounder Aaron Rouse, are being brought along slowly and have worked
mostly with the third string at their respective positions. Fourth-round
pick Allen Barbre is all but guaranteed a spot as well, but only an injury
would get him into the lineup.

&quot;We think it's a pretty good group of people that we're dealing with,&quot;
Thompson said this week. &quot;As players, they're all competing and trying. Some
are probably having more success than others, but I think at the end of the
day it's going to be a pretty good group.&quot;

The emergence of all three sixth-round picks - linebacker-turned-fullback
Korey Hall, linebacker Desmond Bishop and kicker Mason Crosby - might be the
best story out of this class so far. Their ability to stick around in coming
seasons will be more telling about the success of Thompson's strategy.

Terrence Murphy, Mike Hawkins and Will Whitticker are gone from the 2005
class, and some combination of safety Marviel Underwood, offensive lineman
Junius Coston and defensive end Michael Montgomery could join them by the
final cutdown Sept. 1. The same goes for some of last year's selections,
including safety Tyrone Culver and quarterback Ingle Martin.

Numbers are only as good as the strength of the final 53.

First round

16. Justin Harrell, DT, Tennessee

Listed as the starter opposite veteran Ryan Pickett on the initial depth
chart, Harrell showed up for training camp overweight and rarely has worked
with the starting defense in practice.

While coaches knew their top draft pick needed time to reach game speed - he
missed most of his senior season because of a ruptured biceps tendon and sat
out all contact periods during offseason practices - he's done little the
past three weeks to push Corey Williams, Colin Cole and Johnny Jolly for
first-team reps. He did have a sack in Saturday's preseason opener at
Pittsburgh, but it came against the Steelers' third-stringers.

&quot;He's young, just getting warm,&quot; defensive coordinator Bob Sanders said. &quot;I
think he's shown the ability to be able to anchor.&quot;
That's what the Packers are counting on, even if Harrell only sees spot duty
early this season.

Second round

63. Brandon Jackson, RB, Nebraska

Vernand Morency's knee injury the first day of camp thrust Jackson, the
consolation prize after the Packers missed out on Marshawn Lynch in the
draft's first round, into a featured role.

Jackson ran for 57 yards on 16 carries in his preseason debut, but most of
those yards came late in the third quarter. He did flash his cutback ability
on one of his two long runs, breaking two tackles and almost escaping a
third.
&quot;We liked what we saw on tape,&quot; offensive coordinator Joe Philbin said.
&quot;Early on, there wasn't a whole lot there, but I thought he ran with pretty
good pad level, took good care of the football.&quot;

Morency's extended absence will give Jackson plenty more opportunities to
showcase his skills - and perhaps secure the starting job, if his
pass-blocking improves - the next couple weeks. How Jackson's body holds up
under the added workload will be a factor.

Third round

78. James Jones, WR, San Jose State

89. Aaron Rouse, S, Virginia Tech

Jones has been the breakout star of camp, leading all receivers in practice
receptions and recording a game-high six for 58 yards in the preseason
opener. His emergence quickly elevated him to the No. 3 receiver spot behind
Donald Driver and Greg Jennings, who both should benefit from the rookie's
steady play.

&quot;The more weapons that you have at your disposal, obviously, the better your
chances are of . eliminating double coverages,&quot; Philbin said. &quot;We certainly
hope that (when) you go in a three-receiver set, you want every one of those
guys to be a viable option.&quot;

Rouse has been far less noticeable, save for a couple of big hits and an
interception early in camp. He's played a couple snaps alongside starting
free safety Nick Collins, though, and could make an impact in subpackages -
if not as an immediate starter - once coaches feel he's grasped the base
defense.

&quot;He's got good toughness, and he's going to be a physical player,&quot; secondary
coach Kurt Schottenheimer said. &quot;He's bright. He understands what he's
doing. He just needs playing experience in National Football League games.&quot;

Fourth round

119. Allen Barbre, OL, Missouri Southern State

The former Division II all-America played left tackle exclusively in
college, but coaches say they're pleased with his transition to left guard.

Mastering the inside technique could make Barbre a valuable reserve in the
regular season, especially if an injury to left tackle Chad Clifton forces
left guard Daryn Colledge to protect the edge. Coaches have experimented
with that alignment when Clifton has sat out morning practices in camp.

&quot;As a backup, if he is a backup, inevitably, there probably is going to be
some shuffling (of positions), because that's just the way it is,&quot; Philbin
said.

Philbin said Barbre played &quot;a little high&quot; in the preseason opener but
improved as the game went on. He's a near lock to make the roster.

Fifth round

157. David Clowney, WR, Virginia Tech

A college track star, Clowney must make the most of his speed on special
teams - both as a kick returner and coverage gunner - to crack the 53-man
roster, because he's not a consistent receiver.

&quot;He's not at the stage of his career where he's doing everything right
fundamentally,&quot; Philbin said. &quot;Sometimes, he's not at the proper depth, or
he may not read the coverage exactly the way you'd like him to. But he also
kind of has that knack of sometimes he's making a play even when maybe it's
not exactly how you coach it.&quot;

Clowney had the Packers' longest kickoff return Saturday and probably would
have gained more than 24 yards if he hadn't tripped over a teammate. He'll
get another chance alongside Shaun Bodiford in this week's exhibition
against the Seattle Seahawks.

Both players are competing against each other and Will Blackmon, who will
return a punt and kick Saturday night. As of now, Bodiford has the edge on
Clowney.

Sixth round

191. Korey Hall, FB, Boise State

192. Desmond Bishop, LB, California

193. Mason Crosby, K, Colorado

Drafting two little-known linebackers and a kicker was a surprising move in
April, but it looks pretty good now.

Hall started the preseason opener in Brandon Miree's absence; Bishop has all
but replaced Abdul Hodge as the No. 2 middle linebacker behind Nick Barnett;
and Crosby appears to have a slight edge on incumbent Dave Rayner.

The last time three Packers players drafted in the same round all made the
team was 2000, when Mark Tauscher, Charles Lee and Eugene McCaslin arrived
in the seventh. (A fourth player, Rondell Mealey, didn't see action as a
rookie but later played two seasons in Green Bay, while a fifth, Ron Moore,
never played for the team.)

Hall and Bishop play on several special teams, too, meaning Crosby's spot is
the most in doubt. His 52-yard field goal Saturday reminded special teams
coordinator Mike Stock of Rayner's 44-yard winner in December against the
Minnesota Vikings.

&quot;Right now, I think they're dead (even) and they're both great competitors,
and I think they both can kick in the league,&quot; Stock said. &quot;It'll take the
next few ballgames and practices to determine it, but practice kicks are
just as important.&quot;

Seventh round

228. DeShawn Wynn, FB, Florida

243. Clark Harris, TE, Rutgers

From his calf to his stomach to his quadriceps, Wynn has struggled to prove
he's past his injury-prone, inconsistent college days. But Harris' failure
to make any impact at one of the Packers' thinnest position has been equally
disappointing.

A productive receiver for the Scarlet Knights, Harris hasn't shown much in
camp. His most memorable play came Monday, when he beat Rouse deep only to
have Brett Favre's perfectly thrown pass awkwardly bonk off his hands.

&quot;I don't know that he's had quite as many opportunities as those guys yet,&quot;
Philbin said. &quot;His thing's going to be when he gets the chance in the
offensive system in the preseason.&quot;

Harris also has shown no consistency as a long snapper, and his chances for
making the roster don't seem strong. The same goes for Wynn unless he gets
over his latest injury before Morency and P.J. Pope return from theirs.
