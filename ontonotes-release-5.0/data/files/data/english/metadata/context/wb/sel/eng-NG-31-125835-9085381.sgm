Hi,
Can anyone recommend anywhere in the UK to learn plastering properly?

You're local college for the theoretical knowledge and basic practical
skills on a years full time course and then find an employer willing to pay
you to continue your college training part time whilst picking up the
'specialist knack' doing the job - in simple terms a modern day
apprenticeship!

Look for a local college that does building trades.
They will probably offer anything from a couple of days
course, up to the full City and Guilds, depending what
you want to do. I did an excellent 2-day course at the
Aldershot Building Centre (no longer exists), which gave
me the skills to replaster my house, and you'll find you
are in great demand amongst friends for doing the odd
bit of plasterwork for them.

I have had some plastering done recently, I have also tried my hand at
it.
The first plasterers were poor and were sent packing after 1 1/2 days.
the second plasterer gave a price of £3k + materials to plaster a
large 2 storey extension which sounded expensive at the time, but the
results are outstanding. 3 weeks in all for man + labourer so good
value. He has been plastering for 35 years and his experience shows
through in fantastic surface finish and detailing.
What I am saying is that if you want some good plaster finished in
your house use a well experienced contractor.
If you want to take up the trade then as Brian says you need to learn
alongside a 'master'.  Also don't forget that it is hard physical
labour, you can't stop midway through, and as you get older it will
takes its toll on your body!

This doesn't quite match my experience. In doing up a house,
I found it took ages to get anyone to come and plaster a
couple of rooms. Several times I had someone booked, and then
they would let me down at the last minute as a builder offered
them 5 houses to do, and they never turn down that sort of
work. Eventually I got two rooms done, and realised it was
going to take years to get the whole house done at that rate.
I'd tried my own hand at plastering and hence knew I couldn't
do it to save my life. So I deceided to get myself on a
plastering course.

The place I did it offered 3 courses; a 2 day one, a 5 day
one, and the full C&amp;G with exam. I picked the 2 day one.
There were 16 of us on the course, mostly completely crap
at plastering to start with and in some cases, had never
tried it. The teacher was fantanstic. Within a day and a
half, every one of us was plastering to a much higher quality
than the two professional plasters I had used, if not as
quickly, although my speed has picked up subsequently with
practice. The last half day covered repair techniques (the
teacher wrecked our superb pieces of plasterwork and we had
to repair them;-). The course also covered rendering, and
each of us got an opportunity to try one type of specialist
rendering finish; I chose pebbledash as some areas of my
house have a pebbledash finish. One of the most useful,
enjoyable, and satisfying courses I've ever done, and I'm
sure that view was shared by all the others on it.

In my experience of plasterers who are good at the trade, the pre-requisites
are that you are: short, stocky,strong and grouchy.

Mmmmm,,,,I must be plain unlucky then because the one doing the full ground
floor of my house (after flooding) is young, slim, very pleasant &amp; the only
downside is she's married!

Perhaps I should have said more...I live in Italy and have been doing up
some houses...I can plaster to a certain extent but I want the rough edges
taken off my skills so to speak and I'm sure that there are lots of tricks
of the trade of which I have no knowledge. I can't find colleges here that
do courses and to take weekly lessons in the UK wouldn't be possible. I've
seen a couple of companies that offer week or two week long plastering
courses but to hear from someone who has actually been on some of these
courses would be benificial.
Thanks.
Jim

As previously described, I did a 2 day course that was excellent.
What sort of plaster is used in Italy? I could imagine this might
change significantly from one area of the world to another based
on availability of raw materials, temperature, etc, and this can
have some impact on the techniques required (lime being quite
different from gypsom, for example).
