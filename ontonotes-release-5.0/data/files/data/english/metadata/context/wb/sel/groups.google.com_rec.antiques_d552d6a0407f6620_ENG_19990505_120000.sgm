A fellow Genealogist wrote me and sent along a list of headstones and
other gravemarkers available on ebay from different sellers. One
wonders if this kind of thing might not encourage thefts of such
things if they sell successfully. As a Genealogist, and along with
other who pursue such things we have been trying to stop the mass
bulldozing and ploughing up of the world's ancient graveyards - and
with some success I might say. Last year I started a Save a Grave
campaign after learning of an entire Graveyard torn up and the stones
carted unceremoniously down the road 5 miles to be used as a slipway
for yachtsmen. While it was too late for that one others have been
saved and from all across the world. It is obvious they will not be
there for all time, while they are I think we should do our best to
preserve them. It never dawned on me however, that some might end up
on ebay for sale to the highest bidder.

Grave robbing by antique dealers is nothing new. And museums are filled with
its booty.
I can't tell you how many funerial items I have seen in antique shops --- even
the name markers off of caskets.

It's ghoulish; it's sacreligious; and it's stealing no matter if the owner is
dead or alive. This practice should be stopped, but unfortunately, the
antique profession has more than its share of dubious characters.

They do sell, some of them at very high prices, and there already is a
very large scale practice of robbing gravesites. There was just an
article in the paper last week about the bust of a ring of grave
artifact robbers and how many thousands of dollars they get for the
statues, etc.

Maybe putting some on ebay will draw attention to those who may be
dealing in those that are illegally obtained.

Liz,

I am curious if you checked out any of the listings you were sent.
After I replied to your post, I checked ebay for Headstones, Grave
Markers, and several other titles, and there were only 3 listings.

One was apparently pulled off ebay as they said the number was Invalid.
One was for an unscribed marker
One was a marker tile from a print shop

I wonder if someone already started &quot;policing&quot; this practice.

Liz probably already knows about this, but for those who are interested in
viewing rather than stealing grave markers of famous (and not-so-famous)
people, there's Find A Grave:

http://www.findagrave.com

I liked the bios of the Find A Grave contributors. Whatever it is that
inspires people to roam the countryside in hopes of finding a celebrity
gravesite is probably similar to our passionate search for that next fabulous
object.

Since I am not an ebay user, I wonder if I am not doing this right.

I checked every auction number and it said none of them are valid.
Your friend said the auctions were going on May 2, so I checked the
completed auctions for two of the people she listed for the last 30
days, and neither one showed anything remotely connected to a gravesite.

In any event, I agree with you that this would be a poor practice if
it's being done on ebay, or anywhere else for that matter.

letter since this was sent to some mailing list, read by another and
passed along to my friend, who in turn sent it along to me knowing I
was interested in saving graves.
I also took a look at the numbers sent to me and all have been pulled.
Maybe they had complaints. I do know that after searching around I
&quot;was &quot; able to find one site with the original copy but no photo, and
along the top is stated that this item was no longer available.
I know ebay's VP received letters from a lady dog enthusiasts re the
auctioning of live puppies on ebay and he actually phoned her and was
very interested in what she had to say. I gather that he said since
ebay in a completely automated biz it is nearly impossible for him to
police each item, however, he definitely does welcome messages and
calls if someone thinks that items offered are obnoxious in content.
It's nice to know that he seems to be readily available and interested
in what the public has to say. She said they spoke for a very long
time.

In the late 1970's, a local land-locked cemetery &quot;redeveloped&quot; a section
dating back to its early days c 1890. From what I remember, any surviving
family members were allowed to claim memorial stones, etc. Remaining pieces
were auctioned off for the benefit of a local children's hospital.
Everything left over (including about 200 weight of lead and bronze plaques)
was sold for scrap.

Recently they have had to post round the clock guards to prevent people from
taking the bronze flower vases and veteran plaques from the mausoleum. Sad
days.

"/> I became interested in Graves and Graveyards early in life when
staying with my Grandmother in Bedwellty, S. Wales. Bedwellty Church
has one of the most spectacular Graveyards with huge headstones packed
so closely together one would wonder if those there really are
&quot;resting in peace&quot;.
Many generations of my own family lie there and as a small girl I
would wander through the towering headstones with my cousin who still
lives just a mile away. I hope to be sent back there when I leave this
earth also.
My adult interest in Graves only came upon me fairly recently as a
Genealogist upon hearing several horror stories of what is happening
to ancient grave sites the world over. Genealogists spend much time in
graveyards far from home, ernestly poking among brambles and overgrown
weeds and grasses hoping always to find a familiar name, so I thought
it would be of particular interest to those who follow this as a
profession or hobby. I wrote to only about 3 genealogical mailing
lists and one newsgroup reporting what I had learned and asking that
all keep an eye out locally wherever that might be, so that local
governments don't up and sell the sites and contents with everything
hushed up until the matter has ended. Imagine my disgust upon
receiving several really nasty hate filled emails stating that it
doesn't happen and I shouldn't be spreading so many lies and should
find something better to do with my time. One even said it had nothing
to do with following Genealogy. One wonders to whom he will turn on
his next trip to England only to find the graveyard on his map is now
a Safeway!
Anyway folk, I am glad that members of this group at least are savvy
enough to know what is going on in the world and are bright enough to
know it is going on everywhere and in almost every country. Just a
quick brag if I might tho. After writing my little speech about saving
the graves I did have hundreds of positive letters in response and
later one from a lady who after reading my piece, had found out that a
local, very old, all black graveyard, was about to be demolished in
her area. She gathered together enough interest in short order to have
it saved for future generations to view and to be classed in her town
as an historical site from now on. I cannot now remember the exact
location but I was so pleased to know that things can be accomplished
with just a little work on our part. Another site was adopted by a
local boy scout troup who will now make it their business to keep
clean and tidy and in good shape into the future. Sadly I was told of
one graveyard bulldozed and local children actually playing with bones
which had surfaced along the fence lines.
Hope I have not bored you all to death....
Liz

"/> Mrs, Debbie..

Once I saw a cross that was going to be auctioned on a country auction but I did
not stay long enough to see what it went for. It was a hand smithed iron cross
from the first half of the 18 hundreds.
I have tried to buy a cast iron cross from a church that had old crosses on
display along the church wall.
That one was not for sale, but some newer stones where.

When my parents bought an old farm 25 years ago we found plates from a coffin
with a name in the house, but we never could find out who it had been.
To sell those would be a bit macabre perhaps but not illegal.

I do not know for shure but I think that over here graves are not protected for
ever. If the grave is not cared for by relatives for a certain amount of time
maybe 30 y. or so, and there is not some agreement of somekind, like an
inscription I saw on one gravestone recently, &quot;500 daler paid for caretaking of
this grave for all times to come&quot;, the the stone/ cross is removed.
The selling of stolen objects from cemeterys is something that I have never
heard of, (or thought about maybe).

It is very rare to see anything auctioned out or advertised though.
In either case it would not be illegal to buy/ sell a cross or a stone that has
been removed from the grave by whoever is responsible for the cemetery.

Regards
Martin W.

I had forgotten that in many countries the family or a paid
person is responsible for the upkeep of the graves. Still,
I didn't realize that if no one took care of a grave site,
that it could be removed &amp; sold. In the US, cemetery owners
hire caretakers to maintain them.

My family was the victim of robbery about 25 years ago.
Before my time (I'm the youngest of 7), my mother had a baby
girl who only lived a few days. She had a statuary lamb
marker that was stolen. At that time, my mother did not
have the funds to replace it &amp; she was heartbroken. Several
years later, we were unable to remember the exact location
of her tiny grave.

"/> Dear Debbie,

Your poor Mother. The people who steal grave markers are heartless cads.

But here is a personal example of how these things can get on the market quite
legitimately.

My great grandmother had a farm in Murfreesboro, NC and there was a family
cemetery on the property. I believe it was sold in the early 1980's to Chowan
College. There were quite a few graves and the anthropolgy department tried to
excavate them in order to move the bodies. However,&quot;there wasn't so much as a
shoe buckle&quot; left, just discolored earth. So the nice people at the college
tried their best. A parking lot was planned for that site. They partitioned
off a grassy area and erected one single stone with a brass plaque enscribed
with all the names and dates. It sits in the middle of the parking lot. I am
sure the original stones are in a dump,comprise a patio somewhere, were
perhaps made into coffee tables or sold to collectors. I certainly wouldn't
want them .. would give me the creeps something awful.

In the May 3rd issue of People magazine there was an article about
stolen cemetary treasures (mostly statues &amp; urns). Four drug addicts
were cruising through cemetaries in New Orleans, La and selling the
stuff to local antique dealers. They took statues weighing 700 lbs!

Offhand, I think the idea of buying anything that looks like it may have
come from a cemetary is ghoulish.

I don't think robbers will find any buyers among country folk
here in north Georgia, USA. Anything associated with graves is
considered sacred, and you would no more violate a grave than
enter a house uninvited, or desecrate a church.

We have several varities of creeping phlox around here, and refer
to it as &quot;thrift.&quot; It can be found around old home sites and in
cemeteries. It's quite OK to be given a thrift &quot;starter&quot; from
someone's home, but to take thrift from a graveyard, even an old
abandoned one, is said to bring never-ending bad luck. I hope
the same joss follows the monument rustlers.

As far as Switzerland goes, I seem to recall that marked graves are not
necessarily permanent either: when I was living there as a teen, I recall my
grandfather discussing the fact that the cemetary his parents were buried in was
full, and that after 30 or 50 years (don't recall exactly), famillies would given
the opportunity to move their deceased to another site, or recover the markers.
Unclaimed sites then had the markers removed, and if I recall correctly, the area
was converted into a park...

Just read an update on the New Orleans story. Having moved from there less
than two years ago, I'm especially interested. The creeps weren't just going
out and robbing the cemeteries. One of the antique dealers, forget his name,
was teaching them what to look for and how to tell the good antique marble
pieces from the newer. It is my understanding there are close to 20 dealers
caught up in this ring and it extends to the highest rungs of New Orleans
society.

Reading this post again just bumped a childhood memory. This was in Mattoon
Ill. About 3 weeks after my grandmother was buried. We went back out to her
grave on a Sunday to put nice news flowers at her head stone &amp; pray. My Dad
told me to go play since I was just 10 at the time. I brought with me some
crayons &amp; paper cause I thought it was so neat &amp; pretty when you took a piece
of paper &amp; put it on a unusual stone marker with lots of designs on it, &amp; color
over the paper &amp; the engravings came up on the paper. I looked around &amp; it was
so peaceful there. Beautiful flowers everywhere, sunshine, nice breeze. The
bird sounds where so clear. You could actually sit there for hours just
listening &amp; looking around at the beauty that had been made around the graves.
That's what I remember. If you ever want a quite place to read a good book go
to a nice cemetary. Paula

&gt;&gt; A fellow Genealogist wrote me and sent along a list of headstones and

&gt;&gt; other who pursue such things we have been trying to stop the mass
&gt;&gt; bulldozing and ploughing up of the world's ancient graveyards - and
&gt;&gt; with some success I might say. Last year I started a Save a Grave
&gt;&gt; campaign after learning of an entire Graveyard torn up and the stones
&gt;&gt; carted unceremoniously down the road 5 miles to be used as a slipway
&gt;&gt; for yachtsmen. While it was too late for that one others have been
&gt;&gt; saved and from all across the world. It is obvious they will not be
&gt;&gt; there for all time, while they are I think we should do our best to
&gt;&gt; preserve them. It never dawned on me however, that some might end up
&gt;&gt; on ebay for sale to the highest bidder.
