Never seen this or anything exactly like it discussed here before and was
hoping to get a few viewpoints on how I and my DW might help our teen with
some peer pressure. Here's what got my attention...

Sat AM the phone rings, I pick it up and its (yet another) boy wanting to
talk to DD15. She didn't talk for long and after she hung up, DD14 made some
kind of comment about the young man calling. DD15 tried to hush things up
quickly, but I could see she was really distraught with tears welling up in
her eyes. So I asked her who it was, and what the problem was. Turns out
that this particular guy is putting some high pressure on DD15 to try drugs
and (obvious to me--the motive is to get her high/drunk enough for her to
let her guard down and end up having sex)--although I didn't say this to
her.

I'm unsure what approach I should take for future encounters like this, or
this one particular kid especially. I told DD15 to just tell me/DW/siblings
who she does not want to talk to and we would screen the calls for her. I
also told her, if she chooses to speak to this kid again, that when he tries
this again she should tell him in no uncertain terms that he can go f___
himself. She later confided to DW that she thought that was funny--though I
was dead serious.

So.... what would you do if the kid calls again? I thought about telling him
myself, or asking to speak to his Dad and explain the situation... or should
I just put him in ignore-mode and not let any contact between them? My DD15
has no emotional ties to this kid to the best of our knowledge. Or is there
another option I have not considered?

Also, if this happens again with a different kid or different DD, what
tact(s) may be effective?

Thanks,

Bo

I guess the problem I see, is that short of imprisoning one's children
in a tower (and I confess, at times that has seemed like an attractive
option to me), you can't protect your teenager by keeping bad
influences away from him or her.

Our daughter is a little younger than yours (almost 14), but we have
talked about one of the reasons we don't want her using drugs being
because people can end up making bad decisions that they ultimately
regret under the influence of drugs.  And we've specifically talked
about the possibility of having sex, and (for example) ending up
pregnant.

I think what you told your daughter (that you'd screen calls if she
wanted you to), and that she should respond unambiguously if he brings
up his idea again is on target.

The question I'd be wanting to ask myself though is &quot;is my daughter
likely to givin in&quot; and &quot;if so, how can I go about preventing
appropriate opportunities from arising?&quot;

I think all parents have this 'tower thought' cross their mind sooner or
later. Of course one cannot be 100% effective in keeping bad influences from
their teens, but I don't see that as reason to not do what I can. Right?

Good point and good question. I think in this particular case (ie DD15 not
DD14), she is not likely to give into pressure. Which is a very good thought
(wishful  or not). [It would be a different story if it were DD14 I'm
afraid]. However, it troubles me that DD15, or DD14 for that matter, doesn't
possess the attitude/frame-of-mind to 'not give a crap' what the boy thinks
of her for not succombing to his pressure and consequently ends up crying
and withdrawn. As to the prevention, I'm not sure what further reasonable
steps we could take that would not drive her into rebellion and doing the
very thing we (and she, herself) don't want her to. What steps you may ask?
We'll no sleepovers at her friend's houses (you'd be surprised at the #of
kids that show up at our house that we've never met the parents!), no
unescorted activities with other youths, no cell phone, monitored internet
usage (what a nightmare this is). Her primary 'away from parents' time is
via youth group church activities. Even those aren't fool proof. One outting
to 6 flags over Ga a few yrs back resulted in a pregnant teen. What an eye
opener that was! (insufficient # of escorts). We don't let ours go on big
ones like that unless one or both of us is going as escort too.

One thing that has worked with my kids in certain situations is that we
agree to make me and/or their dad the heavy.  So instead of saying &quot;I
don't want to go out with you because I don't really trust you&quot; she can
say &quot;my mom forbids it.&quot;  Obviously this is for situations where you and
your kid are on the same page, and she just needs some back up.

The other aspect to consider is that my daughter and I are not being
stictly honest in this situation.  I do &quot;forbid&quot; it so as to make it not
an out-and-out lie, but we both know that it is a bit contrived.
Generally strict honesty is better, but even for adults it is hard to
say &quot;I just don't like you&quot; instead of &quot;I am washing my hair.&quot;

Also, it's &quot;what tack&quot;, not &quot;what tact&quot; just FYI.  Unles tact is short
for tactic.  :-)

Yes. I'm not going to tiptoe around and lie or tell him 'white lies' just to
not 'play the heavy'. If she doesn't want to talk to him, and she wants me
to tell him-- I will be blunt and tell him why.

Well, maybe.  I think part of growing up has to be learning how to
deal with bad influences on one's own.  After all, you can protect
your children for a while, but ultimately they reach a stage when you
can't.  So you don't want them to be dependent on your protection when
you can't do the protecting anymore.

Don't let it trouble you too much.  Part of being a teenager seems to
include caring _desparately_ what other people think of you.

I don't know either.  I think that one should be careful about

I'd be less concerned with unmonitored internet usage than you are,
and more concerned with church group activities.  Almost everyone I
know who was involved with a youth church group lost their virginity
in a church basement (or the equivalent)!  Though I suppose there are
worse places to lose one's virginity!

Seriously, if you don't listen in on her phone conversations,  why no
unmonitored internet usage?

condoms!

That's really sad. I think its a horrid place to lose one's virginity-- but
I suppose you really didn't mean that. I'd be afraid of getting struck by
lightning.
But I do understand and share your concern somewhat about those
activities--especially ones with big numbers or with kids from other
areas/churches I don't know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well, mostly because they have already been caught putting info on the
social sites like facebook--that they should not be. Even after seeing many
episodes of 'to catch a predator' they think sexual predators would never
show up _here_.  Putting up real addresses, phone, names etc. Awfully risky
in my opinion when you can find website to see how many registered sex
offenders are in your area and you find more than a dozen within 5 mi
radius.

&gt; That's really sad. I think its a horrid place to lose one's virginity-- but
&gt; I suppose you really didn't mean that. I'd be afraid of getting struck by
&gt; lightning.

Well, it is probably better than the back of a car, which is a popular
location, at least in stories.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I do understand and share your concern somewhat about those
&gt; activities--especially ones with big numbers or with kids from other
&gt; areas/churches I don't know.

It probably isn't actually the churches that are the problem in this
case.  I think teenagers are just behaving the way teenagers are wont
to do.  But I do suspect that because we are under the (mistaken)
impression that churchgoing teenagers are less likely to have sex
early, we may subject teens in those situations to less vigilance than
we might in other circumstances.

&gt; &gt; Seriously, if you don't listen in on her phone conversations,  why no
&gt; &gt; unmonitored internet usage?

&gt; Well, mostly because they have already been caught putting info on the
&gt; social sites like facebook--that they should not be.

Ah.  I see.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Even after seeing many
&gt; episodes of 'to catch a predator' they think sexual predators would never
&gt; show up _here_.  Putting up real addresses, phone, names etc. Awfully risky
&gt; in my opinion when you can find website to see how many registered sex
&gt; offenders are in your area and you find more than a dozen within 5 mi
&gt; radius.
">

Well, I agree with you that I don't want my kids to put identifying
data on the internet.  but the truth is that the real risk from sexual
predators on the internet seems to be very, very small.

Yes, there is the occasional highly publicized case of a man being
arrested for owning or distributing child pornography, and every few
months, there is some successful FBI entrapment where an adult is
persuaded to meet an agent disguised as a child.

And the media is awash in scare stories about sexual predation on the
internet.

But actualy cases of sexual predators tracking children down by their
name and address in real life and doing something seem to be
incredibly rare,  even though your daughters don't seem any more
careless than average about this.

Why would you not say this to her?  My 15 year old and I have some
very frank talks about boys and their motives.  It's helped her to
avoid some very risky situations when I wasn't around to 'rescue'
her.  Honestly, as the dad, I don't want to hear these kind of
discussions from my 'little girl' but I'd rather talk about it now
than deal with her pregnant or with an STD.

I believe that helping them to see the possible motives behind the
actions helps them make better decisions.  I can say no, or forbid her
to see someone and it just pisses her off.  However, if she
understands the 'why's' behind my actions then at least she can be a
little more accepting and on some occasions even admit that dad might
be right.

Of course. My girls are embarassed to death when I try to talk with them
about sex --to any degree. Consequently, these conversations generally fall
into my wife's lap.
