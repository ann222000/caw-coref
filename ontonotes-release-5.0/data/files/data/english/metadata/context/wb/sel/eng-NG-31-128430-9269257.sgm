Twenty-Two Things We Now Know Six Years  After 9/11
Each year around  the anniversary of 9/11, I summarize what we ordinary
citizens have  learned since that awful day in 2001. This is the sixth annual look
backwards, an update based on new information about those horrific events
and what followed.

What we now more fully understand is how the  CheneyBush Administration
utilized the murderous terrorism of 9/11 as the  one-size-fits-all justification
for their unfolding domestic and foreign  agenda.

By and large, one can sum up that overall agenda as: Amass  and control power
in the U.S. and much of the world, and, in cahoots with  their corporate
supporters, loot the treasury. All this was to be carried  out secretly, with no
accountability.

9/11 AND &quot;THE WAR ON  TERROR&quot;

1. Iraq Plan Preceeded 9/11. Let's remember the  chronology of how we got
here: The Administration's far-right domestic  agenda was bogged down in 2001
after Jim Jeffords left the Republican  caucus and joined the now-majority
Democratic one in the Senate. 9/11, and  the mysterious anthrax attacks that
followed, had the side effect of  providing the CheneyBush Administration pretty much
a free ride in putting  police-state tactics in place (symbolized by the
so-called &quot;Patriot Act&quot;),  overriding Constitutional protections, and greasing the
wheels for all  sorts of domestic legislation that otherwise might have been
bottled up  forever.

Planning for an attack on Iraq, as Treasury Secretary Paul  O'Neill later
told us, already had begun at the first cabinet meetings  after Inauguration Day
in early 2001; after 9/11, those plans proceeded  apace, even when the
intelligence indicated that it was not an Iraq  operation but an al-Qaida terrorist
attack, out of Afghanistan.

It  appeared that the U.S. military over time would capture or kill Osama bin
Laden in Afghanistan and effectively destroy al-Qaida forces that had
attacked America on 9/11. But CheneyBush abruptly pulled the U.S. forces  from
Afghanistan and headed them for Iraq, a country that was no real  danger to the
U.S. and its allies. (Late Flash: The resurgent Taliban  allies of al-Qaida now
control a good share of Afghanistan; if the U.S.  had stayed in that country
and taken care of business, today's reality  there might well have been
significantly different.)

2.  Unanswered 9/11 Questions. There still are unanswered questions about
the horrific events of September 11, 2001, mainly centered around: A. Why  Bush
sat there for seven minutes reading the &quot;Pet Goat&quot; book after he'd  been
informed of the plane hitting the second tower (&quot;America is under  attack,&quot; his
chief of staff whispered to him), and why the Secret Service,  as they are
trained to do when the President is believed to be in danger,  didn't surround him
and get him the hell out of that classroom (the clear  implication is that a
delay-operation was in progress). B. Why NORAD  didn't scramble its fighters in
time to do anything (same implication). C.  Whether World Trade Center Towers
1, 2 and 7 collapsed into their  footprints as a result of fire/structural
damage or from pre-set  demolition charges (there are reputable scientists on
both sides of that  one). D. How to explain all the &quot;put&quot; options on American
Airlines and  United Airlines stocks just prior to the attacks, clearly
suggesting  someone knew which airlines were going to be hijacked and was trying to
profit from the pending attacks?

But regardless of whether  CheneyBush were complicit in any degree in the
deaths and destruction that  day -- and there is no proof that they were -- what
we do know is that in  the months, weeks and days prior to 9/11, red-hot
warnings about a planned  terrorist attack, using planes as weapons aimed at
buildings in New York  and Washington, were coming into the White House from a wide
variety of  other countries.

At the very least then, CheneyBush and a few other  key insiders knew that a
&quot;spectacular&quot; attack was coming and did  absolutely nothing. Even after Bush
was briefed on August 6 with a report  entitled &quot;Bin Laden Determined to Attack
Inside the U.S.&quot; -- which talked  about preparations for hijackings,
suspected terrorists surveilling  federal buildings in New York, teams of terrorists
being inside the U.S.  with explosives -- there was no heightening of
awareness, no alerting  airlines, no sending out photos of al-Qaida suspects to be on
the lookout  for, no calling an urgent meeting of counter-terrorism experts
inside the  White House to coordinate either a way of minimizing the damage or
dealing  with a post-attack response. Nothing.

Again, if the above is true,  one is left with two alternative explanations.
A: These CheneyBush guys in  charge were (and remain) totally over their heads
in terms of governance.  They simply didn't have a clue what was about to
happen and what to do  about it. Administration actions during the past six and a
half years  supply more than enough evidence that Bush and his crew are total
fuckups.  It's a reverse-Midas syndrome: everything they touch turns to
excrement.  Total bumblers, screwups, incompetent dolts.

B: They knew something  major was about to go down (although 3000 deaths may
have been way beyond  what they imagined) in order to use those attacks as a
rallying point to  amass power and push their agenda through a Congress that
otherwise was  antagonistic to them.

3. The Facts of 9/11. We know that the  Bush Administration didn't want the
public to learn much, if anything,  about the events of that day six years ago.
Bush&amp;Co. had to be dragged  kicking and screaming into agreeing to the
appointment of the official  9/11 Commission, and they named as the executive
director one of their  made men, Philip Zelikow (now an Administration official).

As it  turned out, the Administration wasn't all that cooperative in
furnishing  documents, Bush would not testify under oath and would deign to appear
only with Cheney by his side, (here's my imagined transcript of that  testimony)
( www.crisispapers.org/essays/911-testimony.htm ) and we later  learned that
the commission was so angered by the constantly-shifting  stories told by the
Pentagon/NORAD that they were ready to urge that legal  charges be filed. (
www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/01/AR2006080101...
) In short, the 9/11 Commision's probe was not exhaustive, leaving many  areas
of investigation unplumbed, and many questions still  unsatisfactorally
unanswered.

4. PNAC &amp; the Neo-Cons. We  know that a FarRight segment of the conservative
movement was dedicated to  using America's sole superpower status to move
aggressively in the world  while, they believed, no other country or international
force could put up  much resistance. The key neo-con leaders in charge of
U.S.  foreign/military policy (Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Bolton, Perle,
Khalilzad, et al.) were founders of, and affiliated with, The Project for  The New
American Century (PNAC).

The neo-cons realized that  presidents enjoy enormous patriotic support
during wartime, but when the  war ends, those leaders lose their compelling luster,
as was the case with  Bush#1. Ergo, Bush#2 would become a PERMANENT wartime
president, and those  who opposed him could then be tarred forever with the
smear of  &quot;unpatriotic&quot; and &quot;hating America,&quot; thus marginalizing their political
impact. And it worked: the Democrats cowered and gave Bush virtually
everything he wanted, up until relatively recently, when occasionally they  remember
they have spines in their bodies and stand up and fight as an  opposition
party should.

We know that Bush&amp;Co. saw, in Condi  Rice's apt term at the time, the
&quot;opportunity&quot; offered by the 9/11 attacks  to move quickly and forcefully with the
Administration's foreign and  domestic agenda. PNAC talked about its Pax
Americana plan for global  &quot;benevolent hegemony&quot; using a retooled military; this
military  transformation would take forever to implement, a PNAC report said,
unless  a &quot;new Pearl Harbor&quot; changed the equation in the public mind. 9/11 came
along and was used as that &quot;new Pearl Harbor.&quot; (See &quot;How We Got Into This
Imperial Pickle: A PNAC Primer.&quot;) (
www.crisispapers.org/Editorials/PNAC-Primer.htm )

We know that  after 9/11, Bush seemed to bring the entire country along with
him when he  launched an attack on al-Qaida and its Taliban-government
supporters in  Afghanistan. But there's no oil in that destitute country, and, as
Rumsfeld reminded us, not much worth bombing. Thus, no lessons could be  drawn
by Middle East leaders from the U.S. attack. But, as Cheney's secret  energy
panel was aware, there was another country in the region that did  have oil, and
lots of it, and which could be taken easily by U.S. forces.  Thus Iraq became
the object-lesson to other autocratic leaders in the  Middle East, especially
in Syria and Iran. If you do not do our bidding,  prepare to accept a massive
dose of &quot;shock&amp;awe&quot;; you will be removed,  replaced by democratic-looking
governments as arranged by the U.S. Control  of Iraq's oil has been at the
forefront of U.S. occupation policies in  Iraq, and remains so.

The neo-cons -- most of whom were members of  PNAC and similar organizations,
such as the American Enterprise Institute  and Foundation for the Defense of
Democracies -- had urged Clinton to  depose Saddam Hussein in 1998. But he
demurred, seeing a mostly contained  dictator there, whereas Osama bin Laden in
Afghanistan, and those  terrorists like him, actually were successfully
attacking U.S. assets  inside the country and abroad.

But the PNAC crowd had larger  ambitions than simply toppling a brutal Iraqi
dictator. Among their other  recommendations: &quot;pre-emptively&quot; attacking
countries that were of no  imminent danger to the U.S., abrogating treaties when
they conflicted with  U.S. goals, making sure no other nation (or organization,
such as the  United Nations) could ever achieve power-parity with the U.S.,
installing  U.S.-friendly governments to do America's will, expressing a
willingness  to use tactical nuclear weapons, and so on. All of these extreme PNAC
suggestions, once regarded as lunatic, were enshrined in 2002 as official  U.S.
policy in the National Security Strategy of the United States of  America and
were renewed in Bush's 2004's National Security  Strategy.

THE IRAQ INVASION AND OCCUPATIOIN

5.  Sexing Up the Intel. We know that given the extreme nature of the
neo-con agenda in fomenting support for an invasion and occupation of  Iraq,
Bush&amp;Co. had their work cut out for them. Therefore, among the  first moves by
Rumsfeld following 9/11 was to somehow try to connect  Saddam to the terror attacks.
The various intelligence agencies reported  to Rumsfeld that there was no
Iraq connection to 9/11, and that it was an  al-Qaida operation, but those
findings were merely bothersome impediments.  Since the CIA and the other
intelligence agencies would not, or could not,  supply the intelligence needed to
justify a war on Iraq, Rumsfeld set up  his own rump &quot;intelligence&quot; agency, the
Office of Special Plans, stocked  it with political appointees of the PNAC
persuasion and soon was  stovepiping cherry-picked raw intel, much of it untrue from
self-interested Iraqi exiles, straight to Cheney and others in the White
House. Shortly thereafter, the White House Iraq Group -- the in-house  marketing
cabal, with such major players as Libby, Rove, Card, Rice,  Hadley, Hughes,
Matalin, et al. -- went big-time with the WMD and  mushroom-cloud scares and the
suspect melding of Saddam Hussein with the  events of 9/11.

Based on this sexed-up and phony intelligence,  Cheney, Bush, Rice, Rumsfeld
and the others began warning about mushroom  clouds over the U.S., drone
planes dropping biological agents over the  East Coast (phony photos were shown to
members of Congress), huge  stockpiles of chemical weapons in Iraq, etc.
Secretary of State Colin  Powell, regarded as the most believable of the bunch, was
dispatched to  the United Nations to make the case, which he did,
reluctantly, by  presenting an embarrassingly weak litany of surmise and concocted
allegations. While the U.S. corporate media was unanimous in its opinion  that
Powell had cinched the case, the world didn't buy it (Powell, who  resigned in
2004, has since lamented his role in this charade), and the  opposition to the
U.S. war plan was palpable and huge: 10 million citizens  throughout the world
hit the streets to protest, and former allies  publicly criticized Bush. Only
Tony Blair in England eagerly hitched his  wagon to the Bush war-plan with
large numbers of troops dispatched, as it  turned out over the objections of many
of his closest aides and  advisers.

6. The Big Lie &amp; the Downing Street  Revelations. We know that those advisers
warned Blair that he was  about to involve the U.K. in an illegal, immoral
and probably unwinnable  war that would put U.K. and U.S. troops in great danger
from potential  insurgent forces. How do we know about these inner workings
of the Blair  government? Because someone from inside that body leaked the
top-secret  minutes from those war-Cabinet meetings, the so-called Downing Street
Memos.

We also learned from those minutes that Bush &amp; Blair  agreed to make war on
Iraq as early as the Spring of 2002. The  intelligence, they decided, would be
&quot;fixed around the policy&quot; to go to  war, despite their telling their
legislative bodies, the mass media, and  their citizens that no decisions had been
made. In fact, the Bush  Administration had decided to attack Iraq a year before
the invasion.  &quot;Fuck Saddam,&quot; Bush told three U.S. Senators in March of 2002.
&quot;We're  taking him out.&quot;

We know that many of Blair's most senior advisors  thought the WMD argument
rested on shaky ground, and that without specific  authorization from the
United Nations Security Council, the legality of  the war was doubtful. But the
Bush Administration rushed to war anyway,  because the U.N. inspectors on the
ground in Iraq were not finding any WMD  stockpiles. The rush to war was
accomplished without proper planning and  with no workable plan to secure the peace
and reconstruct the country  after the major fighting. Some weeks later, Bush
prematurely declared,  under a &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; banner, that the U.S. had
&quot;prevailed&quot; in  the Iraq war. The Iraqi &quot;insurgency&quot; was about to blow up in
their  faces.

The Downing Street Memos make clear that both the U.S. and  U.K. were well
aware that Iraq was a paper tiger, with no significant WMD  stockpiles or link
to Al-Qaida and the 9/11 attacks. Nevertheless, the  major thrust of Bush&amp;Co.'s
justification for going to war was based on  these non-existent weapons and
9/11 links. The Big Lie Technique,  repeating the same falsehoods over and over
and over, drummed those lies  into Americans' heads day after day, month
after month, with little if any  skeptical analysis by the corporate mainstream
media, which marched mostly  in lockstep with Bush policy and thinking.
Wolfowitz admitted later that  they chose WMD as the primary reason for making war
because they couldn't  agree on anything else the citizenry would accept. But
frightening people  with talk of nuclear weapons, mushroom clouds, toxins
delivered by drone  airplanes and the like would work like a charm. And so they did,
convincing the American people and Congress that an attack was justified.  It
wasn't.

7. Iran Is Beneficiary of U.S. Policy. We know  that the real reasons for
invading Iraq had precious little to do with  WMD, with Islamist terrorists
inside that country, with installing  democracy, and the like. There were no WMD to
speak of, and Saddam, an  especially vicious dictator, did not tolerate
religious or political  zealots of any stripe. No, the reasons had more to do with
American  geopolitical goals in the region involving oil, control, support for
its  ally Israel, hardened military bases and keeping Iran from having free
rein in the region.

However, as it turned out, the invasion and  brutal occupation of Iraq
removed the one major buffer against the  expansion of Iran's political and military
power in the region. In  addition, because the U.S. Occupation was so
incompetently carried out, it  pushed Iraq and Iran into a far closer religious and
political alliance  than would have been the case if Saddam had been permitted
to remain in  power. CheneyBush may have sacrificed thousands of American
dead, tens of  thousands of American wounded, and hundreds of thousands Iraqis as
&quot;collateral damage&quot; -- and now the Administration, which has constantly
downsized its definition of &quot;victory,&quot; is quietly willing to accept a  stable
Islamic government that may well turn out to be more attuned to  Teheran than to
Washington.

8. Iraq As a Disaster Zone. We  know that Bush's war has been a thorough
disaster, built on a foundation  of lies, and bungled from the start. For most of
its residents (those  still remaining in Iraq), Iraq in 2007 is a
manifestation of Hell on  earth. As a result, the Occupation has provided a magnet for
jihadists  from other countries, billions have been wasted or lost in the corrupt
system of organized corporate looting that ostensibly is designed to speed
up Iraq's &quot;reconstruction,&quot; etc. Indeed, so much has Bush's war been  botched
that the &quot;realists&quot; in the Administration know the U.S. must get  out as
quickly as possible if they are to have any hope of exercising  their considerable
muscle elsewhere in the Middle East. But, so far, the  neo-con strategy still
rules, and &quot;stay-the-course&quot; remains the operating  principle. Hence, the
last-minute attempt for a military do-over:  CheneyBush's &quot;surge&quot; escalation,
which they are trying to extend, in  six-months chunks, through the November 2008
election.

9. The  Stretched-Thin Military. We know that Bush's Middle East agenda also
is suffering because the U.S. military is spread way thin in Afghanistan  and
Iraq, the desertion and suicide rates are high, soldiers are not
re-enlisting at the usual clip, recruitment isn't working and deceptive  scams are being
used to lure youngsters into signing up. In short, there  are no forces to
spare on the ground. Either a military draft will be  instituted -- which would
be only as a last resort for CheneyBush -- or  all future attacks will have to
come from air power or from missiles,  which will merely deliver a message
about U.S. superiority in the air but  with no successful follow-up possible on
the ground. The air attacks will  result in making the citizens of those
countries even angrier at America,  and with little likelihood of success in forging
U.S.-friendly  &quot;democratic&quot; governments in Iran, Syria, et al., since the
bombed  populations will support their existing governments. In short, America's
failure in Iraq and Israel's failure in Lebanon demonstrate the limits of
muscle-bound, high-tech armies in the modern, nationalist-guerrillas  world.

10. Hiding Facts from the Public. We know that  Bush&amp;Co. made sure that there
would be no full-scale, independent  probes of their role in using and
abusing the intelligence that led to war  on Iraq. This is the most secretive
Administration in American history,  and they want no investigations (
www.oldamericancentury.org/blocked_investigations.htm ) of any of their  mistakes or
corruptions of the democratic process.

The Senate  Intelligence Committee, then led by Republican Pat Roberts, held
hearings  on the failures lower down the chain, namely at the CIA and FBI
level, and  promised there would be followup hearings on any White House
manipulation  of intelligence. But, following the 2004 election, Roberts said no
purpose  would be served in launching such an investigation. Likewise, the 9/11
Commission did not delve deeply into how the Bush Administration misused  its
pre-9/11 knowledge. In short, this secretive administration made sure  that
everything was done to head off at the pass any investigations  whatsoever. And
we've not learned much more about this topic now that the  Democrats are in
control in Congress.

THE TURN TO TYRANNY AT  HOME

11. Perilously Close to Dictatorship. We know that  Bush has no great love
for democratic processes, certainly not inside the  United States. (On at least
three occasions, he has &quot;jokingly&quot; expressed  his preference for dictatorship,
as long, he said, as he can be the  dictator.) He much prefers to rule as an
oligarch, but to do that, he had  to invent legal justifications that he could
claim granted him the  requisite power. So he had longtime lawyer-toady
Alberto Gonzales, and  Cheney's now-chief-of-staff David Addington, devise a legal
philosophy  that permits Bush to do pretty much what he wants -- ignore laws
on the  books, disappear U.S. citizens into military prisons, authorize
torture,  spy on citizens' phone calls and emails, declare martial law and rule by
decree, etc. -- whenever Bush says he's acting as &quot;commander-in-chief&quot;  during
&quot;wartime.&quot;

And, since &quot;wartime&quot; is the amorphous &quot;war on  terror,&quot; from which there is
no end, Bush is home free. There always will  be terrorists trying to do
anti-U.S. damage somewhere around the globe, or  inside America, and the
&quot;commander-in-chief&quot; will need to respond. Ergo,  goes this logic, Bush (and any
successor) is above the law, untouchable,  in perpetuity. Bush&amp;Co. also made sure that
U.S. officials and  military troops would not be subject to indictment by any
international  court or war-crimes tribunal.

No doubt the issue of unstoppable  executive power ultimately will be heard
by the U.S. Supreme Court, to  which Bush has appointed ultra-conservative
Judges John Roberts and Samuel  Alito. In a chilling decision, the appeals panel,
of which Roberts was a  member prior to his ascension to the Supremes, ruled
that the  Commander-in-Chief's arbitrarily-designated &quot;enemies&quot; are
non-persons,  with no legal rights. Bush now feels free to subject anyone he likes to
the &quot;military tribunal&quot; system he has concocted; even the Court's recent
objections to the tribunal system has had little effect on day-to-day  violations of
detainees' rights, as Bush&amp;Co. always manage to postpone  and delay
implementation or find ways around the court  rulings.

12. Torture As Official U.S. Policy. We know that  Gonzales, Addington and
Pentagon lawyers beholden to Rumsfeld devised  legal rationales that make
torture of suspects official state policy.  These Bush-loyalist lawyers also greatly
widened the definition of what is  acceptable interrogation practice --
basically anything this side of death  or terminally abusing internal organs. They
also authorized the  &quot;rendering&quot; of key suspects to countries specializing in
extreme torture.  After all this, Bush and Rumsfeld professed shock, shock!,
that those  under their command would wind up torturing, abusing and
humiliating  prisoners in U.S. care. But the Administration made sure to stop all
inquiries into higher-up responsibility for the endemic torture. The buck  never
stops on CheneyBush's desk -- if something goes wrong (and they  never will
admit to mistakes), it's always someone else's fault. If and  when Iraq &quot;falls,&quot;
the names of scapegoats are being prepared: al-Maliki,  Democrats, the &quot;liberal
media&quot; and bloggers, Bill Clinton, Gen. Petraeus,  et al. Never Cheney, never
Bush.

13. The Bill of Rights Goes  &quot;Quaint.&quot; We know that the Bush Administration
has been able to obtain  whatever legislation it needs in its self-proclaimed
&quot;war on terror&quot; by  utilizing, and hyping, the understandable fright of the
American people.  John Ashcroft and Tom Ridge emerged periodically to manipulate
the  public's fright by announcing yet another &quot;terror&quot; threat, based on
&quot;credible but unverified&quot; evidence. As he departed from his directorate of  the
Homeland Security Department, Ridge admitted (
www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-05-10-ridge-alerts_x.htm ) that he  was required to issue many of those
&quot;terror&quot; warnings when there was no  justifiable reason for doing so; it has
been demonstrated ( www.youtube.com/watch?v=az7yl-UnsQQ ) that those warnings
were activated  usually when the Administration was facing an election or when
they were  having an especially bad-news day -- a new scandal, especially
discouraging reports from Iraq, etc. Meanwhile, Congress (shame on you,
Democrats!) recently made most of the Patriot Act laws permanent. Unless  those can
be repealed, and the tradition of habeas corpus re-introduced  into American
jurisprudence, that vote will be a nail into the coffin  housing the remains of
the Bill of Rights.

14. Outing CIA Agents  for Political Reasons. The Bush Administration, for
its own crass  political reasons, compromised American national security by
revealing the  identity of two key intelligence operatives. The first was CIA
agent  Valerie Plame, who had important contacts in the shadowy world of weapons
of mass destruction, especially in dealing with Iran's nuclear  capabilities.
Wherever the leak originated, it is clear that Cheney  (through Libby) and
Rove disclosed Plame's covert identity in an attempt  to punish her husband for
explosing Bush's lie to the nation that Saddam  was seeking supplies of uranium
from central Africa. Revealing the  identity of a covert CIA agent is a
felony. The other outing of a CIA  operative, by Condi Rice, apparently to show off
how successful the  Administration was in its anti-terrorism hunt, was that
of a high-ranking  mole close to bin Laden's inner circle . This operative
could have kept  the U.S. informed as to ongoing and future plans of al-Qaida.
That's  Bush's &quot;war-on-terrorism&quot; at work.

15. Do You Know If Your Vote  Is Counted? We know that America's
vote-counting system is corrupted.  Sophisticated statistical analysis along with
wide-scale exit-polling,  suggests strongly that the 2004 election results were
fiddled with by the  private companies that tally the votes. (
www.scoop.co.nz/stories/print.html?path=HL0706/S00165.htm ) These  companies are owned by
far-right Republican supporters, but the same  objection would be lodged if Democrats
owned the companies.

There  are no good reasons to &quot;outsource&quot; vote-counting to private
corporations.  These are the same companies who make and program the voting machines,
who  refuse to permit inspection of their software, and whose technicians have
behaved suspiciously on election nights in 2000 in Florida, in 2002 in
Georgia, and in Ohio and Florida in 2004.

And we haven't even  mentioned Rove's dirty-tricks department whose function
has been, by hook  or by crook, to lower the number of potential Democrat
voters, especially  minority voters; a favorite tactic is to purge hundreds of
thousands of  likely Democratic voters from the voting rolls in advance in key
states  such as Florida and Ohio. There are signs in 2007 that various states
are  concerned enough about computer-voting to make some significant changes in
equipment. But because the same companies control the secret counting of  the
votes, unless the vote-tabulating system can be changed soon, the  integrity
of our elections will be suspect into the far future. Even if  all the other
reforms were implemented for next year's federal election,  they would mean
nothing without the guarantee of honest  tabulation.

16. No Privacy Anymore. We also now know that  shortly after 9/11, CheneyBush
authorized massive data-mining of  Americans' phone calls and emails, along
with other domestic spying  operations, many of them in clear violation of the
FISA law establishing a  separate, secret court to rule on requests for
eavesdropping  warrants.

17. Purging the Body Politic .We now know that  CheneyBush, angered by the
unwillingness of the intelligence analysts at  the CIA and State Department to
cook the intel books for political  reasons, conducted purges of recalcitrant
analysts at CIA and  State.

There also were purges in the Justice Department in an  attempt to have only
&quot;loyal Bushies&quot; (their term) in place, those who  would do the bidding of the
White House without opposition or questioning.  And so the DOJ, under Bush
toady Alberto Gonzales, fired Bush-appointed  U.S. Attorneys around the country
and replaced them with their own guys.  They tried to pretend that the firings
were the result of poor performance  ratings, but that wasn't the case. It was
simply partisan, to help  guarantee GOP control of the election and indicting
process through which  the Democratic Party and it supporters could be
legally hassled in court  or likely Democratic voters kept from the polls. A
side-effect of  Bush&amp;Co. putting their own U.S. Attorneys in power would be
protection  for themselves and their supporters from criminal charges.

18.  There Is No Real Economic Plan. We know that the Bush Administration
paid off its backers (and itself) by giving humongous tax breaks, for the  next
10 years, to the already wealthy and to large corporations. In  addition,
corporate tax-evasion was made easier via offshore listings and  by laying off
thousands of IRS auditors of high-end returns. All this was  done at a time when
the U.S. economy was in a sorry state and when the  treasury deficit from
those tax-breaks was growing even larger from  Iraq/Afghanistan/&quot;war-on-terror&quot;
costs. (Those war costs are now closing  in on a TRILLION dollars! and Congress
is about to vote on Bush's requests  for several hundred billion more). So far
as we know, the Bush  Administration has no plans for how to retire that debt
and no real plan  (other than the discredited &quot;trickle-down&quot; theory) for
restarting the  economy and creating well-paying jobs for skilled workers, many of
whom  have had their positions outsourced to foreign lands.

19.  Drowning Government In a Bathtub. We know that the HardRight
conservatives who control Bush policy don't really care what kind of debt  and deficits
their policies cause; in some ways, the more the better  since, as GOP honcho
Grover Norquist has admitted, they want to shrink  government &quot;down to the
size where we can drown it in the bathtub.&quot; They  want to decimate and starve
popular social programs from the New  Deal/Great Society eras, including, most
visibly, Head Start, Social  Security, Medicare (and real drug coverage for
seniors), student loans,  welfare assistance, public education, etc. (The IRS is
going to hire  private tax collectors!) Bush's plan to privatize a huge chunk
of the  Social Security System is still out there as a goal, though Republicans
are keeping quiet about it.

20. Privatizing Government  Functions. We know that in addition to trying to
privatize Social  Security and other government programs, CheneyBush have
begun privatizing  the military, partially through its all-volunteer army and by
employing  mercenaries (&quot;independent contractors&quot;) to carry out numerous
national-security functions, such as intelligence-gathering. (It's  estimated that
about 130,000 such mercenaries are on the ground in Iraq,  close to the same
number as official U.S. military forces.) The corporate  army known as
Blackwater is used not only in Iraq but was used  domestically as well, to police New
Orleans after Katrina. Private  corporations built and presumably will run
internment centers around the  U.S. in the event of a natural or terrorist
disaster. Under the ambiguous  provisions of martial-law, it is possible that those
who too actively  oppose government policy could be classified as aiding and
comforting  &quot;terrorists&quot; and be housed in those camps.

21. Who Cares What  You Drink or Breathe? We know that Bush environmental
policy (dealing  with air and water pollution, mineral extraction, national
parks, and so  on) is an unmitigated disaster, giving pretty much free rein to
corporations whose bottom lines do better when they don't have to pay  attention
to the public interest. It's the worst sort of  grab-the-money-and-run
scenario. Perhaps the best worst example of the  Administration's attitude toward
protecting the public's health can be  seen in the EPA giving the green light for
residents and workers to safely  return to their homes and jobs in Lower
Manhattan shortly after the WTC  Towers fell six years ago, even though EPA
scientists had determined that  the air was grossly polluted and dangerous.

22. It's Faith Over  Science, Myth Over Reality. We know that this attitude
(&quot;my mind is  made up, don't bother me with the facts&quot;) shows up most openly in
how  science is disregarded by the Bush Administration in favor of
faith-based  thinking. A good example would be the issue of global warming. Some of
this non-curiosity about reality may be based in fundamentalist religious,  even
Apocalyptic, beliefs. Much of Bush's bashing of science is designed  as
payback to his fundamentalist base, but the scary part is that a good  share of the
time he actually seems to believe what he's saying, about  evolution vs.
creationism, stem-cell research, abstinence education,  censoring the rewriting of
government scientific reports that differ from  the Bush party line, cutbacks
in R&amp;D grants for the National Science  Foundation, etc., ad nauseum. This
closed-mind attitude helps explain, on  a deeper level, why things aren't working
out in Iraq, or anywhere else  for that matter. Reality, to them, is an
annoyance that is best  ignored.

AMERICA OR GERMANY IN THE '30s?

In sum, we  know that permanent-war policy abroad and police-state tactics at
home are  taking us into a kind of American fascism domestically and an
imperial  foreign policy overseas. All aspects of the American polity are infected
with the militarist Know-Nothingism emanating from the top, with
governmental and vigilante-type crackdowns on protesters, dissent, free  speech, freedom
of assembly happening regularly on both the local and  federal levels. More
and more, America is resembling Germany in the early  1930s, with group pitted
against group while the central government  amasses more and more power and
control of its put-upon citizens, and  criticizing The Leader's policies is
denounced as unpatriotic or even  treasonous.

The good news is that after suffering through six-plus  years of the
CheneyBush presidency, and despite the Bush-compliant  corporate mass-media that often
disgraces the journalistic profession, the  public's blinders are falling
off. The Republicans can count on no more  than 30% of the voting population for
support. The 2006 defeat of the  Republicans in the House and Senate and Tom
DeLay's fall from power are  good symbols of this, and the true nature of these
men and their regime is  finally starting to hit home. Cheney is acknowledged
as the true power  behind the throne, and Bush is seen for what he is: an
insecure,  uncurious, arrogant, dangerous, dry-drunk bully who is endangering
U.S.  national interests abroad with his reckless and incompetently-managed
wars, his wrecking of the U.S. economy at home, and with his over-reaching  in all
areas.

If a Democratic president and vice president had  behaved similarly to Bush
and Cheney, they'd have been in the impeachment  dock in a minute.

Given all these scandals and more, and the loss  of public support for the
Iraq war and Republican policies in general, it  would seem that the Democrats
are in an enviable position to take back the  White House in 2008.

DEMS DOING &quot;BUSINESS AS  USUAL&quot;

But the Democrats, who were given the majority in  Congress by voters anxious
and desperate for major change, seem content to  fritter away their political
advantage by nibbling around the edges of  CheneyBush policy but rarely
attacking them frontally, especially on the  continuing war in Iraq and the attack
on Iran coming down the pike, and on  impeachment. It's more or less business
as usual in the nation's  capitol.

It's possible that the Democratic leadership believes that  because the war
is so unpopular and the scandal-ridden GOP is  self-destructing from within,
the Dems should just keep their heads down  and coast to a victory in 2008.

But a lot can happen between now  and November 2008 that could prove
disastrous for Democratic chances. For  example, if the Dems nominate the wrong
candidate for President, or  continue to demonstrate their cowardice and timidity on
the major issues  of our time, the disenchanted progressive, anti-war wing of
the party  could decide to sit on their hands in November or join with the
Greens for  a third-party bid. A U.S. attack on Iran potentially could change
the  political chemistry, as could a Mushareff fall in Pakistan, or a bad
recession or depression in the U.S. and world economy.

The  Democrats are not politically pure, to be sure. Too many are beholden to
the same interests that have corrupted the Republicans during the
CheneyBush years. However, in enough instances that matter -- and assuming  their base
could force them to move forward aggressively from a more  activist,
ideological position -- the Democrats would be different enough  to start to turn the
ship of state away from its reckless, dangerous  extremism and back more toward
the center and maybe even, on some issues,  in the direction of progressive
liberalism. #
