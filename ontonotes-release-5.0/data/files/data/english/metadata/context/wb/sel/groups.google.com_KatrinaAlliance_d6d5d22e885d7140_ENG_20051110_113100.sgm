The men from Blackwater USA arrived in New Orleans
right after Katrina hit. The company known for its
private security work guarding senior US diplomats in
Iraq beat the federal government and most aid
organizations to the scene in another devastated Gulf.
About 150 heavily armed Blackwater troops dressed in
full battle gear spread out into the chaos of New
Orleans. Officially, the company boasted of its forces
&quot;join[ing] the hurricane relief effort.&quot; But its men
on the ground told a different story.

Some patrolled the streets in SUVs with tinted windows
and the Blackwater logo splashed on the back; others
sped around the French Quarter in an unmarked car with
no license plates. They congregated on the corner of
St. James and Bourbon in front of a bar called 711,
where Blackwater was establishing a makeshift
headquarters. From the balcony above the bar, several
Blackwater guys cleared out what had apparently been
someone's apartment. They threw mattresses, clothes,
shoes and other household items from the balcony to
the street below. They draped an American flag from
the balcony's railing. More than a dozen troops from
the 82nd Airborne Division stood in formation on the
street watching the action.

Armed men shuffled in and out of the building as a
handful told stories of their past experiences in
Iraq. &quot;I worked the security detail of both Bremer and
Negroponte,&quot; said one of the Blackwater guys,
referring to the former head of the US occupation, L.
Paul Bremer, and former US Ambassador to Iraq John
Negroponte. Another complained, while talking on his
cell phone, that he was getting only $350 a day plus
his per diem. &quot;When they told me New Orleans, I said,
'What country is that in?'&quot; he said. He wore his
company ID around his neck in a case with the phrase
Operation Iraqi Freedom printed on it. The men from

'What country is that in?'&quot; he said. He wore his
company ID around his neck in a case with the phrase
Operation Iraqi Freedom printed on it.

In an hourlong conversation I had with four Blackwater
men, they characterized their work in New Orleans as
&quot;securing neighborhoods&quot; and &quot;confronting criminals.&quot;
They all carried automatic assault weapons and had
guns strapped to their legs. Their flak jackets were
covered with pouches for extra ammunition.

When asked what authority they were operating under,
one guy said, &quot;We're on contract with the Department
of Homeland Security.&quot; Then, pointing to one of his
comrades, he said, &quot;He was even deputized by the
governor of the state of Louisiana. We can make
arrests and use lethal force if we deem it necessary.&quot;
The man then held up the gold Louisiana law
enforcement badge he wore around his neck. Blackwater
spokesperson Anne Duke also said the company has a
letter from Louisiana officials authorizing its forces
to carry loaded weapons.

&quot;This vigilantism demonstrates the utter breakdown of
the government,&quot; says Michael Ratner, president of the
Center for Constitutional Rights. &quot;These private
security forces have behaved brutally, with impunity,
in Iraq. To have them now on the streets of New
Orleans is frightening and possibly illegal.&quot;

Blackwater is not alone. As business leaders and
government officials talk openly of changing the
demographics of what was one of the most culturally
vibrant of America's cities, mercenaries from
companies like DynCorp, Intercon, American Security
Group, Blackhawk, Wackenhut and an Israeli company
called Instinctive Shooting International (ISI) are
fanning out to guard private businesses and homes, as
well as government projects and institutions. Within
two weeks of the hurricane, the number of private
security companies registered in Louisiana jumped from
185 to 235. Some, like Blackwater, are under federal
contract. Others have been hired by the wealthy elite,
like F. Patrick Quinn III, who brought in private
security to guard his $3 million private estate and
his luxury hotels, which are under consideration for a
lucrative federal contract to house FEMA workers.

A possibly deadly incident involving Quinn's hired
guns underscores the dangers of private forces
policing American streets. On his second night in New
Orleans, Quinn's security chief, Michael Montgomery,
who said he worked for an Alabama company called
Bodyguard and Tactical Security (BATS), was with a
heavily armed security detail en route to pick up one
of Quinn's associates and escort him through the
chaotic city. Montgomery told me they came under fire
from &quot;black gangbangers&quot; on an overpass near the poor
Ninth Ward neighborhood. &quot;At the time, I was on the
phone with my business partner,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I
dropped the phone and returned fire.&quot;

Montgomery says he and his men were armed with AR-15s
and Glocks and that they unleashed a barrage of
bullets in the general direction of the alleged
shooters on the overpass. &quot;After that, all I heard was
moaning and screaming, and the shooting stopped. That
was it. Enough said.&quot;

Then, Montgomery says, &quot;the Army showed up, yelling at
us and thinking we were the enemy. We explained to
them that we were security. I told them what had
happened and they didn't even care. They just left.&quot;
Five minutes later, Montgomery says, Louisiana state
troopers arrived on the scene, inquired about the
incident and then asked him for directions on &quot;how
they could get out of the city.&quot; Montgomery says that
no one ever asked him for any details of the incident
and no report was ever made. &quot;One thing about
security,&quot; Montgomery says, &quot;is that we all coordinate
with each other--one family.&quot; That co-ordination
doesn't include the offices of the Secretaries of
State in Louisiana and Alabama, which have no record
of a BATS company.

A few miles away from the French Quarter, another
wealthy New Orleans businessman, James Reiss, who
serves in Mayor Ray Nagin's administration as chairman
of the city's Regional Transit Authority, brought in
some heavy guns to guard the elite gated community of
Audubon Place: Israeli mercenaries dressed in black
and armed with M-16s. Two Israelis patrolling the
gates outside Audubon told me they had served as
professional soldiers in the Israeli military, and one
boasted of having participated in the invasion of
Lebanon. &quot;We have been fighting the Palestinians all
day, every day, our whole lives,&quot; one of them tells
me. &quot;Here in New Orleans, we are not guarding from
terrorists.&quot; Then, tapping on his machine gun, he
says, &quot;Most Americans, when they see these things,
that's enough to scare them.&quot;

The men work for ISI, which describes its employees as
&quot;veterans of the Israeli special task forces from the
following Israeli government bodies: Israel Defense
Force (IDF), Israel National Police Counter Terrorism
units, Instructors of Israel National Police Counter
Terrorism units, General Security Service (GSS or
'Shin Beit'), Other restricted intelligence agencies.&quot;
The company was formed in 1993. Its website profile
says: &quot;Our up-to-date services meet the challenging
needs for Homeland Security preparedness and overseas
combat procedures and readiness. ISI is currently an
approved vendor by the US Government to supply
Homeland Security services.&quot;

Unlike ISI or BATS, Blackwater is operating under a
federal contract to provide 164 armed guards for FEMA
reconstruction projects in Louisiana. That contract
was announced just days after Homeland Security
Department spokesperson Russ Knocke told the
Washington Post he knew of no federal plans to hire
Blackwater or other private security firms. &quot;We
believe we've got the right mix of personnel in law
enforcement for the federal government to meet the
demands of public safety,&quot; he said. Before the
contract was announced, the Blackwater men told me,
they were already on contract with DHS and that they
were sleeping in camps organized by the federal
agency.

One might ask, given the enormous presence in New
Orleans of National Guard, US Army, US Border Patrol,
local police from around the country and practically
every other government agency with badges, why private
security companies are needed, particularly to guard
federal projects. &quot;It strikes me...that that may not
be the best use of money,&quot; said Illinois Senator
Barack Obama.

Blackwater's success in procuring federal contracts
could well be explained by major-league contributions
and family connections to the GOP. According to
election records, Blackwater's CEO and co-founder,
billionaire Erik Prince, has given tens of thousands
to Republicans, including more than $80,000 to the
Republican National Committee the month before Bush's
victory in 2000. This past June, he gave $2,100 to
Senator Rick Santorum's re-election campaign. He has
also given to House majority leader Tom DeLay and a
slew of other Republican candidates, including
Bush/Cheney in 2004. As a young man, Prince interned
with President George H.W. Bush, though he complained
at the time that he &quot;saw a lot of things I didn't
agree with--homosexual groups being invited in, the
budget agreement, the Clean Air Act, those kind of
bills. I think the Administration has been indifferent
to a lot of conservative concerns.&quot;

Prince, a staunch right-wing Christian, comes from a
powerful Michigan Republican family, and his father,
Edgar, was a close friend of former Republican
presidential candidate and antichoice leader Gary
Bauer. In 1988 the elder Prince helped Bauer start the
Family Research Council. Erik Prince's sister, Betsy,
once chaired the Michigan Republican Party and is
married to Dick DeVos, whose father, billionaire
Richard DeVos, is co-founder of the major Republican
benefactor Amway. Dick DeVos is also a big-time
contributor to the Republican Party and will likely be
the GOP candidate for Michigan governor in 2006.
Another Blackwater founder, president Gary Jackson, is
also a major contributor to Republican campaigns.

After the killing of four Blackwater mercenaries in
Falluja in March 2004, Erik Prince hired the Alexander
Strategy Group, a PR firm with close ties to GOPers
like DeLay. By mid-November the company was reporting
600 percent growth. In February 2005 the company hired
Ambassador Cofer Black, former coordinator for
counterterrorism at the State Department and former
director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center, as vice
chairman. Just as the hurricane was hitting,
Blackwater's parent company, the Prince Group, named
Joseph Schmitz, who had just resigned as the
Pentagon's Inspector General, as the group's chief
operating officer and general counsel.

While juicing up the firm's political connections,
Prince has been advocating greater use of private
security in international operations, arguing at a
symposium at the National Defense Industrial
Association earlier this year that firms like his are
more efficient than the military. In May Blackwater's
Jackson testified before Congress in an effort to gain
lucrative Homeland Security contracts to train 2,000
new Border Patrol agents, saying Blackwater
understands &quot;the value to the government of one-stop
shopping.&quot; With President Bush using the Katrina
disaster to try to repeal Posse Comitatus (the ban on
using US troops in domestic law enforcement) and
Blackwater and other security firms clearly initiating
a push to install their paramilitaries on US soil, the
war is coming home in yet another ominous way. As one
Blackwater mercenary said, &quot;This is a trend. You're
going to see a lot more guys like us in these
situations.&quot;

In an hourlong conversation I had with four Blackwater
men, they characterized their work in New Orleans as
