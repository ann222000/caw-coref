McCarty stopped posting as "Sylvan Morein" on Oct 4 10:32 pm.:

On October 2,  5:59 pm, "Eeyore" appears on r.a.o. for the first
time:

author%3Athe+author%3AEeyore&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N&amp;scoring=d&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_dr r

=off&amp;

It is well known that McCarty appears to suffer from a "Tourette's of the
pen" syndrome, whereby his generally disgusting posts are laced with
scatalogical references.

For five days, Jenn has been the target of abuse, instead of me.

In the future, it will become more clear whether "Eeyore" is
indeed an outlet for McCarty's diseased brain.  Or maybe "Eeyore" is
pretending to be "Bertie the Bunyip".  We're still investigating with our
SPARC computers, digital recorders, 16mm cameras, and other technical
equipment.

And Brian, switching to Jenn as a target for your abuse won't help you at
all. We'll see sure to that.

Back in 2001, several of us went as plaintiffs to the FBI, regarding an
individual who used, and continues to use, diverse methods of electronic
communications solely for harassment. This individual is quite knowledgeable
in the law, and appears to make a hobby of this activity, carefully avoiding
actual illegality. The number of ways one can harass an individual, without
actual commission of an illegal act, is quite remarkable.

This individual was apparently familiar with the FBI requirement of a forty
thousand dollar loss by the plaintiff. However, he was unfamiliar with the
discretion available to the FBI, and the personal sympathy his actions would
engender by the FBI toward the plaintiffs. Consequently, an investigation
with intent to prosecute was undertaken over the course of somewhat more
than a year.

At the end of the investigation, the case was presented, with a novel legal
theory, to the U.S. Attorney, District of Connecticut.  The DA declined to
prosecute, because the novelty of the legal theory developed by the FBI was
not felt supportablle under then current law. We were disappointed, but were
told that we had the full sympathy of that FBI office. We were gratified at
the support by the FBI to common citizens of modest means.

During the course of the investigation, several of us actually were perhaps
the first to introduce some members of the FBI Computer Crime Unit to
usenet. We assume that subsequently, the FBI developed a general interest in
this medium, as well as certain other mediums that can be used for
harassment, and that at some point, our seminal case contributed to the
drafting of legislation. Senator Arlen Spector represents my state,
Pennsylvania, and has himself been a prosecuting attorney.

I support this law because it fills a gaping loophole that allows persons to
suffer for years at the hands of anonymous harassment. There is, of course,
the potential for abuse. To counter that, we have a constitutional
guarantee. Whether or not this law survives in the present form, there
exists a need for prohibition against electronic harassment. A
constitutional challenge might validate the law if the harassment was:
1. not a form of communication. Without going into further details, this is
very feasible for the harasser.
2. clearly libelous, as defined by civil law. By criminalizing a civil
offense, the plaintiff is relieved of the hefty burden of sueing someone,
since the state takes his place.

I ask any of you who may feel the law infringes on civil liberties to
consider the possibility that some law can be created that will both protect
civil liberties and those indivduals who now suffer the predations of
individuals who are very possibly mentally ill.

To my way of thinking, this is directed only at those thin-skinned
enough to be worried about (and answer/interact with) such posts in the
first place. That would be mostly Americans as it happens.

This is Usenet. The hide of a rhinocerous and the general sensitivity
of a concrete block are required attributes for active participation.
It seems that those denizens who start this crap are excellent at the
concrete block part, and sockpuppets have no hide to be sensitive.
Between these two, they have enough traction to keep at it until they
get the desired response. And the sensitive and easily offended haven't
the personal courage, hygiene or basic intelligence to ignore them,
giving them even more traction.

And when did YOU stop beating your wife? (The only appropriate answer
to which is "I never have." with a smile and NO further qualification.)

True.  The point of my quotations from Morein is to reinforce your
comments - clearly someone who routinely accuses another falsely of
being a pedophile, a stock market swindler, and brags about conducting
a DNS attack on someone else's website would have little traction to
bring an action under this new law. One cannot claim to be a victim
while doing the same and worse.  Likely this is why the FBI wouldn't
pursue any action on behalf of "Morein the Victim" when "Morein the
Criminal" has such a long track record available with a simple google
search.  Like his rejected claim against Drexel College, where the
school pointed out the deficiencies of plaintiff Morein who has spent
years wasting the time of their professors, courts don't like their
time wasted by those using the court process as an extension of their
personal vendettas.

Mpffff... never mind the courts. Those who operate in the realm of
personal attack almost exclusively are often those most surprised when
they are attacked with equal viciousness. However, and as it happens
here most often, the counter-attack is justified by the actual facts,
the initial attack is not.

I am wondering of Mulder and Scully were involved with that purported
FBI response in any case.

Codifus,
As it happens, McCarty was the person against whom a number of us made
the complaint, and who was the subject of the     FBI investigation. In the
course of our research into McCarty's activities, we discovered that he has
a long history of investment fraud. My actions are intended to prevent
McCarty from profiting by his schemes of deceit.
Before 2001, when we became subject to cyber attacks by McCarty, we had
no knowledge or interest in his activities. It is his own foolishness,
unusual for someone who wants to swindle, that he would bring himself to our
attention. All of the recent actions which I take credit for are after the
fact of the FBI investigation, and are intended to remind Brian that the
fraud he contemplates will never come to fruition. Noodling someone's
website counter by manually pressing the reload button on a browser is
hardly a DNS attack. However, it is worth noting that the FBI verified that
McCarty infiltrated a film project I was running, and sent out damaging
messages in my name. If it ever comes to court, I will use these records
against McCarty.
And Brian, I remind you that all your efforts are futile. You have tried
many things. You will try many more. The result will be the same: we will
continue to make the investing public aware of your dishonest nature and
your black heart. You are a truely evil person. We stand ever ready to
insure that "coralseas the scam" has no future, ever. You will live out your
life with nothing more.

Exactly, Graham.  These flamefests are always short on actual facts -
just because someone anonymously says that McCarty is home to
investment frauds doesn't make it true.  Here we apparently have "Bob
Morein" (although there's no way to know, there's no such person listed
in any directory of anything) slandering someone named "McCarty", who
he apparently has never even met or seen. He claims to be a do-gooder -
man, I've allways hated do-gooders. Talking like serious investment
fraud had been done by the same guy who "infiltrated his film project".
I see no listing anywhere of any kind of "film project" involving Bob

required to investigate if under SEC regulations, investment fraud is a
serious matter for  most governements and an extraditable offense. Even
"soundhaspriority" said that they are required to investigate over

anything to support such an assertion. The corporation listing for
Australia shows a Coral Sea Studios apparently owned by McCarty, that
continues to operate unimpeded. We're to believe that all of these
investigators missed or ignored or excused investment fraud that Mr.
Bob Morein has found, and since they won't do anything he's decided to
take the law in his own hands and with his do-gooder cape, do what the
authorities won't do. The fact that there's nothing but nothing to

Like most of these webwars Graham, this one has no foundation. ignore

&gt;&gt; &gt; True.  The point of my quotations from Morein is to reinforce your
&gt;&gt; &gt; comments - clearly someone who routinely accuses another falsely of
&gt;&gt; &gt; being a pedophile, a stock market swindler, and brags about conducting
&gt;&gt; &gt; a DNS attack on someone else's website would have little traction to
&gt;&gt; &gt; bring an action under this new law. One cannot claim to be a victim
&gt;&gt; &gt; while doing the same and worse.  Likely this is why the FBI wouldn't
&gt;&gt; &gt; pursue any action on behalf of &quot;Morein the Victim&quot; when &quot;Morein the
&gt;&gt; &gt; Criminal&quot; has such a long track record available with a simple google
&gt;&gt; &gt; search.  Like his rejected claim against Drexel College, where the
&gt;&gt; &gt; school pointed out the deficiencies of plaintiff Morein who has spent
&gt;&gt; &gt; years wasting the time of their professors, courts don't like their
&gt;&gt; &gt; time wasted by those using the court process as an extension of their
&gt;&gt; &gt; personal vendettas.

&gt;&gt; Codifus,
&gt;&gt;     As it happens, McCarty was the person against whom a number of us
&gt;&gt; made
&gt;&gt; the complaint, and who was the subject of the     FBI investigation. In
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; course of our research into McCarty's activities, we discovered that he
&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; a long history of investment fraud. My actions are intended to prevent
&gt;&gt; McCarty from profiting by his schemes of deceit.
&gt;&gt;     Before 2001, when we became subject to cyber attacks by McCarty, we
&gt;&gt; had
&gt;&gt; no knowledge or interest in his activities. It is his own foolishness,
&gt;&gt; unusual for someone who wants to swindle, that he would bring himself to
&gt;&gt; our
&gt;&gt; attention. All of the recent actions which I take credit for are after
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; fact of the FBI investigation, and are intended to remind Brian that the
&gt;&gt; fraud he contemplates will never come to fruition. Noodling someone's
&gt;&gt; website counter by manually pressing the reload button on a browser is
&gt;&gt; hardly a DNS attack. However, it is worth noting that the FBI verified
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; McCarty infiltrated a film project I was running, and sent out damaging
&gt;&gt; messages in my name. If it ever comes to court, I will use these records
&gt;&gt; against McCarty.
&gt;&gt;     And Brian, I remind you that all your efforts are futile. You have
&gt;&gt; tried
&gt;&gt; many things. You will try many more. The result will be the same: we will
&gt;&gt; continue to make the investing public aware of your dishonest nature and

You assume a great deal more power than you have. Apart from that,
please explain the "we" bit. Yes, you may be the third-favorite

that still does not give "we". That is, unless you enjoy being its
pseudopod.

And, as it happens, whatever and whomever you or this so-called Brian

joined at the hip and serve none but each other's complete needs... the
evidence is singular and clear. Were either of you two to disappear
from the face of the earth (and/or Usenet) the other would quietly fold
its tents and disappear into the night... a result profoundly to be
wished. So, if you go first, the other will be sure to follow. Set a

Mr. Morein:

What do you do for a living that leaves you so much time for such a
singular and quixotic cause? Keep in mind that calling yourself so
emphatically a "GENTLEMAN" suggests many things, few of which are
worthwhile.

a) The classical definition of a "gentleman" is one who needs not earn
a living. Hence my question above. There is absolutely no shame if this
applies, but &gt;I&lt; am trying to get at the core of your claim.
b) The more typical definition of a "gentleman" is one who rests his
weight on his elbows when... and so forth. Given your recent rants and
"attestations", this could be seen to apply at least superficially.

Just to keep the record straight as I am writing for myself.

I am no gentleman. I attempt to be open, honest, immediate and direct.
Being so and a "gentleman" are mutually exclusive under most
conditions. I try to be courteous, generally pleasant and I can claim
with absolute honest to be very patient. But I am not even a little bit
'tolerant'. It is this last if nothing else that excludes me from any
claim to being a "gentleman".

And you?

">

I note you fail to respond to any of the FACTS I developed in just a
little checking.  I repeat again in case you actually think you have a
legitimate response, "Mr. Gentleman":

Talking like serious investment
fraud had been done by the same guy who "infiltrated his film project".
I see no listing anywhere of any kind of "film project" involving Bob
Morein. In fact if the FBI really had uncovered such a fraud they are
required to investigate if under SEC regulations, investment fraud is a
serious matter for  most governements and an extraditable offense. Even
"soundhaspriority" said that they are required to investigate over
$40grand. Funny theres nothing anywhere, news stories, court documents,
anything to support such an assertion. The corporation listing for
Australia shows a Coral Sea Studios apparently owned by McCarty, that
continues to operate unimpeded. We're to believe that all of these
investigators missed or ignored or excused investment fraud that Mr.
Bob Morein has found, and since they won't do anything he's decided to
take the law in his own hands and with his do-gooder cape, do what the
authorities won't do. The fact that there's nothing but nothing to
support this Bob Morein "soundhaspriority" assertion makes it false.
What he called "noodling someone's website" according to the new law is
annoyance and harassment, and "soundhaspriorty" admitting this activity
perhaps will see him as the first serial annoyer  prosecuted under this
new legislation.

I checked a few other of your so-called "facts", easy to do because
Australias corporate rules are very transparent. The Baskin Robbins you
said is managed by McCarty is not, it is however managed by a
corporation not registered to anyone by that name. The address you
claim is his is not, there is no property at that address in his name.
There are two other companies registered to McCarty but none seem  to
be connected to anything you have claimed. Court records in Australia
or California show nothing, and you've repeatedly launched the "child
molester" attack (equal to the "nazi" attack for its showing the
desperation of the person making the charge) despite knowing that no
foreign country is going to allow some other country's child molester
to move there - not even places like Thailand. You've admitted
harassing and net terrorist-type activities by "noodling" a website.
Not something any "gentleman" or "man" I know would do. You haven't
explained why your local police have warned Philadelphia to be wary of
you - yes, I'm sure McCarty traveled to your local shopping mall and
did this too and yes isn't he clever for knowing where all the cameras
are so that he didn't get photographed. And major newspapers have
published stories about Robert Morein intimating that you engaged in
harassing activities of a major university so vile that their own
university didn't even file a response knowing the court would see the
nature of your filings and rule in their favor which they did.
Reputable sources indicate that McCarty on the other hand is a sound
engineer of some minor import, with a lengthy resume found in several
locations that would seem to be accurate. Then we've got your
assertions that can't be verified, your proven history of abuse of the
court process and lack of any explanation for your failure to have
finished your studies or any professional resume of any kind as well as
refusal to respond with any shred of evidence to information that is
clearly available to anyone with half a brain.

Do you realize how demented you sound, Mr. Morein? Or is it hate? Hate
of someone that's had some success in fields you covet, engineering and
the arts? Hate rots out your heart from the core, but as a 50-something
you must be missing any core by now.

I've noted that Peter Wieck too has pointed out the absurdity of your
claim that "we" are monitoring various activities of those you hate. As
WE can see, there is no "we", Mr. Morein. Only you, a pathetic old fool
that clearly at one time was considered intelligent and a "man" with
promise, all to be squandered apparently by unchecked lowlevel mental
illness.

Sad, really Mr. Morein.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; time wasted by those using the court process as an extension of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; their
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; personal vendettas.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Codifus,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;     As it happens, McCarty was the person against whom a number of us
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; made
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the complaint, and who was the subject of the     FBI investigation.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; course of our research into McCarty's activities, we discovered that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; he
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a long history of investment fraud. My actions are intended to prevent
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; McCarty from profiting by his schemes of deceit.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;     Before 2001, when we became subject to cyber attacks by McCarty,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; had
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; no knowledge or interest in his activities. It is his own foolishness,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; unusual for someone who wants to swindle, that he would bring himself
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; our
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; attention. All of the recent actions which I take credit for are after
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fact of the FBI investigation, and are intended to remind Brian that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fraud he contemplates will never come to fruition. Noodling someone's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; website counter by manually pressing the reload button on a browser is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hardly a DNS attack. However, it is worth noting that the FBI verified
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; McCarty infiltrated a film project I was running, and sent out
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; damaging
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; messages in my name. If it ever comes to court, I will use these
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; records
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; against McCarty.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;     And Brian, I remind you that all your efforts are futile. You have
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; tried
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; many things. You will try many more. The result will be the same: we
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; continue to make the investing public aware of your dishonest nature
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; your black heart. You are a truely evil person. We stand ever ready to

You have not developed any facts. You can't even discover that I am real.
You simply claim to, while choosing to remain anonymous. Therefore, you have
no credibility whatsoever. In fact, you could be McCarty, given that your
phraseology and vocabulary are strikingly like his. You have dredged up
claims by McCarty going way back, spending much time to distort the facts. I
give my word to what I say. I invite anyone except Mr. McCarty to call me
for a cordial conversation about Mr. McCarty, who is, in my opinion, and
evil scammer, swindler, and all-around bad person.

And I warn you again, Brian, it doesn't matter what you do here. You have
tried many things. You will try many more. Nothing you can do will stop the
monitoring of your evil activities. For the rest of your life, you have a
zero chance of scamming. We will make absolutely sure of that. You burned
OPM with Coral Seas. You won't get a chance to do it again.

And remember this, Brian. The FBI has an office in Sydney. They know where
you are. You can be extradited for a crime against a U.S.citizen.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; corrupt government.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To my way of thinking, this is directed only at those thin-skinned
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; enough to be worried about (and answer/interact with) such posts in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; first place. That would be mostly Americans as it happens.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is Usenet. The hide of a rhinocerous and the general
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sensitivity
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of a concrete block are required attributes for active
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; participation.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It seems that those denizens who start this crap are excellent at
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; concrete block part, and sockpuppets have no hide to be sensitive.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; True.  The point of my quotations from Morein is to reinforce your
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; comments - clearly someone who routinely accuses another falsely of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; being a pedophile, a stock market swindler, and brags about
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; conducting
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a DNS attack on someone else's website would have little traction to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bring an action under this new law. One cannot claim to be a victim
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; while doing the same and worse.  Likely this is why the FBI wouldn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pursue any action on behalf of &quot;Morein the Victim&quot; when &quot;Morein the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Criminal&quot; has such a long track record available with a simple
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; google
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; search.  Like his rejected claim against Drexel College, where the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; school pointed out the deficiencies of plaintiff Morein who has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spent
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; years wasting the time of their professors, courts don't like their

Unless you are McCarty, which is a distinct possibility, neither you, nor
Mr. Wieck, have any knowledge of the damage and pain Mr. McCarty has caused
other people. Such information is known only to the victims, the FBI, and
Mr. McCarty. Unless you are Mr. McCarty, neither you, nor Mr. Wieck can make
a judgement based on anything other than usenet posts, which means that you
know literally nothing about what has transpired.

The opinions expressed by you or anybody else on this newsgroup have no
relation to what has actually transpired. They will have no effect on
strategies I or my associates will continue to employ to ensure that Mr.
McCarty cannot in the future damage other people, either by fraud or by
criminal harassment.

Mr. McCarty has committed what is now defined as criminal harassment. As a
victim, along with several other people, I have a right to be angry about
it.

Brian L. McCarty is an evil man, and I intend to ensure that he will have no
further victims of his scamming activities. Sentiments expressed by you or
anybody else on usenet will have no effect on my notifications regarding Mr.
Brian L. McCarty, an individual residing at 65 Vasey Esplanade, Trinity
Beach, Cairns, Australia, who is in the employ of Baskin Robbins.

Brian L. McCarty is a would-be entrepreneur in the Cairns area who has been
touting something called "Coral Sea Studios" for a number of years. This
website, http://www.coralseastudios.com , has  a history of the use of
1. false endorsements
2. fictitious employees and representatives
3. assertions of business relationships and partnerships which do not exist.

At one time, my name, Robert Morein, appeared on this website as an
endorsement, completely without my approval.

Recently, garbled versions of this notice have appeared in various forum,
allegedly authored by me, my father, or an entity "OFFICIAL RAM BLUEBOOK
VALUATION". The motive appears to be to generally confuse the legitmacy of
this notice.

Mr. McCarty has a side interest in harassing sellers on the usenet
marketplace rec.audio.marketplace. Also, his other website,
http://www.worldjazz.com , has used similar false advertising in order to
attract investors.

Currently, McCarty appears to be rennovating the coralseas website. Although
I am not aware that he has ever succeeded in taking anybody's money, it
appears that he still has the desire to do so. I would advise anyone who
considers investing in Coral Seas to take their money elsewhere. Failing
that, a prospective investor should do very careful verification of
McCarty's claims, since it seems to be his guiding principle that some
investors will simply take his word.

McCarty is an American expatriate, originally from the Chicago area, then LA
where he worked as a sound mixer,currently living in Cairns Australia, where
he manages the Baskin-Robbins ice cream franchise located at
Shop G6, 59 The Esplanade
Cairns QLD 4870
07 4051 4034

McCarty lives in the Coral Sands apartment complex at 65 Vasey Esplanade,
Trinity beach, a bit north of metropolitan Cairns.

Baskin-Robbins Australia may be contacted at
http://www.baskinrobbins.com.au/home/contactus.asp

Individuals who wish to discuss this with me further may call me, Robert
Morein, at (U.S.) (215) 646-4894. Eastern Time Zone (EST).

Mr. Brian L. McCarty's efforts at fraud are constantly changing, but this is
an example:
On http://coralseastudios.com/dir.html , the statement is made:
"Shanghai Regional Film Studio joint venture agreement in place (Feb 2006)"

This is FALSE. Mr. McCarty is not participating in any such venture.  He has
no business relationship with any studio in Shanghai at all.

Origianlly, Mr. McCarty claimed that he had a joint venture with "Shanghai
Film Studio", which is an actual company. I contacted their legal secretary,
who affirmed that they had no relationship with Mr. McCarty and in fact, had
never heard of him. When I publicized this on usenet, Mr. McCarty changed
the statement to read as it does now, as of 10:23 PST, with reference to a
"regional film studio joint venture."  But this is also completely false.
Mr. McCarty is completely alone, and seeks to deceive the penny stock market
into giving him money.

Mr. McCarty, I want you to understand something very clearly. If you suceed
in attracting any investment money based on false pretenses, as you
advertise on your website today, we will smash you in court. We are watching
you very closely. If you step over the line, the hammer will come down on
you with the full force of the law, before you have any opportunity to move
that money. And there is nothing you can say or do to change our
watchfulness.

Ok now you've told him again and he is obviously very scared

adopt the tactic of very quietly lying in wait and then
"smash him in court" when he "scams" again, as promised?

Both these things would benefit the general populace no end.

He can't stop - even when proven wrong, he can't stop.  It's an illness and
has completely dibilatated my sick son Robert Morein his whole life.

My son Bob Morein is an ignorant 53 year old unemployed
loser, who couldn't get a college degree even AFTER suing Drexel University
for it. And he tried to claim the work of his professor as HIS in a patent
application.  Any real engineer/machinist would steer clear of Bob's newest
life failure, solar engineering.

This after he spent thousands of MY money buying a basement full of
now-worthless camera and lighting equipment, thinking in his flawed way that
this equipment would make him a famous filmmaker.  Now it sits unused like
all his attempts at a career, because he found out it takes WORK and not
bullshitting.  He's now bought a pile of sound equipment too, only to find
out that it takes WORK to be a sound engineer, too!

&gt; Doctoral student takes intellectual property case to Supreme Court
&gt; By L. STUART DITZEN
&gt; Philadelphia Inquirer

&gt; PHILADELPHIA -Even the professors who dismissed him from a doctoral program
&gt; at Drexel University agreed that Robert Morein was uncommonly smart.

&gt; They apparently didn't realize that he was uncommonly stubborn too - so much
&gt; so that he would mount a court fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court
&gt; to challenge his dismissal.
">

The Supremes have already rejected this appeal, btw.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;It's a personality trait I have - I'm a tenacious guy,&quot; said Morein, a
&gt; pleasantly eccentric man regarded by friends as an inventive genius. &quot;And we
&gt; do come to a larger issue here.&quot;
">

An "inventive genius" that has never invented anything.  And hardly
"pleasantly" eccentric.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A five-year legal battle between this unusual ex-student and one of
&gt; Philadelphia's premier educational institutions has gone largely unnoticed
&gt; by the media and the public.
">

Because no one gives a shit about a 50 year old loser.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But it has been the subject of much attention in academia.

&gt; Drexel says it dismissed Morein in 1995 because he failed, after eight
&gt; years, to complete a thesis required for a doctorate in electrical and
&gt; computer engineering.
">

Not to mention the 12 years it took him to get thru high school!
BWAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Morein, 50, of Dresher, Pa., contends that he was dismissed only after his
&gt; thesis adviser &quot;appropriated&quot; an innovative idea Morein had developed in a
&gt; rarefied area of thought called &quot;estimation theory&quot; and arranged to have it
&gt; patented.
">

A contention rejected by three courts. From a 50 YEAR OLD that has
done NOTHING PRODUCTIVE with his life.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In February 2000, Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge Esther R. Sylvester
&gt; ruled that Morein's adviser indeed had taken his idea.
">

An idea that was worth nothing, because it didn't work.  Just like
Robert Morein, who has never worked a day in his life.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sylvester held that Morein had been unjustly dismissed and she ordered
&gt; Drexel to reinstate him or refund his tuition.
">

Funnily enough, Drexel AGREED to reinstate Morein, who rejected the
offer because he knew he was and IS a failed loser.  Spending daddy's
money to cover up his lack of productivity.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That brought roars of protest from the lions of academia. There is a long
&gt; tradition in America of noninterference by the courts in academic decisions.

&gt; Backed by every major university in Pennsylvania and organizations
&gt; representing thousands of others around the country, Drexel appealed to the
&gt; state Superior Court.

&gt; The appellate court, by a 2-1 vote, reversed Sylvester in June 2001 and
&gt; restored the status quo. Morein was, once again, out at Drexel. And the
&gt; time-honored axiom that courts ought to keep their noses out of academic
&gt; affairs was reasserted.

&gt; The state Supreme Court declined to review the case and, in an ordinary
&gt; litigation, that would have been the end of it.

&gt; But Morein, in a quixotic gesture that goes steeply against the odds, has
&gt; asked the highest court in the land to give him a hearing.
">

Daddy throws more money down the crapper.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; His attorney, Faye Riva Cohen, said the Supreme Court appeal is important
&gt; even if it fails because it raises the issue of whether a university has a
&gt; right to lay claim to a student's ideas - or intellectual property - without
&gt; compensation.

&gt; &quot;Any time you are in a Ph.D. program, you are a serf, you are a slave,&quot; said
&gt; Cohen. Morein &quot;is concerned not only for himself. He feels that what
&gt; happened to him is pretty common.&quot;
">

It's called HIGHER EDUCATION, honey. The students aren't in charge,
the UNIVERSITY and PROFESSORS are.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Drexel's attorney, Neil J. Hamburg, called Morein's appeal - and his claim
&gt; that his idea was stolen - &quot;preposterous.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I will eat my shoe if the Supreme Court hears this case,&quot; declared Hamburg.
&gt; &quot;We're not even going to file a response. He is a brilliant guy, but his
&gt; intelligence should be used for the advancement of society rather than
&gt; pursuing self-destructive litigation.&quot;
">

No shit sherlock.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The litigation began in 1997, when Morein sued Drexel claiming that a
&gt; committee of professors had dumped him after he accused his faculty adviser,
&gt; Paul Kalata, of appropriating his idea.

&gt; His concept was considered to have potential value for businesses in
&gt; minutely measuring the internal functions of machines, industrial processes
&gt; and electronic systems.

&gt; The field of &quot;estimation theory&quot; is one in which scientists attempt to
&gt; calculate what they cannot plainly observe, such as the inside workings of a
&gt; nuclear plant or a computer.
">

My estimation theory?  There is NO brain at work inside the head of
Robert Morein, only sawdust.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
- Hide quoted text - - Show quoted text -
">

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Prior to Morein's dismissal, Drexel looked into his complaint against Kalata
&gt; and concluded that the associate professor had done nothing wrong. Kalata,
&gt; through a university lawyer, declined to comment.

&gt; At a nonjury trial before Sylvester in 1999, Morein testified that Kalata in
&gt; 1990 had posed a technical problem for him to study for his thesis. It
&gt; related to estimation theory.

&gt; Kalata, who did not appear at the trial, said in a 1998 deposition that a
&gt; Cherry Hill company for which he was a paid consultant, K-Tron
&gt; International, had asked him to develop an alternate estimation method for
&gt; it. The company manufactures bulk material feeders and conveyors used in
&gt; industrial processes.

&gt; Morein testified that, after much study, he experienced &quot;a flash of
&gt; inspiration&quot; and came up with a novel mathematical concept to address the
&gt; problem Kalata had presented.

&gt; Without his knowledge, Morein said, Kalata shared the idea with K-Tron.

&gt; K-Tron then applied for a patent, listing Kalata and Morein as co-inventors.

&gt; Morein said he agreed &quot;under duress&quot; to the arrangement, but felt &quot;locked
&gt; into a highly disadvantageous situation.&quot; As a result, he testified, he
&gt; became alienated from Kalata.

&gt; As events unfolded, Kalata signed over his interest in the patent to K-Tron.
&gt; The company never capitalized on the technology and eventually allowed the
&gt; patent to lapse. No one made any money from it.
">

Because it was bogus.  Even Kalata was mortified that he was a victim
of this SCAMSTER, Robert Morein.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In 1991, Morein went to the head of Drexel's electrical engineering
&gt; department, accused Kalata of appropriating his intellectual property, and
&gt; asked for a new faculty adviser.
">

The staff at Drexel laughed wildly at the ignorance of Robert Morein.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He didn't get one. Instead, a committee of four professors, including
&gt; Kalata, was formed to oversee Morein's thesis work.

&gt; Four years later, the committee dismissed him, saying he had failed to
&gt; complete his thesis.
">

So Morein fucks up his first couple years, gets new faculty advisers
(a TEAM), and then fucks up again!  Brilliant!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Morein claimed that the committee intentionally had undermined him.
">

Morein makes LOTS of claims that are nonsense.  One look thru the
usenet proves it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Judge Sylvester agreed. In her ruling, Sylvester wrote: &quot;It is this court's
&gt; opinion that the defendants were motivated by bad faith and ill will.&quot;
">

So much for political machine judges.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court receives 7,000 appeals a year and agrees to hear only
&gt; about 100 of them.

&gt; Hamburg, Drexel's attorney, is betting the high court will reject Morein's
&gt; appeal out of hand because its focal point - concerning a student's right to
&gt; intellectual property - was not central to the litigation in the
&gt; Pennsylvania courts.
&gt; Morein said he understands it's a long shot, but he feels he must pursue it.
">

Just like all the failed "causes" Morein pursues.  Heck, he's been
chasing another "Brian McCarty" for years and yet has ZERO impact on
anything.

Failure.  Look it up in Websters.  You'll see a picture of Robert
Morein.  The poster boy for SCAMMING LOSERS.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;I had to seek closure,&quot; he said.

&gt; Without a doctorate, he said, he has been unable to pursue a career he had
&gt; hoped would lead him into research on artificial intelligence.
">

Who better to tell us about "artificial intelligence".
BWAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As it is, Morein lives at home with his father and makes a modest income
&gt; from stock investments. He has written a film script that he is trying to
&gt; make into a movie. And in the basement of his father's home he is working on
&gt; an invention, an industrial pump so powerful it could cut steel with a

TT,
I can quite understand and sympathize with the irritation. But as I
remarked to Graham, this is not for you. It is not an emotional response.
This is continued publicization of Brian L. McCarty's fraud, to prevent
people from making uninformed investments with him. Loss of hard earned
money can be quite a blow to the average investor, which gives this
precedencee over the inconvenience to you. My suggestion, as always, is
simply to not read my notices, and, if you wish, use a killfile to prevent
my posts from appearing in your reader.

TT,
I reviewed the thread to determine when it became cross-posted into
aus.hifi. On the machine currently available at this location, Malibu, it
begins with a post by Peter Wieck. However, I cannot be sure that I am not
myself responsible for the crosspost, or continuing a crosspost. When I
transit to the east coast, which I do periodically, I will know more. One of
the tricks of Mr. McCarty is to crosspost a thread using an alias. Note
also, that although you address only me, Mr. McCarty is a very active
participant in these newsgroups, using a number of aliases. The style and
content of posts made by "codifus" strongly resembles McCarty's.

In the meantime, I offer my apology if I am, in fact, responsible for
crossposting this into your newsgroup. In this regard, I can only point out
that I am a continuing victim of active harassment by McCarty.  But a
balance must be struck between thwarting his strenuous attempts at swindle,
and the interests of usenet news readers.

: TT,

irritation. But as I

emotional response.
: This is continued publicization of Brian L. McCarty's
fraud, to prevent
: people from making uninformed investments with him. Loss
of hard earned

gives this

as always, is
: simply to not read my notices, and, if you wish, use a
killfile to prevent

Several points:

1)  Kill filing won't stop me still seeing other people's
responses to you.

2) Even filtering won't work as even you on topic audio
threads usually end up with the same words in them!

3) Then there are the clones/impostors as well to consider.

4) Caveat Emptor!!!!  Stop worrying about other people's
money!  Besides, no one cares when idiots get scammed
anyway.

Listen to everyone's best advice to you and "get over it!"

Hint:  The way you are perceived by *normal* people is that

No, I don't. However, the anonymity of usenet forces reliance on textual
analysis and patterns of posting to narrow the possibilities of a poster's
identity. For example, if you examine this thread in totality, which I
cannot currently do, and you see that the existing thread was crossposted
into aus.hifi by, say, "codifus", it suggests that "codifus" may be McCarty.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Hint:  The way you are perceived by *normal* people is that

I do understand that. However, the objective is not to win sympathy from
usenet readers. Given the nature of the medium, it simply isn't possible.
The purpose is to keep the red flag raised about Mr. McCarty's fraudulent
representations. Given all the noise about McCarty, if an investor does a
Google search, it will give him pause. He will dig deeper. He may avail
himself of other sources of information. That is all I can reasonably
expect.

He

TT, I wish that were the case. In fact, I have spoken at length with lawyers
in Cairns about Mr. McCarty. They do not appear to like him very much. But
the problem with prosecution for fraud is that practically speaking, there
can be no prosecution unless or until someone suffers monetary loss to
McCarty. As of this date, I am unaware of anyone who has given McCarty money
since he was abandoned by his former partner, Jeff Wexler.  Far be it for me
to claim this is a result of all the brouhaha of these usenet posts. But
something is keeping people away from McCarty's clutches. I ask you to
consider the inconvenience of these posts, versus the real benefit to an
"investor", who might otherwise be deceived by McCarty's claims into giving
him money that he might never see again. Consider: inconvenience, versus
pain and suffering.

I Googled the topic and the second link I clicked had this advice:

"select Communicator &gt; Newsgroups, then Edit &gt; Message Filters"

Perhaps you can verify that.
