First, I don't post much but my thoughts, purrs, and d*g wags have
been with Norm and Harrie, Kilkini, and esp. Tweed.

The results on Annie's biopsy hadn't come in when I picked her up from
the vet yesterday.  She had stayed overnight so they could hydrate
her.  When I told my mom that, she panicked over what the stay was
going to cost.  Guess what they charged for postop, recovery, and
hospital stay?  $6.00!!!

The vet said the tumor is on the left side and has pushed the tongue
over.  Then it goes around the front to the right side and down her
throat, though she doesn't know how far.  Her lungs are clear.  She
also has something on the roof of her mouth and the vet took a sample
of that too.  I'm only working a 1/2 day so I can be home with her,
and I hope to hear something this afternoon.

She's on a strong antibiotic, pain meds and prednisone to ease the
inflammation.  They also sent home cans of Science Diet a/d to feed
her.

I was so pleased when I brought her home.  I put a bit of the food on
a plate and added some water and she took right to it!  I haven't seen
her eat like that in a while so at least she's comfortable enough to
eat.  She even ate some kibble out of her brother's bowl.  Speaking of
Jake, when I took Annie out of the carrier, he went under the bed.
Guess he thought he might be next.  : )

The vet hasn't exactly said what she thinks it is but I'm guessing
saquamous cell carcinoma, which was her first thought.  After we know
for sure, there is an oncologist I can consult with.  I know chemo may
be an option but I don't know if that's financially feasible.

This is a new clinic that I had been planning on switching to.  I
called my old vet's office and asked them to fax my pet info to the
new vet.  I mentioned that I wanted to drop a note to Dr. Boller, to
let her know that it wasn't anything personal.  The girl told me that
Dr. Boller didn't work there anymore.  She decided to stay home with
her baby, and maybe just work part time.  I had just spoken to her
about 1 1/2 weeks ago.  At least this made it easier to make the
move.  Though I really wanted to tell her what was going on with
Annie.

Thanks for all the purrs and thoughts.  I don't have a pc at home but
will post on Monday the results.

Purrs,
Theresa

No-one can tell you what to do about Annie.  You will make your own
decision.
I've had to make similar decisions.  Sometimes I decide to go on with
treatment and sometimes I decide it's not a good option for my pet, despite
how much I love them.
If I were you, I would ask the vets what they thought Annie's prognosis is.
If it is very poor I would let her go.  Sorry, it's sooo hard.

I'm so sorry it's not looking too good.  I lost my Circe (RB) to
squamous cell carcinoma in the mouth and sinuses.  There isn't much they
can do short of chemo, and there you have to decide whether chemo will
truly give Annie a lot more time and happiness, or just a little time,
pushing her beyond where she wants to be here.  It's a tough thing, and
I don't envy you.

Theresa, my heart goes out to you if your Annie has squamous cell
carcinoma that advanced.  I really hope it's not.  But if it is, I
would like to tell you about my experiences with it when I had Betty.

Betty's cancer was detected fairly early, it was in a relatively
favorable location for treatment, and she was treated by the best
oncologists immediately and aggressively.  Still, the treatments gave
her only a few months more life, and made her feel a little ill.  I've
compiled excerpts from her story here:

Adding my purrs to those here for you and for Annie. I hope you can find
some suitable options for her to be as comfortable as possible.
