1 But, behold, in the last days, or in the days of the Gentiles—yea, behold
all the nations of the Gentiles and also the Jews, both those who shall come
upon this land and those who shall be upon other lands, yea, even upon all
the lands of the earth, behold, they will be drunken with iniquity and all
manner of abominations—

2 And when that day shall come they shall be visited of the Lord of Hosts,
with thunder and with earthquake, and with a great noise, and with storm,
and with tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.

(Book of Mormon | 2 Nephi 27:1 - 2)

The Lord rebuke thee.

19 For the Lord worketh not in secret combinations, neither doth he will
that man should shed blood, but in all things hath forbidden it, from the
beginning of man.

(Book of Mormon | Ether 8:19)

Journal of Wilford Woodruff:

August 19, 1860: At Sunday meeting, President Young followed and expressed
his feelings upon a variety of things. Presidents Young and Kimball, with
O. Pratt, W. Woodruff, J. Taylor, G. A. Smith, E. Snow, F. D. Richards and
G. Q. Cannon of the Twelve, met for prayer when the following conversation
took place. President Young said the people of the United States had sought
our destruction and they had used every exertion to perfect it. They have
worked through the Masonic institution to perfect it. Joseph and Hyrum Smith
were Master Masons and they were put to death by masons or through their
instigation, and he gave the sign of distress and he was shot by masons
while in the act, and there were delegates from the various lodges in the
Union to see that he was put to death. I hope to live to see the day when
I can have power to make them do right. They have got the blood of the
prophets upon their heads and they have got to meet it. When President
Buchanan and the U.S. Government sent Col. Johnston and the U.S. Army
to Utah, it was with the express purpose to destroy the Church and Kingdom
from off the earth, to put to death this people, but the Lord sustained us
and put them to shame and confusion and to His name be the honor and
glory. There are other Masons sent to this territory for the same purpose
to establish a lodge here and try to get an influence with some here to lay
a plan to try to murder me and the leaders of the Church, but they will not
accomplish it. Now Brother L. N. Scovill thinks so much of masonry that he
might join in with them. G. A. Smith said he does not wish to mix hair and
wool, but he would like to go to England and obtain five charters for lodges
which would give us a grand lodge which would make us independent of all
other Grand Lodges in the world. This is what Brother Scovill would like to
do and this could be done, but I do not think he would be willing to mingle
with our enemies to the injury of this people. President Young said I have
no doubt but that thing could be done and we could take our young men
into the lodge, but then I would ask what good could it do? What good
could result from it? I think no good at all. The truth is we have got to
look to the Lord God of Israel to sustain us, and not to any institution
or kingdom or people upon the earth except the kingdom of God, and
I ask no odds of any man or set of men beneath the heavens except
the Lord and His saints.

Yea, now (at 12:40 am) the Spirit of the Lord beareth me a testimony of this
passage from the Book of Daniel, O ye children of men wandering in darkness:

19 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from
all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth [were of] iron, and his
nails [of] brass; [which] devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue
with his feet;

20 And of the ten horns that [were] in his head, and [of] the other which
came up, and before whom three fell; even [of] that horn that had eyes, and
a mouth that spake very great things, whose look [was] more stout than his
fellows.

21 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed
against them;

22 Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of
the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.

23 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth,
which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth,
and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.

24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom [are] ten kings [that] shall arise:
and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first,
and he shall subdue three kings.

25 And he shall speak [great] words against the most High, and shall wear
out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and
they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of
time.

26 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to
consume and to destroy [it] unto the end.

27 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the
whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High,
whose kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and
obey him.

28 Hitherto [is] the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations
much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in
my heart.

(Old Testament | Daniel 7:19 - 28, King James Bible)

Sir Francis 'shakespeare' Bacon (New Atlantis):

And because propagation of families proceedeth from the nuptial
copulation, I desired to know of him what laws and customs they had
concerning marriage, and whether they kept marriage well, and whether they
were tied to one wife? For that where population is so much affected, and
such as with them it seemed to be, there is commonly permission of plurality
of wives.

To this he said: "... You shall understand that there is not under the
heavens so chaste a nation as this of Bensalem, nor so free from all
pollution or foulness. It is the virgin of the world.

"I have not read of any such chastity in any people as theirs. And their
usual saying is, that whosoever is unchaste cannot reverence himself; and
they say that the reverence of a man's self, is, next religion, the chiefest
bridle of all vices."

And when he had said this the good Jew paused a little; ... he bowed his
head, and went on this manner.

"They have also many wise and excellent laws touching marriage. They allow
no polygamy. ...

20 And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths and
combinations, for it hath been made known unto me that they are had among
all people, and they are had among the Lamanites.

21 And they have caused the destruction of this people of whom I am now
speaking, and also the destruction of the people of Nephi.

22 And whatsoever nation shall uphold such secret combinations, to get power
and gain, until they shall spread over the nation, behold, they shall be
destroyed; for the Lord will not suffer that the blood of his saints, which
shall be shed by them, shall always cry unto him from the ground for
vengeance upon them and yet he avenge them not.

23 Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God that these things should be
shown unto you, that thereby ye may repent of your sins, and suffer not that
these murderous combinations shall get above you, which are built up to get
power and gain-and the work, yea, even the work of destruction come upon
you, yea, even the sword of the justice of the Eternal God shall fall upon
you, to your overthrow and destruction if ye shall suffer these things to
be.

24 Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things come
among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation, because of
this secret combination which shall be among you; or wo be unto it, because
of the blood of them who have been slain; for they cry from the dust for
vengeance upon it, and also upon those who built it up.

25 For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up seeketh to overthrow the
freedom of all lands, nations, and countries; and it bringeth to pass the
destruction of all people, for it is built up by the devil, who is the
father of all lies; even that same liar who beguiled our first parents, yea,
even that same liar who hath caused man to commit murder from the beginning;
who hath hardened the hearts of men that they have murdered the prophets,
and stoned them, and cast them out from the beginning.

26 Wherefore, I, Moroni, am commanded to write these things that evil may be
done away, and that the time may come that Satan may have no power upon the
hearts of the children of men, but that they may be persuaded to do good
continually, that they may come unto the fountain of all righteousness and
be saved.

(Book of Mormon | Ether 8:20 - 26)

24 And the angel of the Lord said unto me: Thou hast beheld that the book
proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew; and when it proceeded forth from
the mouth of a Jew it contained the fulness of the gospel of the Lord, of
whom the twelve apostles bear record; and they bear record according to the
truth which is in the Lamb of God.

25 Wherefore, these things go forth from the Jews in purity unto the
Gentiles, according to the truth which is in God.

26 And after they go forth by the hand of the twelve apostles of the Lamb,
from the Jews unto the Gentiles, thou seest the formation of that great and
abominable church, which is most abominable above all other churches; for
behold, they have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which
are plain and most precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they
taken away.

27 And all this have they done that they might pervert the right ways of the
Lord, that they might blind the eyes and harden the hearts of the children
of men.

28 Wherefore, thou seest that after the book hath gone forth through the
hands of the great and abominable church, that there are many plain and
precious things taken away from the book, which is the book of the Lamb of
God.

29 And after these plain and precious things were taken away it goeth forth
unto all the nations of the Gentiles; and after it goeth forth unto all the
nations of the Gentiles, yea, even across the many waters which thou hast
seen with the Gentiles which have gone forth out of captivity, thou
seest-because of the many plain and precious things which have been taken
out of the book, which were plain unto the understanding of the children of
men, according to the plainness which is in the Lamb of God-because of these
things which are taken away out of the gospel of the Lamb, an exceedingly
great many do stumble, yea, insomuch that Satan hath great power over them.

The Jesuit Order
The Society of Jesus (Jesuits)

The complete Oath of Extreme Induction

Library of Congress, Washington D.C., Library of Congress Catalog Card
#66-43354, made public in 1883. This oath is still in effect, and is still
used today.

----------------------------------------------------

The Jesuit order, otherwise known as the Society of Jesus (S.J.), has been
the military enforcement arm of the Catholic Church since it was first
founded by Ignatius of Loyola of Spain in 1534 during the reign of Pope Paul
III, ostensibly to combat Protestant heresy. And while many feel that the
Jesuits are only a sub-order of the Roman Catholic Church and are merely
seekers and disseminators of knowledge, they have a much darker history that
many people do not know about.

And while much can be said of the Jesuit Order, and much has been written,
the oath speaks not only for itself, but speaks much of the Roman Catholic
Church that has used and still uses the Jesuits for it's purposes while
knowing full well the contents of the oath they bind themselves under. The
Roman Catholic Church, while professing to holiness and claiming that there
is no salvation outside of the Church, still harbors the Jesuit Order and
commands them explicitly.

Below is the complete Oath of Extreme Induction taken by each Jesuit Priest
upon his induction into the command ranks of the Jesuit Order, found in the
Library of Congress, Washington D.C., Library of Congress Catalog Card
#66-43354, made public in 1883. This oath is still in effect, and is still
used today.

On an interesting note, we often see the letters INRI on crosses and
crucifixes, and are told that it represents the Latin words "Iesus Nazarenus
Rex Iudeum" or "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews", the Latin words that
Pilate had written on a placard and nailed above Jesus' head at the
crucifixion. However, as you will see below, the Jesuits use a far different
set of words with the same letters. This invites the question, "Which is the
real meaning of the 'I.N.R.I.' that we see displayed today?"

----------------------------------------------------

INDUCTION AND EXTREME OATH OF THE JESUITS

When a Jesuit novice is about to be inducted into the higher levels of the
Order, he kneels on a red cross before the Superior of the Order. Before him
are two flags, the familiar yellow and white flag of the papacy, and the
black flag with a dagger and red cross above a skull and crossbones, the
flag of the Jesuit Order. On the Jesuit flag is written the words, IUSTUM,
NECAR, REGES, IMPIOS. (It is just to exterminate or annihilate impious or
heretical kings, governments, or rulers.) The Superior of the Order hands
the novice a small black crucifix which he presses to his heart, and the
Superior then presents to the novice a dagger. The novice grasps the bare
blade and presses the point to his heart. The Superior, still holding the
hilt of the dagger then speaks to the novice.

Superior:
My son, heretofore you have been taught to act the dissembler: among Roman
Catholics to be a Roman Catholic, and to spy even among your own brethren;
to believe no man, to trust no man. Among the Reformers, to be a Reformer;
among the Huguenots, to be a Huguenot; among the Calvinists, to be a
Calvinist; among the Protestants, generally to be a Protestant; and
obtaining their confidence to seek even to preach from their pulpits and to
denounce with all the vehemence in your nature our Holy Religion and the
Pope; and to descend so low as to become a Jew among the Jews, that you
might be enabled to gather together all information for your Order as a
faithful soldier of the Pope.

You have been taught to insidiously plant the seeds of jealousy and hatred
between communities, provinces and states that were at peace, and incite
them to deeds of blood, involving them in war with each other, and to create
revolutions and civil wars in countries that were independent and
prosperous, cultivating the arts and sciences and enjoying the blessings of
peace. To take sides with the combatants and to act secretly in concert with
your brother Jesuit, who may be engaged on the other side, but openly
opposed to that with which you might be connected; only that the Church
might be the gainer in the end, in the conditions fixed in the treaties for
peace and that the end justifies the means.

You have been taught your duty as a spy, to gather all statistics, facts and
information in your power from every source; to ingratiate yourself into the
confidence of the family circle of Protestants and heretics of every class
and character, as well as that of the merchant, the banker, the lawyer,
among the schools and universities, in parliaments and legislatures, and in
the judiciaries councils of state, and to "be all things to all men," for
the Pope's sake, whose servants we are unto death.

You have received all your instructions heretofore as a novice, a neophyte,
and have served as a coadjutor, confessor and priest, but you have not been
invested with all that is necessary to command in the Army of Loyola in the
service of the Pope. You must serve the proper time as the instrument and
executioner as directed by your superiors; for none can command here who has
not consecrated his labors with the blood of the heretic; for "without the
shedding of blood no man can be saved." Therefore, to fit yourself for your
work, and make your own salvation sure, you will, in addition to your former
oath of obedience to your Order and your allegiance to the Pope, repeat
after me.

I, M---------- N----------, Now, in the presence of Almighty God, the
Blessed Virgin Mary, the blessed Michael the Archangel, the blessed St. John
the Baptist, the holy Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul and all the saints and
the sacred hosts of heaven, and to you, my ghostly father, the Superior
general of the Society of Jesus, founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola, in the
Pontificate of Paul the Third, and continued to the present, do by the womb
of the Virgin, the matrix of God, and the rod of Jesus Christ, declare and
swear, that his holiness the Pope is Christ's Viceregent and is the true and
only Head of the Catholic or Universal Church throughout the earth; and that
by virtue of the keys of binding and loosing, given to his Holiness by my
Saviour, Jesus Christ, he hath power to depose heretical kings, princes,
states, commonwealths and governments, all being illegal without his sacred
confirmation and that they may safely be destroyed.

Therefore, to the utmost of my power, I shall and will defend this doctrine
and his Holiness' right and custom against all usurpers of the heretical or
Protestant authority, and all adherents in the regard that they be usurped
and heretical, opposing the sacred Mother Church of Rome.

I do now renounce and disown any allegiance as due to any heretical king,
prince or state named Protestants or Liberals or obedience to any of their
laws, magistrates or officers. I do further declare that the doctrines of
the churches of England and Scotland, of the Calvinists, Huguenots and
others of the name Protestants or Liberals to be damnable, and they
themselves damned and to be damned who will not forsake the same.

I do further declare that I will help, assist and advise all or any of his
Holiness' agents in any place wherever I shall be, in any other kingdom or
territory I shall come to, and do my uttermost to extirpate the heretical
Protestants or Liberals' doctrines and to destroy all their
pretended powers, regal or otherwise.

I do further promise and declare, that notwithstanding I am dispensed with,
to assume any religion heretical, for the propagating of the Mother Church's
interest, to keep secret and private all her agents counsels' from time to
time, as they may entrust me, and not to divulge, directly or indirectly, by
word, writing or circumstance whatever; but to execute all that shall be
proposed, given in charge or discovered unto me, by you, my ghostly father,
or any of this sacred convent.

I do further promise and declare, that I will have no opinion or will of my
own, or any mental reservation whatever, even as a corpse or cadaver,
(perinde ac cadaver,) but will unhesitatingly obey each and every command
that I may receive from my superiors in the Militia of the Pope and Jesus
Christ. That I will go to any part of the world whithersoever I may be sent,
without murmuring or repining, and will be submissive in all things
commanded to me.

I furthermore promise and declare that I will, when opportunity presents,
make and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics,
Protestants and Liberals, as I am directed to do, to extirpate and
exterminate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare
neither age, nor sex or condition; and that I will hang, burn, waste, spoil,
flay, strangle, and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs
and wombs of their women and crush their infants' heads against the walls,
in order to annihilate forever their execrable race.

That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned
cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poinard or the leaden bullet,
regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or
persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private,
as I at any time may be directed to do so by any agent of the Pope or
Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus.

In confirmation of which, I hereby dedicate my life, soul, and all of my
corporeal powers, and with this dagger which I now receive, I will subscribe
my name written in my own blood, in testimony thereof; and should I prove
false or weaken in my determination, may my brethren and fellow soldiers of
the Militia of the Pope cut off my hands and feet, and my throat from ear to
ear, my belly opened and sulphur burned therein, with all the punishment
that can be inflicted upon me on earth, and my soul to be tortured by demons
in an eternal hell forever.

All of which I, M------ N------, do swear by the blessed Trinity and blessed
Sacrament, which I am about to receive, to perform and on my part to receive
inviolably; and do call all of the heavenly and glorious host of heaven to
witness these my real intentions to keep this my oath.

In testimony hereof I take this most holy and blessed sacrament of the
Eucharist, and witness the same further, with my name written with the point
of this dagger dipped in my own blood and sealed in the face of this holy
convent.

Superior:
You will now rise to your feet and I will instruct you in the Catechism
necessary to make yourself known to any member of the Society of Jesus
belonging to this rank.

In the first place, you, as a Brother Jesuit, will with another make the
ordinary sign of the cross as any Roman Catholic would; then one crosses his

wrists, the palms of his hands open, the other crosses his feet, one above
the other; the first points with forefinger of the right hand to the center
of the palm of the left, the other with the forefinger of the left hand
points to the center of the palm of the right; the first then with his right
hand makes a circle around his head, touching it; the other then with the
forefinger of his left hand touches the left side of his body just below his
heart; then the first with his right hand draws it across the throat of the
other, and the latter then with his right hand makes the motion of cutting
with a dagger down the stomach and abdomen of the first.

The first then says Iustum; the other answers Necar; the first then says
Reges. The other answers Impios. The first will then present a small piece
of paper folded in a peculiar manner, four times, which the other will cut
longitudinally and on opening the name JESU will be found written upon the
head and arms of a cross three times. You will then give and receive with
him the following questions and answers.

Q: From where do you come?
A: From the bends of the Jordan, from Calvary, from the Holy Sepulchre, and
lastly from Rome.

Q: Whom do you serve?
A: The Holy Father at Rome, the Pope, and the Roman Catholic Church
Universal throughout the world.

Q: Who commands you?
A: The successor of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of
Jesus or the Soldiers of Jesus Christ.

Q: Who received you?
A: A venerable man with white hair.

Q: How?
A: With a naked dagger, I kneeling on a cross beneath the banners of the
Pope and of our sacred Order.

Q: Did you take an oath?
A: I did, to destroy heretics and their governments and rulers, and to spare
neither age, sex or condition. To be as a corpse without any opinion or will
of my own, but to implicitly obey my superiors in all things without
hesitation or murmuring.

Q: Will you do that?
A: I will.

Q: How do you travel?
A: In the bark of Peter the fisherman.

Q: Whither do you travel?
A: To the four quarters of the globe.

Q: For what purpose?
A: To obey the orders of my General and Superiors and execute the will of
the Pope and faithfully fulfill the conditions of my oath.

Go ye, then, into all the world and take possession of all lands in the name
of the Pope. He who will not accept him as the Vicar of Jesus and his
Viceregent on earth, let him be accursed and exterminated.

[Finis]

"I defy the Pope and all his laws. If God spare my life, ere many years I
will cause a boy that driveth the plough shall know more of the Scripture
than thou dost."  William Tyndale (b. 1494?, martyred 1536 A.D.), debating
with a learned clergyman. (from The Arts and Monuments by John Foxe, or
Foxe's Book of Martyrs)

William Tyndale was a real saint of Jesus Christ. On the other hand, Mel
Gibson knowingly crucified the Lord of glory, on film, afresh to himself and
his fellows. He recruited porn stars to play leading female roles in his
blockbuster film, Passion of the Christ. He made a lot of money in the
accomplishment of his blasphemous deed. He is yet another devil in disguise,
regardless of whether he is a Jesuit or not, for by their fruits ye shall
know them.

1534 Translation by William Tyndale of 1 Corinthians 9:3-5
"Mine answer to them that ask me, is this. Have we not power to eat and to
drink? Have we not power to lead about a sister to wife as well as other
apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?"

1534 Translation by William Tyndale of 1 Timothy 2:11-12,15
"Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. I suffer not a woman to
teach, neither to have authority over a man: but for to be in silence. ...
through bearing of children they shall be saved, so they continue in faith,
love and holiness with discretion."

And who hath empowered the children of Canaan?
The great transgressor is the princes of the latter-day Danaans,
Disguised with the visage and the garb of a Saxon gentleman,
So the natural eye seeth no difference between Ephraim and Dan.

Be not deceived, ye children of Benjamin and Levi and Judah.
Err not as the children of Ephraim at ease in Utah.
Sowing discord among the races in this sinful kingdom
Is the Puppeteer's aim, through his co-heir the dukes of Edom.

In Liverpool, memory of slavery revived

By ROBERT BARR, Associated Press Writer

Sat Mar 17, 1:27 PM ET

LIVERPOOL, England - Beatles lovers who seek out Penny Lane imagine it as
that magical place "in my ears and in my eyes, there beneath the blue
suburban skies." But it has a sinister undertone that still reverberates.

The street in Liverpool, home town of the Fab Four, is named after James
Penny, a slave trader and investor in 11 voyages that took 500 to 600
captives at a time to the New World.

Penny was among the many who enriched themselves and their city on human
trafficking until the slave trade was abolished 200 years ago. Their ships
carried millions of human beings from West Africa to the plantations of the
Americas in a triangular trade that also brought profitable cargoes of
sugar, tobacco and rum to England.

Liverpool's rise, says local historian Ray Costello, is summed up in the
carving on a bank facade: two black children supporting a figure of the
Roman god Neptune, representing Liverpool.

"What it really means is that this bank was founded on the slave trade,"
Costello said.

It resonates all the more with the approach of the March 25 anniversary of
the British parliamentary act that abolished the slave trade in Britain's
colonies 200 years ago - though not slavery itself.

Liverpool's problem is its "hidden history - nobody wants to talk about it,"
said Eric Lynch, a black Liverpudlian who leads walking tours in the west
coast city.

However, the past has not gone unacknowledged.

The city council formally apologized in 1999, expressing "shame and remorse
for the city's role in this trade in human misery."

It has commissioned statues titled "Reconciliation," two abstract bronze
figures embracing, which will be dedicated this year in Richmond, Va., and
Benin, a West African port of call for Liverpool's slave ships.

On Aug. 23, the anniversary of the slave uprising in French-ruled Haiti in
1791, Liverpool will open the International Slavery Museum. Part of its
mission is recovering Liverpool's history, which remains a fraught issue.

Lynch, the tour guide, finds the echoes in the streets named for slave
traders - Bamber, Banastre, Cunliffe, Gascoyne, Oldham, Seel, Tarleton; in a
balcony railing made of chains by one of the businesses which depended on
the trade; in the face of an African woman in the frieze around the ornate
Town Hall.

Liverpool council member Barbara Mace last year proposed renaming streets
associated with slavery, and was surprised to learn that Penny Lane was
among them. After a lively controversy the proposal was withdrawn.

Liverpool was once the home of John Newton, the slave ship captain who
became an ardent abolitionist and wrote the hymn "Amazing Grace."

The abolitionist Thomas Clarkson visited Liverpool in 1787, collecting
horrifying stories from sailors and buying tools of the trade: chains,
manacles, iron collars and branding irons which made effective publicity for
William Wilberforce's 20-year campaign in Parliament to abolish the trade.

"By the end of the 19th century, a lot of rich families were trying to
sanitize their wealth, and every trace of slavery they got rid of," said
Costello, who has been researching the history of fellow blacks in his city
for nearly half a century.

What Liverpool needs to do, Costello says, is "take off its shades and see
the blacks," who have been in the city since the 18th century but still find
themselves mistaken for recent immigrants.

Blacks now represent 7 percent of the work force in the city of 450,000.

Because the slaves sailed direct from Africa to the New World, Liverpool saw
little of the trade at close quarters.

Richard Benjamin, director of the new museum, said that only 11 slaves are
known to have been sold in the city. Some slaves who were given their
freedom for fighting against the American Revolution made their way to
Liverpool, while others came as crewmen on ships, Costello said.

The abolition act in 1807 was a milestone, but Britain waited another 26
years to outlaw slavery in the colonies; the United States followed in 1865
and Brazil in 1888.

Anti-Slavery International, founded by the leaders of Britain's abolition
movement, estimates that 12 million people are in some form of slavery
today, as bonded laborers or in the sex trade.

Slavery is now illegal everywhere, said Beth Herzfeld of Anti-Slavery
International, but "laws today are not being implemented."

"We have to not just reflect on the reality and horrors of the slave trade
but to see that people power had a very important role in overthrowing the
trade, and that people today still have a role to play," she said.

Liverpool joined the slave trade in 1699 when a ship named Liverpool
Merchant put to sea, carrying 220 slaves from West Africa to Barbados. Sir
Thomas Johnson, a part-owner of the ship, is known as the founder of modern
Liverpool; Sir Thomas Street is named for him.

By 1750, Liverpool had surpassed London and Bristol as a slave-trading port;
45 years later it controlled 80 percent of the British slave trade,
representing two-fifths of the European total. In the peak year of 1798, 149
ships set off from Liverpool for Africa, officially with the capacity to
carry 53,000 slaves.

By one accounting, Liverpool's traders transported 1,364,930 Africans in
5,249 voyages between 1699 and 1807.

Africans, often the captives of local chiefs, were paid for with cloth,
kitchen pots and pans, muskets, gunpowder, flints, hats, mirrors, candles,
beads and brandy.

A page displayed at the trans-Atlantic Slavery Gallery at the Maritime
Museum in Liverpool details the profits of the voyage of the Enterprize in
1794. The ship sold 356 slaves and cleared a profit of 10,000 pounds -
equivalent to about $2 million today.

It was a brutal trade, killing untold numbers of Africans in slave raids, by
disease, shipwreck and mistreatment. Women captives were raped. Ship crews
suffered heavy death rates from disease.

Alexander Falconbridge, a Bristol ship captain who became an abolitionist,
said slaves on some ships were forced to lie on each other in crowded holds
during a voyage of at least six weeks. Writing in 1788, he said, "the floor
of their rooms was so covered with blood and mucus ... that it resembled a
slaughterhouse. It is not in the power of the human imagination to picture
to itself a situation more dreadful and disgusting."

Some denied it. Robert Norris, a former slave ship captain who was one of
Liverpool's lobbyists in Parliament, claimed that after dinner the slaves
aboard ship were given pipes, tobacco and musical instruments, "and when
tired of music and dancing, they then go to games of chance."

Penny, another Liverpool lobbyist, told legislators that slaves slept aboard
their ships "better than the gentlemen do on shore."

One of the worst atrocities was aboard the Liverpool slave ship Zong, which
was wracked with disease; Capt. Luke Collingwood ordered the crew to throw
133 sick slaves overboard, then tried to claim against insurance for "loss
of merchandise."

The abolitionist Granville Sharp demanded a murder prosecution, but the
government's attorney responded: "It is madness; the blacks were property."

The Zong incident was one among many that fired the zeal of abolitionists -
a mass movement built on networks of Quakers, with Sharp, Wilberforce and
Clarkson in prominent leadership roles.

Josiah Wedgwood, the pottery pioneer, made an engraving of a kneeling slave
in chains with the words "am I not a man and a brother?" Reproduced in the
thousands on medallions, hat pins and brooches, it was worn by fashionable
supporters of the cause.

In retrospect, the attitudes of some abolitionists now appear puzzling.
Newton made two slave voyages even after being converted by the "amazing
grace ... that saved a wretch like me."

"During the time I was engaged in the slave trade, I never had the least
scruple as to its lawfulness. I was, upon the whole, satisfied with it, as
the appointment Providence had marked out for me," Newton wrote.

However, he added, "I was sometimes shocked with an employment that was
perpetually conversant with chains, bolts, and shackles."

Journal of Discourses, Vol.2, Pg.184, Brigham Young, February 18, 1855:

The seed of Ham, which is the seed of Cain descending through Ham, will,
according to the curse put upon him, serve his brethren, and be a "servant
of servants" to his fellow-creatures, until God removes the curse; and no
power can hinder it.  These are my views upon slavery.  I will here say a
little more upon this point.  The conduct of the whites towards the slaves
will, in many cases, send both slave and master to hell.  This statement
comprises much in a few words.  The blacks should be used like servants, and
not like brutes, but they must serve.  It is their privilege to live so as
to enjoy many of the blessings which attend obedience to the first
principles of the Gospel, though they are not entitled to the Priesthood.

Brigham Young Addresses, Ms D 1234, Box 48, Folder 3, dated Feb. 5, 1852,
located in the LDS Historical Dept, Salt Lake City:

Speach by Gov. Young in Joint Session of the Legeslature.
Feby. 5th 1852 giving his veiws on slavery.

... In the kingdom of God on the earth the Affricans cannot hold
one partical of power in Government. ... inasmuch as it is the Lords
will they should receive the spirit of God by Baptisam; and that is the end
of their privilege; and there is not power on earth to give them any more
power. ... Again to the subject before us; as to The men bearing rule; not
one of the children of old Cain, have one partical of right to bear Rule in
Government affairs from first to last, they have no buisness there. this
privilege was taken from them by there own transgressions, and I cannot help
it; and should you or I bear rule we ought to do it with dignity and honour
before God. I am as much oposed to the principle of slavery as any man in
the present acceptation or usage of the term, it is abused. I am opposed to
abuseing that which God has decreed, to take, a blessing, and make a curse
of it. It is a great blessing to the seed of Adam to have the seed of Cain
for servants, but those they serve should use them with all the heart and
feeling, as they would use their own children, and their compassion should
reach over them, and round about them, and treat them as kindly, and with
that humane feeling necessary to be shown to mortall beings of the human
species. ... Let this Church which is called the kingdom of God on the
earth; we will sommons the first presidency, the twelve, the high counsel,
the Bishoprick, and all the elders of Isreal, suppose we summons them
to apear here, and here declare that it is right to mingle our seed, with
the black race of Cain, that they shall come in with with us and be
pertakers with us of all the blessings God has given to us. On that very
day, and hour we should do so, the preisthood is taken from this Church
and kingdom and God leaves us to our fate. The moment we consent to
mingle with the seed of Cain the Church must go to desstruction, -- we
should receive the curse which has been placed upon the seed of Cain,
and never more be numbered with the children of Adam who are heirs to
the priesthood untill that curse be removed. Therefore I will not consent
for one moment to have an african dictate me or any Bren. with regard to
Church or State Government. I may vary in my veiwes from others, and
they may think I am foolish in the things I have spoken, and think that they
know more than I do, but I know I know more than they do. If the Affricans
cannot bear rule in the Church of God, what buisness have they to bear rule
in the State and Government affairs of this Territory or any others? ...
I say I will not consent for one moment for you to lay a plan to bring
a curse upon this people. I [It] shall not be while I am here.

7 [Are] ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel?
saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and
the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?

8 Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD [are] upon the sinful kingdom, and I will
destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly
destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.

9 For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all
nations, like as [corn] is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain
fall upon the earth.

10 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil
shall not overtake nor prevent us.

11 ¶ In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and
close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will
build it as in the days of old:

12 That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which
are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.

(Old Testament | Amos 9:7 - 12, King James Bible)

15 We looked for peace, but no good [came; and] for a time of health, and
behold trouble!

16 The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at
the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have
devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell
therein.

17 For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which [will]
not [be] charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.

(Old Testament | Jeremiah 8:15 - 17, King James Bible)

1534 Translation by William Tyndale of Revelation 13:3-10,13,15-18
"And all the world wondered at the beast, and they worshipped the dragon
which gave power unto the beast, and they worshipped the beast saying: who
is like unto the beast? who is able to war with him? And there was a mouth
given unto him that spake great things and blasphemies, and power was given
unto him, to do forty-two months. And he opened his mouth unto blasphemy
against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle and them that dwell
in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to
overcome them. And power was given him over all kindred, tongue, and nation:
and all that dwell upon the earth worshipped him: whose names are not
written in the book of life of the lamb, which was killed from the beginning
of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into
captivity, shall go into captivity: he that killeth with a sword, must be
killed with a sword. Here is the patience, and the faith of the saints. ...
And he did great wonders, so that he made fire come down from heaven in the
sight of men. ... And he had power to give a spirit unto the image of the
beast, and that the image of the beast should speak, and should cause that
as many as would not worship the image of the beast, should be killed. And
he made all both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a
mark in their right hands, or in their foreheads. And that no man might buy
or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number
of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath wit count the number of the
beast. For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred, three
score and six."

1534 Translation by William Tyndale of Revelation 14:9-12
"And the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice: If any man
worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or on
his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is
poured in the cup of his wrath. And he shall be punished in fire and
brimstone, before the holy angels, and before the lamb. And the smoke of
their torment ascendeth up  evermore. And they have no rest day nor night,
which worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the print of
his name. Here is the patience of saints. Here are they that keep the
commandments and the faith of Jesus."

1534 Translation by William Tyndale of Revelation 18:11-13
"And the merchants of the earth shall weep and wail in themselves, for no
man will buy their ware any more, the ware of gold, and silver, and precious
stones, ... and chariots, and bodies and souls of men."

13 Come unto me, O ye Gentiles, and I will show unto you the greater things,
the knowledge which is hid up because of unbelief.

14 Come unto me, O ye house of Israel, and it shall be made manifest unto
you how great things the Father hath laid up for you, from the foundation of
the world; and it hath not come unto you, because of unbelief.

15 Behold, when ye shall rend that veil of unbelief which doth cause you to
remain in your awful state of wickedness, and hardness of heart, and
blindness of mind, then shall the great and marvelous things which have been
hid up from the foundation of the world from you—yea, when ye shall call
upon the Father in my name, with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, then
shall ye know that the Father hath remembered the covenant which he made
unto your fathers, O house of Israel.

16 And then shall my revelations which I have caused to be written by my
servant John be unfolded in the eyes of all the people. Remember, when ye
see these things, ye shall know that the time is at hand that they shall be
made manifest in very deed.

17 Therefore, when ye shall receive this record ye may know that the work of
the Father has commenced upon all the face of the land.

18 Therefore, repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and believe
in my gospel, and be baptized in my name; for he that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned; and
signs shall follow them that believe in my name.

(Book of Mormon | Ether 4:13 - 18)

4 Behold, wisdom shall increase in the latter time. And men shall make
weapons of war; yea, even terrible weapons which shall touch the power of
the Most High.

5 And the seed of Joseph shall believe a lie, wherein the terrible weapons
shall be for the protection of their lands. And wo unto them, for the people
shall be deceived.

6 And the Lord showed Jacob a vision, and said: behold, the mighty men of
the earth shall lay an awful scheme by the word of their god, that they
should destroy the Lord when he shall visit men at the appointed time when
he shall reward the sons of men according to their works.

7 And all nations shall gather together in the heart of the earth to make
war with the Lord, even the almighty king of heaven and earth. Wo, wo, wo
unto the chief princes of the earth, even unto the seed of Dan, who hath
made gold their god and a lie their refuge:

8 Who have said among themselves: the Lord is no god wherein we should
fear him, for by our mighty power have we become gods ourselves and have
spread abroad ourselves over all the earth. Yet shall they be judged and cut
off from among the sons of Jacob.

Book of Joseph 3:4-8 (given through Joseph Smith the Seer)

12 ¶ Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I
declare [that] I will render double unto thee;

13 When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up
thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of
a mighty man.

(Old Testament | Zechariah 9:12 - 13, King James Bible)

18 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame,
and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour
them; and there shall not be [any] remaining of the house of Esau; for the
LORD hath spoken [it].

(Old Testament | Obadiah 1:18, King James Bible)

Joseph Smith (Journal of Mosiah Hancock):

There will be two great political parties in this country. One will be
called the Republican, and the other the Democrat party. These two parties
will go to war and out of these two parties will spring another party which
will be the Independent American Party. The United States will spend her
strength and means warring in foreign lands until other nations will say,
"Let's divide up the lands of the United States," then the people of the
U.S. will unite and swear by the blood of their fore-fathers, that the land
shall not be divided. Then the country will go to war, and they will fight
until one half of the U.S. army will give up, and the rest will continue to
struggle. They will keep on until they are very ragged and discouraged,
and almost ready to give up--when the boys from the mountains will rush
forth in time to save the American Army from defeat and ruin. And they will
say, "Brethren, we are glad you have come; give us men, henceforth, who
can talk with God." Then you will have friends, but you will save the
country when its liberty hangs by a hair, as it were.

1 Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on
high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people
from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.

2 For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to
escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not
hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.

3 And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; for their iniquities
shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed.

4 And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my
disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.

5 And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have
commanded them.

6 Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and my
preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given them to publish
unto you, O inhabitants of the earth.

7 Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what I the Lord have decreed
in them shall be fulfilled.

34 And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of the earth: I the Lord
am willing to make these things known unto all flesh;

35 For I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know that
the day speedily cometh; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when
peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his
own dominion.

36 And also the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in
their midst, and shall come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world.

37 Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the
prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled.

38 What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and
though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but
shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my
servants, it is the same.

39 For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, and
the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen.

(Doctrine and Covenants | Section 1:1 - 7,34 - 39, received by Joseph Smith)
