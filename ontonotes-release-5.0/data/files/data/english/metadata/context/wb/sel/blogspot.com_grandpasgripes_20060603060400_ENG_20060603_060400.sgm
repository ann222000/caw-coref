The DaVinci Code was a best selling book and it became a popular
movie. There are many views on that Code.

Neither the book nor the movie say that Jesus faked his crucifiction.
The book makes a point that Mary Magdalene was one of the first
witnesses to his resurection. The book talks about the defamaory
statement made by a Pope that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute. It denies
this . It says that she was of Royal Blood as was Jesus and their union
would have been the union of two Royal families. I had read somewhere
that she was not a prostitute. So that was not something I first learned
from the Book. Although one television critic got that wrong.

But there were things in the book that simply weren't mentioned in
the movie. The first thing is that, in the book, Sophie fell out with
her grandfather after she saw him having sexual intercourse. The movie
simply says that he did something which she considered awful. Maybe that
was a gesture toward ratings. But other things were not. The second
thing mentioned in the book but not the movie is that, at the end of the
book Sophie met her brother. In the third, the book makes a point that
when Mary Magdalene fled, a Jewish community in France was one of her
greatest supporters. This was simply not mentioned in the movie.

It was banned in two Nation States. Maybe the authorities in those
States realised that in banning the movie, they gave it great publicity.
Also some Bishops forbade Catholics to see it perhaps not realising that
their actions gave it great publicity.

Analyses of the book are all critical. Some say it was poorly
written. I am not a literary critic. But I didn't find it so. I enjoyed
the book. Also, the historians on whose research the book was based are
called poor historians. I suppose if you are trying to discredit
something, that is a good way of doing it. Most people dismiss the book
as a thriller. But there are things which the author claims are facts,
like the existence of the priory of sion.

I saw a television analysis of the book. I believe that the author
gave his position away at the end when he said "there are some things we
want to believe but we know in our heart are not true." To my way of
thinking that discredited his whole argument although, there is one
thing that may be correct, It says that in the gnostic gospel of Mary
Magdalene, her status as the wife of Jesus is not mentioned. I know that
she didn't write her own gospel. But one would think that was important
enough to mention.

As someone who was brought up a Jew, the marriage of Jesus was not
something that preoccupied me in my upgringing although I was brought up
by two aethiests. The book wants to portray Jesus as a human being.
Whereas, under Christianity, Jesus is viewed as the son of God and God
himself in the trinity. Jews would say that if Jesus existed, he was
human and a great Rabbi. The book seems to support his humanity. Also
the book speaks about Jewish support for Mary Magdalene. We all know
that Jesus was a Jew. Christianity did not get started until Paul,
called Saul by many Jews, started preaching to the heathen.
