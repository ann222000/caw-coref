Inspired by this recent passage over at John Hawks' weblog:

&quot;We can imagine an alternative history in which [Darwin's] insights
were rapidly developed into a demographic model of selection.
Mathematical models of demography were not only available at the time
Darwin and Wallace wrote, they were the advancing frontier of social
science. Mathematical descriptions of demography became important in
the 1800's for the same reason they remain important today: actuarial
predictions. In the 1820's, Benjamin Gompertz considered the effects
of changing mortality, while the logistic model had been formulated by
Pierre Verhulst as early as 1838.  Both models presented substantial
refinements of Malthus' conception of geometric growth, including the
very thing Darwin and Wallace most needed: a description of an
equilibrium.  For that matter, Euler developed a true age-structured
model of population growth in 1760!  When we consider that the
demographic model of natural selection is entirely pre-Darwinian, the
possibility of an earlier development of theoretical population
genetics seems quite plausible.

&quot;Such speculations are something like steampunk, that narrow corner of
fiction that supposes Babbage had really built his Difference Engine
No. 2, and imagines what would have happened next.  But there is a
point to it: Nineteenth-century demography was already well-equipped
to incorporate selection.  Doing so may at the least have jump-started
epidemiology, which could have made much of good actuarial records.
Tracking thousands of people was already undertaken by governments.
On the other hand, the development of genetics required somebody to
track thousands of flies, and that wouldn't happen for a while. Still,
a good demographic theory of selection might have been incorporated
into developmental biology, giving Mendelism a run for its money.&quot;

http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/evolution/selection/miracle_of_com...

Okay, so let's imagine some lively young apostle of Darwin,
mathematically talented (which Darwin was not), grabs this idea and
runs with it.  We'll call him *John Falco, 1834 - 1913, a whiz kid who
OTL died young of the croup.

Falco isn't a genius, quite, but he's an energetic polymath who loves
a good scrap.  By happy chance he reads the _Origin_ back to back with
Verhulst in 1860, and in 1862 he publishes a short paper, &quot;The Theory
of Natural Selection As Applied to Demographics&quot;.  The math goes as
far as binomials -- he comes very close to Hardy's Law, albeit in a
roundabout way -- which means that Darwin can hardly make heads or
tails of it; but after a friend explains it slowly, the great man
gives cautious approval.

Now, earlier population biology could lead to various good things.  It
could lead to Mendelian genetics a generation earlier -- people will
be more likely to look at the right things.  Even if it doesn't, once
Mendel or someone like him does come along, there should be an
explosion of mathematical application right away (instead of gradually
over the next 30 years, as IOTL).  OTL, R.A. Fisher developed
quantitative genetics in the late 'teens; here, it should happen at
least a decade earlier.  The &quot;modern synthesis&quot; of natural selection
and genetics should arrive during WWI instead of in the 1930s.
Biology in general will be some years ahead of OTL.

Meanwhile, population studies should arrive early.  I'm not sure the
late 19th century had the statistical tools to do longitudinal studies
-- stuff like the Framingham Heart Study -- but with a demographic
model of selection in the air, they might try.  It seems like the sort
of funky idea that might catch the eye of Kaiser Wilhelm or Teddy
Roosevelt.  And even if they can't analyze the data effectively,
future generations will be able to.  OTL, the world's first
longitudinal study started in 1948, and they didn't really take off
until the '60s.  TTL, we might have biometric data collection going
back around a century.  That might be a significant boost to various
sorts of medicine; it would make things like, for instance, the lung
cancer/smoking correlation even more obvious than iOTL.  Or the link
between hypertension and strokes; OTL that wasn't clear until ~1950,
but it could have been figured out as early as the '20s, had people
been paying the right sort of attention.

Finally, mathematical modeling gets a leg up.  It's no coincidence
that Fisher went straight from population genetics to statistical
analysis.  In this TL, I think it will take a little while to get
there, but there will probably be fruitful diversions into things like
game theory on the way.  And even if Fisherian analysis takes some
time, it will still arrive earlier than IOTL... and that will give
massive payoffs in every branch of science.

So far, so good.  But there may be some negatives.  Eugenics will
probably get a boost.  Hey, it has a basis in real science, with
algebra and everything!  Galton and his friends will grab this with
both hands and run with it.

Meanwhile, I see some furious debates within the field.  Haeckel and
the other developmentalists are going to just hate this.  By the 1870s
there'll be a split between population biologists (who I suspect are
going to be mostly British) and developmentalists (continental).  By
the 1880s our friend *Falco will be the Grand Old Man of a field
that's confusing as hell -- remember, this is population biology
without genetics -- but a magnet for lively minds (and cranks) of
every stripe.  Attempts at synthesis will be stymied by the lack of a
concept of genetics and the tantalizing but confusing state of
contemporary embryology; a great deal of time will be spent trying to
reconcile &quot;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot; with demographic models.

On the plus side, this will be a field supersaturated for stimulation
by Mendelian genetics; come 1902 (if it takes that long), scientists
all around the world will be smacking their faces.

Anyway.  I think it's a net positive, though the eugenics part could
get pretty nasty.

Thoughts?

They didn't have the tools -- Pearson and Fisher were still
developing them, and a headstart on the Hardy-Weinberg law is not
going to help.

There were a lot of biometric studies in the nineteenth century, made
for stupid reasons. (Google Cesare Lombroso.) Conscription records
have been very useful to Komlos and his school of historical
demographics. Et cetera.

While I agree the longitudinal study could have been in principle
realized significantly earlier, it goes against the grain of Fisher's
use of sampling methods. In fact, it's a little weird that the
longitudinal study didn't happen first.

! No, I don't think game theory is on the menu at this time. Looks
simple, requires some types of abstraction which weren't in the
zeitgeist.

Possibly information theory -- Fisher OTL came up with a semi-
useful measure of information/entropy. (Shannon's original paper
was very nearly classified, incidentally. Although _that_ was in
the zeitgeist.)

Um, they did anyway. With math. No real change, I don't think.

Well, without genetics or Mendel's laws, I'd say that British
population biology would be crank-ish. If the continental disease
is Idealist theorizing, the British disease would be &quot;Hey, I/'/m/
T/y/l/e/r/ /C/o/w/e/n/./ I got a hypothesis and a data set. Woo!
it passes the t-test! IT MUST BE TRUE.&quot;

Given the general level of malign cluelessness about human nature
pervasive at that time, and the level of fraud that seems likely
to have taken place, I think you'd see all sorts of crazy
Rassenwissenschaft come out of Britain. &quot;Craniometrics of County
Cork, Ireland.&quot; &quot;A Comparison of the Pushtu, Pathan, and Baluchi
Somatotypes And Their Suitability for Native Police Training.&quot;
&quot;Assimilation and Regression of the Hebraic Physiognomy in Three
Neighborhoods of London.&quot; Et cetera.

Well, as noted earlier, I think the tools might arrive sooner in this
TL.  I mean, there's no reason Fisher's statistical analysis couldn't
have been developed in the 1890s.  And in this TL people will be...
thinking in that direction, more.

I've returned to this more than once.  It's like, nothing nothing
nothing, boom!  The Framingham study begins in 1948.

You can see why Framingham started when it did (and where it did, and
how), but it's hard to see why nobody tried it earlier.  It seems like
an idea the 1930s should have had, not the 1940s.

Cowen is a Brit?  I didn't even know.

I agree that it's likely to be crankish, but we're talking about the
1880s here.  Modern biology is just starting to emerge.

Yah, exactly.

(And remember that John Campbell quote about how the white race was
superior because it expanded its range at the expense of others?  That
idea will have _so much traction_ in this TL.)

I found the post very interesting and would respond, if it weren't for

In OTL Malthus predated Darwin by quite a long
time, and in OTL, Darwin and many of the early
formulators of the idea of natural selection tended
to credit Malthus as being an early originator of
the idea of selection of a (human) population,
which they then later applied to animals, as
a possible way in which species might be
modified over a long period of time.

The basic question is the time frame and the
relative level of detail in the development ot
the analysis of population demographics.

Anything too early, and this is going to
create either a much earlier presention
of Evolution by Natural Selection by Darwin,
or the idea being presented by someone else
earlier as well.

This could potentially butterfly LaMarkism
out of existance and perhaps create a more
seamless transition from some of the
ideas of Buffon and the Encyclopedists on
the subject in the later 1700s, to the views
concerning evolution by Natural Selection
that had developed in the middle to later 1800s.

I would guess that the main question would
concern the exact nature of the PODs, and
the time frames involved.
