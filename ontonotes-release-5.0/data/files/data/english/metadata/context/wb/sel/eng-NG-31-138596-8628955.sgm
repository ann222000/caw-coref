Welcome to Nollywood
Nigeria's rough-and-ready film industry is the world's third largest, behind only India and the US - and with a global audience hungry for more, filmmakers are catching up fast. Novelist Biyi Bandele reports from Lagos

If you want to know what it might feel like to be flung into an involuntary bungee jump, albeit a horizontal one, try a car ride in Lagos. As Michael, my driver, a highly skilled driver and seasoned practitioner of the Lagos variety of the art, negotiates every turning by stepping on the gas, I experience a giddy sense of disembodiment.
Michael seems to regard every other driver sharing the roads with him with a warm, glowing smile, which you might mistake for admiration until you heard the words accompanying it: 'Either he bought it or he printed it himself.'

'What?' I ask Michael as the driver in question disappears in our wake.

'His driving licence, sir, Mr Biyi,' he says, slamming hard on the brakes as a motorbike suddenly leaps out in front us from a side street.

Had Michael brought the car to a halt a second later, the motorcyclist would have felt the combined impact of the car and its occupants slamming into him at 70mph.

It is a sizzling, humid afternoon; the air is pungent with the smell of car fumes. We are driving from Lekki, an affluent ghetto of multimillion-pound houses on reclaimed marshland on the island, to Surulere, a sprawling, dust-laden neighbourhood of ramshackle one-storey buildings and tin shacks on the mainland, home to half a million of the more than 10 million inhabitants of metropolitan Lagos. Nigeria is Africa's leading oil producer, but, according to the UN, more than 50 per cent of the population live below the poverty line.

With its potholed roads teeming with industrious street vendors, feral urchins, and extraordinarily brave commuters - perched calmly on the back seats of the motorbike taxis nicknamed, with morbid irony, 'Okada' after a now defunct airline - Surulere is the birthplace and headquarters of Nollywood, the Nigerian film industry. A far cry from Beverly Hills, Surulere is home to the Nollywood elite - the top producers, directors, marketers, distributors and some of the stars of an industry that has been blazingly successful where successive administrations, guided by the expert and combined wisdom of the IMF and the World Bank, have failed: not only is it a viable industry, it is the second biggest employer in Nigeria.

Although this is hotly contested, Nollywood saw its inauspicious beginnings in Living in Bondage: a tawdry, ineptly shot, earnestly didactic 'home video' that unleashed itself on the world in 1992. Many commentators believe Nollywood was born after the television industry stopped making popular dramas, which were infinitely better than the first several hundred Nollywood films.

Living in Bondage, filmed in Igbo, one of Nigeria's languages, with English subtitles, had just the right mix of all the ingredients of a great soap opera: ropey dialogue, dodgy continuity, wooden acting and the sort of cinematography that went out of fashion when DW Griffith freaked out cinemagoers with the first closeup. Living in Bondage was a morality tale that resonated with many Nigerians, articulating and validating their fondest and darkest suspicions. It proved, for instance, that most of those 'big men' driving about in fancy cars with their trophy girlfriends, living in obscenely big mansions, eating lots of chicken and drinking nothing but foreign wine came into their wealth by drinking their wives' blood - not before killing them in gory sacrifices to the devil, of course. Like Macbeth's haunting by Banquo's ghost, these evil men will always get their comeuppance: they will be driven insane by their wives' apparitions and will find salvation only when they confess their sins to Jesus Christ and ask forgiveness.

Living in Bondage, now considered a classic, was the first Nollywood 'blockbuster'. It sold over 500,000 copies in VHS tapes within weeks of its straight-to-video release. It marked the beginning of an industry that now produces over 1,000 movies a year. The average Nollywood production costs about $15,000, has a one- or two-week shoot and sells between 25,000 and 50,000 copies at about £1.50 a copy. Every so often a 'blockbuster' comes along that sells 500,000 copies. Production values have risen since Living in Bondage, but the single most popular theme is witchcraft and only a brave, or very foolish, director would tell a story where evil wasn't punished and good rewarded. Fans would claim that the films deal with other pressing issues of contemporary African life: religion, family conflict and corruption, albeit routinely sensationalised.

My first point of call in Surulere is the home of one of the most prolific and successful Nollywood directors, Lancelot 'the Governor' Imasuen, whose unbroken record of blockbusters includes such titles as Last Burial, August Meeting, Games Men Play, Games Women Play, Games Men Play 2, and Games Women Play 2.

'I recently had the pleasure of shooting a film in Hollywood,' Imasuen tells me. 'And I told them, &quot;I want you to know that 75 per cent of your budget and timing is wasted! Sixty days to shoot a film!&quot;' He looks shocked, bemused. 'How many working hours are actually in those 60 days? It's all razzmatazz. You see endless trucks and trailers parked on their locations. How much of this equipment is actually used in the process of making films? You see, in Nollywood, what we've done is to do away with all that excess; what we've done is to simplify the process of making films.'

Imasuen, a theatre arts graduate, is shooting from the hip. Behind the braggadocio, though, lurk the aspirations of a filmmaker and a lover of film whose aspirations are embodied in what he had just pooh-poohed. 'I had an experience in America recently,' he says. 'I went to Paramount Studios and was taken on a tour. I almost fainted at the sheer scale of it, the size of the place, the sound stages, the backlots. And I thought, Is this what they're comparing us to? But we'll get there, I promise you. We'll get there.'

In a career spanning 12 years, the 36-year-old director has helmed more than 150 films - an average of one a month. (And there I was thinking Woody Allen was prolific.) But Imasuen is at pains to put his output within its proper context. 'In Nigeria what we do is an offshoot of television. Back in the Eighties, some soap operas were very popular - Cock Crow at Dawn, Mirror in the Sun, The New Masquerade. And when the government's policies relating to the Nigerian Television Authority no longer favoured the production of those soaps, Nollywood was born. Nollywood is a direct offshoot of the television drama. If you ask a television series producer in the UK or US how many episodes he or she produces each year, would you be surprised if they answered hundreds?'

Friendly Fire, the film Imasuen was 'shooting in Hollywood', was a $200,000 independent feature financed by a US-based Nigerian producer. Although set in America, it is quintessential Nollywood. 'My role is that of an adulterous wife. She is not real to her husband, she tells a lot of lies and is very dubious,' Kate Henshaw-Nuttal, one of the film's stars, recently told a Lagos tabloid. 'My character is married to a guy called Ralph, played by Zack Orji. She is an all-bad woman.'

Henshaw-Nuttal is a Nollywood superstar. 'There is cute, there is pretty, there is hot and there is beautiful. Kate Henshaw-Nuttal falls into the beautiful bracket,' gushed the Daily Sun newspaper in a recent piece about the actress. 'Her lips, her eyes, her hair, her body, complement her pretty natural face which takes on a healthy chocolate hue.'

Alongside Genevieve Nnaji ('the Nigerian Sharon Stone'), Richard Mofe-Damijo ('the highest paid actor in Nigeria'), and Ramsey 'Lover boy' Nouah, Henshaw-Nuttal is instantly recognisable to adoring fans from Lagos to Kampala, from Brooklyn to Peckham. She belongs to a set feted, but also sometimes hounded, by the tabloid industry that has sprung up to feed the public's insatiable curiosity about their private lives.

My efforts to interview Zeb Ejiro were thwarted by a controversy that was in all the tabloids the week I flew into Lagos. Documented in loving detail on Naijarules.com, a website dedicated to all things Nollywood, the controversy involved Ibinabo 'IB' Fiberesima - a dashing, flamboyant actress who had taken the unprecedented step of writing a letter, addressed to the president of the actors' guild of Nigeria, entitled: 'Petition against Mr Zeb Ejiro for fraud against my company on a business transaction'.

The accusation revolved around a film entitled A Night in the Philippines, which Fiberesima claimed she had paid Ejiro to make to promote the beauty pageant Miss Earth. She said she was informed by a close associate of Ejiro's, after the end of shooting, that the director had changed the title of the film, removed her company's name as executive director and producer and put his own name and company to it, selling the film to an American Nollywood distributor for $3,500.

'I confronted Mr Zeb Ejiro,' said the actress-turned-producer. 'He denied it and said he was still editing; that he had to make it into a two-part film. I met him sometime in early 2006 and told him that I heard he was about to release the film, A Night in the Philippines, into the market. He denied it. Until later in the year he sold it to a marketer. Early 2007, I met with Zeb again, this time he told me point-blank that he owns the film and that I do not have any claim to the movie A Night in the Philippines any more...'

In a swiftly posted rebuttal, Ejiro countered: 'I have been in the business of film and television production since 1985. I earned the national honour of Officer of the Order of the Niger (OON), bestowed on me by the federal government through former President Obasanjo. My OON wasn't bought. I ask, therefore, why would I rubbish the name I sweated and toiled to build for so many years, and the national honour attached to it, over one movie? I have never been involved in intellectual property theft. Almighty, the omnipotent and omnipresent, is the ultimate judge and my witness.'

While this was all going on, I phoned Ejiro to arrange an interview with him. He agreed to an interview that was to take place the next day at his offices. But I turned up in Surulere the following evening to find the premises locked. Ejiro sounded vague and distant when I called him on his mobile. Then the line went dead. I redialled. His phone was switched off. Ejiro, who has since claimed that Fiberesima's motives were purely political, that she had been recruited to muddy his name because he was running for president of the Association of Movie Producers, had had it with the press.

The relationship between Nollywood and the press isn't always that frosty. Charles Novia is a member of an alliance of independent producers who have opted to do the unspeakable: cut their links with the all powerful marketers - the equivalent of the big Hollywood studios - who traditionally not only finance the films but distribute them.

Novia was compelled to take this step when he discovered that the marketeer who had financed and distributed his previous films had been bilking him. 'The marketer lied to me that my last film had sold 60,000 copies. I found out the real figure only by taking out a court order and going to the DVD replicating plant where we found, by looking at their records, that they had in fact sold over 300,000 copies. This marketeer called me a month ago and offered to settle the matter out of court.'

Novia and his partners have decided to take on the marketers by seeking finance from non-Nollywood financiers and to distribute the films themselves. To achieve this, they have not only organised a charm offensive through the press; they have also hired a team of lawyers and accountants to work for them. Recently, a consortium of banks decided to invest $1m in Novia's Nollywood venture. 'We've just shot four blockbusters waiting to be released,' says Novia, a former child actor who holds a degree in drama. 'As I speak to you, we have employed over 1,000 people waiting to be deployed into the streets on an advertising campaign for these films. It's costing us over $100,000 every month to employ this team. It's a new dawn for Nollywood. We're taking it to the next level.'

Nollywood has travelled far in its 15 years of existence. Its revenues are estimated to be over $250m a year and its films - all digitally shot - have a captive audience of 600 million Africans and millions more in the diaspora, particularly in the Caribbean and even here in the UK. There are few places in south-east London, the heart of the Nigerian community in Britain, where there isn't a Nollywood DVD stall. The cable channel BEN shows several of these films every night.

After Hollywood and Bollywood, Nollywood is the world's third-biggest film-producing industry. It has achieved this impressive feat without subsidy or investment and - fortunately perhaps - without attracting the faintest glimmer of interest from the Nigerian government or any NGO. It has a long way to go to achieve its dream of catching up with Mumbai or Los Angeles, but it is perfectly capable of doing so. The will is there. And at the rate it's going, soon, so will be the means.
