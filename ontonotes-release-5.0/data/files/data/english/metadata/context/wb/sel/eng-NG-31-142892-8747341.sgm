Why does everyone want to perform the mystical actions of fools.  I do
not understand this attitude.  Magic is so easy, it is as easy as
transmuting water, grain and maybe some salt into bread, using simple
tools, and simple energies readily available, and then consuming it,
or better still spreading the magic and sharing it with some one.  Why
is this so difficult.  The truth is the big magic is diluted, it is
long past the time when such is necessary.  We do not need astral
projection to see across the world, it is simpler to use the services
that are available.  We do not need all those fancy parlor tricks,
true magicians do not waste their time with such ridiculousness.  I
read here all about how to do this, and how to cast that.  The truth
is there is no difference between wishes and prayers, there is no
difference between casting and caring.  Put your energy into
everything you do and your life will be magical.  Leave the parlor
tricks to the fools who would use them to influence monarchs and
ignorant peasants.

The next time you want an easy way to clean your room, there is one,
it is called physical labor.  What is most misunderstood about witches
and magicians of the old myths is that they only provided for their
communities that which was needed, medicinal concoctions imbued with
positive energies, healthy foods with the love of tireless hands.  Yes
they held knowledge that others did not, but they were not amazing
knowledge today, they were such things as the ability to read and
write, which I still think is a bit of a mystery to some people.
There were those that could reshape the world, but only because they
could reshape perceptions.  They could shift shapes, because the
people wanted to see that happen.  We are not threatened any more.
Please stop this crap about persecution, we don't even know what that
is.  Our lives are not in jeopardy, there are no witch hunts any
more.  There is only ridicule from those of the established religions,
but they won't come to your house and lynch you, or burn you, so stop
this I am being mistreated bullshit and start making real magical
wonders like nice warm rolls, and home cooked meals.

I have this really nice book of spells, if you would like a couple ask
and I might give you one or two, but I warn you, they are really
simple, but after all simple is beautiful.

Realize that you've made certain assumptions.  Question the veracity of
those assumptions.  Draw new conclusions from such inquiries.  If that's too
mystical of a beginning to magical process, then by all means, use a simple
recipe to make bread.  Have toast.

I have made egregious assumptions on purpose.  Those that know will
know enough to know and those that do not will only find this.  That I
say make bread, or toast, in that case, is because the simplicity of
it is in the creation.  All the magic one needs is in the simplicity
of such mystical action.  I could have said chop wood, carry water,
mystical action, magical power, but would that have made sense to
those who are looking for the dramatic displays of flourish.  Why
should you want to create a display of flowery when you could just
pick flowers.  Why would you want to light a candle with your mind,
when you can use a match.  Magic is about necessity, the ancient magic
is about knowledge and not power.  The most powerful magic is stepping
outside the comfort zone and doing something for someone else for no
reason.  The second most powerful magic is understanding, master these
and those mental powers, and amazing actions used to entertain the
royal peasants will be less difficult.  Or continue to believe that
the parlor is where you need to apply yourself, and miss the real
magic, breathing.

I am a hedge wizard, content to tend to my small flock and create
small magics for the children.  I need no flourish, because I know I
am and that is all that is really needed to make one magical.

Sleep well,

Again, your assumptions indicate you miss the metaphor in reply.  They also
show that you either do not question your assumptions or are not aware you
are making them.  That's fine too.  There's no particular reason for you to
step outside of that comfort zone. Please disregard these replies in that
case.

Yes, that shows clearly in your posts. Nothing wrong with hedge or kitchen
witchery, although some could do without the dubious definitions of what
magic is or is not within those narrow parameters.  Remember your own
assumptions at least.

I am going to jump on this since you said it. I am already fighting
this in the astral. I have no clue why some practioners of realm
walking believe they have the right to try and manipulate your astral,
heal things they have no business trying to heal as if they know what
is best for you.

Every time I go astral, I feel like I have to sneak out of the
freaking door and it is *MY* door. I have an astral stalker. One I did
not choose or accept as being part of my life. Anger me is not the
word I choose. It is pissing me off. Enslavement is self centered and
arrogant. Respecting anothers boundaries even if no is not what you
want to hear is honor.

Astral is not a realm to induce your *personal* fantasies about
another it actually involves anothers life. A general reminder to
those who may be out there doing this. Ask me first. I may well say
yes but I will fight those who manipulate me. I have been really
patient. I am done being patient.

The people I want to be with know it and those who come to me know I
want to be with them. Simple. A knock will do, a yes or no is
respected. All others anymore are going to deal with a really pissed
off Aine.

Please..if you have to shroud yourselves, do not even knock to begin
with. I like knowing who I am dealing with. Mystery is only intriguing
to get my attention. It never keeps it forever.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why does everyone want to perform the mystical actions of fools.  I do
&gt; not understand this attitude.  Magic is so easy, it is as easy as
&gt; transmuting water, grain and maybe some salt into bread, using simple
&gt; tools, and simple energies readily available, and then consuming it,
&gt; or better still spreading the magic and sharing it with some one.  Why
&gt; is this so difficult.  The truth is the big magic is diluted, it is
&gt; long past the time when such is necessary.  We do not need astral
&gt; projection to see across the world, it is simpler to use the services
&gt; that are available.  We do not need all those fancy parlor tricks,
&gt; true magicians do not waste their time with such ridiculousness.  I
&gt; read here all about how to do this, and how to cast that.  The truth
&gt; is there is no difference between wishes and prayers, there is no
&gt; difference between casting and caring.  Put your energy into
&gt; everything you do and your life will be magical.  Leave the parlor
&gt; tricks to the fools who would use them to influence monarchs and
&gt; ignorant peasants.

&gt; The next time you want an easy way to clean your room, there is one,
&gt; it is called physical labor.  What is most misunderstood about witches
&gt; and magicians of the old myths is that they only provided for their
&gt; communities that which was needed, medicinal concoctions imbued with
&gt; positive energies, healthy foods with the love of tireless hands.  Yes
&gt; they held knowledge that others did not, but they were not amazing
&gt; knowledge today, they were such things as the ability to read and
&gt; write, which I still think is a bit of a mystery to some people.
&gt; There were those that could reshape the world, but only because they
&gt; could reshape perceptions.  They could shift shapes, because the
&gt; people wanted to see that happen.
">

'Scuse me, but making healthy food and concocting herbal remedies was normal
practice for *anyone* in a culture where the materials were available.
Literacy was elitist, sure, and shape-shifting was the province of
&quot;magicians&quot;, but you can't mix up up all of that and attribute it to some
imaginary generic witch-cult of old.

We are not threatened any more.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Please stop this crap about persecution, we don't even know what that
&gt; is.  Our lives are not in jeopardy, there are no witch hunts any
&gt; more.  There is only ridicule from those of the established religions,
&gt; but they won't come to your house and lynch you, or burn you, so stop
&gt; this I am being mistreated bullshit and start making real magical
&gt; wonders like nice warm rolls, and home cooked meals.
">

Of course people will lynch and burn those they identify as outsiders, and
quite often religious belief is the determining factor, as is skin colour,
ethnicity, sexual orientation or whatever. The ability to grow your own
carrots and bake your own bread isn't going to change that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have this really nice book of spells, if you would like a couple ask
&gt; and I might give you one or two, but I warn you, they are really
&gt; simple, but after all simple is beautiful.
">

Go on, then. Try and distinguish between &quot;spell&quot; and &quot;don't make pastry when
you're angry&quot;, though, 'cos we already know all that.

&gt; Buh...? There were already pagans in Ireland. And by the time of the
&gt; Inquisition, Ireland was heavily christianised.
">

What is your point? The Inquisition was disallowed in Celtic Christian
Ireland. Everybody was Pagan before Saint Patrick drove the &quot;snakes&quot;
out. Which he certainly did not. And there are no snakes in Ireland.
That is why many Pagans went to Ireland during that time.

&gt; &gt; their beliefs. They conformed and went to church, and held their Pagan
&gt; &gt; meetings in secret. Why -- even kings wore garters indicating a secret
&gt; &gt; sabbat was to be celebrated that very night.

&gt; Oh, come on. The garters were closer to Masonry than any sort of
&gt; pre-christian paganism ;)
">

No, the garter had nothing to do with Masonry. The garter was used to
call the Sabbat.

The First Spell

You must locate clay, this must be done of your own accord, it can not
be from any other place than from your own toil.  Upon location, you
must clean the clay of impurity, and make it clear.  Upon this you now
will form the clay into any shape, as the shape is not important.
This is the first magical spell, and requires that you do all the
work, for with out it you will have created nothing.  This is the
lesson, that magic is creation, even in destruction there is
creation.  Each step is the destruction of one part to create yet
another.  The final creation will serve as a reminder that the final
result is creation, and that positive or negative in intent, it is
your intent that is significant to the creation.

More will follow...

Bread

To the initiate:
Go into the forest and gather the makings of the fire, as this must be
the first part of this lesson.

Now go to the well (or stream) and fetch a quantity of water.

You will bring the water to the place by the fire.  This will then be
where you will complete the creation.

Now go to the field and gather grains that are ripened, and if there
no grains that have ripened, go into the forest and gather the seed of
the hickory tree.

Bring these to the place of the fire and place them near the water.

You will need of two stones, one that is of a bowl, and one that is of
a hammer.  These will also be placed near the water, that is by the
place where the fire shall be.

You will now place the grains in the bowl, and add one handful of
water for every two handfuls of grain.  This will now rest, for the
time that it takes to build the fire.

You will now make the fire as you were instructed in previous lessons.

With the fire set you will place the bowl near to the fire and allow
it warm to the touch on the under of the wrist.

This will be wear the water must be kept, not higher or lower.

The rest will be given later...
