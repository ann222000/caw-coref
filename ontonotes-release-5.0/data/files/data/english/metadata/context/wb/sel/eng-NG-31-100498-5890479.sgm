OT: (Antiquated?) Idea for a Bell n' Whistle

I don't follow developments in the auto industry much. Only to the
extent that I can be helped/hurt, mostly when buying a car, and
never the exotic stuff.

Years and years ago, whilst driving my DetroitMobile on the hiway
and thinking of all the newer Bells n' Whistles which I generally
regarded as either useless or too expensive to buy/maintain/repair,
I thought of one I could actually use.

Setting on the speedo. You figger the rollers won't cite under
60 mph, set it to 60. When you hit 61, it hums just barely audibly.
So's you can keep an eye on the 'leventy-seven zillion other
(alleged) drivers, any one of which could getcha splattered
all over the hiway at any moment. Not have to look down at
the speedo.

If the idea's any good at all, someone's already thought of it?
Even marginally good ideas come at a premium these days.

Perhaps someone has even tried to implement such?

Must be a slow day ... :=)

Prost,
Puddin'

Sorry Puddin', you're too late. I know there were early 70s Buicks with speed alarm.
There were others, I just don't remember who else offered it.

I have one in my 88 T-Bird.
Get up to whatever speed, push the button, go 5 over, it flashes and beeps.
A "barely audible" hum would be masked by wind, road noise, and the stereo.

Years ago I acquired a box of aftermarket devices a bit like this, to
scavenge for parts. They had five membrane type buttons on the front,
with preprogrammed speed limits printed on them (I want to say they
were 35, 45, 55, 65 and 75 but that might not be right). You press the
button for the speed limit in your area, and a LED lights up under that
button to let you know where the setting is pegged. If you go over that
speed, the thing beeps loudly and flashes the LED.

This product was intended for an area where radar detectors are illegal.

My 69 Caddy had essentially that feature.  You could set the cruise
control to whatever speed you wanted to not go over and when you got
to that speed the gas pedal would start pushing back.  The more you
went over the set speed, the more force the gas pedal pushed back
with.

Hmmm. Well, my old 1937 Cadillac LaSalle had a speedometer with illumination
that changed colour  when it went over 30 MPH.  It was only useful at night
though.

My '67 Caprice had that option. Yellow pointer in speedo was set via knob on
the bottom of dash to desired speed and a buzzer would go off when you
passed that speed.

Thanks for all responses.

I pretty much figgered it had been implemented, just
had no idea how/when.

But it didn't stick? Wouldn't likely find such feature/option
if I hit the showrooms today?

People probably found it annoying, especially when they know they are going
above  the posted speed limit, like during passing.

Another option is a heads-up display, where the dash board is projected to

A crazy man might conjecture that it probably wouldn't cost
an eyeball-and-a-testicle to engineer something that'd
make the steering wheel vibrate a little. Further
conjecture that such would'nt annoy anyone not passing
everthang on the road (in which case they likely wouldn't
need the damned thang anyway).

No, it wasn't a problem with anything being out of calibration, it was
just a function of the CC design.  If you used it as a cruise control
there was an electro magnet that held the linkage to the rotating part
inside the CC mechanism.  Tapping the brake turned off the
electromagnet but the CC mechanism was still engaged and tracking
speed so if you pushed the pedal again after taking your foot off the
brake it would contact the electro magnet and "resume".  But if you
put it in "speed sentry" or whatever they called it, the electromagnet
didn't turn on but the CC itself was still going.  So   driving with
your foot you would get to the set speed and the linkage would contact
the CC mechanism and in an effort to maintain the set speed the
mechanism pushed back, as if to make the car coast down like it would
if the CC was engaged instead of the speed sentry.

The calibration problems was simply that it was a dumb system that
relied on someone adjusting the CC mechanism so it's dial speed
setting was the same as the car was actually going.  It didn't
actually read the cars real speed like a modern system does.  And when
you went over a big bump the points that controlled the CC motor would
bounce and the CC would blip the throttle and then back off.  It was a
completely mechanically controlled system, no brains at all.
