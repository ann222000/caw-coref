They`ve certainly not suggested as such. They`ve made almost £2M from DVD
sales of the new series let alone other merchandise and it`s still one of
their most watched programmes of the week. Every time they`ve mentioned it
they`ve said it`ll go on and on.

One does get the idea that maybe RTD is trying to bow out with a &quot;McCoy&quot;
season though - 13 weeks of Catherine Tate as assistant, the promise of lots
of super special guest stars (my money is on Dale Winton, Graham Norton, and
George Michael as a space cop patrolling the glitzy urinals of the year
500,569) ...

Maybe he's hoping the ratings will tank and the show will be cancelled, thus
proving it can't go on without him.

Or, maybe, he knows that some people will think he is a tough act to follow,
and so is setting up his successor to be almost automatically the saviour of
Doctor Who, bringing it back to comparative glory from its disastrous fourth
revival season ...

I never realised Gatiss had anything to do with Little Britain but I`ve just
checked and you`re right! Although script editing for a sketch based comedy
show is totally different to a weekly drama I`d imagine.
That said, his second Who script was poor IMO and he hasn`t done another
since so who knows what he`d be like? I adore League of Gentlemen ( to be
honest I just wish he`s get on with making more of that! ) and was
disappointed with The Idiot`s Lantern quite a bit.

Little Britain has quite a Dr Who pedigree. Gatiss worked as a script
editor, Tom Baker does the comedy voice overs, star/writer David Walliams
has appeared in Dr Who spoofs with Gatiss, Anthony Head ( School
Reunion/Confidential voice overs ) is a recurring star in it and other
star/writer Matt Lucas appeared in BF audios ( and is a die hard Arsenal fan
as well just to annoy you even further Dave! ). In fact, Lucas has expressed
an interest in being the 11th Doctor when the time comes!

Oh I`d agree...Monty Python is far better. I suspect both Walliams and Lucas
would agree as well! I find LB very hit and miss but it has made me laugh on
occasion...I did see the live show when it toured the UK a couple of years
ago and it had it`s fair share of belly laughs. It`ll never be a great
favourite of mine though and both The League of Gentlemen and Mighty Boosh
live shows were far funnier IMO.

But that doesn`t get away from the fact it has a very Dr Who heavy set of
cast and writers!

Monty Python isn't a patch on the two ITV shows it was cobbled together
from. (&quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set/At Last The 1948 Show). I doubt if the newly
combined Catherine Tate/Dr Who show will be the ratings hit the BBC expects
it to be either.

Fair enough - I don`t honestly think the BBC are *expecting* it to get 13-14
million viewers next year though...which is what Dr Who plus The Catherine
Tate show combined would be. I`m sure they`ll be perfectly happy with it
getting what it got this year.

&gt;Oh I`d agree...Monty Python is far better. I suspect both Walliams and Lucas

&gt;occasion...I did see the live show when it toured the UK a couple of years
&gt;ago and it had it`s fair share of belly laughs. It`ll never be a great
&gt;favourite of mine though and both The League of Gentlemen and Mighty Boosh

&gt;But that doesn`t get away from the fact it has a very Dr Who heavy set of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I never realised Gatiss had anything to do with Little Britain but I`ve
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;checked and you`re right! Although script editing for a sketch based
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;comedy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;show is totally different to a weekly drama I`d imagine.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That said, his second Who script was poor IMO and he hasn`t done another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;since so who knows what he`d be like? I adore League of Gentlemen ( to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;honest I just wish he`s get on with making more of that! ) and was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;disappointed with The Idiot`s Lantern quite a bit.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Idiot's Lantern is bearable.

&gt;&gt; Bearable is harldy a ringing endorsment though is it? I agree it`s *OK*
&gt;&gt; but I expected so much more of him...especially after enjoying The Unquiet
&gt;&gt; Dead a fair bit.

&gt;I had fewer problems with Gatiss' script than with Lipmann's acting.

If Catherine Tate can suppress her ego and act in character (and if the
script writers and directors can have the maturity to let her do that)
then maybe she'll do OK. But she's a bit of a one-trick pony, and the
runaway bride, while not as bad as I expected, wasn't promising in that
regard.

Some of it is difficult to watch now. The movies will always be
classic, and the sketches that were cherry picked for And Now For

unfunny and dated.

It doesn't claim to reflect Britain. It's a comedy show. It takes trends
that are apparent in British society and exaggerates them for comic effect.

When were you last in the UK? How would you know how closely (or
otherwise) it reflects British society?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Little Britain is a sham of a show.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Really? What is fake about it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's one of the most popular shows the BBC has produced in the last

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It does not touch Monty Python.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I do like Monty Python. On form, it's great. But when you watch the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;original shows, there's a lot of crap in there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LB is extremely vile!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, that's one opinion. And you're perfectly entitled to it. It's
&gt;&gt;&gt;obviously not one shared by many people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But you said it was a &quot;sham of a show&quot;. So I asked you what is fake
&gt;&gt;&gt;about it. And you ignored my question.

&gt;&gt; Because it sure does not reflect Britain.

&gt;It doesn't claim to reflect Britain. It's a comedy show. It takes trends
&gt;that are apparent in British society and exaggerates them for comic effect.

&gt;When were you last in the UK? How would you know how closely (or
&gt;otherwise) it reflects British society?

&gt; Bleak House, The Bill. Also a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company.
&gt; Okay, there may be a few comedic roles in the films she's been in - I'm

Haven't seen any of the films, but The Bill was one episode 14 years ago.

And yes, she was in Bleak House and the RSC.  Where she was written for by
Dickens and Shakespeare.  In Doctor Who she's being written for Russell T
Davies.  That's a bit of a comedown.

The character might have been okay for a one-off (if they'd ditched the
silly motorway chase) but for 13 weeks?!?!

&gt; &gt;I don't think it's supposed to reflect Britain.  It's a comedy
&gt; &gt;series.  It distorts Britain for comic effect.  That's what comedy

&gt; Monty Python and the 2 Ronnies does a better and classier job of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I suspect someone like Mark Gattis will be able to take
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over.  A Doctor Who fan - and has been Script Editor on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shows like Little Britain.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Little Britain?? That *disqualifies** him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Little Britain has quite a Dr Who pedigree. Gatiss worked as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; script editor, Tom Baker does the comedy voice overs,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; star/writer David Walliams has appeared in Dr Who spoofs with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gatiss, Anthony Head ( School Reunion/Confidential voice overs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ) is a recurring star in it and other star/writer Matt Lucas
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appeared in BF audios ( and is a die hard Arsenal fan as well
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just to annoy you even further Dave! ). In fact, Lucas has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expressed an interest in being the 11th Doctor when the time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comes!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Little Britain is a sham of a show.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Really? What is fake about it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's one of the most popular shows the BBC has produced in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last few years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It does not touch Monty Python.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do like Monty Python. On form, it's great. But when you watch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the original shows, there's a lot of crap in there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LB is extremely vile!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, that's one opinion. And you're perfectly entitled to it. It's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obviously not one shared by many people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But you said it was a &quot;sham of a show&quot;. So I asked you what is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fake about it. And you ignored my question.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dave...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because it sure does not reflect Britain.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It`s a comedy show dopey, not some factual documentary. Bits of it
&gt;&gt;&gt; are very funny and believe me, characters like Vicky Pollard are all
&gt;&gt;&gt; too real on a lot of council estates!

&gt;&gt; You just insulted council estates residents!

&gt; He accurately described SOME people living on council estates you mean!
">

I live on one (in England). There's about 10% hardcore troublemakers give
the rest of us a bad name. In Holland they're called &quot;Tokkies&quot; (after a
notorious family of that name). They're forced to live in converted ship
containers away from civilised people.
