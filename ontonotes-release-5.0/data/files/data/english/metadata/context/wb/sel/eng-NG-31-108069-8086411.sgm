Apparently Jules reads here on a regular basis.

They are delighted with our discussion of this, and they have a
stats.rec.humor thread going strong in atj.  Cross posted all to hell,
of course.  I'm reading it in Buffy. Richard was &quot;kind&quot; enough to bring
it there so I'd know.

I've mentioned that I think their inability to create their own
entertainment is fairly sad.

But then, here I am discussing an atj thread, so ... pkb on me.

Well, it's either you or Tim Bruening since you both appear in
newsgroups that Robot Reporter posts to.

It is funny that Tim's name never shows up in Robot Reporter's
statistics even though he posts hundreds of posts here per week.

Maybe so, but I know ignoring them makes me a lot happier.  Keith and
Douglas Anderson are the only two over there that actually post
humorous remarks.  Jules and Droll are the rabid attack dogs and good
ol' Smelly Mel gets to expound his opinions on everything even though
no one pays any attention to him or his opinions.

It does indeed, if what I've been told is true. One has to wonder what, if
anything, he does with his time other than post to Usenet. If one cared
anything about it, that is, and of course one doesn't.

Well, I didn't really find him or read any of his comments.  I just
looked at the names of the users in the various newsgroups.  Both you,
Tim, and Robot Reporter appeared in a statistical newsgroup as well as
in rec.humor.

So what you're telling us is that you know the true identity of Robot
Reporter and that it isn't you, right?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, yes, that's fantastic, but how will this stop peachie from taking

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  Too late.  Peach has already taken over the world.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Or, you lot could stop following me around, and there'd be no issue
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   at all.  cuz drolly's right, I LEFT your newsgroup.  All ya'll have  to do is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   stop following me around, and the takeover is finished.

I've never knowingly posted in any statistical newsgroup, so it must have
been an inadvertant cross-post reply, which are far too common in Usenet.
It's a fair guess that at least some of the tens of thousands of your
postings have been cross-posted to newsgroups that you would prefer weren't
included, or were forged in your name. A Google search shows that the ATJ
jerk named Mel has actually posted solicitous messages in your name to an
alt.personals.gay newsgroup, and an ignorant person might think that was
you.

I don't know squat about any Robot Reporter (and there seem to be many of
them in many newsgroups), and I have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do
with any of them, nor do I give a flying fuck about any of it, as I have
neither the time, taste nor talent for such bean-counting things, especially
with a puny 28.8 dialup connection.

My neighbor reports that she thought she saw the _Lost in Space_ robot
frantically trying to mate with a garbage can, though.
