Resealing MH caps!

Has anyone done this?  Today I found a small strip laying in the grass
and found it had dropped off the side cap, which means to me the caps
need to be resealed from top to bottom.  Right?

If it is to be done did you do it in increments ie one side then the
roof and then the other side or take it all out before replacing or
what.  I &quot;assumed&quot; that lap sealant would be used in sealing it
backup.  What I am asking about is the U shaped piece of plastic that
covers where the caps and the main body are attached front and rear.
I figure the MH is 9 years old so most of the sealants need to be
replaced.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.

If it's the narrow strip that covers the screw heads, all is needed is
to put it back in place. It is for show and has nothing to do with
sealing. Is that what fell off?

As far as I can see it is a u shaped piece of plastic covering the
joints where the caps front and rear and the main body meet.
Presently sealed but starting to dry out and I want to seal it again
before it causes a leak. If it covers any screws I can't see them and
they were sealed on both sides of the u shaped plastic piece that
covers the roof and both sides of the MH front and rear!

Hi Steve

Thanks for your web page about sealing the caps.  BTW I am willing to
follow your advice about &quot;If your brand has bad sealant, you need to
remove it.  Better yet, buy a better motor home.&quot;  But I could not
find any place on your site on how to convince the wife! (grin)

Lee,

Wolf's info assumes that you are sealing fiberglass to fiberglass, or
fiberglass to metal. That info does NOT apply to rubber roofs where
you are pretty much stuck with using Dicor's crappy 501 lap sealant.

Although you can't go wrong with high-grade polyurethane marine
sealants such as the 3M stuff, the down side, is that it costs 4x that
of construction grade polyurethane; and it quickly becomes
stale-dated.  You really have to watch out for the expiry date on any
kind of polyurethane sealant.

I sealed 64 feet of my roof perimeter, five years ago under less than
ideal conditions in a campground 2000 km from home, and right after a
rainstorm that provided me with more data than I wanted. All I could
find for the emergency repair, was the cheap LePage PL construction
grade polyurethane available at Home Depot. This stuff is still going
strong after 5 years.

Hi Stan

Well the sides are fiberglass to plastic, the U shaped cap is to cover
the joint from the front/rear cap to body that is right.  The roof is
the EDPM? RUBBER.  More or less I thought this was a standard practice
to cover joints.  It has to be sealed on both sides of the U shaped
cap and it is one solid piece from the bottom of one side over the
roof and down the other side.  I will have to check around on some
stuff and wait till it cools a little before I start.  Don't want to
end up like a guy I new who at age 28 died from heat exhaustion.
Thanks for the comback.  Appreciate it.  I know the so called lap
sealant is still good it is just the sides right now.

Was this a rubber roof?
With what product?  Are we to assume Dicor Lap Sealant?

Is that why it failed?

Is polyurethane not petroleum based?
