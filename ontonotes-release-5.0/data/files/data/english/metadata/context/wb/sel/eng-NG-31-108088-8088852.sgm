Anyone else see Jake Brown's skateboard Big Air biff where he pushed
out of the finish quarter-pipe and fell 50 feet onto the flat?  Ouch.

Yes, and ouch.
Did you see both his shoes come off and fly across the room?
Who's your shoe sponsor, dude?

Did you see the way the MDO flexed? Cracked vertebra, whiplash, broken wrist
I think. One hell of a concussion goes without saying...
Fairly gnarly, dude.

Man, you are so... last week.

The TV video was on youtube last week, but got yanked by ESPN.  Someones
homemade video can be seen at

Note the shoes flying off on impact.  Kinda the way bike parts go flying
when Jay claims a pebble got stuck in his front brake.

How long 'till an FMX guy shoes some slicks onto his bike and starts
doing skate ramps?
