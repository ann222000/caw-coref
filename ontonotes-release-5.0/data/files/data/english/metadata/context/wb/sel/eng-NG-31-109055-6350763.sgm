<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Nudists and Textiles

&gt; There is a minority of people who get some kind of pleasure from
&gt; wandering about in the nude and being seen. I am prepared to believe
&gt; that for some of them this isn't even a form of sexual deviation. Of
&gt; course for many of them it is quite clearly a fetish, a form of sexual
&gt; deviance, and these people are sick but use the acceptable face of the
&gt; nudist movement to hide their perversions from the public censure they
&gt; so richly deserve. Many nudist beaches and the like are notorious for
&gt; lewd conduct and promiscuous homosexual acts. Unfortunately the nudist
&gt; and naturist movements are so small they seem to divide the whole world
&gt; into us and them, nudists and &quot;textiles&quot; and assume everybody on their
&gt; side of their line is good and all the rest are uptight prudes. This is
&gt; a shame. There are some people who do feel relaxed and empowered by
&gt; being naked among other naked people, they should be allowed to get on
&gt; with their own thing protected from perverts spying on them or hiding
&gt; within their group.

&gt; Most people do not feel greatly troubled by clothes or repressed at the
&gt; thought of wearing them in public. Most people are happy to wear clothes
&gt; and happier still to see other people around them wear their clothes
&gt; too. Such people are normal. The majority. The majority should never be
&gt; given a derogatory label by any minority which is seeking tolerance and
&gt; understanding. For the nudist minority to call the majority &quot;textiles&quot;
&gt; is highly offensive and counterproductive. Perhaps the majority of
&gt; normal people should also be called warm-fuckers because of their
&gt; refusal to engage in necrophilia? What inventive derogatory names would
&gt; those who engage in bestiality like to confer on the majority that don't?

&gt; If a group of people go down to a lake and strip off they are turning
&gt; that lake into a nudist area and deterring anybody who does not want to
&gt; encounter nudity from using that resource in the way that they want to.
&gt; Nudism is an aggressive act. It stakes a claim on a large piece of
&gt; territory, the radius defined by the usable range of a pair of
&gt; binoculars. It cannot be right that two or three people can lay claim to
&gt; such a large area by their selfish actions without the rest of the
&gt; community having any say in the matter at all.

&gt; If you go down to a busy public beach and lay out a beach towel and lie
&gt; on it in a swimming costume that is reasonable act. People will give you
&gt; a reasonable amount of space to get on with what you want to do. But you
&gt; cannot expect a large group of people on a public beach to give you the
&gt; space you might like to fly a stunt kite, draw up a full sized cricket
&gt; pitch or indeed to lie around naked or to have a shag. There's a time
&gt; and a place for everything and the community does not owe any special
&gt; favours to people who want to &quot;act naturally&quot;.

&gt; If you want to fly your kite on the beach you have to go there early in
&gt; the morning or when the sun isn't blazing down. If you want to sunbathe
&gt; naked you have to find somewhere that does not inconvenience other
&gt; people. And being naked is inconveniencing other people whatever you
&gt; might like to think about it. You might think that other people should
&gt; think like you do but the fact is they don't, and tolerance, the first
&gt; step to civilization, requires that you accept that other people are not
&gt; the same as you.

&gt; Nudism is a reasonable activity and it should be accommodated. That
&gt; means designated areas in which clothes are optional and people seen to
&gt; be spending too long gawping at the nudists should be moved on or
&gt; arrested for breach of the peace. There should be no places that clothes
&gt; are banned unless such places are privately owned and administered. As
&gt; the vast majority of people are not nudists clothes optional areas
&gt; should be relatively small and located in such a way that they can be
&gt; easily avoided, they should be at the end of the footpath not right next
&gt; to the car park.

&gt; The designation of areas for nudists and naturists (a term British
&gt; nudists seem to prefer) should be down to the local communities, not the
&gt; nudists themselves. Communities should be protected from invasion by
&gt; incoming nudists imposing their culture on somewhere they think is
&gt; pretty and a good place to spend a few hours and not a lot of money.
&gt; Nudists don't have pockets.

&gt; Areas designated for nudity is a good idea. There is a minority who find
&gt; that walking about naked is &quot;liberating&quot; in some non-specific way, and
&gt; of course another minority of perverts who just like to see and be seen
&gt; naked. But nudism is not appropriate for everywhere and everybody. Or is
&gt; that every body? Most people don't have bodies that are attractive
&gt; enough for them to be comfortable parading around naked. For many people
&gt; clothes are a bloody good idea. Therefore I am very much against any
&gt; extension of nudity into new areas without the appropriate local
&gt; democratic decision making, tourists who impose their standards on
&gt; foreign communities deserve a good slapping. If the locals don't say
&gt; it's alright to go topless on their beaches then it is incredibly bad
&gt; mannered and arrogant to just do it.
&gt; Nudity and Sexuality

&gt; Thrusting your sexuality in the faces of the wider community is not a
&gt; basic human right.

&gt; Public nudity is not a basic human right.

&gt; Nudity is fine in its place: in the nude spa, on the nude beach and in
&gt; the home. It is not acceptable in shops, factories, schools, offices or
&gt; on the street. Neither is semi-nudity, the boundary-pushing that women
&gt; seem to think somehow expresses their personality. It's amazing how many
&gt; women keep their personality on their chest and between their legs.

&gt; I would also like to see more women charged with indecent exposure. It's
&gt; not on for women to go about with no knickers and short skirts or long
&gt; dresses with slashes to the waist. Some women are even wearing
&gt; miniskirts to work with no knickers on and complaining that men are
&gt; looking at them and getting the men into trouble: absurd! That is sexual
&gt; harassment and indecent exposure. I wouldn't say that knickers should be
&gt; compulsory or that miniskirts should be banned but the combination
&gt; certainly should not be tolerated in public, it is exhibitionism and it
&gt; is incredibly antisocial behaviour. The idea that a woman can choose to
&gt; wear no knickers because she wants to, can choose to wear a short skirt
&gt; because she wants to and can choose to do a pirouette on the dance-floor
&gt; because she wants to and if any man she doesn't fancy makes a comment
&gt; about seeing her pudenda she can call him a pervert for looking at her
&gt; is ridiculous.

&gt; The perverted response is not to notice.

&gt; But don't worry, I'm not being sexist here, I'd make men in kilts wear
&gt; pants too and if people of either sex want to go commando they can do so
&gt; in skirts that reach below the knee.

&gt; The Janet Jackson nipple baring incident was just bad manners. Women do
&gt; not expose their breasts on TV except late at night. Everybody knows
&gt; that rule. She was just trying to get herself extra notoriety in a tried
&gt; and trusted way. Remember Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct? She became in
&gt; some people's view the only woman in America with a vulva. Janet was
&gt; trying, and succeeding, in becoming the only woman in America with
&gt; nipples. And everybody fell over themselves to see that she got exactly
&gt; the notoriety she sought. Now if you think Janet Jackson you think
&gt; breasts and if you see a nipple exposed accidentally you think Janet.
&gt; Any commercial company trying to get that kind of effect on the world's
&gt; opinion would have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in
&gt; advertising. $550,000 fine? And it was CBS that paid it! She'll be
&gt; laughing all the way to the bank.

&gt; Do you remember anything about *the plot* of Basic Instinct? Me neither.

&gt; After this film was released the world reacted as if Sharon Stone was
&gt; the only woman in America with a vulva. But what did we actually see?

&gt; Women who dress to expose are a public menace.

&gt; Short skirts are reasonable. Wearing no knickers is reasonable. But
&gt; wearing a short skirt and no knickers is simply exhibitionism and a
&gt; public menace. It is designed to distract men and make out that the
&gt; &quot;wearer&quot; of this fashion statement is the only woman in the vicinity
&gt; with a vulva and the will to use it.

&gt; Women who wear short skirts or slashed skirts and no knickers should be
&gt; prosecuted for indecent exposure. No, it isn't reasonable to expect men
&gt; not to look or not to notice, they are supposed to notice. Somehow women
&gt; think that they can wear revealing clothes and only the men they want to
&gt; have sex with will notice! That is absurd.

&gt; Repression, Modesty, Exhibitionism and Feminism

&gt; In societies controlled by men and in which women have no power the
&gt; women are not told to prance around naked or in conical bras for the
&gt; enjoyment of the men. Repressed women have to hide their bodies, their
&gt; shape and their beauty. Things might be different if the world was run
&gt; by bachelors, then perhaps everywhere would look a bit like The Playboy
&gt; MansionT, but no such society exists or has ever existed in human
&gt; history. In societies run by and for rich powerful men female sexuality
&gt; and beauty is dangerous, something to be controlled and harnessed. Men
&gt; do not want women to go around half naked and looking sexy. Why? Because
&gt; it undermines men's control. Men are not in control of which women are
&gt; beautiful and sexy. Beauty is a threat to a well-structured society
&gt; because it is nearly randomly distributed. If men could really make all
&gt; the rules then princesses would be beautiful because they were
&gt; princesses, because they were the daughters of kings.
