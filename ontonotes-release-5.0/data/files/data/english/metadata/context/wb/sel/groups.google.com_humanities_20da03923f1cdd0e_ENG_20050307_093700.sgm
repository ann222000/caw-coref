Wal-mart, privatized education and libel

I am bringing this discussion into a new topic. The thread we were
communicating in was called &quot;Religion vs. Philosophy,&quot; but we have
long been talking about school vouchers and now the economic effect of
Wal-mart in our society.

Rather than answer the various questions posed to me by
Deborah/Moresense and Sam individually, I thought I'd begin their
most recent charge that I have somehow libeled Wal-mart in my attempt
to prove a point about the effect privatized education would have on
teachers and their students.

For those who may be just now joining this discussion, I had argued
that if the proposed school voucher programs were implemented
successfully on a nationwide scale, the resulting exodus of the cream
of the crop from those struggling schools would condemn those schools
to closure, opening the market for a new form of low-cost schooling. I
labeled &quot;Wal-mart schools&quot; to differentiate them from the private
schools that exist today.

It has been my argument that these schools would be profit-driven and
would likely continue to reduce their student resources and services in
order to feed their bottom line, which may be a valid activity for the
low-cost entrant into a market, but doesn't seem to keep the
educational needs of the children as its highest priority.

Sam and Deborah/Moresense then both accused me of libeling Wal-mart. In
this post, I will make a few observations about Wal-mart and tie them
back into my argument about education.

Section I: Libel

First, allow me to address this charge of libel. I am not confident
that either of the two accusers in question are familiar with libel or
communication law in general. I have actually taught a few classes in
this area, so let me offer the following observations concerning their
charge.

Libel is a tort in our system designed to protect the market value of a
person's reputation. The distinguishing characteristic that separates
libel from the false light privacy tort is this grounding in property
law, and that is why the proofs for libel are built around economic
recovery.

First, to win a judgment against an offending party, one must prove
that the statement offered is demonstrably false. In addition, the
prosecutor has the burden of proving that the defendant offered the
statement in a manner that demonstrated a &quot;willful disregard for the
truth,&quot; meaning in this case that I knew my comments to be false and
made them anyway despite having received definitive proof to the
contrary.

However, since Wal-mart is a public citizen, the prosecutor must prove
that my words caused damage to Wal-mart, that its ability to transact
on its name and reputation have been irreparably damaged. Finally, the
prosecutor must prove that I made the offending remark in the spirit of
actual malice, meaning that I have either expressed a consistent
pattern of abuse (such as in the case of a stalker) or that I have some
impending advantage driving my statements (like I am a competitor
seeking to gain Wal-mart's business).

ALL of these conditions must be proven to produce a judgment of libel.
I feel comfortable having any property lawyer or media scholar of your
choosing read my words in the relevant threads and pass judgment upon
them. Alternatively, you may alos contact Wal-mart's corporate office
and direct them to my comments and ask them to press charges.

There simply is not case for libel in my statements. (And let me point
out that I do shop at Wal-mart occasionally, which would make actual
malice a very hard proof indeed.) I do not believe that Wal-mart is
evil (nor have I made these claims), but I am not blind to the effects
that its most recent strategies and activities have caused for its
workers, American manufacturing or even the retail market in general.

However, let's dig into what was said and what my rationale and
reasons for saying so were.

Section II: My statements and their context

Most of my statements were comparing elite private schools to Foley's
or Dillard and these new schools that would emerge from failed public
schools as &quot;Wal-mart schools.&quot; The only thing I seem to have
directly said about Wal-mart itself is that it offers a lower quality
of goods and services than Foley's or Dillards, and that working at a
&quot;Wal-mart school&quot; as compared to an exclusive private school would
probably be as bad as working at Wal-mart itself.

I'm not sure there's really anything to defend here, but let's
talk about Wal-mart for a minute. Perhaps it will help with the point I
was trying to make about education.

Wal-mart sits in the low-cost business position of the retail goods
market. While some stores try and focus on quality or exclusivity,
Wal-mart tries to make small profits on larger amounts of goods, a
strategy which requires its SBUs to continually view quality control as
a stressor for profit.

Section III: Wal-mart and the quality of goods and services

I'm not sure anyone would claim that one can shop at Wal-mart and buy
goods of the same quality as Foley's or Dillards. Furniture from
Wal-mart is more likely to be made out of particle board than wood, and
the reverse is true at the department stores mentioned. Clothing at
Wal-mart is generally of a lower quality than department stores,
dinnerware and tableware at Wal-mart are generally of a lower quality,
bedding ... bathroom accessories ... electronics ... all tend to be of
a lower quality than at department stores.

When it comes to services, Wal-mart tends to provide less consistency
than at high-end stores. The stores often share employees across
departments and they offer less training to their floor employees than
department stores do.

What affect do low cost business strategies have on the quality of
goods and services? The stronger Wal-mart becomes, the less they are
willing to pay for manufactured goods. If you have ever dealt with
delivering a product or have met someone who has (and I have), you
quickly become frustrated with Wal-mart. They are willing to pay less
to suppliers and are much less gracious on freight and insurance
policies than are other retailers. The result of all of these variables
are lower quality goods, often by relatively unknown manufacturers
(more on that below).

Section IV: Wal-mart's effect on the competition

Wal-mart also has a dramatic effect on other retailers. As Wal-mart
continues to undercut the K-marts of the world, those retails stores
are forced to adopt similar strategies, differentiate themselves into a
new class with a new strategy (as Target did by filling the middle slot
between low-cost and department stores) or simply be driven from the
market.

So, how does this apply to education? My argument was that low-cost
schools formed from the failed public schools (and without those top
students who escaped to more elite schools) would be driven to pursue
the bottom line at the expense of the quality of service. Which is fine
when one is talking about television sets or shorts, but downright
awful when one is talking about education. In order to pursue enough
profits to generate a return to the shareholders, curriculum, operating
costs, resources and facilities would all be seen as areas in which to
reduce cost to &quot;pass along the savings&quot; to the customer.

Section V: Wal-mart's employees

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From an employee perspective, Wal-mart has not been a great place to

"/>

work. Wal-mart has one of the highest percentage of minimum wage
employees in retail. When Sam Walton was alive, Wal-mart treated its
employees more consistently, with the executives at the top making low
salaries and the workers at the bottom making relatively well. Sadly,
Walton's vision was not shared by the next generation.

Consider the following figures:

$2,200,000,000: Total dividends Wal-Mart plans to pay its shareholders
this fiscal year, after a 44% dividend increase announced March 2, 2004

$23,000,000: Average annual compensation for Wal-Mart CEO Lee Scott,
2000-2003

$4,500,000: Average annual compensation for previous Wal-Mart CEO David
Glass, 1995-2000

$70,000 to $150,000: Bonuses (coming on top of typical base salaries
exceeding $50,000) commonly earned by Wal-Mart store managers in 2002
as incentives to increase their own store's annual profit, with profit
increases coming largely through holding down labor costs

$9.68: Average hourly living wage as defined by 22 of the U.S. cities
and towns that passed living wage ordinances between 2000 and 2004

$9.60: Average hourly wage Wal-Mart could pay if one-third of its
current profits were diverted to pay its U.S. employees instead

$9.54: Average hourly wage Wal-Mart could afford to pay if it raised
its prices an average of 1%

$9.32: Average hourly wage Wal-Mart could pay if the current annual
dividend going to its stockholders were diverted to pay its U.S.
employees

$9.15: Hourly wage that Dana Mailloux was earning at a Ft. Myers,
Florida Wal-Mart when she and more than a dozen similarly paid
employees were laid off because of &quot;lack of work&quot;, after which, as they
were leaving the store, they noticed &quot;six new hires -- red vests in
hand -- filling out paperwork,&quot; and then that next weekend saw Help
Wanted ads on the store's bulletin board

$8.00: Approximate nationwide average hourly wage for Wal-Mart
employees

$6.25: Starting wage for a cashier at the Wal-Mart Supercenter in
Salina, Kansas, 2003

And here's a discussion about how Wal-mart has defended their pay
scale and how others have analyzed their statements:

Section VI: Wal-mart's recent employee scandals

One need not look further than some of Wal-mart's recent scandals to
see that the dogmatic pursuit of low costs and high profits has not
been good for employees. Here is a recap, in case you haven't read
about this:

On June 19, 2001, six current and former female employees filed a sex
discrimination suit against Wal-Mart, the largest employer in the
world. In June 2004, a federal court judge certified Dukes v. ...

Let's first establish what you're saying.

Is the difference between public school and private schools that the
latter do not &quot;keep the educational needs of the children as its
highest priority&quot;? Is this because private schools were &quot;profit
driven&quot;? Is Wal-Mart &quot;profit-driven&quot; and therefore inclined to &quot;reduce
its services&quot; in an effort to &quot;feed its bottom line&quot;? What makes
Wal-Mart different from other companies that you seem to hold in higher
esteem? Do other companies not watch their bottom line? Are other
companies not &quot;profit-driven&quot;?

It sounds to me like you are saying that Wal-Mart was providing
inferior services. When I ask you to elaborate, you say that this was
the case because Wal-Mart was &quot;profit driven&quot;?!?.?

Make up your mind. Either it's libel, or it's nonsense!

So, back to your need for clarification on my words. Yes, the low-cost
player in a given market must drive down costs to the wire, because
such firms operate on much lower profit margins than the higher-end
firms.

Public school is an artificial attempt to provide a basic standard
education free from the worst of the pressures of the market. And yes,
public school represent a terrible way to run a business (if they were
publicly traded firms, most of them would have a negative return on
their investment).

But it's been my view all along that providing education is worth
losing money over. Better to maintain an artificial standard of
education than allow the lowest members of our society to receive an
even lower quality of education.

Actually it's neither.

If you had any integrity, you would either make your case for libel or
retract your charge.

The SBUs who chooose the low-cost niche in a given market have to be
focused primarily on driving costs down and keeping costs low. And the
primary way most do it is to cut costs and value to the customer to
charge the most for the goods it is the least costly to produce and
deliver.

Have you ever had any marketing classes? Or strategic management
classes? These are pretty basic concepts.

The low-cost entrant by necessity offers lower quality goods and
services than those who seek product and service differentiation
through reputation and status.

Wal-mart offers lower quality good than Foley's because Wal-mart sells
more of its goods at a lower return, making up for the lower profit
margins through sheer volume. And yes, this means Wal-mart must
continually seek out ways to lower the cost of the delivery of those
goods and services to continue to maintain that razor-thin profit
margins.

Target, on the other hand, has chosen a path between Wal-mart and the
department stores. They offer goods and services of a slightly higher
quality than Wal-mart and they charge more than slightly more for the
quality difference and the shopping experience.

Foley's sellls fewer goods than both, but continually seeks out higher
profit margins to make more per sale.

Are you really not getting this? I can go on, but I just can't believe
you don't see why these retailers, once they've adopted the strategies
they have, have certain aspects of their business dictated by the
market.

So, I was right after all? Are you saying that Wal-Mart is providing a
sub-standard service? Aren't you saying that vouchers lead to schools
that would provide sub-standard service? A type of education you'd
like to call Wal-Mart type of schools. As if Wal-Mart was providing
sub-standard service? I really cannot read anything else in it.

Lower quality? Not necessarily? Perhaps sometimes, perhaps not other
times. Wal-Mart may well be cheaper, if we were talking about the same
product. So, if Wal-Mart provides better prices, then why are you
complaining about alleged sub-standard services? Also, Wal-Mart offers
the convenience of doing all your shopping under one roof. It's hard
to say what's better, it's a personal taste for many people, depending
on their lifestyle, etc. It's something that people should decide for
themselves, at least that's what I would say. But you seem to be
suggesting that government should set standards as to how and where we
should do our shopping, as well as in education?

&lt;Lower quality? Not necessarily? Perhaps sometimes, perhaps not other
times. Wal-Mart may well be cheaper, if we were talking about the same

product. So, if Wal-Mart provides better prices, then why are you
complaining about alleged sub-standard services?&gt;

Of course it's cheaper, because the goods and services are of lower
quality. What goods should we compare?

Furniture? Wal-mart furniture costs significantly less than furniture
at Foleys. Wal-mart furniture is generally made of particle board
instead of wood, and is usually produced by an unknown manufacturer
(and rarely an American one these days).

Shirts and pants? Not only does Wal-mart not carry any designer labels,
but their clothes are generally made of cheaper materials.

Shoes? Not only can you not find the brand names you know at Wal-mart,
but their shoes tend to not be nearly as durable (unless you're talking
about workboots).

Jackets? Ties? Belts? I can't even believe we're having this
discussion.

And let's not forget services. Wal-mart does not pay their employees as
well nor offer commissions. There are fewer employees available per
section, and those employees are less specialized in their knowledge
and offered services (you will not find a Wal-mart tailor, for example,
who can adjust a pair of pants to fit you precisely or a consultant to
offer you advice on matching a tie to a shirt).

In some cases, such as food products, or media products or basic office
supplies, you can find the same items for less money than at a
competing grocery store, music store or office supply store. However,
the selection is always more limited, so as long as Wal-mart has
exactly what you want, its the economical choice. But try finding
those chips in a new flavor, that CD with lyrics too explicit for
Wal-mart's fare or a file folder in any color other than manilla and
you are out of luck.

Once again, Wal-mart has generally a lower quality of goods and
services than a department store (like Foleys) or other higher-end
stores.

I ask you again to make your case that my statement that Wal-mart
offers a lower quality of goods and services than a department store
like Foley's is libelous or retract your charge.

You need to prove that my statement is false, that I willfully stated
it while knowing it was false, that my words damaged Wal-mart's ability
to make money in some way, and that I possessed malicious intent.

&lt; Also, Wal-Mart offers
the convenience of doing all your shopping under one roof. &gt;

And this has exactly what to do with the quality of their goods and
services? Why are you shifting the argument?

Of course Wal-mart has a &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; approach. That's part of
the low-cost strategy. The goal is to offer a higher volume of goods at
discounted prices to make up for the lower return per item with volume
of sales. Which includes constantly driving down acquisition or
production costs.

&lt;It's hard
to say what's better, it's a personal taste for many people, depending

on their lifestyle, etc. It's something that people should decide for
themselves, at least that's what I would say.&gt;

None of these statements have any relevance to whether Wal-mart has a
lower level of quality and services than a department store. Stop
shifting the argument.

&lt; But you seem to be
suggesting that government should set standards as to how and where we

should do our shopping, as well as in education? &gt;

Not at all, and I plainly said that the low-cost strategy is a good one
when you are talking about consumer goods. I am all for letting the
market decide when we're talking about manufactured goods, because if
most people choose lower quality for increased quantity, the risks are
less than when we are talking about education.

If someone buys a cheap entertainments system and it collapses after 2
years, fine. If someone's kid gets an education with &quot;particle board
math skills&quot; and collapses at his job and get fired, that's quite
another.

Earlier, you said:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; education than allow the lowest members of our society to receive
&gt; an even lower quality of education.

&lt;So , you seem to be suggesting that government should set a standard.
By default, are you implying that the Wal-Mart was sub-standard? If
so, what exactly is it in Wal-Mart that doesn't seem to live up to
those standards? &gt;

What I said was that you cannot judge the private schools of tomorrow
(without public schools in the picture) by looking at private schools
today.

Public education is available for the majority of our children. If it
were not (when schools were closed), then there would be a void, and
the market dictates that the low-cost strategy would be wildly
successful at filling that new need in the educational market.

However, like Wal-mart (the reigning low-cost retailer of consumer
goods), the quality of goods and services of low-cost private schooling
would be much lower than the higher-end private schools. An being
driven by the low-cost strategy in a free market without the public
standards placed upon it would seem to do for those schools what it
does for Wal-mart: force a continual decrease ion the quality of goods
in services in order to maintain a healthy profit margin by making
small profit margins on larger groups of people with less resources to
spend.

Which, once again, is fine when we're talking about toasters and belts,
but much less acceptable when we're talking about the quality of the
future thinkers and leaders in our society.

I cannot believe this either. You seem to be suggesting that Wal-Mart
sells bad products. But I rather buy three cheap T-shirts for the same
price of one expensive T-shirt at a &quot;quality&quot; shop. At least, I can
wear the color I want each day and I can throw one away if I'm done
with it and I still got two more to go. Why not let the customer

Because beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Just like you may
appreciate personal service when buying your furniture, someone else
may prefer to buy furniture quickly, without the harassment of

That is precisely the issue! What you call quality is in fact a
personal preference. You seek to impose national standards under the
pretence that you knew what was better. Ironically, reality shows that
your choice is not the best one for people who cannot afford to buy
their pants from a personal tailor. You seek to drive up prices under
the pretence of &quot;quality&quot;, but in reality you would just be driving up
prices, because the kind of government control you seek simply does
drive up prices.

Void, what void? There would be excellent education! Don't make
unsubstantiated assumptions, especially not if the turn out to be

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However, like Wal-mart (the reigning low-cost retailer of consumer
&gt; goods), the quality of goods and services of low-cost private

&gt; those schools what it does for Wal-mart: force a continual

So, we are back to Wal-Mart again. What is it? Are education and

*Sigh*

You never did tell me what it is you do for a living. What do you do?

What connection do you have to education?

- Show quoted text -
&lt;I cannot believe this either. You seem to be suggesting that Wal-Mart
sells bad products. &gt;

Actually, I said that Wal-mart sells goods and services that are of
lower quality than Foley's. You are the one anxious to judge things as
&quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot;

&lt;But I rather buy three cheap T-shirts for the same
price of one expensive T-shirt at a &quot;quality&quot; shop. At least, I can
wear the color I want each day and I can throw one away if I'm done
with it and I still got two more to go. Why not let the customer
decide? Why this patronage? &gt;

So, the Wal-mart T-shirts are of lower quality than the iZod T-shirts
you are talking about. Good, I'm glad you agree with at least that
much.

And my argument is that some people do not have a choice: they cannot
afford to shop at Foley's.

And I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;patronage&quot;?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And let's not forget services. Wal-mart does not pay their

"/>

&gt; employees as well nor offer commissions. There are fewer
&gt; employees available per section, and those employees are less
&gt; specialized in their knowledge and offered services (you will not
&gt; find a Wal-mart tailor, for example, who can adjust a pair of pants
&gt; to fit you precisely or a consultant to
&gt; offer you advice on matching a tie to a shirt).

&lt;Again, why not let people decide where they want to work? Why this
patronage? &gt;

How arrogant. Many people do not get to decide where they work. Many
people in our society are happy to have the lowest paying jobs because
that low pay is better than nothing.

But that doesn't mean they have chosen to work there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In some cases, such as food products, or media products or basic

"/>

&gt; office supplies, you can find the same items for less money than at
&gt; a competing grocery store, music store or office supply store.
&gt; However, the selection is always more limited, so as long as Wal-
&gt; mart has exactly what you want, its the economical choice. But
&gt; try finding those chips in a new flavor, that CD with lyrics too
&gt; explicit for Wal-mart's fare or a file folder in any color other
than
&gt; manilla and you are out of luck.

&lt;So, you go elsewhere for your special needs. But you still haven't
explained why Wal-Mart was inferior. &gt;

Well, you are the one with the &quot;inferior&quot; label, not me. I just said
that Wal-mart offers a lower quality of goods and services than
department stores do. Test me. Go buy a shirt from each (the least
expensive Wal-mart shirt you can find and the most expensive Foley's
shirt you can find). Which do you think will be of higher quality?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Once again, Wal-mart has generally a lower quality of goods and

"/>

&gt; services than a department store (like Foleys) or other higher-end
&gt; stores.

&lt;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&gt;

As apparently is a logical rationale. ;-)

&lt; I'm quite happy with my three
T-shirts and I don't see why I should be forced to go elsewhere and
buy one T-shirt with a little aligator on it for the same price as
three T-shirts at Wal-Mart.&gt;

Well, since you are missing the point entirely, let me state it again
(though I do not think you are seriously trying to understand my
position at this point).

In a post-voucher, post-public school world, NO ONE would be forcing
anyone to attend an elite school. But some will not even have that as
an choice, since they will not be able to afford elite schooling (just
like not everyone can afford shirts from Foley's).

My Wal-mart example was based on the premise that in the last 10-years,
Wal-mart has renegotiated its supply contracts to acquire lower quality
goods with a better return. If public school disappeared, the resulting
void would be filled with low-cost firms who would be driven (as
Wal-mart has been) to control their tuitions by keeping employee
salaries lower than their competitors and finding ways to lower
operating costs.

This is not that difficult a concept.

&lt; But even if someone did want such an
aligator T-shirt, that's fine with me. I don't go round preaching that

everyone should do the same thing.&gt;

Nor do I.

&lt; That would be patronage. &gt;

And how do YOU define patronage? Because every time you say this, I
understand what you are saying less. You are either using a very
strange definition of the word or misusing it.

&lt;If someone
tried to convince me to do so by claiming that Wal-Mart was inferior,
than I would point out that this was either nonsense or libel. &gt;

Stating that Wal-mart offers a lower quality of goods and services than
Foley's is neither nonsense or libel. Get over it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I ask you again to make your case that my statement that Wal-

"/>

&gt; mart offers a lower quality of goods and services than a department
&gt; store like Foley's is libelous or retract your charge.

&lt;You've made all kinds of statements and one is even sillier than the
other. You insinuations that Wal-Mart services were sub-standard are
either nonsense or libelous. &gt;

Actually since you made the initial accusation of libel, I believe the
burden of proof rests on you to prove to me that Wal-mart offers the
same or greater quality of goods and services that Foley's does.

I await this proof, or a retraction of your charge.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You need to prove that my statement is false, that I willfully stated

"/>

&gt; it while knowing it was false, that my words damaged Wal-mart's
&gt; ability to make money in some way, and that I possessed
&gt; malicious intent.

&lt;You take your pick, you probably know better what drives you to make
such remarks. &gt;

You made the charge, and I think you're wrong. The burden of proof is
on you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt; Also, Wal-Mart offers

"/>

&gt; the convenience of doing all your shopping under one roof. &gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And this has exactly what to do with the quality of their goods and

"/>

&gt; services? Why are you shifting the argument?

&lt;Because beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Just like you may
appreciate personal service when buying your furniture, someone else
may prefer to buy furniture quickly, without the harassment of
salespeople, in between other shopping.&gt;

It is still a lower quality of service, regardless of how important
service is to you.

Do you really not see this distinction?

&lt; You seek to elevate your
personal preference to a national standard that you would like to see
imposed on all shops, with the libelous allegation that any other type

of shopping was sub-standard and inferior. &gt;

Actually I do not elevate my preferences, nor have I ever stated my
preferences. Would I prefer to send my child to an elite private
school? Yes, and that's my preference. Will I be able to? Maybe and
maybe not. If so (because I make enough money to pay for it), then I
will get to send my kid to a &quot;Foley's school.&quot; If not (because I don't
make enough money to pay high dollar tuition), then my choices seem to
be limited to a &quot;Wal-mart school,&quot; or no school at all (or perhaps
home-schooling?).

In a market-driven system, choice is only available to those who have
the economic means to make choices available to them. Without enough
money for the high-end option, I have only the low-end option left.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Of course Wal-mart has a &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; approach. That's

"/>

&gt; part of the low-cost strategy. The goal is to offer a higher volume
of
&gt; goods at discounted prices to make up for the lower return per item
&gt; with volume of sales. Which includes constantly driving down
&gt; acquisition or production costs.

&lt;So, do you now agree that Wal-Mart is cheaper not because they were
sub-standard, but because Wal-Mart did a good job in distribution,
buying products in high quantity, selecting certain products, etc. &gt;

Yes, by selecting a lower quality of product that is cheaper to acquire
and distribute. Which is EXACTLY what I've been saying.

You are trying to sew discord where none exists.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;It's hard

"/>

&gt; to say what's better, it's a personal taste for many people,
&gt; depending on their lifestyle, etc. It's something that people should

&gt; decide for themselves, at least that's what I would say.&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; None of these statements have any relevance to whether Wal-mart

"/>

&gt; has a lower level of quality and services than a department store.

&lt;That is precisely the issue! What you call quality is in fact a
personal preference.&gt;

Uh, no. It is a preference to favor lower quality goods, but the
quality of the goods themselves is not a preference.

And those without enough money to choose goods that cost more have
little choice.

&lt; You seek to impose national standards under the
pretence that you knew what was better.&gt;

Well, the ridiculous charges continue. I seek to impose nothing. We
wound up with public school for a set of reasons, and I do not find
those reasons sufficiently lacking to do away with publicly funded
standards of education.

&lt; Ironically, reality shows that
your choice is not the best one for people who cannot afford to buy
their pants from a personal tailor. You seek to drive up prices under
the pretence of &quot;quality&quot;, but in reality you would just be driving up

prices, because the kind of government control you seek simply does
drive up prices. &gt;

Really? So I would be spending less than $0 to send my kid to school if
we get rid of public school?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But you seem to be suggesting that government should set

"/>

&gt;&gt; standards as to how and where we should do our shopping, as
&gt;&gt; well as in education?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

one

&gt; because if most people choose lower quality for increased
&gt; quantity, the risks are less than when we are talking about
&gt; education.

&lt;So, are you now retracting your analogy?&gt;

Nope. I was just saying (again) that children are not consumable goods.

Yes, I did. Wal-mart pursues a low-cost strategy and therefore has had
to lower the quality of their goods and services and cap the salaries
of their employees (to say nothing of not insuring half their
workforce). Which is fine for consumer goods (present controversies and
scandals aside).

These conditions enacted in an educational will result in a decrease in
the ability to attract quality teachers for low-cost schools and a
lower level of resources for educational programming the public schools
currently possess.

&lt; Don't try to worm yourself out of this.
It's all on records here at the group and in my gmail account!&gt;

And in my own posts. Too bad the point is lost on you even now ...

&lt; You did
insinuate that Wal-mart was inferior and sub-standard.&gt;

No, I stated directly that Wal-mart's strategy was to make smaller
profits of their goods in the hopes of making up the cost differential
lost (which stores like Foley's, who make more on any one sale, get by
promoting their quality and reputation). This razor-thin margin has led
Wal-mart to continually seek out cheaper and lower-quality goods in
order to keep prices low and the volume of sales high.

This is a standard management strategy, and Wal-mart is hardly the
first to try it (though they have been perhaps the most successful).
And if education were the same as consumer goods, then I think your
position and mine would not be different. But my value of education for
the largest number of people is higher than my value of simple economic
worth.

Education is more valuable than dollars and I do not believe that the
market is the best place to regulate standards of it for the majority
of our population.

&lt; I do expect you
to retract such libelous statements and to publicly apologize here
unreservedly to Wal-mart and to all Wal-mart customers and employees.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/>

And I do wish you'd back up your charges of libel with PROOF of it.
What I have said is not untrue, is not malicious and does not represent
a willful disregard for truth leading to financial damage.

I have news for you: I have friends who work at Wal-mart and friends
who are distributors who have worked with Wal-mart. Not only do they
not disagree with my assessment, but they see nothing wrong with
Wal-mart behaving this way (well, my distributor friends do, but that's
only because they didn't like being shut out of Wal-mart because their
items cost too much to sell there). Wal-mart openly pursues this
strategy, and it's one of the older strategies in our system.

We have so many famous examples of it, but perhaps the most famous was
Henry Ford's company. When asked to make modifications and improvements
to his vehicles like offering them in different colors, he said &quot;they
can have a car in any color they want ... so long as it's black.&quot;

I think you find offense at statements that reflect the basic
conventional theory from a freshman level business management course.
Maybe if you weren't so busy railing against our institutions of higher
education you'd come to understand that practical concepts like the
various strategies for retail management and marketing are taught and
accepted and used in the marketplace.

Or maybe that libel is a legal tort with specific proofs and defenses,
none of which you have used to build your case.

Or if you insist on building your knowledge outside of the institutions
devoted to collecting and disseminating knowledge, ask a business
manager to explain the low-cost strategy to you sometime and see if you
think it's the strategy Wal-mart has pursued.

Or read up for yourself (simple product differentiation, in this case,
vertical):

It is actually you who have done me wrong, but I do not expect a
retraction or an apology because I don't think you possess enough
understanding of our subject matter to know what you're talking about.
Perhaps this has been a big misunderstanding, but I assure you it is
not an insult to claim that Wal-mart pursues a low-cost strategy or
that as a result, they offer a lower quality of goods and services than
firms pursuing a different strategy (like Foley's).

Sam,

I am trying my hardest to respect you and your opinions. However, it is
clear to me that you do not have grasp of how business management
works nor of how our law works.

Briefly, one last time: Consumers value different things. Some value
quality, some service, some low cost, some prestige, some product
availability and some self-efficacy.

There are a variety of management strategies that have been created to
focus on particular groups' values, emphasizing one area over the
others.

The low-cost strategy is designed to provide a greater sense of value
by focusing on cost and availability. The services take a back seat,
the quality takes a back seat, the prestige takes a back seat and the
search for self-efficacy takes a back seat. Wal-mart has adopted this
strategy. And they do that because their target market is the working
class.

There is a mixed category (several in fact), where firms try to keep
costs relatively low but offer some of the services and quality of the
higher-end strategies. These forms try to fir into the niche above the
lowest-cost competitor, but significantly below the product
differentiation firms. So, you get lower cost (but not the lowest), an
upgrade in quality, an upgrade ins services and a slight bump in
prestige, without trying to compete with the higher strategies. Target
is the exemplar of this strategy, and their target is to mix the upper
end of the working class consumers with the lower ends of the middle
and upper class consumers.

The product differentiation strategy is designed to focus on quality
and prestige to the detriment of low-cost and product availability.
Foley's would be a good example of a firm adopting this strategy. And
they do so because they tend to focus on the upper-middle class
consumer and the upper class itself.

The highest end strategy is designed to focus on prestige and
self-efficacy and service at the severe detriment to low-cost and
product availability (these shopping experiences are designed to be
lavishly expensive for the sake of status and most products are
severely limited to encourage a sense of status). Prada, Mercedes-Benz,
and many of the cutting edge fashion designers fit into the category of
firms who charge LOTS more money, but offer the image and the pampered
services that give shoppers the self-efficacy they desire.

Now, claiming that Wal-mart pursues the strategy that they have adopted
is neither libel nor nonsense, it is simple fact. ALL of these
strategies appeal to their markets. ALL of these strategies created
value for their patrons. But, not all market segments value the same
thing, which was the core of my point.

I suggest you pick up an introductory book on business management or
marketing to get an understanding of how business works in the free
market and then perhaps we'll be able to communicate.

I feel like I've been trying to explain my positions through soccer
metaphors to someone who doesn't like soccer or know anything about it.
I should have found a better analogy and not assumed you understood
market strategy or economics.

As for your continued charge of libel, I won't even bother restating
the definitions, proofs and defenses of libel. You're simply wrong (or
at least have provided no argument for supporting your charge). All I
can do is suggest you take a class or talk to a lawyer before you go
any further making charges that you don't seem to understand.

I'm trying to resolve what I hope is just a misunderstanding and it
would help if you could clarify what you mean by &quot;lower quality of
goods and services&quot;. As you say yourself, consumers value different
things. Some will value personal service, others will prefer a
different shopping experience, e.g. pushing a trolley and taking items
off the shelves themselves.

Isn't this just a differentiation in the type of shopping? And isn't it
up to customers to decide what type of shopping they prefer? Within
these types, some shops will inevitably do a better job than other
shops, which you could refer to as quality service versus inferior
service, but it's it up to the market to decides that? One shop isn't
inherently good, as if another brand was evil, isn;'t it? What exactly
do you mean with &quot;lower quality service&quot;?

Some shops will do better, other shops do worse and go broke. If one
shop delivers bad service compared to a competitor, then it should go
broke. Again, isn't that how the market is supposed to operate?

Any suggestions that Wal-mart was successful because it provided bad
service, is therefore both nonsense and libelous, so I do hope you are
not suggesting this. A shop providing lower quality service cannot
compete with other shops providing higher quality service, perhaps in
some imaginary dreamworld, but not in the hard reality of fierce
business competition.

So, I must assume that this is just a misunderstanding and that you
have simply used a confusing choice of words. At least, I hope it's
just a confusing choice of wording, so please confirm whether or not
this is the case. Once more, isn't it up to customers to decide what
kind of shopping experience they want? You are not seriously suggesting
that Big Brother should consult you personally for your decisive
insight as to what was a quality service and punish offending shops
accordingly?

&lt;I'm trying to resolve what I hope is just a misunderstanding and it
would help if you could clarify what you mean by &quot;lower quality of
goods and services&quot;.&gt;

I am saying that Wal-mart invests less money and infrastructure in the
goods and services they offer than does Foley's. I am saying that if
you buy an entertainment center from Wal-mart, it will cost 1/10th the
price than one from Foley's, but the product itself will naturally be a
lower quality than the Foley's model.

I am not making a claim about what shoppers value or passing judgment
on what they value. I am simply stating that Wal-mart is pursuing a
low-cost strategy, and as such, it behaves accordingly.

&lt; As you say yourself, consumers value different
things. Some will value personal service, others will prefer a
different shopping experience, e.g. pushing a trolley and taking items

off the shelves themselves. &gt;

YES! Which is why there is a place in the market for both Foley's and
Wal-mart. They service different clientele, who value different aspects
of the consumer experience.

&lt;Isn't this just a differentiation in the type of shopping? And isn't
it
up to customers to decide what type of shopping they prefer?&gt;

Yes and Yes. Though my point was that those with reduced income do not
have as much choice. Those below the poverty line cannot afford to buy
their clothes at Foley's. It simply isn't a choice.

&lt; Within
these types, some shops will inevitably do a better job than other
shops, which you could refer to as quality service versus inferior
service, but it's it up to the market to decides that?&gt;

Look, both you and Sam keep assigning labels such as &quot;good,&quot;&quot;bad,&quot;
&quot;inferior,&quot; and other summary evaluations. I have made none of those.

When I compare Wal-mart to Foley's, Wal-mart offer lower quality and
lower prices than Foley's. Foley's customers pay more for the shopping
experience and for an increased quality of goods.

Neither is &quot;good,&quot; neither is &quot;bad.&quot; They service different markets,
because that's how free market economic systems work.

&lt; One shop isn't
inherently good, as if another brand was evil, isn;'t it?&gt;

Of course not, and I have never said either was &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil.&quot;

&lt; What exactly
do you mean with &quot;lower quality service&quot;? &gt;

I mean that Foley's invests more capital in acquiring and delivering
their goods, in maintaining their storefront environment, in paying
more personnel to be available for more service for the customer.

Wal-mart does not invest as much because it doesn't need to (and in
fact, if it did it would have to raise prices). It has the low-cost
advantage. The majority of their clientele is willing to give up
prestige, extra quality, extra levels of service and expensive
storefront experiences in order to receive better discounts on the
acquisitions of their goods.

&lt;Some shops will do better, other shops do worse and go broke.&gt;

But the point is that these shops only compete with the firms who have
adopted similar strategies. Wal-mart and Foley's are not in direct
competition. Foley's and Dillards are. Wal-mart and Target are (though
Target has positioned themselves into a mixed differentiation/low cost
bracket to avoid being wiped out).

Wal-mart makes a little profit on a high volume of sales. Foley's makes
a lot more profit on a much lower number of sales. They are pursuing
different goals and so have adopted different strategies to meet those
goals.

&lt; If one
shop delivers bad service compared to a competitor, then it should go
broke. Again, isn't that how the market is supposed to operate? &gt;

But economics are about measuring behavior, and different humans value
different things and react differently. That's why the four main
theories of business management exist: four different combinations of
the major values seem to consistently find niches in every market where
there is access by broad consumer bases.

Marketing plays a HUGE role in both economics and consumer behavior.
The market is rarely about what IS, but what people BELIEVE is.

Microsoft rarely put out a product that was a better quality than the
products it was competing with, but Microsoft is a genius firm when it
comes to marketing. Despite most of their products being initially
rated lower by performance testers, Microsoft always wins because of
the power of their name brand and the customer faith that comes with
it. And because they bundle their packages together in ways that appear
to save you either money or convenience or both. And it works for them
and the consumer.

Quality is not always the dominant value in the consumer's mind.

&lt;Any suggestions that Wal-mart was successful because it provided bad
service, is therefore both nonsense and libelous, so I do hope you are

not suggesting this. &gt;

You and Sam keep putting the word &quot;bad&quot; in my mouth. Read back over my
posts, I never said this.

(And I still maintain that you are both demonstrating a frightening
level of ignorance concerning what libel is or what burden of proof is
placed on the accuser of it).

I said that low-cost competitors drive down prices by slashing quality
and infrastructure. Of course they won't slash it lower than the
consumer is willing to allow (unless the consumer has no choice but to
purchase the goods somewhere).

&lt;A shop providing lower quality service cannot
compete with other shops providing higher quality service, perhaps in
some imaginary dreamworld, but not in the hard reality of fierce
business competition. &gt;

Yes they can. They simply pursue a low-cost strategy and bank that in
their market people will be willing to be more interesting in saving
money than those other values.

Again, this is all material from any low-level university business
class. I realize we have not all been exposed to the same training, but
reading the business pages of the Wall Street Journal will expose you
to all of these strategies and the dozens of mixed strategies in
between the main theories.

&lt;So, I must assume that this is just a misunderstanding and that you
have simply used a confusing choice of words.&gt;

Perhaps, though I suspect any undergraduate business student (or any
student who has had a management class) would understand perfectly what
I've been saying without all this over-explanation.

Perhaps I should have used a baseball analogy instead? About how not
every team can be the Yankees, and the Kansas City Royals will never
win a pennant? And how this is natural for and fine for the economics
of baseball, but if we're talking about children I think it's wrong not
to promote standards to level the competitive playing field between the
teams? How the NFL solved this problem by regulating the terms of team
ownership, imposing salary caps and standards of player treatment?

&lt; At least, I hope it's
just a confusing choice of wording, so please confirm whether or not
this is the case. Once more, isn't it up to customers to decide what
kind of shopping experience they want?&gt;

Yes, but you have to see that people with less money have less choice.
Money is the fuel that makes choice go.

Vouchers give wealthy people and the middle class more choices. And for
some of the unfortunate lower-class students who show enough promise to
escape their fate, vouchers can be a welcome escape from a failing
public school.

But for most of the poor, who cannot afford to differentiate between
the quality of life in their consumer choices, there will be few
choices when it comes to spending money on school. They will have to
settle for the cheapest alternative, just as they do in automobiles,
groceries, healthcare and most of their other consumer decisions.

&lt; You are not seriously suggesting
that Big Brother should consult you personally for your decisive
insight as to what was a quality service and punish offending shops
accordingly? &gt;

No, I have repeatedly said that the consumer goods market is entirely
fine the way it is. I have no problem with people buying cheaper items
of lower quality since those items will meet the basic needs of those
who shop there.

But education is different. The quality of a person's education is the
key to that person's potential contribution to society. And I do not
favor the prospect of risking the lowering the quality of education for
the lower classes just to benefit a few lucky souls.

I understand why people favor vouchers. When it's YOUR kid, you want
more opportunities. But I am idealistic about watching out for the
other kids in the neighborhood. My child will be well-educated because
I will see to it that he or she has whatever resources they need for
their schooling needs, but I don't want him or her to be the exception
to the rule in our neighborhood.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt; what you mean by &quot;lower quality of goods and services&quot;&gt;

&gt; I am saying that Wal-mart invests less money and
&gt; infrastructure in the goods and services they offer than does
&gt; Foley's.

"/>

Surely, you must be incorrect. Wal-mart spends many times what Foley's
spends on infrastructure.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I am saying that if you buy an entertainment center from Wal-
&gt; mart, it will cost 1/10th the price than one from Foley's, but
&gt; the product itself will naturally be a lower quality than the
&gt; Foley's model.

"/>

If you buy a CD at Wal-mart, surely you are not suggesting that there
was a quality difference? Are you perhaps confusing features with
quality? Typically, a product with less features will cost less,
whether it's in Wal-mart or in Foley's. But for comparable products,
Wal-mart will be cheaper, NOT because there was something wrong with
the quality of the product, but for all kinds of reasons, such as the
scale Wal-mart buys in products, the higher turn-over, etc. Again,
that doesn't mean that the product was of lower quality. You seem to
be confusing a number of things.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I am not making a claim about what shoppers value or
&gt; passing judgment on what they value. I am simply stating
&gt; that Wal-mart is pursuing a low-cost strategy, and as such,
&gt; it behaves accordingly.

"/>

Indeed, low costs results in low prices. Whatever way Wal-mart
&quot;behaves&quot;, It seems that their consumers value that kind of service
and would even refer to it as excellent service! By referring to this
as low-quality service, you mke it look as if there was something
wrong with that. Therefore, I have to ask you again, can you now
confirm that there was nothing wrong with Wal-mart's services and
products. I suggest that you clear up this issue, because insisting
that Wal-mart provided low quality service isn't making you look good.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt; As you say yourself, consumers value different
&gt; things. Some will value personal service, others will prefer a
&gt; different shopping experience, e.g. pushing a trolley and
&gt; taking items off the shelves themselves. &gt;

&gt; YES! Which is why there is a place in the market for both
&gt; Foley's and Wal-mart. They service different clientele, who
&gt; value different aspects of the consumer experience.

"/>

Some people may even visit both places. They may go to Foley's for
advice and then buy their stuff at Wal-mart. :)
But the point is that you shouldn't dictate to people where they
choose to do their shopping. The same would apply to educational
services. If people get vouchers, then they should decide which school
they want to go to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;Isn't this just a differentiation in the type of shopping? And
&gt; isn't it up to customers to decide what type of shopping they
&gt; prefer?&gt;

&gt; Yes and Yes. Though my point was that those with reduced
&gt; income do not have as much choice. Those below the
&gt; poverty line cannot afford to buy their clothes at Foley's. It
&gt; simply isn't a choice.

"/>

That may be the case, but that doesn't imply that Wal-mart provided
sub-standard products and services. Just confirm that, and we can go
back to discuss educational issues.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Look, both you and Sam keep assigning labels such
&gt; as &quot;good,&quot;&quot;bad,&quot;&quot;inferior,&quot; and other summary evaluations. I
&gt; have made none of those.

"/>

You say one thing....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; When I compare Wal-mart to Foley's, Wal-mart offer lower
&gt; quality and lower prices than Foley's. Foley's customers pay
&gt; more for the shopping experience and for an increased
&gt; quality of goods.

"/>

and then you say another. Just because something is cheaper doesn't
necessarily mean it's low quality or that it was low quality service.
Why don't you stop using wording that seems to be deliberately
confusing?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Neither is &quot;good,&quot; neither is &quot;bad.&quot; They service different
&gt; markets, because that's how free market economic systems
&gt; work.

"/>

Different, yes, but you seem to persist associating one shop with low
quality products and services. Why are you seeking to deliberately
confuse things, if you are well aware that this isn't helpful? Is this
a kind of game for you? If that's the way you seek to educate young
students, then I would object as parent, because I would see that as
an unacceptable quality of educational service. It looks like you seek
to deliberately mislead people and then hiding behind the meaning of a
word, as if you meant something else. It's basically dishonest.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt; One shop isn't inherently good, as if another brand was evil, isn;'t it?&gt;

&gt; Of course not, and I have never said either was &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil.&quot;

"/>

Yet, you say it's lower quality.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt; What exactly do you mean with &quot;lower quality service&quot;? &gt;

&gt; I mean that Foley's invests more capital in acquiring and
&gt; delivering their goods, in maintaining their storefront
&gt; environment, in paying more personnel to be available for
&gt; more service for the customer.

"/>

I'm sure Wal-mart spend many times as much Foley's spends on
buildings, distributing, etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Wal-mart does not invest as much because it doesn't need
&gt; to (and in fact, if it did it would have to raise prices). It has
&gt; the low-cost advantage. The majority of their clientele is
&gt; willing to give up prestige, extra quality, extra levels of
&gt; service and expensive storefront experiences in order to
&gt; receive better discounts on the acquisitions of their goods.

"/>

What extra quality? A storefront? That has little to do with the
quality of the product on sale, hasn't it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;Some shops will do better, other shops do worse and go broke.&gt;

&gt; But the point is that these shops only compete with the firms
&gt; who have adopted similar strategies. Wal-mart and Foley's
&gt; are not in direct competition. Foley's and Dillards are. Wal-
&gt; mart and Target are (though Target has positioned
&gt; themselves into a mixed differentiation/low cost
&gt; bracket to avoid being wiped out).

"/>

Sure, they're different types of shops, but you cannot say that one
was better than the other, that's up to customers to decide. If you
use wording like &quot;lower quality service&quot;, it appears that you make a
judgment regarding the quality of their service. Why do you persist
with that? Why seek to confuse things?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Wal-mart makes a little profit on a high volume of sales.
&gt; Foley's makes a lot more profit on a much lower number of

Yes, but that doesn't mean that one was better than the other. Yet, by
using the words, &quot;lower quality service&quot;, you seem to be implying that
this was the case. Why do you refuse to clear up this issue. I'm
trying to help you by suggesting this was a misunderstanding, and you
just keep digging yourself deeper into the hole you made for yourself.

Indeed, so you admit that the expensive storefront of Foley's that you
mentioned earlier was just a farce? Just like the architecture of many
universities was meant to impress people, to make it look like an
expensive building, as if this guaranteed that the educational service
was therefore high quality? And you now step out of the closet as an
apologist for this masquarade? Why not let people decide, rather than
to dictate to them something that you portray as a standard, but that
turns out to be just a personal, political view?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's why there have been anti-trust cases against Microsoft and I'm

hand seek to keep education outside the same scrutiny of trade
practices law.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Deborah, I seriously suggest you take a primer in business management,
either in the form of a university class or some kind of seminar.

Or, buy an entertainment center from Wal-mart and another from Foley's
and set them side-by-side in your living room and then explain how the
particle board is the same level of quality as the wood.

I communicate with dozens of people every day about many different
topics, and I assure you that my words are rarely found confusing.

I cannot believe how obtuse you are at times. I only hope in your
offline life that people don't find you this frustrating to talk to.

You are right in your conclusions, Deborah! Some people make no sense
and they have no sense of what quality is. From an educational
perspective it shouldn't matter what kind of entertainment system is
used to play an informative video, as it's the content that matters.
And indeed, some of the ivy league universities seem more interested
in keeping up a facade of expensive buildings, rather than to invest
in content that they offer to students. Similarly, public schools have
created ugly monstrosities that inflict all kinds of evil on society
under the pretence of education. How to fix this? Dress students in
thousand-dollar uniforms and they will not be more educated. It's time
we start getting serious about education and kick out the
government-imposed indoctrination that portrays itself as education.

Sam, I think that enough has been said on Wal-mart and that messages
are getting repetitive; instead, let's focus on the educational
questions. I'll start a new topic on vouchers. Perhaps we can start
another topic on shopping trends in future, but for now I think we've
explored this sufficiently to make the various points on this topic.
