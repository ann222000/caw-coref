*Healing Our Bodies*
*Touch*

Sometimes we might concentrate so much on our spiritual lives that we
overlook the wonders of being present in our physical form. When we are more
aware of the fact that our bodies are also important in terms of our
personal growth, we may find it easier to nurture them. One of the most
powerful ways to do this is through human touch, for a loving, comforting
touch allows us to access the part of ourselves that yearns for a sense of
oneness with the world around us. Even simple forms of touch connect us not
just to our bodies but also to the energetic presence of other people.

There are so many ways to incorporate touch in our daily lives, one of the
easiest being a heartfelt embrace. Just making a point to hug someone on a
daily basis and really feel our energy pass between each other can
strengthen the bonds that keep us together. Hugs help us heal any hurt or
upset we may have recently experienced by letting us release into the moment
of the embrace and realize that no matter what happens to us, we have
someone in our lives who supports and cares for us.

Another nourishing form of touch is massage. While we may think of massage
as a luxury, it is actually an ancient form of healing that enables us to
open up our energetic pathways in order to receive unlimited energy from the
universe. It doesn't matter whether a simple massage comes from a loved one
or a massage therapist, but by giving ourselves the gift of massage every
once in a while, we are doing something healthy and beneficial for our
bodies. Massage helps our bodies activate their own restorative powers,
creating a wonderful way to engage fully in our own healing.

Letting ourselves take advantage of the healing nature of touch creates
space where we can truly live in and experience the world through our
bodies, allowing us to completely immerse ourselves in the loving sense of
joy and wonder that is our life.
