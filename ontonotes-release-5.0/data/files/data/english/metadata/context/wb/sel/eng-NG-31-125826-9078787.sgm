&quot;Fine paid anonymously for mother tied to 'unfairly' clamped car - but
she STILL refuses to move

An angry mother-of-three who chained herself to the inside of her car
as a protest to being clamped has vowed to remain despite the clamp
being removed when the fees were anonymously paid.

Lisa Martin is demanding an apology from the clamping company and will
remain in her car for a second night until she gets one...&quot;

You obviously can't since you post endless questions but fail to respond to
other people's, excpt to call them liars and/or hypocrites.

Lots of people, other than motorists, describe those who protest and are
lacking personal hygiene as 'unwashed protesters'. Are yo suggesting they're

Do you mean :

The woman that was denied the use of her car because it was clamped.

or

The landowner that was denied the use of his land because she parked
on it.

Hey, lugless Douglas.

That article is shite.  Private clampers cannot issue fines.

In the picture showing the parking area there is no sign of any notice
drawing attention to the charges. (that's not to say there couldn't
have been one out of shot) and the bay she is parked in appears to
abutt directly onto a public road.

I'd say she might well have a point.

I read a better source with the full story. Silly bitch parked in an
&quot;Employees Only&quot; parking space to nip off and do a bit of shopping.
Seems she knew it was as well.

Wrong. They don't pay nearly enough to cover all the harm they cause
to people and the planet. Motorists are allowed to kill and injure
people with relative impunity, allowed to seriously pollute and
congest, are allowed to street garage their cars 24/7 on public roads
for free, and a majority are free to get away with lawbreaking on a
massive scale.

You don't know what harm motorists cause to the planet, you just cut and
paste from the Daily Wail any anti-motorist story you can rake up.   You
can't show with any conviction that motorists are treated leniently
because people on the bench may be motorists too, it's just another of
your fanciful claims, as for &quot;street garaging, it breaks no law, whereas
your cycling on the pavement does.   Further human beings are omnivores,
we are designed to eat meat and as there is a lot of land that is not
arable it makes sense to use it for cattle to graze and provide food for
many, whereas your wholly unnatural lifestyle requiring food products to
be shipped in from all over the globe to support you crazy ideas
increases your carbon footprint most probably beyond that of the worst
of the 4X4 user that you take so much pleasure in berating.   You are
beneath even the word you so often use of everyone else, hypocrite.
Your implied claims that CO2 production by humans alone is laughable,
even the most stupid amongst us can see that if we burn eco-mass or oil
made from it, we are only returning to the atmosphere that which has
been sequestered in the previous year.   You truly are an ignorant
little man.

&gt;&gt; Why not?   Motorists already pay enough in all the various taxes etc.

&gt; Wrong. They don't pay nearly enough to cover all the harm they cause
&gt; to people and the planet. Motorists are allowed to kill and injure
&gt; people with relative impunity, allowed to seriously pollute and
&gt; congest, are allowed to street garage their cars 24/7 on public roads
&gt; for free, and a majority are free to get away with lawbreaking on a
&gt; massive scale.

Has it occured to you that if there were no motorists, then there would be
no roads. So the roads that the motorists park on for free, were probably
built for &amp; because of them.
