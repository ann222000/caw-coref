Hi,

I'm considering buying a ALFA SportsWagon (with the facelift) but I'm
a little nervous about buying a car that's not beeing build anymore
(from the factory) at least not from august.

Will the price fall drastic in a year (of couse no one can tell for
sure, but maybe some of you have some experience in that field).

TIA

MJ

It all depends on how long you're planning on keeping it for - MkI 156s
are likely to become collectable given time.

However, I have a feeling that the original design pre-facelift will be
the most sought after.

Look at it this way:
As soon as the 159 is on the market there will be a lot of very good deals
to be made on new 156's still on stock.
Normally discounts up to 20-25%
So what you don't spend doesn't depreciate ;-)
And, the 156SW has "matured" over the 5 years it has been on the market, so
very little problems to be expected.
On a new car like the 159 you always have some (minor) problems in the first
1-2 years.
But, a 159 will have all state of the art features (goody, goody.....) the
156 doesn't have ;-(
The market being as it is now and in many years to come, a SW absolutely
keeps its value better than the saloons.
But I guess they will depreciate faster as soon as the 159 SW come on the
market 2nd hand in a year or 3
Don't know any official figures outside Holland, but I traded in my 156 SW
last February (4½ years old and 140.000km - 85.000miles) at 50% of the new
price.
