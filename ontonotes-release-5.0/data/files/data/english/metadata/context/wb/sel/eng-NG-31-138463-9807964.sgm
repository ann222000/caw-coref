I am in one of the pilot areas for the new.familysearch.org.  We were
taught about it several weeks ago, and told that we could start using
it October 22nd.

We were told to go to www.new.familysearch.org .  But that doesn't go
anywhere on my computer.  Is there a different site for the
new.familysearch.org website?

Don't put the www on the front. Just use new.familysearch.org, not
www.new.familysearch.org .

I am supposed to be doing a beta test for Ancestral Quest to help their genealogy software become compatible with newFamilySearch.  I do not live in a temple district that has newFamilySearch.  We were asked a couple of weeks ago to send them our membership number and confirmation date.  Then, as of about last Thursday, they notified me that I could sign in, not at the real newFamilySearch site, but at a beta site:

https://beta.familysearch.org &lt; https://beta.familysearch.org/ &gt;   If they have not given your data to the church, you will not be able to sign in.  They said, &quot;As you test, remember that the beta test system looks almost identical to the new FamilySearch, so be careful not to mix them up. Make sure you are at
http://beta.familysearch.org &lt; http://beta.familysearch.org/ &gt; when you are registering. When you want to use the real system, go to https://new.familysearch.org &lt; https://new.familysearch.org/ &gt;.  The data in https://beta.familysearch.org &lt; https://beta.familysearch.org/ &gt; will be deleted at the end of the test. The data at https://new.familysearch.org &lt; https://new.familysearch.org/ &gt; will be visible to others and kept permanently.&quot;  They also have not yet gotten the software to me to test that we were supposed to have several days ago; as they are getting some bugs worked out.  They said we could go into https://beta.familysearch.org &lt; https://beta.familysearch.org/ &gt; and look around, but we should not make any changes yet, as then we would not be able to do them for the beta test.

If you haven't heard anything from the people you are supposed to be doing the beta for, I would write them back at this point.

I am supposed to be testing the FamilyInsight. They are also telling me that
they don't have the program ready. I guess everyone is having some problem
getting the interface to work properly.

I have a couple of questions for those of you using new Familysearch.

I am in Utah so will not have NFS for a long time, but I am being allowed to beta test Ancestral Quest's software using a beta edition of NFS.  So I have not had the training they give you before using it.

1.  Is there a faster way to move through your pedigree than clicking the arrow on the right side of the pedigree?  Using the search tab on top seems to find records, but not those necessarily connected with your pedigree at this time.

2.  A lot of my ancestors are shown with first name only on the pedigree.  After combining records that have the last name, still only the first name is shown. Is there some way to change this?

I have been using nFS for a few months now and hope I can answer your
questions.

1) There are several ways to move through pedigrees:
a) As you have stated it is slow to move by using the arrows to the right of
the names. This only moves one generation at a time.
b) There are small arrows to the left of each name, next to the sex image.
Clicking on this arrow moves this person to the primary location. This
allows you to move up to 2 generations at a time.
c) Go to the Change View tab at the top left side of the screen. Switch from
Pedigree with Details to the Pedigree view. This will allow you to see more
generations at a time along with their children. Use the same arrows to move
between generations. You can move 3-4 generations at a time on this screen

2) Only the first name appears eventhough multiple complete names may be
listed as duplicates. There are some theories on this but I can tell you
right now that nFS choses which name to display and as long as the incorrect
name is listed at the top of the duplicates list it will show up as the name
on the pedigree. Can you get it to move? Yes but not always. Sometimes if
you dispute it the next name on the list will show up in the pedigree.
Sometimes if you merge the names differently it will force the first name
only lower on the list. But these are not guaranteed to work every time. For
right now we just have to live with this little glitch and hope that the
next version fixes it. I would suggest that you send feedback on this and
ask them to allow us to chose which names/data show up as primary on the
pedigree.

Hope this helps. By the way, I have a small training manual at
http://milesmeyer.googlepages.com/ if you want to download it.

To add to what Miles has told you, I am posting the response I
received through feedback on nFS:

&quot;Combining is not like merging in PAF where you had to pick one value
for each data item. It is more like gathering up all the data
contained in each record and putting it into one record. What you
normally see when you have individual details showing is a summary of
the information contained in that record. If you click View or add
details, you can see all of the data that has been contributed to the
combined record. In some cases, the record chosen is the one you
considered &quot;wrong.&quot; Here is the order in which the name is picked:

1. If you added an opinion by editing the name, your version comes to
the top, but only for you.

2. If you have not added an opinion but there is a Church membership
record, it prevails.

3. If you have not added an opinion and there is not a Church
membership record, it takes the name that is alphabetically first.

If you add an opinion, it will show your way to you, but will show to
everyone else what you saw before you added an opinion.

You add an opinion by displaying the Individual Details and then
clicking the underlined word Edit to the right of the person's name;
then you change the name in the small window near the top. If you
change it to one of the names already on one of the records, it will
move to the top and show multiple contributors. If you change to a
totally different name, your name will show as the contributor&quot;

Note that option 3 says that the default is whichever name is
ALPHABETICALLY FIRST.  Apparently no surname trumps any surname, which
is why the version with no surname comes up.  But as it says above, if
you want the correct version of the name to appear on YOUR COMPUTER,
click edit and add an opinion and type the name as you want it to
appear.  Then YOU will see the  correct name (but other people will
not.)

I am using newFamilySearch as a beta tester for Ancestral quest.  There are many instances on my line where a duplicate individuals are shown as siblings.  In at least one instance, the child died before the age of 8.  One of the duplicates does not have the death date, thus it shows that temple work needs to be done.  When I click on the individual who has the best info, and ask it to show duplicates, it shows there are no duplicates.  Does anyone know how to merge them?

This is quite easy. First select one of the siblings then click on the
parents and siblings tab. This should show all of the children with the
parents. You will notice that the duplicate children are listed here. To the
left of each name is a small down arrow. Click on the arrow and a pull down
box appears. At the bottom of this pull down box is Combine Siblings. Click
on that and then select the siblings you want to combine. Sometimes this box
disappears if you move the mouse too quickly so it may take a few tries. The
duplicate siblings get added to the file after you merge families that have
the children attached to them. Hope this helps.

When you are on the parents and siblings screen or the spouse and
children screen which shows the duplicate children, just to the left
of each child's name is a small down arrow.  Click that and you will
be given some options about deleting and disputing and at the bottom
of the list is an option that says &quot;combine with other siblings.&quot;
Select that and you will be shown a list with all the other siblings
of the same gender.  Choose the duplicate(s) and that will allow you
to compare and combine them.  You cannot combine children with
different gender designations.

Thanks so much Miles.  It is a little disheartening to see all the errors it took me so long to ferret out of my PAF files all appear over and over again in New Family Search magnified x40.  When temple districts are trained for NFS; do they emphasize not running out and doing the temple work until you have carefully combined records?

Everyone should have gone through the steps for combining duplicates before
they print out the temple page. It is only two steps. Check for possible
duplicates by clicking on the tab to the left of the screen. Once you have
combined these then at the bottom of the duplicat check screen you will see
a search for duplicates link. This does another check and gives you
additional possible duplicates that you need to review. Once you have done
that you can go the toe temple ready part and get the names ready for
submission. Once they have been selected no one else will be able to send
this name to the temple.
