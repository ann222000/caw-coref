recently, ann coulter was caught up in some controversy because she
used the word 'fag' to describe john edwards.  she may have been
thinking of the gayish pretending character played by john ritter in
three's company. edwards has the same kind of pussyboy wimperishness.

anyway, many have condemned coulter for using a slur. now, i agree
that 'faggot' is a slur and should be shunned by respectable folks.
but, she can be defended for the use of the term on two grounds. one
as a reaction to the overreaction against isiah washington's use of
the term during the emmy awards.  while it was in bad taste, what took
place afterwards was a ridiculous kind of witchhunt mentality and
action.  washington, in order to salvage his career, had to apologize
profusely--embarassing especially for a negro dude--and then enter
into counseling to root the source of his 'evil' sentiments.  i
mean... come on.  It's natural to make fun of gay people cuz gay
people are funny and ridiculous.
Washington wasn't suffering from some deeply buried psychological
sickness. He was just being his natural self which finds gay stuff
funny and ridiculous.
Of course, he didn't have to use a slur, but he was saying gay stuff
is funny. No big harm there.
Why is it called 'homophobic' to ridicule homos when  it's okay to
make fun of hillbillies, Italians, Asians, etc, etc.   Is someone a
polophobe for making polack jokes?  Finding certain people funny or
ridiculous is not a case  of phobia. And, gay people go out of their
ways to act ridiculous.  Yet, we are told over and over that making
fun of gays is phobic or homophobic. So, if a movie cracks a gay joke,
it's homophobic.  Is woody allen jewophobic because he makes fun of
his own people?
We are not phobic.  Indeed, most of us are homorids, not homophobes.
By homo-ridia, I mean we find homosexuality and homosexual behavior
ridiculous and funny and silly.   Surely, you've seen some gay guys
act really tutti fruity and such.  We are homoridic, not homophobic.
We find a lot of stuff ridiculous and for good reason.

while 'faggot' is a nasty word and shouldn't be used by respectable
folks, it's understandable why it is used often as a term of
derision.  men have a sense of manliness, and pewaothigs(people who
are, among other things, gay) act in a very unmanly manner.  many act
like women, and it looks hilarious when you see guys carry on in such
manner. as they are NOT women, the discrepancy between what they are
biologically and what they pretend to be socially makes it all the
more funny. so, finding gay behavior funny is not abnormal. it's
normal.  humor derives from the perception of abnormality, and
pewaothigs take the cake when it comes to abnormal behavior.  they not
only act tinkerbellish but boof eachother in the ass.  some wear
women's underwear and bras.  i mean this is funny, so when pewaothigs
demand that we see them as anyone else, it goes against our human
nature.  when we see abnormal stuff, we laugh.  what the hell else are
we supposed to do? of course, what seems normal to one people may seem
abnormal to others.   one can say that our society is dominated by
oppressive hetero-normativeness.  but, this isn't so much a social or
political reality as a biological and psychological one.  most of us
were born to be hetero and as such, we naturally find gay stuff funny
as hell--and repulsive when it involves sticking a sexual organ up an
excretory organ.
of course, we should all try to understand that sense of normality
changes over time, from culture to culture, and much of it depends on
who sets the standards. today, much of our academia and media and arts
are run by liberals, leftists--many of whom are radical jews--, and
pewaothigs. having control over the culture and influential
institutions, they are trying to make gayness normal.  and among the
impressionable young who pick up values based on 'coolness' ,
'hipness' , 'popularity' , and 'celebrityness', gayness-as-norm is
catching on thru popular music, tv shows, and movies like 'brokeback
mountain'.
but, this changing attitude toward gays is not natural but culturally
induced or socially engineered. deep inside the heart and mind of
almost every hetero person is a natural negative reaction to gay
behavior.   a hetero teenager may become pro-gay due to his teachers,
tv shows, and movies, but at most he can learn to tolerate gays. he
cannot really be convinced that gayness is just as normal or decent as
hetero-ness. now, he may consciously think so because he's been taught
that thinking otherwise would mean that he's a 'homophobe', a creature
who's uncool among the glamorous cool people in hollywood and music
industry and a creature deemed suffering from a mental illness
according to scientists in social psychology.  impressionable teens
fall for this stuff. there are two kinds of peer pressures.  there is
pressure from one's own immediate peers, and among these people
there's more honesty, spontaneity, and directness. but, there is the
imaginary peer pressure-glam peer pressure--of the cool glamorous
people that the teen aspires to be with.  so, every teen is friends
with his friends in actual reality and friends with celebrities in
fantasy reality. and the latter may be more powerful. and, the latter
affects great many teens, in which case actual peer pressure becomes
synonmymous with glam peer pressure. and this is what has happened
with gayness.
there was a time when most actual peers used terms like 'gay' or
'faggot' with derision.  to say that something was 'gay' was to say it
was bogus, lacking in substance, bullshi*. now, 'gay' means something
wonderful and noble. and to say 'faggot' means you're a 'homophobe', a
despised enemy of cool glamorous actors and pop stars and someone
deemed mentally sick by the psychological community.
pewaothigs have also gained from what might be called solondnzism.
solondnzism is taken from the filmmaker 'todd solondnz' who made such
films as 'welcome to the doll house', 'palindromes', and 'happiness'.
in all these movies, we see pathetic losers, outcasts, morons, jerks,
gorks, and etc.  these people wanna be good looking, rich, cool, etc,
etc. but, they are all a bunch of pathetic losers.  solondnz's point
is that most of us are really like this. and as such, we must be ultra-
inclusive cuz if we reject other people for their loserdom, we are
only rejecting ourselves cuz we are most likely losers too.  only a
few people are smart, few are beautiful, and only a very few are smart
and beautiful.  most of us are misshapen, fat, ugly, stupid,
wankerish, etc, etc, etc.   so, when you go to a website like
myspace.com, you see this phenomenon.  you see millions and millions
of geeks and losers from all over the world.  they wanna be
celebrities and stars but they are just nobodies and losers. yet, they
wanna feel they belong to a community, wanna feel accepted and loved.
and the best way to do this is to reject all standards of beauty,
talent, smarts, and make everyone your 'friend'.  indeed, the concept
of 'friendship' has become totally debased thru such sites.  you
collect 'friends' at myspace like an homeless person picks up empty
cans at a park.
so, in a world where everyone wants to feel loved and accepted, the
best policy is to accept and love EVERYONE yourself.  this way, if you
love all the others, all the others must love you.
now, someone may say this is selfless understanding and expansion of
global love, but it's really self-serving. you're accepting others
indiscriminately because you yourself want to be accepted
indiscriminately.  it's like 'magnolia' by pt anderson where the
audience watches a bunch of losers and feels sorry for them not so
much because they are OTHER people but because they represent or
reflect YOUR problem. so, when you boo hoo cwy over one of the
characters, you're really crying for your own loserdom, crying to be
loved and hugged.  while 'magnolia' is a well-made movie, it's
emotional impact is little different than in latin-american soap
operas where you see the sad stories of others as reflected
'tragedies' of your own life.  or rather, it's a way to aggrandize the
mundane problems of your humdrum life into stuff of epic emotional sob-
story tragedies.
anyway, whatever you call it--solondnzism or andersonism--it's not
real mutual respect or understanding. it's really self-serving
mutuality and extinction of standards so that EVERYONE can feel cool,
loved, embraced, forgiven, and so on.
it's like a community of artists where most people suck but are so
eager for praise and flattery that they praise others, expecting to be
praised in turn.  well, this may indeed be good social form and
considerate and so on, but it's not honest.
it's like a bunch of ugly girls getting together and calling eachother
beautiful. indeed, don't fat ugly feminists do this all the time?
'sisterhood is beautiful' and 'we are all beautiful' when in fact,
most of them are fat, ugly, disgusting dogs who couldn't attract a
male warthog.
this is why john simon was a necessary critic. not because he was
always right--indeed, i believe he was often wrong about movies--but
because he had the honesty and integrity to call it like it is.  he
even harshly criticized the works of his personal friends. no favors
from john.  this may have made him alot of enemies and such, but he
was honest. and one can admire guys like gore vidal for the same
reason. there is something more than ideology and such. whether you
agree or disagree with vidal, you know he's being honest in the way he
knows how.
and, both have and maintain standards.

anyway, we live in a strange time which is both heavily populist and
heavily elitist. by elitism, i don't mean intellectualism or class
snobberism.  i mean celebrityism.  culturally, our celebs are the new
elites. they are the glamorous, beautiful, exciting, etc, etc.  or,
they may be artists who, though not beautiful or glamorous, are
supposed to be so brilliant, so full of genius, and cosmic truths.
just consider the way in which her fans bow at the feet of tori amos.
so, we have a society where everyone wants to cool and popular. yet,
everyone wants to be cool and popular not as they really are but as
they wanna be--quasi-celebrities. so, in myspace.com, you have so many
scantily clad girls posing as fashion models, movie stars, music
stars.  you have so many guys who upload idiot music aspiring to be
pink floyd-ish, dylan-ish, lennon-ish, etc.  or, so many bogon morons
pretending to be next greil marcus, Andrew sarris, Camille paglia, or
Edward said.
there is populism in the desire of everyone to be part of the cool
community. but, most cannot accept themselves as they really are.  the
reasonably good looking ones pretend to be like angelina jolie or brad
pitt. the hopelessly ugly ones put on the angry-rebel-artist-posture
as the new tori amos, Sylvia plath,  or some such.  in either case,
it's nobodies desperate to be somebodies. and everyone understands
that in order to be accepted by more 'friends', they too must accept
more 'friends' themselves.   there isn't a shred of integrity or
honesty in all this. it's friendship and acceptance turned into some
kind of interchangeable commodity.  it's like, "hey, i think your
stupid moronic song is really really cool and profound and out of this
world, so how about you say that may fat smelly ass is the sexiest
butt in the world?"

anyway, this cultural phenomenon called solondnzism partly explains
why more and more kids are warming up to gayness.  the logic goes like
this: gays are outsiders and considered as losers by society. i am a
loser too, like one of the characters in pt anderson or todd solondnz
movies. if a loser like myself wants to be accepted and loved by
society, then i should love other losers and outsiders--gays.
Of course, none of this has to do with any honesty or integrity. it's
all self-pitying, self-serving bullshi*.

but, just as important or more important is understanding how ideas
and information becomes disseminated in our society.  we must ask who
shapes our terminology and who spreads it around.  one of the reason
for the rise of homosexual acceptance is the term 'homophobia'.
the term is of dubious meaning, at least in the way it is used.  i
believe there is real homophobia in the sense that some people may
have an extreme and irrational fear of homosexuality or gay people.
phobia is an extreme irrational fear of something that poses little or
no harm to the person who suffers from the phobia.  for example, a
little mouse or a roach poses no physical harm to a person, yet the
person could freak out at the sight of such.
similarly, someone who's in a room with a homo may break into a sweat
or wanna vomit or feel very sick even though the gay person isn't
trying to anything particularly gay.  i can understand someone getting
sick if the gay pulled his pants down and stuck his ass out and said,
'fuc* me in the ass'. but, some people do freak out even at the mere
sight or thought of a gay person. this is a genuine phobia.  but, this
kind of phobia is truly rare. for the most part, people mind their own
business, don't care to know if someone is gay or not. and even when
they know someone is gay, they don't mind as long as the gay minds his
own business.
but, the concept of 'homophobia' is being used for political purposes
to push cultural and social agendas.  it is a witchhunt term. it
labels anyone a 'homophobe' who disagrees or opposes the gay agenda.
so, if you oppose 'gay marriage', you must be a homophobe; as far as
the gay agenda people are concerned, there can be NO rational or
sensible reason for opposing gay marriage.  you must be suffering from
a phobia.
or, let's say you don't wanna room with a gay guy in college because
he acts so tutti-frutti which is annoying as hell or because you don't
wanna be in a room where the roommate could be fantasizing about
fuc*ing you in the ass.   how is this homophobic?  in a shared space,
you may sometimes have to take your clothes off.  what if you don't
want a gay guy in the same room when you're doing this?   in colleges,
girls and boys are separated in dorms by sex.  and, no girl or boy
would be forced to share same room with opposite sex even in coed
dorms or be called a girlophobe or a guyophobe if he or she wanted to
room with someone of the same sex.    it's understandable that a girl
may not want to sleep in a room with a guy, or change her clothes in
front of a boy roommate. this isn't male-o-phobia. it's just how the
way she feels.
it's the same with gays.  gays may be male, but they are mentally
female. they are physically of one sex but psychologically of the
opposite sex.  and they think funny sexual thoughts about buttfuc*ng
and sucking dicks and so on.  if some straight guy doesn't want to
room with such person, it's not homophobic but only natural.  it's
natural for straight guys not to be fuc*ed in the ass. that being the
case, it's natural that they would not want to room with someone who
wants to fuc* him in the ass. now, the gay guy may be proper and
decent enough and make no funny movements or gestures. BUT, he still
thinks thoughts and habors desires which are really yucky to a
straight guy.  so, it's natural that a straight guy wouldn't want to
be in the same room with him.
similarly, suppose the roommate is pedophile or bestiality-dude.
suppose the roommate doesn't act out his fantasies because it's
illegal, but fantasizes about them. on the phone, he has long
conversations with members of nambla. on his desk, there is litearture
about fondling little boys or fuc*ing animals.  now, the roommate may
not do anything to you, but he's a sicko and you naturally don't wanna
room with a sicko.

now, most healthy people have a gut feeling that gay sex is sicko.
if it's not sicko, i dare any liberal straight guy to indulge in gay
sex.  he will feel sick.  any straight guy--liberal or conservative--
wouldn't feel too bad if he were FORCED to have sex with a supermodel
but will feel sick if FORCED to have sex with some gay guy.  now, is
this sick feeling the product of homophobia? of course not. straight
folks naturally feel that gay sex is yucky.
most we can do is tolerate gays and let them be gay. but, gay agenda
tries to persuade us that gay sex is normal, wonderful, etc.
bullshi*.   most guys are straight and they've been naturally
programmed to find women sexually attractive and to find gay sex
yucky.
this is not what society teaches us. it's what we feel from the day we
were born. as it's natural, this aversion to gayness is not phobic but
natural and healthy.
social reality should reflect natural reality. by this, i don't mean
that we should be like animals.  as humans, we can be civilized and
control our desires thru system of laws. however, our society must
reflect what we are naturally.  our civilization must develop from
natural roots.
men are naturally horny for women and vice versa.  men and women
naturally find homosexuality abnormal and even disgusting. however,
some people are born with screwy biochemistry and end up as gays,
pedos, or bestiliaty folks.  we must tolerate them. we must tolerate
gays as long as they keep their gay stuff to themselves. and we must
tolerate pedos and bestilities as long as they keep their sickness
within the realm of fantasy.
but, we should not accept these as normal or healthy. they are not.
life is about the propagation of the species, and this isn't served by
homosexuality, bestiality, or pedophilia.  our social values must be
rooted in nature. in this sense, family is linked to nature.  in
nature, male and female mate to produce offsprings, without which the
species would not survive.  among humans, we have this institution
called marriage to strengthen the bond between man and woman in order
for them to not only have kids but cooperate in raising the kids.  as
maturation for humans take a long time, the cooperation of both
parents are necessary. and because emotional bond between man and
woman goes beyond sexual heat during mating season, marriage ensures
that the bond--while rooted in sexual attraction--will also have a
spiritual and moral dimension and last for the duration of the lives
of the partners.
gay marriage is just a perversion of this notion.  it's an alternative
lifestyle elevated to fundamental truth.  it's like classifying a
plant made of plastic as a real plant.  gay marriage may have the
outward look of a marriage but it's not rooted in natural norms.
sexuality between gay partners is a perversion of sex. it's where an
sexual organ is matched with a fecal organ.  fecal penetration is no
basis for marriage.  similarly, bestiality is a perversion of sex.
while it may involve male and female--male human and female pig--,
interspecies sex defies any understanding of sexual attraction, and no
offspring can be produced from such mating--thank god!  of course,
some people practice bestiality as substitute for real sex.  some farm
boy may hump a sheep and pretend, with his eyes closed, that he's
humping mary lou.  and, non-gay inmates in jail often indulge in homo
sex not because they like it but either as substitute for non-existent
pussy or as a tool to establish his domination over others; notice
that the stronger black inmates usually bugger the white inmates to
make the white boy understand that he's the black man's bitch.

anyway, the term 'homophobia' is dubious in the way it is used.  for
instance, when a movie has a gay joke, someone says it's
'homophobic'.   why is finding humor in something a case of phobia?
if a movie makes fun of fat people, is it fatophobic?  if a movie
makes fun of hillbillies, is it hillbilly-phobic?  since when is
poking fun at stuff 'phobic'?   such humor may be derogatory,
disrespectful, and vulgar. but 'phobic'?  so, when bob hope may
chinese jokes, he was exhibiting irrational fear of the chinese?  so
when johnny carson made jokes about dolly parton's melons, he was
being big-tit-o-phobic?
now, i understand that humor can be nasty and offensive, but how is
making fun of gays 'homophobic'?  and, why is it wrong to make fun of
gays when they are funny.  they talk in a whiny nasal voice, put on
funny make up, walk and move in a funny way, and do other tinkerbell
gay stuff. why is this NOT funny?   we laugh at black comedians who
make fun of how negroes act. we laugh at california teenagers.  we
laugh at jackie chan and his kung fu chinaman ways.  we laugh at
jewish comics making fun of jewish culture. so, why is suddenly phobic
when we laugh at gays who are funny, even if unintentionally?
the reason we find it phobic is because culture commentators--movie
critics, music critics, tv pundits, columnists, etc, etc--tell us it's
'homophobic' to poke fun at gays.  we don't question why it's phobic
because most of us are afraid to think and have other people think for
us. as many of the leading cultural voices in the US are liberal and
leftwing jewish, we all think like liberal and leftwing jews.   now,
jews, being smart, probably have a keener understanding of gay issues
than they let on. but, they see the vast numbers of dimwit goyim and
figure most of us are too stupid to tackle complex ideas. so, it's
much better to feed us simple ideas and simple value systems defined
by simple ideas. as far as jews are concerned, most of us goyim are
far less harmless to jewish interests when we are neutered of our
virility. and if we are all made into bunch of metrosexual pansyass
dorks, we would pose far less danger to jews.   we would be easier to
control.  we would be devoid of our racial, national, sexual, etc
pride.
and sadly, much of our social reality is like this. we blindly follow
the dictates of liberal and leftwing jewish thought and biases, never
thinking for ourselves.

anyway, how did 'homophobia' become a household term?  it's not
because someone cooked it up. it's because the people who control the
media disseminated it to the rest of society.  the acadmia or
intellectual class comes up with all sorts of terms all the time.
most never reach mainstream society.  but, 'homophobia' was picked up
by the media--mainstream, alternative, tv, journals, newspapers, etc--
and disseminated to the public.  day in and day out on CNN, new york
times, chicago tribune, boston globe, LA times, etc, etc, we've heard
the term used over and over. and, when we are saturation-bombed this
way, the word comes to define reality.   it's the same with 'african-
american'.   it didn't become mainstream because someone cooked it up.
it became mainstream because the national media colluded with those
who cooked it up and then made it politically correct to replace
'black' with 'african american'.
this is where who owns and operates the media becomes crucial. it's
the liberal and leftwing jews.  also, the people who come up with most
terms in the academia are also liberal and leftwing jews.  though
these people claim to work in sciences, social sciences are more the
hotbeds of poltical agendas than true sciences.  social sciences
should really be called social studies or social research or social
biances(biased science).   as people are not guinea pigs, true
scientific methodology is impossible in sociological fields.
anyway, that's how so much of social reality is shaped by terms like
'homophobia'.  homophobia doesn't exist in much of society.
homophobia is a scare label cooked up by those who want to push the
gay agenda down our throats or up our asses.
if mccarthy and his ilk owned the media, anyone who opposed the GOP
would have been labeled as 'america-phobes', as though only flagwaving
tards can be true americans.
it's all a matter of who controls the media.  in communist nations,
those who didn't go along with the program were called 'capitalist
roaders' or 'class enemies'.
in order to resist this kind of witch hunt, we must reject not only
the accusation but also the terms of accusation. it's not enough to
say 'i'm not homophobic' but to ask what is 'homophobia'?  once you
use the terms of debate of the accusers, the accusers have already won
the argument.
if you tell a communist official that you're not a 'class enemy', you
have already accepted the idea that history is a matter of class
warfare and there is good classes and bad classes. it's not enough to
say 'i'm not a class enemy' but ask what is a 'class enemy'?  why is
it evil to be a member of the bourgeois class?
similarly, what is 'homophobia'?  what is so sick or evil about being
a healthy normal male who finds homosexual behavior disgusting? and if
homosexual behavior is disgusting, why should it be the basis for
marriage, the most important single social institution underlyng
civilization? should fecal penetration be the basis for marriage?
should two skanks rubbing their poons together be the basis for
marriage?  how do gays even produce kids and create a family? of
course they can't. they reject heterosexuality yet they steal the
product of heterosexuality while pretending that the kid is the
product of gay marriage.  think of two lesbians who have sex all day
and all night long.  yet, they can't produce no kid. so, what do they
do? they adopt some kid from abroad who was the product of sex between
man and woman, and then they raise the kid as if he's the offspring of
lesbian sex.  the deviousness rooted in the idea and practice of gay
marriage is truly sickening.

when a healthy and normal guy who finds homosexual behavior disgusting
says, 'i'm sorry but i'm homophobic, and that's just the way i am',
he's losing the debate. indeed, he's defining his healthy normality as
something to be ashamed of, as something  without moral
justification.  he's pleading to be tolerated for his 'homophobia', as
though he himself is afflicted with some mental sickness or
abnormality which he cannot control.
and we have alot of guys who think this way. why? because we've all
been brainwashed by the national media which drummed the term
'homophobia' into us.  It's like apologizing to a chef who served shit
that you cannot eat it because you are a shitophobe. Yes, YOU should
feel sorry and not the chef!!!!
so, if a guy goes to see 'brokeback mountain' and found the sex scene
icky, he has two options. he can force himself into pretending that it
was all wonderful, noble, and beautiful though he really wanted to
throw up. then, he can flatter himself as being 'progressive',
'inclusive', and 'rational'. the other option is he can be honest and
admit that the scene was truly yucky; sure, he can understand that it
was all nice and beautiful for the gay dudes because they are gay and
like to do such stuff; but as far as he's concerned--and he himself
certainly isn't gay--, the gay sex was truly yucko.  so, what does
this mean?  if he goes by the mainstream media indoctrination, he must
be homophobic.  he can either try to seek help thru counseling or
accept the fact that he's homophobic and suffering from some incurable
mental malady.

of course, the truly sensible thing would be for the guy to understand
that his negative reaction to the gay scene was normal, healthy, and
natural.  the abnormal and unhealthy thing is for two guys to suck and
fuc* eachother and act gay.  the normal and healthy thing for a man is
to love a woman.  the guy who loves women is normal and healthy, while
the two characters in the brokeback mountain are the screwy ones.
now, movies often deal with screwy people, and the role of art is show
not only normal reality but abnormal reality. where 'brokeback
mountain' is dishonest is presenting abnormality as some higher truer
normality while denigrating normality as some kind of banal, mundane,
meaningless dullness-even sickness.   while i can agree that there is
a higher love than sexual attraction, gay lust isn't it. gay lust is
sexual. it's not platonic or spiritual.  gay love is sexual attraction
like straight love.  whereas straight love makes biological sense, gay
sex makes no biological sense and is limited to a small percentage of
people born with biochemical imbalances.  why we should bow down to
gay agenda is really beyond me. actually, it's all to understandable.
it's the product of suicidal liberalism that has taken control over
the western world. all the brain centers and media channels have been
taken over by geeks, gorks, and dorks, not exactly the most virile
among menfolks.  in the US, liberal and leftwing jews associate
national, racial, or sexual virility--at least that of whites--with
nazism or other forms of anti-semitism.  masculin white culture is the
enemy of the jews, so liberal jews are like veterinarians who see
white goy as some wild dog that must be tied down and have its balls
castrated.  of course, when it comes to negro racial and sexual
virility, liberal and leftwing jews are all for it because it serves
as the humiliator of white racial and sexual virility.
indeed, this strange alliance among jewish intellectualism, gayboy
agenda, and negro virility/sensuality makes for very strange social
climate today.  it's like noam chomsky, jack johnson, and elton john
working together, united only by the common enemy called honkey goy.
This is why the isiah washington's 'faggot' scandal is so funny. The
alliance of gays and blacks-and jews-is really on flimsy ground. Negro
culture is ultra virile and macho while gay culture is pussy wussy
while jewish culture is geeky weeky.   indeed, black community is
where anti-gay sentiments are strongest no matter how black leaders--
many of whom despise gays in private--put on a show of support of gay
agenda. the way negroes see it, gay agenda will weaken white male
power. as white society becomes more and more gay-fied, negroes will
be better able to muscle liberal faggoty ass honkey to get what the
negroes want.  negroes find it hardest to bully white christian
conservatives while easiest to bully and pressure faggotyass pansyass
liberal white boys.  while most liberal white boys are not sexually
gay, they are metrosexual pansies without balls. think of ken burns,
the sappy eyed puppydog wagging his white boy tail at his negro
masters, wynton marsalis, stanley crouch, and tavis smiley.  so, both
blacks and jews want white goy society pussified and gayified. it will
be easier to push white goyim around. as as pussified pansyass white
boys, they will not resist jewish or black power like proud virile
white conservatives are doing.

anyway, conservatives must NOT use the leftist or gay terms of debate.
the minute you use those terms yourself, you lose. of course, this
isn't easy as the media which is run by liberal and leftwing jews
disseminate the terms that are most useful for their agenda.
and, it's not just the terms but how they are used.
take 'racist'.  like 'homophobe', it is used only a pejorative in our
national debate. never mind that there are venerable and reputable
scientists who've looked into races and found differences.
but, 'racist' is used only to mean someone who hates others.  and,
it's not only about race but anything. so, if you're anti-catholic,
you're a racist. if you make fun of some national cusine, you're a
racist.
if you make fun of the language of some country, you're a racist.  if
you make fun of the fact that japanese pronounce the letter L with R,
you get labeled a 'racist' though you haven't said anything about
japanese racial characteristics.  if anything, you're a linguistist.
if you're anti-muslim, you're a racist though it's the religion you
hate.
now, how did the term 'racist' come to mean such thing?
and, how come 'racism' only means racial hate when it should also mean
the belief that races exist and that differences among races exist?
'racism' has come to have such totally negative connotations because
of its use by the media controlled by liberal and leftwing jews.
using 'racism' to ONLY mean Hatred for Other People would be like
using 'socialist' to ONLY mean Hatred for Class Enemies and wanting to
kill all non-socialists.   indeed, if the right owned and managed the
media, we could have ended up with such result.
of course, there is more to racism than how we use it, and there is
more to socialism that the marxist kind.   racism can be anything from
nazism with its crude skull measurement to new revelations thanks to
the lastest findings thru unlocking the dna--that there are different
geographical racial types with distinct pool of genetic traits.  but,
the term 'racism' has been twisted and distorted in such a way that it
can only mean the KKK, the nazis, and measuring skulls with rulers.
it can never mean a serious and truly scientific studies of the races
and the differences that may exist physically, emotionally, or
intellectually.  indeed, there is no term for such study because any
mention of racial studies or differences has become 'racist', and
thereby taboo.
now, suppose rightwingers had total control of the media and
academia.  then, 'socialist' might be the ultimate pejorative, meaning
only the murderous forms of marxism, leninism, stalinims, and maoism.
anyone who says there is some merit to certain socialist programs
would be labeled a communist, a spreader of class hatred.

same goes for 'fascism'. why is it that most of us associate only bad
things with fascism whereas marxism can mean both good and bad?  it's
because how the media has distorted the meaning of fascism ONLY to
mean war mongering and racial genocide. those were the darker sides of
fascism but what about the positive sides of fascism?   if we can talk
of both evil and good sides of marxism, why only of the evil side of
fascism?  why is fascism ONLY defined by its evil while marxism is
treated in a more 'fair' manner? again, it's a matter of who controls
and owns the academia and media. in the US, it's the leftwing and
liberal jews or dimwit goyim weaned on leftwing jew thought.
because many who run the media are leftwing or liberal jews, they want
the rest of us to think of fascism and racism only in evil terms.
indeed, much of media news is about what leftwing and liberal jews
want the rest of us to think.
alot of liberal jews may, in fact, privately believe in certain racist
ideas: that races exist and that there are racial differences.  but,
they don't want the rest of us even think of such stuff because it
might lead to ideas such as nazism. as jews are in the minority, they
fear any kind of strong national or racial identity among the majority
goy population.  it's in the jewish interest that the majority goyim
be neutered and not even think about cetain matters; it's best that we
accept certain Truths as unquestionable.  This is why genuinely
liberal larry summers was shouted down.  It wasn't appropriate to even
consider that there might be biological differences; even thinking
about such is taboo.
this isn't to say goy or white virility is necessarily good. we saw
thru nazism that it can indeed be aggressive, war mongering, and evil.
but,  white pussility is also evil cuz it reduces white gentile folks
into dimwit castrated puppets of liberal and leftwing jewish
interests.
and the jews have also been selective in their treatment of history.
we hear mostly about the evils of fascist oppression and how jews were
the victims of such, but we rarely hear of the communist oppression
and how the victims were mostly christian or gentile and were often
oppressed by radical jews. because of our selective understanding of
history, we think of evil fascists and innocent jews but never of evil
communist jews and innocent goyim.
who controls and operates the academia and media is the determining
factor in how we all think and feel.   we believe that what we think
and feel are our own thoughts and feelings but more often than not in
the united states, they were planted in our heads by the leftwing and
liberal jews. indeed, if conservative christians had the kind of power
of academia and media that jews have, many of us would think
differently.  now, jews have such power over us because they are
smarter and have made more money than the rest of  us and because
they've gained the most prestigious positions in academia and media.
and indeed, jewish scholars tend to be the best. but in social
sciences, being best isn't the same as being truthful.  liberal and
leftwing jews have their own interets, agenda, biases. even when they
try to be objective, there is a judeocentric view of the world. this
is true for everyone.  no one can be purely subjective on social
issues. even the fact that certain issues are addressed while others
are ignored is itself a case of social bias. why do we discuss, for
example, the holocaust more than bolshocaust?   we can discuss it
objectively, but the very fact that the focus is more on 6 million
dead jews than 30 million dead slavs  shows that there is a bias in
how we understand history. and why do we discuss israeli-palestinian
issues more than other crises--in many cases much more bloody and
violent--around the world?
also, objectivity is impossible when we are dealing with words which,
unlike numbers, lack specificity.   all adjectives are value
judgments. so, whether an event is described as 'violent', 'bloody',
'horrific', 'murderous', 'shocking' determines its meaning. same goes
for nouns.   an act of aggression may be deemed an 'uprising',
'rebellion', 'banditry', 'massacre', etc.
was john brown a hero or a monster? both?  in any case, it's a matter
of value judgment.
now, consider the 'objective' coverage of news in israel.  whenever
they speak of how israelis attacked palestinians, they balance it with
a story of how palestinians attacked jews. they call it balanced
reporting, but is it really balanced considering the power imbalance
between jews and palestinians?
indeed, when news media covered south africa, they only highlighted
the violence and evil of white afrikaners while suppressing the news
of black violence.   one might say this wasn't fair nor objective
because it sympathized with blacks against whites. but, the media
justified themselves by saying that as human beings, they cannot be
objective in the face of evil and when there was such an imbalance of
power, wealth, and privelege between whites and blacks.
but, when it comes to israeli-palestinian issue, the most you will get
is balanced reportage if not outright bias favoring israel.  why is
this? because jews own and operate most media outlets. of course,
there is the conservative christian factor too in this one because
most christian conservatives believe that god meant jews to return to
israel so jesus can reappear and kill most of them.

so, history and social reality is always understood thru the prism of
subjectivity even when objectivity is the stated goal.  to be sure,
some degree of objectivity is possible in social sciences and history,
and to throw out the baby with the bathwater would be stupid.  just
because we can't be purely objective is no reason to reject
objectivity altogether.  we can try to be 'fair'. but whatever the
attempt, there is no pure fairness, and the fact that liberal and
leftwing jews control so much of our academia and media colors how we
see reality.

alot of newsmen may sincerely think that they are being objective when
they label someone a 'homophobe'. after all, 'homophobia' is a term
accepted by psychologists, and psychology is a science, right?  but,
there is psychology as a real science and psychology as a social
science, and the latter tends to be perverted by social agendas.
one could say the same thing about the legal profession.  judges are
said to stand for objective and fair analysis and understanding of the
law, but they all differ based on their political and social values.
While neither the judiciary nor psychology is a total sham, to see
them as purely objective or scientific is stupid and naive.
before we understand social issues, we must understand who are the
people with the greatest power in framing them, establishing the
terminology, and disseminating them. and, we must understand the forms
of dissemination, from academia to media to popular entertainment.
the problem with many conservatives is that they are non- if not anti-
intellectual, and therefore don't really look into the power structure
of our discourse.
also, any honest discussion of media power leads to accusations of
'anti-semitism', but even this fear of being labeled an 'anti-semite'
is the product of how we've been brainwashed thru schooling and thru
the media.  according to how we've been brought up, jews can criticize
us but we cannot criticize the jews.  jews can bitch and whine about
wasp power, christian power, catholic power, asian power, french
power, german power, arab power, etc, etc, but we cannot criticize
jewish, zionist, or israeli power. Such is called  'anti-semitic';
it's as though criticism of jews means you wanna gas them in
Auschwitz.
just as we've all been brainwashed that any racial idea is 'racist',
we've been taught that every idea critical of jews is 'anti-semitic',
meaning you wanna throw jews into the oven.
so, if you criticize jewish power in the US, you must be a nazi, must
want to gas jews, and so on.
and, the liberal media has done the same with criticism of marxists.
if you criticize someone of his marxism or marxist sympathies, you are
a lowly 'red-baiter', another incarnation of joe mccarthy--propped up
by the media as the worst american that ever lived.  indeed, 'anti-
communist' has a more negative ring among mainstream liberal circles
than 'communist'.
in a social gathering, if you hear that someone in the room is a
'communist', you may think he's misguided but a good person. but, if
someone is an 'anti-communist', he must be a paranoid mccarthyite.
this is the product of jewish brainwashing our minds.
if it's terribly wrong to red-bait, we've been brainwashed to think
it's wonderful and a-okay to fascist- or racist-bait.  you can accuse
anyone of fascism and racism, and the burden is entirely up to the
accused to prove that he's not a fascist or a racist.
if you accuse a liberal of being a 'communist', you're a terrible red-
baiter, and the burden of proof is on you to show that the liberal is
really a commie.
if you accuse a conservative of being a 'racist', you're a wonderful
progressive, and the burden of proof is on the accused to show that
he's not a 'racist', whatever that means in today's meaningless social
discourse.  notice that if you dislike jewish influence and power,
you're a 'racist', but if you dislike islam and islamic influence, you
may or may not be a racist. why is it totally unacceptable to
criticize jews while semi-respectable to criticize muslims?  it's
because jews own and run the media.
jews' grip on the media is such that even to state the obvious gets
you into trouble. so, when marlon brando said jews run hollywood, he
had apologize not for telling a lie but for telling the truth. imagine
that. jews have great power, yet we can't say that they have great
power.  jews wanna have the cake and eat it too. they want the power
and wealth but none of the responsibility and accountability that
comes with them.  jews are richer than all of us but wanna carry on as
though they are still ghetto dwellers being hounded by big tall aryan
brutes.
so, jews make more and more money and gain more and more power, but
thru their control of the media, they've made us feel as though jews
are wonderful helpless victims who need all our sympathy.   it's what
bob dylan used to do when he was a kid. his family was relatively
affluent while kids dylan hung around with were from poorer goy
families. yet, when they went to diners, dylan manipulated others to
buy him stuff like pies and sodapop.  He acted like the poor starving
baby though his family was richer and he got a much fatter allowance.
today, jews have great power but have made us feel compassion and
sympathy for them while they are totally stingy in their feelings for
others.  it's like a scenario where a penniless person feels sorry for
a billionaire and tries to do everything with his meager means to make
the billionaire more comfortable.

anyway, we must understand not only the debate but the terms of
debate.
suppose christians dominate the terms of debate and use terms like
'heaven', 'hell', 'divine', 'satanic', etc.  even if you disagree with
christian worldview, IF you use those terms, you've lost half the
debate already.  you are presupposing that there is a heaven, there is
hell, there is god and devil.   or consider a word like 'sodomite'.
if you accept that term in a debate, you've accepted the a priori
notion that gayness is a wicked sin against god.  so, saying 'i'm a
sodomite' is like saying 'i'm a homophobe'.  in both cases, you're
surrendering to the worldview and paradigm of your enemy.
this is why a gay guy doesn't defend or justify 'sodomy' or says he's
proud to be 'sodomite'. that's like saying 'i'm proud to be piece of
shi*'.  instead, he defines homosexuality with a happy sounding term
like 'gay' and says 'i'm proud to be gay'.   meanwhile, he rejects
'sodomite' as a slur.
then similarly, conservatives must reject the very term 'homophobe'
and out it for what it is: a slur.  there is no scientific basis for
'homophobia' except in a few cases where genuinely homophobic people
do freak out at the mere hint of gayness.
most so-called 'homophobes' are natural, healthy, and normal people
whose disdain for homosexuality is inevitable given their healthy,
normal, and natural virile hormones and biochemistry.  their negative
reaction to homosexuality is as sensible and understandable as the
negative reaction of a healthy person to someone who likes to eat shi*
and drink piss.   would you call such a person a 'eat-shit-n-drink-
piss-ophobe'?  well, if the national media run by liberal and leftwing
jews have their way, we can be moving in that direction.

so, 'homophobe' is a hateful, witchhunting, and bullying SLUR with
bogus and dubious scientific credentials.  like 'racist', it is now
used indiscriminately, hatefully, self-righteously, religiously,
dogmatically, unthinkingly, and stupidly to silence everyone who
opposes the agenda of political correctness masterminded by liberal
and leftwing jews.

in time, there may be backlash just as there was a backlash againt
feminism. remember when every healthy expression or manifestation of
sexuality was denounced by feminists as 'male-chauvanist', 'sexist',
and so on. as the media were overwhelmingly liberal and leftwing
jewish dominated, they went along with this bogus charade.  but, in
time, young people got sick of all this puritanical nonsense and
figured men like women and women like men. but, the backlash got ugly
in its extremity, where in order to rebel against puritanical
feminism, alot of girls went overboard in their whore-ishness. and it
didn't help that the leaders of this backlash were disgusting
animalistic blacks who truly reduced sexuality into a matter of pimps
and ho's.
judging by this, the anti-gay backlash in the coming yrs could truly
be ugly and extreme also.
one extreme leads to another.
gays had a golden opportunity when they asked for tolerance and
equality before the law which made sense. but, then they got greedy
and decided to push down the gay agenda on all of us. now, it's no
longer enough that you're willing to tolerate gays.  you must believe
that homosexuality is normal, wondeful, and healthy. if you disagree,
you are said to be suffering from a phobia.  it means you're mentally
sick or socially diseased, and something is wrong with you and not
with some guys whose idea of pleasure is shoving his sexual organ into
a fecal hole.

according to communism, you were evil if labeled a 'capitalist',
'bourgeois', 'class enemy', or 'kulak'.  the true way to fight
communists was to reject its definitions and teminology-such as 'class
exploitation'.  A capitalist, we know, is not an 'exploiter' but an
entrepreneur who exercises economic freedom under the law.  and what
is a 'kulak'?
In reality, he was a hardworking Russian or ukraianian farmer who
broke his own back to harvest his own crops.  He was not  a criminal
or thief, as communists charged him of being. But, communists
controlled the terminology.  If you were a 'kulak', you were evil.

according to gay agenda folks, you are evil if labeled a 'homophobe'.
and gay agenda people have great power and influence because they have
the full support of the national media, educational institutions,
academia.
gay agenda people have also been aided by the fact that conservatives,
often being prissy, aren't eager to discuss sexual matters. yet, the
best way to out homosexuality for the filthy behavior that it is is to
openly discuss its sexual dimensions. that it involves guys acting
like feminine fairies, sucking eachother's dicks, fondling eachother's
balls, and fuc*ing eachother in the shitholes.  of course, if
conservatives were so candid, liberals would shriek in horror and
condemn such talk as soooo 'vulgar, disgusting, scatological, etc'.
yet, these are the same liberals who've called for more open
expression of sexuality and vulgarity.
so, if some gay filmmaker makes an 'art movie' where gays bugger one
another, it's progressive and artsy. but, if some conservative guys
says, 'how disgusting that guys are fuc*ing eachother in the
shitholes', then he's some vulgar philistine scumbag.
similarly in the arts, if some liberal makes a sculpture out of shit,
it's a great daring work of art. if a conservative holds his nose and
comments that it's made of shit, he's being so crude, vulgar, and so
on for speaking honestly.
so gays buggering eachother and celebrating their gay shit in open
parades are wonderful. but, if you point out the fact that some guy is
sticking his sexual organ into the shithole of some guy, then you're
disgusting, crude, vulgar, and etc.
doing disgusting stuff is wonderful. pointing it out is sick.
indeed, it's funny how so much celebration of and support for gayness
covers up the true nature of gayness--that is involves funny sexual
relationships and disgusting sexual acts.
this would be like celebrating pedophiles while totally forbidding any
honest discussion of what pedophilic sexual acts entail. if you point
out that pedophilia is about adults having sex with kids, YOU would be
the sick vulgar disgusting one for daring to spoil the party with such
talk.
of course, we never separate pedophilic community with pedophilic
acts.
sure, pedophiles may get together and do wonderful normal stuff like
bowling, barbequing, dancing, and so on. but, we know that the core
defining fact of pedophilia is having sex with kids.
similarly, while gays may promote gayness thru non-gay activity like
sporting events, picnics, charities, and so on, we know that gayness
is really about same-sex shithole fuc*ing acts.
why is it that with pedophilia, we never allow nambla folks to fool us
with smoke and mirrors while we allow gays to do this shit to us all
the time.
indeed, many people think the main point of being gay is everything
BUT fuc*ing someone in the ass.
look, the KKK may clean streets, feed the hungry, attend church, give
to charities, but we must never forget that their defining
characteristic is white supremacism.
similarly, gays may do normal social activities and in many areas be
good folks, but we must never forget that their defining
characteristic is unsavory same-sex buggery and such.
now, in both cases, being a member of KKK or being gay doesn't make
the person 100% evil or 100% sick or 100% abnormal or whatever.
indeed, in many ways, a KKK person can be good honest generous person
and a gay guy can be wonderful decent neighbor.
but, the good qualities of the person doesnt' validate the evil or
sick quality.   a KKK is still a race hater and the gay guy is still a
same-sex buttfuc*er.
both KKK guy and gayboy have full rights as US citizens and should
enjoy every right under the law. but, that doesn't mean that KKK
ideology nor gay agenda is good for america.  and we must be
vigilant.
now, we know that words like 'nigger', 'kike', 'spick', 'jap', 'dago'
and 'faggot' are slur words.
but, any word can be a slur depending on how it's used.
remember that communism was anti-religious but became religous because
of the way it was propagated and practiced--with absolute faith.
same is true of words.  'fascist' initially meant italian political
system as devised by mussolini, but over the yrs, it has come to be
slur word used by any leftist against anyone on the right.
'communist' meant someone who believes in marxist ideology but has
come to mean, thru the dimunitive 'commie', a radical scumbag who
wants to extinguish freedom and democracy and nuke the USA.
'gay' can be both positive and negative. alot of people use it as a
slur, as in 'you're soooo gay', or 'don't act so gay'.
and some slur words have become badges of honor in certain circles.
think of 'nigger' which used to mean black savage mofo. but, as the
image of the black savage mofo has gotten cooler thru gangsta culture
and stud negro athletics, being a 'nigga' is cool.
'liberal' has become something of a slur, thanks to the idiocy of
capital "L" liberalism and how conservatives beat up on the term
incessantly--ironic since classical libearalism is what much of what
conservative economic thought is all about.
and, 'homophobe' is also a slur.  there is no science to it.  it just
means, 'fuck you for daring to stand in the way of the gay agenda,
asshole!'.
