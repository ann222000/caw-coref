If you're going to do allegedly risque limericks, you are not permitted to be
coy about them.........the word is spelled "piss".  If using that word offends
you, then you shouldn't post the limerick.

RIGHT!

There was a young punster called Boyle,
Who got his kid 'done' by e-Mohel.
The kid didn'arf scream,
So they rubbed on some cream,
And then wrapped his poor Willie in foil!

For the Goyim: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohel

And half the relations who turned up to watch were imposters. False-kin.

Boom boom!

One in a row!

Every one a Maserati.

Nemo.

With imagination like this, who needs lunacy?
Do Iy mekk myself clear?

Wanna bet?

How about the punny version of an old joke?

This guy walks into a bar with a monkey. Most decent people would walk into
a bar with their legs and feet, butt not this guy. He's different! He has to
walk into a bar with a monkey!

FX: CLANG!!! OWW!! Squeak squeak squeak!

The guy takes a stool at the bar, while the monkey wonders what the guy
wants a turd for and why they're there. The monkey perches next to him and
gets bittern by the parrot whose plaice he's taken. (It's the famous
Norwegian Blue from the elecrifying Monty Pylon sketch. They eat fish - when
they can affjord it!)

The guy orders a drink while the monkey starts eating everything it can
reach -- peanuts, olives, lime slices, even napkins. Several babies catch
cold and start crying. (UK Napkin = US Diaper)

The monkey wanders over to the pool table, falls in and drowns! He's
rhesus-itated by the couple of guys who are playing, and then he jumps up on
the middle of the table, then lifts up the cue ball and swallows it whole.

The monkey's owner immediately knocks down his drink (it was a big bar, so
he got the crane he drives at the building site with a big iron ball on the
end in there quite easily) and says to the bartender and the other
customers, "Hey, I'm real sorry. The little bastard always eats everything
he can get his hands on. I'll pay for everything, I swear". So he does, and
gets arrested for using such clucking fowl language.

A month later, he and the monkey come back again, they take stools at the
bar, the monkey now having the same strange preference as his owner, and the
guy ordures a drink.

Everybody in the bar watches as the monkey reaches across the bar, grabs a
Maraschino cherry, holds it up to his eye, reaches down and stuffs it up his
butt, then pulls it out and eats it.

By the time the monkey has got through all 144 cherries, it's so gross,
people are getting sick. The guy says to the bartender, "Hey, I'm real
sorry. I know it's disgusting, but ever since he ate that cue ball, he
measures everything he eats".

Obviously, to eat cue balls, you need a monkey of the right calibre!

Nemo

Limb O'Ricks yer want? OK.

There was an old man name of Dubya
Whose misses would come round and rub ya!
A Republican, bold,
Or a Democrat, old -
If Al Kaida though, then she would club ya!

Robots write poems in HEX,
While standing on big metal LEX.
The long stream of bits,
Can get on your tits
Till you plug up your ears with some PEX!

LOL!

Lucky it wasn't the daily set of samples over a week to see why you're
getting kidney stones! The bottle for the second set contains very strong
acid!!!  (&gt;!&lt;)

"You're not metabolising nuts properly" the doc said, and I'm Vegan! Half my
amino acids gone. "No. You only have to cut down," he said. And talking of
cutting down . . .

There was a young lady named Chris
Who went to her sister's kid's Briss.
When the kid started screaming
She started blaspheming
Un gegeben der Mohel a gorshtarker groyser zetz in kop mit ir fisst!
