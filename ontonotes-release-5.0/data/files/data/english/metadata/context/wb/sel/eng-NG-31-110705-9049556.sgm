--- - -A*s if his marital challenges were not enough cause for concern,
&quot;Sarco the Sayan&quot; has suddenly emerged as the most infamous accolade of
French President Nicolas Sarkozy. The influential French daily Le Figaro
last week revealed that the French leader once worked for -- and perhaps
still does, it hinted -- Israeli intelligence as a sayan (Hebrew for
helper), one of the thousands of Jewish citizens of countries other than
Israel who cooperate with the katsas (Mossad case-officers).

A letter dispatched to French police officials late last winter -- long
before the presidential election but somehow kept secret -- revealed
that Sarkozy was recruited as an Israeli spy. The French police is
currently investigating documents concerning Sarkozy's alleged espionage
activities on behalf of Mossad, which Le Figaro claims dated as far back
as 1983. According to the author of the message, in 1978, Israeli prime
minister Menachem Begin ordered the infiltration of the French ruling
Gaullist Party, Union pour un Mouvement Populaire. Originally targeted
were Patrick Balkany, Patrick Devedjian and Pierre Lellouche. In 1983,
they recruited the &quot;young and promising&quot; Sarkozy, the &quot;fourth man&quot;.

Ex-Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky describes how sayanim function in By
Way Of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer. They are
usually reached through relatives in Israel. An Israeli with a relative
in France, for instance, might be asked to draft a letter saying the
person bearing the letter represents an organisation whose main goal is
to help save Jewish people in the Diaspora. Could the French relative
help in any way? They perform many different roles. A car sayan, for
example, running a rental car agency, could help the Mossad rent a car
without having to complete the usual documentation. An apartment sayan
would find accommodation without raising suspicions, a bank sayan could
fund someone in the middle of the night if needs be, a doctor sayan
would treat a bullet wound without reporting it to the police.

And, a political sayan ? It's rather obvious what this could mean. The
sayanim are a pool of people at the ready who will keep quiet about
their actions out of loyalty to &quot;the cause&quot;, a non-risk recruitment
system that draws from the millions of Jewish people outside Israel.

Such talk sends chills down spines, especially Arab and Muslim ones.
Indeed, the revelation did not go unnoticed in Arab capitals or come as
much of a surprise. Paris can be a sunny place for shady people. When it
comes to intelligence gathering on behalf of Israel, a question mark is
immediately raised on the moral calibre of the person in question. But,
how does this scandal influence France's foreign and domestic politics?

It is of symbolic significance that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
was on a state visit to France in the immediate aftermath of Le Figaro
's exposé -- ostensibly to discuss Iran's nuclear agenda and the
Palestinian question. Proud and prickly France under its supposedly
savvy new president hopes to play a more prominent role in the
perplexing world of Middle Eastern politics. On Monday, Sarkozy flew to
Morocco, the ancestral home of many of France's Jewry, soon after his
Mossad connection was made public. There is no clear evidence that the
revelation is to make France any more unpopular in the Arab world than
it already is, especially not in official circles.

On the domestic front, however, there are many conflicting
considerations. The Jews of France now display a touch of the vapours,
in sharp contrast to the conceited triumphalism with which they greeted
his election: &quot;we are persuaded that the new president will continue
eradicating anti-Israeli resistance,&quot; Sammy Ghozlan, president of the
Jewish Community of Paris pontificated soon after Sarkozy's election.
France is home to 500,000 Jews, mostly Sephardic Jews originally from
North Africa and Mediterranean countries.

Sarkozy's own maternal grandfather Aron Mallah, hailed from Salonika,
Greece, and is said to have exercised considerable influence on his
grandson. Even though raised as a Roman Catholic, &quot;Sarkozy played a
critical role in moving the French government to do what is necessary to
address the ill winds that threaten the largest Jewish community in
Western Europe,&quot; noted David Harris, the executive director of the
American Jewish Committee. Sarkozy, after all, was a political product
of the predominantly Jewish elite neighbourhood of Neuilly-sur-Seine,
where he long served as mayor.

France's Muslim minority was far from surprised by Le Figaro 's
revelations, even though some may have feigned disappointment. Others
have been more forthright. &quot;France is not run by Frenchmen, but by
lackeys of the Zionist International who control the economy,&quot; lamented
Radio Islam, of militant Islamist tendencies. When Sarkozy was France's
minister of interior and clamped down hard on Muslim immigrants, calling
mainly Muslim rioters &quot;scum&quot; in a widely-publicised interview, they
retaliated by calling him &quot;Sarkozy, sale juif [dirty Jew]&quot;. Obviously
there is no love lost between the five million-strong French Muslim
community, the largest in Western Europe, and the French president. He
has grounds for concern. He assiduously courts the Israelis. That much
is known.

In the scientific annals of French politics there is a cautionary tale
of pantomime. French presidents are not always what they seem. There
are, however, two key observations concerning Sarkozy. One, is Sarkozy's
intention of implementing a &quot;new social contract&quot; between employers and
employees, capital and labour. This smacks of Thatcherism. His
determination to force a &quot;cultural revolution&quot; in the collective
national psyche is a trifle farcical. And unprincipled to boot. He
recently introduced legislation -- in tandem with his pension cuts,
calling for genetic profiling of immigrants to ensure any relatives
intending to immigrate are linked genetically. The strategy appears to
be to soften the blow of the social security cuts by appealing to
xenophobic racism.

The state of race relations in France is an even more muddled picture
than the devastating caricatures by French-African comedian Dieudonne
suggest. He is notorious for playing the part of a Hassidic Jew who
mimics the Nazi salute. Few politicians blame their troubles on cynical
comedians, though, and Sarkozy is no exception. His fans point accusing
fingers at the &quot;irresponsible press&quot;.

The real magic starts when you power Sarkozy with his ex-model wife.
She, after all, played a part in the freeing of the Bulgarian nurses and
a Palestinian medical doctor. She, too, is of Spanish-Jewish ancestry.
But, that may be nothing but an insignificant aside. France, generally,
regarded their bust-up as something of a bad joke. Unlike the Americans,
the French do not take the private lives of their presidents terribly
seriously. There was the late François Mitterrand, for example. Hardly
anyone in all France raised an eyebrow when it transpired that he had an
illegitimate daughter. The French are more concerned with the
ideological orientation and political affiliation of their president and
are not in the least interested in their private affairs -- at least not
in any political sense.

The interesting twist, however, is that the contest between Cecilia and
Nicolas Sarkozy is a comic cross between a lover's tiff and the battle
of the sexes. It appears befuddled French voters are being forced to
turn a blind eye to their leaders' antics. Sarkozy's divorce follows
hard on the heels of the separation of France's first female
presidential candidate Ségolène Royal, the &quot;gazelle&quot; of French politics,
from her lifelong lover François Hollande barely a month after she lost
the presidential race in May. Moreover, at the tender age of 19, Royal
sued her father for his refusal to divorce her mother and pay alimony
and child support. That was way back in 1972; barely a decade later she
won the case against her father. Ironically, Royal's own mentor the late
French socialist president Mitterrand was notorious for his
extra-marital affairs, the most conspicuous being his love affair with
Anne Pingeot and subsequent disclosure towards the end of his life that
he fathered an illegitimate daughter Mazarine with her.

And, what of the voters? The latest hazard facing the French president
has been his socio-economic policies. Sarkozy's showdown with the trade
unions threatens to turn into a deciding moment for France. Foreign
policy, too, has come under much scrutiny. France has become fanatically
Atlanticist under the presidency of Sarkozy. Although, unlike US
President George W Bush, Sarkozy does not make much noise about his own
dubious religious convictions. The commonest criticism of Sarkozy is
that he is overly conscious of his religious heritage, a trait that is
not appreciated by the fanatically secular French political
establishment. France is culturally the most irreligious country in
Europe, itself the most secular and anti-religious of the world's
continents.

For a politician acclaimed for his acumen, it is startling that Sarkozy
has been tripped up by events he should have seen coming. His sagacity
obviously failed him this week. Le Figaro let the cat out of the bag.
And his wife, too, after shopping with Lyudmila Putin, the Russian first
lady, apparently decided that she had had enough of being treated as
&quot;part of the furniture&quot; and made their rift very public.

France is now in the awkward position of having no first lady. The 49
year- old former model, lawyer and political advisor is by no means
media shy. &quot;I gave Nicolas 20 years of my life,&quot; she told the popular
French magazine Elle in a special feature which she asked for
personally, despite the awkwardness of its timing. She had long
complained of being politically peripheralised. Troubling as that
interpretation is, it is in a way a consoling one for Sarkozy. He is now
free to handle his opponents without his maverick Cecilia breathing down
his neck or, on the contrary, disappearing at crucial moments.

Even with his personal life in tatters, Sarkozy is obliged to hoist the
French tricoleur high in the international arena. Which flag is it to be?
