Thinking of some of the more unusual queries I get here I have one that I
wonder if anyone can come up with a solution to.

2 Domestic ducks who do not want to swim!!

- lovely large garden
- lovely vast pond which is clean and inviting
- easy access
- no disturbance
- happy healthy birds
- love to splash in a shallow dog bed

but they do not want to go on to the water.

- been fed in the shallows
- had their dog bed taken away
- had their house moved to the water side

????

Well far be it for me to take a stab at answering a question like that.

But - I was just reading yesterday about Muscovies and how they are
tree dwellers and don't need a pond or water to swim in.

Could the answer be that simple.

I don't have a solution, but a similar situation.  For almost the past
two months my 12 ducks and 3 geese refuse to swim in our steam.  I used
to have a hard time getting them out of it in the evening to roost.  The
only thing I can think of in my situation is that the water may be nasty
because of all of the farm chemicals running off the fields now.  Lately
the farmers upstream have really been spraying fungicides, before that
they were really laying on the herbicides and fertilizers.

How about trying a floating decoy?

What sort of ducks are they?  Were they incubator hatched?
If feasible, I would catch each one and sort of &quot;post&quot; them gently as far
out on to the surface of the pond as I could.  I'm fairly sure when they
started paddling to get back to the land they would realise they were
enjoying it;-)
I did this once with a dog which was longing to swim but just didn't have
the courage to get out of the shallows.   I pushed her just out of her
depth.  Once she had swum I couldn't keep her out of water!

Whilst we are on the subject of ducks, Jill, do you know anyone in the East
Midlands who keeps Muscovies?  I rescued a 2006 hatched drake at Easter and
am having no luck at all finding a couple of girlies for him.  He's lavender
&amp; white, so lavender &amp; white preferred but not essential.  Further afield
would be okay if delivery arrangements could be made.
I really like this drake, he's charming and so funny.  I don't like to keep
him without duck company, although he has made friends with my three
Lakenfelder hens who share the orchard with him, it's not the same as being
able to share his &quot;duckness&quot; - do you know what I mean? or does it sound
daft?

Sorry -- not Muscovies &lt;g&gt;When the query first came in I wondered though.

Muscovies are not really tree dwellers. They have been recorded to climb,
and they are grazers rather than dibblers but they LURVE to swim and paddle.
They just don't spend as much time on the water as some ducks.

Mom and dad teach the babies to swim.  If they've never been taught to
swim in anything but a pool, then that's what they're going to
choose.  It usually takes a caretaker putting or leading them into the
water to show them it's okay.

From over 15 years of raising ducklings without mums I know this is not so.
Almost every duckling is capable of swimming with or without Mum

Maybe the secret is to introduce them to swimming depth water when they
are only young. All our hand reared ducks were put in the laundry trough
for their first swim when only a few days old and as adults they make a
bee line for the swimming pool as soon as they are let out. The salt and
chlorine don't worry them at all.

Hi, Jill!
I don't know what things may lurk below the waters where you live, but
when my birds stop going into the water it's usually alligator
snapping turtles.  After we trap or fish the turtles out the birds
will resume swimming.
Murky water does not stop our birds from taking a dip.  So water
quality evidently isn't a concern for them.  Not algae bloom or
floating plants stop them.  Only the turtles.  With the geese, after
they have seen turtlles, even the smaller &quot;pond&quot; turtles will put them
off the pond.  Then they go to the sheep trough for water.
Even large fish can put some birds off the ponds.

ekk -
no we don't have anything like them in the UK
This situation is in a domestic garden in the south of UK with a decent
sized pond.
Its all rather frustrating for the owners. The ducks seems perfectly happy
to use their paddling pool but its more work for the owners and not what
they expected.

I never said they couldn't swim.  What I said was that going into a
pond might be an issue of not being familiar or comfortable with the
water depth because it's usually Mom or Dad that takes them to the
pond the first time and shows them it's okay.  My daughter's ducks
will go in the pool in the front yard because she showed it to them
when they were very young and put them in it.  They will NOT go in the

We have raised hundreds -- probably into thousands of ducks. Others have
raised more.

Mostly in smallish batches
All without Mum
Water holds no problem for them.
Its only &quot;usual&quot; for some ducks to have the duck / drake around.
Probably a greater percentage around the globe are incubator reared.
Its uncommon to have a problem if there is not something in the water or
such.
Ducks raised by a duck are in deep water at a day or two old. Its a
completely different issue.

I read all the books that said not to let the ducklings get wet until after
they had feathers, then Mama duck led them practically straight from the
shell to the 'little pond' (water bowl).  I tried telling her she was making
a mistake, but she knew better.  ;&gt;

A friend suggested that because they had a Mom, these ducklings were getting
oils on their fluff that the incubatored ducklings wouldn't have.  Does that
make sense?

Exactly
From the moment ducklings hatch out from under Mum they are snuggling in
amongst her oily feathers. So after teh 24 - 36 hours she will wait before
taking them for their first perambulation and show-off they will be
wonderfully oily.
Have you not noticed how they just sit on top of the water. Its almost
difficult for them to swim they are SO bouyant.

What we do with our ducklings is to give them a metal tray filled with
washed pebbles from the first week or so. This they can walk across but not
get saturated in. They are in a heated area with ever-changing bedding and a
heat lamp so they don't get chilled.
In this way they stimulate their oil glands early and by the time they go
outside here, they can cope with our rain and happily bob into the water
without a problem.
We have had ducks in the past given to us which were not given proper water
to keep clean and swim in. They spent the first week in the water with a
VERY low displacement. They were just about sunk. As they groomed and
stimulated the oils and got their feathers back into condition they
gradually rise out of the water !!

You all keep coming up with fearsome predators!!

Its still possible to give mum and babies a paddling pool so she can get
herself all cleaned up from long time sitting and the babies lurve it.

She usually buys ducklings, since it's too difficult keeping the mother duck
from doing what comes naturally.  We have an alligator, so no ducks here ;-)

I will do me best - feels like April here. We even lit the Rayburn in the
house again yesterday.

I would do if I could do.
Unfortunately then I could not see as they are part of the varifocals I wear
all day every day &lt;g&gt;
But we do try and keep our peace with them by various means

HI, Jill!
Ouch!  It seems to go against nature to heat in Summer.
We have 102 F today again.  Everyone is trying to stay cool, in shade
or water.  The air went out on the van, so the kids' ride from school
in the afternoon is an adventure.  This kind of weather makes me kind-
of glad that we only have geese now.  They know what to do to keep
cool.
Oh, Jill...think balmy beaches, dry cracked earth, sunburn under the
shade trees, sun so hot that it goes right through your clothes and
sets your skin on fire.  That might keep you warm a minute!
And I'll think April... showers, flowers, ...
I have a beautiful green pool surrounded by trees and rock walls and
fed by cascading waterfalls as my wallpaper on the computer.  The
slideshow screensaver has all matter of cooling pictures.  I'm trying
to think cool!
