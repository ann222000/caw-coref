rather do Jessica alba but for some reason her name was not one of
your options

&lt;/begin tag&gt;
When you have reached the end of the road, then you can decide,
whether to go to the left or to the right, to fire or to water. If you
make those decisions before you have even set foot upon the road, it
will take you no where... except to a bad end.

Well, Uma certainly looks much, much younger than SMG. Most people would
agree on that.  I'm not a fan of Uma's looks really. I guess I'm not
into that half White, half Asian mix stuff..BUT, I think given the
choice of doing Uma, tall, thin, in shape, firm, or doing SMG, - a
midget with wonky eyes flabby upper arms, a gut, flabby thighs, an arse
that looks like a bag o' shit, droopy yentle hooded eye lids, a turkey
waddle neck, bulging blue-black veins, hands like talons,  and looking
like a booze drinking &amp; drugged out 47 year old....
I'd do UMA everytime ! It is a no brainer ! I'd need a bottle of viagra
and nudey magazines to perform with grandma Sarah Gellar !!!!!

&gt;There's something more than just physical appearance that is interesting about
&gt;Uma. I probably just liked her in Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill movies. I
&gt;almost remember she had nice boobs in Dangerous Liaisons. Maybe Uma.

Uma.  Without  a doubt.  Did you see My Super Ex Girlfriend?

&gt;No, was it good? I seem to remember thinking the trailers looked it might be
&gt;fun. Too bad people who saw it didn't think so. C+ from yahoo users and it only
&gt;made $22 million. Luke Wilson is the guy who played Kelso's obnoxious brother on
&gt;&quot;That 70's Show&quot;. I can see why they chose him for that role. There's nothing
&gt;appealling about him.

It was ok.  If they had any other female in the world play it, I doubt
I would have liked it as much...

Uma Thurman is older, more talented, and far more interesting than
SMG. But I did love every season and almost every episode of Buffy the
Vampire Slayer. I only wish Joss Whedon still had something going on
in television. I'm just not that into the comic book scene.

I probably picked up on that, but I tend to randomly hit topics as
they interest me. If you're going to compare Uma Thurman and SMG
simply on looks, I think Uma wins regardless of her age. Oh no, the
timer rang and I must run. Someone's getting out of school now and I
have to pick them up and take them to gymnastics.

she's all boxed up with a litter of kittens and none of them sound too
happy about the situation.  she can learn to walk all the balance

I love the mental imagery. But kittens are a bit of a cliché. Still,
Columbian cockroaches is likely too disturbing and everyone smiles
when you mention a kitten. I know one board where they post a kitten
and threaten to kill it every time you post in the wrong section.

Interesting point Lab-Rat. I tend toward a stream-of-consciousness
writing style. And so bits and pieces of my day get inserted. And then
when someone talks about boxing up a child with kittens, I could get
offended, but I'm more likely to see the absurdity in their comment.
You seem like a genuine, nice sort of person. I'll take your words to
heart.

But it's sad. Children need to be protected. And we need to guard
again those who prey on them. But we lose something in the world when
we have to excise all imagery of children, their innocence and joy
from our world, in order to protect them. Its akin to how the world
once treated women, locking us away behind doors and in cloistered
retreats, to protect us from violating eyes. Not that children should
not be protected. But I remember my childhood, just running up and
down the street with a bunch of kids, riding my bike everywhere with
no fear.

And then I had a thought the other day, my children are picked up and
dropped off everywhere. They have no unsupervised time. I used to walk
to school, but I won't even let my children walk two blocks to
grandma's house alone. There is no running up and down the street with
a bunch of kids, I have to organize play days or do mommy and me.

Oh my! I'm going to draw lovely Dar's fire again. I'm not quite sure
where his or her blog is, but my post on this Uma/SMG thread seems to
have ended up there. With luck, he has censored me or whatever you do
to get rid of irrelevant posts.

I love technology in that way.

On topic for the moment, Uma Thurman is 7 years older than SMG.

Neither has much booty. Jessica Biel puts them to shame.

I also think Hayden has a fine little bubble butt.
