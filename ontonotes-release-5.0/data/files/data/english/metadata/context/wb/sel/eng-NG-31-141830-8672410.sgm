Kay is away on business through next week.  She contacted me and asked  me to
post the following information.

Dear All,

I wanted to thank Greg Hession for validating  that AFRA has bashed Suzanne
for a very long time.  I regret that they are  now bashing you, Greg.

I have been kept current on what has occurred  on this group the whole time
I've been gone.

What I find so disappointing is that all  of the allegations without any
facts or proof has made  family advocacy look bad.  This is what I've had to fight
continuously for  the four years that I've been here.  It is amazing that I
still have  my professional team intact and we can still work together and are
progressing.

I am surprised that the same old problems  still plague the family advocacy
platform.  Patriot Law does not work  people.  I notice that AFRA still offers
the book Sui Juris for sale on  their website even though it has been posted
over and over that Patriot Law/Sui  Juris hasn't won one case and does not fly
in the court venue we must litigate  in.

I hear after Dennis Hinger's  lastest  bashing and false statements regarding
FAMTRACK and all of its fallout, there  has been yet, another weak warning
that no bashing is to take place.  You  know, its funny, no FBI agent has
contacted me about FAMTRACK as Dennis  alleged.  I am getting questions about how we
do this.  I am not  telling any of these people, except the FBI where the
safe-houses are that were  used.  I am not giving you people any free information
anymore about how we  conduct our successes.  The reason for this is we've
seen you people  completely misuse the information because you cannot understand
how it  works.  The only secret FAMTRACK was keeping was keeping it secret
from the  STMs because we know they would misuse it.  A recent example is Ms.
Lake's  post about how wrong it can go for you or your child when you are an
inexperienced, untrained advocate and try to hide someone improperly.

FAMTRACK assists people in starting over with  their lives after their cases
are closed.  This includes employment  finding, food, clothing and shelter.
It is not for families to languish in  other peoples homes and be abused in
those homes by those members who would take  advantage and look to the family as
their free laborers.  Or, would look to  those families as to someone they
could monetarily benefit from and either  charge them money or take their
belongings.
That all I wanted to say about FAMTRACK in  order to clarify when it is a
tool for a family.  So please stop calling me  and asking me how it can be
implemented for persons I have not history  about.

Dennis, I am still waiting for you to prove  your claims after you shot off
your mouth making allegations, once again, that  you cannot support.  You now
lose by default.

It was at my insistence that some kind of  advisory be started after the
fiasco that happened at Renee  Cygan's.   Taylor and Renee by their private
agreement agreed to allow Taylor and her children to stay at Renee's  home as a
safe-house.  After Taylor contacted me to tell me that her stuff  was missing and
that Renee had kicked her out and kept her stuff, that was the  last straw.
Unfortunately, there had been a couple of other  incidences of families abused
by safe house owners who were in the movement and  that culminated my need to
insist that we have some kind of advisory.  We  all know that this evolved
into the Bad Advocates List.  The list style was  not mine design but I began to
see that there were many loose cannons out there  who were involved in this
movement that were harming families.  I did not  write the Bad Advocates List
or did ever or currently have any ownership in the  list.

With regard to FAMTRACK, Renee Cygan was the  last person who abused a
family.  The problems were solved and since that  time we've not had to deal with
any abuse issues.  I cannot speak for any  other people who have housed
families, had railroads or other way in which they  housed families.  I know that some
have stated they were harmed but I have  no issues with that because it is
not my railroad.  If someone in the  movement is saying they are a part of
FAMTRACK, you can contact me and I will  verify the truth of that statement.  No
one is involved with FAMTRACK on  any of these groups.

When Suzanne did own the Consumer Advisory  list, I did publicly state that
there were some people on there who I didn't  think should be.  They know who
they are and I won't rehash this  issue.  When Greg, Suzanne and other
Connecticut Conference planning  committee persons were in the meeting,
we did get an idea of what the agreement  was.  Suzanne put everything on the
table. AFRA Directors and AFRA_Cencom  were aware that negotiations were
going on because I was present when the  current AFRA President spoke over the
phone with AFRA BOD members who called his  office.  I also saw the contract.
Included in the contract was the  following.  AFRA would come up with a statement
regarding protecting  individual intellectual property.  No Suzanne Shell
bashing, no bashing of  any kind of any member.  Suzanne would allow AFRA members
to attend the  training at the same price as any other participant.  Suzanne
would get rid  of the Bad Advocates List.  It was very amicable and the deal
was  done.  A meeting time was set to execute the contract complete with
witnesses.  Finally it would be over.  Greg, as AFRA President had  accomplished
this feat with Suzanne's blessings.  Suzanne was happy, Greg  was happy and we
believed we put this bad blood behind us and we could move  forward.

The afternoon before the execution of the  contract, Bill Tower and Cletus
Kiefer began to sabotage our unifying  efforts.  They were casting doubt on
Effie's Connecticut  Conference without any proof of their allegations.  To this
day, they  have never ponyed up the proof of the accusations  they claimed was
occuring at the Connecticut Conference.  Due to this interference and other
factors, Greg Hession resigned from AFRA.  I resigned shortly  after.

One other issue is that we have no ability to  be national movement because
we don't have a common focus.  We are all over  the map, parent rights,
grandparent rights, foster rights, father's rights,  mother's rights.  I know from
experience you cannot meld all of these under  one roof and expect it to fly.
We have to narrow out our path so that we  don't continue to rub against each
other and create flame wars.  I cannot  believe the crap that is read to me on
who is supporting who.  If it was a  foster parent or social worker who came
up on our sites in support of us, they  would have been chewed up and spit out.
How the hell can we have a  movement when we don't know what we stand for
and when we switch our  position on a constant basis.  I think that being
flexible is good but this  isn't a flexibility problem.  I am tired of getting my
hopes up and  thinking people are going to work together when for seven years, I
have  seen the same old, same old.

Mr. Smith, I hope you can pull together what I  tried and others tried to do
and you succeed at it.  I am sorry I cannot  attend the Rally this year.  Hope
it is a big success.

Until we rid ourselves of the members who  cannot raise to the professional
level and get along with other associations  without any disparity, we are
unable to bridge this gap.  While I  understand your philosophy, Ron, it is my
opinion until the underlying issues  are corrected, I am doubtful that a national
event can take place.  I  sincerely hope you prove me wrong.

Kay
