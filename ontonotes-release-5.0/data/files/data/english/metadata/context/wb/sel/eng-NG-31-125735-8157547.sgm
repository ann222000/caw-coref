This morning (24th) I was fortunate in that on the same net round, two juvenile Golden-crowned Kinglets (Regulus satrapa) and one Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula) were captured. As with most species of warblers, this feather plumage does not last long and is a stage not often seen by other than the discerning.

I took the opportunity to take  images for interest and the record. One RESA was already moulting and could be ditinguished as a male, the other caught in the same net and likely a sibling, was not distinguishable to sex; neither was the RECA - but possibly both were females .

RESA on the right in both whole bird images.

Barry: this is just for you. Can't you just hear the scolding notes?

WAAVIII  !!! I think even I could hear that. In fact, I do hear Warbling Vireos quite well. I know one is not supposed to 'interfere' with another's photos, but on my computer and to my eyes, one click of 'blur'  removes 'grain' without detracting from quality. A liitle tilt of the head would have been perfect?

You are right Barry.  I applied some blur and got rid of the annoying
background grain.  Thanks for the tip.

Feel free to manipulate and resend anything I post. That is why I send
stuff. Not for adoration but to learn and share experiences.  The pics are
just cannon fodder to the process.

On a couple of occasions, I suggested that I hoped to build a section
for my Website about the things one could observe when watching birds
fly. Rather than distinguishing among species, I wished to
distinguishes among flight manoeuvres.

I have now posted the first version of it. The table of contents is at

http://kootenay-lake.ca/birds/flight

and it links to pages, pictures, and captions on: gliding, flapping,
turning, launching, landing, and hovering. There are other worthy
topics to treat, but this is a start.

Alas, this new section on bird flight represents more book learning
than years of experience. So, if you are inclined to offer critical
comment which might help me refine the pages, please do so. I  am
trying to get it right---set me straight.

Interesting site Alistair.  I was watching the movie Winged Migration
the other night and was surprised to find that Swans don't glide
(except for landing).  They apparently beat their wings the entire
length of their migration route.
See you in the field

Might be like a 747 shutting off its engines to  glide?

Anyone give a shot as to the ID of this beetle?  Weevil?

thanks

HI Jim:  I think I have seen a similar beetle before and may have tried to
key it but can't recall if I got an answer.

I believe it belongs to the Curculionidae family which include the weevils.
The elbowed antennae put it in one of at least 15 subfamilies and only
excludes the possibility of it being in one of 3 subfamilies that do not
have elbowed antennae, but I can't take it much farther. Unless someone
knows it right away by sight, it needs to be keyed under a microscope or
hand lens.

But just for fun, I will suggest that it might be  Brachyrhinus sulcatus, or
more modern taxonomy may refer to it as Ottiorhynchus sulcatus. It is
sometimes called the alfalfa snout beetle or rose beetle and often infests
house plants or greenhouse plants.

Ok thanks.   It has a very hard shell.  I saw it in the bathroom and
picked up a plastic hammer (bath toy, not mine) and when I hit it it
shot off and bounced off the wall with an obvious tink kind of noise.
Not sure but it also appears to play dead.
I found one picture that looked similar and it was a weevil.

HI Jim:  a characteristic of Ottiorhynchus is that it plays dead when
attacked, really !  Although a blow from a hammer would make many insects a
little groggy.

Many of the curculionids are pretty well armoured as are most beetles
really. If you look at them closely, you will see that they are like little
battle tanks.
