Learning for knowledge and company
The boom in lessons and lectures for adults reflects deeper changes in
the way that Greeks are making use of their leisure time

The Stoa tou Vivliou's Language and Arts Hall is packed for a lecture
by Costas Georgoussopoulos. The overwhelming majority of participants
are women. 'There were no places where a city person could spend their
leisure time. If there are places, people will find them by
themselves,' said Thrasos Kaminakis of the Mikro Polytechneio.

By Dimitris Rigopoulos - Kathimerini

Vassilis and Christina are colleagues at a large multinational
corporation on Pireos Street. They belong to the first generation of
Greeks who have had to forgo the traditional afternoon siesta. On good
days, they might get home from the office at 6 or 7 p.m.

Last winter they did something you might not expect from them or from
most Greek workers â€“ they signed up for a photography seminar by
Platon Rivellis at the Rouf branch of the Benaki Museum.

&quot;We wanted to do something for ourselves, something that wasn't work,
that would help us let off steam and that we liked.&quot;

The early evening time slot was no obstacle: &quot;The feeling of doing
something for yourself is so invigorating that it's worth trying to
cram it in.&quot;

This year Christina is thinking of going for the free seminars being
offered by the Municipal Art Gallery in Psychico. Vassilis, who was
enthusiastic about the photography seminars, is determined to continue
after Christmas. In the meantime, he has managed to drag his mother
away from the television set by encouraging her to take up knitting
lessons at Eleftheroudakis bookstore on Panepistimiou Street.

The Mikro Polytechneio on Aghion Assomaton Square has become an
institution in the field of adult learning. Thrasos Kaminakis, one of
the founders, could hardly believe the demand for the project. &quot;You
used to hear that nobody had any free time, but what I believe is that
we were suffering from a lack of organized spaces. There were no
places where a city person could spend their leisure time. If there
are places, people will find them by themselves,&quot; said Kaminakis.

And he was as good as his word. The Mikro Polytechneio attracts a
large, extremely diverse clientele of people aged 30 to 70. &quot;A lot of
people think we are a hangout for students, but that is a
misunderstanding,&quot; said Kaminakis.

It is not the only one. Some people confuse private initiatives with
projects run by local government authorities. In fact this is
something completely different, and charges admission. A six-month
course will cost about 100 euros, though there are some exceptions,
both more and less expensive.

Among the organizers are some big names, such as the Filekpaideftiki
Etaireia (which runs the Free University in the Stoa tou Vivliou book
arcade), and the Benaki Museum, with its own series of seminars, which
cash in on their names and the fame of their speakers.

&quot;Yes, there is a segment of the public who base their choices more on
the name of the speaker,&quot; the secretariat of the Filekpaideftiki
Etaireia confirms. Their winter program attracted more than 2,000
applications, twice the number they had space for. Following its
success last year, the Free University has expanded its program from
five series to eight. The need to for better quality use of limited
free time and the quality of the speakers are one side of the coin.
The other is purely social, and has to do with a quest for lost
socializing. &quot;There are people who come to us without knowing exactly
what it is they want from us,&quot; said Kaminakis. &quot;It's enough for them
to get out of the house and meet new people. They are seeking
company.&quot;
