Introduction

I would like to speak on the subject of community by talking about concepts such as syndicalism, anarchism, and socialism. By syndicalism I mean, &quot;A variation of socialism in which the workers own or control the factory or workplace&quot;[1], by anarchism I mean, &quot;society based on shared ownership and voluntary agreements among individuals and groups .without each person's consent and involvement in the social order&quot;[2], and by socialism I mean, &quot;A system based on public ownership of the means of production and distribution of wealth.&quot;[3] Overall, my purpose will be to investigate mainly a perception of syndicalism.

Syndicalism Compared to Bible Socialism

The concept of bible socialism as taught by the bible would be best stated by the reference of, &quot;All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had.&quot;[4] The same set of scripture also makes reference to how a man named Ananias and his wife Sapphira both died as a result of selling their property and keeping some of the property back for themselves[5]; moreover, such reference shows the serious nature of entering a socialistic living under the command of Peter. Overall, such undeniable evidence shows that the church that was under the authority of Peter openly embraced socialism as the only economic system in practice by Peter's communion of believers.

The reason why the Church under the command of Peter would have had such an embrace of socialism at the same time as being one is heart is most likely because of a literal interpretation of what Jesus said when he said, &quot;.Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.&quot;[6] The system of bible socialism in scripture however alludes to the notion that Peter was made responsible for distributing for those who had need from the funds that had been obtained from early Christians selling their property as a response to the subject of Church entrance and or participation[7]. Overall, what can thus be said is that the teaching of bible socialism developed out of a conscious desire to affirm the centrality of the teachings of Christ, and thus the reason why bible socialism was established is for entering a special fervor for the moral and spiritual teachings of the church as well as a special relationship with Christ.

Goldman likewise presents the system of syndicalism to be very much focused upon the intellectual and moral development of workers with the quote, &quot;Nearly all leading Syndicalist agree with the Anarchists that a free society can exist only through voluntary association, and that its ultimate success will depend upon the intellectual and moral development of the workers who will supplant the wage system with a new social arrangement, based on solidarity and economic well-being for all.&quot;[8] The comparison of Syndicalism and bible socialism along with anarchism would thus be that all three systems present the focus as the development of the person for the sake of morality and intellectuality. Overall, as contrasted to capitalism that mainly only concerns itself with serving the needs and desires of those owning capital; syndicalism and anarchism present the development and value of the individual as the goal to be achieved for a healthy unified society.

The Battle Against Capitalism

Emma Goldman in Syndicalism: Its Theory and Practice writes the following about how syndicalism should relate to capitalism, &quot;.Syndicalism must repudiate the old, rusticated, worn-out methods of trade unionism, and declare for an open war against the capitalist regime, as well as against every institution which to-day supports and protects capitalism.&quot;[9] Likewise many people who believed in the scripture of the early church would have agreed with this statement for in regard to a capitalistic like government that endorses acquisition of wealth among the owners/ rulers at the expense of the poverty of the laborers the scripture says the following,

.I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names (with) .seven heads and ten horns. The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries . written on her forehead: MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits. They are also seven kings. &quot;The ten horns . are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom. &quot;The waters . where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages. The beast and the ten horns . will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire. The woman . is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.&quot; .(an) angel from heaven. .with a mighty voice shouted: &quot;Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great! She has become a home for demons and a haunt for every evil spirit, a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird. For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.&quot; .God has remembered her crimes. Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done. Mix her a double portion from her own cup. Give her as much torture and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. In her heart she boasts, 'I sit as queen; I am not a widow, and I will never mourn.' Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her. &quot;When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her. Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry: &quot; 'Woe! Woe, O great city, O Babylon, city of power! In one hour your doom has come!' &quot;The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes any more- cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble; cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and bodies and souls of men. . The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn .[10]

Overall, as one can see clearly the thrust of Marxism presenting concepts such as wage slavery arising out of a class condition, and the thrust of Syndicalism for Goldman becoming that of waging war against capitalism, best summarized with the quote about America, &quot;we hate her superficiality, her cant, her corruption, her mad, unscrupulous worship at the alter of the Golden Calf[11]&quot;[12], both appear to be problems that the early church would have been able to circumvent by people selling all they had and adopting the notion of bible socialism noted earlier.

One of the distinctions that is even made by Christ himself is that of giving to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and giving to god what belongs to god[13]; moreover, such is said in reference to paying taxes to Caesar when Jesus was given a coin that the description of would have proclaimed Caesar as both high priest and the son of god[14]. The terms high priest and son of god[15] would have mainly only applied to Christ however for the Christian, and for Saint Augustine the point of his work The City of God appears to be all about making the distinction between a early kingdom that rules by pride and domination and a heavenly kingdom that rules by love and the authority of Christ. Overall, the point thus made in attacking capitalism in benefit of a system such as Syndicalism, bible socialism, or even concepts that would develop from a type of anarchism is that in attacking capitalism for the oppression the system causes a person would show obedience to the kingdom of god.

Goldman makes the clear distinction that holding to the old capitalistic system is immoral. The following is thus written about the subject,

The fundamental difference between Syndicalism and the old trade methods is this: while the old trade unions, without exception, move within the wage system and capitalism, recognizing the latter as inevitable, Syndicalism repudiates and condemns present industrial arrangements as unjust and criminal, and holds out no hope to the worker for lasting results from this system. .Syndicalism, like the old trade unions, fights for immediate gains, but it is not stupid enough to pretend that labor can expect humane conditions from inhuman economic arrangements in society.[16]

For Goldman Syndicalism can be seen to present itself as a better moral deal for people than capitalism.

Syndicalism and Democracy

With the concept of syndicalism we find some like Chomsky who use terms such as &quot;council socialism&quot;[17] to describe the system, and people like Emma Goldman go so far as to speak harshly of the system by making references such as that of condemning the democratic nature by saying that we can not fight democracy with even more democracy.

The problem that Goldman has with democracy that leads her to her position is the following,

We say that if America has entered the war to make the world safe for democracy, she must first make democracy safe in America. How else is the world to take America seriously, when democracy at home is daily being outrages, free speech suppressed, peaceable assemblies broken up by overbearing and brutal gangsters in uniform; when free press is curtailed and every independent opinion gagged. Verily, poor as we are in democracy, how can we give of it to the world? We further say that a democracy conceived in the military servitude of the masses, in their economic enslavement, and nurtured in their tears and blood, is not democracy at all. It is despotism-the cumulative result of a chain of abuses which, according to the dangerous document, the Declaration of Independence, the people have the right to overthrow.[18]

Overall, Goldman appears to be advocating the removal of the democratic system itself in America by presenting a case against democracy as democracy is practiced in America; moreover, Goldman appears to favor syndicalism but not with a democratic system but instead with a naturally developed system that occurs as a result of experience for Goldman makes the case that syndicalism is born out of the experience of the common worker.

What can be said about anarchy is that the result of anarchy is not only disruption but complete disorder; moreover, look at the life of the anarchist Emma Goldman for example for she helped in a attempted assassination, encouraged people to steel bread, and encouraged free love at the same time as opposing almost every organization known to man.[19] The direct opposition however can be considered to be democracy, and with previous references some moral value can be placed in rejecting that view. The resulting views that thus stand are syndicalism or socialism.

My Conclusion

The real problem not being dealt with is not a matter of system of government but instead the values, desires, and goals of government. Truly if a love for money did not drive capitalism but instead the love for others, then the problems of the abuse of slavery in America would have never happened. If the purpose of government was ever to do what is truly good for the people instead of what benefits the people in command of government, then the result would be freedom from oppression. The sum of this case is that only by community having the correct values and the correct desires can a truly sound stable and unified community exist, and no amount of superficial indoctrination of any political system can achieve that goal.
