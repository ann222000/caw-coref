Chicken Pot Pie

1 lb. boned, skinned chicken, cubed
2 med. carrots, sliced thin
1 rib celery, sliced thin
1 cup frozen peas
1/3 cup butter
1 med. onion, chopped
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup milk
2 tsp. chicken base or 2 chicken bouillon cubes
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. black pepper
1/4 tsp. celery seed
(2) 9" un-baked pie crusts
1 Tbsp butter

Place chicken, carrots, and celery in a 2-quart saucepan. Pour enough water
over to cover all. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce heat to
medium, and simmer until meat is cooked through. Add peas to pot and simmer
for 1 minute. Drain water from pan, reserving 2 cups of the water; set aside
meat and vegetables.
In a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat, cook onions in 1/3 cup butter until
soft; stir in flour; slowly whisk in reserved water and milk; stir in soup
base/bouillon, salt, pepper, and celery seed. Simmer sauce until thick;
remove from heat; set aside.
Center one pie crust in a lightly greased 9" pie plate; spread cooked
chicken and vegetables evenly into crust; pour prepared sauce into crust.
Center second pie crust over pie; fold over edges and pinch with a fork to
seal; and prick holes in top of crust.
Bake at 425 F for 20 minutes. Cover edges of pie with aluminum foil and
bake an additional 10-15 minutes, or until crust is golden brown.
Rub 1 Tbsp butter over top of hot crust.
