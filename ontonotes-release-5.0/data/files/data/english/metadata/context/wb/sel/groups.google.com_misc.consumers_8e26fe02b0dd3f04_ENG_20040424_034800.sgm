Because of a new law that took effect 1/1/04, and was introduced
by Assemblyman John Benoit (R.-Riverside CA), my best friend
just got a ticket for not wearing his seat belt. The total fine?

$193.50.

I don't agree with seat belt laws in the first place, and in my view
if cops have nothing better to do than pull people over for not
wearing them, then we have far too many cops on the streets.

$193.50 is absolutely outrageous for a violation such as this.

Listen people. How much longer are we going to put up with
this trend towards fascism in the U.S.??

"/> Two weeks ago, one of my co-workers lost three family members in a
single-car crash. The family of nine was on their way back to the Bay
Area after a weekend in Vegas, IIRC. They drove at night to avoid
traffic. Before they cleared the mountains, the driver fell asleep and
hit the center divider. That woke him up, but he overcorrected and took
the late-model Chevy Suburban over the right shoulder off the road. The
truck rolled at least three times.

Seven people were ejected because they weren't wearing their seatbelts
(they had removed them to get comfortable while they slept). They were
all either killed or horribly maimed.

The remaining two who were strapped in suffered minor injuries; the
kind where you walk away under your own power and are treated onsite.

I'm sure that somewhere, someone is calculating the cost of the
immediate loss to the family and the public. Less likely is the totting
up of the cost to the various employers, the loss of the potential of
young lives and the future costs of care of those unable to care for
themselves.

I bet $193.50 wouldn't pay for even just a few seconds of that crash.

BTW, seatbelt laws (and &quot;nanny laws&quot; in general) do not a fascist state
make.

"/> So how does a seat belt law help in this situation? This is a family that
was inclined to actually wear seatbelts, but most weren't wearing them at
the time of the crash. Plus, the cause of the accident had nothing to do
with seat belt use or LACK OF seatbelt use. If the family members had been
violating the law by taking the seat belts off, they still would have taken
the seat belts off. Late at night when you are trying to get comfortable
while riding in a vehicle, you aren't going to hesitate to take the seat
belt off just because it's illegal to do so.

The cause of this accident was piss poor judgement on the part of the
driver. If he/she was sleepy, another driver should have taken the wheel
for a while. If no other drivers, then the driver should have stopped at
the nearest rest area to catch a couple of hours of sleep. A seat belt law
isn't going to prevent people from being so stupid as to drive while
sleeping. -Dave

Some people I know wear seat belts because they want to, and
some don't. Very few people I know are so pussy whipped that
they wear seat belts just because the state tells them to.

his doctor friend write him a medical release, stating he's unable
to wear a seatbelt because of his medical condition. He keeps
the letter in his truck. That's the last ticket for seat belt violation
he's ever going to get.

"/> Obviously, the event cannot be changed by law or any other known
remedy.

However, the fact remains that had the occupants been wearing
seatbelts, they would NOT have been ejected and would likely have
sustained no serious injuries. The state and federal governments, which
finance the public roads, have a vested interest in making them as safe
as possible. Failing that, they must administrate them (that is, they
must impose standards) such that when the worst does happen, events are
codified in some way.

Thus, you can condemn the driver for driving while tired (which is
against the law, BTW). Moreover, you know who to hold responsible.
Without such laws, the driver would have been perfectly within his
rights to drive in his impaired condition.

But that's not what they are for. Seatbelts are a proven-effective
defense against the results of stupid driver behavior, skill deficit
and lack of common sense (which isn't very common at all). That is the
reason for the law.

I disagree that people generally disobey the seatbelt law whenever they
want to. I think the seatbelt law was instrumental in causing drivers
and passengers to wear them in the first place; much more effective than
the PSAs which preceded them.

hard, documented measurement, not on casual, uninformed opinion. It
helps to have read Darwin, available online for free (not that I think
for a moment that you're really interested):

many books read by Darwin contributing to the construction of his theory
of evolution.

&gt; You keep trimming the main point from this debate. Some
&gt; people are smart enough to realize when they're too tired to

&gt; Some people aren't smart enough to do either one. That's

"/> Actually - I thought the point of the debate was use of seatbelts.

Are you just pissed off because you don't want to be forced to wear

"/> Silly (and untrue) as this is, it does show true nanny thinking. Few of
the laws affecting safety in this country today are unwarranted,
especially given the sad state of education levels of the populace.
Sorry, &quot;Darwinism&quot; (even though most who cite it have no clue what it is
all about; hint: it isn't just &quot;thinning the herd&quot;) remains no excuse
for allowing the innocent (or stupid, as some here would call them) to
be maimed or die.

Most pedestrians, for instance, are moving at far less than fifteen MPH
when they are killed by vehicle drivers.

"/> Actually, let's start with the most dangerous activity first and get all
those drivers and passengers in motor vehicles wearing approved
helmets...full fact, of course.

It's a numbers game. If there were as many bikers on the road as
unskilled drivers in SUVs, there might be merit to what you say about
it. If the number of skydiver corpses piling up began actually to make a
significant dent in the nation's population, well, there probably would
be legislative action. Same for all those other sports, most of which do
NOT rely on public facilities...like roads, for instance...and thus are
not subject to regulation.

It's always good to think outside of the box, but but at least try to
stay within the confines of the ballpark.

the values individuals place on it themselves. And everyone's metabolism
is different, and different foods will have different effects on different
people. Therefore, there is no logical reason to regulate food other than
for safety issues (standards of handling, canning, quality grading, etc.).

Alcohol has some of the same problems - millions can enjoy it without a
problem and others can't. I am for very strict driving under the
influence laws (driving is a privilege, not a right) and support drinking
age laws but don't believe in outlawing it.

Guns, I would say the same as alcohol. Laws which reduce risks but don't
stop responsible citizens from owning them. Breathing has risks too but I
wouldn't outlaw it. Again, it is control of the bad effects that needs to
be monitored, not an outright ban on the product/conduct.

Tobacco - well, I'd like to say that if people smoke they waive their
right to public health care (Medicad, Medicare) because I find it
extremely annoying that smokers are inhaling a substance totally
unnecessary to life (unlike food). But I don't particularly want to see
the effects of untreated diseases from smoking or have people dying on the
streets, so I guess smokers get a free pass from me.

It's really common sense, so I can't understand why you don't &quot;get&quot; it.
That's the basis of lawmaking - to create community standards that
everyone adheres to to make it possible to live in peace with those around
you (and criminal and civil penalties for those that don't). Laws don't
always meet that test, especially if you have a libertarian bend, but that
doesn't mean the system doesn't, in general, work towards that goal.

to show proof of an insurance policy that will pay for the costs of your
smoking-related health problems.

Of course, an individual smoker might find such a policy unavailable or
unaffordable but that's a risk I'm willing for them to face.

you expect (more about that later), only minority activities will have
to sacrifice for &quot;the common good&quot;.

For example, the chances of a severe head injury are lower in a car
accident than on a motorcycle but since there are many times more cars
than bikers on the street, auto drivers as a group suffer more head
injuries and incur more associated medical and disability expenses than
motorcyclists. Do you think the same car drivers who voted to make
motorcyclists wear helments, will vote in a law making car drivers wear
helmets?
