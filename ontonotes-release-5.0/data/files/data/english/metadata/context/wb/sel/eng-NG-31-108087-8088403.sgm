Hi. I just bought this motorcycle a few weeks ago, and after I put
about 50 miles on it there was a rapid decrease in power. It's so bad
now that I can't ride it up a hill. Sometimes I drive down the road,
and the engine reeves, but it doesn't increase in speed. I down shift,
but the same thing happens in the lower gears too. Also I noticed that
it has difficulty shifting gears.  When I took into the shop, they
said that the clutch has to be rebuilt. But the bike only has 700
miles on it. I know it sat in the garage for a few years with the
previous owner (it's a 2004), but this seems REALLY odd to me. I went
ahead and ordered the parts to rebuilt the clutch. But I really don't
have any mechanical knowledge, and I'm a little suspect that there
might be something strange going on. Has anyone heard of this and can
verify to me that it does sound like the clutch?

I just want a few more opinions. Thanks so much!

Shira

Sounds like a dead clutch to me. I have a CD250, which has the same
basic engine, and clutches seem slightly short-lived on it, but still -
700 miles, it should be fine.

If it's been standing, it could be a seized up cable or simple bad
adjustment by a hamfisted owner. Check the cable adjustment.

It sounds like somebody tried to adjust the clutch cable and screwed the
adjuster on the handlebar all the way out.

If you pull on the clutch cable housing, you should have about 0.040&quot; free
play.

0.040&quot; is about the thickness of a dime.

18: BOLT, CABLE ADJ.

22: NUT, FIXING

If you don't have the free play, loosen #22 and turn #18 clockwise, then
tighten #22 again.

Is the bike still under warranty? If so, take it back to the dealer.

After three years? What do you think?
