&quot;Every time we think, 'Oh, my God, I have so much to do
and I don't know how I can do it,' we can change our
thinking.  We can place all our burdens in the hands of
God, ask for a miracle, and thank Him in advance for
providing it.  We will stop being so tense; we will stop
being so worried; we will stop living a life so devoid of
joy.  The lying ego will say things like, 'I can't do that!
I have responsibilities!'  Yet, that's exactly the point:
once we've lightened up, we attract the people and
circumstances that provide us the means to effortlessly
accomplish a task.&quot;

&quot;Digging Deep

Underneath the layer of our normal thinking lies a level
of consciousness that is pure love and peace.  Yet we
cannot reach that consciousness simply by deciding to;
we have to dig deep into the ground of our inner being,
creating a space of listening for the 'small still voice
of God.'  The more things are happening on the outside,
the more important it is to find that stillness on the
inside.

Every mistake we ever made occurred because, in the
moment we made it, we were not in conscious contact
with our highest self.  We were not centered in our
spirit.  That is why making that contact, and spending
time each day fostering it, is the single most powerful
thing we can do.&quot;

Excerpts from Marianne Williamson's &quot;The Gift of
Change:  spiritual guidance for living your best life&quot;,

That doesn't sound to me like 'walking in the Holy Spirit'; more like
'blackmailing the Holy Spirit'.  When the method fails (as it will) the
follower of that philosophy can now blame God and ignore the fact that
they surrendered all responsibility for their own progress and expected a
miracle that didn't come in the form or time they desired.  Likewise, if
they do experience any form of success, they can't congratulate themselves
for it, as they did nothing to earn it having surrendered all
responsibility ... while at the same time paying no heed at all to
anything the Holy Spirit might have been trying to communicate.

This isn't 'spiritual' or 'religious', it's un-Christian superstitious
nonsense.

This sort of claptrap might sell books to the terminally gullible, of
which there is sadly no shortage, but that doesn't change it from being
quackery.  Quack quack quack, she goes, raking in the fools' money.

At some level radical acceptance, and perhaps in Christian terms
surrender to God's will, would seem to be wholesome. By acceptance I
don't mean acquiescence, nor passivity. Rather, it is the willingness to
live and embrace life as it unfolds rather than kicking and screaming
because the world isn't the way we want it to be.

This &quot;law of attraction&quot; is the newest wrinkle in the prosperity gospel.
If Christ had only known this, he wouldn't have spent his time in
relative poverty and obscurity. Too bad. He was just born too early to
be a Christian with a birthright of wealth. Rather he frittered his life
away with stuff like the Sermon on the Mount.

People will gladly fork over money so they can hope for something. Those

In Christian terms, surrendering to God's will involves choosing to live
one's life according to what one believes God wants it to be.  That's the
opposite of what Williamson et al promote (which is to make one's own
plans for one's own purposes but require God to make them happen).

Yes, what was he thinking of?  If he'd just chilled out and waited for a
miracle, he might have become a real worldly king and at least the other
kings wouldn't have been so nasty to him.

|
| The media has often misidentified Williamson as a Christian minister.
|
| Williamson has been spiritual director of Renaissance Unity, formerly
| called Church of Today, in Warren, Michigan from 1998 to 2002.
|
| Renaissance Unity is affiliated with the Unity School of Christianity,
| which is - theologically - a cult of Christianity:
|
|   The Unity School of Christianity is a classic new age cult. It has the
|   appearance of being Christian; however, it holds pantheistic or new age
|   beliefs at its core. Unity was founded by Charles and Myrtle Fillmore
|   in 1889, and was later incorporated as a church in 1903 by the Unity
|   Society of Practical Christianity in Kansas City. Unity is best known
|   by its publication The Daily Word, used by many who are unaware of its
|   doctrinal positions.
|   - Source: Russ White, Probe Ministries: Unity School of Christianity

| Probe Ministries
| Unity School of Christianity
| Russ Wise
|
| [...]
|
| Unity attempts to denigrate the Atonement of Christ in order to build a
| better case for reincarnation; however, the Atonement delivers man from
| the cyclical concept of rebirth. Reincarnation does not offer us either
| peace or hope. The Atonement offers us peace because we do not have to
| rely on our own righteousness, and it offers us hope because of what Jesus
| did on the cross. Jesus has dealt with our sin on the cross and our
| response is to simply accept His work on our behalf.
|
| [...]
|
| Unity is, in my opinion, the most deceptive of the cultic groups that use
| the word Christian in their name. Unity's distinction is that the follower
| of its teaching is encouraged to remain in his respective church home
| whether it be Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, or whatever. The followers
| of Unity considers their denominational affiliation as a mission field
| where they can subtly disseminate their ideas.

&quot;We need this.&quot; You know, it's like, &quot;I understand that,&quot; but there
are
millions of us who feel that our hearts have gone wherever our hearts
have gone. But as far as being a Jew is concerned, you're born a Jew,
you die a Jew.

ABERNETHY: And when you think about the words &quot;Jesus Christ,&quot;
what do you think about?

Ms. WILLIAMSON: I feel that there is, deep within you and deep within
me and deep within every human being, an essence, which is the truth
of who we are, which is that which is created by God himself. It is
not
just in you identical to that in me, it is that in me. It is literally
a
oneness -- not metaphorically, but literally a oneness, and if you put
together that essence, joined together, of every living thing, every
human
being, one of its names is Jesus.&quot;

Abernethy's question is not a rhetorical trap, it is perfectly reasonable

On the contrary Marianne speaks of a &quot;miraculous intercessionary

Williamson&quot;
SRQ thread of Nov 10) that dovetails perfectly with a certain point
Rev. Henry
Buckwalter made this morning in his sermon at &quot;Good Shepherd
Christian Fellowship&quot; in Needham, Mass USA.

IOW, if Whiskers reads Marianne's 2004 book (a section of which he
called &quot;claptrap&quot;), he will see it uses Christian terminology all over
the place.
Thus, Whiskers is DEAD WRONG to call it heresy and should correct
himself in public for his error.

Furthermore, Marianne Williamson is most definitely Jewish if the
reader
reads ANYTHING at all in her biography.  I myself got to assess her
JEWISHNESS at Brandeis University, a Jewish college, where she
gave an inspirational talk last spring because I was there.

So, she has a strikingly broad definition on being a Christian that
I personally agree with because of my extensive background in
Eastern Religion (Indian, Chinese, Japanese) and extensive past
membership in RSOF.

To some extent I believe the argument Whiskers and I are having
over narrow versus broad definition of Christian is not settled in
the modern world and requires further dialogue among a broad
range of Christians in numerous settings to reach consensus.

I would like Friends to be part of that dialogue.

Nevertheless, the Apostles' creed is the established means by which a
person can determine who is and is not a Christian.  Those (like you) who
say it is 'incorrect', and those (like Williamson) who preach in direct
contradiction to it, are thereby identified very clearly as not Christian.

That at least some Quaker groups welcome people who are avowedly not
Christians, is neither here nor there in this matter.  Nor is the fact that
Quakers are not required to embrace any creed.  There is some doubt among
credal Christians as to whether or not the Religious Society of Friends can
honestly be called a Christian society, precisely because of those points -
even though there is little doubt that many Quakers are indeed Christian.

You can call a spade a satellite dish as loudly and often as you like, but
it will still be a spade and nothing else.  Anyone who tries to use it as
a satellite dish is almost certain to fail to get any signal at all, or at
best a very weak, confusing, unreliable, and distorted, signal.

While I agree with your general point, I don't think every use of the Christian language outside of
traditional Christian doctrine is an attempt to deceive. I'm not Christian, yet I sometimes use the
language of Christianity to communicate with Christian relatives when I can do so honestly. I wrote a
funeral reading a few months ago, where I used Christ, God, and some scriptural references in a way
that accurately conveyed what I meant to a Christian audience. What I wrote was truthful, but their
notions of God, Christ, and even what that scripture meant would differ from mine substantially. I find it
awkward and unhelpful to declare myself non-Christian at every point so everyone will understand that
I don't believe what they do.

For example, I quoted the scripture that &quot;a man will reap what he sows.&quot; I believe that in a much
stronger sense than some Christians who believe some prior divine forgiveness wipes out the past
and present misdeeds. This particular person has lived a life of integrity and kindness. I believe he will
reap that, but probably not in some Christian heaven like the audience will assume.

So, I don't condemn people for using the terminology of Christianity if the intent is to communicate
honestly in language and context that will make sense to them.

In the broad definition of Christian all that is required of any RSOF

&gt;&gt; faith to such an extent that your abberrant heretical notions can be
&gt;&gt; embraced.  That doesn't mean it will ever happen - and I for one
&gt;&gt; intend to see that it doesn't.

&gt; While I agree with your general point, I don't think every use of the
&gt; Christian language outside of traditional Christian doctrine is an
&gt; attempt to deceive. I'm not Christian, yet I sometimes use the language
&gt; of Christianity to communicate with Christian relatives when I can do so
&gt; honestly. I wrote a funeral reading a few months ago, where I used
&gt; Christ, God, and some scriptural references in a way that accurately
&gt; conveyed what I meant to a Christian audience. What I wrote was truthful,
&gt; but their notions of God, Christ, and even what that scripture meant
&gt; would differ from mine substantially. I find it awkward and unhelpful to
&gt; declare myself non-Christian at every point so everyone will understand
&gt; that I don't believe what they do.

&gt; For example, I quoted the scripture that &quot;a man will reap what he sows.&quot;
&gt; I believe that in a much stronger sense than some Christians who believe
&gt; some prior divine forgiveness wipes out the past and present misdeeds.
&gt; This particular person has lived a life of integrity and kindness. I
&gt; believe he will reap that, but probably not in some Christian heaven like
&gt; the audience will assume.

&gt; So, I don't condemn people for using the terminology of Christianity if
&gt; the intent is to communicate honestly in language and context that will
&gt; make sense to them.

I have no quarrel with that; you were using language honestly and not
trying to twist meanings or lead anyone astray.

As no-one here (apart presumably from you) was at that meeting, no-one here
has any idea what the speaker said or meant, so your referring to it has
no meaning unless you can point to a reliable transcript or recording that
we can all access if we want to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; What does the phrase &quot;miraculous intercessionary shift&quot; actually mean, and
&gt;&gt; in what context?

&gt; Do your own homework by getting into Williamson via her books instead
&gt; of relying on other people for your opinion.  Do your own thinking at
&gt; a deeper level.

Support your own argument or shut up.  Don't try to insult my thinking.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt; IOW, if Whiskers reads Marianne's 2004 book (a section of which he
&gt;&gt; &gt; called &quot;claptrap&quot;), he will see it uses Christian terminology all over
&gt;&gt; &gt; the place.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, Whiskers is DEAD WRONG to call it heresy and should correct
&gt;&gt; &gt; himself in public for his error.

&gt;&gt; Using Christian terminology does not make the user or the message in any
&gt;&gt; way Christian - particularly when the terms are re-defined by the user to
&gt;&gt; mean something quite different from their Christian usage.  Abernethy gave
&gt;&gt; Williamson a perfect opportunity to explain herself, and she failed
&gt;&gt; utterly (she was barely coherent, in the transcript you posted).

&gt; On the contrary she has gone to the Christian side from her Jewish
&gt; background with dignity, grace, and eloquence.
">

I don't dispute that she's 'left her Jewish side'; I did say she is
apostate.  But she shows no sign of having come anywhere near Christanity
other than to steal and subvert some of the words.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; One of the most serious criticisms of Williamson and her ilk is that they
&gt;&gt; misuse and subvert traditional Christian terminology with the clear
&gt;&gt; intention of tricking the gullible and ignorant into thinking that they
&gt;&gt; are in some way presenting a Christian message - which they are not.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Furthermore, Marianne Williamson is most definitely Jewish if the
&gt;&gt; &gt; reader
&gt;&gt; &gt; reads ANYTHING at all in her biography.  I myself got to assess her
&gt;&gt; &gt; JEWISHNESS at Brandeis University, a Jewish college, where she
&gt;&gt; &gt; gave an inspirational talk last spring because I was there.

&gt;&gt; Good pubic speaking skills are just that, nothing more; they prove
&gt;&gt; nothing.  Being of Jewish birth is no guide to that person's religious
&gt;&gt; ideas.  I have nothing to say about the circumstances of her birth,
&gt;&gt; they're irrelevant; I look at her words and deeds - and those show that
&gt;&gt; her religion (if she has one at all) is neither Jewish nor Christian.

&gt; You don't show you have read any of her books or listened to her
&gt; tapes.
&gt; Thus, your criticism is tainted.
">

Her own words show that she is not a Christian.  If she claims to be a
Christian (which she does, by associating with an organisation that calls
itself Christian but clearly is not) then she is lying and deceiving.  Why
would I want to read more of her lies?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt; So, she has a strikingly broad definition on being a Christian that
&gt;&gt; &gt; I personally agree with because of my extensive background in
&gt;&gt; &gt; Eastern Religion (Indian, Chinese, Japanese) and extensive past
&gt;&gt; &gt; membership in RSOF.

&gt;&gt; She is not a Christian and nor is her message or intention.  That she
&gt;&gt; pretends otherwise serves only to compound her error and the evil it leads
&gt;&gt; to.

&gt;&gt; &gt; To some extent I believe the argument Whiskers and I are having
&gt;&gt; &gt; over narrow versus broad definition of Christian is not settled in
&gt;&gt; &gt; the modern world and requires further dialogue among a broad
&gt;&gt; &gt; range of Christians in numerous settings to reach consensus.

&gt;&gt; I'm sure that non-Christians such as you and Williamson would be hugely
&gt;&gt; pleased for genuine Christians to forget and distort their faith to such
&gt;&gt; an extent that your abberrant heretical notions can be embraced.  That
&gt;&gt; doesn't mean it will ever happen - and I for one intend to see that it
&gt;&gt; doesn't.

&gt; RED FLAG - I am a non-ordained Christian minister.
">

Red herring.  I too am non-ordained, as it happens.  But I don't claim to
be a Christian while proclaiming beliefs that contradict that claim.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt; I would like Friends to be part of that dialogue.

&gt;&gt; I'll bet you would!
&gt;&gt;...

&gt; In the broad definition of Christian all that is required of any RSOF
&gt; Meeting is for anybody in their Worship to speak from the heart to the
&gt; group with a mention of Jesus Christ and the New Testament - that act
&gt; sanctifies.
">

Prove it.

What you are saying is that if you were to stand up and say (as you do
here) that the New Testament is a fake record of things that didn't happen
and contains secret messages that mean something entirely different to the
cognoscenti, and that Jesus was nothing more than a normal man who did not
die on the cross and went on to marry twice, etc, etc, that that somehow
'sanctifies' something.  That's nonsense.

I myself am unable to find anything in her record that directly
indicates
that she tells the public that she is Christian.

I say she is Christian according to my broad definition because she
has shown me enough.

IMHO Jesus Christ had fateful &quot;divine seed&quot; (George Fox's term)  if
only because
more has been written on him than anybody else in all history.

I believe that the NT is no longer an authority for modern times on
the subject
of sexual ethics, yet reverence for OT &amp; NT must be retained in order
to preserve
the Christian religion within an extremely broad definition for the
sake of social stability.
