Hello just bought a Sage 1201 it's a smaller reel with an offset
gears.. I fished with it twice and really think it is a great solid
little reel. But when I took the spool off I noticed that the main
shaft gear had rust on all the teeth. I fished in a light drizzle with
it other than that kept it as dry as I could given the fact that I'm
standing in water and my line is wet from water etc. etc...the reel
still operates fine. Just wondering if I should be concerned? or if
there is anything that I could apply to prevent/remove further
rusting?
Any Tips appreciated.

Have you cleaned off the rust?
1. If yes you have cleaned off the rust so Sage could not see it, I would
take the reel fishing one more time and then disassemble it and look for
rust'
a. if you DO find rust after one more use go to 2 below.
b. if you do NOT find rust, then presume the original rust was due to
not oiled originally.  Watch the reel closely for rust and if rust reappears
after cleaning go to 2. below
2. If you have NOT cleaned off the rust,
Immediately take the reel back where you bought it and ask for your money
back or substitute another reel.
3. Go fish and then look for rust on your new reel. Go to 1 above, if you
have rust.

Good luck!
Go fish.
John

If it´s rusty anywhere, then it is defective.If gears are rusty on the
teeth, they will usually bind and fail before too long, and the rust
will cause excessive wear.  Reels should not rust in freshwater.
Freshwater reels may corrode slightly when used in salt or brackish
water, because they are not designed for it, but no reel should rust
in fresh water.

As the other gentleman advised, take it back and ask for your money
back. Before you do so, make sure it actually is rust. I have had
people bring &quot;rusty&quot; reels to me, and the &quot;rust&quot; was in fact
lubricating grease.  This comes in a number of colours and types, and
some of it can look a bit like rust.

PS, if you fish in &quot;muddy&quot; streams, or get mud on the line etc,  some
of the deposits left on the reel when it dries can also look like
rust.

No it's rust. Shop won't take it back say it is a Sage problem. Trying
to get a hold of Sage but having trouble actually talking to anyone so
I sent an email. We'll see. Worst case here can I regrease it and hope
it holds?. It's working fine now but that could change.
Thanks for the replies.

I would say as long as you keep it cleaned up between uses, you should be
fine till getting it replaced. I think I would find a new shop!

It won´t break immediately, especially if you keep it cleaned and
greased, but a new reel that goes rusty is just bad news. Once things
start rusting, they tend to continue, and once there are pits on the
gears, you will have problems.  I can´t really figure out why any
manufacturer would use materials that might rust, even in a &quot;cheap&quot;
reel.

As far as I am aware, the shop is bound to take it back if it is
defective. The seller is responsible that goods he sells are fit for
their intended purpose, and a reel that rusts most patently is not!

I am not au fait with the exact merchandising laws in America, but
that is the case here. Before you waste time, money and effort running
after Sage, go to your local chamber of commerce, and explain the
problem. They will usually persuade the dealer to take it back, and
refund your money.

The reel is not listed on the Sage site,
http://www.sageflyfish.com/default.asp?p=58

Furthermore, if the dealer tells you it is a &quot;Sage problem&quot; he is
merely trying to get out of his responsibilities. If he means that it
is a known problem, he could also be liable for knowingly selling
defective and unsuitable goods.

Lastly some &quot;cheap&quot; equipment is not really a good idea. If it sounds
too good to be  true, then it usually is!  There are plenty of
reasonably priced reliable reels from reputable dealers, and you would
be well advised to go that route, once you solve your problem.

These things can be difficult to resolve. But there is no point
hanging on to a defective reel.

And if those layabouts at the Chamber don't immediately go tar and
feather that crooked sumbitch reel huckster, call Fulbright and Jaworski
at 1 212 318 30...um, look it up...and don't settle for any associates
or other nonsense.  Tell them you want a partner in the &quot;Rusty Reels&quot;
section.  Also, call the local police, the sheriff, and the FBI.  Don't
take no for an answer - stand your ground!  You know your rights!  Tell
'em Mike Connor told you that you was robbed!  Then go back to the
dealer and beat him senseless with a sock full of moldy sauerkraut -
that'll teach that sorry, evil spawn of the goddamned devil himself!

If you get no satisfaction, go buy a 3-axis CNC, and build a replacement
part out of a billet of titanium, and see if someone like
Northrop-Grumman or the like can put some badass supersecret military
coating on the whole thing, just to make sure.

...or maybe just another day or two and see if Sage responds...eh,
either route...

Some alloys of stainless steel have a tendency to create a fine layer of
&quot;hard rust&quot; which actually works as a protectant and hardner for wear on
those surfaces, and is not considered a detriment, or flaw in the
material. That said, I have 3 pfleuger 1492's that are 40 or more years
old, have been used in all kinds of adverse water conditions, including
salt, that show no signs of ruat whatsoever. Personally, I'd be furious
if I spent the money on a brand name like sage, only to have it rust.

Well thanks for the replies. It's a shame , I'm ...well..rather
&quot;financially challenged&quot;,  and made a decision based on name and
reputation and I'm sure it's a rare case. But I'm calling sage
um...often and leaving messages getting nowhere. I'm sure it's not a
priority to deal with a guy who bought one of their low end reels. But
you live and learn I'll keep trying and get to the bottom of it or
fish it till it freezes...Hopefully they will return my calls.

I'm curious as to what number you are calling? When i've called, I
always get to talk to a person, and have never needed to leave a

All he's got to do is threaten to post a note about his problems on
http://groups.google.co.uk/group/Flycorner?hl=en the most widely

Yeah, that works every time. ;-)

Apparently Bill is the only guy at Sage who deals with reels.
I have an old Sage 5400 and I had a few questions about it so
I was directed to Bill. He took awhile getting back to me but
he did return email.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm curious as to what number you are calling? When i've called, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; always get to talk to a person, and have never needed to leave a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; message. Maybe you're trying after Sage business hours? Or maybe i'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just lucky? ;-)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brians
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No I get an operator and ask for reel repair they transfer meee..rings
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; twice, then a voice mail for Bill comes on everytime...so I leave Bill
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a message.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Call back and tell him you're from the Chamber of Commerce...

&gt;Yeah, that works every time. ;-)

&gt;Apparently Bill is the only guy at Sage who deals with reels.
&gt;I have an old Sage 5400 and I had a few questions about it so
&gt;I was directed to Bill. He took awhile getting back to me but
&gt;he did return email.

&gt;&gt; All he's got to do is threaten to post a note about his problems on
&gt;&gt; http://groups.google.co.uk/group/Flycorner?hl=en the most widely
&gt;&gt; read, most authorative fly fishing site in the world.  Sage will send
&gt;&gt; him two or three new reels rather than challenge the power behind that
&gt;&gt; web site.

&gt;LOL !! That explains the latest infestation of roff by
&gt;His Silly Mikeness, he got tired of talking to himself.

OK, I did something I rarely do, and visited the link.  And in doing so,
I saw another link (from one of the few other posters to the &quot;group,&quot;
another &quot;Mike&quot;) that looked interesting, and thought, hey, what the
hell, in for a penny, in for a pound...

And here's why, at least for a time, I'll just revert to my policy of &quot;I
don't visit other fishing groups, VBBs, etc.&quot;:

Hey dumbo,

that is a discussion group, not a website.  It has only been on line
for a month or so, is mainly concerned, to date, with a specific type
of fly- fishing, and I don´t want dumbos on there anyway, they merely
waste other people´s time.

The quite simple rules, as stated on the home page, would preclude
many on ROFF using it in any case.

Have you ever managed to post a single message, here or anywhere else,
which was not full of mistakes? Quite apart from extremely silly and
gratuitous insults, mostly connected with matters about which you are
obviously woefully ignorant.

Before one leaps aboard various bandwagons, one should first ascertain
whether any of the occupants can play, as otherwise one merely
contributes to the general dissonance.

Trumpeters are especially prone to this.

OK, just to be totally fair, I did.  And guess what?  Not only is that
video reachable from your little group, it was _you_ who posted the
link.  I didn't dig around the first time, and simply thought that you
were member &quot;Mike Connor&quot; and the other member, &quot;Mike,&quot; was not only a
different member, but the (self-promoting) &quot;Mike Lindsey&quot; in the video,
since the post was from &quot;Mike,&quot; not &quot;Mike Connor.&quot;  But it turns out
that you are both &quot;Mike Connor&quot; AND &quot;Mike.&quot;  Again, it should speak for
itself:

(What you see on the &quot;short list&quot;, showing posted by member &quot;Mike,&quot;
rather than member &quot;Mike Connor,&quot; on Aug 3.)

&quot;Some of the really top books available for free here, ( which I found
out while looking for something else, and after spending three weeks
typing some books into my computer!  Dohhhhhhh!).

http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22Flies%2C%20Artif ...
(sic)

Search also on &quot;fishing&quot;.

First class scans, and various options, also the ful text as text!&quot;

However, when you go to the &quot;full view,&quot; you see a signature added:

&quot;TL
MC&quot;

and when one clicks on the link to &quot;fly fishing&quot; on the page _you_
posted, one goes to:

http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22fly%20fishing%22

and there, the direct link I posted is (at least currently) the first
&quot;really top book&quot;  I also found it interesting that listed directly on
the link you posted is at least one &quot;really top book&quot; you dismissed as
nonsense when I referred to it some years back as evidence you, yet
again, were not the last word on all things fishing.

Well dumbo, when one posts a link to a media site which refers to
books, one assumes that the people who will use such a link will have
the sense to enter the media type in the search box.

Of course, dumbos don´t possess the required sense to do this.

I snip to save wasting bandwidth, it was once considered polite to do

You could save a lot of wasted  bandwidth by not posting at all.

You can on a 1498.
I have a 1498 I bought in 1963.   A couple of years ago I bought a
1598 wiht the RC spools.  The spools interchanged with 63 model.
The two spools with the old reel were a little different, one had a
bushing that had to be put on the shaft before the spool.  The other
spool had the bushing attached to the spool. A pain to keep from
loosing that little bushing. I kept it tied to the reel with a twist-
tie.
The Chinese made Medalist were real a real POS.   Goodwill got mine
not long after I bought it.
The old 1498 is on the shelf, where it will remain..  Compaired to the
Trion it's like a museum piece.
The old one caught it's share of fish and bloodied a few knuckles.

Indeed?  Well dumbo, you don´t seem to know much about anything, and
you can´t even spell most of it either, but it does not stop you
posting the crap.

My last reply to you as well, because you are just a dumbo, and not
worthy of a reply anyway, quite apart from the wasted bandwidth.  You
can also rest assured that the newbies and others are taking note of
your silly behaviour, and resolving not to have anything at all to do

&gt; You can on a 1498.
&gt; I have a 1498 I bought in 1963.   A couple of years ago I bought a
&gt; 1598 wiht the RC spools.  The spools interchanged with 63 model.
&gt; The two spools with the old reel were a little different, one had a
&gt; bushing that had to be put on the shaft before the spool.  The other
&gt; spool had the bushing attached to the spool. A pain to keep from
&gt; loosing that little bushing. I kept it tied to the reel with a twist-
&gt; tie.
&gt; The Chinese made Medalist were real a real POS.   Goodwill got mine
&gt; not long after I bought it.
&gt; The old 1498 is on the shelf, where it will remain..  Compaired to the
&gt; Trion it's like a museum piece.
&gt; The old one caught it's share of fish and bloodied a few knuckles.- Hide quoted text -

&quot;The Chinese made Medalist were real a real POS&quot;
ha! that's what I figured haven't spooled it up yet. It's brand new,
got it with new  backing,  and new dt5f for 25$ can't complain
much...having bad luck with reels lately..fishing a 5wt ..fish are
small this year.Although the Steelhead come in the fall, I really
don't like fishing shoulder to shoulder with guys saying things like
&quot;Let's slay these bastards&quot; kinda like watching an execution in a
phone booth while stading at a urinal..no fish is worth giving up the
solitude....so I'm gonna pass this year. reel holds the line really,
only once did a drag come into play... maybe I should look at a usa
medalist. Just want something I can
rely on really and not worry about..nothing fancy...if anyone has one
they want to sell let me know..Or I'll try this one out and see what
happens, what for that rust bucket to come back...
thanks again,
Brian

You didn't get it the first time, so here it is again snipped
to the bare essentials;

&quot;you offer authoritative and pompous advice on every subject
under the sun, many of which you know nothing about&quot;

For example in this thread alone you've expounded on American
consumer protection laws and insulted the intelligence of
anyone who can Google by posting some marginally related links
to Pflueger reels it took you three seconds to cut and paste.

Yeah, you have no use for roff. You keep saying that. You're
only here for the newbies. That makes sense because anybody
who knows anything about fly fishing would consider much of
what you authoritatively proclaim to be silly twaddle.

I have had two Medalist 1498s, one 1598, two 1495-1/2s ( bought as
part of a package for a weekend- they went to Goodwill ) and two
1492s.
The 1492s are jewels and still used.  There a couple of them on eBay
right now and I would advise anyone looking for good small reel to
check them out.
The biggest fish I have caught on the oldest 1498 was a king of about
30-35 lbs. Do you still have that picture of that dead sea-run brown
you found on the beach in Denmark?
The new chinese reels will work fine for a lot of situations.  I have
never had a reel fail. Using good equipment adds to esthetic pleasures
of fishing.  Well designed and engineered equipment is a work of art.
Most of the trout I have caught I could have caught with a cane
pole. .   It's not the money you spend that makes the experience.
One of the best fly reels I have is a Zebco.  It's made by Abbu in
Sweden and I would buy a couple more if I could find them.  They are
one of the first reels to have a disk drag.  I got them 30 years ago.
They still work fine.
I told janumu what I know.  I'll bet he's smart enough to filter
what I and others have said and make an intelligent decision. Even if
he doesn't aggree with me he's not a dumbo.  And BTW I'll bet he knows
how to google as well as you.

I know what the word means and I also know that most of
us would not presume to post authoritatively on subjects
of which we had little or no knowledge. Without getting
into too much psychobabble the reason you do this is
obvious to folks who read a little about your background
when you posted it to roff. You're an uneducated man with
nothing more than the American equivalent of a high school
diploma and a few trade school type certificates and this
has given you an inferiority complex here on roff, one of
the most erudite corners of cyberspace.

And it's so unnecessary. Stick to what you know and realize
that a lot of folks here have also been fly fishing for
40 years. A lot of folks on this newsgroup know a great deal
about fly fishing and disagreeing with you does not make them
&quot;dumbos&quot;. You know a lot about fly fishing too, I own a
Franco Vivarelli reel based on your posts to roff and it's
been a godsend for muskie fishing, but you're not the be all
and end all of fly fishing experts, you're a guy who posts to
roff just like all the rest of us.
