Well if I didn't have this group to gush to, that might be true.. but I'm
GREAT at keeping secrets, especially when I have ulterior motives.  If the
girl-child knew a puppy was definitely on the way, I'd having nothing to
hold over her to make her do all that I want her to do in preparation.

I may not tell her until I show up with the puppy at home!

How certain are you about that?  Mind you, if she's getting
around Mom's interhoohah policies I doubt she's making a
beeline for rpdb.

Anyway, my experience with kids on mailing lists/bulletin
boards is that it's one thing if they listen in but they 1)
tend to contribute on topics they know nothing about (my
favorite was some kid in California lecturing Alaskans on
how to keep warm when winter camping), and 2) often won't
deal all that well with the inevitable response.

Absolutely certain.  I've got her locked out of everything by default, so
there are very few places she can actually go.  I also look over her
shoulder a lot, so she doesn't spend a lot of time messing around on the
computer, hehe.  She's more into her art anyway.

When she's doing homework with MS applications, the internet access is
turned off.  I'm such a meanie pants!

Oh, and on a related note, I'm very proud of my 16 year old son's computer
habits.  I've gradually given him more and more freedom with his computer,
yet he still asks me every single time before registering for any
discussion groups (he goes to gaming forums).

What he doesn't know is that I check on his activities on a very regular
basis.  Should I be concerned that he doesn't look at any porn whatsoever??

Unlike some, I can chew gum and walk.

No one here offers help to more people than I do. And the name calling
started when the usual suspects took offense when I said that Suja
said something stupid.

I reserve the right to call someone on stupid shit, whether she's a
"friend" of yours or not!

You're now a part of that same piranha mentality that's poisoned this
newsgroup for years.

No, I don't chime in on the seemingly endless threads having to do
with "fleecy wraps," telling people how to raise their own children,
etc. and other mindless endeavors.

My "timeouts," if you will, occur when I visit the freak show that is
r.p.d.b., not when I'm working for a living.

Knowing Roxy, I think that will be tough, but I'll definitely keep a close
eye on all their interactions.

I know my older cat will take the new puppy in stride (he loves everyone),
but it'll be interesting to see how the kitten adapts.  Hopefully he'll
just realize he will have 2 waggy tails to play with instead of only 1.

Oh, those little girls are manipulative, I tell you!!

By the way, I wanted to name our daughter Emily, but my husband vetoed me
