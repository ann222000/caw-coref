I am glad to see the title of article one, because a battle, as in a war, is
what it is.  And it is the entire world that is coming in war today, against
Jerusalem.  With Bush's boy Olmert appointed to the office of PM, we know
that the war is to be lost.  That is Bush's intent as America, under the
command of 'Bush the Great', works so effectively to completely destroy all
democracy, and all freedom in the world. Why does Bush wish to destroy
Israel, to wipe it out of existence?  Perhaps it is Adolph Bush's desire to
destroy any evidence that a 'real god', ever existed.  That way the Bush's
'new world order', &quot;Zieg Heil!&quot;, can come into being.

1. Rabbi Elyashiv Joins Battle For Jerusalem

by Ezra HaLevi

In the opening shot of the battle for Jerusalem, top rabbis of the
Hareidi-religious and Jerusalemite communities have joined Rabbi Avraham
Shapira's final statement against dividing Jerusalem.

A large gathering planned for Sunday at the Ramban Synagogue in the Old City
is being organized by Chief Rabbi of the Old City, Rabbi Avigdor Nebenzahl
and Rabbi Eliyahu Medina. Joining the protest is Rabbi Yosef Shalom
Elyashiv, considered the head of the Lithuanian Hareidi-religious public.

The assembly is being called under the banner &quot;Over Jerusalem they cast
lots&quot; - a verse from Ovadiah (1:11) - and will include &quot;prayers and
supplications to G-d.&quot;

The event will begin after the 12:30 PM afternoon prayer at the synagogue,
which is located in the Jewish Quarter's main square.

Earlier this month, Vice-Premier Chaim Ramon outlined his political

6735DBD637488.htm&gt;  plan for dividing Jerusalem, saying: &quot;The Jewish
neighborhoods will be recognized by both sides as Israeli neighborhoods
under Israeli sovereignty. Likewise, Arab neighborhoods such as Shuafat will
be recognized as Palestinian neighborhoods. There will be arrangements to
ensure, free, safe passages between the various Israeli neighborhoods and
likewise between the Palestinian ones.&quot;

With regard to the Old City, Ramon wrote: &quot;On the matter of the &quot;holy basin&quot;
- as the area including the Temple Mount and other holy sites is being
referred to - there will be a special authority that will include the
expression of Israel's special interests and manage the holy sites.The
Western Wall, the Jewish Quarter and the other Jewish holy sites in the
Jerusalem region will stay in the hands of Israel forever.&quot;

Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has refused to comment on the Ramon plan, though
commentators compare the situation to when Olmert himself introduced the
idea of unilaterally withdrawing from Gaza ahead of then-PM Ariel Sharon's
open adoption of the policy. Ramon is a close friend and political ally of
Olmert's.

On the eve of the Sukkot festival, just prior to his passing away, former
Chief Rabbi and Rosh Yeshiva of the Merkaz HaRav Kook religious-Zionist
center Rabbi Avraham Shapira signed a strongly-worded statement against the
plan. &quot;The Land of Israel belongs to the Nation of Israel and was granted to
us as an inheritance by the Creator of the world. Neither the Prime Minister
nor anybody else has the right to give away areas, or even a grain, of the
holy Land of Israel. The entire Land of Israel, according to the borders
outlined in the Torah - belonged in the past, and belong in the present and
future, only to the Nation of Israel, and it is forbidden by severe Torah
prohibition to give up any of the territory of our holy land.&quot;

The rabbi, who had issued a call prior to the Disengagement for soldiers and
police to disobey orders to take part in the expulsion, continued: &quot;Did we
not learn a lesson from the expulsion of our heroic brethren from Gush Katif
and northern Samaria who were uprooted from their homes? We call upon the
public to protest against these statements, for the Prime Minister to
repudiate them, and to show concern for the rights of the Nation of Israel
in its land.&quot;

2. Jewish Youths Rescued After Kidnapping by Arab Driver

by Ezra HaLevi

Three Jewish boys from Jerusalem were kidnapped by an Arab driver and
surrounded by a lynch-mob just before police rescued them Friday.

The three boys entered a car - a cab according to some accounts - at the
French Hill junction in northern Jerusalem and asked to be brought to the
town of Beit El, north of the capital.

The driver, an Israeli-Arab, drove into the Arab neighborhood of Shuafat
instead, home to a radical neighborhood considered a refugee camp for the
past 60 years. There, two other men joined him, demanding the youths' money
and cell phones.

The driver and his accomplices threw the boys out of the cab in the middle
of the camp, where an angry mob began surrounding them.

One of the boys managed to call 100, Israel's version of 911, before his
phone was taken away and Police arrived just as the mob was preparing to
attack the youths. A conflicting report had one of the boys climbing to a
rooftop and screaming for help, alerting the police. The crowd dispersed and
police announced that the incident was &quot;criminally motivated.&quot;

Some cab companies have faced legal action for hiring only Jewish drivers
and a large portion of Jerusalem's cab drivers are Arabs. Security experts
suggest reading the cabbie's ID plaque, posted between the front and back
doors, to determine the nationality of the driver by name. Others say the
only way to insure one is entering a safe cab is to use reliable companies
rather than flagging down passing taxis.

IDF soldiers are prohibited from hitchhiking after several incidents of
Arabs pretending to be Jews on their way to communities in Judea and
Samaria, in fact seeking to kidnap them.

IDF Raises Alert
The IDF has raised its alert for the four-day Muslim Eid el-Fitr holiday
ending the month of Ramadan. It also is making provisions to allow Arabs
from Judea and Samaria to visit families in other parts of Israel. Permits
will be granted to Muslim men over the age of 50, women over the age of 25
and minors under the age of 16.

The army also is allowing Arab traffic in the opposite direction. The heavy
traffic at checkpoints is expected to cause further slowdowns that have
caused long delays at checkpoints that only have one lane.

Gazan Terrorists Wounded in Tunnel Collapse
Several Arab residents of Gaza were wounded on Thursday afternoon when the
tunnel they were using collapsed. Doctors explained that the wounded had
suffered from a shortage of oxygen following the collapse.  The exact number
of wounded and their condition was not made public. Tunnels have been used
both for weapons transports along the Gaza-Egypt border as well as
cross-border terror attacks in Israel.

The collapse took place in the town of El-Bureij in central Gaza, where IDF
soldiers conducted an arrest campaign on Thursday.

The IDF concluded the operation later in the evening after confiscating
seven launchers for Kassam rockets, wounding four terrorists and arresting
40 wanted men.

In Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza, Golani brigade soldiers managed to capture
seven terrorists on Thursday as they attempted to launch rockets at Israeli
towns.

Bus Company Suing Bedouin Attackers
The Metropolin bus company has decided to press charges against two Bedouin
youths who attacked a bus with stones as it drove on a Negev road on
Wednesday night. The bus's windshield was shattered in the attack, and two
passengers were lightly wounded. The attackers were arrested.

Negev residents have complained that their vehicles are becoming a frequent
target for Bedouin stone-throwers, and say that roads are often blocked by
lines of stones as well-a trap which can damage cars or even cause them to
overturn.  Metropolin officials said they hoped the youths responsible for
Wednesday's attack would be forced to pay for damages to the bus in order to
deter other potential attackers.

3. PA Demands Kotel as Failed Taba Accords Revived

by Hana Levi Julian

Israel and the Palestinian Authority have agreed to take a second look at
the principles discussed during the January 2001 Taba Summit between
then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak and then-Palestinian Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat.

Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said this week that he has accepted the
principles reached during the negotiations but that had not been formalized
in a final document, as a basis for current negotiations, according to an
unnamed PA official quoted by the Maariv newspaper.

The source said that the PA has also agreed to the same principles as a
basis for talks but has not formulated that in a formal manner.

&quot;The problem is that Olmert has internal opposition from Barak,&quot; said the
source referring to the former PM who recently returned to politics and
became Defense Minister.

&quot;The gaps between Olmert and Abu Mazen are not large,&quot; he said. &quot;In
one-on-one talks with Abu Mazen, Olmert has already agreed to Taba but he
has not announced this formally.&quot; He predicted that an agreement of
principles would be reached by the time of the Mideast summit scheduled for
November 26 in Annapolis, Maryland.

PA &quot;Accepts&quot;, but Demands Jews Throw on 'Kotel'
PA negotiator Adnan Husseini, a senior advisor the PA Chairman Mahmoud
Abbas, said the PA now accepts the Taba agreement that Arafat turned down
six years ago, according to Voice of Israel government radio.

However, he rejected Israeli sovereignty over the Western Wall as well as
the Jerusalem neighborhoods of Givat Ze'ev and Ma'aleh Adumim.

Husseini said Thursday night that the Western Wall &quot;is part of Islamic
heritage that cannot be given up, and it must be under Muslim control.&quot; He
also insisted that the entire Old City belongs to the Muslims.

Abbas earlier had agreed that a land swap would allow Israel to retain
sovereignty over the Jewish Quarter and the Western Wall in the Old City.

Summary of Taba Accords
The concessions by Israel in Taba six years ago included:
. Jerusalem would be designated as an open city, with Israeli sovereignty
over the Western Wall and Jewish neighborhoods in Jerusalem and PA
sovereignty over Arab neighborhoods in the city. Each side would define
their part of Jerusalem as its capital. The issue of the Temple Mount had
not been resolved and the PA has now demanded the Western Wall as well.
. Israel agreed to withdrawal from Judea and Samaria over a 36-month period
and withdrawal from the Jordan Valley over an additional 36-month period, to
be replaced by an international force.  Arafat rejected these ideas.
. Israel proposed handing over blocs of land occupied by Arab residents, and
retaining so-called &quot;settlement blocs&quot; within Judea and Samaria.. Arafat
rejected this.
. Israel agreed to withdraw from 97 percent of its territory restored in the
1967 Six-Day War. Arafat rejected this too.
. Israel agreed to a limited so-called Right of Return, which would allow
some 5,000 foreign Arab descendants of those who fled the country during the
1948 War of Independence. Barak proposed that the Arabs be allowed to
immigrate (a) to Israel, (b) to Israeli swapped territory or (c) to the PA
state. A second proposal offered to Arafat included (a) rehabilitation and
relocation within the current Arab host country or (b) relocation to a third
country. Arafat rejected these proposals.
. Both sides agreed to phase out the UNRWA agency that administered
internationally-funded programs among the PA population, within five years.
. Both sides agreed the PA state would have sovereignty over its airspace.
. Both sides were willing to make a commitment to fight terror and cooperate
on security issues.
. Both sides agreed to abide by United Nations Security Council Resolution
242 and that the June 1967 lines would become the basis for permanent
borders between Israel and the new PA state.

4. Rivlin Calls on Shas: You Were Elected to Save Our Dream!

by Hillel Fendel

In a moving, emotional Knesset speech, Likud MK Ruby Rivlin said the Shas
and Yisrael Beiteinu MKs must act now to save Jerusalem - or else Israel's
national dreams might be lost.

Rivlin, a seventh-generation Jerusalemite and a strong opponent of the
Disengagement, appeared to be close to tears as he called upon his fellow
MKs - especially from those of the more nationalist-bent parties in the
government coalition, Shas and Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel Our Home) - to save
Jerusalem from being divided by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.  Olmert has
reportedly agreed to divide Jerusalem into Israeli and Palestinian entities,
with foreign control over the Temple Mount, in the upcoming Middle East
summit in the United States.

Speaking on Monday to introduce a no-confidence motion in the government,
Rivlin began:

&quot;These are difficult days for Israel. We are all but ignoring events that
are liable to influence our national history.  Moshe Rabbeinu, in the Song
of Haazinu [Deut. 32], which is a song of rebuke to the nation, told the
people that they were a 'perverse generation, children with no faith' -
people who may well not deserve a free state and must remain in exile,
Heaven forbid...&quot;

Rivlin said Prime Minister Olmert may, at best, be falling into the same
trap into which his predecessor Ariel Sharon fell:

&quot;I know that sometimes political leaders want to create processes that will
leave their imprint, even if they know that they don't want to actually push
those processes along before they are ripe. Sometimes they do these
processes with a wink.  I will tell you that Ariel Sharon summoned me to
explain why I need not get all upset about Israel's adoption of the Road
Map. He told me that we had to show the world that we were willing to make
peace, and that there were four conditions that had to be fulfilled for the
Road Map, and that they would never occur, so why should I worry?

&quot;So I said to him, 'That's exactly what I'm worried about, because even if
you have good intentions, you are leading us down a path of inevitable
destruction, because it will not be you, Arik Sharon, who will determine if
those conditions are fulfilled... but rather the Quartet, the Europeans, and
the United Nations... In addition, it might cause a clash of interests
between us and the Americans, in which the American president might
interpret the situation in accordance with the US interest.'  But he said,
'Do not worry and do not fear, it won't happen.' But then the Road Map fell
apart, so he decided, incredibly, that he would carry out a unilateral
withdrawal [from Gush Katif and northern Shomron] instead. I told him, 'With
all due respect, you may think the unilateral withdrawal is instead of the
Road Map - but the world will say it's just the first step of the Road
Map...'&quot;

Rivlin then called on Shas and Yisrael Beiteinu to save Israel from Olmert's
errors:

&quot;My friends and brothers, your election was for this moment; as Mordechai
said to Esther, don't assume [that you alone will be saved].  The Prime
Minister winks at you and says he is not referring to Jerusalem when he
speaks of our need to give up national dreams - even though he is already
not denying it.  Olmert is the man who [in the 1990's] came up with the
campaign that Peres was going to divide Jerusalem, and now he himself is
telling you that he's only talking about dividing Jerusalem but that he
really doesn't mean it?! The fact is that Condoleeza Rice is arriving here
next week and she is setting the terms of the upcoming summit.&quot;

MK Rivlin asked the Shas MKs to speak with their spiritual mentor, former
Chief Sephardic Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef:

&quot;Go tell our teacher and rabbi, who is not only a great Torah giant but also
a leader, and tell him [how catastrophic it will be] if the Temple Mount
does not remain under Israeli sovereignty.  For the Arabs say openly and
without hesitation - you can even ask my good friend MK Muhammed Barakeh -
that the Temple Mount is theirs and not ours, even though we know that we
have returned to our Land to 'sound a great shofar for our freedom.'  But
tell the honored rabbi and great leader [Rabbi Yosef] that if we give up
sovereignty, the Western Wall will become [destroyed and off-limits to Jews]
like Joseph's Tomb.&quot;

Rivlin said he knows there are many MKs who &quot;were essentially appointed and
not elected&quot; - a reference to Sharon's formation of the Kadima Party list
before he took ill - and that they fear that they will not be re-elected in
the event of new elections:

&quot;Therefore, we can't talk to them [about toppling the government]; we must
talk directly to the people... I turn not to the leader of Kadima, who once
had a portrait of [Land of Israel loyalist] Ze'ev Jabotinsky on his wall,
but to the MKs of Kadima, and I say: Refrain!  And the same to those of
Labor, who once said that Jerusalem would never be divided! ...  And I turn
to [Yisrael Beiteinu leader] Cabinet Minister Avigdor Lieberman, a good
friend, the former Director-General of the Likud, a resident of Nokdim in
Judea!  And I say to you, 'Don't you realize that the moment we retreat from
one of our fundamental beliefs and dreams, there will no longer be or remain
the Zionist entity that we so much wanted to see as the sprouting of our
Redemption?'&quot;

&quot;Yes, it's true, there is a dispute between two peoples in this land and in
this country, and will probably not be solved for a long time; I hope we
will find the solution.  But you, members of Shas and Yisrael Beiteinu,
please: You must realize that you were elected to protect this dream without
which we cannot exist - for it is not a dream; it has come true, and if it
again becomes a dream that we can just give up, Heaven forbid, then we will
get to the point where we will be told to give up all our dreams, and mainly
the dream of [this] beginning of the sprouting of our Redemption.&quot;

5. Arabs Who Killed Girl Planned Yom Kippur Murder

by Gil Ronen

The state prosecution has charged two Israeli-Arabs who ran down and killed
a nine year old girl on Yom Kippur with manslaughter. Asad Nasim Shibli (20)
and Muhammad Mamon Shibli (21), from the village of Arab a-Shibli, entered
neighboring Kfar Tavor as Yom Kippur began, driving an ATV (all-terrain
vehicle) at high speed. They drove through a crowd that had gathered outside
the synagogue and ran over  Tal Zino, a nine year old girl, killing her.

The charge sheet shows that the two planned their action in advance. In
early September, two or three weeks before Yom Kippur, the driver drove his
ATV wildly near the Kfar Tavor gas station. When a uniformed Border Police
volunteer castigated him for this, he answered: &quot;Wait and see what we'll do
to you on Yom Kippur.&quot; He then made a rude gesture at the volunteer and
drove off wildly.

The prosecution initially intended to charge the driver with murder but
leftist reactions led it to change the charges to manslaughter. Arabs and
news media said that charges of murder for a driving &quot;accident&quot; were
unprecedented and would never have been filed against Jews.

Kfar Tavor residents quoted in news reports after the incident accused the
driver of the ATV of killing Tal on purpose. Asad Shibli reportedly ignored
numerous requests to leave the area before killing the gi
When a Border Police volunteer castigated him for this, he answered: &quot;Wait
and see what we'll do to you on Yom Kippur.&quot;
rl, who had been riding her bicycle.

Eyewitnesses said that Shibli and his friend had been driving at
approximately 120 kph down a street full of children. Shibli and the other
youth on the ATV came up with various excuses for their murderous actions,
and claimed that they were not aware that Yom Kippur had begun.

One witness derided the police for refusing to define the incident as a
terrorist attack, saying that if a Jewish driver had done what Shibli did in
an Arab village, he would be charged with racially based murder.

6. Slain Minister Rehavam Ze'evi Remembered in Official Ceremony

by Nissan Ratzlav-Katz

A memorial ceremony marking six years since the assassination of former
Minister Rehavam Ze'evi was held Thursday afternoon at the Mt. Herzl
military cemetery in Jerusalem. In attendance, in addition to Ze'evi's
family and friends, were President Shimon Peres, Defense Minister Ehud
Barak, Public Security Minister Avi Dichter, Strategic Affairs Minister
Avigdor Lieberman, Speaker of the Knesset Dalia Itzik, Likud Chairman
Knesset Member Binyamin Netanyahu, and other MKs.
&quot;Rehavam Ze'evi was dear to the heart, and easy to like, even for his
opponents.&quot; -- President Shimon Peres

The ceremony included a memorial prayer chanted by an IDF cantor, a
wreath-laying by the President, and speeches by Ze'evi's wife Yael, his son
Palmach, and President Peres.

Ze'evi was murdered on October 17, 2001, or 30 Tishrei 5762 in the Jewish
calendar, which falls on Thursday night this year. Three terrorists from the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) shot the minister to
death inside a Jerusalem hotel, just outside his hotel room. He was killed
shortly after resigning from then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government,
but before the resignation went into effect. He was 75 years old at the time
of his death.

President Peres: He Was Not a Racist
In his speech in honor of the slain leader, who was also a general in the
IDF, President Peres said, &quot;Rehavam Ze'evi was dear to the heart, and easy
to like, even for his opponents.&quot;

The President said that those who have accused Ze'evi of racism are
mistaken. Ze'evi and the party he headed, Moledet, saw voluntary transfer of
the Arabs of Judea, Samaria and Gaza outside of Israel's borders as the only
solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict, but &quot;on the personal and human level,
he respected the Arabs of Israel and knew their culture, language and
lifestyle very well,&quot; Peres said.

&quot;On the national level, his claim that the entire Land of Israel is the
eternal inheritance of the people of Israel, and is indivisible, come what
may, did not enjoy widespread popularity,&quot; the President asserted. &quot;I myself
was, as is known, an opponent and rival of his; and more than once I was a
target of his linguistic arrows, which were rich, razor-sharp, and pleasant
to the ear even at their most extreme. I unequivocally disagreed with him,&quot;
Peres said, &quot;but I always held him in high esteem.&quot;

Peres summarized Zeevi's passion for his country lyrically: &quot;The story of
his love for the Land of Israel, both ancient and new, is written by a
loving master artist; a song of songs for Israel, his love.&quot;

Palmach Ze'evi: The Killers Picked the Wrong Tribe
In an address at his father's graveside Thursday, Palmach Ze'evi lamented an
apathy he discerns among the Israeli people and prayed for change. He also
used the occasion of the memorial to harshly criticize past and present
leaders of the State for continuing the policies against which his father
fought so bitterly.

&quot;Today,&quot; Ze'evi declared, &quot;an enemy far stronger [than the assassins] is
threatening to throw us out of our home. A far more fatal danger than the
bullets of the Arabs is the exhaustion that we, Jews, feel within ourselves.
Ever since I buried my father, Rehavam, I understand more and more the
greatness of the loss. ...We, the Israelis, are becoming apathetic and are
distancing ourselves from the state, and that is the beginning of the end. I
pray that we will return to that passionate love that my father had for the
land and for the Jews residing on it. We miss you so much, father.&quot;

Turning to Peres, Ze'evi said that while his father would likely have voted
for him for President - just as he did in a previous presidential campaign -
the Moledet founder would have immediately chastised Peres for saying that
it is not yet possible to judge the outcome of the Oslo Accords signed with
the PLO. &quot;He would have tried to demonstrate to you that the greatest fraud
in history is underway here,&quot; Palmach said.

&quot;Don't believe it, people of Israel, when they attempt to
&quot;The greatest fraud in history is underway here.&quot; - Palmach Ze'evi
anesthetize you with such weakness,&quot; Ze'evi continued. &quot;Instead of preparing
the people for a lengthy struggle, they are giving us snake oil. 'What has
changed?' [my father] would have asked. 'Have the Arabs changed? Has Islam
changed? Has the logic that two nations cannot share a single state
changed?' But we, who handed out weapons in the days of Rabin, which ended
up harming Jews, are doing the same thing again these very days. But the
government didn't stop to ask what has changed.&quot;

Addressing those who share his father's values, Ze'evi said, &quot;We must
compete for leadership and return this country to ourselves. Please, Lord,
return strength to my people.&quot;

&quot;Among the 120 Knesset Members, the killers chose father,&quot; Ze'evi noted.
&quot;They knew why they picked him, but they didn't know that they picked the
wrong tribe.&quot; The &quot;Ze'evi tribe,&quot; Palmach announced proudly, now has three
more officers in the IDF who will continue the tradition of love for the
Land of Israel that he himself was raised with.

Special Knesset Session
On Monday, October 15, there will be a special Knesset session in memory of
Minister Rehavam Ze'evi. The session will be held in the Knesset plenum in
the presence of President Peres. Addressing the session will be Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert, Knesset Speaker Itzik, the President of the Supreme
Court, and MK Netanyahu, as the official leader of the opposition.

7. Comptroller Steps in to Protect Whistle-Blower in Olmert Case

by Ezra HaLevi

The State Comptroller has stepped in to protect the job of
Accountant-General and Olmert corruption whistle-blower Dr. Yaron Zelicha.

State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss, in the authority granted his
position, issued a protection order preventing the removal of Zelicha from
his position. The Finance Ministry, headed by Olmert-confidante Roni Bar-On,
had claimed that the decision not to extend Zelicha's tenure did not
constitute firing him.  Bar-On says he will pursue the matter in the Supreme
Court.

Zelicha is a key witness in a corruption case against Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert.  Olmert was questioned Thursday under caution by police for the
second time this week about his role in intervening on behalf of wealthy
friends overseas during the privatization of Bank Leumi.

Finance Minister Bar-On had said he would submit his nomination of Zelicha's
replacement, Shuki Oren, to the Cabinet for approval Monday. Lindenstrauss's
order prevents that and demands more proof that Zelicha is not being fired
due to his blowing the whistle on Olmert's misdeeds.

The request that Lindenstrauss protect Zelicha came from an unlikely
partnership between MK Aryeh Eldad (National Union) and MK Shelly
Yechimovitch (Labor). Eldad told Army Radio that he did not believe the case
would go to the Supreme Court.

&quot;If Olmert or Bar-On wish to take another blow - then they'll go the Supreme
Court,&quot; said Eldad. &quot;Because it is hard for me to believe that the court
will want to get involved over a temporary order aimed at allowing more time
to examine the complaint. The criminal investigation against Olmert in the
Bank Leumi affair - which Zelicha exposed - is actually going on these very
days.&quot;

8. Anti-Jewish Attacks in US, Columnist Suggests Jews be Christians

by Hana Levi Julian

Anti-Semitic activity in the U.S. is on the rise, with two incidents
reported this week on the eastern seaboard as top political columnist
declares on national television that &quot;it would be better if we were all
Christian.&quot;

A rabbi suffered critical wounds after being severely beaten in the latest
of several anti-Semitic attacks that have hit the community of Lakewood, New
Jersey, home of the world-famous Lakewood Yeshiva.

Rabbi Mordechai Moskowitz, age 53, was beaten earlier this week as he was
walking to a synagogue. The attacker wielded an aluminum baseball bat and
inflicted critical wounds on his head and other parts of the body, but
Lakewood officials have not concluded the incidentwas anti-Semitic.

Several weeks ago, attackers pelted a group of orthodox Jewish youth with
eggs in a nearby community. Tension in the city has increased fears among
the Jewish community. One teenage boy reported that a woman asked him to
accompany her from a store to her car 100 feet away because she was afraid
she would be attacked.

Anti-Semites scrawled a Nazi swastika in a Columbia University bathroom, two
days after a noose was found on a black professor's door. University
president Lee Bollinger said the swastika has been removed.

The Nazi symbol was accompanied by a drawing on a bathroom door of a man

Commentator Says Perfected Jews Would be Christians

Controversial right-wing political commentator, columnist and best-selling
author Ann Coulter shocked a cable TV talk-show host by saying during an
appearance Monday that Jews need to be &quot;perfected&quot; by becoming Christians.

Coulter continued her anti-Semitic conversation with an invitation to Donny
Deutsch, the host of the CNBC show, &quot;The Big Idea,&quot; to &quot;come to church with
me.&quot;

Arutz-7's Yishai and Malka Fleisher discussed Coulter's anti-Semitic
evangelical views this week on their Israel National Radio tallk show

Deutsch, who is Jewish, clearly could not believe what he was hearing, and
reworded his question to the outspoken columnist: We should just throw
Judaism away and we should all be Christians?&quot;

Coulter's response: &quot;Yeah.&quot;

Deutsch attempted during the interview to pin down what appeared to be
Coulter's clearly anti-Semitic stance. She didn't budge. &quot;We just want Jews
to be perfected, as they say..

His response: &quot;Wow, you didn't really say that, did you?&quot;

Coulter's answer: &quot;Yes. That is what Christianity is. We believe in the Old
Testament, but ours is more like Federal Express. [While] You [Jews] have to
obey laws... &quot;

Deutsch told the audience leading up to the commercial break, &quot;If Ann
Coulter had any brains she would not say Jews need to be perfected. I'm
offended by that personally.&quot;

Following the commercial break, Deutsch gave Coulter a opportunity to
explain why she thinks the entire country - and by extension, the entire
world - should abandon any faith other than Christianity.

&quot;Don't you see how hateful, how anti-Semitic.... How do you not see? You're
an educated woman. How do you not see that?&quot; he pursued.

&quot;That isn't hateful at all,&quot; she responded. &quot;For me to say that for you to
become . a perfected Christian is not offensive at all.&quot;
