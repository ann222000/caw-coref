<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Further to the article below about Heinz/Libby, the smaller article
&gt; following sheds more light on the KOSHER NOSTRA EXTORTION TAX!!

&gt; The &quot;Kosher Nostra Scam&quot; on the American Consumer
&gt; by
&gt; Ernesto Cienfuegos
&gt; La Voz de Aztlan
&gt; Los Angeles, Alta California - 4/27/2002 - (ACN) La Voz de Aztlan
&gt; receives quite a few &quot;news tips&quot; per week from our many subscribers
&gt; and readers. Some we dismiss immediately but a very few catch our
&gt; attention.
&gt; Last week we received an e-mail asking us if we knew the significance
&gt; of the small encircled letter &quot;U&quot; or letter &quot;K&quot; that can be found
&gt; printed on many food cans, food packages and on other kitchen
&gt; products. The message gave us some clues and suggested that we
&gt; do some research into the subject. What we found
&gt; certainly was &quot;news&quot; to us and it both shocked and angered us.

&gt; On arriving at my residence, I immediately went to the pantry to
&gt; verify that what I had just learned was actually true. Sure enough,
&gt; most of the packaged and canned foods from major companies, like
&gt; Proctor &amp; Gamble and others, did have the (U), the (K) or other
&gt; similar markings. The Arrowhead water bottle, the instant Folgers
&gt; Coffee, the Kelloggs box, the Jiff Peanut Butter, the Pepper
&gt; container, the Trader Joe's tea box and even the Glads plastic
&gt; sandwich bags carton had the (U) or (K) mark on them.

&gt; We needed a little more verification so we called two major companies
&gt; to ask some questions. We chose Proctor &amp; Gamble that markets the
&gt; Folgers Coffee and the Clorox Company that manufactures the Glads
&gt; plastic zip lock sandwich bags. Each of the two companies, as well as
&gt; most others, have 1-800 telephone numbers printed on their packages
&gt; for consumers to call in case they have any questions about their
&gt; products. When we asked the Proctor &amp; Gamble representative what the
&gt; (U) meant on their Folgers Coffee container, she asked us to wait
&gt; until she consulted with her supervisor. She came back and informed us
&gt; that the mark meant that the coffee was &quot; certified kosher&quot;.

&gt; We than asked her how and who certified the coffee to be &quot;kosher&quot; and
&gt; whether it cost any money to do so. She refused to answer these and
&gt; other questions. She suggested that we write to their Corporate Public
&gt; Affairs Department. We than called the Clorox Corporation to ask what
&gt; the (U) meant on the package of their Glads plastic sandwich bags and
&gt; she also said that the (U) meant that the plastic bags were &quot;kosher&quot;
&gt; but refused to answer questions concerning payments the Clorox
&gt; Corporation has to make in order to be able to print the (U) on their
&gt; products.

&gt; What we learned next, pretty much floored me personally. I learned
&gt; that major food companies throughout America actually pay a Jewish Tax
&gt; amounting to hundreds of million of dollars per year in order to
&gt; receive protection.
&gt; This hidden tax gets passed, of course, to all non-Jewish consumers of
&gt; the products. The scam is to coerce the companies to pay up or suffer
&gt; the consequences of a Jewish boycott. Jewish consumers have learned
&gt; not to buy any kitchen product that does not have the (U) the (K) and
&gt; other similar markings.

&gt; Another shocker was learning who is actually behind these
&gt; sophisticated &quot;Kosher Nostra Scams.&quot; It turns out that the
&gt; perpetrators of these elaborate extortion schemes are actually
&gt; Rabbinical Councils that are set up, not just in the U.S. but in other
&gt; western countries as well. For example, the largest payola operation
&gt; in the U.S. is run by those who license the (U) symbol. The
&gt; (U) symbol provides protection for many products sold here in Aztlan
&gt; and in the United States. This symbol is managed by the The Union of
&gt; Orthodox Jewish Congregations with headquarters at 333 Seventh Avenue
&gt; in New York City.

&gt; The scam works like a well oiled machine and is now generating vast
&gt; amounts of funds, some of which are being utilized by the Union of
&gt; Orthodox Rabbis to support the Ariel Sharon Zionist government in
&gt; Israel. The website of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations is
&gt; full of pro-Israel and anti-Palestinian propaganda.

&gt; The &quot;Kosher Nostra&quot; protection racket starts when an Orthodox Rabbi
&gt; approaches a company to warn the owners that unless their product is
&gt; certified as kosher, or &quot;fit for a Jew to eat&quot;, they will face a
&gt; boycott by every Jew in America. Most, if not all of the food
&gt; companies, succumb to the blackmail because of fear of the Jewish
&gt; dominated media and a boycott that may eventually culminate in
&gt; bankruptcy. Also, the food companies know that the cost can be passed
&gt; on to the consumer anyway. The food companies have kept secret from
&gt; the general consumer the meaning of the (U) and the amount
&gt; of money they have to pay the Jewish Rabbis.

&gt; It is estimated that the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, which
&gt; manages the (U) symbol protection racket, controls about 85% of the
&gt;&quot;Kosher Nostra &quot; certification business. They now employ about 1200
&gt; Rabbi agents that are spread through out the U.S.

&gt; Food companies must first pay an exorbitant application fee and then a
&gt; large annual fee for the use of the (U) copyright symbol. Secondly,
&gt; the companies must pay separate fees each time a team of Rabbis shows
&gt; up to &quot;inspect&quot; the company's operations.
&gt; Certain food companies are required to hire Rabbis full time at very
&gt; lucrative salaries.

&gt; The amount of money that the non-Jewish consumer has paid the food
&gt; companies to make up for the hidden Jewish Tax is unknown, but it is
&gt; estimated to be in the billions since the scam first started. The
&gt; Orthodox Jewish Councils as well as the food companies keep the amount
&gt; of the fees very secret. The Jewish owned Wall Street Journal wrote
&gt; about the problem many years ago, but they have stopped writing about
&gt; it now.

&gt; Only public awareness concerning the &quot;Kosher Nostra Scam&quot; will
&gt; eventually help stop this swindle of the American consumer. Public
&gt; education of the scam may lead to an eventual non-Jewish boycott of
&gt; all products with the (U), (K) or other Jewish protection symbols. I
&gt; certainly do not need to pay extra for &quot;kosher water&quot;, &quot;kosher coffee&quot;
&gt; or &quot;kosher plastic sandwich bags&quot;.
&gt; In fact, I demand my money back for all I had to pay over the years
&gt; for the hidden and illegal Jewish Tax. Are there any bright attorneys
&gt; out there that could bring a class action suit against the Union of
&gt; Orthodox Jewish Congregations on behalf of the citizens of Aztlan and
&gt; other non-Jewish people?

&gt;&gt;like the so-called kosher food inspector in Calgary,
&gt;&gt;Toronto and wherever they hide under the rocks....
&gt;&gt;Now, these leeches will have to try and find some work to do,
&gt;&gt;such as janitorial, road sweeping or whatever they may be

&gt;&gt;Notice that parasite Ken McVay AGREES WITH THE TRUTH OF THE

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; veranda : the origins of Kosher are of very good value since
&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; teaches sanitary way of food storage , handling and preparation .
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those were valuable practices hundreds of years ago .
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The whole point is that Today it only duplicates the work of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Public Food Inspectors and therefore is an unjustified extra cost

&gt;&gt;&gt; news:9abc4e06.0304010305.50dc870e@posting.google.com ...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What duplication? It is a symbol on the container and the cost
&gt; would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not change in any way. This &quot;paranoia&quot; is silly.

&gt;&gt;&gt; veranda : what 'paranoia' ?? we are talking about saving money .
&gt;&gt;&gt; In order to have the Kosher mark on a product the manufacturer
&gt;&gt;&gt; must subscribe to the Rabbi inspections ( just like Public
&gt;&gt;&gt; Inspectors ) and the Rabbi are charging money for their services , you
&gt;&gt;&gt; knew that !
&gt;&gt;&gt; Kosher is Israel's food inspectors , dear , not in Canada though ,
&gt;&gt;&gt; we got our own ! :)

&gt;&gt;Well, to set the record straight. The Rabbinate counel that approves
&gt;&gt;something Kosher according to milk and meat products probably got a
&gt;&gt;flat fee and if the company continued to raise the prices that counsel
&gt;&gt;doesn't really care. It is not an item by item thing. With the
&gt;&gt;Kosher diet it matters what foods are eate together (and never mil and
&gt;&gt;meat) and one eats mostly milk meals, because the time period between
&gt;&gt;those types of meals is longer after meat (a much heavier meal in the
&gt;&gt;day.)

&gt;&gt;What would it save you--less than $10 a year.

&gt;&gt;All countries have their own Rabbinate Cousels, so don't think that it
&gt;&gt;is just Canada with their own. Maybe it is the Canadian Rabbis who
&gt;&gt;have demanded more money?

&gt;&gt;Or, perhaps Philip Wolf, the KOSHER FOOD INSPECTOR in Calgary wanted
&gt;&gt;more than the $35,000 a year he got for

"/> Tom,

If you wish to present your point in a more balanced light, it would
be best not to quote from the La Voz de Aztlan site. Any site that
superimposes a swastika on top of the Israeli flag could not be
considered unbiased. (Look down the left side of the site.) I'm not
sure why La Voz de Aztlan, The Voice of Alta California (California in
the U.S.), devotes much of it's site to anti-Israeli articles.

A major corporation having its product designated as kosher is the
same as a major corporation having its product designated as organic:
It's just a business decision. And that corporation is going to
charge you the maximum amount it can no matter what its expenses are.
So if that hamburger or can of peaches costs $1.00 with the kosher
label, it would be the same $1.00 without the label. Are the
corporations being ripped-off to have the ability to put a kosher
label on their product? I'd say yes. But it's not a tax, a tax is
imposed by the government. And if the corporation wishes to spend
their money in this fashion as basically advertising, it's theirs to
with as they see profitable. I don't see why it concerns you or La
Voz de Aztlan unless you are shareholders in the corporation.

Ken

What's fraudulent about it? It's voluntary. If this label means the price
of the product goes up, then surely there must be a competitor who is able
so sell a similar product unlabeled for a lower price.

And if you seriously object to your food being kosher, you're free to
boycott it if you like. I make a habit of boycotting a dozen companies
ranging from supermarket chains to oil companies for a variety of reasons,
but I don't go around posting drivel about it or demanding that everybody
follows my example. Especially not with the more ludicrous reasons.

&gt; Tom

"/> Tom,

At the risk of starting a flame war here (My gosh, I've already been
called a Weenie.) and continuing to respond to a troll, I'll respond
one final time.

If you go to the Snopes site you will see this issue explained nicely;
please do so. As many untruths are, this bit of fiction is based on
a bit of fact. Start with a fact so you sound credible, then go off
with the fiction and hope nobody notices.

Yes, some products do have a K or U to designate kosher. Is there a
charge for this service? Yes, but it's a voluntary cost. There is
the fact to give some credibility to the story, and now it's time to
deviate to fiction and inflammatory drivel. But is this a tax? Of
course not, a tax is imposed by the government. Is there a threat of a
complete Jewish boycott if the product is not labeled kosher? I've
never heard any evidence to support this. If you have some, please
provide it. Is this money siphoned off for some devious purpose?
Again, please provide evidence. And the kosher symbols are now a
&quot;point of irritation to some Jews.&quot; If this is true, please again
please provide the evidence for this claim. If you or the Jews who
are irritated by this don't wish to support it, simply write a letter
to the company and boycott the product. Case closed. But don't post
your anti-Semitic diatribe here and try to hide it as a frugal,
cost-cutting measure.

By the way, I believe you've been taken-in by somebody who knows that
what he's writing isn't all truth. If you speak Spanish, take a look
at the author's name. It translates to Ernesto One-Hundred-Fires. He
runs around starting all these fires, one hundred of them, and laughs
at the problems he has caused. He's laughing his head off at you
right now.

I may be wrong and you were not taken-in by this bit of fiction and
are instead a true believer in what you write. If this is the case,
then you are either a troll who writes very poorly or a neo-Nazi. (If
you are a neo-Nazi, it's simply a given that you will write poorly.)
If either is the case, please go crawl back under your rock or back to
your corner bar and leave this n.g. to the rest of us who can and do
think.

Ken

&gt; Tom

"/> While the Snopes article does a fairly good job of explaining things,
there are a few things it leaves out. First of all, nobody charges
anybody to use the letter K. If a company uses the letter K, the
company is saying that it certifies that the product is kosher. It
didn't hire anybody, but merely used kosher ingredients (according to
the laws of the bible) and kept its shop kosher in a like manner.

The other thing that was left out is that while there might be a
miniscule cost per unit produced for the certification (typically on
the order of 0 cents, rounded to the nearest significant digit, and
only when certified with an circled U) it's not fair to look at the
per unit cost when the number of units sold would be lower without it.

Orthodox Jews will consume only certified kosher products. If the
increased net profit made from producing additional units of the
product for this market segment is higher than the certification
costs, incremental cost per unit for the additional units, and related
incremental costs such as shipping, staffing, etc., then it's a sound
business decision because it's more profitable. In this case, it gets
certified. Otherwise it does not.

Looking at the cost per unit and the percentage of it that pays for
certification is not relevant. What is relevant is to compare what
the cost per unit would be for the hypothetical lower quantities of
non-certified product compared to the cost per unit of the actual
product. Since the latter is lower for the manufacturer, it's
actually theoretically cheaper for the consumer to get the kosher
product.

If you intentionally avoid kosher products as the authors of the scams
are saying, you ultimately pay more, not less. It's not a tax. It's a
rebate.

"/> Yes, there is a fraud. The &quot;kosher tax&quot; scam is a fraud because there
is no such thing. This a hoax. Check out
http://www.snopes.com/racial/business/kosher.htm  .

While studies have shown that the cost per item is perhaps a tenth of
a penny per item, this is misleading. Since the quantity of items
produced goes up, chances are that the per unit cost is actually lower
with kosher certification.

Any company will do an analysis to see if it's cost effective. It it's
not, they won't certify their products. Coca Cola, for instance, is
kosher for Passover in New York, but not kosher at all in other parts
of the country. They look at the market and decide if it will improve
their bottom line or not.

If the increased net profit is higher than the cost of certification,
then a company will do it because they make more money, and their
profit per unit is higher and they can in theory afford to charge
nominally less.

Furthermore, it does not cost them a penny to put a K on the box (with
or without a circle around it) if they want to certify on their own
that the product is kosher in a manner consistent with their
understanding of Jewish law.

The whole scam is one perpetuated by racists. Read the snopes article.

&gt; Tom,

&gt; If you wish to present your point in a more balanced light, it would
&gt; be best not to quote from the La Voz de Aztlan site. Any site that
&gt; superimposes a swastika on top of the Israeli flag could not be
&gt; considered unbiased.

"/> Never been to this site, but I'd say they're pretty much on the mark
with the swastika/Israeli connection. And there should be a picture
of Sharon in the dictionary next to the definition of &quot;terrorist.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (Look down the left side of the site.) I'm not
&gt; sure why La Voz de Aztlan, The Voice of Alta California (California in
&gt; the U.S.), devotes much of it's site to anti-Israeli articles.

"/> Maybe because Israel has caused the United States a lot of grief,
including being the major factor behind the 9-11 attacks. Last time
I checked, Alta, CA was part of the U.S.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A major corporation having its product designated as kosher is the

been prepared in accordance with their (the Jews') silly dietary rules.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's just a business decision. And that corporation is going to

The Kosher market is actually quite large and most aren't Jewish.
Muslims, lactose intolerant people plus vegetarians are the prime
market.

If it was just the Jews and only those who are observant, there
wouldn't be enough of a demand to keep the kosher designation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This hidden tax gets passed, of course, to all non-Jewish consumers
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the products. The scam is to coerce the companies to pay up or
&gt;&gt; suffer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the consequences of a Jewish boycott. Jewish consumers have learned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not to buy any kitchen product that does not have the (U) the (K)
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other similar markings.

&gt;&gt; Bull! Only &quot;religious&quot; Jews pay any attention to the U and K markings.
&gt;&gt; And I'm certain you will find that the majority of the Jews in the US
&gt;&gt; are NOT religious, or at least do not care if they eat ham, mix milk and
&gt;&gt; meat, or use non-kosher products.

&gt; The point is the &quot;kosher&quot; label does not come free. The consumer pays
&gt; for this fraud.
