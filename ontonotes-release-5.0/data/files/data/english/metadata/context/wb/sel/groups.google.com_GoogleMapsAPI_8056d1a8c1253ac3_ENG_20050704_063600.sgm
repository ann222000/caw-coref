I am trying to map news stories to the Google Map. My current, Swedish,
version of the attempt can be found here:
It maps Swedish online news stories to a number of Swedish cities. The
headline and a link to the news story are shown as a clickable marker
on the map. I use a (Swedish) news search engine to find the news
stories and identify the names of the cities from the news story text.
The news data are updated every two hours. Has anyone done something
similar for the US, or any other country?
cheers
