(Another gentleman who truly &quot;gets it&quot;. Â Except for the comment on the
&quot;eventual&quot; TV situation .... guess Mr. Brady's too erudite to have
heard of RFD-TV.)

Much like Beckett's tramps and their patient vigil for Godot, I've
been waiting for Imus. Or rather, for his return after seven months of
exile.

His sabbatical, as New York weekly the Observer politely puts it, ends
this coming Monday morning at dawn. Imus and his madcap troupe will be
back in morning drive time on Citadel Broadcasting's (nyse: CDL - news
- people ) flagship WABC in New York and a scattering of other
stations, the beginnings of what is expected to be a national
syndication and eventually, if not sooner, a TV spinoff.

I don't know if they measure such things, but I expect this one will
draw the biggest audience ever for an AM station show airing at 6 in
the morning.

Imus, as far as I'm concerned, is the single most intelligent,
sensitive and occasionally orneriest broadcaster there has ever been,
the opposite poles of his personality as disparate as his moods. He
said something both brutal and stupid last April, and there were some
who stood with him and others who didn't. I think most of us are happy
that his period in the wilderness is now coming to an end.

I am especially happy that Bernie McGuirk is back. He never had the
millions Imus had, and there were school bills to pay. I called ABC
the other day to ask if he was going to be on the air again or reduced
to producer/writer. I asked for the PR person. &quot;There isn't one.&quot; Then
give me the GM. &quot;Can I answer your question?&quot; the young woman said.
Sure. &quot;Well, it's the whole cast of the same characters.&quot;

Would McGuirk be on-air or producing only? She didn't know that. She
didn't sound like the kind of person who would lie to a reporter, so I
thanked her and concluded ABC has some damned nice people answering
phones over there.

Chuck McCord, well, he's back. I talked to him after the whole mess
began, when he kept his mouth shut and the others didn't. Now he and
Imus are back together again, and I'm glad of it. And not too happy
about the people who used to be on Imus in the Morning and then
recoiled. And now some of them say, &quot;Well, we'll be back.&quot;

Others are still waxing pious. Quoth the Raven, &quot;Nevermore.&quot; A few are
in proximate peril of rupturing themselves with their anguished
indecision. All I know is, I miss the guy and am grateful for his book
plugs.

Aw, to hell. Whom am I to lecture or preach? Some months ago, I wrote
that Imus would be back, somewhere, somehow, and now he is and let's
see what happens after this. The Observer story said James Carville
will be back. I know Kinky Friedman will be there. None of the
Newsweek people will. The magazine's ruling, not that of the
individual writers and editors.

Tim Russert told the Observer he'd changed his mind, that now he
believes in rehabilitation. Then again, he might have to check with
NBC. Equivocation? Or honest uncertainty? As to those like Carville
who don't shilly-shally, is this &quot;buddy-buddy bigotry,&quot; as the
Observer suggests, or old-fashioned loyalty?

Clarence Page is quoted as disagreeing with other black journalists
who want Imus banned. &quot;You make a martyr out of him. It's not worth
it. He's not worth it.&quot; Carville says, &quot;I defend the speaker. Not the
speech.&quot; And Friedman cracks, &quot;God created one perfect man. His name
was Al Sharpton.&quot;

What about Imus' favorite triumvirate at The New York Times--Mo Dowd,
Frank Rich, Tom Friedman? Will they return to the fold? Will the paper
rule on it? Will we hear Ken Auletta again on the Imus show? Back in
1998, Auletta profiled him for The New Yorker, opening with this
passage, &quot;The Don is not pleased when visitors blather. He holds
grudges, he is personally insulted when companies don't reward his
favorite charity, and if don't amuse him, you're whacked. Every
morning he is quick to let loose on &quot;wimps,&quot; &quot;jerks,&quot; &quot;weasels&quot; and
&quot;punks.&quot;

All this nine years ago was in very good humor on Auletta's part. But
now? That's part of the tension building as Dec. 3 nears. Who's with
the guy, who's against him? And who just doesn't give a damn?&quot;

Some love him, some don't, and then there's self-interest. Why
couldn't Imus have come back just one month earlier? When I needed
him. For years I've done a first interview with Imus on every new
publication date. This November he didn't have a show. I sent producer
McGuirk a copy of the new one with a wry note about this being just
for his own entertainment. Since he had no show to book, there was no
one out there for me to &quot;suck up&quot; to.

And now? He's back on the air. Hey, Imus, I've got another lousy book
to pitch.

Or as WABC's admirably bottom-line operations manager, Phil Boyce,
puts it, &quot;There's a lot of money to be made there. And we're in the
business of making money.&quot;

EXCELLENT, V!! Many thanks!! Yes, Brady does &quot;get it&quot; and he's a damn
fine gentleman to boot. I will buy his new &quot;lousy&quot; book as I have
bought his others.

The test of all these Imus supporters is whether
they say Imus said a stupid thing.

Most, like Brady, fall into that asshole camp.

Dick Cavett is the only one I know of that doesn't
say that, among the beautiful people set.

And Kinky, among the ugly people.
