'Al-Qaeda' is a Manufactured Intelligence Front
Kawther Salam

During the past weeks, two American hostages have been killed and
decapitated in Iraq and in Saudi Arabia. The media say that these
crimes were comitted by Islamic Terrorists.

I have never read any Islamic Rule in the Koran which allows the
decapitation of people whether they are Moslems, Christians or Jews,
for any reason whatsoever.

I have never read an Islamic Rule which states that the killing of
hostages is allowed. All what I remember that Islam has to say in this
matter is that somebody who kills a &quot;believer&quot; unlawfully is
sanctioned the same as if he had killed all the worlds nations. The
word &quot;believer&quot; means &quot;anyone who believes in God&quot; in this context,
not only Muslims.

The Koran states that the place where faith in God is held, and
equally where the faith in God is broken, is in the heart. The Koran
states that nobody can read what is in the hearts of others, or judge
them as a believers or disbelievers. Even if their hearts are cut
open, it is not possible to know if a person is a believer or not.
Knowledge in this matter belongs only to God himself. This should be
understood as meaning that Islam expressly forbids killing for
religious reasons.

The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) recommended good treatment for hostages
and prisoners during the past Islamic wars. He said: &quot;You should not
kill an old man, a child, or a woman. You should not cut a tree or
destroy a church...&quot;. Murdering and killing is outside of Islamic
morals and principles, which are inviolable.

Seen from a more secular standpoint, an Arabic proverb says &quot;Nobody
can cut the head of a person but his Creator&quot;. This means again that
nobody has the right to put an end to anothers life. While Islam
expressly forbids suicide, it is still more acceptable to put an end
to ones own life than to kill another person.

What does the word &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; mean ? In Arabic, &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; has a
different meanings, among them &quot;Base&quot;, &quot;Ground&quot;, &quot;Norm&quot;, &quot;Rule&quot;,
&quot;Fundament&quot;, &quot;Grammar&quot;. The exact meaning is dependent on the context
in which it is used. It depends on the word which follows &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot;
in the sentence. &quot;Qawa'ad Askaria&quot; is an Army Base, &quot;Qawa'ad Lugha&quot;
stands for Grammar Rules (the Bases of Grammar).

&quot;Qa'ada&quot; is the infinitive of the verb &quot;to sit&quot;. &quot;Ma-Qa'ad&quot; is a
chair. &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; is the base or fundament of something. &quot;Ana raicha
Al Qaeda&quot; is colloquial for &quot;I'm going to the toilet&quot;. A very common
and widespread use of the word &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; in different Arab countries
in the public language is for the toilet bowl. This name comes from
the Arabic verb &quot;Qa'ada&quot; which mean &quot;to sit&quot;, pertinently, on the
&quot;Toilet Bowl&quot;. In most Arabs homes there are two kinds of toilets: &quot;Al-
Qaeda&quot; also called the &quot;Hamam Franji&quot; or foreign toilet, and &quot;Hamam
Arabi&quot; or &quot;Arab toilet&quot; which is a hole in the ground. Lest we forget
it, the potty used by small children is called &quot;Ma Qa'adia&quot; or &quot;Little
Qaeda&quot;.

Those who founded the glorious &quot;International of Islamic Terror, Al-
Qaeda, probably knew too little about common use of Arabic language to
know that by using this name for their organization, they risked
becoming the laughing stock of everybody who speaks the Arabic
&quot;public&quot; language.

To kidnap, torture and execute people are terrorist actions which are
in no way related to God or to Islam, and these actions are not
rewarded by paradise as some ignorant Western media figures would like
to believe.

The terrorist event of New York 11 September 20001, and the terror
event of Madrid on 11 March 2004, and other terror events commonly
connected to Islam, are clearly not related to Islam if we consider
that the Al-Qaeda terror organization was established by the C.I.A in
the 1980s. Al-Qaeda is nothing but a conveniently &quot;Islamic&quot; front
which enables the C.I.A. to commit crimes in the name of Muslims. It
is well known that the Mujahadeen terrorists of Afghanistan were
organized, trained and funded by the C.I.A. using the Pakistani ISI as
a &quot;cut-out&quot; in order to lure the Soviet Army into Afghanistan at the
end of 1979. The Mujahedeen can be seen as C.I.A. terrorism with an
islamic name and &quot;islamic&quot; perpetrators. Afghanistan has, for all
purposes, been destroyed by these fanatics in furtherance of American
interests.

The Al-Qaeda terror organization has caused immense damage to Islam,
to Moslems worldwide and to the interests of the peoples of all Arab
and Muslim countries. The actions of Al-Qaeda have only served to
promote the interests of the U.S. and Israel, which are clearly
interested in &quot;reshaping&quot; the Middle East in such a way that they can
more easily rape and plunder the region at will.

In fact the C.I.A is using the terrorist actions of its proxy Al-Qaeda
in order to give the U.S. an excuse to extend their power into and
invade the Arab countries, first countries with rich plunder (Oil)
like Iraq, Iran, Saudia Arabia, and second any country which is a
&quot;threat&quot; to Israel, or more exactly which Israel dislikes for whatever
reason. The third objective for which the C.I.A. is using its proxy Al-
Qaeda is to engender fear and hate of Islam and Muslims worldwide.
This corresponds to an old and tried ploy of colonizers: to slander
and denigrate the target population so that it is acceptable and even
called for to commit genocide against them. The peoples of Ireland,
Africa and the Americas have all suffered this tragedy, and these
regions have been colonized. The next obvious victims are Arabs and
Muslims by extension because they live in geographic areas rich in oil
and other resources, and because Muslims as a collective are not white
enough to be respected as full humans by the criminals in London,
Washinton and Tel Aviv.

The immediate question is then: What purpose is the U.S pursuing in
Saudi Arabia with the decapitation of Paul Johnson ? Is this crime
related to their plans in the region in any way, or is it just one
more sideshow related to the upcoming elections in the U.S. designed
to distract the american public from some very embarassing information
leaks which could endanger the reelection of President Bush ? Will
there be a new decapitation every time something embarassing or
dangerous for the Bush administration leaks to the media, in the same
way as there was a very well timed suicide bomber in Israel every time
Sharon would have otherwise been forced to make peace with the
Palestinian side ? In a strange coincidence, the murder of Paul
Johnson was made public last Thursday or Friday.

The pictures of Johnson's decapitation were widely shown in the
mainstream media. At the same time, last Thursday, two American
officers testified before the Commission investigating the 911 crime
according to the article by Tom Fiocco linked above. This was
conveniently ignored by the mainstream media. If the 911 Commission
had chosen to ask these two officers hard questions related to the
weirdness of that day, they could probably have been found more than
just weirdness and chaos. A pertinent question would have been: could
&quot;Al-Qaeda&quot;, without the very opportune &quot;weirdness&quot; around the actions
of these two officers, been able to kidnap and fly four airplanes for
hours through the USA, to crash them into buildings in two separate
cities ? Whatever the answer to this question, the two officers named
in the linked article, Navy Captain Charles J. Leidig, Jr. and
Brigadier General Montague Winfield have since been promoted by
President Bush according to the article of Tom Fiocco.

A strange coincidence around the murder of Paul Johnson is that the
Saudi Police apparently cooperated with those who abducted him. Why
would a security service trained by American and British C.I.A. fronts
like the Vinnell Corporation, cooperate with &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot;, their
purported enemy ? This is the second time during the last weeks that
Saudi security forces have cooperated with &quot;Al-Qaeda. If this starts
happening regularly, it would suggest either a very grave instability
in the Kingdom or that the Saudi security forces are run in accordance
with American interests

And, why was the body of Paul Johnson, just like Nicholas Berg before
him, clothed in an orange Guantanamo-style overall ? Does &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot;
go shopping at Guantanamo Bay, or is there something else behind this
&quot;coincidence&quot; ?

During the second Palestinian Intifada, the Israeli intelligence tried
to create an &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; organization in the West Bank and and Gaza
using the American know-how and experience gained creating Al-Qaeda
and Mr. Osama bin Ladin. The Israeli Intelligence services were using
the damaged Palestinians economy to lure in unaware Palestinian
youths. They provided several Palestinians with machine guns and
thousands of dollars to kill Israelis under the name of Al-Qaeda. When
the game was discovered by the Palestinians intelligence, the Israelis
scurried away and stopped their disgusting &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; game with
Palestinians. Only last week the media carried news of an Israeli (not
Palestinian) arrested in the Phillipines for being a member of &quot;Al-
Qaeda&quot;

As an example of how different things can be when the USA wants, in
April, 1992, the airplane of President Arafat made a forced landing in
the desert during a trip between Lybia and Sudan. He was found almost
instantly by Israel and America, and brought to safety on the next
day. Why is the USA not able to find Osama bin Laden in the same way
with all the resources they have ?

On behalf of my people I would like to say that we deny that the
terror practices of Al-Qaeda represent Islam and Moslems in any way.
We are against the instrumentalization of Islam and all Moslems by the
C.I.A through their front organization Al-Qaeda. This disgusting
criminal gang has already caused too much death and suffering for
innocents of all creeds in many lands. We reject the Al-Qaeda
announcement to killing innocents people under the name of Islam for
revenge of the injustices comitted against Palestinians. We reject all

Well you don't have to be a Muslim to find a couple of suras, in the second
one apparently the fingertips need removing after the decapitation for some
macabre reason.

Sura 47 [Muhammad]:3 says &quot;When you encounter the unbelievers on the
battlefield, strike off their heads until you have crushed them completely;
then bind the [surviving] prisoners tightly.&quot;

Sura 8 [al-Anfal]:12 states &quot;I will cast dread into the hearts of the
unbelievers. Strike off their heads, then, and strike off all of their
fingertips.&quot;

As with Mohamed's wife being nine years old its not an easy thing to
whitewash over.

The thing is while, Muslims claim that the Koran is written so well, Mohamed
getting divine direction in its creation and it is kept in is pure and
original Arabic then how come so many Imams, Mullahs and other Islamic
leaders interpret it so differently?

If you are going to base your life around really old books like the bible
and Koran expect to take on some of the traits of primitive people I guess.

Actually large parts of Christian festivals are hi-jacked directly from
Pagan religions.  Christmas, (and the trees, plum pudding, decorations
etc etc ) Easter (including the hot cross buns, bunnys and eggs) ,
harvest festival and most of the origional saints days.

Also the Christian bible, Jewish Talmud and Islamic Koran overlap and
use the same source material for large parts of their books.

Yes but it still must put present day Islamic apologetics in a difficult
position as the Koran is supposed to be infallible.
Beheading usually with an axe or guilotine was still practiced in Europe
well into the 20th century, not many countries would consider doing that now
though let alone sawing a mans head off with a kitchen knife. Amputation of
body parts as a punishment disappeared into history hundreds ago, the only
mention at present times is in discussion of dealing with habitual child
molesters. Even if that was done it does it would very likely be with
consent and not functionally disable the perpertrator in day to day living.

Allowing that the Koran is indeed the infallible and perfect word of Allah
then some of the people interpreting it are certainly giving out conflicting
messages. The community leader in Bradford saying it is a religion of peace
while his counterpart in Iraq is making snuff movies to air on the Internet.

Yes an extreme example would be the voodoo religion with its mix of
Christianity intergrated with its African religious roots. Cristianity will
attempt to mould itself around any host religion.

Christanity, Judism and Islam are all Abrahamic religions and share common
themes that may be traced back through Ancient Eygyptian times, perhaps as
far as the Mesopotamian culture some 6000 years ago.

How these cultural ideals going back to neolithic times relate to 21st
century men and women is very debatable, and perhaps really not worth
killing, maiming and abusing fellow human beings over.

At the present times Christianity at least in the UK does not appear to be
wanting to overthrow democracy in host countries or apply an extreme shia
legal system to run in parelel and eventually replace the original one.

Fred Phelps fades into insignificance when compared with these tame muslims
(below) wanting to take people as war booty and screaming for blood, their
peers must be pretty scary in their native environment without the
constaints of a humanist legal system.
Notice how towards then end they are again asking for peoples heads, wtf?
and this is only over a few cartoons.

Crazy christian preacher Fred Phelps:

Some Muslims that don't like cartoons:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_kyNIevsIs&amp;mode;=related&amp;search;=

Channel fours 'Undercover mosque' documentary, published in six parts on
youtube also leaves an uneasy feeling unlike anything contempory Christians
appear to be able to do. A bit like a 21st century reincarnation of the
inquisition.

Yes but he does have God on His Side!

I took a look at his web site. I did not realise that he pickets all the
funerals of servicemen.

Now, I don't agree with the war. Also I think the US forces are an ill
disciplined rabble who shoot first and identify the target later.

But picketing a funeral is  completely out of order.  The family should
be able to bury their dead without this sort of interference.

I agree there is a problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As with Mohamed's wife being nine years old its not an easy thing to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;whitewash over.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At that time in history having a 9 year old bride was not that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uncommon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anywhere in the world. It was only we few years ago (about 200) in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; UK
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when the age of consent went up from 12....

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I understand that it was that still at 12 in more recent times in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; parts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the USA.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes but it still must put present day Islamic apologetics in a difficult
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;position as the Koran is supposed to be infallible.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No more so than the many versions of the bible.

&gt;&gt;Both books are full of errors, both claim to be the perfect word of God so
&gt;&gt;something is amiss either the God is a sloppy worker when handing down his
&gt;&gt;word or not really 'all knowing'.

&gt; This is incorrect!  OUR interpretation is The Word Of God. Everybody else
&gt; has got it wrong and is going to HELL!!!
&gt; :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Allowing that the Koran is indeed the infallible and perfect word of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Allah

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which it is just as the bible is and see how many variations on that are
&gt;&gt;&gt; preached by many....

&gt;&gt;&gt; see
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.godhatesfags.com

&gt;&gt;Pastor Fred Phelps and Company, an excellent example of religious
&gt;&gt;extremism
&gt;&gt;run amok.

&gt; Yes but he does have God on His Side!

&gt; I took a look at his web site. I did not realise that he pickets all the
&gt; funerals of servicemen.

&gt; Now, I don't agree with the war. Also I think the US forces are an ill
&gt; disciplined rabble who shoot first and identify the target later.

&gt; But picketing a funeral is  completely out of order.  The family should be
&gt; able to bury their dead without this sort of interference.
">

I find it difficult to understand why US forces behave like they are only
trained to have an ON /OFF switch in situtations involving civilians. In
this war the fact that much the Iraq army discarded their uniforms during
the first weeks of the war can't have helped much though. The Shock and Awe
tactic when first publicised on the news gave the impression that only
tactically significant buildings were being targeted then the pictures of
dead and injured civilians very often children started to appear, since then
the propaganda machine of both sides have pretty much clouded the issues.

I also agee that what Phelps does is wrong, his life is overflowing with
skeletons* sometimes I wonder if his motives are more financial than
spiritual as he seems to get a lot of publicity for his crazed antics.

At least their numbers have fallen since they peaked in the 1920's. Islam

Because they have the wrong attitude to start with followed by the wrong
training.

They are largely very young with absolutely no idea bout the world  or
the people they are going to. They are feed a lot of propaganda and
assume EVERYONE on the planet understands American and works the same
way they do

Their training is very Gung ho and does nothing to dispel this.  The
problem in Iraq is that they are now using a lot of National Guard.
Incdentaly the averag IO of the US forces is below the minimum for the
UK armed forces!

Why? Most dumped their uniforms and stopped fighting. They are not
fighting as civilians. The insurgents are comparatively small in number.

What went wrong was the US disband the Iraq military after they took
over..

Hardly. You can't do those sort of explosions in a city without killing
civilians.
