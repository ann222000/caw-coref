I'm outfitting my bike for some touring, and I'm looking into racks
for panniers.

My first question is; how do rear racks attach if your bike doesn't
have braze-ons on the seat stays for them? Is there some sort of
bracket, and where can they be found? Are they as strong?

Secondly, the ones I've seen in person and on ebay are ugly as sin,
and all look kind of alike to me. What's everyone's favorite brand,
and style, and what is important to know when shopping for them?

P-clips, also known as cable hangers, available in hardware stores in
various sizes. They might be available in some bike shops, too.

I'm happy with my Nitto chrome-moly steel rack for touring with
panniers. It's heavier than an aluminum rack, but stiffer (panniers
don't sway as much) and hopefully more durable. It also has a hole in
the back to mount a taillight, which I like.

If you're bike doesn't have braze-ons for a rack, it may also not have
long enough chainstays to permit carrying large panniers without your
heels hitting the panniers every time your pedals go around. Depending
on how much stuff you intend to carry, a large saddle bag (Carradice or
Rivendell Baggins) might be a better option than panniers.

Hardware stores.  It's called a P-clamp.  Get a pair coated in plastic
to protect your paint.

No, but strong enough.

Bruce Gordon's racks are the best.

Take a look at the racks offered by Old Man Mountain
(oldmanmountain.com).  They have several models that use a bracket
that attaches at the quick release.  I've got the Cold Springs rack -
quite strong.  I've never even thought about its looks.  When in use,
it's covered by the panniers.  When not in use, it ain't on the bike.

I got a standard rear rack with shelf that supports seat-tool bag and
side bags; and just
bought Delta mega low front rack for $32 + ship, not only to
distribute low side loads front to rear
better, but also had a stabilizer bar from left fork to right fork
thought was
systemic for handling purposes since I'm pretty big. Both racks are
very light weight and are not 'touring' class.

And although had seem Old Man Mountain racks before, never seen their
whole line on their site and
they look like a very good rack at a very good price. I was looking at
their front racks mainly.

Good post sio...

HD is slower than most so bear with them and search tool bags from the
home search bar or wander over. the bags are quality and inexpensive:
asians make the bags not HD employees

I'm a step ahead of ya data. I bought a couple of army surplus belt
packs the other day. They are green canvas, and I'm going to spray
them with scotch guard or maybe something fully waterproof. They are a
little smaller than standard panniers but they were cheap ($15) and
they'll look great. I just need to glue a piece of stiff plastic to
the inner inside and punch a couple holes for zip tying them to the
rack. Maybe I'll get Ozark to send me some Arkansas patches for
them :-)

SKU: 63210
Heavy Duty Military Duffel - 24 in. x 50 in.
$19.99

SKU: 63200
Heavy Duty Military Duffel - 24 in. x 42 in.
$14.99

I have two of the 42" but notice the 50" is square and mounts up next
to plywood sides bolted to the rack and top: supported by shock cords
Sitting one bag on a ply top, load and bag set upright back of the
saddle, a shock cord or two  are run around the bag , attached to the
saddle post. Shock cords are then run from the rear of the ply top,
holes drilled and cord hooks hooked. Cords are run from the sides
bottoms around the bag and looped around other cords-like loading up
your jackass  or mule. Internet examples are available or see thomas'
book of knots. Examples of wooden racks are available in tech archives
and on the net.
The loaded bag comes from walmort at 40-50 pounds, 75 is max. I ride
home carefully over the bridge and thru the woods from 6 to 14 miles.
Alternatives to the standards. See also Bruce Gordon cycles

scotch guard may stink and irritate lungs: dragging the bags into the
tent may be undesirable. publix here in fla has publix trash bags with
red top ties. the publix bags are reliable waterproofing if the water
has runoff routes. two holes on the side for the backpack day bag's
straps...

wheeled bags have potential but wheeled grocery carriers are salt
flats
