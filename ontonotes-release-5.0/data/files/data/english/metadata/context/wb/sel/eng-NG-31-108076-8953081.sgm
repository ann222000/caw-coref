'Swear Him In' Provokes Expulsion

By Ray McGovern  September 10, 2007

“Swear him in.” That’s all I said in the unusual silence this
afternoon as first aid was being administered to Gen. David Petraeus’s
microphone at the hearing before the House Armed Services and Foreign
Affairs

It had dawned on me that when House Armed Services Committee Chairman
Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, invited Gen. Petraeus to make
hispresentation,
Skelton forgot to ask him to take the customary oath to tell the
truth,  the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  I had no idea
that would be enough to get me thrown out of the hearing.

So I didn’t think twice about it. I really thought that Skelton
perhaps forgot, and that the 10-minute interlude of silence while they
fixed the microphone was a good chance to raise this seemingly
innocent question.

If Petraeus is so honest and full of integrity, what possible
objection could he have to being sworn in?

Anyone who does not say what you want to hear is lying. Don't forget your
tinfoil hat when you go outside. Oh and don't forget that Betray Us is a
Zionist too.

Yesterday, General David Petraeus misled the country.

He used faulty statistics and cherry-picked intelligence to argue that
American troops should stay in Iraq for the foreseeable future. The
general said we're making major progress1—and we have to stay the
course. Sadly, independent assessments show that things in Iraq have
gone from bad to worse (see below for more on how Petraeus stretched
the truth).

Some of you have emailed to say it reminds you of the day four and a
half years ago when President Bush sent General Colin Powell to the
U.N. to make a trumped-up case for war.

Powell's WMDs helped justify the invasion of Iraq, and Petraeus'
version of &quot;progress&quot;—if it goes unchallenged—will justify keeping
troops there for years. Can you take a few minutes to write a
letter-to-the editor reminding folks that the &quot;surge&quot; didn't work—and
that the responsible thing to do is bring our troops home?

http://pol.moveon.org/lte?campaign_id=84&amp;id;=11221-8047603-AsWh7K&amp;t;=2

Petraeus based much of his assessment on the claim that violence in
Iraq is dropping.2 That just isn't true:

* Petraeus is using &quot;funny math.&quot; According to the Washington
Post, Petraeus and the Pentagon are using a bizarre formula for
measuring violence in the country. For example, deaths by car bombs
don't count.3 And assassinations count only if you're shot in the back
of the head—not in the front.4
* Iraqis believe the surge has failed. According to a massive new
ABC/BBC poll, every single Iraqi polled in Baghdad, the primary target
of the &quot;surge,&quot; said it had made security worse. Iraqis themselves
overwhelmingly think the situation in Iraq is deteriorating, in terms
of security, political cooperation, the economy, and other measures.
Overall, 70% think the escalation worsened rather than improved
security conditions. 5
* The independent GAO report found that violence is up. A
comprehensive Government Accountability Office report ordered by
Congress found that &quot;average number of daily attacks against civilians
have remained unchanged from February to July 2007.&quot;6  In August,
things got worse, with civilian casualties rising according to the
Associated Press7 and the Los Angeles Times.8
* For our troops, it's the bloodiest summer yet. More U.S. troops
died every month this year compared to the same month last year.9

Petraeus claimed that he compiled his report without conferring with
the White House. But the Washington Post recently reported that
Petraeus or his staff joined daily conference calls with the White
House and former RNC chairman Ed Gillespie this summer to &quot;map out
ways of selling the surge.&quot; The Post reported that Gillespie's White
House political unit was &quot;hard-wired&quot; to Petraeus' military unit.10

We would all like to see life improving in Iraq. But it's not—it's
getting worse. And if US forces stay in Iraq both Americans and Iraqis
will pay a terrible price.

Today is the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in American
history. The wounds of 9/11 are still fresh for many of us. After
9/11, President Bush used fear, lies and trumped-up intelligence to
stampede us into Iraq. Now, America is bogged down in an unwinnable
civil war, and Al Qaeda has regained enough strength to once again
menace the United States.11

It would be a tragic irony if, six years later, the administration
used skewed intelligence to head off the growing momentum for an exit
strategy from Iraq.

Please write a letter reminding America and Congress not to fall, ever
again, for White House lies—we need a timeline to bring our troops
home.

P.S. Yesterday, MoveOn members sponsored an ad in the New York Times
debunking Petraeus' claims. Click here to see the ad—and the evidence
to back it up:
http://pol.moveon.org/petraeus.html?id=11221-8047603-AsWh7K&amp;t;=4

The ad stirred a controversy on Capitol Hill—it accuses Petraeus of
&quot;cooking the books.&quot; And it charges that Petraeus is betraying the
American peoples' trust by spinning the facts to support the White
House. Some Democrats were uncomfortable with such strong language,
and Republicans attacked MoveOn.

We're sure if we'd run an ad debunking Colin Powell's testimony in
2003, they would have done the same thing—but sometimes it's important
to set the facts straight.

Well sure...  how else could you possibly explain him saying something
that you don't want to hear?

It's funny - the liberals (speaking of the ones in Congress, not
fucktards like Hal) were behind Petraeus when he was given this
assignment.  Why?  Because they assumed that his report would be
negative.  They were practically celebrating that (in their minds)
Petraeus would come home and give a negative assessment of the
situation.

Now that he's come forward with a message that contradicts what they
were hoping to hear, they're all over him.  They're disrespecting a
man who's given his entire life to service of his country, all because
he's telling them something they don't want to hear.

So is Ray actually suggesting that the DEM'S had a stake in
deliberately not swearing in a man who they had (and have) every
intention of calling a liar?

By the way...  people who speak out of turn at these types of hearings
are almost always made to leave.  It has nothing to do with what he
said - it's that he said anything at all.  The fact that he's a known
kook probably didn't help.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Did Petraeus actually *object* to being sworn in at any time?  Did he
refuse to be sworn in?

Why yes Hal the Moveon.org ad ran prior to Petraeus even giving testimony.
Some indication of his lying the man had not even spoken yet. I have to
assume they were clairvoyant.
Like I said Hal every one lies who does not say what you want to hear.
