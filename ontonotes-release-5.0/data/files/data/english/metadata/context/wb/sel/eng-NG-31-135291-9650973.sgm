It seems there have been a lot of talk about the flicker problem but i
can find the solution in the various discussion for the life of me.

I am trying to make a div layer disappear with hide and do a slideDown
on the div layer i want in its place. it flickers on both ie7 and ff.

thanks

So, I have noticed if I put a padding bewteen the bottom of my div
layer that i am hiding ($(&quot;mydiv&quot;).hide()) and the div layer beneath
it (that is static and not changing) the flickering goes away. any
thoughts of getting around this?
