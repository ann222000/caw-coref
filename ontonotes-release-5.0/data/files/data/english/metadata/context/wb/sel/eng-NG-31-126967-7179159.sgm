From The LasVegas Sun:

TiVo Inc. and Comcast Corp. on Monday unveiled the long-awaited fruits of an
agreement to work together: A cable box that runs TiVo's digital-video-recorder
software.

The collaboration between the largest U.S. cable operator and TiVo was announced
to great fanfare in March 2005 and has been considered one of the most
significant deals for the DVR pioneer. TiVo has been facing tough competition
against a growing number of less expensive DVRs from cable and satellite TV
operators, including Comcast.

Soon, for an additional fee, Comcast subscribers will be able to add TiVo DVR
features to their existing set-top boxes without a visit from a technician,
Comcast said. The actual launch plans were unclear, but the companies said they
have been testing the service since late 2006.

The companies also did not disclose how much more the TiVo software will cost.
Comcast customers currently pay about $10 a month for a basic DVR service on top
of their regular TV service charge.

The two companies plan to demonstrate the new TiVo-based service at the
International Consumer Electronics Show this week.

Digital video recorders let TV watchers search for and easily record their
favorite shows onto a hard drive without the hassles of video tapes. It also
lets users pause live TV, do instant replays and zip past commercials.

TiVo's service is known for its slick, easy-to-use interface and advanced
features such as suggesting programs a user might enjoy, the ability to transfer
TiVo recordings for viewing on PCs and portable devices, and the ability to
schedule last-minute recordings via the Web.

It has been challenging for the company, however, to differentiate itself.

Shares of TiVo gained 20 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $5.65 in afternoon trading,
while Comcast's stock gained 19 cents to $42.74, both on the Nasdaq Stock
Market.

And its complete inability to correctly record the program that came on after
the ballgame ran overtime (the only thing it would be useful for :-).

All recorders,including Tivo, that record according to the guide data it
receives will do exactly that. If the program is hown from 6-7PM, that's
what it records by default. If the previous program delays broadcast by 30
min. then you will only get the first 30 minutes of that program unless
you are smart enught to realize that a sporting event is likely to run
over and compensate manually for it. On Sunday nights, when this is more
likely to happen, I just record the news on all the network channels so if
any of the stations overrun a sporting event, I don't miss the last half
of the last show on that channel. Easy to do if you've got enough tuners
in you box. Not being limited to 1 or 2 tuners like a Tivo, with 5 in
mine, it's not a problem. Tivo technology is so old it's pathetic compared
to what can be done these days. I could spend over $3k on HD Tivos and
still not come close to what I can do with the system I have now which
cost less than $500, with no monthly fees serving 3 TV locations.
