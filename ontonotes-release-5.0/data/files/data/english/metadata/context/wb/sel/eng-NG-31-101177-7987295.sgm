*********************** ARTICLE START ***********************
One of the biggest debates among new business owners, especially work at home professionals, or investors, is whether they should create a business plan. Those who do understand the need for a business plan usually make it long before they understand the dynamics of their business. This means the plan is virtually useless.

There are several reasons why people feel they do not need a business plan. The top two are based on ignorance. First, the business owner believes that a business plan is only necessary if the business needs to borrow a loan. Second, many work at home professionals, or investors, believe they are not running a real business.

The second group of business owners do not understand the secret to success. The only secret to success, no matter what type of business venture, or investment the business owner embarks on, is to make a plan.

Success is a habit. There are common traits shared by people who succeed. They make plans. They do not work by the clock. They do not procrastinate. They do not avoid the distasteful aspects of their job. They usually have a good attitude.

In the same theme, there are common traits shared by people who fail. These usually involve looking for an easy way to make money, trying to get rich quick, and thinking that a business can run itself.

The last belief is the most devastating. If people could buy into a plan which earns $1500 a day, why wouldn’t we all do it? Few business owners who buy into these programs think, ‘why have I never bought from a company like this.’ The truth is, these companies rarely succeed because ‘no one’ buys into their products.

A business plan will help people determine whether the program they are looking at is viable. Will it perform as expected? Are the promises realistic? Can the program perform under your personal limitations? What courses do you need to take to learn how to make the program work? How much time do you need to invest each week to reach your goals? Do you have that much time each week?

A business plan will answer all of these questions. Many successful business owners work through several business plans before they find the business venture that is custom made for their skills, abilities, and expectations.

Very few investors make a plan, and update it yearly, correcting mistakes, and updating it to fit the current markets.

The mindset of a successful business owner sees a business differently that most people would view it. They see a business, or even a passive stream of income, as a living entity. It needs to be fed, nurtured, and allowed to grow. It needs the right elements. Not sun, rain, nutrients, but markets, capital investment, advertising, and customer service.
A business plan makes it easy to nurture the business. It outlines the growth projections, and alerts the business owner to aspects of the business which are not growing properly.

The most important aspect of a business plan is found in its ability to help the business owner to pin point the best time to change directions, or abandon the project.

No business owner wants to plan for failure, but not planning for failure can result in wasted months, or years, before the decision to change direction is made. Or, without a business plan, the business owner may abandon their venture to early, losing money, and costing themselves months, or years, of hard work and effort.

When creating a business plan, do not think of it as an outline of the business. Instead, think of it as a plan of action and a blueprint of success.
