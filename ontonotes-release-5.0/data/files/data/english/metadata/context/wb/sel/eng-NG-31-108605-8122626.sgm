Rear-Admiral Eugene Fluckey

Telegraph 10/07/2007

Rear-Admiral Eugene Fluckey, who has died aged 93, was
one of the most highly decorated American submariners of the
Second World War.

On January 25 1945 Fluckey was commanding the
Gato-class submarine Barb when, in a feat of brilliant
deduction and bold tracking, he located a concentration of
more than 30 Japanese ships in the lower reaches of Nankuan
Chiang, 250 miles south of Shanghai. Ordering &quot;Battle
stations!&quot; he penetrated the heavy enemy screen and, riding
in only five fathoms of water, launched his forward
torpedoes at a range of 3,000 yards.

Quickly bringing his boat's stern tubes to bear, he
fired four more, which obtained eight hits on six of the
main targets, and blew up a large ammunition ship, causing
further damage to the enemy. Fluckey then cleared the area
by running at full speed through the uncharted, mined and
rock-obstructed waters to safety. Earlier in the same patrol
he had sunk a large enemy ammunition ship during a running
two-hour night battle and, as he withdrew to base on January
29, sank another large Japanese freighter.

Fluckey took command of Barb in April 1944, when on
five patrols his initiative and aggression cost the enemy
dear. On his first war patrol off northern Japan he sank
five ships by torpedo and, in a series of surface gun duels,
destroyed some 20 small vessels. During his next patrol,
between the Philippines and China, he sank three more
Japanese ships, including the 20,000-ton escort carrier Unyo
and an 11,000-ton Japanese tanker with the same salvo.

Between October 1944 and February 1945 Fluckey
operated in the East China Sea and in the summer Barb became
the first American submarine to be armed with rockets, which
were used to strike at a Japanese air station and several
factories.

On July 23 Fluckey raised his own commando of eight
volunteers, who paddled on to Sakhalin Island under cover of
night and planted explosive charges on railway lines 400
yards inland. Fluckey considered giving the crewmen a terse
Hollywood-style send-off, but all he could think of was:
&quot;Boys, if you get stuck, head for Siberia, 130 miles north.
Follow the mountain ranges. Good luck.&quot; As they paddled back
to Barb, the wreckage of a 16-car train flew 200ft into the
air.

Fluckey was known to flout the US Navy's prohibition
on alcohol by stashing cases of beer in the officers' shower
and whenever Barb sank a ship everyone on board celebrated
with a cold drink. His official score was 95,360 tons of
enemy shipping, though he reckoned this should have been
145,000 tons.

He was awarded the Medal of Honour, four Navy Crosses,
the Distinguished Service Medal and the Legion of Merit.
Barb received four Presidential unit citations and several
Navy unit commendations. But Fluckey often said that his
greatest achievement was that no one under his command ever
received another well-known medal: the Purple Heart for
being wounded in action. &quot;He was absolutely confident and
absolutely fearless, but fearless with good judgment,&quot; said
a contemporary. &quot;He brought his ship and his people home.&quot;

Eugene Bennett Fluckey was born in Washington, DC, on
October 5 1913 and graduated from the US Naval Academy at
Annapolis in 1935.

His first appointments were to the battleship Nevada
and the destroyer McCormick before he attended the submarine
school at Groton, Connecticut.

His first submarine was S-42, and in 1941-42 he served
in the 2,000-ton fleet submarine Bonita on patrols off
Panama.

In late 1945 Fluckey was summoned to Washington where
he worked briefly in the Office of the Navy Secretary, James
Forrestal, and in the War Plans Division before becoming
personal aide to the Chief of Naval Operations, Fleet
Admiral Chester Nimitz.

He commanded the modernised submarine Halfbeak before
joining the staff of the Commander, Submarine Force,
Atlantic Fleet, and then was US naval attach√© in Lisbon. A
series of prominent command and staff jobs eventually led
Fluckey to appointment as Commander Submarine Force,
Pacific, in 1964.

His last appointments were as Director of Naval
Intelligence, and chief of the Military Assistance Advisory
Group, Portugal. After retiring in 1972, Fluckey, with his
second wife, ran a Portugese orphanage for some years. He
also treated the ageing veterans of Barb to cruises in
Alaska and on the Mississippi river. His wartime memoir
Thunder Below! (1992) won the Samuel Eliot Morison prize for
naval history.

Eugene Fluckey died on June 28. His first wife
Marjorie, whom he married in 1937, predeceased him in 1979;
he is survived by his second wife Margaret, along with a
daughter of his first marriage.
