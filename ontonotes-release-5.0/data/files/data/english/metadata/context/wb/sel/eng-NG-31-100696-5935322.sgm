On the mend

When getting a broken appliance fixed is often more expensive than
replacing it, it's not surprising that repair is a dying art. Tim
Dowling tries to buck the trend by fixing things himself, and three
other Guardian writers try to find someone - anyone - to put their
gadgets together again

Monday January 15, 2007
The Guardian (UK)

The disposable culture started small. In 1892 William Painter, founder
of the Baltimore Bottle Seal Company, patented the crown cork, which
would soon become more widely known as the bottle cap. The bottles were
returned and refilled, but the bottle caps got thrown away. They only
worked once. Painter's chief salesman at the time was King Camp
Gillette, who went on to apply the principle to his own invention, the
disposable razor blade. Today almost everything has its disposable
version - cameras, nappies, barbecues - but the concept has been taken
a step further. Economic imperatives have made most of our consumer
durables effectively disposable. In short, they are often cheaper to
replace than they are to mend. This applies not just to radios and
toasters, but to fridges, televisions and dishwashers. We now live in a
disposable culture.

We no longer revel in it, however. We know we should be reducing the
amount of waste we produce, although for all our efforts to compost or
recycle, landfill continues to increase. It's hard to slip a CD player
into the bottom of the rubbish these days without feeling a pang of
conscience, especially if you suspect that all it needs is a bit of
mending. But who fixes that sort of thing any more? And how much would
they charge you?

As if we weren't throwing enough away already, modern life has given us
dozens of bewildering new appliances - set-top boxes, modem-routers -
whose very purpose is almost as mysterious as their workings. To the
untrained eye, they appear to be nothing more than plastic boxes that
get a bit hot when you plug them in. Every new gadget seems to come
with its own remote control or charging station, without which it is
inoperable, and which is destined to go missing. In some cases the
stuff is literally irreparable; either the spare parts are not supplied
or there is nothing to fix - the appliance itself is considered a
"complete replacement unit". What do you do, for example, with a broken
electric toothbrush? If you're like me, you go out and buy a new one,
and then another new one, and then another, until eventually you learn
that electric toothbrushes are a sort of con: you're lucky if the base
outlives two replacement heads.

With persistence, one may still find someone out there willing to make
the necessary repairs to your broken breadmaker, but even they will
feel obliged to inform you that, given the likely price of the service,
you'd probably be better off chucking out the old one and buying the
latest model. To insist that something be mended even though it will
end up costing more than a brand-new replacement is, to say the least,
eccentric.

Ironically, this dilemma occasionally opens up the hitherto unheard-of
possibility of fixing the damaged goods yourself. If something is next
to worthless anyway, why not take it apart and see if you can figure
out what's wrong? I have had particular luck (it ain't skill, trust me)
with crappy, plastic, battery-operated children's toys, where shoddy
manufacture is usually the cause of the fault and some strong glue,
tape or a touch of solder is usually all it takes to put it right.
Small children tend to be incredibly impressed by this sort of thing,
which is probably the only reason I bother. I wouldn't suggest you
attempt to repair your own microwave, although I managed it once,
spending several days painstakingly resculpting a broken plastic door
latch from a blob of epoxy resin. It was one of the most satisfying
experiences of my life - a difficult triumph to work into casual
conversation, perhaps, but I'm still trying.

While some repairs are certainly beyond the realms of the ordinary
consumer, many are incredibly simple, requiring the straightforward
replacement of a broken, lost or worn-out part. Finding willing
repairmen may be almost impossible, but tracking down spare parts has
never been easier; the internet is a treasure trove of dishwasher
wheels, microwave turntable motors and vacuum-cleaner drive belts. You
can now replace most lost chargers and remotes without leaving your
computer. There are hundreds of sites offering step-by-step diagnostics
and repair instructions. Remember: if you ruin it, you were only going
to chuck it out anyway.

John Harris, Hereford
The toaster
'I like repairing things," says the man behind the counter. "I like to
make things work. Simple as that. I've been the same since I was a
child."

It's Tuesday morning at Teleservice, a small business in Hereford run
by Peter Pritchard, 63. The window is full of such attractions as CB
radios (still big with farmers, apparently), torches, TV aerials and
hoover bags, but Pritchard's metier is betrayed by a collection of
drawers with labels such as "dishwasher wheels", "kettle-boiler
elements" and "Hotpoint/Creda control knobs". The Amazing Mr Pritchard
has been restoring appliances to health for close to 40 years.

I have arrived bearing a toaster - your bog-standard, two-slot,
removable-crumb-tray Russell Hobbs model, boasting 1,100 watts of
bread-heating power - which mysteriously stopped working last week. In
this area, Pritchard has form: though he thinks of himself as a TV
specialist, his initiation into the repair world came via this kind of
electric small fry. "In this trade, you started on toasters and irons,"
he says. "We used to fix everything."

But here comes the bad news: the toaster-repair business has long been
virtually non-existent. "It started to go about 20 years ago," he says.
"You couldn't get the spares, so people got in the habit of just
throwing them away. And look at kettles: people buy them for £6 from a
supermarket, but a replacement element will cost you £10. I won't be
here in two years' time, I don't think. Nobody will want anything
repaired. Even televisions are becoming throwaway now. People won't
spend the money: if I tell them it's £50 to fix it, they say, 'Oh, I
think I'll buy another one.'"

During his trade's glory years, broken TVs would come in at the rate of
five or six a day; now he sees to one or two a week. The modern
affordability of washing machines means that customers are reluctant to
splash out on repairs that cost anything over £40 or £50. They still
come in with toasters and kettles, but the repair maths puts them off.
There is one exception: Dualit toasters, which cost £100 and upwards.
Mr Pritchard stocks Dualit elements, and will happily work his magic
with them.

That said, he is up for today's challenge, with one possibly fatal
proviso. A spares website tells us that the only replacement component
available is the handle, and that's obviously not the source of the
problem. None the less, we take the toaster into his workshop - a
pokey, slightly Doctor Who-esque place, replete with what looks like an
oscilloscope - and begin a series of simple tests. An old-school
Avometer (it stands for amps, volts, ohms) instantly locates the
malfunction: one of the elements has broken, and the fact that all four
are wired in series means that both slots are therefore out. Nothing
can be done: for want of a simple criss-cross lattice of metal, our
poor, forlorn little appliance will have to be hurled into a skip.

For Pritchard, meanwhile, retirement beckons - though he is still "just
about" turning a profit. "The one thing that's kept me going is Dyson
vacuum cleaners," he says. "They've been a saviour to our trade,
because people will spend the money on getting those fixed."

Just for a moment, his face darkens. "But the latest model's very
reliable, which is a nuisance."

Mimi Spencer, Hove
The DVD player
My chunky Toshiba DVD player, bought in 2003, threw in the towel a few
weeks back. Needless to say, I didn't have extended warranty cover for
my dead appliance. But, still, I took it back to my local branch of
Currys to see what could be done. As I carried it in from the car,
nursing the plug, lead and remote control unit to my chest, I felt
oddly fond of it. We'd had good nights together, that DVD and I.

The Currys boy happened to be immensely tall, with large hands and eyes
like a switched-off telly.

"Would it be possible ... ?" I started.

"Can't fix it. Not worth it," he uttered, twiddling something
fascinating in his trouser pocket.

"But it's only three years old," I said, as if pleading for the life of
a sick puppy. "Surely there must be something ... "

"Customer services," he said, sending me off with a shove of his head.

Adrian at customer services was a bored man, but he did have a gadget
on his computer which allowed him to pull up my entire electronic
history with the company. The DVD player was uncovered and thus
unmendable and wholly uninteresting to Adrian. "It's not on the
screen," he sniffed. "There's nothing I can do."

"Have you tried a lens cleaner?" he inquired, rather benevolently, I
thought. Yes, I had tried a lens cleaner. "Well," he said, in a
conspiratorially low whisper, as if being overheard might be a sackable
offence, "you could try the, erm, shop on Sackville Road. Might do it.
Depends what's wrong with it. But" - his voice rose perceptibly -
"you'd be better off getting a new one. They cost less than 30 quid."

It was tempting. There was something provocative about the slimline DVD
players lined up like dancing girls on the shelf. One model cost just
£19.99, about the same price as a DVD of The Constant Gardener; this
seemed all wrong, like paying more for the coffee than the cup.

"Um, Adrian," I asked gingerly, "could you recycle it if I can't fix
it?" The answer was an inevitable no.

Robert Smith Video Repair Centre, dumped on the corner of a residential
street in Hove, is one of those places, like Mr Benn's shop, that might
not be there next time you look. Inside, the rectangular video
recorders and cuboid cathode-ray TVs are stacked in neat ranks, each
with a label indicating its medical history. "Dead," said some. Others
said, "Done." It was like a geriatric ward for entertainment systems,
but there was hope in this room. Here, tinkering with a screwdriver
clearly yielded results.

A man with a moustache emerged from a back room and accepted my DVD
player, bidding me to await his call with the prognosis. How much would
it cost? That would depend, he said, leaving the mystery hanging in the
mote-filled air. I left hoping for the best, willing that the fix would
cost less than £19.99.

Robert Smith called. The laser was faulty. He had rung a couple of
wholesalers, but they didn't have one in stock. "Lasers," admitted
Robert, "can be pretty expensive." How expensive exactly? More than
£19.99? My heart wanted him to say no, but my brain already knew the
DVD was a DNR. "Anything from £20 to £100," replied Robert, like a
surgeon breaking the news gently. "You may want to think about writing
it off," he continued, getting as close to holding my hand as you can
over the phone.

There was nothing for it. The old Toshiba is, alas, off to Guangdong,
to be strip-searched for a morsel of metal and dumped in a lake. The
slinky new silver DVD player sits under the TV and looks adorable, like
a kitten. It's working beautifully. I give it a week.

Patrick Barkham, London
The Vacuum
'The problem is ... " Styled like an oversized training shoe, my
stricken mauve vacuum cleaner squats on Alan Levine's worktop at the
back of his narrow shop. He's gunning the motor and checking for
suction. Finally, after two hours scouring the electrical shops of
north London, I've found someone who will diagnose my vacuum's malady.
" ... you've got a crap cleaner."

Just as some people tend to order the second cheapest bottle of wine on
the menu, I bought one up from the bargain vacuum at a different
electrical shop eight months ago. Since then, I've had two satisfactory
vacuuming sessions and a dozen scraping, sweating, heaving, tugging,
unblocking, scrubbing attempts to persuade this cleaner to remove the
most rudimentary crumbs from the carpet.

Apart from laziness, one reason for the decline of the repair society
in cities is the impossibility of popping the broken object in the car
boot and parking outside your friendly repair shop. In today's urban
landscape, traffic wardens roam in front of boarded-up electrical
retailers.

Vacuum in rucksack, I start my repair odyssey by staggering along to
the electrical shops of Finsbury Park. Despite being 10am, two are
closed; one with "closing down sale" stickers in the windows. Another
two that look promising only unblock and repair mobile phones.

A quick search on Yell.com reveals only eight businesses in the entire
London area that classify their trade as including "electrical
repairs". There are bound to be others, but they don't exactly tout for
business.

The first shop I call says it will only examine items it has sold; the
second no longer does repairs, but suggests I phone City Domestic on
Essex Road.

Levine answers. He asks me how much I paid for my vacuum (£50) and
warns me of the minimum repair charge (£20). It's obvious he thinks it
won't be worth my while - or his. He has repaired and sold appliances
in north London since 1965. Thirty years ago, 100% of his business was
repairs; today it is 10%. He and his six engineers would repair 20
vacuums a day; now his staff spend their days delivering new washing
machines.

"It is simply down to the price of goods coming in, the price the
public are demanding to pay. Here I have no sympathy for consumers.
Everyone is demanding cheap, cheap, cheap, and that's what they're
getting," he says.

White goods are "made down to a price". Cheaper is less reliable, less
likely to last as long, and less logical to repair. "You don't have to
pay a lot for a decent vacuum cleaner but people are falling into this
trap of £29.99 jobbies. You know that is never going to be worth
repairing and you're lucky if it lasts a year."

He gets a call from a regular customer. His fridge has broken. It will
cost £20 for a new thermostat and £50 for labour. "Bin it," suggests
Levine. He'll deliver a new one for £130.

"My life is spent saying, 'Forget it, forget it,'" he says. It takes
longer to repair something now: tracing and ordering spare parts is
trickier because "there are so many Mickey Mouse brands around". The
cheapest electronic goods cannot be repaired at all. More-over, no
young workers are learning how to fix things.

Levine would rather do repairs. It takes longer to deliver a new
washing machine than to repair an old one. He must match the prices -
and tiny margins - of the volume-selling big chains. In his repair
days, he would have £2,000 tied up in spare-part stock; now it's
£25,000 of Siemens, Bosch, Frigidaire and others stacked high in his
shop.

There is, he says, only one repair market left: Dyson vacuum cleaners.
"That's not to say his product is unreliable, but there's so much
market penetration and it's a premium product. People have paid a lot
of money for them, so they'll pay to repair them."

Levine fixes my vacuum in five minutes. He points out that the bag
("that is going back 40 years") needs a good scrape and the suction
reduces when the bag blocks the motor. Back home, the vacuum works. But
Levine is right. It's still rubbish.
