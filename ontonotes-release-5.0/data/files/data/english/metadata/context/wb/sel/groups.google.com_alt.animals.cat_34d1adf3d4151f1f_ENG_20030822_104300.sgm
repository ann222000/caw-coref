I have an old female cat that has gone through many owners so exact age is
not known. I'm beginning to understand why everyone gets rid of her. To
put it bluntly she is an idiot when it comes to using a litter box. She
never covers up her mess in the litter box, while my other cat will hide all
traces of evidence that she went to the bathroom. That is the minor
problem.

The BIG PROBLEM: She has no concept that she is supposed to hit the inside
of the box and go on the litter. On a freshly clean box I watched her hunch
her head down in the middle of the box, arc up her rear end and send the
urine right out onto the floor. This does not happen always but at least
every other day. I can't understand why my younger bigger cat is so clean
with the litter boxes and the old one is absolutely filthy. I have tried a
few types of litter and have three boxes for two cats. The cats seem to get
along with each other except for minor chases now and then. They do play
together at times and can sleep within a couple feet of each other. Could
this be a case of the old cat trying to claim ownership of the litter boxes?

Regardless of the problem I will be the last owner the old cat will have
because she is one of the sweetest, affectionate, people loving cats I have
ever known. But please, does anyone know how you teach a cat to HIT THE
BOX. Thank you for any help. Brian

It might we easier to teach the owner to use a HUGE box. That did the
trick with a cat of years gone by.

A good point but I forgot to mention the boxes are the extra huge sizes from
the pet store. Also the younger cat which is noticably bigger had no
problem even 6 months ago when I had smaller boxes. The younger cat sniffs
and targets precise locations in the litter and then delivers right on her
mark. The older cat acts like she has no clue. I think in the old cats
head she thinks that if 4 feet are touching litter it's ok to let it go.
She makes no effort to squat and hit the litter. Sitting and laying on her
stomach don't seem to bother her so I don't think she would experience any
pain by lowering her behind to hit the litter. I would love to get a litter
maid (or two) but she would probably short the thing out or get electrocuted
by peeing all over the sides of the unit. Oh, I also have the covered
litter boxes to minimize problem but often her butt points in the direction
of the entrance hole, and yes, sends her mess right out the door. Does
anyone else know if a cat can be taught to hit the litter? Thanks

There was a similar problem posted on here a few days ago. This person's cat did the same
thing...squatted and then peed over the sides of the box. Another poster came up with an
idea that I thought was brilliant.

THE IDEA:
Purchase a large, deep, tupperware type container that is long and narrow. Make certain
that it is too narrow for the cat to sit comfortably without turning the long way in the
box. Cut a hole in the long side for the cats to go through. Once inside the box, the cat
should naturally turn with her butt away from the entry hole to get comfortable,
therefore nothing comes flying out.

Places like WalMart have a tremendous
array of plastic &quot;storage&quot; containers.
You could get a much longer/wider one
to be used as a litter box. Or, you
could get one of the large type that
is also about 3 feet high, with a lid.
You could make an enclosed litter box
by cutting a door in one of those.
Then at least the cat would only have
the possibility of having an accident
out the &quot;door end&quot;. In the section where
they have adult diapers, you'll find
they sell them by packs of a dozen or so.
They fold out flat like a sheet and are
a good two feet by two feet square.
Set one by the door, one end of it
under the litter box to be held in place.
Then if she does &quot;miss&quot; you just pull
up the &quot;diaper&quot;, toss it away, and put
a new one down.

What about a litter box with a lid??? That 's what we have always had for
two cats and now just the one.
Keep it simple. We bought ours at a pet store, surely they are still around.
The lid detaches for easy cleaning.

Well yeah I am using litter boxes with lids as stated in previous posts.
But the rump likes to stick out and go out the opening on occasion.
