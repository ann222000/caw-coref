_____________________________________________________
Jonson called Gervase Markham 'a scoundrel' while
others have called Markham a 'bad poet.' The verdict
of history should be that Markham was a scoundrel
who wrote bad poetry. The verdict of history is j
ust the reverse.

As the shareholder of a boys' theatre company
Markham wrote lewd pedophilic plays, for some years
near-fatally feuded with Gervase Holland and otherwise
disrupted society, but in another persona, apparently,
Markham published engagingly empirical books on
practical husbandry, horse training, military exercises
and Bacon's favorite subject, beer-making.

Computers find Markham's books the closest match to
Shakespeare's style of any Elizabethan author including
Marlowe.

Markham wrote the following encomium or mock encomium
(which is neither engaging nor empirical) to the Veres.
I say 'mock encomium' because hyperbole and amplificatio
distinguishes the mock encomium from the encomium.

Markham's suggestion that the Vere line extends back
to the 'first hour of Caesar' is more hyperbolic than
anything in the Gratulationes Valdinenses, Harvey's mock
encomium to Oxford or in 'To the Memory of My Beloved,'
Jonson's mock encomium to the actor.

I wrote 'hyperbole and amplificatio' but Bullinger
shows 'hyperbole' subsumed under 'amlificatio.'

_DiscoVERiEs_ by Ben Jonson (1640)
De Shakespeare *NOSTRAT*

------------------------------------------------------------­--------------
&lt;&lt;Hee [Shakespeare] was (indeed) honest, and of an open, and­ free
nature had an excellent Phantsie ; brave notions, and gentle exp­ressions :
wherein hee FLOW'D with that facility, that sometime it was ­necessary
he should be stop'd : Sufflaminandus erat ; as Augustus said of­ Haterius.
His wit was in his owne power ; would the rule of it had bee­ne so too.
Many times he fell into those things [that] could not
escape laughter, as when he said in the person of CAESAR,
one speaking to him, &quot;CAESAR thou dost me WRong&quot;.

He replied,

&quot;CAESAR NEVER DID WRong,
but with just cause&quot;,&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;In the difference of wits, I have obs-ERV'D ; there are many notes:
And it is a little Maistry to know them : to discerne,

what EVERy nature, EVERy disposition WILL *BEARE:FOR*

before wee sow our land, we should plough it. There are no fewer
formes of minds, then of bodies amongst us. The variety is incredible;

and therefore wee must search. Some are fit to make Divines,
some Poets, some Lawyers, some Physicians ;
*some to be sent to the PLOUGH, and trades* . &gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------
VOMERE : PLOUGHSHARE (Italian, Latin)

PLOWSHARE, PLOUGHSHARE, n. The SHARE of a PLOW,

[O]f all, that insolent Greece, or haughtie Rome

Triumph, my Britaine, thou hast one to showe,
[T]o whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.

Art,

To establish a fact you have to have a witness. Anagrams and ciphers
have no witnesses. There are exceptions like Jonson's FBACON and
FBACONPOET and Pope's cipher in which the statue of Shakespeare points
to a FBACON or maybe its FRANCIS BACON. Pope raised the money and had
the loopy-looking thing installed--the Bard looks quite drunk--so we
can suspect that Pope put the cipher there. It's pretty obvious that
Pope knew. Of course the Westminster plaque was defaced by authorities
as soon as the Baconians found it.

Anagrams are not evidence because they're anonymous. The law and
science, that is proofs, rely on witnesses and expert witness.

Well, my dear Elizabeth; the &quot;facts&quot; are that Bacon &amp; Oxford

BOTH: 1) had a Boar Crest (or Bur-Badge),

2) had a law degree from Gray's Inn,

3) were writers of acknowledged intellectual genius,

4) were romantically involved with younger men
(some possibly still in their teens),

5) and, at least once, used the courts of law
in a very self serving &amp; dishonorable way.
--------------------------------------------------------
The Law &amp; Science would ask us to evaluate these
so called &quot;facts&quot; in some sort of fair &amp; unbiased fashion.

But you, Elizabeth, have never shown any inclination to do so.

You come to bury Oxford, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with de Vere (but not, of course, with Verulam).

Where do you find that, Art?

Bacon's genius was recognized in his childhood,
at Cambridge and at the Court of France but that
notice completely disappears for over three decades.
Not a word about Bacon's genius but then he writes
the Advancement of Learning and there it is! Sort
as if Bacon had been concealing his genius, you
might say.

I'll have to see some evidence that Oxford was
a genius. I'll post Bacon's, you can post
Oxford's.

On your next point, I don't know that Bacon had
a relationship with a younger man in the sense
you suggest, but I'm certain that he didn't have
one with Southampton.

Strats don't understand the patron client relationship.
It was public relations, self-grandizement, self-
promotion on both sides. I've got an article
on the ironic and self-referencing rhetoric of the
Sonnets. The patron and client exploited each other and
all the protestations of love were conventions
not felt. It was just a Renaissance convention
that lasted about ten years and then it was gone.

As far as the 'you come to bury Oxford, not to
praise him,' is concerned, get a grip, Art.

Oxford, Bacon, Elizabeth, Burghley, Jonson, they're
all dust, if that.

They don't exist except as the prose descriptions
of historians and biographers.

It's just PRINT.

Stop being seduced by the text.

Cordially,

in Gratulationes Valdinenses, libri quatuor (1578):

&quot;English poetical measures have been sung thee long enough.
Let that Courtly Epistle - more polished even than the writings
of Castiglione himself - witness how greatly thou dost excel in letters.
I have seen many Latin verses of thine, yea, even more English verses
are extant; thou hast drunk deep draughts not only of the Muses
of France and Italy, but hast learned the manners of many men,
and the arts of foreign countries . . . . Thine eyes flash fire, thy
countenance shakes a spear . . .&quot;

John Soowthern, in Pandora (1584) wrote:

&quot;De Vere, that hath given him in part:
The love, the war, honour and art,
And with them an eternal fame.
Among our well-renowned men,
De Vere merits a silver pen
Eternally to write his honour.
A man so honoured as thee,
And both of the Muses and me.&quot;
------------------------------------------------
William Webbe, in A Discourse on English Poetry (1586) wrote:

&quot;I may not omit the deserved commendations
of many honourable and noble Lords and Gentlemen
in Her Majesty's Court, which, in the rare devices of poetry,
have been and yet are most skilful; among whom the right
honourable Earl of Oxford may challenge to himself
the title of most excellent among the rest.&quot;
------------------------------------------------
George Puttenham, in The Arte of English Poesie (1589) wrote:
&quot;And in Her Majesty's time that now are have sprung up another
crew of Courtly makers, Noblemen and Gentlemen of Her
Majesty's own servants, who have written excellently well
as it would appear if their doings could be found out and
made public with the rest, of which number is first the
noble gentleman Edward Earl of Oxford.&quot;

We can't be certain about anything for sure but
&quot;the facts&quot; as you define them are that Aubrey &amp; Bacon's

Just an interesting note, Elizabeth, from a website about Nabokov:

He also gave up writing in Russian and began composing fiction in English.
In his afterword to _Lolita_ he claimed: &quot;My private tragedy, which cannot,
and indeed should not, be anybody's concern, is that I had to abandon my

for a second-rate brand of English, devoid of any of those apparatuses--the

use to transcend the heritage in his own way.&quot;

Art,

Strats don't know much but at least a few have penetrated the rhetoric
of clients begging for patronage.

No dedication can be taken at face value. All dedications are crammed
with maximum dissembling.

Also, you'll notice that Golding, a Calvinist who didn't want to be
caught outright lying in case he was one of the 144,000.Elect who
would be elevated to Heaven and not be burned in etermal damnation,
only slants the facts:

&quot; . . . a desire your honour hath NATURALLY graffed in you to read,
peruse, and communicate with others as well the histories of ancient .
. .&quot;

Golding doesn't say that Oxford DID read, peruse and communicate,
Golding says what Harvey would say twenty years later, that Oxford
MEANT to write poetry, that he would get up in the morning INTENDING to
write a sonnet, but would start drinking and in the end assigned Harvey
to write the sonnet for Oxford's Mistress Anne. Probably Anne Cecil
since this was written ca 1580. (from Three Proper and Witty Familiar
Letters).

You're going to have to snap out of this and learn where the enemy is,
Art. You and Webb are under the spell of evil rhetoric. You've been

The maggoty-headed Aubrey was only repeating what he'd heard on the
gossip circuit post-Coke's burnt earth assault on Bacon. Lord
Chancellor Bacon woke up the morning that the indictment was delivered
to York House to discover that the street outside had been papered with
flyers accusing him of sodomy.

That, Art, is the date of the first charge against Bacon--the first
hint against Bacon--and since it coincides with the maniac Coke's
indictment of Bacon--to the day--we should be skeptical of it as fact.

As far as his mother is concerned, she said nothing about homsexuality,
in fact homosexuality wasn't even conceptualized until the mid- 18th
century in England. European culture, including classical culture, has
no concept of 'homosexuality' until modern times and the word itself
was coined by an American doctor after the turn of the 19th century.

All the Elizabethans knew were discrete (or indiscrete) 'acts' which
were committed by both heterosexual and what we would call homosexual
males.

Heterosexual aristocrats used page boys for sex. Marcus Aurellius
writes that his father, who was not 'gay,' was addicted to boys and had
promised to give them up. Later M. Aurellius writes that his father
caved into his addiction.

Greek and Roman heterosexual males could penetrate anything, anyone, in
any sense based strictly on class status. This is typical primate
mounting behavior that signals power relationships.

The only exception were wives of males in one's own or a higher class.
That got a death sentence.

When the English aristocracy started reading classical texts they begin
to copy Roman mores but I don't know that Bacon did this. Bacon was
not 'gay' until he developed enemies in the Puritan Parliament.

Lady Bacon's letter refers to the fact that Bacon took servants into
his bed. Her letter was a complaint of breach of class..

We know from the Proper and Witty Familiar Letters and other sources
that Elizabethan men went to bed together, even kissed each other on
the moutth but did not have sexual intercourse. Scholars say that
Harvey was in love with young 'Spenser' but 'Spenser' was not sexually
interested in Harvey (the real Spenser was not young). Men slept two to
a bed at the Inns of Court. Puritanism had not yet taken on sexual
purience as a doctrinal issue--the Puritans were then bawdy (some
Purtitan sects never adopted doctrines of sexual repression
but practiced 'lusty marriage').

Lady Anne Cooke did not have a sexual thought in her head. She did not
notice that her son Anthony, whom she clearly favored over her 'ward'
Bacon, was buggering other men, but she did write letters scolding
Bacon--perhaps she had the brothers confused--she died quite insane but
Bacon's historical enemies--who should know better--have used her
letters to indict him.

I'm willing to make a judgment on Bacon's gender preferences--I assumed
for some time that Bacon was gay--but I can't make that call when the
scholarship is so skewed. The Strats are calling their candidate 'a
homosexual' based entirely on ironic, over the top, Petrarchan rhetoric
reshaped to the uses of seeking patronage. There's nothing 'gay'
about the sonnets. Strats are the laziest won't look anything up but
willing to propagate disinformation sorry excuse for scholars I've ever
encountered.
When you take an interdisciplinary program you get a look into the
methodology of various disciplines and I have never seen anything as
unscholarly as Stratfordianism.

I don't consider any part of Oxfordianism to be scholarship.

I mean, Strats would rather make the burgher gay than look up a damned
fact. It's outrageous.

Jonson says that Bacon was badly hurt by women. Although Bacon was
not unhandsome, he was known to be a bastard, was destitute and
apparently lame. I read that Bacon couldn't dance because he had 'thin
legs' and, having read Sophocles, I thought lameness meant 'club feet'
before modern medicine but the Greeks also defined it as 'thin legs.'
Apollodorus uses 'thin legs' to describe the lameness of Hesphaistos
&lt;&gt;
the lame blacksmith of the gods.

Cordially,

Elizabeth

Something to do with the latin: FRACTUS:
----------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Mathematics Benoit Mandelbrot coined the word FRACTAL in 1975 from the
latin fractus which describes a broken stone-broken up and irregular.
Fractals are geometrical shapes that, contrary to those of Euclid, are not
regular at all. First, they are irregular all over. Secondly, they have the
same degree of irregularity on all scales. A fractal object looks the same
when examined from far away or nearby-it is self-similar.&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------
frango , fregi, fractum, 3, v. a.

I. to break, break in pieces, dash to pieces, shiver, break in two (cf.:
rumpo, diffringo).

II. Trop., to break down, subdue, weaken, diminish, violate; to soften,
move, touch:
----------------------------------------------------
fractus adj. with comp. [P. of frango] , interrupted, irregular: murmur,
Ta.--Fig., weakened, weak, feeble, faint:
----------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be subdivided
in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a smaller copy of the
whole. Fractals are generally self-similar (bits look like the whole) and
independent of scale (they look similar, no matter how close you zoom in).
Many mathematical structures are fractals; e.g. Sierpinski triangle, Koch
snowflake, Peano curve, Mandelbrot set and Lorenz attractor. Fractals also
describe many real-world objects that do not have simple geometric shapes,
such as clouds, mountains, turbulence, and coastlines. Benoit Mandelbrot,
the discoverer of the Mandelbrot set, coined the term &quot;fractal&quot; in 1975 from
the Latin fractus or &quot;to break&quot;. He defines a fractal as a set for which the
Hausdorff Besicovich dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension.
However, he is not satisfied with this definition as it excludes sets one
would consider fractals.&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------
Fractals and chaos in literature

Discuss the occurrence of fractals or chaos -- direct or as metaphor -- in
literature. Find your own sources, or consider Vladimir Nabokov's The Eye or
``Ultima Thule,'' Jorge Luis Borges' ``The Garden of Forking Paths,'' Gloria
Naylor's Mama Day, Flan O'Brien's The Third Policeman, Kate Wilhelm's Death
Qualified, John Updike's Roger's Version, or Michael Crichton's Jurassic
Park.
----------------------------------------------------
FRICK AND FRACK

[Q] From Kevin Mcgrath: &quot;Do you know where the phrase Frick and Frack
originated? I'm sure it wasn't because of the Back Street Boys.&quot;

[A] The phrase has become a fairly common one in North America for any two
people who are closely connected in some way. The Random House Historical
Dictionary of American Slang cites it as being Black English, but it
certainly has a wider circulation than that. For example, this appeared in
Newsday in September 1999: &quot;Msgr James Lisante is quite correct in referring
to Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton as 'Frick and Frack' on the
abortion issue&quot;. Or this one from the Toronto Star in June the same year:
&quot;He and Samaranch were like Frick and Frack&quot;. So it's reasonable enough that
Brian and Nick of the Back Street Boys should use the nicknames Frick and
Frack for each other.

The origin is ultimately in a famous partnership of Swiss comedy ice
skaters, Werner Groebli and Hans Mauch, whose stage names these were. They
came to public fame in the later years of a series of skating spectaculars
called Ice Follies, promoted by Eddie Shipstad and his brother Roy, which
began in 1936 and ran for almost 50 years. Their association lasted so long,
and they were at one time so well known, that their names have gone into the
language. Some care may be needed in using the phrase, as it is said also to
be a Black American English slang term for the testicles.

Italian servant of his named Auratio or HORATIO, who, they reported,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You won't be able to do that to me, Webb, because I know why Nabokov, a
&gt; native speaker of English,

"/>

You really relish parading your ignorance, don't you? Nabokov had
learned English as a boy from an English tutor, and he spoke a child's
English with the same ease as Russian (and he read English easily and
voraciously), but Nabokov himself identified Russian as his native
tongue. I refer you to Nabokov's 1962 BBC interview in Zermatt with
Peter Duval-Smith and Christopher Burstall, where Nabokov discusses his
painful switch from Russian to English:

&quot;Yes, that was a very difficult kind of switch. My private tragedy,
which cannot, indeed should not, be anybody's concern, is that I had
to abandon my natural language, my rich, infinitely rich and docile
Russian tongue, for a second-rate brand of English.&quot;

You can find the quotation in question on page 15 of the Vintage edition
of Nabokov's _Strong Opinions_; see if you can find someone willing to
read it you.

Second, I refer you to the Nabokov interview appearing in _The Paris
Review_ of October 1967. Herbert Gold asked Nabokov: &quot;Do you feel you
have any conspicuous or secret flaw as a writer?&quot; Nabokov replied:

&quot;The absence of a natural vocabulary. An odd thing to confess, but
true. Of the two instruments in my possession, one -- my native
tongue

[Note that Nabokov identifies Russian as his native tongue.]

-- I can no longer use, and this not only because of a lack of a
Russian audience, but also because the excitement of verbal
adventure in the Russian medium has faded away gradually after I
turned to English in 1940. My English, this second instrument I
have always had, is however a stiffish, artificial thing, which
may be all right for describing a sunset or an insect, but which
cannot conceal poverty of syntax and paucity of domestic diction
when I need the shortest road between warehouse and shop. [...]&quot;

Then there is Nabokov's 1943 poem originally entitled &quot;On Disovering a
Butterfly&quot;:

&quot;I found it in a legendary land
all rocks and lavender and tufted grass
where it was settled on some sodden sand
hard by the torrent of a mountain pass.

The features it combines mark it as new
to science: shape and shade -- the special tinge
akin to moonlight, tempering its blue,
the dingy underside, the checquered fringe.

My needles have teased out its sculptured sex;
corroded tissues could no longer hide
that priceless mote now dimpling the convex
and limpid teardrop on a lighted side.

Smoothly a screw is turned; out of the mist
two ambered hooks symmetrically slope,
or scales like battledores of amethyst
cross the charmed circle of a microscope.

I found it and I named it, being versed
in taxonomic Latin; thus became
godfather to an insect and its first
describer -- and I want no other fame.

Wide open its pin (though fast asleep),
and safe from creeping relatives and rust,
in the secluded stronghold where we keep
type specimens it will transcend its dust.

Dark pictures, thrones, the stones that pilgrims kiss,
poems that take a thousand years to die
but ape the immortality of this
red label on a little butterfly.&quot;

It is a lovely poem -- but in the typed fair copy that Nabokov submitted
to _The New Yorker_, the ninth line originally read:

&quot;My needles have teased out its sculptured sex&quot;.

Nabokov used the word &quot;horny&quot; in describing the male butterfly's
genitalia, an important identifying characteristic when dealing with
species that superficially look virtually identical, but he was unaware
of the word's common English sense. When Nabokov's editors at _The New
Yorker_ explained to him why the phrase was inadmissible, Nabokov
thanked them for

&quot;...saving that line from an ignorance-is-bliss disaster. And that
nightmare pun....This has somewhat subdued me -- I was getting rather
pleased with my English.&quot;

I marvel that you seem hell-bent upon displaying your ignorance -- but
if I had spent years cultivating apparently complete ignorance in
virtually every subject, perhaps I would flaunt it too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ridiculed people like you.

"/>

No, Nabokov ridiculed people like you, most memorably in _Pale Fire_,
with its delusional pseudo-scholar Charles Kinbote, who never checks
primary sources, does not know the material on which he comments, and
farcically misinterprets a reflective, personal poem by John Shade
(about (among other things) Shade's young daughter's suicide) as an epic
about the escape and exile of the King of Zembla, whom Kinbote believes
himself to be. He also parodies anti-Stratfordian nutcases in a chapter
of _Bend Sinister_, but his Charles Kinbote is so like you that the
resemblance is positively uncanny.

That's right. The shock of seeing his name slandered

I don't know. I'm writing about Francis Bacon who
couldn't dance because he had 'thin legs.'

Aubrey is definitely wrong here:

He had a uterine brother,

Anthony Bacon was technically his foster brother.
Nicholas Bacon acknowledged Anthony in his will. On the
other hand, it's hard to say how many bastards the Queen
dropped on her ladies in waiting. Lady Bacon was terribly
fond of Anthony but not as fond of Bacon.

&quot;Anthony Bacon, who was a very great states-man, and much
beyond his brother Francis for the Politiques,&quot;

Aubrey is alone in that opinion.

&quot; a lame man&quot;

Now I'm wonder if that attribution to Anthony Bacon
came from Maggoty Brain.

&quot;he was a Pensioner to, and lived with the Earle of Essex.&quot;

More accurately Anthony got patronage from Essex
and was his de facto secretary of state in the
rather treasonous shadow government Essex was running.
Bacon backed away (at great financial cost to himself)
when he saw what Essex was doing. I don't know who
saved Anthony from the gallows. It was probably Bacon
who asked for his life. Maybe Burghley or both.

Re: Nabokov, I didn't mean that Nabokov was
literally a native speaker of English but in
a sense he was. Nabokov, as I wrote to Webb,
was influenced by a phase of British empiricism
in Russia. Satire is an empirical genre so
Nabokov was a Baconian in that sense but there
is also a refence in his poem 'Shekspir' to
Brantome, the diarist of Valois. The alleged
affair between Valois and Bacon was a staple
of Baconianism about the time that Nabokov
wrote the poem.

In English we would coin on an a stem from Icelandic, /vont~/, wont~, to

He wende welle the gode man
Were hys fadur that hym wan.

Stems of wan~ and won~ combine with other words to express English speech,
sometimes also combining with Latin forms, 'un-wonted' eg, but which is a
bastard form.

It is a significant difference in English than American expression for the
latter to prefer Latinizms :)

This is of no particular import [there's a pun] except when discussing roots
of English language, as might have been coined and expressed by, for

So your new candidate for the &quot;true author&quot; is....

Phillis Wheatley? Aphra Behn? (Her claim is marginal, but at least one
prologue refers to her as an &quot;American&quot;.) Penn Leary has already set
forth his theory that the plays of Shakespeare were actually written by
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Perhaps, in light of this remarkable new

I think I should prefer William Dunlap, myself.

The solemn hour, &quot;when night and morning meet,&quot;
Mysterious time, to superstition dear,
And superstition's guides, now passes by;
Deathlike in solitude. The sentinels,
In drowsy tones, from post to post, send on
The signal of the passing hour. &quot;All’s well,&quot;
Sounds through the camp. Alas! all is not well;
Else, why stand I, a man, the friend of man,
At midnight's depth, deck'd in this murderous guise,
The habiliment of death, the badge of dire,
Necessitous coercion. 'Tis not well.
--In vain the enlighten'd friends of suffering man
Point out, of war, the folly, guilt, and madness.
Still, age succeeds to age, and war to war;
And man, the murderer, marshals out his hosts
In all the gaiety of festive pomp,
To spread around him death and desolation.

--------------
Just an interesting note, Elizabeth, from a website about Nabokov:

He also gave up writing in Russian and began composing fiction in
English. In his afterword to _Lolita_ he claimed: &quot;My private tragedy,
which cannot, and indeed should not, be anybody's concern, is that I had
to abandon my natural idiom, my untrammeled, rich, and infinitely docile
Russian tongue for a second-rate brand of English, devoid of any of
those apparatuses--the baffling mirror, the black velvet backdrop, the
implied associations and traditions which the native illusionist,
frac-tails flying, can magically use to transcend the heritage in his
own way.&quot;

Lovely quote, don't you think? Although I'm not entirely sure what
&quot;frac-tails&quot; are.

Lynne
--------------

Is Elizabeth confusing the excerpt from Nabokov's prose quoted by Lynne
with a poem? Or did Elizabeth merely halucinate the presence of a poem
in Lynne's post?

Or, perhaps Elizabeth is confusing Lynne's post with mine: both of us
quoted Nabokov's reflection upon the pain occasioned by abandoning his
native Russian, but my post also quoted a poem by Nabokov on discovering
a new species of butterfly. Is Elizabeth confusing the two of us?
(Mind you, I have no objection to being confused with Lynne, but Lynne
might feel differently about the matter.) And if so, is Elizabeth
actually under the impression that Nabokov's poem was written by Lynne?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Re: Nabokov, I didn't mean that Nabokov was

&gt; a sense he was.

"/>

Only in the sense that he spoke the tongue as a small child with his
tutor, that he studied in England as a young man, and that he began
writing in English around age 40. That's not what most people mean by
being a native speaker of a tongue, but we have seen that whatever
tongue Elizabeth grapples with writing in differs from English in many
respects.

No, the Roman god of the underworld was Dis (also called Pluto). His

Huh? Where did you get this? One of his forges was reputed to be
beneath Mt. Etna, but that's about it. In fact, according to many
accounts, when Hephaestus was cast down from Olympus, he was injured,
but was rescued near Lemnos by the Nereids Thetis and Eurynome, who hid
him from his mother Hera in their submarine grotto. There Hephaestus
first began his work as skilled artisan, fashioning jewelry from coral
reefs.

Hephaestus was hardly a heroic figure; indeed, in most mythological
accounts, he is if anything a comic figure. According to Hesiod, Hera
gave birth to him by parthogenesis, in a fit of pique at her husband,
Zeus, who had given birth to Athena without her involvement. Hephaestus
was cast out of Olympus by Hera, who was disillusioned by his deformity.
He was also famously cuckolded by his wife Aphrodite with Ares, the war
god. Indeed, Homer recounts the construction by Hephaestus of a
concealed net of chains in which Aphrodite and Ares were entrapped
during one of the former's acts of infidelity.

It is indeed a VERy fine, most amusing parody. But I would be
astonished if Elizabeth had read Tolkien -- or if she had, that she
could actually remember any of it well enough to recognize a parody
thereof (after all, she did not recognize Nabokov's burlesque of
anti-Stratfordians, nor does she recognize Peter Groves's irony).

In any case, your Tolkien/Gamgee parody, marvelous as it was, hardly
seems likely to elicit encomia like &quot;that poem you wrote was lighter
than air--it hardly seemed attached to the page&quot;:

Art not alone on his seat of stone,
Talking to George with a mighty groan;
For many a year he kept bringing him beer,
For chat was hard to come by.
Done by! Gum by!
In a cave in DC he dwelt alone,
And chat was hard to come by.

Up came Dave with his big boots on.
Said he to Art : 'Pray, what is yon?
For it looks like the spit o' my nuncle Will.
As should be a-lyin' in Westminster.
Binster! Spinster!
This many a year has Will been gone,
And I hoped he were lyin' in Westminster.'

'David,' said Art, 'this seat I stole.
To talk to George as I'm a troll.
Thy Will was dead as a lump o' lead,
Afore I found ole Oxford.
Toxford! Skotsford!
Just spare a thought for this poor old troll,
For he knows right well it's Oxford.'

Said Dave: 'I don't see why the likes o' thee
Without axin' leave should go makin' free
With the authorship; it's a heavy trip;
Don't speak your rubbish no more!
Row more! Trow more!
Though dead Will be, the bard is he;
Don't speak your rubbish no more!'

'For a couple o' pins,' says Art, and grins,
'I'll finish thy Will, and gnaw his shins.
A dead poet treat will go down sweet!
I'll try my teeth on thee now.
Hee now! See now!
I'm tired o' gnawing old Will's skin;
I've a mind to dine on thee now.'

But just as he thought his tale was bought,
He found his hands had hold of naught.
Before he could mind, Dave slipped behind
And threw him a puzzle to larn him.
Warn him! Darn him!
A cipher so neat would have him beat,
Would be the way to larn him.

But harder than stone is the forehead dome
Of Neufer who sits with George all alone.
As well set your brain to a Latin root,
For the mind of an Art don't feel it.
Peel it! Heal it!
Old Art laughed, when he heard Dave moan,
Cos he knew Dave's brain could feel it.

Dave is game, since home he came,
Though his writing a rhyme is lasting lame;
But Art don't care, and he's still there,
With the canon stole back for its owner.
Doner! Honer! Cipher Boy is still the same,
But Shaksper is now a goner!

It's funny you should say that. Many, many years ago my husband and I wrote
a musical version of The Hobbit, but we included some poems From LOTR. It
was particularly easy for me to write a parody of &quot;Troll Sat Alone On His
Seat of Stone&quot; the other day because I could still hear my husband's
&quot;lighter than air&quot; tune to it in my mind.

Apparently I wrote my own lyrics to some tunes. When a school performed The
Hobbit recently I remarked to my husband that I really liked the words to
Golem's song. He said: &quot;You should. You wrote them.&quot; My memory is clearly
worse than Elizabeth's or anyone else's.

The Nabokov poem, by the way, is quite stunning.

L.

Well, for one, there's the Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo. I quote
from the Martin West translation in the Loeb Classical Library,
beginning just before line 310:

&quot;She, lady Hera, at once grew angry,
and spoke among the assembled immortals:

'Hear from me, all you gods and goddesses, how
Zeus the cloud-gatherer is taking steps to dishonour me,
without provocation. For he has made me his wife -- a dutiful
one -- and now he has given birth without me to steely-eyed
Athena, who stands out among all the blessed immortals,
while my son has turned out a weakling among the gods,
Hephaestus of the withered legs, whom I myself bore. I
picked him up and threw him in the broad sea, but Nereus'
daughter, Thetis silverfoot, took him in and looked after
him together with her sisters; I wish she had done the gods
some different service. You cunning wretch, what will you
devise next? How could you bring yourself to father
steely-eyed Athena on your own? Couldn't I have given
birth to her? She would still have been called your child
among the immortals who dwell in the broad heaven.&quot;

You can even find perhaps a less authoritative translation online, at
the Online Medieval and Classical Library at Berkeley,

&lt;&gt;:

&quot;Thereupon queenly Hera was
angry and spoke thus among the assembled gods:

(ll. 311-330) `Hear from me, all gods and goddesses, how cloud-
gathering Zeus begins to dishonour me wantonly, when he has made
me his true-hearted wife. See now, apart from me he has given
birth to bright-eyed Athena who is foremost among all the blessed
gods. But my son Hephaestus whom I bare was weakly among all the
blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me
in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he
fell in the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of
Nereus took and cared for him with her sisters: would that she
had done other service to the blessed gods! O wicked one and
crafty! What else will you now devise? How dared you by
yourself give birth to bright-eyed Athena? Would not I have
borne you a child -- I, who was at least called your wife among
the undying gods who hold wide heaven.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; who hid
&gt; him from his mother Hera in their submarine grotto.

&gt; Source?

"/>

Homer, _Iliad_, in the translation by Robert Fitzgerald, Book 18,
beginning just after line 390 (page 448):

&quot;Then she called to Hêphaistos:
'Come and see!
Thetis is here, in need of something from you!'

To this the Great Gamelegs replied:

'Ah, then we have a visitor I honor.
She was my savior, after the long fall
and fractures that I had to bear, when Mother,
bitch that she is, wanted to hide her cripple.
That would have been a dangerous time, had not
Thetis and Eur´ynomê taken me in --
Eur´ynomê, daughter of the tidal Ocean.
Nine years I stayed, and fashioned works of art,
brooches and spiral bracelets, necklaces,
in their smooth cave, round which the stream of Ocean
flows with a foaming roar: and no one else
knew of it, gods or mortals. Only Thetis
knew, and Eur´ynomê, the two who saved me.
Now she has come to us. Well, what I owe
for life to her ladyship in her soft braids
I must repay. Serve her our choicest fare
while I put up my bellows and my tools.'&quot;

The story of Hephaestus's rescue by the Nereids is well known from
Homer's _Iliad_.

You've never even read Homer, have you?

Since I know that you don't read books, here is an online version; it
is Samuel Butler's translation, at the MIT Internet Classics Archive,

&lt;&gt;:

------------------------------
...Meanwhile Thetis came to the house of Vulcan, imperishable,
star-bespangled, fairest of the abodes in heaven, a house of bronze
wrought by the lame god's own hands. She found him busy with his
bellows, sweating and hard at work, for he was making twenty tripods
that were to stand by the wall of his house, and he set wheels of gold
under them all that they might go of their own selves to the assemblies
of the gods, and come back again-marvels indeed to see. They were
finished all but the ears of cunning workmanship which yet remained to
be fixed to them: these he was now fixing, and he was hammering at the
rivets. While he was thus at work silver-footed Thetis came to the
house. Charis, of graceful head-dress, wife to the far-famed lame god,
came towards her as soon as she saw her, and took her hand in her own,
saying, &quot;Why have you come to our house, Thetis, honoured and ever
welcome- for you do not visit us often? Come inside and let me set
refreshment before you.&quot;

The goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on a richly
decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under her
feet. Then she called Vulcan and said, &quot;Vulcan, come here, Thetis wants
you&quot;; and the far-famed lame god answered, &quot;Then it is indeed an august
and honoured goddess who has come here; she it was that took care of me
when I was suffering from the heavy fall which I had through my cruel
mother's anger-for she would have got rid of me because I was lame. It
would have gone hardly with me had not Eurynome, daughter of the
ever-encircling waters of Oceanus, and Thetis, taken me to their bosom.
Nine years did I stay with them, and many beautiful works in bronze,
brooches, spiral armlets, cups, and chains, did I make for them in their
cave, with the roaring waters of Oceanus foaming as they rushed ever
past it; and no one knew, neither of gods nor men, save only Thetis and
Eurynome who took care of me. If, then, Thetis has come to my house I
must make her due requital for having saved me; entertain her,
therefore, with all hospitality, while I put by my bellows and all my
tools.&quot;
------------------------------

Of course, this excerpt will doubtless confuse you because Butler uses
the Roman name Vulcan in lieu of the Greek Hephaestus.

There are of course many mutually contradictory versions of the
Hephaestus myths; however, in *none* of them is Hephaestus/Vulcan god of

Dis or Pluto to the Romans.

I suggest that you find an introductory account of Greek mythology

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He also gave up writing in Russian and began composing fiction in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; English. In his afterword to _Lolita_ he claimed: &quot;My private

&gt; had

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --------------

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Elizabeth confusing the excerpt from Nabokov's prose quoted by
&gt; Lynne
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with a poem? Or did Elizabeth merely halucinate the presence of a
&gt; poem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in Lynne's post?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or, perhaps Elizabeth is confusing Lynne's post with mine: both of
&gt; us
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quoted Nabokov's reflection upon the pain occasioned by abandoning his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; native Russian, but my post also quoted a poem by Nabokov on
&gt; discovering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a new species of butterfly. Is Elizabeth confusing the two of us?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Mind you, I have no objection to being confused with Lynne, but Lynne
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; might feel differently about the matter.) And if so, is Elizabeth
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually under the impression that Nabokov's poem was written by
&gt; Lynne?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps Elizabeth is talking about my damn fine parody of Tolkien.
&gt;&gt; One would like to think so -- but if so, what are Elizabeth's encomia
&gt;&gt; (are you there, Art?) doing in this thread, in a followup to your post
&gt;&gt; concerning Nabokov's pain at abandoning his native Russian?
&gt;&gt;&gt; EVer hopeful when it comes to being praised. :)
&gt;&gt; It is indeed a VERy fine, most amusing parody. But I would be
&gt;&gt; astonished if Elizabeth had read Tolkien -- or if she had, that she
&gt;&gt; could actually remember any of it well enough to recognize a parody
&gt;&gt; thereof (after all, she did not recognize Nabokov's burlesque of
&gt;&gt; anti-Stratfordians, nor does she recognize Peter Groves's irony).

&gt;&gt; In any case, your Tolkien/Gamgee parody, marvelous as it was, hardly
&gt;&gt; seems likely to elicit encomia like &quot;that poem you wrote was lighter
&gt;&gt; than air--it hardly seemed attached to the page&quot;:
&gt; It's funny you should say that. Many, many years ago my husband and I wrote
&gt; a musical version of The Hobbit, but we included some poems From LOTR. It
&gt; was particularly easy for me to write a parody of &quot;Troll Sat Alone On His
&gt; Seat of Stone&quot; the other day because I could still hear my husband's
&gt;&quot;lighter than air&quot; tune to it in my mind.

&gt; Apparently I wrote my own lyrics to some tunes. When a school performed The

CHAPTER 20
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Vulcan gave me a very concise account of Mount Etna: he said it was
nothing more than an accumulation of ashes thrown from his forge;
that he was frequently obliged to chastise his people, at whom,

in his passion he made it a practice to throw RED-HOT COALS at home,

which they often parried with great dexterity,
and then threw them up into the world to place them
out of his reach, for they never attempted to assault him
in return by throwing them back again. &quot;Our quarrels,&quot; added
he, &quot;last sometimes three or four months, and these appearances of coals
or cinders in the world are what I find you mortals call eruptions.&quot;
Mount Vesuvius, he assured me, was another of his shops, to which he
had a passage three hundred and fifty leagues under the bed of the sea,
where similar quarrels produced similar eruptions. I should have
continued here as an humble attendant upon Madam Venus, but some
busy tattlers, who delight in mischief, whispered a tale in Vulcan's ear,
which roused in him a fit of jealousy not to be appeased. Without
the least previous notice he took me one morning

UNDER HIS ARM, as I was waiting upon VENUS,
agreeable to custom, and carried me to an apartment

I had never before seen, in which there was, to all appearance, a well
with a wide mouth: over this he held me at arm's length, and saying,
&quot;Ungrateful mortal, return to the world from whence you came,&quot; without
giving me the least opportunity of reply, dropped me in the CENTRE. I
found myself descending with an increasing rapidity, till the horror of
my mind deprived me of all reflection. I suppose I fell into a trance,
from which I was suddenly roused by plunging into a large body of

water illuminated by THE RAYS OF THE SUN!!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He also gave up writing in Russian and began composing fiction in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; English. In his afterword to _Lolita_ he claimed: &quot;My private
&gt;&gt; tragedy,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which cannot, and indeed should not, be anybody's concern, is that
I
&gt;&gt; had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to abandon my natural idiom, my untrammeled, rich, and infinitely

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Russian tongue for a second-rate brand of English, devoid of any

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; frac-tails flying, can magically use to transcend the heritage in
his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; own way.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lovely quote, don't you think? Although I'm not entirely sure what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;frac-tails&quot; are.

What are you trying to do, Webb? Are you trying to make us
think that your version of the fall of Hephaestus was taken
from the Loeb Classical Library?

Your account of Hephaistos is vastly closer to the one posted
on mythinglink.org than it is to any of the translations of
Homer you posted below.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
You wrote:

----------------------------------------
In fact, ACCORDING TO MANY accounts, when Hephaestus was cast down from
Olympus, HE WAS INJURED, but was rescued NEAR LEMNOS by the NEREIDS
THETIS AND EURYNOME, who HID HIM FROM HIS MOTHER Hera in THEIR
SUBMARINE GROTTO. (emphasis mine)

And on mythinglinks.org:

...MOST SOURCES claim that Hephaestus landed in the sea NEAR LEMNOS,
and was washed up on the shore, WHERE HE LAY BROKEN until rescued by
the NEREIDS, THETIS AND EURYNOME (mother of the Graces). They then HID
HIM FROM HIS MOTHER who, ashamed of him, would have continued to harm
him.
Secretly Hephaestus lived with these GODDESSES IN THEIR UNDERWATER
CAVES for nine years.

&lt;&gt;
--------------------------------------

Submarine grotto, Art's ass.

It's the SAME IMAGERY in the SAME ORDER, Webb, and
some of it is even VERBATIM.

Here's Fitzgerald's Homer which bears little resemblence
to what you apparently copped off the medium's website:

'Ah, then we have a visitor I honor.
She was my savior, after the long fall
and fractures that I had to bear, when Mother,
bitch that she is, wanted to hide her cripple.
That would have been a dangerous time, had not
Thetis and Eur´ynomê taken me in --
Eur´ynomê, daughter of the tidal Ocean.
Nine years I stayed, and fashioned works of art,
brooches and spiral bracelets, necklaces,
in their smooth cave . . .&quot;

Paraphrasing, as you well know, is a violation equivalent
to direct quotation without citation.

Stephanie, too, was imprudent enough to impugn the competence of
*real* literary historians; this lapse made her pronouncement that
Caxton and Shakespeare were contemporaries especially entertaining.

Congenial anti-Stratfordians like Lynne, lyra, Peter Farey, and
others who do not engage in this practice are very unlikely to become
the figures of fun that you, Elizabeth, Faker, and a few others have
made of yourselves, if only because they are sentient enough to
recognize the competence and the contributions of genuine historians,
even if they do not always agree with the interpretations.

&gt;&gt; Oh, yes, of course. I had been thinking of the Jewish Golem
&gt;&gt; today for a story and somehow transposed the two names.

I wonder why Tolkien picked the name? Also by some association, the word is
linked with pools of water and also with gold, deception and
self-deception - it couldn't have been naive, but a coining, so to speak.

I note that Ben Jonson used GOLD-END-MAN; a character who buys broken pieces
of gold and silver.

There are other associations with GOLE~ and 'gool' indicating a whirl pool.

Than syr Gawaine the gude a galaye he takys
And glides up at a gole with gud mens or armes.
/Morte Arthure, MS Lincoln, f. 92

The stems gol~ and gold~ are A. Sax., and commonly attributed to plants and
insects, used as verb, noun and adjective. GOLD-HEWEN; of a golden colour
[A. Sax].

I was trying to find an early use of GHO`ST, which is an unusual formation
of stem letters, and it appears to be [Shak.]

GUIE~ means to guide [Fairfax], while GUILERY means deceit [Derby]. GULDE
means gold [Ritson] and a GUIMAD is a fish mentioned by Skinner as caught in
the river Dee. Of course GUINIVER also has watery associations, or rather
her asssociates had, as Launcelot du Lake, eg. Famous for her gallantries,
the term 'a guiniver' was applied to any such 'flighty' woman.

GULL: (1) a dupe or fool. Very common in the old dramatists. (3) To sweep
away by the force of running water.

GULLE: Gay, fine; [A. Sax] ~gyl?
The Jewes alle of that gate
Wex all fulle gulle and grene.
/MS Harl. 4196, f. 206

Dekker uses GULL-GROPERS in Satiro-Mastix; userers.

GULLY: a small stream, ditch, &amp;c
GYLE: (1) deceit, cit. MSS Ashmole, Cantab, Harl. (2) a vessel in which ale
is worked, spelt variously, most common is GAIL, but also gylefatts,
Gylynghous

You mean Lynn's imitation of Tolkien's imitation of &quot;The Fox&quot;? (Though
Tolkien and Lynn, to give them credit, add internal rhymes that are not
in the original scheme, and use legitimate feminine rhymes without the
old &quot;-o&quot; device of balladry.)

The fox went out on a chilly night,
He prayed for the moon to give him light,
For he'd many a mile to go that night,
Before he reached the town-o, town-o, town-o,
He'd many a mile to go that night,
Before he reached the town-o.

He ran til he came to a great big pen,
Where the ducks and the geese were put therein,
&quot;A couple of you will grease my chin,
Before I leave this town-o, town-o, town-o,
A couple of you will grease my chin,
Before I leave this town-o.&quot;

He grabbed the gray goose by the neck,
Throwed a duck across his back,
He didn't mind their quack, quack, quack,
And their legs a-dangling down-o, down-o, down-o,
He didn't mind their quack, quack, quack,
And their legs a-dangling down-o.

Then old Mother Flipper-Flopper jumped out of bed,
Out of the window she cocked her head,
Crying, &quot;John, John! The gray goose is gone,
And the fox is on the town-o, town-o, town-o!&quot;
Crying, &quot;John, John! The gray goose is gone,
And the fox is on the town-o!&quot;

Then John, he went to the top of the hill,
Blowed his horn both loud and shrill,
The fox he said, &quot;I better flee with my kill,
Or they'll soon be on my trail-o, trail-o, trail-o!&quot;
The fox he said, &quot;I better flee with my kill,
Or they'll soon be on my trail-o!&quot;

He ran till he came to his cozy den,
There were the little ones, eight, nine, ten,
They said, &quot;Daddy, better go back again,
'Cause it must be a mighty fine town-o, town-o, town-o!&quot;
They said, &quot;Daddy, better go back again,
'Cause it must be a mighty fine town-o!

Then the fox and his wife without any strife,
Cut up the goose with a fork and knife,
They never had such a supper in their life,
And the little ones chewed on the bones-o, bones-o, bones-o,
They never had such a supper in their life,
And the little ones chewed on the bones-o.

&quot;Lighter than air?&quot;&quot;Errantry&quot; must be pure cavourite!

Damn! Although it's obviously not surprising, a-priori, that it should
have been done that year, I was hoping the interval to have been longer.

I've been preparing the text, on spec. Current editions are a little
sloppy, and all omit Dunlap's 40 pages of back matter, which has plunged
me into a nightmare of footnotes on footnotes, and altogether too much
of the verse of Anna &quot;The Swan of Lichfield&quot; Seward (which Scott called
mostly &quot;execrable&quot;).

(On the other hand, it has led me by chance to discover &quot;History of
Amelia, or Malevolence Defeated&quot;, a positively magnificent illustration
of why Jane Austen is a great novelist and other people aren't, which I
have preserved for the digital age at
&lt;URL:&gt;.)

I quite like &quot;André&quot;. It takes a certain effort to put oneself into
sympathy with 18th-century tragedy, but, that once done, &quot;André&quot; seems
notable for its spareness. In its tight timeframe and avoidance of
physical action on stage, it seems almost Greek.

At the very least, you have to give Dunlap credit for sheer balls,
writing a tragedy about André when Washington was still alive (and had
only recently been a familiar sight in New York), and opening a play
about the American Revolution with an anti-war speech. And Dunlap's
pentameter is far more supple than the usual Frenchified thump of the age.

No, I wasn't being sarcastic. If I had been, you wouldn't have had to
wonder. ;)

It was very easy. I had Tolkien's map to follow. And he, apparently, had the
Fox song. I had never realised that till John mentioned it; however, I do
feel that the Tolkien improves on the original because of all his internal
rhyme.

If I'd have known there would be so much follow up, I would have spent more
than ten minutes on it. I have written lyrics that used Tolkien's rhyme
scheme and even some of his rhyming words, simply because my husband had
written music to his poems and then couldn't publish because of copyright
restrictions. Maybe I'll post one on Galadriel which I changed into a song
about Ophelia. Very ornate. Wouldn't write that way today. But I wrote it
almost thirty years ago when &quot;Child&quot; songs were still in fashion.

Elizabeth,

This is a rewrite of the song sometimes called &quot;Luthien Tenuvial,&quot; which
begins:

The leaves were long, the grass was green,
the hemlock-umbels tall and fair,
And in the glade a light was seen
Of stars in shadow shimmering.
Tinuviel was dancing there
To music of a pipe unseen,
And light of stars was in her hair,
And in her raiment glimmering.

(Tolkien, LOTR)

I had thought it was Galadriel's song, but it has been so many years since I
rewrote it that I had forgotten. I squirmed when I copied some of my lines
here, such as &quot;her heart beat hollow bleak despair&quot; but have left them as
is. I find the last stanza in particular way overwritten--sigh--but was very
young when I wrote it. I wish I could send it with my husband's music, which
is wonderful.

OPHELIA

The sunset shimmered on the lake,
Beneath the forest dappled fair;
White lilies dreaming scarce awake
Amongst the dark leaves glistening.
A spirit came a-wandering there,
And tears were in the words she spake,
As twined she violets in her hair,
The silent water listening.

She peered at her reflection dim,
Through velvet fronds of purple-green,
And caught a ghostly glimpse of him,
Who left her nightly sorrowing.
Her fingers plucked an errant beam
Of sunlight from the lakeside rim;
Her hair pale golden haloed sheen,
The sunbeam's royalty borrowing.

She bowed her head. Enchantment wove
Exquisite dreams in brightest hue,
Which hung upon departed love
Like gaudy bubbles quivering.
Her waking mind sensed them untrue,
She gazed at shadowed clouds above,
The skyline black, transcending blue
Embraced her body shivering.

Her heart beat hollow bleak despair
Her mind desired eternal sleep,
She raked her long nails through her hair
The dying violets fingering.
She slipped into the waters deep
To find dark secrets slumbering,
Her tortured soul a tryst to keep,
With twilight softly lingering.

That's nice, Lynne, but can you top W. S. Gilbert's thoughts on the
subject in The Mountebanks?

PIETRO. Nonsense! Hamlet and Ophelia never married. It would be
trifling with the text.
BARTOLO. Anyhow, it's a new reading. What! am I to be the only Hamlet
who is not permitted to discover new readings? Bah!

TRIO. - NITA, BARTOLO, and PIETRO.

PIETRO. Ophelia was a dainty little maid,
Who loved a very melancholy Dane;
Whose affection of the heart, so it is said,
Preceded his affection of the brain.
Heir-apparent to the Crown,
He thought lightly of her passion,
Having wandered up and down,
In an incoherent fashion,
When she found he wouldn't wed her
In a river, in a meadder,
Took a header, and a deader
Was Ophelia!

ALL. When she found he wouldn't wed her, etc.

NITA. Ophelia to her sex was a disgrace,
Whom nobody could feel compassion for.
Ophelia should have gone to Ely Place
To consult an eminent solicitor.
When such promises as these
Breaks a suitor, rich and regal,
Why, substantial damages
Is the panacea legal -
From a jury - son of Adam,
Though as stony as Macadam,
Maid or madam, she's have had 'em
Would Ophelia!

ALL. From a jury - son of Adam, etc.

BARTOLO. There's a venerable proverb in my mind,
Which applies to this catastrophe, I think,
To a horse who is unfortunately blind
Any nod is just as good as any wink.
Opportunity I'll seize
Of avoiding any error;
Of substantial damages
I have always had a terror.
That calamity to parry
Not a moment will I tarry,
Off I'll carry and I'll marry
Poor Ophelia!

ALL. That calamity to parry, etc.

Lynne,

It's got lovely romantic imagery yet I can see
its descent from the bards. I can only imagine a
man singing it, accompanied by one of those
oversized Renaissance lutes.

Thanks for posting it.

It seems to be the obvious response to the obvious implication of your

Americans like to create Latinate neologisms.

Therefore, Shakespeare was most probably an American.

Aphra Behn? Henry Wadsworth Longfellow? William Dunlap (who at least has
the advantage of being a known writer of English-language verse drama)?
Ezra Pound? Oh! What about Percy MacKaye? That would answer so /many/

&gt; What are you trying to do, Webb? Are you trying to make us
&gt; think that your version of the fall of Hephaestus was taken
&gt; from the Loeb Classical Library?

"/>

No, you cannot read. I told you that my brief précis of the story
comes from many sources, most prominently the Homeric Hymn to Pythian
Apollo (which I posted in a translation by Martin West from one of the
Loeb volumes) and from Homer's _Iliad_ (from which I posted the
pertinent text from Book 18). Get someone to read my post to you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your account of Hephaistos is vastly closer to the one posted
&gt; on mythinglink.org than it is to any of the translations of
&gt; Homer you posted below.

&gt; You wrote:

&gt; ----------------------------------------
&gt; In fact, ACCORDING TO MANY accounts, when Hephaestus was cast down from
&gt; Olympus, HE WAS INJURED,

"/>

That's what Homer's _Iliad_ says:

&quot;after the long fall AND FRACTURES THAT I HAD TO BEAR...&quot;
[emphasis added]

I cannot fathom why you think that &quot;where he lay broken&quot; is any closer
to &quot;he was injured&quot; than &quot;...and fractures that I had to bear&quot; is --
probably because English is not your native tongue. The fact is that
your online &quot;source&quot; derives the story from Homer, as I did, so it is
not at all surprising -- save to an idiot -- that both your source and I
mention Hephaestus's injury, albeit using different words.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but was rescued NEAR LEMNOS by the NEREIDS
&gt; THETIS AND EURYNOME,

"/>

Huh? Why are you surprised that all three of Homer, I, and your
source mention the names of Hephaestus's rescuers?! You clearly have
not thought this through very carefully. (Incidentally, any literate
person aware of the parentage of Thetis and Eurynome calls the two of
them Nereids, as both were daughters of Nereus.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; who HID HIM FROM HIS MOTHER Hera

"/>

That's exactly what both the sources that I quoted say:

Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo:

&quot;I picked him up and threw him in the broad sea, but Nereus'
daughter, Thetis silverfoot, took him in and looked after
him together with her sisters....&quot;

_Iliad_:

&quot;That would have been a dangerous time, had not
Thetis and Eur´ynomê taken me in....Only Thetis
knew, and Eur´ynomê, the two who saved me.&quot;

And why are surprised at my use of the word &quot;mother&quot;? Hera was, after
all, Hephaestus's mother, and the _Iliad_ mentions the relationship
explicitly:

&quot;She was my savior, after the long fall
and fractures that I had to bear, when MOTHER,
bitch that she is, wanted to hide her cripple.&quot;
[emphasis added]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; in THEIR
&gt; SUBMARINE GROTTO. (emphasis mine)

"/>

Neither your source nor the ones that I quoted uses the terminology
&quot;submarine grotto&quot;; that alone ought to make it clear to anyone with an
elementary education that I was not claiming to *quote* or to paraphrase
any particular; I was merely retelling the story, well known from
mulitple source, in my own words.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And on mythinglinks.org:

&gt; ...MOST SOURCES claim that Hephaestus landed in the sea NEAR LEMNOS,
&gt; and was washed up on the shore, WHERE HE LAY BROKEN until rescued by
&gt; the NEREIDS, THETIS AND EURYNOME (mother of the Graces). They then HID
&gt; HIM FROM HIS MOTHER who, ashamed of him, would have continued to harm
&gt; him.
&gt; Secretly Hephaestus lived with these GODDESSES IN THEIR UNDERWATER
&gt; CAVES for nine years.

&gt;&lt;http://www.mythinglinks.org/euro~west~greece~Hephaestus.html&gt;

"/>

I have never seen this particular summary, but it confirms everything
that I have noted thus far; in particular, it is quite sufficient to
refute your ridiculous claims that &quot;In Greece Hespaestus [sic] only
worked underground&quot; (as we have seen, he spent nearly a decade under the
sea) and that &quot;the Romans made Vulcan/Hespaestus [sic] the ruler of the
underworld.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Submarine grotto, Art's ass.

Of course -- the source you quoted also derives from Homer, so it is
scarcely surprising that it tells the story in the same order.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Webb, and
&gt; some of it is even VERBATIM.

You mean, words like &quot;mother,&quot;&quot;Thetis,&quot; and &quot;Eurynome&quot;? Remarkable!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Paraphrasing, as you well know, is a violation equivalent
&gt; to direct quotation without citation.

"/>

No, paraphrasing is perfectly fine, provided one doesn't claim the
work as one's own. People paraphrase myths all the time. You really
should read some mythology some time -- it might even inspire you to
read the _Iliad_.

&gt;&gt; Words transport history, Webb. Sir Isaiah Berlin was a native speaker
&gt;&gt; of English of the fullest expression.
&gt; You delight in parading your ignorance, don't you? Berlin was born
&gt; in Latvia and only emigrated at the age of eleven. He acquired fluency
&gt; in English by virtue of an excellent education at a young enough age.
&gt;&gt; You, for some reason, are not.
&gt;&gt; I shall lay the blame on Marxism since I detect that or some other
&gt;&gt; extremist ideology in your savaging of Art and Baker (in your limited
&gt;&gt; English expression).
&gt; You are still confusing Groucho Marx with Karl Marx -- not that you
&gt; would be able to tell the difference even if someone pointed it out to
&gt; you.
&gt;&gt; You won't be able to do that to me, Webb, because I know why Nabokov, a
&gt;&gt; native speaker of English,
&gt; You really relish parading your ignorance, don't you? Nabokov had
&gt; learned English as a boy from an English tutor, and he spoke a child's
&gt; English with the same ease as Russian (and he read English easily and
&gt; voraciously), but Nabokov himself identified Russian as his native
&gt; tongue. I refer you to Nabokov's 1962 BBC interview in Zermatt with
&gt; Peter Duval-Smith and Christopher Burstall, where Nabokov discusses his
&gt; painful switch from Russian to English:

&gt;&quot;Yes, that was a very difficult kind of switch. My private tragedy,
&gt; which cannot, indeed should not, be anybody's concern, is that I had
&gt; to abandon my natural language, my rich, infinitely rich and docile
&gt; Russian tongue, for a second-rate brand of English.&quot;

&gt; You can find the quotation in question on page 15 of the Vintage edition
&gt; of Nabokov's _Strong Opinions_; see if you can find someone willing to
&gt; read it you.

&gt; Second, I refer you to the Nabokov interview appearing in _The Paris
&gt; Review_ of October 1967. Herbert Gold asked Nabokov: &quot;Do you feel you
&gt; have any conspicuous or secret flaw as a writer?&quot; Nabokov replied:

&gt;&quot;The absence of a natural vocabulary. An odd thing to confess, but
&gt; true. Of the two instruments in my possession, one -- my native
&gt; tongue

&gt; [Note that Nabokov identifies Russian as his native tongue.]

&gt; -- I can no longer use, and this not only because of a lack of a
&gt; Russian audience, but also because the excitement of verbal
&gt; adventure in the Russian medium has faded away gradually after I
&gt; turned to English in 1940. My English, this second instrument I
&gt; have always had, is however a stiffish, artificial thing, which
&gt; may be all right for describing a sunset or an insect, but which
&gt; cannot conceal poverty of syntax and paucity of domestic diction
&gt; when I need the shortest road between warehouse and shop. [...]&quot;

&gt; Then there is Nabokov's 1943 poem originally entitled &quot;On Disovering a
&gt; Butterfly&quot;:

&gt;&quot;I found it in a legendary land
&gt; all rocks and lavender and tufted grass
&gt; where it was settled on some sodden sand
&gt; hard by the torrent of a mountain pass.

&gt; The features it combines mark it as new
&gt; to science: shape and shade -- the special tinge
&gt; akin to moonlight, tempering its blue,
&gt; the dingy underside, the checquered fringe.

&gt; My needles have teased out its sculptured sex;
&gt; corroded tissues could no longer hide
&gt; that priceless mote now dimpling the convex
&gt; and limpid teardrop on a lighted side.

&gt; Smoothly a screw is turned; out of the mist
&gt; two ambered hooks symmetrically slope,
&gt; or scales like battledores of amethyst
&gt; cross the charmed circle of a microscope.

&gt; I found it and I named it, being versed
&gt; in taxonomic Latin; thus became
&gt; godfather to an insect and its first
&gt; describer -- and I want no other fame.

&gt; Wide open its pin (though fast asleep),
&gt; and safe from creeping relatives and rust,
&gt; in the secluded stronghold where we keep
&gt; type specimens it will transcend its dust.

&gt; Dark pictures, thrones, the stones that pilgrims kiss,
&gt; poems that take a thousand years to die
&gt; but ape the immortality of this
&gt; red label on a little butterfly.&quot;

&gt; It is a lovely poem -- but in the typed fair copy that Nabokov submitted
&gt; to _The New Yorker_, the ninth line originally read:

&gt;&quot;My needles have teased out its sculptured sex&quot;.

"/>

Correction: Obviously, I meant to type&quot;

...the line in the fair copy read

&quot;My needles have teased out its horny sex,&quot;

a gaffe occasioned by Nabokov's insufficient familiarity with English,
and pointed out by his editors at _The New Yorker_.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Nabokov used the word &quot;horny&quot; in describing the male butterfly's
&gt; genitalia, an important identifying characteristic when dealing with
&gt; species that superficially look virtually identical, but he was unaware
&gt; of the word's common English sense. When Nabokov's editors at _The New
&gt; Yorker_ explained to him why the phrase was inadmissible, Nabokov
&gt; thanked them for

&gt;&quot;...saving that line from an ignorance-is-bliss disaster. And that
&gt; nightmare pun....This has somewhat subdued me -- I was getting rather
&gt; pleased with my English.&quot;

&gt; I marvel that you seem hell-bent upon displaying your ignorance -- but
&gt; if I had spent years cultivating apparently complete ignorance in
&gt; virtually every subject, perhaps I would flaunt it too.

&gt;&gt; Is this an attempted question? And has it to do with something I wrote?
&gt; It seems to be the obvious response to the obvious implication of your

&gt; Americans like to create Latinate neologisms.
&gt; The English do not.
&gt; Therefore, Shakespeare was most probably an American.
&gt; And so I ask: who is the American you have in mind? Phillis Wheatley?
&gt; Aphra Behn? Henry Wadsworth Longfellow? William Dunlap (who at least has
&gt; the advantage of being a known writer of English-language verse drama)?
&gt; Ezra Pound? Oh! What about Percy MacKaye? That would answer so /many/
&gt; questions about &quot;The Mystery of Hamlet King of Denmark or What We Will&quot;.

"/>

I'm betting that his candidate is Henry Miller.

I am frankly bored by so much contention without any other meaningful source

Old English is a general term, it is not the name of a language. It
comprises Anglo Saxon, East Saxon, and assortments of contributions from
Celtic languages, Latin, Old French, and &amp;c. It was /also/ not uniformly
spoken in England, and it /also/ changed substantially over the 700 years we
credit that it was spoken as a principal language don the Island.

In your sentence you compared O.E. with Anglo Norman for example, which is
to mix two terms. Old English is properly compared with Middle English,
which as you know is comprised of Anglo Norman, Latin, French and surviving
A. Sax [see Chaucer!]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I see you also snipped the end of

&gt; I grant it some of the strangest syntax I've ever seen.

&gt;&gt; If you intended by &quot;O.E&quot;, A. Sax.,

&gt;&quot;Old English&quot; is the correct name, except among a few prissy schoolmarms
&gt; (of both sexes) driven to misname it by the same genteelism that urged the
&gt; 18th century to dub the high middle ages &quot;gothic&quot;.

"/>

The prissy schoolmarms are correct: O.E. is no synonym for A. Sax., but a
general term, and less useful when writing about etymologies since many
words which informed A. Sax were previously in existance in other lexicons.
It is also true that many words which are not A. Sax were in use on the
Island, in fact, whole communities of people did not speak much A. Sax. and
there are great fluctuations in its use over time.

I do not think I mentioned Authorship in any context which would allow a

speech, except if we assume that the author did the same, rather than coin
his own Works on a perhaps different language - specifically NOT from a
Latinized basis.

Should you have let that statement stand, it would then become impossible
for you to project your 'sense' onto my original statement.

For the second time; why did you snip it, then argue that the context was in
some way equivocal, and so proceed to your borish speculations on 'native

If you don't care to discuss your opinions from the basis of your own
knowledge, perhaps you will understand that it can be less interesting for
others to engage them, based on certain dicking around with what already has

I don't think you have to worry too much about our production. None of the
actors was union at the time, so it didn't even qualify as a showcase;
certainly nobody got paid. Very low production values. So it was in no way
a professional production, and, for what it's worth, it was seen by only a
few dozen people. (Such was my life as a New York actor.)

I agree with your assessment of the work. It ain't the Bard, but it plays
well, and the verse is very servicable on stage. It deserves more
attention, and so does Dunlap. Good luck with it - I'd like to hear more as
you progress.

You might be interested, for contrast, in &quot;The American Revolution&quot; by Kirk
Wood Bromley, which covers a lot of the same territory. It's a modern
5-acter in pentameter. Gets done a lot around NYC by Bromley's theater
Inverse Theatre. We did it here in Cleveland last summer.

&gt;&gt; [snips]

&gt;&gt;&gt;So your new candidate for the &quot;true author&quot; is....

&gt; ...

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think I should prefer William Dunlap, myself.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And superstition's guides, now passes by;

&gt;&gt;&gt; The signal of the passing hour. &quot;All’s well,&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sounds through the camp. Alas! all is not well;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Else, why stand I, a man, the friend of man,
&gt;&gt;&gt; At midnight's depth, deck'd in this murderous guise,
&gt;&gt;&gt; The habiliment of death, the badge of dire,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Necessitous coercion. 'Tis not well.
&gt;&gt;&gt; --In vain the enlighten'd friends of suffering man

&gt;&gt;&gt; Still, age succeeds to age, and war to war;
&gt;&gt;&gt; And man, the murderer, marshals out his hosts
&gt;&gt;&gt; In all the gaiety of festive pomp,
&gt;&gt;&gt; To spread around him death and desolation.
&gt;&gt;&gt; How long! how long!----------------
&gt;&gt;&gt; -- &quot;André, a tragedy in five acts&quot;, 1798

&gt;&gt; Now, THAT brings back dreadful memories. I was actually in a production
of
&gt;&gt;&quot;Andre&quot; in NYC during the summer of 1976.

&gt; Damn! Although it's obviously not surprising, a-priori, that it should
&gt; have been done that year, I was hoping the interval to have been longer.

&gt; I've been preparing the text, on spec. Current editions are a little
&gt; sloppy, and all omit Dunlap's 40 pages of back matter, which has plunged
&gt; me into a nightmare of footnotes on footnotes, and altogether too much
&gt; of the verse of Anna &quot;The Swan of Lichfield&quot; Seward (which Scott called
&gt; mostly &quot;execrable&quot;).

&gt; (On the other hand, it has led me by chance to discover &quot;History of
&gt; Amelia, or Malevolence Defeated&quot;, a positively magnificent illustration
&gt; of why Jane Austen is a great novelist and other people aren't, which I
&gt; have preserved for the digital age at
&gt;&lt;URL: http://pws.prserv.net/jwkennedy/Amelia%20%282%29.html&gt;.)

&gt; I quite like &quot;André&quot;. It takes a certain effort to put oneself into
&gt; sympathy with 18th-century tragedy, but, that once done, &quot;André&quot; seems
&gt; notable for its spareness. In its tight timeframe and avoidance of
&gt; physical action on stage, it seems almost Greek.

&gt; At the very least, you have to give Dunlap credit for sheer balls,
&gt; writing a tragedy about André when Washington was still alive (and had
&gt; only recently been a familiar sight in New York), and opening a play
&gt; about the American Revolution with an anti-war speech. And Dunlap's
&gt; pentameter is far more supple than the usual Frenchified thump of the age.

I wondered then, as I do now with John Kennedy, why such strong opinion
could be present, absent of any actual information that would inform it?
Surely, information that supported strong opinion would be presented, if it
existed at all?

As with John Kennedy's method, you took Elizabeth Weir to task for her
assertion, but by making a counter-assertion! Is any intelligence presented
by this process?

I did not detect any at the time, certainly none which would occasion an
amount of personal abuse.

I went to that newsgroup and subscribed to it from your question. I
just finished reading that thread and must say that there seems to be
a commonality in Phil's postings across many subjects and categories.
That consistency is that Phil makes statements with only a partial
knowledge of a situation. Either he is less than educated in the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I suppose there may be a word or two in English deriving from
&gt; Icelandic,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but I don't know of any (apart from proper nouns). At any rate,
&gt;&quot;want&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;isn't one of them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So why did you snip a possible source John, or conversely, not
&gt; supply an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earlier one from your own knowledge?

&gt;&gt;&gt; English has few, if any, Icelandic roots. It has, however, a great
&gt; many
&gt;&gt;&gt; roots from Old Norse.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Stems of wan~ and won~ combine with other words to express
&gt; English
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;speech, sometimes also combining with Latin forms, 'un-wonted'
&gt; eg, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which is a bastard form.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, &quot;un-&quot; is OE and &quot;wont&quot; is OE. &quot;Want&quot; is ON, but irrelevant.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no such language as &quot;O.E.&quot; John.

&gt;&gt; One wonders what on earth he can possibly mean by this,
&gt; particularly
&gt;&gt; when he was so insistent earlier that the tongue was still spoken as
&gt;&gt; late as the 1800s in some shires.

&gt; Look for a squall of Innes posts denying his easily verifiable remarks.

&gt; (Snip nonsense from Innes)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this an attempted question? And has it to do with something I
&gt; wrote?

&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems to be the obvious response to the obvious implication of
&gt; your
&gt;&gt;&gt; remarkable statement above.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Americans like to create Latinate neologisms.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The English do not.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, Shakespeare was most probably an American.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And so I ask: who is the American you have in mind? Phillis
&gt; Wheatley?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Aphra Behn? Henry Wadsworth Longfellow? William Dunlap (who at
&gt; least has
&gt;&gt;&gt; the advantage of being a known writer of English-language verse
&gt; drama)?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ezra Pound? Oh! What about Percy MacKaye? That would answer so
&gt; /many/
&gt;&gt;&gt; questions about &quot;The Mystery of Hamlet King of Denmark or What We
&gt; Will&quot;.

&gt;&gt; I'm betting that his candidate is Henry Miller.

&gt; David, as much as I enjoy the Innes-spotting you and Peter Groves do, I
&gt; have to say that John Kennedy is in a class by himself. He's even
&gt; gotten compliments on another newsgroup about his skill.....

&gt;&quot;BTW, what do you think of Innes' claim in the Shakespeare
&gt; newsgroup HLAS that the canon of the Bible was established by the King
&gt; James translators?&quot;

&gt; I went to that newsgroup and subscribed to it from your question. I
&gt; just finished reading that thread and must say that there seems to be
&gt; a commonality in Phil's postings across many subjects and categories.
&gt; That consistency is that Phil makes statements with only a partial
&gt; knowledge of a situation. Either he is less than educated in the
&gt; areas or he has a blind spot for pertinent facts. It seems that this
&gt; Kennedy fellow laid Phil to waste.

Art,

When one signals that one is talking about
a myth, a different logic applies, that is,
all assertions, whether true or false, are
categorically false. Dodson doesn't apply
because he's doing real logic in the genre
of satire. This mixture of lunacy with
logic or empirical observation descends
from Don Quixote, not classical myth or
medieval romance.

Nice excerpt, though.

Elizabeth

Several of these words are modernisms Elizabeth, and euphemistic
substitutions.

To take the later first, what is 'literal' means 'of what is written' - and
so is 'the truth' in as much as we report what is written, but does not
imply an implicit veracity of the text in the comprehension of what it
reports:-

and there is often a conflation of terms such as mythological, which is not
synonymous with what is historical. History is an exoteric record of events.
A mythos is an esoteric record of consciousness.

A result is that a 'literal truth' which reports events as being
historically true (or otherwise) is not in fact any address to what is a
mythological truth.

This was the case with the Greeks and also Egyptians. If we attempt to
understand their records and artifacts only from an historical perspective
of outward events, I suggest that we miss the point of the initial record
which may have more to do with an intersection between what might be called
mythic space [or consciousness] and linear events [or history].

That is, between space and time.

Cordially, Phil Innes

Of course not, Art -- when you don't know what you're talking about,
it's best not to express yourself too clearly.

Maybe he is a French speaker. My impression of French (have not studied
this scientifically) is that sentences seem to start with a noun
phrase, so you might see &quot;It is a difference between English and
Americans...&quot; rather than &quot;Americans and English differ...&quot; Just a
preference of style, I guess.

I liked the poem, but couldn't figure out or find all the words. Maybe
Chess One likes to think of words in many different languages,
including older ones, then translate them to English, so his language
sounds dyffranz than the usual. Sounds like fun. I have had some
trouble learning languages, particularly older ones, so I am avidly
reading your chat.

It would be great if Shakespeare were American, maybe Phillis Wheatley.

That was true before Sidney and Bacon, or at least
Bacon, created an unembellished rhetoric that
could express things 'literally.' in the sense
of 'a literal description.'

Non-contradictorily, the Sidney-Bacon rhetoric
could then be used to express things metaphorically,
to get at the 'more than literal truth.'

We see Oxford or at least his paid poets, clinging
to euphuisms and figures.

For some reason, Oxfordians see this as proof that
Oxford wrote the Shakespeare works. The works are
a refutation of Oxford/Lyly's Euphuisms.

The undoing of the word and thing ca 1900
(18th c. in Europe) is the reason that Oxfordians
proceed 'as if' they had evidence. The word is
superior to the thing, higher, finer and purer
and therefore 'true.'

Baconians and Stratfordians are only wallowing
in the a posteriori muck of evidence.

and Thucydides, the essential vaccination against
confusing myth with history.
