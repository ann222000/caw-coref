A new month awaits...

Outside the freezing rain is coming down, one of those days you wish you
could just snuggle up at home under a warm blanket while sipping some hot
coffee or tea.
Sitting here at my desk I put together a "rainy day" mix of songs to listen
to while working. Of course Led Zeppelin's "The Rain Song" is required as
well as some more
obscure tunes from the likes Chuck Mangione (master of the flugelhorn) and
The Smiths...

The past month has been a whirlwind of excitement and growth. Things are
starting to happen at a fast pace and it is hard right now to get a grip on
the wheel.
Some highlights (if you hadn't heard about them before):

* First paying speaking engagement - Oakland CRC in Hamilton, MI. They heard
me on JQ99fm and inquired about having me come out to speak.
One of the comments I received was encouraging, "It wasn't just about your
weight loss. Anyone in the audience could have taken something away from
what
you had to say and apply it to their own lives..."

* Featured on MacMedia Television's "Lakeshore Living" with Wendy Wigger -
turns out the host of the program is the director of wellness at Priority
Health.
She is planning on contacting me in the future to come out and speak to
their clients.

* Yet another article in the Holland Sentinel - promoting my speaking
engagement at Herrick Library and also my fledgling business, 4:13 Fitness
Concepts

* Featured on WZZM-13's "Real People" segment - promoting my speaking
engagement at Herrick Library (scroll down the list to find it)

* Speaking engagement at Herrick Library - around 127 people signed up to
come in and hear me speak, about 80-90 showed up. The original venue was
booked at least
a month prior and there was a waiting list. I spoke with the coordinator
about it and she was able to get the auditorium at Herrick Library which can
seat up to 200 people.
I had a great response for a new venture I am starting called "Matty's
Motivators", which is an email accountability program. 18 people have signed
up so far, which I think is a great response!

* www.iweighedmorethanjared.com - the website is doing well, I am averaging
about 30-50 visits a day and the contest for my book title continues on.
"Almost-Dead Man Walking: 4 Keys for Successful and Realistic Weight Loss"
is the front-runner so far...

So many things, so many new opportunities to explore and expand.

I am truly happy to say that this month, despite some off days, I have ended
a 2 month stall! I weighed in this morning at 254lbs, which is a 2lbs loss!

Continue to think of me as I solicit more speaking engagements from schools,
businesses, civic groups, & churches. And don't forget to
bookmark www.iweghedmorethanjared.com to keep track of more exciting stuff!

Thank you, thank you, thank you for being a part of my support system. 3
years and counting, with the rest of my life to go...

I'm stunned. I weigh less than Matty! I'll have to start a website,

Good one! That is great Neil! I am going to bring the recumbent bike out of
storage today. I stored it because I was able to bike outside since we had
such a mild winter up until a short time ago...

And yes, I was jogging in a blizzard yesterday morning. And no, I am not
crazy - just determined...

Great stuff Matty.  As always, you are a delight to read, and an
