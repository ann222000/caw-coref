FederationofSaintChristopher and Nevis

Dear Ms Mueller

Thank you for your email and I apologise for not replying earlier but
I had to go into hospital last week and I am now catching up with my
unanswered emails.

As I have said before I cannot speak for the Presidential Board.  I am
a non voting member.  However, I can say that at the last meeting
there were some concerns expressed regarding this application.  This
was in regard to a corporate body making application without carrying
the name of the country.  Your reply to this point will be put to the
Presidential Board. The voting structure also appeared to be very
selective.  I note there is only one named officer of the federation
in the documents.

An invoice is issued to all new members and that is the time for a
payment to be made.

If Mr Roberts wants to attend the meeting entirely at his own expense,
then he can do so.  You should contact the organisers at
federati ... @fide.com for further information.

Regards

David Jarrett
Executive Director

dear Mr. Jarrett

i refer to our previous email exchange.
i got the following further information from the client:

- St. Kitts and Nevis do not allow that the names of the country is
part of any corporate name, therefore the name of the national
St.Kitts and nevis Chess assosciation is: &quot;Charleston Chess
Association LLC&quot;
- our client will try to get support lettres by the 2 ministers of
sport of St.Kitts and Nevis for the pending application with FIDE
which we would forward to you.
- does our client have to send you a new cheque for the application to
be handled by the FIDE board at its next meeting on 22/23 of septembre
in Elista, if yes how much and to which address?
- our client, represented by Mr. Marcus Roberts would like to attend
the FIDE board meeting in Elista (Russia) on 22/23 septembre with
regard to the application of the St.Kitts and Nevis chess association
to become an official FIDE member, is this possible and welcome?
please provide us with details when they are available.
- please let us urgently know if FIDE needs anything more to handle
the FIDE application of our client to become a member, in order that
we can provide you with or of you have any questions.
