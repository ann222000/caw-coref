I have an AR15 that I just keep for general home protection use. I
usually get to the range a few times every month. It has it's original
iron sights.  Does anyone with any practical experience (ie. law
enforcement, military, training, etc.) have any recommendations
regarding whether red-dot or Trijicon scopes, etc. are necessary, or
if a flashlight attachment is needed?  Thanks in advance!  Matt

An AR15, or any kind of rifle, would not be my choice for home
protection.  But if that is the only gun you have.....

If you live in an apartment building or in a house with neighbors on
all sides, you should be concerned about excessive penetration through
3 or 4 walls after it goes through the burglar.  Can you find some
hollow point ammo?

Most home protection emergencies occur at night, and you do not want
any flashlights or red dots to give the intruder a fix on your
position.  The range inside the house will be very short, and if you
can see him you can hit him without sights.  And remember: this is not
the time to start a conversation.  Just knock him down and you can
talk all you want with the police.

Well, allow me to go out on a limb here by risking the ire of all the
AR-15 fan club brigades, but I think you would be better served with a
pump 12 gauge shotgun using number 9 shot instead.
Why bird shot?
Penetration issues.
That is that any stray pellets will generally not penetrate standard
drywall structures, thus preventing collateral damage to bystanders or
family members.
Also, believe me, bird shot at home defense ranges is just as deadly as
00 buck or (worse) your AR-15 with hollowpoint or softpoints, without
risking overpenetration.
Bad guys will drop to the equivalent of an entire revolver of .38
specials striking all at once.
I'm not questioning the power of the .223, but I think you would be
better served by something with still more knockdown power and limited
penetration.

I too have an AR for home protection.  I have handguns and shotguns but it's the
AR that's my 'go to' gun.  Don't let anyone give you any grief about it.  Up
close, it's got excellent stopping power - certainly more than any handgun.
Nearly zero recoil and muzzle flash make it a good night fighter.

I'm not sure that I'd want a flashlight attached to the rifle but having one - a
good one, such as the SureFire - at hand is a good idea.

I have an Armson OEG (the forerunner of the Trijicon Reflex sights) for my AR
but I'm also left eyed and don't have any problems using it.  At this time, the
radioactive element is dead and I'm waiting for them to get new one's in - I
don't feel at all disadvantaged with the iron sights.  Unless you have a huge
budget for toys and the resolve to actually learn to use the reflex type sights,
I suspect that iron sights will serve you well enough.  Trijicon is awfully
proud of their products and the price reflects that - however, I wouldn't use
anything that hasn't been proven in combat.  Essentially, I tend to go with the
&quot;keep it simple&quot; line.  Fewer things to go bad at the wrong time.

And, before the shotgun guys and the handgun guys come calling with their advice
as why their stuff is better than my AR - I live in the woods, have neither kids
nor neighbors to worry about and I happen to like and, more importantly, trust
my AR.
Cheers,
jc

I agree. The earlier post about not signalling your presence with a
mounted flashlight is right on.

One thing I do recommend is remote-control lighting of entry points.
If I hear a noise at the back of the house, I can turn on the light
there with a remote on the bedside table.  I can also set any of my
remote-operated light switches to come on when the outside security
lights turn on via their motion sensors.  For example, the corner light
at the front of the house turns on the porchlight.

All this with X10 switches. They are cheap, and let you light up a
problem area, temporarily blinding the subject, while you evaluate the
the situation from a still-dark location.

Matt, nothing you mention above is essential however we do have a
tendency to get dazzled by foot work when it comes to accessories so
we convince ourselves more or less to keep up with the Jone's. You've
been shooting your rifle several times a month so by now you would be
best to say what improvements you want. One of my first improvements
was to install one of those wedge spacer things (forgot the name) that
lake up the room between the web of my hand and the rear top of the
hand-grip. Without it I was getting too much finger across the
trigger.

My second choice was to change the pistol grip to a Hogue
http://www.dallastacticalsupplies.com/RSR_Images/HO15000_1.JPG
but in retrospect a Urgo grip may of been better because it also takes
up the space between the grip and hand and killing both birds.
http://aceltdusa.com/images04/AR15/ERGOGrip_M16E_med.jpg

As for your question on a dot sight, how's your peepers? In my younger
days peep sights were fine but father time is taking its toll so I
opted for a Leupold/Gilmore dot sight w/4moa dot. It may not be one of
the best (expensive) ones going but leaps and bounds over the $35
dollar specials http://www.nealjguns.com/ss_store/media/39LG35TT2.jpg

I'd suggest if you going to install any type of optics I would also
recommend putting it on a quality mount. My Bushmaster is of the A2
configuration so my carry handle mount is a A.R.M.S.#2 It also has a
generous opening beneath the sight should the batteries go dead and
the iron sight is needed http://www.armsmounts.com/catalog.php?action=124&amp;item;_id=1

Lastly and for our type of general use not really needed (one of those
Jone's things) I bought a Jewell trigger
http://www.knsprecisioninc.com/Images/Jewell%20Trigger%20Systems.jpg
I've found with usege stock AR triggers settle in fairly well for
typical general shooting but if you want to get technical an ajustable
trigger is a nice improvement.

With that particular rifle that's as far as I chosen to go for it's
intended need but obviously just the tip of the accessory iceberg,
it's a matter of what you need vs what you want. If you are intending
to buy on-line do plenty of price checking because some items may
differ from $20+ or-dollars depending on what sight your looking at,
also the pic addresses above weren't meant for endorsement, just to
give you a visual. have fun...

Well this is what I did........

I got an upper with all the bells and whistles that I could afford /
want for my &quot;tactical&quot; rifle (flat top, rails, red dot, folding sights
etc...).  And then I went out and got an upper and built a varmint
rifle.  Finally I put together a National Match Service set up with
another upper!!  WoooHoooo!

My AR fits my multiple personalities very well!!

Just have fun with it!

For a non-shooting intimidation situation where you want to scare the
bad guy off, a bayonet. Personally I feel a shotgun is the best bet
for home defence. An AR is going to send the slug through the bad guy,
walls and who knows what else before it stops.

Perhaps with FMJ ammo but even then likely not.  At close ranges the small .22
cal bullets are at the most unstable point in their flight and tend to break up
and not penetrate so deeply.  I make sure of that by using soft point ammo.  Up
close the .223 is extremely deadly.  It's only beyond 100 yards or so that I
believe they become less effective and reliable on human targets.  Personally,
I consider the max range to be 150 yards and anything beyond nothing more than
wishful thinking.   (Please note that, having been through this many times in
the past, I must insist that everyone take the following into consideration:
this range conclusion is based on specific things:  my rifle, the ammo it's
loaded with and, most importantly, my experience with this combination.  Others
can base their own conclusions on whatever they like - I am not in the least
interested in any ballistic charts, alternate experience or whatever else
someone might  care to offer as to why they think I am wrong about my range
conclusions.  I am not proposing this as an absolute rule nor do I suggest that
anyone else go by these figures.  I'm just stating what I think are the
limitations on my rifle/ammo combination.  If you don't agree, that's fine.  I
don't care to hear about it).

Now, all that said, I do agree with the bayonet proposal and in fact, I have one
near by that I can stick on if I feel the need.  I have a huge muzzle flash
hider on my AR (it improved the accuracy substantially) and the bayonet only
sticks out about 6&quot; or so but what the hell, if nothing else it looks pretty bad
ass.  And I think in some situations, looking bad assed can be an advantage.
Cheers,
jc

An excellent point, Rex, you are absolutely correct.  I have motion lights in
some places and others where lights can be turned on from any of 3 different
locations in the house... the master bedroom, the kitchen and basement.  It's
something easily arranged when you have your house built the way you want.  On
par with installing my own personal 100 yard bench rest set up in the back yard,
in fact.

I'll respect you request on challenging your findings and actually
agree but for different reasons. For various reasons mine is strictly
on ability and 150yds these days is within my gotcha range. In the
hands of a more prominent marksman I'm sure the range could be double
but with me it would be much like poke and hope and why now I do
nearly all my hunting with handguns, takes a lot of the guess work out
if I do my part within perspective...

If the were &quot;necessary&quot; they would have been included in the original
design.  Now, what accessories one may or may not &quot;need&quot; for any
weapon system depends on its primary purpose in life.

With your statement that this weapon system is used for &quot;general home
protection&quot;, I'd submit you don't need any accessories for it, you
need a different weapon.  An AR15 is not the best weapon for home
defense, although it does beat a big stick.

Now if you really wanted to configure that AR15 for home defense,
you'd need a shorty upper in 9mm, and the flashlight wouldn't be a bad
idea either.

To make your rifle a bit handier for this situation a shorter barrel and an
optical sight would be a good idea. Even better buy a M-4 clone and put an
optical sight on it. Even better:
http://www.bushmaster.com/catalog_xm15_BCWVMF16M4ORC.asp While I am not an
expert a handgun would probably better suit your needs.

Some thoughts on you post:

A rifle is better suited for distance. If your problem is far enough away
you need a rifle it might be hard to claim you felt your life was
threatened.

A rifle might be slower to bring on target.

The ugly black rifle might make a prosecutor consider some part of your
defense excessive. You have to survive the shooting and what follows; going
to jail decreases your odds of survival.

Other posters have mentioned overpenetration and that is a real concern with
a rifle. http://www.theboxotruth.com/docs/bot1.htm Putting a medium sized
pig between the rifle and the box would probably be educational; you would
know what to expect if you hit the target.

Coming around a corner with a rifle will give an intruder advance warning of
your presence.

The space between the front sight and the flash hider is long enough to get
a good grip and force the muzzle off target.

The flash hider would probably help your intruder maintain a grip on the
barrel if you were trying to pull the rifle away from them. Pulling back on
the rifle while they were holding on to it would probably put the muzzle
over some part of their anatomy guaranteeing a hit.

None of the extras you mention are necessary.  At short ranges,
aim the rifle like a shotgun--point it at center of mass while
concentrating on the front sight.  Use frangable ammo.

Personaly, I would not use any rifle for general home use, but
if it is all you have, it's all you have...

In a home defense situation, you're going to be shooting at someone
from probably 30 feet away. You won't need a lot of fancy bells and
whistles to hit someone with a rifle at that range. Just keep the
thing loaded with good quality commercial soft or hollow points and
save the cheap ball ammo for the range.

# Ray,

I was in Mexico years ago as federalis arrived at a bank. I assume
they were guarding a pick up or delivery. I was one of a group of 6
USA tourists and we continued walking in the path toward the
federalis. As we came near, an order was said in Spanish and all the
soldiers in our path fixed bayonets on their FN-FAL's. With the
anonymity offered by the net I can admit to being scared shootless.

The order was given very simply to intimidate us and it did indeed. It
made me re-think my home defense plan. I used to keep just a GI 45
exclusively in my night stand. I now added a bayoneted 1897 Winchester
Trench Broom behind the headboard. Reason being, if I can stop a
threat without shooting, either by the noise of racking the slide or
the sight of a mean looking gun topped with a long bayonet. The battle
is over in my favor without all the legal problems.

In a nutshell, I would rather eliminate the threat without shooting
and worse, killing. Lawyers aren't cheap and I don't have a spare 50
g's laying around in case the incident wound up on the desk of an
overzealous, bleeding heart liberal prosecutor. Regardless of the
circumstances or what police might say after a shooting I will invoke
my right to silence and a lawyer guaranteeing a night in jail until
all the facts are sorted out.

#
#Ray,

I'm not talking about hunting situation, strictly combat/self defense
situations.  Hitting that far out is not a problem for me it's just that the
effectiveness of the round is too unreliable.  Sometimes it works and sometimes
it fails miserably.  Still, if in the position where such as shot is called for,
I'd take it... I just wouldn't plan on it working.  At the longer ranges I'll
take a .308 Win, assuming there's time to dig it out of the safe!

About the only way to improve your hiting ability at longer ranges is to shoot
them.  Practicing at 100 yards for a 300 yard shot might tell you what the
firearm may be capable of but the only way to prove it is to get where you can
actually shoot the distance.
Cheers,
jc

.223 FRANGIBLE, AND STILL BUY THE SHOTGUN.

#USE FRANGIBLE ROUNDS!!!

Generally speaking, at the ranges we are talking  about (home defense, 50' or
less) virtually all .223 bullets are frangible.  Contrary to popular belief,
over penetration in this situation is not likely to be an issue.

The problem centers around even your use of the word &quot;generally&quot;!
Yes....generally, &quot;virtually all&quot;, most of the time, nearly all of the time,
any .223 bullet is going to be &quot;frangible&quot; at &quot;home defense&quot; ranges....but
that is NOT the same as _ALL_ the time, and it only takes ONE to cause an
unnecessary tragedy.  Maybe &quot;close enough&quot; is &quot;good enough&quot; for you.....it
wouldn't be for me, which is why I use something else (of the
shotgun/handgun persuasion) for &quot;home defense&quot;.

John there is no such thing as 100% on any of the topics we are discussing.
I've seen frangibles fail to come apart as they're supposed to.  So none of it
is going to work _ALL_ the time, period.  It's a simple fact of life.  In this
case, close enough is all you're ever going to get.  Even your shotgun/handgun
perusasion falls into that category and if you think otherwise, you're fooling
yourself.

I am going with the odds and the odds are that .223 rounds are not going to
overpenetrate at the ranges we're talking about.  The odds are also very high
that it's going to stop a human in their tracks.  I have absoultely no concern
of overpenetration, other than a hole in the wall to patch if it does or if I
miss.  The same applies to a handgun or shotgun, except with the shotgun there
might be extra holes.
Cheers,
jc
