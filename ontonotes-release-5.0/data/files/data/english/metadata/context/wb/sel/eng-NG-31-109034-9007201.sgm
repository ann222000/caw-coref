As it happens, the newsgroup is under yet another spam attack. I
didn't bother to do an exact count, but there's at least thirty
sporgeries with their headers dealing with MI5 persecution. My gut
feeling is that more are to be expected.

Two years ago, in a similar situation, I myself and several others
suggested a concerted action against a comparable flood of Holocaust
denial. Back then, the assault was terminated and the group was rid of
a massive amount of deadwood, in spite of the persistent opposition of
a certain poster whom most of you know very well [1].

Of course, five years ago this group had an even more chronic problem
of sporgeries. Back then, the perpetrator was whacked out by Jonathan
I. Edelstein (... note to Errol Cavit, who asked from me references
for this a while ago, see http://tinyurl.com/24nnv3 as well as all
Jonathan's messages to the group from January-February 2002 in
general).

Fending off the spam attack would be doable also today - hey, it
worked two years ago, and it worked five years ago, so there's no
reason why it would not work today. However, the question is if the
newsgroup is really worth it?

For one reason or another, netcopping and maintaining a general sanity
on this group has become very unpopular among the populace. During the
recent months, certain distinguished gentleman have also railed
against &quot;goose-stepping control freaks, turning s.h.w-i into their own
private tree fort&quot; and complained of the &quot;general level of nastiness&quot;
and &quot;bile&quot; in the newsgroup (incidentally, the latter term was used by
an anonymous poster who specializes on stalking and has never posted
anything of any value to this group).

On the other hand, the group still _has_ potential. There has been
good speculation on several topics, ranging from the plausibility of
Idi Amin's return to power to the attitude of the Roosevelt
administration to the potential Canadian occupation of Iceland. But
are the positive qualities of the group substantial enough vis-à-vis
the negative qualities to make salvaging the group worth while?

My personal opinion would be &quot;no&quot;, but that's just me. At the moment,
the best option would still be to relocate somewhere else, some kind
of a community blog or whatever, where these spam attacks would not be
an issue (... and even if they were, the perpetrators could at least
be promptly denied access and exterminated without having to listen to
incessant whining from the above-described quarters).

Besides, at least I don't have time or energy to deal with these
goddamn things any longer. I'm currently focusing on the treatment of
severe war neurosis and post-traumatic stress disorder (not my own)
and I have deadlines to meet (I have this work where I'm overpaid
considering my abilities, as one of the resident intellectuals put it
when I corrected him on a mistake). So, for obvious reasons,
volunteering to keep the SHWI clean doesn't seem exactly thrilling,
especially since it has become a very thankless task (no offense
intended to those posters who have done great things to keep the group
going; you know who you are, and you've done and you're all still
doing your best; regretfully, it has become a losing battle).

So, my solution is Exodus, movement of Jah People. SHWI has become a
Babylon, a vampire, a falling Empire. Give us the teachings of His
Majesty, for we no want no Devil philosophy. Let's get out while we
can and go somewhere else. Setting up a collective blog would seem
like the right way to go.

This was already discussed just the last month. When and how do we do
it?

Cheers,

J. J.

The &quot;MI5&quot; character is down on the Google archives for 50,000 posts, I
would guess to more than 50 groups, perhaps 100. Posted yesterday
between 7 am British time (MI5 remember?) and 10 pm.  He is not back
today. I would guess the protesters and complaintants were heard by
Google if not MI5 itself. Guess teen age boy with good typing skills
and a pack of hurts. When some one in UK has it in for a religious
broadcaster in Mississippi there are signs of instability.

How to put this.

The person in question hates the idea of public action -- public
exposure, public censure.  He is horrified and angered by the idea of
a &quot;crusade against the ungodly&quot;.  At the same time, he has repeatedly
obsessed about &quot;cyberstalkers&quot; who seek to ferret out others' secrets.

Not much else to add, except that Carlos?  Is a bigger man than I am.

Anyway, go shw-i, at least for a little while longer.
