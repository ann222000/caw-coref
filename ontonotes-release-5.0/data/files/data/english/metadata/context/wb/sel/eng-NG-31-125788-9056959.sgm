Democracy demands electoral reform, says EPMU

The Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union has told
Parliament's justice and electoral select committee that the
principles of the Electoral Finance Bill are sound and the law must
ensure the democratic process is open to all New Zealanders, not just
the wealthy and the privileged.

In his oral submission to the select committee this afternoon, EPMU
national secretary Andrew Little said that while the union has several
issues with the bill in its current form, it strongly supports the
bill's underlying democratic values.
&quot;The EPMU supports a fair and open electoral system where all citizens
have an equal chance to participate in our democracy regardless of
their individual wealth,&quot; he said. &quot;It is therefore entirely fair and
appropriate to place limits on third party spending and to start
counting that spending from January 1st on election year.

&quot;Given this, we would like to see third party spending limits
increased from the proposed $60,000 to a more realistic figure of
$120,000 to allow citizens and interest groups a decent chance to
campaign on their issues.

&quot;It is also our strong preference to see greater transparency of
donations to political parties as well as public funding of election
campaigns to reduce the influence of money on our democracy, even if
this is unlikely to happen before the next election.

&quot;Our position on the Electoral Finance Bill is clear. When we have
economic inequalities in our society that allow the very wealthy to
spend large amounts of money to influence an election then it is
entirely justified and appropriate for Parliament to pass a law to
mitigate that imbalance.

&quot;Subject to refinements, we strongly support this legislation being
passed.&quot;

The EPMU is New Zealand's largest private sector trade union,
representing 50,000 working New Zealanders across eleven industries.

ENDS

I'd be interested to know just how many of those 50,000 were consulted
for their opinions before Mr. Little presumed to speak for them on this
issue.

How is an oral submission to a select committee propaganda? or is
propaganda just things said by people you happen not to agree with?

I suppose at least your utterances aren't propanda since they advance no
arguments of their own. There isn't space amongst the mindless abuse for
one thing.

Simple argument.

promoting, anonymously or otherwise.

Which doesn't exactly support John B's position that union opinions

John B's problem is that he is all invective and assertion and no
argument.

There is no doubt that advertising has influence. Look at the current
elections for local authorities - many of the population (and possibly
the vast majority) have very little knowledge about most candidates,
but will be influenced by those able to get posters and hoardings in
large numbers and in key positions - those candidates with less
resources are less likely to become known.

I do not argue that poor candidates should receive a subsidy, but I do
not think that we should claim one person one vote and then slant the
information received by the public hugely in favour of the rich, or
'friends' of the rich. A cap on expenditure makes a lot of sense, and
now that at least one party has adopted the USA Republican tactic of
extensive use of 'independent' 'third party' bodies to lobby on
specific issues that just 'happen' to promote one particular party, it
is obvious that our rules have to be adjusted for reality. Other
countries have done it, and it does not make sense for us to leave
huge loopholes in our rules and pretend that they will not be walked
through.

Similarly we cannot attack the government (and that's any government,
not just the current one) for supposed 'corruption' and not allow the
government to be able to be transparent about where the money that it
is able to use comes from. For some reason it seems to suit
conservative parties to foster an attitude that there is something
wrong with actually belonging to a political party - but to quietly
and anonymously make huge donations through a &quot;trust&quot; that just
happens to in turn spend its money in accordance with the wishes of
the party. There is nothing that clears the air of charges of
corruption better than the ability to publish facts about who has
financed each political party. What are National trying to hide that
they are fighting this so vehemently?

Of course it does. Unions are communist inspired in general. And
communists, like you, like dictrating to people to
sociall-engineer society. Which in effect means, they want to
dominate and control every single individual on the planet.

And the reality is, the ONLY way they can do that is through the
use of force and violence.

Violating people's rights always has force and viloence at its
base.

I disagree. I think unions are a healthy part of any workforce - they
provide legitimate options for two consenting adults to barter their trade.

I don't think their should be any special legislation governing them
though - it's none of the government business what two consenting adults
agree or disagree on, as long as no one else's rights are impinged.

Not the way a lot are run. Especially the Labour Party oriented
ones.

You must realize that unions usually meant you voted Labour, were
called scab if you didn't etc.

The union was ALL. Individuality was drummed out of everyone that
belonged.

It is also morally corrupt for unions to charge their members and
then use that money to give to the Labour Party for election
spending or whatever. Some members did not support Labour so why
should theyir money go to the Labour Party?

Small in-house union-shops are generally ok, though. I agree with
them.

So you have no problem with unions as a concept, but dislike the way they
are currently run? If so I'd share your opinion.

IMO:

- unions should not be compulsory for anyone

- people who strike on recommendation of their union (or for any other
reason) should be able to get sacked by their employer for not turning up.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Simple argument.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;right to

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bill.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which doesn't exactly support John B's position that union
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opinions

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preferably to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the toilet ...

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Of course it does. Unions are communist inspired in general.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I disagree. I think unions are a healthy part of any
&gt; &gt;&gt; workforce - they
&gt; &gt;&gt; provide legitimate options for two consenting adults to barter
&gt; &gt;&gt; their trade.

&gt; &gt; Not the way a lot are run. Especially the Labour Party oriented
&gt; &gt; ones.

&gt; &gt; You must realize that unions usually meant you voted Labour, were
&gt; &gt; called scab if you didn't etc.

&gt; &gt; The union was ALL. Individuality was drummed out of everyone that
&gt; &gt; belonged.

&gt; &gt; It is also morally corrupt for unions to charge their members and
&gt; &gt; then use that money to give to the Labour Party for election
&gt; &gt; spending or whatever. Some members did not support Labour so why
&gt; &gt; should theyir money go to the Labour Party?

&gt; &gt; Small in-house union-shops are generally ok, though. I agree with
&gt; &gt; them.

&gt; So you have no problem with unions as a concept, but dislike the way they
&gt; are currently run? If so I'd share your opinion.

&gt; IMO:

&gt; - unions should not be compulsory for anyone

&gt; - people who strike on recommendation of their union (or for any other
&gt; reason) should be able to get sacked by their employer for not turning up.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't think their should be any special legislation governing
&gt; &gt;&gt; them
&gt; &gt;&gt; though - it's none of the government business what two
&gt; &gt;&gt; consenting adults
&gt; &gt;&gt; agree or disagree on, as long as no one else's rights are
&gt; &gt;&gt; impinged.

&gt; &gt; You got that right. No meddling middle-men needed.

&gt; As it should be. People able to choose what they do without government
&gt; interference.

The Labour government is a NZ$55Billion in revenues[1].  Compare that
to, say, Telecom, which has NZ$5.7B in revenues[2]: The Labour
governemnt is 10 times the size, so which one is more prone to &quot;big
money&quot; and &quot;corporate corruption&quot;????   When was the last time the
head of Telecom got done for slandering, investigated for fraud, and
was a party to dangerous driving?

Yep. People should be free to form whatever unions they like so
long as they don't force their views, wants, wishes, whims,
desires onto others.

I've belonged to enough of them in my time. Some very very bad
and very communist in natiure. The worst by far being the Truck
Drivers Union.

I have never seen or heard anyone speak with such hate and
loathing of the 'bosses' than Ken Douglass and Bill Anderson.

I wa shocked and ashamed. Douglass, especially, screamed and
yelled, drumming up as much hate and anger towards the bosses,
amongst the members, as he could. This was a union meeting with
the big-wigs being there.

It was here that I came to understand how socialists manipulate
people via their emotions. Did I hear anything rational or that
made any real sense? Nope. It was just a hate-fest deisgned to
drum up member support for the union and the Labour Party.

My father was a union secretary for 13 years. When he died they
had a whip around the workers and collected about $2km, I think.
The new secretary stole that money and spent it on gambling.

My Dad was a moderate man and a bloody good union rep. Everyone
had the utmost repsect for him. That's how I think uniuons should
be... honest, and pro-active in solving real problems that
benefit everyone, rather than the union bosses and the Labour
Party! Not create priblems where none exist and be all about them
vs us. That's destructive bullshit. BTMO and Rich would be one of
those.

Cporrect. What you do is your business and no one else's.

Agree. They are deliberately trying to cause harm to others and
the business. If they can't get what they want, they should move
on and find employment more suitable to their needs.

Some unions are very destructive and seek to cause harm.

Yes. No one needs dictating middle-men parasites bossing them
about in their own personal affairs. And no one has the right to
meddle in anyone else's affairs without being asked to do so.

And no one has the right to dictate what employers will offer as
wages.

What corporate corruption? Can you give examples specific to NZ?

Doubtful. The government is the single biggest destroyer of freedoms and
liberties in this country.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Democracy demands electoral reform, says EPMU

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What real argument do you offer as an alternative John B?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Simple argument.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Let the right of free speech prevail, and that includes the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;right to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;spend one's own money on promoting whatever message one
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;thinks
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;needs
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;promoting, anonymously or otherwise.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bill.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which doesn't exactly support John B's position that union
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opinions
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are progoganda that should be taken somewhere else ...
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preferably to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the toilet ...

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Of course it does. Unions are communist inspired in general.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I disagree. I think unions are a healthy part of any
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; workforce - they
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; provide legitimate options for two consenting adults to barter
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; their trade.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Not the way a lot are run. Especially the Labour Party oriented
&gt; &gt; &gt; ones.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You must realize that unions usually meant you voted Labour, were
&gt; &gt; &gt; called scab if you didn't etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The union was ALL. Individuality was drummed out of everyone that
&gt; &gt; &gt; belonged.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is also morally corrupt for unions to charge their members and
&gt; &gt; &gt; then use that money to give to the Labour Party for election
&gt; &gt; &gt; spending or whatever. Some members did not support Labour so why
&gt; &gt; &gt; should theyir money go to the Labour Party?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Small in-house union-shops are generally ok, though. I agree with
&gt; &gt; &gt; them.

&gt; &gt; So you have no problem with unions as a concept, but dislike the way they
&gt; &gt; are currently run? If so I'd share your opinion.

&gt; &gt; IMO:

&gt; &gt; - unions should not be compulsory for anyone

&gt; &gt; - people who strike on recommendation of their union (or for any other
&gt; &gt; reason) should be able to get sacked by their employer for not turning up.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I don't think their should be any special legislation governing
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; them
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; though - it's none of the government business what two
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; consenting adults
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; agree or disagree on, as long as no one else's rights are

Governments are corporations. Also, NZ government revenue is
controlled by an offshore corporation called the Crown.
