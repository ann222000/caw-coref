My son, 35,  wants to put up some robust shelving in his garage.  We
talked about it and schemed  some last weekend, came up with a plan. I
said I'd be glad to pick up the steel but he wanted the experience of
going to Discount Steel -- and it is definitely an experience.  So he
did -- and he definitely enjoyed the experience.    He   also picked
up  a sixpack of zinc-rich primer rattlecans  at Grainger during the
week.   Today we welded up some  shelf brackets.   The shelves will be
3/4"  good-quality  void-free 7-ply or 9-ply.   The cost difference at
Depot  between cabinet-grade plywood (no hardwood veneer)  and crap is
surprisingly modest.

The uprights are 1 x 2 x 3/16" channel,  the shelf supports 1-1/2 x
1-1/2 x 1/8" angle,  two  12"  shelves per support.

We had a perfect day for cutting steel in the back yard:  nearly 60,
not sunny but not rainy or windy either.  I acted as mentor and gofer.
Kev did all of the measuring, marking and cutting with the portable
bandsaw.   Then he drilled the  5/16"  lagbolt  holes on the
drillpress and learned a coupla things about drilling steel -- drop of
cutting fluid,  brisk initial plunge to get a chip going, then just
enough pressure to keep a curly chip going (smoke is OK long as the
chip is curly),   ease off just a tad right when it breaks thru so it
doesn't grab.   Y'all know the drill, now he does too.

Thence to the weldatorium.   Did that indoors with the doors open
since MIG makes very little smoke or sparks and no slag.    I can move
Mr. Miller out on the apron, but didn't see any reason to do so. Kev
did all of the welding, every bit of it.   He's never welded before.
I offered some verbal suggestions, handed him the autodark and the gun
and invited him to have at it -- which he did with enthusiasm.     We
consulted a coupla times about settings -- let's try adjusting the
wirefeed rate and the voltage, see if we  notice any difference in how
it runs and sounds and looks when the mask goes up. He sure did!
His first welds weren't bad at all, though he did go over a couple of
them again and I did patch one a bit for him.    Had one jigging eau
chitte  so he got to learn how to "unweld" with angle grinder and thin
cutoff wheel -- and saw that his weld was definitely sound.    He
learned how tack welds in some places work better than others in that
they'll  suffer some bending and twisting but they don't stretch for
crap so location counts if adjustment might be desired.    Got so our
"jigging" amounted to me getting a piece oriented to the line and
square, then holding it (with gloves) and shutting my eyes while he
shot a tack.   After about the third one we didn't need the hammer
anymore!     They all came out straight and about blackout square.

All of his welds will unquestionably  hold their loads, and his later
ones were quite respectable in appearance as well.  It's easy for a
beginner to make a cold no-strength weld with MIG and not know it, but
I know what a good weld looks like  whether pretty or otherwise. His
weren't all pretty, but they were all good -- eventually.

No photos because the paint is wet -- and they're not  *that* great
but they're certainly  a hell of a lot better than the best buzzbox
stick welds I made on my first day or my third way back when.

As usual, I learned a thing.   I now see the value of knocking off
mill scale in selected situations.   I've never worried about it with
stick or MIG and never had a problem -- but some of his tacks were
cold until we started turning up the heat for tacks.  Hm!   I  now
think that once one gets a good puddle going the scale  gets blasted
off and mostly floats to the top of the puddle.  Hey, we're not doing
nuclear containment vessels and we don't need to pass Xray!    But a
MIG tack doesn't seem to get enough of a puddle going to do that
unless the heat is one full step higher than it would be for running a
bead without punchthru.

It is unquestionably  best to remove all millscale from all weld
zones, but I don't generally  regard it as worth the bother and I've
never had a weld fail  in service.   However, I  think I will now make
barespots for tack welds with MIG.

Slam the heat to a tack weld. I usually crank up two steps.

Yup. Thats one of the things Toms wire cup wheels are good for. The
gnarly knotted ones. Stick one on an angle grinder and hit her hard.
Burns right through the scale right quick.

Squarewave makes right pretty aluminum welds.....

For four generations in our family, most of the male bonding or "get
togethers" involve a joint project. Sure beats sitting around the tube
together. Of course, fishing together is in a whole 'nuther league.

You're lucky, you can still show your son a thing or two. "The Kid" is a FAR
better welder - machinist - fabricator than I.

How does the squarewave work (compared to straight AC) on thin stuff?
I have no complaints at all TIG'n ally thick enough for current &gt; 60
amps  but have often wondered  if squarewave would provide a more
stable arc at currents below 40 amps or so -- enough improvement to
bother making a little add-on squarewaver box for currents of say 75
amps and below.    I have a theoretical answer to that question, but
I'm interested in hands-on mask-down experienced observations with
squarewave at low currents.

'Tis indeed.  I recall one June evening when I was wormin' some
submerged stumps on little lake X about 40 miles from town  and
catchin' nice bass fairly regularly when I noted a boat launch at
yonder ramp,  head right toward me and just keep comin' till I thought
it'd run over me.  "What a flaming jerk", I thought.  The boat came to
a stop about a boatlength away, the driver flipped his bowmount
foot-controlled  electric motor in, shot me a big scativorous grin and
said,  "Hi, Dad!"

I softly said  "6-inch motoroil power worm."  Man, we caught and
released a buncha decent bass that evening!  Guys in a boat about 20
yards away couldn't believe we were throwing back all those fish.  We
said "dang bass keep taking our lures so we can't catch any freakin'
walleye! (in 6 feet of water)

You learned a lot of things there by merely doing and observing.

One thing ........ you mentioned moving the welder to the apron ..........
You need to know that MIG is VERY susceptible to the wind, even a slight
breeze.  Welding outside needs to be done in dead calm conditions.
Otherwise, do it in the still air of a garage or other enclosure.  Wind
messes up welds far worse than mill scale.

As always, BEFOREHAND, get your spray hose or fire extinguisher handy.
Sprayhoses are not great for electrical stuff, but if it's what you got,
it's far better to have it there and at the ready than in the back yard
unhooked and strung and tangled all over the place.  Do a good lookaround
for flammables such as paper, cause those little molten BBs can travel a
long ways and stay hot.

Nice story.

I once worked at a stainless steel fab shop.  Most of the welding was on
small stuff on a table, and me sitting on a stool.  My neck vee got FRIED
the first couple of days.  Then I took a piece of leather and laced it to
the bottom of my hood, and that fixed that.  Soft thin leather.  OSHA and

We'll see today.   His forearms might be a bit pink.  He'll love it.
Girlfriend:  "Kev, how did you get a sunburn?"  "Aw, just doin' a
little welding."  (Her dad is a welder...)

MIG welding is like shooting:   everyone (of either gender)  I've

I always tack with a higher setting then for welding. Short time to get the
energy there, so higher voltage.

I once regretted underbuilding a shelf system many years ago, have
never since regretted overbuilding them a little.

&gt; news:5n2c03dcdf6vvlnpae3qo736shbria7098@4ax.com ...
&gt;&gt; My son, 35,  wants to put up some robust shelving in his garage.  We
&gt;&gt; talked about it and schemed  some last weekend, came up with a plan. I
&gt;&gt; said I'd be glad to pick up the steel but he wanted the experience of
&gt;&gt; going to Discount Steel -- and it is definitely an experience.  So he
&gt;&gt; did -- and he definitely enjoyed the experience.    He   also picked
&gt;&gt; up  a sixpack of zinc-rich primer rattlecans  at Grainger during the
&gt;&gt; week.   Today we welded up some  shelf brackets.   The shelves will be
&gt;&gt; 3/4&quot;  good-quality  void-free 7-ply or 9-ply.   The cost difference at
&gt;&gt; Depot  between cabinet-grade plywood (no hardwood veneer)  and crap is
&gt;&gt; surprisingly modest.

&gt;&gt; The uprights are 1 x 2 x 3/16&quot; channel,  the shelf supports 1-1/2 x
&gt;&gt; 1-1/2 x 1/8&quot; angle,  two  12&quot;  shelves per support.

&gt;&gt; We had a perfect day for cutting steel in the back yard:  nearly 60,
&gt;&gt; not sunny but not rainy or windy either.  I acted as mentor and gofer.
&gt;&gt; Kev did all of the measuring, marking and cutting with the portable
&gt;&gt; bandsaw.   Then he drilled the  5/16&quot;  lagbolt  holes on the
&gt;&gt; drillpress and learned a coupla things about drilling steel -- drop of
&gt;&gt; cutting fluid,  brisk initial plunge to get a chip going, then just
&gt;&gt; enough pressure to keep a curly chip going (smoke is OK long as the
&gt;&gt; chip is curly),   ease off just a tad right when it breaks thru so it
&gt;&gt; doesn't grab.   Y'all know the drill, now he does too.

&gt;&gt; Thence to the weldatorium.   Did that indoors with the doors open
&gt;&gt; since MIG makes very little smoke or sparks and no slag.    I can move
&gt;&gt; Mr. Miller out on the apron, but didn't see any reason to do so. Kev
&gt;&gt; did all of the welding, every bit of it.   He's never welded before.
&gt;&gt; I offered some verbal suggestions, handed him the autodark and the gun
&gt;&gt; and invited him to have at it -- which he did with enthusiasm.     We
&gt;&gt; consulted a coupla times about settings -- let's try adjusting the
&gt;&gt; wirefeed rate and the voltage, see if we  notice any difference in how
&gt;&gt; it runs and sounds and looks when the mask goes up. He sure did!
&gt;&gt; His first welds weren't bad at all, though he did go over a couple of
&gt;&gt; them again and I did patch one a bit for him.    Had one jigging eau
&gt;&gt; chitte  so he got to learn how to &quot;unweld&quot; with angle grinder and thin
&gt;&gt; cutoff wheel -- and saw that his weld was definitely sound.    He
&gt;&gt; learned how tack welds in some places work better than others in that
&gt;&gt; they'll  suffer some bending and twisting but they don't stretch for
&gt;&gt; crap so location counts if adjustment might be desired.    Got so our
&gt;&gt; &quot;jigging&quot; amounted to me getting a piece oriented to the line and
&gt;&gt; square, then holding it (with gloves) and shutting my eyes while he
&gt;&gt; shot a tack.   After about the third one we didn't need the hammer
&gt;&gt; anymore!     They all came out straight and about blackout square.

&gt;&gt; All of his welds will unquestionably  hold their loads, and his later
&gt;&gt; ones were quite respectable in appearance as well.  It's easy for a
&gt;&gt; beginner to make a cold no-strength weld with MIG and not know it, but
&gt;&gt; I know what a good weld looks like  whether pretty or otherwise. His
&gt;&gt; weren't all pretty, but they were all good -- eventually.

&gt;&gt; No photos because the paint is wet -- and they're not  *that* great
&gt;&gt; but they're certainly  a hell of a lot better than the best buzzbox
&gt;&gt; stick welds I made on my first day or my third way back when.

&gt;&gt; As usual, I learned a thing.   I now see the value of knocking off
&gt;&gt; mill scale in selected situations.   I've never worried about it with
&gt;&gt; stick or MIG and never had a problem -- but some of his tacks were
&gt;&gt; cold until we started turning up the heat for tacks.  Hm!   I  now
&gt;&gt; think that once one gets a good puddle going the scale  gets blasted
&gt;&gt; off and mostly floats to the top of the puddle.  Hey, we're not doing
&gt;&gt; nuclear containment vessels and we don't need to pass Xray!    But a
&gt;&gt; MIG tack doesn't seem to get enough of a puddle going to do that
&gt;&gt; unless the heat is one full step higher than it would be for running a
&gt;&gt; bead without punchthru.

&gt;&gt; It is unquestionably  best to remove all millscale from all weld
&gt;&gt; zones, but I don't generally  regard it as worth the bother and I've
&gt;&gt; never had a weld fail  in service.   However, I  think I will now make
&gt;&gt; barespots for tack welds with MIG.

&gt;You learned a lot of things there by merely doing and observing.

&gt;One thing ........ you mentioned moving the welder to the apron ..........
&gt;You need to know that MIG is VERY susceptible to the wind, even a slight
&gt;breeze.  Welding outside needs to be done in dead calm conditions.
&gt;Otherwise, do it in the still air of a garage or other enclosure.  Wind
&gt;messes up welds far worse than mill scale.

&gt;As always, BEFOREHAND, get your spray hose or fire extinguisher handy.
&gt;Sprayhoses are not great for electrical stuff, but if it's what you got,
&gt;it's far better to have it there and at the ready than in the back yard
&gt;unhooked and strung and tangled all over the place.  Do a good lookaround
&gt;for flammables such as paper, cause those little molten BBs can travel a
&gt;long ways and stay hot.

&gt;Nice story.

&gt;Steve

Thanks! If we'd gone outside to weld we'd have used fluxcore. MIG is
nicer, but some jobs are too big to bring inside, e.g. trailers.   I
do have three ABC fire extinguishers in my shop, and they're all
inspected regularly.

&gt;&gt;Slam the heat to a tack weld. I usually crank up two steps.

&gt;&gt;Yup. Thats one of the things Toms wire cup wheels are good for. The
&gt;&gt;gnarly knotted ones. Stick one on an angle grinder and hit her hard.
&gt;&gt;Burns right through the scale right quick.

&gt;&gt;Gunner, who just got the new (old) Airco/Esab Heliwelder V (square wave)
&gt;&gt;running on Tig tonight. Had to modify an old Hobart pedal and put in new
&gt;&gt;switch and pot and cabling..but she purrs..she purrs.....310 amps AC
&gt;&gt;Squarewave makes right pretty aluminum welds.....

&gt;How does the squarewave work (compared to straight AC) on thin stuff?
&gt;I have no complaints at all TIG'n ally thick enough for current &gt; 60
&gt;amps  but have often wondered  if squarewave would provide a more
&gt;stable arc at currents below 40 amps or so -- enough improvement to
&gt;bother making a little add-on squarewaver box for currents of say 75
&gt;amps and below.    I have a theoretical answer to that question, but
&gt;I'm interested in hands-on mask-down experienced observations with
&gt;squarewave at low currents.
">

My big Airco 300 (digital readouts etc etc) , has all the square wave
knobs and gizmos and thingajiggys and I managed to weld a couple Pepsi
cans together at the base not long ago, and could only do so using
square wave (with a .02 electrode and tiny aluminum wire) at about 5-15
amps.

You can dial it down and in for doing really really thin stuff. Im still
learning how to use the big bitch.

This smaller welder has none of the options except post purge time. The
silkscreening is there for the other options..but none of the boards are
there nor are the shaft holes punched out.

However I did try it with some AC rod sometime back at the suggestion of
a poster and it welded marvelously, like welding DC, with none of the
arc blow. Ill play with this beasty this weekend and see what it can do.

Im NOT a welder, nor do I play one on TV..but I manage to stick things
together well enough. Sometimes even pretty.

I dont have picturs of it yet...but its my third tig...cringe.

This one..I repaired and loaned to a friend of mine after building a
stand for it

That's what I wanted to know, thanks!   It might be worth the bother
to cook up an addon  squarewave box for work below 75 amps with my
DialArc 250HF.  It works fine at low current in DC mode but arc
stability is poor below about 40 amps on AC -- which isn't surprising.

That's a good thing.  Most discover what kind of fire extinguishers they
have, and if they're within inspection after the FD leaves.

I like a factor of 3.  This allows for almost any situation, and if you can
overload a system built with 3x fabrication, it was going to fall anyway.

And most times, the difference between 1.25 overbuild and 3.00 is very
little in time or materials.  Sometimes, just plain geometry and common
sense.  If not that, then just a little thicker metal.
