A New Push for Change in the War on Terror
By Alexandra Marks
The Christian Science Monitor

Wednesday 22 August 2007

In Foreign Policy magazine's Terrorism Index, experts paint a bleak
picture of progress and point to diminishing security for the US.

New York - The US is losing the war on terror. That's the
assessment of the nation's top foreign-policy, intelligence, and
national-security leaders from across the ideological spectrum. In
this year's Terrorism Index, a survey released Monday by Foreign
Policy magazine, 84 percent of these experts believe the nation is
losing the war on terror, while more than 90 percent say the world is
growing more dangerous for Americans.

That's prompted a variety of leaders to call for a complete
rethinking of the nation's strategy. And some are looking back to the
cold war's battle against communism to find models for the ideological
struggle against terrorism.

A key component is deterrence, the policy that, at the height of
the cold war, kept the superpowers' nuclear warheads safely in their
bunkers - the only way to avoid mutually assured destruction (MAD).
Another is a call for a Middle East Marshall Plan to help develop the
region's economies and confront the alienation of the young.

&quot;We need a grand strategy to address not only the question of al
Qaeda, but also, how do you put out the fires in the region?&quot; says
Fawaz Gerges, a Middle East expert at New York's Sarah Lawrence
College. &quot;How do you diffuse the crisis and help the Muslims in order
to counterbalance the militant ideologies that are simmering above the
surface and below the surface?&quot;

The Terrorism Index was developed by Foreign Policy magazine and
the Center for American Progress a year ago, as a way to gauge
progress in the war on terror. The original idea was to determine
whether the nation was deterring, capturing, or killing more
terrorists each day than were being recruited, trained, and deployed.
Such information proved nearly impossible to obtain. So the groups
decided to survey top foreign-policy, intelligence, military, and
academic experts on their sense of progress.

This is the third Terrorism Index they have issued. Among its
findings are that foreign-policy experts &quot;see a world that is growing
more dangerous, a national security strategy in disrepair, and a war
in Iraq that is alarmingly off course,&quot; according to the magazine.

&quot;The main reason for this pessimism appears to be events on the
ground,&quot; says Mike Boyer, senior editor of Foreign Policy. &quot;Eighty-
three percent of the experts say the surge of troops into Baghdad is
having a negative impact on the war effort, an increase of 22 percent
from just six months ago.&quot; The sentiment crosses party lines, he says.
So, too, does a desire to disengage from Iraq. Seven out of 10 experts
surveyed believe it's time to draw down forces there, although a
majority do not favor an immediate withdrawal.

Experts are also blaming the war in Iraq for a diminishing sense
of security in America. Eighty percent of them say the war has had a
negative effect &quot;on protecting the American people from global
terrorist networks and in advancing U.S. national security goals.&quot;
Only 15 percent of the experts say that creating a stable, secure Iraq
should be the top foreign-policy objective of the next five years. In
contrast, 30 percent believe that winning the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of
the Muslim world should be the most important US policy objective in
that time frame.

These and other conclusions, says Mr. Boyer, indicate that the
Iraq experience is informing experts' broader views on the war on
terrorism - and prompting calls for new strategies.

&quot;This poll presents an enormously bleak and melancholy picture ...
and it's difficult not to read it as a complete repudiation of the
entire current conduct on the war on terrorism,&quot; says Bruce Hoffman, a
terrorism expert at Georgetown University. &quot;Where we have been
particularly remiss or ineffectual is in fighting the al Qaeda brand
as hard as we've fought the al Qaeda terrorists.&quot;

Middle East experts like Dr. Gerges say that while the majority of
Muslims reject al Qaeda's violence, they have come to believe that
much of al Qaeda's rhetoric is correct. &quot;The US is losing the
ideological struggle against al Qaeda,&quot; says Gerges. &quot;Some of the most
intelligent people in that part of the world believe the US is waging
a crusade against Islam and Muslims and is trying to subjugate the
Arab world and remake it in its image, and that it's doing it
brutally.&quot;

Many experts say it's critical that the US focus on countering
such perceptions. The solution lies in changing US policy in the
region and supporting Islamic scholars who can show how al Qaeda is
distorting the Koran.

&quot;Once you strip the adversary of their extremist message of
religion, there's nothing left but criminality and thuggery,&quot; says
Frank Cilluffo, director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at
George Washington University. &quot;There's growing recognition this needs
to be done, but we haven't marshaled and mobilized those resources as
much as we ought to.&quot; Some scholars believe a comprehensive strategy
should include a massive economic and social investment similar to the
Marshall Plan after World War II. They also think it's crucial to
develop a strategy of deterrence.

&quot;Deterrence is probably the hardest part of counterterrorism,&quot;
says John McLaughlin, former acting director of the CIA. &quot;Classical
deterrence in the past worked against adversaries who played by
certain rules and didn't want to die. Here, you're up against an
adversary who plays by no particular rules and is willing to die.&quot;

It's equally important to combat the terrorist narrative, he says.
Others agree and again point to the findings of the Terrorism Index.

&quot;Part of the results ... is a warning that we must change our
strategy, or otherwise we'll be ... fighting this struggle ad
infinitum,&quot; says Hoffman.
