______________________________________________________

I don't want to quarrel with Veal because I think
his website is brilliant--Veal's brilliant--but Veal
posted proof that Strats are authoritarian so it has
to be put on the table. Veal wrote:

&quot;In his introduction to Milward W. Martin's Was Shakespeare
Shakespeare? (1965), Louis Marder, founder of the Shakespeare
Newsletter, wrote,

'A book on Shakespeare that would completely silence the
skeptics who deny the Stratford man's authorship is an
impossibility. The skeptics simply refuse to see, and
those who refuse to see always continue to be blind.'&quot;

Authoritarians, by definition, fear and loathe skepticism
(authoritarian from 'auctoritas' or authority) but I find
it especially ironic that Strats would entertain the idea of
'completely silencing' skeptics since the author himself
was a skeptic:

Shakespeare's Skepticism Redefined
Manfred Weidhorn

&quot;Critics have been busy tracing Shakespeare's apparent skepticism in
individual plays and groups of plays. Skepticism, however, pervades the
entire canon, in the sense that various plays are in antithetical
relationships with each other, often as comic and tragic versions of
the same themes (Richard III and The Taming of the Shrew, Romeo and
Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream, King Lear and As You Like It,
Othello and Much Ado About Nothing, Antony and Cleopatra and Troilus
and Cressida). Such pairings suggest an unwillingness to be pinned down
to any one reading of reality.&quot; (author's abstract from Ingenta).

Or perhaps the Strat Revisionist Bard isn't a skeptic.

Cordially,

So anyone who believes some skeptics are wrong to be skeptical is
authoritarian, Elizabeth? If I think those skeptical of the
fundamental validity of Darwinianism are wrong to be skeptical of it,
I'm an authoritarian?

&quot;Completely silencing&quot; people by writing a book that convinces them
that they are wrong isn't even vaguely like completely silencing them
by sending them to the Gulag Archipelago. Louis Marder was complaining
that anti-Stratfordians would not heed rational argument; he did not
propose any authoritarian measures to suppress their folly.

Geez, Bob, if you're not constantly skeptical of
Darwinism you're a Darwinian ideologue. All scientific
theories are theoretically open to revision.

If Darwin's theory is scientific, the evolutionists'
red carpet ought to be rolled out for skeptics. I'm
skeptical of Darwin's teleological 'eschatology,' that
evolution always makes forward progress.

I don't dispute the second law of thermodynamics
but I am S K E P T I C A L of the first part:

&quot;Believing as I do that man in the distant future will
be a far more perfect creature than he now is, it is an
intolerable thought that he and all other sentient beings
are doomed to complete annihilation after such long-continued
slow progress.&quot;

That's not the point, Tom. Empirical evidence is by
definition (from L. video, to see) necessarily tentitive.
Documents and witnesses can always be superceded by later
discoveries of documents and new witnesses that are more
probative.

A book by McCrea, Marder or any Strat will never resolve
the authorship question because it's not the kind of
question that can be resolved by an argument. It requires
more and better tangible evidence in the form of 16th and
17th century manuscripts to support the Strat claim .

Skeptics are not blind, they're analysing
the evidence and finding that it falls short of the
Strat claim.

Unlike the Oxfordians who have no evidence of authorship,
Strats do have real evidence, primarily the printed title
pages, but those title pages have . . . no witnesses.

That's your problem.

Even were it true that Stratfordians overestimated the cogency of their
position and the strength of their evidence, that mistake would not
warrant the loaded label &quot;authoritarian&quot;. There are many, many
assertions that cannot be proven to a metaphysical certainty yet cannot
be reasonably denied.

The only reason why the authorship question cannot &quot;be resolved by an
argument&quot; is that anti-Stratfordians cling to their position without
regard to its feeble foundation. Mr. McCrea labors to demonstrate that,
but he of course cannot enlighten people who wear their blindfolds with
pride.

Re. the following:

regard to its feeble foundation.

Comment:

I beg to differ.

An argument against the Stratfordian that would completely silence his
groupies who deny the feeble foundations for his claimed authorship is
an impossibility. The groupies simply refuse to see, and those who
refuse to see always continue to be blind.

P.S. What's the singular Latin noun for &quot;groupies&quot;?

skeptic: OED2: 2. One who doubts the validity of what claims to be

attitude with reference to some particular question or statement.

revision.

And where exactly does Darwin make this claim? How much of Darwin have you

Offhand, &quot;grex&quot; is as close as I can come to the meaning that you are
trying to convey.

BTW, ignorance of Latin is no disgrace in this day and age, though
knowingly perpetuating a mistranslation is no feather in one's cap.

Aside from just now (responding to your specific request for a word), I
have &quot;strutted my Latin stuff&quot; (quite rusty, alas) only once in this
forum: when you posted a mistranslation that was identified as such by
the source from which you took it. And that didn't require any
knowledge of Latin; competence in English was enough to catch the
blunder.

Darwin is saying that it's a shame that the Second Law

I've read Voyage of the Beagle--I recommend it--

read some Thomas Huxley. I've read Spedding kicking

Thank you, Peter; good job. My hunch is that the quote above, if accurate,
is either 1) out of context, and that it doesn't refer to physical
perfectability, or 2) it may be a very early quote. I can't imagine Darwin
making such a statement after the publication of &quot;The Origin&quot;, at least not
about biological processes. Frankly, it sounds like one of those things
Creationists dredge up in their attempts to discredit Evolution.

The Darwin quotation is from his Autobiography (1876 - post &quot;Origin&quot;) in a
discussion of his (dis)belief of God. It seems to me to refer to moral
perfectability, and follows a brief passage mentioning the non-progressive
version of &quot;descent with modification&quot;.

Only once?

Make that twice - first time over Greenblatt's 'Will in the World'.

By your lights that calls into question your intellectual integrity
and/or command of arithmetic.

In both cases, the offending Latin was in quotation marks.

Do you post 'amended' quotes on your website?

Let's calculate the Gunnar sums of Gunnar's latest post:

4064 = Only once?

31202 = Make that twice - first time over Greenblatt's 'Will in the
World'.

33761 = By your lights that calls into question your intellectual
integrity

11538 = and/or command of arithmetic.

25797 = In both cases, the offending Latin was in quotation marks.

21395 = Do you post 'amended' quotes on your website?

The grand total is 127757:

4064+31202+33761+11538+25797+21395 = 127757

Remarkably enough, the identical total of 127757 belongs to the following
&quot;hidden message&quot;:

Gunnar's unacclaimed methods, worthless as they are,
might still be entertaining if their author presented his
opinions with style or with wit or with a modicum of modesty,
or if prizes were included in every box -- or if there were
ANY redeeming aspect to them.
-- No such luck.

Here are the sums:

23783 = Gunnar's unacclaimed methods, worthless as they are,
26048 = might still be entertaining if their author presented his
33646 = opinions with style or with wit or with a modicum of modesty,
26468 = or if prizes were included in every box -- or if there were
11562 = ANY redeeming aspect to them.
6250 = -- No such luck.

23783+26048+33646+26468+11562+6250 = 127757
4064+31202+33761+11538+25797+21395 = 127757

Thus,

4064+31202+33761+11538+25797+21395 = 23783+26048+33646+26468+11562+6250

Gunnar may proclaim his own &quot;command of arithmetic,&quot; but the figures tell
a different story. He does not command arithmetic: arithmetic commands
him.

Will he obey?

Let's see what hidden shallows we can find in this post by Gunnar. First
we must count the cipher values of his original post, and then we must
look at the cipher value equivalent.

3218 = Terry.

9284 = That's impressive!

25040 = Come September and my 2 1/2 year old grand-daughter is set to
enter a

35428 = Montessori pre-school, where she will learn the wonders of
arithmetic,

20228 = where not only does 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 add up to 10, but so does any

12700 = alternative arrangement of 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Here is the grand total:

3218+9284+25040+35428+20228+12700 = 105898

By a coincidence so extraordinary that the odds-makers at Pimlico have
walked off their jobs in protest, the VERY SAME GEMATRIC SUM can be found
for this hidden message:

Come July, come September, comes nothing new
under the gematric summer's summer sun.
Come rain or come shine (as Johnny Mercer might say),
Gunnar will add his sums together in the vain hope
that therein immortalizing meaning lies a-waiting.

Here are the sums:

20043 = Come July, come September, comes nothing new
19371 = under the gematric summer's summer sun.
20688 = Come rain or come shine (as Johnny Mercer might say),
23108 = Gunnar will add his sums together in the vain hope
22688 = that therein immortalizing meaning lies a-waiting.

20043+19371+20688+23108+22688 = 105898 = 3218+9284+25040+35428+20228+12700

The idea of numerology being an integral aspect of the Shakespeare Opus
is anathema to Stratfordian Orthodoxy for a very good reason:

Admit it - and Stratfordian Orthodoxy is destined for the dustbin of
history.

The view of Shakespeare's contemporaries on the subject matter is
reflected in the opening lines of a 2003 paper by Marlovian Peter Bull,
which I came across on the Internet a few days ago:

&quot;One of the most striking differences between the Renaissance worldview
and that of the present day lies in a shift from a richly subjective to
a purely objective conceptualisation of numbers and mathematics. In
the Renaissance numbers were held in a regard so high they were
believed to provide the secret key to the deepest mysteries of God and
man. Pico della Mirandola spoke for his age when he wrote (in John
Dee's inimitable translation):

&quot;By numbers, a way is had, to the searchyng out, and understandyng of
every thyng, hable to be knowen.&quot;

Examples of similar numerical enthusiasm could be cited from a great
many of the leading figures of the Renaissance. It is scarcely
surprising therefore that the writers of that age took numerical
symbolism extremely seriously too.

The profound role of numerology in the literature of the period has
been appreciated for many years now. Prominent among those who have
initiated this revelation is Professor Alastair Fowler, and he has
described the scope of the movement thus:

&quot;Numerology ... was widely used by Latin authors, common to the best
medieval and renaissance poets and almost universal in the period 1580
to 1680, when it reached its greatest heights of sophistication.&quot;

The work of Fowler and others has revealed that subtle but complex
numerical patterns are to be found in the major works of Marlowe's
immediate peers, including Sidney, Spenser, Chapman and Shakespeare.
It is a fact, however, that this body of numerical criticism has
focussed almost exclusively on poetry and has all but ignored the prime
technique of literary numerology, which is the interplay of words,
names and numbers found in the Cabala.

There are several possible reasons for this, but key among them must be
the fact that Literary Cabala has always been a matter steeped in
secrecy. This reflects the fact that Cabala is a technique originally
devised as a means of transmitting, yet at the same time concealing,
the most sacred and portentous mysteries of the ancient world. This
perennial aura of secrecy has ensured the Cabala's status as something
of a lost art; however it is one that was temporarily rediscovered and
very highly regarded by those, like Pico and Dee, at the cutting edge
of the Renaissance.&quot; ('Marlowe and the Cabala - A Cabalistic and
Numerological Subtext to Tamburlaine')

For the past three decades, I have researched the &quot;interplay of words,
names and numbers&quot; in the Saga literature of 13th century Iceland and
the Shakespeare works of Elizabethan and Jacobean England - on the
basis thereof, I am persuaded, for example, that there is more than
meets the eye to &quot;Cosen Bacon&quot;, 4669, and &quot;Seriant Harris&quot;, 7347, to
whom Edward Oxenford wished to &quot;passe&quot; his &quot;Booke from her Magestie&quot;.

&quot;Cosen Bacon&quot; is the sole extant reference by the Earl of Oxford to
Francis Bacon and, by chance or otherwise, Cosen Bacon's Cipher Value
is mirrored in that of Kabbala Denudata, 4669, or 'The Kabbala
Revealed'.

As for the Cipher Value of &quot;Seriant Harris&quot; (viewed by modern scholars
as a variation on &quot;Sergeant Harris&quot;), it is mirrored in the Cipher Sum
1000 - 4000 + 10347 = 7347, thereby &quot;identifying&quot; this otherwise
unknown character as Mythical Brownswerd, - 4000, alias &quot;mortal coil&quot;
for Light of the World, 1000, viewed as Spatio-temporal manifestation
of Our Ever-living Poet, 10347, of the Dedication of Shakespeare's
Sonnets.

Kabbala Denudata, 4669, is the title of a work published in the second
half of the 17th century, whose title page depicted a young lady
running towards 'Palatium Arcanorum', 9129, with keys to the Old and
New Testaments dangling from her arm.

Who's the young lady?

A possible answer was placed on record in W. J. Craig's 1895 edition of
'The Complete Works of William Shakepspeare' through the introduction
of &quot;Ophelia Daughter to Polonius,&quot; 13798 as in 4669 + 1929 = 13798.

Terry.

You're something else!

So, just between the two of us, something puzzles me.

A little bird tells me

(a) that Prospero, 5452, is Shakespeare's 'disguise' for Jesus Christ,
7284, to be removed at The End, 100; and

(b) that the truth of the matter is somehow related to the Alpha and
Omega passages of two of Francis Bacon's works - his essay 'Of Truth' -

Alpha:
What is Truth, said jesting Pilate; and would not stay for an Answer,
33294.

Omega:
Surely the Wickednesse of Falshood, and Breach of Faith, cannot
possibly be so highly expressed, as in that it shall be the last Peale,
to call the Iudgements of God, vpon the Generations of Men, It being
foretold, that when Christ commeth, He shall not finde faith vpon the
earth, 114285.

- and The Beginning and The End of the educationial enterprise which
the Father of Salomon's House undertakes in 'The New Atlantis' -

Alpha:
&quot;God bless thee, my son; I will give thee the greatest jewel I have.
For I will impart unto thee, for the love of God and men, a relation of
the true state of Salomon's House,&quot; 72819.

Omega:
&quot;God bless thee, my son, and God bless this relation which I have made.
I give thee leave to publish it, for the good of other nations*; for
we here** are in God's bosom, a land unknown***,&quot; 72828.

* Yahoos to Swift; Stratfordians to yours truly.
** Swift's Houyhnhnmland.
*** To Yahoos/&quot;second-best bed&quot; Stratfordians.

Alas, my old brain is troubled (I turned 65 yesterday), and no matter
how often I do the math, I get

33294 + 5452 - 7284 + 114285 = 145747

in one case and

72819 + 72828 + 100 = 145747

in the other.

Here's what's puzzling me:

IF, as you assure us,

(a) Francis Bacon had nothing to do with the Shakespeare Opus, and

(b) Gematria is for the birds,

THEN what infernal powers may have conspired to make it appear that
you're all wet - and that the Stratfordian Apple-Cart is blown to
smithereens?

Hi Chaps,

From time to time I lurk in this group. Now that you guys have a
discussion on Darwinianism going, I just cannot resist chiming in. But
let me start with Einstein.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Elizabeth wrote:

&gt; Einstein's opening verse of the STR paper is 'Let there be c.'

"/>

I am not sure what STR means, but maybe this is refering to Einstein's
two original papers on Special Relativity. I have to admit that it is
over two decades since I read them, but I don't recall that verse, and
its style seems too grandiose for Einstein. However - in Einstein's
time there was strong experimental evidence that the velocity of light
in a vaccum was a universal constant - this was highly unintuitive, and
was one of the big mysteries of the age. (More than that, Mawell's
Equations, which describe the interaction between electricity and
magnetism, and ultimately light, were inconsistant with the prevailing
view of how time and space interact.)

Einstein brilliantly took the &quot;what if&quot; approach, starting with the
assumption that the velocity of light in a vacuum was indeed a universal
constant, plus assumptions of relativity (that the laws of the universe
should independent of the &quot;frame of reference&quot;), and in a tour de force
of reasoning came up with various interesting and counter-intuitive
conclusions.

His work was definitely theory, and it was presented as such. But since
then experimental evidence has again and again supported his theories.
Indeed one of his conclusions (a part of his later general relativity)
was that light going past the sun should be bent by the sun's gravity -
but more than that - by an amount almost exactly double what the
Newtonian type theories might predict. This was observed experimentally
during an eclipse between the wars. It was at this point that
scientists began to accept that Einstein's ideas were more than theory.
But even if Einstein had turned out to be completely wrong, there can
be no doubt that his reasoning was thoroughly brilliant.

Now to Darwin's Theories. I must admit to being an amateur in this
area. I have recently tried hard to find out what the current level of
scientific evidence is. I have to say that I have found it very hard to
get really good answers. My personal opinion is that the current
scientific evidence is inconclusive. although it perhaps leans more
towards &quot;neo-Darwinianism,&quot; but definitely not enough so that religious
people should feel threatened.

My sense of the ideas of the creationists, and more recently, the
intelligent design (I.D.) advocates, is that they have proved a lot less
than they think they have. For example, the I.D. people have this
notion of &quot;information&quot; or &quot;complexity&quot; theory, which I think is very
under-developed. Certainly the common assertion that Darwinian
evolution contradicts the second law of thermodynamics is pure hogwash,
and anyone who wishes to be taken seriously in the scientific community
should avoid this argument.

Anti-Darwinianists should also avoid quoting Darwin himself - the theory
they should be trying to contradict is neo-Darwinianism, which is
definitely more developed than Darwin's ideas. To quote Darwin and
point out the flaws in his personal arguments is, in my opinion, dishonest.

On the other hand, I feel that the neo-Darwinianists have failed to
provide a good mechanism to explain how one gets different species.
They do have various plausability arguments, but that is all that they
seem to have. My impression of the fossil evidence is that it is rather
sketchy, with quite a few holes, and is somewhat inconclusive. I do
think that the fossil and rock evidence speaks against a literal
interpretation of the Genesis account (although personally I would not
consider it totally impossible that God simply &quot;planted&quot; the evidence to
get people off track). From a theological point of view, I tend to
think that the first few chapters of Genesis are not meant to be
understood completely literally, although I do view them as incompatible
with current neo-Darwinianist ideas, even if understood from a
non-literal point of view.

My position is that I give the word of God higher priority than the
scientific method in establishing truth. I do see the Bible and current
ideas of neo-Darwinianism as incompatible. However, if the scientific
evidence for neo-Darwinianism were as strong as, say, our belief in the
theory of atoms, it would constitute a serious attack on my faith, and I
would have to rethink a lot of things.

Best, Stephen

&gt; They do have various plausability arguments, but that is all that they
&gt; seem to have. My impression of the fossil evidence is that it is rather
&gt; sketchy, with quite a few holes, and is somewhat inconclusive. I do
&gt; think that the fossil and rock evidence speaks against a literal
&gt; interpretation of the Genesis account (although personally I would not
&gt; consider it totally impossible that God simply &quot;planted&quot; the evidence to
&gt; get people off track). From a theological point of view, I tend to
&gt; think that the first few chapters of Genesis are not meant to be
&gt; understood completely literally, although I do view them as incompatible
&gt; with current neo-Darwinianist ideas, even if understood from a
&gt; non-literal point of view.

&gt; My position is that I give the word of God higher priority than the
&gt; scientific method in establishing truth. I do see the Bible and current
&gt; ideas of neo-Darwinianism as incompatible. However, if the scientific
&gt; evidence for neo-Darwinianism were as strong as, say, our belief in the
&gt; theory of atoms, it would constitute a serious attack on my faith, and I
&gt; would have to rethink a lot of things.

It may not have been clear in your newsreader, but this was my first
response to your posting. I then did some searching, discovered the source
of the quote, and posted that source - i.e., I didn't know this quote was
from the Autobiography when I posted this remark. Sorry if that led to any
confusion.

In any case, you (not Darwin) quoted it out of context.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; and that it doesn't refer to physical
&gt;&gt; perfectability,

&gt; Hello. That's my complaint.

"/>

Sorry, I'm not following you here. You were clearly, I thought, linking the
quote on Darwin's opinion of perfectability to his theory of evolution:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; If Darwin's theory is scientific, the evolutionists'
&gt;&gt; red carpet ought to be rolled out for skeptics. I'm
&gt;&gt; skeptical of Darwin's teleological 'eschatology,' that
&gt;&gt; evolution always makes forward progress.

"/>

Followed by the quote.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&quot;Believing as I do that man in the distant future will
&gt;&gt; be a far more perfect creature than he now is, it is an
&gt;&gt; intolerable thought that he and all other sentient beings
&gt;&gt; are doomed to complete annihilation after such long-continued
&gt;&gt; slow progress.&quot;

"/>

But the quote's context suggests that Darwin was not referring to evolution,
and I think Peter and I were right to point out that Darwin was unlikely to
have made such a statement on that topic, at least in his mature writings.
If I understand the word &quot;teleology&quot; correctly (and I'm not sure I do), it
is completely inappropriate to apply it to Darwin's evolutionary theory.

Teleology: &quot;The philosophical study of manifestations of design or purpose
in natural processes or occurences ...&quot;

This is antithetical to Darwin's work on evolution, at least in its final
form. If I recall correctly, Darwin played around with concepts of progress
in evolution and may even have considered this in the context of design or
purpose, but he ended up a confirmed materialist.

In any case, I don't see that teleology is necessarily implied in the quoted
passage, nor in the immediately surrounding material from the Autobiography.
In the material I saw, he does not discuss the mechanism of this
perfectability. (Disclaimer: I have not read the Autobiography in full.)

&quot;Eschatology&quot; in its literal sense is certainly inappropriate, but since you
put in in quotes, we'll assume you meant it metaphorically. For the record,
Darwin was not referring the The Last Judgement, but to the natural end of
the universe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; or 2) it may be a very early quote.

&gt; If his Autobiography was written in 1882, how
&gt; is that 'a very early quote?'

"/>

Again, my apologies if my double posting led to confusion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I can't imagine Darwin
&gt;&gt; making such a statement after the publication of &quot;The Origin&quot;, at least
not
&gt;&gt; about biological processes.

&gt; Maybe his editor, Francis Darwin, took it out of context.

&gt;&gt; Frankly, it sounds like one of those things
&gt;&gt; Creationists dredge up in their attempts to discredit Evolution.

&gt; Our science, regrettably, is Calvinist, not Renaissance Baconian.
&gt; Newton crawled on his hands and knees up an airshaft of the
&gt; Great Pyramid with a tape measure because he believed that
&gt; the length of the airshaft predicted the date of the end of the world.

&gt; Einstein's opening verse of the STR paper is 'Let there be c.'

&gt; Bacon wrote that the evidence should dictate the theory, the
&gt; evidence should not be shaped to the theory.

There are thousands of libraries and museums full of evidence. This is not
the appropriate forum and it is simply too complex a topic to cover in an
email.

The origin of species is a topic that can be understood my any layman, but
if you consider yourself generally well-read on the subject and are not
convinced, I can only suggest that you begin with a high school biology text
to get the necessary background on the transmission of traits, then try
reading some of the more popular writers in the area - Richard Dawkins or
Stephen Gould, for example. The American Museum of Natural History in New
York has a particularly well developed area on evolution, although it takes
a specific &quot;ideological&quot; perspective, and probably won't persuade if you're
not inclined towards accepting the fact of evolution.

It is almost inconceivable, but the EXACT SAME VALUE is carried by the
following:

&quot;Gunnar may derive some private pleasure from his peculiar
hobby, and there may even be a bit of cheap sport in
turning his silly and useless methods back upon him,
but that is all there is to this stuff. One essential
to a valid cipher system is that the result be grammatical
and meaningful; another is that it be unique; another is
that it be the result of the strict application of fixed
keys such that any two competent people applying exactly
the same keys to exactly the same ciphertext will produce
exactly the same plaintext. Gunnar's methods meet none of
these standards, yet the passing score for a demonstrably
valid cipher is one hundred percent.

&quot;So what does he offer instead? Nothing really -- no,
that is unfair to nothingness, which has its own virtues.
If Gunnar had kept his games to himself or had spared hlas
his displays of folly or had never even devised them, then
we could have honestly said, 'nothing, really' -- but what
Gunnar has given us instead of the blessed nothingness that
his absence would impart is negativity. He gives us
blindness masking as sagacity; he gives a game of
solitaire tag that is so far beyond his meager powers that
although he is the sole creator and rule-keeper, he cannot
help but cheat. When challenged, he attacks without point
or purpose, and he attacks so feebly that his targets are
unlikely to know they have prompted his reaction.

&quot;Gunnar's fondness for his cipher sums is itself a greater
puzzle than any he has proposed or solved -- or would be,
if either the man or his ideas were even remotely
interesting -- but the persona he has adopted for himself
on hlas is one that would make an assembly-line's tedium
seem a relief, and make some of our most tiresome posters
seem witty by comparison. What possible benefit does
Gunnar imagine his posts provide either himself or anybody

Re. the following:

Shakespeare knew nothing of Gunnar's methods.

Comment:

Your *Shakespeare* never existed as flesh-and-blood individual - he was
the product of Francis Bacon's poetic imagination, whose power was
attested to by Abraham Cowley in 'Ode to the Royal Society' as follows:

Bacon, like Moses, led us forth at last,
The barren wildernesse he past,
Did on the very border stand
Of the blest promis'd land
And from the mountain's top of his exalted wit,
Saw it himself, and shew'd us it.

Bacon's Cipher Poetry is the product of &quot;exalted wit&quot; - it concerns
things in heaven and earth that are not dreamt of in our philosophy
alias &quot;the blest promis'd land&quot;, which he &quot;shew'd us&quot; through the
Pythagorean mode of communication, namely, by Cipher.

In the context, the &quot;us&quot; in question is Ignorant Humanity alias
Archetypal Stratfordian Poore Player, who entered the &quot;stage&quot; as
Gulielmus filius Johannes Shakspere, 17252, on April 26, 1564, and
exited at The End, 100, as Will Shakspere gent, 10026, on April 25,
1616 as in 17252 + 2602 + 1564 + 100 + 10026 + 2502 + 1616 = 35662.

The purported dates of the Stratfordian's 'baptism' and 'burial' (2602
+ 1564 + 2502 + 1616 = 8284) identify 'him' with the TEMPORAL aspect of
Jesus Christ, 7284, as Light of the World, 1000 as in 7284 + 1000 =
8284.

In the vocabulary of Saga-Shakespeare 'hidden poetry' the SPATIAL
aspect is denoted by the Icelandic word for Space or Rúm, 2312 as in
35662 + 2312 = 37974.

The 'record' is replete with indications of and references to the
'rivalry' between William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson - a 'rivalry'
which in Jonathan Swift's 'Gulliver's Travels' is represented through
tales of Yahoos and the Houyhnhnm race.

In the context of myth, the Yahoo/Stratfordian stage of the Psyche's
Evolution is nothing to be ashamed of - it's part of the natural order
of things.

Wilfull refusal to outgrow the Yahoo/Stratfordian stage is a different
matter.

Ben Jonson, having play-acted his Yahoo phase in what he represented to
have been the time during which he wrote his Epigrammes, documented his
Psyche's escape into Houyhnhnmland very succinctly - and to the point
for all but dyed-in-the-wool Yahoos - in the Dedication of Epigrammes
as follows:

&quot;For when I made them I had nothing in my conscience to expressing of
which I did need a CIPHER,&quot; 37974.

Your conscience is your business.

It's a measure of the man that Ben Jonson made his peace with William
Shakespeare - hence his epitaph, O RARE BEN JOHNSON.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ideas of neo-Darwinianism as incompatible. However, if the scientific

I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would have to rethink a lot of things.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Start re-thinking.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I am genuinely interested in seeing this scientific evidence. I think
&gt;&gt;&gt;that I have a fairly sharp mind, certainly when it comes to scientific
&gt;&gt;&gt;matters. You should also understand that there are large portions of
&gt;&gt;&gt;neo-Darwinianism that I do accept, for example, how drug resistant
&gt;&gt;&gt;strains of bacteria are created. But I have not come across evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt;for their theories creation of new species that has anything like the
&gt;&gt;&gt;strength of the evidence for the theory of atoms. If you don't want to
&gt;&gt;&gt;do this on this newsgroup, my return email will work just fine.

&gt;&gt; There are thousands of libraries and museums full of evidence. This is
not

&gt;&gt; The origin of species is a topic that can be understood my any layman,

takes
&gt;&gt; a specific &quot;ideological&quot; perspective, and probably won't persuade if

&gt; Well, I guess I don't have to start rethinking my philosophy of life

Why the 'sic?' I wrote 'Newtonian science.'

I'm referring to methodology, not content.

"/>

If you've read Einstein's STR paper you know that
not all science is not concerned with 'empirical facts.'
Einstein tore into his devoted follower Heisenberg
when Heisenberg suggested that the STR was mere
'empirical science.'

Empirical science (or grammarian science) has more
'moral imperative' in it because it is 1) constrained
to make direct observations of natural phenomena which
it describes in words and 2) words are grounded in the
'tradition' of etymology. They carry moral content. Few words are
truly values neutral.

The phrase 'taken out of context' describes the methodology
of mathematics-based science.

&gt; The point is bacon didn;t get it right. He underestimated the utility of

Bacon definitely understood the utility of numerical
measurement in science and although he was allergic to
math (recent brain research has explained why those
with super vocabularies cannot do math well--the language
function is forced to migrate into the 'math' hemisphere)
and kept math notations on all his experiments. (I would
guess that those with language in both hemispheres are more
proficient at making analogies--I doubt if anyone in history
has matched Bacon's ability to make legal, scientific and literary
analogies).

Most of his notebooks are lost but it is known that Bacon,
for example, was the first in history to figure out how
to calculate the weight of gasses. His notes including
the math for those experiments along with the observations,
are extant. Other Bacon experiments, scientific in method
but very odd in terms of experimental material, also include
math notations.

Bacon was doing arithmentic, not calculus, but Newton, who
hated to give anybody credit--hated it to the point that he
would destroy anybody who gave him a clue--wrote that Bacon
gave him the idea for calculus.

Bacon also supplied Newton with the basic premise for gravity
in his description of the force required for a mining process
done on the surface of the earth in comparison lesser force
required to do the same process at the bottom of the mine shaft.
It's amazing but Bacon's little description does have
elements of Newton's theory in it.

After twenty years of struggling with his theory, Hooke
inadvertently supplied Newton with the missing piece.
As I type this I realize that Newton, had he been paying
attention, could have gotten Hooke's 'force falling off
at the square of distance of the central attraction'
from Bacon's description of the mining process. Newton
took Hooke's suggestion and proceeded to destroy Hooke's
career. Maybe Newton, who wasn't entirely ethical, only attributed
the idea to Bacon after Hooke gave him the solution. We'll
never know because we shelter the reputations of theses
culture-idols. Don't we. Admit it, Fryzer.

Jesus was skeptical of the Pharisees who joined
forces with the Herodians against him.

I'm not sure why you're picking on the Catholics.
Over the course of Church history the Catholics
come out looking pretty good. The Church really is
charitable even if there has been occasional slippage.

What the Tudors did to the Catholic social system in
England makes the contrast between charity and predation
clear. English Catholics had a well-administered system
of hospitals, orphanages, poor houses (grammar schools
and universities) the former emptied and the properties
redistributed to Protestant allies. The refugees from
the Catholic charitable system turned London into a horror show.
The loveliest medieval architecture in Europe was smashed
to the ground to retreive the stones.

No wonder Oxford hated the Tudors. It's the finest
thing about him.

Sorry if I was a little flippant in my earlier responses.

My guess from your earlier posts is that you accept the basic &quot;descent with
modification&quot; idea but don't see how that can translate into something as
&quot;large&quot; as speciation - the distinction some Creationists make between
&quot;microevolution&quot; and &quot;macroevolution&quot;. You should be aware that this is a
distinction that evolutionary scholars generally just don't make. My formal
studies in evolution concluded over 30 years ago, however, and I feel
completely inadequate to the task of convincing you of this. So ...

Dawkins writes &quot;big books&quot;, and so does Gould, but Gould also has a number
of collections of his essays from Natural History Magazine. These run 6-10
pages apiece and they're for a popular audience, so they're not too hard to
take. It would be like reading one of my lengthier postings, but from a
significantly better writer who knows what he's talking about. Start with
the early ones, maybe &quot;Ever Since Darwin&quot; or &quot;Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes&quot;.
You'll find the essays grouped in categories that should make choosing a few
easy. Without going back and re-reading, I think the section on Adaptation
and Development in Hen's Teeth looks good.. (Peter Groves - can you
recommend any specific essays?) Also, it's sort of a big book, but you
might want to look at &quot;Beak of the Finch&quot; by Jonathan Weiner - which follows
a team studying Darwin's finches on the Galapagos Islands, and observing the
speciation process.

As I said, I try to learn from discussion. What I am learning about
genetics is that the process of reproducing DNA, and converting the DNA
code into proteins is extraodinarily interesting and complex. The DNA
sequence is rather like a computer tape, complete with stop and start codes.

I attended a debate on intelligent design versus Darwinianism, and the
intelligent design advocate brought up the subject of junk DNA. It
seems that there is a lot of the DNA sequence that just doesn't code
into proteins. But now they are finding that this &quot;junk&quot; seems to be
formatting codes, so that the proteins that do the decoding know where
to start. The I.D. advocate claimed that this was a success for the
I.D. theory.

But then afterwards I spoke with a Darwinianist who said that this was a
complete misrepresentation of the Darwinian position - they had always
assumed that this &quot;junk DNA&quot; was not purposeless. After talking for a
while, I said that it seemed to me that both hypotheses fit the data
equally well. He replied that it was better to do without extraneous
hypotheses like an external designer. I replied that he had now moved
the discussion from science to philosophy, and hence he had &quot;just lost
the argument.&quot; He smiled at me, and the conversation went on (and we
are now becoming good friends).

Honestly, I don't think that I.D. has refuted Darwinianism by any means.
But the fact is, a lot of the data out their now can be interpreted
either way. When I meet a person who is an advocate of Darwinianism, I
ask them - can you explain the mechanism by which species transform, or
even, do you actally know what that mechanism is? I always get
plausability arguments, never anything definitive. Now I do accept that
this is a science that is progressing, and I don't expect all the
answers. But to say that the I.D. argument is definitively disproved
is, I think, way way overreaching.

Let me compare this to the theory of atoms. There is just so very very
much to support it. I guess that in the old days all they had were
elements combining in definitive ratios to form compounds, Brownian
motion (leading to the idea of particles of gas), Milikan's oil drop
experiment (leading to the idea that nature works in discrete amounts),
and the periodic table (arrange the elements according to atomic weight
and see nice patterns). But now they have ideas of what the atoms are
made of. They can predict new elements with such certainty that they
are willing to pour in lots of money to look for this new element (for
which they can predict its properties), and they do indeed find it. Or
they can calculate almost the precise pathway for atoms to combine with
each other in the fusion process that creates the energy from the sun
and stars. Or they can do X-ray diffraction patterns of complicated
proteins, see how the atoms are arranged and folded, and use this to
create new drugs. They can do precise calculations of how the electrons
form different bands around the atoms, and can precisely predict
chemical reactions, as well as how to combine them to form electrical
circuits embedded in silicon. The evidence for the theory of atoms is
through the roof.

My search into understanding the origin of the species is a fairly new
project for me, and I do admit that I have not read the works of Gould
and Dawkins. But I have read the reviews, and read portions of Gould's
essays that I have found on the web. I do plan to get copies and read
them (I am guessing that I am going to like Gould more than Dawkins).
But I predict that they are not going to provide the definitive type
evidence for the genetic creation of new species of the strength that I
have found for the theory of atoms.

I do admit that I am quick to judgement. I skim read a book by one of
the I.D. advocates, and while it did make some good points, I was mostly
disappointed. I do recall someone showing me a hugely thick book that
the I.D. movement had written, and I opened it to a bunch of equations
that describe the universe (entropy, E=mc^2, Hamiltonian mechanics,
Schrodinger's equation, etc). These equations seemed so out of place to
the discussion that I couldn't help but feel that the author was just
trying to show off - I mean, putting E=mc^2 (an equation that describes
nature) next to Hamiltonian mechanics (a template for creating equations
of motion) is a bit like putting Shakespeare next to the phone book and
saying that they describe similar things. I haven't read all of the
literature from the I.D. movement, but these kinds of experiences are a
put off.

Similarly, I haven't read all the Darwinian literature. But I will be
greatly surprised if they have the kind of evidence that I am looking
for. In the meantime, I honestly don't think that the religious types
should feel threatened by current theories of the origin of the species.
Now the fact is, they do feel threatened, and as a result they have
tried to counter it with bogus counter arguments such as put forward by
creationists and I.D. But they should feel confident in the word of
God, which has stood with them for so much of the rest of their lives.

My thought is that science lacks something to translate/replace what
Shakespeare might have recognized as intention, purpose, necessity
operating in cosmology, so religion gets a handle on it, too. I bet
Darwin has pithy comments about this in strategic places. The captain
of the Beagle, Fitz-hugh was it?, might have been insisting on this
sort of thing when he became prickly and irritable with Darwin and
refused him dining privileges.

No doubt in Shakespeare's time the science/art of alchemy was their
way of discussing translation of lead into gold as a metaphor of
transubstantiation and immortality; myth of phoenix, too. They seem
to be pretty savvy about recognizing the classical paradoxes
concerning mutability and change when they discuss elements of fire,
time, light, water, earth, sun. Shakespeare's emphasis in the sonnets
on reproduction and art as the only ways to continue identity seems
significant in this context.

In our time, the quest seems to rely on science in industry labs,
going in the direction of unlocking natural resources and engineering
artificial environments, and transubstantiation and immortality are a
cosmic science fiction joke. But no doubt popular science likes the
poetry of intention, necessity, and purpose to allude to in referring
to logic of the cosmos. Still refers to logic of the psyche, too.

I just skim read one of Gould's essays:

He comes across as a delightfully honest writer, and I shall look
forward to reading some more of his writings. Certainly he thinks ill
of the current ideas of &quot;intelligent design,&quot; but he also cleanly admits
that the Darwinianists are far from understanding their whole theory.
For example:

Darwin's critical theory of functional shift, usually (and most
unfortunately) called the principle of &quot;preadaptation,&quot; has been with us
for a century. I believe that this principle has made so little headway
not only because the basic formulation seems paradoxical and difficult,
but mainly because we have so little firm, direct evidence for such
functional shifts. Our technical literature contains many facile verbal
arguments—little more than plausible &quot;just-so&quot; stories. The fossil
record also presents some excellent examples of sequential development
through intermediary stages that could not work as modern organs do—but
we lack a rigorous mechanical analysis of function at the various stages.

I am new to Shakespeare, but I am liking him very much (this is why I am
now on this newsgroup). So I have yet to read his sonnets. But I have
enjoyed looking at his plays to see his attitudes to religion. I have
to say that I was disappointed by what I read in Hamlet, which conveys
ideas of purgetory at a level that is little better than superstition.

But a few days ago, I think I saw something in Henry V, which to me is
quite remarkable. When Cambridge, Scroop and Grey's plot to kill Henry
is uncovered, and they are confronted, their response is unusual - they
beg for Henry's forgiveness, but entirely understand that their lives
should be forfeit. They seem almost glad that they have been
discovered. I believe that Henry's response &quot;I shall weep for you&quot; is
genuine. After they are taken away, he reads into this discovery that
God is with him.

I see this also when he is questioning Canterbury about Salic law - he
seems very insistent that Canterbury is speaking truthfully. (I think
it is clear that Canterbury does have an agenda, but nevertheless I am
quite convinced by his argument.) Again, just before the battle of
Agincourt, he is undeterred by being outnumbered, assuming that the
defeat or victory is determined by God, and that if he did have more
troops and God had determined that he should lose, that this would just
mean more casualties. Finally, after the battle he gives all the credit
to the hand of God.

When I first read this, I simply assumed that this was Henry trying to
say the right thing, but now I am thinking that he is being very
genuine. (Of course, I recognise that I am talking about a figmant of a
playwriter's imagination, so I don't know if the real Henry V was like
this.)

These ideas seem almost Calvinist/Augustinian to me.

Please don't fall into the trap of supposing that the lines given to a
character in an individual play tell you anything about the author's
attitudes, to religion or anything else. His job is to set up an imaginary
situation which will yield the sort of tensions and conflicts needed for
drama. There's no requirement for ideological consistency across the plays,
or indeed among the characters in each play, any more than society itself is
self-consistent in such matters. You have already noted that &quot;Hamlet&quot;
contains an horrific medieval image of Purgatory, while (so you judge)
&quot;Henry V&quot; demonstrates &quot;almost Calvinist/Augustinian&quot; views. That's what I'd
expect. The plays aren't devices for systematically conveying ideas, but
structures intended to excite, provoke and delight their audiences.

If you read some or all of the other plays, you will find, or suppose you
have found, that certain themes return repeatedly, and perhaps - perhaps -
they may reveal something of Shakespeare himself. Some readers, with
Wordsworth, would say that the sonnet form is the key with which
&quot;Shakespeare unlocked his heart&quot;, but if you google for the long series of
&quot;Sonnets&quot; postings to this newsgroup you will soon see the wide variety of
interpretations they provoke, some quite wild. Ignore all that: read them
slowly aloud, and let the sounds and images work on your imagination and

In short, treat Shakepeare as the artist he was.

Excellent! The work &quot;reads&quot; us as much as we read the work. That's amply
evident from the submissions to this group; they attempt to tell us
something about Shakespeare but tell us much more about the senders.
Shakespeare holds up a mirror in which to see ourselves and our own society.
That - mediated by his enormously skilful stagecraft - is why in the
theatre his work is so constantly performed and thereby inexhaustibly renews

&gt; I just skim read one of Gould's essays:

&gt; http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_functionalshift.html

&gt; He comes across as a delightfully honest writer, and I shall look
&gt; forward to reading some more of his writings. Certainly he thinks ill
&gt; of the current ideas of &quot;intelligent design,&quot; but he also cleanly admits
&gt; that the Darwinianists are far from understanding their whole theory.
&gt; For example:

&gt; Darwin's critical theory of functional shift, usually (and most
&gt; unfortunately) called the principle of &quot;preadaptation,&quot; has been with us
&gt; for a century. I believe that this principle has made so little headway
&gt; not only because the basic formulation seems paradoxical and difficult,
&gt; but mainly because we have so little firm, direct evidence for such
&gt; functional shifts. Our technical literature contains many facile verbal
&gt; arguments—little more than plausible &quot;just-so&quot; stories. The fossil
&gt; record also presents some excellent examples of sequential development
&gt; through intermediary stages that could not work as modern organs do—but
&gt; we lack a rigorous mechanical analysis of function at the various stages.

"/>

For the record, this quote sets up the rest of the article, which is
actually about providing hard scientific evidence to support &quot;just-so
stories&quot;; he goes on to demonstrate that even in the difficult case of
pre-adaptation, it is possible to find such evidence.

First of all, I should have thought about this long, long before now ... A
decade ago, I used to spend time in a discussion group called
alt.talk.origins. I haven't visited there recently, because they seemed to
have covered all the ground several times over. I presume they have a FAQ,
and you will probably find a counterpart to the Kathman-Ross page through
that.

I've seem worse.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; My guess from your earlier posts is that you accept the basic &quot;descent
with
&gt;&gt; modification&quot; idea but don't see how that can translate into something
as
&gt;&gt;&quot;large&quot; as speciation - the distinction some Creationists make between
&gt;&gt;&quot;microevolution&quot; and &quot;macroevolution&quot;. You should be aware that this is
a
&gt;&gt; distinction that evolutionary scholars generally just don't make. My
formal
&gt;&gt; studies in evolution concluded over 30 years ago, however, and I feel
&gt;&gt; completely inadequate to the task of convincing you of this. So ...

&gt; As I said, I try to learn from discussion.

"/>

I also like discussion - I find it helps to focus research. (In a possibly
futile attempt to keep the post on-topic ...) There are far too many people
in the authorship debate (and even more so in the Creationist-evolution
debate) who rely solely on what they hear from others or dredge up at a web
site.

For example, a favorite non-Stradfordian argument is that Shakespeare's use
of the law tells us he must have had legal training. My feeling is that
this argument is most convincing to people who have not read widely in
Renaissance English literature (or they would realize how widely legal
phrases show up in other authors) and in some cases, people who have not
actually read much Shakespeare.

For the record: The fact that legal phrases are widely seen in English
Renaissance literature does not in itself refute the
&quot;Shakespeare-was-a-lawyer&quot; theory, and (many of) the non-Stratfordians who
end up here over the long haul tend to look much deeper and in greater
detail.

I think conversation happens to be a very poor way to learn about the
Creation-evolution debate. It's very easy for Creationists (including
IDers) to raise a question in a few sentences which then requires literally
pages of refutation. The question looks simple and convincingly challenging
(&quot;How could the bacteria's flagellum have arisen?) but to refute it the poor
guy representing evolution has to go through mulitple complicated
arguments - why an argument from analogy is valid in this case; a discussion
of the underlying evolutionary concept (let's say pre-adaptation); followed
by a complex analogy (since we don't have, at this point, any direct
evidence for the evolution of the flagellum). By the middle of the first
argument, he's lost the audience.

(Note: In another post, Stephen M-S includes a Stephen Gould quote which
implies Gould has problems with the idea of preadaptation - as it turns out,
the article is about how preadaptation, although a difficult concept, is
actually valid.)

&gt; What I am learning about
&gt; genetics is that the process of reproducing DNA, and converting the DNA

&gt; sequence is rather like a computer tape, complete with stop and start
codes.

&gt; I attended a debate on intelligent design versus Darwinianism, and the
&gt; intelligent design advocate brought up the subject of junk DNA. It
&gt; seems that there is a lot of the DNA sequence that just doesn't code
&gt; into proteins. But now they are finding that this &quot;junk&quot; seems to be
&gt; formatting codes, so that the proteins that do the decoding know where
&gt; to start. The I.D. advocate claimed that this was a success for the

I am quite sure he smiled, most likely sadly. This is exactly the case I

There is, literally, no way to disprove ID - to Creationists. As long as

There is probably no active biologist, except for the tiny handful in the
Creationist camp, who would say that evolution is less true than atomic

over the last 100 years has been in the mechanisms of evolution.

&gt; and the periodic table (arrange the elements according to atomic weight
&gt; and see nice patterns). But now they have ideas of what the atoms are
&gt; made of. They can predict new elements with such certainty that they
&gt; are willing to pour in lots of money to look for this new element (for
&gt; which they can predict its properties), and they do indeed find it. Or
&gt; they can calculate almost the precise pathway for atoms to combine with
&gt; each other in the fusion process that creates the energy from the sun
&gt; and stars. Or they can do X-ray diffraction patterns of complicated
&gt; proteins, see how the atoms are arranged and folded, and use this to
&gt; create new drugs. They can do precise calculations of how the electrons
&gt; form different bands around the atoms, and can precisely predict
&gt; chemical reactions, as well as how to combine them to form electrical
&gt; circuits embedded in silicon. The evidence for the theory of atoms is
&gt; through the roof.

&gt; My search into understanding the origin of the species is a fairly new
&gt; project for me, and I do admit that I have not read the works of Gould
&gt; and Dawkins. But I have read the reviews, and read portions of Gould's
&gt; essays that I have found on the web. I do plan to get copies and read

Gould is more accessible, but be warned that both have an agenda.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I predict that they are not going to provide the definitive type

&gt; I do admit that I am quick to judgement. I skim read a book by one of
&gt; the I.D. advocates, and while it did make some good points, I was mostly
&gt; disappointed. I do recall someone showing me a hugely thick book that
&gt; the I.D. movement had written, and I opened it to a bunch of equations
&gt; that describe the universe (entropy, E=mc^2, Hamiltonian mechanics,
&gt; Schrodinger's equation, etc). These equations seemed so out of place to
&gt; the discussion that I couldn't help but feel that the author was just
&gt; trying to show off - I mean, putting E=mc^2 (an equation that describes
&gt; nature) next to Hamiltonian mechanics (a template for creating equations
&gt; of motion) is a bit like putting Shakespeare next to the phone book and
&gt; saying that they describe similar things. I haven't read all of the
&gt; literature from the I.D. movement, but these kinds of experiences are a
&gt; put off.

&gt; Similarly, I haven't read all the Darwinian literature. But I will be
&gt; greatly surprised if they have the kind of evidence that I am looking
&gt; for.

The kind of evidence you are looking for is to be found in high-school
biology books. I really mean this.

been conceived in historical sequence.

Barnardo:

As in 11421 + 10230 + 11156 + 10588 + 100 = 43495, where

10230 = Pure Elementall Wit;

11156 = Christopher Marlow;

10588 = Shakespeares Sonnets*; and

100 = The End.

* 'Shakespeares Sonnets' relates Light of the World's, 1000,

Archetypal Stratfordian's, 35562, Houre Vpon The Stage is cast in terms
of the Christian form of Kabbalah, where Light of the World's, 1000,
incarnation/crucifixion in the 'foundation' of MAN-Beast's Psyche, 345,
is prelude to Resurrection, 216, at The End, 100, of En Sof's
'vnfolding' at the level of Man through Ten Sefiroth, 35850*, the final
stage of which is En Sof's transformation from HE, 604 as in - 604, to
EK.

The technical details of En Sof's 'vnfolding' were addressed in my
message posted on April 30, 2005 on the thread: &quot;Shakespeare and
Kabbalah - Preposterous Pseudo-Theology? (The label is Tom Veal's -
the Question Mark is mine)

****
Apr 30, 11:06 am

Subject: Shakespeare and Kabbalah - Preposterous Pseudo-Theology?

The Kabbalah is at the heart of Augustan-Saga-Shakespeare &quot;theology&quot;.

In Karen Armstrong's 'A History of God', its central tenets were
summarized as follows:

&quot;The most influential Kabbalistic text was The Zohar, which was
probably written in about 1275 by the Spanish mystic Moses of Leon. As
a young man, he had studied Maimonides but had gradually felt that
attraction of mysticism and the esoteric tradition of Kabbalah. The
Zohar (The Book of Splendour) is a sort of mystical novel, which
depicts the third-century Talmudist Simeon ben Yohai wandering around
Palestine with his son Eliezar, talking to his disciples about God,
nature and human life. There is no clear structure and no systematic
development of theme or ideas. Such an approach would be alien to the
spirit of The Zohar, whose God resists any neat system of thought.
Like Ibn-al-Arabi, Moses of Leon believed that God gives each mystic a
unique and personal revelation, so there is no limit to the way the
Torah can be interpreted: as the Kabbalist progresses, layer upon layer
of significance is revealed. The Zohar shows the mysterious emanation
of the ten sefiroth as a process whereby the impersonal En Sof becomes
a personality. In the three highest sefiroth - Kether, Hokhmah and
Binah - when, as it were, En Sof has only just &quot;decided&quot; to express
himself, the divine reality is called &quot;he.&quot; As &quot;he&quot; descends through
the middle sefiroth - Hesed, Din, Tifereth, Netsakh, Hod and Yesod -
&quot;he&quot; becomes &quot;you.&quot; Finally, when God becomes present in the world in
the Shekinah, &quot;he&quot; calls himself &quot;I.&quot; It is at this point, where God
has, as it were, become an individual and his self-expression is
complete, that man can begin his mystical journey. Once the mystic has
acquired an understanding of his own deepest self, he becomes aware of
the Presence of God within him and can then ascend to the more
impersonal higher spheres, transcending the limits of personality and
egotism. It is a return to the unimaginable Source of our being and
the hidden world of sense impression is simply the last and outer-most
shell of the divine reality.&quot; (Ballantine Books, 1993, p. 247)

The Ten Sefiroth are listed on p. 246. Their Cipher Value calculated
by the Saga-Shakespeare Cipher Key is 35850 as detailed below:

En Sof (Without End) = 2638
Kether (Crown) = 3025
Hokhmah (Wisdom) = 2852
Binah (Intelligence) = 1559
Hesed (Love or Mercy) = 1953
Din (Power) = 1219
Tifereth (Beauty) = 4209
a.k.a. Rakhamim (Compassion) = 3301
Netsakh (Lasting Endurance) = 3514
Hod (Majesty) = 1261
Yesod (Foundation) = 2434
Malkuth (Kingdom) = 3816
a.k.a. Shekinah = 3392
Ek (&quot;I&quot; in 13th century Icelandic) = 677 = 35850

The Kabbalah concept of God as &quot;He&quot; is introduced in line 5 of Hamlet's
opening scene -

Bernardo:
Who's there?
Francisco:
Nay answer me; stand, and unfold yourself.
Bernardo:
Long live the king!
Francisco:
Bernardo?
Bernardo:
He.

&gt; Hal/Henry V is built up through the three plays, though they may not have
&gt; been conceived in historical sequence.

Yes, this is something that, in my amateur way, I have already been
thinking about. My first impression was that the Hal of Henry V is very
different from Henry IV (well certainly part 1), but I am trying to
reconcile them, and I don't think that this is a fruitless exercise by
any means. Was his sharp answer to the &quot;tennis balls&quot; helped by his
training shapening wits with Falstaff? Did Hal have some sense that his
help from God was undeserved, not just because his father had played a
role in Richard II's downfall, but also because his life before being
King was so wicked? I find these questions really fascinating, and I
don't yet have any good ideas or answers.

By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder,
and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how
he builds. For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already
laid, which is Jesus Christ. If any man builds on this foundation using
gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, his work will be shown
for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be
revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's
work. If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. If it
is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as
one escaping through the flames.

Since I sent my previous post, now I remembered what really bothered me.
As I said, I have a protestant theology that inclines me away from the
whole concept, on the other hand I do wonder that maybe 1 Cor 3:12-15
maybe makes a case for purgatory.

But what really bothers me is the whole importance of last unctions.
Hamlet's father's real problem was that he was poisoned while he was
asleep, so he didn't receive last unctions, and hence had some horribly
nameless amount of time to spend in the torture of purgatory.
Similarly, when Hamlet has a chance to take revenge on his uncle for the
murder, he sees that his uncle is at prayer, and supposes that if he
kills him at this instant that his uncle will skip purgatory. (Now
maybe Hamlet was just making an excuse to get out of doing the deed
right then, but I feel that Hamlet was being genuine to himself, at
least at some level.) There is even a command seruptitiously sent to
the English that Rosencrantz and Guildernstern should be killed
immediately without last unction - I mean, this pair of individuals
might have been a bit oily, but if Hamlet really did believe in his
version of purgatory, it is so cruel.

But, anyway, this whole notion that last unctions should save you from
millenia of purgatory seems so robotic and perfunctory. Surely God will
judge a person by his whole life. The 1 Cor 3:12-15 concept is that of
building upon the salvation of Christ using gold and silver, or wood and
straw. This is not something you perform just before you die, this is
something that you do in a lifetime. If Augustine or Mother Therasa or
Angela of Foligno had died without last unctions, and they had slipped
in a bad thought just before they died, would God then condemn them to a
few million years of purgatory?

The heroes of the Christian faith are known for their ongoing search to
know God better, and to better love their fellow human beings. They are
not judged on their imperfections, many as they are, because Jesus has
died for these, and his death counts whether you receive last unction or
not. This is true of the figures in the Bible, and the great men and
women of the protestant, catholic, and orthodox faiths.

You keep mentioning this, but as I have suggested previously, no biologist

The main point here should surely be about the
reasons of the playwright in raising such a topic
(or set of topics). He had an interest in this kind
of belief and, presumably, knew that his audience
did so too.

Yet (as I understand it) it would be hard to find a
matter of less interest to a London audience in the
years around 1600-1605. Purgatory was not a
publicly discussible topic at that time. It was a
belief very strongly associated with the Old
Religion and, while some people might still believe
in it, or want to believe in it, they would not bring
it up. It would have been something like Rosaries,
or Crucifixes, or the Virgin Mary. None of these
were officially condemned by the Anglican Church --
far from it -- but they were associated with idolatry
and Rome, and any discussion would have found
embarrassment and confusion.

This had been the case since 1559, with feelings
growing stronger throughout the reign, especially
after 1570 (and Elizabeth's excommunication) and
the war with Spain, starting in 1585.

So why are they a fairly important issue in the play?
I suggest that the author -- and his principal
audience -- had, in fact, lived through a Catholic
time. They had been brought up in these beliefs
and, while now rejecting them as essentially
superstitious, still found them fascinating.
They reminded them of their childhood, with
elements of sentimental nostalgia.

The playwright does not believe in Purgatory; yet
he finds such a set of beliefs interesting. He is
exploring what it was to have them, and act, or fail
to act, upon them. He does not condemn them, in
any way. He accepts that such was the framework
within which people of a previous generation
worked, and he accepts it for what it was, insofar
as he can understand it.

Paul.

Modern scholars who are finding Calvin in the

That the author of the Shakespeare works

why he was an establishmentarian but not a

"/>

Thanks. Let me tell you where I am coming from. I probably have a
better sense of who Augustine is than who Calvin is, because I have read
quite a bit of Augustine's work (and indeed I find it very impressive).
Augustine definitely does not come across as one who is laying down a
theology precept by precept, but rather one who is sharing the love of
God to his beloved flock. As for Calvin, I have read a couple of
history books about him or his times, but I have not read any of his
works. Nevertheless, the impression I am given is that most of Calvin's
works are concerned with the structure of the church, or its
relationship with government. He is laying down a framework so that he
can train missionaries to go into France and establish a church.
(Presumably he was unsuccessful in this short term goal because his work
was almost entirely wiped out in the St. Bartholemew massacre.) These
books gave the impression that the views that we currently call
Calvinism were a paragraph or two in his works that basically related
what was then standard Augustinian theology.

Thus, my sense is that what we traditionally call the five points of
Calvinism is not actually the work of John Calvin himself, but rather
that of those that followed him.

I took a course in theology which was based upon a book by Hodge, a
famous Princeton theologian. In his book, he never used the word
Calvinist, but often used the word Augustinian. The teacher (now a very
good friend of mine) never actually taught the &quot;5 points&quot; as such, even
though it was clear that his theology had a strong base in this. Thus
it seems to me that I became a Calvinist, but even today cannot tell you
verbatem what the 5 points are.

Anyway, to my next point. It seems to me that Calvin and Augustine try
to get their theology as much as possible based upon the Holy Scripture.
It is clear that scripture teaches that God knows all things and is
all powerful. But its flavor seems so different to say Shakespeare's
Macbeth. Macbeth receives prophecies, and after that point he is
totally powerless to change them, but rather, whatever action he takes,
he is stuck in it. As a contrast, I offer up 2 Kings 20. King Hezekiah
is given an unequivocal prophecy that he will die, and that he should
set his house in order. Hezekiah reacts by trying to negotiate with God
out of this. Remarkably enough, he is completely successful. A similar
story is told in Genesis 18 when Abraham persuades God not to destroy
Sodom if even only 5 righteous people would be found there.

Thus I see Augustinianism and Calvinism (or at least my own brands
thereof) as not being the same as fatalism - whatever the fates bring,
we cannot escape. Rather the author of our fates is personalised in the
form of God, and we are granted access so that we might pleed with him
to change his mind, and he often does if it pleases his perfect will.

I think that there is a fatalist version of Cavinism, which is, I guess,
what they mean by hyper-Calvinism. But I am fairly sure that both
Augustine and Calvin would have disagreed with that viewpoint.

Anyway, it seems to me that you have a better grasp on the history of
that time than I do, so I would welcome your comments and corrections.

Stephen

Sorry--was not meaning to criticize your religion; was wondering if
'Hamlet'
portrayed Purgatory differently than what was currently taught by the
Catholic church at that time. I should say, however, that belief in
Purgatory (I guess itis capitalized) still exists today--in fact, I was
taught to believe it on faith. I take it as seriously as I take the
concept of Heaven anyway.

I think the Catholic attitude is that if the church fathers haven't
figured out such concepts in almost 2000 years, what chance does one
have of doing so oneself, particularly if one has not rigorously
studied theology or the various languages in which the Bible was
originally written. Sunday school (probably more so after Vatican II, I
assume) takes a more practical approach, focusing on moral issues that
one encounters in everyday life, rather than on much direct study of
the Bible. (That's not to say that you shouldn't read or study the
Bible for personal enrichment.)

I am very glad you are asking such questions. I have been interested in
the
idea of repentance and the afterlife myself in the study of &quot;Doctor
Faustus', and was thinking I would have to go to the library and
helplessly look through many tomes written in an abstract style that I
would not be qualified to understand, but it seems as though there is
some quite straightforward information on the web. Actually, I got this
by looking at the religion newsgroups right here, which you might want
to try out yourself if you want a long discussion.

There is evidence from the Bible that the dead are not in Heaven, but
can be
helped to go to a better place. The quote you mentioned is indeed
included
at this link:

&lt;&gt;

Here is an official Vatican statement:

&lt;&gt;

Dorothy Sayers also has some nice notes on Purgatory, which I will
mention
when I answer your other letter about 'Hamlet'.

Most of us are average in morality and wouldn't seem to belong either
in Heaven or Hell, so Purgatory makes sense to me. It is a cleansing
for
our own good, or an unlearning of the bad habits we have that caused us
to sin.
How long you would have to stay there would partly depend on how much
you had
sinned.

Frankly, Hell presents a much bigger problem for me--it does not seem
fair that once one is there, it is impossible to get out (I suppose
with
a few exceptions.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I am very glad you are asking such questions.
&gt;&lt;http://www.scripturecatholic.com/purgatory.html&gt;

"/>

This is an impressive list of scriptures. I think the one that
impresses me the most is 2 Timothy 1:16-18, which seems to be an
explicit prayer for the dead. This is directly contrary to standard
protestant theology. (It is not completely clear to me that Onesiphorus
is dead at the time of writing, but it seems very likely from the context.)

Let me tell you how I came to 1 Cor 3:12-15. I had just bought a book
on impulse &quot;Christian Mystics of the Middle Ages&quot; (published by Dover).
I had just read the first chapter, which is about Angela of Foligno -
I have to say that I was extremely extremely impressed by her writings.

Then I looked in the contents and saw that one of them was writing about
purgatory, so I thought I would read it to mock it (as most of us humans
like to do with those we disagree with). Right at that moment the
scripture 1 Cor 3:12-15 flashed through my mind. Now it could have been
the Holy Spirit, it could have been a demon, or it could have been a
piece of undigested food. But it has set me thinking ever since.

I also recall seeing a list of the decisions made by the Ecumenical
Councils - there were 7 (excluding the Jerusalem one described in Acts)
that took place before the great schism. Certainly protestants place
great credence on the decisions of the earlier councils (Nician creed,
nature of Jesus as God and Man, Trinity, etc). But it looked like the
later councils (maybe the 6th) decided in favor of purgatory and praying
for the dead. (They also decided in favor of icons, and I have to say
that my reading of Colossians 1:15, which seems almost to be a
fulfillment of the second commandment, concurs with their decision.)

In many ways I feel that Luther's problem with the Catholic Church of
his time was not that they were wrong on specific theologies, but rather
that they taught a someone formulaic approach to holiness and God. I
myself am becoming convinced that what God really wants of us is that we
seek him with all our hearts, minds and souls. Certainly this is the
major thrust of the writings of Angela of Foligno, but I also see a
great deal of this in the Old Testament (e.g. Jeremiah, Job, Psalms),
and also in Jesus's utter disappointment in the prevailing teaching of
the Parisees of his time, which seemed more focused on interpreting the
details of the Mosaic Law rather than understanding the actual person of
God.

I am aware that Luther did not wish to break from the Catholics on many
issues, for example, he did believe that the bread and wine are really
the blood and body of Christ, not merely symbolic. (Although he does
state that he does not believe in transubstantiation, which I guess is
an Aristotlean interpretation of this same notion - Luther was very much
against the teaching of Aristotle in the church - I guess that it was
Aquinus who introduced the Catholic Church to Aristotle, and the
Catholic Church holds Aquinus in very high regard.)

Thus my sense is that what Luther really wanted to do was let people
know that they could have a personal relationship with God, and that
this was something He greatly desired. I get this partly from the
recent movie about Luther, and partly from conversations I had with a
scholar of Luther.

In any case, Paul's prayer for the dead Onesiphorus comes across as a
very genuine request made personally to God, and certainly not formulaic.

passage about good figs and bad figs (sorry cannot quite remember where
it is right now, but it is a long section). The bad figs are so bad
that they are thoroughly disgusting, unfit for anything except to be
thrown away. The good figs are unbelievably good tasting and totally
wonderful. This gives me a sense that with God you are either very much
in, or completely out.

There are also other passages all over the O.T. prophets in which the
wicked are compared to a pile of leaves, ready to be swept up and burnt
away, because they are good for nothing else.

There might be a great deal of truth to that, though we don't really
know for sure.

Yet at the same time, Shakespeare could also have modeled it on the
ghost of Andrea in Kyd's 'The Spanish Tragedy', who did not receive
proper rites of burial (in the classical world) and comes back wanting
revenge. In fact, I believe Kyd was said to have written an earlier
version of Hamlet, which is now lost. It's possible that there was a
ghost in that one too.

First, and I'm assuming this has been pointed out by others, noting

Actually andrea (the ghost) does receive proper burial (AI, SI):

&quot;But churlish Charon, only boatman there, ... [I.1.20]
Said that, my rites of burial not performed,
I might not sit amongst his passengers.
Ere Sol had slept three nights in Thetis' lap,
And slaked his smoking chariot in her flood,
By Don Horatio, our Knight-Marshal's son,
My funerals and obsequies were done.
Then was the ferry-man of Hell content
To pass me over to the slimy strond
That leads to fell Avernus' ugly waves.&quot;

Andrea returns as a ghost to avenge his killer:\

&quot; Whereat fair Proserpine began to smile,
And begged that only she might give my doom.
Pluto was pleased, and sealed it with a kiss. ... [I.1.80]
Forthwith, Revenge, she rounded thee in th' ear,
And bade thee lead me through the gates of Horn,
Where dreams have passage in the silent night.
No sooner had she spoke but we were here,
(I wot not how) in twinkling of an eye.

REVENGE: Then know, Andrea, that thou art arrived
Where thou shalt see the author of thy death,
Don Balthazar, the Prince of Portingale,
Deprived of life by Bel-imperia.
Here sit we down to see the mystery, ... [I.1.90]
And serve for Chorus in this Tragedy.&quot;

The source of the ghost in the revenge tragedy is probably the senecan
revenge tragedy (see eg seneca's thyestes- trans 1581 by Jasper Heywood).

that he was a co-owner of the theatres the produced his plays, that his

Ah, I knew it would raise its ugly head sooner or later. You're just
another snob. According to you (your level of logic - your level of
insight - your ability to think) a person who lives in a provincial
town until his mid-twenties cannot be a great playwrite. A person who
- God forbid - has three children by the age of 21 is not worthy of
becoming a great playwright.

Shakespeare.

Everything in Stratfordia makes that kind
of sense. Strats are so dopey that they
don't even notice. It is a entire ideology
based on an unquestioning dopiness.

'Worthy'? Such a person -- in an Elizabethan

&gt;&quot;Will. Shakespeare&quot;
&gt; (handwritten) (EKC II, 319; facs. SS, 136)

"/>

From Schoenbaum 'Compact Documentary Life' page 183:

&quot;On 15 March 1595 the Accounts of the Treasurer of the Queen's Chamber
list William Shakespeare as joint payee, with William Kempe and Richard
Burbage-all three 'servants to the Lord Chamberlain'-for plays performed
before her Majesty the previous St. Stephen's Day (26 December) and
Innocents' Day (28 December) at the royal palace at Greenwich. The
Innocents' Day citation is probably a mistake; a payment to the Admiral's
men for the 28th appears in the same Accounts, and the Chamberlain's
players seem to have had another date that day. But that is a trifling detail.&quot;

This is NOT 'a trifling detail'. It shows that
the official record is false. In any case, the
entire record makes no sense -- under the
Stratfordian scenario. What is the poet
doing in the same company as Kempe and
Burbage? Under the Strat scenario, he was
no great actor, and by this time he had not
written much, nor could have built up funds,
nor acquired a shareholding.

&quot;This record is the first to connect Shakespeare with an acting company,
and the only official notice of his name with respect to a theatrical
performance. The entry shows that Shakespeare had become a leading
member of the Lord Chamberlain's men. He would stay with that company,
which eventually passed under royal patronage, until he retired from the
stage altogether. . . &quot;

The poet's pseudonym was 'Will Shake-speare'.
The cover-up was initiated in 1596 or early 1597,
since the Stratman was in funds and able to
pay for New Place in May 1597. From that time
on, we can expect to see the Stratman's name in
a form close to that of the poet's.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; It does not follow from the fact that no correspondence has come down to

His house was in the possession of his family

famous. There is no good reason for an
absence of correspondence.

Shakespeare was not just another Elizabethan

&gt; The Stratford monument, first folio etc stand as indubitable evidence

&gt; william shakepseare of stratford and william shakespeare the writer and

This identification was clearly the purpose
of the cover-up (with 'the actor' being pure
invention).

Typical stupid Shakespeare hater methodology (and I'm using the word
loosely). You want Shakespeare to be illiterate so you can keep up
your little conspiracy and feel important. So you use backwards logic
- he didn't teach his daughter to read, so he couldn't read either. Of
course, you ignore the fact that he wasn't around (he was in London) to
teach her himself, and that even if he was around he might not have
taught her to read because it wasn't socially necessary.

all, because you can't. And, apparantly, your grasp of rhetoric is so
feeble that you think throwing in an idea like, &quot;if he stayed there

Of course, Shakespeare wasn't a peasant or a near-peasant, which is
obvious from what is known of his father and mother, and from the
wealth he appeared to have amassed over his life. You know that,
because conspiracy nuts know all about Shakespeare's record, but like
conspiracy theorists the world over, in the heat of the moment you lose
your grip on reality and are perfectly willing to present statements
that have no bearing on the matter being discussed just to muddy the
waters.

I can't see an answer. Let me repeat the

parent of illiterate children?

I suggest that you haven't; or that if you
had, there was an obvious explanation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Nope. I want to know the truth. It would
not matter too much to me if the Stratman
turned out to be literate. A lot of people at
the time were. Given his social circumstances
it would not be very surprising. But, on
balance, they would indicate he probably
wasn't. Literacy did not spread quickly, and
since his parents weren't literate, and had
been doing badly financially while he was
of school-going age, the greater likelihood
is that he was illiterate.

Also consider his 'signatures'. They are
not those of a person used to writing.

He paid a VAST amount of money for New

he must have been saving that for a long

Read the plays. Every woman who is not

It is insane to maintain that the playwright
would have illiterate children. Wouldn't
he want them to be able to read his works?
Would he want to write to them? Wouldn't
he expect letters from them?

You are a perfect illustration of the depths
of ignorance to which Strats can sink.

Paul, you are blatantly lying now, you liar.
You lie when you say (dishonestly) that the

a single sample of their writing.

old Hamnet who died? We have nothing yet
of his hand?) The girls left you evidence that
you blatantly ignore.

Don't dare pretend you want the truth.

Your reading deficiency is also defined as
illiteracy because you cower from the fact that
Susanna wrote, owned books, sold books,
inherited the theatre gatehouse of the
documented playwright, and made a big
liar out of you.
