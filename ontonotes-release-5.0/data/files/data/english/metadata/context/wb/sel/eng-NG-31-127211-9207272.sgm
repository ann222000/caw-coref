The Giants first 2 losses may have come vs the best 2 team in the NFC right
now, with the 'Girls takin down Chicago and GB beating SD. That is nothing
to be ashamed about, maybe we can at least match that 8-8 of last year if
the D has stopped the bleeding.

I don't care who you play, playing D the way they did those first two
games is worthy of shame.

That was frustrating to watch because I thought Chicago took
themselves down. Their QB, Wrecks Grossman, had one of his turbo-
charged dunderhead days and super return man Hester fumbled three
times. Against everybody else, Hester runs back everything for
scores,  from kickoffs to punts to field goals, but against Dallas he
can't even field the ball. And he had the nerve to sass them when they
kicked away from him on the first kickoff. Hester can kiss my ass.

Green Bay can be the real deal, if Favre continues to play like he's
reached a new level of maturity. If he starts gambling too much, he
can sink their ship. I thought he was amazing against us. Some of his
biggist pass completions were actually into good coverage, but you
can't defense perfect throws. You can only sack his ass to stop that.

That made me laugh, Doc. I definitely feel your pain, though.

Agreed, there are no glasses rosy enough to peer through at those two
debacles.

The NFC defines mediocrity. Those two losses were an embarassment for
the defense and there's no positive spin changing that basic fact.

I understand your guys point and maybe i'm just bein pollyanna and tryin to
put a &quot;positive spin&quot; on it but I can't help but think if the defense just
plays kinda shitty and not ultra shitty opening night we beat the Girls in
Dallas and are 2-1 and sit on top of the NFC east right now, but i'm sure
the fans of most the other 1-2 teams can say the same thing.

Also i'm starting to reevaluate this AFC dominence thing especially after
GB beats one of the AFC's supposedly &quot;Elite&quot; teams. To me it looks like the
Pats and Colts (who do play in the AFC I know) and then EVERYONE else no
matter what conference. After all the AFC might have the 3 worst teams in
the league (Oakland, Cleveland, Buffalo) to offset the 2 best ones.
Pittsburg has beat who? Cleveland, Buffalo and SF? Granted they smashed them
all but Please.

I'm not the only one who sees the glass half full after 3 games, the only
loss from the Giants first 3 opponents came from the Giants. Here is a quote
from todays post:

All of a sudden, the Giants can look back and see some light escaping from

8-1.

Careful with this logic, it's only 3 games.  If the Packers tank and
finishes the season 4-12 are you going to lament that the Giants lost
to a shit team?

Okay, you want a legitimate postive outlook, how about:

Although the Giants were thoroughly embarassed defensively in the
first two and one half games of the season, the unit showed signs of
life in the second half of the Redskin game. Maybe that's what it has
taken for the coaches to get the right players in the right positions
and the players to get comfortable with the scheme.

With a Giant offense that has been productive in each of the first
three games, if the defense can put in a strong effort against
Philadelphia this Sunday night, then Giant fans may have something to
hang their hats on and argue that they were no worse off at this time
last season.

You cannot justify losing games in any way shape or form IMO.

Two things:

1. I wouldn't lump the first half vs. Washington in with those first two
weeks' defensive performances. The Giants were down, 17-3, but one of those
TDs came on a 6-yard drive following the Manning fumble. On the other TD
drive, they gave up one big play, the 49-yarder to Moss, which killed them.
But overall it was a pretty decent defensive performance -- not the kind
that we Giants fans remember from the Belichick and Fox defenses, but
nowhere near as embarrassing as Weeks 1 and 2.

2. It's pretty early in the season to make the kind of definitive
evaluations I see people making in this newsgroup. The defense was horrible
for two weeks, then better this past weekend--does that mean it took a while
but the players finally are comfortable with the new scheme, or was it
simply a matter of Washington sucking and it'll be back to horrible next
week for our defense? On offense, Manning has been good, throwingthe ball
accurately and mostly making good decisions. (I even disagreed with Aikman's
criticism on that interception Eli threw while being flushed out of the
pocket; I had no problem with him firing a jump ball way downfield with
Burress being covered by a short DB. To me, his problem on that play was not
mental but physical--it was a horribly thrown ball...although it ended up
being the equivalent of a Feagles punt, pinning the Skins at their 14.)
Anyway, I digress. My point is that Eli's strong start could mean he's
maturung into the leader (and accurate thrower) he needs to be, or it could
simply be three good games in a long season that will wear him down, leading
to the same kinds of mistakes he's always made. It's too early to have even
an inkling. Truth is, we have no idea yet whether the Giants are as bad as
we thought they were after watching the first two games, or whether they're
capable of competing in the parity-rules NFC.

Right, pretty much my same thinking. I was bein chastised by some people
this offseason for being to pessimistic, Now I say the Giants have a chance
to go 8-8 and i'm Tony Robbins! I love how Eli is playing but I don't know
how anyone can get to up about it after last 2 years, i'm takin the same
wait and see approach as you mention. As for the defense I pretty much
expected them to suck as is well documented, but did I think they were gonna
be as horrid as the 1st 2 weeks? No way.
Last week gave me one hope: That this team can be competitive this year.
I'm under no impression this team is goin anywhere, in fact if Coughlin gets
to 8-8 with the mish mash Reese gave him i'm thinkin he did a good job. To
save his Job I think he needs at least a playoff win and chances are that
aint happening but stranger things have happened.

It's not too early to tell that Manning looks better  this season than
last, and I'd be the last guy to defend Manndrake without tangible
evidence.

It would be nice to not pass judgement on anyone or anything because
it's too early, but evaluation happens a consistent basis not just at
the end of the season.

I think that his ratio of inaccurately thrown passes to well thrown
balls has improved. I don't recall seeing anywhere near as many passes
too high or too low the way we have in the past. The dropped balls were
the story on Sunday, not Eli hitting guys in the knees or risking
getting them decapitated by throwing just a bit too high.

To the receivers credit (particularly Shockey and Burress) they've
caught a lot of passes the past couple of years that were not easily
caught (of course, Shockey also drops too many that should be easily
caught). If Eli can continue to be more consistently accurate, it will
lead to more completions, obviously, but also more YAC and other good
stuff.

&gt; too high or too low the way we have in the past. The dropped balls were
&gt; the story on Sunday, not Eli hitting guys in the knees or risking
&gt; getting them decapitated by throwing just a bit too high.

&gt; To the receivers credit (particularly Shockey and Burress) they've
&gt; caught a lot of passes the past couple of years that were not easily
&gt; caught (of course, Shockey also drops too many that should be easily
&gt; caught). If Eli can continue to be more consistently accurate, it will
&gt; lead to more completions, obviously, but also more YAC and other good
&gt; stuff.

Not only accuracy, but his choice of receivers seems to be much better,
too. Is it just me or does he seem to be throwing into the weaker points
of the defense this year as opposed to into coverage?

It's not you, he's better at reading defenses IMO.

And while he's not big brother at the line of scrimmage, and occasionally
looks like he has to go badly but can't find a john, he's looked to be in
command, for the most part, when he's stepped up to center. He seems
comfortable.

Geezer,

The Giants beat the Deadskins. It's not hard to keep the Deadskins
from scoring alot. Start crowing when the Giants slows down a decent
offense.
