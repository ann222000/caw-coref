I see the ceramics are going down a bomb. :)

So here's a bit of furniture .....

Age?

Who made it?

Country of origin?

What style is this?

Worth ... not just monetary? (if any)

Best place to market it, and why?

All offense and rude comments welcome. ;&gt;)

Ronnie,

Just my guesses!

Looks like a &quot;dressing table&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Age? Victorian 1860-1880 maybe

&gt; Who made it? English maker

&gt; Country of origin? English

&gt; What style is this? Victorian but has a hint of an

"/>  Empire or Napoleanic style.

I have seen pine dressing tables like this but not exactly
like it. The deep area in the middle and the triangles
around the handles might lead me to believe its Edwardian
or maybe its a piece that has been altered a bit I don't
know I'm probably wrong and way off the mark.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Worth ... not just monetary? (if any) 2500 pounds +

&gt; Best place to market it, and why? Your shop? :)

"/> or an upscale shop in London maybe.... so you can ask
more money for it from those rich American tourists. 8-)

Good Luck,

Kat

Also too low, and no kneehole. I don't know about these things, but
it looks like a piece for an entry hall, maybe merkin, maybe cherry or

Thank goodness you said that... as you know, I'm not very good with
furniture, and when I saw that table, I thought, ohmygawd, what the heck
is that big, blocky thing?!?!

Figures it's be American too. &lt;g&gt;

I'm going to try this without looking in my books. &lt;g&gt; It looks kind of
Empire, but not quite... so I'm guessing it's probably a little later
than that. Are those (what we call across the pond) Celtic crosses in
the mirror hinges? The carving near the bottom of the mirror sides also
reminds me of Eastlake, but not. Geez... Empire and Eastlake! &lt;big grin&gt;
Do I have my time periods totally screwed up or what?

It's big and clunky too, but not as &quot;blocky&quot; as the other one. Ah heck,
maybe it's Gothic Revival?

Okay, you can all laugh now that I've shown my total ignorance!

PS - love the BW platters on the back cupboard!

Have fun, Michele

supports on either side, there's no marble of splash-back. This is a
Duchess dressing table, originally part of a full suite. In the full
suite there would have been a washstand, (as well, two robes, bed, pot
cupboards and side chairs) similar to the dressing table but without
the mirror and would have a marble topped surface with a 3/4 marble
gallery with a small shelf (around the top surface).

In fact, what you see BEHIND this dressing table out of view, is a
marble backed Duchess washstand, unfortunately, not the match to this
dressing table, but another variation and obviously once belonging to
another suite. So what YOU see, is the BACK of the marble gallery,
fixed to that washstand, and you should notice the front (turned) and
rear legs (flat) of the washstand, you'll also note a Asian type
writing box sitting on the platform base of the washstand. You are
confusing two separate pieces.

What you see this time is a bed from in and around the same period as
the Duchess dressing table. Sometimes in my neck of the woods this is
called an &quot;Albert&quot;

The two head boards as shown (top, high headboards and bottom foot
boards) these are of course shown without the adjoining side rails and
spring. The fabric on the top headboard is gone.

&lt;sarcasm&gt; I suppose we should just leave it that way, the punters will
go mad for the originality of that ... eh wot!! &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

"/> Hi, dlm, (out of interest) I found this photo and I believe this may
well be the marble top washstand that was hiding behind the dressing
table, if not the very one, then a very similar one.

The picture is way out of perspective (camera lens/focal length) and
doesn't show the under-carriage of the washstand, but just picture it
similar to the dressing table, but with this marble top in replacement
for the dressing table's mirror, drawers etc etc .....

btw .. in the foreground of the pic. ;&gt;)

Now that I think about it, the Celtic cross has a longer bottom, and now
that you mention Maltese, yup, that's it! &lt;g&gt;

Eastlake also gave his name to a late 19th, early 20th American style,
which is how I recognized it as Eastlake. American Eastlake is more like
English Eastlake on acid though!

Have fun, Michele

comment on them. I myself have finally gone and bought a couple of
furniture books just so I can play along. But, alas...they are at my shop

any useful dialogue. Two or three times, sometimes, to look while I

pictures for us. Thanks.

FWIW I had pegged the last dressing table as late 1800's. If you
posted the info for the previous piece, I missed it. I'd guess early
1800's there. Regency, perhaps, but I'm not sure about the heavy
legs.

&gt;This is indeed an American piece. The locks and hardware signed &quot;Stock

&gt;table, considering it was once part of a bedroom suite, comprising,
&gt;robe, bed and twin bedside cabinets. I was offered the dressing table
&gt;only, privately, the rest of the suite was retained by the owner, a
&gt;sane character, although, hard to believe at the time.

&gt;It's what we call over here &quot;a right dog&quot; a bit like a piece of shite
&gt;only worse. Just what this style was supposed to be GOD only knows. I
&gt;assume c1880-1900, possibly long grain walnut or maybe .. er
&gt;bongo-wood, but don't think in this case it really matters how old it
&gt;is or indeed the species of wood.

&gt; .... I bought it because it was cheap, er cheap as in &quot;not a lot of
&gt;money&quot; it was sold to a pair of shifty shipper from Scotland, and I
&gt;can only assume, or at least sincerely hope and pray it is now back
&gt;home in the good old US of A where it no doubt belongs. I always get a

"/> Thanks Marshall, if I recall, this dressing table I sold in around
400-500 GB pounds.

I don't know about 2000 USD Huh!! ... some American prices seem crazy

eyed a big nondescript Edwardian chest of drawers, she asked the price

was at one time Oz or American fodder. I shipped boat loads of this

trade of ship and who wants to retail it. I buy very little of this

$600 and double for resale.

Ronnie, I see grain like that and want to run up and touch it... often
it doesn't even matter what the wood was made into (bed, armoire, etc),
it's just the _wood_ that looks so incredible.

As to the new piece... bulky, heavy, ponderous. Empire? &lt;grin&gt;

Ronnie, a lot of 100 year old furniture here in the States wouldn't look
so &quot;fresh&quot; in their finish... heck, I could show you 50 year old wood
furniture that looks like it'd been left out in the sun for 100 years.

Most of the wood appears dried out, and the finish is usually worn off.
So when we see a piece that looks as good as your recent pics, I'm not
surprised their first assumptions were &quot;It's been refinished.&quot; For the
most part, the finish looks too good to be original.

HTH, Michele

I recall someone liked the word &quot;blocky&quot; for another piece. What are some of
the adjectives you tend to use the most to describe your stock/collections?
I'm not in this biz but I like the descriptors as much as (or more than) the
piece sometimes. A morose dresser. An obsequious little coffee table. An
anorexic vase. A charismatic lampshade. A melodious camelback....

I am asking partly because wordplay is fun and partly because I'm interested in
how those of you in this line of work present and describe what you have--what
have you found to be effective, to describe with a lot of detail, or minimal
and let the visual carry it? I was so interested in the approach taken by that
woman on E bay who was selling the sewing boxes, the one who presented a whole
soap opera between the photos.

What kind of response do you get when you sell using some kind of gimmick like
that? Would you be more or less likely to buy something that was described in
an unusual way? Or would a funny or funky description just make you more
likely to view the item but not affect your choice to buy?

Well, the grain in the chair (oak?) certainly isn't anything special, so
I'm going to say it originally had that white (Louis XVI ?) gesso? and
gold finish, and someone stripped it and stained it. On top of that,
someone did a lousy job re-upholstering it! &lt;g&gt;

The footstool's inlay looks pretty nice from what I can see of it.

We call the pros &quot;upholsterers,&quot; I think.

For the most part, I think the material something is made of should
speak for itself. If you're going to paint a lovely grained wood, you
might as well have used metal or plastic instead. Conversely, don't
wood-grain a steel front door (which is the fashion here)... it's steel,
dammit, don't try to make it something it's not! &lt;g&gt;

OTOH, I'm the first one to paint over a plain new-growth pine piece when
I've gotten tired of looking at the stained finish. And I usually don't
strip old paint from an older piece before re-painting over it - the
history of the piece is in the layers of paint (assuming it was painted
from Day 1), and I don't want to mess with the lead layers anyway. &lt;g&gt;
But I try to keep a nicely grained older piece's finish intact. I may
use wax or oils, but usually don't try to refinish it unless it's not
that old.

Here's a quick (bad) pic of a 30's kitchen cupboard. Originally it was
white (about 7 layers of it), with black and red stenciling on the
glass. The stencils were nearly gone, so I scraped them off, repainted
it and replaced the hardware.

http://www.ao.net/~chaos/cupboard.jpg

For the most part, wood should look like wood, chrome like chrome,
aluminum, plastic and whatever like what it actually is. In the
cupboard's case above, it was masonite and pine, and was meant to be
painted, so I had some fun with it. But faux finishes have no place in
my home decor! &lt;big grin&gt;

Have fun, Michele

Did I really blow it that badly Ronnie? If so, please explain about the
chair then...what, when, how, etc.

I guess I can't blame you for not liking the cupboard, but heck, who

No....honestly we're not......that....stuff..is what passes for antique
here. I haven't seen ANYTHING lately that hasn't been stripped, sanded, and
then usually bolstered with screws for support. Your stuff, even what you
call shite, looks fantastic.
I'm getting a new Digital camera soon, if I can I'll get some of the images
of what passes as antique, at least here in the Northwest.

I know Jon said there was good stuff over here because he has seen it on
ebay, but I would bet that they are few and far between. Plus most, if
not all, of the really fine antiques are going to be found on the east
coast only. Very little was taken across country very far and &quot;them
that was&quot; became fodder for the Indian campfires.
Anything prior to 1920 is considered &quot;really old&quot; in this part of the
country (midwest) unless you are 25 and then it might be even later. :-)

And I can see why there is a market for
it. Take the lady who just posted about
her purchase of an old house that had some
old furniture in it. Lacking a knowledge
of the field, it is easy to see how one reaches
the conclusion that old=good or old=antique.

that this is just used furniture.

&gt; The more I read our American cousins, the more I become convinced they
&gt; stripped and refinished every damn piece of Victorian furniture we
&gt; sent them. Either, they thought all this imported British stuff was
&gt; wrong and had already been refinished, or else, it's just the natural

&gt; over, devoid of any colour, and falling apart.

&gt; There's no other answer .... or is there? :))

&gt; Ronnie
&gt; =====

"/> Hi all,

The cult of the original finish is alive and well on this side of the
pond,
almost to the point of the ridiculous. Few people realize that the thick
mirror finish is a result of years of touch ups and repolishing, and
that it was common practice to have your furniture recoated with French
polish any time it began to look shabby. French polish is not really
that durable, but is easy to repair, so in reality the majority of the
old pieces have already been refinished, in some cases yearly. In a lot
of cases, what we see as an original finish over here is just a sad
shadow of what it once was, like a over the hill movie star loaded up
with makeup, marquetry faded, veneers lifeless and pockmarked with
improper repairs and legs wobbly. The big difference between two sides
of the pond could be the cult of newness here in North America, anything
new is king for a while until something even newer comes along, the old
king is dumped and out of favour until a fad brings him back again, but
during his exile life has been so tough he needs a complete make
over.;~) I get pieces in all the time that are structurally sound, but
the finishes are beyond restoration, the old finish has gone to the
point of powder, or gone to the bare wood in places, mahogany bleached
to the point it looks like birch plywood. The pieces I get in for just
repolishing are out numbered 50 to 1 by the ones in need of a total
'Restoration', it might be neglect on the part of the past owners or our
extreme humidity and temperature fluctuations over here that have
something to do with the need to refinish everything. To give an example
of what happens to a piece brought over from Britain, I recently was
called out to examine a washstand brought back from England two months
ago. This piece since it has been here has developed a split in the top
and shelf and several pieces of marquetry have come loose, plus four of
the glue blocks have let go, all probably because of the difference and
swiftness of climate change.

"/> Exactly my point in another post, Mike. Professional shippers, that
are exporting middle market (victorian, WmIV or late GeoIV) will not
buy or touch pieces that are already showing grain cracks, splits,
veneer lifting, inlay lifting, or any other damage that will possibly
degrade or fall into further deterioration when it hits the shores of
America or OZ. Even furniture sitting in the back of a container, for
several weeks, runs that risk, these containers are like ovens. Much
Vicky stuff used very thin carcasses with thin veneer, this stuff is
usually a NO NO for the shippers, even if no grain cracking or splits
are apparent, many shippers will STILL not buy this stuff, for obvious
reasons.

I take your point on refreshed furniture, many times over the years
the polish has had a light rubber added, has been waxed on a regular
basis, maybe twice (or more) a year for many times in its life.
However, this is not the same as a complete refinish or re-polishing
job. If much of this furniture had not be cared for over the years
then it would have deteriorated. If it had not been cleaned (as in
dusted and buffed with a dry wax free cloth) daily it would degrade.
Daily cleaning certainly the common practice in Victorian and
Edwardian times but right into the 50/60s and possibly longer,
depending on the type and status of home where these pieces normally
resided. As well as the daily buffing many of these pieces, as I have
said, received care with waxing, this all added to the finish we
expect to find on good well cared pieces, this is how patina builds.

In real life, all the good Vicky pieces I showed, the years of
accumulated dirt and household air-borne grim which had settled on the
furniture and where the duster never touched or when the duster merely
push it all into all the nooks and crannies was there, in and around
the leg turnings, in the low relief of the carvings, around handles
etc etc precisely what we hope to find. Doesn't matter if one is the
King of the restorers that can not be faked. Deep staining, perfume
spills, ink spills, dents etc., etc., etc., all there. Because the
detail is not shown in the pictures one should not assume. Dressing
table tops did suffer, and suffered heavily over the years, sure many
times the dressing table top had an extra clean, a good waxing or even
a quick refreshing with the rubber, this is NOT refinishing, this is
the life of a dressing table. These folk knew what they had at the
time, they cared for the stuff, either the local cabinetmaker, local
antique dealer even, or if their status had merit, the on-site
carpenter, all helped in the care of the pieces. This is a different
can of worms.

Most re-polished furniture that turns up here, is obvious, if it has
been stripped and polished, as usually, the grain is lying open and
has NOT been properly grain filled. Shows no sign of accumulated dirt
and grim. With stuff like this the polish just sits there glistening
within the grain, absolutely dreadful looking stuff and a million
times worse when lit by sunlight.

Other thing to bear in mind with mid to late Vicky and the Edwardian
stuff, much of this furniture, this side of the pond, has resided in
the one place for a long time, if not its complete life-time before
entering the antique market and/or second-hand market. The late 70s
saw many big estate sales, stuff in absolute tip-top condition coming
onto the open market for the first time, in fact it still happens
here, we still have excellent on-site auctions. It's still out THERE,
Mike, it hasn't all gone away, you know. :)

I note there are a lot of doubting Thomas's amongst the readers, and
&quot;some&quot; of the regulars, ignorance perhaps or simply never ever having
handled or dealt good commercial and/or fine antique furniture may be
the excuse, which is fine and understandable. I think you as restorer
and an informed person should be well aware of the normal condition of
antique furniture this side of the pond, and certainly that of the
Vicky stuff. I think this is down to expectation, this side of the
pond, dealers expect Vicky and semi-modern Edwardian stuff to be in
good condition and the lion's share of it to be original. And,
original not in 'as the day it left the factory' but used, most
especially cared for within it life time. I believe if there were more
British/Irish dealers and collectors (of furniture) on this group, you
would be amazed as to the stuff that many of us, over here, refer to
as &quot;normal&quot; ... in passing I don't know where our Laurie has got to,
but I am sure, Laurie is well aware and exposed to much better and
finer furniture than we peasants in Ireland :)

Finally, good and fine period furniture is a different ball game
altogether, and without going into that in get detail, as I see little
point, much of that has most certainly been, French polished in the
19th century, but as I say, that is a different subject completely. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;Most of the grandma furniture we find like this has been clobbered, painted,

&gt;&gt; this thread were shipping fodder. There would be no money in it if we
&gt;&gt; had to refinished each and every piece before sticking it into the
&gt;&gt; back of a container. Shipper will not ship (at least the ones I dealt
&gt;&gt; with) broken or falling apart furniture, splits and grain cracks are a
&gt;&gt; NO NO, try shipping shite like that from this climate to, Oz or
&gt;&gt; California, it would disintegrate. We shipped shite to Canada, but
&gt;&gt; that was mostly 40s plywood and other semi-modern pieces, condition in
&gt;&gt; this case wasn't important, but never antiques or Vicky stuff in the
&gt;&gt; condition as I've posted here.

&gt;&gt; Are you sure you're not a second-hand dealer, Fayette?

&gt;&gt; OK ... for your pleasure, Fayette, here's a page full of rubbish,
&gt;&gt; unrefined, wrong and wrong, is this more your line? This is daily
&gt;&gt; crude sold onto the trade and junk market, residue, horses for courses
&gt;&gt; and all that, could never ship this or sell to a private over here,
&gt;&gt; not in a month of Sundays.

"/> Hi Ronnie, I agree with most of the points you make regarding the care
and maintenance of old finishes except for what is and is not
refinishing. To refinish, according to my dictionary,:~)) means &quot;adding
a new surface&quot;, every time you wax a piece some of the oxidized top
layer is removed revealing a new surface. Even if you give the surface a
touch with the rubber you lose bits of the original finish and are in
effect refinishing with a new one. You are right that most people regard
refinishing as stripping off the old finish, patina and all down to the
bare wood, but it is possible to completely refinish a piece and leave
the original finish intact without stripping, all that is required is a
proper cleaning of the surface gunge and a recoat with the same type of
finish as the original. Solvent release type finishes like shellac bond
by melting together, the new finish melds with the old at the surface,
the colour and old finish remain intact. Even the grime of ages in the
nooks and crannies remains intact because spirit varnishes like shellac
will seal right over them. I have brought back spirit finishes that had
begun to powder by spraying alcohol over the surface to get it to flow
out and then French polished it with a tinted shellac with wonderful
results. It can be done, but few will spare the time to learn or care
enough to bother over here.

Snip of Mike's ggod points on restoration.

You are right about cleaning the gunge off. Many pieces, I have
'restored' for clients, have just had a **careful** clean with light
furniture restoration creams and then a wax polish. I'll put up a
picture of a Davenport that was so filthy, I did not even know that it
was inlaid, until I cleaned a small patch.

If I have to take off a shellac finish because of damage to the wood
underneath, I always paint back in 'age' rings in dark water-based ink
(for example in the turnings on legs) before re-polishing.

Also, ALWAYS use a sanding sealer after preparing and staining wood
and remember to stain any small dents darker than the surface finish
before sealing. The difference that attention to small details makes,
is huge.

Jon

In the life time of any piece of (antique) furniture which has been
cared for over many, many years the furniture will most certainly have
been (polished) waxed. I would find it impossible to imagine any piece
existing 100+ years that has never been waxed.

In many cases the coat of wax was an annual event, in between, the
piece would have been buffed and dusted everyday. The higher the
status of the house, then both upstairs pieces and downstairs pieces
would have been buffed and dusted daily with the occasionally coat of
furniture wax maybe twice, three times a year, usually the whole house
getting a good top to bottom at least once a year.

If a piece of furniture, Mike, had been locked in a room, from new,
had stayed there for 150+ years, never touched, never dusted, never
waxed, and then exposed to the light of day after all those years,
would it have colour and patina .... would it have a fine antique
surface???

{btw .. without trying to spilt hairs, &quot;refinish&quot; isn't defined in my
OED, or at least I couldn't find a listing, however, &quot;repolish&quot; is,
but then I don't expect &quot;repolish&quot; is listed in an American

"/> Mike, without doubt experts recognize a good original surface, but
it's not as simply as that. Increasingly there is a view that good
natural colour and patination, the result of age and the attention a
piece has received, is desirable. Often colour and patination are
linked together under patina, however, what the furniture collector
values includes colour as well. The problem is that the two are
interrelated.

See how far you go with this. New unpolished wood tends to have
uniformity of colour. The difference between hard areas like knots,
burrs, flecks, hard grains and soft areas of straight grain and
sapwood can be accentuated by adding polish. Linseed was one of the
oils used which sank into the wood in different degrees and, with
added colour, helped accentuate distinctions and thus made the piece
more interesting. Sheraton went so far as to suggest the use of
powered brick dust. The result was polished and often varnished, and
the owner was encouraged to see that a wax polish was applied and
rubbed well in. This kept the piece clean and added to the protective
layer, often accurately referred to by dealers as 'skin', which in
turn oxidised.

However, this hard, impervious, protective layer served another
function. The bleaching effect of strong light gradually wastes out
the colouring in the gain, producing different shades, and varies with
the type of wood. The oil being applied in new polishing cannot
permeate the patina (the gloss produced by age) so the bleaching
effect continues slowly and at different rates on the surface.

The result produced is often varying shades of colour which it is next
to impossible for the faker or restorer to simulate. This is why a
surface which carries an undisturbed and uniform colour suggests
repolishing, which may have been carried out to facilitate a
customer's requirement or hide some alterations, or both.

that's why I like his ideas so much. :)

So I can't resist in quoting.

In 1878 he stated .......

&gt; Mike, without doubt experts recognize a good original surface, but
&gt; it's not as simply as that. Increasingly there is a view that good
&gt; natural colour and patination, the result of age and the attention a
&gt; piece has received, is desirable. Often colour and patination are
&gt; linked together under patina, however, what the furniture collector
&gt; values includes colour as well. The problem is that the two are
&gt; interrelated.

"/> Ronnie the finishes I'm talking about are not the well tended ,warm ,
muted ones we like to see on period furniture, but finishes that have
obviously been recoated with more modern materials some 50 to 80 years
ago and exhibit crazing indicative of such materials. It has got to the
point here that 150 year old painted country pieces are left in the
rough with their eighty year old peeling paint on because &quot;it's
original&quot;, formal pieces refinished in the 1950's exhibit just enough
wear to pass in a lot of shops as &quot;original&quot; and the public eats it up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; See how far you go with this. New unpolished wood tends to have
&gt; uniformity of colour. The difference between hard areas like knots,
&gt; burrs, flecks, hard grains and soft areas of straight grain and
&gt; sapwood can be accentuated by adding polish.

"/> The old boys ran into most of the same problems craftsmen do today, most
wood types require dyes to make the colour uniform from one board to the
next, today we use dyes dissolved in a number of solvents for quick
drying. 18th century and early 19th century craftsmen used a variety of
vegetable dyes to get the colour they wanted, Alkanet root mixed with
oil produced a strong red colour, barberry root makes a good yellow,
logwood could be used with a variety of mordants to produce, red , brown
, black or blue colours. The old boys had many more dye &amp; stain sources
used to bring out the grain in figured veneers or match sapwood to
heartwood ,but they all were subject to fading.

Linseed was one of the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; oils used which sank into the wood in different degrees and, with
&gt; added colour, helped accentuate distinctions and thus made the piece
&gt; more interesting. Sheraton went so far as to suggest the use of
&gt; powered brick dust. The result was polished and often varnished, and
&gt; the owner was encouraged to see that a wax polish was applied and
&gt; rubbed well in. This kept the piece clean and added to the protective
&gt; layer, often accurately referred to by dealers as 'skin', which in
&gt; turn oxidised.

"/> The brick dust mixed with oil works well as an abrasive /filler, the
French used pumice in place of brick dust ( I still do) the dust
polishes the surface by levelling the surface,the slurry of wood dust
,brick dust and oil fills the grain, sometime a dye would be added to
even the colour. Linseed oil has the advantage over most surface
finishes as it actually penetrates the surface of the wood to some
degree, but still ,like you say, requires regular maintenance by waxing
or recoating.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; However, this hard, impervious, protective layer served another
&gt; function. The bleaching effect of strong light gradually wastes out
&gt; the colouring in the gain, producing different shades, and varies with
&gt; the type of wood. The oil being applied in new polishing cannot
&gt; permeate the patina (the gloss produced by age) so the bleaching
&gt; effect continues slowly and at different rates on the surface.

"/> Well yes and no, if the finish is degraded or worn oil will penetrate
and change the colour, most conservators no longer recommend the use of
linseed oil as a polish because of it's tendency to darken finishes and
collect dust.
The bleaching effect ,as you say, does carry on no matter what finish
you use, even the most modern finish with UV retardants are only good
for about 3 years.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The result produced is often varying shades of colour which it is next
&gt; to impossible for the faker or restorer to simulate. This is why a
&gt; surface which carries an undisturbed and uniform colour suggests
&gt; repolishing, which may have been carried out to facilitate a
&gt; customer's requirement or hide some alterations, or both.

"/> I agree 100% on this point, with the scientific equipment available
today even a Lovejoy would be found out, but I could tell you some
stories :~))

Be careful how you speak of the Keno Brothers around here, Mike! Those
brothers are the highlight of the show for a lot of us gals. &lt;g&gt;

The reason they'll quote $250,000 for a highboy with original finish
(and $25,000 for a refinished one) is simple. There are enough American
buyers out there that are willing to pay that kind of dough for a piece
nearly black from a couple of centuries of grime.

Sometimes the piece had been ebonized originally, and the new owners
wanted the look of the original wood (not what the maker had intended).
So they strip off the black finish and all patina, it looks great to the
new owners, and they think it's crazy to want that old black finish, and
are dumbfounded when they find out it's lost 90% of its value.

But it boils down to the fact that there are buyers who are willing to
pay 10 times as much for a 200 year old piece that has its original
finish.

It's not the Keno Bros. fault!

Have fun, Michele

"/> Right after that episode aired, a woman came into the mall with a drawer
from a rather ordinary late 19th century dresser (to the front of which
someone had affixed cowboy decals ca. 1940s) and told me that its crackling
black finish was just what the collectors were looking for. Three days
later I saw the re-broadcast, and figured out why she wanted $250,000 for
her dresser. ;-)

Ronnie, not everyone likes things &quot;in the black&quot; as they call it, but
enough do. Some of the &quot;black&quot; is the ebonized finish I spoke of in the
message, sometimes it's 200 years of patina'd finish.

I must add that the piece has to be desirable for other reasons too. I
can't remember if the $250K piece I saw was a Connecticut or
Philadelphia highboy, but it was a gorgeous piece (even refinished)...
mid-to-late 18th century. I couldn't find that one on their site, but
here's another one (in the form of Appraise it Yourself quiz):

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/roadshow/game10/chestintro.html

And follow the links to test yourself! It's not nearly as nice as the
one that would have been worth $250K, this one should have been $100K,
but because it was refinished, was only worth $15K.

If you want to test yourself on other items, there's a drop down list
here:

"/> That's what I was trying to get across in the earlier posts Ronnie, some
of these pieces have finishes that have alligatored so badly, little of
the original colour comes through at all. Even conservators recommend
that finishes in this condition cannot be saved and should be removed ,
it really is a big con job perpetuated by the big houses to rob people
with more money than they know what to do with. Short of chemical
analysis there is no way these clowns can prove the finish is original
or a refinishing job done in 1880.

"/> There is a difficult issue here. Some pre and early Victorian
furniture was ebonised during Queen Victoria's long period of
mourning...and **this** was not what the maker intended.

Usually the ebonising is done over the original finish and it is quite
possible to restore the Victorian damage. You have to recognise that
the piece has been ebonised at a later date, and work on a very small
insignificant area looking for finishes underneath and quality of the
carcass timber.

Ronnie, the finish was why it wasn't worth 10 times as much! Originally,
it's been grained, then painted in red to simulate mahogany.. the wood
itself was never supposed to show! There's a pic later in the quiz that
shows the original paint on the bottom side of the feet (click on the
small pic to see a larger one).

As to the dovetails... I agree, nothing special. But I have seen some
wonderful work, I believe done in the 1870's, where the dovetails are
scalloped.

This was not the best piece of American furniture by any stretch of the
imagination, it just happened to be the only piece on their website that
had the reduced value due to refinishing.

If you recall, a few of us have discussed a card table that was
appraised at $200K to $250K, which when it finally went to auction
brought almost $500K ($480K if I recall). Anyway, here it is:

&gt; No wonder so many of you people are ..... confused.

&gt; Mike, Jon ... did ya catch the puzzle.

&gt; Right ..... it's a bleached-out thing, dirty looking, with a finish as
&gt; dead as a pancake .... TWO pcs Highboy, and the question

&gt; ============
&gt;&quot;What is the best way to determine if the chest's top and bottom were
&gt; originally together?

&gt; take a close look at the hardware on the drawers
&gt; check to see if the cabinetmaker's signature, usually found underneath
&gt; each piece, matches check drawers' dovetails &quot;
&gt; ===========

&gt; Answer .... check the drawers DOVETAILS!!! ...... now it shows a
&gt; picture of the dovetails joint .. MY GOD!!!!!! what an ugly dovetail,
&gt; one of those big things, hand cut?? naw looks foot-cut .. whose this
&gt; Karen person anyway, has she never heard of BACKBOARDS??

&gt; I pity you, Mike ..... come on home, son, back to your loved one. :))

&gt; Elaine, I think Eastlake was an arrogant little toe-rag, perhaps

The dame isn't &quot;over-reacting,&quot; she just found out the table she paid
$25 for was worth over $200K - wouldn't you jump up an down too if you
made a find like that! &lt;big grin&gt;

The larger pic doesn't show much detail. As I recall, it had beautiful
inlays, and other than a light cleaning when she got it, and some polish
over the years, the original finish has remained intact.

And stop making fun of my kitchen cabinet... it's cute and I like it,
and it's not sponged - so there! &lt;sticking my tongue out at you&gt;

Have fun, Michele

I guess if I'd thought it through, I'd have realized the scalloped
dovetails were so perfect (in relation to each other), they would have
had to been machined. It's a shame they stopped, they added a nice
finished touch to an inside part of a dresser.

Ronnie, in the Anglo-Japanese drawings, bottom right... does that say
coffee table or coffers table? If coffers, what the heck is a coffers
table?

Some of his designs are quite modern, even by today's standards. The
chairs look kind of cool - are they also comfortable?

This picture a pair of coffee tables by unidentified makers, c1880,

by the Art Furniture Company, c1877 a company that Godwin worked
closely with.

http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~mckinley/temp/watt_coffee_table.jpg

btw ... in the htm page, second row, the cabinet on the left (godwin5)
called the 'Butterfly Cabinet' the decoration was painted by J. A.
McNeill Whistler... exhibited Universal Exhibition, Paris 1878 on the
William Watt stand.

The leather chair, next to the cabinet, that is American, designed by
H.H. Richardson c1878, probably for the Public Library, Wodburn,
Massachusetts. Directly related to Godwin's design of a chair for the
Paris exhibition, 1878. The chair is now held at the Houghton Library,
Harvard University. Do you not recall it. :-))

You need to bear in mind these are concept pieces, most are from
sketch pads, and pieces for exhibit, his own furniture, and stuff he
designed for McNeill Whistler and Wilde for private use in their own
homes.

All the real pieces I've posted DID survive, we are talking the 1860s
and 1870s here, good god, try and get a handle on this. It's a
reaction against the repro shite of the mid Victorian era. How in the
name of heavens is the last picture in the htm page ANYTHING like
Victorian fussiness??? .... the design draws direct influence from
the Japanese. This is the height of the Art and Aesthetic Movement and
regarded by his contemporaries as one of the leaders of the movement.

modern looking (though I do prefer several others- it seems very &quot;busy&quot;). I'm
definitly going to note his name, for future reading-up. It seems as much fun to me

Definately the wardrobe would be a keeper, and I like the chair with the &quot;wheel&quot; side

This one &quot;Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket&quot;, 1875 led to
the famous law suit between him and John Ruskin. When Ruskin declared:

&quot;I have seen, and heard, much of cockney impudence before now; but
never expected to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for
flinging a pot of paint in the public's face.&quot;

Whistler immediately took up the challenge, issuing a lawsuit for
libel, his intention was not only to defend his artistic reputation,
but to use the trial as a forum for a debate on the nature of art
itself.

Ruskin's defense asked in contempt: &quot;The labor of two days is that for
which you ask two hundred guineas?&quot; Whistler responded: &quot;No. I ask it
for the knowledge I have gained in the work of a lifetime.&quot;

Although Whistler was victorious in the trial, he was awarded only a
farthing, the least valuable coin of the realm at the time. The need
to pay substantial costs resulted in his bankruptcy in 1879, and he
was forced to move out of his charming home, the White House in
Chelsea. He went to Venice with his mistress, Maud Franklin.

After his return from Venice, where he had remained for 14 months he
once again became a great figure in London life. In 1888 he married
Beatrix Godwin, when Beatrix Whistler died in 1896, Whistler was
deeply upset, and his final years were sad. Although he kept in touch
with his contemporaries and ran an art school in Paris, his productive
period was over.

That John Ruskin was a bit of a prat sometimes ... eh wot??

I don't want to interrupt this showing, but at some point could somebody
explain &quot;ebonised&quot;? What is the process?
Thanks, Tina

&gt; Coffee table, Michele. just that fancy &quot;Art&quot; script favoured by the

&gt; This picture a pair of coffee tables by unidentified makers, c1880,

&gt; This one, ebonised, originally designed in 1867 and subsequently made

&gt; closely with.

&gt; btw ... in the htm page, second row, the cabinet on the left (godwin5)
&gt; called the 'Butterfly Cabinet' the decoration was painted by J. A.
&gt; McNeill Whistler... exhibited Universal Exhibition, Paris 1878 on the
&gt; William Watt stand.

&gt; The leather chair, next to the cabinet, that is American, designed by
&gt; H.H. Richardson c1878, probably for the Public Library, Wodburn,
&gt; Massachusetts. Directly related to Godwin's design of a chair for the

Ebonized simply means wood that has been stained black and then polished to
resemble the wood ebony.

I thought those were YOUR buffalo chairs. I will try to get a
picture of a genuine steer-horn framed, cow-hide covered 1880s
small sofa for you to admire. It's quite eye-catching, and makes
good use of the otherwise inedible parts of a bovine. Rather

Whistler worked for the Coast and Geodetic Survey (now NOAA)
for a while, early in his career, as an engraver ofnautical
charts. They fired him because he was continually elaborating on
the &quot;harbor approach&quot; scenes that maps had then. What should
have been a rendition of the entry to a harbour from the point of
view of a ship in the correct channel would end up with seagulls,
children on the shore, houses, and clouds.
NOAA still has the plates he did, and it's a traditional
retirement gift: a Whistler etching.

I don't really believe there's that much difference between the
British art buyer and the American art buyer, that a few billion
pounds wouldn't sort out.

Museums over here are strapped for cash, even although they get
finance help from the Lottery fund, but are still up against the Paul
Getty types of this world.

But I am sure the British art buyers are pleased for the good folk of
Detroit, afterall, Whistler was a Yank, so it's fitting *some* of his
work should reside in the American museums, don't you think.? :)

Nope, love those clean lines but not fond of the really &quot;moderne&quot;
looking piece that was at the bottom of one page....stark and looked
hard to live with. Pictures of the rooms with furniture like that piece
look like nobody ever sits down, or ever owns a pet, or ever takes their
shoes off. I don't want to have to live up to my furniture.

Yup, furniture should do what's it's designed to do - normally it holds
something (a person, linens, china, etc), and do it well. And it should
look good doing it, and it should be made to last.

Guess I agree with Godwin!

Have fun, Michele

I'm one of those &quot;form follows function&quot; types... a chair should look
like a chair, and look nice while I'm snoozing comfortably in it. &lt;grin&gt;

Art for art's sake is why you hang a picture on a wall, or fill a vase
artistically with flowers. I don't want to sit in a piece of art. &lt;g&gt;
