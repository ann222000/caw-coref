The Irish Oikophobes Fly Under the Radar at Notre Dame

by Dymphna

Did you know that the University of Notre Dame in South Bend just
concluded a week-long symposium on the &quot;new&quot; Ireland? I didn't either.
When a reader sent me some information I was unable to find anything
substantive on the web (I don't think the Irish Daily Mail has a
website, but if you know of one, I'd be happy to hear about it).

However, what I have instead is still the real thing, minus a URL. Our
reader contacted Dr. Mark Dooley, who was kind enough to send me his
editorial.

I am reprinting here in its entirety. Dr. Dooley demonstrates only too
well the creeping Marxist rot that plagues academia in the West. I am
sad that Ireland has succumbed, but then why should it be exempt from
this moral decay? I know the trendy academics like to talk about
&quot;deconstructing the text&quot; but all they're really doing is destroying
literature and history and philosophy...

Their work is a kind of decomposition; perhaps when it is entirely
done, we can spread the resulting manure on the green, green grass of
home.

&quot;WHY THE IRISH LEFT WILL GO AS FAR AS AMERICA TO RUIN A WAY OF LIFE
HERE&quot;

By DR. MARK DOOLEY
IRISH DAILY MAIL
October 16, 2007

How would you react if I told you there is a conference entitled: Race
and Immigration in the New Ireland, currently being staged at the
University of Notre Dame in Indiana? I suspect it wouldn't bother you
too much, would it?

Well, perhaps this might change your mind. The sub-title of the event
is: The world accepted the Irish. Will the Irish accept the world?

It is being addressed by Ireland's former President Mary Robinson, the
Minister for Integration, Conor Lenihan, and an array of radical left-
wingers from academia, the trade union movement and the immigration
industry.

Have I got your attention now?

Joining our esteemed former President in Indiana, is David Begg of the
Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Philip Watt of the National
Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, and the
Secretary of the Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland, Ali Selim. Yes,
that is the same Ali Selim who last year declared that 'Sharia law
should rule in Ireland in the event of a Muslim majority'.

The conference is, moreover, packed with postcolonial, pseudo-Marxist
professors from all the major Irish universities. It is being
organised by the Professor of Irish Studies at Notre Dame, Luke
Gibbons. Gibbons, a former lecturer at Dublin City University, is a
fanatical postmodernist who thinks that Irish identity can and must be
debunked.

Apart from Conor Lenihan, there is not a single person on the list of
speakers who has cautioned against unlimited immigration into Ireland.

Why wasn't someone on the other side of the argument asked to give a
paper? I for one would have been happy to make the case. As both a
journalist and academic, I have repeatedly dealt with the issue of
immigration in depth. The reason is simple: I don't believe Ireland
either can or should 'accept the world'.

Furthermore, why is a conference on race and immigration in Ireland,
being conducted in the United States? Once again, the answer is
crystal clear: the organisers knew that holding it in Ireland would
invite unwelcome attention. [emphasis mine - D]

Voices like mine, as well as those of writers such as Kevin Myers and
Mary Ellen Synon, would have demanded balance and serious debate. But
in the States, they are shamelessly free to indulge their
multicultural delusions without criticism or condemnation.

What this proves, is that Irish academia is in complete denial about
the problems we face due to uncontrolled immigration. It shows that on
this vital issue, they are intellectually redundant and morally
vacuous. It highlights yet again what I have often said in these
pages: Irish universities have been hijacked by a bunch of left-wing
ideologues, for whom national loyalty is a cardinal sin. Like those on
the Titanic, they prefer to party on while the ship slowly sinks.

Yes, the liberal establishment has declared war on the old values that
formerly bound the Irish together. They sneer at those ordinary folk
who remain faithful to their traditional customs. But have they
considered, even for one second, the damage done to working-class
communities by our lousy immigration policies? Have they ever asked
what will become of this nation if tough integration models are not
imposed?
- - - - - - - - -
No, they have not. Why? Because they couldn't care less. You see, for
ideologues like Luke Gibbons, the world is neatly divided between the
oppressed and the oppressors.

And who, pray tell, are the oppressors? Are they tyrants like Robert
Mugabe, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Colonel Gaddafi? Oh no, according to
academic Marxists, such scum are victims of colonial oppression, who
bravely liberated their citizens from Western imperialism.

For them, the real oppressors are the great bourgeois democracies of
the Western world. Why? Because it is they who invaded and plundered
all the rest. The result? We in the West are morally obliged to give
unconditional sanctuary to those who show up on our shores.

Utter nonsense. First, post-colonial powers like France and Britain do
indeed owe something to their former colonies. But we don't owe the
world anything. Contrary to what those in Indiana contend, the world
did not accept the Irish. Britain and America accepted our emigrants,
and in return we constructed their cities and seamlessly integrated
into their societies.

But we did not go in droves to Africa, the Middle East or Asia. Yes,
our missionaries travelled to Africa to educate the destitute and
relieve their suffering. But the Irish never sought sanctuary in such
places.

So here it is in plain English: Ireland owes Africa nothing. Ireland
owes Arabia nothing. Ireland owes Asia nothing.

Why then are we being called on to 'accept the world'? True, we are
obliged to share this state with our neighbours from Eastern Europe.
That, however, is where our obligations stop.

But that is not how the postcolonial professor sees it. For him, a
nation's identity is a bourgeois fiction sustained by the ruling
elite. As such, it must be unravelled until its false foundations are
fatally exposed.

I agree that the idea of a pure Irish identity is a monstrous
fabrication. But we are nevertheless bound together by common norms
and customs. We are inextricably tied together through a shared
history and heritage. We are, in sum, bound by a deep love for this
place we call 'home'.

Those who demand that we unconditionally 'accept the world', are what
one philosopher calls 'oikophobes'. 'Oik' is the Greek word for 'home'
or 'dwelling'. Hence, oikophobia, in contrast to xenophobia, means
'the repudiation of inheritance or home'.

As George Orwell observed, left-wing intellectuals 'take their cookery
from Paris and their opinions from Moscow'. In other words, they
despise their homeland, their common culture and traditions. As such,
they are the quintessential oikophobes, whose principal aim is to
'reinvent Ireland'.

Well, I have news for them: the ordinary people of Ireland will not be
reinvented or deconstructed. Yes, the Irish are naturally a charitable
people, and will grant hospitality to those that genuinely need it.
But, in the end, this is their home, and they have no intention of
casually surrendering it to any chancer who comes calling.

When will Irish intellectuals and their political cheerleaders get
that message? When will they cease using immigration as a weapon to
beat those of us who cherish what is our birthright? When will they
stop trying to destroy this country with their mad ideology?

Never. Why? Because for them, creating a 'new Ireland' is an article
of faith. And if that means trampling over the sensitivities of the
silent majority, then so be it.

So no, those currently assembled in Indiana are not morally serious
intellectuals. They are, in the words of Orwell, 'purely negative
creatures' who assume, 'as though it were a law of nature, the divorce
between patriotism and intelligence'.

Had they invited someone with a different view to their shameful
shindig, it would not have taken long to disabuse them of that
ridiculous assumption. But they didn't, which is why they now stand
condemned as nothing more than condescending cowards.

Who sneak out of the country to have their meetings.

Don't forget Notre Dame is the school which made a place for Tariq
Ramadan to teach. Fortunately, his visa was denied so he had to settle
for London instead. -- D.
