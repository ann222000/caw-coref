Other than ruggedness and ease of repair, what advantages does point-
to-point wiring have in an amp?

I hear a lot of people say it SOUNDS better. How do electrons
traveling through a wire sound any better than electrons traveling
through a circuit board? Since circuit boards are laid out to get
components as close together as possible, with as little wasted space
as possible, it seems that they have a potential to sound better,
since the signal has to travel less distance between parts.

Or is it just a case of &quot;Leo Fender did it that way, so that's how it
should be done&quot;?

Anyone?

&quot;ruggedness and ease of repair&quot;..........are the main reasons. They are
also very easy to tweak to get the final sound you want. As long as the
transformers are good, they are, at least for me, very easy to fix.

BTW, putting signal paths as close together as possible is not really
a good thing.

Well first off there are pcb amps that sound and are built just as good as
ptp amps and they cost just as much too. The problem with some amps is too
much processing within the circuit and or bad layout, filtering etc... The
mark of a great amp is one which doesn't take away the true tone and nuances
of your guitar and playing wile still coloring your sound in a pleasing way.
One way to do that is by allowing the signal to pass through the least
amount of circuitry and most ptp amps are that way. Plus most ptp amps are
built on the platform of what most of us feel is the epitome of tone with
all the classic guitar sounds deriving from those circuits and most pcb amps
don't quite cut it but a few do such a Mesa and Marshalls etc.. Another
benefit of buying a ptp amp from a good tech or builder is you have the
ability to get what you want tone wise when you bring in your vintage amp or
have one built. But yes it's possible to build a pcb amp with the same
characteristics but most skimp on the boards quality layout and components.

None really.. The main problem with circuit boards is not the circuit
boards. It's all the plastic crap that goes along with many newer
circuit boarded amps. Also the construction practices..
IE: attaching cheap plastic jacks directly to circuit boards, etc.
Myself, I could care less if the main board is a circuit board, as
long as it was not built cheap using cheap plastic junk attached
directly to the board.
To me, there is no real difference in repairing one as far as the
circuit board vs a tag board, or PTP..
Actually, I'm more used to circuit boards cuz most of everything I
work on uses circuit boards. IE: ham radios, TV's , puter monitors,
etc, ad pukium..
Heck fire, I used to actually make circuit boards at a large company
in a past life. I've made circuit boards for everything from digital
wrist watches, to huge medical and oil field equipment to some
boards for NASA.  Do you think if circuit boards were really a
problem, that NASA would use them? I doubt it.. They are ultra
anal.. They used to send MIB spies around the shop to make
sure our quality was up to snuff.
To me, circuit boards are no harder to repair than PTP.
Just wait till you start seeing amps with surface mount technology.
I'm sure some of the latest gadjets and FX are already using
surface mount. Nearly all modern electronics have been using
surface mount for quite a few years.. I can work on those as well.
All in all, it doesn't matter to me as long as it's done right.

Probably not, but I'm not sure what differences would be in a
standard board, and a mil spec version.. Probably more with
the inspection of the board more than anything.
The company I worked for did very high quality work, and did a
lot of inspection between the various stages of making the
board. That's why they got all the big name contracts for boards.
The rep for quality.. So I would almost consider what we made as
&quot;mil spec&quot; being they had so many inspections.
We did a lot of NASA work, and if that ain't mil spec, I don't
know what is.. Those guys are anal..
I did a lot of inspection myself, when I wasn't working the other
lines.
IE: my actual job was to receive the boards after the CRC hole
drilling, and then I inpected the holes for flaws, and fix if needed.
Then I sanded the boards in prep for the electroless copper line.
After I ran them through the line, I'd stack em in trays for
inspection
of my process. So almost every stage was inspected after the
particular work was done. BTW, this was often when the NASA
MIB would show up to do their own inspection, as they knew
when what boards were in whatever stage at the time.
But when I got through with my particular lines and had nothing to
do, they would send me up front to do inspection. Most of these
were girls.. I actually kind of liked inspection, as I would rather
sit in a room with a bunch of jibber jabbery girls, rather than the
nasty copper line. But it's tedious, as you sit in front of a big
lit loop, and you have to inspect every single hole, trace, etc..
On the big boards, this took a while.. On a digi watch board,
not too long.. They were the size of a large coin.
I worked with various acids, formaldehyde in the copper solution
which was heated and blew nasty fumes, etc.. Really nasty.
It would turn my skin green from the copper dust and chemicals
which would build up and then corrode green.
I also did some of the etching processes from time to time.
The stripper which was used to take the film off was so strong
that just a speck landing on your skin would start to burn after
a few minutes. Nasty fumes too..
Making printed circuit boards is some nasty work unless all
you do is inspect all day.
Anyway, to me, a board is a board. Thickness would probably
matter more than anything if they attach parts directly to it.
You don't want a board to flex all the time.
So if I built a board for a geetar amp, it would be pretty thick,
just to make it strong and less likely to have trouble.
I'd make it so thick it would not flex at all. That way when
people change tubes, plug jacks in and out, etc, there will
be no flexing of the board, which can lead to trace cracks,
etc.. But actually, if I built a circuit board amp for real,
there would be *nothing* attached to the PCB that would
lead to stress in the first place. I would use a metal chassis,
which all stressful parts would be mounted on.

I dunno about *mil spec*, but they are fiberglas instead of the
phenolic boards many other mfgrs use, including Fender. But Carvin may
be using cheap boards now too.....haven't been inside any of the newer

The fiber eyelet boards Leo used weren't all that reliable. They would
flex and pull apart components, absorb moisture and develop all sorts of
strange problems. They are easy to fix in that you don't have to get at
the back side of the board.

I'm starting to wonder if the shrinking size of discrete resistors and
caps will eventually become a problem. There have been rumors about
Sprague discontinuing certain caps and recommending that new products
not be designed for them.

Question I've always wanted to ask - What are through-plated holes and
how hard are they to produce? Could a minimal PC board be designed to
take the place of eyelet boards in a point to point design? For example
in a classic Fender circuit it would have traces for the cross board
power distribution, probably some ground traces, but just basically a
bunch of large through-plated holes and pads for mounting components and
wires from the top?

Guys theres a bunch of differences. It aint my day to school you. You
wouldnt listen anyway.  Most of you guys have grown up in the age of
disposable everything. I'm not putting you down because a person cant choose
when they are going to be born. I really dont think most of you even have a
clue. You've never seen anything that was built well. Levis aint what they
used to be.Pennys Tshirts are a joke.Amps,TV's,Stereos any damned thing that
you want to mention. Every Main Street across the US  used to have at least
one fix it shop if not 10. You wont see any now because nothings worth
fixing. Circuit board amps are disposable. I dont think there was such a
thing as a disposable anything when I was a kid. Born in 57. A fu---ng
toaster could last two life times if no body jammed a butter knife into it
while it was cooking and started digging around like a gopher with
hydrophobia.
Ignorant doesnt mean you're stupid  and thats good because  you old boys
are damned well ignorant.

If they mess up a PTP amp you buy, one recovery path is the local amp
guy. If they mess up a PCB amp you buy, the only real choice is
RMR through the manufacturer, unless you have access to the tools.

With SMT and what not, &quot;the tools&quot; get expensive fast, and if you don't
do that sort of work daily, it's hard to stay in practice. If it's
throughhole, it's not as bad. PCB amps also may develop sensitivities
to vibration that are hard to diagnose.

No. Actually being close together introduces white noise.
And with voltage  amplifiers ( as preamps are ) .. inductance
is a sure noise hazard.

Look at the wiring at the HiWatt ... Parallel and 90 degree
wires. Short lead too.

Leo used fiber boards ... strong cardboard with metal eyelets. Go look

&gt;&gt; Only thing I could see is that they'd be easier to modify.  If yer
&gt;&gt; into that sort of thing...

&gt; If they mess up a PTP amp you buy, one recovery path is the local amp
&gt; guy. If they mess up a PCB amp you buy, the only real choice is
&gt; RMR through the manufacturer, unless you have access to the tools.

&gt; With SMT and what not, &quot;the tools&quot; get expensive fast, and if you don't
&gt; do that sort of work daily, it's hard to stay in practice. If it's
&gt; throughhole, it's not as bad. PCB amps also may develop sensitivities
&gt; to vibration that are hard to diagnose.

Yep, I calculate anything I buy has a lifespan of max 5 years in
consumer electronics. In, say 15 past years I've gone thru 3 CD
players, 3 car players, 2 DVD players, 3 VCR's, 3 TV's, half a dozen
computer monitors, not even to mention all other stuff like
refridgerators and freezers, washing machines, water units, digicams,
MP3 players, whatever. Anything that lasts over 5 years and still
isn't obsolete is a small miracle these days.

Household machines are a little better but not by much. Maybe 10 yrs
operational time. Every bloody year I have to buy 4-5 new gadgets or
household items to replace broken ones. In the last 20 yrs I've
replaced every single household appliance from dishwasher to whatever,
and I suspect the cycle is about to start anew....one freezer is
already on its last limb now.

All the audio gear I bought in the 80's is well past its prime except
for speakers and music gear; however I have some stuff like a recorder
from the 60's that still works great and old cameras and whatnot. Just
the other day I noticed my digicam got to be 5 years old and lo and
behold now it suddenly only works for like 10 minutes before an all-
new battery is exhausted. Just the way it goes.

Depends. Usually whenever I've bought cheap VCRs or whatever, they've
been really lacking in features, worked slow or just plain annoying -
hard to aim the remote or whatever.

The last time I 'saved' some money I bought a cheap Sony DVD to
replace a 4-yr old Thompson that died...it drives me nuts that it
takes like 10 seconds to stop and open the bloody tray. And it won't
play divx or anything...really shitty in-play menu and whatever. A
friend bought an almost similar one but a notch higher in model range
and that works like a dream in comparison.

But music gear in general...seems to be really well built. My Marshall
and BOSS FX unit are like 20 years old already and they work just like
new, no detectable problems anywhere.

Dee

&gt;Well first off there are pcb amps that sound and are built just as good as
&gt;ptp amps and they cost just as much too. The problem with some amps is too
&gt;much processing within the circuit and or bad layout, filtering etc... The
&gt;mark of a great amp is one which doesn't take away the true tone and nuances
&gt;of your guitar and playing wile still coloring your sound in a pleasing way.
&gt;One way to do that is by allowing the signal to pass through the least
&gt;amount of circuitry and most ptp amps are that way. Plus most ptp amps are
&gt;built on the platform of what most of us feel is the epitome of tone with
&gt;all the classic guitar sounds deriving from those circuits and most pcb amps
&gt;don't quite cut it but a few do such a Mesa and Marshalls etc.. Another
&gt;benefit of buying a ptp amp from a good tech or builder is you have the
&gt;ability to get what you want tone wise when you bring in your vintage amp or
&gt;have one built. But yes it's possible to build a pcb amp with the same
&gt;characteristics but most skimp on the boards quality layout and components.

&gt;None really.. The main problem with circuit boards is not the circuit
&gt;boards. It's all the plastic crap that goes along with many newer
&gt;circuit boarded amps. Also the construction practices..
&gt;IE: attaching cheap plastic jacks directly to circuit boards, etc.
&gt;Myself, I could care less if the main board is a circuit board, as
&gt;long as it was not built cheap using cheap plastic junk attached
&gt;directly to the board.
&gt;To me, there is no real difference in repairing one as far as the
&gt;circuit board vs a tag board, or PTP..
&gt;Actually, I'm more used to circuit boards cuz most of everything I
&gt;work on uses circuit boards. IE: ham radios, TV's , puter monitors,
&gt;etc, ad pukium..
&gt;Heck fire, I used to actually make circuit boards at a large company
&gt;in a past life. I've made circuit boards for everything from digital
&gt;wrist watches, to huge medical and oil field equipment to some
&gt;boards for NASA.  Do you think if circuit boards were really a
&gt;problem, that NASA would use them? I doubt it.. They are ultra
&gt;anal.. They used to send MIB spies around the shop to make
&gt;sure our quality was up to snuff.
&gt;To me, circuit boards are no harder to repair than PTP.
&gt;Just wait till you start seeing amps with surface mount technology.
&gt;I'm sure some of the latest gadjets and FX are already using
&gt;surface mount. Nearly all modern electronics have been using
&gt;surface mount for quite a few years.. I can work on those as well.
&gt;All in all, it doesn't matter to me as long as it's done right.

I agree with the premise that the average quality of consumer goods has
steadily decreased over the last 50+ years.  When our toaster was going
bad, I just happened to be in a second hand shop (searching for tube
gear, no doubt) and bought a collectable old toaster that still works
like a charm!  I have no doubt that it will outlast me.

But when it comes to amps, I don't consider Keith an expert.  He never
responded to a thread about circuit boards in Marshalls (very few exist
without them, contrary to what he inferred in the thread).  Lots of
great amps have circuit boards.  Lots of &quot;iffy&quot; amps of yesteryear are
point to point.  THERE IS NO MAGIC in point to point, or
turret/fishboard/terminal strip construction.

The design form of a circuit board is NOT THE PROBLEM.  It's the
specific layout and quality of the board that's the issue!  Bad layout
can mean noise or even weird parasitics.  But that's not CAUSED by the
board, it's caused by bad engineering.  There are properly designed
boards that sound GREAT.  And they're also reliable.  Poorly designed
boards won't sound great.  Just like poor layout on a point to point amp
won't sound great!

Thin boards won't be as reliable.  But my biggest pet peeve is the board
mounted jacks and pots.  That's just begging for a mechanical failure.
I've seen it in my own gear.  And I've had portable CD players (source
in my cars) tear the trace right off of the board at the board mounted
jacks.

I did experience one board failure, just in the last couple of days.  I
am not easy on remote controls.  They get left on the couch.  Sat on by
my Doberman.  Knocked off the couch...  When the remote for my Luxman
R-117 stopped working, I pulled it apart (after checking batteries).
The lens broke off a long time ago.  Because of that, there's some flex
when you sit on it.  The board failed at a point of physical stress.
Two minutes later, it was back in service (jumped the broken trace).

Anybody know where I can find a point to point remote control for a
Luxman R-117?  Yeah, I'm joking, but also pointing out the fact that we
couldn't have 99% of today's electronics without circuit boards!

And I think somebody already pointed out that circuit board design got a
boost from the military.  You don't think early missiles had point to
point, terminal strip or turret boards, do you???  Talk about stress and
the need for reliability!

Somewhere, I still have the receipt for my first VCR.  It was a two
piece (tuner/recorder) battery operated portable unit, circa 1981.  Over
$1,000, and that was mail order!  How much is that in today's money?
How many weeks of work for the average worker in 1981?

Today, you can get a DVD player for $29.  You can get a DVD RAM video
recorder for not that much more.  We're spoiled by DIRT CHEAP
electronics that do not justify repair.  You can almost always buy a
working used unit cheaper.  Often a NEW unit is cheaper than repair!

I hear you loud and clear!

I recently repaired a high end Mitsubishi Super VHS unit (with the
jog/shuttle type of remote that I prefer).  I now have two working high
end editing units, and a dead one for parts.  I'm still doing analog
video, with a S-VHS-C camera.  For some reason, editing frame by frame
with two remotes feels more natural than going digital.  But the next
time something breaks?  I'll probably go digital.  S-VHS tapes are even
getting hard to find.  And now that I have HDTV, I'd be able to
appreciate more lines of resolution.  S-VHS kept up with prior broadcast
quality, looks as good as many DVDs, but has finally run its time.

Damn, I'm starting to sound like my grandfather, who had to walk seven
miles to school in the snow.  Up hill.  Both ways.

&quot;They don't build 'em like they use to.&quot;

I recently replaced my 20 year old Sony XBR TV (top of the line, over
$1,000 in the mid 80's) with a barely used 32&quot; LCD HDTV with 1080i and
HDMI.  I paid under $400 for the used LCD, with the original receipt and
over a year and a half on the transferable warranty!  KILLER craigslist
find, but will it be working in 20 years???

Our clothes dryer?  Just replaced it after 25 years.  The washer lasted
over 23 years.  The new ones are nice, front load washer, stacking
dryer, energy efficient, yada yada yada...  (Improvements in technology)
But I *do not* expect to get 20+ years of operation out of the new units.

&gt; All the audio gear I bought in the 80's is well past its prime except
&gt; for speakers and music gear; however I have some stuff like a recorder
&gt; from the 60's that still works great and old cameras and whatnot. Just
&gt; the other day I noticed my digicam got to be 5 years old and lo and
&gt; behold now it suddenly only works for like 10 minutes before an all-
&gt; new battery is exhausted. Just the way it goes.

&gt;&gt;and patience.  It was an eye-opener for me when I took my last &quot;good&quot;
&gt;&gt;VCR in for a repair, and the tech told me the innards of these things
&gt;&gt;are the same in a $300 unit as well as the cheapo $50 ones you get in
&gt;&gt;discount stores.  All you get is a name and a better looking shell.

&gt;&gt;(turns out, the &quot;good&quot; VCR lasted only 2 years; the $50 cheap one I
&gt;&gt;got to replace it is still going strong 10 years later)

&gt; Depends. Usually whenever I've bought cheap VCRs or whatever, they've
&gt; been really lacking in features, worked slow or just plain annoying -
&gt; hard to aim the remote or whatever.

&gt; The last time I 'saved' some money I bought a cheap Sony DVD to
&gt; replace a 4-yr old Thompson that died...it drives me nuts that it
&gt; takes like 10 seconds to stop and open the bloody tray. And it won't
&gt; play divx or anything...really shitty in-play menu and whatever. A
&gt; friend bought an almost similar one but a notch higher in model range
&gt; and that works like a dream in comparison.

&gt; But music gear in general...seems to be really well built. My Marshall
&gt; and BOSS FX unit are like 20 years old already and they work just like
&gt; new, no detectable problems anywhere.

But how long do you figure Behringer or Digitech pedals will go?  My
nephew's RP50 has a broken switch cover (that actuates a microswitch on
the board).  Easy fix?  NOPE, the damned switch cover is molded into the
CASE!

Quality costs MONEY.  Most people want new, instead of repairing
something that may actually be much more reliable than new.  And people
want CHEAP.  So we get Chinese products that look nice, but lack the
quality we once expected.

Meanwhile, I'm happy playing old tube amps, using a toaster from the
50's, and driving a 30+ year old Mercedes.  I figure that each one of
them are more reliable than the modern replacement.

&gt;&gt; board amps are disposable. I dont think there was such a thing as a

&gt;&gt; could last two life times if no body jammed a butter knife into it
&gt;&gt; while it was cooking and started digging around like a gopher with
&gt;&gt; hydrophobia.
&gt;&gt;  Ignorant doesnt mean you're stupid  and thats good because  you old
&gt;&gt; boys are damned well ignorant.

&gt; I agree with the premise that the average quality of consumer goods has
&gt; steadily decreased over the last 50+ years.  When our toaster was going
&gt; bad, I just happened to be in a second hand shop (searching for tube
&gt; gear, no doubt) and bought a collectable old toaster that still works
&gt; like a charm!  I have no doubt that it will outlast me.

&gt; But when it comes to amps, I don't consider Keith an expert.  He never
&gt; responded to a thread about circuit boards in Marshalls (very few exist
&gt; without them, contrary to what he inferred in the thread).  Lots of
&gt; great amps have circuit boards.  Lots of &quot;iffy&quot; amps of yesteryear are
&gt; point to point.  THERE IS NO MAGIC in point to point, or
&gt; turret/fishboard/terminal strip construction.

&gt; The design form of a circuit board is NOT THE PROBLEM.  It's the
&gt; specific layout and quality of the board that's the issue!  Bad layout
&gt; can mean noise or even weird parasitics.  But that's not CAUSED by the
&gt; board, it's caused by bad engineering.  There are properly designed
&gt; boards that sound GREAT.  And they're also reliable.  Poorly designed
&gt; boards won't sound great.  Just like poor layout on a point to point amp
&gt; won't sound great!

&gt; Thin boards won't be as reliable.  But my biggest pet peeve is the board
&gt; mounted jacks and pots.  That's just begging for a mechanical failure.
&gt; I've seen it in my own gear.  And I've had portable CD players (source
&gt; in my cars) tear the trace right off of the board at the board mounted
&gt; jacks.

&gt; I did experience one board failure, just in the last couple of days.  I
&gt; am not easy on remote controls.  They get left on the couch.  Sat on by
&gt; my Doberman.  Knocked off the couch...  When the remote for my Luxman
&gt; R-117 stopped working, I pulled it apart (after checking batteries). The
&gt; lens broke off a long time ago.  Because of that, there's some flex when
&gt; you sit on it.  The board failed at a point of physical stress. Two
&gt; minutes later, it was back in service (jumped the broken trace).

&gt; Anybody know where I can find a point to point remote control for a
&gt; Luxman R-117?  Yeah, I'm joking, but also pointing out the fact that we
&gt; couldn't have 99% of today's electronics without circuit boards!

&gt; And I think somebody already pointed out that circuit board design got a
&gt; boost from the military.  You don't think early missiles had point to
&gt; point, terminal strip or turret boards, do you???  Talk about stress and
&gt; the need for reliability!

Note.. big 67meg file.. Need broadband...

Of course, that video is greatly degraded from the original

But it still looks fairly sharp at 100%. It's still watchable
at 200%, but a tad blurry in spots..

Haven't read all comments, so I may've missed something.

One reason _some_ claims (I'm not saying it has actual meaning) is that
any soldering point where the two components aren't in direct contact to
oneanother, will act as a small diode, possibly impairing sound.
While such a small diode is actually measurable, I'm unsure it'll impair
sound, but also not saying it won't.  Never measured/listenend it out.

However, if we acknowledge this as fact, PTP _may_ make sense - provided
all wires are twisted to oneanother before soldering. MHO, YMMV..

My take is it really doesn't matter, considering most will likely have
at least some stomps probably not made this way..

For a purist, using hardly more than the amp, and with great care taken
_everywhere_ in the signal path.. maybe..

Some of you may know of a technique, mostly used in digital circuits,
called wire-wrap, where sockets have long pins, sticking out below the
PCB. These pins are square and sharp. Using a dedicated tool, wire is
wrapped around pins with a designated force, and actually gets kinda
cold-welded.  Results in a fantastic joint (non-smokable).

By twisting wires in a PTP design, the solder is more to keep it
together; of cause, also to finalize the connection.
Look back to older radio designs..  it was often done like this then.
Not sure it was to get the maximum tone, though ;)

I can say...from experience that there *is* a difference. It will
depend on one thing, and that is board layout. I have built the same
preamp circuit (3 stage, JCM-ish but tweeked to be hotter/smoother) in
countless amps as well as ground up p-t-p builds and it sounds
different in every application given the same supply V. The closest to
p-t-p would be the JCM/JMP/plexi RI. That style layout is minimalist
and traces are spaced so stray capacitance is not an issue.

As an example, for a customer I built that circuit into a Peavey TG
Raxx rack mt preamp using the existing pcb and making only minor
changes to the layout via cut traces/jumpers. Circuitry not needed was
eliminated. It worked fine, but had a dark quality to it I didn't care
for.
FF about 2 months...same custy brings me another TG Raxx preamp and
says gut it and lets do this one PTP wired. So I cut the pcb leaving
only the pwr supply section and do the build on eyelet board. Night
and day difference. Drastic contrast in clarity, especially when set
to run fairly clean. The PTP one had a high end sparkle the pcb
version just couldn't duplicate.
So that's my take on it.
Last I talked to him, he was using both of them...one for the darker
sound when that was the goal.

probably far more culpable for equipment failure than PCB's themselves.

I can't say as to &quot;sounds better&quot; but I'll bet others will. However...

When a PTP amp breaks it can easily be repaired. When a PCB fails it
usually gets shit-canned. Still, I own a couple PCB amps and I like
them (USA Blues Jr. and USA Tweed Pro Jr.). I also own a few PTP
classics (65 BF Champ, 76 SF Champ and 65 Whiteface Gibson Skylark)
and I'll pay the piper to keep them running as long as parts exist.
And yes, they sound great.  And I'll buy more when I can afford them.
I'm craving a Deluxe Reverb. Some day...

&gt; I can say...from experience that there *is* a difference. It will
&gt; depend on one thing, and that is board layout. I have built the same
&gt; preamp circuit (3 stage, JCM-ish but tweeked to be hotter/smoother) in
&gt; countless amps as well as ground up p-t-p builds and it sounds
&gt; different in every application given the same supply V. The closest to
&gt; p-t-p would be the JCM/JMP/plexi RI. That style layout is minimalist
&gt; and traces are spaced so stray capacitance is not an issue.

&gt; As an example, for a customer I built that circuit into a Peavey TG
&gt; Raxx rack mt preamp using the existing pcb and making only minor
&gt; changes to the layout via cut traces/jumpers. Circuitry not needed was
&gt; eliminated. It worked fine, but had a dark quality to it I didn't care
&gt; for.
&gt; FF about 2 months...same custy brings me another TG Raxx preamp and
&gt; says gut it and lets do this one PTP wired. So I cut the pcb leaving
&gt; only the pwr supply section and do the build on eyelet board. Night
&gt; and day difference. Drastic contrast in clarity, especially when set
&gt; to run fairly clean. The PTP one had a high end sparkle the pcb
&gt; version just couldn't duplicate.
&gt; So that's my take on it.
&gt; Last I talked to him, he was using both of them...one for the darker
&gt; sound when that was the goal.
">

That could be a million other things - the variance in components for
one.... Personally, I don't think 2 identical amps can sound alike. Or, any
differences could be fixed by EQ.

Other than that... I haven't even thought of my TG Raxx preamp in 20
years.... Freaky little thing :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Only thing I could see is that they'd be easier to modify.  If yer
&gt;&gt;&gt; into that sort of thing...

&gt;&gt; If they mess up a PTP amp you buy, one recovery path is the local amp
&gt;&gt; guy. If they mess up a PCB amp you buy, the only real choice is
&gt;&gt; RMR through the manufacturer, unless you have access to the tools.

&gt;&gt; With SMT and what not, &quot;the tools&quot; get expensive fast, and if you don't
&gt;&gt; do that sort of work daily, it's hard to stay in practice. If it's
&gt;&gt; throughhole, it's not as bad. PCB amps also may develop sensitivities
&gt;&gt; to vibration that are hard to diagnose.

&gt;Good point...something to be said for accessibility.

&gt;...BTW - where the hell does one find a tube tester these days?
