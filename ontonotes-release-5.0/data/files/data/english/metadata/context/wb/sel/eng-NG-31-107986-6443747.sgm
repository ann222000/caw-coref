Hi All

I brewed two beers with the same yeast recently, one week after the
other, with the second beer (7.5% IPA) pitched on the slurry of the first.

The IPA attenuated from 1.070 to about 1.013 (81% apparent attenuation)
which is just great, but the first, an Amarillo hops test brew, would
only go from 1.047 to 1.017 after 2 weeks, 1 primary, 1 secondary (about
64% apparent attenuation).  I made a 2 litre starter, and there was
quite a bit of slurry in there when I pitched it.  It was well aerated,
and fermentation has kicked off after about 9 hours - there was a
krausen at that time.

The recipe was;
80.1% Pale
15.1% Munich
2.9% Crystal 40L
2.0% Torrified Wheat

Mashed at 69C to slightly offset this yeast's high attenuation (this was
really a brew to build up the yeast for the IPA, which I did want to
attenuate a lot).  I didn't expect this mash temp to quite have the
effect it did - I've never had this happen to this extent before at that
mash temp.

Fermented at 19C (temp control) for 6 days.

I roused the yeast yesterday in secondary and I'm going to take a
reading in a day or two, but I suspect that there isn't enough yeast in
there to make a difference.  The kegs are indoors, so nice and warm.

Is it worth me pitching a packet of S04?

Any other suggestions?

Cheers,
Mark

Hello Mark,

The last time I used WLP007 was on a 1.065 beer (mashed at 67C) and I
reused it then on a 1.075 beer. Now the first beer was with a 1.5 liter
starter and it fermented out to 1.022, the second beer was with some
washed slurry and it went immediately to 1.012. It took 6 weeks in the
keg for the first beer to dry out a bit, but it was one of my best
(Amber Ale from Durden Park). I have some of this beer in bottles (4
months old) and it tastes dry.

Regards -- Stuart McLuckie

That's interesting, thanks for that Stuart, so it's a RDWHAHB scenario!

The first ferment still had a very thin krausen when I racked it to
secondary (I had no choice but to rack due to the next brew needing to
go in to the fermenter), but the second took off like a rocket and was
finished after about 3 days despite it being nearly twice the gravity.

I wonder what the answer is to get this yeast to ferment 'properly' from
the first pitch?  Perhaps step up from 1L to 2L starter rather than just
go for the 2L starter straight off?

Cheers,
Mark

Hi Mark,

I like the flavour and aroma from this yeast (and wlp002), but I think
I'll use it first in a normal gravity beer (1.040) and then let it loose
on a Durden Park heavyweight.

My first brew was 1.047, do you think that was perhaps too high a
gravity for the first pitch?  FYI, the second beer was the Whitbread
1864 Export India Ale from the Durden Park book, 200 IBU's - man this
thing is bitter (as BeerBloke can attest - he tried a sample at the
weekend) - it's going to be a while before it's drinkable!

I did email White Labs about the low attenuation of the first beer and
they suggested rousing the yeast as it's highly flocculent.  If I use
this yeast again, I'll try that - There was a lot of slurry from the
starter, so I don't think it was a matter of not pitching enough yeast.

Cheers,
Mark

Hi to the UK Homebrew list from Oz

We use WLP 007 in the "Gulf Brewery" and it does attenuate well. It can
flocculate very easily and will form a solid sludge unless it is roused.
We ferment at 20 to 21C and it reaches its attenuation mark easily.

One thing that may help - we made too big a starter when we used WLP 002
(which is similar to 007) and the ferment went to sleep and took forever
to complete. A 1 litre starter should be enough for a 20 litre batch
with this yeast.

Cheers
Peter

Hi Peter in Oz!

Thanks for the advice.

My brew length is 40L normally, but due the amount of hops soaking up
wort, I got about 35L this time.  Do you still think that the 2L starter
would have been too big?

Mark

Hi Mark

In 40 litres, 2 litres should be OK in 35 litres. How old was the yeast
tube and how well did you oxygenate? Usually we don't have any hassles
with this yeast, but we get ours within a week of it being made by White
Labs.

Cheers
Peter

Hi Peter

IIRC the yeast vial was dated end of February 2007.

I inline aerate (filtered air), and run off very slowly past the inline
stainless stone (run-off takes about 60-90 minutes).  Fermentation is
always flying (plenty of krausen on top) after about 9 hours.

Cheers,
Mark

Now this rings a bell. I remember getting a Whitelabs yeast that was
nearing its use by date, which could account for a sluggish start with
the first brew.

Hi Mark

Looks like it is just one of those things where there isn't a definite
answer.  If the yeast weren't healthy, your second batch would have a
problem too.

Why don't get another vial, make another batch and try again :-)

Cheers
Peter

From what I've tasted of the first brew so far, even though it is currently
a little sweet, the flavour from the yeast seems to be very nice, so I
will try it again some time.  Next brew being planned is a CACA as
recommended by leMan a few weeks ago.  I have some dried US-56 ready for
that brew.

Cheers,
Mark

Hi Mark,

Having read all the posts on this query, it's pretty obvious that the
viability of the yeast in the phial must have been quite poor, evidenced
by the fact that on re-pitching with a much greater quantity of viable
live cells it performed as it should.   I've found that when I've used a
weak sample of yeast, no amount of  nurturing with yeast aid, oxygen,
rousing etc will get it perform as it should and it tends to stick at a
higher than normal gravity.   Mind you, it rarely bothers me as I just
fine it at whatever gravity it ends up at and drink it!   If its sweeter
than normal, then at least it will be very full flavoured and malty
which I personally favour anyway.   I also find that the beer will still
attenuate slowly towards the target PG (unless I just happen to drink it
all first!)   I'd forget the SO4.

Regards, Ray

Hi Ray

I wonder if I could have helped the viability with a bigger starter?  Or
at least by perhaps stepping up say from 1L to 2L rather than just
dumping the yeast vial straight in to the 2L starter.

I'm waiting to get my hands on a stir plate.  Somebody has one for me,
but we just need to organise the logistics of actually getting it to me,
then I can continuously aerate and keep the yeast in suspension,
hopefully leading to better starters.

I've found that when a beer is a little on the sweet side, upping the
carbonation a touch and serving on the cool side makes it more
palatable.  I find that it can get a bit sickly once it warms up and the
carbonation reduces.

I'm in no rush for the beer (yet - I have a corny on tap), so I can
happily leave it for a few weeks to see what happens.

Cheers,
Mark

Interesting,

I've used this yeast before and it attenuated well. Then I pitched a cup
of the slurry into the next beer I made and it stopped around 1.020.
Mystery!
