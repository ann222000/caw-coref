Dr. Abolghassem Ghaffari, who helped put man on the moon as a
mathematician with the U.S. Space Agency, marked his 100th birthday in Los
Angeles on June 15th, 2007.
Ghaffari was born in Tehran. He was educated at the Darolfonoun School
before going to France in 1929 with a full scholarship to study mathematics
and physics at Nancy University. He received his doctorate from the
Sorbonne. In 1936 he worked at the Paris Observatory on celestial mechanics,
the foundation of his later work calculating how much power was needed to
get a rocket into orbit around the moon without overshooting.
Ghaffari returned to Iran in 1937 to teach at the University of Tehran.  He
was drafted into military service from 1938 to 1941 where he directed field
work leveling parts of northern Tehran to prepare it for the army.
In 1950, by invitation of Harvard University and as a Fulbright Scholar, he
worked as a research associate to lecture on Differential Equations and to
continue his research on Gas Dynamics. Dr. Ghaffari and Dr. Mohsen Hashrudi,
were among the first Iranians to become Fulbright Scholars. Hashrudi's area
of study was also mathematics at Harvard at the same time Ghaffari was
there.
After the war, he frequently traveled to Britain and the United States on
research.  In the early 1950s, the proud Iranian worked alongside Albert
Einstein in Princeton's Institute For Advanced Study
&lt; http://www.ias.edu/ &gt;on the Unified Field Theory of Gravitation and
Electromagnetism. Einstein
was very curious about Iran and asked Ghaffari, 'so how did Persia become
Iran?' &lt;/P&lt; font&gt;
Robert Oppenheimer was director of the Institute at the time and
befriended Ghaffari. The first time Ghaffari met Oppenheimer, when finding
out that Ghaffari was Iranian asked him if he knew Dr. Kamal Genab, who was
a physics student of Oppenheimer's at Cal Tech. Ghaffari was invited to the
White House when President Johnson gave Oppenheimer the Enrico Fermi Award
in 1963. President Kennedy was supposed to have given the award to
Oppenheimer, but he was assassinated the week before the ceremony. 'I felt
pity for Dr. Oppenheimer, because his guilt and smoking had taken a real
toll on him over the years. He was sick (with cancer) and was hobbling
around with a cane. I could feel the end was near,' Ghaffari said.
Oppenheimer died of throat cancer four years later at the age of 62.
In 1956, Ghaffari moved permanently to the United States to take a position
with the U.S. National Bureau of Standards in the mathematics division.
Part of his work there involved calculations of the motion of artificial
earth satellites.
In 1962, the Bureau of Standards granted Ghaffari permission to start
working at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as a
part-time consultant for the Goddard Space Flight Center. He was the first
Iranian to work for NASA.  In 1964, three years into the manned space
program and when his projects were finished at the Bureau, he became a
full-time staff scientist at NASA, where he worked on Apollo missions 11 and
12. His chief responsibility was to determine out how to get a rocket to the
moon. He had to account for the gravity of the earth and the gravity of the
moon and calculate how many and how powerful mid-course corrections would be
required to place a rocket into orbit around the moon. An error would send
the rocket crashing into the moon or soaring passed it into deep space.  For
the manned space program, he also had to get the rocket back again.
Ghaffari and his colleagues on the Apollo missions were invited to the
White House by President Nixon in 1969, where they were given medals for
their service on Apollo 11. At the event, footage of the successful landing
was aired, a reporter was there and asked Ghaffari, 'Did this really happen
or was this shot in Texas?' Ghaffari was too shocked at his comment to
respond. 'I never got around to asking him what media outlet he worked for,'
Ghaffari said.
Ghaffari was awarded in recognition of his exceptional contributions to
Aerospace education during the first decade of space exploration in 1970 by
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.
He retired from NASA in 1972, three years after the Apollo program placed
the first men on the moon and got them back safely.
In 1998, Ghaffari was asked by the Millenium Committee what his prediction
was for the biggest scientific event of the millenium. Ghaffari responded,
'If NASA's budget doesn't get cut, a manned mission to Mars will occur by
2010.'
Ghaffari was awarded the distinguished scholar award for outstanding
achievement in the advancement of science by the Association of Professors
and Scholars of Iranian Heritage (APSIH) in 2005.
Ghaffari's mind is very lucid and in much better condition than his body.
When asked about how it feels to be 100, he said, 'I'm not happy, because I
can't work in an office anymore. I do get to do some independent research at
home though.'
Beverly Hills mayor Jimmy
Delshad&lt; http://www.persianmirror.com/Article_det.cfm?id=1431&amp;authorid;=27&amp;getA...; &gt;will
be giving Ghaffari a special certificate honoring his birthday from
the
city of Beverly Hills. Ghaffari plans to mark his 100th birthday at home
with his wife and daughters.
Happy Birthday Dr. Ghaffari!
