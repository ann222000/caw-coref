I'm off tomorrow on a week's trip, with only dial-up connectivity, and expect to have minimal contact with the news. I'll probably post occasionally, but in preparation, I've queued up a series of audio posts like the ones I've been posting in the last few days, so you'll want to at least stop by for those. Some good stuff on the way!

Catch you later; feel free to use this and the other audio posts as open threads.

I have a question for eli, which also is a question for others, he has talked about how he once supported Barry Goldwater, Im curious about how he went from a Goldwater supporter to a socialist, at what point in his life and what definitavely decided him. Also of course Im interested in others here and at what point politics went from being something of concern to something of major importance in your life.
To pick out one moment, I can think of when I was studying IR at University, it was here that I caught a glimpse of the beast of modern day capitalism and recoiled from that glimpse. Although it would be a year from then before I had committed to marxism, for a time I toyed with anarchism, I bought the book on parecon a subject we've recently discussed. I was won over though by the arguments of marxists in response to anarchists. Of course theres a lot more to say but this is not my life story but rather of course Im interested in your political journey, that is of course if you eli and others dont mind me asking.

Wondering if anyone had seen this BBC article on Venezuela. Good old objective journalism, eh?

David, Latin anti-Americanism is to not see local problems?! I don't find this BBC article objective.

Have a great vacation!
