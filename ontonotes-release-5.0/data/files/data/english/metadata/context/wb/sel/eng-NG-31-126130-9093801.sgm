Something very short ;-)
&quot;no retreat, baby, no surrender&quot;

something along those lines- one line of words to live by.

&quot;Magic.&quot;

Short and sweet, to the point, no cliche and open to broad
interpretation.

Near the nether regions too ;-)

No doubt about it, LOVE on my right hand hand, FEAR on the left...both
very small...not gaudy or even noticeable..  Almost did that in 88, in
fact.  It's one of the mosr perfecxt songs he's ever written, maybe
the single best song written by a rocker about growing up.

I suppose there are a few of those I could think of...  Something that
served as a reminder to real world issues as well.

&quot;This is what will be&quot;

God have mercy on the man who doubts what he's sure of.

Its a little long, though.

&quot;Magic&quot; IMHO is a little TOO broad- wouldn't be connected with Bruce
per se unless you included an image with it.

Time for my fave limerick:

There once was a hooker from Yale
With her prices tattooed on her tail
And on her behind
For the sake of the blind
Was a duplicate version in Braille.

&quot;Show a little faith, there's magic in the night...&quot;

Reminds me of a beautiful song and the many nights I spent running on
the backstreets of my hometown with my dog, Magic, trying to figure
things out.  That lyric is all about faith and hope.  Those two
qualities are occasionally useful.  Given the reference to my dog, I
might choose to capitalize Magic. Not sure.

Actually, &quot;Runnin' on the backstreets...&quot; would be pretty good, too.

Okay, so here's what I'm thinking:

Left bicep:

&quot;Trust none of what you hear
And less of what you see
This is what will be&quot;

(or something else to match my cynical side)

Right bicep:

&quot;Wherever somebody's struggling to be free
Look in their eyes and you'll see me&quot; (omitted the 'ma' for the sake of
avoiding the tattoo cliche.

(or something else to match my idealist/passionate/activist side - and
remind me that a fight is always necessary if it's right)

Any other ideas?

Why do people get tattoos?
People sometimes get tattoos for personal reasons, like for courage or
for loved ones, but sometimes people get tattoos to give the
impression of coolness or popularity. I personally like them because
they are a personal form of art. In a way the body is the canvas.

&gt; &quot;The problems we face as individuals, as a country, and as world citizens
&gt;  are too many and often too complex to think we can get laid without
&gt;  the full power of our collective human resources.&quot;

I would get a tattoo that said,

&quot;I walk with angels that have no place&quot; with nice little angel
wings.....

Or mabye &quot;It's hard to be a saint in the city..&quot;

Or &quot;Spirit in the Night&quot;

I guess I&quot;d just wind up with tattoos everywhere...I better not even
start!!

Peace,

Debbie

&gt; Why do people get tattoos?
&gt; People sometimes get tattoos for personal reasons, like for courage or
&gt; for loved ones, but sometimes people get tattoos to give the
&gt; impression of coolness or popularity. I personally like them because
&gt; they are a personal form of art. In a way the body is the canvas.

I got my very first one because I was very pissed off while in New Orleans.
I'd gotten lost and wound up in the Ninth Ward (mind you this was
pre-Katrina).
I saw houses and homes and children living in places where I wouldn't let a
dog live.
I saw a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King in the middle of a small
park with &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; beneath it.
I wound up on a bus that took me down Canal Street...and dropped me off in
front of a tattoo parlor.
Never had even contemplated getting one in all my years......if anything,
the idea always repulsed me.
However, not one to believe in coincidence, I walked up the stairs and asked
the guy to print &quot;No Justice, No Peace&quot;
over my left shoulder, with a cross in the middle.

I did, last year: it is in a flow-y scriopt around my lower right
ankle, saying &quot;Show a little faith~~ there's magic in the
night.&quot;  (Turned out my tattoo-ist and I lived in the same
neighborhood back in Boston, had hung out in many of the same places,
and finally that we'd gone to the same college (Emerson). She was 20
years younger, and was thrilled to &quot;discover&quot; Springsteen...on my
ankle. She'd known who he was but not the beauty of the lyrics...)
And the beauty and promise and sheer hope of those lyrics is why I
chose them in particular. It was either that, or &quot;Tramps like us,
baby, we were born to run...&quot; figured the other quote was just a bit
more  *me*...
