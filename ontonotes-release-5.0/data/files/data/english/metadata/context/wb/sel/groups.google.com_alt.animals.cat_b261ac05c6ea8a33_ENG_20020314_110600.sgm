I don't think you've &quot;lost it&quot;. My cats talk to birds, squirrels, ladybugs
and anything else that is outside. My Tabitha is the most talkative of the
bunch. One of her many nicknames is Chirper. She keeps going even after the
bird has left.

My cat too sits squeaking to birds. Even when they're really quite far away.
(when close he's not telling he's on his way...) But it's a very low-voiced
funny kind of talking.

"/> Mine also behave oddly when seeing birds through glass. I put it down
to frustration at not being able to try to catch them - they certainly
don't do it when outside. BTW Mostly they fail to catch birds - being
unable to fly is a bit of a disadvantage.

Hi guys, my kitten does this as well. I thought he was cold or something
until I read this passage in a very comprehensive cat encyclopedia I own:

&quot;The explanation of this particular response is that the cat is performing
an exaggerated version of its highly specialized killing-bite. It is
behaving as if, in its mind, it already has the unfortunate bird in its jaws
and is delivering the coup de grace. It is rather like a man licking his
lips in anticipation of a tasty meal.&quot;

&quot;Close observation of the way in which cats kill their prey has revealed
that there is an unusual jaw movement employed to bring about an almost
instantaneous death. After the initial pounce, ... the cat quickly crunches
down with its long canine teeth, aiming at the nape of the neck. With a
rapid juddering movement of the jaws it inserts these canines into the neck,
slipping them down between the vertebrae to sever the spinal cord. It is
an enactment of this special killing-bite that the frustrated, window-gazing
cat is performing, unable to control itself at the tantalizing view of the
juicy little bird outside.&quot;

This info was obtained from &quot;Cat World, a Feline Encyclopedia,&quot; by Desmond
Morris. Excellent reference book, I have read it cover to cover!

"/> While I wouldn't take everything from Desmond Morris as gospel - he's an
anthropologist by trade - I've not heard any other explanation for this
behavior, and it seems to make sense. Jupiter is the house chatterer,
and sometimes includes a low whine as well. Samantha did that once and
scared the bejeesus out of my housemate who wondered if she was
possessed. :)
