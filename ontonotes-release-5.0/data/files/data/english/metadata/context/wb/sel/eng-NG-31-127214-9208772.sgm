What penalties? The bogus facemask call against Young was the first one
against the Niners in the second half. As far as Roman, he should have his
head jammed up his ass and forced to walk around that way for the next
week.

When you try to tackle somebody who is doing their utmost to evade you,
there is a chance that your fingers might graze across their facemask.
That's what happened to Young. There was no evidence of intent, or anything
other than unintentional contact with the facemask. It should have been no
call, or 5 yards at the most.
