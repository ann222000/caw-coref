We too, here, have &quot;only one wish&quot;...
That you'd disappear in a swish,
'Cause we don't give a damn
'Bout your incessant spam,
For it smells too much like a dead fish.

To be just a little more rough
On this bastard I still have some stuff
To link on my site
Which well-used just might
Make her feel just unwelcome enough ...

... to get lost, that is.

I haven't tried this out for a while, but if you click on the hardsoft
links that I've used to obliterate the blogspot links and you get a
suitable putdown, please feel free to use the same method yourself.

Repeating his links in replies just helps spread the disease.
