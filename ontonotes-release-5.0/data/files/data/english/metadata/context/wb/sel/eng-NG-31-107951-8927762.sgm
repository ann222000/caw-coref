says Valverde refuses to have DNA tested invoking legal rights,
freedom, etc...

I remember reading somewhere that he said exactly that. He didn't feel
that he should have to give up his rights to prove himself innocent
when his own federation and government have said there's nothing to
the charges. Once again &quot;Guilty as hell and a cheating scumbag&quot;, until
they can prove themselves innocent.
Right after worlds the riders need to go on strike and form a decent
union, and refuse to ride until they collectively bargain a fair,
transparent, honest system, with the protections guaranteed by EU law.

Indeed! But consider - Floyd didn't trust these bums to act legally so
it made all of the case public and sure enough now we can all see that
they don't give a damn even about their own rules.

He signed a contract that siad that he was guilty until proven innocent, why
would you expect anything different?

I agree that the riders should have a strong union but until stars like
Valverde are willing to give up short-term revenue for long-term rights it
will never happen.  He was in a great position before he signed his last
contract to make a stand on the issue but instead took the money and ran.

What I don't understand, and I think I understand what Sandy has said,
is that those contracts and a lot of the Wada/UCI stuff violates EU
labor law, at a minimum, and other things. I don't understand how any
agreement that's in violation of the law can be considered binding and
legal.

Why not, but you know exactly what I mean, why on earth would a Puerto

Since day one the Spaniards have done all they could to protect him, I
always found it suspicious that they would specify that HE was not in

OK, if it does why didn't Valverde fight to get it removed?

I believe that the answer is that he wanted his.  His money, his fame, his

He may very well be guilty, but the system is flat out broken. I take
the same position as I did on the first OJ trial. He was guilty as
hell IMO but the LAPD was so corrupt and incompetent that he had to be
allowed to walk. I feel the same way about Wada and LNDD.
I'm not giving up a single damned right, or protection voluntarily,
especially to a corrupt/incompetent governing body. Ben Franklin,
since this is rbr:

Benjamin Franklin:
They who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security,
deserve neither liberty or security.

Samuel Adams:
If ye love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquility of servitude
greater than the animating contest for freedom, go home from us in
peace. We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick
the hand that feeds you; and may posterity forget that ye were our
countrymen.

Sandy has mentioned that there is little to no sympathy for the
riders, as they are seen as spoiled, rich types by the public. I asked
him the same question, pretty much, a while ago and, as I remember he
said that the courts, etc...just couldn't be bothered with any of
this.

moron,

when will you stop yammering about a rider union like it's supposed to
be a panacea ?

if cyclists have a union it's the UCI.

pro cycling is not a steelmill, it's not even the NFL. riders aren't
employed by the UCI or even the ASO. steelworkers and most pro-
athletes work for the entity that actually generates revenue. that's
not the case in cycling.

this is besides the fact that in most pro sports the collective
agreements are designed to to benefit the owners - eg. salary caps are
the main feature. in the NFL contracts aren't even guaranteed !

they can get away with this because the supply of skilled players far
exceeds the demand.

notice how there's no salary caps for lawyers or CEOs or hedge-fund
managers ?

They get away with it because the payouts to the players under the new
owner-friendly contract regime have been fabulous.

Note that under the current scheme, a huge amount of the net revenue
from football (57%) goes to player salaries.

This means that players have a big stake in the popularity of the game,
as do owners.

http://www.askthecommish.com/salarycap/faq.asp

As a result, salaries have skyrocketed in lockstep with the increasing
profitability of the NFL. It's hard to argue that things would have
gotten even better in an un-capped league.

Indeed, most steel mills don't have this kind of profit-sharing, do they?

dumbass,

why not ? (though I do see the second item guarantees a min. level of
revenue sharing) the point is there is a cap, which implies that some
players will make less than if there wasn't.

Sure they do, if by &quot;most&quot; you mean &quot;none.&quot; While some companies in trades like
steelwork may have a profit sharing arrangement, it's going to be a very small one
indeed. That's because it's a very different sort of labor circumstance: while it is
in the steelworker's interests to make his company more popular, he doesn't have the
ability to do that like a pro ball player does.

&gt; &gt; &gt; agreements are designed to to benefit the owners - eg. salary caps are
&gt; &gt; &gt; the main feature. in the NFL contracts aren't even guaranteed !

&gt; &gt; &gt; they can get away with this because the supply of skilled players far
&gt; &gt; &gt; exceeds the demand.

&gt; &gt; They get away with it because the payouts to the players under the new
&gt; &gt; owner-friendly contract regime have been fabulous.

&gt; &gt; Note that under the current scheme, a huge amount of the net revenue
&gt; &gt; from football (57%) goes to player salaries.

&gt; &gt; This means that players have a big stake in the popularity of the game,
&gt; &gt; as do owners.

&gt; &gt; http://www.askthecommish.com/salarycap/faq.asp

&gt; &gt; As a result, salaries have skyrocketed in lockstep with the increasing
&gt; &gt; profitability of the NFL. It's hard to argue that things would have
&gt; &gt; gotten even better in an un-capped league.

&gt; dumbass,

&gt; why not ? (though I do see the second item guarantees a min. level of
&gt; revenue sharing) the point is there is a cap, which implies that some
&gt; players will make less than if there wasn't.
">

Dumbass: maybe not. I strongly suspect that capping has a useful effect
on league parity, and I strongly suspect that league parity has a useful
effect on league popularity.

The stats on that aren't perfect, in terms of proving there's a
substantial change in parity in the post-cap NFL versus pre-cap, but I'm
swayed by the argument that the differences in individual team revenues
would have gotten worse had the cap not been in place.

There's also the element that non-guaranteed contracts mean that
underperforming players can be kicked to the curb without the scary
cap-crunch effects (or simple pointless drag on the bottom line) that
guaranteed-contract leagues see. This means the best players are always
on the field, not the best players money could buy last year.

If you look at the MLB, where the Yankees basically damn the cap
penalties and buy whatever they want, there's few teams that can even
try to compete with that model (and I'd argue that only some very smart
money keeps it from being even more successful). Good for NYY, bad for
other teams trying to convince their fans and their other players that
they're serious about winning the World Series.

The NBA has another interesting problem in spades, which is that with so
few players on the team, three or four really good players can switch a
team from bad to great. Since NBA stars like to win championships, you
can even see players accumulating on teams against their best financial
interests, to win a championship. Which means that talent aggregates,
and sucky teams suck a lot.

Which does nothing to explain the Detroit Lions, of course.

First order versus second order effects. If being in the UAW means your

your production line becomes unprofitable, that's bad. I note that

Dumbass,

I think the cap limits the salaries of superstars more than it
limits the salaries of journeymen.  Rosters have a limited
number of players; doubling a journeyman's salary makes
an insignificant cap hit compared to negotiating the franchise

I disagree.  I haven't looked, but it is likely that minimum
salaries and other protections didn't exist or were very low
before players' unions.  There are a variety of other things,
like free agency, that probably also are associated with
players' unions (admittedly, also with court decisions, in
the case of baseball).  Pro athletes used to all take part time
jobs in the off season.  Much of the increased money is due to
TV rights, but it is likely that the sharing of that money is due
to the players' associations.

None of this is to suggest that a pro cyclists' union is a
panacea.  For one thing, the situation is more analogous
to soccer and FIFA than to any of the North American
leagues.  Even then, the fact that teams do not have fixed
stadia or franchises makes comparisons difficult.

That's irrelevant, esp. if revenue is from sponsors and TV. The main
difference is that the teams aren't connected to the revenue that the

The amount of money in pro sports has grown hugely, and player salaries
have grown along with that.

One driver of salaries at various times have been rival leagues (World
Hockey Association, AFL, the &quot;useful&quot; USFL...) which have driven up
salaries as they competed for players. Indeed, in most cases these
leagues had a business opportunity because they saw a chance to buy up
the undercompensated talent from the senior league.

And yeah, TV has figured hugely in the growth of pro sport.

I think player's associations probably helped players, on balance, but
without the massive growth in popularity of sports (which I think has no
relation to the existence of player unions), the unions would be, at
best, ensuring revenue-sharing from a pot of money so small that the
players would be taking off-season jobs (see: professional lacrosse).

It's weirder than that. If you look at the NFL, or MLB, or (I'm
assuming?) Premier-league soccer, the governing bodies are essentially a
federation of the team owners. The team owners choose the executives,
and so forth. The teams also have &quot;ownership&quot; (more or less) of the
venues, and they hire the players.

In cycling, the UCI is essentially, to the extent it is responsible to
anyone, beholden only to national federations, all of whom have
virtually no relationship with the teams or the event creators. The ASO
is not really of the UCI, but neither is Tailwind, Slipstream, or any
other team.

Oh yeah: and most big events don't charge admission.

So revenue for the events is generated from TV rights and sponsorship
deals. Revenue for teams is generated from sponsorship deals. There
seems to be an unimportant amount of revenue flow between event
organizers and race teams, though in the lower divisions (Continental
etc.) start money can be a big draw, and prize money is a significant
source of salary for some ProTour riders.

Hopefully, someone will correct the parts I got wrong.

The problem is that the UCI, whose job was previously to print rainbow
jerseys, ban recumbents, and hand out those charmingly retro SFr fines,
has suddenly taken it upon itself to become organizer of the business
end of cycling (let's call this the &quot;Ecclestone gambit.&quot;)

I don't think it's likely to end well, especially since the UCI, WADA,
and the event organizers all (while being quite sincere about wanting
cycling to be a clean sport) seem to be using doping issues as a blunt
weapon to be wielded against their enemies (who are, of course, the UCI,
WADA and the event organizers. I'm not sure dopers or dope doctors are
any more than collateral damage at this point).

dumbass,

that is not at all true. the UCI has not stepped up the organize
anything - even the world championships. on the other hand, the ASO is
in the perfect position to become the ecclestone of cycling.

as you may know we are putting on two UCI 'cross events this year, the
UCI (or any gov. body) provides us with : a sanction, race insurance
and officials, and bills us for it. we do the heavy lifting and any
loss we incur is ours to bear.

so it's not reasonable the UCI or the teams to expect a part of the
revenue we generate.

Indeed. The thing about Ecclestone is that he basically doesn't own
anything, except the entirety of F1. In fairness to him, as rich as he
has become by being the reigning king of F1, he's also made a lot of
money for the race teams.

The tracks? Not so much.

In the new world order, the UCI saw itself as the creator of the
ProTour, with the right to decide both what teams were in the ProTour,
and what races were in the ProTour (including a few events that were
created for the ProTour, like that standalone TTT).

I'm not saying it is reasonable. I'm saying they are trying to be the
&quot;owners&quot; of the elite end of pro cycling, by dictating which races the
top teams race in, and which teams can be in the top races.

representation.
I'm not a huge union guy, and am usually anti-union for the
aforementioned issues of productivity and competition. US unions
really helped drive the move to offshoring things IMO, but they are
about the only way for workers, whether they be contract or wage to
protect themselves from predatory practices when the law won't. You
seem to have a problem with this, and you seem to think that the UCI
is looking out for the best interests of the workers. That's
laughable.
Unions don't solve everything, but they at least give the peopleon the
bottom end of the scale a chance to protect themselves when noone else
will, and improve conditions to a decent minimum standard.
I can't believe I need to argue an early 20th century obvious truth
with an educated human being in the 21st. It's just proof that
education doesn't make people better, just gives them more information
to use.
Dude unless your Islamic and fundamentalist, running a Nike
sweatshop, or a Chinese slave labor factory &quot;overlord&quot; positions are
out of style pretty much. Guess you can have dreams though.

dumbass,

a casual observer like you apparently cannot differentiate between the
different bodies (WADA,UCI, ASO) and what they do or have done
historically.

your thought process is something like &quot;the UCI is like the
governement, therefore it must be bad&quot;.

find me ONE INSTANCE prior to 2007 where the UCI acted against the
interest of a rider that did not test positive or otherwise be
implicated in a doping scandal.

the UCI has always been on the side of riders, and that is why WADA
was created, because they felt the gov. bodies would not police
themselves. which is true - why would be UCI want to suspend it's own
riders and hurt the image of the sport ?

but it is also the UCI's job to enforce the rules and it is only VERY
RECENTLY that the UCI has been proactive in trying to catch dopers -
deserved or not - eg.rasmussen, the expanded out-of-competition tests
and now valverde.

in the past the UCI only acted when it was forced to because of a
positive test or some scandal (eg. police raids). in fact the gov.
bodies cleared ullrich and basso (actually all the puerto riders) to
race this year and it was only because of some external investigation
that their cases were pursued leading to their suspension.

but the UCI doesn't exist in a vacuum. they are bound by the WADA code
and if the police or the LNDD or an ADA informs them that an athlete
is guilty of cheating they are obliged to act on it.

this is actually a revival of an old event. it was always in eindhoven

the concept of a protour is probably good for the prosperity of the

up the plans and trying to force the organizers to go along with it.

but it is the organizers that have built up the financial backing and
resources to put on major events, so they were rightfully indignant at
the UCI trying to call the shots.

they made their point by excluding Unibet from their events and the
UCI was toothless. they didn't remove the UCI sanction from Paris-NIce

dumbass,

this is where logic leaves you. Unibet was shafted by the organizers
as a statement against the UCI.

the UCI tried to get Unibet into the the grand tours, but they wildly
misjudged the influence they would have on the ASO.

the UCI didn't screw Unibet themselves, they at worst promised
something they couldn't deliver,and of course they were too weak to do
anything about it.
