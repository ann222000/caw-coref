What do Baltics have to do with SCB? SCB is the only place where I can
find out about all the troubles befalling Russia from Stavropol to
Vladivostok. Yes, you guys do talk about Baltics once in a while
(primarily as they relate to Russia) but virtually all posts here are
about Russia.

But you are wrong: unlike you, I am interested in the Baltic culture.
I would like to find out if Balts have their own literature, humour,
food, theater, film, music, painting, science. Unfortunately, in the
last 2 years or so, I haven't seen any informative discussions of
these topics.   I even tried to start such discussions, to no interest
whatsoever. It appears that I have more interest in and know more
about Baltic artists, chess players, writers, actors, composers than
the others at SCB.

But that's not because Baltics have no culture. Oh no.  It's just that
the people, who populate SCB (with the exception of GK), have no
interest in culture in general and Baltic culture especially. You are
the people, who have dedicated your whole lives to the hatred towards
Russia and just don't have time to learn about culture or Baltics.
You have lived in Latvia for 15 years and yet still don't know the
names of Latvian state holidays.

Like vampires live off human blood, you live off stories about crime,
ethnic tensions, poverty and human suffering in Russia.

The only culture you exhibit is when you take a lab test for yeast

Why do you think that is? What would the reason be for following the
news out of Russia on here? Why would posters on this forum do that?
Venture a guess. Are they illiterate imbeciles? Are they uncultured
prunes? Why would people with relatively high degrees, professionals,
experts in the Baltics sit in the virtual cafe and discuss Russia and
Russian policies toward three Baltic States?

I have written myriad and copious posts about Baltic history, culture,
politics, etc. -- if I have numerous posts about Russia, they're
usually in response to threads others have begun or concerned with
Russian-Baltic relations. As I noted, you're nothing but a provocateur
-- you had asked, in your inimitably strident and sarcastic manner,
how the Holocaust is marked, for example, and I explained to you that
it isn't remembered in connection with the Stalinist Victory Day...
but when there's a thread that's specifically devoted to Holocaust
Remembrance Day, you're obviously disinterested (actually, you ignore
most everything in this group unless you can redirect attention to the
former Yugoslavia or pick on people you consider your inferiors).

As to my not knowing the names of Latvian holidays -- once again you
sound like Hui, who repeatedly claims that I don't know my own
surname. I detailed the meanings of Labor Day and the Convocation of
the Constituent Assembly, and if you look at my blog you'll find
several posts related to important dates just in the last couple of
months.

It's true that a couple of people in this group seem to have dedicated
their lives to hatred towards Russia, but you can hardly say that
about most people here and you certainly can't say that about me. The
fact is, though, that what happens in Russia is and should be of
serious concern to us -- Russia has been our primary enemy for about
three centuries, in case you didn't notice, and Russia is engaged in a
propaganda war involving the hysterical denial of its history and the
rehabilitation of its demons.

When Edward Lucas is no longer confident that the Baltics will survive
and Anatol Lieven (something of a Russophile) speaks of stationing
Western European troops here, it's time to raise the alert level. The
direction Russia will take in the near and distant future is of grave
importance to us and to all of Europe, obviously. The article I linked
to is very illuminating with regard to the impossibility of
reconciling Great Russian chauvinism and the concept of a
multinational federation. Lt. Col. Putin recently spoke of tolerance
being in the Russians' blood, suggesting that the West should learn
from Russia and not the other way around -- even the Russian Orthodox
Church is a mechanism of tolerance different from that of other
religions, and this spirit of peaceful co-existence is in the
Russians' very genes. Putin's surreal absurdities are farcical, but
they're also revealing. I happen to think that watching Russia at this
point in time is as important as watching Germany in the early 1930s
was. You don't even have to listen very hard to hear the jackboots.

">

Britain doesn't claim that it didn't conquer India, does it?

As to Ireland, it so happens that part of that island still belongs to
the UK; most Protestants in the North don't consider themselves Irish,
whilst few Catholics there consider themselves British --

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_and_politics_of_Northern_Ir...

&quot;Problems with England&quot; are not merely historical in Ireland --
Operation Banner, for example, doesn't end until next month; that
deployment of troops began in 1969, making it &quot;the longest military
operation in the history of the British Army.&quot;

Of course, Britain hasn't bombed Belfast to the ground, as Russia did
to Grozny... but then Sinn Féin has elected representatives at
Stormont, at Westminster, and in Brussels, and Britain is a liberal
democracy.

And when it comes to the Republic -- well, Tony Blair, 1997: &quot;The
[1840s Irish potato] famine was a defining event in the history of
Ireland and Britain. It has left deep scars. That one million people
should have died in what was then part of the richest and most
powerful nation in the world is something that still causes pain as we
reflect on it today. Those who governed in London at the time failed
their people.&quot;

Back to India. Jack Straw wrote in the guest book at Amritsar, re the
1919 massacre -- &quot;This was a terrible occasion in which so many
innocents were slaughtered, for which I feel shame and sorrow.&quot;

Care to contrast this to His Excellency Viktor Kalyuzhny's visit to
the Occupation Museum in R ga?

_The Times of India_, 27 December 2006:

&quot;Britain is to teach its schoolchildren about the Jallianwala Bagh
massacre in an optional curriculum course offered nationally for the
first time ever, 87 years after trigger-happy General Dyer ordered a
peaceful, unarmed, pro-independence meeting of civilians in Amritsar
to be tragically fired upon.&quot;

You think Russian schoolchildren will be taught about the crimes
against humanity committed in the Baltic states sometime soon,
Karlamov?

Lucas is an astute and insightful journalist with prolonged experience
in Central and Eastern Europe, one of the main editors of a major

Where did I say &quot;unbiased&quot;? We all have our biases. Pçters and I
disagree on many a thing, but I admire the work he's been doing. As to
La Russophobe -- Kim is playfully strident with a dead serious
underlay... I find her stuff too in-your-face at times, even veering
into prejudice now and then -- but La Russophobe is nonetheless an
excellent resource, with original translations and a plethora of
excellent links. It's biased in the extreme, obviously, but you seem
to find extremes amusing so long as they're _your_ extremes, no? I
find the site pretty stylish in its way -- it's hilarious to watch neo-
Stalinist apologists freak out. Fighting fire with fire -- or meeting
Russian chauvinism at its rhetorical level... but with intellectual
backup, which the Nashi crowd and you so evidently lack.

As to Anna Planeta -- she's an ethnic Hungarian intellectual in
Romania. What do you know about her biases? She's certainly not a
Russophobe, and we disagree on many a thing, too.

The _International Herald Tribune_, 23 May 2007 --

&quot;In response, the European Union needs a combination of approaches.
First, it must make absolutely clear to Moscow that the Union and NATO
are prepared to defend their Baltic members against Russian pressure
and subversion. Should this increase to really dangerous levels, West
European troops should be sent to the region.&quot;

Yes, I try to expand NATO every day. It was me flying those warthogs
around Riga last week. And I've been doing this for _decades_!

The above paragraph is very revealing, Karlamov -- I'm afraid our
purpose is not to provoke Russia... it just so happens that democracy
and defensive alliances provoke Russia. Moving graves from busy
intersections to cemeteries provokes Russia. Telling the truth about
history provokes Russia. Asking Soviet colonists to learn the
languages of the countries they desire to be citizens of and
naturalize provokes Russia.

Hated and threatened? Look, Karlamov, I'm so busy personally expanding
NATO that I just don't have the time to provide you with therapy. I
was reading a wonderful study of Russian pride the other day: &quot;Proud
Of the Past, Ashamed of the Present...&quot; Concluding sentence: &quot;As long as
Russians seek grounds for national pride in history and recall them
only on holidays, and see shameful events every day, they are doomed

Hey, boy -- is you threatened, or threatening? You sound just like
Zhirik.

And I ain't never canonized Yeltsin, sorry -- here is the lengthiest
thing I've written about him:

http://lettonica.blogspot.com/2006/08/letting-bygones-be-bygones.html

As to hating and threatening -- I don't hate Russians and I certainly
don't threaten them. I would love to see Russia become a normal
country. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be in the cards. As
Akuraters wrote in the 1920s of the Bolsheviks, even total revolution
produced only what Russia has always specialized in producing --
gallows, prisons, and graveyards.

There were times in the 1990s when I believed that Russia was on the
road to recovery, and I rooted for its democrats. I's an idealist,
man. I's also a realist, though -- like your beloved Serbia, Russia is
sick at the root. It _could_ become a decent country, but it's not a
country -- it's a dying, dysfunctional empire masquerading as a
federation. If this is to function, it must become a multinational
federation, and not in name only -- simply put, it would have to
devolve power to its component parts, just as Britain is doing. Of
course, Britain is a civilized country and advanced enough to do this
-- Russia isn't, and it's doing the opposite, re-centralizing what was
decentralized under Borya.

To further simplify this -- it's a pretty basic matter. The Great
Russians cannot dominate the Federation and have a democracy in any
meaningful sense of the term. Putin spouts what he spouts re that
fantastic tolerance, when the reality is that Russia remains &quot;the
prison house of nations&quot; and a mass grave of ethnoi and non-Russian
languages and cultures.

Here, Karlamov, peruse the Red Book --

http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/introduction.shtml

Dr. Shlapentokh's article is especially interesting because it shows
how _the Russians_ suffer from their imperialism. This stands to
reason. We can all whine about the treatment of minorities in this
place or that place, in this degree or in that degree, and we do, or I
do -- but oppressing minorities doesn't just screw the minorities; it
also screws the oppressor, always.

&gt; The same reason why some people in Ireland and India still devote
&gt; their entire lives to finding problems and faults with England?
">

Didn't your mother teach you that it's impolite to respond to a
question with another question!

There is a great difference between India/Ireland and England, some of
which have already been mentioned. Russia is our neighbor and it
appears to struggle to come to grips with its Soviet past: from the M-
R pact to the &quot;voluntary&quot; inclusion of the Baltic Soviet republics
into the Soviet Union, from restoration of a hammer and  a sickle on
the Victory banner to restoration of the Soviet national anthem.
According to national polls in Russia, vast majority of Russian
citizens believe the Baltic inclusion in the SU was voluntary. That
difference often is noted by reading the Russian news media which
present anything that's going on in the Baltics in those skewed
colors. Until recently, Latvia was considered one of the most hostile
countries toward Russia. Now that place occupies Estonia.

So there is a problem of historical perception between the country-
colonizer and the natives. No such difference exists between Ireland/
India and England.

But for most people on here, it seems, Russia exemplifies the very
reason why the their fathers had to pack bags and leave their homes
for Germany, Canada, or the U.S. Russia is the very reason they became
displaced persons following World War II. And really can you blame
them for that? Can you blame someone who's heard horror stories about
deportations and killings for developing a paranoia and distrust
toward Russia? I can't. It's perfectly legitimate and understandable
feeling to have given the circumstances.

Even looking beyond the historical perspective, what happens in
today's Russia may have an impact in the Baltics again. Russia-EU
relationship bears a direct impact on the three Baltic states, which
are now members of the EU. Their dependence on Russian sources of
energy again offers a reason to watch out for the Eastern neighbor.

soc.culture.baltics is so much more than just about culture. It's also
politics and history. It's looking at the past to measure where you'll
be in the future. It's a conversation. It's a dysfunctional family
with a couple of nuts thrown in. Raimonds Pauls songs fail in
comparison with the deportation of Latvians in 1941 a few weeks before
Germany attacked the Soviet Union. The existence and role of the
Russian drama theater in Riga doesn't come close in significance to
the role Russia plays among its &quot;compatriots&quot; in Latvia today. With so
many scars left from our eastern neighbor on people's daily lives to
the point that some of them (and most of them on this forum) had to
leave their homes, it's understandably tough to talk about the recent
Kobzon concert in Riga.

Since they regained independence the Baltic countries went down the path
of counting score to pay back to Russians. The problem is it is a way to
nowhere simply because Beria and Stalin are dead. How I see it - many of
your politicians are playing very dirty game - addressing people's pain
memories to get votes. We just saw it in Estonia.
Russia has its own share of scumbag politicians who find that offer from
Baltics as a gift of God. Still in my opinion it is a sign of good
lazy times when majority of Russians see a tiny Baltic country as a
enemy #1. That's mean only one thing - Russians do not see the world as
a danger. Nor China, neither USA. Just verbal fight with neighbors.
Again as I see it, Baltics use Russia as a proxy for everything -
economy is bad? - blame Russkies, neglected youth vandalizes a city? -
blame Kremlin. Etc, etc, etc.
Probably you can live and go forward down this path. Still, I think, you
would do much better if you were not picking up a fight with Russia
every time you feel righteous or forgotten.

Sure they did. At first. Some of my friends say in the early 1990s
suddenly older ethnic Latvians stopped talking to ethnic Russians. I
graduated from a mixed high school in 1994. We were in the same
school, but separate really. And in those years, the atmosphere was
not amicable. From calling ethnic Latvians &quot;gansy&quot;, to &quot;kreivi go
home&quot; It was not a pretty sight.

It was true not only on the domestic level, but on the national level
as well. The naturalization board created windows for non-citizens to
naturalize; the language police fined a Russian media outlet for
overdoing it in Russian, etc. etc.

Since then, though, things have changed. The so-called naturalization
windows are abolished. One can place the sign up in Russian if one
wants to (incidentally one newspaper had a competition on a Russian
sign); naturalization laws are considered meeting the European
standards from both the EU and the Council of Europe.

Following years of occupation, it's only natural for the local
residents to get angry.

But we're not living in 1990s any more.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

It goes way beyond Stalin and Beria themselves. They might be dead,
but we're still sorting out through the pile of crap they left behind
-- the Russification polices, deportations, occupation, WW2, etc. And
we don't hear the whole lot of condemnation of the Stalin regime from
the official Kremlin, which is disheartening to say the least.

Sure. What politician doesn't play dirty games?

On the other hand, our ruling gang signed the border treaty with
Russia; pleading to participate in the NordStream, etc. etc. And that
coalition includes the nationalist Fatherlanders, probably the most
nationalist party to enter the Parliament following the elections last
fall.

That's exactly it: where is the logic? Does Latvia intend to occupy

Russia is no longer the scapegoat, really. Our economic situation, for
example, is on the verge of collapse or a really serious crisis. I
don't remember hearing any single politician blaming Russia for that.
I did hear a lot of Latvians of all kinds blaming the ruling
coalition, though.

I have to admit that I greatly enjoy browsing through her site (which
I have done twice). Watching how one woman's original tenis envy
towards the youth, beauty and prowess of Russian female tennis players
(especially the then-little teenage girl named Mashenka Sharapova)
gradually grew into an all-consuming hatred of not only all beautiful,
slim, long-necked and long-necked young Russian women and successful
athletes, but of all things Russian.

If her unbound energy were channeled in constructive directions, like
building tennis courts or skating rinks, USA would soon catch up to
Russia in tennis and even in ice hockey.

&gt; &quot;In response, the European Union needs a combination of approaches.
&gt; First, it must make absolutely clear to Moscow that the Union and NATO

&gt; and subversion. Should this increase to really dangerous levels, West

Out of curiosity, let me ask you a similar question: how much do you

So much that if they tell you that in their opinion, Russia is

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The same reason why some people in Ireland and India still devote
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their entire lives to finding problems and faults with England?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Didn't your mother teach you that it's impolite to respond to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;question with another question!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is a great difference between India/Ireland and England, some of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which have already been mentioned. Russia is our neighbor and it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;appears to struggle to come to grips with its Soviet past: from the M-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;R pact to the &quot;voluntary&quot; inclusion of the Baltic Soviet republics
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;into the Soviet Union, from restoration of a hammer and  a sickle on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the Victory banner to restoration of the Soviet national anthem.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;According to national polls in Russia, vast majority of Russian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;citizens believe the Baltic inclusion in the SU was voluntary. That
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;difference often is noted by reading the Russian news media which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;present anything that's going on in the Baltics in those skewed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;colors. Until recently, Latvia was considered one of the most hostile
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;countries toward Russia. Now that place occupies Estonia.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So there is a problem of historical perception between the country-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;colonizer and the natives. No such difference exists between Ireland/
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;India and England.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But for most people on here, it seems, Russia exemplifies the very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reason why the their fathers had to pack bags and leave their homes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for Germany, Canada, or the U.S. Russia is the very reason they became
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;displaced persons following World War II. And really can you blame
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them for that? Can you blame someone who's heard horror stories about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;deportations and killings for developing a paranoia and distrust
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;toward Russia? I can't. It's perfectly legitimate and understandable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;feeling to have given the circumstances.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Even looking beyond the historical perspective, what happens in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;today's Russia may have an impact in the Baltics again. Russia-EU
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;relationship bears a direct impact on the three Baltic states, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are now members of the EU. Their dependence on Russian sources of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;energy again offers a reason to watch out for the Eastern neighbor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;soc.culture.baltics is so much more than just about culture. It's also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;politics and history. It's looking at the past to measure where you'll
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be in the future. It's a conversation. It's a dysfunctional family
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with a couple of nuts thrown in. Raimonds Pauls songs fail in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;comparison with the deportation of Latvians in 1941 a few weeks before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Germany attacked the Soviet Union. The existence and role of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Russian drama theater in Riga doesn't come close in significance to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the role Russia plays among its &quot;compatriots&quot; in Latvia today. With so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;many scars left from our eastern neighbor on people's daily lives to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the point that some of them (and most of them on this forum) had to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;leave their homes, it's understandably tough to talk about the recent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kobzon concert in Riga.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Aleks

&gt;&gt;&gt;Since they regained independence the Baltic countries went down the path
&gt;&gt;&gt;of counting score to pay back to Russians.

&gt;&gt;Sure they did. At first. Some of my friends say in the early 1990s
&gt;&gt;suddenly older ethnic Latvians stopped talking to ethnic Russians. I
&gt;&gt;graduated from a mixed high school in 1994. We were in the same
&gt;&gt;school, but separate really. And in those years, the atmosphere was
&gt;&gt;not amicable. From calling ethnic Latvians &quot;gansy&quot;, to &quot;kreivi go
&gt;&gt;home&quot; It was not a pretty sight.

outside about minus 30 Centigrade. The guy ( to make Lorad very unhappy
- a Jewish guy) refused evn a a cup of hot tea because he had few others
to attend.

My sister quit house calls which she attended as social conscience
because people were throwing prescriptions papers into garbage: they
coudn't afford it.

You care about &quot;freedom of&quot; whatever. Dead people do not have any freedom.

You still womder why 70 to 75% of Russia population LOVE Putin?

You Baltics could have become a bridge between Russia and EU. And
capitalize big time on it. You have chosen to become a trouble spot. I
do not believe that the story is over. Time is healing old wounds.
Despite you disgust with recent development in Latvia vs Russia
relations I do think it is positive and not because as you think thta
Russia got an upper hand.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In my personal opinion, that's probably
&gt; not so good, but I can assure you that most young Latvians really do
&gt; not care about what Russians do or are -- there's a whole world out
&gt; there, cultured and wealthy, and no one is particularly interested in
&gt; the _bardak_. If you're 18 years old and looking for a future, you
&gt; learn English and maybe Swedish or whatever and get a decent education
&gt; and davai. Russia just doesn't matter anymore.

&gt; For Latvian Russians things are no doubt more complex. This is an
&gt; identity problem. You can even see it in Internet fora, where some
&gt; supposed &quot;Latvians&quot; or &quot;Latvian citizens&quot; demonstratively use Russian
&gt; though they claim this as their _rodina_. There is no future in that.
&gt; One could well understand the fact that they would rather not subject
&gt; their Great Russian souls to a minor peasant dog language not spoken
&gt; by Pushkin -- no problem! It's just that this country is no longer
&gt; &quot;bilingual&quot; that way, and they end up as the peasants' dogs.

&gt; Are these problems foremost in people's minds? No, not at all. They
&gt; rank way down. Any decent person learns the language and uses it, and
&gt; then no problem.

&gt;&gt;It was true not only on the domestic level, but on the national level
&gt;&gt;as well. The naturalization board created windows for non-citizens to
&gt;&gt;naturalize; the language police fined a Russian media outlet for
&gt;&gt;overdoing it in Russian, etc. etc.

&gt; The windows were created why? Mostly because we feared that the
&gt; Russians would naturalize _en masse_ and swamp the body politic. As we
&gt; can see, even _sans_ windows, there's a rather inert non-minority at
&gt; large. Was naturalization a good thing? Did it work? Most Russians who
&gt; are Latvian citizens are citizens by decent, but we're getting close
&gt; to having a third of the electorate choosing a Russian variety of
&gt; nihilism. If we look hard at the EU referendum, distractions aside, it
&gt; is rather clear that most Latvians look west and most Russians look
&gt; east, and in this we are talking only about citizens and not even
&gt; bringing in people who remain alien two decades after they should have
&gt; woken up and smelled the coffee.

&gt;&gt;Since then, though, things have changed. The so-called naturalization
&gt;&gt;windows are abolished. One can place the sign up in Russian if one
&gt;&gt;wants to (incidentally one newspaper had a competition on a Russian
&gt;&gt;sign); naturalization laws are considered meeting the European
&gt;&gt;standards from both the EU and the Council of Europe.

&gt;&gt;Following years of occupation, it's only natural for the local
&gt;&gt;residents to get angry.

&gt;&gt;But we're not living in 1990s any more.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The problem is it is a way to
&gt;&gt;&gt;nowhere simply because Beria and Stalin are dead.

&gt;&gt;It goes way beyond Stalin and Beria themselves. They might be dead,
&gt;&gt;but we're still sorting out through the pile of crap they left behind
&gt;&gt;-- the Russification polices, deportations, occupation, WW2, etc. And
&gt;&gt;we don't hear the whole lot of condemnation of the Stalin regime from
&gt;&gt;the official Kremlin, which is disheartening to say the least.

&gt; Stalin and Beria died a long time ago, and the USSR changed a lot when
&gt; they did -- it was still the USSR, though. This isn't.

&gt;&gt;&gt;How I see it - many of
&gt;&gt;&gt;your politicians are playing very dirty game - addressing people's pain
&gt;&gt;&gt;memories to get votes. We just saw it in Estonia.

&gt; Here I agree,

&gt; though they claim this as their _rodina_. There is no future in that.
&gt; One could well understand the fact that they would rather not subject
&gt; their Great Russian souls to a minor peasant dog language not spoken
&gt; by Pushkin -- no problem! It's just that this country is no longer
&gt; &quot;bilingual&quot; that way, and they end up as the peasants' dogs.
&gt;
&gt; Are these problems foremost in people's minds? No, not at all. They
&gt; rank way down. Any decent person learns the language and uses it, and
&gt; then no problem.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; It was true not only on the domestic level, but on the national level
&gt;&gt; as well. The naturalization board created windows for non-citizens to
&gt;&gt; naturalize; the language police fined a Russian media outlet for
&gt;&gt; overdoing it in Russian, etc. etc.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The windows were created why? Mostly because we feared that the
&gt; Russians would naturalize _en masse_ and swamp the body politic. As we
&gt; can see, even _sans_ windows, there's a rather inert non-minority at
&gt; large. Was naturalization a good thing? Did it work? Most Russians who
&gt; are Latvian citizens are citizens by decent, but we're getting close
&gt; to having a third of the electorate choosing a Russian variety of
&gt; nihilism. If we look hard at the EU referendum, distractions aside, it
&gt; is rather clear that most Latvians look west and most Russians look
&gt; east, and in this we are talking only about citizens and not even
&gt; bringing in people who remain alien two decades after they should have
&gt; woken up and smelled the coffee.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Since then, though, things have changed. The so-called naturalization
&gt;&gt; windows are abolished. One can place the sign up in Russian if one
&gt;&gt; wants to (incidentally one newspaper had a competition on a Russian
&gt;&gt; sign); naturalization laws are considered meeting the European
&gt;&gt; standards from both the EU and the Council of Europe.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Following years of occupation, it's only natural for the local
&gt;&gt; residents to get angry.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But we're not living in 1990s any more.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem is it is a way to
&gt;&gt;&gt; nowhere simply because Beria and Stalin are dead.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; It goes way beyond Stalin and Beria themselves. They might be dead,
&gt;&gt; but we're still sorting out through the pile of crap they left behind
&gt;&gt; -- the Russification polices, deportations, occupation, WW2, etc. And
&gt;&gt; we don't hear the whole lot of condemnation of the Stalin regime from

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The same reason why some people in Ireland and India still devote
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their entire lives to finding problems and faults with England?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Didn't your mother teach you that it's impolite to respond to a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;question with another question!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is a great difference between India/Ireland and England, some of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which have already been mentioned. Russia is our neighbor and it
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;appears to struggle to come to grips with its Soviet past: from the M-
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;R pact to the &quot;voluntary&quot; inclusion of the Baltic Soviet republics
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;into the Soviet Union, from restoration of a hammer and  a sickle on
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the Victory banner to restoration of the Soviet national anthem.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;According to national polls in Russia, vast majority of Russian
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;citizens believe the Baltic inclusion in the SU was voluntary. That
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;difference often is noted by reading the Russian news media which
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;present anything that's going on in the Baltics in those skewed
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;colors. Until recently, Latvia was considered one of the most hostile
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;countries toward Russia. Now that place occupies Estonia.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So there is a problem of historical perception between the country-
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;colonizer and the natives. No such difference exists between Ireland/
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;India and England.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But for most people on here, it seems, Russia exemplifies the very
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reason why the their fathers had to pack bags and leave their homes
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for Germany, Canada, or the U.S. Russia is the very reason they became
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;displaced persons following World War II. And really can you blame
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them for that? Can you blame someone who's heard horror stories about
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;deportations and killings for developing a paranoia and distrust
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;toward Russia? I can't. It's perfectly legitimate and understandable
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;feeling to have given the circumstances.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Even looking beyond the historical perspective, what happens in
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;today's Russia may have an impact in the Baltics again. Russia-EU
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;relationship bears a direct impact on the three Baltic states, which
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are now members of the EU. Their dependence on Russian sources of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;energy again offers a reason to watch out for the Eastern neighbor.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;soc.culture.baltics is so much more than just about culture. It's also
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;politics and history. It's looking at the past to measure where you'll
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be in the future. It's a conversation. It's a dysfunctional family
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with a couple of nuts thrown in. Raimonds Pauls songs fail in
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;comparison with the deportation of Latvians in 1941 a few weeks before
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Germany attacked the Soviet Union. The existence and role of the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Russian drama theater in Riga doesn't come close in significance to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the role Russia plays among its &quot;compatriots&quot; in Latvia today. With so
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;many scars left from our eastern neighbor on people's daily lives to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the point that some of them (and most of them on this forum) had to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;leave their homes, it's understandably tough to talk about the recent
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kobzon concert in Riga.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Aleks

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Since they regained independence the Baltic countries went down the path
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of counting score to pay back to Russians.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Sure they did. At first. Some of my friends say in the early 1990s
&gt; &gt;&gt;suddenly older ethnic Latvians stopped talking to ethnic Russians. I
&gt; &gt;&gt;graduated from a mixed high school in 1994. We were in the same
&gt; &gt;&gt;school, but separate really. And in those years, the atmosphere was
&gt; &gt;&gt;not amicable. From calling ethnic Latvians &quot;gansy&quot;, to &quot;kreivi go
&gt; &gt;&gt;home&quot; It was not a pretty sight.

&gt; It is a long post you wrote. I can comment on few points. Mercilessly.

&gt; &gt; As you say a bit later, it's only natural. How widespread was this? In
&gt; &gt; my view, not at all.

&gt; I don't know how widespeard it was. But I do know first hand account of
&gt; an old lady to be humiliated at a public bus for reading &quot;Pravda&quot;. Yes,
&gt; &quot;Pravda&quot; is not the right reading. But neither is spitting in old woman
&gt; face under amazing silence of other riders.
&gt; And this old woman was Jewish. She went through similar things in
&gt; Belorussia in times WWII.
&gt; I am not telling you that Balts are born anti-semites or whatever. I am
&gt; saying that making score even with Stalin by picking up on those who
&gt; symbolize your occupation will not heal the wounds, it'll cut your
&gt; country in two pieces.
">

You draw a generic conclusion based on a single freak incident.
Generally speaking, old women -- Jewish or otherwise -- who carry
around Pravda -- or Chas or Vesti Segodnya -- don't get spat on. So in
today's Latvia, I don't see anything similar happening. You will
probably get span on or assaulted if you walk in as a cross-dresser or
a transvestite, but not with Pravda.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;  Then there's basic stats -- back then, one in
&gt; &gt; five Russians here could speak Latvian and all Latvians spoke Russian.
&gt; &gt; This has now shifted to about half of the Russians being able to speak
&gt; &gt; some Latvian (note my careful word choice) and a few younger Latvians
&gt; &gt; not knowing Russian.

&gt; You are today a member of EU. If EU (I don't have data but I am
&gt; absolutely sure) can have a list of endangered spieces, how come it
&gt; doesn't have a list of endangered languages?
&gt; After all it is a mere question of money: learn the language, earn
&gt; money. Sounds obscene? I don't care. Either you want your languages to

&gt; &gt; But -- &quot;counting score to pay back the Russians&quot;? Look, sorry Volodya,

&gt; This is a crap already. I understand that scb is not exactly a perfect
&gt; mirror of the Baltics but still - count how many posts are sent here
&gt; about Russkies vs Balts.

&gt; &gt; You're
&gt; &gt; marginal figures from a fucked up and decrepit empire that we have to
&gt; &gt; deal with, and nothing more.

&gt; For you it's &quot;decrepit empire&quot;, for me - while visiting back in mid
&gt; 90-ties, my friends had in mid winter a child with a severe fever, a
&gt; house call doctor came at nearly ten at night, winter temperature
&gt; outside about minus 30 Centigrade. The guy ( to make Lorad very unhappy
&gt; - a Jewish guy) refused evn a a cup of hot tea because he had few others
&gt; to attend.

&gt; My sister quit house calls which she attended as social conscience
&gt; because people were throwing prescriptions papers into garbage: they
&gt; coudn't afford it.

&gt; You care about &quot;freedom of&quot; whatever. Dead people do not have any freedom.

&gt; You still womder why 70 to 75% of Russia population LOVE Putin?

&gt; You Baltics could have become a bridge between Russia and EU. And
&gt; capitalize big time on it.

I agree with that, only if Russia plays economically fair, but so far
it hasn't. It used economic sanctions -- official or otherwise -- to
impact internal politics of the Baltic countries.

&gt;&gt; By some very accidental circumstances muy family got familiar with a
&gt;&gt; few Jewish people. This woman included.

&gt;&gt; She survived Nazi occupation of Belorussia. If you have a nerve -
&gt;&gt; watch the movie &quot;Go and See&quot;.  It doesn't accentuate the Jewish fate
&gt;&gt; but - you will got an idea. I just advice not to have chldren neither
&gt;&gt; women around. In the ideologiacally charged USSR this movie was taken
&gt;&gt; off the screns, because there is truth but there is an ugly truth:
&gt;&gt; have you seen &quot;Dead Season&quot;? There is a glimpse what Nazi did to
&gt;&gt; Soviet POW. If you don't have a nerve do not watch it. It's has a shot
&gt;&gt; of a documentary from Nazi's, you will not sleep well afterward. Yes,
&gt;&gt; people can do this to people.

&gt;&gt; I don't know where you grow up Rostyk. I grew up in the USSR. like or
&gt;&gt; leave it. I am not to betray these people. Whatever piece of meat you
&gt;&gt; put in front of me. I am not a dog.
&gt;&gt; VM.

&gt; Your outburst is a very strange answer to my question! So I repeat it.
&gt;  I do not understand. What did the old ladys' being Jewish have to do
&gt;  with her reading Pravda?
&gt; You are the one connecting these two facts.
">

And I did it for a very simple reason: when you shoot a bystander you
never know who s/he is. Discriminating en mass is rejected by the
&quot;civilized&quot; world for a very practical reason: fight your enemies but
not multiply them. And in my view that's what Baltics did.

And why you are so jumpy about Jews? All they do is fight for their
place under the sun. Sometimes in dirty ways. You know any ethnic group
which doesn't have a sceleton in its closet?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The same reason why some people in Ireland and India still devote
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their entire lives to finding problems and faults with England?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Didn't your mother teach you that it's impolite to respond to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;question with another question!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is a great difference between India/Ireland and England, some of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which have already been mentioned. Russia is our neighbor and it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;appears to struggle to come to grips with its Soviet past: from the M-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;R pact to the &quot;voluntary&quot; inclusion of the Baltic Soviet republics
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;into the Soviet Union, from restoration of a hammer and  a sickle on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the Victory banner to restoration of the Soviet national anthem.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;According to national polls in Russia, vast majority of Russian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;citizens believe the Baltic inclusion in the SU was voluntary. That
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;difference often is noted by reading the Russian news media which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;present anything that's going on in the Baltics in those skewed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;colors. Until recently, Latvia was considered one of the most hostile
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;countries toward Russia. Now that place occupies Estonia.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So there is a problem of historical perception between the country-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;colonizer and the natives. No such difference exists between Ireland/
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;India and England.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But for most people on here, it seems, Russia exemplifies the very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reason why the their fathers had to pack bags and leave their homes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for Germany, Canada, or the U.S. Russia is the very reason they became
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;displaced persons following World War II. And really can you blame
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them for that? Can you blame someone who's heard horror stories about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;deportations and killings for developing a paranoia and distrust
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;toward Russia? I can't. It's perfectly legitimate and understandable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;feeling to have given the circumstances.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Even looking beyond the historical perspective, what happens in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;today's Russia may have an impact in the Baltics again. Russia-EU
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;relationship bears a direct impact on the three Baltic states, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are now members of the EU. Their dependence on Russian sources of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;energy again offers a reason to watch out for the Eastern neighbor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;soc.culture.baltics is so much more than just about culture. It's also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;politics and history. It's looking at the past to measure where you'll
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be in the future. It's a conversation. It's a dysfunctional family
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with a couple of nuts thrown in. Raimonds Pauls songs fail in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;comparison with the deportation of Latvians in 1941 a few weeks before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Germany attacked the Soviet Union. The existence and role of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Russian drama theater in Riga doesn't come close in significance to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the role Russia plays among its &quot;compatriots&quot; in Latvia today. With so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;many scars left from our eastern neighbor on people's daily lives to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the point that some of them (and most of them on this forum) had to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;leave their homes, it's understandably tough to talk about the recent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kobzon concert in Riga.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Aleks

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Since they regained independence the Baltic countries went down the path
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of counting score to pay back to Russians.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sure they did. At first. Some of my friends say in the early 1990s
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;suddenly older ethnic Latvians stopped talking to ethnic Russians. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;graduated from a mixed high school in 1994. We were in the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;school, but separate really. And in those years, the atmosphere was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not amicable. From calling ethnic Latvians &quot;gansy&quot;, to &quot;kreivi go
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;home&quot; It was not a pretty sight.

&gt;&gt;It is a long post you wrote. I can comment on few points. Mercilessly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;As you say a bit later, it's only natural. How widespread was this? In
&gt;&gt;&gt;my view, not at all.

&gt;&gt;I am not telling you that Balts are born anti-semites or whatever. I am
&gt;&gt;saying that making score even with Stalin by picking up on those who
&gt;&gt;symbolize your occupation will not heal the wounds, it'll cut your
&gt;&gt;country in two pieces.

&gt;&gt;For you it's &quot;decrepit empire&quot;, for me - while visiting back in mid
&gt;&gt;90-ties, my friends had in mid winter a child with a severe fever, a
&gt;&gt;house call doctor came at nearly ten at night, winter temperature
&gt;&gt;outside about minus 30 Centigrade. The guy ( to make Lorad very unhappy

&gt;&gt;You Baltics could have become a bridge between Russia and EU. And
&gt;&gt;capitalize big time on it.

&gt; I agree with that, only if Russia plays economically fair, but so far
&gt; it hasn't. It used economic sanctions -- official or otherwise -- to
&gt; impact internal politics of the Baltic countries.

You have EU, use it. Russians maybe playing dirty but only as long as it
is in their interest. As soon as EU steps in Russia policies become very
cautious. However my impression is that you almost alienated the big
players in EU by bypassing them in such major decisions as endless
scandals with Russia and Iraq. At least an appearence is that you regard
EU as temporal shelter but your real ally is accross the ocean. I see
nothing wrong with being gratefull to the US, but not at a price of
attacking EU as you did with Vilnius declaration.

Peteris stumped me right here. I couldn't understand why the fact that
Britain is still occupying part of Ireland by force, that the natives
(Catholic Irish) still don't accept this occupation, and that the
occupiers (Protestants) are happy with their  dominance of the foreign
land - why all this proves that Britain's treatment of Ireland is
better than Russia's, who voluntarily gave away all of Baltics.

Peteris asked me if the Russians will be as good as the British and

My answer is: yes, Stalin's 1940 occupation of Baltics will be taught
in all Russian schools by year 2027, if it is not already being
taught.

&gt;&gt; trying to provoke me as a Jew?

&gt;&gt; - because rusty is a mild anti-semite. don't you know?

&gt; Of course I do. However, by Lviv standards he is highly tolerant.

he's mild by most standards. one gets the impression that he possesses what
he probably considers a &quot;healthy&quot; dose of anti-semitism. i don't think that
he would ever truly want to cause any harm or hatred to jews. compare him to
guys like serwad. mind you, who really cares what serwad thinks whereas
rusty's opinion does carry weight. maybe that's why he makes you feel
defensive when serwad is so easily ignored.

&gt;&gt; That's the spirit: every case on its merits.  Alles relativ ist.

&gt; Or, as they say in Germany, &quot;alles ist relativ&quot;.

phrase and claim that he knows how to speak german. :)

&gt; And when it comes to the Republic -- well, Tony Blair, 1997: &quot;The
&gt; [1840s Irish potato] famine was a defining event in the history of
&gt; Ireland and Britain. It has left deep scars. That one million people
&gt; should have died in what was then part of the richest and most
&gt; powerful nation in the world is something that still causes pain as we
&gt; reflect on it today. Those who governed in London at the time failed
&gt; their people.&quot;

The same guy who then went along with th enterprise that led to over

&gt; Back to India. Jack Straw wrote in the guest book at Amritsar, re the
&gt; 1919 massacre -- &quot;This was a terrible occasion in which so many
&gt; innocents were slaughtered, for which I feel shame and sorrow.&quot;

Yes, it's great to shed tears once nothing can be changed and
everything has been taken and spent long ago.  Maybe in 87 years some
British or American dignitary in Baghdad will write a similar note in
a guest book and that will show the humaneness of their respective
nations.

- good point. but still; better later than never right?

But then Britain created all the problems in Ireland when they started
forced resettlement of Protestant Scots into the area.

Britain can also take all the credit for creating all the problems in the
middle east.
