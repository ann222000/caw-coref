This  is an old but  good article. It came out right after Arlo's
&quot;trial.&quot; Some one just sent it to me. I saw it when it first came out.
But it's  good to bring you up to date and what John will probably
face. People keep saying that Arlo confessed to dozens of people.  I
keep asking for names, but no one actually knows anyone that actually
HEARD Arlo's confession. It's like Two Elf's gun in her mouth crap. I
asked him if he saw that happen. He didn't. That's another FBI myth
like Arlo's confession. Cointelpro.  You keep repeating a lie until
people  believe it. You watch Two Elf and you can see him doing that.
He's a fascinating study of an idiot controlled by the fbi.

Arlo Looking Cloud Interview
February 2004
Pennington County Jail
Rapid City, South Dakota
http://www.dlncoalition.org/arlo_looking_cloud_interview.htm
by David Seals

&quot;It was a set-up, Man, all the way,&quot; Arlo said, in the first of
several 10-minute collect phone calls he made from the Pennington
County Jail in Rapid City, where he's awaiting an April 23 mandatory
life sentence for his February 6 conviction of the murder of Anna Mae
Aquash in 1975. &quot;Who were they covering up for? They're covering up
for someone.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; I asked.

&quot;I don't know.&quot;

Later that night we were allowed a 20-minute face-to-face talk on
telephones with a glass window between us, in Cellblock Two, booth 2B.
We got into that all-important matter of &quot;Who&quot; again: for if he didn't
kill her then who did? His Trial had shown a police videotape with him
confessing to it, and several witnesses swore under oath he told them
he'd done it. It was much less clear what he thought the role of John
Graham was in all of it, as the U.S. Prosecution claims. Graham is a
Canadian Native awaiting Extradition to South Dakota as a co-accused
in the 1st degree homicide charge.

&quot;Yeah, so, they were covering up, but who were they covering up for,
you mean?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Well, I know who was covering up, my lawyer Tim Rensch. He was in
collusion with the Government.&quot;

We slowly got around to the damning police videotape that was shown in
court, of an interrogation of Arlo in the Denver Police Dept. on March
27,2003, in which he confessed to it and said Graham pulled the
trigger. What was noticeable about the tape, as I watched it in horror
in the U.S. Federal Court in the 4-day trial Feb. 3-6, was that he was
almost incoherent, and the police were asking a lot of leading
questions. And he had no lawyer present. &quot;What about the videotape?&quot;

He grinned at me behind the glass, a handsome fullblood Lakota with
classic Sitting Bull good looks and long black hair. &quot;I was drunk.
They were giving me drugs and alcohol Abe Alonzo, the big Denver cop
who's going around acting like a hero, claiming he captured me, knew
where I was every day. He met me at the liquor store every day and
bought me the booze, and gave me drugs. I was really into Chiba. You
know what Chiba is?&quot; he grinned again, giving me a hard con's eye
stare.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Heroin. I loved that stuff. He was getting it for me. All I wanted.&quot;

&quot;So the videotape and confession ...&quot;

&quot;They were all fucked up. I told Rensch that, but he didn't use it in
court. Rensch didn't use a lot of questions I asked him to. I told him
a lot of stuff but he didn't use it in the trial I don't know why. I
didn't even see a witness list until the last day, and they had a mock-
trial back in December, December 16 I think, to practice everything,
but I didn't even get a copy of the questionnaires. I didn't know
anything. They didn't tell me anything. &quot;

And how did John Graham's name ever come up?

&quot;That's where Ecoffey perjured himself on the Stand.&quot; {Robert Ecoffey
is the U.S. Marshall who originally brought Looking Cloud's and
Graham's names out 10 years ago, and he testified at the trial} &quot;He
said Gladys Bissonnette and Al Gates first told him my name in 1994.
No. No. It was Pat Janis, his close relative who told Ecoffey. Pat is
married to Angie Begay. Angie Begay is a Navajo woman who was married
to John Graham back in the 70s. Maybe it was some jealous woman's
thing that got all this started, I'm not sure. There's always a lot of
gossip around Pine Ridge and Indian Country. Angie was also married to
Dennis Banks, did you know that? They had a daughter, Arrow Banks,
she's a grown woman now.&quot;

&quot;Angie Begay also testified in the trial, didn't she? Yeah, she's the
one who said she saw Annie Mae tied to a board and carrried out of the
Denver house of Troy Lynn Yellow Wood.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;But Troy Lynn herself testified she didn't see Annie tied up or
anything. She left willingly on her own. And that's when you and John
and Theda Clark took Annie to Pine Ridge?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guess so. I didn't know her or John very well.&quot; He just shook
his head like it was all bullshit. His lawyer said in court Arlo went
to visit a friend Tony Red Cloud in Rapid City and wasn't even with
Annie after they dropped her off at a safe house on Pine Ridge, 100
miles away from Rapid City. &quot;I never saw her again, or even John Boy,
I don't think. I'm not sure.&quot;

&quot;You never saw them again, after you dropped Annie off at a house on
Pine Ridge?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

It was all pretty contradictory to what had come out in court, and he
could see I was confused. &quot;Richard Two Elk. Who's he? He has said for
years you told him you and John killed her?&quot;

&quot;I barely knew him.&quot;

&quot;He said he was your brother and you grew up on the reservation all
your life?&quot;

Arlo laughed. &quot;He's lying about everything. I barely knew him. We
never grew up together or anything else. I'd run into him in Denver a
few times at my Aunt's {Troy Lynn} and we'd go outside and smoke a
joint and then go back inside. That was all. We never talked. You
know, he was always going around tape-recording everybody, why doesn't
he have a tape of me or anybody else? He doesn't know anything.&quot;

&quot;He testified and said he was with you when you talked to Annie's
daughter on the phone, Denise Maloney from Nova Scotia, and told her
you killed Annie, you and John Boy killed her?&quot;

Arlo shook his head. &quot;I don't even remember that. I couldn't believe
it when I heard it in court.&quot;

&quot;Two Elk said, and Denise testified too, that they called her. Paul
Demain called her and said you wanted to talk to her, and he vouched
for it and Demain vouched for Two Elk that he was Arlo's trusted
brother. So Denise and her sister Debbie got on the phone.&quot;

Arlo shook his head. &quot;Set-up. Same with John Trudell {a longtime AIM
leader who also testified Arlo told him he'd killed Annie}. Me and my
Aunt went up to his hotel room {in Denver in 1988} and his bodyguard
said, uh, we can go outside and smoke a doob. So we went down to the
street, to his car or something. Trudell, you know, in court he looked
to me like he was coming down from the morning's high. He was sweating
and nervous.&quot;

Arlo also wanted to tell me about several startling visits he'd had
after the trial from FBI agents and other government lawyers. They
wanted him to sign affidavits on other suspects but he refused to sign
anything. He said he thought one of the lawyers, a tall man in a suit,
was the notorious 1970s COINTELPRO double-agent Douglas Durham.

&quot;Are you sure it was him?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, pretty sure. We'd all seen him around a lot in AIM. He was
tall.&quot;

It all went back, in the end, to that question of &quot;Who&quot;. Why did the
U.S. Attorney McMahon raise the issue of Leonard Peltier so much in
the trial, putting irrelevant witnesses like Kamook Banks on the
stand? She last saw Anna Mae Aquash alive in November 1975, well
before even the Government said she was killed by Graham and Looking
Cloud and Clark on December 12. But Kamook implicated Peltier all over
again in the deaths of 2 FBI agents at a famous shootout on Pine Ridge
a few months before Aquash turned up dead. The Trial inflamed local
anit-Indian and anti-AIM feelings, including in the jury, by bringing
up Peltier's name and the whole history of AIM's stormy involvement
with the FBI.

Local Indian sentiment in South Dakota pretty much agrees with Arlo
Looking Cloud's feelings, that he didn't get a fair trial and that
justice has not even begun to be served for Anna Mae. They point to
the fact that the defense lawyer only called one witness for the
defense, and that was an FBI agent; whereas the prosecution called 23
witnesses against Looking Cloud and Graham. Indians wonder why Theda
Clark hasn't been charged and arrested too. They wonder why family
members weren't called to testify about Arlo's character and heritage,
and finally, why Arlo himself was not allowed to testify on his own
behalf.

&quot;Rensch wouldn't let me talk, Man. He wouldn't let me testify at my
own trial.&quot;

Are you and E-lie allying against me? That's funny. Are you no longer
calling him a Black Heart? Yeah, I told  you I talked to my nephews
about E-lie. I was worried about my mom because he came into her yard.
You said  that was a good idea. I told you I was trying to get a copy
of a photo of him from his ex-girlfriend. You asked for a copy of it
because that would help you in your work. My problem  with  E-lie is
over wicca. There was a spiritual war here between the Seashepherd
witches and Indians. E-lie chose to stand on the side of the witches.
He's  like you. Can't let go. How far is it from casting spells to
kill someone to taking a shotgun and blowing someone away? You don't
believe in standing  up to feds or white people in general do you
little elf. Be a good lap dog and climb back in their lap.

Well, how do you get away with threatening to  kill Leonard and John
on a public discussion list? It would seem that those men in white
jackets you keep yelling for would have hauled you away. Or the feds
would have come to arrest  you for threatening murder on a public
list. You said you never get traffic tickets because there is a
special mark on your driver's license. When cops see that they let
you go. It says UC. You said it means undercover. You talk a lot when
you're stoned. Oops!

What's nutz is your phony entrance and performance at Arlo's trial.
It'd be great to have an audio of the audience, judge, cops,lawyers,
and jury laughing at your bs  - not to mention Arlo's corroborated
statements to me in the PCJ that he barely knew you, and he sure as
hell wouldn't have &quot;confessed&quot; to someone like you.
