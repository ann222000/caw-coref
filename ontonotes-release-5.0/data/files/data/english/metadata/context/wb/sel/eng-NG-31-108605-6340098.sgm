If the specter of another US foray into regime change disturbs
you, google the word "Tanter." If the prospect of another
country's being bombarded with US weapons outrages you, and if
inserting the adjective "nuclear" into the narrative sends a
chill up your spine, go to the "Guardian" website and search
"Tanter." Or if you hanker to find out what a Robust Nuclear
Earth Penetrator can do to humankind, click onto the Union of
Concerned Scientists.

But if you want to take a stand against another US/Israeli war
crime, don't come to Ann Arbor. Not unless you're prepared for
the worst. Unless you're prepared to be brutalized by the cops,
thrown in jail, and subjected to improper and punitive medical
treatment, you'd better keep your mouth shut. Or so the
University of Michigan, the Ann Arbor Police, and the Zionist
forces in the community would have it.

When I became a doctor I knew I would encounter a lot of human
suffering, but I never envisioned a time when my efforts to
alleviate it would get me brutalized by the police, then charged
with a crime. I never envisioned a time when I would witness
another health "professional" brazenly violate the most
fundamental principle of medical ethics: first do no harm. But
thirty years after graduation, at a political event on the
campus of the University of Michigan, those things happened.

The event was a presentation by Raymond Tanter, founder of the
Iran Policy Committee and former member of the National Security
Council under Ronald Reagan. Michigan's chapter of the Zionist
organization, the American Movement for Israel (AMI), brought
him to town on November 30, 2006 to whip up support for regime
change in Iran. The "Islamo-fascist regime" must be overthrown,
according to Tanter, before they acquire a nuclear weapon, and
one option for stopping them would be nuking them first. Some of
the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrators the US has supplied to
Israel would be OK, with Israel doing the deed.

A small group of folks showed up to protest. The room was
packed, U of M cops were on hand, and the atmosphere was tense.
Tanter fired up the crowd, especially when he declared that
Israel will exist forever, triggering the longest and most
boisterous of several rounds of cheering and applause from his
supporters. But interruptions of dissent were not to be allowed,
and the cops were there to make sure of it. One of the
protesters, an Iranian woman, became the first target of the
political repression in store for the night. At the behest of
one of the AIM organizers, a U of M cop proceeded to remove her.

The cop, maybe 6'6 or bigger, grabbed her arm, dragging her to
the floor, where he applied pressure point control tactics
(PPCT) as she screamed. PPCT is what's called a pain compliance
technique, using the infliction of pain to force someone to do
what you order. It's used against someone who poses a serious
threat of physical harm; someone, say, who's in the cop's grip,
clutching a knife and on the verge of stabbing a person. In this
case, the cop inflicted pain to force compliance with his order
to stand up, while he pinned her to the floor with his knee. She
kept screaming.

"Don't hurt her," called out the woman who'd been sitting in the
next seat over, also an Iranian woman, a U of M Professor of
Iranian History, in fact, and another dissenting voice at the
event. One of the other protesters came to the first victim's
aid and was hauled away, cuffed and arrested. A second protester
came to the victim's aid and followed as she was hauled away.
The AMI organizers were calling the shots.

I heard a commotion in the hall and stepped out of the room. In
the hall I saw the same huge cop on top of the second protester
who'd come to the first victim's aid. The cop had the man, a
relatively small guy in his forties, pinned down, arms pulled
behind his back, getting handcuffed. The cop used PPCT against
this person also, not once but twice. The man writhed and cried
out in pain.

The cop used his far-greater strength and body weight, along
with the force of his knee on his victim's back to press his
chest against the floor. It would be impossible for a person to
inflate his lungs pressed against the floor with his hands
cuffed behind his back like that. Asphyxiation being a well-
known cause of death of people in custody, when the man started
calling out that he couldn't breathe, I approached, identified
myself as a doctor, and instructed the cop to turn him over
immediately. The victim went limp. The cop turned him onto his
back. I saw that the victim had a wound on his forehead and
blood in his nostrils. He was unconscious.

Reiterating numerous times that I was a doctor, I tried to move
to where I could assess the victim for breathing and a pulse.
The cop shoved me, until finally, after my imploring him to
allow me to render medical care to the victim, he allowed me to
determine that the victim was alive. But he refused to remove
the cuffs despite my requests. A person lying with hands cuffed
beneath his body risks nerve damage to the extremities and,
moreover, cannot be resuscitated. I continually re-assessed the
man, who had now become my patient, and who remained unconscious.

Eventually an ambulance arrived, along with the fire department
and a contingent of Ann Arbor police officers. While the
paramedics went about their business, the first thing being to
have the cop un-cuff the patient, I tried to fulfill my
obligation to my patient. I tried to oversee what the paramedics
were doing, which, contrary to protocol and the normal
relationship between physician and paramedic, was all that I was
allowed to do. I was forced to stay away. What I witnessed in
the course of their treatment appalled me.

When the patient didn't respond to a sternal rub, one of the
paramedics popped an ammonia inhalant and thrust it beneath the
patient's nostrils. If you're interested in what's wrong with
that, google Dr. Bryan Bledsoe, foremost authority on
paramedicine, and read his article condemning this dangerous
practice. That it's "just bad medicine" is sufficient to make
the paramedic's actions unacceptable, but what happened next
made my blood curdle. He popped a second inhalant and a third,
then cupped his hands over the patient's nostrils to heighten
the noxious effect. "You don't like that, do you?" he said.

At that point I issued a direct medical order for him to stop,
but he ignored me. "What you're doing is punitive," I said, "and
has no efficacy." Then as the patient retched, rather than
rolling him onto his side to avoid the chance of his choking on
his own vomit, a firefighter held his feet down and yelled,
"don't spit." In thirty years of doctoring, I have never
witnessed such egregious maltreatment of a patient. Again I
spoke up, "this is punitive." I hoped to shame the paramedical
into stopping his unethical behavior.

Suddenly an Ann Arbor cop ordered me to move away. As I headed
for my purse and coat, the cop attacked me from behind, twisted
my arms with extreme force behind my back, and shoved me against
the wall. I begged him to release my left arm, explaining that I
had a serious condition affecting my shoulder, and pleading with
him because of the excruciating pain he was inflicting on me. I
told him that I would do whatever he demanded. I told him that I
had been in the process of complying with his order to move out
of the way and that I was heading toward where my purse and coat
were. He told me to relax and wrenched my arms harder. I was in
agony. I told him that I would sit down, anything, that he was
really hurting me and begged him to release my arm. Eventually
he let my arms down.

But his brutality did not stop there. He then forced me to stand
in the stairwell in a corner for a protracted period of time. I
asked him if I could please go home, as I was in pain, and I was
deeply traumatized. In yet another raw display of abuse of
power, he forced me to stand there, causing me ongoing suffering
and humiliation, before finally allowing me to leave.

The U of M proceeded with prosecution of the other three people,
but I heard nothing further from them until I filed a complaint
of police brutality. Now I'm facing criminal prosecution, too,
along with the Professor of Iranian History, who, like me, was
charged after she filed a complaint. We five are being
prosecuted for "assaulting/resisting/obstructing" police
officers, and in my case, for "assaulting/resisting/obstructing"
paramedics as well.

So, if you want to take a stand against another war, don't come
to Ann Arbor. Don't come unless you believe in the slogan the
Wobblies chanted back at the time of the First World War, when
the government was rounding up opponents of that atrocity and
throwing them in jail. Don't come to Ann Arbor unless you too
believe: AN INJURY TO ONE IS AN INJURY TO ALL.
