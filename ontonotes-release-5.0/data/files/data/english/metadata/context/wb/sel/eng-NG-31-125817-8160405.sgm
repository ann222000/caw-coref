On all my previous cars, I've used a brake bleeding kit powered by a
compressor when changing the brake fluid every two years....

basically I fill a bottle with brake fluid, connect air compressor to said
bottle which is in turn connected to the brake fluid reservoir, and I can
just open all four brake nipples on all four wheels to purge out old brake
fluid  till new fluid comes through. No assistant needed to pump brake
pedal.

Now my current car is the first car I've ever owned that has a hydraulic
clutch.

Are pressure bleeding kits ok for use on hydraulic clutches?

If not is there a more effective method than that outlined in the Haynes
book of lies?

Hydraulic clutches work in an identical way to the brakes, so can't
think of any good reason why the pressure bleeder should not be used.

I've always found clutches to be much easier to bleed than brakes and
obviously less critical. Just open the bleed nipple and the fluid flows
out under gravity.
