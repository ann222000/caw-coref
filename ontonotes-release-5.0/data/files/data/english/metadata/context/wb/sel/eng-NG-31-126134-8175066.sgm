Anybody listen to Parental Advisory? I was jus listenin to &quot;ghetto
street funk&quot; and  I am very much likin what im hearing. PA reminds me
of goodie mob but this album is a little better than &quot;soul food&quot;. I
cant believe i slept on them for so long. Organized noise really
hooked this shit up. They managed to eclectically mix mad music styles
into this joint without fuckin up the sound. i think mello is the one
in the crew I like.  His nasally congested ass is brilliant on that
&quot;lifeline&quot; joint.

I wonder why wasn't &quot;ticket for 2&quot; on the new camp lo? The album is
good but most of the dope tracks I heard already. I was also expectin
a little more than just 12 tracks. The fact they drop an album every
five years leaves more to be desired.  This felt more like a mixtape
than the fort apache joint for some reason. However it is refreshing
tho that they maintain the same formula wit each release. If it ain't
broke don't fix it

I came to the realization that pharell needs to rap more.  hes
actually kinda dope when hes not tryin to be a hip hop kenny
lattimore. Everytime he flows I always find myself listening. Its not
that he says anything exceptionally dope or notworthy but hes mad
entertaining. &quot;enough wit the accolades ma whats up wit your panties.&quot;
His arrogant rich kid vibe actually works in a pimped out zack morris
way. I havn't checked out his solo album tho but I have this naggin
suspicion its wack so ima pass.

I am so fucking sick of that swizz beats song that gets mad run lately
that has rkelly and weezy on it. That has got to be officially the
worst beat I have ever heard. Swizz is gonna be the end of mainstream
rap at the rate hes going.  all the siren sounds in the world cant
cover up the fact that shits a wack xylophone beat. Why does all of
swizz's beats sound like a high school marching band about to
spontaneously combust?  And im goin to say this again.... r kelly needs
to just stop. Its really not funny anymore..... I wont think any more
less of you than I already do if you jus go back to singing again...
Please Robert!
Its sad how heads seem to accept anything as dope these days. Its
unfortunate, the streets don't really say whats hot....its basically
funkmaster flex and his band of dj cronies.

Aight yall im done. Peace.

Better than &quot;Soul Food&quot;? That's a bold claim. &quot;GSF&quot;
was nice although I prefer albums number 2 and 3.
Whatever happened to them?

Yeah I know but I really do feel this album a little more than &quot;soul
food&quot;.  I jus like that gritty organic sound that's stays throughout
the album. Not to take anything from &quot;soul food&quot;, cause the conscious
verbiage that had isn't on ghetto street funk but I still like it for
its visceral quality. The production was before ON had cultivated
their signature sound too so it was a lot harder and raw. how an album
should be.

i downloaded a couple songs that i liked a while back (off cocaine
blunts, i think), but never really followed up.  i got the witchdoctor
album and the cool breeze album last year though.  the witchdoctor was a
bit underwhelming (&quot;holiday&quot; set a really high bar for me), but the cool
breeze was excellent.
