Yesterday we hosted a family birthday party  for my sister in law. She had
offered to reimburse us for all the costs if he did it at our house. She
even offered to pay for a cleaning lady, though we declined that part of the
offer and did the cleanup ourselves.  They were to bring wine.  It worked
out great. While it rained in the morning, it cleared up by mid afternoon
and we were able to entertain on the patio.

We started off with drinks and tortilla chips and salsa before going for a
walk in the fields behind the house.  When we got back we had  smoked salmon
on pumpernickel with  capers sliced red onion.  It was my home made smoked
salmon and everyone raved over it.  Then we had  BBQed shrimp. After a short
breather we  BBQed strip steaks, which all turned out very nice, which was a
bonus because I hate cooking steaks for other people.  Sil did not want a
cake but requested that I make ice cream, so we had ice cream and brownies.
After dessert we had a selection of 5 cheeses from the new local cheese
shop.  After that, a big plate of chocolates.

Food was great, the weather cooperated and everyone seemed to have a good
time. My big fear was that this family includes the infamous big niece....
the one who eats non-stop and who also goes snooping through my pantry and
helps herself to whatever she finds, and that includes taking it upon
herself to open new boxes. I had told my wife ahead of time to keep the
niece out of the kitchen and, better yet, out of the house.  We were
somewhat successful there.  The only problem was that she and her husband
went to town to get some cheese while we went for the walk, and they
returned before we did and she came out of the house with a fresh drink and
munching on something.

The rule of thumb when the big niece comes is that we have to prepare twice
as much food.  Since her mother was paying for everything I got lots I
didn't care how much she ate..... as long as she didn't go snooping in my
pantry.

Towards the end of the evening the niece started getting obnoxious.  She had
had several Rye and gingerales and then started swilling wine, first the
white wine with the salmon and shrimp and then red wine with dinner.... and
dessert, and after dessert. Eventually her husband asked me to put the wine
away because she was making an ass of herself.  So she started eating
more...... brownies, chocolate and cheese. She eventually ate herself sick.
That surprised me. I thought she had a bottomless pit.

Have you ever considered spreading a little sweet mustard

Well, now you know that at least one person is capable of being
embarrassed by her actions and she does have a food limit.  Isn't it
nice to not feel like you're going to blow a gasket after a family
party?  Maybe the secret to family parties at your house is to have
your SIL pay for the food, so you can make enough to satisfy your
niece.

That could be the secret, though it took a lot of food and drink to reach
that limit. However, I also had to request that my wife to be on guard and
not let the niece into the kitchen unguarded. It really bothers me that I
have to be so wary of her  rooting around in my pantry and helping herself
to things in there, even opening sealed boxes when there is a buffet on the
table.  For the life of me I cannot understand any normal guest at a party
sneaking off to the kitchen and opening a new box of something and cramming
into her maw when the same thing or similar items are already on the table.

I remember hearing about your niece before, Dave. I have to wonder
why someone close to her (your SIL or her husband, for example)
doesn't suggest she go into therapy. She's not eating because she's
hungry by any means. She's sick and needs help. That being said, I
know that suggesting she seek help doesn't mean she'll do it, but
I'm surprised they don't try. Or maybe they have..?

Wow, is she still at that?

She has an eating disorder and in her muddled mind if other people don't
see her eating the food, it doesn't count.  I used to have a very obese
friend (clinically labeled &quot;morbidly obese&quot;). Every time she went to
town to the grocery store she would buy an &quot;extra&quot; package of Oreos or
dozen doughnuts and eat them by herself on the way home.  This was a six
mile trip, not a trek into the wilderness.  It's a mental illness.

You're right. She was pretty tame this time. Her mother paid for the food,
so I prepared lots, and they brought the wine. The only thing that I was
worried about was the pantry raids, and I told my wife to make sure that
she was responsible for keeping her niece out of the kitchen, with a very
firm warning that if I caught her raiding the pantry I was definitely going
to confront her.

I have to wonder about her embarrassment.  I don't know if she sneaks food
because she is embarrassed to let people know how much she eats or if it is
some sort of game she plays, sort of like shoplifting for cheap thrills.
And I am not talking about helping herself to a glass of milk or an piece
of fruit. I am talking about opening boxes of cookies and crackers in the
pantry, even when there is already ample food laid out on the table.  This
is the girl who showed up unexpected at the home of her step sister who was
expecting guests for dinner and ate all the food before the invited guests
arrived.

It's just plain rude, Dave, but then you know that already.  She obviously

lock it the door and hide the key in your bedroom.  Then be prepared to snap

I think that the sad thing is that she really doesn't care.  I had to zip
my lip the other day when she was telling me how much she admires me
because of my interest in cooking and my culinary skills and how it is her
passion. Obsession would be more accurate.

Putting a lock on the panty would be difficult because it is a long shallow
closet with a set of bifold doors and it would lead me to explain why I
lock it. I should be able to just confront the woman and tell her to stay
the hell of of my pantry and out of my fridge..... and while she is at
it..... park her fat ass away from the buffet so that someone else can get
to the table and find some food. It is a pain in the ass to spend hours
preparing for a family gathering and then have her show up early and
proceed to eat up everything there before the others arrive.  I don't want
to have to put things out a bit at a time. I would prefer to spend time
with the rest of the guests. I don't have an extra fridge and room to keep
the stuff, and I should not have to.

This past event was organized a little differently. She and her husband
showed up a little earlier than others. We kept them outside talking until
the others showed up. Then I herded everyone out to the patio and escorted
her to the seat in the corner so that it would be too much effort for her
to get out and past everyone else.  After our walk in the back I brought
out one thing at a time, made sure that she got some and then placed it at
the less crowded end of the table, passing it to her whenever she asked,
but not leaving anything close enough that she could scarf it back before
the others had some.

Personally, I would prefer not to have her in my house, but it was a family
party, and in honour of her mother's birthday.  We never invite her and her
husband on their own, have excuses prepared in case they try to invite
themselves.  We no longer have family Christmas parties here because my
stand was that if we had to invite her we weren't having it.

I know that she has a problem. It is not my problem. her mother knows she
has a problem. She is 48 &lt;?&gt;. She thinks of herself as a BBW, not the FFS
the rest of us see her as.

Mark - You and I know, that is a gawd awful thought!  Unfortunately
the internet is in it's Wild Wild West days, with newsgroups being the
most wild of all.  However, Dave should preface his statements with a
comment like, &quot;One of our neighbors who had dropped by, told me such
and such about my neice, but I don't really remember who that neighbor
was, because I was drinking too.&quot;  Afterall, it appears third party
libel is protected on the internet, and if you claim to be too drunk
to remember what neighbor told you, then the neighbor is protected
too!

Alas, the internet - it will be awhile, before it is tamed and

A good story teller is a rare commodity indeed.  When you stop to
think about it, all of life is only a fantasy, a version, or a
&quot;reality&quot; - as filtered through someone's perceptions.  If you don't
believe it, place several artists in front of an Oak tree, and watch
how different each canvas will end as filtered through the artists'
view.

Some in life are dealing with only an 8 pack of Crayolas - others are
gifted with a full 64 pack.  I hope to spend as much time as possible
with those folks possessing the 64 packs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Towards the end of the evening the niece started getting obnoxious.
She had

the

dinner.... and
&gt; dessert, and after dessert. Eventually her husband asked me to put
the wine

eating

herself sick.
&gt; That surprised me. I thought she had a bottomless pit.

I remember hearing about your niece before, Dave. I have to wonder
why someone close to her (your SIL or her husband, for example)
doesn't suggest she go into therapy. She's not eating because she's
hungry by any means. She's sick and needs help. That being said, I
know that suggesting she seek help doesn't mean she'll do it, but
I'm surprised they don't try. Or maybe they have..?

Yes, it does sound interesting, but she has this obsession with food and it
would probably be in her best interests to come to grips with the problem
and to avoid temptation.

She made a go of a jam and jelly business. Some of them were pretty good
but she was selling them for $6.95 and we were getting pressure to buy some
to help her out. That was about 10 years ago when I could buy jams at local
fruit stands for $3-4 if I needed it. But I didn't need to buy any because
I make my own jam and usually make enough that I end up giving it away. I
didn't see any benefit to me giving away more of my jam to make room for
her overpriced product.

He is a big guy. He is about 6'3&quot; (or 4?) and about 350. He does not eat
and drink like she does.  The funny thing is that he is supposed to be a
writer but he used to work as a courier truck driver since she won her
Million he works part time for an auto parts outlet.  The one time I went
to their house I planned to look through their library for the books I
suspect that she &quot;borrowed&quot; from my house. He has an extensive collection
of books about cars, racing, military stuff, planes and all of the books
were picture books. There were no novels, not non fiction (other than
picture books). That seemed strange for someone who is supposed to have
taken journalism and aspires to being a writer.

Looking through the list, it's obvious that any conceivable sexual
deviance that one can even imagine, there's not only someone out there
who that's their thing, but there's a NG dedicated to it.  There's a
group called, alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.plumpers.  It's right
between a.b.p.e.plumbers and a.b.p.e.plushies, whatever a plushie is.
Someone(s) has a fetish for plumbers.

I am not allowed to take pictures of her anymore. I used to take pictures

She is not as enormous as you might expect, and the issue is not her
size.... until she sat on her husband's knee while he was seated in an
expensive leather swivel chair. It just ain't built for close to 700 lb.
My issue with her is that she eats so much. She can clear a buffet single
handed and still sneak through the pantry when she thinks no one is looking
and open up boxes.... even boxes of crackers when there are already some of
the same crackers on the buffet.  YOu don't need to steal food when it is

She has a soft spot for her because she was her first niece and swallowed
the excuse that the girl was premature and force fed as a baby so never
learned to turn off her hunger. As I indicated, my son suggested that it is
not easy to get a picture of her not eating because she is always always
eating. He stayed with her overnight once and told me about a trip to the
grocery store where she stopped at a convenience store and bought a large
bag of chips and ate them all on the way to the grocery store, then stopped
at the convenience store on the way home  and bought a second large bag of
potato chips that she ate before they got home. That is two large bags of
potato chips consumed during a trip to the grocery stores. Don't you find
that alarming?

&gt; &gt; My issue with her is that she eats so much. She can clear a buffet single

&gt; &gt; the same crackers on the buffet.  YOu don't need to steal food when it is
&gt; &gt; being offered for free.

&gt; I seem to recall a comic book from my childhood
&gt; which was mostly about a girl who was constantly
&gt; eating.

&gt; Ah, yes.  Thank you, Wikipedia.

I remember that comic.  She is not exactly like that.  She would never
order such a huge serving in one shot. She would have a small one and eat
it very daintily,  and then another, and another and another.

As we all know from past threads, this girl/woman has serious mental
issues related to food.  Untreated, she will probably eat herself to
death.

Why do you need a picture of her?  It is not her size that bothers me. The
problem with her size is that she is apparently self conscious about her
weight.  She has every reason to be self conscious about it. She is huge.
She is surprisingly not so huge as you might expect, considering how much
she eats.... but still huge.  It is the fact that he is a compulsive eater,
one who goes through a buffet table and lays it bare like a swarm of
locusts. The last time she was here I saw here lay into the devilled eggs.
She did not take one or two and move on. She stood there and ate them one
after another, a dozen eggs.... times two... 24 devilled eggs, and then she
slid over to the cheese tray and nibbled on that until several pounds of
cheese was gone. Granted, a few people got in there and cut off a piece of
cheese or two and moved on, but this niece stood there and nibbled until it
was all gone..... then moved to the cold cuts. And then I catch her opening
a box of crackers my pantry. Crackers for gawd's sake. There were crackers
on the table. Why did she need to open crackers? .... because she thought
she was alone and no one would see her?

This isn't the Internet.  If you expect Usenet and newsgroups to change
anytime soon you're in for a very long wait.

However, Dave should preface his statements with a

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; comment like, &quot;One of our neighbors who had dropped by, told me such
&gt; and such about my neice, but I don't really remember who that neighbor
&gt; was, because I was drinking too.&quot;

Where did he ever say a neighbor told him anything about his niece?  He's
been writing about her poor dinner party ettiquette in the first person for
years now.  I also don't recall him saying he was drunk.  Everyone here is
so quick to jump on the &quot;you must have been drunk&quot; bandwagon they don't read
for comprehension.  Yes, there was liquor served.  So?  She was there with
her husband.  With her mother.  He didn't mention they were shitfaced drunk,
just the niece.
Afterall, it appears third party

&gt; libel is protected on the internet, and if you claim to be too drunk

WHAT neighbor?!  You don't know WTF you're talking about.

&gt; Alas, the internet - it will be awhile, before it is tamed and

Again, if you're waiting for *Usenet* newsgroups to calm down you'll be
waiting for another 40 years (at least)

She doesn't sound all that self conscious about her weight and eating in
front of others if she typically stuffs her face right there at the buffet
table for all to see. I mean, *two dozen* deviled eggs??

What do you say to her when you catch her helping herself to the food in
