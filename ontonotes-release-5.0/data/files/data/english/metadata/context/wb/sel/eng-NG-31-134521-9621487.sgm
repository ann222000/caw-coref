Looking the file in question I notice that it is merely an annotated copy of the normal ANTLR format file. A quick google search didn't show up any link describing the VS 2005 format, so I can't fix it. :(

Hi,

Antlr.Tool.exe is [currently] only provided as a [unsupported] convenience
to the ANTLR/C#-on-CLI community. It is derived from the 3.0 version and not
the later 3.0.1 version (or indeed the beta 3.1 build).

As for the issue you report, it seems that the ikvm-ed executable is not be
able to find the vs2005 resource (.NET resource names can't contain the dot
char - i.e. '.' - AFAIK). If you need the vs2005 format, please use the
original java version of the ANTLR tool.

Micheal

.NET resource names definitely can include a dot character.  (In
fact almost all of the WinForms resources have dots in them;
frequently several dots.)  It just depends on how they're linked
in.

I stand corrected. The naming restrictions are indeed closely-related to
exactly how the resources are linked in....

&gt; Hi

&gt; I putted down this simple grammar:
...

&gt; This grammar could(?) generate 4 kind of differen expressions
&gt; Aritmethic expressions(expA)
&gt; Boolean expressions(expB)
&gt; String expressions(expS)
&gt; and an expression consisting of a simple field (FIELD)

&gt; whithout any option the compiler says that when i find a '(' it can't
&gt; decide if the expression is a expA or a expB or a expS.

&gt; if i use the option backtrack=true and memoize=true the interpreter don't
&gt; accept any kind of string.

&gt; where is the problem?
">

I suppose backtracking creates predicates in the code, which the interpreter doesn't understand. Use the debug option instead. BTW, don't use the global backtrack option. Instead use left-factoring or syntactic predicates. Makes the grammar faster.

First of all, how do you know, Micheal, that the thread starter used IKVM? I can't seen any hint for that. Another weirdness is that the mention vs2005.stg starts with &quot;group antlr;&quot;. Could that be the source of the error instead?

My comment was about the executable (we contributed that).

No. The template loading logic supports that.
