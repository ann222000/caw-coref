Nightmare On Main Street
More On Bush's Anti-Dissent Order
By Chris Floyd
Empire Burlesque
8-5-7

I think we are in rats' alley
Where the dead men lost their bones
-Eliot

We wrote recently here of Bush's new executive order granting himself and
his minions the arbitrary power to seize the entire assets of any American
citizen ­ without warning, without any criminal charges whatsoever ­ solely
by declaring that their victim somehow poses an unspecified threat to &quot;the
peace or stability of Iraq&quot; or else is &quot;undermining efforts to promote
economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq.&quot; In other words, Bush
now claims the power to strip you of your assets if you oppose American
policy in Iraq.

This latest tyrannical outburst from the Outrager-in-Chief has passed
largely without notice. Even some of the Administration's fiercest critics
have downplayed its significance. The always-admirable Dave Neiwert at
Orcinus has been among the skeptics, on the reasonable grounds that
right-wing militia groups were forever reading vast conspiracies into
ordinary government decrees in the 1990s, and that one should wait for more
informed legal analyses before leaping to scarifying conclusions. Fair
enough ­ although Dave himself has done as much as anyone out there in
detailing the extremism of the Bush Regime and its supporters. To his
credit, Dave has kept an open mind on the question, and co-blogger at
Orcinus, Sara Robinson, has taken a far darker view of the executive order.

Now Dave has featured a long ­ and highly disturbing ­ piece of informed
legal analysis of the order from one of his regular commenters, attorney Den
Valdron. who draws out the very dangerous implications of the order's
wording in convincing detail. Perhaps most disturbing is Valdron's insight
that the executive order doesn't even have to be formally invoked in order
to have a chilling effect on political dissent. Just its mere existence ­
and the ever-present threat of social and legal obliteration that it
represents ­ will be enough to quell all but the hardiest opponents of the
Leader's criminal rampage in Iraq.

You should scoot on ever to Orcinus and read
http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2007/07/that-executive-order.html
&quot;That Executive Order&quot; in full, but below is an excerpt about the &quot;chill
factor&quot; that Valdron identifies:

Essentially, in this Executive Order the President is assuming unbelievably
vast powers to simply sidestep normal criminal or civil procedure, and to
operate quite explicitly on the basis of guilt by anticipation, guilt by
pre-emption, guilt by association and guilt for any reason in the mind of
the decider. There is literally no limitation on authority, except that the
person's actual physical being is unaffected.

However, a person so designated by this Order could be rendered into a
non-person literally instantaneously. They could be stripped of every asset,
have every financial or commercial opportunity denied to them. Worse, this
literally creates a power to shun. Anyone who employs this person, who hires
them, who pays them for work, lends them money to tide them over, who rents
them an apartment, or allows them to sleep on the couch, who drops them a
few coins as they panhandle would be liable to becoming subject to this
order. The only protection would be to fire this person, to not hire them,
to not pay them, to not lend them money, evict them from your apartment,
kick them off the couch, and look away if you see them begging on the
street.

If the potential implications of this make you think of Jews in Nazi
Germany, think again. The Jews pre-war had it good compared to the potential
of this.

The most disturbing thing is that this Executive Order need not be actually
used. Consider it as a weapon of intimidation. Most Americans are not rich.
Most people live in apartments, they may have a house that the bank owns,
they may have a car they're making payments on, they struggle with credit
card debt, live paycheque to paycheque. We all live in these little islands
of stability that can be so easy to disrupt.

So imagine that you are a dedicated, committed, politically active person.
You're donating to the Green Party, perhaps active in local politics, going
to demonstrations...Then one day, a person from the treasury department
comes to visit. He shows you this executive order, and he tells you that you
have been identified by your actions and associations as being a
'significant risk to commit acts of violence.' He says that by their lights,
you may already be deemed to have committed acts of violence. He tells you
that it has been concluded that these acts of violence undermine the Iraqi
government and the reconstruction campaign...

You protest of course. He says it doesn't matter, these are the findings of
the Secretary of the Treasury under the executive order. You challenge him
to prove what act of violence they think you are about to commit. He replies
that there's no particular act, only that you're a 'significant risk.'

Then he tells you, in very clear terms, what they can do. That they can and
will take your house. That they can and will take your car and your bank
account. That you will be fired from your job. That you will find it
impossible to get another job, or find another place to live. That anyone
who helps you will be similarly punished, so no one will help you. He tells
you that if this isn't enough, they are prepared to take the same tactic
against your parents, your children, your girlfriend, your friends, based on
their association with you making them a 'significant risk of committing
violence' or of 'providing support to you.'

He asks you if you are prepared to see your life erased? Are you really that
brave? Do you really want to lose your job, your home, your nest, your
savings, your income, your retirement...And if you are that brave, are you
really prepared to see this done to your girlfriend, your parents, whoever
is close to you...

You could take it to court and fight it, of course. All you need is a lawyer
that will work for free, because you won't be able to pay him. And he'll
have to be a lawyer willing to risk winding up in the same situation you'll
be inFighting it will take two or three years. That's a long time to spend
eating out of dumpsters and sleeping on heating grates. It's possible of
course, that you'll win and be vindicated. Or you could lose.

Are you feeling lucky?

So most people in that situation, what would they do? They'll just shut
their mouths, stop making waves, they'll do their jobs, collect their
paycheques and mind their own business. They'll stay out of trouble.

But sometimes, when they see the Sheriff driving down the street to evict
someone, when there's a hiccup in their credit card, when they get a call
from the bank, or a call into their boss's office... well, they'll get a
cold sweat running down their backs, and their stomach will flutter, and
they'll search their memories for anything that they might have done wrong,
maybe said the wrong thing to the wrong person, had the wrong friend, went
to the wrong place... And of course, most times, it'll turn out to be
nothing. They'll recover from the scare, their life will go on. But the fear
will remain somewhere, and the cold sweat, and the only choice they have
will be to be good little citizens.

This is the dystopian thug-state that the Bush Administration is building
before our eyes ­ often in broad daylight, with little or no pretense of
masking their lust, their obsession, with authoritarian power. Yet every
institution in American civic life that might act as a bulwark against these
tyrannical encroachments seems completely paralyzed ­ or else thoroughly
complicit in this monstrous mutation. Bush and his cronies are effecting a
wholesale revolution in the American state, despite being one of the most
discredited and widely despised administrations in the country's history.
It's like a long and vivid nightmare, where you watch some hideous,
filth-encrusted beast gnawing your child to pieces, in agonizing slow
motion, while you stand mysteriously frozen on the spot, unable to move or
scream.

This order is exactly what Zionist Israel has been doing to the Palestinians
for about 60 years now. The Palestinians have been stripped of all human
rights, including their right to their own property. What Israel wants,
Israel takes. The experiments in human rights violations that are conducted
first by Zionists against the Palestinians, can be expected to happen next
in Zionist America.

&quot;Internationalization today means only Judaisation. We in Germany have
come to this: that a sixty million people sees its destiny at the will
of a few dozen Jewish bankers.&quot;

Adolf Hitler, 28th July 1922

&quot;I realized that the fight was not against enemy nations, but against
international capital.&quot;

&quot;The fight against international finance and loan capital became the
most important point
in the program of the German nation's struggle for its economic
independence and freedom.&quot;

Adolf Hitler

Here is a quote from a very pro-Jewish book that was first
published in 1925. The book is &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; by Lewis
Browne.

&quot;The Jews had become the money lenders of Europe for quite
evident reasons. The Church sternly forbade all Christians to engage
in the pursuit...
&quot;So the Jews became the money lenders of Europe. They developed
a great shrewdness and cunning in the one and only field of
opportunity left open to them. And with their shrewdness and cunning
they developed a certain cruelty and greed. That was natural. The
world was cruel to them, so when the chance was theirs, they were
cruel in return...&quot;

The money system we have today is called the debt-money
system. It is evil and needs to be replaced. The only way money comes
into existence today is when it is borrowed. There is no freely
existing money supply, but only borrowed money that needs to be paid
back to bankers with interest. If all the money that was owed to
bankers was ever paid back there would be no money left in circulation
and this would be a great depression. What makes matters even worse is
that when money is created only the principle of the loan is created.
The money needed to pay the interest is never created. For this reason
it is impossible to pay back the principle plus the interest on all of
the loans that make up our money supply. The extra amount of money
needed to pay the interest was never created and does not exist.

The United States government borrows money from the Federal
Reserve Bank. This bank is not federal but owned by private
stockholders. It is in the business section of the phone book, not the
government section. Other banks also create the money in our money
supply. They are allowed to loan out much more money then they
actually have. Thus they create new money. No one else is allowed to
create money, only bankers have this privilege. All of our money is
debt-money and it is all owed back to bankers, plus the interest.

In the U.S.A. money is created by the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing which is a unit of the treasury, but the orders to print come
from the Federal Reserve Banks. The money is created for and owned by
the banks. And the Federal Reserve Banks are not Federal, in spite of
the name. Privately owned commercial banks own the stock of the
Federal Reserve Banks. The Federal Reserve Banks give the newly
created money to the government in exchange for government bonds. To
simplify: The United States does not make its own money. Bankers
create the money and loan it to the United States with an interest
charge.

The book War Cycles Peace Cycles puts it  this way:

&quot;If there is only $10 in existence, and you lend it to someone
under the condition that he repay $11, and if he agrees to this, he
has agreed to the impossible.&quot;

The book  The Struggle for World Power put it this way:

&quot;The Bank of England... was the first payment institution which
was legally empowered to issue state-authorized paper currency and ,
therefore, the Government itself became its debtor. Thus the State not
only renounced its monopoly on monetary emission, but also agreed to
borrow the privately-created money from the bankers...Not only the
thing being done, but even the very name was a deliberate fraud and
deception to conceal the essence of the deed. To create money out of
nothing is to make valid and effective claim on all goods and services
for no return, which is fraud and theft, made worse by the
circumstances that the money is lent out at interest...it follows that
those who have the power to 'create' out of nothing all the money in
each country and the whole world and lend it as stated, have total
power over all states, parties, firms, radio, press, individuals and
so on. Therefore the power of Parliament in general, and especially
with regard to money, is non-existent, and all the true sovereignty is
in the hands of those private individuals who issue all money&quot;
