Dear Friend,
Five minutes and five dollars can change your life!!!THIS IS
THE FAIREST, MOST HONEST WAY I KNOW TO SHARE THE WEALTH! Would you
like to make thousands of dollars, quickly, legally, with NOCATCH?
Then keep reading..... please take five minutes to read thisarticle;
it will change your life, just like it did mine. It's true! You can
make up to, or over, $50,000.00 in 4 - 6 weeks; maybe sooner! I SWEAR
I'M NOT LYING TO YOU, AND THIS IS NOT A SCAM! If you're interested,
keep reading; if you're not, I apologize forwasting your time.

Here we go. A little while back, I was browsing through these
newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar
to this that said you could make thousands of dollars in weeks, with
only an initial investment of $5.00!! So, I thought, "Yeah, right,
must be a scam", but, I was curious, like most of us are, and kept
reading. Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of the five names
and addresses stated in the article. You then place your own name and
address in the article at the bottom of the list at #5, and post the
article in at least 200 newsgroups, (there are thousands). No catch,
that was it! So after thinking it over, talking to a few people first,
I tried it.I figured what have I got to lose except for 5 stamps, and
$5.00, right? Well, guess what....within 7 days, I started getting
money in the mail! I was shocked! I still figured it would end soon,
and didn't give it another thought. But then money kept coming in ,
tripling in size and multipying by 10 - 20 times the amount that I got
the first week! In my first week I made about 20 - 30 dollars. But,
by the end of the second week, I had made a total of over $1000.00!!!!
In the third week, I had over $10,000.00, and its still growing.
This is my fourth week, and I've made about $42,000.00 TOTAL, and the
money is still coming in........Let me tell you how this works, and
most importantly, WHY it works, also, make sure you print a copy of
the article NOW, so you get the information off of it, and begin
making money.The process is very simple, and it consists of 3 EASY
steps:

STEP 1: Get 5 separate pieces of paper and write the following on
each sheet of paper...."PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST", and then
write your NAME AND ADDRESS. Get five $1.00 bills and place ONE
inside each piece of paper that you just wrote on. Fold each paper so
the bill will not be seen in the envelope, (otherwise, nosey people
who like to steal envelopes with money in it won't get yours). Put
one paper inside each envelope, and seal it. Do the same for all
five. You should now have 5 envelopes, sealed, EACH with a piece of
paper AND a $1.00 bill, stuffed inside of the paper. Make sure those
words that were stated above, are written on each paper. What you are
doing is creating a service; this is PERFECTLY LEGAL. Now then, mail
the 5 envelopes, with the paper and $1.00 bill in each, to the
following 5 addresses:

1. Â J. Krakowiak , 1112 W. Broadway #1, Anaheim, Ca 928053.

2. J. Sides, Lamar Box 1, South Plains College, 1401 S. College
Ave.,Levelland, TX 79336

3. Areg Mkrian, 15 Alma Ave. Belmont, MA 02178-4404

4. A Karns, 4000 NW 53rd, Oklahoma City, OK, 73112

5. B. Ousley, 408 N Imperial Ave., Ontario Ca. 91764

STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move
the other 4 names up, (5 becoming 4, 4 becoming 3, etc.), and put
YOURNAME as number 5 on the list. You can slightly alter this article
ifyou need to; editing what you need to edit.

STEP 3: Post your amended article, (with your name at #5), to at
least 200 newsgroups, (There are close to 19,000 of them). HOW TO DO
THIS:If you are using Netscape 3.0, do EXACTLY the following:
1) Click on any newsgroup, like normal, THEN click on 'TO NEWS',which
as on the far left when you're in the newsgroup page. This will bring
up a box to type a message in.
2) Leave the newsgroup box like it is. CHANGE the subject box to
something flashy, like, "NEED CASH $$$ READ HERE $$$" or "FAST CASH"!!
3) Tab once, and you should be ready to type. Now, re-type,
(onlyonce), this WHOLE ARTICLE WORD FOR WORD, except to insert your
name at#5, and to remove #1 off the list; plus any other small changes
youthink you need to make. Keep most of it the same!!
4) When you're done typing the WHOLE article, click on FILE in
THISBOX, right above send, not where it says Netscape News On The
FirstBox. Click on SAVE AS when you're under FILE. Save your article
as a text file to your C: or A: drive. DO NOT SEND OR POST YOUR
ARTICLE UNTIL YOU DO THIS. Once saved, move on to number 5 below.
5) If you still have all of your text, send, or post, to this news
group, now, by just clicking send; which is located below FILE, and
right above Cc:.
6) Here's where you're going to post all 200. OK, click on any
newsgroup, then click on 'TO NEWS', again, in the top left corner.
Leave theNEWSGROUPS BOX alone. Again, put a flashy subject title in
the SUBJECT BOX. Hit TAB once you're in the body of the message, and
then click on ATTACHMENTS, which is below the SUBJECT BOX. You will
get another box to come up. Click on ATTACH FILE, then find YOUR file
that you saved; click once on the file, and then click 'OPEN'. Now
click on OK. If you did this right, you should be able to see your
file name in the attachments box, and it will be shaded green.If you
use IE EXPLORER, it's just as easy......HOLDING DOWN THE LEFT BUTTON,
HIGHLIGHT THIS ARTICLE. THEN PRINT THIS ARTICLE FOR YOURRECORDS TO
HAVE THE NAMES OF THOSE YOU WILL BE SENDING $1.00 TO. NEXT, GO TO THE
NEWSGROUPS AND PRESS "POST AN ARTICLE". A WINDOWWILL OPEN. TYPE
YOUR HEADLINE IN THE SUBJECT AREA AND THEN CLICK INTHE LARGE WINDOW
BELOW. PRESS "CRTL" AND THEN "V", AND THE ARTICLE WILLBE PLACED IN THE
WINDOW. IF YOU WANT TO EDIT THE ARTICLE, DO SO, AND THEN HIGHLIGHT AND
COPY IT AGAIN. NOW EVERY TIME YOU POST THE ARTICLE IN A NEWNEWSGROUP,
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS REPEAT "CRTL" AND "V" AND PRESS POST.
7) That's it. Each time you do this, all you have to do is type in a
different newsgroup, so that way, it posts to 200 different
newsgroups. You see? Now you just have 199 to go!!! (Don't worry,
eac hone takesabout 30 seconds; once you get used to it). REMEMBER
..200 IS THE MINIMUM. The more you post, the more money you'll
make.AND THAT'S IT!!!! THOSE ARE THE ONLY 3 STEPS THERE ARE!!! You
are now in the mail order business, and will start receiving $1.00
envelopes from various people, all over the world, within days.(HINT:
THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST TO, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILLMAKE!). You
may want to rent a PO Box, eventually, because of all the mail. If
you wish to stay anonymous, you can come up with a name, suchas
"manager" or"investor". Just make sure all the addresses are CORRECT,
please! LET ME TELL YOU WHY THIS SYSTEMS WORKS!! Out of every 200
postings, let's say I ONLY receive 5 replies, (this is actually VERY
LOW). So, I made $5.00 with my name at #5. Now then,each person who
just sent me $1.00 makes, say, only 200 postings, now with your name
at number 4, WHICH IS A TOTAL OF 1000 POSTINGS, not including yours
too. 50 people send you $1.00 now; that's $50.00 you just made! Now
then, your new 50 agents post 200 each with YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 3,
or10,000 postings, (50 X 200). Average return is 500 at $1.00 each,
which is $500.00! They make 200 postings, which is 5000 returns at
$1.00 each,which is $5000.00!! And finally, 5000 people make 200
postings each,with YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 1. YOU NOW GET A RETURN OF
$50,000.00 BEFOREYOUR NAME DROPS OFF THE LIST!! AND THAT'S IF
EVERYONE MAKES ONLY 200 POSTINGS, AND IF ONLY A SMALL % PEOPLE
RESPOND!!!When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the
latest posting that is appearing in the newsgroups, and SEND OUT
ANOTHER $5.00 to THE NAMES ON THE LIST, PUTTING YOUR NAME AT #5 AGAIN,
AND START POSTING AGAIN!! The thing to remember is, do you realize
that THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE JOINING THE INTERNET
AND ARE READING THESE ARTICLES EVERY DAY!! JUST LIKE YOU ARE RIGHT
NOW!!! So, can you afford $5.00 and see if it really works? I think
so.......People have said, "What if the plan is played out and no one
sends you the money?" So what! What are the chances of that
happening when there are TONS OF NEW, HONEST USERS AND NEW, HONEST
PEOPLE joining theInternet and Newsgroups everyday? and, are willing
to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, each
and every day!! Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this WILL
WORK, I PROMISE YOU!! You just have to behonest. Make sure you print
this article out, RIGHT NOW, also, try to keep a list of everyone that
sends you money, and always keep an eye on the newsgroups to make sure
everyone is playing fairly. REMEMBER: HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY!!
YOU DON'T NEED TO CHEAT THE BASIC IDEA TO MAKE MONEY! GOOD LUCK TO
ALL, AND PLEASE, PLAY FAIRLY; YOU WILL REAP THE HUGE REWARDS FROM
THIS.....WHICH IS TONS OF CASH!!! ****By the way, if you try to
deceive people by posting the messages with your name on the list, and
by not sending the money to the people already on the list, you will
not get much. Someone I talked to knew someone who did that, and he
only made $150.00; and that was after seven or eight weeks!! Then, he
sent the 5 $1.00 bills; people addedhim to their lists, and in 4 - 5
weeks, he had over $10,000.00. THIS IS THE FAIREST, AND MOST HONEST,
WAY I HAVE EVER SEEN TO SHARE THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD WITHOUT COSTING
ANYTHING BUT OUR TIME! GOOD LUCK, AND HAVE FUN!!!!
