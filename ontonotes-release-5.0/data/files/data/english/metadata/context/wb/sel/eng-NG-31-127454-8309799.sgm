Who started the fire in the Room of Requirement?
No one actually saw Crabbe start it.
Perhaps Snape?  Quietly helping?

No (IMO) Crabbe did, it is directly implied in the text.

&quot;Like it hot, scum?&quot; roared Crabbe as he ran.
But he seemed to have no control over what he had done.
Flames of abnormal size....
[DH Chapter 31]

While Crabbe is not shown actually starting the fire, this text indicates he
did it then lost control of the fire.

BTW it could not be Snape anyways, he had already fled from Hogwarts.

No, see, Snape is a *competent* wizard.  If he'd've done it, he'd've

The spell he used created 'fiendfire'... which Hermione knew would
