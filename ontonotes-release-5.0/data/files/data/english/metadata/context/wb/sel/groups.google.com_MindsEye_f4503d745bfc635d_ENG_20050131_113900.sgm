I thought of this topic while reading some of Charle's posts. Although
I know that I have the potential for opening some major cans of major
worms....I think that it's worth trying to have a rational conversation
about this topic. I think that it may be surprising to hear what we can
learn from each other.

I think that many people already have an idea of what I think of this
subject, so I'll try to add it in later.....but lets get the talk
started first. Let the fight begin!! (just kidding....;-)

I'm all for evolution. People who claim creationism must be true,
because it says it in the bible, bother me to an extent, but not nearly
as much as &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; proponents. I just recently wrote a
research paper on Intelligent Design for school, so I figure I'll just
post it hear so I don't have to type out all the arguments again (it's
long).

The Pseudoscience of Intelligent Design

The Dover, Pennsylvania school board recently adopted a policy
requiring that high school science teachers teaching evolution tell
their students that evolutionary theory, a theory that has been shown
to explain the origins of life time and time again, is flawed, and that
intelligent design is a valid alternative. The ACLU (American Civil
Liberties Union), along with the AUSCS (Americans United for the
Separation of Church and State), and 11 parents, are suing the school
board, accusing the board of violating the separation of church and
state (Banerjee A16). They are quite right. The sole purpose of
&quot;Intelligent Design&quot; is to make creationism look like a
scientifically credible theory, so that it can be perpetuated in public
schools, among other places. Intelligent Design, however, is not
supported by scientific evidence, and is invalid as a scientific
theory.

To understand the problems with Intelligent Design, first it is
important to understand the theory it is attempting to oppose,
evolution by natural selection. The theory is this: If organisms
reproduce, offspring inherit traits from their progenitor(s), a
variability of traits exists, and the environment cannot sustain all
the members of an increasingly large population, then those members of
the population that have poorly-adapted traits (to their environment)
will die out, and those with well-adapted traits (to their environment)
will prosper (Darwin 459). Over a long period of time, this process
leads to extreme complexity, and adaptedness.

The premise of Intelligent Design is that the universe is so
unimaginably complex and perfect that it must have been created by an
intelligent designer. The classic analogy used in this argument is
that of the watch and the watchmaker. William Paley wrote in his book,
Natural Theology:

&quot;In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and
were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer,
that, for any thing I knew to the contrary, it had lain there for ever:
nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer.
But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be
inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly
think of the answer which I had before given, that, for any thing I
knew, the watch might have always been there. Yet why should not this
answer serve for the watch as well as for the stone? Why is it not as
admissible in the second case, as in the first (1)?&quot;

The watchmaker analogy attempts to show that just as a watch could not
come into existence by random events, neither could a human being. All
arguments for design are essentially derivatives of this argument, and
none of them succeed in lending any credibility to Intelligent Design.

Michael Behe, in his book, Darwin's Black box, puts forward an
argument for Intelligent Design which he calls &quot;Irreducible
Complexity.&quot; In the book, Behe argues that there are certain complex
systems which cannot be explained by evolution. He compares these
systems to a mousetrap:

&quot;The first step in determining irreducible complexity is to specify
both the function of the system and all system components. An
irreducibly complex object will be composed of several parts, all of
which contribute to the function ...

&quot;The function of a mousetrap is to immobilize a mouse so that it
can't perform such unfriendly acts as chewing through sacks of flour
or electrical cords, or leaving little reminders of its presence in
unswept corners. The mousetraps that my family uses consist of a number
of parts (Figure 2-2): (1) a flat wooden platform to act as a base [for
the attachment of the other parts]; (2) a metal hammer, which does the
actual job of crushing the little mouse; (3) a spring with extended
ends to press against the platform and the hammer when the trap is
charged; (4) a sensitive catch that releases when slight pressure is
applied, and (5) a metal holding bar that connects to the catch and
holds the hammer back when the trap is charged. (There are also
assorted staples to hold the system together).

&quot;The second step in determining if a system is irreducibly complex is
to ask if all the components are required for function. In this
example, the answer is clearly yes ... If the wooden base were gone,
there would be no platform for attaching the other components. If the
hammer were gone, the mouse could dance all night on the platform
without becoming pinned to the wooden base. If there were no spring,
the hammer and platform would jangle loosely, and again the rodent
would be unimpeded. If there were no catch or metal holding bar, then
the spring would snap the hammer shut as soon as you let go of it; in
order to use a trap like that you would have to chase the mouse around
while holding the trap open (42).&quot;

Behe believes that the vertebrate eye, along with several other
biological functions, is irreducibly complex. He tries to show that
this is a fatal flaw in evolution because there would be no selection
pressure for the intermediate steps in the construction of an
irreducibly complex function. While this may seem reasonable, there is
a clear way around this problem. Behe completely neglects the
possibility that the eye, and other irreducibly complex systems evolved
in steps in which the function of the system changed. In fact, Darwin
anticipated this challenge in Origin of Species and gave a reasonable
explanation of how this very thing could have happened with the eye
(217).

Experiments with simulated evolution on computers have shown that
Darwin's explanation is extremely probable. In an article published
in the journal Nature, computer science researchers used a program
called Avida, to simulate the evolution of &quot;digital organisms.&quot;
Digital organisms are pieces of computer code that replicate (Lenski et
al. 139). They have a &quot;genome&quot; of computer instructions, which can
combine to perform functions. They use &quot;energy&quot; to replicate, and
can gain energy by performing any of nine logic functions. The more
complicated a logic function was, the more energy an organism would
gain by performing it (Lenski et al. 140).

The population in the experiment started as 36,000 identical digital
organisms, which could not perform logic functions but could replicate.
Even the most simple logic function would take multiple mutations to
evolve (Lenski et al. 140). The most complicated function, EQU,
appeared in the population after 111 mutations. At mutation 110 the
organism actually lost one of its most basic functions, NAND. The
researchers found that if NAND had not been removed, EQU would not have
appeared. The researchers repeated the experiment 50 times and found
that the number of mutations needed to evolve EQU ranged from 51 to 721
(Lenski et al. 141). Five of the 23 populations which developed EQU
included a deleterious mutation in the step prior to its evolution
(Lenski et al. 142). This demonstrates that parts of an organism can
trade off functions, even losing them for a time, while evolving more
complex and useful ones.

The EQU function depended on 35 of 60 instructions in the organism's
genome. Deleting any one of them would prevent EQU from being
performed. The researchers performed the experiment 50 more times, and
found that the number of instructions required for EQU ranged from 17
to 43 with a median of 28. The function is clearly extremely complex
and fragile.

The researchers came to several conclusions as a result of their
experiments. They found that EQU was only evolved when an organism
could successfully use simpler functions. There was great overlap in
the genetic instructions used in many different functions. Loss of
simple functions was often a side effect of gaining complex ones. In
agreement with Charles Darwin, they found that complex features evolve
through the modification of existing simpler structures. Behe's
mousetrap must have had another function while it was in the process of
creating its mouse trapping function. This seems absurd as applied to
a mousetrap, but this has more to do with the simplicity of the mouse
trap, in comparison to actual biological processes than the failure of
Darwinism.

Moreover, it has been shown how many of the processes that Behe
claimed were irreducibly complex, have actually evolved. He claimed
that both bacterial flagellum and the immune system were irreducibly
complex, but it has been shown that this is not the case (Matzke;
Inlay). Clearly, irreducible complexity does not defeat Darwinism.

Another argument for intelligent design, put forward primarily by the
mathematician and philosopher William Dembsky, is the argument of
&quot;Specified Complexity.&quot; The term Specified Complexity was used
originally by Leslie Orgel. Her definition is:

&quot;In brief, living organisms are distinguished by their &quot;specified&quot;
complexity. Crystals are usually taken as the prototypes of simple
well-specified structures, because they consist of a very large number
of identical molecules packed together in a uniform way. Lumps of
granite or random mixtures of polymers are examples of structures which
are complex but not specified. The crystals fail to qualify as living
because they lack complexity; the mixtures of polymers fail to qualify
because they lack specificity (189).&quot;

Dembsky's Specified Complexity can be explained as follows. A
series of random characters such as &quot;icmalswejd&quot; has high
complexity but low specificity. The character string &quot;aaaaaaaaaa,&quot;
on the other hand, has high specificity, since it has a distinct ...

Umm good, interesting, lots of things to thing about.

I guess I would have to side with Island here, although Benna, I have
to say what you say about 'Intelegent Design' and fundamental
Christiainty is spot on :)

Speaking personaly, if you have any sort of common sense, and a belief
in God, the the idea of Intelegent Design, has to be one on which to
build your thought processes.

Of course Evolution is the way it happend, it's just that God planned
it that way :)

You talk about seperation of Church and state, okay now lets look at
what is considered a church, we have christians, muslims, wiccans,
scientolgists the list goes on, what do these have in common, they
believe in a certain set of precepts, that may not be explicitly
proven. Ooops I left some importantant ones out, atheists, agnostics
and evolutionists, they also fits the definitions. What is the
difference, until you can actually document a current upward evolution
of a species, then it is not scientific; all that is happening right
now is extrapolation beyond the known. The greeks did it, they saw an
ancient elephant skull and thought it was that of a human; they were
confused by the layout and came about with the cyclops. Is evolutions
merely a cyclops dream that will later be disproved.

Island:
They may not be mutually exclusive, but many people who speak of
creation are refering to the creation of the bible, which conflicts
with modern science. Its even legitamate to say that evolution is how
it happened, but based on other reasons, not related to the truth of
the theory of evolution by natural selection, god started it all.
What I have a problem with is attempts at a posteriori arguments for
god that make the false claim that natural selection is not workable.
People promoting this view make the mistake of challenging a the facts
on a spacific scientific theory. They have no better chance of
winning that argument than they do disputing whether gravity causes
things to fall to the ground. Sure, angels could have done it, but we
have no reason to believe it is necessary to bring angels into it.

Lee:
If you take that to be the case based on your faith in god, I don't
really have a problem with that. I do think it is at least possible
that evolution could occur without an intelligent designer. What
bothers me is people who make the counter claim to this one.

Mike:
Science is different from religion. Science is based on observations.
Religion tends to be based on claims that have little if an empirical
evidence. Religions are usually (though not always) based on a set of
doctrines which are true because they are true. It is taken on faith.
This has been a pretty well accepted distintion since the scientific
revolution hundreds of years ago. If you want to tell me that we
can't trust empirical observation, then I guess thats your right, but
the human race has essentially come to an agreement that what we
observe is, in most cases, what exists. While evolution is a theory
which is in fact falsifiable (something intelligent design is not),
this is what makes it a scientific theory. The theory of gravity
could, in theory, be proven wrong. Would you like to challenge that
theory to, simply because it &quot;could&quot; be proven wrong like the cyclops?
Atheism really isn't a religion, but simply a lack of a perticlur
belief. However, I would be against the explicit teaching of atheism
in schools as well. Schools can teach facts, and students can take
those facts and make their own judgements about religios concepts such
as god. Simply neglecting to teach about god is not the same thing as
teaching the non-existence of god. Now, from an empirical point of
view, evolution by natural selection is well supported. We will
probobly never find the fossiles to prove the entire evolutionary path
of a current species, but this is really too much to ask. Fossiles
just are not that easy to find. What we do know is that evolution by
natural selection clearly happens on a smaller scale, and it can be
extrapolated that it is how species are created. See Darwin's finchs
for an example.

P.S. Agnosticism isn't a religion at all, as it makes no claims either way.

Benna,
extrapolation beyond a known, is and has never been an acceptable
process in any respectable scientific community. We do not know and
frankly will not know all the factors that brought forth our lives the
way they exist today nor should anyone really hope to. There are too
many variables. And to say that an atheist has no beliefs is rather
ignorant of what a belief is. They believe that the there is no god or
are no gods past or present. Every body has a belief system of some
sort it may not be the teaching of Zoraster, Buddha, Jesus etc. but
they have a belief system. It could be Darwin and the Origin of the
Species is thier bible. If you want to chart a series of data, you start
with point A then B, C, D, etc. you do not start with Z. You have to
have two reliable points of data to graph a line. But with only two
points you can not determine that you date is linear. When you get the
third point it could show the data to be non linear, thus opening it to
being exponential, or hyperbolic etc. I think you get my point.
note ----
I am not trying to disprove anything that is scientific verifying such
as gravity, we know it exists, we even have a formula for calculating
it. But it has been tested many times over. Any proposed scientific
theory must be tested and verified thousands times over in different
variations to be proven. Ford motor company before a newly engineered
piece is put into productions for use they test it thousands upon
thousands of times for verifications that it is scientifically correct.

For one thing, deductive reasoning (which is what extrapolation is) is
certainly respected in the scientific community. Experiments are done
when possible. From those experimental results conclusions are made
based on logic. I may have been loose on my use of the word belief.
Maybe I should rephrase it. Atheism is not a positive belief, and it
is certainly not a belief system, so it isn't in and of itself a
religion. One could be an atheist and a buddhist. I do not dispute
that at any point, if the right evidence was put forward, evolution by
natural selection could be disproven. This is called falsifiablity,
and is one of the main criteria for something to be scientific.
Gravity is a falsifiable theory as well. Intelligent Design, however,
is not. You say that the theory of gravity has been adaquetly tested,
but that natural selection has not. This is really somewhat absurd.
No experiment has ever shown natural selection to be false, and a huge
number of experiments have been done, and are being done, on the
subject. Unless you have some spacific claim as to why we should not
look at the theory of evolution like we do the theory of gravity, this
is simply not a valid point. Also, the formula for gravity is not
technically the theory of gravity, but the law of gravity. It exists
outside of its application to the real world. The theory of gravity
is that that law applies to the universe. This is the theory that
could, in theory, be disproven. Theories are never proven, only
proven wrong. It is just that when theories are tested time and time
against and found not to be contradicted, they become widely accepted.
If you are willing to say that we know gravity exists, why don't we
know evolution does?

If evolution, or alien landings(Zechariah Sitchen's belief) or whatever
proves that we were not created by as you call it intelligent design,
would that not disprove it? There is your abilitiy to prove it false.
Anything can be proven false, it is just a matter of the person
believing it. If I tell somebody that Elvis Presley is dead, some would
say he is not despite the medical reports. I am simply stating that it
rather beyond our scope to know if our world and our end of the universe
is following the same &quot;laws&quot; it has always followed. That is one area
alot of so called scientist refuse to consider.

No, not at all. Not the &quot;strictly speaking.&quot; To be proven one must
show that something will always be true, regardless of future
experiments. The only time this can really happen is in closed
systems of logic or math. In the real world, things are shown in many
different situations to be true, and then they become widely accepted.
However, there is little faith involved after a sufficient number of
experiments have been conducted. The only reason I point out that it
can not truely be proven, is to show that it can not with 100%
certainty disprove Intelligent Design, thus showing that Intelligent
Design is not a valid scientific theory. Even if we are 99.9999%
sure, this does not make Intelligent Design Falsifiable.

Any Theory which cannot be proven is taken on certian assumption agreed
upon. Any assumption is taken by faith or maybe a better term for you
trust. You trust that your assumptions are correct, as I trust that mine
are. Trust and faith are the same. If you have an acrobat who has
walked a tight rope carrying a person is a wheelbarrel several times,
you know he can do it, but if you are asked to be carried, do you trust
(or have faith in him) that he can safely carry you. You seem to not
understand your own thought processes, we all take things by faith all
the time maybe when we should not. How much of the News propaganda do
you actually believe. Faith is not a bad word but understand that it is

Nobody claims evolutionary process is random. The point is, that it
takes random mutations, and naturally &quot;selects&quot; those mutations that
are benificial to survival. If it wasn't for this second step,
nothing would ever evolve. I should disclose that I tend to be a
moral relativist. Moral reletivism gets a bad rap, but its not quite
what it seems to be on the surface. A true moral relativist would not
have a problem with people having their own absolutes that they base
their actions on. Any judgement against them would be an absolute in
itself. In fact, there are certain things I find to be immoral in my
opinion, but I admit that these things are not absolutes but the
product of my environment.

It is for this reason that I do not really have a problem with
creationists or even intelligent design proponents who make no claims
about their being scientists. However, most intelligent design
proponents do claim that they can scientifically show that there must
be a god. I do not see faith as a bad word. I just think when people

I must say that that is more accurate a statement than alot I have heard
about relativism. You do have some things you believe are always wrong.
If someone says that there is no right or is no wrong, try go shooting
them, they will suddenly change thier mind quick.

I think there are certain assumptions based on faith in the scientific
process, but these are things that we agree apon in order to be able
to talk about any of it. If someone doesn't want to agree to them
thats fine, but they cannot then join the scientific debate. From a
scientific perspective, evolution is probobly true. From a
&quot;the-bible-says-it-so-it-must-be-true&quot; perspective, god did it. There
are many different perspectives. I pick the scientific one for
matters such as this. If someone picks the latter and is honest about
it that is fine with me.

there are many division in the monotheistic religions
Judaism/Christianity/Islam are the major one with Orthodox Jews/Kaballah
etc. and w/Christians Catholic/protestants(with a bunch of divisions
there as well) and Islam Sunnis/Shiites the majors ones You have a slew
of Eastern religions as well, with vast differences. Yes
Judao-Christian-Islamic religions tend to use the same terms that does
not mean all of the divisions agree on the formationof the universe

but my major point is that neither an intelligent design theory
(whichever one) or which ever evolutionary theory you choose neither
should be apart of a true scientific debated. Neither are scientific.

are random. I mean, they may follow physical laws but they happen in

mutations help an organism to survive. Could you elaborate on this

Yes I most certainly can show you instances of it happening. Darwin's
finches are the clasic example. The finches on the galapagos islands
were all very similar except for their beaks. Finches on seperate
islands were different, even though the climate was the same. The
difference was that the birds beaks addapted so that they would best
be able to eat the available food. I'm really not explaining it as
well as I should, but try reading Origin of Species.

I use the phrase Intelligent Design to mean the Intelligent Design
Movement as referenced by this wikipedia article.

creationists do not make this claim. I am only speaking against the
Intelligent Design Movement.

But science is based on certain assumptions. If one does not wish to
make those assumptions that is fine, but they what they are practicing
is not science. Evolution is scientifically valid and intelligent
design is not. I come back to this again and again, but it is not so

Alot of things exist and we don't know why, we may never know why. Can
you prove that god exists or does not exist ? No
Can you prove that evolution did or did not happen ? not really it is
something that if it happens happens on a generation level. The idea is
that genetic traits change when they are passed on to the next
generation to adapt. Since this is the case it is just a guess.

It is not a guess that it happened. There is an extremly large body
of evidence that it happens. Take DNA for example. We can see that
the DNA is similar with the exception of certain mutations. The body
of evidence sugests that in all likelyhood, evolution is true. Now,
it is POSSIBLE that it is wrong. You can be the almost cartesian
level skeptic if you want to be, but within the framework of science,
evolution is well accepted for good reason.

2 then propose a ?
3 Hypothesis - the Why of it happening.
4 then a prediction.
If the prediction is wrong then you start over again.

But you can make predictions based on things you experience. And
evolution can even be duplicated in a micro level in the lab. What
about physics? There are many predictions made by physics (ie. black
holes) which can not be seen directly. What about planets orbitting
other stars. These are never directly seen. They are predicted based
on the effect their orbits have on the star. How are these
predictions and evolution different (other than evolution possibly
being more well tested).

Alot of what is said, by scientists or socalled scientist, are clouded
by a preconceived bias, they have by a certain world view
(philosophy/religion whatever) or profit. When a scientist can right a
hot new book on a new theory tell me he does not do it. Nobody wants to
disprove what they believe in dogmatically. You don't want to disprove
Evolution so you will not look at anything that could disprove it, you
only see the positive things that may support it.

"/> You're statement may be true, but it doesn't give fair recognition to
the high standard of requirements that exist for the preferred theory,

No theory represents a perfect reflection of nature, but its inferences
still represent the most accurate reflection that we have, in the least
possible number of steps. Tweaking and tuning are one thing, but there
is a huge difference in the amount of &quot;faith&quot; that's required to
believe the preferred theory.

Give credit where due, in other words... because the comprison that you

strong support for a theory makes it more absolute, than not.

I am not refering to planets in our own solar system that we can send
probes to. I am speaking of planets that orbit around far-away
starts. We cannot actually detect them directly, but only from their
orbits effect on said star. It is this, I believe, that you must
write off as unscientific to be consistant (unless I am missing
something). I think it is important to note that while it is true
that some people will do anything to protect their pet theory, one
cannot know if that is someone's motive simply because they argue
strongly for their theory. Isn't it possible they really believe it
to be true. Maybe it even is true. I could easily say the same thing
about you. You really seem to wan to prove that darwinism is
unscientific. But I don't make such a conclusion, because I believe
that you are expressing your true and honest opinion of what you
observe. Agruments of philosophy, I think, must take place between
equals, because otherwise the argument gets obscured by personal
attacks, emotion, and any number of other factors. We are both in
search of the truth I think.

Lee:
Well, randomness, as usually defined, probobly does not exist in
nature at all. Nothing can be truly random. Things must come from
somewhere. Its just that sometimes things are so hoplessly complex
and related to so many veriables, that we have no way of predicting
their behavior.

island:
The article says &quot;A new theory states that it is entropy which drives
evolution to higher levels of complexity -- for the sole purpose of
disseminating energy gradients.&quot; It seems to me, that this is a very
loose usage of the word &quot;purpose.&quot; This may be what happens, this may
be the law that causes it, but to call that a purpose is a stretch.
The universe doesn't care what happens to energy any more than a
computer cares about the meaning of what I am typing. Evolution
doesn't care about survival, it only tends to produce organisms that
can survive. Thermodynamics does not determine the universe with a
purpose in mind, it is simply a reflection of how the universe acts.
There is nothing outside of the universe which &quot;enforces&quot;
thermodynamics.

Steven Hawking has been single handedly kicking the heck out of
*idealistic* randomness, even though string theorists still hang-on for
dear life to the idealization of perfect symmetry, which doesn't exist.
Can't blame em really, since many have spent most of their
professional years chasing that avenue for a theory of everything.

Prior to that, Hawking had produced the leading theory * for * the idea
that randomness could be theoretically rationalized by postulating an
infinite number of possible wave-forms that our universe * could * have
landed on. He was then able to use the uncertainty principle to posit
that a random fluction in this infinite potential was what produced our
world.

This is a violation that requires a leap of faith beyond what's
actually observed, in order to claim that things &quot;could&quot; be different
than the observed evidence supports, so it relied heavily on the
assumption that string theory would eventually produce a valid theory
of everything.

Hawking's latest revelation counters that notion, however, as he has
now used Einstein's theory to produced a different theory which
indicates that all the information contained information is * never *
lost, so the &quot;traits&quot; or characteristics that make up our universe are
&quot;convoled&quot; into our time from a previously similar structure.

It turns out that this structure is analgous to an evolutionary leap,
and that defines the special link that humans have to the unviverse,
which is discussed in much depth, here:

www.anthropic-principle.ORG

This includes most of Hawking's shots at string theory.

benna is correct when he talks about subtle determinism, but he's wrong
when he says that the article is wrong about our purpose. He's trying
to &quot;De-anthropomorphisize&quot; that our purpose in nature comes from the
basic entropic physical need of the unverse which manifests itself into
every philosophical aspect of our lives via what is known as
&quot;teleology&quot;. This is the biggest difference

The unverse &quot;cares&quot; plenty... it's just that the name is different for
the same reason/function, or &quot;purpose&quot; that it &quot;needs humans into
existence, and &quot;needs&quot; humans to survive, and enables them to increase
entropy realistically, via a &quot;practicallity-friendly&quot; enviroment.

Just like it need us to leap to a higher order of entropic efficiency
when it caused us to leap from apes to use fire... coal... oil...
hydorogen?.. .as the technology that our intelligence enabled, enabled
us to keep up with time, per the principle of least action, the arrow
of time, and the second law of thermodynamics, in an expanding
universe.

That question mark defines a prediction that you can test. If we are
naturally preferred, then we will survive beyond oil, otherwise...
count the gallons.

The above referred website explains everything that benna didn't get by
not completing his homework... ;)

Still, you posit some external purpose that is seperate from the
universe itself, and you will find that that purpose exists nowhere
but in the human mind. Yes, what you call a &quot;purpose&quot; does occur.
That is, The universe demonstrates the human-concieved laws of
thermodynamics. Evolution is simpler than you make it sound. Groups
of matter that are good at duplicated themselves, tend to exist in the
greatest number. It really is that simple. It does not posit some
external purpose, but simply states a truism. The logic is all
contained within that sentence. Any purpose outside of pure existence
is the superfluous concoction of the human mind. It is not that I
fail to understand what you are saying as much as I think it is
irrelevent. It may well be true from the perspective of physics. But
physics is not in the business of defining &quot;purpose.&quot;

A lot has been said in this post in just a couple of days....and here,
I've missed all of it (!!!). Whoops....I guess that I have some
catching up to do.....

And while I do that, I want to outline some preliminary thoughts, that
maybe someone else can add something to. But here's the outline to a
couple of opinions that I recently wrote down:

1st Evolution doesn't predict (very much)

2nd Evolution doesn't explain very much (i.e. human depth; things such
as love, hate, art, so on and so forth....)

3rd Evolution is more like a religion than a science

So there's some ideas.....if people want to, think about them a little
bit, at least consider their worth....and then critique them if you
like. Note that I did not say laugh or humiliate them. I hope that none
of that has been going on previous to this point either. However seems
to think that either one side or the other is stupid and
idiotic.....they've missed everything already; that person is truly in
the dark.

K, hope to hear back....

We have been debating your 3rd point. Could you justify that claim?
I agree with your first point. It is more of an explanation than a
prediction. The only real prediction it makes is that evolution will
go on happening if the conditions required are met. Your second point
I thik is sort of true. I mean, I think it does explain some of those
things, but maybe not very well. I would be really interested to hear
if anybody has any good evolutionary explanation for dreaming. I
think one probobly exists, but I don't know what it could really be.
But really, it does explain quite a bit, if not perfectly.

mimenarra ... @gmail.com said some stuff:

Where in the heck do you get the idea that I... &quot;posit some *external*
purpose that is separate from the universe&quot;...?

Other than that, you don't understand what an empirically defined
philosophy is... nor do you know how it translates into every aspect of
our existence, so I don't know what to tell you, except that you need
to learn more about it.

Start with ancient Greek sophist, who darned near nailed it,
Hericlitus, except bear in mind that he did not know that the universe
had a predominat expansive tendency that prevents the &quot;cosmic
reconcilliation&quot; that he interpreted.

The difference translates to a different interpretation of nature's
morality, which is that &quot;balance is good&quot;... but you can't get there
from here, so it's all about the journey, &quot;alfie&quot; not actually
arriving.

And that translates into every need that we attempt to satisfy in our
entire lives... including physical, spiritual, intillectual... etc...
etc... etc... people &quot;SEEK&quot; spiritual equilibrium, for one very small
example.

I'll tell ya's what... quit assuming that I don't know what the hell
I'm talking about and try pretending like I do for a minute...
OBVIOUSLY I've done my 20 or so freaking years worth of homework, and I
can tell you right now that you've never met a more concrete philosophy
than the one that falls of of the theory of everything.

benna -

Many scientists beleive that dreaming is your brain going over your
memories as you sleep, solving problems, figuring out what you would do
in certian situations, etc. Some of it is converting your short-term
memory to long-term memory (they are in different parts of the brain.)
This does not include only your memories of reality, but your memories
of things that you have imagined, etc.

However dreaming is a very blurry subject and one not easily studied,
as the experience is different for everyone. One thing that scientists
do know is that without sleeping and dreaming the body undergoes
extreme stress, and that many systems slow down/shut off. Whatever the
reason for it is, we know that it is essential to the healthy
functioning of us as human beings.

I have not read ALL of the posts prior to this, nor do I intend to. I
simply wanted to chime in with the note that perhaps god intelligently
designed the universe and then brought into being conditions from which
the desired result would occur? I just don't like the way that science
seems to be pitted agianst religion here.

There are plenty of verses in holy books that we do not hold to be
true, such as the verses that say we should stone a disobedient child
at the city gates. I don't see why some people need to latch on to
certain scriptures (such as those condemning gay people and saying that
the earth was created in 7 days) and hold them to be true but not
others. It all seems hippocritical to me - a way to manipulate people's
religious beleifs and make &quot;religion&quot; say only what you want it to say.
The only way to be consistent is to look at the big picture of things
and see that what those stories were trying to say is that god was the
originator of everything. And there is nothing that neccesarily says
that god couldn't have been the originator of the one celled organism
that evolved, or the big bang, or the &quot;dimensions&quot; of string theory.

I agree that for both theories one must take certain things on faith.
But the fact is that less must be taken on faith for evolution, and
that before we can attempt (key word) to understand god, we must
attempt to understand the world that he created, and that before we can
do that we must attempt to understand how he created it. Let's use the
brains that god gave us to better understand our existence and by doing
so become closer to him/her.

But perhaps all of this has already been said? If it has I apologize
for my redundancy.

"/> heh... um... you aren't going to like this... and I don't have anything
against god, but the physics on the website that I keep referring:

www.antrhopic-principle.ORG

... says that no originator is necessary.

Check this out:

When we humans, Black Holes, and Supernovae make particles from vacuum
energy, we increase the vacuum because this process leavs &quot;holes&quot; or
&quot;voids&quot; in the vacuum that serve to increase the &quot;suck&quot; of the vacuum
and this causes it to expand naturally as a result of particle pair
production.

The mass energy of the created particles also increase gravity which
serves to offset the increase in negative pressure so tension grows
between the vacuum and ordinary matter as the vacuum expands, as more
and more partilcles are created, until eventually and inevitably the
forces will be compromised and BOOM!... we have another big bang like
the last one and the one before that, as the process continues
perpetually forward in time in the never ending effort toward
idealistically pure symmetry.

Each time that the universe &quot;bangs&quot;... it leaps to higher orders of
entropic efficiency, or a more effecient form of the same basic
structure... like humans from apes, and for the very same reason.

Joe:
How were they able to test whether it was the dreaming or just the REM
sleep that was necessary?

Some very good points. I don't personally believe in a creator god,
but I have no problem with your position really. You do not seem to
be saying that organisms require a god because of their complexity and
all of that. You are willing to admit that evolution is almost
certainly how it happened. I am more bothered by those that take the
position of the intelligent design movement. (that is, an a posteriori
argument for god).

"/> No doubt we differ, and that is not your fault, but the stuff on &quot;my&quot;
website, especially the physics, stands alone for it's merrits. If you
can understand it, then there is no argument. At least, none that I've
ever encountered from theorectical research physicists anyway. You can
find links to some of those important conversations on the front page,
but the contents page tells the story of how it all came about.

Yes it's my site, but yes, I am very strongly supported by the most
conservative science that exists. That website is proven to be for
real in the eyes of sceince, regardless of the fact that I'm the
author. But the reason that I had to keep linking it was because
people would be saying some of the stuff that they probably wouldn't be
saying if they'd just DO the considered research that I keep trying to
get them to do.

I don't need to link it to prove a damned thing... As demonstrated I
already know what it says, and I know that the physics that I last gave
is extremely important, and it is also as good as it SHOULD be obvious
that I know what I'm talking about. The physics that I gave isn't that
hard to understand, in other words, and if you have even half a clue,
then you should know how obviously important what I've said really is.

Anyway... I never would have gotten onto you the way that I did at
first, had you not made such a hard factual statement out of something
that isn't played out by the creation &quot;scientists&quot; before the public
the way that you originally portrayed that it was. What you said most
certainly is what is behind the creation agenda, because it's real easy
for them to laugh at their own idea that this &quot;proven&quot; designer... was
an alien.

Bottom line tho... As long as people like Steven Meyer stick within
that &quot;alien manipulation&quot; constraint, then they have a distantly
plausible scientific hypothesis for which they can throw all kinds of
garbage out as evidence that they don't care about the true validity
of. It's the &quot;distantly plausible&quot; part that makes it a ludicrous
means to attack evolutionary theory, although evolutionists do need to
incoperate natural favoritism which will do away with the chaotic BS
that literally nobody else buys-into.

I do not really dispute your science. Admittedly, my knowledge of
physics does not extend much beyond reading books by Steven Hawking,
Mechio Kaku, and other writers of theoretical physics books for the
general public. But I am willing to accept that from the scientific
side, everything you say is true. Still, I think you abuse the word
&quot;purpose.&quot; Cause and purpose are two seperate concepts. You may
describe perfectly the cause of our existence. Purpose, however,
implies some form of consciousness with intentionality. As far as the
purpose of life goes, I don't think there can really be any purpose
outside of existence itself. The purpose of existence is to exist.
There may be many scientific causes of existence, and that is really
all well and good, and I think we should continue to study the causes,
but why should anything exist all? You may tell me HOW things can
exist. You may tell me the cause (or lack of a necessity for a
cause), and I believe you, but this cause is not a purpose. I would
like to say that although I am willing to accept your science for the
sake of argument, you do seem to be a bit arrogant about your ideas.
They may be true, but you seem sure almost to the point of being
unscientific. Almost to the point of religious dogma. But this is
more of a personal issue than one relating to the argument, so am
still quite willing to give you the benafit of the doubt.

Well that seems to me to contradict much of what I have read, but no
matter, it doesn't answer my question anyway. Great, so there are
these bangs happening, there is a universe expanding, etc. Great, but
why should that happen at all? Whats the purpose of it all? Seems to
me to be just a bunch of energy playing games with itself. You are
very good at explaining, but this doesn't answer the question of why
there should be anything to explain in the first place. If there was
no first cause (and I believe that there was not) then that takes away
the need for a cause of it all. It does not, however, eliminate the
question of purpose.

The purpose is thermal equilibrium, but you can't get there from here,
so the game is never ending.

The effect is the cause of the effect, because it is the breakdown of
matter in an expanding universe that releases the high-energy photons
that make particles from vacuum energy which eventually cause the big
bang.

Yeah, it's different than what you've heard because it's all very new,
but that doesn't change the fact that the physics is valid and very
clearly stated in layman's terms.

You can research, &quot;rarefaction via condensation&quot; for a very simple
explanation of how the condensation of energy increases negative
pressure. Imagine what happens to a stretched rubber band when you
twist the middle of it into a knot. It pulls back harder, (an
antigravity effect), and the knot represents a created particle once
you twist enough of it to achieve positive density and pressure, which
increases gravity as well.

Here's a recent conversation in the physicist moderated research group
that explains everything in more depth:

My comment about having not heard that theory before was really more
of a sidenote. I am not physicist, so my not having heard of it
doesn't mean much. My main point still stand though. You say the
purpose is thermal equalibrium, but I ask you, what is the purpose of
having such a purpose? I'm really trying to get to the root of the
matter. We can go on and on about HOW things happen. Things go
towards thermal equilibrium, and on and on. But at the CORE, there
still remains the question of what the purpose of any of it existing
at all, including the laws. You see? What is the purpose of thermal
equilibrium? It all comes down to the suchness of things (to steal a
word from buddhism).

Your running into never ending dichotomy trying to find purpose.
Someone can always say &quot;this is the purpose&quot;, but then someone else can
always turn around and say, &quot;well what is the purpose of that&quot;? It
becomes the problem of the infinite regression of purposes. If one day

take it at face value, or would you turn around and ask &quot;Well what is

"/> The bottom line though, (in typical context with the creation/evolution

implies sentience in order that he can argue that functional mechanisms
in nature aren't the result of forethought, and, therefore, cannot be
construed as evidence for design.

What he's denying is that &quot;intent&quot;... in both cases, is just a human
expression for the physical need that exists behind the functional
result... in both cases.

All he has to do is attach &quot;intelligent&quot; to &quot;design&quot; and there's no
argument, but evolutionists commonly don't want to have to do that,
even though &quot;purposeful design in nature&quot; is exactly the angle that
Steven Meyer is using to support the ID movement.

Purpose:
The object toward which one strives or for which something exists; an
aim or a goal.
A result or effect that is intended or desired; an intention. See
synonyms at intention.
Determination; resolution: He was a man of purpose.

&quot;i&quot; wrote some stuff about ID:

I might add that the reason that evolutionists don't typically want to
recognize purpose in nature, is due to that whole random, chaotic,
meaningless line of thinking that comes from the &quot;belief&quot; that
idealizations like &quot;infinity&quot; and &quot;pure randomness&quot; can actually exist
in our &quot;IMPERFECT&quot; world.

You can only get this idealization from a perfectly balanced universe,
(or by leaping to an infinitie &quot;possible&quot; number of universes). A
universe that expresses a predominant tendency toward expansion
expresses a very slight &quot;right-winged&quot; BIAS toward the big business end
of energy consumption in order to keep up the the second law of
thermodynamics. The &quot;Greens&quot; represent the efficiency end of this, as
the big business tendency would run-away and we would surely die if we
got ahead of time in terms of our energy consumption.

Now that I've pissed off the liberals... ;)

Just an FYI, but it is the inherent imperfection in the energy of the
universe that creates the disequilbrium that the universe perpetually
moves to satisfy.

In regard to the argument about the universe not needing an origin...
I'm still not sure if I understand it correctly. As it is it seems as
if you are saying that the universe is constantly exploding and
imploding upon itself, and that it has been going on for eternity.
However the energy that keeps recycling itself still must have came
from somewhere. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, right?

Because... every last shred of evidence that we have at our disposal

nothing can even exist, and, it therefore requires a leap of faith,
since &quot;nothing&quot; is not evidenced.

The physics says that everything in this uiverse was in the last one,

&gt; Your running into never ending dichotomy trying to find purpose.
&gt; Someone can always say &quot;this is the purpose&quot;, but then someone else can
&gt; always turn around and say, &quot;well what is the purpose of that&quot;? It
&gt; becomes the problem of the infinite regression of purposes. If one day

&gt; take it at face value, or would you turn around and ask &quot;Well what is

Island:
Sentience is not above nature, nor is nature about sentience. I see
sentience as a property of nature. What, pray tell, is what &quot;we
humans recognise as our purpose in the game&quot;? I would say that the
purpose is the purposes people think they have, but not in the way you
would think. The purpose is in the direct act of comming up with a
purpose, and not what that concept points to. Now of couse, the
purpose is also in the expanding universe, the following of the laws
of thermodynamics, all of it. But we must not place the laws above
the actual universe. The laws do not exist in nature, and they do not
cause anything. The universe does what it doesn, and the laws follow
THAT. Alas, I think I am still being misunderstood, as I'm sure you
feel as well. I do hope you do not take me to be anti-scientifc
reason or anything like that.

Excuse me did I say &quot;just.&quot; If you really want to know, I think
sentience defines the &quot;laws&quot; of nature. I think the universe is one
massive body of quasi-free will, which defines its own laws through
its own self consciousness. I feel as if I am intending to type this
sentence because I am intending to do so. That intent is what defines
the laws of nature, not the other way around. But really, I'm sorry
if I made it seem as though I didn't think sentience was a big enough
deal. With regard to purpose, I thought that you were refering to the
standard purposes people say they have, such as &quot;success&quot; or whatever.
I thought you meant that those purposes come out of the purpose you
state, that is, to follow the laws of thermodynamics and such. If I
misinterpreted you I appoligise. I think much of this argument stems
from misinterpretation. If I understand your last post correctly, I

Just to remind everyone, there is a way to avoid misunderstandings and
contention when trying to help others to understand our reasoning. If
you lay your arguments out in a systematic way then that gives the
other the opportunity to first determine the validity of your argument,
and then to determine the soundness of your argument. It makes for
much better discussion, and less contention. Can't we all just get a
long.

Here are some examples of simple format's that can be used in arguing.
If A then B
A
Therfore B

If A then B
Not B
Therefore not A

Either A or B
Not A
Therefore B

Either A or B
If A then C
If B Then D
Therefore Either C or D

These are very basic and simple way's of arguing, but when you argue
this way (you'll have to fill the blanks in your self) then your
argument will be valid. That makes the argument easier because then we
can attack the premisies, and make much more progress in understanding
one another. Maybe we should start a thread where we teach one another
Basic Logic. Anyone up for it?

What if I was to put forward the proposition that the purpose of the
earth is to rain. Could I not, in theory, show that every action on
earth is part of a long causal chain of events which cause rain?
Extending that even further, could I not say the the purpose of the
entire universe is for the earth to rain? I could show the same, even
longer, causal chain. This is obviousy absurd. All sorts of things
happen in the universe. We could make a simlar statement, that the
purpose of the universe is to create the big dipper constalation as
observed from earth. There are an infinite number of possible
purposes by this method. The purpose you put forward, that is, to
seak equilibrium, is another purpose just like the ones described
above. The only difference is, your purpose is somewhat more direct.
It is easier to show that particles way out in space are seaking
equilibrium than fascilitating rain on earth. But this difference
does not make your purpose any more valid. Any purpose based on some
perticular physical phenomenon has this flaw. There is only one way
to avoid this problem without resorting to the supernatural. All
physical phenomena must be seen as the purpose at once. The purpose
of raining is to rain. The purpose of my typing this is to type this.
The purpose of life is to live. I see no other way out.

I haven't been following this thread too closely, but the little that
I've read has sparked some questions in my mind. First of all, what is
this equilibrium that you speak of island? How would know something is
striving for equilibrium? Is there a way to measure equilibrium? Is
there an absolute state of equilibrium? Has anyone every experienced
an absolute state of equilibrium? If they haven't, then how do you
know something is going in that direction? I'm speaking igonorantly
here, frankly because I am ignorant of this issue, and I would like
clarification. This also seems to go against what the pre-socratic
philosopher Heraclitus said. He said that the only thing that we can
rightly say is &quot;real&quot; is opposition. He talked about how experience
itself is grounded in opposition and if it wasn't for opposition then
there would be nothing. But from the little bit that I've read of your
posts you seem to be going contrary to what he said. You seem to be
saying that everything is striving for equilibrium. Again I don't know
how you would be able to know if everything was striving for
equilbrium, but now that I think about it, as long as you don't claim
that one day there may be actual equilibrium, then you might still be
in agreeance with Heraclitus. As you can tell I'm rambling, I need
more imput before I can gather my thoughts.

From my understanding, Island is arguing for a very spacific physical
equilibrium, which is well defined by physics. Also from my
understandin, I think it matches quite well with the ideas of
Heraclitus. I have my own seperate objections to his idea, but I
don't think the definition of equilibrium is the problem. That said,
I'm sure island could better answer you.

"/> What's with all this hosility? Calm down. I said nothing insulting to
you, and I expect my civility to be reciprocated. You have this
tendancy to see everyone who doesn't understand your arguments or agree
with you as some sort of crazy religious fanatic who rejects all
science. The fact is that we are all seekers here, and I that anyone
who didn't want to use their brain to understand god and the world
wouldn't be posting on this forum. If your argument is really so simple
and easy to understand, then please - clarify it for me. Because that's
all that I was asking for. A clarification of your argument.

Basically what I was asking about was how causuality was not violated.
You cited the reason basically by saying that it was impossible for
nothing to exist and that the matter in this universe was in the last
one. But if the matter was in the last one, then it had to have been in
the one before that, and the one before that, and the one before that.
If &quot;the process continuing perpetually forward in time&quot; then you say
that it all exists within the constraints of time. So if it all exists
within the constraints of time then every reaction (the explosion and
implosion of a universe) must have had some sort of action that caused
it (Which you cite as the explosion and implosion of a universe) What
i'm getting at is that the energy that is constantly being recycled, if
existing within the constraints of time, (Following the law of
causality,) must have had some sort of original action.

Even if it did not violate the law of casuality, your argument that
there is no evidence of &quot;nothing&quot; existing is not logically sound. I
ask you how there would be evidence of nonexistence? It is no harder to
prove nonexistence than it is to prove eternality (is that a word?)

Also there I think that, atleast to my rudimentary understanding, the
string seem to contradict your argument. But alas, this is an area in
which I am sadly remiss.

I do not mean to provoke you, and I do not wish to start some sort of
bloody name calling match. I only wish to discuss philosophy without
being insulted or treated as inferior. If I misunderstand your
argument, please correct me!

"/> Your understanding is very much in line with the philosophy that falls
out of this. You've very much got the right idea, in other words, and
Hericlitus is one of my heros now a days... :)

In terms the physics, I'm talking about the entropic thermodynamic
tendency that is inherent to the total energy of the universe, per the
arrow of time, in an expanding universe ** that has an incresasing
negative pressure component **

What you said above about Hericlitus was dead on the money with
reality, but opposition comes from the disequilibrium that is caused by
the inherent asymmetry that exists between matter and antimatter. That
just means that there is an inherent inequity between the two that
cannot be recocilled, so the universe must necessarily move perpetually
forward in time in a never ending effort to &quot;satisfy&quot; the second law of
thermodynamics.

Hericlitus and most other physicists since that time thought that the
universe was ultimately &quot;static&quot;, or reconcilable... but it isn't, so
that changes the philosophy just enough to make it universally
accurate. That doesn't mean that I'm saying that the universe is
infinite either though, rather it is finite and nearly flat as a
necessary consequence of the high-energy thermodynamic process which
keeps the universe at a * near * static balance.

It turns out that this near static balance is also known as &quot;puntuated
equilibruim&quot; in evolutionary theory, and the physics that causes the
universe to have a big bang is the same physics that causes a human to
have an evolutionary leap to a higher order of entropic
efficiency...where the * common * physics derives that...

A big bang is to an evolutionary leap...

... what punctuated equilibria is to a &quot;near&quot;-static universe.

That comes from a new understanding of Dirac's hole theory, and Dirac
also came up with the Large Numbers Hypothesis from which Robert Dicke
got the Anthropic Principle from.

This new understanding about the physics fixes Dirac's Cosmology as
well as to complete the Anthropic Principle in the manner that I have
described, above.

This article is worth reviewing to understand more about Causality as
it pertains to Dirac's Hole Theory and Einstenin's Static Cosmological
model:

I am growing tired of your condescending attitude. Not everyone that
disagrees with you is ignorant. Many people that disagree with you
are just as sure that they are right as you are. How do you know you
aren't just like them, wrong? I do not question your science for the
purpose of the argument but your certainty actually makes me doubt
your science. Now with regard to you statement about absolutes, it is
simply false. You have not proven an absolute. You say &quot;rain isn't
the predominant inclination of the universe.&quot; How can you say this
however? Look, everything that has happened in the universe thus far
was necessary to cause the exact universe we see before us. I hope
you would agree to that. Now, I could pick some single event that is
what hte point is, and say that everything outside of that event is
just necessary for the event to occor. So it could be, that the
entire current state of the universe, along with all the past states
of the universe were just necesary for me to be sitting here typing.
If any of those things were changed, through a long causal chain I
would be somehow different, probobly not typing this, or maybe even
not here at all. This can be compared to your theory. You say that
all of the universe is in search of equilibrium. If anything was
changed in the state of the universe in the past, the universe would
not have been searching for equilibrium. It would have disrupted that
goal, in exactly the same way that any change in the past would have
disrupted my typing this. This does not require that the universe
ever reach equilibrium. It would have disrupted the goal of simply
searching for it. Of course, both of these propositions are equally
absurd. We have no real way of picking which one is the &quot;true&quot;
purpose. Entropy feels more universal, but in reality it is not. The
only way around this, as I have argued, is for every event to be the
purpose. &quot;The seed is as much the point as the flower,&quot; as Alan Watts
said.

Well there we have it. Your reasoning boils down to &quot;BECAUSE IT IS **
INNATE**.&quot; Who is the one basing what they say on faith now? I am
the skeptic. You can't tell me why my example is incorrect, only that
you are right because you are right. I mean, I know you have all your
scientific evidence, and thats great, and it may well all be right,
but that doesn't help you on the philosophical side. Sure, the
universe has a predominant entropic inclination, and all that, but
your leap of faith is that that is THE point. Cearly, the universe
also has the inclination to create you, or you wouldn't be here. Why
doesn't that make you the point?

You can do all the name calling you want, but it doesn't answer my
arguments. Your &quot;irrefutable evidence only relates to the fact that
the universe tends towards equilibrium, but not that equilibrium is
the point. There is a leap of faith between those two positions that
you cannot bridge with any logic or science. I do not think that all
opinions are necessarily equally valid. I only wish we could have a
more civilized debate in which people are more open to others
arguments, which they may then deem to be incorrect. But there is
always the possiblity that you are wrong, and you must have some
intellecual humility and accept that. I am a liberal. I'm a
libertarian socialist if you must know. I can also be rightly called
a relativist I suppose. Still the fact remains, you can not prove me
wrong with logic, and so you resort to name calling.

NO I DO NOT! I accept every word of your science. Every empirical
fact you put forward I accept. The breakdown is in your leap from,
&quot;everything tends toward equilibrium,&quot; to &quot;the purpose of everything
is to tend toward equlibrium.&quot; I don't know how I can say this more

"/> That's false, look at the posts around you... you defy the established
rules science at every turn.

You cannot do what you are trying to do without making the leap of
faith to assume an infinite number of universes, because the Copernican
Principle does not extend into the time domain of an expanding,
NON-STATIC universe.

I've explained this in different terms and in many different ways now,
but you still insist on trying to deny your leap of faith, by
challenging my philosophy.

First, you have to establish where your chaotic idea fits.

In order to do that, you have to make a leap of faith that is not
justified.

I make no such leaps and my philosophy is observationally defined,
making it the preferred theory per occam since it is the most accurate
reflection of nature in the least possible number of steps.

And that's all there is to it, Mr. Armchair Philosopher... You don't
know the rules.

island,
Actually all we observe are contingent movements in the universe. We
never experience the one necessary movement. So really what we've
never observed is the first mover (big bang, god, etc.). So an
infinite amount of movers seems to fit in better with our observable
world.

I must establish nothing scientifically because I make no scientific
claims. It is all logical. Let me try, yet again, to explain it to
you. All events in the past, added togeather, create sufficient cause
for my existence. Remove any of them, and I would not be here. Now,
in the same way, all the events of the past are sufficient cause to
show that the universe is following all of the physical laws you have
described. Remove any event and your laws would be broken. These are
exactly the same situation. There is no way to say that either your
theory or my existence is somehow, more the point, because there is no
real difference in the situation. Suffient cause for both would be
broken with a change in just one past event.

"/> No, we directly observe and measure every object in the universe racing
away from every other object at an accelerating rate. As I've stated
elsewhere in this thread that the basics of big bang theory are
supported by a ton of different evidence from a whole bunch of
different branches of science, as well all of the most conservative
theories, and even the cutting edge junk like string theory includes it
in the grand scheme of chaos.

*sigh*

You dismiss me as a crackpot, and claim to have proven me wrong but
you have never done so. You have never shown exactly why my
comparison of my existence being the point and equalibrium being the
point fails. All I hear are broad claims about how equilibrium is
&quot;innate,&quot; but no evidence to support the claim. YOU CANNOT SHOW ME
WHY YOURS IS AN ABSOLUTE AND MINE IS BULLSHIT. You only claim that
you already have. I think you really are genuine. I think you are
simply so sure of your theory, that you cannot see the different angle
I am comming from. I do not wish to debate you on the scientific
merits. I grant that everything you say about science is true.
Still, every time you try to prove me wrong, you try to use your
scientiic evidence. This does not work. You must prove why my logic
is wrong. Prove to me how my existence, and the trend towards
equilibrium are different, or you are the crackpot who ignores reason.
I do try to avoid name-calling, but you simply do not answer my
arguments. You just go back to your same old ones.

I completely agree. Island, we want to discuss this with you. But if
you are going to keep acting in this manner, please stop. Cussing
someone out on the internet becuase they do not agree with you is
immature and unncecesary. Calm down! We would really love to discuss
this theory with you. But if you did not want to debate, than you never
should have posted on this forum to begin with. This is not the &quot;post
your ideas and have everyone agree with you&quot; message board. Having a
discussion is great, but when it gets to this point I think that it
needs to end.

We all came to discuss philosophy. Intelligently. Like adults. So far
you have mocked, cussed out, and dismissed every single person who did
not agree with you. What are you, fourteen? Either chill out or get out.
