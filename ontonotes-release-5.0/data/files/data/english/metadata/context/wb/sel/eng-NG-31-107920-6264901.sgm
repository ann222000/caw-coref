Why? For reporting what's happening in Hicktown, US? From what I read
there isn't even any "Brit" opinion in the piece, just some quoting of
fellow Hicks.

You seem inordinately upset. Perhaps you'd like to muzzle the press, for
telling the truth?

It seems you're the wimp.

Many good Americans have guns and are fine people.  Sal is an example.

Camadians have a lot of them too.   Percentage-wise, close to American
levels with 1/4th of the gun crime rate.

Then there's Israel, where its like Switzerland, a militia and
responsibility.

Low gun crime all the same.

Then there's the good old USA, where gun ownership is a dubious
constitutional mandate with stories of violence that only movies are made
of.

IIRC my father told me that when in Switzerland, the weapons they used
in the compulsory army were taken home once the service came to an end
(tanks and aircrafts aside), hence that weapon remained their property
for the rest of his life. But then again, anyone who has been in
Switzerland knows there almost no need for crime there (and i mean
robberies), you can't draw a parallel between Switz.and other western
countries which cities have more citizens that Switz. altogheter.

How about comparing Switzerland to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania

There's telling the truth, and then there's a loosely fact based

In vacuo the US firearms death toll looks horrendous, but how about as
compared to how many Brits or Norwegians drink themselves to death?

That said, I've finally renounced the NRA.

This one was simply too much.  It wasn't just another case of trash
killing trash or unjust community values coming home to roost. And
while stricter laws nationwide will never stop the truly evil or
deranged, they will stop the majority of random handgun killings.

&gt;&gt; Indeed. &quot;Experience&quot; and don't you forget that. One day, when you face

&gt;Wimp, if someone holds you at gunpoint within arm's reach, the aggressor

I'll give this one more try to see if you have an ounce of sense.

The morgue is full of people who thought like you and you are grossly
underestimating criminals.
Anyway, neither will they give you a warning, that they are about to
put a gun to your head.
And whether he is pointing that sawn off in your face, or from 10 feet
away makes little difference to your likelyhood of survival if you try
to reach for your trusty 38 or indeed try to go for his gun. Measure
the time it takes for your arm to reach 2 feet away, now measure how
long it takes you to pull a trigger. Weep freely when finished.

And if you still think you can, then it comes down to :
1) Do you know exactly what to look for and how to properly measure up
your opponent, the situation and thus your chances if you do take
action ?
2) Do you then know exactly what to do and have you gone through it
hundreds of times with real opponents so you would have the confidence
to even try ?

Ask someone to think about all that for you and evaluate the
usefulness of your weapon in a real situation.

The bottom line is that you simply *feel* safer because of your
weapon. And that is ok by me if it makes you feel better, but the
likelyhood of that weapon ever being used for self defence is very
little, unless you are expecting "visitors" at noon.

What you need to do is to weigh your right of arms up against your law
makers inability to control the possession of guns in a safe and
managable way. When 12 year olds can gain access to them and shoot up
a class full of students, you need to take note and look at what's
happening. Even you can't be blind enough to see that there is
something very, very wrong over there ?

Giving the teachers guns ? WTF for, he/she will be the first down and
you are still left with a class room of innocent dead kids..  Perhaps
turn their desk into a machine gun nest for more stopping power and
added protection ? But then again, little Joe will just lob a grenade
or mol-cock over the sandbags, between two spoons full of his Coco
Pops.

This is not just about guns, it's a whole mentality which you guys
must address, or it will just keep escalating until it's like the
'good old west' over there. Some of you anal gun freaks will just have
to bite the bullet and allow for some form of controlling the
ownership of all those weapons and properly enforcing some strict
rules.

No you never struck any "sports", except perhaps from your itenary,

I didn't say ban guns you reactionary ignoramus, just make them as
minimally difficult to get out there in Dumbfuckistan as here in NY.
There hasn't been a murder committed with a registered weapon in my
county since the regulations were enacted decades ago.

People, like you, who can't differentiate between a genuine threat and
room full of Amish school girls have no right to possess weapons of
any sort.

It cannot reasonably be construed that the framers intended to extend
the 2nd amendment untested to every twisted psycho-sexually
maladjusted village idiot on the North American continent.

&gt;Few would say you live in Freedom, Mark. NY, and particularly NYC, are

&gt;Spare me the hysterics. Shrill emotionalism is the mark of a mental
&gt;misfit. You're better than that, but you've been bred into dependence.

&gt;&gt; It cannot reasonably be construed that the framers intended to extend

&gt;In point of fact, it was intended to extend to everyone, thus minimizing
&gt;the threat of the defectives. Nothing so disturbs aim as return fire.

&gt;You New Yorkers are so willing to send yourselves into bondage to
&gt;preserve perceived safety. Today, we had a tragedy of a plane hitting a
&gt;building along the East River. Some NY Cop, and Congressmen King and
&gt;Rangel were on the television talking about the need to close off the
&gt;airspace over Manhattan.

&gt;Fucking please. Two people have been killed in acidental plane crashes
&gt;in Manhattan in what, the last 60 years, and New Yorkers fly into a
&gt;panic to preserve their safety.

&gt;Fucking cowards. You can make all the cowardly laws you want, but if
&gt;someone wants to make Manhattan a target, you're easy pickens', and
&gt;you'll have nothing to defend yourselves with except your Broadway
&gt;showbills and Gucci bags.

&gt;You're not to be taken seriously out there in Frailica.
">

Are you really such a thick fellow or do you just place one on usenet?

It's "argument" has devolved to you pigfuckers justifying children
being slaughtered out there in Dumbfuckistan, for no better "reason"
than maintaining the status quo of it being easier to get a handgun in
some places than is to get NYC hack license, and if you knew anything
about NYC that didn't issue forth from Heston's mouth or Carl Rove's
ass you'd know you don't even need a driver's license to get a NYC
hack ticket.

Criminal, mental health, and civic responsibility tests are not an
unreasonable impediment to any reasonable person's right to own
handgun.
