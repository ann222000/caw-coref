Hi guys
I am going to buy a new Macbook Pro and I'll buy it on the Apple
Store.

I have to Choose the Dispay: Gloosy or normal...

I have never seen the glossy Display and I can't find one to give it a
look

Can you please explain me which are the differences and give me an
advice

Thanks in advance
Max

It's only a matter of taste. The pro models have matte as default, the
macbooks have glossy.

Are there any Apple stores in your area?

Matte screens aren't quite as sharp and have lower contrast. The
advantage is they don't show obvious reflections.

However, even this is something of a double-edged sword. All that light
is still hitting the screen, but instead of producing a clear
reflection, it diffuses through the surface. Some people find this less
distracting, but in very bright lighting conditions (i.e. sunlight),
light hitting the screen from a wide range of angles can reduce contrast
so much that it's very hard to see the screen.

Glossy screens are often perfectly usable under such lighting
conditions, because you can just angle them a few degrees differently to
avoid direct reflections.

I checked them both out at the Fifth Ave. Apple store in NYC, which is a
pretty good testing environment because a lot of sunlight bounces in
through the glass stairwell in the center, and Apple has laptops set up
that face it directly. I went with glossy and I've been completely happy
with the choice.

my mind
€ the color on the glossy screens is really nice
but the reflections were too distracting for me

€ and as for less contrast on the matte screen,
i went into the universal access pref pane
and bumped up the contrast a little

€ i'm really happy with the matte screen, especially
out in the world with unpredictable and
uncontrollable lighting conditions

€ i suggest you don't buy anything until you get a
chance to compare them for yourself

The problem with looking at glossy screens in the store is that
they have lots and lots of overhead lights creating those
reflections.

In your home, you tend to have lamps with lamp shades that diffuse
the light.

I have a glossy MacBook, and I really don't notice reflections.  I
also take my MacBook to work, and I can generally adjust the angle
and the location of my MacBook at work.

Then again, my wife got a matte MacBook Pro :-)

hi Bob

€ i find myself in different environments often,
restaurants, coffee houses, outdoor patios,
offices, parks, etc.
€ i figured that if the lighting in the apple
store created problems, then i was likely to
run into those problems elsewhere

I didn't have the opportunity to compare them in the flesh before
ordering my MacBook Pro (glossy screen) last week from Apple's online
store but the Apple guy said not to worry because if I wasn't happy
with the glossy screen I can send it back within 14 days.

I figure that since I will be connecting it up most of the time to my
office Cinema Display, I only need to be concerned about use in travel
and maybe outdoors in the summer - for which the glossy screen will
hopefully be the better bet. The best of both worlds... I do know that
my existing G4 Titanium laptop display is fairly grim outdoors so the
only way is up.

You don't need an Apple Store to look at new Macbooks, outher outlets
have them, too.

In Austria, I've seen them at Conrad and Mediamarkt. Haven't looked in
Northern Italy yet, per que non vorrai un macbook italiano ... :-&gt;

Where exactly do you live?

? then if nothing else look at any laptop computers
with glossy and matte screens
? that will give you at least some ideas
? it's better than nothing

? i really like my matte screen
? and you can always bump up the contrast of the screen
to liven up the color if you like

? and besides, you'll probably be happy with whatever
you end up buying

All the above sentence fragments begin with question marks but none of
them poses a question.  Off to the bit bucket with you.

I was worried about buying a MacBook with the glossy screen because my
aged eyeballs are very glare sensitive.  Matte versions were not
available in my university bookstore, however, and I also didn't want to
pay the additional amount, or have the additional size and weight), for
the Macbook Pro, which was available in matte.

I bought the glossy-screen MacBook, have had it for several months now,
used it in widely varying environments and lighting conditions -- it's
*not* been a problem at all.
