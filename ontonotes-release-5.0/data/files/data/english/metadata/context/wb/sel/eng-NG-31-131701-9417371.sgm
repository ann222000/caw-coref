I plan to be at all eleven.  But I will be delegating members of my
staff to represent me.
Physically, I'll be in SF - what a fucking great place to
march.....memories.
Was anyone out on the streets after Moscone &amp; Milk were killed?  Heavy
times, those.
But off topic, apologies.

No I'm not *in*..This is not the way to honor the sacrifice of our
troops. The Coalition (mainly the US) goes into Iraq and causes major
upheaval. I wasn't for it but we (the President via a Senate
authorization) made the decision to take Saddam Hussein out.
Therefore, we have an obligation to the people that have stood and are
standing with us (Kurds, Shiites and now Sunnis). Violence is down. Al
Qaeda rejected. Let's not abandon them. Interesting that the same
people who are going wild to GET US OUT OF IRAQ NOW are the ones that
want us to make the Sudan or Burma a better place. Thank god Hillary
Clinton and Nancy Pelosi are stable people.

I strongly disagree with you, but what I'm protesting as well
is the administration's attempts to take away your freedom to express
your opinion,
as well as destruction of your world, not just the middle east
countries we've deplorably destroyed.

Yeah, well, I've read that there are still 20% of the people who think Nixon
wasn't guilty...  There will always be some delusional people who refuse to
see the truth when it's right in front of them.  The truth here is that what
we have done by occupying Iraq is the cause of the problems, not the cure,
and that the longer we stay, the worse it gets.  I usually suggest to people
who think we need to stay to solve the problems in Iraq that they seek out
some Iraqi people and just ask them what they think.  As for keeping the war
going to honor the troops who have died, that's just insane.  I know lots of
Iraq vets and they certainly don't agree with that, either.

and nobody is suggesting that we just up and leave without a plan for taking
care of the Iraqis.  The plan is for multinational forces to come in as
peacekeepers and for us to leave as they arrive.  Do something that makes
sense for a change.

I am under no illusions that our adminstration will do anything but continue
on the course they've begun.  They went in for the oil and they won't want
to leave until they get those oil agreements signed.  That's why I think it
is important that as many people as possible get out there on the 27th so
they, and the world, can see that we do not want that and we will not stand
for it to continue.

Well, our foreign policy in the Middle East has always been predicated
on oil, no matter the administration.  Oil of course is the blood-line
of our economy.  Our freedoms would be in great jeopardy if our current
economy were to suddenly collapse, so rash decisions based on emotion
are not the order of the day IMO when it comes to Iraq.  Anyway, what's
particularly scary about this administration is the overly idealistic
neo-con vision they have of the world.  Oil contracts are easily signed
without invading countries.  Spreading American styled democracy around
the world is a pipe dream and we happen to have a sizable group of
intellectuals who believe in that pipe dream.  What's scary is that
those intellectuals have sold many politicans to their cause.  Take a
look at Giuliani for instance.  He's no oil guy.  But he certainly is
now a neo-con.  The legacy of the neo-con Bush administration will sadly
be with us for decades to come.  It will make even the fiercest of
liberals long for the days of a more pragmatic Republican foreign policy.

I'm with you.  In actuality, the Internet is a far more useful tool for
protesting than street marches.  No one really takes marches seriously
any more.  In fact, large groups of people have marched against the Iraq
war from the get-go and it's served little to no purpose at all.  Part
of this has to do with the political groups that organize the rallies in
the first place.  These rallies aren't exactly inclusive of all
political views after all.  Even back when I marched against the first
Iraq war, which many would argue was a more just war, it had little to
no effect on the public consciousness.  We live now in a fragmented and
specialized society.  People tend to have more subtle views on the war
now and don't exactly want to line up with a group of people who will
have speeches on how some radical should be let out of prison or other
such side issues.

Iraqis' Own Surge Assessment: Few See Security Gains

ABC News/BBC/NHK National Survey of Iraq Finds Worsening Public
Attitudes
Sept. 10, 2007

More Iraqis say security in their local area has gotten worse in the
last six months than say it's gotten better, 31 percent to 24 percent,
with the rest reporting no change. Far more, six in 10, say security
in the country overall has worsened since the surge began, while just
one in 10 sees improvement.

More directly assessing the surge itself -- a measure that necessarily
includes views of the United States, which are highly negative -- 65
to 70 percent of Iraqis say it's worsened rather than improved
security, political stability and the pace of redevelopment alike...

More than six in 10 now call the U.S.-led invasion of their country
wrong, up from 52 percent last winter. Fifty-seven percent call
violence against U.S. forces acceptable, up six points. And despite
the uncertainties of what might follow, 47 percent now favor the
immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq -- a 12-point rise.

Experts Doubt Drop In Violence in Iraq

By Karen DeYoung
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, September 6, 2007; Page A16

The U.S. military's claim that violence has decreased sharply in Iraq
in recent months has come under scrutiny from many experts within and
outside the government, who contend that some of the underlying
statistics are questionable and selectively ignore negative trends.

Reductions in violence form the centerpiece of the Bush
administration's claim that its war strategy is working...

Others who have looked at the full range of U.S. government statistics
on violence, however, accuse the military of cherry-picking positive
indicators and caution that the numbers -- most of which are
classified -- are often confusing and contradictory. &quot;Let's just say
that there are several different sources within the administration on
violence, and those sources do not agree,&quot; Comptroller General David
Walker told Congress on Tuesday in releasing a new Government
Accountability Office report on Iraq...

&quot;Depending on which numbers you pick,&quot; he said, &quot;you get a different
outcome.&quot; Analysts found &quot;trend lines . . . going in different
directions&quot; compared with previous years, when numbers in different
categories varied widely but trended in the same direction. &quot;It began
to look like spaghetti.&quot;

Among the most worrisome trends cited by the NIE was escalating
warfare between rival Shiite militias in southern Iraq that has
consumed the port city of Basra and resulted last month in the
assassination of two southern provincial governors. According to a
spokesman for the Baghdad headquarters of the Multi-National Force-
Iraq (MNF-I), those attacks are not included in the military's
statistics. &quot;Given a lack of capability to accurately track Shiite-on-
Shiite and Sunni-on-Sunni violence, except in certain instances,&quot; the
spokesman said, &quot;we do not track this data to any significant degree.&quot;

Attacks by U.S.-allied Sunni tribesmen -- recruited to battle Iraqis
allied with al-Qaeda -- are also excluded from the U.S. military's
calculation of violence levels.

If you replace money with economics I'm with you.  Money alone equates
with individual greed being the primary drive.  I think what drives our
foreign policy however is far more complex.  There's an ideology behind
the neo-con movement that sees government playing a powerful role in
shaping civilization in a way which can make markets more flexible.
They've got it backwards IMO.  This kind of thought is sort of an
evolution of the frontierism interpretation of history that is bandied
about by Republicans.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; who thinks that you fight a war for the purpose of honoring the soldiers
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; who
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; are fighting in it is brain-addled.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Coalition (mainly the US) goes into Iraq and causes major

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yeah.....well put, though.  You are so right.

&gt; &gt; Yeah, well, I've read that there are still 20% of the people who think Nixon
&gt; &gt; wasn't guilty...  There will always be some delusional people who refuse to
&gt; &gt; see the truth when it's right in front of them.  The truth here is that what
&gt; &gt; we have done by occupying Iraq is the cause of the problems, not the cure,
&gt; &gt; and that the longer we stay, the worse it gets.  I usually suggest to people
&gt; &gt; who think we need to stay to solve the problems in Iraq that they seek out
&gt; &gt; some Iraqi people and just ask them what they think.  As for keeping the war
&gt; &gt; going to honor the troops who have died, that's just insane.  I know lots of
&gt; &gt; Iraq vets and they certainly don't agree with that, either.

&gt; &gt; and nobody is suggesting that we just up and leave without a plan for taking
&gt; &gt; care of the Iraqis.  The plan is for multinational forces to come in as
&gt; &gt; peacekeepers and for us to leave as they arrive.  Do something that makes
&gt; &gt; sense for a change.

&gt; &gt; I am under no illusions that our adminstration will do anything but continue
&gt; &gt; on the course they've begun.  They went in for the oil and they won't want
&gt; &gt; to leave until they get those oil agreements signed.  That's why I think it
&gt; &gt; is important that as many people as possible get out there on the 27th so
&gt; &gt; they, and the world, can see that we do not want that and we will not stand
&gt; &gt; for it to continue.

&gt; Well, our foreign policy in the Middle East has always been predicated
&gt; on oil, no matter the administration.  Oil of course is the blood-line
&gt; of our economy.  Our freedoms would be in great jeopardy if our current
&gt; economy were to suddenly collapse, so rash decisions based on emotion
&gt; are not the order of the day IMO when it comes to Iraq.  Anyway, what's
&gt; particularly scary about this administration is the overly idealistic
&gt; neo-con vision they have of the world.  Oil contracts are easily signed
&gt; without invading countries.  Spreading American styled democracy around
&gt; the world is a pipe dream and we happen to have a sizable group of
&gt; intellectuals who believe in that pipe dream.  What's scary is that
&gt; those intellectuals have sold many politicans to their cause.  Take a
&gt; look at Giuliani for instance.  He's no oil guy.  But he certainly is
&gt; now a neo-con.  The legacy of the neo-con Bush administration will sadly
&gt; be with us for decades to come.  It will make even the fiercest of

Nope.  I think I've been pretty clear in saying I'm for withdrawal of
our troops from Iraq and I find it pretty odd that you interpreted what
I said above in this way.  I was of course referring to our overall
policy in the the Middle East including Iraq, that of engagement.  In
other words, we do have some interests there and we have to make sure
they are protected at some level.  In fact, I believe the Iraq invasion
was not in our best interests economically and that the neo-cons
understood that risk beforehand (witness past Dick Cheney statements).
That fits into my overall thesis that it's ideology (economically driven
at its root) at the core of the neo-con agenda rather than personal
wealth or power.  It's the ideology that scares me, not a group of
government officials profiting off of some oil contract.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No I'm not *in*..This is not the way to honor the sacrifice of our

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you suggesting that we honor them by sacrificing *more* of them?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is way past time to shut this little field trip of Bush's down.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who thinks that you fight a war for the purpose of honoring the soldiers
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are fighting in it is brain-addled.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Coalition (mainly the US) goes into Iraq and causes major
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upheaval. I wasn't for it but we (the President via a Senate
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; authorization) made the decision to take Saddam Hussein out.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, we have an obligation to the people that have stood and are
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; standing with us (Kurds, Shiites and now Sunnis).
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, they seem to be so grateful for our presence there ... tearing their
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; country to bits and killing their civilians with our brown-shirt private
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; armies.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh god.  Why bother?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah.....well put, though.  You are so right.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I've read that there are still 20% of the people who think Nixon
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; wasn't guilty...  There will always be some delusional people who refuse to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; see the truth when it's right in front of them.  The truth here is that what
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; we have done by occupying Iraq is the cause of the problems, not the cure,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and that the longer we stay, the worse it gets.  I usually suggest to people
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; who think we need to stay to solve the problems in Iraq that they seek out
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; some Iraqi people and just ask them what they think.  As for keeping the war
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; going to honor the troops who have died, that's just insane.  I know lots of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq vets and they certainly don't agree with that, either.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and nobody is suggesting that we just up and leave without a plan for taking
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; care of the Iraqis.  The plan is for multinational forces to come in as
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; peacekeepers and for us to leave as they arrive.  Do something that makes
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sense for a change.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I am under no illusions that our adminstration will do anything but continue
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; on the course they've begun.  They went in for the oil and they won't want
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to leave until they get those oil agreements signed.  That's why I think it
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is important that as many people as possible get out there on the 27th so
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; they, and the world, can see that we do not want that and we will not stand
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for it to continue.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, our foreign policy in the Middle East has always been predicated
&gt; &gt;&gt; on oil, no matter the administration.  Oil of course is the blood-line
&gt; &gt;&gt; of our economy.  Our freedoms would be in great jeopardy if our current
&gt; &gt;&gt; economy were to suddenly collapse, so rash decisions based on emotion
&gt; &gt;&gt; are not the order of the day IMO when it comes to Iraq.  Anyway, what's
&gt; &gt;&gt; particularly scary about this administration is the overly idealistic
&gt; &gt;&gt; neo-con vision they have of the world.  Oil contracts are easily signed
&gt; &gt;&gt; without invading countries.  Spreading American styled democracy around
&gt; &gt;&gt; the world is a pipe dream and we happen to have a sizable group of
&gt; &gt;&gt; intellectuals who believe in that pipe dream.  What's scary is that
&gt; &gt;&gt; those intellectuals have sold many politicans to their cause.  Take a
&gt; &gt;&gt; look at Giuliani for instance.  He's no oil guy.  But he certainly is
&gt; &gt;&gt; now a neo-con.  The legacy of the neo-con Bush administration will sadly
&gt; &gt;&gt; be with us for decades to come.  It will make even the fiercest of
&gt; &gt;&gt; liberals long for the days of a more pragmatic Republican foreign policy.

&gt; &gt;&gt; -JC

&gt; &gt; Did I understand this correctly? You think our economy will collapse
&gt; &gt; if US troops are pulled from Iraq?

&gt; Nope.  I think I've been pretty clear in saying I'm for withdrawal of
&gt; our troops from Iraq and I find it pretty odd that you interpreted what
&gt; I said above in this way.  I was of course referring to our overall
&gt; policy in the the Middle East including Iraq, that of engagement.  In
&gt; other words, we do have some interests there and we have to make sure
&gt; they are protected at some level.  In fact, I believe the Iraq invasion
&gt; was not in our best interests economically and that the neo-cons
&gt; understood that risk beforehand (witness past Dick Cheney statements).
&gt; That fits into my overall thesis that it's ideology (economically driven
&gt; at its root) at the core of the neo-con agenda rather than personal
&gt; wealth or power.  It's the ideology that scares me, not a group of
&gt; government officials profiting off of some oil contract.

&gt; Oh. Okay.

Let me add to that, I support a slow but steady withdrawal of troops out
of Iraq.  However, we must have bases in or around Iraq for some time.
We can not allow a civil war to spread outside the borders of Iraq,
particularly into Saudi Arabia.  The consequences to our nation and the
world economy at large could be dire.  Dubya got us into a shitload of
trouble here.  But by simply withdrawing troops does not make the
problem go away.  What's done is done.  IMO, Bush should serve time in
jail for what he's done, but obviously that's not likely.  A lot of
folks out there think that we can undo the damage by merely getting out
of Iraq.  Some even believe if we disengage from the Middle East
entirely, everything will be hunky dory.  But that's not realistic thinking.

&gt; I usually dont get involved in politics on this chat group.
&gt; Iraq is a complete mess.
&gt; It's about power/money at this point, NOT kicking
&gt; in doors in Baghdad neighborhoods...thats the easy part.
&gt; The appearance of fighting the &quot;enemy&quot;
&gt; There IS a goverment in Iraq. The US goverment.
&gt; Al Quieda never really existed in Iraq...it was a convenient
&gt; excuse..the 3 major groups in Iraq dont want them around...
&gt; they get in the way of business...why cut in a 4th group?
&gt; Business.
&gt; Will I march in an anti war rally?
&gt; No.
&gt; I dont fault anyone who does...it makes them feel like they
&gt; are DOING something.
&gt; This situation is out of our hands.
&gt; The troops?
&gt; Pawns in the game.
&gt; They are employees. and dispensible
&gt; it's all part of business.
&gt; There was an article in the times last month.
&gt; Bushs buddy in Tejas, Ray L. Hunt, of Hunt petroleum
&gt; has inked a deal with the Kurdistan regional goverment
&gt; for oil contracts. Hmmm...but I thought there was a united
&gt; Iraqi goverment?....they were supposed to pass oil sharing
&gt; laws, right?...what does Mr. Hunt know that we dont?

Beating a #1 ranked college football team was better in the seventies.
Seriously, parity seems to have finally reared it's head in a sport that has
traditionally been very top heavy. Upsets have become almost commonplace
this season. Congrats though. I watched the ending and was pulling for the
Wildcats for some unknown reason. I imagine Lexington was partying hard last
night.

It was pandemonium. We get fined $50,000 by the authorities for
rushing the field now. C'mon! Lots of big blue love had to go around.
We hadn't beat the top team since like 1964! There's nothing like
being there in the middle of it..It's not whether you win or lose but
still..it was pretty darn cool. Thanks for noticing, Terry. C~

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah.....well put, though.  You are so right.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I've read that there are still 20% of the people who think Nixon
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wasn't guilty...  There will always be some delusional people who refuse to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see the truth when it's right in front of them.  The truth here is that what
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we have done by occupying Iraq is the cause of the problems, not the cure,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and that the longer we stay, the worse it gets.  I usually suggest to people
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who think we need to stay to solve the problems in Iraq that they seek out
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some Iraqi people and just ask them what they think.  As for keeping the war
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going to honor the troops who have died, that's just insane.  I know lots of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq vets and they certainly don't agree with that, either.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and nobody is suggesting that we just up and leave without a plan for taking
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; care of the Iraqis.  The plan is for multinational forces to come in as
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; peacekeepers and for us to leave as they arrive.  Do something that makes
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sense for a change.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am under no illusions that our adminstration will do anything but continue
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the course they've begun.  They went in for the oil and they won't want
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to leave until they get those oil agreements signed.  That's why I think it
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is important that as many people as possible get out there on the 27th so
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they, and the world, can see that we do not want that and we will not stand
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for it to continue.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, our foreign policy in the Middle East has always been predicated
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on oil, no matter the administration.  Oil of course is the blood-line
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of our economy.  Our freedoms would be in great jeopardy if our current
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; economy were to suddenly collapse, so rash decisions based on emotion
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are not the order of the day IMO when it comes to Iraq.  Anyway, what's
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particularly scary about this administration is the overly idealistic
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neo-con vision they have of the world.  Oil contracts are easily signed
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without invading countries.  Spreading American styled democracy around
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the world is a pipe dream and we happen to have a sizable group of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intellectuals who believe in that pipe dream.  What's scary is that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those intellectuals have sold many politicans to their cause.  Take a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; look at Giuliani for instance.  He's no oil guy.  But he certainly is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now a neo-con.  The legacy of the neo-con Bush administration will sadly
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be with us for decades to come.  It will make even the fiercest of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; liberals long for the days of a more pragmatic Republican foreign policy.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -JC
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Did I understand this correctly? You think our economy will collapse
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; if US troops are pulled from Iraq?
&gt; &gt;&gt; Nope.  I think I've been pretty clear in saying I'm for withdrawal of
&gt; &gt;&gt; our troops from Iraq and I find it pretty odd that you interpreted what
&gt; &gt;&gt; I said above in this way.  I was of course referring to our overall
&gt; &gt;&gt; policy in the the Middle East including Iraq, that of engagement.  In
&gt; &gt;&gt; other words, we do have some interests there and we have to make sure
&gt; &gt;&gt; they are protected at some level.  In fact, I believe the Iraq invasion
&gt; &gt;&gt; was not in our best interests economically and that the neo-cons
&gt; &gt;&gt; understood that risk beforehand (witness past Dick Cheney statements).
&gt; &gt;&gt; That fits into my overall thesis that it's ideology (economically driven
&gt; &gt;&gt; at its root) at the core of the neo-con agenda rather than personal
&gt; &gt;&gt; wealth or power.  It's the ideology that scares me, not a group of
&gt; &gt;&gt; government officials profiting off of some oil contract.

&gt; &gt;&gt; -JC

&gt; &gt; Oh. Okay.

&gt; Let me add to that, I support a slow but steady withdrawal of troops out
&gt; of Iraq.  However, we must have bases in or around Iraq for some time.
&gt; We can not allow a civil war to spread outside the borders of Iraq,
&gt; particularly into Saudi Arabia.  The consequences to our nation and the
&gt; world economy at large could be dire.  Dubya got us into a shitload of
&gt; trouble here.  But by simply withdrawing troops does not make the
&gt; problem go away.  What's done is done.  IMO, Bush should serve time in
&gt; jail for what he's done, but obviously that's not likely.  A lot of
&gt; folks out there think that we can undo the damage by merely getting out
&gt; of Iraq.  Some even believe if we disengage from the Middle East
&gt; entirely, everything will be hunky dory.  But that's not realistic thinking.

off and on I worry about the oil business if only for its
ramifications on our economy, but then it dawns on me that if prior
experience is any sort of barometer, we'll negotiate oil deals with
any regime that happens to wind up running Iraq no matter how
repressive, sleazy, disgusting, or tyrannical.  So, I'm at the point
where the oil concern just doesn't hold any water.  Mark my words - if
'Al Qaeda in Iraq' somehow winds up the official governing body over
those billions of barrels of untapped oil reserves, betcha dollars to
donuts we'll have signed a petrol deal with them before the next
Summer of Love anniversary.

&gt; &gt; &gt; No I'm not *in*..This is not the way to honor the sacrifice of our

&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, we have an obligation to the people that have stood and are
&gt; &gt; &gt; standing with us (Kurds, Shiites and now Sunnis). Violence is down. Al
&gt; &gt; &gt; Qaeda rejected. Let's not abandon them.

&gt; &gt; I usually dont get involved in politics on this chat group.
&gt; &gt; Iraq is a complete mess.
&gt; &gt; It's about power/money at this point, NOT kicking
&gt; &gt; in doors in Baghdad neighborhoods...thats the easy part.
&gt; &gt; The appearance of fighting the &quot;enemy&quot;
&gt; &gt; There IS a goverment in Iraq. The US goverment.
&gt; &gt; Al Quieda never really existed in Iraq...it was a convenient
&gt; &gt; excuse..the 3 major groups in Iraq dont want them around...
&gt; &gt; they get in the way of business...why cut in a 4th group?
&gt; &gt; Business.
&gt; &gt; Will I march in an anti war rally?
&gt; &gt; No.
&gt; &gt; I dont fault anyone who does...it makes them feel like they
&gt; &gt; are DOING something.
&gt; &gt; This situation is out of our hands.
&gt; &gt; The troops?
&gt; &gt; Pawns in the game.
&gt; &gt; They are employees. and dispensible
&gt; &gt; it's all part of business.
&gt; &gt; There was an article in the times last month.
&gt; &gt; Bushs buddy in Tejas, Ray L. Hunt, of Hunt petroleum
&gt; &gt; has inked a deal with the Kurdistan regional goverment
&gt; &gt; for oil contracts. Hmmm...but I thought there was a united
&gt; &gt; Iraqi goverment?....they were supposed to pass oil sharing
&gt; &gt; laws, right?...what does Mr. Hunt know that we dont?
&gt; &gt; I'll go back to being &quot;funny&quot;

&gt; &gt; L. Ron Sweetbac

&gt; If Air America had snagged you up they'd be in better shape today.
&gt; Thing that offends me most right now is no one mentions UK's upset of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who think we need to stay to solve the problems in Iraq that they seek out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some Iraqi people and just ask them what they think.  As for keeping the war
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going to honor the troops who have died, that's just insane.  I know lots of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq vets and they certainly don't agree with that, either.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and nobody is suggesting that we just up and leave without a plan for taking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; care of the Iraqis.  The plan is for multinational forces to come in as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; peacekeepers and for us to leave as they arrive.  Do something that makes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sense for a change.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am under no illusions that our adminstration will do anything but continue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the course they've begun.  They went in for the oil and they won't want
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to leave until they get those oil agreements signed.  That's why I think it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is important that as many people as possible get out there on the 27th so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they, and the world, can see that we do not want that and we will not stand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for it to continue.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, our foreign policy in the Middle East has always been predicated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on oil, no matter the administration.  Oil of course is the blood-line
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of our economy.  Our freedoms would be in great jeopardy if our current
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; economy were to suddenly collapse, so rash decisions based on emotion
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are not the order of the day IMO when it comes to Iraq.  Anyway, what's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particularly scary about this administration is the overly idealistic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neo-con vision they have of the world.  Oil contracts are easily signed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without invading countries.  Spreading American styled democracy around
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the world is a pipe dream and we happen to have a sizable group of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intellectuals who believe in that pipe dream.  What's scary is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those intellectuals have sold many politicans to their cause.  Take a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; look at Giuliani for instance.  He's no oil guy.  But he certainly is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now a neo-con.  The legacy of the neo-con Bush administration will sadly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be with us for decades to come.  It will make even the fiercest of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; liberals long for the days of a more pragmatic Republican foreign policy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -JC
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did I understand this correctly? You think our economy will collapse
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if US troops are pulled from Iraq?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope.  I think I've been pretty clear in saying I'm for withdrawal of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our troops from Iraq and I find it pretty odd that you interpreted what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I said above in this way.  I was of course referring to our overall
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; policy in the the Middle East including Iraq, that of engagement.  In
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other words, we do have some interests there and we have to make sure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they are protected at some level.  In fact, I believe the Iraq invasion
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was not in our best interests economically and that the neo-cons
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understood that risk beforehand (witness past Dick Cheney statements).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That fits into my overall thesis that it's ideology (economically driven
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at its root) at the core of the neo-con agenda rather than personal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wealth or power.  It's the ideology that scares me, not a group of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government officials profiting off of some oil contract.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -JC
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Let me add to that, I support a slow but steady withdrawal of troops out
&gt;&gt; of Iraq.  However, we must have bases in or around Iraq for some time.
&gt;&gt; We can not allow a civil war to spread outside the borders of Iraq,
&gt;&gt; particularly into Saudi Arabia.  The consequences to our nation and the
&gt;&gt; world economy at large could be dire.  Dubya got us into a shitload of
&gt;&gt; trouble here.  But by simply withdrawing troops does not make the
&gt;&gt; problem go away.  What's done is done.  IMO, Bush should serve time in
&gt;&gt; jail for what he's done, but obviously that's not likely.  A lot of
&gt;&gt; folks out there think that we can undo the damage by merely getting out
&gt;&gt; of Iraq.  Some even believe if we disengage from the Middle East
&gt;&gt; entirely, everything will be hunky dory.  But that's not realistic thinking.

&gt; off and on I worry about the oil business if only for its
&gt; ramifications on our economy, but then it dawns on me that if prior
&gt; experience is any sort of barometer, we'll negotiate oil deals with
&gt; any regime that happens to wind up running Iraq no matter how
&gt; repressive, sleazy, disgusting, or tyrannical.
">

Totally agree.  In fact, that's probably one of the better solutions for
Iraq right now.  They certainly aren't going to all hold hands and male
nice.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;So, I'm at the point
&gt; where the oil concern just doesn't hold any water.  Mark my words - if
&gt; 'Al Qaeda in Iraq' somehow winds up the official governing body over
&gt; those billions of barrels of untapped oil reserves, betcha dollars to
&gt; donuts we'll have signed a petrol deal with them before the next
&gt; Summer of Love anniversary.
">

Al Qaeda is not the worry though.  I'm worried about a full on civil war
war in the Middle East involving Persians and Arabs (both Sunni and
Shia) and the Turks.  This would seriously impact the flow of oil into
America and other countries.  The impact on the world economy could be
pretty dire in such a case.  Economies are a lot more fragile than we
are led to believe.  BTW, Turkey is all ready at this moment to invade
Northern Iraq and make no mistake, Saudi Arabia is very afraid of the
Shia alliance that's forming to the East.  To disengage entirely from
the Middle East, including Iraqi affairs is near insanity at this point.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the course they've begun.  They went in for the oil and they won't want
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to leave until they get those oil agreements signed.  That's why I think it
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is important that as many people as possible get out there on the 27th so
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they, and the world, can see that we do not want that and we will not stand
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for it to continue.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, our foreign policy in the Middle East has always been predicated
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on oil, no matter the administration.  Oil of course is the blood-line
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of our economy.  Our freedoms would be in great jeopardy if our current
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; economy were to suddenly collapse, so rash decisions based on emotion
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are not the order of the day IMO when it comes to Iraq.  Anyway, what's
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particularly scary about this administration is the overly idealistic
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neo-con vision they have of the world.  Oil contracts are easily signed
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without invading countries.  Spreading American styled democracy around
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the world is a pipe dream and we happen to have a sizable group of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intellectuals who believe in that pipe dream.  What's scary is that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those intellectuals have sold many politicans to their cause.  Take a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; look at Giuliani for instance.  He's no oil guy.  But he certainly is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now a neo-con.  The legacy of the neo-con Bush administration will sadly
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be with us for decades to come.  It will make even the fiercest of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; liberals long for the days of a more pragmatic Republican foreign policy.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -JC
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did I understand this correctly? You think our economy will collapse
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if US troops are pulled from Iraq?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope.  I think I've been pretty clear in saying I'm for withdrawal of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our troops from Iraq and I find it pretty odd that you interpreted what
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I said above in this way.  I was of course referring to our overall
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; policy in the the Middle East including Iraq, that of engagement.  In
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other words, we do have some interests there and we have to make sure
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they are protected at some level.  In fact, I believe the Iraq invasion
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was not in our best interests economically and that the neo-cons
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understood that risk beforehand (witness past Dick Cheney statements).
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That fits into my overall thesis that it's ideology (economically driven
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at its root) at the core of the neo-con agenda rather than personal
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wealth or power.  It's the ideology that scares me, not a group of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government officials profiting off of some oil contract.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -JC
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Oh. Okay.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Let me add to that, I support a slow but steady withdrawal of troops out
&gt; &gt;&gt; of Iraq.  However, we must have bases in or around Iraq for some time.
&gt; &gt;&gt; We can not allow a civil war to spread outside the borders of Iraq,
&gt; &gt;&gt; particularly into Saudi Arabia.  The consequences to our nation and the
&gt; &gt;&gt; world economy at large could be dire.  Dubya got us into a shitload of
&gt; &gt;&gt; trouble here.  But by simply withdrawing troops does not make the
&gt; &gt;&gt; problem go away.  What's done is done.  IMO, Bush should serve time in
&gt; &gt;&gt; jail for what he's done, but obviously that's not likely.  A lot of
&gt; &gt;&gt; folks out there think that we can undo the damage by merely getting out
&gt; &gt;&gt; of Iraq.  Some even believe if we disengage from the Middle East
&gt; &gt;&gt; entirely, everything will be hunky dory.  But that's not realistic thinking.

&gt; &gt;&gt; -JC

&gt; &gt; Well, at least it stops the innocent troops from being murdered.

&gt; It's a voluntary military.  All of the men in my family volunteered for
&gt; service duty and none of them want anyone's pity, I can assure you that.

&gt; FYI, they are all liberal Democrats.

&gt; &gt; Fuck him, let him put his buddies in the streets of Iraq and mountains
&gt; &gt; of Aghanistan.

&gt; If only.

&gt; &gt; Fuck the fucking profits!

&gt; All the money you and I earn is based on profit.  I would suck to have
&gt; it taken away in one fell swoop, don't you think?

&gt; &gt;There are alternative answers to trying to
&gt; &gt; work out the oil thing.

&gt; We need to have those alternatives worked out beforehand.  It's not
&gt; realistic to disengage from the Middle East entirely and all the
&gt; protesting in the world won't change that fact.

&gt; -JC
">

Don't you think in all of this time, as each day gos on, someone does
not have it all worked out?
Bush won't do it.  This admin will never do it.  Its been years,
they've not only NOT implimented an
oil agreement when they so easily could have, when they certainly
could have, **sometime you have to wake up**---
there are soldiers for, soldiers against, and soldiers who don't give
a shit, or at least not anymore.
They shall not continue to DIE for -----greed.   I do not believe life
as we happily know it will collapse by
troop withdrawal........... all we need is for someone to take charge
with a brain, heart and balls.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; troops.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you suggesting that we honor them by sacrificing *more* of them?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is way past time to shut this little field trip of Bush's down.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who thinks that you fight a war for the purpose of honoring the soldiers
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are fighting in it is brain-addled.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Coalition (mainly the US) goes into Iraq and causes major
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upheaval. I wasn't for it but we (the President via a Senate
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; authorization) made the decision to take Saddam Hussein out.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, we have an obligation to the people that have stood and are
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; standing with us (Kurds, Shiites and now Sunnis).
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, they seem to be so grateful for our presence there ... tearing their
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; country to bits and killing their civilians with our brown-shirt private
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; armies.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Violence is down.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shee-it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Al
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Qaeda rejected.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh god.  Why bother?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah.....well put, though.  You are so right.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I've read that there are still 20% of the people who think Nixon
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wasn't guilty...  There will always be some delusional people who refuse to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see the truth when it's right in front of them.  The truth here is that what
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we have done by occupying Iraq is the cause of the problems, not the cure,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and that the longer we stay, the worse it gets.  I usually suggest to people
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who think we need to stay to solve the problems in Iraq that they seek out
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some Iraqi people and just ask them what they think.  As for keeping the war
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going to honor the troops who have died, that's just insane.  I know lots of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq vets and they certainly don't agree with that, either.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and nobody is suggesting that we just up and leave without a plan for taking
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; care of the Iraqis.  The plan is for multinational forces to come in as
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; peacekeepers and for us to leave as they arrive.  Do something that makes
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sense for a change.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am under no illusions that our adminstration will do anything but continue
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the course they've begun.  They went in for the oil and they won't want

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Coalition (mainly the US) goes into Iraq and causes major
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upheaval. I wasn't for it but we (the President via a Senate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; authorization) made the decision to take Saddam Hussein out.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, we have an obligation to the people that have stood and are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; standing with us (Kurds, Shiites and now Sunnis).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, they seem to be so grateful for our presence there ... tearing their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; country to bits and killing their civilians with our brown-shirt private
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; armies.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Violence is down.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shee-it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Al
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Qaeda rejected.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh god.  Why bother?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah.....well put, though.  You are so right.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I've read that there are still 20% of the people who think Nixon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wasn't guilty...  There will always be some delusional people who refuse to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see the truth when it's right in front of them.  The truth here is that what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we have done by occupying Iraq is the cause of the problems, not the cure,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and that the longer we stay, the worse it gets.  I usually suggest to people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who think we need to stay to solve the problems in Iraq that they seek out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some Iraqi people and just ask them what they think.  As for keeping the war
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going to honor the troops who have died, that's just insane.  I know lots of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq vets and they certainly don't agree with that, either.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and nobody is suggesting that we just up and leave without a plan for taking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; care of the Iraqis.  The plan is for multinational forces to come in as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; peacekeepers and for us to leave as they arrive.  Do something that makes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sense for a change.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am under no illusions that our adminstration will do anything but continue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the course they've begun.  They went in for the oil and they won't want
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to leave until they get those oil agreements signed.  That's why I think it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is important that as many people as possible get out there on the 27th so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they, and the world, can see that we do not want that and we will not stand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for it to continue.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, our foreign policy in the Middle East has always been predicated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on oil, no matter the administration.  Oil of course is the blood-line
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of our economy.  Our freedoms would be in great jeopardy if our current
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; economy were to suddenly collapse, so rash decisions based on emotion
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are not the order of the day IMO when it comes to Iraq.  Anyway, what's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particularly scary about this administration is the overly idealistic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neo-con vision they have of the world.  Oil contracts are easily signed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without invading countries.  Spreading American styled democracy around
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the world is a pipe dream and we happen to have a sizable group of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intellectuals who believe in that pipe dream.  What's scary is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those intellectuals have sold many politicans to their cause.  Take a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; look at Giuliani for instance.  He's no oil guy.  But he certainly is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now a neo-con.  The legacy of the neo-con Bush administration will sadly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be with us for decades to come.  It will make even the fiercest of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; liberals long for the days of a more pragmatic Republican foreign policy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -JC
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did I understand this correctly? You think our economy will collapse
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if US troops are pulled from Iraq?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope.  I think I've been pretty clear in saying I'm for withdrawal of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our troops from Iraq and I find it pretty odd that you interpreted what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I said above in this way.  I was of course referring to our overall
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; policy in the the Middle East including Iraq, that of engagement.  In
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other words, we do have some interests there and we have to make sure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they are protected at some level.  In fact, I believe the Iraq invasion
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was not in our best interests economically and that the neo-cons
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understood that risk beforehand (witness past Dick Cheney statements).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That fits into my overall thesis that it's ideology (economically driven
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at its root) at the core of the neo-con agenda rather than personal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wealth or power.  It's the ideology that scares me, not a group of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government officials profiting off of some oil contract.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -JC
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh. Okay.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me add to that, I support a slow but steady withdrawal of troops out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Iraq.  However, we must have bases in or around Iraq for some time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We can not allow a civil war to spread outside the borders of Iraq,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particularly into Saudi Arabia.  The consequences to our nation and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; world economy at large could be dire.  Dubya got us into a shitload of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trouble here.  But by simply withdrawing troops does not make the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem go away.  What's done is done.  IMO, Bush should serve time in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jail for what he's done, but obviously that's not likely.  A lot of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; folks out there think that we can undo the damage by merely getting out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Iraq.  Some even believe if we disengage from the Middle East
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entirely, everything will be hunky dory.  But that's not realistic thinking.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -JC
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, at least it stops the innocent troops from being murdered.
&gt;&gt; It's a voluntary military.  All of the men in my family volunteered for
&gt;&gt; service duty and none of them want anyone's pity, I can assure you that.

&gt;&gt; FYI, they are all liberal Democrats.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fuck him, let him put his buddies in the streets of Iraq and mountains
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Aghanistan.
&gt;&gt; If only.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fuck the fucking profits!
&gt;&gt; All the money you and I earn is based on profit.  I would suck to have
&gt;&gt; it taken away in one fell swoop, don't you think?

&gt;&gt;&gt; There are alternative answers to trying to
&gt;&gt;&gt; work out the oil thing.
&gt;&gt; We need to have those alternatives worked out beforehand.  It's not
&gt;&gt; realistic to disengage from the Middle East entirely and all the
&gt;&gt; protesting in the world won't change that fact.

&gt;&gt; -JC

&gt; Don't you think in all of this time, as each day gos on, someone does
&gt; not have it all worked out?
&gt; Bush won't do it.  This admin will never do it.  Its been years,
&gt; they've not only NOT implimented an
&gt; oil agreement when they so easily could have, when they certainly
&gt; could have, **sometime you have to wake up**---
&gt; there are soldiers for, soldiers against, and soldiers who don't give
&gt; a shit, or at least not anymore.
&gt; They shall not continue to DIE for -----greed.   I do not believe life
&gt; as we happily know it will collapse by
&gt; troop withdrawal........... all we need is for someone to take charge
&gt; with a brain, heart and balls.
">

Well, I agree with the last statement.  I'm all for troop withdrawal
from Iraq.  But I'm not for complete disengagement from the Middle East.
In other words, we do have to maintain some bases there in the short
term and likely for the long haul.

I totally agree that it's a lot of bullshit and really scary.  To be
honest, I find that to be the case about most people in power whether
they be on the right or left, but I try to suppress that thought as much
as I can.  Power is an ugly thing.

BTW, I do have a solution.  Step 1 is to elect a Democratic president.
I reject the idea that both parties are the same and that either
president would conduct foreign policy exactly the same way.  Some of us
may not like the status quo, but it's a hell of a lot saner than the
path neocons have carved out.  Step 2 is a steady but slow withdrawal of
troops from Iraq.  It's not feasible or even logistically possible to
remove them all at once and right away.  Thirdly, we have to maintain
some type of military engagement so that the transition can take place
without a massive civil war breaking out beyond Iraq's borders.  And
lastly, the bulk of the effort will have to be diplomatic.

Not that I think this is a fix-all solution.  There's all kinds of
likely mistakes that will happen along the way.  Plus, I'm afraid that
Pakistan is likely to rid itself of military rule within 4-8 years which
will mean a collapse in cooperation with the the U.S. in regards to
Qaeda.  There's so much that can and will go wrong here.  The bummer
here is that we should have never invaded Iraq and there really is no
fix to the problem.  Not only have the so-called Islamofascists
benefited from our invasion of Iraq, the conservative Shia are
consolidating power in the Middle East and that will likely have
horrifying ramifications for the region in general, particularly in
terms of loss of life due to various struggles over resources.  It's
pretty sad stuff.  But we have to try to maintain some degree of control
over it IMO and the hope is that some of these politicians in the
Democratic party will more wisely wield their power.  Personally, I
think any one of these Democratic presidential candidates is better than
what we have now.  And trust me, I wasn't one of those people voting for
all things Democrat before 9/11.

Yo Hateful Joe!

No one is forcing you to read anything. You are a clueless intolerant
fartknocker who is thought to be crazy even by folks who agree with
you politically. So dude meet a new chick, drink some beer, take up
yoga or something! Whatever you are doing or smoking now is not

&gt; Iraqis' Own Surge Assessment: Few See Security Gains

&gt; ABC News/BBC/NHK National Survey of Iraq Finds Worsening Public
&gt; Attitudes
&gt; Sept. 10, 2007

&gt; More Iraqis say security in their local area has gotten worse in the
&gt; last six months than say it's gotten better, 31 percent to 24 percent,
&gt; with the rest reporting no change. Far more, six in 10, say security
&gt; in the country overall has worsened since the surge began, while just
&gt; one in 10 sees improvement.

&gt; More directly assessing the surge itself -- a measure that necessarily
&gt; includes views of the United States, which are highly negative -- 65
&gt; to 70 percent of Iraqis say it's worsened rather than improved
&gt; security, political stability and the pace of redevelopment alike...

&gt; More than six in 10 now call the U.S.-led invasion of their country
&gt; wrong, up from 52 percent last winter. Fifty-seven percent call
&gt; violence against U.S. forces acceptable, up six points. And despite
&gt; the uncertainties of what might follow, 47 percent now favor the
&gt; immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq -- a 12-point rise.

&gt; Experts Doubt Drop In Violence in Iraq

&gt; By Karen DeYoung
&gt; Washington Post Staff Writer
&gt; Thursday, September 6, 2007; Page A16

&gt; The U.S. military's claim that violence has decreased sharply in Iraq
&gt; in recent months has come under scrutiny from many experts within and
&gt; outside the government, who contend that some of the underlying
&gt; statistics are questionable and selectively ignore negative trends.

&gt; Reductions in violence form the centerpiece of the Bush
&gt; administration's claim that its war strategy is working...

&gt; Others who have looked at the full range of U.S. government statistics
&gt; on violence, however, accuse the military of cherry-picking positive
&gt; indicators and caution that the numbers -- most of which are
&gt; classified -- are often confusing and contradictory. &quot;Let's just say
&gt; that there are several different sources within the administration on
&gt; violence, and those sources do not agree,&quot; Comptroller General David
&gt; Walker told Congress on Tuesday in releasing a new Government
&gt; Accountability Office report on Iraq...

&gt; &quot;Depending on which numbers you pick,&quot; he said, &quot;you get a different
&gt; outcome.&quot; Analysts found &quot;trend lines . . . going in different
&gt; directions&quot; compared with previous years, when numbers in different
&gt; categories varied widely but trended in the same direction. &quot;It began
&gt; to look like spaghetti.&quot;

&gt; Among the most worrisome trends cited by the NIE was escalating
&gt; warfare between rival Shiite militias in southern Iraq that has
&gt; consumed the port city of Basra and resulted last month in the
&gt; assassination of two southern provincial governors. According to a
&gt; spokesman for the Baghdad headquarters of the Multi-National Force-
&gt; Iraq (MNF-I), those attacks are not included in the military's
&gt; statistics. &quot;Given a lack of capability to accurately track Shiite-on-
&gt; Shiite and Sunni-on-Sunni violence, except in certain instances,&quot; the
&gt; spokesman said, &quot;we do not track this data to any significant degree.&quot;

&gt; Attacks by U.S.-allied Sunni tribesmen -- recruited to battle Iraqis
&gt; allied with al-Qaeda -- are also excluded from the U.S. military's
&gt; calculation of violence levels.

&gt; &gt; No I'm not *in*..This is not the way to honor the sacrifice of our
&gt; &gt; troops. The Coalition (mainly the US) goes into Iraq and causes major
&gt; &gt; upheaval. I wasn't for it but we (the President via a Senate
&gt; &gt; authorization) made the decision to take Saddam Hussein out.
&gt; &gt; Therefore, we have an obligation to the people that have stood and are
&gt; &gt; standing with us (Kurds, Shiites and now Sunnis). Violence is down. Al
&gt; &gt; Qaeda rejected. Let's not abandon them. Interesting that the same
&gt; &gt; people who are going wild to GET US OUT OF IRAQ NOW are the ones that
&gt; &gt; want us to make the Sudan or Burma a better place. Thank god Hillary
&gt; &gt; Clinton and Nancy Pelosi are stable people.

&gt; I strongly disagree with you, but what I'm protesting as well
&gt; is the administration's attempts to take away your freedom to express
&gt; your opinion,
&gt; as well as destruction of your world, not just the middle east
&gt; countries we've deplorably destroyed.- Hide quoted text -

I didn't realize that the administration was attempting to take away
the freedom to express my opinion..missed that one. Have we destroyed
other middle east countries as well? It's worse than I imagined!
