http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/10/help_with_annoyances.html

Ian Urbina from the New York Times recently wrote a story about coping
with life's annoyances. He is looking to collect more stories along
the same lines, and would appreciate your help.

Life is full of little annoyances. We would like to hear what tactics
people use to deal with some of them. We prefer tactics that people
have actually used, and preferably ones that are neither illegal nor
hurtful. Some examples of areas of interest are listed below. But if
others come to mind, do tell.

1) ATM fees and any one of a million other reasons to want to lash out
at your bank or the banking industry generally. There are plenty sane
ways to deal with this frustration but what about the guy who makes a
habit of throwing away the entire stack of deposit slips every time he
enters a bank to get back at the systems annoying ATM fees? We want to
hear from him.

2) Why must phone bills be so indecipherable - and ripe with mystery
charges and obfuscating language. Since the letters they send are in
gibberish, why not write them back in their native tongue? Anyone done
this or something equally irrational but cathartic?

3) Stylized ringtones are all the rage. I wonder if anyone has
invented an anti-ringtone ringtone. Or perhaps they've found some
other way to lash out at this one.

4) Sure, you have the simple option of just clicking &quot;never&quot; and the
function is turned off. Still, the automatic email verification
mechanism (telling someone that you've read their email) is tedious. I
wonder if anyone has done something more clever to deal with this
scourge of modern communication.

5) Emails sent to the wrong person. It happens so easily and can be
extremely embarrassing. Has anyone gone to extreme lengths to try to
avoid the fallout after making this mistake? I've heard of a guy who
mistakenly emailed out the payroll list to all the employees and when
he realized his error, he pulled the building's fire alarm to buy
himself time to track down the tech guy who could reverse the email.
Anyone done anything similar?

6) Those misleadingly officious envelopes that say &quot;Enforcement
Division&quot; and &quot;Urgent,&quot; inteding to give the impression that you are
getting audited or that you are in trouble with some government
agency. You open them up nervously, and realize that it is yet another
credit card solicitations home mortgage loan offer. Has anyone ever
struck back at these folks?

7) People who use their carhorn as though it were a doorbell. Perhaps
they pick up their fellow carpooler everyday in the early morning and
don't care if they wake up the neighbors by tooting the horn rather
than getting out and knocking on the door. Anyone ramped up a campaign
or sustained tactic for one of these people?

8) Hitting them with your car is not an answer. More interesting would
be any sustained and creative tactics/experiences for dealing with
distracted drivers who have their cell phone stuck to their ear.
9) Has anyone employed a better tactic for getting back at the high
prices for concessions at movie theaters. Sure you can sneak in your
own box of Milk Duds but isn't there something more elaborate that can
be done to get back at the theaters?

10) People who don't pick up after their dogs.

Please no more anti-spam, anti-telemarketer or anti-junk mail tactics.
We're overflowing with them.

If you have any experiences or ideas about any of these items or any
other stories about revenge in the face of mundane annoyances, email

There is a slim chance that if enough of them come back not filled out,
they won't bother with these misleading statements anymore.

"/> Some techniques make you feel good but you know they won't have any
effect, others just might stand a chance of having an effect.
I suscribed last year to Pop Mechanics (Hearst Corporation) and when
it came time for renewal, the renewal notices were designed like
dunning notices, threatening stuff like &quot;your account has been
referred to me for collection&quot; and falsely stating that by signing up
for a subscription I had signed up for automatic renewal.

Being a stickler, and wanting to insure that I made my point, I sent
my steaming letter to _everyone_ up the chain of command, with cc's
visible on the bottom. In most corporations, if an employee gets an
angry but well written letter that cc's his boss or THE boss,
uncontrollable bowel rumblings and expulsions start. The guy who
supposedly sent the obnoxious renewal notice got the same letter as
his boss, as the magazine editor, as the magazine division head, as
the corporate head of Hearst. Did it have any effect? Other than my
getting my subscription money back, I don't know. There is however, a
slim possibility that some marketing genius got his ass chewed out for
putting the company in a situation where it could be subject to a
class action lawsuit.

If you are just looking for fun methods of revenge, there are websites
with hilarious methods. However, just like responding to Rod Speed,
most are a waste of your time, and have little effect on the person or
company.

In most of these situations it is best to ask yourself what you want
as the result of your actions, and then tailor your actions to that
end.

[misc.consumers.frugal-living removed from distribution]

Speaking of magazine subscriptions, several months ago I received
offers of bargain-rate renewal for a couple of existing magazine
subscriptions (Car And Driver, and Road &amp; Track). I took advantage
of them, but somehow both renewals got processed as new subscriptions.
Now I get *two* copies of each magazine every month.

I went to each magazine's Web site and tried to get this straight-
ened out using the phone numbers provided for subscription issues,
but to no avail. Then I tried using the email addresses provided,
figuring that maybe having a written record might prevent the
matters' falling through the cracks. Again, no effect.

So I obtained the snail-mail addresses for each magazine's circulation
department and sent them letters, each with mailing labels from both
subscriptions attached. Strike three; there was no response.

I'm on the verge of cancelling all four subscriptions out of frus-
tration. But before I do, has anyone else been in this situation
and found a less-drastic solution?

wrapping a brick in wrapping paper, sticky taping the companies post paid

"/> Ever seen the cartoon where the main character is always going to take

because it provides *linear* thought, I seldom do. Smurfs were nice
because they were kind and goodly. Ever since Smurfs went off the air,
usenet has gone to hell in a hand basket. That's my theory anyway, not
enough smurfiness and too much testiness.

FWIW, my motives for spending time in this ng is purely entertainment.

I ignore most spam but every so often I write down their info. When
I get another spam I give each spammer the phone number of other spammer.
Even better for those who really bother you:
Fill out the form but give them the number of sleazy sports tout,
Stu Feiner, 800-676-7716. For those not familiar with touts they claim
to hit at 70 or 80 percent in sports betting. Of course they can never
explain why they need to sell their picks rather than live off of them.
Once these scum get your name they never let go. They will call over
and over and sell your name to other companies.
When you give their names to someone they will call the office. Stu
is always busy so the secretary asks them to leave their name and
number. Nothing better than having dirtbags calling each other.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/10/help_with_annoyances.html

&gt; Ian Urbina from the New York Times recently wrote a story about coping
&gt; with life's annoyances. He is looking to collect more stories along
&gt; the same lines, and would appreciate your help.

&gt; Life is full of little annoyances. We would like to hear what tactics
&gt; people use to deal with some of them. We prefer tactics that people
&gt; have actually used, and preferably ones that are neither illegal nor
&gt; hurtful. Some examples of areas of interest are listed below. But if
&gt; others come to mind, do tell.

&gt; 1) ATM fees and any one of a million other reasons to want to lash out
&gt; at your bank or the banking industry generally. There are plenty sane
&gt; ways to deal with this frustration but what about the guy who makes a
&gt; habit of throwing away the entire stack of deposit slips every time he
&gt; enters a bank to get back at the systems annoying ATM fees? We want to
&gt; hear from him.

"/> I switched banks to one that offered free banking.

My bank gives me free transactions at their ATMs. I rarely use cash, but if
I need it I get it free of charge out of their bank machines, or free cash
back from a merchant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2) Why must phone bills be so indecipherable - and ripe with mystery
&gt; charges and obfuscating language. Since the letters they send are in
&gt; gibberish, why not write them back in their native tongue? Anyone done
&gt; this or something equally irrational but cathartic?

"/> It's especially funny when you have an old plan that they don't carry
anymore. The billing gets more cryptic as they try to cover your old service
and pricing using new terms.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3) Stylized ringtones are all the rage. I wonder if anyone has
&gt; invented an anti-ringtone ringtone. Or perhaps they've found some
&gt; other way to lash out at this one.

"/> I call it the &quot;ring&quot; ringtone. It's one of those ones that comes with the
phone that just sounds like a ringing phone. I know it's my phone because
it's the only one that sounds normal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4) Sure, you have the simple option of just clicking &quot;never&quot; and the
&gt; function is turned off. Still, the automatic email verification
&gt; mechanism (telling someone that you've read their email) is tedious. I
&gt; wonder if anyone has done something more clever to deal with this
&gt; scourge of modern communication.

"/> If you have the simple option of clicking &quot;never&quot;, then click &quot;never&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 5) Emails sent to the wrong person. It happens so easily and can be
&gt; extremely embarrassing. Has anyone gone to extreme lengths to try to
&gt; avoid the fallout after making this mistake? I've heard of a guy who
&gt; mistakenly emailed out the payroll list to all the employees and when
&gt; he realized his error, he pulled the building's fire alarm to buy
&gt; himself time to track down the tech guy who could reverse the email.
&gt; Anyone done anything similar?

"/> Some internal email systems actually have an option of letting you cancel
the email after you sent it, without having to contact IT.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 6) Those misleadingly officious envelopes that say &quot;Enforcement
&gt; Division&quot; and &quot;Urgent,&quot; inteding to give the impression that you are
&gt; getting audited or that you are in trouble with some government
&gt; agency. You open them up nervously, and realize that it is yet another
&gt; credit card solicitations home mortgage loan offer. Has anyone ever
&gt; struck back at these folks?

"/> Mail back junk mail in postage paid envelopes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 7) People who use their carhorn as though it were a doorbell. Perhaps
&gt; they pick up their fellow carpooler everyday in the early morning and
&gt; don't care if they wake up the neighbors by tooting the horn rather
&gt; than getting out and knocking on the door. Anyone ramped up a campaign
&gt; or sustained tactic for one of these people?

"/> After they honk hit the panic button on my car's keychain?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 8) Hitting them with your car is not an answer. More interesting would
&gt; be any sustained and creative tactics/experiences for dealing with
&gt; distracted drivers who have their cell phone stuck to their ear.

"/> Get a cellphone killing device that interferes with the signal and
disconnects the call.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 9) Has anyone employed a better tactic for getting back at the high
&gt; prices for concessions at movie theaters. Sure you can sneak in your
&gt; own box of Milk Duds but isn't there something more elaborate that can
&gt; be done to get back at the theaters?

"/> Rent or borrow from library? You also don't pay exorbitant ticket prices. It
gets cheaper per seat the more people watch your rented / borrowed copy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 10) People who don't pick up after their dogs.

"/> If you know who it is, pick it up and leave it on their doorstep.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;While I suspect you are right about this, there is some satisfaction in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wrapping a brick in wrapping paper, sticky taping the companies post paid
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;envelope onto it, and dropping it off at the post office - with a grin in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;your heart.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You are easily amused, but not at the expense of the mailer - those
&gt;&gt;&gt;bricks are discarded at the post office - so the only people you arte
&gt;&gt;&gt;inconveniencing are the ones you should be cultivating.

&gt;&gt;Yep. However, anything you can fit inside the postage paid
&gt;&gt;envelope will be delivered. A little while ago I read about
&gt;&gt;a guy who has sheet metal cut so it will fit inside the
&gt;&gt;envelopes. The heavier, the better, and the company has to
&gt;&gt;pay the shipping. He said he talked it over with the local
&gt;&gt;post office and they said it was perfectly legal.

&gt; How much does the metal cost?

&gt; How much does it cost to cut it up into envelope-sized pieces?

&gt; Simpler, quicker, and cheaper to either mail the envelope back empty
&gt; or stuff the rest of the junk mail inside and mail it back. Just be
&gt; sure that neither your name nor any barcodes appear on the envelope -
&gt; some of the junk mail I get has stern warning language printed on the
&gt; business reply envelope along with a barcode which undoubtedly tells
&gt; them to whom they sent that envelope.

"/> Sure. But that's also lots cheaper for the idiots who are sending
you the stuff in the first place. So cheap, in fact, that they
have no incentive whatsoever to change their ways. According to
the guy who was sending the sheet metal, he left his address
and name in there with it and he soon stopped getting mail
from the companies he did this to. That's worth a bit of
money and effort if true, and even if not I'd say annoying
those assholes is worth some time and effort. Everyone
needs a hobby, after all.

&gt; [misc.consumers.frugal-living removed from distribution]

&gt; Speaking of magazine subscriptions, several months ago I received
&gt; offers of bargain-rate renewal for a couple of existing magazine
&gt; subscriptions (Car And Driver, and Road &amp; Track). I took advantage
&gt; of them, but somehow both renewals got processed as new
subscriptions.
&gt; Now I get *two* copies of each magazine every month.

&gt; I went to each magazine's Web site and tried to get this straight-
&gt; ened out using the phone numbers provided for subscription issues,
&gt; but to no avail. Then I tried using the email addresses provided,
&gt; figuring that maybe having a written record might prevent the
&gt; matters' falling through the cracks. Again, no effect.

&gt; So I obtained the snail-mail addresses for each magazine's
circulation
&gt; department and sent them letters, each with mailing labels from both
&gt; subscriptions attached. Strike three; there was no response.

&gt; I'm on the verge of cancelling all four subscriptions out of frus-
&gt; tration. But before I do, has anyone else been in this situation
&gt; and found a less-drastic solution?

"/> Subscription issues usually take at least six weeks to resolve
themselves, assuming the subscription department has at least
acknowledged your difficulty. Depending on the cancellation policy and
how many issues you've received, cancelling might or might not get you
a refund. I've had this problem when relatives helpfully subscribed me
to magazines I was already receiving. Once I've gone through reasonable
channels, I simply allowed whichever one renewed first to lapse, and
continued with the second. This, of course, does not address your
difficulty in having spent money to renew without actually being able
to extend your subscription.

Since the subscription departments of most larger magazines seem to be
only distantly connected to the magazine itself, the next step is to
call/write/email the editorial department, who probably care more about
losing a subscriber than the subscription processing dept.

&gt; Ever seen the cartoon where the main character is always going to take

&gt; because they were kind and goodly. Ever since Smurfs went off the air,
&gt; usenet has gone to hell in a hand basket. That's my theory anyway, not
&gt; enough smurfiness and too much testiness.

"/> My kids found an episode of the Smurfs on this morning (I don't know what
channel, maybe WB?) That, coupled with the recent realization that
Me:Casablanca::My Kids:Star Wars (X is to movie that parent watched in the
theaters at age 9), made me feel very old, for some reason. However, if
having the Smurfs in syndication is at all cause for hope in the general
renaissance of Usenet, it is worth it.

&gt;&gt; 9) Has anyone employed a better tactic for getting back at the high
&gt;&gt; prices for concessions at movie theaters. Sure you can sneak in your
&gt;&gt; own box of Milk Duds but isn't there something more elaborate that can
&gt;&gt; be done to get back at the theaters?

&gt; Actually the real problem is that the big movie studios make the lions
&gt; share of the profits. The only way the theaters can keep the doors open
&gt; is with the concessions.

"/> i can vouch for this. my son worked in a theater for a while and he told
me the tickets prices barely cover the cost of the movie. i just go to a
second run theater and i usually get something from the concession (still
cheaper than paying full ticket price).

"/> Probably true, but these days the whole movie theater operation
represents a relative drop in the bucket in terms of studio profits.
Boxoffice figures are essentially meaningless. The theaters have
become an advertising mechanism for DVDs, videogames, ancillary
merchandising, international marketing, and video-on-demand.
