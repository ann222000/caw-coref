Can a district court of Maryland issue a declaratory judgement or does
it have to be in a Circuit court?

What are the recourses available to get a plaintiff to either file
suit or just settle in a given timeframe.

Thanks in Advance

For a few kinds of special proceedings, (somewhat) Yes.   E.g., in
case of "[a] petition of injunction filed by . . . [a] person who
brings [some kinds of landlord-tenant proceedings] under § 14-120 of
the Real Property Article" pursuant to Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. § 4-401(7).

But for almost all other kinds of lawsuits, No.   See § 4-402(c) of
the Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Article ("[t]he District Court does not have
jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment"); Maryland Code, §
3-403(a) of the Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Article ("[e]xcept for the District
Court, a court of record within its jurisdiction may declare rights,
status, and other legal relations").

This question is self-contradictory.   One usually may accurately be
characterized as a "plaintiff" only s/he has commenced a lawsuit
already.   It anyway is too vague to answer because you do not provide
any facts that answer, Why if she has not already done so should that
person file suit or settle in a given timeframe?   Also, if you had
factually reported the relevant specifics of the relationship between
the persons to whom you refer and the nature of the lawsuit and relief
desired by whichever of these persons concerns you, it may be that you
would learn that your first question above also is misleading if you
are presuming by that question that only the grant of an "injunction"
would provide whatever is the relief desired whereas, if one knew what
you were actually asking about in particular re. whatever is the Md.
district court lawsuit in question, there may be other ways that are
indisputably within that court's authority to grant to provide what
may be exactly (or at least tantamount to) whatever that person wants
to accomplish.

I assume you mean State district court, not Federal district court.

The MD State District Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, whose
powers are defined by statute.  I'm not aware of any statute that
permits the District Court to hear declaratory judgment actions.   But
check the laws for yourself, including the Declaratory Judgment Act
and the Maryland Rules relating to declaratory judgments, before
deciding.  I am not going to look them up for you.  I am not your
lawyer and this is not to be construed as legal advice.   Do not take
this to the bank or rely upon it if you've got a real matter pending
with something you value at stake.  If so, get yourself a lawyer and
follow his advice.

Um, it's called the Statute of Limitations.   If a plaintiff doesn't
sue before the applicable statute runs, he's SOL.

For matters that don't have an SOL, the equitable principle of
"laches" may apply.   Colloquially, that is the "You Snooze, You
Looze" rule.   A claim may be barred by the passage of time even if
still technically prosecutable, if the court deems it inequitable to
allow it to proceed, due to fading memory or death of witnesses,
change of circumstances, etc.    Laches generally applies only to
equitable claims, such as for an injunction, an accounting of a trust,
a change in family status, etc. which deal with ongoing matters and
thus are not subject to SOLs.   But if you learn of the existence of
facts that would entitle you to do something about the situation you
complain of in your suit, yet waited an unreasonably long time before
doing anything about it so that the other party would be prejudiced,
the court may uphold this defense.

Other than that, there's not much you the potential defendant can do
to force the plaintiff to sue you.

If you also have an affirmative claim vs. that person, AND if their
potential claim against you is something the law  would consider a
mandatory counterclaim, in some states, you can file your suit against
the other person, and then if the other person wants to have any
chance to raise their own claim, they will be forced to do so as a
counterclaim in the action you brought.   But MD does not generally
recognize the principle of compulsory counterclaims.   The other
person in MD can still bring their claim against you, as  a separate
suit, in the same or a different court, at any time before limitations
run.
