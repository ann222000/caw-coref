Boracay: white sand and clear blue waters

*Boracay... beyond the hype*

I just got back from a three-week vacation in the Philippines. One of the
first things I did was visit Boracay. I had heard of the island so much,
especially from friends and relatives, there was no way my wife and I would
forgo the side trip this time around. It was the best decision we made for
that trip.

My 8-year-old son, Paul, now thinks of the Philippines as his second home.
Prior to the trip, he thought the country was a cluster of nipa huts on an
island somewhere. My 18-year-old daughter and her cousin got to hang around
with a group of European divers and thoroughly enjoyed the Boracay sidetrip.

We here in northeastern U.S. have been spoiled by the caribbean, Florida,
Mexico and, for the truly lucky ones, Hawaii. The Europeans, the Japanese,
Koreans, Taiwanese and Chinese don't have a caribbean, or even a Florida, so
they are all flocking to the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.
The Philippines is being overrun by Koreans right now, which is great for
the country.

Boracay is a favorite international destination. My first day on the island,
however, was a bit disappointing. I was face-to-face with reality now, no
more hype. The first time I waded into Boracay bay, I smelled the strong
fish odor in the water. I have been to Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, the Bahamas,
etc. and there never was the smell of fish in the deep green waters that
splashed on the powdery white sand. So I was taken aback when I noticed the
odor.

The water was light lime green, not the healthy aquamarine that one finds in
the caribbean, or even on Marco island and Sarasota, Florida.

The next day, the fish odor was noticeably gone. And the water was as calm
as a wading pool. I was about a hundred feet from the shore, and the water
was still only up to my waist. When I looked back at the shore, I could see
the water dip into the sand. The water was so still I could see the
curvature of the earth, with the surface rising and falling gradually into
the sand. I turned around and saw that behind me, the open sea also followed
the curvature of the earth - the horizon rose and dipped. I had never
experienced this phenomenon before.

The long line of resorts in station three - my wife had booked us in 3-5-7
Boracay, a resort owned by her high school classmate - were a subdued
celebration of lights and music that seemingly came from coconut trees. It
was past the summer rush, so we only had to share the beaches with tourists
from temperate countries. There was no crush of Manila crowds in holiday
mood.

I looked up Boracay in wikipedia, thinking I could read up on the island's
history. To my surprise, there is not much history written about the island.
I asked the locals, which is the best way to learn something about the
island.

Prior to the 1970s, Boracay was just an island off Aklan populated by Aetas,
or Itas. Aetas owned the choice beachfront properties. Some mainland (Aklan)
families saw the potential in the island and started befriending the Aetas.
They gave the aetas rice, sardines, canned goods, soft drinks, etc. and
introduced the natives to modern civilization. Instead of foraging for
tubers, like gabe, kamote, kamoteng kahoy, etc. the Aetas were now eating
fried rice, eggs and spam. A few of the Christian families decided to give
the Aetas a steady supply of food and clothing in exchange for Aeta land.
That was how the transfer of choice beachfront Boracay land came to pass.

The few Christian families who owned beachfront land in Boracay turned their
land into resorts that caught the eye of some Europeans. German, French and
Scandinavian tourists frolicked on the pristine and serene beaches in their
bikinis, while Israeli women tanned in the nude. A lot of the local kids
espied on the Israeli women and sprayed the local vegetation with their
seed.

Ever on the lookout for playgrounds in the Philippines and other southeast
Asian island chains, the Japanese took interest in Boracay. A Japanese
electric company was hired by the local government - the Boracay barangay in
the town of Malay, province of Aklan - to supply electricity to the island.
In 1995, the project was completed, consisting of laying cables on the
seabed between Calictan, Aklan and the island of Boracay. Inside the cables
pass through the electricity that powers the whole Boracay island.

With electricty, tourism boomed. There was a rush to build more and more
resorts. Even now, a huge 5-star resort complex is being completed by
Shangri-La on the opposite end of the island, away from stations two and
three, where the young tourists and European divers commune.

Boracay has one of the safest beaches to take a midnight stroll. If you are
observant, though, you will notice that people sleep under coconut trees.
You can hear people's conversations as you take your leisurely walk at two
in the morning.

Those are the Aetas who have been displaced by the businesses along the
beach. There are lots of Aeta kids who will sell you magnets for a hundred
pesos. There are tall and lean Aeta men who walk on the beaches looking for
items being discarded by tourishts. There are not too many of them, but they
are noticeable because they have very dark skin and curly hair. They are not
tanned, they are dark.

Sometimes, the Aeta men get drunk and point to some of the resorts. &quot;You see
that land?&quot; they ask. &quot;I own that land.&quot; Which may be true. The beachfront
properties on Boracay were never officially transferred to the resort
owners. There is no land title system on Boracay. Instead, the government
administers the land, and whoever pays the taxes on the land gets to use it
indefinitely. Resort owners pay property taxes to the government and the
government in turn protects the &quot;owner's&quot; rights to own and operate resorts
that sit on the land.

Meanwhile, the Aetas get to live the rest of their lives under the canopy of
the coconut trees.
