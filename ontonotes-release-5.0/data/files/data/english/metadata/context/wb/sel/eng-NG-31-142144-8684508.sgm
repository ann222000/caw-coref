&gt; &quot;You cover cheats, extremists and criminals,&quot; he said. &quot;You are all
&gt; accomplices, all of you are similar bandits and criminals, your whole
&gt; government, together with your queen,&quot; he said, adding that his party was
&gt; &quot;most loved by ordinary Russians&quot; and would win one-fifth of all seats in
&gt; the next Duma. He blamed Britain for backing the Bolsheviks during the
&gt; 1917 revolution, financing Chechen rebels and opening the second front too
&gt; late during World War II. &quot;Half of your embassy should be thrown out of
&gt; Moscow,&quot; he barked at the reporter representing a U.S. media outlet. &quot;They
&gt; are not diplomats, all of them are spies. ... You in Britain are good for
&gt; nothing, you only plundered Europe.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Britain will disappear under the water one day,&quot; he said. &quot;And it will
&gt; serve you right ... Even your sheep die every day and every hour due to
&gt; your sickening British policies.&quot;

I have to confess that I find Zhirinovsky an amusing diversion. He is so
off the wall that he can only be considered, like the late and
unlamented Walter Ulbricht, a *Witzfigur*. He is intelligent enough that
his humor is indeed witty.

The guy is an anti-Baltic fascist, bully, and rat-ass. Married, he brags
of having bedded more than 200 women. But he is also far more
intelligent than the average politician, Gorge W. Bush included:

&quot;I was the prompter for Vladimir Volfovich [Zhirinovsky]. The monologues
were really long, and although his memory is just great, he is a
politician and he cannot remember everything,&quot; said Artyom Chetsov, an
LDPR party worker. &quot;He was so good, everyone said that if something
doesn't work out for him as a politician, he could always make ends meet
as an actor.&quot;
&lt;deletions&gt;
&lt;/quote&gt;

The pictures have been removed, but at his website there were once
pictures of him dressed as Mozart, in powdered wig and green velvet
suit, seated at the pianoforte. There were other picture of him having a
good time with, let us say, females who rent out their charms.

Zhirinovsky has his own brand of vodka
( http://finance.rol.ru/files_jpg/zhirinovsky_vodka_2(52310).gif ) and
ice-cream fort the small fry. A man with such a sense of humor and self
irony cannoit be all bad, particularly if he steers clear of serious
politics :-)
