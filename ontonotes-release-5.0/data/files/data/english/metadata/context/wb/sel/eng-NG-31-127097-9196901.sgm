Okay, so I have no water for my humidifier, or at least no distilled like is
recommended.  Would you used anything else?  Or is it okay to run my CPAP
with the humidifier just turned off with no water in it for the night till I
get some?

Take some tap water in a pot, put it on the stove and boil the
heck out of it.

When it cools, you'll notice the white film on the side of the
pot. These are mineral deposits and now you have distilled water!

Just use tap water. There is no medical reason for using distilled water. If
you can drink your tap water, you can certainly use it in your humidifier.
The only reason to use distilled water (and some here will try to tell you
differently) is to keep the minerals in your water from scaling up your
tank.  And a little vinegar and some rinsing can get rid of that.

That's a waste of time.  Boiling water doesn't distill it. You just end up
with boiled water not distilled water.

You can use tap water with a permanent chamber that has a stainless
steel baseplate.

I experimented with a throw away chamber that had an aluminum baseplate.
I could see that some sort of corrosion was accumulating in four
places on the baseplate.  In the end, it corroded through the aluminum
and began to leak, in less than three months.

Since this is exactly what I expected, I kept an eye on it and threw it
away before it did any damage to the blower.

Since, TTBOMK, throw away chambers come with an xpap.  Permanent ones
cost a great deal more.  So there is good reason for purveyors of the
product to tell new users to used distilled water.

You don't need to use distilled water in a humidifier.   Tap water is
perfectly OK.

The worst that can happen is a small amount of lime scaling which can
easily be removed with the kind of descaler used to descale coffee
makers.

Not quite, Gary.

You will boil out a proportion of the calcium and magnesium salts -
known as temporary hardness - but not the rest, known as permanent
hardness.

If you were to take the remaining water, place it in a clean vessel and
boil that to dry, you would have further deposit.

As regards use in a humidifier, there is nothing to be gained by this,
you might as well use tap water and be done with it.

But they must come apart.   The cheap plastic and aluminum throwaways DO
NOT COME APART.  The more expensive permanent glass and stainless steel

It wouldn't make any sense to put a throwaway plastic and aluminum

through the little hole that the hose connects to.  And the plastic
could very well melt.

The one I am talking about is plastic, in two parts and with a

Oh dear.

Is it perhaps that the water is naturall sulphurous or something?
e.g. do you live in an area where the source could be volcanic?

Distilled water isn't terribly costly, but you could instead get a PUR table
pitcher -- makes a 1/2 gallon of filtered water at a time, last one I bought
was $15.  Or of course a faucet mount purifier would work too.  I don't know
how many gallons of distilled water would equal a reasonable payback of the
expense of either one of these though...  You might be able to run your
humidifer for years on purchased water for the same money :-)

This old dead horse has been beaten so much that there isn't any hide left
on the nag's carcass.  It comes up every few months and for all its
nonimportance provokes a lot of silly responses. As far as the top-posted
message is concerned that approach is balderdash. It gives you nothing but
extra work and a smaller wallet. As has been stated in this group a myriad
of times -- PURE water and DISTILLED water are not the same thing.

If anyone has any more concerns about the subject you can find every anal

No, not volcanic at all.  I don't know what the deal wiht it is!  The water
at my church, which is just less than a mile from my house, the water comes
out of the tap and looks like weak tea!

Someone was talking about the cost of buying it, I buy the stuff from
wal-mart, it's like 60 cents a gallon and lasts me almost 2 weeks.  Thing
is, I fill it to the &quot;max&quot; mark, and don't run the humidifier that high, so
I always have water left over in the morning, so I don't know what I don't
use less so I&quot;m not wasting it!  Although I'm just curious to know what
would happen if it ran out in the middle of the night and was still running?

You seem to be misunderstanding what I wrote, or perhaps you only skimmed
what I wrote.  I did not claim a PUR filter would make distilled water.
What it does is remove much of the smell and scale to make his tap water a
bit cleaner for use in his machine.  I also addressed it could possibly cost
more in the long run than buying distilled water, yet you didn't seem to
notice that either.

If you want to attack me because you don't like where I type or what I
write, then by all means do so!  But please at least read carefully and
attack on the points I actually made.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Distilled water isn't terribly costly, but you could instead get a PUR
&gt;&gt;&gt; table
&gt;&gt;&gt; pitcher -- makes a 1/2 gallon of filtered water at a time, last one I
&gt;&gt;&gt; bought
&gt;&gt;&gt; was $15.  Or of course a faucet mount purifier would work too.  I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; know
&gt;&gt;&gt; how many gallons of distilled water would equal a reasonable payback of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; expense of either one of these though...  You might be able to run your

I disagree.

Q:  What are the perfect growing conditions for mold to grow?
A:  Moisture, warmth, darkness.

Describe your humidifier.
It has water in it, the water is heated, and humid air
passes through the hose to the mask.  [That would be
in the _dark_ because 1) it's night time when I sleep
and 2) I have an insulating sleeve on the hose.]

Check your local water company's water quality report.
Look for the section in that report titled &quot;Microbiological
Constituents&quot;.  In it you will find the level of &quot;Total
Coliforms&quot; (you can figure that out).  The footnote
on turbidity says &quot;Turbidity has no health effects, but
high levels of turbidity can interfere with disinfection
and provide a medium for microbial growth&quot;.

he's making stuff  up from his own ill advised  and dangerous personal

of using  ordinary tap water in your humidifier  or look up different

they ALL say  ( read that as NONE say use tap water ) , ALL to the

the calcium build up issue and they are partially right . but FAR
worse are the  biological issues / dangers related to using tap water.
it's why it NEVER done in patient care environments in hospitals and

I see your point about the biological aspects of using something other than
distilled water in the humidifier.  I would make the leap that the same
holds true for sinus irrigation?  I have used filterd (PUR) tap water for
years and years with no (known) ill effects, but I wonder if I would be
better advised to use distilled water.  Can't see how it would be harmful to
make the switch.  Thanks for the info.

I never met Hal so I don't know ,  but has always been nice to me.

for me,  using deionized  or distilled  water is always the better
choice.  many people live out in the country where they get their
water out of the ground and never have it tested.  The Chicago public
water system, for example , is famous for deaths from having dangerous
microscopic organisms in their water due to poor quality water
treatment.  people frequently die from drinking bad  city water
http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20001219/ai_n13880853
think of the risk if you inhale these bugs into your lungs where they
can attack you easier than your acid stomach !
think too  of how bad the water is in places where there are storms
and floods lately !!!  if you always use deionized water you will
never have to worry about inhaling bugs  from  your water system or
contaminating you hose and mask system !
it's just good  hygiene and  a smart self preservation practice !
lots of people rarely clean their masks and hoses ! they do this and
never have any problems. here where I live if I don't clean my hose
every three or  four days, brown fuzzy stuff starts to grow in it
because this area is very high in airborne mold spores.
people can use tap water if they want, but for myself  I already have
enough health issues and I don't feel like  adding extra risk by
exposing myself to additional  potential sources of illness !

I use either distilled or analytically pure water (depending upon which
of my labs I decide to get it from). For me its free, but I would study
the effect of your tap water and what accumulates in the tank to decide
what to do.

Once I got in late at a motel in upstate New York. In one night the tap
water left more crap on the walls of the tank than I have ever seen. It
was disgusting and would not wash out with any cleaners including
vinegar). I ending up using an aggresive cleaner we use in the lab for
hard to clean glassware to get it out.

I had use tap water in other places previous to that, but that was the
last time.

I never run it dry, but I only fill it about 1/3 of the way to the mark.
I only use the heater in winter(really affects my sinsus).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;was $15.  Or of course a faucet mount purifier would work too.  I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;how many gallons of distilled water would equal a reasonable payback of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;expense of either one of these though...  You might be able to run your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;humidifer for years on purchased water for the same money :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Okay, so I have no water for my humidifier, or at least no distilled
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is recommended.  Would you used anything else?  Or is it okay to run my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CPAP with the humidifier just turned off with no water in it for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;night
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;till I get some?

&gt;&gt;&gt;This old dead horse has been beaten so much that there isn't any hide
&gt;&gt;&gt;left on the nag's carcass.  It comes up every few months and for all its
&gt;&gt;&gt;nonimportance provokes a lot of silly responses. As far as the top-posted
&gt;&gt;&gt;message is concerned that approach is balderdash. It gives you nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt;but extra work and a smaller wallet. As has been stated in this group a
&gt;&gt;&gt;myriad of times -- PURE water and DISTILLED water are not the same thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If anyone has any more concerns about the subject you can find every anal
&gt;&gt;&gt;response you want in the archives.

&gt; Go back and look at what you wrote. You suggested home-purified water as a
&gt; substitute for distilled water. And I repeat: they are not the same. The
&gt; word you chose was &quot;instead&quot; of distilled water. So I read what you read
&gt; exactly as you wrote it. If you wanted to say something else, you should
&gt; have written such. You have a strange way of defining an &quot;attack.&quot;

Personally, I have used and would use distilled water in my CPAP heated
humidifier for two reasons; tap water usually contains chlorine or
cloramine, and tap water can leave deposits inside humidifier chambers.

I do not believe that North American municipal tap water is any more
likely to contain pathogens than distilled water, even if the bottle of
distilled water was recently opened.  I do not advocate the use of tap
water over distilled water in CPAP humidifier.  I do not advocate using
water that is not approved by the humidifier manufacturer.

Two things regarding pathogens in distilled water:

1.  Distilled water is not sterile water.

2.  Most people using distilled water in CPAP humidifiers open
a one gallon jug and then refill or top off their humidifier daily.
A gallon jug typically lasts five to ten days.  Every time the jug
is opened there is an opportunity for the distilled water to become
contaminated.

Except for a very few well publicized incidents, municipal tap water in
North America is pathogen free and safe to drink.  Municipal tap water
in the US is regulated by the EPA and bottled (including distilled
water) is regulated by the FDA.  EPA regulations ensuring pathogens and
carcinogens in water are significantly more stringent than FDA
regulations.  Municipal water system operators must be certified and
trained to ensure that they know how to safely treat and deliver water
-- not so for bottlers.

Replacing &quot;there is an opportunity&quot; with &quot;there is _little_
opportunity&quot; would be more correct.  That gallon container
is open for about 15-20 seconds each time.

That's far from true.
&lt; http://www.epa.gov/enviro/html/sdwis/sdwis_ov.html &gt;
Click on your state, then your county.  Look at several
water systems in your area and see which ones have problems.

Even if it is safe (most are) that is not to say that it
smells good.  There are many communities where the local
tap water has a pronounced (read &quot;bad&quot;) smell.  Do you
really want to breathe that 8 hrs per night?

The real issue is not &quot;is distilled water absolutely, 100.0%
sterile for as long as you use it&quot;?  Only the most OCD would
fixate on that issue.

Instead this is a _relative_ issue.
How does distilled water compare to the average tap water?

The only other significant issue is cost.
Distilled water for your humidifier costs from 8 cents
to 11 cents per night, depending on whether you get it from
Walmart or safeway, or wherever.

The smart money says for 8 cents a night, use distilled
water.  No good reason not to use it.

[1]  Wikipedia:  &quot;Distilled water is water that has virtually
all of its impurities removed through distillation.
Distillation involves _boiling_ the water and re-condensing the
_steam_ into a clean container, leaving most if not all solid
contaminants behind.&quot;

It's easier to just use tap water on occasion.  I wouldn't make a
special trip just to get distilled water -- especially if it requires
the burning of gasoline.
