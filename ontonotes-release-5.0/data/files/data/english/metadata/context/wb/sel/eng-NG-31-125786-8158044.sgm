There's a new threat to progress on climate change -- and it could
undermine all of the work we've done so far.

President Bush and his allies have recognized that the the movement
against climate change is too powerful to be directly confronted. So
Bush, Australia's John Howard, and a small group of other high-
pollution governments are using back-channel pressure to build a bloc
of countries--call it an &quot;Axis of Global Warming&quot;--that plans to
sabotage the negotiations on a binding climate treaty. It's an
extraordinary danger.

They must be stopped. And we've got a plan to do it. We're laying
plans for a massive, country-by-country pressure campaign to block the
Axis of Global Warming--and we need your help to make it work. A donor
has pledged to match all contributions up to 100,000 Euros. Can you
donate now to help save the planet?

https://secure.avaaz.org/en/axis_of_warming/k.php/?cl=15481951

There's strength in numbers--already this year, half a million of us
have taken climate actions with Avaaz. We've run television ads,
delivered massive petitions, marched in the streets and flooded
governments with email messages. Now, if enough of us can contribute
50, 20 or even 1 Euro, we'll have the resources to take all of these
tactics to a new level--and add some spectacular new ones.

Our strategy is simple: expose Bush's plan, and help citizens in
&quot;swing countries&quot; like Japan and Canada to pressure their governments
not to join the Axis of Global Warming. Bush can only succeed if he
rallies enough governments to join his side. But if we show these
governments that there's a price to be paid for abandoning the planet,
people power can prevail.

The next five months are key. Here are the most critical moments:

September 8-9: Australia's John Howard hosts the Asia-Pacific APEC
summit, gathering leaders of 21 countries including the US, China,
Japan, Russia, and Canada. We need to shame the Axis of Global
Warming, disrupt their alliance-building and persuade the swing voters
to stay strong for a UN process--and we're working with Australian
campaigners GetUp on a spectacular plan to spoil Bush and Howard's
party in Sydney.

September 27-28: Bush's &quot;Major Emitters&quot; conference of the world's
biggest polluters. This is likely to be the public unveiling of Bush's
plan. Reports are already circulating that Bush's summit is intended
to undercut the UN efforts; in fact, the UN is hosting a special
session on climate change the week before. Before the UN summit and
Bush's conference, we'll empower Avaaz members in each of our
countries, pressing national leaders to commit publicly to a real
deal--and reject Bush's game.

December 3-14: UN-led negotiations begin in Bali, Indonesia for a
global climate change treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. This is
the big one: the key to ending the climate crisis. We'll be there in
force, virtually and for real. Every nation gets a voice in Bali--and
because we have members in every nation, so do we. Avaaz will work
outside and inside to influence the negotiations as they happen, day
to day and hour by hour.
These are the moments that will define whether the climate crisis can
be stopped -- and our ability to influence them together will be
determined in part by our resources. For example, we need:

25,000 Euros to build tools enabling Avaaz members to directly contact
their leaders--tools capable of sending millions of messages to
hundreds of governments in a dozen languages, fast.

8,000 Euros to mount a major stunt at the Asia-Pacific summit in
Sydney, grabbing the attention of leaders and the media

5,000 Euros each to buy full-page newspaper ads in key &quot;swing voter&quot;
countries like Japan, Canada or China
Avaaz has a lot of members, but a small staff--currently just nine
people, working from five cities on three continents. We're laser-
focused on squeezing every bit of impact we can from every Euro or
dollar we spend. This is a David and Goliath struggle, the people of
the world versus the Axis of Global Warming--and we simply can't
afford to lose. Can you help, by donating whatever you can?

It's no such thing. David didn't go running to the U.N. for
assistance, and the Axis of Global Warming is a perceived threat, not
a giant with a bad reputation.

It is the the tried and true good-cop bad-cop game, with Bush playing
the bad cop and the U.N. playing the good cop. But the bottom line is
that they both play the game to control people, and overstating the
human role in global warming makes it look like controlling people is
the best solution to the perceived threat of global warming.

Especially now we know the NASA figures are wrong and that 1934
was the hottest year in the US, not 1998.. and 5 of the 10
hottest years last century occurred before WW2.
Add in the Mann Hockey Stick fiasco and the whole thing is wobbling.

It is not a great revision, the differences are well within the error
bars.  We always knew that the USA had a couple of very warm years in the
1930s (think Grapes of Wrath) but that didn't seem to be true for the world
as a whole, nor for averages over decades.  It is still true that the last
10 years average was higher than any other decade with reliable
measurements.

Assuming that the latest prediction for the next decade works out to be
reasonably accurate (ie rapid warming after next year) will you then stop
leaping up and down on any cold day and saying that it disproves AGW?

The evidence remains what it's always been. The temp is up a bit
over the last 100 years. Quite a bit of the increase precedes
WW2. The temp may continue to rise, or it may fall. CO2 and
sunspots may have something to do with it, as may coming out of
the little ice age.

We will know that something serious is happening when climate
warming gurus stop flying, downsize their houses, walk or row to
work, give all their money to the poor and turn to religion big time.

Anthropogenic global warming is nothing but a bloody great rort by academics

There is no threat.  Moderate warming will be a good thing.  Cooling will be
a bad thing.  The chances of cooling are far greater than warming.  Carbon
dioxide is a fertilizer and without it in the atmosphere there would be no
plant or animal life on this planet.

Reliable? Do you know about the microclimates that have been installed

Regardless, 10 years is not long enough to prove anything bad is about

Greenland?

There is no predication, only a projection from a computer model.

These models do a very poor job of describing the clouds, the dust,
the chemistry and the biology of fields and farms and forests. They do
not begin to describe the real world that we live in. The real world
is complex and full of climate factors that we do not yet understand.
It is much easier for a scientist to sit in an air-conditioned
building and run computer models, than to put on winter clothes and
measure what is really happening outside in the swamps and the clouds.
That is why the climate model experts end up believing their own
models. http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge219.html#dysonf

That's the point. The climate is ever changing. Always has,
always will. But narrowing your focus to one tiny time frame
means that in 1932 the New York Times predicted a 51 foot rise in
sea level, scientists predicted an ice age in the 1970s, and
today some scientists predict the Kyoto gods are angry and we
must do penance.

Not always so easily separated.  Someone with a leaning towards Theory product,

malicious bias the structure of surveys allows X to be readily concluded to be
valid, which further confirms the personnel in their original inclination to
believe that the evidence for X is much stronger than for non-X.

Human nature.  I had an argument with a dear person who does voluntary work with
prisoners.  She is highly resistant to my belief that prisoners tend to massage
their back-stories when telling them to charitably-disposed ladies so as to make
their offending seem an pitiable response to a shocking early life.  No, no!

Does anyone seriously assert that it isn't?  It always has changed and probably
always will, usually on a scale that shows up with long, long hindsight, though
within the trend up or down are innumerable zigzags, with smaller zigzags on
each zig and zag.

Could it be that the apparent shocking increase in life-threatening natural
disasters (floods etc) is tied to a global increase in population (and in news
dissemination) so that a flood that might have affected hundreds of people, many
of whom might have been able to get out of the way, now sweeps through densely
packed urban areas causing vastly more damage and loss of life?

Back in the 70s, the example used was the flood plains of
Bangladesh. The floods would drown a few tens of thousands, and
everyone would say how awful, but after the floods, back would
come the people because the plains were fertile and a place to
live. Besides, it was the Will of Allah.

The interesting thing here, is that without the floods and the
associated burst of fertility, the people would have less food to
survive. Maybe Allah knows best after all.

Of course it has warmed since the last glaciation, as it has warmed after
every glaciation.  It has warmed since the Little Ice Age.  However it
appears to have stopped warming for the moment.  Whether the climate resumes
warming or goes into a cooling phase is nearly an even bet.  In my view the
probability is that it will cool rather than warm.  In my view carbon
dioxide may, in theory, contribute slightly to climatic warming the feedback
effects, most of which we cannot quantify, will mask any theoretical warming
due to increased carbon dioxide.

That's never been the question. The word climate itself only HAS

degree (if any) it is anthropogenic, to what degree CO2 contributes to
some marginal change beyond what was happening anyway (if any), and
what (if anything) we could do about this, should we want to make the
attempt?

Subsidiary to these considerations is the one on how much of our
current civilisation will we choose to destroy in order to pander to
those who think they already know the answers to these questions, even
though they're unable to make a convincing honest argument to justify
their conclusions?

Computer models require algorithms that accurately describe the physics.  In
this case some of the physics is known but much is not and much can only be
described in words rather than quantified numerically.  Furthermore as the
number of variables increase the probability of various combinations of
variables resulting in the same outcome increases dramatically.  This is
known as equivalence and a good example of it occurs in geoelectrical
sounding in which the mathematics is known and proven.  I might add that you
can construct and equation which will draw a line through every currant but
one in a pudding.  It will not desribe the postion of the last currant nor
will it describe the position of any cuaant in the next pudding, except by
chance.

I caught the end of some fellow being interviewed by Kim Hill on

According to IPCC the bulk of the upward trend of the last 100 years or so
can be attributed to anthropogenic factors.  The best evidence is that it
was the cause of a large minority of the warming of the first half of the
20C and the majority of the warming of the second half, with pollution the
major cause of the reduction in the middle. Without human factors there
would probably have been a smaller rise in temperature in the beginning of
last century with fluctuations but no significant trend after that.

Of course Insurance companies are self-interested, but they also follow

Yep.

The media is not a forum for getting info on weather (oops) whether

to pull the heart strings of the readership. Climate modeling works an

And when a current model is run over past climate events, it was
interesting to see that only 1 prediction in about 6 was nearly
correct. On closer study, the 1 that was correct was found to have
used faulty data, so in fact none of the model worked.

How is a &quot;stupid&quot; model that doesn't match the past help us imagine

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I could put up with the constant carping if I though that there would come
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a time would you would put up your hand and admit you were wrong based on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the evidence.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no evidence.  This nonsense is based on computer games and nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; else.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Without wishing to enter the debate proper, I wonder when computer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; modelling  (&quot;computer games&quot; seems like  an attempt to denigrate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; computer modelling) ceased to be an appropriate method of forecasting.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would have thought that computer modelling has enabled mankind to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; put satellites in orbit around distant planets. Why wouldn't you use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such powerful tools for climate change predictions?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Climate is thousands or millions of times more complex than simple
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; physics. New factors influencing the climate are discovered every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; month.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Then climate change predictions for warming due to anthropogenic effects
&gt;&gt;&gt; may be far worse than previously predicted.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You are alternately claiming you know what is going to happen, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; claiming that it is impossible to predict from past data, what is going
&gt;&gt;&gt; to happen.

&gt;&gt; Or far better. I don't think Roger is claiming an ability to
&gt;&gt; predict the future. But he points out the science supporting
&gt;&gt; AGW is shit. Awful shit. Moreover there is a lot of money
&gt;&gt; being spent by various governments who take the science as
&gt;&gt; gospel truth. Roger questions the intelligence of that. So
&gt;&gt; do I.

&gt; You are suckers for the propaganda of the denialists that all the
&gt; science is shit because some of the data is wrong.
&gt; There is no alternative to applying the scientific method to make
&gt; preparations for future climate conditions, those who do will have an
&gt; advantage over those who don't. Regardless of whether you approve or
&gt; diapprove of carbon trading incentive schemes, the atmospheric physics
&gt; still remains. The denialists seem to use science fiction authors and
&gt; television weathermen as their spokesmen, and have more investment in
&gt; rhetoric than scientific method which makes their motivation a tad
&gt; suspicious.

What scientific method exactly? afaiac weather is a chaotic
system not fully understood by anyone at all.

What turned my opinion was reading some old wine literature
- of which I have plenty lying around. It seems it was a
good deal warmer in the 12/13th century than it is now. A
warming period that ended abruptly. It was much warmer than
that in the last intergalacial - pre-Hoxnian. This is known
by writings about wine and archealogical evidence of grape
pollen. Grapes require a specific temperature range to grow,
and a narrower/warmer band to produce decent wines.

Nobody can explain what caused these previous warm periods,
and at the same time nobody denies they occured, or that
they are unrelated to human activity. Nobody can tell me if
it is not the same things causing those that are causing
this warm period or not. I conclude the 'scientific method'
you are referring to is hopelessly flawed. Call that being
sucked in if you like. But be aware exactly the same
criticism can more easily be redirected back.
