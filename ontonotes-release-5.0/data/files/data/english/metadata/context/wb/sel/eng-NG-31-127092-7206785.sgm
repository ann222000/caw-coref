Uneventful Monday -- went to the gym, then spent the rest of the day
at home.  I'm being lazy -- preoccupied with stuff going on with my
mom -- mostly web surfing and catching up on TiVo -- watching Golden
Globes right now.  Anyway...

Food:

* 7:15 (home): 2 poached eggs on 1 slice whole wheat toast w/ 3 slices
melted f/f cheese & 10g grated parmesan
* 10:45 (gym, between lifting & yoga): energy bar
* 12:45 (driving home -- happened to have these in the car): 1 1/2
Wasa fiber rye crackers
* 2:00 (home): 4 oz. ground turkey breast burger on whole wheat
hamburger bun w/ 3 slices f/f cheese, dill pickle slices, & catsup
* 4:30 (home): 1 pear
* 8:45 (home): 2 cups chunky pot roast soup; 6 oz. wine; 1 fortune
cookie
* 9:15 (home): 1 oz. dark chocolate

Totals: 1530 calories (117 from alcohol), 35g fat (20%), 167g carbs
(44%), 114g protein (30%)

Exercise:

* 10:00 -- lifting: chin-up negatives; machine-assisted pull-ups
(parallel grip); machine-assisted dips; machine seated row; machine
chest press; machine rear delt (reverse fly); machine fly; machine
shoulder press; machine curl; machine overhead triceps extension {I
conked my head on the handle of the pull-up machine -- quite hard,
have a big bump -- and decided to stay away from free weights for the
rest of the session as I was a little unsure about my balance --
recovered okay, though.}

* 11:00 -- 75 minute vinyasa yoga class

Sorry to hear about your mom. Has her health been improving?

A few questions on diet: 1. What's the brand of chocolate do you eat? I
eat the mi-sweet Baker's, one or two one-ounce
pieces every day. I eat it slowly. I even sometimes micro-wave it,
until the inside is solid but the outside is liquid. It gives much more
flavor, but the extra flavor incites you to eat more...  2. What is the
brand of energy bar you eat?

Gotto go now as I have 80 floors to climb before going to bed. Bye!

Not really, at this point.  She's 90 years old and her mind isn't that
great.  She's in assisted living -- and is right now temporarily in
the nursing home section as she has some issues going on.  It's
frustrating for my brother and me to try to figure out just what's
going on with her sometimes, given that she isn't very good about
telling us (because she gets confused and forgetful) and the people at
the hospital and nursing home apparently aren't permitted to tell us
much.  (The assisted living people will tell us everything, but when
she's out of their immediate hands they don't always have the
information, especially over a holiday weekend.)  Part of my problem
is I feel guilty that I'm not there,but she lives 7 hours away and I
can't just take up life there.  Of course I would go if she was in
immediate danger, but no one thinks that's the case -- and I have a
trip scheduled in less than two weeks.  But I worry a lot about it all
-- enough to lose sleep.

Generally we buy Ghirardelli dark chocolate squares.  Lately, though,
I've been eating something called "Wine Lover's Chocolate" that they
sell at the winery -- little boxes of dark chocolate discs.  I let
them melt in my mouth.  Each disc is about 2g so an ounce gives me a
lot of pieces -- lasts me about 30 minutes the way I eat it.  This
actually comes in several slightly different varieties -- all dark,
but differing a bit in cocoa content -- formulated to go with
different types of wine.  I really like it, but I'm sure it's not a
cost-effective way to buy chocolate :-).  Here's a link to an amazon
site selling it: http://tinyurl.com/ymej8k .

(You probably know this, but dark chocolate is better for you than
semi-sweet.)

I eat bars from Life Time Fitness -- my gym chain.  I always eat the
Peanut Butter Crunch flavor.  They sell these at some retail stores,
as well as at my gym, but I get them in bulk by mail order.  Here's a
link:

(These aren't really particularly healthy things, though they do have
a bunch of added nutrients, but I like them and can eat them on the
run.)

Thanks for the info about everything, including your mother. I've been
through this ordeal, too.

I walked up the 105 floors. I used to climb 180 floors last year. Of
course, it was after a week of daily climbing and I was 15 pounds
slimmer. Amazing that it's just now that I realized that I really let
myself go in inactivity and over-eating. Once I get back to what I used
to be, I will make sure I'll never go back to what I've been in the
last months. I think I already said that last year...
