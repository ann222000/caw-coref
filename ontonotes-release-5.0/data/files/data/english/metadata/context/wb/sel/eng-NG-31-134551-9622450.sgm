UNSAFE : Barclays 'chairman'
scams his own bank
Fraudster
poses as bank’s chairman, withdraws £10,000
Andrew
Hendry

http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php?id=732567044&amp;eid=-6787

Barclays
bank in the UK has found itself at the centre of another security scam, this
time around someone posed as the bank's chairman and scammed £10,000 out of his
personal account.

The
fraudster rang a Barclays call centre posing as the bank's chairman, Marcus
Agius, and managed to have a new credit card sent out to him under Agius' name.

He
then went into a Barclays branch and used the newly issued credit card to
withdraw £10,000 out of Agius personal account.

Britain's
Sun newspaper reported that Barclay's bosses were 'burning up' with
embarrassment.

The
scam follows the highly publicised actions of BBC Top Gear presenter Jeremy
Clarkson, who published his Barclay's account number in an attempt to prove
that the UK's largest ever data breach was nothing to fuss over.

A
cheeky reader subsequently used the details to help Clarkson 'donate' £500 to a
UK charity .

&quot;The
banks have to protect people connecting to their services, but if I know enough
about you or anyone, you would be amazed what I could do,&quot; said Andreas
Baumhof, CTO of online fraud protection company TrustDefender.

&quot;If
you've lost your account number or password for online banking, is your bank
providing you with a service to recover those details? Every bank does, because
it's a normal thing that happens,&quot; he said.

&quot;They
provide you with this information after checking your identity, which typically
is your address, telephone number and some personal information. So if you know
this information they will release your password.&quot;

Baumhof
said call centres are a typical target of online fraudsters and identity
thieves. Their tactics involve bombarding a call centre with phone calls,
talking to a different person each time and extracting a little piece of
information with each call.

&quot;After
they've rung them fifty times, you can connect a lot of information about
someone,&quot; he warned.

According
to Baumhof a lot comes down to telling the right story to the right person.

&quot;In
the end it comes down to human behaviour, if you look like you are in the right
place at the right time then people tend to trust you.&quot;

Baumhof
said that with the right story and the right personal information, the security
measures of any bank can be circumvented because of this human element.

&quot;The
banks can provide really good secure protection but it only helps if we protect
people's identities generally.&quot;

Barclay's
is reported to have accepted liability for the breach and has reimbursed the
£10,000 into Agius' account.

Amid
fears other senior execs could become targets, the bank is reported to have
reissued all passwords and is revising its security practices.

TAX CON : ATM
con men net $22.4 million in Japan
ATM
con men net 2.45 billion yen / Cases of scammers posing as tax officials spikes
650% in 2007
The
Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan
Jan.
8, 2008
http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080108TDY02304.htm

People
posing as tax office officials and calling victims to offer refunds managed to
net a total of 2.45 billion yen in 2,158 fraudulent cash transfers using
automated teller machines between January and November last year, police said.

The
total amount swindled shot up sevenfold from the corresponding period the
previous year and the number of cases rose by about 650 percent.

The
majority of victims have been people aged 60 or over and the fraudsters are
believed to have preyed on their unfamiliarity with using ATMs.

The
frauds were committed across the country in an almost uniform method.

The
scam involves a criminal group member pretending to be an official from a
public institution, such as a tax or social insurance office, who calls a
victim and instructs them to take their cash card and mobile phone to an ATM to
receive a refund for overpayment of tax or pension premiums.

They
then call the victim's mobile phone and tell them the &quot;procedure&quot; to
receive the refunds.

Giving
false information such as an &quot;identity code&quot; and a &quot;refund
code,&quot; they dupe the victim into actually keying in an amount and account
number and have them transfer money to one of the swindlers' accounts.

The
perpetrators use several tricks to confuse their victims.

In
many cases they tell their victims they have to perform the procedure within
that day and win over their trust by specifying amounts down to the exact yen.

Also
conspicuous was the fact that they usually instructed people to go to ATMs at
financial institutions or convenience stores where no bank clerks were present.

The
National Police Agency has classified the crimes as a new type of bank transfer
scam and has instructed forces across the country to step up investigations.

According
to the NPA, the first case of this type was confirmed in June 2006 in Saitama
Prefecture.

The
number of cases increased every month, and by the end of November that year
about 340 million yen had been swindled from 328 people.

Last
year, 79 cases were confirmed in January and more than 100 cases in each of the
months to June.

The
figure rose to more than 200 in July and broke the 300 mark in October.
November saw a record-high of 387 confirmed cases.

Top PRODIGY : Schoolboy hacks into city's tram system

A
teenage boy who hacked into a Polish tram system used it like &quot;a giant
train set&quot;, causing chaos and derailing four vehicles.

The
14-year-old, described by his teachers as a model pupil and an electronics
&quot;genius&quot;, adapted a television remote control so it could change
track points in the city of Lodz.

The
teenage boy and some of the equipment he used

boy, described as a 'genius'and some of the equipment he used

Twelve
people were injured in one derailment, and the boy is suspected of having been
involved in several similar incidents.

The
teenager, who was not named by police, told them he had changed the points for
a prank.

A
police statement said he had trespassed at tram depots in the city to gather
information and the equipment needed to build the infra-red device.

&quot;Questioned
by police in the presence of a psychologist, the teenager testified he switched
tram tracks three times, once causing a tram to jump the tracks,&quot; said the
statement. A search at the boy's home turned up the device he had used to
switch tram tracks.

Miroslaw
Micor, a spokesman for Lodz police, said: &quot;He studied the trams and the
tracks for a long time and then built a device that looked like a TV remote
control and used it to manoeuvre the trams and the tracks.

&quot;He
had converted the television control into a device capable of controlling all
the junctions on the line and wrote in the pages of a school exercise book
where the best junctions were to move trams around and what signals to change.

&quot;He
treated it like any other schoolboy might a giant train set, but it was lucky
nobody was killed. Four trams were derailed, and others had to make emergency
stops that left passengers hurt. He clearly did not think about the
consequences of his actions.&quot;

The
first sign of the chaos came on Tuesday afternoon, when a city tram driver
tried to steer his vehicle to the right, but found himself helpless to stop it
swerving to the left instead.

The
rear wagon then swung off the rails and crashed into another passing tram,
hurling screaming passengers to the floor.

Transport
employees were reported as saying that they knew immediately that someone
outside their staff had caused the accident.

The
boy will face a special juvenile court on charges of endangering public safety,
police said.

The
incident is the latest in which &quot;hackers&quot; - many of them young
computer experts - have broken into computer systems.

A
20-year-old was questioned in New Zealand last year suspected of writing
programs for an internet &quot;spyware&quot; scam targeting several hundred
thousand bank accounts.

In
1999, a group of hackers used home computers to break into the systems
controlling Skynet, a British military satellite, and changed secure settings.

A
report by the US Federal Aviation Administration this week raised concerns that
a passenger aboard the new Boeing 787 &quot;Dreamliner&quot; aircraft might be
able to hack into the aircraft's systems via its internet connection.

Top UNBREAKABLE YET : PKI is alive and kicking
By
John Adams, ChosenSecurity,

Commentary--Today,
there is a wide range of technology, products and solutions for securing an
enterpris'’s electronic infrastructure. As with physical access security, the
levels of security implemented should be commensurate with the level of
complexity of the enterprise, the applications in use, the data in play, and
the measurement of the overall risk at stake. Many organizations are starting
to deploy certificates to secure a number of different pieces of the
enterprise. Certificates are used to encrypt and sign e-mail, authenticate both
people and machines to remote access servers, and to digitally sign documents
and transactions.

Traditionally
provisioning certificates has been complex and costly due to the need to set up
a PKI (public key infrastructure) system. This has proved to be a significant
undertaking and required a significant commitment in both people and dollars.
Now it is possible to use a different approach, by implementing “PKI On-Demand”
using the software as a service (SaaS) model. In this approach, an organization
only needs a Web browser to interact with the PKI services. End users enroll
for their credentials using a browser, and administrators perform management tasks
using a browser. The PKI services are delivered by a managed service supplier,
using a virtual PKI configured for the customer.

Companies
clearly need to protect sensitive digital data that is central to their
operations. Some examples are the storage of customer transaction records,
electronic notarization of documents via the Web, and the authentication of
bank transfers. In short, any exchange or storage of digital information where
there is a requirement to ensure the information is secure, or to know that the
entity on the other end of the digital universe is the entity they claim to be.
Certificates and public key cryptography are widely recognized as the only
practical mechanism capable of securing a broad range of applications in a
controlled and managed way.

A
full enterprise PKI-based security system may not be a fit for all business
environments, but more and more companies are finding that they can benefit
from using PKI to secure some aspects of an enterprise’s electronic
infrastructure. A PKI deployment offers a unique value in managing the risk of
both internal and external communications between employees, partners and
customers, and can help to secure transactions and communications across a wide
range of disparate platforms, applications and devices.

How are Digital Certificates
used in today’s enterprise?

There
are numerous applications that incorporate PKI in a typical corporate
enterprise today. Some of the more common applications are as follows:

· Web
Server Authentication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
· Virtual
Private Network (VPN) Server Authentication (IPSec and SSL)
· Client
Authentication to Web Servers (Internet/Intranet/Extranet) and VPNs
· Digital
signing of e-mails, forms, documents and invoices
· Encryption
of e-mails, documents, forms, transactions and files in transit
· Encryption
of data at rest on laptops, thumb drives, mobile phones, etc.
· Code
signing / mobile phone code signing

Some
of the many benefits of implementing a PKI include:

· A
single credential (certificate) per user which can be used for multiple
processes and applications, in lieu of having multiple usernames and passwords.
This is a significant administration benefit as user groups grow.
· Use
of digital signatures to provide a persistent and auditable record of transactions.
· The
same PKI investment can also be used to secure site-to-site connections,
extranets, server-to-server communications, device authentication, etc.
· Simplifying
password management. With PKI, there is no longer the need for constant
password management and continual user support when passwords are forgotten.

Back to the future: The new
old school

Traditionally
a PKI implementation has required a significant upfront investment, and
involved a commitment to install a dedicated security infrastructure. This is
no longer true, and it is now possible to obtain PKI services in an on demand
model, where you pay only for the portion of the infrastructure you use, and
need not install any dedicated systems on you site. This enables organizations
to cost effectively do implementations of fewer than 500 users.

PKI
is emerging as the best balance of strong security, commercial availability,
and cost effectiveness. Time tested and continuously improved since its
commercial introduction, the On-Demand PKI delivery model drives the cost down
dramatically without sacrificing protection and guaranteed service levels. This
SaaS model has been a key to the renaissance of this old school security
solution, a.k.a. in-house PKI or traditional managed PKI.

On-Demand
PKI removes the complexity of setting up and configuring the initial system.
Because the backend security infrastructure is all ready up and running,
getting a new PKI running is simply a matter of setting the appropriate
configuration parameters. Once the system has been configured, the customer can
administer the system from a Web browser, enrolling users and issuing
certificates, without having to install and manage any of the underlying
security infrastructure.

In
general, a managed PKI is more cost effective and easier to implement than an
in-house solution, with over a 50 percent difference in cost between in-house
PKI and a traditional Managed PKI. The new On-Demand PKI model, however, drives
these costs down by an additional 50 percent for the same PKI functionality.
The combination of a faster implementation time, with a lower cost to implement
significantly improves the ROI on using PKI.

The
implications are significant. Companies who could not previously afford PKI can
now have the same security used by the world’s largest organizations. Customers
can get their system up and running more quickly, and &quot;pay as they
grow&quot;--rather than &quot;paying up front.&quot;

Top New IT Term of the day
Internet Key
Exchange
The
Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol is a key management protocol standard that
is used in conjunction with the IPSec standard. IKE enhances IPSec by providing
additional features, flexibility, and ease of configuration for the IPSec
standard. IPSec can however, be configured without IKE. Benefits provided by
IKE include:

Ø Eliminates
the need to manually specify all the IPSec security parameters in the crypto
maps at both peers.
Ø Allows
you to specify a lifetime for the IPSec security association.
Ø Allows
encryption keys to change during IPSec sessions.
Ø Allows
IPSec to provide anti-replay services.
Ø Permits
Certification Authority (CA) support for a manageable, scalable IPSec
implementation.
Ø Allows
dynamic authentication of peers.
