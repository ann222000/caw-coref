New Message Dock Icon in Mail question

All,
I have a little annoyance that I can't seem to fix in OS X Mail. So,
when you have an unread message in your Inbox, you know how the dock
icon changes to have the red number with the number of unread
messages? Well, I would like that same functionality if there is an
unread message in a folder I've created. See, I've created a mailbox
(folder) and set up a rule to send all messages with the text
&quot;Volleyball&quot; in them to this folder. Since this happens whenever new
mail arrives, the messages are moved immediately. Currently, this also
means that the OSX dock icon doesn't indicate that I have any unread
messages. See, the problem is that sometimes I like to have my
computer on mute, Mail minimized, and then I go away for a little,
miss a new message, come back, and can't tell I got any new mail until
I open the mail window again.

Does anyone know how to make the dock icon display the number of
unread messages *anywhere* in the Mail app (ie folders, etc)? Not just
in the Inbox?

Thanks

Eric

&gt; &gt; This may do it for you; it's a bit of a kludge, though; you have to
&gt; &gt; set a rule for every mailbox or folder you want included--and if you
&gt; &gt; add a folder, you have to add a rule for that folder.

&gt; Whoops; I forgot to include the URL:

Does it work with smart mailboxes? I have one set to only display
unread messages...

I asked only out of curiosity, I don't need the feature at all. I
thought it might assist the OP, is all.

I didn't until recently. But once I started playing around with them I
realized how useful they are.

I use different ones from time to time. Currently, I have one set to
display all unread messages (consolidating five accounts), and one set
to display all flagged messages.

I use temporary ones to display all email to and from a particular
person.

I've used them to display messages with attachments, to trim my mail
folder size.

etc..

&gt; I have used them before, but for very limited use.  Most of my email is
&gt; email lists, and I have a folder for each list with rules sorting the
&gt; mail into the folders.  The only mail in my inbox are those messages
&gt; that are not in any of the lists.  I also have one folder for my most
&gt; prolific correspondent--a personal friend whom I've known for about
&gt; fifteen years.
">

Can't you do the same thing with rules that just move the messages to
ordinary folders?  That's what I do for tasks like that.

I haven't started using smart folders yet, and I wonder what real
benefit they provide above those of ordinary rules?  The only extra
feature I can see is that a message may match the criteria for multiple
smart folders, and it would appear in each of them.  But I don't expect
that to happen much.

The biggest advantage for me is to have two smart mailboxes: One for current
mail in all mailboxes and the second for all unread mail anywhere. There are
other occasions where a temporary smart mailbox can help me keep track of
something.

You said &quot;I have used them before&quot;, where &quot;them&quot; is smart folders.  I
thought the rest of your message was expanding on how you used them.
