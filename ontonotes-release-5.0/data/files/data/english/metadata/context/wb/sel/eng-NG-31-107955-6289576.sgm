I am wondering how birds survive cold winter.   Unlike polar bears, they
don't have thick fur nor thick fat under the skin.
Furthermore, they don't have heater in their nests!      Craig

I'm sure that a few people in this group are supplying heaters (and warm
water in the bird baths).

They do have fat, but it's more of a food reserve than insulation. Most
birds have down under their contour feathers, like a down vest. It's
quite effective. They also have a relatively high metabolism that
generates plenty of heat. Finally, if it gets too cold, some birds go
into torpor at night, a hibernation-like state of reduced metabolism
that lowers body temperature and uses much less energy.

Nests are generally used only for incubating eggs and raising chicks.
They're typically abandoned when the chicks fledge.

Birds which migrate don't need anything other than food and water.  As
for birds which migrate to the area for winter and like us, get stuck
smack in the middle of a 4 day ice storm event in Austin, TX...these
birds depend greatly on water and seed or suet.  Since we have a huge
population of wildflowers here, there is no lack of food in winter,
but we've been putting out heavier foods for them during this storm.
They live in a huge brush pile we made for them.

They fluff their feathers up, trapping warm air between them. It's
very good insulation. AFAIK, they can also reduce the bloodflow to the
legs at will to prevent heat loss from the bare skin.

I can observe this most mornings when I get up. We're in the middle of
a cold snap and the heating in my place is crappy - Sid (my macaw)
sits puffed up and he looks double his normal size. My body is cold
but his is incredibly warm.

Parrots normal body temperature, especially a Macaw (I have one) is
normally 104.  I love when my bird snuggles under the covers and keeps
me warm!

As a warm blooded creature, a passerine (songbird) has a body
temperature that varies between 102 degrees Fahrenheit and 112.3
degrees Fahrenheit. During periods of extreme cold, its temperature may
drop drastically. How does a bird control its body temperature so it
won't freeze when the ambient temperature plummets below the freezing
mark? How does it find warm places to sleep?

A bird's coat of feathers forms its primary defense against cold.
Passerines' feathers are so thick that very little skin is exposed to
air, which prevents body heat from escaping. A system of muscles
connected to each feather enables a bird to raise or lower its
feathers. When the environmental temperature falls, a bird "fluffs"
its feathers much the same as we "fluff" a down jacket increasing
the air spaces. The more air spaces, the better the insulation.

Birds have other means of retaining heat. Sometimes a bird draws one
leg up into its belly feathers. Ground feeding juncos, sparrows, and
some finches lower their bodies to ground level to cover their feet
with feathers. You also may see a bird with its head and bill tucked
back into its scapulars, or feathers along its shoulder.

A bird can increase its body heat by stimulating muscle activity
through shivering. A bird that shakes all over is revving its engine to
stay warm.

Some birds - bluebirds and chickadees, for example- sleep in groups
on extremely cold nights, transferring heat from one body to the next.
In some instances, birds find tree cavities or nest boxes for this sort
of group sleeping.

Some species - such as swifts, nighthawks, and hummingbirds -
reduce their energy requirements by going into a state of torpor. This
lowers their body temperature by several degree to a level near that of
the air.

Most birds that come to our backyard feeders stock up on seed and suet
shortly before retiring for the night. This fuel stokes their fire so
to speak.

This morning was the first here (central NJ) with a dusting of snow on
the ground. Not long after sunrise, I saw several chickadees (I think; I
didn't have my glasses on) going back and forth between an overturned
boat and the feeder. I wonder what they perched on in the boat. I'm
almost afraid to look! Temperature: 32F, 0C.

It could be a one-night stand, or even a morning meeting place. Oars,
mast and boom are lashed to the seats, so there are perches.

My bluebird boxes always show signs of having been used over the
winter.  Interestingly, and I hadn't noticed before, b-birds are
evident this winter -- even in the middle of our Ozarks Ice Storm.

As Larry will verify, on the back cover of the monthly Missouri
Conservationist for this month is a bluebird, perched on an ice covered
berry bush, lowered onto its feet and flluffed up like a blue tennis
ball, seemingly waiting for a berry to emerge from the ice.

Chickadees and perhaps other small birds will roost under dead leaves
still hanging on trees.  Some oak trees hang on to their dead leaves
into the winter.  Chickadees will roost under clumps of these hanging
down.   Their body temperature is so high that they create a
mini-environment in a small space.    Other small creatures also have
this ability.  One time while we were living in St. Louis one of our
domestic rabbits had gotten loose and produced babies in a shallow
nest she built under the back porch.  One night it was going to go
down to -15 and I knew that mother rabbits do not stay in the nest
with their babies.  I also knew that if I moved them she might reject
them but I decided to risk bringing them in the house because i was
sure they were going to freeze to death anyway.  when I pulled aside
the fur ball they were covered in and stuck my hand in to retrieve the
babies, I was amazed at how hot it was inside the nest.  I covered
them back uyp and left them.  They were fine.  Nature has her ways.

Indeed she does. In our haste to "help" wild animals, it's easy to
forget that every bit of their behavior has been honed by millennia of
evolution. If it didn't work, they wouldn't be here. It's that simple.

That said, in marginal situations some individuals will perish. That's
normal, too, and species' reproductive strategies compensate to keep
their populations stable (as long as we don't mess with their habitat
too much).

As humans, we tend to focus on individuals. Nature, though, deals with
species, and individual organisms are expendable, especially if their
instincts aren't a good match for their lifestyles. Helping the weak
survive doesn't strengthen a species' gene pool.

Hi Rick,
We were at Point Reyes in 1998, and as I recall it didn't seem to be
an ideal nesting place for GH Owls. Lots of open areas until you
reach the windswept pines along the coast, where the pines have a
permanent inland tilt because of the Pacific winds. And there's the
Point Reyes lighthouse, an easy downhill walk to get to, but the 309
steps back are difficult. The San Andreas fault runs through Point
Reyes and was the epicenter of the 1906 earthquake. I was nervous.

Maybe more than you wanted to know.

Hi Dick,

There are several GHOW nesting sites on the peninsula.  One above the
fish docks at Chimney and another on the Mendoza Ranch.  I have also
seen them along with Barn Owls at the old RCA facility.

I know that area very well.  My family lived in Inverness and most of my
close family have home there--sort of like a "Lake Place" in MN.
