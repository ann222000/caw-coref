Teamsters continue to battle Mexican trucks

The plan to let Mexican trucks operate throughout the United States
has prompted a war of words and legal papers between the Bush
administration and Jim Hoffa, the president of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters.

Hoffa and his allies at the Sierra Club and Public Citizen have sued
in federal court to stop the government from issuing permits to
Mexican freight haulers. Their lawyers argued in court that Mexican
trucks pose a danger on the roads and threaten increased human and
drug smuggling.

&quot;Dangerous trucks should not be driving all the way from Mexico to
Maine and Minnesota,&quot; said Hoffa in a prepared statement. &quot;What is it
about safety and national security that George Bush doesn't
understand?&quot;

The government argued that stopping the trucks would unsettle a key
trading partner in Mexico and delay U.S.trucks from operating south of
the border. Officials insist that a lengthy pre-inspection of Mexican
firms has resulted in strict safety standards and compliance with
congressional mandates.

&quot;We chose to do this incrementally and cautiously,&quot; said John Hill,
who runs the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which
regulates truck safety and is responsible for the cross-border
trucking plan. &quot;These carriers are going to be safe.&quot;

He has 254 inspectors along the border. Only 16 of the 188 firms
inspected have failed. Just over 100 withdrew, signaling the
inspections are rigorous, Hill said.The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
in San Francisco on Friday denied an emergency injunction to halt the
program. The union will continue its lawsuit.

Nothing can happen until the inspector general of the Department of
Transportation blesses the one-year experiment and until the Mexican
government issues permits to U.S. trucking companies.

That all could happen as early as Thursday.

The heated rhetoric has melted into obscurity the fact that very few
firms on either side of the border are interested. To date, 31 Mexican
firms - with a maximum of 151 trucks - are poised for U.S. permits,
and two-thirds of the firms are in Baja California. Two Mexican border
states have no firms cleared to operate in the U.S. interior,
including Sonora, across the border from Arizona.

In the United States, only 14 firms are awaiting permits from the
Mexican government, Hill said.

Teamsters accuse the government of cherry-picking Mexican firms to
skew the results of the imminent experiment.

&quot;You can't take the 151 safest trucks in Mexico and let them drive all
over the United States for a year and then say your entire program is
safe,&quot; Teamsters spokeswoman Leslie Miller said.

Hill says follow-up reviews by the inspector general, plus one
independent technical panel that includes former Arizona Congressman
Jim Kolbe, will assure the results' validity.

Opening the border to trucks was a key part of the North American Free
Trade Agreement inked in 1994. The trucks were supposed to be
delivering international cargo seven years ago. Under the trade pact,
certified Mexican trucks can carry loads anywhere in the United States
but can pick up loads only if they are bound for Mexico. The converse
applies to U.S. trucks.

That was the arrangement before 1982. Since then, Mexican trucks have
operated within a 25-mile commercial zone along the border. There,
they transfer loads to U.S. trucks. Last year, 4.5 million trucks
crossed north over the border, mostly through Texas.

That's the teamsters members saying that.
But the leadership knows better.

The Mexican truckers are a recruiting opportunity like they haven't seen
since Hoffa brought them up from a few hundred thousand to several
million strong.
