*Shirdi Sai's Philosophy in the words of Saibanisaji*

* *

&quot;Your suffering is My suffering and your happiness is My happiness,&quot; Said
Baba, and just as a mother always loves her child, He does not forget the
spirit even for a single moment, for it is the nature of Saihood to be
compassionate.

He trained himself to avoid abusing others, and then He wished that all
might have the serene mind that would follow by living in peace with others.

Thus Baba's compassion embraces all people, and His constant consideration
is for their happiness. He loves people as parents love their children and
He wishes the highest blessedness for them, namely, that they will be able
to pass beyond this ocean of life and death.

Just as rain falls on all vegetation, so Baba's compassion extends equally
to all people. Just as different plants receive particular benefits from the
same rain, so people of different natures and circumstances are blessed in
different ways.

Parents love all their children, but their love is expressed with special
tenderness towards a sick child.

Om Shantih Shantih Shantihi

3. *QUINTESSENCE OF SRI SAIBABA'S PHILOSOPHY:
*(By Late Sri Bharam UmamaheswaraRao)
&quot;Shashi&quot;: shashi ... @yahoo.com&lt;http://f1mail.rediff.com/bn/compose.cgi?login=saibanisa&amp;session_ id=1K1KLKV1jMvA1H4yba7Qgvx521aU&amp;FormName=mail_to_individual&amp;email=shashi ... @yahoo.com&gt;

*29. Is Samsara Really Necessary? *

Sai Baba finally advices us all: A householder is not at all inferior to a
celibate. A Gruhasta who performs his Swadharma and follows a righteous law
is a great person. Sanyasi and Gruhasta both have their own customs,
different from one another. One's customs and one's state of sublimity need
not be compared with the other. Everyone has to get the rewards or
reprimands of one's own actions. Nature has no power to lessen the fruits of
action.

By these Baba's teachings we must know how to conduct over selves in
Samsara. The wise should be cheerful and contended with their lot in life,
as it is the result of Deha Prarabhda.  We should not kick against the
pricks. If wealthy, be humble. Plants bend when they have fruits. But
humility is not towards all; Severity is needed in dealing with the wicked.
But towards Saints be humble and respect them. Spend money in charity,
Dharma – but not extravagantly. The world perishes no doubt, but while it
lasts, wealth is a necessity. Be not being obsessed with the importance of
wealth. Do not be entangled in it. Be liberated and munificent but not
lavish or extravagant. We must get on carefully with our worldly problems.

Pray God always: This Samsara is not mine, but God's. Think thus all the
time when we are awake. We must have consideration for the poor and do not
persecute or tease them. We must always enquire – 'Who am I?'

*Audio CDs from Sai Banisa – Saidarbar - reviews*

*CD – Gruhastalaku Sri Sai Salahaalu*

Manusmruti has laid down some Gruhastsrama dharmas like a 'Gruhasta' should
not eat an item which is not served to the guest.

Bhartruhari has proclaimed 'paropakaram idam sareeram'. Just as plants,

rivers and cows live for others man has to live for others.

In his lecture in the CD, Sai Banisa has presented various illustrations
from Sai Baba's words which speak about a wife's rights and duties, a
mother's love, a husband's role, children's responsibility towards parents
and so on.

For instance the incident in 12th chapter, page 101 proves that a woman
should not forget her parents' home after marriage. Nana Saheb and his wife
were in Shirdi for quite some time. Suddenly they heard the news

that their son was ill at Belapur. Nana Saheb wanted his wife to go but

come back the very next day. But Baba said, 'Go, don't delay. Stay there

for four days. Visit all your relatives and come back at leisure!'

There are many such instances which prove a woman has absolute rights

over the property given by her parents, should continue the task started

by her husband, should pray for her children's safety. The husband also

should look after his wife well, should not take up sanyasa during her

life time, children should repay their parents and the like other words.

Sai Banisa quotes umpteen number of illustrations from Sai Saccharita with
reference to page numbers and chapters where in exists an underlying current
of thought which defines Gruhastasrama dharmas. He has studied Satcharita
and absorbed every word of it in essence. Name anything – he can quote an
example, an anecdote, and an incident and interpret it in terms of that
principle and trace it's origin to Satcharita.

*CD - Kalala lo Sri Sai *

God speaks to us in many ways. Sai Baba is known to speak through our
dreams. Sai Banisa is living example of this miracle. He performs the next
days' duties based on Sai Baba's advice to him the previous night in his
dream.

In the present lecture, he describes vividly what dreams are, how dreams
have found their place in our epics and how Sai Baba has appeared in the
dreams of many in His life time and how Sai Banisa himself had many answers
to his queries and doubts through his dreams.

One should appreciate his analytical knowledge of Sai Satcharita. He doesn't
read it as anybody does. It is a continuous source of inspiration for him;
it is source of knowledge for him; it is a beacon light for him in the path
of righteousness; it is a philosophical guide for him.

It is not a blind belief. He shows facts and figures, he quotes many
examples, illustrations, anecdotes to support and supplement his statement.
Baba would make one wonder whether he was dreaming or it was a reality!

In chapter 29, Baba appeared as Lord Sri Rama to a devotee of Rama during
noon Aarthi. Baba would invite his devotees to His place, through their
dreams. In chapter 30, a Punjabi Brahmin called Ramlal was invited to His
place in his dream. He solves the problems or clarifies doubts of his
devotees through other devotees. Sapatnekar's wife dreamt of a Fakir filling
her empty pot. Baba blessed her through a cowherd woman. He accepts dakshina
as per his wish.

For instance Sai Banisa had a dream early hours of March 9, 1992 in
Visakhapatnam. A well dressed man in suit, boot, in cooling glasses and hat
appeared in his dream. He said, 'You settled your daughter's marriage and
you are offering dowry. Won't you give me rupees five?' Surprisingly, as he
was seated on a bench in the station to leave Visakhapatnam, a man came and
sat beside him. He was the same well dressed man in suit, boot and cooling
glasses, in his dream the previous night. Should he honour his dream and
give him Rs.5? If so, how would he react? He went behind him, dropped a five
rupee note at his feet and told him 'Your money has fallen down.' The man
picked it up walked away a few steps and disappeared.

Sai Banisa has many such hair-raising anecdotes up his sleeve. In one word
Sai Baba is his friend, philosopher and guide. He has a Sai Darbar at his
home made out of rose wood, again as per the instructions of Sai Baba.

His lecture is thought provoking and heart rendering. One longs to get such
dreams and be blessed by Sai Baba!

*CD - Sri Siva Swaroopamlo Sai*

'Siva Rama Krishna Maruthya Namaha' is one of the names of Sai Baba. In his
earlier renderings, Sai Banisa has clearly illustrated how Sai is Siva,
Rama, Krishna and Maruthi.

In the present discourse, Sai Banisa compares Siva Puranam and Guru Geetha
with Satcharita. Siva Puranam deals with who is Guru, what are his
miraculous powers, how to respect Guru etc. Guru Geetha is conversational
style between Parvathi and Siva which high lights the greatness of the Guru.

Sai Banisa proves meticulously, step by step that Sai Baba has all the
qualities defined in a Guru.

For example in Siva Puranam Siva explains that there is no difference
between Him, His Linga and his Murthy. In Satcharita, Sai Baba explains in
chapter 41 that there is no difference between him and his photo.

29th Sloka of Guru Geetha '  Sarva theertha vahagavasya  Samprapnothi phalam
naraha' proclaims that if you drink the padatheertham of Guru, it is as good
as having a holy dip in all holy rivers. In the fourth chapter of Satcharita
Dasaganu plans a trip to Prayaga, confluence of Ganga and Yamuna.

Sai Baba says 'Prayaga is here itself' When he knelt before the feet of Sai
Baba, Ganga, Yamuna gushed out the feet of Sai Baba. Guru is one who drives
out the darkness of ignorance through knowledge. Baba has driven out the
ajnana of Vijayanand in 31st chapter and has liberated his soul.

Thus Sai Banisa proves that Sai Baba is Samartha Sadguru and he will guide
us in the rightful path as 'Sai Sankar.' The musical note of Guru Geetha is
melodious while the speech is motivating and guiding the Sadhaka in
spiritual path.

*5.  SANATANA DHARMA &amp;SHRI SHIRDI SAIBABA.*

* *

*When was the first Gurupoornima celebrated in Shirdi?*

The great good fortune of being the first to formally worship fell to Sri
Noolkar upon a Guru Poornima day.  Sri Noolkar first visited Shirdi in
1909(Sai Satcharitra Chapter 31 &amp; Saipatham Magazine August 2002) and he
passed away in March, 1911. But Sri M. B. Nimbalkar mentioned in his
writings that as per Dr.Gavankar's opinion Noolkar first visited Shirdi in
1908 and therefore first Gurupoornima held in 1908. With the above mentioned
reasons Gurupoornima might have started in Shirdi in 1908 or 1909 or 1910.

Noolkar wrote a letter to his friend Nanasaheb Chandorkar describing first
Gurupoornima celebrations in Shirdi. In that letter he mentioned &quot;As I awoke
on Saturday, I remembered that it was the day of Guru Poornima. We
immediately started preparations for the pooja&quot;. From this letter it reveals
that first Gurupoornima was held on Saturday.

As per Lunar Calendar, Gurupoornima day had fallen as follows.

Year      Month   Date      Week

1908     July       13         Monday

1909     July       3          Saturday

1910     July       22         Friday

As per Noolkar's letter Saturday's Gurupoornima will come only in 1909. So,
we might say in Shirdi first Gurupoornima Celebrations held on Saturday, 3rd
July, 1909.

Noolkar first visited Shirdi in 1909. He was one of the most intimate
devotees of Baba.  Baba would never allow anyone to worship him. He would
not allow any devotee to even garland him. The great good fortune of being
the first to formally worship fell to Sri Noolkar upon a Guru Poornima day.
One day Sri Tatya Saheb Noolkar went to the Dwarakamayi and saluted Baba. As
he did so, Baba pointed to the pillar besides the dhuni and said &quot;You
worship that pillar tomorrow.&quot;  Noolkar could not understand why Baba had
said so. When he returned to the Wada he conveyed Baba's instructions to
Shama and asked him as to what Baba's intentions were in ordering him thus.
Even Shama could not understand why Baba had asked them to worship the
pillar next day. He went to the Dwarakamayi to inquire of Baba but Baba
merely reiterated his earlier instructions. Later Baba repeated the same
instructions to Tatya Kote Patil and Dada Kelkar too. The next day happened
to be a Saturday. As Noolkar awoke from sleep he suddenly remembered that it
was Guru Poornima. He conveyed this to Shama and the other devotees. They
got the almanac to check and it was confirmed that it was indeed so. That
day was Guru Poornima. They now understood the meaning of Baba's words when
he told them to worship the pillar. They were all very happy that Baba had
finally permitted them to worship him. They all went to the Dwarakamayi and
begged Baba to allow them to perform the worship of their guru. Baba merely
told them again to worship the pillar. &quot;Oh our God! Why should we worship
the pillar when we have you, a God, in front of us? We will worship only
you.&quot; Baba did not agree to be worshipped by the devotees. The devotees
stuck firmly to their resolve. At last Baba had to acquiesce to the wishes
of his devotees and allow them to worship him. Baba always surrenders to the
feelings of love and faith of his devotee. He said, &quot;All right&quot; at last, and
the happiness of his devotees knew no, bounds.

They immediately started preparing for the worship of the Guru. They
decided to worship Baba after he returned from his round of alms and
informed him thus. Baba, with utmost kindness, not only agreed but also
permitted them to worship him using the sixteen articles of formal worship.
Baba sent word to Radhakrishna Ayi and Dada Kelkar. She sent the various
ingredients used in worship to the dwarakamayi and Dada Kelkar also reached
the Dwarakamayi with the various articles used in worship. All the devotees
present did congregational worship of Baba. Baba returned all the dakshina
offered to him back to the devotees. Arati was offered after the worship.
Thus the first Guru Poornima worship was performed at Shirdi.

Sri Tatya Saheb Noolkar wrote a brief note to his friend Chandorkar about
the first celebrations of Guru Pooja during Guru Poornima, as Chandorkar was
not present at Shirdi at that time. This letter was published in Sai Leela
magazine but unfortunately the date was not mentioned. This is a free
translation of that letter.

&quot;As I awoke on Saturday, I remembered that it was the day of Guru Poornima.
We immediately started preparations for the pooja. Baba had permitted us to
worship him after he returned from his round of alms. He did not object and
kept silent when we worshipped him with the sixteen ways of worship. He
returned all the dakshina given to him back to the devotees after the
worship was over. We sent word to Radhakrishna Ayi and Dada Kelkar that
worship of Baba and arati were being done in the dwarakamayi. Ayi sent
various articles of pooja. Dade Kelkar too came with his pooja articles and
participated in the pooja.&quot;

As per Tatyasaheb Noolkar's Letter Saturday's Gurupoornima had fallen in the
year 1909. Therefore the First Gurupoornima Celebrations could have been
started on Saturday, 3rd July, 1909.

NEW DELHI, INDIA, July 1, 2007: The ban on carrying coconuts inside Mumbai's
famed Siddhivinayaka temple has been lifted. However, one can now expect the
police to screen the coconuts at the temple entrance. Maharashtra Home
Minister R. R .Patil announced on Thursday that the ban, imposed a few days
ago because of security reasons, has been lifted. Devotees can carry
coconuts as offerings to Lord Ganesha, but the coconuts will be manually
checked before being let in. The ban on offerings of flower garlands too has
been lifted in the temple. Frisking machines, however, are going to be
installed as a precautionary measure.

6. DEVOTEES EXPERIENCES:

geeta_ve ... @yahoo.com

Thu, July 5, 2007 7:40 pm

SaiRam,

A miracle happened on a holiday that I took with my

family.  My sister and I were in the hotel room with the door slightly ajar
as the children were in and out.  My sister was sleeping soundly while I was
watching the TV.  Suddenly, I saw a man creep into the room and checking my
handbag for cash and

valuables. I was shocked and started shouting at him.  He was completely
taken aback and ran away after dropping my handbag!  The Shirdi Sai photo
that I put in the bag saved me from losing all my valuables. It was Baba
that made the thief drop my handbag instead of taking it with him!

Thank You Baba and koti pranams to You.

Om Sai Ram! I am very much impressed by reading the experiences of my fellow
Sai bhakth. I would like to share mine too. I have been working in some junk
field (software) for past 12 years and recently I decided to change my field
to dotnet. I prayed Saibaba and submitted my resume (fake experience). I was
successful with phone interview and went for personal interview. But I was
not selected for that position. It was a contract to hire position. I was
little sad, but I have full confidence that Baba will show me the better
one. That is TRUE. By HIS holy grace I was selected for permanent position
in some big company. I have to start my new job from 28th. I am sure that
Baba will definitely take care of these devotees. We need to have Sradhha
and Saburi. Hope we all will develop those important qualities and reach his
HIS holy feet one day.

Om Sai Ram!

*The story of the Monkey*

Construction of a temple was on outside a town. Near the site, a huge wooden
log was being split. At the lunch, the workers fixed a wedge between the
split wood and went to dine. A monkey had been watching the activities of
the workers since morning. When the workers were away, the monkey descended
from the tree and began to meddle with that log of wood. During the play, he
saw the wedge and began to withdraw it. But he forgot that his tail was
hanging between the split ends of the log. As soon as the wedge was out, the
split ends closed squeezing the tail of the monkey. The monkey tried hard to
get himself free but in vain. No help was available nearby. By the time, the
workers returned from their lunch, the monkey had died.

Sun, July 8, 2007 8:01 am

Sai Ram. Let us continue with the Spiritual Gems from Sri Sai Satcharitra,
Chapter

24. Sai Ram.

SSS: Generally, all people like wit and humor, but they do not like that
jokes

should be cut at their expense. But Baba's method was peculiar; when it was

accompanied with gestures, it was very interesting and instructive, and the

people, therefore, did not mind, if they were held up to the ridicule.
Hemadpant

gives his own instance below.

SSG: Sai Ram. It is our ego that makes us like or dislike something. It is
also

our ego which makes us enjoy the discomfiture of others (it has something to
do

with our desire to dominate others for our own pleasures. Sai Ram.).
However, in

the presence of our Sadguru Sai, our egos get refined and learn the lessons
from

the jokes or humor. That is the effect of Sadguru and of course the result
of our

merits of this birth or past lives. Sai Ram.

SSS: Chanak-Leela

In Shirdi, bazaar was held every Sunday, and people from the neighboring
villages

came there, erected booths and stalls on the street, and sold their wares
and

commodities. Every noon, the Dwarakamayi was crowded more or less; but on
Sunday, it was crowded to suffocation. On one such Sunday, Hemadpant sat in
front of Baba, shampooing His Legs and muttering God's name. Shama was on
Baba's left, Vamanrao to His right - Shriman Booty and Kakasaheb Dixit and
others were also present there. Then Shama laughed and said to Annasaheb -
&quot;See that some grains seem to have stuck to the sleeve of your coat&quot;. So
saying he touched the sleeve and found that there were some grains.
Hemadpant straightened his left fore-arm to see what the matter was, when to
the surprise of all, some grains of gram come rolling down and were picked
up by the people who were sitting there.

This incident furnished a subject matter for joke. Everybody present began
to

wonder and said something or other as to how the grains found their way into
the

sleeve of the coat and lodged there so long. Hemadpant also could not guess
how

they found an entrance and stayed there. When nobody could give any
satisfactory

explanation in this matter, and everybody was wondering about this mystery,
Baba

said as follows: -

Baba - &quot;This fellow (Annasaheb) has got the bad habit of eating alone.
Today is a

bazaar-day and he was here chewing grams. I know his habit and these grams
are a

proof of it. What wonder is there is this matter?&quot;

Hemadpant - &quot;Baba, I never know of eating things alone; then why do you
thrust

this bad habit on me? I have never yet seen Shirdi bazaar. I never went to
the

bazaar today, then how could I buy grams, and how could I eat them if I had
not

bought them? I never eat anything unless I share it with others present near
me&quot;.

Baba - &quot;It is true that you give to the persons present; but if none be
near-by,

what could you or I do but do you remember Me before eating? Am I not always
with

you? Then do you offer Me anything before you eat?&quot;

SSG: Sai Ram. Sai Sadguru is teaching Shri Hemadpant and us a very
valuable

spiritual lesson. Recall what Shri Hemadpant was doing above. &quot;On one such
Sunday,

Hemadpant sat in front of Baba, shampooing His Legs and muttering God's
name.&quot;

Since Shri Hemadpant was doing a good seva, Sai wanted to reward him by
teaching

him a good spiritual lesson. Also, while Shri Hemadpant was shampooing Sai's
legs,

he was uttering God's name and Baba wanted to confirm that He was One with
all the

Gods, including the name of the God whom Hemadpant was remembering. Sai Ram.

We will continue with this chapter in the coming weeks. Sai Ram.

Pure heart is ----

Pure heart is when you don't think badly about anyone. Pure heart is
when you don't let jealousy, greed, anger or lust be in your heart or
mind. Pure heart is when you forgive and forget, the bad behavior of
people who are against you .Pure heart is when you believe that you
will do your good karma no matter how hard it is for you cos in the
end it is Baba who is with u and what ever the outcome will be -it
will be for your best. Pure heart is when instead of arguing with
someone or gossiping about someone, you choose to be quiet. Arguing
will just give rise to anger and ego which will destroy our peace of
mind .And gossiping about someone is like pointing four fingers at
yourself when you point 1 finger towards someone else, after all we
are not perfect so we are not in a position to comment or judge about
other people's karma. Pure heart is when you try your level best not
to have ego. Pure heart is where love, peace of mind and SAI lives.

Hi SaiDarbar Team,

I am very happy with this magazine. Every Thursday I am receiving the
e-magazine. After reading to that book some of incidents really matching to
some situations in my life. Every Thursday if I receive magazine means I
feel that is good sign from Sai. Telugu section in the magazine is also very
nice. I really appreciate your work. Thanks who are there back of this to be
successful.

I feel always He (Sai) is with me and what every position I have today is
because of him. I strongly believe on Baba from my child hood. I feel he is
mine and with me always.

From,

Sai Devotee.
