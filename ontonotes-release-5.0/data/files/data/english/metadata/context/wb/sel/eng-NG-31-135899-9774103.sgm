It is absolutely amazing what you can find when plundering through boxes of keepsakes, antiques and stuff you just flat refused to part with for whatever reason.  And here is what I found tonight as I plundered through a box I've had for about 20 years... Scans of a FOUR PAGE AD from Ketek showing photos, info and a price list for this excellent piece of equipment! :

If anyone has one of these for the C=64/C=64C and is willing to part with it... I'd love to relieve you of the burden of it!   &lt;G&gt;

PAGE TWO (Back) :

PAGE THREE (Price List) :

I can provide larger, clearer scans of these if anyone would like to have them.

Thanks for the scans of those.  Now I have more information on
the Keteks that are in storage.  :-)
