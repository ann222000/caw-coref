How about a little bit more info: is this a board set that was
previously working, and suddenly started showing problems,or are you
constructing a boardset from Ebay boards?
Do you have a know good ROM board to swap in? Same question for the
video board. Have you checked the potential [voltages] at the RAM
chips? Have you considered/tried 4164 RAM?  Have you inspected the ROM-
Video board cable, and are you prepared to replace it if needed? Did
you try cleaning the pins the ROM cable plugs into [if this helps, you
should replace the receptical and ROM cable] Which ROM  chips is
indicated to be bad? Did you reseat it? Did it help, and if so did you
replace the socket it plugs into? Have you ordered new ROM chips?

I could go on, but first, lets hear some more info...
