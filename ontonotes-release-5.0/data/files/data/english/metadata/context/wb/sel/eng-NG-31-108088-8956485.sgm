About the only dirt bike content I can think of is that XP includes a
little picture of an mx bike in mid jump that you can choose as your
login meme, there, now that's done.

On to the OT stuff. I know some of youse guys make a living doing this
stuff, so if you could just point me in the right direction I'd
appreciate it.

I've become the de facto system administrator at the company I work
for, and I need some help. The main application we run is a POS system
that uses a central database and all our computers are treated as
terminals by the system--that part is out of my hands. I know that
database is backed up nightly. However, the non-POS usage--employee
records, company manuals, sales forecasts and budgets, as well as most
vendor specific customer data reside on the individual PCs used by our
managers and higher level sales staff--about a dozen or so.

The 2 biggest things I'm trying to solve right now are:

1) how to efficiently migrate all the data and file organization from
an old PC to a new PC and make sure all old email, secret love notes,
weird vendor supplied ordering systems with customer data etc. etc.
etc. make it over to the new PC.

2) how to make sure everything (not including the POS database crap
that is not stored on local PC's) is backed up reasonably securely.

If we were running OS X I'd be done. To solve 1) every OS X Mac has a
firewire port, every firewire Mac can be put into target mode which
allows the hard disk to act as an external drive, you connect the
target mode old Mac to the new Mac, copy the Home folder (er,
directory :) and you're done. Or, use a free cloner to simply
duplicate the target drive disk onto the new Mac. Or, use the built-in
Migration Assistant to do it for you.

For 2) I'd get a copy of Retrospect Workgroup, a couple of 750 GB hard
drives, and set the schedule. But we don't use OS X at work...

As far as I can tell, we're all running XP service pack 2, and
everybody is networked on a 100Mbit ethernet system. NOTHING is backed
up currently. One of my salesmen is using a decrepit Celeron 800MHz
system, while a brand new P4/3.2GHz is sitting unused in the
conference room. I've been trying to get his data onto the new
computer and it's just not going. I can't believe there isn't a clean
simple way to do this, after all, people get new PC's all the time.
How DO you migrate everything over? I've run into &quot;Can't do that&quot;
dialogs, etc. when just trying to copy folders manually. There's crap
(i.e. files and folders) EVERYWHERE. I have no idea even if I could do
that whether I'd found everything.

Today I tried using DriveImage XML, but it creates a disk image, and
as near as I can tell you have to put the image onto one partition and
then restore it onto a different partition, and I don't think I can
repartition the new drive without erasing everything and starting
over, a daunting proposition to say the least. And I suspect it
wouldn't let me restore the image to the boot partition, which means
I'd need to create 3 partitions, and from past experience I've found
it's a mistake to have multiple partitions on the primary local disk.

And what software do you recommend for backing up a workgroup of less
than 20 PC's? I'm thinking of a couple of external HD's, rotated
weekly, with both archives and duplicates.

Hopefully I'm just missing something simple here. I can't believe Dell
(where we've purchased most of our newer PC's) doesn't include some
thing to quickly grab all your old data and stuff it into the new
system. Maybe they do :)

Thanks for any help.

Mr. Gates doesn't include any easy way to transfer all of your
files and programs from one PC to another because they know that by
the time you're ready to do that XP will have everything so screwed up
you'll want a fresh format and re-install anyway! At least that's what
I tell everyone.

I'm told it *can* be done, but if you have a lot of crap on your
machine it's actually faster and less of a hassle to just start over.
XP isn't designed to *transfer* to new PCs, and as a result neither is
most of the XP software.

That said, you *should* be able to create a temp folder, copy all
of the storage file folders into it, then burn it to disc and transfer
all of his stored files that way... if you take the folders you'll be
able to restore some semblence of his previous directory tree.

This page may help with the email folders and such:

http://www.pchell.com/support/backupoe.shtml

And likewise, you can find info for his browser &quot;bookmarks&quot; and
such by using google.

Maybe someone else here can offer a better solution, but if it were
me I'd just start fresh on the new system and try to transfer as much
of my existing data as possible after I have the staple software (XP,
Outlook, Firefox, Agent, Office, etc.) already installed. This way
it's just a matter of finding the existing files, and dropping them
into the same location[s] on the new system.

As for backing up the various office PCs, I'll defer to others whom
I'm sure have more experience in that regard.

XP uses the file and transfer settings wizard, it works. We use it for
backup and to bring up new machines. It keeps almost everything, I
have yet to get one complaint about it. You need to pre install the
apps on the new machines first.

Start - programs - accessories - system tools - file and transfer
settings wizard

There is the already mentioned transfer wizard, but what I do is:

- Look for PST files, copy those to the new computer. These are where
the love messages are stored by outlook.

- There is a folder on root... er I mean, C:\, called &quot;documents and
settings&quot;, inside it, you will find folders named after the username.
Inside each individual folder, there are the folders for the start
menu, desktop, bookmarks and general application info particular to
that user. The documents folder which is the default folder for excel,
word, is also there. You will need to set the folder options to reveal
hidden and system folders and files if you want to see everything. The
PST file is somewhere in here by default.

- Now you'll have to look for private folders, created by the users.
This is the most difficult part...

On the new machine, you must have windows, office pack, outlook and
all the software the user might need already installed. Then:

- Open outlook and go file-&gt;open-&gt;outlook data file and select the pst
file(s) you saved.
- Open the &quot;documents and settings&quot; folder on the new machine for the
user you are copying.  Yes, you will have to create it before, and try
to append the documents folder contents, the favorites, desktop... Be
careful! Don't mess with the start menu folder and be very careful for
what you are doing do the &quot;application data&quot; folder!
- Then there is the copying of the private data, from the particular
applications that user might need...

Lots of work!

re: backup. Convince your boss you need a server. Buy a server with
fast and big sata disks, plenty of ram memory, fast processor and a
DVD writer. Create shared folders on it and convince users to store
their critical and important data on the shared folders. You can set
it up in a way that each user has access only to theirs particular
folder and nobody else or you can create a big comunitary folder. From
time to time, burn the data on DVDs.

Another options is there is a nice software we use is called
&quot;AutoMate&quot;, do lots of things. You can set your network so every
computer could share the C:\ as C$ only to a specific user, the
administrator, or you can share the folder where user needs backup...
On the backup computer, you will run AutoMate and program it (it is
very easy and intuitive) to scan all the computers and copy their data
into a local folder and you can burn DVDs later.

Remember users are very picky about this stuff. None of these other
methods have mentioned keeping items like screensavers and IE
bookmarks/favorites. This is the kind of thing that users freak out
about when they lose them. They EXPECT this to be a hole in one, no
problems issue.

But it isn't.

Why would you want to go to  the huge amount of effort to do all the
manual steps when you can use this utility to do it for you?

Goood luck convincing users to save documents on the shared server.
They are so used to dropping items on the desktop. We found unless you
take away their ability to stote items on their local machine, they
will do so. Using something like SBS with roaming profiles can help
solve this but not w/out a lot of expense, time and hassle. Even then,
if they leave Outlook open, it won't back it up. Open PST files are
very hard to incorporate into backup schemes.

Thanks for the tips, Tiago. The server idea is probably beyond what we

handled that way. I'm just looking for a way to automate backups. I'll

If all goes well the only thing you'll have to manually enter are the
passwords for items like email. Just remember to have the apps
installed on the new machine before you begin. You'll be amazed at how
well it works. I've migrated 2 machines for my mother in law and
absolutley no issues. I wish they had this 10 years ago.

Also - I use a WD ext 160GB drive to do the backups to. - Old machine
data to ext drive, new machine pulls that data from ext drive. Then
you don't waste any HD space on the local boxes.

Well, I would just hook the old PC hard drive to the new PC as a
slave.  All the data is there and you have another drive to use for
back-ups.

&gt;On to the OT stuff. I know some of youse guys make a living doing this
&gt;stuff, so if you could just point me in the right direction I'd
&gt;appreciate it.

&gt;I've become the de facto system administrator at the company I work
&gt;for, and I need some help. The main application we run is a POS system
&gt;that uses a central database and all our computers are treated as
&gt;terminals by the system--that part is out of my hands. I know that
&gt;database is backed up nightly. However, the non-POS usage--employee
&gt;records, company manuals, sales forecasts and budgets, as well as most
&gt;vendor specific customer data reside on the individual PCs used by our
&gt;managers and higher level sales staff--about a dozen or so.

&gt;The 2 biggest things I'm trying to solve right now are:

&gt;1) how to efficiently migrate all the data and file organization from
&gt;an old PC to a new PC and make sure all old email, secret love notes,
&gt;weird vendor supplied ordering systems with customer data etc. etc.
&gt;etc. make it over to the new PC.

&gt;2) how to make sure everything (not including the POS database crap
&gt;that is not stored on local PC's) is backed up reasonably securely.

&gt;If we were running OS X I'd be done. To solve 1) every OS X Mac has a
&gt;firewire port, every firewire Mac can be put into target mode which
&gt;allows the hard disk to act as an external drive, you connect the
&gt;target mode old Mac to the new Mac, copy the Home folder (er,
&gt;directory :) and you're done. Or, use a free cloner to simply
&gt;duplicate the target drive disk onto the new Mac. Or, use the built-in
&gt;Migration Assistant to do it for you.

&gt;For 2) I'd get a copy of Retrospect Workgroup, a couple of 750 GB hard
&gt;drives, and set the schedule. But we don't use OS X at work...

&gt;As far as I can tell, we're all running XP service pack 2, and
&gt;everybody is networked on a 100Mbit ethernet system. NOTHING is backed
&gt;up currently. One of my salesmen is using a decrepit Celeron 800MHz
&gt;system, while a brand new P4/3.2GHz is sitting unused in the
&gt;conference room. I've been trying to get his data onto the new
&gt;computer and it's just not going. I can't believe there isn't a clean
&gt;simple way to do this, after all, people get new PC's all the time.
&gt;How DO you migrate everything over? I've run into &quot;Can't do that&quot;
&gt;dialogs, etc. when just trying to copy folders manually. There's crap
&gt;(i.e. files and folders) EVERYWHERE. I have no idea even if I could do
&gt;that whether I'd found everything.

&gt;Today I tried using DriveImage XML, but it creates a disk image, and
&gt;as near as I can tell you have to put the image onto one partition and
&gt;then restore it onto a different partition, and I don't think I can
&gt;repartition the new drive without erasing everything and starting
&gt;over, a daunting proposition to say the least. And I suspect it
&gt;wouldn't let me restore the image to the boot partition, which means
&gt;I'd need to create 3 partitions, and from past experience I've found
&gt;it's a mistake to have multiple partitions on the primary local disk.

&gt;And what software do you recommend for backing up a workgroup of less
&gt;than 20 PC's? I'm thinking of a couple of external HD's, rotated
&gt;weekly, with both archives and duplicates.

&gt;Hopefully I'm just missing something simple here. I can't believe Dell
&gt;(where we've purchased most of our newer PC's) doesn't include some
&gt;thing to quickly grab all your old data and stuff it into the new
&gt;system. Maybe they do :)

&gt;Thanks for any help.

Oh yeah, sorry Charles, I forgot about that new XP feature (I've
never used it). But I was also thinking about moving the entire OS and
all installed software -- intact -- to the new computer... and I don't
think even the wizard could pull that one off. Any time you change
MB/CPU with Windoze OS you pretty much have to reformat and start
over. But that's not always terrible, because you're often ready for a
larger, or more modern HD by then anyway. Like a programmer buddy of
mine and I were discussing recently though, it's a shame Microsoft
doesn't make switching to a new computer more effortless... we're both
convinced that there's no reason why they couldn't if they wanted to.
I mean, that file and transfer settings wizard is certainly an
improvement over the direct cable connection of Win95, but they could
make things even better if they wanted to.

Anyway, my apologies for overlooking the wizard thing... thanks
Sean!

If you are replacing their pcs with new ones and if you don't care
about the old pc not having a hard drive in it... you can physically
put the old hard drive in the new computer as a second drive and leave
it there... I do that quite often.

You can also hang ithe old drive in there temproarily while you
manually move files from one drive to the other with drag and drop.
Then put the old drive back in the old computer and do whatever you
wish with it.

It can sometimes be a real challenge to get user's data moved...
expecially when you have to do it in pieces and the user is clueless
what they need.

Ghost can be used to make an exact image of the drive. If you have
room ro store them somewhere (even on the drive of the new pc), you
can go in anytime and selectively pull out any files that you happened
to miss the first time around.

I have met the enemy, and he is windoze.

File and Settings Transfer Wizard was a sham. I wasted a huge amount
of time today trying to get it to work, and eventually I discovered
that the ONLY way it will work is if you have a removable drive, i.e.
a floppy disk or a cdr (a FRREAKIN' FLOPPY DISK!!!, are you JOKING?).
The old computer in this case has no such drive.

&lt; http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457074.aspx &gt;

Now despite the fact that Mr. Wizard asks you if the old and new
computers are NETWORKED it STILL won't transfer the so-called files
and settings without a sneaker-netted floppy disk popped into the old
one and then the new. Un f-ing believable. I've got a 100Mbps ethernet
connection, and it won't transfer the files and settings over the
network UNLESS I FIRST PUT IN A 3.5&quot; FLOPPY DISK.

So, Mr. Wizard let me go through all the motions of collecting the
bits of fluff it calls settings (&quot;wallpaper, colors, sounds, and the
location of the taskbar&quot; oh boy, like I'm really worried about that)
and then told me the new computer couldn't FIND my files and settings
it had so laboriously collected.

feh.

I spent a long time trying to figure out why it wouldn't do what it
promised, finally realizing it wanted a floppy disk. I don't think you
could BUY one if you really wanted to. Seen one in Best Buy recently?

I'm now part way through just manually selecting groups of files and
copying them onto the new drive via ethernet, but because Mr. Gates is
so worried about me screwing up his lovely hacked up OS, I can't put
them where they belong from my network connection. Instead, all the
files from &quot;My Documents&quot; have to go into C:\goes in my docs\ that I
had to create because it won't let me copy them directly into C:\My
Documents\ and then I trot over to the new computer, open up &quot;goes in
my docs&quot; and drag them into &quot;My Documents&quot; and then drag the empty
&quot;put in my docs&quot; folder to the trash, er, recycle bin.

etc., etc., etc.

The iTunes music software was a piece of cake (thankfully, Apple knows
how to create windows apps better than Microsoft). Now, I've got to
tackle email and Andersen's crappy proprietary files. Then get back to
work :)

I went to an interesting presentation the other day, speaking of
Microsoft's ineptitude, by Joel Spolsky of Fog City Software. He's an
interesting speaker, and writer, and at one time was one of the chief
developers at Microsoft in charge of Excel. That's got to be a fun
thing to have on your resume, isn't it?

http://www.joelonsoftware.com/

Anyway, he talked about how about 10 years ago or so (my estimate) the
team working on MS Project were asked to &quot;eat their own dog food&quot;--use
Project to schedule the development of Project itself, and
specifically to figure out the ship date. According to Spolsky, they
spent days and days and days, finally came up with a printout about 63
pages long, that predicted the ship date would be March of 2018...

Charles,

I'm surprised el scrapo hasn't glommed onto this.  Maybe he is letting
nature ruyn its course and then schedule a professional visit from the
Tarheel State to bail out the Golden State.

If you have internet cards in both machines, why not use a cross-over cable
and run them as server client or master slave or what ever it is.  Older
cards at 10mbits still take nearly an hour to move hundreds of megabytes.

Your screwed, try the 3x5 card suggestion, Scrape will probably want to go
riding when he gets to your site.

I have no idea what your issues are but it works flawlessly for us.
And we do it probably once a month. And we use it to back up machines
weekly. I do you an external drive though. Is one of the machines
Windows 2000 or 98 or something? They both have to be XP or better.

I've been watching this thread quietly, since I need to migrate a bunch of
files from my laptop to this new desktop. My dad handed me one of these and
said it works great.

There's some software that comes with it. Haven't tried it yet.

As an aside, this new desktop was salvaged from a burned out house. A spark
off the grinding wheel took down the guy's whole house - mostly smoke damage
really. I'd love to figure out how to get the previous owner's name off of
the user list. Poor guy is in assisted living now - really sad - gifted

Well, that's the kicker. You have to have a writable, removable,
locally attached drive to use Files &amp; Settings Wizard. It doesn't warn
you about that though, other to say it won't work after you've ground
through all the data.

Most of our computers have no floppy drive, a cd read only drive, and
we have no external hard drives.

Floppy disk, cdr/w, dvdr/w or external hd. They won't allow you to
just say put er there on the network.

I imagine Dean's USB 2.0 cable would work, but that would mean the 2
computers have to be sitting next to each other...

They're NETWORKED in 2 different buildings...grrrrr

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; About the only dirt bike content I can think of is that XP includes a
&gt; little picture of an mx bike in mid jump that you can choose as your
&gt; login meme, there, now that's done.

&gt; On to the OT stuff. I know some of youse guys make a living doing this
&gt; stuff, so if you could just point me in the right direction I'd
&gt; appreciate it.

&gt; I've become the de facto system administrator at the company I work
&gt; for, and I need some help. The main application we run is a POS system
&gt; that uses a central database and all our computers are treated as
&gt; terminals by the system--that part is out of my hands. I know that
&gt; database is backed up nightly. However, the non-POS usage--employee
&gt; records, company manuals, sales forecasts and budgets, as well as most
&gt; vendor specific customer data reside on the individual PCs used by our
&gt; managers and higher level sales staff--about a dozen or so.

&gt; The 2 biggest things I'm trying to solve right now are:

&gt; 1) how to efficiently migrate all the data and file organization from
&gt; an old PC to a new PC and make sure all old email, secret love notes,
&gt; weird vendor supplied ordering systems with customer data etc. etc.
&gt; etc. make it over to the new PC.

&gt; 2) how to make sure everything (not including the POS database crap
&gt; that is not stored on local PC's) is backed up reasonably securely.

&gt; If we were running OS X I'd be done. To solve 1) every OS X Mac has a
&gt; firewire port, every firewire Mac can be put into target mode which
&gt; allows the hard disk to act as an external drive, you connect the
&gt; target mode old Mac to the new Mac, copy the Home folder (er,
&gt; directory :) and you're done. Or, use a free cloner to simply
&gt; duplicate the target drive disk onto the new Mac. Or, use the built-in
&gt; Migration Assistant to do it for you.

&gt; For 2) I'd get a copy of Retrospect Workgroup, a couple of 750 GB hard
&gt; drives, and set the schedule. But we don't use OS X at work...

&gt; As far as I can tell, we're all running XP service pack 2, and
&gt; everybody is networked on a 100Mbit ethernet system. NOTHING is backed
&gt; up currently. One of my salesmen is using a decrepit Celeron 800MHz
&gt; system, while a brand new P4/3.2GHz is sitting unused in the
&gt; conference room. I've been trying to get his data onto the new
&gt; computer and it's just not going. I can't believe there isn't a clean
&gt; simple way to do this, after all, people get new PC's all the time.
&gt; How DO you migrate everything over? I've run into &quot;Can't do that&quot;
&gt; dialogs, etc. when just trying to copy folders manually. There's crap
&gt; (i.e. files and folders) EVERYWHERE. I have no idea even if I could do
&gt; that whether I'd found everything.

&gt; Today I tried using DriveImage XML, but it creates a disk image, and
&gt; as near as I can tell you have to put the image onto one partition and
&gt; then restore it onto a different partition, and I don't think I can
&gt; repartition the new drive without erasing everything and starting
&gt; over, a daunting proposition to say the least. And I suspect it
&gt; wouldn't let me restore the image to the boot partition, which means
&gt; I'd need to create 3 partitions, and from past experience I've found
&gt; it's a mistake to have multiple partitions on the primary local disk.

&gt; And what software do you recommend for backing up a workgroup of less
&gt; than 20 PC's? I'm thinking of a couple of external HD's, rotated
&gt; weekly, with both archives and duplicates.

&gt; Hopefully I'm just missing something simple here. I can't believe Dell
&gt; (where we've purchased most of our newer PC's) doesn't include some
&gt; thing to quickly grab all your old data and stuff it into the new
&gt; system. Maybe they do :)

&gt; Thanks for any help.

We also used a transfer cable - USB - back to back to machines. But
that doesn't help much if they are in different buildings. This is
best for when one user upgrades to or gets a new machine. It does
support network transfer but we have never tried it.The drive we use
is cheap:

Thanks for the offer. I got it running on the new system today! I was
methodical in transferring over the files via the network, but what
had me most stumped was that the new system had the Application Data
folder marked Hidden, and the folder viewing preferences were NOT set
to view hidden folders...

Which meant all the most important stuff, like email files, browser
bookmarks, passwords etc that I found and copied over had no place to
go. I discovered the trick of using &quot;%appdata%&quot; in the little command
line &quot;Run________&quot; window, and that found the folder, I changed its
permissions and that was the last straw holding me back.

I think the only thing that didn't migrate over was the google desktop
index, but by the end of the day that had re-indexed everything in the
background.

Got the network IP address changed, changed the user name, all the
database application stuff reinstalled to reflect the changes, and all
is well in windoze world.

Thanks everyone for putting up with my pain...one more to go, I'm
waiting until next week when the user is away.

Now I can focus on backup software. I'll look into AutoMate--anything
else?

Ahhh. I get it. We always had that ext drive so I never thought about
the removeable drive issue.

Machines don't even have floppies anymore! If you do get an ext drive
you'll find it works really well. And really handy for a lot of stuff.

Hi john

I ordered and got one of those USB HD thingees you pointed out.  For now
though, I'm struggling to find all the USB DOS drivers, Iomega no longer
provides &quot;guest.exe&quot; along with some others.

Do you have a set up that enables you to get to the native HD features like
fdisk?

it should have come with win 98 drivers???
win 98 still acknowledges DOS exist, right?

what I have done in the past is to format the drives ahead of time and
assign them drive letter F:\  or some other drive letter that is not likely
to be used on host systems. FAT 32 or NFTS according to newness of host
systems

this makes it easier for the host system to wake up when it see's a USB
device hooking up to it.

it's been a while since i've DOS'ed about but here's a link that might help

OK, things were a bit full in there. (I leave email on the server for
7 days before it's yanked.)

Btw, my new provider doesn't allow attachments larger than about 1
meg, so if you wanna send anything larger than that you'd have to
check the &quot;break apart messages larger than...&quot; box in your email
program's account properties. Then my provider will receive the email
is segments and automagically reconnect them afterwards. I think the
default is &quot;...larger than 60kb,&quot; but you could turn that up to like
900kb and still be safe. If it's too much hassle though, don't worry
about it.
