http://www.personal-bankruptcy-chapters-7-13-filing-laws.com/new_bank...

Among other highlights of the soon-to-be-passed &quot;Bankruptcy
Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2003&quot; are:

- Under proposed new bankruptcy laws, chapter 7 is prohibited for
any individual earning more than $100 per month disposable income
(determined by the IRS means test) if debts owed total less than
$24,000.

- Under proposed new bankruptcy laws, chapter 7 is prohibited for
any individual earning more than $166 per month disposable income
(determined by the IRS means test) if debts owed total $24,000 or
more. Current laws allow employed debtors to file chapter 7 without
income restrictions.

- Chapter 13 debtors shall be restricted to monthly living allowances
(under new bankruptcy laws) mandated by the IRS, regardless of
individual circumstance, upon the same quasi-criminal standard used
when prosecuting and collecting unpaid taxes (the &quot;means test&quot; under
IRS &quot;National Standards and Local Standards, Internal Revenue
Service&quot;). Under current laws, a debtor's financial means is
determined on a case by case basis.

- Under proposed new bankruptcy laws, if the value of collateral is
less than debt owed, debtors must pay the higher amount to retain
property. Current laws allow debtors to choose the lower amount -
&quot;cram-down&quot; to actual collateral value - under Chapter 13.

- Under proposed new bankruptcy laws for chapter 13, debtors
shall live under court supervision with all disposable income above
the IRS means test applied to the full payment of all debts for a
period of 5 years, or until paid in full.

- Under proposed new bankruptcy laws, all Chapter 7 debtors
presumptively file in &quot;bad faith,&quot; with the burden placed upon
debtors to disprove presumptions in accordance with the Federal
Rules of Evidence. This amendment effectively creates a
rebuttable presumption of &quot;guilt until proven innocent&quot; with
criminal punishment available in some circumstances.

I guess this qualifies as &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot;, or maybe
&quot;tough love&quot; in the worst U.S. economy in thirty years.

Oh, and Bush is also &quot;reforming&quot; overtime laws and eliminating
the 40-hour work week.

This allows the United States to be ruled by corporate America.

What about including a provision in that bill that makes it illegal for
a creditor to issue credit to anyone who is in debt more than 25% of
their annual income? Banks know full well how much debt a potential
creditor carries, yet they still make highly risky loans to people who
are already carrying more debt than they can effectively handle. That
ought to be illegal.

I know this from personal experience. I carry a huge amount of credit
card debt. Although I am steadily reducing my credit card debt, I still
get credit card companies who offer to lend me far more money than they
know I can repay painlessly. For example, my largest credit card balance
is only about $2,000 below the max on that card. The issuer of that card
told me they will allow me to have a lower interest rate provided I do
not use their credit card at all until the balance is paid off. That's
reasonable to me and I have been meeting my end of that deal, yet every
week this same credit card company sends me blank checks to borrow more
money &quot;up to $5,000&quot; or some limit way beyond what we have previously
agreed to in order to entise me to break my promise. I shred those
checks. That ought to be illegal for them to do that. If I am not
supposed to use their credit card, they have no business soliciting me
to use it.

Two different responsibilies between two different pairs of parties. The
borrower has the responsibility to pay back what he agreed to pay back and
not borrow above his means. The creditor has the responsibility to maximize

This is only true if bankruptcy protections are strong, allowing
defaulting debtors relief. Otherwise, the shareholders have no claim,
which--barring gross negligence or criminality--they don't really
anyway, since boards have no problem showing due diligence. IOW, giant
corporations are immune. And they know it, whether you do or not.

&gt; That doesn't and shouldn't exonerate the borrower's failure to
&gt; exercise willpower and judgement in charging more on his cards than
&gt; he can afford.

Exonerate? The new bankruptcy &quot;protections&quot; are tantamount to criminal
proceedings minus the assumption of innocence; they are without a doubt
designed to crush the weakest at their weakest moment for their
&quot;failure to exercise willpower and judgement&quot; whatever that means.
Lotsa luck in your attempt to legislate willpower and judgement
(however you perceive them).

This new law is despicable beyond words; oppressive and shameful.
Personally, I look forward grimly to when it finally comes back to
haunt all who applaud it. Because sure as the sun shines, it most
certainly will.

I was always convinced that the neoconservative drive to castrate
elected government--however bad it might have been--would really
accomplish nothing except to transfer power over individual citizens to
unelected despots. This law, written, debated and enacted by lending
industry employees and lackies, is a perfect illustration. It is the
most foul, snake oil method of theft I've ever been unfortunate enough
to witness, beating taxation by a country mile both in terms of
immorality and profitability.

"/> I take it you agree then that writing laws against &quot;issuing credit past 25%
of income&quot; isn't the solution? Being refused credit won't cure your medical
problem and it won't expand your options when you're struggling to pay the
hospital bill.

And as you pointed out, this is a health insurance issue, not a bank
creditor issue. Banks are not in the health insurance business and should
not have to subsidize through lax bankruptcy laws the losses caused by a
failure of the legislature to implement sensible healthcare reform. In fact,
it just gives politicians another excuse to avoid fixing the healthcare
problem when too many people can resort to bankruptcy to &quot;settle&quot; their
hospital bills.

Since any bank would prefer a higher APR all things being equal, why is it
obligated to want you to achieve this feat?

Furthermore, why do you care what the bank wants? The choice to charge or
not charge is yours and you don't seem to have trouble exercising the
willpower to make that choice. Why do you need a law to stop them from
&quot;enticing you&quot; into charging more?

Let me disclaim this a bit by saying I do, in fact, think we should clamp
down on mailing unsolicited convenience checks because of the possibility of
identity theft if USPS misdelivers the check or if your mailbox is broken
into despite your taking reasonable precautions. But that's quite separate
from the issue you were raising.

"/> Somewhere between 80 and 90% of personal bankruptcies are
a direct result of medical bills, divorce, job loss or a combination
of these three factors. According to Consumer Union, 85% of
elderly debtors cite medical expenses and job loss as the reason
for bankruptcy:
http://public.findlaw.com/bankruptcy/nolo/ency/B0B66870-4C52-4303-919...

Medical bills and the 50-70 million Americans without health
insurance accounted for 40% of bankruptcies in 1999:
http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/320/7245/1295

So, you can blow &quot;willpower&quot; out your ass. Simply put, this
bankruptcy &quot;reform&quot; bashes the poor. It's mean-spirited and
horribly unfair to consumers. If there were any doubts our
current elected representatives in Washington D.C. are little
more than corporate special interest whores, this legislation
should put those doubts to rest.

care. It just passes it on to someone else.

&quot;Exonerate&quot;, used in the context of a business transaction such as a
loan (and yes, even a defaulted loan) is a word that's out of place. It
imbues the transaction with an emotional charge inappropriate for the
conduct of business simply because you imagine it would support your
position. It does not. Do you think you would ever find such a word in
a loan contract?

It assumes there is blame or guilt to be assigned. By using that word,
you have already passed judgement on the debtor; you have
tried/convicted him on the flimsiest of evidence; evidence, moreover,
that may have been manufactured by the complainant. You have become a
despot, in other words--a position apparently much in demand in this
country these days.

*That's* what's wrong with that word in this context.

BS, that's your primary reason for cheering on this reprehensible state
of affairs. Reread your articles. You think all (or at least most)
defaulting debtors deserve punishment, that's completely apparent from
your articles and ramrod straight in line with Congress' view. You (and
they) have inserted highly questionable &quot;morality&quot; into the equation
and your position, though law right now, cannot ultimately prevail
because it is wrong.

&gt; I do expect to legislate that those who fail to exercise willpower

Just further exemplifying your purposefully ignorant, broadly punitive
attitude and ethically vacant nature.

Hint: you can't morally bleed people when they are down and smile all
the while and say, &quot;Don't take it personally, it's just business.&quot;
Expect retribution if you do, and don't expect much sympathy when it
comes (well, you might get commiseration from other disreputables who,
like you, would cut their own mother's throat if it served their
economic purpose). Once upon a time, it *was* just business, but you
and your lending friends have taken it to a whole new level. You have
given many people a common enemy.

"/> It's politically impossible because it'd destroy property values, thus
reducing them to where they were back in the 19th century, when
ordinary people could afford to buy property without going into debt
for 30 years. Today's hyper-inflated property values are possible
only because the secondary mortgage market allows spreading the costs
of buying property to a 35 year period (it takes most people about 5
years to accumulate the down payment for buying property) rather than
a 5 year period. If not for the secondary mortgage market, a typical
$150,000 house would be selling for $30,000 (i.e., 20%) -- not very
attractive to people who bought houses at $150,000!

So basically, giving out mortgages to all comers means that property values
are 80% higher. It's simple supply and demand -- if there's 80% less money
in the market, and the same supply, prices will be 80% less. Cheaper
property would destroy the wealth of people who have already bought
property. So you're right, it would be politically impossible -- but for
a reason different from the one you thought.

price of most new houses today is labor.

Look, this is all simple economics. Adam Smith. Supply and demand.
If you decrease the supply of money available to buy homes, while
the supply of homes remains constant, the (absolute) cost of homes will
decline. That is not, however, something that would be politically
popular, since it would destroy many ordinary people's wealth (most of which
is tied up in their homes).

&gt;you ARE a real loony. PLONK.

"/> Nope. He's right. The price of homes is determined by supply and
demand. If you build a lot of homes in an area, the price of homes
in that area will decrease slightly. If people want to move into an
area, the price goes up.

If the money supply increases (aka &quot;inflation&quot;), then the price of
everything goes up, including homes. If the money supply decreases,
the prices go down (aka &quot;deflation&quot;, &quot;recession&quot;, &quot;depression&quot; or
&quot;panic&quot;).

If people couldn't borrow money to buy houses, the prices of homes
would decrease because fewer people would be in a position to buy.
This wouldn't _really_ change the affordability of homes, though,
because the same pool of people would be competing for houses as
before. But there would be a shift in who could afford to buy which
houses -- older people and people who are more willing to save instead
of spending their money would be able to afford more house than today,
and younger people and poor savers would be able to afford less house
(smaller, in less desirable neighborhoods, or no house at all).

But the biggest change would indeed be that people who bought houses
under the current scheme would see the price they could get for their
houses go down. In effect, they would lose part of the 'capital' they
have invested in their home.

That's why it's also (probably) politically impossible to repeal the
income tax. People are willing to pay more for houses because the
interest is tax-deductible. Do away with that and present homeowners
will see a decrease in their home values. That's a _lot_ of votes.
Then add in the effect on tax-exempt bonds. Cities and states are
able to borrow money at very low rates (current around 4.5-5%, I
think) because lenders don't have to pay tax on the interest. Get rid
of the income tax and cities/states will have to pay closer to 8%
to borrow money.

I'll agree that he's a loony about one thing, though. The idea that
we should somehow get rid of home loans. I have no idea why anybody
would want to do that, except maybe some old fart who's already made
his money and wants to be able to buy a home at a lower price. The
change he proposes would be good for people like that, but it would be
bad for most younger people.

The system of lending money to buy homes allows people to buy houses
around the time they start having children, which IMHO is a good
thing. Anybody who's lived in an apartment building with babies in
the apt. next to them (or above or below) will agree, I suspect.

I wrote about this in another thread. It _looks_ like the middlemen
(distributors, retailers, moneylenders) don't do anything except
enrich themselves at other people's expense. So there have been
attempts at various times to get rid of them. Every time this has
been done, the economy crashed. Middlemen act like oil in the
economic engine. They make it run smoother, make it easier for buyers
and sellers to find each other. This is a valuable service and, like
any service, they charge for it.

"/> Eric is absolutely right that housing costs so much because 30 year
mortgages are available.

Just look what happened to housing prices over the last three years:
they shot up while the economy was in recession, and then in whats now
called a &quot;job-loss&quot; recovery. How could that happen? Interest rates
dropped, and each drop in interests rate allows you to borrow more for
the same monthly payment. When a rate drop allowed Joe Dokes to
borrow 250,000 where before he could only get $230,000 for the same
monthly payment he suddenly had no problem paying $20,000 more for the
same house, and, voila, the prices shot up.

You can see the same thing with cars and car loans. Fifteen years ago
car loans were for three years. For $500/mo for 36 mos at 8% you
could get at $15,000 loan. Then four and five year car loans became
standard. Longer loans mean you can borrow more money for the same
monthly payment. For $500/mo for 72 months at 8% (just to hold that
even) you can get a $25,000 loan. Sure enough, the average price of a
new car shot up. Of course all kinds of cool features that used to be
luxuries are now standard, so you can say we get more value for the
price increase, but the reality is that if people had been stuck with
3 year car loans the automakers would have kept power windows etc. as
options and not made them standard.

While I agree it seems like a good idea to let people borrow for home
mortgages, we have to acknowledge the dark side of long term
mortgages, which is the price inflation Eric is talking about.

mortgages. The likely results of such an action would be a decrease in the
standard of living that would not be acceptable to most Americans. We vote

ours.
