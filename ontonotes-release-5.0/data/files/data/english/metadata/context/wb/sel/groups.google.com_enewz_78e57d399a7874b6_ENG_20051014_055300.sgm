How to Buy a Home Theater System
So now you've got a CD player, a DVD and digital video recorders (DVR), a
plasma-screen TV, and a satellite dish. The perfect way to tie all these
media components together is with a state-of-the-art home theater.
Everything from low-end theaters-in-a-box to custom systems costing
thousands of dollars is available. Here's how to create the ultimate
private screening room.

Steps:
1.
Take stock of your current components. A home theater system connects
video sources (DVD, VCR, DVR, and cable or satellite boxes), a TV or
monitor, and a set of five or six speakers through a home theater
receiver. Many people also plug audio components (CD and MP3 players) into
their receiver. It may be that all you need is a receiver and speakers.

2.
Look at your space. If you have a dedicated room for the home theater, get
a more powerful system (measured in watts per channel). For a bedroom, 40
watts is plenty; 40 to 80 watts is good for an average-sized living room.
Get at least an 80-watt receiver if you have a large room with high
ceilings.

3.
Buy a receiver with at minimum Digital Theater System (DTS) or Dolby
Digital. (Dolby Digital and DTS are competing, incompatible formats for
home theater sound. Check your DVDs--they're more likely to have Dolby
Digital sound.) Avoid receivers with Dolby Surround or Dolby ProLogic
unless they also have Dolby Digital. Dolby Digital EX and DTS-ES are the
next step up; THX is the top of the line.

4.
Check out the universal remote that comes with the receiver. You'll want
to operate several components with this remote, so make sure it's easy to
use and makes sense.

5.
Listen carefully to the speakers when you shop. Six speakers make up the
ideal home theater: left and right front-channel speakers, left and right
surround speakers, a subwoofer, and a center-channel speaker. The
center-channel speaker is probably the most important, since most movie
dialogue comes from it. If you're watching the bottom line, forgo the
subwoofer.

6.
Consider theater-in-a-box systems if your space is average to small or
you're technically challenged. Combining receiver, speakers and cables
(and often a DVD player), these systems offer easy setup and operation as
well as a smaller price tag. Read up on these systems online or in
specialty magazines, since their quality ranges from surprisingly good to
very bad.

Overall Tips:

Got kids? Dolby Digital includes a feature for latenight viewing that
plays dialogue and quiet scenes a little louder, and noisy scenes a little
quieter.

Always hook up components by the connectors that provide the
highest-quality signal. For video components, they are (in descending
order) component-video, S-Video, composite-video, and antenna/cable
inputs. For audio components, they are digital optical, coaxial, and RCA
connectors.
