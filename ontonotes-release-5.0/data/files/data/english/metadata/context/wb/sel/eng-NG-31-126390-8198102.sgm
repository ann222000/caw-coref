I've always used Windows machines and am growing increasingly weary of
fighting all the darned virii, worms, etc. I was hoping that the mac
mini would be upgraded with a intel core 2 duo processor, in which
case my intention was to buy one and join the &quot;other side&quot;, i.e. the
mac community. However, I'm now hearing that the mac mini is most
likely going to be dropped from Apple's product line altogether.

Is this correct? Does anyone know for sure? The mac mini appeals to me
in a way that the iMac and more &quot;muscular&quot; macs do not. I like the
fact that it's 'headless' and I like the small form factor.

Thanks,

Steve

Even if it is, what's the difference? Do they actually still make the
EXACT model PC you currently own - same specs and everything?

If you bought one today and they stopped making them tomorrow, how would
that change your experience?

That's nothing more than a rumor, with no substantial evidence what-so-ever.

Not that it really matters either way.  If you purchased a Mac mini
today, and tomorrow Apple announced they were going to drop the mini
from their product line, they'd still support your Mac mini for years
to come. I don't see any reason for you not to purchase one if that's
what you want.  I personally own three of them. They are great little
compact machines.

BTW, you can upgrade the processor in your Mac mini to a Core 2 Duo
yourself easily in less than 30 minutes. Just make sure the Core 2 Duo
you order is the Socket 478 Mobile variety. I have the original Mac
mini Intel Core Solo and just ordered a Intel Core2 Duo T5600 1.83GHz
for it. I can't wait to get it!  : )

It would influence my decision to buy because I've heard that the
intel core duo processor in the current mini is noticeably inferior to
the core duo 2 and to some other readily available processors. That
said, I would at least consider buying one of the current minis in
spite of this, but the unlikelihood of any upcoming processor upgrade
would be one factor that I would consider along with many others.
That's all I meant.

Can't answer that, but I can answer &quot;what if you bought one today and they
'speed bumped' the Mini tomorrow&quot;.

Perhaps not immediately, but as the computer ages and newer apps and OSes,
written for newer and more powerful computers are installed on this computer,
one's experience will change. And the more powerful computer you start with,
the longer you can put off that declining experience, and put off replacing
the computer.

If I'd waited for the next speed bump before buying my PowerBook, 6 years
later I'd not be feeling quite so pressed to buy a new Mac; my experience
would be one of more satisfactory (let's say: less-frustrating) web browsing
and other processor/video/bus-intensive tasks. I might have been able to put
off that purchase for another year or 2.

It's how long after your purchase that the usefulness of the computer
depreciates (in useability, not $$ value) relative to the newer, bloated OSes
and applications that it will be forced to work with. Most of us want to be
able to use *this* computer for as long as possible. Starting with the most
powerful computer you can afford stretches out that timeline.

That's the benefit of waiting before jumping into a new computer.

Your Mileage Will Vary

You're making the assumption that the computer isn't upgradeable, which
is not the case with the Mac mini. You can replace the processor with a
much faster Core 2 Duo, you can upgrade the RAM up to the maximum 2 GB,
you can upgrade the internal hard drive as larger 2.5&quot; hard drives come
out. For an upgradable computer, especially one whose CPU can be
upgraded, that &quot;declining experience&quot; can be tapered as time goes on,
so the computer itself will last much longer. I just don't see much of
a reason not to purchase a Mac mini if it's desirable to you right now.

Sure.  I ended up purchasing mine from http://buy.com for $249.99:

&lt; http://tinyurl.com/yw57xd &gt;

Not the cheapest price on the net, but I get 3% cash back from my
Yub.com membership, and another 3% from my credit card, so in the end I
get the CPU for $234.99, which is cheaper than most internet retailers.
We are cautious about who who we do business with online, so peace of
mind knowing we are dealing with a reputable retailed also plays a part
in that decision. Buy.com has treated us very well (better than Amazon)
over the years, and usually has low prices for most things, so they get
our repeat business.

This CPU is destined to replace the 1.5 GHz Core Solo processor
currently in our &quot;media center&quot; Mac mini running EyeTV 24/7 recording
to a 500 GB external drive. The Core Solo keeps up amazingly well, but
it does stutter from time to time during simultaneous recording and
playback while recordings are transferring over the wireless network to
our file server. This will solve that problem for good, and will likely
also let us raise the quality level of the encoding to the maximum.

It looks like the package has already made it to my state, so I should
have it in the next couple days.  I can't wait to get it!  : )

You're right, of course.

I guess what I meant is no soldering or the like is required. The CPU
fits into a socket on the board, so it's fairly easy to detach the old
one and put in the new one. The exercise of opening the Mac mini and
gaining access to the CPU is documented fairly well on the web, so I
think mostly anyone with patience and attention to detail can get that
job done.

Surely the iMac can't be that difficult to take apart?  Hey, then you
can try it with the back off and measure how much cooler it runs!

&gt; The iSight's estimate was $150 parts plus $85 labor,

Oh please.  What makes you think Firewire is too slow?  Consider that
an hour of fairly high quality encoding results in a measly 2 GB file.
That means during recording, you are transferring 28.44 KB per second
to the drive.  Firewire 400's reliable 48 MB per second is *plenty*
fast enough for encoding video.  USB would do the job as well, although
it is admittedly inferior to Firewire in many ways.

I just had the back off of my G5 iMac to blow out dust etc. Every
time I open it up I marvel at the excellent internal design of the
system. Blowing out the dust, as little as there was, actually seems
to have reduced the fan runrate and dropped the temps, especially for
the hard drive. It would be interesting if new iMacs would support
either quad core and/or faster system busses. Heat dissipation should
actually not be an issue because the class of processors that are in
the XServes are packed in pretty tightly and they are in 1U
rackmountable cases. YMMV

Actually, we're using the EyeTV 250, because we don't have a cable box
in that room. Using the EyeTV Hybrid without a cable box would have put
too much of a strain on the Mac mini's CPU for encoding to keep up, and
also would have resulted in the inability to record and watch recorded
stuff at the same time.  in contrast, the 250 does the encoding itself
rather than the computer doing it.  Make sure the model you buy fits

&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that EyeTV the SD version or the HD (Model 500) version? I have
&gt;&gt;&gt; had thoughts of doing the same in my living room with a mini, rather than
&gt;&gt;&gt; the limited AppleTV box.

&gt;&gt; Actually, we're using the EyeTV 250, because we don't have a cable box
&gt;&gt; in that room. Using the EyeTV Hybrid without a cable box would have put
&gt;&gt; too much of a strain on the Mac mini's CPU for encoding to keep up, and
&gt;&gt; also would have resulted in the inability to record and watch recorded
&gt;&gt; stuff at the same time.  in contrast, the 250 does the encoding itself
&gt;&gt; rather than the computer doing it.  Make sure the model you buy fits
&gt;&gt; with your setup!

&gt; Thanks, I'lllook into it!

The main thing to keep in mind is that not all EyeTV devices have a
built-in encoder. Some rely on the computer or the cable box to do the
encoding/decoding. The Hybrid is one such device. When connected to a
cable box, the Hybrid receives an already-encoded stream from the box,
so no encoding is needed in the Hybrid or on the computer. But when you
connect the Hybrid to a straight coaxial connection, the Hybrid must
use the computer to do the encoding/decoding.
