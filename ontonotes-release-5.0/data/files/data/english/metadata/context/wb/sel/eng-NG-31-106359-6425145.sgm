Just because something is found in nature does not mean it is without
risk. For instance, you've probably heard of the ephedra
controversy...

This product was also linked to a number of serious side effects and
deaths. In 2004, the FDA banned the sale of ephedra-containing
supplements... bad, so bad

You won't be able to do so, because prescription drugs are not always

much more dangerous than some prescription drugs.

Depends. No general statements can be made from the above info. "Herbal"
can mean a million different things like asking "is this drug bad for me?"
without naming the drug.

Ephedra is safe for most people as studies have shown. It's not for
everyone as it's a stimulant. People with some pre existing medical
conditions should avoid it.

I think that Vernon is saying prescription drugs are dangerous by
definition because the drugs that are only available by prescription are
regulated this way by the government because they are dangerous. The logic
behind this is fundamentally flawed. A drug isn't necessarily dangerous
because the government says it is. Pharmaceutical companies often push for
their drug to be available only by prescription for reasons other than
safety. This applies to the US only, I don't know the regulations in other
world states.

Claiming that most prescription drugs are dangerous is probably not
controversial, but arguing that absolutely all of them are dangerous is
simply idiotic. Why listen to the opinion of an idiot?

Argue with the FDA,
First get an education.
Second, if you don't like it get rid of the FDA.  They are almost always

They DEFINE certain drugs to be CONTROLLED because of DANGERS.

Now go get an education and see if that makes logical sense (to the FDA)

Opinion?
Get an education and ask an FDA official why some substances are
"CONTROLLED"
It's not MY opinion it is THEIR opinion and they RULE.

But then you have no desire for logic or truth, just your lying and trolling
without any remorse for your near criminal attitude.
Come to think of it, maybe I should look into what the FDA thinks of people
who claim what the FDA says to be lies.  Hmmmm, inciting lawlessness?
Inciting illegal purchase or sales of "controlled, dangerous" drugs in the
face of the FDA?  Interesting.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; professed expert on everything, has been making it up as he goes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please explain (ask your guru or mother) why are the drugs &quot;controlled&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (prescription)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you really that ignorant????

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The ignorance is yours, Vernon.  You just keep trying to cover it up.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; YOU made the claim.  YOU get to back it up.  Demonstrate to us that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all prescription drugs are controlled because they are sooo
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dangerous.  Show us where the FDA says that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can't.  You never will.  You just keep blathering, assuring us we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should believe you because you're SUCH an expert.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is your big chance, expert -- give us some references to back up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your claim.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think that Vernon is saying prescription drugs are dangerous by
&gt;&gt;&gt;definition because the drugs that are only available by prescription are
&gt;&gt;&gt;regulated this way by the government because they are dangerous. The logic
&gt;&gt;&gt;behind this is fundamentally flawed. A drug isn't necessarily dangerous
&gt;&gt;&gt;because the government says it is. Pharmaceutical companies often push for
&gt;&gt;&gt;their drug to be available only by prescription for reasons other than
&gt;&gt;&gt;safety. This applies to the US only, I don't know the regulations in other
&gt;&gt;&gt;world states.

&gt;&gt; Nor do I, but Vernon is making his claim about the US, so that's a
&gt;&gt; reasonable restriction on the discussion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Claiming that most prescription drugs are dangerous is probably not
&gt;&gt;&gt;controversial, but arguing that absolutely all of them are dangerous is
&gt;&gt;&gt;simply idiotic. Why listen to the opinion of an idiot?

&gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with listening to them -- I just wonder if anyone takes
&gt;&gt; his idiotic opinions seriously?

&gt;Opinion?
&gt;Get an education and ask an FDA official why some substances are
&gt;&quot;CONTROLLED&quot;
&gt;It's not MY opinion it is THEIR opinion and they RULE.
">

Where can we read this rule?

And while we at it, when are you going to explain to me why I can only
buy metformin on prescription but I can buy unlimited quantities of
acetaminophen over the counter? There is no known dangerous dose of
metformin (the person who took 800 tablets in one go just got a severe
case of the trots) but paracetamol is the suicide drug of choice for
adolescents, with 50 tablets capable of causing the need for a liver
transplant.

I have both drugs in my home, and I have asked you to explain this
anomaly before.

I've got news for you, Vernon:  calling you a fool and an ignoramus

carefully stays anonymous -- so as to make it harder to disprove your

It bothers me to answer a question with another one.

Given that there are different levels of control:

Why is marijuana far more controlled than nicotine or alcohol?  That's
pretty rhetorical.  But, you must admit, drug control classifications have
more to do with perception of abuse than safety for the informed user.

Then it is a mistake for the precription medication to be a
presciption medication. (unless long term use is a problem, you do not
mention whether the problem is not high short term dosage but rather
something else.  Also it might be very dangerous for certain people
with certain problems, high blood pressure, who knows.  Vernon does
not have to defent the ability of the prescription system.)  People
obviously should be able to use it without a doctor around.  Vernon is
right however about the intention of making drugs prescription.  And
especially in the context of the inane subject of this thread - reread
the moronic title - his point is well taken.

This really is  a non starter . If you really want to see evidence of
the inherent danger of prescpition drugs just look at the side effect
section of the presciption you get. All presciption drugs carry risk.
Listen closly the next time you hear a drug ad. the last 10 sec. will
describe the side effects ranging from itch to death. Presciption
drugs are at least the 3rd leading cause of death in this country .

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This product was also linked to a number of serious side effects and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deaths. In 2004, the FDA banned the sale of ephedra-containing

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (If interesting, full article:

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is your big chance, expert -- give us some references to back up
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your claim.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I think that Vernon is saying prescription drugs are dangerous by
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;definition because the drugs that are only available by prescription are
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;regulated this way by the government because they are dangerous. The logic
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;behind this is fundamentally flawed. A drug isn't necessarily dangerous
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;because the government says it is. Pharmaceutical companies often push for
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;their drug to be available only by prescription for reasons other than
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;safety. This applies to the US only, I don't know the regulations in other
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;world states.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Nor do I, but Vernon is making his claim about the US, so that's a
&gt; &gt;&gt; reasonable restriction on the discussion.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Claiming that most prescription drugs are dangerous is probably not
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;controversial, but arguing that absolutely all of them are dangerous is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;simply idiotic. Why listen to the opinion of an idiot?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with listening to them -- I just wonder if anyone takes
&gt; &gt;&gt; his idiotic opinions seriously?

&gt; &gt;Opinion?
&gt; &gt;Get an education and ask an FDA official why some substances are
&gt; &gt;&quot;CONTROLLED&quot;
&gt; &gt;It's not MY opinion it is THEIR opinion and they RULE.

&gt; Where can we read this rule?

&gt; And while we at it, when are you going to explain to me why I can only
&gt; buy metformin on prescription but I can buy unlimited quantities of
&gt; acetaminophen over the counter? There is no known dangerous dose of
&gt; metformin (the person who took 800 tablets in one go just got a severe
&gt; case of the trots) but paracetamol is the suicide drug of choice for
&gt; adolescents, with 50 tablets capable of causing the need for a liver
&gt; transplant.

&gt; I have both drugs in my home, and I have asked you to explain this
&gt; anomaly before.

&gt; &gt;But then you have no desire for logic or truth, just your lying and trolling
&gt; &gt;without any remorse for your near criminal attitude.
&gt; &gt;Come to think of it, maybe I should look into what the FDA thinks of people
&gt; &gt;who claim what the FDA says to be lies.  Hmmmm, inciting lawlessness?
&gt; &gt;Inciting illegal purchase or sales of &quot;controlled, dangerous&quot; drugs in the
&gt; &gt;face of the FDA?  Interesting.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Vernon always tries to sound very
&gt; &gt;&gt; authoritative.  If you read him for a while, you discover that he
&gt; &gt;&gt; posts the most incredible variety of nonsense, some of it obvious,
&gt; &gt;&gt; some of it less so.  This is not to say that everything he posts is
&gt; &gt;&gt; wrong (it's not), but a lot of it is, and there's no handy method of
&gt; &gt;&gt; sorting the occasional wheat from the majority chaff.

&gt; &gt;ASK the FDA.

Metformin can cause a potentially fatal reaction acid lactidosis.
Look it up on any drug reference site. It also can cause hypoglycimia.
Again all or at least vitualy all drugs carry risk. The reason they
are regulated is because of that risk the reason they can only be

The above, was a statement of ignorance by someone mentally blind (Petty
Bowl).
The FACT that the FDA deems (correct or incorrect) some substances dangerous
does NOT mean there are not other substances even worse.  (dingy Pete forgot
to mention the most common, aspirin) Prescription drugs are "defined" as
needing control.
Of course there are dozens of studies showing real and devastating problems
with metformin, much more than acetaminophen, but they are just probably
opinions.

Now here is an "opinion" proven through out the centuries.
Government always clouds the issue.  As civilizations "progress" government
increases until the point of self destruction.

prescription but the dangers are so obvious that "control" is not deemed
necessary.
Even then, I have often wondered why there are not stronger warnings on
bottles of Hydrogen Peroxide.  I guess there haven't been enough problems.

The economics of tobacco and alcohol production are more favorable to

both.

It has nothing to do with either.  It has to do with sponsorship at

Ephedra is a stimulant.  It isn't as dangerous as prescription stimulants.
It is nearly useless for the purposes typically sold for or bought for.
Because it is nearly useless for the purposes used it becomes overused by
the twits.
Ephedra doesn't grow ANYWHERE except in processing factories.  It is in some
plants, but the plants are not ephedra plants and even a fairly
knowledgeable person would have great difficulty extracting the active
ingredient.  (Except in their placebo mind)

Of course the same comment applies to the real product, ephedrine.

From Wikipedia:
Ephedra is a genus of gymnosperm shrubs, the only genus in the family
Ephedraceae and order Ephedrales. These plants occur in dry climates
over a wide area mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, across southern
Europe, north Africa, southwest and central Asia, southwestern North
America, and, in the Southern Hemisphere, in South America south to
Patagonia. They are also called Joint-pine, Jointfir, or Mormon-tea. The
Chinese name is ??, má huáng, which means "yellow hemp". Ephedra is
also sometimes called sea grape (from the French raisin de mer),
although that is also a common name for Coccoloba uvifera.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedra_%28genus%29

Some friends in the northwest had it growing wild in their garden.  I
found it was better and less harsh to use than ephedrine as a
decongestant.  There is really no reason to keep it illegal since meth
freaks can't make meth from the herb.  Most of these bans are by
knee-jerk politicians who are clueless about what they are doing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can mean a million different things like asking &quot;is this drug bad for

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without naming the drug.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just because something is found in nature does not mean it is without

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; controversy...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ephedra is safe for most people as studies have shown. It's not for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everyone as it's a stimulant. People with some pre existing medical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conditions should avoid it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And every bottle of it I bought had the contraindications listed right
&gt;&gt;&gt; on it. Maybe we should ban illiteracy instead.  BTW, ephedra grows wild
&gt;&gt;&gt; throughout the US.

&gt;&gt; Ephedra is a stimulant.  It isn't as dangerous as prescription
&gt;&gt; stimulants.
&gt;&gt; It is nearly useless for the purposes typically sold for or bought for.
&gt;&gt; Because it is nearly useless for the purposes used it becomes overused by
&gt;&gt; the twits.
&gt;&gt; Ephedra doesn't grow ANYWHERE except in processing factories.  It is in
&gt;&gt; some plants, but the plants are not ephedra plants and even a fairly
&gt;&gt; knowledgeable person would have great difficulty extracting the active
&gt;&gt; ingredient.  (Except in their placebo mind)

&gt;&gt; Of course the same comment applies to the real product, ephedrine.
&gt; From Wikipedia:
&gt; Ephedra is a genus of gymnosperm shrubs, the only genus in the family
&gt; Ephedraceae and order Ephedrales. These plants occur in dry climates over
&gt; a wide area mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, across southern Europe,
&gt; north Africa, southwest and central Asia, southwestern North America, and,
&gt; in the Southern Hemisphere, in South America south to Patagonia. They are
&gt; also called Joint-pine, Jointfir, or Mormon-tea. The Chinese name is ??,
&gt; má huáng, which means &quot;yellow hemp&quot;. Ephedra is also sometimes called sea
&gt; grape (from the French raisin de mer), although that is also a common name
&gt; for Coccoloba uvifera.

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedra_%28genus%29

&gt; Some friends in the northwest had it growing wild in their garden.  I
&gt; found it was better and less harsh to use than ephedrine as a
&gt; decongestant.  There is really no reason to keep it illegal since meth
&gt; freaks can't make meth from the herb.  Most of these bans are by knee-jerk

Your last sentence is true.  The supremacy of the herbal is bullshit.

With pharmaceutical ephedrine, you know what you're getting.  With the
herbals, the ratios of the different ephedra alkaloids can vary by an
order of magnitude.  Ephedrine is fairly effective as an indirect
beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist by causing the release of norepinephrine;
pseudoephedrine is not nearly so effective.

Of course, some people get a great placebo effect from knowing that
something is "natural."  Whatever.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This product was also linked to a number of serious side effects and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deaths. In 2004, the FDA banned the sale of ephedra-containing
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; supplements... bad, so bad

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (If interesting, full article:

&gt; &gt; http://herbalnature.blogspot.com/2007/03/herbal-supplements-arent-alw ...)

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which bad herbal supplements do you know?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whereas; Prescription drugs are &quot;ALWAYS&quot; &quot;DANGEROUS&quot;, by definition.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whereas, Vernon keeps saying this -- without evidence.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Give us the evidence, Vernon -- show us the URL on the FDA web site
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where it says that prescription drugs are always dangerous.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You won't be able to do so, because prescription drugs are not always
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dangerous.  Some of them are quite innocuous, and many OTC items are
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much more dangerous than some prescription drugs.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, well -- it's been obvious from the outset that Vernon, the self-
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; professed expert on everything, has been making it up as he goes.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Please explain (ask your guru or mother) why are the drugs &quot;controlled&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (prescription)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Are you really that ignorant????

&gt; &gt;&gt; The ignorance is yours, Vernon.  You just keep trying to cover it up.
&gt; &gt;&gt; YOU made the claim.  YOU get to back it up.  Demonstrate to us that
&gt; &gt;&gt; all prescription drugs are controlled because they are sooo
&gt; &gt;&gt; dangerous.  Show us where the FDA says that.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You can't.  You never will.  You just keep blathering, assuring us we
&gt; &gt;&gt; should believe you because you're SUCH an expert.

&gt; &gt;&gt; This is your big chance, expert -- give us some references to back up
&gt; &gt;&gt; your claim.

&gt; &gt;I think that Vernon is saying prescription drugs are dangerous by
&gt; &gt;definition because the drugs that are only available by prescription are
&gt; &gt;regulated this way by the government because they are dangerous. The logic
&gt; &gt;behind this is fundamentally flawed. A drug isn't necessarily dangerous
&gt; &gt;because the government says it is. Pharmaceutical companies often push for
&gt; &gt;their drug to be available only by prescription for reasons other than
&gt; &gt;safety. This applies to the US only, I don't know the regulations in other
&gt; &gt;world states.

&gt; Nor do I, but Vernon is making his claim about the US, so that's a
&gt; reasonable restriction on the discussion.

&gt; &gt;Claiming that most prescription drugs are dangerous is probably not
&gt; &gt;controversial, but arguing that absolutely all of them are dangerous is
&gt; &gt;simply idiotic. Why listen to the opinion of an idiot?

&gt; Nothing wrong with listening to them -- I just wonder if anyone takes
&gt; his idiotic opinions seriously?  Vernon always tries to sound very
&gt; authoritative.  If you read him for a while, you discover that he
&gt; posts the most incredible variety of nonsense, some of it obvious,
&gt; some of it less so.  This is not to say that everything he posts is
&gt; wrong (it's not), but a lot of it is, and there's no handy method of
&gt; sorting the occasional wheat from the majority chaff.

All prescription drugs are dangerous. The reason they can only be
given by Doctors is because of that danger. Antibiotics by nature are
poisans they kill living bacteria. Hopefully they kill more bad, then
good bacteria. To ask for a web page is a silly debaters trick. The
whole underlying theory of allopathic medicine is a little poisin can
control symptoms for example tremors. Or that healthly organisms are
more able to withstand poisen thandiseasedones think chemo. If so many
drugs are safe could you just list 3 here. I really don't think so.
Herbs on the other hand have a fine safe. There are of couty record do
you need ao script to buy oregano or basil. there are of course toxic
herbs where do youthink most medicines come from.

Here is *your* education, dumbass.  Pharmaceutical ephedrine continues
to be approved by the FDA for OTC use.  The ban was solely on herbal
ephedra for the reasons I stated above.  I won't try to explain the
