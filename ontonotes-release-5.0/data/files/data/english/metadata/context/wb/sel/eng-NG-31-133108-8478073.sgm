Yeah, you really should have, but since you've now made a pretty
dramatic accusation against us in public, I'd like to clear a few
things up:

* In the internal conversations we had regarding our new website and
marketing message, I don't think Obu was even *mentioned*, let alone
having served as the sole source of inspiration.  To accuse of having
given up on any form of creativity and resorted to imitating Obu is
ridiculous.

* You mentioned in your (subsequent) private e-mail to us that &quot;The
whole 3 things concept was branded locally here by us over a year
ago.&quot;  Frankly, Josh, the concept has been done by tons of companies
across many industries for years.  It's a *common* way to focus a
complex marketing message.  We had a lot of services, so we decided to
simplify our offerings, and they happened to land in three main
categories.

* We've used sets of 3 to organize marketing messages on our client
sites almost since we started -- including older versions of our own
website.  Heck, Forty Media used to be called &quot;ThreeRing&quot; consulting,
after the three primary services we offered.

* Your three things aren't even the same as ours, for crying out loud.

Now that I look at the two, it sucks that there are some vague
parallels between the two, and I wish we'd caught that earlier so we
could differentiate better.  We just don't spend that much time
looking at your website.

Frankly, though, Obu was *not* an inspiration for us in this process,
and you're accusation has been drastically mishandled.

&gt; &gt; Hey no fair ripping our marketing.

&gt; &gt; &gt;We only offer three services: we plan websites, we build websites, and we promote websites.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Over the years, we've refined our service offerings to narrow them down to our three core areas of expertise: planning, building, and promoting websites.

&gt; &gt; I know you guys are better than this, Man up and come up with
&gt; &gt; something original. I am really disappointed in you guys and pretty
&gt; &gt; frustrated you somehow thought it was okay to pull somethin like this.
&gt; &gt; F*cking disgraceful.

lol ^

Honestly, I don't even think this discussion deserves any more
attention than it already has.  There's just really no practical
comparison.

This does bring up an interesting topic however.  Even if there was
the slightest &quot;inspiration&quot; in the new Forty site, we can't deny the
reality and sensibility of the great Isaac Newton's quote: &quot;If I have
seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of giants&quot;.  We live in
society; and in society, we share and improve upon our &quot;ideas&quot; - much
to the benefit of those we live with.  The truth is, unless you can
honestly create something from nothing (like God does), pure
originality is impossible (though the spirit/concept of originality
endures).  For the sake of humility and advancement, we must all
recognize this.  That's why I'm proud to be a part of a community like
Refresh.  =)

I'm pretty sure I haven't laughed that hard in years, between the sign and

somebody start another &quot;feud&quot;.

Hey, who stole my &quot;logo&quot; idea. I thought I originated having a logo on a
website!

I do wish to apologize to Forty Media as well as all of you for making
a spectacle of this. I made a rash judgment/acusation and let my
emotions get the better of me.

In discussion, both parties have come to agreement there were some
evident similarities and the text in question has been removed. This
matter is closed.

For the sake of clarification: the similarities in wording (there were
two particular words involved) were unintentional, and were removed as
a courtesy.  For obvious reasons, we wouldn't just lift the marketing
message of such a close competitor (and I don't think anyone here
believes that's what actually happened).

Our service offerings and client base are similar, and we separately
happened upon some similar wording.  Once we were aware of the
similarities, we happily reworded two sentences to remove the words in
question, thus removing any lingering confusion between Obu and Forty.
Things should be very clear now.

If this is an example of 'teaser marketing', it's really working well.

So - I'l bite: What are the Two Words?
