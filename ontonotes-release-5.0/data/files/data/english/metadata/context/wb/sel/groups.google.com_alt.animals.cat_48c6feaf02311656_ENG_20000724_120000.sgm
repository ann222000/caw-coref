I have two cats Jeorge 3yrs and Tess 2 yrs, both female. They get along
great, that's not my problem.... They also both have managed to pee all over
my house and I can't take anymore.

The first started last month. I also have two dogs. I would feed them in the
morning. When they were done, obviously the dog dish was empty. I would
leave it out, like usual. Well, one of the two cats had taken upon her own
to urinate into the dog dish and in doing so, sometimes hit the floor as
well. Thank God I have two dog food dishes and would then wash and put the
other out. This became an everyday occurrence before long. I believe this to
be Jeorge due to the way she uses the litter box, she hangs on the edge.
Within this last week, I've managed to find a plastic box downstairs (empty,
thank God again), that I've found urine in as well.

I used to think that this was due to me being late on cleaning out the
litter box, but I've cleaned it as normal and since it turned into an
everyday occurrence, I no longer felt that it had to do with the litter box.
Same litter, same changing schedule (it's been like this since I've had them
both.)

SO on to my second problem. Tess. Before I got her fixed, she managed to
scent up the entire livingroom furniture. I got that fixed about 6-9 months
ago. I walked in last night and found a nice warm mess on my boyfriends new
(1 month old) couch. I was so mad I almost killed them both on the spot. I
am so tired of the urine smell in my house.

Where I work, I have to go into peoples houses. The thing I hate the most
is that pet urine smell one gets a generous whiff of when you walk through
the door. It drives me nuts, don't these people take care of their pets. Now
I'm coming into that problem, because of my litter box slackers. I checked
it last night. I figured that I've forgotten to change it last time. Well if
I did, I didn't miss much. Looks like its been used about 3 times, except
for the feces. That's the right amount (about 3 days use.) Well I've changed

it and now starting with a clean one. But I just don't know what to do. I'm
so tired of the Urine smell in my house. I do love my cats, but I cat take
it anymore, I'm embarrassed by it.

Both cats seem to be healthy in everyway. Tess has been currently updated on
her shots, Jeorge has that done later. Both play and act well as normal cats
before. I don't see a change in their behavior. By the way, I live in a
split foyer house. Most of the incidents are upstairs. The only things that
are new to the house are the boyfriend and his stuff. Would this have
anything to do with them. He likes them and pets them and will take care of
them. I don't get it, please help. As for now, the boyfriend will stay. He
doesn't pee all over the house.

Thank you for listening and sorry it's so long,

Missy

I've always found that when my cats went in inappropriate places, it was
always a urinary tract infection (never had stones, maybe yours do?) Once
they were treated the problem went away, but it wasn't until I could see the
urine and the pinkish tinge that I knew there was a problem. Have them
checked specifically for that and for bladders stones, which might cause
them to pee at will because they feel they have to 'go' all the time.

You might also try a litterbox for each cat - some are just really pissy (no
pun intended) about sharing bathroom facilities. Nature's Miracle
enzymatically takes away the &quot;odor&quot; so that they will not be tempted to keep
going back to the same spot and will keep it from smelling to your nose as
well. Good luck!

That would be fine and dandy if I never would have picked them up. Now they
are like part of the family, as I'm sure many cat owners will tell you. They
are total opposites, but fit in the family well. So I can't just trade them
into fish, I'd like to solve the problem before the last resort of giving
them away.

But thanks for the response.

Most of the incidents are upstairs. The only things that

Seems like you've pretty well stated your decision (2nd last sentence, above)
right in the middle of sending this request for help. And actually you
mis-stated something. There are two new additions to the house, BF and his
couch (and his clothes etc etc)

I wonder if a good test would be to temporarily store the couch, and put yours
back in? see if that makes any difference ..give it some time for them to
digest the change.

But in case you are reconsidering (getting rid of the cats):

If you don't get this situation under control, you'll have more problems than
just peeing because stressed cats can (IMO) get serious urinary tract infections
and then you'll be going round and round in circles. (meds, vet, cats sick,
worry, stress)

It's not just jealousy of your attention to BF that's causing the problems.
They are also reacting to the new odour (you mentioned they pee on the couch
where he lies)..also clearly trying to drive him out by fouling the
environment. Even in humans, when someone new enters the picture (animal, baby
or BF), there's lots of adjustments to be made (by the humans, that means your
BF also)

I have two females who don't tolerate humans (esp males) around unless they are
very quiet and don't make sudden movements. Even what boyfriend might think is
petting could be much rougher than the cats are used to. Trust me, I tried to
convince ex-BF to be more gentle, he wouldn't listen. He laughs loud, he plays
music loud, and the cats just don't like it ..period!!! The BF's gone (for
other reasons) and the cats are very content now (until new loud male/persons
enter the premises).

There are things that you can do:

Ask BF not to sit/lie on things unless he's bathed first (so he's not spreading
his &quot;scent&quot; around) but it might already be in the couch. (can you get the couch
upholstered?). Have cat-petting sessions together. Show boyfriend how to be
gentle and what areas each cat likes to be brushed petted. they have to be
imprinted with his touch, his voice, his smell (in a positive way)...so a few
treats while they tolerate his &quot;petting&quot; wouldn't hurt (if there are no dietary
restrictions).

Separate the cats into either the upper level or basement (so BF and cats have
separate living areas)...that's sometimes a happy medium but then you will find
yourself running back and forth trying to keep both happy (or ignoring the cats
whch can be disastrous). BTDT Three years..it worked but was major PIA for me.

Mild tranquilizers for the cats? maybe, talk to your vet. (I don't particularly
care for this option, especially long-term).

Find them new homes together (where they will be happy)? maybe
(Personnally I'd stick with the cats, BF's come and go) JMHO ;-)

Dump the BF? maybe ...especially is he's not willing to make some adjustments
himself, to the situation. Right now he's just being himself. He might resent
being asked to change some of his habits.

BTW Sponge up as much of the urine as possible.
Warm water mixed with vinegar spritzed into the materials and then sponge back
up. Neutralizes the ammonia. Given the size of your place, this sounds like a
big continuous job.
Keep all clothing up off the floor (including shoes)
Remove carpets because the smell of &quot;ammonia&quot; will always stay there and draw
them back to pee there again.

Having said all that, I just reviewed your post:

You have a large home to maintain, a job, 2 dogs, 2 cats and now a new
boyfriend. Sounds to me like you've taken on more than one person can
reasonably handle and only you can decide, whether it's best to solve this the
&quot;easy&quot; way or try some of the suggestions.

Not a vet, just long-time cat(s) servant. &lt;g&gt;
Best wishes
J

BTW My cats each have their own cat litter which I clear of &quot;lumps&quot; then shuffle
around the litter with the scooper (twice a day) so that it does not stay wet
and lumpy in some spots. I change the whole litter (and disinfect the box) once
a week. If I go beyond that point, they deliberately pee over the
side...distinct message methinks. &lt;G&gt;

Yeah, litter boxes need to be cleaned daily.
Scoop it out in am and pm.
Have two for two cats.
They don't like to have to push the junk around,
or use it when its a bed of wet litter.
Primary reasons for the behavior is not enough
litter boxes, ill kept litter boxes, and urinary
tract infections, so fix your habits and have
them checked by vet. Most cats don't do this.

It really sounds like you are the litter box slacker.

I had the same problem having too cats a male and a female.

Cats are territory animals and pissing around is the ussual way they use
when they want to make it sure everybody understand where their territories
are.

A fact is that new members shew in the house, plus smelly furniture (at
cat's point of vue of course).

As respective territories shrunk because human beeings are considered as
cats by cats, there has been
a new competition launched with lethal weapons (poisonous odours !)

Before getting cats out of the house, you could try to get only one out, or
the dog, or the boyfriend.
This could add surface for the remaining cat's territory.

Personnaly the female has been adopted by may parents and is now living on
the French Riviera in Toulon.
She never had a wee out of her litter since then.

I hope this could help

Well I've added the second litter box. They're using it, or at least someone

I took the 3yr old to the vet for her update on shots. He told me that she
was fine, no urinary tract infection. Said it might be the other cat or,

caught the culprit in action.... actually caught her on tape and after she
was done, she admired it and then my boyfriend turned the corner and found
her. She took off.... And the suspect is.....

My older cat, 3 yr old Jeorge. So not sure what to do. When I had her
checked out and shots updated. Doc told me that he saw no signs of UTI. But
since she's doing it mostly in one spot, it sounds like a bad attitude.

And she's getting plenty of attention. Also the two litter boxes are cleaned
everyday.

What does one do with a bad attitude kitty. I don't think this is related
to the boyfriend, he actually likes her, not my talkative younger cat- Tess.

Gosh, Please help. Hate to give her away, but if I have too. They both might
go then. I like them, but since they do get along great together (hate to
separate them) and since I can't stand the pee, they may have to go.

Thanks,

Missy

There a animal behaviorists or animal psychiatrists that you can talk to.
Ask you vet and see if he can reccommend anyone. Otherwise let your
&quot;fingers do the walking&quot;, or &quot;clicking&quot; as it is now days look for one in
your area. You may want to try  www.petopia.com ,  www.pets.com ,
www.petsmart.com  or  www.animalwelfare.com
. They may be able to provide some leads.

You can look up &quot;animal behaviorists&quot; or &quot;animal psychiatrists&quot; in your
favorite search engine. I'm sure you will find some leads there too.

You can start with the Nature's Miracle to destroy the odor and she won't be
tempted to go back there. Try also some deterrents like placing tinfoil
over the place where she goes or some of the citrus sprays that are supposed
to be a deterrent. Also maybe one of the 'scat mats' that give a little
'jolt' or sound an alarm when the cat jumps up on it. Scaring her off might
be the best deterrent - use a mousetrap in a paper bag or something that
makes a scary sound.

I'm not clear on what your vet looked for as &quot;signs&quot; of a urinary tract
infection. Was there a urinalysis done? There can be crystals that cause
painful urination without an infection at all.

You definitely need an enzyme cleaner (Nature's Miracle or Simple Solution) to
use on the favorite pee spot. Otherwise it'll smell like &quot;just another
litterbox&quot; to your cats, and they'll return and re-use it.

If it's a flat place (like a bed or couch) you can try getting a length of
plastic carpet runner (usually sold by the foot in hardware stores). This has
little &quot;spikes&quot; on the back to hold it in place on the carpet. Put it spike
side UP over the place you want to protect. Cats don't like to walk on the
little spikes.

If you can afford it, there's something called Feliway. After using the enzyme
cleaner, you spray some Feliway on the spot. It simulates the smell left when a
cat rubs its cheeks on something to &quot;mark&quot; it. Cats don't do cheek rubbing and
peeing on the same spot, so when they smell the &quot;cheek rub smell&quot; they don't pee
there. I hear Feliway works very well.

Please continue to keep up posted!

Feliway is labelled for use &quot;to stop or prevent urinary marking&quot; and &quot;to
comfort the cat in an unknown or stressful environment.&quot; The
&quot;marking&quot; behavior referred to in the product literature is spraying, NOT
other types of inappropriate urination. Feliway is not intended to work as
a simple &quot;deterrent&quot; as described by the previous poster, just FYI.

THat having been said, I decided to try using Feliway for my own cats, one
of whom has an occasional problem with inappropriate urination that is NOT
of the spraying/marking type. This cat just will urinate on any available
bed or futon when she is under severe stress. I've been using the Feliway
for about a month (I got it because she peed on my bed after we
moved...) and so far, so good! But of course, since she's only an
&quot;occasional&quot; bedwetter &lt;g&gt;, it could just be that she hasn't done it again
for her own reasons, unrelated to the Feliway.

I'm intrigued by the concept of Feliway - which is, by the way, a
synthetic analogue of feline facial pheromones (it doesn't smell or
anything). It's possible that it has some anxiolytic activity, according
to what I've read and heard from a few behaviorists. I think the concept
of an aerosolized anxiolytic is pretty nifty :)
