The offer is almost certainly NOT legitimate. Note that the website is in
the United Kingdom, yet refers to US pilot certificates, etc.  It's either a
blatant troll, or a phishing expedition to get personal information.

proper people at Google and such. groups-ab ... @google.com

It always amazes me that people make certain statements when they
have nothing to base their statement on, except their own ignorance.

The offer is open to pilots, worldwide.   Most of the people who would
benefit
are in the US.

The other scam that might be involved is paying for a listing of
addresses. They'll provide addresses of scholarships and grant
providers. Some of the addresses are the same ones you'll find at free
scholarship sights such as www.fastweb.com . Others will be outdated or
incorrect. The bottom line is, they'll charge a fee for these addresses
and promise you the world.

Well, I would classify myself as an expert on online scams: I am
responsible for teaching classes on how to avoid them and for
developing email filters to prevent them from making into our system.

This reeks of a scam.

How do  you determne what  is real and not real?

The only way you can determine if this is real or not is if you get
the grant if you can qualify.

You are not asked for any money.

Every legitimate offer needs a name and address
and in this case, where to send the application.
