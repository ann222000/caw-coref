Hi fam,

While cultivating true empathy and happy curiosity,
let us look at Dr. H's own testimony. If you like
to hear her say the following, contact Sonship Radio
at  &lt;m a z @ s o l c o n . n l&gt; , or any other reliable source.
Its an mp3 recording of her own voice, available.
Here's the transcription of it.

-------------------------------------------------

&quot;...There's nothing that I would call ordinary audition about this at all.
It doesn't really.It's a curious thing that will be very difficult to
explain. Somebody asked me, &quot;Was it as though your hand was moving?&quot; No. I
wrote perfectly voluntarily in response to.I call it a voice, but &quot;a voice&quot;
has sounds...or sounds as though it has something to do with hearing. And I
didn't hear anything. I think it's the sort of hearing that you can't really
describe. It doesn't have anything to do with ears, or waves hitting a drum
or anything on that order. I don't really know, I think maybe I'm using the
wrong word when I say &quot;hear.&quot; I sort of recognized it, it was very rapid, I
could even....if I didn't catch a phrase, I could sort of say, &quot;Would you
mind doing that again?&quot;

...this was strictly mental. Otherwise I would consider it hallucinatory
activity. I don't feel it was that.

...It wasn't my voice. It couldn't have been because it talked about a whole
area with which I am entirely unfamiliar.

...I think &quot;knew&quot; may be a better word than &quot;heard.&quot; I did not know
consciously at the beginning of the sentence how it was going to end. And
that puts me under a further handicap in terms of ordinary language. Because
ordinarily, I think, if you're going to say a sentence you know what it's
going to be, you sort of get the Gestalt immediately. But I didn't. And it
came very easily, very rapidly, very smoothly. I guess even painlessly,
except that it annoyed me to death, but that's irrelevant. I guess &quot;hear&quot;
isn't the right word. I could stop anytime or pick it up anytime, and I did
it in cabs and subways and anywhere, or sort of between telephone calls.

...The only curious thing that I do know, and this is curious, I am used to
doing pretty much what I want to. And I do make my own decisions. But for
some reason or other it never occurred to me not to do this. I thought that
this should be done. I made every effort to keep it without me. I did not
want to intrude on it. And I felt that it was a matter of personal integrity
not to. I really did not interfere with it. I think the thing that I found
upsetting about it was that it went against everything I believe, which is
very hard to do. But...I felt it was much more important. I know what I
believe, but I didn't know what this was going to do next. And I was very
pleased with its coherence, and with its being very consistent, which is
something I would regard as a mandatory criterion. It read very well. And I
know the pain with which I manage to get something to read halfway as well
as that, which is very agonizing. And this came out very quickly. It talked
about a system I don't know anything about, and confused me no end. I'm
still cross-eyed.&quot;

I had a file of Helen speaking at one time, from somewhere.

Don't remember what it was, or where I got it.

I have read that Helen didn't want to be idolized, or made into something
wondeful/famous (like Mary mother of Jesus) because of scribing the course.

Hopefully this won't happen.  Like we won't see videos of her on YouTube.

Hi maz,

I have that audio file of Helen's.. it's terrific.
Someone sent it to me in this last month, maybe
you? It's a small file - easy to download - and I
recommend it as a fine intro to the woman
whose dedication we have to thank for this Course.

Deborah &quot;How on earth did you get your hands on this recording?&quot;

&quot; In this just released new DVD, Dr. William Thetford, Dr. Kenneth
Wapnick and Judith Skutch Whitson discuss their personal memories of
Dr. Helen Schucman, &quot;Scribe&quot; of A Course in Miracles. This film was
produced in 1987 by Bridget Winter during the period that she made
&quot;The Story of A Course in Miracles&quot; and is the only time these three
people shared their views of Helen in such a format.&quot;

What Helen talks about sounds exactly like the creative writing
process described by most book authors. With almost no exceptions they
describe &quot;inner dictation&quot; or &quot;hearing.&quot; A writer's block comes when
they can't &quot;hear.&quot;

It's interesting in a way, like someone who calls me a liar has a fit if
someone does it (or insinuates it) to them.

Not saying you, personally, are condemning anyway, just the overall idea
of it.

I just read where you told Tom he is hawking mugs with course quotes on
them and he used to be a lawyer, I don't know what that means, or
insinuates, but I'm pretty sure you don't need to be a lawyer (now or
anytime) to know it's okay to put course quotes on anything you want and
hawk them.

Over the last few years, especially, I have read several descriptions
of the creative writing process. I wouldnt know where to start to
provide a specific citation. All I can tell you is that authors talk
about the process as being almost like taking down dictation.

I dont know why you would reply with &quot;cite?&quot; But just in case...if you
think I'm diminishing what Helen did, I'm not. In my mind the question
is not about whether A Course in Miracles is just another book or not.
It is about wondering about the source of ALL creative writing. I have
no answer to the question.

Like even a creative genius could say &quot;I didn't quite get that, could
you go over it again&quot;... or could even just put it down and pick it up
again at a later time.  You'd have a hard time prying a creative
genius away from his typewriter when he was right into the swing.
Helen could stop because it wasn't the same thing.  She was doing
someone else's work.  An assignment she accepted, but which she ddin't
allow to interfere with her own personal responsibilities.  And which
didn't overwhelm her to the point where she couldn't.  There was a
definite co-operation between the author of the course, and Helen that
you'll never hear a writer, even a creative genius, describe.

I was surprised by her own voice, though, listening to the audio file.
She was a very strong woman.  But she was strong like a tree that can
bend with the wind.  I don't know how else to describe what I got out
of listening to that audio file.

I think the angel pictures and course quotes are beautiful and add
something good to the world, sharing the course with others.

I have bookmarks someone once gave me with designs on them and course
quotes, from 15-20 years ago, that have a copyright notice and used with
permission. They were quite expensive at the time, like $2.99 each. I don't
know if the FIP or FACIM got anything from the artist making and selling
them, or not.

I once read that Tom put course quotes on women's underwear he was
selling.  The person saying this was outraged about it, but even if it was
true, so what? If it's all illusion and only the love is real, and what's so
bad about underwear, most people do wear it?

&gt; &gt;&gt; What Helen talks about sounds exactly like the creative writing
&gt; &gt;&gt; process described by most book authors. With almost no exceptions they
&gt; &gt;&gt; describe &quot;inner dictation&quot; or &quot;hearing.&quot; A writer's block comes when
&gt; &gt;&gt; they can't &quot;hear.&quot;

&gt; &gt;Cite?

&gt; Over the last few years, especially, I have read several descriptions
&gt; of the creative writing process. I wouldnt know where to start to
&gt; provide a specific citation. All I can tell you is that authors talk
&gt; about the process as being almost like taking down dictation.

&gt; I dont know why you would reply with &quot;cite?&quot; But just in case...if you
&gt; think I'm diminishing what Helen did, I'm not. In my mind the question
&gt; is not about whether A Course in Miracles is just another book or not.
&gt; It is about wondering about the source of ALL creative writing. I have
&gt; no answer to the question.

I've read, on an average, nearly five books
a week for at least the last fifty years. Con-
sequently, I read every author interview and
book review I can get my hands on.

Quite a few authors seem to cite a
sort of &quot;hearing&quot; or &quot;inner dictation,&quot;
but nowhere near the majority, much
less &quot;without exception.&quot;

~Yeah, well it not surprising you make make anti-course comments
supporting the views of anti-course trolls.

Course teachings do not teach creating false images, or lying or
shutting up people.
People do that. And people like you who read a book, and then make
claims on and about ACIM and course teachings.

So why in hell, would you post something that gives the impression
that ACIM teaches lying?

If you write poetry you *must* sound it out, either in your head or out
loud. But is that what Helen was doing? I don't think she fits either the
auditory imaging or classic auditory hallucination models.

I think I read it on the Raj board. If not it came from stuff that
was
written there about Carmen and Tom and them selling stuff with course
quotes
and this was against the guidelines of Jesus, etc, and they should be
banned for
doing it. Which, eventually they were. Were you reading on the TGP
boards (and those the participants who wrote about Tom's quotes and
Carmen's angel pictures) were?

You could go look it up but they might have taken that stuff out of
the
archives, with the least overhaul. Whole threads have disapeared like
they
were never there.

I wrote about it here because it was so funny, but at the same
time
proved a point. What difference does it make where course quotes are
written?

You're really saying I made this up out of nowhere?  oh yeah, you
are one who has outright said you believe I lie, and I keep forgetting
this. What's the point of writing to someone who thinks I lie and
blocks me when they don't like what I say, they might not have an
answer for?

But then I also keep thinking Sheryl is going to write &quot;the
truth&quot; (when she uses that as a topic on her blog, for example) about
her writing me emails about Katie, she later denied and made out I'm
the one who wrote emails about it to her (and she had no part in it
and didn't initiate it) Kind of takes away from her being a wonderful
course teacher, speaker and author, at least for me.

I know, being lied about and called a liar is still good practice
in forgiveness. Forgive, but make choices around it from then on.

As I've said, people do seem to have their own version of reality
and truth.  Always seems to come down to accepting this, as the most
peaceful way. Like I just read Lee saying I had  posted 30 times today
and I counted 17. But, to him it must be 30.

I guess you're right, I don't h ave a clue. Or, I have it and forget
it.

~ Good golly, that is so far from what actually happened you should go
sit in a corner and practice shutting the fuck up.

Jimminy..

That's not the truth about what I said. Is it, Carrie..
And you wonder why people say that you fib?

I wrote, &quot;30/day is kind of alot, don't you think?&quot;
You've hit over 30 on a pretty regular basis, kiddo.

And btw it was 18 today -before- 11 a.m. eastern.
My guess is that if you're short of 30 today, it will
be a white-knuckle and nail-biting achievement.
