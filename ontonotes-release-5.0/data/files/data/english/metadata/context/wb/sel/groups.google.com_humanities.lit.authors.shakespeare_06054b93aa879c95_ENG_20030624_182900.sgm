As Michael Wood's book, In Search of Shakespeare, continues
to stir in critics' pots, I will add reviews to this thread,
as I can; probably not in the order of appearance.

Deconstructing myths
The Guardian

Saturday May 24, 2003

An inclination to puncture hype and disengage from myth was
evident in last week's books pages. In the Sunday Times,
Ferdinand Mount enjoyed Michael Wood's In Search of
Shakespeare, published to accompany the forthcoming BBC
series, even though he didn't learn much. &quot;We still like to
pretend that we have somehow reinvented Shakespeare for
ourselves, that the plays, or many of them, needed
rediscovering, and that 'the man himself remains shrouded in
mystery',&quot; said Mount. Yet &quot;Shakespeare is far from being
almost invisible in the mists of time: indeed, some scholars
have argued that we know more about him than almost any
other Elizabethan who was not of royal or noble birth... Nor
is it true that we don't know what he looked like&quot; - we just
won't accept it. &quot;The trouble is that, by the time of his
death, Shakespeare was not only bald but fat. He looked like
what he was: a prosperous property magnate in the Stratford
district.&quot;

The Bard on the Brain By Paul M Matthews and Jeffrey McQuain
In Search of Shakespeare By Michael Wood

Superhuman Will was a brain specialist testing his fancy
theories on the stage; Will the playwright was an astute,
cautious outsider. John Morrish weighs up the competing
claims of two very different takes on Shakespeare

So many well-intentioned attempts to unite the arts and
science seem to have precisely the opposite effect. The Bard
on the Brain, a glossy collaboration between a
neuro-scientist and a historian of language, is no
exception. &quot;Understanding the Mind Through the Art of
Shakespeare and the Science of Brain Imaging&quot;, to quote the
book's galumphing sub-title, is not one questionable pursuit
but two. And it is difficult to see what they have to say to
each other.

Professor Matthews' field is functional brain imaging, which
means taking pictures of the brain's electrical activity as
it experiences various emotions or undertakes various
activities. The existence of these pictures - a new,
science-based phrenology - is a modern scientific triumph,
vital in cases of brain disorder or damage. They tell us
which parts of the brain light up when we smell things, and
which parts close down when we're depressed. But what they
have to say about the way we think and feel remains to be
seen.

But, then, what does Shakespeare tell us about the mind? In
the great tragedies, starting with Hamlet, characters are
imbued with a self-aware, questioning type of consciousness,
new in drama. A few years on, though, and he seems to have
changed his mind. Now he gives us Leontes, in The Winter's
Tale, whose moods and motivations are both instantaneous and
unfathomable. Was he depicting a different type of mind? Did
he decide the mind was unknowable, after all? Or was he just
in a hurry?

The truth is that to take Shakespeare as a guide through
some of the most advanced of 21st century medical science,
you need to see him through a distinctly 19th century lens.
We are back with Divine Shakespeare, the superhuman analyst
of character and the human soul.

&quot;While his experiments were not designed and executed as are
those of modern brain scientists, the underlying goals had
intriguing similarities,&quot; write Matthews and his
collaborator Jeffrey McQuain. &quot;His laboratory was the
theatre, where he tested his words and refined them until
they communicated powerfully and accurately. Like a modern
brain scientist, he was testing hypotheses...&quot; And so on,
stretching the a metaphor well beyond its natural capacity
to elucidate.

My suspicion is that this book began as a set of
photographs, and Shakespeare only arrived as an
organisational device: a neat and reasonably familiar
package of ruminations on the differences betwen men and
women, madness, depression, physical courage, the senses,
dreaming, memory, language, race, music, love and the
imagination. In a way, any sufficiently prolific creator
might have worked - &quot;Understanding the Mind Through the Art
of Walt Disney&quot; anyone? - but Shakespeare has both range and
insight. He earns his keep here.

What lets this book down is not art but science, or rather
technology. For a book about imaging, the images are
terrible. The thesis is that particular mental states and
processes can be pinpointed to areas in the brain. But the
pictures used to persuade us of this are blocky, pixellated
computer graphics, sometimes manipulated and overlaid with
irrelevancies for &quot;artistic&quot; purposes. And the captions
barely help. It's a shame, because the science is both
impressive and disturbing. Some of it is familiar to we
browsers in the PopSci shelves, but even so, it is
fascinating. Did you know, for instance, that the same part
of your brain is active when you use a tool and when you are
just thinking about using it?

On the other hand, anyone interested in William Shakespeare
the dramatist and human being, rather than superhuman Will,
would do better with Michael Wood's decent, straightforward
biography. Of course, you can always watch the television
series which is the &quot;onlie begetter&quot; of this book (four
hourly episodes, starting on 28 June at 9.10pm on BBC2), but
the book gives you more facts and absolutely no dodgy
reconstructions and dramatisations.

It's a picture book, of course, and the paucity of
biographical detail means that many of the pictures are of
dubious relevance. Early on, we are told at some length
about Shakespeare's early life in a provincial English
Catholic family. To illustrate &quot;the kind of material life to
which Shakespeare's parents aspired&quot;, however, we get a
double page image of a family of Flemish Protestants at
dinner. No doubt television, with its hunger for the visual,
will resort to more of that kind of improvisation.

Searching for Shakespeare has, of course, been a popular
hobby for many years. Michael Wood doesn't get much closer
to his man than anyone else: and at this stage it seems
unlikely that anyone will. There is a gap where the stuff of
biography - particularly television biography - should be.
We don't know, for instance, how Shakespeare found his way
out of Stratford and into the London theatre.

Still, Wood is very solid on the evidence we do have.
There's a heavy emphasis on property records, for that
reason. They show us a strongly Catholic family in
Stratford, and then a whole series of lodgings and houses in
London, and, in the last few years, a serious burst of
property acquisition and provincial empire building.

Wood's is an honest, well-organised account that will serve
the general reader well. You won't find either the
high-flown rhetoric of a Schama or the novelettish
imaginings of a Starkey. Instead, you get a strongly
grounded sense of what it was like to live and work in
London at the turn of the 17th century, making a living by
your wits at the heart of what was almost a police state.

Shakespeare is notoriously a blank canvas upon which we
inscribe our own values and preconceptions: a &quot;happy hunting
ground for minds that have lost their reason&quot;, as someone
says in Ulysses. Wood deals firmly with the lunatic fringe
by ignoring them. His man is an outsider, a near-Catholic,
class-conscious, secretive, politically astute, a
sympathiser with aliens and asylum-seekers, and a man who in
middle age developed a passion for both a Venetian/Jewish
&quot;Dark Lady&quot; and a young aristocratic boy, this latter being
&quot;possibly non-sexual&quot;.

Make that &quot;probably non-sexual&quot;. While Tudor poets were
artistically obsessed with what Walt Whitman later called
&quot;manly love&quot;, the penalties for actual homosexual activity
were extreme, and not likely to have been risked by someone
who was already on the fringes of civil society by virtue of
his profession.

Wood's evidence, however, is a straightforwardly
biographical reading of the Sonnets. He considers the
possibility that they were a &quot;mere literary game&quot;, and
discounts it. Well, he makes a more convincing historian
than he does a literary critic. A series of extremely artful
short poems does not constitute a confession.

But television, inevitably, prefers biography to critical
analysis. It's a pity for the programme makers that
Shakespeare has been so unwilling to cooperate, but hardly
surprising. He was a mystery in life, and remains so. And
the inscription on his tomb, which Wood suggests he may have
composed, was almost a warning to biographers: &quot;Good friend,
for Jesus' sake forebear / To dig the dust enclosed here.&quot;

The Guardian
More by Lyn Gardner

Meet Mr Shakespeare

Do we need to know who the bard really was to understand his
work? Lyn Gardner talks to Michael Wood about his new BBC
series

Michael Wood: 'We have this image of Shakespeare as a ruddy
man quaffing ale. I wanted to show that it's much more
complicated'

In the recent Great Britons series, the legendary theatre
director Peter Brook suggested that the biography of
Shakespeare didn't matter one jot, it is only the plays that
count. The film-maker and life-long Shakespeare fan Michael
Wood thinks that is rubbish. Well, he would wouldn't he,
because he has just completed a four-part BBC2 series called
In Search of Shakespeare, which attempts to put flesh on the
bare bones of Shakespeare's life and show that the world's
greatest playwright was very much a product of his time - a
society in a state of revolution split between an old-world
Catholic sensibility and the Protestant new order, the
medieval and the modern.

The contemporary poet and playwright Ben Jonson declared
that Shakespeare was &quot;not of an age, but for all time&quot;. Wood
sets out to prove that although Johnson was right in the
second, he was wrong in the first: Shakespeare - and the
plays that he wrote - were in fact very much a product of
the turbulent era in which he lived.

Amazingly, while Shakespeare's plays have been regularly
shown on television and there have been dramas and
documentaries speculating on their authorship, there has
never been a full-blown television biography of the national
icon. Perhaps it is not so surprising, because so little is
actually known about his life, particularly the early years.

When Wood first posited the idea, one TV executive sniffed
that it would be rather dull as you would only be able to
film in Stratford-upon-Avon and at the Globe, while an
eminent history scholar pointed out that it was going to
have to be a very short series given the paucity of solid
facts known about Shakespeare's life. That certainly hasn't
stopped Wood, whose series Conquistadors and In the
Footsteps of Alexander the Great have not only been classy
popular TV that never let a lack of facts get in the way of
the spectacular scenery, but have also been acclaimed by
scholars for their historical accuracy.

Even so, Wood admits that the first episode of In Search of
Shakespeare in particular, which takes Shakespeare up to the
age of 19 and his marriage to Anne Hathaway, presented &quot;a
huge technical challenge because we only have three facts
about his early life&quot;.

So Wood turned detective and the result is a history series
with a touch of Inspector Morse, a racy, pacy investigation
which uses primary sources often ignored by Shakespearean
scholars to uncover information about a shadowy figure and
the world he lived in, and to tell a story of family
disgrace, personal tragedy and retrieval of reputation.
There will be some who say there is too much speculation and
not enough fact, and sometimes it does indeed seem like
chasing shadows, but Wood suggests that perhaps Shakespeare
had good reasons for being so guarded and private, in an era
when spies were everywhere and any dissent from the
ascendant Protestantism was ruthlessly wiped out. During the
reign of Elizabeth I, more than 35,000 people were sent to
the scaffold. Shakespeare and his family were not untouched.

The style of In Search of Shakespeare may be lush and
romantic, more Shakespeare in Love than The World at War,
but what makes it radical is the way it rescues Shakespeare
from the heritage industry.

&quot;Of course it's lush,&quot; says Wood. &quot;It is a series about
England. Shakespeare is about Englishness and the national
narrative, but in this case the narrative is not quite what
we think it is. The cunning when making this kind of series
is to make people feel warm and good and then take them
somewhere unexpected, into a world that's different from the
one they thought they were in.&quot;

&quot;We have this image engraved on the national consciousness
of William Shakespeare as a ruddy man quaffing his ale above
a half-timbered cream-tea shop in the Midlands in the reign
of Good Queen Bess. I wanted to show that it was much more
complicated than that.&quot;

Much, much more complicated: there will almost certainly be
plenty of people unwilling to incorporate into the national
narrative the idea of Shakespeare as a quietly sly Catholic
dissident, whose plays reflected a loyalty to the traditions
of his parents and grandparents at a time of cultural
revolution, when a great mass of the population were being
forced to wipe their memories.

If In Search of Shakespeare approaches history sideways on,
offering a history of an era told as a portrait of the
artist as a leading representative of his time, it is also
unusual for the TV history genre in that it completely
eschews the historical re-enactments that have become the
staple of such series. Instead of actors dressed in big
ruffs, Wood offers us real-life, modern-day commentators who
offer a direct conduit between our own age and
Shakespeare's. When a glover talks about his trade, the same
one carried out by Shakespeare's own father, and when
Stratford-upon-Avon's town councillors point out the
similarities in the governance of the town to Shakespeare's
day, it is as if the years have melted away. At its very
best, In Search of Shakespeare makes you feel that you can
reach through your TV screen and touch history.

Of course, in many ways Peter Brook is right, it is
Shakespeare's plays that are important, not the life story
of the man himself, and there is something a little curious
about a series about a playwright that for the first two
episodes makes very little mention of the plays themselves.
Wood entirely accepts that we can watch Twelfth Night
without having any need to know about the contemporary
allusions or why Shakespeare wrote the plays, but argues
that it can be a richer experience if we do. &quot;It makes
Shakespeare more understandable,&quot; he says. &quot;If we know that
he came from a Catholic family, we can understand why he
rewrote anti-Catholic plays such as King John, and how Lear
could be understood by its contemporary audience as a
spiritual commentary and Pericles as a spiritual allegory.&quot;
Wood also dismisses the argument that In Search of
Shakespeare represents the respectable face of our
celebrity-obsessed culture, which makes us more interested
in the writer's life than the plays he wrote.

&quot;I don't think there is anything wrong in trying to locate
the writer in his own time. Omnibus and Arena used to do
that kind of thing a lot. Of course, there is a pressure
when making a series like this not to talk about the
influence of Puritanism on Measure For Measure, but about
the dark Lady of the Sonnets. The truth is that the average
punter probably just wants to know whether Shakespeare loved
his wife and whether he was gay or straight.&quot;

And he concludes: &quot;To a certain extent, you have to go with
that. I am the first person to accept that TV history is
primarily entertainment. But that doesn't mean that you
can't dig deeper too, surprise yourself and the viewer.&quot;

9.10pm, BBC2

Reviews

Amazon.co.uk Review
There can be few more appropriate writers and TV presenters
to go In Search of Shakespeare than Michael Wood. Having
already gone In Search of England and pursued the history of
the Conquistadors in his recent acclaimed series, Wood has
now taken on The Bard in the book to accompany his latest TV
series. This is well-trodden ground, but Wood tells the
story with relish and an historian's eye for detail,
dismissing Bardolatry in favour of a &quot;tale of one man's
life, lived through a time of revolution--a time when not
only England, but the larger world beyond, would go through
momentous changes.&quot;

From Shakespeare's early days in Warwickshire to the
sophisticated world of theatrical life and political
skulduggery in London, Wood makes few claims to new
discoveries, but offers a refreshingly global understanding
of what drove Shakespeare and his creativity, from his
Catholic origins to the Black Londoners that he met every
day. Wood too often has to &quot;enter the realm of diverting
speculation rather than that of verifiable historical fact&quot;.
Did Shakespeare have an affair with Emilia Lanier? Did he
die an alcoholic? Wood colourfully poses such questions,
though too many remain unanswered; he cheerfully admits that
he's no Shakespeare scholar, but a popular historian who has
enthusiastically placed Shakespeare back into the
extraordinarily fertile world that produced him. --Jerry
Brotton

Sunday Telegraph, Jun 8th 2003
Shakespeare's world is brought alive more vividly than in
any other biography of him that I have read.

Sunday Times, Jun 8th 2003
Wood is a perceptive, entertaining and enthusiastic
companion.

Synopsis
Although Shakespeare is the world's greatest writer, his
work familiar all over the world, we know virtually nothing
about the man himself. In &quot;Shakespeare&quot;, historian and
television presenter Michael Wood pieces together a more
convincing portrait of our most famous playwright than was
previously thought possible. The book provides a fresh
narrative of Shakepeare's life, drawing on a wide range of
primary sources. Rather than approaching Shakespeare as an
isolated genius, Michael argues that he was very much a
product of his place and time - a period of great upheaval
that straddled the medieval and modern worlds. In doing so,
Michael reinstates the image of Shakespeare as a thinking
artist, his work based firmly in the religion, politics,
culture and class antagonisms of his day. In this revealing
biography, Michael asks the questions the Shakespeare
industry has previously failed to address.

From the Inside Flap
Almost 400 years after his death, William Shakespeare is
still acclaimed as the world's greatest writer, and yet the
man himself remains shrouded in mystery. In this absorbing
historical detective story, the acclaimed broadcaster and
historian Michael Wood takes a fresh approach to Shakespeare
's life, brilliantly recreating the turbulent times through
which the poet lived: the age of the Reformation, the
Spanish Armada, the Gunpowder Plot and the colonization of
the Americas.

Drawing on an extensive range of sources, Michael Wood takes
us back into Elizabethan England to reveal a man who is the
product of this time - a period of tremendous upheaval that
straddled the medieval and modern worlds. We discover the
roots of Shakespeare's family in the old society of
Warwickshire: new light is shed on his father's changing
fortunes; we see how, during his teens, state terror and
religious divisions played their part in shaping young
William's outlook. Using a wealth of unexplored archive
evidence - including nineteenth-century photographs of Tudor
buildings that survived the Great Fire - the author vividly
conjures up the neighbourhoods of the Elizabethan London
where Shakespeare lived and worked during his glittering
career. We enter the lodgings where he wrote his greatest
plays, and meet the real-life characters who gave him
inspiration for his work; doctors, landladies, musicians,
foreigners and members of London's contemporary black
population.!
New evidence for the dating of the sonnets reveals his
anguished reaction to the death of his only son, allowing us
to get closer than was ever thought possible to the man
himself.

Full of fresh insights and fascinating new discoveries, this
book presents us with a Shakespeare for the twenty-first
century: a man of the theatre, a thinking artist, playful
and cunning, who held up a mirror to his age, but who was
also, as his friend Ben Jonson said, 'not of an age, but for
all time'.

About the Author
Michael Wood was born in Manchester and educated at
Manchester Grammar School and Oriel College, Oxford, where
he did post-graduate research in Anglo-Saxon history. A
broadcaster and film-maker, he is the author of several

This appears to be a review of an older book by the same
title, by Charles Hamilton!

Editorial Reviews
From Library Journal
Hamilton, a manuscript dealer and collector, embarks upon an
old-fashioned excursion into &quot;literary detectivism&quot; in his
latest book. Hamilton uses his experience with penmanship
and documents to glean biographical &quot;discoveries&quot;
(Shakespeare was a lawyer; he was murdered by his daughter
Judith and her husband Thomas Quincy; he served as secretary
or assistant to Francis Bacon and may have written Bacon's
Essays ; etc.). These speculations rest unsteadily upon
dangerous and ill-supported assumptions; Hamilton never
footnotes, and his reading relies overmuch on obscure and
outdated criticism. There are numerous, interesting
illustrations, but the captions sometimes misrepresent the
picture and are infected with the same sloppy scholarship
which damages the text. James Stephenson, George Washington

SHAKESPEARE'S ROOTS
(SHAKESPEARE'S WARWICKSHIRE)

This is a large page. If any of the pictures don't load at
first, just click REFRESH.

This map, reproduced from Michael Wood's recent book In
Search of Shakespeare, shows a number of places which played
a role in Shakespeare's background.
The Shakespeare family began at Balsall, and from there
spread to the adjacent villages of Wroxall, Knowle, Packwood
and Rowington, and in the next generation to Snitterfield.
Packwood, Baddesley Clinton and Lapworth, near to these
villages, were homes of important Catholic families close to
the Shakespeares and the Ardens.

This page shows pictures of these places, with more details
about them. The page also includes a section of pictures
taken at Mary Arden's House, which probably give the best
available impression of life around a country farm.

Michael Wood's TV series In Search of Shakespeare will be
shown on BBC2, commencing 28th June.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Michael Wood writes:

"/>

&quot;The search for Shakespeare starts not in Stratford but a
short way to the North in a tiny cluster of villages in the
Forest of Arden. In the 16th century it was still a vast
tract of forest, part of what the Normans called &quot;beautiful
wild country&quot;, and a completely different world from the
crowded streets of London. Unlike the works of most of his
university-educated contemporaries, Shakepeare's plays are
full of images of flowers, trees and animals. This was a
place to fire the imagination...&quot;.
------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------

For several generations Shakespeare's ancestors, on both his
father's and mother's sides, had been Warwickshire farmers.
The river Avon (shown on the map above) divided Warwickshire
into 2 halves. The North-West half was the old Forest of
Arden. Shakespeare's ancestors all farmed holdings, of
around 100 acres each, all in the Forest of Arden.

The Shakepeare family name originated in Balsall in the
14th Century.
This picture shows present day farmland at Balsall.

This picture is taken looking towards Green Lane which runs
left-to-right behind the trees along the top of the hill.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Michael Wood writes:

"/>

&quot;The Shakespeares' ancestors came from around the village of
Balsall with its old chapel and hall of the Knights
Templars. Down Green Lane, shrouded by thickets of ash and
silver birch, across a ford that runs deep in Winter there
is still a red-brick farm house where Adam of Oldeditch
lived in the 14th Century. His son gave himself the surname
Shakespeare. There were still Shakespeares at Oldeditch 100
years later, and almost certainly the clan descended from
them&quot;.

This is a view along Green Lane, showing the ford referred
to by Michael Wood.

About 200 yards from the ford is the present Oldeditch
Farm House.

This is the view from a field at the rear of Oldeditch
farm house.
The group of buildings in the centre of the picture is the
hall and chapel of the Knights Templar at Balsall, referred
to by Michael Wood.

The white lines running across the picture are power cables.

The manor of Balsall was given by Roger de Mowbray to the
Knights Templar around 1162. This picture shows, on the
left, the hall of the Knights Templar at Balsall, and behind
it the Templar Church of St Mary. Timbers in the hall have
been dated to 1180.
More about the Templars at Balsall:
Temple Balsall.

2 miles from Balsall was the village of Knowle, today a
small town.
The first records of Knowle date from 1200, and refer to
bequests of William de Arden, an ancestor of Mary Arden,
Shakespeare's mother.

This picture shows the Guild House, which dates from 1412.
Thomas Shakespeare of Balsall, became a member of the Guild
here in 1486.

Another view of Knowle Guild House, and the adjacent
Church of St John Baptist, St Lawrence and St Anne.
Michael Wood also lists the members of the Guild here in
1526, which effectively names the principal figures in Arden
Society (more about the Knowle Guild members further down
this page).

Madonna lilies and blood-red roses, about the altar in
Knowle Church.

The Shakespeares of Balsall spread into 4 surrounding
villages - Rowington, Wroxall, Knowle and Packwood.

Richard Shakespeare (born in Wroxall, c1500) left Wroxall
to farm leased land in Bell Lane, Snitterfield (2 miles
North-East of Stratford). Richard Shakespeare farmed here
for 35 years.
This picture, taken from the bottom of Bell Lane, shows
farmland around Snitterfield Church.

This picture shows the farmhouse originally occupied by
Richard Shakespeare. One of Richard's sons, John
Shakespeare, became the father of William Shakespeare. It is
likely that young William Shakespeare would have been a
frequent visitor to this place.
The house has been substantially changed, but does retain
some tudor features.

The house on the opposite side of Bell Lane, aptly named
&quot;Tudor House&quot;, has retained a more traditional appearance.

Just down the road is an authentic half-timbered farm
building, used by the Shakespeares.

This oak tree, in a nearby field, has a huge girth.
Girth is an indicator of age. I wonder if the Shakespeares
knew this tree.

Snitterfield is within easy walking distance of Stratford.
There are good views from Snitterfield. This picture shows
the view looking towards Stratford. You can't actually see
Stratford, because it is hidden behind the Welcombe Hills
(the groups of trees around the obelisk at the right). The
Welcombe Obelisk looks down over Stratford.

Several further ranges of hills can also be seen from here.
Those in this left background are the Ilmington Downs.

The is the church of St James The Great at Snitterfield
On display in Snitterfield Church are copies of parish
records referring to members of the Shakespeare family.
The names in those shown here (dated 1581) are spelt Saxper
and Shaksper.

The land in Snitterfield which Richard Shakepeare farmed was
owned by the Arden Family from Wilmcote, another old
Warwickshire family of yeoman farmers.
This picture shows the Arden's farmhouse at Wilmcote, now
known as Mary Arden's House.

One of Richard's sons, John Shakespeare, who grew up at the
Snitterfield farm, met one of the daughters of the Arden
family, Mary Arden.

Mary Arden's House, and the adjacent farm, Palmer's Farm
(shown here and in the two pictures below), are now
maintained and opened by The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.

The various outbuildings at Mary Arden's House, and
Palmer's Farm are used to house exhibits of medieval rural
and farm life.

This is a wheelwright's shop, in one of the outbuildings.

During the Summer the barns are full of swallows (both
inside the barns, and around the farmyards).
The swallows are continually swooping in and out through the
open doors.

The gardens at Mary Arden's House are meticulously
maintained (see pictures above).
At many places around the garden and around the farmyard are
flowers growing in nooks and crevices. A good example are
these stinging nettles growing by a barn door. This is
exactly how you would expect to see nettles growing in a
real farm. They look completely natural. In some cases you
can't tell the difference between plants that have been put
there by the gardeners, and those growing wild.

To gardeners interested in naturalistic and cottage garden
styles, Mary Arden's House is a very good example to visit.

The lime green surface in the foreground of this picture is
the duckweed-covered farm pond.
This picture is taken from the rear of Palmer's Farm. The
farm buildings in the background are the barns at Mary
Arden's House.

Mary Arden's House is also the base for Heart of England
Falconry.
Demonstrations are staged frequently.

The falconers will also explain to visitors the references
to falconry in Shakespeare's plays.

Here a party of visiting schoolchildren are taking turns to
handle an owl.
The picture just below is a wider view of the same scene.

Just beyond the farmyard are some enclosures with
collections of old varieties of livestock. The cows shown
here are very big animals, and the visitors can get very
close. It's possible to touch the animals.
Mary Arden's house is the least well known of the
Shakespeare houses, but certainly the most interesting to
visit.

John Shakespeare married Mary Arden in Aston Cantlow church,
which was the parish church for Wilmcote, the bride's home.
This picture shows old tombstones, old yew trees, and old
pines in the churchyard of St John the Baptist at Aston
Cantlow.

The interior of Aston Cantlow church is shown in the picture
just below.

There are some more pictures of Aston Cantlow on the Aston
Cantlow Page.

John and Mary Shakespeare went to live in a house in Henley
Street, in Stratford (the Shakespeare birthplace), which is
where their son, William Shakespeare, was born. There are
some pictures of the Shakespeare birthplace, and
Shakespeare's school, on the Stratford-upon-Avon and William
Shakespeare Page.

A mile from the centre of Stratford, and on the edge of the
Forest of Arden, was the village of Shottery, and the home
of Anne Hathaway, who became Shakespeare's wife.

William Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway were married at
Temple Grafton, another village connected with with the
Knights Templar. St Andrew's Church, shown here, is a 19th
Century replacement for an earlier Templar church.
It is believed that Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway were
married here, and not in Stratford, because the priest here,
John Frith, was sympathetic towards a Catholic form of
service, which was not available in Stratford.

This is Packwood House, 2 miles South of Knowle.
The historian Raphael Holinshed lived here as steward until
1580. He was the author of the Chronicles of England, that
were the primary source for Shakespeare's history plays. The

The Beeb Goes in Search of Shakespeare

BBC2 is to launch a major four-art series in Shakespeare on
Saturday nights, starting on 28th June.

In Search of Shakespeare will be presented by historian
Michael Wood (In The Footsteps Of Alexander The Great,
Conquistadors, Art Of The Western World and In Search Of The
Trojan War) and will tell the story of Shakespeare's life.

&quot;To me, it's a wonderful story!&quot; says Wood.&quot;It's a Hollywood
story. If you were going to pitch the 'prequel' to
Shakespeare In Love then you'd say that this is the story of
a little boy who grew up in a Tudor town in a time of
revolution. He had a golden childhood but then everything
collapsed.Will was pulled out of school and lost his chance
to go to university. And, aged 18, he got a 26-year-old
woman pregnant and failed to get an apprenticeship. However,
against all the odds, he went on to become the greatest
writer the world has ever seen!&quot;

The series will not only deal with Shakespeare's meteoric
career, but also his crimes and misdemeanours: his tax
dodging, his life with his French landlady, his love for a
beautiful boy, and his sexual passion for a black musician.

&quot;Through history,we can get to Shakespeare's feelings, his
participation in events and his life experiences,&quot; Wood
adds. &quot;Through the real, living thing,we are trying to get
to the past.&quot;

Gregory Doran and members of the RSC will take part in the
programmes, not only performing in the sort of venue
Shakespeare new (they will do part of Henry V in a Tudor inn
yard in Gloucester &quot;with all the galleries still intact,&quot;
but arriving and setting up, just as Shakespeare and his
fellow actors would have done.

A hardback book of the same title, which accompanies the
series, is published by BBC Worldwide, priced at £20.The
series is also available on DVD and VHS.

In Search of Shakespeare by Michael Wood

THERE ARE many books on Shakespeare by professional
academics that are
full of bright ideas and interesting information, but which
lack the arts
of the man himself: bringing characters and places to life,
grabbing
the audience through story-telling, transforming complex
intellectual
debates into the immediacy of drama.

Michael Wood, by contrast, works in television, so he knows
that
he must always begin with an image and a story. In Search
of Shakespeare was written in conjunction with his
forthcoming
four-part series on BBC2. It is a great pleasure to report
that,
thanks to the author's gifts as story-teller, populariser
and
interpreter of the past, Shakespeare's world is brought
alive more
vividly than in any other biography of him that I have read.

Wood begins with the wonderfully evocative image of John
Shakespeare, the dramatist's father, reluctantly overseeing
the
destruction of the medieval paintings that covered the walls
of the guild chapel next door to the Stratford-upon-Avon
grammar school. By government edict, this town councillor,
who undoubtedly held fast to the Catholic faith himself, was
limewashing - literally whitewashing - history.

The image sets up Wood's central theme of William
Shakespeare
as a man caught between the old world and the new,
creating his dramas out of the age's great debates between
tradition and innovation, established institutions and the
autonomy of the individual, Catholicism and Protestantism.

Wood is rightly sceptical of the recent theory that
Shakespeare
spent the &quot;lost years&quot; of his early manhood in a recusant
household in Lancashire. But he brings forward a wealth
of evidence linking the Shakespeares to the old Catholics of
Warwickshire. His mother's family, the Ardens, were among
the county's most distinguished Papists, while a kinsman
called
Robert Debdale was closely linked to Edmund Campion's
ill-fated
mission to restore England to the old faith.

Debdale died on the scaffold in 1586; Wood has an excellent
account of how, some 20 years later, Shakespeare made use in
King Lear of a pamphlet about him which was published under
the fearsome title A Declaration of Egregious Popish
Impostures to withdraw the Hearts of her Majesty's Subjects
from their Allegiance and from the Truth of the Christian
Religion
professed in England, under the Pretence of Casting out
Devils.

All the latest professional scholarship on the question
of Shakespeare and Catholicism is effectively incorporated
in the book,
but where Wood has made genuine finds of his own is in the
area
of the dramatist's day-to-day life. There is a marvellous
account, neatly linked to the great &quot;sheep-shearing&quot; scene
in The Winter's Tale, of exactly what was involved in John
Shakespeare's shadowy dealings as a &quot;brogger&quot;, or illegal
trader in wool.

Wood is also nicely sensitive to William's use of
Warwickshire
dialect words and farming terms: &quot;kecksies&quot; for children's
whistles made of grass, &quot;breeze&quot; as a noun meaning gadfly,
&quot;ear&quot; as a verb meaning to plough, &quot;hade land&quot; for the turn
at
the top of a furrow made by a plough team. In the light of
such
details, it is hard to see how any sane person could go on
believing that the plays were written by an aristocrat in
disguise rather than the country boy from the Midlands.

Best of all are the sections of the book where Wood traces
Shakespeare's footsteps in London. With the help of maps
showing you in which streets he lodged and who his next-door
neighbours were, together with some remarkable Victorian
photographs of 16th-century tenements that remained standing
in the city for 400 years, we are introduced to the
topography
of Shakespeare's London and the splendid cast of East End
characters who inhabited it - exiled Huguenots, black
servingmen,
Sephardic Venetian Jews. No wonder the plays show such
interest
in the figure of the alien - the Jew, the Moor, the &quot;savage
and deformed slave&quot; Caliban.

Wood sustains his energy all the way through the story.
He convincingly argues that it was through the Digges
brothers,
stepsons of a Stratford gent called Thomas Russell (overseer
of Will's will), that the dramatist got his material for The
Tempest - they helped to finance the ill-fated Bermuda
voyage
that was the starting-point for the play. And he is good on
the
plays that Shakespeare wrote in collaboration with John
Fletcher
from 1612 to 1614, at the very end of his career.

I had not registered before that Shakespeare and Fletcher's
Henry VIII, which dramatises the divorce from Katharine of
Aragon, was performed in the very place where the historical
divorce hearing was held: Shakespeare's indoor theatre, the
Blackfriars, was originally the monastery where Henry's
ecclesiastic
court had sat.

But nobody's perfect. Wood makes a number of factual slips,
as
when Hamlet is said to be influenced by the theory of the
humours in Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, a book written
many
years later. And there are many dubious inferences: the
portrait at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge of a glamorous
young Elizabethan gentleman is most unlikely to be
Christopher
Marlowe; there is no evidence that Shakespeare himself
played
the parts of John of Gaunt in Richard II and the king in
Henry
IV; the fable of the body-politic in Coriolanus almost
certainly
comes from a classical source and not a pamphlet produced by
the radical &quot;Diggers&quot; of Warwickshire; and so on.

It is regrettable that the popularising format of the book
did not allow for proper referencing which would allow the
reader to
separate the hard evidence from the speculation.

Wood also underestimates the importance of Shakespeare's
first
patron, the Earl of Southampton, and makes a rather
unconvincing attempt to revive A. L. Rowse's theory that the
poet
Emilia Lanyer was the dark lady of the sonnets. But we must
forgive him his occasional self-indulgence in sheer
gratitude
for the wealth of incidental detail he records.

I was especially pleased to learn that Sir Thomas Lucy of
Charlcote,
just outside Stratford, had a &quot;coney&quot; (rabbit) warren. The
old story that Shakespeare had to leave home in a hurry
because he had been caught poaching deer, has often been
dismissed on the grounds that Sir Thomas had no deer park.
But Wood brings forward new evidence that coneys for the pot
were big business in 16th-century Warwickshire and that
poaching them was a serious crime. There is something very
satisfying in the idea that Shakespeare headed off to London
and a career in the theatre because he was in trouble over
some rabbits.

IN SEARCH OF SHAKESPEARE. By Michael Wood. BBC. Pounds 20.
pp352

As the sun was rising over the forests of Sierra Leone on a
September morning in 1607, African dignitaries on board HMS
Dragon were being entertained by a performance of Hamlet.
Those whose English was not up to it could listen to a
running
paraphrase in Portuguese. Further down the coast, the
players
did Richard II. Already, only a few years after their first
performance, Shakespeare's plays and their author had
reached
out to the world. By the time Samuel Pepys wrote his diary,
40 years after the poet's death, many were entrenched in
the repertoire - Othello, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer
Night's
Dream, The Merry Wives of Windsor, Twelfth Night.

Pepys saw Hamlet four times, on the last occasion recording
that he was &quot;mightily pleased with it&quot; and that Betterton as
the
Prince was &quot;the best part, I believe, that ever man acted&quot;.
Yet we still like to pretend that we have somehow reinvented
Shakespeare for ourselves, that the plays, or many of them,
needed rediscovering, and that &quot;the man himself remains
shrouded in mystery&quot;, to quote the blurb of Michael Wood's
biography, published to accompany his forthcoming BBC
series.
How could this obscure Midlander, who only went to grammar
school, have written the immortal works attributed to him?
Surely
the real author must be a university wit such as Marlowe,
or a statesman such as Bacon, or a toff such as Lord Oxford,
perhaps even the Queen...

Snobbery breeds strange fantasies, and I am afraid these
illusions will long outlive Wood's evocative and
occasionally
enchanting retelling of the known facts - which are, in
reality,
numerous. Shakespeare is far from being almost invisible in
the
mists of time: indeed, some scholars have argued that we
know
more about him than almost any other Elizabethan who was
not of royal or noble birth. His father, John Shakespeare
the glover, much of whose wealth came from &quot;brogging&quot;
(illegal
dealings in wool), was a substantial citizen in Elizabethan
Stratford.

We can still see the poet's birthplace, the church where he
was baptised and buried, and even the schoolroom he attended
over the Guildhall in Stratford. Wood points out that it is
an anachronism to imagine that Stratford grammar was a
bog-standard institution - the headmasters were graduates
of Oxford or Cambridge, and were paid more than the head of
Eton. We all remember that Ben Jonson said &quot;Shakespeare had
small Latin and less Greek&quot;, but this was only an old
sparring
partner's sideswipe in the course of a eulogy that
proclaimed
that Shakespeare far outshone his contemporaries and was
worthy to be compared only with Aeschylus, Sophocles and
Euripides. In reality, as Wood shows, Shakespeare had read
as
widely as any playwright in history.

Nor is it true that we don't know what he looked like. Wood,
like many of his predecessors, wants &quot;to get rid of the
received
image of Shakespeare as a balding middle-aged man in a
ruff -
an establishment figure&quot;, so he reproduces the so-called
Grafton portrait of a goofy young man, which turned up in
a house in Darlington in 1906, and the &quot;Chandos portrait&quot;,
in the
National Portrait Gallery, which shows a furtive, swarthy
character
with an earring (more like one's idea of a Maltese pimp than
the Swan of Avon), but not the coloured memorial bust in
Stratford church of a balding middle-aged man in a ruff.

Nobody likes this bust. Yet it was done for the people who
knew him best only a few years after his death, and it bears
a clear
and close resemblance to the engraving that adorns the first
folio - the same high, bulging forehead, with the sleek
wings of
hair, and the moustache-shaped lips. Jonson himself says,
in a little poem opposite the engraving, how well &quot;the
Graver hath
hit his face&quot;. The trouble is that, by the time of his
death,
Shakespeare was not only bald but fat.

He looked like what he was: a prosperous property magnate in
the Stratford district. Wood bravely tries to rescue a few
shreds
of romance by evoking with some brilliance the sleazy
bohemian
quarter in present-day London Wall where Shakespeare
lodged (he stood witness in a matrimonial case involving
his landlady's daughter) and where Wood sees him desperately
scribbling tragedies by the light of a guttering candle
after
having had a skinful in the stews and taverns in which his
fellow
thespians spent much of their time murdering one another.

But the great Shakespeare scholar Stanley Wells points out,
in his recent Shakespeare for All Time, that by 1597
Shakespeare, still only 33, had bought Stratford's second
largest house, New Place. Why would he not take every
possible
opportunity to spend time there? Far from being estranged
from Anne Hathaway, he might well have brought up their
children
with her.

On the question of whether Shakespeare was a secret Catholic
like his father - now much discussed, especially among
Catholics - Wood is at his eloquent best. He describes
vividly
the insecurity of the changing times, the shaky hold that
Protestantism had upon ordinary Warwickshire folk and the
strong
influence of recusant priests upon the local gentry (most of
the Gunpowder plotters were Midlanders). Even if Shakespeare
himself was not a recusant, which Wood doubts, his
imagination was drenched in all the dearly loved images and
rituals of the old faith, to an extent matched by no later
English
poet. Wood is dubious, too, about the popular theory that
Shakespeare spent his so-called &quot;lost years&quot; among
Lancashire
Catholic players, thinly disguised as one Shake-shafte
(which
was, as it happens, quite a common name up north). It is
surely more probable, as argued here, that he spent most of
the
years between 1582 and 1592 learning his trade, like many
another actor, as a stage dogsbody, prompting,
understudying,
shifting scenery.

Wood does stray now and then into cliche. We are told in
quick
succession, for example, that with Hamlet, Shakespeare
&quot;pulled another rabbit out of the hat&quot; and &quot;shifted the
goalposts&quot;.
And, as with all television spin-offs, he cannot resist the
dismal compulsion to talk down to his audience, dragging in
references to Harry Potter and East-Enders. But when he
forgets
the mission to dumb down, Wood is a perceptive, entertaining
and enthusiastic companion. His account of the late plays (A
Winter's Tale and The Tempest) conjures a poignant farewell
to a playwright we would love to have known, even if he was
an
overweight commuter who may even have stuck with his wife.

Is Shakespeare Dead - Mark Twain

The next addition to the young Shakespeare's Stratford history
comes easy. The historian builds it out of the surmised deer-
stealing, and the surmised trial before the magistrate, and the
surmised vengeance-prompted satire upon the magistrate in the play:
result, the young Shakespeare was a wild, wild, wild, oh SUCH a
wild young scamp, and that gratuitous slander is established for
all time! It is the very way Professor Osborn and I built the
colossal skeleton brontosaur that stands fifty-seven feet long and
sixteen feet high in the Natural History Museum, the awe and
admiration of all the world, the stateliest skeleton that exists on
the planet. We had nine bones, and we built the rest of him out of
plaster of paris. We ran short of plaster of paris, or we'd have
built a brontosaur that could sit down beside the Stratford
Shakespeare and none but an expert could tell which was biggest or
contained the most plaster.

We set down the five known facts by themselves, on a piece of paper,
and numbered it &quot;page 1&quot;; then on fifteen hundred other pieces of paper
we set down the &quot;conjectures,&quot; and &quot;suppositions,&quot; and &quot;maybes,&quot; and
&quot;perhapses,&quot; and &quot;doubtlesses,&quot; and &quot;rumors,&quot; and &quot;guesses,&quot; and
&quot;probabilities,&quot; and &quot;likelihoods,&quot; and &quot;we are permitted to thinks,&quot;
and &quot;we are warranted in believings,&quot; and &quot;might have beens,&quot; and &quot;could
have beens,&quot; and &quot;must have beens,&quot; and &quot;unquestionablys,&quot; and &quot;without
a shadow of doubts&quot; -- and behold! MATERIALS? Why, we had enough to
build a BIOGRAPHY of Shakespeare!
-------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; Amazingly, while Shakespeare's plays have been regularly

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; shown on television and there have been dramas and
&gt; documentaries speculating on their authorship, there has
&gt; never been a full-blown television biography of the national
&gt; icon. Perhaps it is not so surprising, because so little is
&gt; actually known about his life, particularly the early years.

&gt; When Wood first posited the idea, one TV executive sniffed
&gt; that it would be rather dull as you would only be able to
&gt; film in Stratford-upon-Avon and at the Globe, while an
&gt; eminent history scholar pointed out that it was going to
&gt; have to be a very short series given the paucity of solid
&gt; facts known about Shakespeare's life. That certainly hasn't
&gt; stopped Wood, whose series Conquistadors and In the
&gt; Footsteps of Alexander the Great have . . .
&gt; . . . never let a lack of facts get in the way of
&gt; the spectacular scenery,
&gt; Even so, Wood admits that the first episode of In Search of
&gt; Shakespeare in particular, which takes Shakespeare up to the
&gt; age of 19 and his marriage to Anne Hathaway, presented &quot;a
&gt; huge technical challenge because we only have three facts
&gt; about his early life&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So Wood turned detective and the result is a history series
&gt; with a touch of Inspector Morse, a racy, pacy investigation
&gt; which uses primary sources often ignored by Shakespearean
&gt; scholars to uncover information about a shadowy figure and
&gt; the world he lived in, and to tell a story of family
&gt; disgrace, personal tragedy and retrieval of reputation.
&gt; There will be some who say there is too much speculation and
&gt; not enough fact, and sometimes it does indeed seem like
&gt; chasing shadows, but Wood suggests that perhaps Shakespeare
&gt; had good reasons for being so guarded and private, in an era
&gt; when spies were everywhere and any dissent from the
&gt; ascendant Protestantism was ruthlessly wiped out. During the
&gt; reign of Elizabeth I, more than 35,000 people were sent to
&gt; the scaffold. Shakespeare and his family were not untouched.

Shakespeare satires the powerful Cecil family (in charge of all those
spies) and the Stratman &amp; his family were untouched. . .that sorta tells you
something.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The style of In Search of Shakespeare may be lush and
&gt; romantic, more Shakespeare in Love than The World at War,
&gt; but what makes it radical is the way it rescues Shakespeare
&gt; from the heritage industry.

&gt;&quot;Of course it's lush,&quot; says Wood.

&gt; Much, much more complicated: there will almost certainly be

&gt; Hamilton, a manuscript dealer and collector, embarks upon an

Perhaps reading h.l.a.s. makes us too sensitive to unsupported

a mixture of fact and speculation is like walking on thin ice; without
references, it is like doing it blindfold. One falsehood accepted does

&gt; Wood is also nicely sensitive to William's use of
&gt; Warwickshire dialect words and farming terms:
&gt;&quot;kecksies&quot; for children's whistles made of grass,

"/>

The use by Shakespeare is from Henry V:
But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,
Losing both beauty and utility.

That is clearly NOT a reference to &quot;children's whistles
made of grass&quot;. The OED defines the term as &quot;a
hollow plant-stem&quot;, although it's not easy to see how
it got that. It gives 'kecks' as a term for umbellifers
-- very common, ugly weeds which often have a
poisonous sap in their hollow stems. ('Kecks' is also
a Scouse (Liverpool) word for trousers -- not mentioned
in OED(1) -- there may be a connection with a sense
of 'hollow tube'.) Shakespeare's use is clearly a
reference to common weeds (and not parts or uses of
them) here almost certainly umbellifers. Those weeds
would never make whistles. 'Kecksies' in Henry V
seems to be no more than a variation on 'kecks'.
The OED shows uses of 'kecksies' similar to those
in Henry V from Coleridge (who grew up in the West
Country) and as quoted in a glossary for S.W.
Lincolnshire. Whatever it may be, Wood / Bate have
got it all wrong.

Score: Wood / Bate -1

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;breeze&quot; as a noun meaning gadfly,

"/>

The OED shows this as oldest use of the word and
common in Early English (an occurrence in 800); it
shows a derivation: 'sea-breeze', for a parasite infecting
some fish; it even mentions figurative senses; and it
quotes uses by Chaucer, Spenser and Holland.

Score: Wood / Bate -2

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;ear&quot; as a verb meaning to plough,

"/>

The OED shows this as a very common early word
of Teutonic origin (with parallels in many European
languages); an instance recorded in 898, and many
later, including in Pilgrim's Progress, Harrison and
Holland.

Score: Wood / Bate -3

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;hade land&quot; for the turn at the top of a furrow made by
&gt; a plough team.

"/>

This is in 2H4 (quarto only) in a scene set in Justice
Shallow's house in Gloucestershire. It is full of local
references and terms -- and has lots of strange and
apparently pointless disparaging references to
various 'Williams' (William Cooke, William Visor of
Woncot (&quot;an arrant knave&quot;). It also brings in all
manner of detailed day-to-day arrangements in a
rural farm.

At a minimum, the poet had done his homework on
rural farming terms. (The OED suggests that 'hade
land' is a fairly common term for the gaps between
ploughed sections of land. It disputes the existence
of the sense given by Wood / Bate.) But since 'Wilmcot'
is a local village to Stratford-upon-Avon and since
'William Cooke' attended 'Hinckley Fayre' (on an edge
of Warwickshire furthest from Gloucester) it is quite
likely that he was casting aspersions on a specific
rural uneducated William from Warwickshire -- as he
so often does in other plays.

There may, in addition, be glances at the 'Cooke'
family of the poet's mother-in-law. She was Mildred
Cooke, one of the four highly learned daughters of
Sir Anthony Cooke. All married well (Lord Keeper
Nicholas Bacon, Sir Thomas Hoby, and Henry
Killigrew) and helped to make Burghley's house a
centre of sophisticated learning (no better house
could be imagined for the education of the young
Shakespeare). Sir Anthony Cooke was strongly
Protestant -- a Marian refugee to Strasbourg. He
was a Cambridge man, tutor to Edward VI, and close
friend of Thomas Smith, Oxford's tutor. However, it
must have hurt the 17th Earl to be married into mere
'cooks'. The 'William Cooke' may well point at his
father-in-law, Burghley.

Wood / Bate naturally see none of this, nor do they
seem to have studied the text of the play. If they did,
they had no sensitivity to the language of this scene.
But, at least, they make no obvious, crude mistakes
here. Maybe they'd pass an 'O' level -- if they worked
hard.

Score: Wood / Bate -3.5

And THAT'S IT -- the sum of centuries of Strat
scholarship on the authorship of the canon !

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the light of such details, it is hard to see how any sane person
&gt; could go on believing that the plays were written by an aristocrat
&gt; in disguise rather than the country boy from the Midlands.

Isn't it great to see true scholars at work. You
really know that you are in the presence of the

greatly loved Io, and changed her into a white cow or heifer from fear
of Hera or Juno; to FLEE from whom she swam across the strait, which
was thence called bos poros, the passage of the cow. Hera discovered
the trick, and sent a gadfly to torment Io, who was made to wander,

FT WEEKEND MAGAZINE - BOOKS ESSAY: Some are born great
By Michael Wood
Financial Times; Jun 28, 2003

For the past couple of years I have been working on a
documentary life of Shakespeare for television: something
that, surprisingly, has not been done before. It has been a
daunting task. History on television thrives on
storytelling, on incident and on character, but
Shakespeare's biography seems to fall short on all counts.
This is a man, after all, whose first 28 years could be
written on the back of a postage stamp, and whose reticence
about himself in his later works almost suggests a
deliberate act of self-concealment. The 10 years between his
marriage and his emergence as a playwright in London have so
far yielded only three documents: two of them the baptismal
records of his children - Susanna, the eldest, and his twins
Judith and Hamnet - the third is the record of a court case
in which he and his parents tried to recover family property
lost when his father's business collapsed. So for more than
half of his life - the years that made him - the biographer
is forced to see Shakespeare through the eyes of those
around him. It was not for nothing that Tom Stoppard in
Shakespeare in Love went to the poet's own plots to give him
a private life.

For the filmmaker then, the problems are not only the usual
ones of style and content, but also the sources of the
narrative itself. There are many fine books on Shakespeare,
but as yet no professional scholar has produced a biography
locating him in his time and place in a way that has
commanded broad agreement. In particular, no one yet agrees
on that crucial matter for 16th- century people,
Shakespeare's religious affiliation.

It is not surprising, then, that in the public eye
Shakespeare's biography is peculiarly unstable. Theories
that he was really Marlowe, Bacon or the Earl of Oxford
still abound - more documentaries have been made about the
authorship controversy than about the man himself. It has to
be said that these are all nonsense. But the fact that there
is such a controversy at all tells us something important
about the problem.

Many people think that this does not matter - that the plays
are the thing. Recently on the BBC's Great Britons, the
theatre director Peter Brooke said as much: the details of
Shakespeare's life were essentially irrelevant. He is a
universal genius whose works stand out of time.
Shakespeare's openness, his &quot;negative capability&quot; as Keats
put it, becomes a blank cheque on which we write our
fantasies, and to an extent that is what happened to the
Bard during the 19th century. But no writer or artist can
ever be outside his era. So the question is, how exactly do
we place Shakespeare in his time?

In any kind of history film, there is a choice of approach.
In our films, we did not go for dramatisation, but for
living witnesses, along with the real documents and places.
Having made films in Peru and Afghanistan, for instance, we
have discovered that 500 years is not necessarily a long
time. Even in England, connections to the past exist.
Shakespeare's father was a glover, so we interview the last
master glover in Worcestershire - who still sews by hand in
the traditional way. It was fascinating to have the Windsor
Herald explaining Shakespeare's application to be a
gentleman, and the royal robe-maker gave a fantastic insight
into some &quot;scarlet red cloth&quot; that Shakespeare had ordered -
there were different colours according to rank. The cloth
was for his livery for James I's coronation, about which he
writes in somewhat acerbic terms in the Sonnets. In this
way, living witnesses can cast light on even well- known
documents.

Shakespeare was born in 1564, only five years or so into the
reign of Elizabeth I. In the previous 12 years, the state
religion in England had gone from the hard-line
Protestantism of Edward VI to the persecuting Catholicism of
Queen Mary, and then back to Protestantism. The first 10
years of Shakespeare's life saw an uneasy live-and-let-live,
before a crisis began to develop in the late 1570s, by which
time he had left school. In the aftermath of the Armada
(1588) the establishment triumphed, and the Old Faith was
reduced to a minority, save in certain areas such as
Lancashire.

So Shakespeare's formative years were a time poised between
two worlds, between the old and the new. How that translates
at a local level we can see in the very rich documents that
survive for his town and region. South Warwickshire was a
strongly Catholic area, especially in the villages in the
Forest of Arden, where both his parents were born to
long-established farming families loyal to the Old Faith.
Government spies' reports astonishingly show a dozen old
Marian priests still working as vicars in Arden in 1585, one
of whom may well have married William and Anne Hathaway. In
Stratford, the town's corporation had many sympathisers with
the Old Faith, and during the time Shakespeare's father
served as constable, alderman and bailiff (mayor) they
delayed as long as possible in removing Catholic murals,
glass and vestments; some paintings they never destroyed. Of
the six schoolmasters at the grammar school during
Shakespeare's youth, four were Catholic sympathisers.

This mirrors the national situation. It was a time of &quot;no
longer and not yet&quot;, half-Protestant, half-Catholic, and
this is the key to Shakespeare's outlook. His parents were
rooted in the old society of Arden. His grandfather Robert
Arden's will of 1556 is strongly Catholic; his father John
appears on a list of Catholic recusants in 1592; his
daughter Susannah was summonsed for refusing to take Easter
Communion as late as 1606. The family's story looks like the
story of all English people in the 16th century, in
microcosm.

That the Bard's family was tainted by Catholicism has been
difficult for the establishment to accept. The dust has not
yet settled on the religious conflicts of the 16th and 17th
centuries, and for the Victorians, especially, the idea that
the Bard grew up a Catholic was &quot;unthinkable&quot;. Gentle
Shakespeare had to be C of E, straight, conservative and a
family man. But he now emerges surely as a much more
interesting and ambiguous figure: concealment was not only
part of his art, but part perhaps of a pattern in his life
too. It is intriguing, for example, that during 25 years of
lodging in London, with as many as eight addresses indicated
in our sources, he is never picked up in the lists of
Protestant church attendance, even in places - such as the
Liberty of the Clink in Southwark - where church attendance
was compulsory.

All this suggests that as a young man he moved in both
worlds, like many of his generation of artists, poets,
musicians and writers. We can tell from his plays that the
knowledge of the old rituals learned at his mother's knee
never left him - for instance, the rituals of All Soul's
Night in Richard III. But in his case, the persistence of
such private loyalties may have been more a matter of
choice. A sensational discovery reinforces this idea. It
concerns Shakespeare's most enigmatic poem, &quot;The Phoenix and
Turtle&quot;, published in 1601 in a strange collection of verse
called Love's Martyr. This work, which Peter Levi thought
the greatest short poem in the English language, has defied
all attempts at explanation. But we now know it was a
memorial poem for Mrs Anne Line, a Catholic widow executed
at Tyburn in February 1601. The poem describes a ritual
commemoration of the dead person, and may have been recited
at the secret burial service of Mrs Line held by her
supporters, with music by William Byrd, another adherent to
the Old Faith.

This discovery is nothing short of electrifying. It shows us
that in mid-career, in the year in which he staged Twelfth
Night, and the last version of Hamlet, Shakespeare was not
only sympathetic to such a tragic figure as Mrs Line, but
well-connected with the noble and intellectual circles of
Catholicism. Even so, a couple of years later an
unidentified Catholic writer would reject the secular agenda
of his plays almost as a betrayal of the cause.

Such discoveries and reappraisals make Shakespeare more
human, more moving, more understandable - and more
admirable. Many apparent problems in the biography may
become clearer, including Shakespeare's self-effacing stance
as an artist. His characteristic quality, his empathy - his
feeling for the &quot;stranger's case&quot; - is all the more
explicable in someone who came from the increasingly
marginalised and persecuted minority. &quot;How careful was I,
when I took my way,&quot; he wrote in the Sonnets. Now we begin
to see why. And the world he represents with such
affection - old England with its good and bad kings, old
friars and holy women - is of course the world he had lost.
More even than we could have guessed, he is English history.
In his life and work, he embodies the conflicts of his time,
the Cultural Revolution of the 16th century.

Does this help further to explain his enduring popularity
across the world?

His plays touch on issues of their day - Measure for Measure
on the Puritan reaction of 1604, for example; King Henry
VIII the Catholic debate in the court in 1613 - but the
greatest have resonated across cultures and languages ever
since. I wonder whether here, too, the background of his
turbulent times has added to the power of his work for later
generations.

England was a traditional society in around 1530 when
Shakespeare's father was born. In the next 70 years, it was
one of the first societies to go through the enforced change
to modernity, when not only the old beliefs and rituals, but
the old language were discarded. It was a time when &quot;the
coherence was gone&quot;, as another former Catholic, John Donne,
would put it.

Shakespeare's greatest plays are about this split. Since his
day, all societies have gone through this change, as
modernity takes root and wipes out the old patterns of
custom and belief, encoded identities built over hundreds, ...

TV review

The old ones are the best

Rupert Smith
Monday June 30, 2003
The Guardian

(snip)
Michael Wood, who set off In Search of Shakespeare on BBC2
(Saturday) went too far the other way, delivering the most
mundane facts about his subject with lashings of excitement
and reverence. The news that Shakespeare's father was
involved in a bit of illicit wool-trading isn't really the
most illuminating of discoveries, but from the enthusiasm
with which Wood exposed his fleecy findings you'd think he'd
just unearthed an unpublished play. Wood made a persuasive
case for Shakespeare's Catholic sympathies, but never
attempted to explore the impact they had on his works; by
the end of the programme, Shakespeare's total literary
output amounted to one lousy poem to his wife.

Wood is to be admired for grasping the nettle of Shakespeare
biography, and we can expect some good stuff on the writer's
adult sexuality, but on the evidence of the first show there
was little to counter the argument that Shakespeare's life
barely merits investigation. Unlike Christopher Marlowe, who
seemed almost to transcribe his life into his plays,
Shakespeare disappears behind his characters, a shadowy
presence at best. There was enough juicy Elizabethan
intrigue and Popish plotting to keep the TV history audience
watching, but In Search of Shakespeare seemed most gripping
when it was furthest from its subject.
