Editorial

A large-scale strike in the metalworking industry is to begin tomorrow,
featuring a march in Johannesburg. At Eskom, the employer is offering a 9%
increase to some workers. Many other items of interest to the working class
have been covered in the media this weekend, including the SACP’s 5-year
Congress which is due to begin this week in Port Elizabeth.

524252C382820&gt; 1.1 Metalworkers to strike

SAPA, IOL, 8
July 2007
The two largest trade unions in the metal- and engineering industry, Numsa
and Solidarity, will on Monday launch &quot;probably the largest strike in the
private sector&quot; this year.

Solidarity deputy general secretary Dirk Hermann said 260 000 employees at
more than 9 000 companies were to take part in the strike.

Negotiations between the trade unions and the employers' organisations in
South Africa's largest bargaining council, the metal- and engineering
bargaining council, failed over the weekend, Hermann said.

The employers are offering between 7,3 percent and 7,8 percent and the trade
unions are demanding 10 percent.

Thousands of employees will take part in a march in Johannesburg on
Monday. - Sapa

offers 9% wage hike for lowest-paid workers

Mariaan Olivier, Engineering News, 5 July 2007
Electricity producer Eskom has increased its wage offer for its lowest-paid
workers from an initial 6% to 9%, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM)
said on Thursday afternoon.

Spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka said that Eskom had increased its offer, but
noted that it was not a final offer and that a “tough round” of negotiations
was still lying ahead.

He also confirmed that the union was prepared to lower its demands of 12%.

&lt; http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3921406 &gt; 1.3 Fidentia
leaves miners' widows in dark

Thembisile Makgalemele , Saturday Star, 7 July 2007
Every month, desperate miners' widows whose pensions have dried up are
making the long haul from Mozambique, Malawi, Lesotho and Zimbabwe to the
offices of the Mineworkers' Provident Fund (MPF) offices in Joburg to find
out what has gone wrong.

But each time they are leaving empty-handed, due to the Fidentia collapse
that saw R1,47-billion of widows' and orphans' money disappear. Millions of
rands was spent by the company on buying up businesses, as well as to fund
the high life of Fidentia's bosses.

A secret inquiry has begun in Cape Town, with court-appointed curators
interrogating the various Fidentia role-players in a bid to track down the
missing money. Their aim is to recover as much money as possible to ensure
that the pensions which most miners' widows rely on to feed, clothe and
educate their children continue to be paid.

But that is cold comfort for the women who make the long trek to Joburg to
collect their monthly pensions. Many are unaware of what has transpired and
have never heard of Fidentia or the scandal - one of the biggest corporate
misappropriations of funds ever in South Africa.

Some have had to borrow money to get to Joburg and don't even have enough
money for the journey back home. Many spend several days at the Driefontein
mine while they try to raise money for the trip back home.

And, once back home, they must start all over again, raising money and
organising the necessary travel documents they need for the next time they
return to try to collect their pensions.

A case in point is that of Maria Matshepo Shoaepane (42), who has already
made three trips from her home in Lesotho to Joburg, but has returned home
empty-handed each time. The mother of deceased mineworker Joseph Shoaepane's
seven children, Maria says it costs her about R1 000 to travel between her
home and Joburg.

Shoaepane seethed with anger as she told her story. &quot;It is not nice for me
to sit here. I am a mother and it pains me that my children no longer go to
school because their mother does not have money.&quot;

What particularly angers the women is the lack of information on what is
happening with their pensions.

&quot;The last time I came here they told me that I need my marriage certificate.
I came with the certificate and now they have told me that I need my
children's birth certificates. And when I ask why they did not tell me this
when I was here last, they tell me they were [then] guided by a different
law,&quot; Shoaepane said.

But when she complained that she couldn't afford the trip back home, they
told her they weren't interested.

&quot;That means you have to come here, sit here [Driefontein] until you raise
money to go back home, where you have to wait until the day you can get
money to come back here … Why are they treating us like this?&quot; she asked.

Sthuli Mthethwa, mother of deceased miner Muzi Mthethwa and guardian of her
son's only child, had travelled from KwaZulu Natal, while Masepahaphe Kalake
had come from Lesotho and Thoko Zwane, a mother-of-eight, had left her
children in Swaziland.

Mthethwa said she was told to open a bank account, into which the money
could be paid. &quot;But it is now more than nine months and I have been told the
same story again.&quot;

A caretaker at Driefontein mine, who refused to give his name, said he
accommodated about 28 different women each month who come and try to collect
their widow's pensions.

Last year, Personal Finance revealed that one of the country's top
retirement fund trustees, Collyn Manzana, was dropped by the National Union
of Mineworkers (NUM) as one of its nominated trustees on the MPF after he
raised questions about the investment of funds. Manzana had questioned what
was happening at Living Hands, the umbrella trust fund in which assets of
about R880-million due to widows and orphans of the MPF had been placed on
the advice of Fidentia-owned retirement fund administration company Lekana.

Lekana had an agreement with the Living Hands administration company to
administer the funds. The MIC owns 30% of Lekana, which in turn is
controlled by the NUM.

Responding to questions sent to Lekana, Leshilo Modupi, of the MPF board of
trustees, said the MPF had communicated the situation to all members and
beneficiaries - but he was unable to explain how they communicated with
widows who did not understand English or had literacy problems.

Lesiba Seshoka, national spokesperson for the NUM, was outraged at the
challenges faced by the women. &quot;As a union, we are very upset about this,
but there is nothing we could have done unless we were made aware,&quot; he said.

He added: &quot;We, as a union, are not only responsible to our members but also
responsible for members of the families.&quot;

Fidentia curator Dinesh Gihwala said all money invested by the MPF with the
company before February 2007 was affected. The women interviewed by the
Saturday Star &quot;are part of the 47 000 beneficiaries who may get as little as
35c out of every R1 of the money that was invested,&quot; he said.

‘Give us right to strike’

Irene Louw, City Press, 8 July 2007
The absence of minimum service level agreements in essential services is
increasingly becoming a ­dispute trigger between workers and employers.

Electricity utility Eskom’s current wage battle with the National Union of
Mineworkers (Num), the National Union of Metalworkers of SA and Solidarity
is another fight which contests the definition of essential services and the
absence of a minimum services agreement (MSA).

Labour says it is being held hostage by the lack of this agreement as it
means a wage strike would be illegal.

As with the recent public service strike, workers in this dispute are
determined to have such an agreement in place.

Labour argues that the lack of an MSA denies workers the right to strike as
it deems all staff in essential services, such as some parts of the public
sector and Eskom, to be essential.

Six years ago, the Public Service Job Summit acknowledged that a MSA “must
be tabled in the relevant sectors as soon as possible”.

Public sector unions and government have now undertaken to ­finalise an
agreement by the end of November. Negotiations will soon start at sectoral
council level.

Failure to reach agreement here will see the negotiations revert to the
Public Service Co-ordinating Bargaining Council for settlement, said
National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union general secretary
Fikile Majola.

Num spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka said the three unions have declared a
dispute with the employer on this issue, which is now with the Commission
for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration.

Labour lawyer Rob Lagrange said essential services sectors need to ensure
that MSAs are in place well before wage negotiations begin.

He said that though it was not in the interest of the employer to sign such
agreements, it was important that where they do exist, MSAs be complied
with.

MSAs are also useful in determining the process when bargaining breaks down,
he added.

Lagrange said as a member state, SA has to comply with the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and standards which provide wide scope
for minimum services.

The public sector strike saw ­unions in essential services, such as the
police, correctional services and nurses, make ad-hoc arrangements but these
were not very effective.

Eskom was declared an essential service in 1997, which means employees
cannot engage in industrial action.

Labour withdrew from the agreement in 2004 , saying the definition of
essential services was too narrow and that it prevented strike action.

Solidarity spokesperson Dirk Herman said the employer was ­using the lack of
an agreement as ammunition against labour.

He said the unions wanted a definition of essential service, in line with
that of the ILO.

Eskom declared a wage dispute against the unions early on Friday and
reverted to its initial offer of 6.25%, while the unions revised their
demand from 12% to 9.5%.

Solidarity said it wanted to ­enforce arbitration proceedings, hoping that a
third party would help break the deadlock.

Union accuses Vodacom of dirty tactics

Edwin Naidu, Sunday Independent, 8 July 2007
A David and Goliath battle is taking place at Vodacom, the country's biggest
cellphone operator. The company is allegedly resorting to dirty tricks
against a small group of striking employees, who are demanding recognition
of their union.

Vodacom has shut down e-mails, blocked cellphones used by striking employees
and threatened them with disciplinary measures for taking part in a legal
strike action, according to Mfanafuthi Sithebe, the spokesman for the
Cosatu-affiliated Communication Workers Union (CWU).

Vodacom has 4 300 employees, 432 of whom belong to the the CWU. The union
has been struggling for recognition at the company for the past nine years.

Vodacom says that the CWU membership is too low for the union to qualify for
all rights in terms of labour regulations, which stipulate that a minimum of
30 percent of employees must be members for a union to be recognised. The
CWU says it has met membership requirements over the years, but that Vodacom
has recruited new employees, thus skewing the percentage.

Dot Field, the spokeswoman for Vodacom, rejected accusations of
union-bashing.

She said Vodacom had excellent employee relations, characterised by low
staff turnover, strong and stable management and low trade union activity.
However, the CWU told Vodacom this week that it objected to inequality in
the company, management's inability to engage with organised labour during
negotiations on recognition and continuous attempts to undermine and
disrespect union members.

Patrick Craven, the Cosatu spokesman, said the union had been trying to
negotiate with Vodacom for nine years and that the cellphone operator had an
anti-union mentality. Cosatu supports the striking workers.

&lt; http://business.iafrica.com/news/182104.htm &gt; 1.6 Workers lack basic
rights – Vavi

Sapa, iAfrica.com, 5 July 2007
Thirteen years into the democratic era, workers still had difficulty
obtaining basic rights in the work place, Congress of SA (Cosatu) General
Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said on Thursday.

Speaking at the Annual Labour Conference in Johannesburg, Vavi said the
Labour Force Surveys of 2001 and 2006 showed the number of workers receiving
paid leave in September 2001 was just under 60 percent of the total, with
just over 40 percent of workers not receiving any paid leave.

The figures for 2006 were much the same.

Poor enforcement
&quot;Increasing flexibility, poor enforcement and a general flouting of the rule
of law by employers continues to undermine basic conditions,&quot; Vavi said.

While the number of written contracts of employment indicated an
improvement, 28 percent of workers in September 2006 still did not have a
written contract detailing their wage rate, leave provisions, hours of work
and other conditions of employment, Vavi said.

This should be addressed not only by government but also by organised
business.

Vavi said employers often disregarded arbitration awards won by workers.
Failure to implement awards obliged workers to undertake a costly legal
process.

&quot;While improving the protection and rights for a typical workers is
critical, this must go hand-in-hand with improving the overall rights and
protections to all workers,&quot; Vavi added.

10642&gt; 1.7 Elize Strydom, chief negotiator, Chamber of Mines

Chris Barron, Sunday Times, Business, 8 July 2007
The mining companies could not have found a more eloquent and convincing
champion.

It is that time again when the gold mining companies make a derisory wage
offer, the unions threaten to strike and we all feel sorry for the guys
underground.

Is it as straightforward as that, I ask chief negotiator for the Chamber of
Mines, Elize Strydom? Is it the goodies versus the baddies?

“I think the answer is somewhere in the middle,” she says, throwing me off
guard immediately with her smile (the real thing, not PR plastic) and
thoughtful tone.

But look at the gold price, and the mines are offering 6%?

“The gold price is doing well, there is no denying that. But it’s a cyclical
industry. In 2005, 75% of the mines were making a loss. It can change
again.”

Labour costs in gold mining are 50% of running costs, she points out.

In the automotive industry, by way of comparison, they’re 7%.

And, unlike other industries, gold mining companies can’t build these costs
into their commodity price.

Nevertheless, isn’t it a waste of everybody’s time, not to mention downright
cynical, to make an opening offer that is below the rate of inflation?

If mining companies want the public on their side, this is no way to go, I
suggest.

What the public does not understand, says Strydom, is that the unions’ 15%
wage demand is only one of 62 demands on the table.

“And, apart from the wage demand, the other demands all have significant
cost implications.

“Until we have a better understanding of where we’re going to go with all
those other demands, we need to be more careful when we make a wage offer.”

She lays out the figures to show that if the unions get what they’re
demanding, the smiles won’t last very long.

Not far down the line there will be no industry left and 160000 miners won’t
have jobs.

In addition to their basic wage, miners who choose to live outside the
hostels get paid R1000 a month to fix their own accommodation.

Five years ago, this living-out allowance was R400.

The unions want it raised to R1500 which, Strydom points out, is the
equivalent of a 5% basic wage increase for each miner over and above the 15%
being demanded.

The mining companies have agreed to “look at it”.

Miners get 30 calendar days a year paid leave. This is nine more days than
stipulated in the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, but the unions are
demanding 35.

“We’re saying that’s too much,” says Strydom.

On Tuesday, the mining companies agreed to the unions’ demand for a 12%
increase of the minimum wage from R2670 to R3000.

In addition, miners get half a percent on top of their basic wage for every
year’s service.

Unions are demanding that this be increased to 1%.

Should the mining companies agree to these three demands (the living-out
allowance, service increment increase and 15% basic wage increase) it would
mean a 21.5% increase on the basic wage, says Strydom.

“And that’s just three out of 62 demands on the table.”

The unions “understand the economics”, she says, “but the expectations of
their members are very high.

“They need to find a balance between these high expectations and the
long-term viability of the industry.”

The mining companies could not have found a more eloquent and convincing
champion than Strydom.

And it is a measure of how far they’ve come, perhaps, that they offered her
the job.

And that she accepted.

Twenty years ago she would have been “very uncomfortable” sitting on their
side of the table, she says.

She believes the mining industry has become more “humane”.

“This makes it more acceptable for me. If it hadn’t been like that, I wouldn
’t have wanted to be involved in the mining industry.”

Strydom, the daughter of a refrigeration mechanic, grew up in a
hard-working, blue- collar environment in Germiston where she attended the
local Afrikaans high school.

After matriculating, she read law at Pretoria University and graduated with
a BA LLB degree.

She worked at Bowman Gilfillan and Werksmans but commercial law was too
“clinical”.

In search of a more “human element”, she went to Unisa where she lectured
for 13 years and did a Masters degree in income tax, company and labour law.

She decided to specialise in labour law and in 1997 completed her doctorate.

She believes that “the challenge” for employers is how to address labour
issues while “being more socially aware; having a greater social
consciousness”.

Another of the demands on the table relates specifically to the industry’s
30000 rock drillers.

Before the negotiations, Strydom asked to be taken to the bottom of the
deepest mine, 2800 metres under, and to the rock face. She wanted to talk to
the drillers, “to physically experience and see what these people do, to
have that in mind when I come back and we say: ‘Let’s do something about the
rock drillers’.”

One of the things she learned down there, apart from the fact that the
temperature — even after cooling — is 31°C and the humidity is “incredible”,
was that nobody wants to be a rock driller.

“You have to carry 28kg of equipment down to wherever you go, and they have
the highest fatality rate.”

Rock drillers had a “very macho” image which is not so appealing to “the new
guys”, she found. She admits it was useful to know this when responding to
demands that their basic wage be increased from R3500 to around R6000.

“We’re looking at doing something special for them.”

Strydom, whose parents were politically conservative, says her work as a
negotiator has affected her own politics.

“If you listen properly, which as a negotiator you should, if you really try
to understand the other side of the story, because there are always two
sides, then it must change your perspective.

“It’s got to change something in you.”

She finds her job “incredibly stressful”.

“I have three mining houses (AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields and Harmony)
sitting listening to every word I say, absorbing every word, and they will
take me on.

“Afterwards they will say: ‘Elize, you shouldn’t have said that. That’s not
your mandate.’

“Then I have three unions hanging on to every, every word I’m saying. They
will stop me in the middle and say: ‘Repeat that. Exactly what are you
saying? Don’t come with fancy words — just put it very bluntly.’ Then you
have to repeat it, find other words … It’s incredibly, incredibly
stressful.”

She leaves home in Pretoria at 5.15am and is in her office by 6am.

“I’m a hard worker,” she admits somewhat bashfully.

A workaholic?

“I am, I am.”

In brief
Marital status: Married, no children

Current reading: Strydom has 15 books on her bedside table. She’s reading
Scramble for Africa by Thomas Packenham

Relaxation: Dinner with friends, travelling and playing putt-putt with her
nephew and niece. “It’s good therapy.”

Personal philosophy: “You must treat people the way you want to be treated”

SADTU says they will not endorse wage deal

SABC, 6 July 2007
The South African Democratic Teachers' Union (Sadtu) says that although most
unions signed the public service agreement this week, they will not endorse
the wage deal. Naptosa has also not signed the agreement but have agreed
that catching up on lost time is the priority.

Teachers are back in class, but their salaries remain a concern. &quot;We are
living from hand to mouth, the money we are getting is very little,&quot; says
Tim Shongwe, a teacher.

Sadtu's executive met today and it says that it supports catch-up
programmes, but wage negotiations are not over. &quot;We are shocked by the
minister’s announcement that this thing is closed, maybe the employer
themselves do not understand this agreement because a number of issues still
have to be finalised,&quot; says Thulas Nxesi, Sadtu's general-secretary.

Negotiations
&quot;Where we run short of time that is where the negotiations with the state
must take place as to how people will be compensated,&quot; says Henry Hendricks
of Naptosa.

The dispute is likely to end up at the labour relations council. Some
provinces have indicated that more money is needed for recovery plans, but
in many schools catching up will depend on the willingness of teachers and
pupils to put in extra time, with or without additional funds.

659780C946627&gt; 1.9 No recovery without compensation - SADTU

SAPA, IOL, 6
July 2007
Teachers must be paid for the extra classes resulting from the proposed
education recovery programme, the SA Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) said
on Friday.

&quot;Educators will not participate in government-run catch-up programmes
without compensation,&quot; said Sadtu president Willie Madisha.

Madisha was speaking after a two-day Sadtu national executive committee
meeting held in Johannesburg.

While the union welcomed attempts by national and provincial education
departments to address the loss of teaching time during the recent strike,
the programmes had to be negotiated with labour.

&quot;The union has always accepted 'no work no pay' as a result of strike
action, but there must be compensation for educators who work additional
hours arising out of the proposed recovery programmes,&quot; he said.

The recovery programmes must cover Grade R to matric and should include all
education sector employees, including office-based staff and support staff.

The details of recovery plans would have to be negotiated at provincial
level and should include consideration of additional hours of teaching,
weekend and holiday classes.

The level of compensation would need to be negotiated in the Education
Labour Relations Council based on existing regulations, Madisha said.

Sadtu is the largest union in the public service with 235,000 members
representing almost two-thirds of teachers. - Sapa

COSATU condemns the suspension of culling lions

SABC, 7 July 2007
The Congress of South African trade union (Cosatu) in North West has
condemned the suspension of the decision to put down 10 lions that mauled a
nine-year-old boy to death at Woodburrow farm in Tosca near Vryburg.

The lions were supposed to have been culled yesterday. The farm owner's
permit that allows the keeping of the lions had expired at the time of the
incident.

Officials say that they received an instruction to suspend the culling last
night. The officials sent by the department did not possess the court order
to enter the farm as well as for culling the lions.

We are really disappointed: Cosatu
Solly Phetoe, the Cosatu's provincial secretary, said: &quot;We are really
disappointed in terms of the manner in which we have been treated. The
department of agriculture knew yesterday that they were supposed to come to
do this work, but we still going to take this matter up with the relevant
MEC who called and asked the department to call off this thing”.

&quot;We are not happy. But the campaign programme of Cosatu to deal with all
this matter of killing farm workers and families by lions is not going to
stop. We are going to make sure that this campaign is going up to the
national level,&quot; Phetoe said.

2.1 SABC boss just can’t believe he lost

Charles Molele, Sunday Times, 8 July 2007
Embattled CEO believes soccer broadcast rights are still within his grasp at
arbitration, writes.

“Am I feeling any heat? What heat?” burst out SABC chief executive Dali
Mpofu when asked if he was feeling the heat in the kitchen and whether he
was having sleepless nights after failing to win the rights for the public
broadcaster to screen Premier Soccer League matches.

But Mpofu, the former savvy student leader, ICT Charter negotiator and black
economic empowerment player, was not acting. He was just being Dali Mpofu —
the suave, combative “green revolutionary” given to intemperate outbursts;
the former Eastern Cape boxing aspirant whose philosophy in the ring has
found a place in his boardroom dealings: always hit your opponent harder.

He is a survivor of note, too, after reclaiming his public profile despite
the bruising scandal in the ’90s involving him and Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela. The two were said to have enjoyed more than a
professional relationship and were accused of embezzling funds from the ANC’
s Department of Social Welfare, although the ANC later issued a statement
clearing them.

For the better part of the interview, held at his office in Auckland Park,
Mpofu did not shy away from launching verbal strikes against critics of the
SABC, branding them racists, members of the chattering class or
reactionaries.

The problem with Mpofu, says Jane Duncan of the Freedom of Expression
Institute (FXI), is his “failure to recognise the difference between
engaging in robust public debate and filibustering”.

As the broadcast rights saga continued this week, Mpofu, with his
never-say-die attitude, was adamant that the SABC would win back the rights
at arbitration.

He was convinced that the PSL had negotiated with the SABC in bad faith, and
therefore he would continue to fight for the rights.

“The issue’s so simple it hurts,” said Mpofu. “We have a strong case against
the PSL because they negotiated in bad faith. Two independent lawyers say we
have very high prospects of success at arbitration.”

It was not always like this for Mpofu. When he was appointed to the helm in
August 2005, the irrepressible Mpofu seemed to be a breath of fresh air. He
vowed to bring to the public broadcaster values such as team-building,
integrity and respect. He promised zero tolerance for corruption.

In his few first few months at the SABC, Mpofu, always snazzily dressed in
his trademark green shirts and ties, cut a figure of professionalism, a far
cry from the boring, inept the Rev Hawu Mbatha and the formal Peter Matlare.

For the first time at the SABC, here was an accessible and amiable Group CEO
ever-ready to engage with staff.

A few months into his job, he unveiled his vision for the SABC, called
Public Service Broadcasting for Total Citizens’ Empowerment.

He emphasised that every programme should have a positive impact on viewers
and listeners and answer the question: “In what way did we empower the South
African citizen today?”

“Each one of the 46 million people is our target, whether you are white,
black, short, tall, man or woman, rich or poor,” he said at the time.

But barely a sneeze into his new job, the rot started.

Instead of introducing a radical departure from his predecessors, Mpofu
retained the pro-status-quo bias in reporting on controversial political
questions.

He withdrew an interview with ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma scheduled with
Asikhulume on SABC1.

Next came the manner in which he handled the incident in which Deputy
President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka was booed in KwaZulu- Natal.

And in one of the most unfortunate acts to curry favour with President Thabo
Mbeki, the SABC boss pulled independent producer Ben Cashden’s documentary,
Unauthorised: Thabo Mbeki.

When asked about this he barked: “Show me an editor in any media
organisation who can ignore counsel from three [sometimes he says five]
independent lawyers and proceed to flight a defamatory documentary on the
President, and I will show you a fool.”

But the most damaging of all was Mpofu’s inept handling of the findings of a
commission of inquiry into allegations of blacklisting of independent
analysts.

“While his decision to appoint a commission of inquiry was a correct one, he
mismanaged the process once the report was complete,” said Duncan.

“Mpofu also assured witnesses in the inquiry that they would not be
victimised, yet four witnesses have been charged with various [seemingly
unrelated] offences, and three have since left.”

Duncan said the fact that the board expressed full confidence in head of
news Snuki Zikalala after the inquiry’s damning findings against him,
strongly suggested that it did not support Mpofu’s attempt to tackle the
problem.

On Friday, ANC Youth League spokesman Zizi Kodwa said Mpofu was the worst
chief executive the SABC ever had.

“He has turned the SABC into a mouthpiece of the ANC and has compromised the
quality of its content,” said Kodwa.

A visibly upset Mpofu denied that witnesses at the inquiry had been
victimised and said he did not know the identities of the witnesses except
for one, who had left for better money elsewhere.

He scoffed at suggestions that staff morale was low at the SABC.

As for reports of an exodus of senior managers and senior journalists as a
result of mismanagement, he burst out laughing.

“The last exodus happened in the Bible,” he said. “Look, the SABC employs
over 7000 employees and if you choose to call the departure of five or six
people to CNBC Africa an exodus then that is ridiculous.”

Mpofu said the editorial integrity of the SABC remained intact and far
exceeded the mandate of the Independent Communications Authority of SA.

He said there was more local content on TV, and all South African languages
were used.

He said that the organisation was in a healthy financial state.

Mpofu said all his achievements at the SABC were the result of spending many
hours at work.

Mpofu also clarified his close links with the ruling party, after his
appearance at last week’s ANC policy conference, apparently as a cadre of
the ruling party.

“I resigned from all my official positions in organisations including
participation in the ANC branch when I came to the SABC. I attended the
policy conference in my capacity as CEO of the SABC,” he said.

SABC rejects sub-licensing deal

S’busiso Mseleku, City Press, 8 July 2007
Arbitration seems to be the ­only option left in the broadcasting rights
battle between the Premier Soccer League (PSL) and SABC, ­following this
week’s impasse.

Talks that have been going on for three weeks since the PSL ­announced its
broadcasting deal agreement with SuperSport International on June 14 reached
a deadlock on Friday.

The SABC shunned an offer from SuperSport to broadcast 143 PSL matches for a
fee of R120 million, said to be about 20% less than the market value of R1
million a match.

This has led to speculation that SuperSport would start wooing other
partners such as e.tv.

A source close to the negotiations told City Press that the free-to-air
package might be sold by Wednesday.

The SABC was adamant this week that they wanted to deal directly with the
PSL.

“We want to acquire the broadcasting rights from the PSL,” insisted SABC
chief executive Dali ­Mpofu at a media briefing at the Westcliff Hotel on
Wednesday.

“The rights belong to the PSL and we have sold them to SuperSport, who now
owns them,” retorted PSL chairman Irvin Khoza.

City Press learned that after the lengthy talks that continued into
Wednesday night, a deal was eventually put on the table for the public
broadcaster.

The deal entailed the SABC being ­given 80 league matches, 20 cup matches,
20 Mvela and Baymed Cup matches and 23 matches to be broadcast
simultaneously with SuperSport.

These 23 include cup finals, semi-finals, quarter-finals, ­derbies and top
league matches.

This deal was tabled and given to the SABC to consider with a deadline of
noon on Friday.

But by the end of business on Friday, they had not responded.

It also emerged that Mpofu had said during the talks that the SABC board had
resolved not to enter into a sub-licence agreement with SuperSport.

However it is reported that SABC board chairman Eddie Funde had said that it
was the SABC management that had refused to accept a sub-licensing
arrangement with SuperSport.

Many observers are amazed at this stance as the two broadcasters do have
existing sub-licensing ­arrangements on other sports, such as rugby and
cricket.

Mpofu could not be reached yesterday as his phone first went unanswered for
the better part of the morning and later went straight to voicemail. He did
not respond to a voicemail and SMS left on his ­mobile by City Press.

SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said he was not aware of the deal.

He said he had been out of Johannesburg since Thursday and had not had any
feedback from those ­involved in the talks.

“I tried to call the CEO this morning for an update but could not reach
him,” he said.

head shrugs off loss of 76 journalists

Edwin Naidu , Sunday Independent, 8 July 2007
CEO Dali Mpofu admits 'morale is not perfect' but says there is no cause for
alarm.

The brain drain at the South African Broadcasting Corporation has claimed at
least 76 staff members from the newsroom since the beginning of the year.

In June, 21 staff members, including Denzil Taylor, the political editor,
resigned, telling colleagues in an e-mail that a serious drop in standards
over the past year prompted his decision to leave. Taylor now works in the
presidency.

&quot;I believe in breaking news. If you get it second, you have lost, for
journalism is an extremely competitive environment… We have … lost our
competitive edge,&quot; he said.

Dali Mpofu, the SABC chief executive, told The Sunday Independent he was not
aware that as many as 76 people had resigned from the newsroom since
January.

&quot;People leave for different reasons and, with the advent of competition, for
example, the better salaries offered by the likes of CNBC, you expect people
to come and go at an organisation of this size. It is the first time I have
heard that figure. To my knowledge, the people who left are few compared to
those who arrived,&quot; he said.

Mpofu denied suggestions he was under pressure given the continuing
controversy during his two-year tenure, particularly the incident in which
the corporation withheld footage of Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the deputy
president, being booed at a rally, the blacklisting row and the failure to
secure the rights to screen local Premier Soccer League matches.

&quot;I'm enjoying my job; if there were no challenges, I would not be here. When
I joined the SABC, I knew it was not going to be a bed of roses, but I made
a choice to be driving an organisation that works in the national interest,
and I know it was the right decision,&quot; he said.

Mpofu said the corporation was implementing recommendations of reports on
the booing incident and the blacklisting row. He denied that anyone had been
victimised for giving evidence on the blacklisting, although critics charged
that at least four of the 39 who appeared before the blacklisting commission
had been victimised.

&quot;I can assure you, the disciplinary cases would have gone ahead, regardless
of who appeared before the commission or not,&quot; he said.

Asked about low morale at the corporation, Mpofu said: &quot;I am satisfied that
the morale is good but I would be interested in seeing the exit interviews
of those who have left… I don't want to say morale is perfect. I don't
believe people are leaving in droves, and there is no cause for alarm; from
a management point, we are excited about the strategy to take the
corporation forward,&quot; he said.

Jane Duncan, the executive director of the Freedom of Expression Institute,
said the problems over the past two years had led to a drop in morale.

&quot;The people who one feels the most sorry for are the ordinary SABC
employees. Mpofu has failed to address the painfully obvious levels of staff
demoralisation.

&quot;Journalism is a creative profession. Demoralisation will kill the creative
spirit, and creates an internal culture where independent-mindedness is
punished and mediocrity thrives. The SABC has also fuelled an internal
disciplinary culture, where ordinary employees are disciplined for the
slightest misdemeanour, while members of the top leadership get away with
murder.&quot;

Duncan pointed out, however, that &quot;had [Mpofu] been supported by a better
board, he could have done much more to address the editorial problems in the
newsroom&quot;.

Sascoc is incensed by Safa’s shabby management

S’busiso Mseleku, City Press, 8 July 2007
THE South African Football Association (Safa) is “disorganised” and “out of
order”.

These strong words were uttered by South African Sports Confederation and
Olympics Committee (Sascoc) president Moss Mashishi yesterday.

This followed the chaos that was caused by Safa preceding the departure of
Team South Africa for the All Africa Games (AAG) in Algeria.

Safa informed Sascoc 48 hours prior to departure that the bulk of the
players who were on the initial list announced on June 15 were no longer
travelling with the team.

Safa said some Premier Soccer League clubs had withdrawn their players from
the squad.

The clubs are Orlando Pirates, Mamelodi Sundowns, Ajax Cape Town and Bidvest
Wits University.

“This is totally out of order and shows how disorganised Safa is,” a fuming
Mashishi told City Press yesterday.

“We will have an internal investigation when we return from the Games and
heads will roll if there are people responsible for this.”

The Games start on Wednesday and Team South Africa were originally scheduled
to leave at noon yesterday.

However, the departure time had to be moved to the early hours of this
morning as the SA Under-23 players were only due to get their visas
yesterday.

Sascoc had to ask the SA government to intervene.

Government’s intervention led to the Algerian Embassy having to open their
offices yesterday morning in order to issue the players with visas.

Mashishi said the fracas was very disturbing to his organisation.

Sascoc had bought uniforms after all the players were measured and organised
passports and visas.

SA is sending a contingent of 400 athletes to Algiers to take part in the
AAG over the next two weeks.

Safa spokesperson Morio Sanyane admitted that this was an embarrassing
situation for the body.

“I think it should be handled at the Safa/PSL liaison committee,” he said.

“We must accept that there will be always games such as the All Africa Games
and Cosafa Castle Cup that don’t fall on the Fifa calendar.”

Sanyane said Safa had done everything in its power to stick to Sascoc’s
procedures.They had sent out call-up letters to the clubs in time, he said.

However, he could not confirm whether Safa had received written confirmation
from the clubs that they would release the players for this tournament.

Using violence as a voice

Chantelle Benjamin, Weekender, 7 July 2007
Drastic action by the government is needed to prevent further loss of life
and damage caused by disgruntled communities.

THE brutal murders of three councillors in the past month and an increasing
number of attacks on local government officials by communities angry about
the slow pace of service delivery, is putting pressure on the African
National Congress (ANC) to show visible evidence of delivery to the poor.

The municipalities’ slow pace of service delivery was discussed at the ANC’s
national executive committee lekgotla earlier this year when Housing
Minister Lindiwe Sisulu warned that the country could face greater
instability in the run-up to the 2009 general elections if the government
did not meet communities’ expectations.

Sisulu said the party needed to do something drastic in the next two years
to ensure that the protests that dogged the 2004 elections did not recur.

Her warning was prophetic, with protests starting even earlier than she
predicted. This year there have been at least 10 protests that have forced
councillors to flee for their lives; government buildings have been torched;
roads have been blockaded; protesters have been injured and arrested; and
three ANC councillors have been murdered.

At most of the protests, people have alleged councillors are failing to
provide services, that they are corrupt, and that they employ relatives in
local government posts and award housing irregularly.

Thandi Mtshweni, deputy mayor of the Govan Mbeki Municipality in Mpumalanga;
Ntai Mokoena, chief whip of Metsimaholo Municipality in Free State; and
Moses Mosala of Lejweleputswa Municipality in Free State, were murdered in
the past month.

Mtshweni was shot three times at point-blank range on June 27 at her home,
in front of her husband and her 13-year-old son. No one has been arrested.

Mosala was shot dead last Friday at his municipality’s offices in Welkom. No
one has been arrested for his murder.

Mokoena was stoned and struck with an axe during violence in Deneysville in
northern Free State this week after he arrived to talk to protesters who
were stoning his and another councillor’s homes after they set fire to a
municipal building. Police arrested 18 people.

Mokoena’s death is considered by the ANC as particularly pointless, as the
Metsimaholo Municipality is the best-performing municipality in Free State
in terms of service delivery. However, nearly half of its population are
still living below the poverty line.

The ANC called his murder an “act of barbarity” and said it could not be
tolerated in a society where law and order reigned.

“The ANC believes that while people have a right to demonstrate, taking a
person's life and vandalising property cannot be justified as ways of
showing protest,” the party said in a statement earlier this week.

“No amount of dissatisfaction with the delivery of services accords people
the right to kill. Unruly elements that see fit to take another person's
life do not have room in our society.”

Parliament’s chairperson of the portfolio committee on provincial and local
government, Lechisa Tsenoli, says violent acts of this nature weakened valid
protests by communities.

South African Local Government Association head and Johannesburg mayor Amos
Masondo says there is “no justification for these actions, given the fact
that our democracy provides for legitimate forms of protest”.

“Those who want to register their dissatisfaction should rightfully do so
within the parameters of the law. Any action outside of such legitimate
means opens the whole society to acts of anarchy and barbarism.

“We condemn any acts of vandalism, criminality and savagery allegedly
pursued under the guise of service delivery concerns.”

Masondo called on communities to help municipalities to provide services and
to report any form of lawlessness.

Communities’ unhappiness with local government delivery was made clear
during the local government elections last year, although there were fewer
protests last year than in 2005.

The most protracted and violent protest this year took place in Khutsong in
North West, where residents are angry about their incorporation into the
province.

In March, protesters in Boikhutso near Lichtenburg in North West were
stopped by police as they marched on the home of a councillor. The
protesters accused the council of nepotism and poor service delivery.

Later that month, seven protesters at Winterveld in northern Tshwane were
admitted to hospital after police used rubber bullets to disperse a crowd
protesting against the destruction of their government-built homes, which
they said were too small to house their families.

In April, 500 residents of New Eesterus, near Hammanskraal, took to the
streets to protest over water shortages.

Police and protesters clashed after the community blockaded several roads,
including the Lucas Mangope highway.

Ward councillor Solomon Moima was forced to flee after he assured protesters
that the council had set up three water-truck sites, four boreholes and 18
water-tank sites for the community.

Khutsong hotted up in April, with the homes of councillors being stoned, a
school boycott and other violent protests.

In May, 35 people were arrested for public violence in the Tswelelang
township near Wolmaranstad in North West.

Residents barricaded roads, vandalised houses and burnt tyres to protest
against poor service from local authorities.

Last month, residents at the Lusaka informal settlement in Mamelodi East and
the Tshetong settlement near Sebokeng in the Vaal Triangle also protested
against poor service delivery.

Johan Burger, senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies,
believes the increase in violence and criminal behaviour is the result of a
growing gap between rich and poor in SA, as well as of migration to cities,
which is creating burgeoning informal settlements.

“Authorities are finding it almost impossible to provide services as more
people flood to the cities,” he says.

Added to this is the political and economic instability in Zimbabwe, which
has led to immigrants and refugees moving south in hope of a better life.

Burger says this creates socioeconomic problems that need to be addressed by
the government and civic organisations.

Financial services companies shouldn't flout the law

Bruce Cameron, Personal Finance, 7 July 2007
Two things that are really putrid in the financial services industry are:
*        The way in which too many players in the industry seek to find ways
to sidestep the law with fancy legal agreements and interpretations of the
law. The ultimate aim is to sting you as a consumer. The latest example is
the exposé we publish today on the way Regent Life has sidestepped various
laws by providing its agents (namely motor vehicle dealerships) with
perverse incentives to sell you its credit life assurance policies.
*        The industry's use of the excuse that it is &quot;common industry
practice&quot; to make the inexcusable excusable. This was the excuse that was
rolled out when Personal Finance exposed the secret profits that were made
by retirement fund administrators. Alexander Forbes, the company that
initiated the practice, claimed it made the secret profits because this was
common industry practice.

'Common practice' excuse
Nazeer Hoosen, the managing director of Regent Life, claims he tried to stop
the abuse of commission regulations in the industry by reporting alleged
abuses to the Financial Services Board (FSB) as far back as 2002 and on five
or six occasions after that.

He also claims he had to follow suit in order for Regent to survive. This,
however, is not good enough. The law has a purpose.

Anarchy is the word used to describe a situation where individuals and
corporates take it upon themselves to decide which laws they will obey,
which they will disobey and which they will sidestep.

Although this is extreme, on the basis of this &quot;common practice&quot; argument,
could I murder a neighbour and claim I was justified in doing so because
Cape Town has a very high murder rate?

Of course not. The same principle must also apply to abusing commission
regulations.

Hoosen is also deputy chairman of the Life Offices' Association (LOA), which
represents the interests of most of the life assurance companies. The
question must be asked whether he raised the issue with the LOA; and if he
did, what did the LOA do about it?

If Hoosen did not raise the issue with the LOA, he should immediately resign
as its deputy chairman. If he did raise it, the LOA must explain why it did
not take up the issue with both National Treasury and the FSB and issue a
public warning to the life companies to stop the unacceptable practices
revealed by Personal Finance today.

It should also be noted that the LOA has a code on commissions, and any
complaints should have been measured against this code as well as the laws
of this country.

Sidestepping regulations
The main problems involved in what has happened at Regent/Imperial include
the following:
*        Commission regulations. The exposé raises the question whether it
is too easy to sidestep commission regulations; and/or whether the FSB has
been lax in ensuring that commission regulations are properly applied.
The manner in which Regent and others have sidestepped the regulations needs
to be investigated and if there have been contraventions of the law, action
should be taken against the perpetrators. Commission regulation is in place
to prevent commission-driven selling. The payment of excess commissions and
other incentives has been repeatedly shown to drive mis-selling,
particularly when the perverse incentives are not explicitly declared to
you.
*        Full and proper disclosure. Both the Policyholder Protection Rules
and the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services (FAIS) Act require
proper disclosure of all information, including costs and commissions. My
understanding is that generally there was not full and proper disclosure of
costs, of the amounts paid above regulated maximum commissions and the way
the premiums were being charged as a single amount and added to finance
agreements, thus incurring interest payments. Thankfully, this last
abhorrent practice has been banned in terms of the National Credit Act.
*        Appropriate advice. The question about the financial impact on you
of advice that is driven by commissions and other incentives has to be
raised. Questions that need to be answered include:
*       Were the commissions disclosed to policyholders?
*       Were the policies sold and details of the policies properly
disclosed to policyholders?
*       Were consumers provided with a choice of life assurance products;
*       Did the salespeople seek out and provide the best policies
available? And
*       Did the salespeople seek out policies where premiums would be paid
on a monthly basis rather than as a single premium upfront added to the
finance agreement?

The issue here is that since October 2004, anyone selling you a financial
services product is required to be licensed by the FSB as a financial
services provider (FSP) in terms of the FAIS Act.

The right advice
FSPs are supposed to provide you with appropriate advice. In my view, it is
not appropriate advice to provide you with a product for which the premiums
are paid upfront as a lump sum and added to a finance agreement.

The FSB, if it is to ensure public trust in FAIS, must investigate and
suspend or remove all FSP licences where the requirements of FAIS were not
met; and/or commission regulations were breached. This is apart from any
other action that should be taken against Regent and any other insurance
company that has not met the requirements of the commission regulations.

My view is that the FSB should insist that:
*        Any commissions paid over the maximum by Regent, or any other
assurance company, be repaid to policyholders. After all, the life assurance
industry has always insisted that it pays commissions on behalf of
policyholders.
*        If Regent, or any other assurance company, cannot conclusively
prove that each agent (motor dealership) provided comprehensive
administration services which would entitle the agents to the maximum
commission of 22.5 percent, then the excess amount over the normal
commission (without administration services) of 7.5 percent be repaid to
policyholders.

FSB's potent weapon
If the life assurance companies refuse to co-operate, then the FSB should
use its ultimate weapon, namely the removal or suspension of licences of
financial services companies that do not behave in the best interest of
consumers.

Laws are there to be obeyed both in letter and in spirit if we are to have a
successful society. Captains of industry cannot go on about the breakdown of
law and order in South Africa if they arrogantly decide which laws they will
fully uphold and which they will ignore.

That was why it was so gratifying to see some of the alleged culprits of the
retirement fund surplus-stripping debacle being marched into court in leg
irons like common criminals last year.

What South Africa needs is a few more high-profile criminal cases where
senior executives of companies are marched into court in leg irons, and, if
found guilty, are sentenced to long jail sentences.

Then they may see the wisdom of fully obeying all laws and behaving like
good corporate citizens.

Regent Life buys into troubled retirement company

Bruce Cameron, Personal Finance, 7 July 2007
Regent Life has bought a majority stake in a new retirement administration
company that has bought out the business of beleaguered retirement fund
administration company Wynne-Jones &amp; Co.

Wynne-Jones &amp; Co, with its owner, Aubrey Wynne-Jones, is facing criminal
charges for being part of an alleged conspiracy of employers and retirement
fund administrators that stripped surpluses out of retirement funds.

Wynne-Jones &amp; Co also faces claims for making secret profits from the
bulking of the bank accounts of retirement funds.

The surplus-stripping scheme was devised in the 1990s by Peter Ghavalas and
has resulted in charges being brought against a number of companies,
including Wynne-Jones and South Africa's biggest retirement fund
administrator, Alexander Forbes.

Regent Life has bought a 65 percent stake in Wynne-Jones &amp; Co, with Aubrey
Wynne-Jones maintaining a 15-percent stake. The remaining 20 percent is in a
black empowerment structure.

Wynne-Jones &amp; Co has been renamed Cedar Employee Benefits &amp; Consultants. The
biggest client of Wynne-Jones and Cedar is the Imperial retirement funds.

Hubert Brody, the newly appointed chief executive of Imperial and the
chairman of Cedar and Regent Life, says that part of the takeover agreement
is that Cedar will not be responsible for any claims against Wynne-Jones &amp;
Co arising out of the surplus stripping.

Jurgen Boyd, the deputy executive of the Financial Services Board (FSB),
says the FSB imposed conditions on the purchase of the business by Cedar,
under which Cedar is not responsible for any secret profit or
surplus-stripping liabilities.

The possible problem is that there are potential conflicts of interest,
including:
*        The Imperial funds being captive clients and therefore being
charged higher fees and/or receiving poor service; or
*        The Imperial funds paying lower fees and being cross-subsidised by
higher fees being charged to non-Imperial retirement funds administered by
Cedar.

(The case against Aubrey Wynne-Jones and his alleged co-conspirators in the
surplus-stripping case, was this week postponed to the Witwatersrand High
Court for trial.)

3.1 A leader knows when to leave

Editorial, Sunday Times, 8 July 2007
President Thabo Mbeki missed a golden opportunity to take the ANC forward,
during the party’s policy conference last week.

It was the perfect moment for the President to finally clear the air around
rumours of his intention to secure a third term as party president.

It was a moment Mbeki should have used to begin to prepare the party for his
departure by encouraging an open and democratic debate on his succession.

Instead, Mbeki opted to concentrate on his usual conspiracies, issuing stern
warnings to party members and outsiders.

He tried to divert attention and discourage the debate by criticising the
media for suggesting that the issue of his succession was going to dominate
the ANC conference.

It is, however, strange that no sooner had he discouraged debate around the
succession, than he himself fanned the flames back into life when — in an
interview with the SABC — he effectively declared his availability for a
third term.

It can only be pre sumed that by then Mbeki had realised that there was
absolutely nothing wrong with discussing presidential succession.

Succession had become one of the top issues on the agenda of the policy
conference, despite his attempts to discourage and stifle debate around it.

We find it perplexing that Mbeki has, on the one hand, been harbouring
ambitions to secure a third term as party president, while on the other hand
he has tried to suppress debate on his succession.

Mbeki was loudly sent a message at the party’s policy conference last week
that his time was up.

It is no exaggeration to say that, by declaring his intention to stand,
Mbeki is clearly going against the will of his own party structures.

Mbeki should have used his closing remarks to take his party faithful into
confidence about his intentions for a third term — rather than to attack the
media.

This would have given him an opportunity to understand why they don’t want
him for a third term.

The President will be interested to know that it is not only the majority of
ANC members who are opposed to the third term, but the majority of South
Africans who are also hostile to the idea.

The reason why many people are opposed to a third term is because of the
general agreement that the President has fully served his time and needs to
make way for new leadership.

There is a tendency by many leaders across the world who overstay their
welcome in office to resort to dictatorial tendencies to help them stay in
power.

South Africans don’t need to look far for an example, because Zimbabwe is a
case in point.

By wanting to extend his term of office, Mbeki creates the impression that
there is a shortage of good leaders in both the ANC and the country.

By eyeing a further term in ANC office, Mbeki is indeed creating the
suspicion that he wants to hand-pick and manipulate the country’s next
President.

It is indeed discomforting that Mbeki does not see the need for fresh blood
that could reinvigorate the ruling party with new ideas.

A good leader is one who appreciates when his time is up.

If he did that, it would be a clear demonstration to South Africans that he
is not addicted to power.

Indeed, by stubbornly canvassing for a third term, Mbeki is in danger of
undermining his own legacy.

The tragedy is that if he goes against the will of his own people, he will
leave in disgrace.

He won’t be remembered for all the good things he did for the country while
he was still at the helm.

He will instead be remembered as a leader who left in humiliation after
being forced by his own people to quit.

It’s time that Mbeki stopped listening only to himself, and heard those who
elected him into office.

The Sunday Times appreciates the contribution that Mbeki made to the
liberation of this country and the evolution of our democratic state. He has
been credited with our strong institutional state, our sound economic
policies and our respectability on the international stage.

History is replete with leaders who refused to see when their time was up
and had to be forced out of office, many of them in the so-called developed
world.

History is also replete with stories of leaders who became greater statesmen
once they had left office.

Mbeki can choose now into which category he wishes to fall .

Anonymous, ANC Today, 6 July 2007
It is said that wonders never cease! The Sunday Times edition of July 1,
2007 confirmed the truth behind this popular expression. In this edition the
newspaper carried a false front-page report of the decisions of the ANC
Policy Conference under the bold headline, &quot;MBEKI DEFIES ANC&quot;.

Consistent with this screaming headline, it manufactured a conclusion that
the ANC Policy Conference never arrived at, alleging &quot;overwhelming
opposition from delegates at the party's policy conference this week&quot; to
Comrade Thabo Mbeki serving a third term as President of the ANC.

Determined to sustain its lie, the Sunday Times made the &quot;prediction&quot; that,
&quot;If he stands, Mbeki will be on a collision course with his own party's
membership, who clearly stated this week that they would want the new ANC
president to be the country's next president.&quot;

To sustain its campaign of lies, the Sunday Times said our Deputy President,
Comrade Jacob Zuma, had &quot;said the ANC has established procedures on how to
elect its president and that the status quo - that the ANC president should
be president of the Republic - should be adhered to.&quot;

The truth is that Deputy President Jacob Zuma made the simple and correct
statement that the ANC has established procedures to elect its leadership,
and has established procedures to select candidates it would present to
Parliament for election to the post of President of the Republic. He
advanced the view, which was accepted unanimously by the Policy Conference,
that there was no need to change any of these procedures.
Specifically, the Conference decided that consistent with the Constitution
of the ANC, all members of the ANC in good standing had equal rights to
stand for and be elected to any position in the ANC. Thus it made the
specific and concrete determination that the membership of the ANC is not
prohibited from nominating and electing Comrade Thabo Mbeki for another term
as our President, on the grounds that he could not serve as President of the
Republic after the 2009 elections.

It went further to say that the ANC National Conference at the end of the
year would reflect on the issue of the procedures the ANC should adopt to
select its candidate for the post of President of the Republic. Naturally
and correctly it made no suggestions in this regard, despite the fact that,
as Deputy President Jacob Zuma had pointed out, our movement actually has
tried and tested democratic procedures to select this candidate.

The question must arise - why did the Sunday Times feel both emboldened and
driven dramatically to propagate blatant falsehoods! Part of the answer to
this question is provided by the report on our Policy Conference carried in
the &quot;News &amp; Opinion&quot; section of the newspaper. The sub-title of this report
says, &quot;devoid of celebration and camaraderie, the meeting is a deadly
serious power struggle.&quot;

In the body of the article, the newspaper says: &quot;Their agenda (of some of
the delegates) was clear: proposals on two centres of power, which would
allow Mbeki to stand for a third term as ANC president, were to be kicked in
the head; the popular movement supporting Zuma, which got ANC provinces to
force Luthuli House to reinstate him to ANC office at the party's Tshwane
National General Council in June 2005, was still on the march.&quot;

Thus, unashamedly the Sunday Times repeated the blatant lie that our
leadership had taken a decision in 2005 to remove Comrade Zuma from his
position as Deputy President of the ANC. This is despite the fact that all
that had happened was that, as he himself had explained, Comrade Zuma had
requested that he be excused from playing his role as Deputy President,
pending the conclusion of the judicial processes affecting him.

Absolutely nobody had removed him from his elected position, and neither had
he requested that this should be done. All our National Executive Committee
did was to accede to his request. And all that happened at the 2005 NGC was
that the NGC said it did not support the request Comrade Zuma had made, and
therefore resolved that he should resume his work as our Deputy President,
which Comrade Zuma accepted.

Because these truths do not serve its agenda, as the decisions of the 2007
Policy Conference obviously do not, the Sunday Times decided that it should
protect its true political intentions about our movement, and our country,
by surrounding them with a bodyguard of lies, to use an expression coined by
Winston Churchill during WWII.
Perhaps the Editor of the Sunday Times, Mr Mondli Makhanya, disclosed at
least part of the reason why the Sunday Times is so determined to
incorporate blatant lies in its armoury, as it continues its determined
campaign to misinform its readers. We refer here to his article in the same
July 1 edition, headed &quot;Having trusted leaders too much, we are ready to
take back our power&quot;.

In this article Mr Makhanya says: &quot;Now the nation and the ANC seem ready to
move and have developed a healthy suspicion of power. Ironically, the man
who created the conditions for breaking the stranglehold on power is none
other than Jacob Zuma, who has been a rallying point for those defiant of
the centre.

&quot;The Zuma camp's ability to stand up to the centre - albeit in defence of
wrong - has prised open the edifice that used to be the ANC.It is a good
space.

&quot;ANC members need to protect this space, if only for their own sake. In
doing so they will be accepting that democracy is sometimes ugly and its
outcomes are not always desirable. But democracy has an amazing way of
correcting itself.

&quot;The rest of society needs to know that the space is there to be used and it
is up to all South Africans to ensure that whatever leadership is elected in
December (at the ANC National Conference), knows it can never close that
space again.&quot;

From all this it is perfectly clear that what Mr Makhanya, and presumably
the newspaper he edits, seeks most fervently is to weaken the ANC. For this
reason, he argues that our principled cohesion and unity, which he falsely
characterises as &quot;enormous power and trust (given) to one individual&quot; - the
President - is inimical to the interests both of the ANC and the country.

In this regard, he writes that in 1997, &quot;Most members (of the ANC) believed
that there was no way an ANC president would misuse power entrusted him or
her by the people. How wrong they were.&quot;

Thus does he amplify the obscene allegation once made that our President is
a &quot;dictator&quot;. We understood when this accusation was made that it was
intended to weaken our movement, by discrediting its highest elected office.
The fact that it has now been repeated by the Editor of the Sunday Times,
who comforts himself with imagined decisions the Policy Conference never
adopted, in no way changes the intention of the allegation.

Obviously, Mr Makhanya either does not know the ANC or overestimates his
capacity to influence its membership, or both. As the delegates at the
Policy Conference confirmed, our movement is unequivocal in its respect for
the Constitution of the ANC and its rules, conventions and traditions.

Accordingly, our members fully understand the rights and responsibilities of
the President of the ANC, as defined by the ANC Constitution and decisions
of our National Conferences. Neither the Constitution nor the Conference
decisions in this regard were taken in error, subject to correction by Mr
Makhanya.

The ANC will continue to respect the principle and practice of democracy in
its work. At the same time, it will continue to defend the democratic
practice of respecting decisions taken by the majority. In this regard,
together with our Deputy President, Jacob Zuma, it will continue firmly to
oppose the disease of factionalism manifested as defiance of ANC decisions,
which Mr Makhanya is desperately keen to encourage, precisely to divide and
weaken our movement.

Being as old as we are, at 95 years, we are well-educated about the
&quot;Stratcom&quot; operations of the apartheid and previous regimes, which saw the
division, weakening and destruction of the ANC as a strategic task they had
to accomplish at all costs. We will therefore never hesitate to act and
speak out in defence of the principled cohesion and unity of the ANC, the
Alliance and the broad democratic movement, unequivocally repudiating all
lies in this regard, and opposing all hostile efforts intended to undermine
or block the achievement of this objective.

For over nine decades the ANC has insisted on the principle that in the end,
the truth must prevail. Our national history has consistently consigned to
its dustbin all those who resorted to lies to advance their objectives. At
the same time, the masses of our people, who have always refused to be
deceived, have consistently understood that only unjust causes, opposed to
their interests, fly only because they are borne aloft by a bundle of
portable lies.

We trust that, in time, Mr Makhanya will learn the important lesson about
his own people, our people, that these masses know that lies have short
legs, and therefore cannot travel far. As he learns this lesson, he might
also come to understand why the ANC, a product of generations of African and
black hope, which is deeply embedded in the psychology of these masses, is
accurately described as a parliament of the people. Our accession to
political power has not changed this truly historic and extraordinary
reality, which all members of the ANC have an absolute obligation to defend.

When he closed our Policy Conference, our President said: &quot;Since (the)
ill-intentioned &quot;predictions&quot; (of opponents of our movement that the Policy
Conference would be &quot;characterised by deep divisions and bitter conflicts
among ourselves&quot;) failed to materialise, I am certain that these
professional critics are already at work to invent new negatives to give
life to their negative campaigns.&quot;

The reports and comments published in the July 1 edition of the Sunday Times
confirmed the accuracy of the prediction made by our President, which was
warmly applauded and acknowledged by the Conference delegates.
It is clear that Mr Makhanya and the Sunday Times were not listening and
watching. But, to be fair, perhaps they did listen and watch. If they did,
the only conclusion we can reach is that they saw the assembled delegates as
being nothing more than a mindless rented crowd, hired to respond to a
paymaster who calls the tune.

Indeed this was suggested in the &quot;Hogarth&quot; column in the same July 1 edition
of the Sunday Times, which said the fact that our National Chairperson asked
the delegates to sing a freedom song that would communicate a mobilising
song to the nation, through the public broadcaster, the SABC, calling for
positive action to address our national challenges, &quot;was unusual&quot;! Clearly
the Sunday Times has a very perverse view of what is &quot;usual&quot;.

The foregoing communicates the message that the Editor, journalists and
sub-editors of the Sunday Times were obviously ready, and perhaps remain
ready to throw the public credibility of the newspaper to the winds,
provided this serves the political agenda of weakening and defeating the
ANC. The stark reality, confirmed during a period of more than nine testing
decades, is that they will fail.

The ANC centre will continue to hold. Nothing will fall apart. Democracy
both within the ANC and in our democratic Republic will continue to thrive,
including the guaranteed protection of freedom of the press, which also
covers the Sunday Times, but which this newspaper has regrettably and
seemingly decided to abuse by giving itself the freedom to operate free of
any moral code and without any rules, except those that maximise commercial
profit.

As has happened down the generations, the wilful dreams and &quot;predictions&quot; of
those who hate the idea of a strong and cohesive ANC that unites the nation,
and which is consciously supported by the masses of our people, will turn on
the dreamers and soothsayers as a haunting nightmare.

3.3 Why did Mbeki ignore a clear message from his party?

Paddy Harper, Sunday Times, 8 July 2007
The ANC may have sugar-coated its overwhelming rejection of a third term for
its president, but he seems to have paid it no heed at all.

An air of expectation hung over the main hall at Gallagher Estate in Midrand
at 10.30am last Saturday when President Thabo Mbeki took the podium. There
was good reason for it among the 1 500-odd ANC activists from around the
country who had been mandated to attend the conference, the precursor to the
ruling party’s elective conference in Limpopo in December.

The previous day, delegates at the ANC national policy conference had taken
their decision on how the party’s succession race would be decided: it would
be “preferable” if the party president and the president of the Republic
were one and the same person.

It was an ambiguously worded statement — the handiwork of ANC
secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe and political education head and NEC
member Joel Netshitenze — aimed at sparing Mbeki the embarrassment of being
overtly rejected by his own party faithful.

“There is general agreement that the ANC president should preferably be the
ANC candidate for the president of the Republic,” the conference’s report on
its commission dealing with organisation renewal read.

The “preferably” and the subsequent rider that “there was a strong view that
this must not be made a principle” were the face-saving mechanisms built in
to protect the President’s dignity.

The principles endorsed by the conference were that “the right of any member
to elect or be elected in the structures of the movement should be upheld”
and the ANC’s Constitution — which does not cap the number of terms a leader
can serve — would not be changed.

Mbeki has already served two terms as President of South Africa and is
automatically ruled out, unless the ANC does the unthinkable and tampers
with the Constitution, something that Motlanthe had dismissed out of hand
the previous afternoon.

While the wording of the ANC report was ambiguous, the message from the
delegates was not. Only two provinces, the Eastern Cape and North West, had
argued in favour of a third term for Mbeki as ANC president.

With them stood the party’s provincial chairmen, members of Cabinet and some
members of the NEC. Against this position stood the party’s Youth and Women’
s leagues, its provincial secretaries and its seven other provinces, among
them the most powerful, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal.

Hard bargaining had taken place all the way, with Motlanthe conceding on
Friday that the ANC leadership had battled to keep discussions focused on
policy — the aim of the conference — because of the heated emotions
surrounding the succession. ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma’s earlier
statements that he would stand if nominated, his premature backing by the
Youth League and KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape’s nomination of Mbeki for a
third term and tycoon Tokyo Sexwale’s self-nomination as a contender had all
fed into this.

But by the end of the week’s discussions, there was a discernable shift in
discussions at the policy conference. The issue was no longer about Zuma and
his suitability — or otherwise — for the ANC’s top job. It was now about
Mbeki, and the reality that despite his splendid performance as party
president and head of government, his party’s membership believes that his
time — in both roles — is up.

Delegates who are no fans of Zuma were openly siding with his backers on the
third-term issue, while even the divided Eastern Cape somersaulted and stood
with those who had earlier opposed it on the matter.

Organisationally, powers are to be devolved to the secretary-general’s
office and the party’s constitutional structures.

On policy, matters remained on an even keel, with no massive jump to the
left.

So when Mbeki did speak on Saturday, his closing address was a far cry from
what it could — and should — have been. There were the now-customary attacks
on the media and members of the ANC speaking out of school.

The “professional critics” were “already at work to invent new negatives”,
he said.

Members and structures were “openly defying decisions legitimately taken by
the constitutional structures of our movement”, causing “members of our
leadership structures, including the National Working Committee and the
National Executive Committee, deliberately, intentionally and anonymously to
leak to the mass media the proceedings of even these senior committees of
our movement”.

The conference deliberations, he said, “represent a sensitive and accurate
response to the voice of the people”. Then the President told delegates to
“abide by the majority decisions adopted during our meetings”, and “refuse
to succumb to what might ... present itself as genuinely a popular view ...
regardless of whether, objectively, it serves the interests of the people”.

The conference, he said, had not been about “deep divisions and bitter
conflicts among ourselves”.

Nowhere was there any kind of direct reference to what amounted to a
unanimous decision and statement of what the party’s membership preferred
come December.

But it was what Mbeki did not say that was more important. He failed totally
to respond to the clear message sent to him and his backers from the
membership of the party he leads.

Instead, he walked out of the hall and straight into a cordoned-off holding
area in which he conducted an interview with the SABC in which he said he
was still in the running for the ANC’s top post.

Asked if he would be available to stand again, Mbeki said: “If the
leadership generally said, ‘Look, we believe the interests of the ANC and
the country would be best served if we had somebody else’, that’s fine.

“But if they said, ‘No, you better stay for whatever good reason’, that
would be fine. You couldn’t act in a way that disrespected such a view.”

Why did the President ignore the issue in the ANC forum and declare —
literally minutes later — his position to the national broadcaster?

Much has been made of his use of the term “leadership” in the face of what
is effectively rejection by the party’s members.

Mbeki’s detractors are crude in their analysis: the man is addicted to
power; he fears payback from those who have faced the might of the state’s
prosecution machine during his term in office (something suffered by
ex-presidents in Zambia and Malawi); he has no confidence in his fellow ANC
leaders’ ability and wants to run Tuynhuys from Luthuli House. They further
allege a desire to maintain control over the massive reservoir of patronage
the ANC presidency commands (albeit in scaled-down fashion if the Midrand
proposals are endorsed in December) and a will to anoint his own successor.

They also believe Mbeki wants the glory of being head of the ruling party
come 2010 and the ANC centenary celebrations in 2012. An even more sinister
ambition — to use the ANC presidency to engineer a third term as President
of the Republic — is also whispered, increasingly loudly these days.

His backers are equally simplistic: there is nobody else fit for the job
among the current crop of leaders ; should Mbeki stand down, the way will be
open for a disastrous Zuma presidency.

The whispering campaigns by both sides are already in full cry, with the
spin on the sidelines now focusing on proposals for both Mbeki and Zuma to
be returned to their existing ANC positions and a third — as yet unnamed —
leader to step forward as President of the Republic.

This is, however, not a reflection of what the ANC’s delegates, carrying
mandates from their local members, have decided on how the elective process
between now and December should be determined.

Such an option would only temporarily stand down the camps that have been
mobilised, at the same time creating a party power structure parallel to the
one in the Union Buildings.

Both Mbeki and Zuma, for different but converging reasons, should
“preferably” remove themselves from the equation, clearing the way for a new
leader once the ANC nomination processes start in September.

Linguistic footwork a reach for power?

Xolela Mangcu, Weekender, 7 July 2007
So who says a virus cannot cause a syndrome? Methinks the virus of power is
causing the “big man” syndrome at the Union Buildings. President Thabo Mbeki
said it would be fine if members of the African National Congress (ANC)
wanted him to stay on for a third term as their president. Then he said he
would not be the least bothered if they chose someone else. Talk about
covering your bases. But why can’t our reluctant leader say, “Thanks, but no
thanks”?

Judging by their behaviour at the policy conference, the members would have
understood. To lessen the workload, they even suggested he should hand over
his powers of appointment. To deprive a politician of such powers is to
deprive him of his identity.

You see, I think Mbeki has himself to blame for this. The party gave him
carte blanche over everything. And then they watched rather helplessly as he
utilised that power to raise himself above the party. And now the party is
simply reclaiming what it has given him.

Mbeki should just make this whole thing easy on himself, and easy on the
rest of us, by walking quietly into the sunset. He could still play a
powerful role as an elder statesman and international diplomat with all the
benefits and privileges that retired presidents have. That would certainly
be better than the indignity of being carted off in a wheelbarrow by unruly
mobs.

If anyone came out looking good in all of this it was ANC secretary-general
Kgalema Mothlante (Comrade S-G). He was so effusive you could tell the man
was riding on something. He emerged from the conference to inform us that
the party faithful would not expediently change the party’s constitution to
enhance one candidate or the other. I may not be a “rigorous student of
language”, but any change would have been to Mbeki’s benefit. Smart Alec,
that Kgalema, I tell you.

Personally I am confused as to whether Comrade S-G’s linguistic footwork was
a Freudian slip, an Acton-ian reprimand of Mbeki, a Machiavellian reach for
power, a Fanonesque intimation of a revolution under way, or purely a
Wittgensteinian play with words.

But Comrade S-G should be careful with this linguistic thing. In Mbeki’s
corner sits someone that my fellow columnist Tim Cohen called the Omniscient
One. This dude will figure out Comrade S-G’s intentions long before Comrade
S-G himself has figured them out. And Comrade S-G will discover that he is a
cog in a global imperialist scheme like the rest of us.

But Comrade S-G faces yet another challenge, and this has to do with his
credibility within the party. Remember, he chastised Tokyo Sexwale for
announcing his availability to lead the ANC on the BBC.

I am waiting with baited breath to see if he will call Mbeki to order for
announcing his candidacy on the SABC. Only then will we really know that
power has shifted from the presidency to Comrade S-G’s office. But then
again, Mbeki’s saving grace may be that he made his announcement on the
native SABC and not the colonial BBC.

Zuma camp on a roll

S'thembiso Msomi, City Press, 8 July 2007
ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma and his supporters have stepped up their
campaign to have him elected party leader at the end of the year.

Barely a week after the ANC national policy conference showed that party
support for Zuma and President Thabo Mbeki is almost equal, &quot;JZ&quot; was out
winning hearts and minds by building a school in Limpopo.

He officiated at a sod-turning ceremony to build a school in the district of
Sekgosese. The school is made up of eight classrooms and an administration
block and is to be built by his Jacob Zuma Trust.

Until now, the trust has focused its projects in KwaZulu-Natal. Friday's
event is seen as an attempt to consolidate Zuma's support base in other
areas.

His supporters in the South African Communist Party (SACP), which is aligned
to the ANC, are also consolidating their power base before December by
kicking out those said not to be loyal to Zuma.

The SACP will hold its 12th national congress in Port Elizabeth from
Wednesday to Sunday.

SACP chairperson, Safety and Security Minister Charles Nqakula, is set to be
replaced by former unionist Gwede Mantashe. He has been nominated by seven
provinces and the Young Communist League (YCL).

Writing in his online column this week, YCL national secretary Buti
Manamela - who has close ties to SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande -
said the outcome of the congress &quot;will have an impact on the ANC 52nd
national conference''.

Manamela said yesterday that the YCL had nominated Nqakula to serve as an
ordinary member of the central committee (CC). The league wanted him
replaced as chairperson because he did not have enough time for the SACP.

The SACP and YCL are among Zuma's most vocal backers in the ANC-led
alliance.

Other office-bearers to be replaced are deputy chairperson and senior
manager in the National Prosecuting Authority, Dipuo Mvelase, and suspended
SACP national treasurer Phillip Dexter.

Running for Mvelase's position is the Eastern Cape's Ncumisa Nkondlo.
Eastern Cape provincial secretary Phumulo Masualle has been nominated for
national treasurer.

Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, who has been nominated by the YCL,
is likely to make it into the CC.

Those who may be out of the CC are Cosatu president Willie Madisha and
Provincial and Local Government Affairs Minister Sydney Mufamadi, who are
accused of being in &quot;the Mbeki camp&quot;.

If the Zuma camp has its way this week, Intelligence Minister and party
stalwart Ronnie Kasrils will be the only cabinet member in the CC.

But Zuma's opponents in the SACP have fielded their own candidate, Gauteng
secretary Zico Tamela, to race against Nzimande.

However, it is highly unlikely that Tamela will win as Nzimande has
unanimous support in seven of the nine provinces. Limpopo is said to be
divided.

As the congress draws nearer, questions are being asked about one of
Nzimande's most trusted lieutenants, KZN secretary Themba Mthembu.

Mthembu, who will be leading the largest delegation at the congress, has
been accused of turning state witness against three of his comrades in the
1980s.

He is alleged to have testified against ANC underground operatives George
Sithole, Jabulani Ngcobo and Titi Mthenjane, who served time on Robben
Island as a result. Mthembu yesterday declined to comment and referred City
Press to provincial party chairperson Willies Mchunu.

The allegations are not new. They were first brought to the party's
attention more than a year ago and two senior CC members, Ben Martins and
Yunus Carrim, were appointed to investigate.

Nzimande's detractors now accuse the SACP boss of either squashing the probe
or influencing the outcome in Mthembu's favour. But Nzimande this week
denied this. He said the probe found there &quot;was no basis&quot; for the
allegations.

Mchunu also blamed the accusations on a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; between Mthembu
and the others at the time of their arrest.

He denied that Mthembu had sent his comrades to the island.

ht__national/&gt; 3.6 Challenge to Blade?

Rapule Tabane, Mail &amp; Guardan, 6 July 2007
The SACP in Gauteng has nominated its provincial secretary, Zico Tamela, to
challenge Blade Nzimande for the general secretary's post in a move
calculated to embarrass Nzimande.

The SACP will elect new leaders at its national conference that takes place
at the Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth from next Wednesday to
Saturday.

Tamela is the leader of a vocal province that has challenged Nzimande's
support for Jacob Zuma, reluctance to see the SACP go it alone in elections,
and what some say are authoritarian clamps on dissent in the party.

But insiders say that Nzimande enjoyed support from the majority of the
provinces and will steamroll any challenge.

Besides leadership, the party will debate whether to contest elections
independently of the ANC and the SACP's medium-term vision to ensure a
working-class hold over all key levers of society.

M&amp;G interviews indicate that Nzimande and deputy general secretary Jeremy
Cronin enjoy wide popularity and are likely to keep their posts. But
Gauteng, Limpopo and some regions feel they need a new general secretary
bold enough to take the party on a new path independent of the ANC.

Party chairperson Charles Nqakula could lose his seat if provinces decide to
nominate former National Union of Mineworkers secretary Gwede Mantashe for
chairperson. Provincial leaders say Mantashe is a hardworking communist and
contrast him with Provincial and Local Government Affairs Minister Sydney
Mufamadi, who looks set to lose his party leadership position.

Sources in the party say Mufamadi had attended fewer than half of the
party's central committee meetings. It appears Intelligence Minister Ronnie
Kasrils will keep his position in the central committee. Kasrils is critical
of Zuma, who is popular in the party's structures.

SACP North West secretary Madoda Sambatha says provinces would consult one
another on whom to nominate for the positions of chairperson, treasurer and
deputy chairperson. The post of national treasurer is vacant after Phillip
Dexter was suspended for a year for publicly criticising the party.

Party members say his position is likely to be contested by Eastern Cape
chairperson Phumulo Masualle and former party spokesperson Mazibuko Jara.
Masualle last year lost to Siphato Handi in a battle for the position of ANC
provincial secretary.

Dipuo Mvelase is the current deputy chairperson.

Provincial leaders have said that their criteria in electing the leadership
would be to find people who are prepared to set aside time to work on party
activities.

&quot;In the past we have elected people simply because they were 'senior'
comrades. But their seniority has not been matched by actual commitment to
the party,&quot; says one leader.

The biggest debate at the congress will be on proposals for the party to
contest elections on its own. While there appears to be grass roots
consensus that the party stand, the detail will provoke sharp debate.

While provinces such as Gauteng and the Eastern Cape are likely to push for
the party to take a decision now and start contesting for the 2009 general
election, the M&amp;G has learnt that some provinces will propose that the
congress take a decision in principle to contest and then mandate the newly
elected central committee to investigate the means of doing so and report
back to a special congress next year.

This, however, is a ploy in anticipation of the outcome of the ANC national
conference in December and take a decision on the future direction based on
the kind of leadership that emerges from the Polokwane ­gathering.

3.7 Crunch time for the SACP

S'thembiso Msomi, City Press, 8 July 2007
Blade Nzimande nearly lost his life at the hands of his comrades. This was
back in the early 1990s, at the height of KwaZulu-Natal’s political
violence.

The people who wanted to take him out were ANC members in the Midlands
region who had close ties with ANC and South African Communist Party (SACP)
stalwart Harry Gwala.

The architect of the plot was said to be the then ANC regional secretary,
Sifiso Nkabinde. He was ­later expelled by the party amid allegations of
being an apartheid spy.

As the story goes, Nzimande and fellow communist, Ben Martins, had been
informed by ANC intelligence and senior party leaders, including the late
Chris Hani, in the early 1990s that Nkabinde was an enemy agent.

The two, who were SACP leaders in the region at the time, set out to warn
Gwala, who was close to Nkabinde.

But Nkabinde got wind of what the two were saying to the former Robben
Island prisoner affectionately known as Mdala, the elder.

Nkabinde then allegedly began spreading the story that the two wanted to
wrestle the ANC chairmanship from Gwala in the region.

Gwala’s relationship with the two was already strained because they had
disagreed with his approach to dealing with the political violence in the
province.

At that time, the two dominant voices in the province were those of Gwala
and Jacob Zuma.

While the militant Gwala wanted a military solution to the violence, Zuma
preached the less-popular gospel of “peace talks” with the then enemy,
Mangosuthu Buthelezi’s Inkatha Freedom Party.

For Nzimande and Martins, the answer lay somewhere between the two extremes.
They argued for a more creative approach.

Gwala was not happy, especially since the two were from his region. So
Nkabinde was able to drive a wedge between Gwala and Nzimande.

Things got so bad that Nzimande, who was an SACP central committee member,
took the matter to the party.

Gwala, an SACP crowd-puller at the time, was suspended from the party as a
result. SACP leaders ­accused him of “Stalinist” tendencies and political
intolerance.

The Lion of Pietermaritzburg, as Gwala was known, passed away in 1995, but
not before apologising to Nzimande and Martins. He acknow­ledged that he was
“wrong” and had been misled by “the enemy”.

The irony is that more than a decade later, Nzimande now stands ­accused of
“Stalinistic tendencies” by SACP members who say he is “stifling debate” in
the party ranks.

His detractors point to the recent suspension of the party’s national
treasurer, Phillip Dexter, for a year, the expulsion of the party’s former
spokesperson, Mazibuko Jara, from the Young Communist League and the
disbandment of several party structures.

Dexter’s suspension means that he cannot participate in this week’s SACP
national congress in Port Elizabeth. This, in effect, rules him out of the
party leadership for the next five years.

Nzimande’s detractors allege that a “major purge” is on the cards this week.
They say that the likes of Provincial and Local Government Minister Sydney
Mufamadi, Limpopo Premier Sello Moloto and national chairperson Charles
Nqakula may be shown the door.

All the “purged” people and structures are said to have one thing in
common – they are critical of Nzimande’s leadership as the party’s general
secretary. They are particularly unhappy with his close ties to Zuma and
claim that he has turned the party into a campaign machine for the ANC
deputy president before the ruling party’s national conference in December.

But Nzimande this week denied these claims.

“There is no-one I have targeted not to be re-elected. There is no-one I
want to purge,” he said in an interview with City Press.

The SACP leader had much on his mind this week. When City Press caught up
with him, Nzimande was busy preparing his political report for the congress
while making ­arrangements for his mother’s birthday party, which took place
in Pietermaritzburg yesterday.

Nzimande’s mother, Nozipho, who is a nurse by training, turned 80 on June
20.

The party’s 12th national ­congress comes at a time when the SACP is at a
crossroads. Some of its members are saying it is time that it fielded its
own candidates for public office.

Much of this is informed by the frustration of the SACP and Cosatu at the
manner in which the ANC-led alliance has been operating since it took over
power in 1994.

But it appears this frustration has not reached a point where
