Classic pose for a sunken ship, masts still in place, too deep for
anything more than brief dives they make their own ROV and search
remotely.  The cargo was salt, thrown over board when the ship was
sinking, too bad a local Salt Museum was interested.

LAKE ONTARIO: Team finds 19th century schooner preserved near Oak
Orchard Harbor

By Molly Coats/ Intern

- Finding shipwrecks and having an adventure usually reserved for sea-
faring divers is not so far-fetched for western New York, as
researchers Jim Kennard and Dan Scoville have discovered.
The duo recently found a 19th century schooner, possibly the oldest
found to date, resting at the bottom of Lake Ontario off Oak Orchard
Harbor in Point Breeze. According to Kennard, the discovery of the
Milan was exciting because the ship is in relatively decent shape for
having been at the bottom of a lake for nearly 160 years.

&quot;The masts are still attached to the ship,&quot; he said. &quot;Usually they
break off and fall next to the ship.&quot;

Kennard and Scoville have been working together for several years
trying to find the Milan as well as discovering other ships in the
area. Some of the team's Lake Ontario finds include the Homer Warren
and the Etta Belle. All of these discoveries took years of researching
and trying to determine where the ships were located based on reports
and old news stories, according to Kennard.
&quot;Trying to find a wreck in Lake Ontario is like trying to find the tip
of a pencil eraser in a football field at the rate of two square feet
per day,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to be a shipwreck detective to come up
with a general area of where the ship is. We'd been searching for (the
Milan) for a couple years.&quot;

Once the ship was found in 2005 using a side scan sonar method,
Kennard and Scoville began planning their exploration. One of the
biggest obstacles the team faced was the depth at which the Milan
laid, said Scoville.

&quot;It was too deep to safely send a diver down,&quot; he said. &quot;There are a
lot of risks with technical diving and once you reach the bottom, you
can only spend 10 or 15 minutes searching the wreck.&quot;

To continue their research, the team needed a way to take pictures and
video without placing any lives in danger. Scoville, who was a senior
at the Rochester Institute of Technology at the time, said he took the
opportunity to create a Remotely Operated Vehicle as his senior
project with the help of some of his fellow students.

&quot;The ROV can stay at the bottom taking video for hours a day,&quot; he
said. &quot;It was expensive to create at first, but after that it cost a
lot less than technical diving.&quot;

According to Scoville, the ROV is a small device with multiple cameras
and high-intensity lights attached to it in air-tight containers. The
device is attached to a 680-foot-long fiber-optic cable which sends
images to a laptop computer. Researchers can operate the device via
remote control in the safety of their boat, eliminating the risks of
diving.

Upon graduating from RIT, Scoville sold the intellectual properties of
the ROV to Henrietta-based company Hydroacoustics, Inc. Scoville now
works for the company developing the next generation of ROVs.

With the means to explore the wreck available in summer of 2006, the
team began their research. The images sent back by the ROV proved to
be valuable as Kennard and Scoville discovered how unique the Milan
was to Lake Ontario's southern shores.
&quot;The ship had a tiller, whereas most ships after 1850 had a wheel and
a rudder,&quot; Kennard said. &quot;This gave us a better idea of how old the
ship was, which helped us make a better case that this was in fact the
Milan.&quot;

Other features helping the team determine they had found the Milan
included a scroll bow, which Kennard said is unique to ships of the
time period. Kennard said he knew of one other ship, called the
Oxford, found in Lake Erie, that had the same type of bow. The ship
was built by Asa Wilcox and based on the comparison of bows, the team
was able to definitely say the Milan was also built by Wilcox at Three-
Mile Bay in 1845, according to Kennard.

&quot;There is no name plate on the Milan,&quot; he said. &quot;Sometimes they paint
the name on but it comes off. We sent for enrollment papers that give
information on when the ship was built, where it's been and all the
specifics, and this helped us make all these conclusions.&quot;

After releasing the Milan story, Kennard was contacted by
representatives of the Salt Museum in Liverpool, N.Y. The museum was
interested in the ship because it had been carrying 1,000 barrels of
salt when it sank. Kennard said they did not find any barrels of salt
because the crew tossed them overboard before abandoning the schooner.

Based on records and the condition of the wreckage, Kennard said the
team concluded that the ship had sprung a leak during a voyage in 1849
and the crew changed direction in an attempt to run ashore. The leak
could not be found and the crew was forced to abandon ship, letting it
sink.

All of the information and images gathered during the exploration
allowed team artist Roland &quot;Chip&quot; Stevens to come up with a sketch of
how the schooner looks in its current condition. He will also be able
to make a rough sketch of what the ship looked like during the four
years it was in service, according to Kennard.
&quot;You don't have photographs of ships like this from when they were
built, so being able to bring back images of what they looked like is
something special,&quot; he said.

As for the future of the ship, Scoville said the team's work is
basically finished. Any further research would require approval from
New York state to do an archaeological survey, which costs much more
than anything they have done so far.

&quot;Obviously the more you look the more likely you are to notice things
you didn't see before,&quot; Scoville said. &quot;We've concluded our
investigation, so the Milan will probably stay right where it is for
now.

Hmm ... that must be why it's hard for people to locate the Ogopogo in Lake
Okanagan and Nessie in the Loch Ness.

Don't know what made me think of that ...

Beautiful.  I hope they don't even *think* about trying to recover it.

A schooner from the mid 1800's was recovered about 1960 from Lake
Superior; after they got the mud out of it, it floated with no
assistance.  Wonderful condition; they gave tours, etc.  It's completely
gone now, rotted by neglect, poor planning, and lack of financing.  All
that's left is a few artifacts in a museum.

Since then the preservers have learned that a porous object that has
been underwater for many years needs to be kept wet and the fluid
replaced with something else, usually a wax.

I think they knew it then.  My point is that everyone is eager to
&quot;rescue&quot; these wrecks, but very few are willing to put in the time,
effort, money, etc, to preserve them.  Even when huge resources are
available, the problems persist; the Swedes are having issues yet with
the Vasa, and it's not for lack of funding.  I think the wreck is safest
on the ocean bottom.

I have heard that many people think the way you do - that ocean bed ship
&quot;graveyards&quot; should remain undisturbed in the way that human remains on land
are.

That's fine if you can keep a 24/7/365/6 watch on the wreck and all
the others. Divers go for those valuable objects, usually buried
beneath sand or mud and disturb the wreck, sometimes to the point of
destroying it. Even the act of anchoring near a wreck can pull it
apart and destroy it.
