Forbidden names: identity and the law

Combining your name with that of your spouse seems like a perfectly
natural thing to do in a modern society. But things can be complicated
if you live in Sweden, says Elizabeth Dacey-Fondelius.

Anne Reath from Australia never gave the Swedish name law a second
thought when she married her partner and became Anne Reath Warren. She
definitely never considered that the law might get in the way of her
children also becoming Reath Warrens. But archaic Swedish regulations
mean that this is exactly what happened.

Anne's older daughter, born before she married husband Pierre, enjoys
the style Tess Reath Warren, blending the name of her mother and her
father, just as both parents wanted. Younger sister Veronica, born
after the marriage, is plain old Veronica Warren. She is barred by law
from becoming a Reath Warren like her older sibling.

Strictly speaking, Tess bears Anne's maiden name as a 'mellannamn',
which seemingly translate as 'middle name' but is actually a uniquely
Swedish construction that is more of a secondary surname than a given
name.

At the time older daughter Tess was born her parents didn't share a
surname, so there was no problem getting a mellannamn approved. But as
Veronica was born after Anne had changed her name, she was not allowed
to inherit her mother's maiden name.

&quot;I can't believe the law won't allow my children to have the same
name,&quot; Anne says.

Sweden started regulating names in the early twentieth century, after
concern that disreputable people were adopting noble names. The laws
have been reformed since then; in 1983 it was made possible for men to
adopt their wife or partner's name, as well as for women to adopt
their husband's name.

But in recent years, people have started asking why the state needs to
take such an interest in what people call themselves.

&quot;There are too many restrictions,&quot; says Johan Linander, a Centre Party
member of parliament, who is in favour of reforming the law.

&quot;I think it should be a matter for people's free choice what they call
themselves.&quot;

As well the mellannamn issue, the name law is controversial in a
number of respects. It bans people from adopting first names or place
names as surnames, or for people to adopt a 'generally known' foreign
surname - meaning Springsteen might be tricky, while a more obscure
name might be easier to get past the bureaucrats.

Swedish law also has plenty to say about first names. The tax
authority can veto parents' choice of name for a new-born baby if
officials decide the name could &quot;cause trouble&quot; for the child later in
life.

They can also ban names if they 'have the character of a surname' -
even though using surnames as given names is a common practice outside
the Nordic region. While Wallenberg or Reinfeldt might jar as first
names, many people elsewhere have taken to the practice. What, for
instance, would the Swedish authorities have made of Jude Law's sons
Rafferty and Finlay? Or Macaulay Culkin, Lennox Lewis, Mackenzie Crook
and Fletcher Christian, for that matter?

Despite the questions over this part of the name law it is the
mellannamn law that raises most objections.

People have complained that the law is applied unevenly, with rulings
depending largely on the preferences of individual bureaucrats. For
instance, a couple was initially banned from calling their daughter
Metallica (a decision later overturned), authorities in another part
of Sweden allowed a baby boy to be called Google. The law also brings
problems for transgender people, as the rules make it hard to change
the gender of forenames.

The problems with the law governing mellannamn were highlighted
recently when a couple from southern Sweden said they would divorce if
that's what it took to allow their son to bear both their surnames.
Lars Jensen and Lina Wernström Jensen described the authorities'
ruling that their son Aksel could not be named Aksel Wernström Jensen
as long as they were married as &quot;absolutely absurd&quot;.

Perhaps here I should declare a personal interest. The name law first
became an issue for me when my husband and I were deciding our
post-marital family name. We talked through the possibility of taking
each other's surnames as mellannamn. We then learned that I could
become a Dacey Fondelius or he could become a Fondelius Dacey, but
swapping names was definitely out of the question. The law only lets
one the couple to have a mellannamn at all.

After this discovery, we felt it was rather pointless for either of us
to consider taking a mellannamn. How would we choose? It seemed rather
backwards to restrict our options. Luckily for us, I was able to
change my name in my home country to a hyphenated surname and my
husband took my surname as his mellannamn.

Another problem with the name law is that it clashes with fellow EU
nations' name traditions. Lars Tegenfeldt, legal expert at the Swedish
Tax Authority admitted, &quot;The Swedish name does not harmonize with name
structures of other cultures including countries within the EU.&quot;

Johan Linander argues that the law &quot;is based on the principle that the
whole of Sweden has the same name culture - but this is not the case.&quot;

For Spaniards living in Sweden, the rigid rules can be a particular
source of frustration. It is customary in Spain - and in some other
Spanish-speaking countries - for children to take the names of both
parents.

Pepi, a Spanish national living in Sweden, decided to conform to
Swedish name tradition and take her husband Anders' surname. Since she
was able to keep her Spanish surname as a mellannamn, she was under
the false sense of security that her children would also be entitled
to her maiden name as a mellannamn.

However, mellannamn cannot be passed to children. Even changing back
to Pepi's original Spanish name won't help give her name to her sons
because Sweden inverts the name order of her Spanish name. Her
original surname is regarded as a former mellannman.

Pepi has cautioned her other Spanish friends to keep their Spanish
names when marrying if they intend to follow Spanish name structure.
&quot;Because they saw the trouble I have they didn't change their names
when they married.&quot;

It could also be said that the law is sexist, given that in the
overwhelming majority of cases it is the man's name that is passed
down to children. Magnus Jacobsson, a spokesperson for Jäm-O, the
Swedish equal opportunity ombudsman, concedes, &quot;It's arguable that the
mellannamn [restrictions are] structurally discriminatory against
women.&quot;

It is hard to find anyone to defend the name law, but despite repeated
efforts by various politicians, the rules remain. Even the bureaucrats
charged with enforcing the law want things changed.

The Swedish Patent Office, which is responsible for enforcing the law,
has recommended a string of changes, including making it possible for
each member of a couple to take the other's name and for children to
inherit both parents' surnames. As long ago as 2001, the Swedish
parliament told the government to change the rules, but still there
are no proposals on the table.

The current government vowed last year to carry out a review of the
law, but there has so far been no further movement on the issue,
prompting Moderate MP Gustav Blix to submit another motion to
parliament in October calling for action.

With government, public authorities and politicians supporting reform,
many feel action is well overdue.

&quot;I hope there will be a change soon,&quot; says Johan Linander. Couples
contending with bureaucratic rules are likely to raise a glass to
that.
