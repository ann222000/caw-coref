Hello,

The dizziness is the symptom of strain.

The need to wear sunglasses is merely a fear of the light, and an
abnormality of the vision. Accustom yourself to bright light; learn to
look at the sun without discomfort.

Discard the stupid sunglasses, and the contact lenses, and learn to
cure yourself by treatment without artificial correction.

Are they prescription or non prescription sunglasses?  If prescription
and you have not worn glasses for 7 years, it may take some time to
get used to the distortions.  If non prescription, take them back to
where you bought them and exchange for another pair; they may have
warped lenses.

The fact that a period of time must be taken in order to 'get used' to
the external body is an obvious evidence that the eye resents the

yeah this is a prescription glasses
if i like, beginning only use the glasses during evenings for TV/
etc...  will i eventually get used to it? do u know how long roughly ?

If you do not have time to read the entire book, then this is OK.

Read the shortened companion book, 'Stories from the Clinic'.

This will suffice.

Don't spend too long in the ozone. Newsgroup trolls seem to gravitate here.

I gather you weren't wearing glasses much? It helps for us to know your
actual prescriptions.

Lenses with corrective power also have the side-effect of magnifying or
minifying. The mag/min effect is multiplied by the prescription, and the
distance off your eye. Your contacts don't magnify or minify, because these
effects approach zero at the cornea.

New glasses can have a dramatically different &quot;feel&quot; due to mag differences,
when you're used to contacts only, or an old blurry pair of eyeglasses. If
the new glasses give excellent vision, equal in both eyes, you should try a
week or so to &quot;get used to them.&quot;

It's true that new glasses can wind up stronger than necessary, and a short
re-check of the refraction usually identifies this.

Mike,
Precisely
Without regard to Nick:
Probably little bit  better idea is to use without
Why it is not too late.

Or
take multifocal contact lens
Attach to camera objective
Keep trying to receive good quality picture.

If it takes longer than a few hours to get used to a new prescription, the
glasses are probably wrong in one way or another.  Every time this has
happened to me (3 times in 50 years) they had to make new ones.

It's actually 4 times -- I got my first pair when I was 16 and they just
felt WRONG so I never wore them. Then I just figured it was my eyes (even
smart kids can be really dumb sometimes).  Now I'd take them back.

thanks all
i dun have the actual prescription. but i know that the glasses is
400degrees both sides. i haven't used any glasses since 7 years ago.
anyway, my contacts power is -4.5. the optometrist recommended me to
reduce to -3.6 or something, since my eyes has apparently improved.
the glasses do gives me excellent vision.
i think i'll try it for 1 week, if not ill find another optometrist,
and go for better lens like nikon huh

I'm one of the sane non-pro's here, so my comments are based on my
experience with corrective lenses (22 years for glasses, 1 year for
contacts).  By sane, I mean not one of the kooks talking about the
fraudulent, completely ineffective nonsense based on the late and
unlamented &quot;Dr.&quot; Bates.

I didn't see you state your prescription in the thread anywhere, so
I'll state that mine (with contacts) is -3.75 in each eye, so you know
where I'm coming from.

As Mike Tyner pointed out, negative lenses some distance in front of
your eye have the effect of shrinking the world.  There are other
distortions as well, but the shrinking effect is the most prominent,
at least in my experience.

Contacts don't have these problems - the world appears at normal size
through contacts.

Here's the part you may not like.  If you're going to be switching
between contact lenses and glasses, you will *always* have this effect
for some period of time after switching from one to the other.

Each time I switch between contacts and glasses, the change in visual
scale makes things look odd for a short while (less than an hour is my
best guess without making any attempt to time the adjustment period).
In general, I find going from contacts to glasses more annoying than
vice versa.

As I said, that's for -3.75.  The amount of minification through
glasses depends on the strength of the negative lens.  The estimate I
saw for typical eye-lens distance with a prescription of -5.00 was a
15% reduction in apparent size.  If you have a stronger prescription
than me, you'll probably require a bit more time to adjust when
switching between contacts and glasses.  If weaker, a bit less.

But if you're actually talking about new non-prescription sunglasses,
I have no idea how to interpret your question, and you can disregard
all of the above.
