This is a Sephardic recipe.

Orange-Almond Flan

Adapted from Dulce lo Vivas, by Ana Bensadón (Ediciones Martínez Roca)

Time: 1 hour 30 minutes, plus 2 hours chilling

3 cups granulated sugar
8 large egg yolks
4 large eggs
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
3/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
3/4 cup whole blanched almonds, finely ground, or 1 cup finely ground
almonds

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium saucepan, combine 1 cup sugar
with 1/4 cup water. Stir until completely dissolved. Place pan over medium
heat, stirring constantly, until syrup begins to bubble. Stop stirring and
allow pan to sit until syrup begins to turn golden at edges, brushing down
any sugar crystals with a brush dipped in cold water. Occasionally rotate
pan to mix syrup without stirring it, then replace over heat. Continue
doing this until syrup is evenly golden brown. Pour caramel into an 8-inch
round flan mold or cake pan, or 10 to 12 3-inch fluted molds, tilting to
spread caramel evenly along bottom. Set aside. In a medium saucepan, mix
together remaining 2 cups sugar with 1 cup water. Bring to a boil over
medium heat, and boil for 4 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to
cool until lukewarm. Whisk together yolks and whole eggs until blended,
then pour through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl. Add orange zest,
orange juice and ground almonds. Whisk in sugar syrup. Pour into
caramel-lined mold or molds, filling to just below rim. Cover mold or
molds tightly with foil. Place mold or molds into a larger pan. Pour
enough hot water into large pan to reach halfway up side of flan mold.
Bake until a knife inserted halfway into flan comes out clean, 30 minutes
to 1 hour, depending on type of pan and oven used. Allow flan to cool,
then refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours. Just before
serving, warm base of pan by dipping it briefly in a pan of hot water.
Invert onto a plate, and serve immediately.

Yield: 8 servings with large mold; 10 to 12 with smaller molds.
