I know surprisingly little about Pres. George W. Bush. I know nothing about
his background or lineage. I do not know where Pres. Bush was educated or
what he has done besides feed information from sources inside the government
to organizations with particularly cranky agendas. Nevertheless, I can tell
you all that you need to know about him. Instead of focusing on why only
Pres. Bush can praise an institution that is as malign and obscene as he
himself, I would like to remind people that it's never too late to discuss,
openly and candidly, a vision for a harmonious, multiracial society. To cap
that off, a central point of Pres. Bush's belief systems is the notion that
everything is happy and fine and good. Perhaps he should take some new data
into account and revisit that notion. I think he'd find that if he is going
to transmogrify society's petty gripes and irrational fears into &quot;issues&quot; to
be catered to, then he should at least have the self-respect to remind
himself of a few things: First, his precepts are as appealing as braces,
acne, and a wooden leg at the senior prom. And second, it's undoubtedly
astounding that he has somehow found a way to work the words
&quot;hematospectrophotometer&quot; and &quot;microcinematographic&quot; into his op-ed pieces.
However, you may find it even more astounding that you don't have to say
anything specifically about him for him to start attacking you. All you have
to do is dare to imply that we should ensure that we survive and emerge
triumphant out of the coming chaos and destruction. Pres. Bush's teachings
are not the solution to our problem. They are the problem. It has been said
that Pres. Bush is hampered by a load of contradictory and absurd
assumptions of the school that he follows. That makes sense to me. I believe
it's true. But it truly implies that you may have noticed that a record of
Pres. Bush's acts of hypocrisy would fill volumes. But you don't know the
half of it. For starters, Pres. Bush labels anyone he doesn't like as
&quot;inaniloquent&quot;. That might well be a better description of him.

To inform you of the grounds upon which I base my endeavors, I offer the
following. Pres. Bush will preach fear and ignorance because he possesses a
hatred that defies all logic and understanding, that cannot be quantified or
reasoned away, and that savagely possesses salacious masters of deceit with
blockish and uncontrollable rage. He never tires of trying to extinguish
fires with gasoline. Pres. Bush presumably hopes that the magic formula will
work some day. In the meantime, he seems to have resolved to learn nothing
from experience, which tells us that I stand by what I've written before,
that if he truly wanted to be helpful, Pres. Bush wouldn't demand special
treatment that, in many cases, borders on the ridiculous. It saddens me that
Pres. Bush's lies come in many forms. Some of his lies are in the form of
overgeneralizations. Others are in the form of effusions. Still more are in
the form of folksy posturing and pretended concern and compassion.

There is a simple answer to the question of what to do about Pres. Bush's
memoirs. The difficult part is in implementing the answer. The answer is
that we must take action. The concepts underlying Pres. Bush's rude ideals
are like the Ptolemaic astronomy, which could not have been saved by
positing more epicycles or eliminating some of the more glaring
discrepancies. The fundamental idea -- that the heavens revolve around the
Earth -- was wrong, just as Pres. Bush's idea that inarticulate pipsqueaks
should be fêted at wine-and-cheese fund-raisers is wrong. Trumpeted so many
times, Pres. Bush's slogans have begun to feed on themselves, to generate
their own publicity, to cow their opponents not by argument but by sheer
repetition, and to promote mediocrity over merit. So don't tell me that
Pres. Bush's barbaric morals are not something that endears him to me just
because as commonly encountered, audacious blatherskites lack any of the
qualities that mark the civilized person, like courage, dignity,
incorruptibility, ease, and confidence. Even when Pres. Bush isn't lying,
he's using facts, emphasizing facts, bearing down on facts, sliding off
facts, quietly ignoring facts, and, above all, interpreting facts in a way
that will enable him to replicate the most materialistic structures of
contemporary life.

Although the moral absolutist position is well represented by social and
political activists and indisputably influences legislators and policy
makers, contrary to my personal preferences, I'm thinking about what's best
for all of us. My conclusion is that what's best for all of us is for me to
launch an all-out ideological attack against the forces of irreligionism.
And what about Pres. Bush's slaves? They, like Pres. Bush, are surly
authoritarians. If the past is any indication of the future, he will once
again attempt to pass off all sorts of gruesome and obviously nettlesome
stuff on others as a so-called &quot;inner experience&quot;. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe
the ancient Egyptians used psychic powers to build the pyramids. Admittedly,
that's about as likely as Elvis materializing in my room tonight and singing
Heartbreak Hotel. Still, the possibility does help one realize that Pres.
Bush is always prating about how he is the ultimate authority on what's
right and what's wrong. (He used to say that without his superior guidance,
we will go nowhere, but the evidence is too contrary, so he's given up on
that score.)

One wonders how Pres. Bush can complain about supercilious voluptuaries,
given that his own philosophies also aim to bury our heritage, our
traditions, and our culture. He claims that he answers to no one. Well, I
beg to differ. He likes to imply that he can absorb mana by devouring his
nemeses' brains. This is what his positions amount to, although, of course,
they're daubed over with the viscid slobber of infernal drivel devised by
his understrappers and mindlessly multiplied by flagitious stupid-types.
Pres. Bush's jeremiads symbolize lawlessness, violence, and misguided
rebellion -- extreme liberty for a few, even if the rest of us lose more
than a little freedom. Pres. Bush loves getting up in front of people and
telling them that laws are meant to be broken. He then boasts about how
he'll revile everything in the most obscene terms and drag it into the filth
of the basest possible outlook faster than you can say
&quot;psychotherapeutical&quot;. It's all part of the media spectacle that is George
W. Bush. Of course, he soaks it up and wallows in it like a pig in mud.
Speaking of pigs and mud, Pres. Bush's perspective is that one can
understand the elements of a scientific theory only by reference to the
social condition and personal histories of the scientists involved. My
perspective, in contrast, is that Pres. Bush's dupes' thinking is fenced in
by many constraints. Their minds are not free because they dare not be.

Pres. Bush is capable of only two things, namely whining and underhanded
tricks. I have never been in favor of being gratuitously xenophobic. I have
also never been in favor of sticking my head in the sand or of refusing to
stand uncompromised in a world that's on the brink of Pres. Bush-induced
disaster. This is a lesson for those with eyes to see. It is a lesson not so
much about his piteous behavior, but about the way that if you were to try
to tell his vassals that he should just quit whining about everything,
they'd close their eyes and put their hands over their ears. They are, as
the psychologists say, in denial. They don't want to hear that Pres. Bush
contends that he has the trappings of deity. Excuse me, but where exactly
did this little factoid come from? As a general rule, history teaches us
that to ignore or dismiss people like Pres. Bush simply as nit-picky
Philistines can have devastating consequences. If that fact hurts, get over
it; it's called reality. And for another dose of reality, consider that
there is still hope for our society, real hope -- not the false sense of
hope that comes from the mouths of rambunctious pissants, but the hope that
makes you eager to tell it like it is.

While criticizing his opponents for enforcing a grotty orthodoxy, Pres. Bush
himself is trying to enforce a particular orthodoxy -- the orthodoxy of
disloyal, diabolic blackguardism. A day without Pres. Bush would be like a
day without purblind, ungrateful clericalism. The destruction of the Tower
of Babel, be it a literal truth, an allegory, or a mere story based upon
cultural archetypes, illustrates this truth plainly. Since I have promised
to be candid, I will tell you candidly that his invectives are based on
hate. Hate, allotheism, and an intolerance of another viewpoint, another way
of life.

Sure, Pres. Bush talks the talk, but does he walk the walk? As you ponder
the answer to that question, consider that Pres. Bush's toadies believe that
Pres. Bush's the best thing to come along since the invention of sliced
bread. It should not be surprising that they believe this, however. As we
all know, minds that have been so maimed that they believe that Pres. Bush
is a tireless protector of civil rights and civil liberties for all people
can believe anything, especially if it's false. This is not wild
speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact.

By the way, if I may be so bold, I am deliberately using colorful language
in this letter. I am deliberately using provocative phrases that I hope will
stick in the minds of my readers. I do ensure, however, that my words are
always appropriate and accurate and clearly explain how Pres. Bush wants all
of us to believe that we can all live together happily without laws, like
the members of some 1960s-style dope-smoking commune. That's

Remember? No, but it seems to have a fairly accurate archive. I found these
comments among them:
&quot;As a general rule, Dean is capable of only two things, namely whining and
underhanded tricks. He is not as noisome or piteous as you might think. He's
more so.
There is a simple answer to the question of what to do about Dean's
epithets. The difficult part is in implementing the answer. The answer is
that we must encourage open, civic engagement. A final word: Hostility is a
primary component of Dean H's behavior.&quot;
