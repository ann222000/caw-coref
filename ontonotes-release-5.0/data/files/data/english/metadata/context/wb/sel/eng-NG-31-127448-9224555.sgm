It seems to me that Mr. Wallace is missing Mr Steiger's point.  Mr
Steiger seems to be saying that the second law of thermodynamics does
not mean that things cannot become spontaneously ordered, and that
entropy is something else than that.  Mr. Wallace objects &quot;But this
order isn't decreasing entropy!&quot; which was Mr. Steiger's point.

As nearly as I can tell, they both are saying that entropy isn't
actually a measure of order in the way that lay people assume it to be.

It depends on what system you are asking about the entropy and/or
entropy of.  The process of spontaneous crystalization generates
heat.  If the heat stays in the system (raising the temperature) then
the decreased entropy of the crystal arrangement (compared to solution)
is more than compensated by the increased entropy entailed by the
higher temperature.  Energy, of course, remains constant.

But if the heat is allowed to flow away (into a heat bath that is not
considered part of the 'system', for example), then the entropy of
the (closed, but not isolated 'system) decreases and so does its
entropy.

Not directly.  But there may well be 'extensions' or 'generalizations'
of the 2nd law that do say something useful about those things.
Trouble is, no one (AFAIK) has yet provided the careful definitions
and distinctions that would make such a generalized 2LoT work.

The confusion comes from a failure by creationists to differentiate between
two definitions of the word &quot;entropy&quot;

In thermodynamics, entropy refers to the amount of energy in a system which
has become unavailable to do work.  Basically, some energy is always lost
to such inefficiencies as heat and noise and if you want the system to
continue to be able to do the same amount of work, you have to keep putting
new energy in.  In the absence of an energy source, entropy will either
stay the same or increase until all the energy in the system is unavailable
for work.  This is the form of entropy the second law of thermodynamics
refers to.  See here for an intro to the topic:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy

In information theory, entropy refers to the degree to which a message has
deviated from the original after having been copied/transmitted.  It is
commonly considered to be a measure of how much information a message has
lost, but &quot;information&quot; refers solely to the *intended* message.  Depending
on what kind of change has occurred in the message, it may still contain
the same *amount* of information in the conventional sense, but still
deviate significantly from the intended message, thus having lost a lot of
information in the information theory sense.  For example, &quot;My favourite
insect is my pet red bug.&quot; -&gt; &quot;My favourite insect is my pet bed bug.&quot;  A
single change in one letter changes the message fairly significantly, but
both sentences convey the same amount of information about me.  According
to information theory, the second version has entropy since it has deviated
from the original message (and is wrong!) but it's still a valid sentence
of the same form and containing the same amount of information as before.

If it happens, it represents a net increase in the total entropy of
everything.  No exceptions.  That is the 2nd law in a nutshell.

When a bunch of free molecules (either liquid or gas) become arranged
in a crystaline solid, their energy almost always decreases (I can think
of no exceptions for a reversable crystalization process) because they
are more tightly bound in the solid.  This means that when they crystalize,
heat is released, usually into the surrounding environment.  In fact, in
most cases a substance will not crystalize unless it is able to shed
heat into into its surroundings, i.e., the surroundings are colder than
the freezing point of the substance.

As for your first question, the entropy of a bunch of molecules bound
in a crystal lattice is lower than the entropy those same molecules
would have bouncing around free as a liquid or gas.  So crystalization
represents a *decrease* in entropy as far as the arrangement of those
molecules are concerned.  This local decrease in entropy is only
possible because the heat released into the surroundings causes an
*increase* in the entropy of the surroundings.  When you put a bucket
of water outside on a cold day, the entropy of the water decreases as
it freezes but the entropy of the surrounding air increases as the
water loses heat into the air.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And does the 2nd law make any statement about
&gt;organization, complexity, organized complexity, etc?
">

Not really.  The second law simply says that the entropy of everything
increases; there is no process for which the total net change in entropy
of everything is negative.

Here is where &quot;organization&quot; comes into it:  Consider a box with a dividing
line down the middle.  To have one half of the box contain nitrogen
and the other half oxygen is highly unlikely.  You could create this
situation briefly by inserting a divider, filling each half of the
box with a different gas, then removing the divider.  Very soon,
though, the box will be filled with a uniform distribution of gas.
You will never see the reverse happen, a box filled with mixed gas
spontaneously separate into half oxygen and half nitrogen.  One way
to think of it is this:  Each molecule could be anywhere in the box.
It has a fifty percent chance of being in either half of the box.
This is true of *each* of the billions and billions of molecules
involved.  So, consider all the possible arrangements of the entire
collection of molecules, at least as far as which half of the box
each molecule is in.  The number of arrangements is huge--2^(billions
and billions)--and almost all of those arrangements look like a uniform
mixture of oxygen and nitrogen in both halves of the box.  In fact,
only *two* of the 2^(billions and billions) of arrangements have all
of the nitrogen on one side and all of the oxygen on the other.  It
makes sense that if the box starts in one of those two states, and the
molecules are allowed to move randomly, the box will soon look like
a uniform, random distribution because that is what most of the states
the box could be in look like.  It turns out that entropy is closely
linked to the number of states that match a certain criteria; the
entropy of the uniformly mixed situation is higher than the entropy
of the half oxygen/half nitrogen situation because most of the possible
states are uniformly mixed.  This can easily be described mathematically.
For simple systems like this, the unlikely arrangements can be though
of as &quot;more ordered&quot;, and thus the whole idea of associating an increase
in entropy with a decrease in order.

Have I confused you completely?

When it comes to plants and eggs and chicks, it is much more difficult
to come up with a mathematical equation of number of states or entropy.
I think it would be safe to say that a flowering plant has lower entropy
than the air, water, and minerals that went into growing it.  It is only
possible for the plant to grow if there is an outside source of energy--
the sun.  The entropy of the sun is always increasing, more than making
up for any sunlight-driven decreases in entropy that might be happening
on Earth.  Comparing chicks to chickens, on the other hand...I would say
that the entropy of a chick, a pile of feed, and an oxygen supply is
*lower* than the entropy of a grown chicken, a large quantity of scattered
chicken manure, and a bunch of CO2.  The net result of the chicken
eating, growing, and shitting (all the while inhaling and exhaling) is
an increase in entropy, or a decrease in &quot;organization&quot;, despite the
fact that the grown chicken has a higher market value.

Steiger is correct, Wallace is barking up the wrong tree.

Steiger's point is that thermodynamic entropy is not a measure of
disorder.  Wallace essentially concedes this point, but then goes on to
say that it doesn't matter because the formation snowflakes and salt
crystals are examples of 'low energy' while seeds sprouting and the
development of chicks are 'high energy', and that the crystals are
&quot;simple, uniform, repeating structures with minimal complexity, and no
function&quot;, none of which has diddly-squat to do with thermodynamic
entropy.

Steiger is the mind behind the websites secondlaw.com and 2ndlaw.com,
both of which are good (albeit brief) summaries of thermodynamics and the
second law.

The points here are:

1) Thermodynamics deals with the 'tendency' of energy (in particular
heat) to spread out.

2) Thermodynamics has nothing to do with 'Order' as most people think of
it.

3) Thermodynamics has nothing to do with 'Information'.  The unfortunate
common name 'entropy' used in both thermodynamics and Shannon's
information theory have nothing to do with each other.

4) Thermodynamics does nothing to prevent 'order arising from disorder'
especially at the macro level.  There are innumerable examples of this
happening all the time.

5) Thermodynamics probably played an important role in abiogenesis, as
the formation of the longer, more 'complex' molecules is likely something
that happened spontaneously (in the thermodynamic sense), but it does not
play a large role in evolution.

6) Wallace is playing fast and loose with Steiger's quote.  Steiger did
not 'equate' crystal formation with developmental biology or evolution,
he merely used them as examples to illustrate that 'order' can aries from
'disorder' despite the second law.

7) Probably the most important point: The second law does *not* prevent
'order from arising from disorder'.  The second law does not state 'Order
cannot arise from disorder' or 'systems can only move from ordered states
to disordered states'.   Those are common but incomplete interpretations
of the second law.   Completely stated, the second law says: &quot;In a closed
system, there is no spontaneous process by which heat (energy) can move
from a cold object into a hotter object.&quot;  Note that this does *not* say
that the second law only applies to closed systems, but that it leaves
the possibility of open systems (or non-isolated systems, depending on
if  you are talking to a chemist or a physicist) having processes by
which this can happen.

8) The earth is not a closed or isolated system.  We receive large
amounts of energy from a nearby fusion furnace. That energy moves through
the thermodynamic system of the earth, and drives a host of chemical
reactions which form the basis of all life here, and which handily
overcomes any hinderance that the second law might place on those
reactions.

The key to this problem, which most people do not understand, is that
there is a fundamental difference between thermodynamic entropy and
informational entropy. They aren't the same thing. The problem for the
ToE is not found in the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics, but in the problem
of producing additional meaningful or useful genetic information.

A crystal, like a snowflake, doesn't require more information than
what is contained in each individual part as it interacts with a
particular type of environment (i.e., cold weather in this case).
This is not true of biosystems which are far more informationally
complex than the sum of their parts.  The order of parts is vitally
important in biosystems in order for them to form and work properly -
not so for snowflakes.

&gt; The confusion comes from a failure by creationists to differentiate between
&gt; two definitions of the word &quot;entropy&quot;

&gt; In thermodynamics, entropy refers to the amount of energy in a system which
&gt; has become unavailable to do work.  Basically, some energy is always lost
&gt; to such inefficiencies as heat and noise and if you want the system to
&gt; continue to be able to do the same amount of work, you have to keep putting
&gt; new energy in.  In the absence of an energy source, entropy will either
&gt; stay the same or increase until all the energy in the system is unavailable
&gt; for work.  This is the form of entropy the second law of thermodynamics
&gt; refers to.  See here for an intro to the topic: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy

&gt; In information theory, entropy refers to the degree to which a message has
&gt; deviated from the original after having been copied/transmitted.  It is
&gt; commonly considered to be a measure of how much information a message has
&gt; lost, but &quot;information&quot; refers solely to the *intended* message.  Depending
&gt; on what kind of change has occurred in the message, it may still contain
&gt; the same *amount* of information in the conventional sense, but still
&gt; deviate significantly from the intended message, thus having lost a lot of
&gt; information in the information theory sense.  For example, &quot;My favourite
&gt; insect is my pet red bug.&quot; -&gt; &quot;My favourite insect is my pet bed bug.&quot;  A
&gt; single change in one letter changes the message fairly significantly, but
&gt; both sentences convey the same amount of information about me.  According
&gt; to information theory, the second version has entropy since it has deviated
&gt; from the original message (and is wrong!) but it's still a valid sentence
&gt; of the same form and containing the same amount of information as before.

First, as somebody down-thread has already said: If it happens,
it represents a non-decrease in the total entropy of the universe.
So, when a crystal forms it does not decrease total entropy.

It *might* be a decrease in entropy of the material that gets
formed into the crystal. Maybe. But a crystal forms out of
some set of molecules that are not a crystal. For example,
out of a solution of the material of the crystal (salt in water
as an example). Or out of a molten substance that is cooling
(iron crystals forming in cooling molten iron for example).
The total system is going to be increasing total entropy.
If it were not, the process would not happen.

Entropy is not identical to disorder. Entropy can be related to
information, though it's a buttload of work to do it. It's yet
another buttload of work to make it understandable in
anything other than as abstract differential equations.

But the point for evolution is this: The 2nd law does not
give us anything particularly useful. The 2nd law says
that a bunch of stuff has to be true under certain
conditions. No place in there does it say that a
living thing, or an intelligent thing, can disobey such.

Any thing that is regularly observed to occur cannot
be violating a law of physics.

So, any process that happens obeys the 2nd law.
Being alive is not a loophole. So when those who
deny evolution hold up the 2nd law, they are wrong.
Cows can turn completely dead stuff (the grass they
eat gets completely digested and broken down into
sugars and amino acids before it is absorbed) into
new baby calves. They make brand new DNA of a
type that has never existed before, every single time
they have a calf. (At least through the ordinary methods
of sex and so on. If it's a clone the DNA is a copy.)

If turning grass into a cow were a violation of the
2nd law, then it would be a violation for a cow to
do it every bit as much as for evolution to do it.
Since cows (and people, and lots of other living
things) do such a thing on a regular frequent basis,
doing such clearly does not violate the 2nd law.

I guess there's always quibble room in thermodynamics.  I would say that
the above is correct for a system where &quot;outside&quot; is defined as external
to the system, i.e., in the surroundings of the system.  In other words,
you are describing an open system.  I am not a chemist or a physicist, so

[Warning: Sweeping generalizations ahead]

Physicists tend to view the systems in terms of energy. Open = can
exchange energy with the surroundings, Closed = cannot exchange energy
with the surroundings.

Chemists tend to make a further distinction. A closed system is a system
that can exchange heat (or other energy) with the surroundings but is
otherwise separated (i.e., cannot exchange the chemical contents with the
surroundings) whereas an &quot;isolated&quot; system cannot exchange heat energy or
the contents with the surroundings.

see http://staff.um.edu.mt/jgri1/teaching/che2372/notes/01/01_index.html

In other words, to a chemist a &quot;closed&quot; system is what a physicist would
call an &quot;open&quot; system, and an &quot;isolated&quot; system is what a physicist would
call &quot;closed&quot;.

There is no need to break your head about probabilities.
(and their incorrect interpretation)
Plain thermodynamics will do.

dS = dQ/T

Since heat is given off in crystalization
the entropy of an ice crystal is lower
than that of the same amount of water
at the same temperature.

Hence crystalization lowers the entropy spontanously,
provided you can let the heat given off
go somewhere else.
(with an equal or greater entropy increase elsewhere,
of course)

The ice crystal -is- more ordered (in the sense of lower entropy)
than liquid water, and that order does arise spontanously.
(when you allow for a greater or at best equal
entropy increase elsewhere)

Water will not crystalize spontaneously without heat removal,

True enough.  However, this doesn't address crystallization of ions
from supersaturated solutions.  In that case the crystals still lower
their entropy, but at the expense of the entropy of the complete
solution.
And to reiterate what's been said before in this thread, entropy is
not equivalent to complexity.  Complexity is not under the constraint
of any thermodynamics.  And the 2nd law of thermo is actually a
statistical &quot;rule of thumb&quot; anyway, that holds true simply because the
number of molecules involved is huge.

I would say almost always.  The only possible exception that I could

Crystals use the same basic structure over and over, so a lot of

what nonsense. idiocy...

thermodynamics deals with the transfer of energy. heat is a form of
energy

to create a crystal you have to COOL the material so the
intermolecular or atomic forces can dominate the thermal ones. this
allows the molecules to attract each other.

the COOLING can be analyzed by thermodynamics. so, YES, this is
thermodynamics at work. a LOCAL decrease in entropy can occur even
though the TOTAL entropy increases..

What do you think &quot;natural selection&quot; selects if not improved function
with regard to reproductive fitness or advantage?  And, how do you
think this advantage is gained via random mutations?  If the mutations
do not produce some sort of detectable change in *function* (i.e., if
the changes are neutral with respect to function), they will not be
detectable by the guiding force of natural selection.  In short,
neutral changes are not &quot;meaningful&quot; to nature.  Nature is therefore
&quot;blind&quot; to such changes and cannot guide them in a positive manner
toward improved reproductive fitness.  All that is left at this point
is purely blind random walk and/or selection.

That produces at least a potential problem for the ToE since evolution
is not supposed to be a random process.  Without the guiding light of
natural selection in play, evolutionary processes are at a significant
disadvantage.  Basically then, for the ToE to remain viable, one must
be able to show that these neutral/non-beneficial gaps are not
significant - which is more and more difficult to do at higher and
higher levels of minimum sequence and/or structural requirements for
beneficial biosystems.

Consider a few of the following thoughts from Michel Baranger, a
physicist from Cambridge University, which may help to clarify this
concept:

&quot;The constituents of a complex system are interdependent. . .
Consider first a non-complex system with many constituents - say a gas
in a container. Take away 10% of its constituents, which are its
molecules. What happens? Nothing very dramatic! The pressure changes a
little, or the volume, or the temperature; or all of them. But on the
whole, the final gas looks and behaves much like the original gas. Now
do the same experiment with a complex system. Take a human body and

When you look at an elementary mathematical fractal, it may
seem to you very 'complex', but this is not the same meaning of
complex as when saying 'complex systems'. The simple fractal is
chaotic, it is not complex.  Another example would be the simple gas
mentioned earlier: it is highly chaotic, but it is not complex in the
present sense.&quot;

http://www.detectingdesign.com/PDF%20Files/Entropy,%20Chaos,%20and%20...

A snowflake is a fractal structure.  It is not very informationally
&quot;complex&quot;. It is informationally simple in that it requires very low
specificity of part arrangement to achieve its fractal-type shape/
structure.  This is not true for biosystems.  Even a simple single-
protein enzyme, like lactase, is much more informationally complex
than a snowflake of the same size in that its particular function
requires a much more specific arrangement of the molecular building
blocks in its structure relative to each other. A snowflake's
molecules can be interchanged randomly without any change in the
ability of the molecules to self-assemble essentially the same
structure in the same environment; yet with a very different
arrangement of the individual molecular parts in the overall
structure.

This is why a protein-based system cannot self-assemble itself.  It
has to be built based upon pre-existing coded information stored in
the form of specifically sequenced DNA. This pre-existing information
must be decoded and used to build to specific sequence required by the
protein-based system in order for it to be able to work at all to
perform its specific task (like the lactase function).

The degree of constraint that a functional protein-based system can
tolerate, with regard to minimum size and sequence specificity
requirements before it completely looses a particular function, is the
measure of its &quot;informational complexity&quot;.

What do you think &quot;natural selection&quot; selects if not improved function
with regard to reproductive fitness or advantage?  And, how do you
think this advantage is gained via random mutations?  If the mutations
do not produce some sort of detectable change in *function* (i.e., if
the changes are neutral with respect to function), they will not be
detectable by the guiding force of natural selection.  In short,
neutral changes are not &quot;meaningful&quot; to nature.  Nature is therefore
&quot;blind&quot; to such changes and cannot guide them in a positive manner
toward improved reproductive fitness.  All that is left at this point
is purely blind random walk and/or selection.

That produces at least a potential problem for the ToE since evolution
is not supposed to be a random process.  Without the guiding light of
natural selection in play, evolutionary processes are at a significant
disadvantage.  Basically then, for the ToE to remain viable, one must
be able to show that these neutral/non-beneficial gaps are not
significant - which is more and more difficult to do at higher and
higher levels of minimum sequence and/or structural requirements for
beneficial biosystems.

Consider a few of the following thoughts from Michel Baranger, a
physicist from Cambridge University, which may help to clarify this
concept:

&quot;The constituents of a complex system are interdependent. . .
Consider first a non-complex system with many constituents - say a gas
in a container. Take away 10% of its constituents, which are its
molecules. What happens? Nothing very dramatic! The pressure changes a
little, or the volume, or the temperature; or all of them. But on the
whole, the final gas looks and behaves much like the original gas. Now
do the same experiment with a complex system. Take a human body and
take away 10%: let's just cut off a leg! The result will be rather
more spectacular than for the gas. I leave the scenario up to you. And
yet, it's not even the head that I proposed to cut off. . .

Nope - - It is just that a biosystem requires more pre-existing coded

cannot arrange themselves into their functional structures without
this pre-coded information.  They must be arranged by pre-existing
machines that force them with very directed energy into their proper

Production of a snowflake, on the other hand, requires no more pre-

&gt; The confusion comes from a failure by creationists to differentiate
&gt; between
&gt; two definitions of the word &quot;entropy&quot;

&gt; In thermodynamics, entropy refers to the amount of energy in a system
&gt; which
&gt; has become unavailable to do work.  Basically, some energy is always lost
&gt; to such inefficiencies as heat and noise and if you want the system to
&gt; continue to be able to do the same amount of work, you have to keep
&gt; putting
&gt; new energy in.  In the absence of an energy source, entropy will either
&gt; stay the same or increase until all the energy in the system is
&gt; unavailable
&gt; for work.  This is the form of entropy the second law of thermodynamics
&gt; refers to.  See here for an intro to the topic:
&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy

&gt; In information theory, entropy refers to the degree to which a message has
&gt; deviated from the original after having been copied/transmitted.  It is
&gt; commonly considered to be a measure of how much information a message has
&gt; lost, but &quot;information&quot; refers solely to the *intended* message.
&gt; Depending
&gt; on what kind of change has occurred in the message, it may still contain
&gt; the same *amount* of information in the conventional sense, but still
&gt; deviate significantly from the intended message, thus having lost a lot of
&gt; information in the information theory sense.  For example, &quot;My favourite
&gt; insect is my pet red bug.&quot; -&gt; &quot;My favourite insect is my pet bed bug.&quot;  A
&gt; single change in one letter changes the message fairly significantly, but
&gt; both sentences convey the same amount of information about me.  According
&gt; to information theory, the second version has entropy since it has
&gt; deviated
&gt; from the original message (and is wrong!) but it's still a valid sentence
&gt; of the same form and containing the same amount of information as before.
&gt; See here for an introduction:
&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_entropy
">

No, that is not the meaning of entropy in Information Theory. Entropy (sensu
Shannon) is a measure of the ensemble of messages that might be sent, not a
measure of the message that is actually sent, no matter how much it deviated
from the original. It describes how much uncertainty a receiver has about an
information source.

The second law goes much deeper that that. Unless you are dealing with
a frictionless
engine operating with surroundings at absolute zero, there will always
be some energy
unavailable for work.

Friction and other forms of dissipation further reduce the fficiency
of said enegine.
However, the SLOT tells us that even in the absence of dissipation you
cannot get
100% efficiency.

Hence, not only there is no free lunch (first law), you can't get it
wholesale (2nd law)
and worse, you must pay tax (3rd law).

As I mentioned in my first post to this thread, the 2nd Law of

with the ToE is that the proposed mechism violates the concept of
*informational* entropy.  Again, informational entropy is not the same
thing as thermodynamic entropy.  They are somewhat related but
distinctly different concepts.

In short, you can't put significantly more information into a system
than is already there.  In fact, the information that is already there
tends to get corrupted and lost over time (hence the term
informational &quot;entropy&quot;).  The only way to add information to a system
is from an outside source of greater information.

At this point, some might posit Nature as an outside source of higher
information.  The problem with this notion is that the forces
generally proposed as beign used by nature are mindless, non-
deliberate, and have no goal.  Such forces do not bring the quality of
higher-level information to the table that is needed to improve the
information content of a system - to include all mechanical systems be
they made of biological or non-biological building blocks (computers
or amoebas).  It makes no differnece.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I know I'm going to regret this, but can I ask you how do you measure
&gt; &gt; &gt; the amount of information contained in a crystal?

&gt; &gt; Information content is defined as the shortest possible description of
&gt; &gt; the string/object/entity/whatever, right?

&gt; That's the idea of Algorithmic Information, but there are a lot of
&gt; mathematical complications.

&gt; &gt; Crystals use the same basic structure over and over, so a lot of
&gt; &gt; information can be saved compared to random arrangement by describing
&gt; &gt; the structure of a unit cell of the crystal then repeating that over
&gt; &gt; and over.

&gt; Thus hot air trapped in a balloon has lots of information, since there
&gt; is no short description of its configuration?
">

You are confusing concepts of algorithmic information and meaningful
information.  They aren't the same thing.

For example, a random series of letters, the size of a Shakespearean
play, has the maximum amount of algorithmic information (from the
perspective of a given UTM) - much more than Shakespeare's play.  Yet,
Shakespeare's play has much more &quot;meaning&quot; or &quot;function&quot; than does the
random sequence of letters of the same size.

In short, algorithmic information is a measure of randomness or
chaos.  This isn't the same thing as measuring degrees of function or
meaning.  Obviously, maximum randomness or chaos is not equivalent to
maximum function/meaning.

All is not lost though.  The concepts of algorithmic information/
entropy can be used to identify deliberate artifact for many types of
physical phenomena.  But, one must have some previous experience/
knowledge with the material in question as it interacts with a variety
of natural forces before one can adequately detect or propose the
workings of deliberate artifact acting with the material in question
(i.e., water in the case of snowflakes).  After some investigation,
the very low degree of algorithmic entropy exhibited by a single
snowflake (i.e., very high symmetry of opposing irregularities) can be
explained by purely natural non-deliberate non-artifactual
processes.   Yet, the same could not be said if the same shape/
structure were produced in a different material, like granite.  The
very same structure produced in the material of granite would be very
clear evidence of artifact - i.e., deliberate design.   Why? Because a
little history or knowledge about granite allows one to know that
granite does not interact with any non-deliberate force of nature in
such a way that would produce anything close to the level of symmetry
(with regard to surface irregularities) expressed by a snowflake.  In
other words, non-deliberate forces of nature tend very strongly to
produce features on granite that have much high higher degrees of
algorithmic entropy as compared with the features of a snowflake.

Like your erroneous notion that the past history of a string cannot be

your related notion that because all patterns could be the result of

You need to work on your concept of what it means to accept or reject

Shannon entropy doesn't have quite the same definition as algorithmic
