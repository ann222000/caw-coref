23. Why is quitting smoking so difficult?

You have probably quit smoking (or using tobacco in another form) before,
and you have probably gone back to the habit. Whether your &quot;smobriety&quot; (to
use a term from the addiction recovery program Nicotine Anonymous) lasted an
hour or a year, you no doubt learned a basic truth: breaking away from
tobacco products can be, at best, unpleasant, and at worst, a living hell.
And the memory of that unpleasant experience may have left you with a fear
of trying again.

Understanding the source of your physical and emotion reactions can help get
you through those difficult early days. Quitting smoking will be one of the
hardest things that you will ever do. This is because smoking is actually a
three-fold problem: you have developed psychological, social, and physical
needs for the drug nicotine.

As a smoker, all your emotions were medicated with a nicotine packed
cigarette: you relaxed with nicotine; you laughed with nicotine, wept with
nicotine, digested with nicotine. You used smoking to pass the time, ready
yourself for a crisis, calm yourself after one, even (ironically) to catch
your breath during a difficult task. You began your day by dosing with
nicotine, your drug of choice (perhaps one among others), and ended it the
same way. No wonder that, suddenly deprived of all that, your mind and body
go wonky for a little while.

Nicotine attaches itself to you physically. From the American Heart
Association:

Nicotine Addiction

When a person smokes a cigarette, the body responds immediately to
thechemical nicotine in the smoke. Nicotine causes a short-term increase in
blood pressure, heart rate, and the flow of blood from the heart. It also
causes the arteries to narrow. Carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen
the blood can carry. This, combined with the effects produced by nicotine,
creates an imbalance in the demand for oxygen by the cells and the amount of
oxygen the blood is able to supply. Smoking further increases the amount of
fatty acids, glucose, and various hormones in the blood. There are several
ways that cigarette smoking may increase the risk of developing hardening of
the arteries and heart attacks.
First, carbon monoxide may damage the inner walls of the arteries that
encourages the buildup of fat on these walls. Over time, this causes the
vessels to narrow and harden.

Nicotine may also contribute to this process. Smoking also causes several
changes in the blood. They include increased adhesiveness and clustering of
platelets in the blood, shortened platelet survival, decreased clotting
time, and increased thickness of the blood. These effects can lead to a
heart attack.

The 1988 Surgeon General's Report, 'Nicotine Addiction,' concluded that:

* Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting.
* Nicotine is the drug that causes addiction.
* Pharmacologic and behavioral characteristics that determine
tobacco addiction are similar to those  that determine addiction to drugs
such as heroin and cocaine.

For additional information on this subject, contact your local American
Heart Association office or call 1-800-242-8721.

The social attraction of smoking is perhaps the most insidious prong of the
nicotine addiction. Until recently, even after the dangers of smoking were
well known, smoking was widely seen as essentially harmless; though this
opinion is now held by fewer people (and I'll wager that most of them are
still smoking), it has not disappeared. We still often hear smoking defended
with the argument that the sale, purchase, promotion and use of tobacco
products are legal activities nearly everywhere in the world.

While true, this statement obscures the question of the safety of smoking
and fails to raise other explanations for its legitimate status, such as the
financial contribution which the tobacco industry makes to the world
economy.

And, greater public awareness of the harm that smoking does has not greatly
altered its image as sexy, cool, adult, fashionable. Books such as
Christopher Buckley's Thank You For Smoking and movies like Reality Bites
(where the sole non-smoker is Ben Stiller's dorky outsider character)
override those public service announcements and notices on
the sides of cigarette packages in the minds of the tobacco industry's most
important consumers: adolescents and teens. (Incidentally, we have it from a
very reliable source that the people who make a certain brand of popular
cigarettes featuring a certain dromedary on the package paid for the actors
in Reality Bites to smoke their cigarettes. And for more
proof of this common industry practice, here's an interesting letter
http://tinyurl.com/yup3u ( from one of America's top action stars.)  Give it
a minute's thought: do you really like smoking, or do you just like your
smoker image and the props associated with it (the cigarette, the nifty
smoke rings, the ash; the holes in your clothing, yellow stains on your
teeth, nasty taste on your breath)?

The minute you quit smoking your life changes drastically. Your identity as
a smoker is gone; the crutch which helped you handle situations is kicked
out from under you; your body and mind begin to play quite clever tricks on
you to get their drug. All these changes can be nearly overwhelming, but the
important thing to remember is that things will
get better as you learn new and better ways to live your life. And everyone
can learn; a few hundred of us at AS3 alone will testify to that!

(Paraphrased from 'The Cigarette Papers' by Dr. Stanton Glantz)

According to researchers, nicotine stimulates the Hypothalmus to produce
the same chemicals it does in stressful situations: corticosteroids.  This
makes one feel less anxious, and yet possibly more focused.  Add nicotine to
a stressful stiatuion, and you get more than a regular dose.

Over time (and number of cigarettes), the hypothalmus adjusts.  Now,
&quot;without&quot; a cigarette, you're getting less than average corticosteroids, but
smoking brings you back up to a normal level, maybe not even surpassing what
a non-smoker gets, but compared to a lowered baseline it feels good.

After quitting, over time the hypothalmus adjusts back.  The research
doesn't say how fast. (AS3 may be able to add some estimates to that).

24. I smoke lights. Aren't they safer?

(Excerpted from New York Times News Service, May 2, 1994)

Quote:
WASHINGTON--Smokers of cigarettes low in tar and nicotine may be getting
more of those substances than they think, Federal Trade Commission officials
and experts on smoking say. ...

National polls conducted by the Gallup organization have found that
smokers believe that cigarettes labelled &quot;light&quot; are less hazardous and will
deliver less tar and nicotine. But evidence has accumulated that the
measurements, which are carried out by tobacco company laboratories under
the supervision of the FTC, bear little or no relation to how much nicotine
and tar smokers actually get from smoking.

&quot;The commission has been aware for a while that the test has problems
regarding the actual intake that consumers will get,&quot; Judith D. Wilkenfeld,
assistant director in the FTC's Division of Advertising Practices, said in a
telephone interview.

The FTC cigarette tests are carried out by machines that hold the
cigarette and draw air through them in 2-second puffs once every minute
until the cigarette is burned down to the filter.

But cigarettes now include several features that make the machine tests
meaningless, according to Dr. Jack Henningfield, chief of clinical
pharmacology research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

For example, a majority of cigarettes now have tiny, nearly invisible
hole in their filter paper or in the cigarette paper near the filter. When
the smoking machine draws on a cigarette, a large amount of air is drawn in,
and this dilutes the smoke getting to the measuring device, making today's
cigarettes appear to contain less tar and nicotine.

But smokers do not handle the cigarettes the same way machines do.
They find the diluted smoke milder, and to make up for the &quot;lighter&quot; taste,
or less satisfying amount of nicotine, they puff more or draw deeper,
pulling in more total smoke, so that the result is the same amount, or more,
of nicotine and tar.

In addition, the tiny filtration holes are often blocked by smokers
with their lips or hands, thus cutting off the air that would have diluted
the smoke....

Scientific studies over recent years have shown that smokers get about
the same amount of nicotine and tar no matter what kind of cigarette they
use.

25. Are cigars any better?

Quote:
Cigar consumption is climbing rapidly in the United States, where people
smoked 3 billion cigars last year, compared to 2.1 billion in 1993. Around
the world, cigar makers are especially trying to target women by promoting
their wares as a sign of affluence and sophistication. There are cigar
magazines, cigar bars, and even instructional cigar dinners.

Donald Shopland, coordinator of the smoking and tobacco control program at
the National Cancer Institute, calls the increase in cigar consumption
&quot;astounding&quot; - particularly since it has been in decline for many decades.
Alarmed, the institute plans to issue a report on safety, chemical
composition, advertising, health policies, and other cigar issues in the
fall.

I'm not impressed by the sophistication of rolled brown tobacco leaves lit
