Am I becoming a faster reader or have the amount of
posts and traffic gone done over the last couple of
months?

Is this a sign we are getting TOO BUSY for emails?  or
we don't have much to talk about?

I am interested to connect with people who have worked
productively with large scale conflicts like Israel,
Palestine, wondering what the spectrum of workable
approaches and complementary work includes . . .

Interesting reply.  What caused you to take that step?
What did you see going on that you responded to??

I only just skimmed the website, appreciated your

Here are the average number of posts per day since 1996.
I think it would be fair to say that traffic has decreased.

1996    6.3
1997    5.0
1998    6.8
1999    7.7
2000    6.1
2001    5.7
2002    8.3
2003    7.5
2004    5.3
2005    4.4
2006    4.3
2007    2.9

Oddly, the number of subscribers is at an all-time high -- 990!
Here are the average number of subscribers by year.

1996    483
1997    607
1998    826
1999    897
2000    862
2001    895
2002    905
2003    879
2004    827
2005    805
2006    859
2007    962

We had a discussion on this topic in August 2005 with the subject
heading &quot;793 subscribers time to move?&quot; (and a few other subject
headings, each starting with &quot;793&quot;)

Dear Jim, reader(s),

Part of the dynamics of change, i'd say. About 15 years ago i met a - very good - sales manager, as e-mail started as the new gadget (we even had a course in how to create and distribute e-mail). He said, &quot;well 20 years ago, i used to reply to every letter. Then there came so many letters; i couldn't cope and noticed it was no problem not to answer every letter. Then came the fax-machine and i used to reply to every fax. I started to stop answering all the many faxes. Nothing happened. Now we have e-mail, and i suppose in a couple of years, I won't be answering them too.&quot;

The same is true for chats, blogs, skype, youtube and what ever comes next. It is just Parkinson's first law: 'work fill the time available for its completion'.

Regards,

Jan Lelie

PS: i'm currently doing research in the ways meaning emerges in communities. That also takes up a lot of time.

Maybe the group could benefit from moving to a platform where we could
develop more of a community, not just e-mail messages between people who
are just names. I think any of the large online communities like
www.xing.com , www.linkedin.com , www.ecademy.com would work well, or
simply Google Groups which now includes a wiki with each group. If
nothing else, a wiki with useful links and documents would be nice. We
could also meet in Second Life from time to time, in particular now as
SL has got VoIP (like Skype). I am having some interesting meeting room
facilities put into my SL office and will invite you all for a workshop
once it is completed, just get your avatar ready, www.secondlife.com ;-)

Hello Elling,

Re Second Life, you sound like a supporter of it. What do you like about it?

I recently read a very negative piece on it.

http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-08/ff_sheep?currentPage=1

What are the possibilities for facilitation?

Regards,

Terry

Hello to All,

Perhaps postings are down due to economic issues.  I don't know about you
all, but I need to work.  The price of travel is up, and expense accounts
are dwindling.  I just don't have time to read all the posts--let alone
reply--especially when I've been out of the office for a few days.  I need
to spend as much time as I can making business contacts.

Also, (I've been on the site for a little over a year) I notice that
sometimes topics are very similar to discussions that I read just a month
(or sometimes even a few weeks) before.  I suppose that this is because of
new folks signing up all the time.

In regard to venues like Second Life--I spend enough time on the computer
now, I don't know about something like that for me.  I'm beginning to
revert--using the telephone and face-to-face convesations.  It does wonders
for business too!

Hello Elling,

Re Second Life, you sound like a supporter of it. What do you like about
it?

I recently read a very negative piece on it.

http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-08/ff_sheep?currentPage=1

What are the possibilities for facilitation?

Regards,

Terry

Amen to this, at least in terms of my own (and many of my
associates') feelings about technology). I know a number of people,
who could be classified as early adopters of computers and internet
stuff, who have basically had enough, and choosing to do what Margie
is doing. Even friends have moved back to telephone and face-to-face,
although perhaps this has something to do with age, since we all tend
to be firmly middled.

I wonder whether this has any implications for online faciitation.

I know that for me, you couldn't get me to participate in online
seminars, facilitations, etc as a participant even if you paid me to
do it.

Are any of you who do online work seeing any trend with this
particularly among people who aren't techno-phobic but are simply
sick of sitting a computers?

As for &quot;second life&quot;, my first priority is to &quot;get a first life&quot;, or
retrive it from the bowels of my computers!

Dear friends,

I've participated in the on-line facilitating course by Zenergy and
there i made these remarks regarding 2nd life.

I've been discussing this topic with a friend/facilitator extensively.
He has his practice partly on second life (he supports people who have a
SL addiction; you need to have had an addiction to be able to do this).
We concluded:

- this is not a game (with only one rule: 'this is a game' ;-)).

- it is not very popular with the youth, young people (which is remarkable).

- this type adds something new to search applications (like Google): you
can see who is looking at the data too.

- this type of applications (Role Based Iterface) is a new type of
interface, as was the browser, the icons of the Apple and the line-based
interface of the mainframe. It emerges now, because it requires a 'thick
client' (read PC) and a fast network to be acceptable.

- it proves something we already 'knew' but didn't 'realize': reality is
(also) an illusion. It doens't imply that the universe doesn't exist. It
implies that you (that is, the combination of your body and brain)
create (and even: had to learn how to create it) in your head an image,
a symbolic, meaningful world and project this image on the 'real' world.
The projections are refined through interactions. Interaction is all
there is.

- what 'happens' with 'you' in 2nd life is that you actively engage your
projections, your symbolic being. 'You' are interacting with your
'personality' and - ultimately - with your 'Self' in 1st life. 2nd Life
enables you to experiment with your personality, your dreams, fantasies,
not unlike other role playing games. But this is not a game.

- based on Jungian psychology i think that the computer screen 'acts' as
a mirror. A mirror reflects your image and - archetypically - also your
soul. When you look into a mirror, you also become aware of your
subconscious. (The funny thing is, water also can be a mirror and water
also stands for the subconscious). Based on the level of your personal
development (individuation), you will also see 'your personality', 'your
shadow',  'your anima or animus' and 'your Self'. For instance, when
you're having narcisistic phase, you'll want to know how 'beautiful' you
are, like the stephmother of Snowwhite (and remember: a mirror can not
lie!).  In fact - this has been described in a Japansese study on the
Noh-theater (these actors wear expressionlessmasks and prepare
themselves in front of mirrors), horizontally you percieve the'physical'
or  'ethical' world and vertically, you'll perceive the 'spiritual' or
'esthetical world'.

- the PC enables us to have - warning, pun ahead - Windows on our mind.
Being Jungian by nature, i couldn't help noticing that this is an
explanation of the name 'Windows' and why the logo contains the four
colors, red, green, yellow and blue.  Now, 2nd life has taken this
window a step further. Not only can you perceive the information you're
looking for (remember, a mirror informs you too), you're also able to
look at how you - and others - are looking, framing that information.
You're able to experiment with different attitudes, personalities, avatars.

- why is it also disturbing? I think that it hints at the parts of your
personality that haven't yet been integrated into your Self. You feel
resistance when you're confronted with something you have to deal with,
learn, integrate. Not dealing with this might be much more easier, but
it will come back again and again. But this can also trap you into
addiction. Like alcohol or drugs: you do not have to 'realize'.

- 2nl life is a symbolic world. Not unlike the world in your (and mine)
head. Recently i learned that the word symbol comes from a splitted
coin. A Greek coin - called 'obole' was split into two - perfectly
fitting - parts: symbols. This word 'symbol' is beautifully coined: only
when the two parts of the symbol are connected, the 'whole' appears.
Only when the part in our brain (the 'symbolic part') is connected to
the part (the 'real part') in the world, the 'whole' picture emerges. In
a way, 2nd life can facilitate the reintegration of meaning - at least,
that is what i think. 2nd Life is a tool to learn about your self. (This
might explain why adolescents are not interested: they're still
developing their (new) personality).

- there is a 'dark' side to 2nd life (it is inevitable, the good and the
bad result from making a distinction; you cannot have licht without donker,
no space without limits). It is a 'real illusion'. This implies that the
lies - also illusions - are also real, very real. What you see in 2nd
life is all you'll get and most of it is fiction, unreal, lies. The
'people' you meet seem real, the things you experience are only real in
your imagination (altough they're based on facts!). This will be the
main argument for trying to stop 2nd life: it makes perfectly clear how
we're manipulating (and are being manipulated) our selves. 2nd life
&lt;quote&gt; 'is bad' (end quote&gt;. What is 'true' and what is 'false' in 2nd
life depends on your own choice. It is a true (and false) relative
world. However, bear in mind that this also true in 'reality' as you
know it.

As caring facilitator - I feel responsible for the people I facilitate
and I think that making them aware of this is part of my job.

Hmmm, this turned out longer than i expected.

Addition:
- a group also tends to reflect the attitudes of its 'leader'. It is
important to realize that a group needing a facilitator is - at least
partly - ineffective in solving its own problems and that this
ineffectiveness is projected on the facilitator. A group also acts as a
mirror. When the facilitator is ineffective in some aspect, this might
be 'used' by the group - at first - to accept the facilitator and later
- when it is up to the group to decide - not to change its behavior.
This could imply that facilitating in 2nd Life might lead to acceptance
of ineffective behavior, 'correct' (meaning: correcting behavior)
solutions, but not 'real' changes. Always be aware of the double bind.

Best,

Jan

Neither sounds like a very exciting way to conceptualize &quot;life&quot;, to
me. I prefer interactions with people, not abstract depersonalized
concepts of people, including concepts about myself. That's just me.

Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Sometimes a conversation is just a
conversation. Sometimes a computer or network is just collections of
silicon, plastic and metal.

Actually I don't see a purpose to imbuing such things with mystical
powers.

Jan,

It seems that you have stepped into Alice's Wonderland -within- the mirror
itself ! :)

Your statements are loaded with paradox, which I feel is exactly where we
are consciously in terms of our human(e) evolutionary potential. The outcome
of these paradoxes (I believe) will be a new mythology for living and life.
It will be global in nature, rather than village or national. It will be
multi-centric and diverse but will also have an aligned set of planetary
values within it.

I do want to question your (seemed) conclusion, which is that Second Life is
bad and should be stopped (did I understand this correctly?). What ever your
opinion, I feel that the essence of your work DIRECTLY impacts a core aspect
of how we provide facilitation to groups. The rise of paradox (that you
address in your study) will change the nature of decision-making and the
generation of Œso-called¹ solutions and expected outcomes.

I seek to learn more about your study and your views and am looking forward
to a conversation with you if you are open to it.

Kindly, Vic
(a student of the Nature of Spirit within Matter)

I'd like to return to Elling's original observation that we may have
outgrown email and should consider an online community.

Easy way for newcomers to surf existing knowledge and earlier topics
without feeling bad about asking basic questions.
Blogs for the experienced participants who have leading-edge, thought-
provoking ideas.
Sub-groups for people facilitating in certain arenas e.g. River Lee
specializes in facilitating high performance teams in corporations.
Links out to participant websites, indexed by their area of focus and
expertise.
A wiki for definitions and with links and case studies.

Should we explore a few possibilities and then kick around the pros
and cons? Who's game to help?

I am embarrased to say that I have been planning to set up a
grp-facl wiki since we talked about this issue two years ago!

The University at Albany has only recently installed wiki
software and it's still in a pilot phase, so I still can't say
when I will be able to establish one here. I think a wiki would
be a far better way to make available the &quot;Resource Files&quot; that
are currently available on our web page:
http://www.albany.edu/cpr/gf/group_facilitation_resources.htm

Another outgrowth of the August 2005 discussion was that I
established two &quot;mirrors&quot; (replications) of the grp-facl
listserv, one on Google Groups and one on Yahoo Groups:

http://groups.google.com/group/grp-facl
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/grp-facl

As a means for sharing personal information and links, we can use
the Yahoo Group &lt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/grp-facl &gt;. Some
people have joined and made profiles available. Additional
features such as files and links are also available.

I was not aware that Google Groups had incorporated wiki
technology. The closest thing I can find to a wiki capability is
the &quot;Pages&quot; feature. Is there another feature that is more
wiki-capable?

Dr. Hamso's suggestions offer great opportunity. And, I must applaud the
response, as activity seems to have increased as we have 'come to bat'
for something we value.
I agree with Elling's comments that even modern vehicles have to be
modernized. And, it is possible that blogs, wikis, specialised chat/forum
areas could deliver well.
I have also noticed that my staff have always been hesitant in asking
questions or seeking advice, not wanting to 'appear dumb' by asking
questions that has been dealt with previously.
Perhaps this can be corrected by specialized foums, where the involved
can explore and examine, and the curious and interested can take
occasional excursions.
A central library of topics with a full legacy of examination,
commentaries, references and recommendations could be invaluable, if not
prove incredible.
I am not that technically-fit, but I am willing to assist if there is
consensus or another willingness. And, I admit that I have always been
hesitant in my involvement, but this is only because my professional
disposition prompts me to view rather than comment, and more so where I
have to respect that there is an abundance of expertise within this
dynamic vehicle...I humbly submit that I am a 'seek to understand rather
than just be understood&quot; buff.
But, I'm actively involved,
Kush

I prefer interactions too, with people. The point i'm trying to make is
that interactions is all there is. There is just me, myself and I and
these 'make up' ideas about people. I think - and there is no need to

Seems we should look at more than numbers

How many meaningful conversations are there and how many participated seems a better reflection?

In rugby, there is the term 'phases' about when the 'ball was active' - seems that concept would be meaningful to our discussions.

Also our personal situations makes a difference

Being busy and away are both reasons not to be active (many thanks for 'suspend' which is a handy option in these situations)

For myself, I live and do almost all my work on email as all the other options (face-to-face, telephone, websites) are unaffordable outside a 20 mile perimeter since we have monopoly telecom companies who charge us high rates and double charge for internet (pay for connecting phone call plus per minute on internet), petrol/gas is now about $6+/gallon (know high in Europe too but you can earn lots more than I can in Fiji) and don't know any other facilitators in Fiji (actually they exist but don't know of it as a profession).

So I'm thankful for this group and the email delivery.  We can always initiate a discussion or hit 'delete' when it's not an area of interest.

I'm also thankful for the reply/reply all optiion as another groups' members insist on only being able to reply to the whole group and we get a lot of private replies - which would count as 'activity' but are not meaningful to the group.

So thank you for this group's existence.  Barbara

&gt; Your statements are loaded with paradox, which I feel is exactly where we

It is loaded with paradoxes, off course, and i'm interested in your
ideas of 'an aligned set of planetary values' but i doubt - no, i know
for sure - that it'll have no new outcome. It is the other way around:
we're the outcome of the paradoxes and mythology is part of that. Also,
we cannot escape, solve or master these (12) paradoxes. What i see is
that we're becoming aware of the paradoxical nature of our existence -
/group life is inherently paradoxical/ - but this awareness emerges,
paradoxically, at a rate that is constrained by the very capacity of
facilitators to deal with paradoxes. This is at least my conclusion from
Ashby's law. To put it plainly: 'happiness is sacrificed in the pursuit
of happiness' or, differently, 'just realize that you're unhappy because
you don't realize you're happy'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I do want to question your (seemed) conclusion, which is that Second Life is
&gt; bad and should be stopped (did I understand this correctly?). What ever your
&gt; opinion, I feel that the essence of your work DIRECTLY impacts a core aspect
&gt; of how we provide facilitation to groups. The rise of paradox (that you
&gt; address in your study) will change the nature of decision-making and the
&gt; generation of OEso-called¹ solutions and expected outcomes.
">

Correction. I didn't conclude that 2nd life is bad, nor that it should
be stopped. I added quotes, just because i wanted to make sure that i
wouldn't be quoted badly. There you have it. Thanks. Nothing is bad, or
good, for that matter. Good and bad are just a way of speaking,
convenient for everyday use. What ever you feel necessary for yourself
is labeled 'good' or 'bad'.

And i do agree that understanding - living with - paradox is essential
for facilitation with groups (i did a well attended work shop in
Stockholm on the subject
http://www.mindatwork.nl/bestanden/Paradox_expression_2.pdf and plan to
have another one in Edinburgh ( on alignment ;-) ) ).
On the other hand, i don't expect that it will change the nature of
decision-making or solutions and outcomes. We're still subject to the
laws of chaos and will (have to) try every wrong solution before finally
settling on the right.

&gt;&gt; Dear friends,

&gt;&gt; I've participated in the on-line facilitating course by Zenergy and
&gt;&gt; there i made these remarks regarding 2nd life.

&gt;&gt; I've been discussing this topic with a friend/facilitator extensively.
&gt;&gt; He has his practice partly on second life (he supports people who have a
&gt;&gt; SL addiction; you need to have had an addiction to be able to do this).
&gt;&gt; We concluded:

&gt;&gt; - this is not a game (with only one rule: 'this is a game' ;-)).

&gt;&gt; - it is not very popular with the youth, young people (which is remarkable).

&gt;&gt; - this type adds something new to search applications (like Google): you
&gt;&gt; can see who is looking at the data too.

&gt;&gt; - this type of applications (Role Based Iterface) is a new type of
&gt;&gt; interface, as was the browser, the icons of the Apple and the line-based
&gt;&gt; interface of the mainframe. It emerges now, because it requires a 'thick
&gt;&gt; client' (read PC) and a fast network to be acceptable.

&gt;&gt; - it proves something we already 'knew' but didn't 'realize': reality is
&gt;&gt; (also) an illusion. It doens't imply that the universe doesn't exist. It
&gt;&gt; implies that you (that is, the combination of your body and brain)
&gt;&gt; create (and even: had to learn how to create it) in your head an image,
&gt;&gt; a symbolic, meaningful world and project this image on the 'real' world.
&gt;&gt; The projections are refined through interactions. Interaction is all
&gt;&gt; there is.

&gt;&gt; - what 'happens' with 'you' in 2nd life is that you actively engage your
&gt;&gt; projections, your symbolic being. 'You' are interacting with your
&gt;&gt; 'personality' and - ultimately - with your 'Self' in 1st life. 2nd Life
&gt;&gt; enables you to experiment with your personality, your dreams, fantasies,
&gt;&gt; not unlike other role playing games. But this is not a game.

&gt;&gt; - based on Jungian psychology i think that the computer screen 'acts' as
&gt;&gt; a mirror. A mirror reflects your image and - archetypically - also your
&gt;&gt; soul. When you look into a mirror, you also become aware of your
&gt;&gt; subconscious. (The funny thing is, water also can be a mirror and water
&gt;&gt; also stands for the subconscious). Based on the level of your personal
&gt;&gt; development (individuation), you will also see 'your personality', 'your
&gt;&gt; shadow',  'your anima or animus' and 'your Self'. For instance, when
&gt;&gt; you're having narcisistic phase, you'll want to know how 'beautiful' you
&gt;&gt; are, like the stephmother of Snowwhite (and remember: a mirror can not
&gt;&gt; lie!).  In fact - this has been described in a Japansese study on the
&gt;&gt; Noh-theater (these actors wear expressionlessmasks and prepare
&gt;&gt; themselves in front of mirrors), horizontally you percieve the'physical'
&gt;&gt; or  'ethical' world and vertically, you'll perceive the 'spiritual' or
&gt;&gt; 'esthetical world'.

&gt;&gt; - the PC enables us to have - warning, pun ahead - Windows on our mind.
&gt;&gt; Being Jungian by nature, i couldn't help noticing that this is an
&gt;&gt; explanation of the name 'Windows' and why the logo contains the four
&gt;&gt; colors, red, green, yellow and blue.  Now, 2nd life has taken this
&gt;&gt; window a step further. Not only can you perceive the information you're
&gt;&gt; looking for (remember, a mirror informs you too), you're also able to
&gt;&gt; look at how you - and others - are looking, framing that information.
&gt;&gt; You're able to experiment with different attitudes, personalities, avatars.

&gt;&gt; - why is it also disturbing? I think that it hints at the parts of your
&gt;&gt; personality that haven't yet been integrated into your Self. You feel
&gt;&gt; resistance when you're confronted with something you have to deal with,
&gt;&gt; learn, integrate. Not dealing with this might be much more easier, but
&gt;&gt; it will come back again and again. But this can also trap you into
&gt;&gt; addiction. Like alcohol or drugs: you do not have to 'realize'.

&gt;&gt; - 2nl life is a symbolic world. Not unlike the world in your (and mine)
&gt;&gt; head. Recently i learned that the word symbol comes from a splitted
&gt;&gt; coin. A Greek coin - called 'obole' was split into two - perfectly
&gt;&gt; fitting - parts: symbols. This word 'symbol' is beautifully coined: only
&gt;&gt; when the two parts of the symbol are connected, the 'whole' appears.
&gt;&gt; Only when the part in our brain (the 'symbolic part') is connected to
&gt;&gt; the part (the 'real part') in the world, the 'whole' picture emerges. In
&gt;&gt; a way, 2nd life can facilitate the reintegration of meaning - at least,
&gt;&gt; that is what i think. 2nd Life is a tool to learn about your self. (This
&gt;&gt; might explain why adolescents are not interested: they're still
&gt;&gt; developing their (new) personality).

&gt;&gt; - there is a 'dark' side to 2nd life (it is inevitable, the good and the
&gt;&gt; bad result from making a distinction; you cannot have licht without donker,
&gt;&gt; no space without limits). It is a 'real illusion'. This implies that the
&gt;&gt; lies - also illusions - are also real, very real. What you see in 2nd
&gt;&gt; life is all you'll get and most of it is fiction, unreal, lies. The
&gt;&gt; 'people' you meet seem real, the things you experience are only real in
&gt;&gt; your imagination (altough they're based on facts!). This will be the
&gt;&gt; main argument for trying to stop 2nd life: it makes perfectly clear how
&gt;&gt; we're manipulating (and are being manipulated) our selves. 2nd life
&gt;&gt; &lt;quote&gt; 'is bad' (end quote&gt;. What is 'true' and what is 'false' in 2nd
&gt;&gt; life depends on your own choice. It is a true (and false) relative
&gt;&gt; world. However, bear in mind that this also true in 'reality' as you
&gt;&gt; know it.

&gt;&gt; As caring facilitator - I feel responsible for the people I facilitate
&gt;&gt; and I think that making them aware of this is part of my job.

&gt;&gt; Hmmm, this turned out longer than i expected.

&gt;&gt; Addition:
&gt;&gt; - a group also tends to reflect the attitudes of its 'leader'. It is
&gt;&gt; important to realize that a group needing a facilitator is - at least
&gt;&gt; partly - ineffective in solving its own problems and that this
&gt;&gt; ineffectiveness is projected on the facilitator. A group also acts as a
&gt;&gt; mirror. When the facilitator is ineffective in some aspect, this might
&gt;&gt; be 'used' by the group - at first - to accept the facilitator and later
&gt;&gt; - when it is up to the group to decide - not to change its behavior.
&gt;&gt; This could imply that facilitating in 2nd Life might lead to

I'm half goofing around, but the last point regarding imbuing things

transformative powers in terms of reshaping human beings, is a
serious one.

In the West we tend to view technology as transformative, and the
solution to any problem, even though historically this probably has
been very very rare.

And our tendency to do this results in a lot of technology with a lot
of &quot;promise&quot; absolutely ending up as doing doing useful in the end.

I don't think that changing the structures of the medium will make
much difference, because I don't think it addresses any of the shifts
that have taken place that by and large have resulted in much lower
volumes of communication on most professional mailing lists.

Just my take, generally, is that online communities are NOT defined
by the software, or the modes of interaction. They are defined by the
attitudes of the people, and in the older days, people participated
on this list, and many other lists as members of a community --
something held in common with a sense of personal ownership.

The change occurred that people began to think of these things less
as community and more as a basic functional way of communicating
without any &quot;ties&quot;. Novelty wore off. It's become, for some, just
more work. For others (like myself), sitting at a computer doing
ANYTHING is just more work.

Most social networks aren't communities either, and neither are
wikis.

Some of us old timers bemoan the loss of &quot;our&quot; online communities,
but I think the reality is that most professionals are now in a
different place with respect to technology. Or there are so many
options that participation in any single one is much less.

If people want a community, they will create it. And they will use
whatever &quot;meeting place&quot; is available. In the old days they could
meet at the Church, or the school, or the diner, or the bar..whatever
was available.

So, it's not the place, figuratively or literally. It's the people.

any of them have much in the way of activity.  They

&gt; &gt;&gt; Here are the average number of posts per day

&gt; &gt;&gt; I think it would be fair to say that traffic has

&gt; &gt;&gt; 2007      2.9

&gt; &gt;&gt; Oddly, the number of subscribers is at an

I'm an oldie. I agree with Robt that it isn't the medium, we've explored options from time to time over the years and new fangled technology doesn't change the basic interaction. In my practice I don't use groupware, although was gung ho back in 96 when we tried it out at the IAF conf. Was all set to spend thousands of dollars in cash and gold jewelry... but didn't, never had a client that wanted it, never had an reason to explore further.

But...

One of the things we wanted to do was establish the profession of facilitation, to create profession credibility (in addition to the skills dev and info exchange etc). While the post-it and sticky wall methods are pretty much all I ever need or imagine needing, still I feel like my skillset has a void because I'm not &quot;up on&quot; the latest tools. I think new folks seeing our community might have the expectation that as leaders in our profession we're current with available technology. From that standpoint I see the new medium as simply a new delivery system for the same old stuff we like. If it makes us look more &quot;professional&quot; to the world, all to the good.

But...

Who pays for hosting, who owns the IP, who's responsible for archiving, permissions, security, data integrity, blahblahblah. I'd say if Sandy thought this was an augmentation manageable within our current association structure and Albany's infrastructure can host it (so all we see is a new homepage if we choose to &quot;go look&quot; but we still get push posts and don't actually have to wade through threads and communities and groups like other portals similar to the new one envisioned) then it sounds worth looking at. If not, then it sounds like a redundant doppleganger that will splinter the group.

James,

I guess you are a member of communities like www.linkedin.com &lt; http://www.linkedin.com/ &gt; , www.ecademy.com &lt; http://www.ecademy.com/ &gt; , www.xing.com &lt; http://www.xing.com/ &gt; , etc. The thing is nothing happens if you don't make it happen, you have to put something in to get something out, you have to make yourself attractive to the kind of people you want to attract, e.g. by contributing your opinions and expertise in relefvant blogs, wikis, discussion groups, etc.

What I have found to be a totally new and refreshing experience is www.facebook.com &lt; http://www.facebook.com/ &gt;  which enables me to keep better in touch with grown-up children and their friends, nephews and nieces that tend to drift away as the years pass, close and distant personal friends as well as business friends and acquaintances. If you find that you don't have enough time to maintain all the personal relationships, then Facebook (or MySpace or something similar) is your tool.

A student phoned me out of the blue a few weeks ago, she was doing a Ph.D. on sustainable meetings in South Africa and wondered if I could help her with some contacts, which I was happy to do. I then found her on Facebook, had a look at her family and holiday pictures, what books she reads and what she thought about them, her favourite movies, music, etc. and the countries she had visited. By our next phone conversation I really felt I knew her much better than if I had not spent a few minutes on her Facebook, but I forgot to ask her what she was doing visiting most countries in East-Africa, maybe her parents were missionaries or diplomates or something, maybe she was just backpacking, must ask her next time we speak....

Best regards
Elling

Emne: Re: [GF] Seems like activity has gone down . . .

I would need help with this transition.  I am on
several of these communities, using twiki's but not
any of them have much in the way of activity.  They
seem just to sit there.  Anyone got a list of good
ways for these?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [GF] Seems like activity has gone
&gt; down . . .

&gt; &gt;&gt; Here are the average number of posts per day
&gt; since 1996.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I think it would be fair to say that traffic has
&gt; decreased.

&gt; &gt;&gt; 1996       6.3
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1997       5.0
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1998       6.8

&gt; &gt;&gt; 2000       6.1
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2001       5.7
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2002       8.3
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2003       7.5
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2004       5.3
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2005       4.4
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2006       4.3
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2007       2.9

&gt; &gt;&gt; Oddly, the number of subscribers is at an
&gt; all-time high -- 990!
&gt; &gt;&gt; Here are the average number of subscribers by
&gt; year.

&gt; &gt;&gt; 1996       483
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1997       607
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1998       826
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1999       897
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2000       862
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2001       895

&gt; &gt;&gt; 2006       859
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2007       962

&gt; &gt;&gt; We had a discussion on this topic in August 2005
&gt; with the
&gt; &gt;&gt; subject heading &quot;793 subscribers time to move?&quot;

Robert,
Having set up a few dozen discussion groups and communities since the first one in 1984, I totally agree with you. If you don't have the people and the common purpose, it will not work. I have set up enough failures to know. If you have the people and the purpose, technology matters if you want to really make it fly, just like good facilitation matters.

A friend asked me recently why I had become a member of IAF, a group of oldies unable to imagine anything beyond a flipover and magic marker. I don't know how widespread is this image, but I don't think it is how we want to be seen. This current community software suits that image.

I recommend everyone to read Wikinomics by Dan Tapscott and Anthony Williams, if you have only a remote interest in where our society is heading, I think you will find this thoroughly researched book an eyeopener.

Best
Elling

Just my 2 cents worth on this. I realize I've been around a long

I don't think that changing the structures of the medium will make
much difference, because I don't think it addresses any of the shifts
that have taken place that by and large have resulted in much lower
volumes of communication on most professional mailing lists.

Just my take, generally, is that online communities are NOT defined
by the software, or the modes of interaction. They are defined by the
attitudes of the people, and in the older days, people participated
on this list, and many other lists as members of a community --
something held in common with a sense of personal ownership.

The change occurred that people began to think of these things less
as community and more as a basic functional way of communicating
without any &quot;ties&quot;. Novelty wore off. It's become, for some, just
more work. For others (like myself), sitting at a computer doing
ANYTHING is just more work.

Most social networks aren't communities either, and neither are
wikis.

Some of us old timers bemoan the loss of &quot;our&quot; online communities,
but I think the reality is that most professionals are now in a
different place with respect to technology. Or there are so many
options that participation in any single one is much less.

If people want a community, they will create it. And they will use
whatever &quot;meeting place&quot; is available. In the old days they could
meet at the Church, or the school, or the diner, or the bar..whatever
was available.

So, it's not the place, figuratively or literally. It's the people.

Thanks, all, for this conversation.  Yes, it is
complicated, yes fast moving, yes we have to figure it
out . . . not only for ourselves / our practices, but
also for those we serve who live in this same world.

Gracias

coming through, the tide is out, and the air is just

How about a study group on wikinomics?  I can pick up
a copy next trip to Halifax . . . anyone interested?

Well, yes and no; but perhaps the word 'exchange'  is better (Dutch:
/wisselwerking/). Breathing is a kind of exchange, interaction.  Try to
use 'exchanges' as one of the few assumptions to  think about facilitation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Hmmm, inconsistent. I agree with the cigar, but - when you prefer
&gt;&gt; interactions with people - there is no such thing as just a
&gt;&gt; conversation. Sometimes a human being is just Flesh and Blood?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually I don't see a purpose to imbuing such things with mystical
&gt;&gt;&gt; powers.

&gt;&gt; I see.

&gt; I'm half goofing around, but the last point regarding imbuing things
&gt; that are technologically based with mystical powers, or even
&gt; transformative powers in terms of reshaping human beings, is a
&gt; serious one.

I agree.
&gt; In the West we tend to view technology as transformative, and the
&gt; solution to any problem, even though historically this probably has
&gt; been very very rare.
">

'Men tend to generalize' my wife uses to say. Problem solving led to
'artefacts' and to technology. The problem is that problem solving is
also paradoxical. Every 'new' solution creates 'new' problems. This is
also what i mean by saying 'exchange is all there is'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And our tendency to do this results in a lot of technology with a lot
&gt; of &quot;promise&quot; absolutely ending up as doing doing useful in the end.
">

? OK :-\    . Although I do not intend to use causality as an
explanation - in the long run there is no cause and effect. I assume
that our intentional nature 'caused' our problem solving attitude and
this 'led' to world views which are either transformative (linear,
&quot;western&quot;) or conservative (circular, &quot;eastern&quot;). In fact, it is both,
but never at the same time.

Best,

Jan

The Google Groups 'page' feature does seem to be wiki powered to me, but I have only recently discovered it and only played about a bit in my sandbox (bring your bucket and spade and join me at http://groups.google.com/group/ellingsandbox )

I use wikis a lot in client relationships, www.pbwiki.com works well, but there are hundreds of alternatives, it will take you 30 seconds to set it up and it is free. I used to communicate with clients by emails and document attachments, now I set up a wiki for the job, give them the password and all the documents are in one place, always up to date, anyone can comment or change as necessary.  It is easy to do, but it requires a somewhat different mindset, if you are not prepared to exploit the new technology and rather want it to do for you what you always have done, then don't.

Emne: Re: [GF] Seems like activity has gone down . . .

I am embarrased to say that I have been planning to set up a
grp-facl wiki since we talked about this issue two years ago!

The University at Albany has only recently installed wiki
software and it's still in a pilot phase, so I still can't say
when I will be able to establish one here. I think a wiki would
be a far better way to make available the &quot;Resource Files&quot; that
are currently available on our web page:
http://www.albany.edu/cpr/gf/group_facilitation_resources.htm

Another outgrowth of the August 2005 discussion was that I
established two &quot;mirrors&quot; (replications) of the grp-facl
listserv, one on Google Groups and one on Yahoo Groups:

http://groups.google.com/group/grp-facl
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/grp-facl

As a means for sharing personal information and links, we can use
the Yahoo Group &lt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/grp-facl &gt;. Some
people have joined and made profiles available. Additional
features such as files and links are also available.

I was not aware that Google Groups had incorporated wiki
technology. The closest thing I can find to a wiki capability is
the &quot;Pages&quot; feature. Is there another feature that is more

I am a big wiki user in the same way as Elling. Pbwiki and Socialtext are my
favored choices. Clients often lose track of emails, but when the exchange
of ideas is via a wiki there is only the one address to go to and everything
is there. The ability to co-author a document and still track back to
earlier versions encourages transparency and involvement. In my signature to
this email is the address for a public wiki I've created to introduce
clients and colleagues to Web2.0. Please take a look.

I appreciate Google Groups but as has been noted on this listserv, they are
not private (for reasons I don't understand). There has been discussion of
postings showing up in public Google searches. And then there are the ads .
. .

Great topic and certainly has sparked conversation.

Thanks, all, for this conversation.  Yes, it is

&gt; A friend asked me recently why I had become a member

&gt; I recommend everyone to read Wikinomics by Dan

&gt; think you will find this thoroughly researched book

&gt; Emne: Re: [GF] Seems like activity has gone down . .

&gt; Just my 2 cents worth on this. I realize I've been
&gt; around a long
&gt; time, and doing online community building even
&gt; before the Internet
&gt; was public on commodore 64's.

&gt; &gt; I'd like to return to Elling's original
&gt; observation that we may have
&gt; &gt; outgrown email and should consider an online
&gt; community.

&gt; &gt; Easy way for newcomers to surf existing knowledge
&gt; and earlier topics
&gt; &gt; without feeling bad about asking basic questions.
&gt; &gt; Blogs for the experienced participants who have
&gt; leading-edge, thought-
&gt; &gt; provoking ideas.
&gt; &gt; Sub-groups for people facilitating in certain
&gt; arenas e.g. River Lee
&gt; &gt; specializes in facilitating high performance teams
&gt; in corporations.
&gt; &gt; Links out to participant websites, indexed by
&gt; their area of focus and
&gt; &gt; expertise.
&gt; &gt; A wiki for definitions and with links and case
&gt; studies.

&gt; &gt; Should we explore a few possibilities and then
&gt; kick around the pros
&gt; &gt; and cons? Who's game to help?

&gt; I don't think that changing the structures of the
&gt; medium will make
&gt; much difference, because I don't think it addresses
&gt; any of the shifts
&gt; that have taken place that by and large have
&gt; resulted in much lower
&gt; volumes of communication on most professional
&gt; mailing lists.

&gt; Just my take, generally, is that online communities
&gt; are NOT defined
&gt; by the software, or the modes of interaction. They
&gt; are defined by the
&gt; attitudes of the people, and in the older days,
&gt; people participated
&gt; on this list, and many other lists as members of a
&gt; community --
&gt; something held in common with a sense of personal
&gt; ownership.

&gt; The change occurred that people began to think of
&gt; these things less
&gt; as community and more as a basic functional way of
&gt; communicating
&gt; without any &quot;ties&quot;. Novelty wore off. It's become,
&gt; for some, just
&gt; more work. For others (like myself), sitting at a
&gt; computer doing
&gt; ANYTHING is just more work.

&gt; Most social networks aren't communities either, and
&gt; neither are
&gt; wikis.

&gt; Some of us old timers bemoan the loss of &quot;our&quot;
&gt; online communities,
&gt; but I think the reality is that most professionals
&gt; are now in a
&gt; different place with respect to technology. Or there
&gt; are so many
&gt; options that participation in any single one is much
&gt; less.

&gt; If people want a community, they will create it. And
&gt; they will use
&gt; whatever &quot;meeting place&quot; is available. In the old
&gt; days they could
&gt; meet at the Church, or the school, or the diner, or
&gt; the bar..whatever
&gt; was available.

&gt; So, it's not the place, figuratively or literally.
&gt; It's the people.

Yes, Margie, I am inspired also!

Thank you to James for bringing up the subject, and thank you to Loretta and
others who are offering possibilities for new learning...

I also found Margaret Runchey's post particularly resonated for me... I too
like to keep things simple BUT I also feel the need to stay current
professionally BUT there are a lot of logistical issues involved...

AND, if we could somehow have the best of both worlds (still getting push
posts while also having some fancier web-based stuff to explore) that would
be wonderful... Thank you Margaret...

AND, I'm also hearing Ann's comment about how something feeling like death,
or the fear of death..

And at the same time, I'm also hearing how &quot;alive&quot; this feels for others...

And, I'm thinking that this may not be so much of a contradiction... For
example in the sense of how &quot;alive&quot; one might feel while skiing, and yet at
the same time, there is certainly risk and at least the appearance of a
greater possibility of harm or injury, than if one were sitting safely
curled up by the fire...

And, I am feeling hopeful, that we can make enough space for the skiers
among us as well as those who would prefer to curl up by the fire, and, that
we can continue to feel part of a larger whole that includes both...

(And, I'm delighted by the presence of so many women on this thread, as to
me that is generally the sign of a really good conversation!!! :-)

With all best wishes,

Rosa

I too use wikis in my private practice. However for the purposes
of grp-facl it is important that we have an advertisement-free,
low-cost, full-featured, reliable, long-term, solution. (That is
why I have been waiting for the University at Albany, which hosts
the grp-facl listserv, to make wikis available, since I will then
be assured of its longevity.)

You asked why I decided to go with an on-line magazine as my way to
communicate. I had to ponder that as I thought it was just a personal
preference with no connection to the profession or even to technology.
Rather, I'm restless with the conversations online.  As someone pointed
out last year, our e-mails have gravitated towards resources and best
practices.  These are great training but don't really connect on a
deeper level. I have felt a longing to express myself more fully.
Further, while I love being in touch globally, I'm frustrated that the
folks in my home town do not operate on a level that provides food for
thought.  So, I decided to mentor them to write for my magazine, to
think bigger, to organize their information and thoughts for a national
audience.  I want them to be able to join my national writers.  To my
surprise, and I may be naive, I found that many &quot;national writers&quot; have
very limited audiences and are scrambling to be heard.  The competition
to be heard is thunderous.  In an illustration of how the market for
written ideas is changing, rather than paying writers, some on-line
magazines are charging people to publish their articles.

One of you e-mailed me that you had a stockpile of articles that could
be reprinted free of charge in my magazine.  Please forgive me, but my
computer crashed and I lost your e-mail and cannot contact you.  I'd
very much like to chat so please e-mail me again.

I would like to reply to several recent comments.

Ideally I would cut and paste related comments from each of the
contributors, organize them by topic, and then add my own
comments. However, given the volume of messages and the time it
would take to do this, I have replied in aggregate. My apologies
for not acknowledging the initiating posts and contributors.

Below I have organized my comments as follows.

1. New technologies.
2. Sub-groups or special-topic groups
3. Topically organized historical record of discussions,
insights, and resources.
4. Are we a community.

1. New technologies.

We have had a long history of experimenting with new and
different technologies. For example, we recently looked at
attendr &lt; http://attendr.com/grpfacl &gt; and frapper
http://www.frappr.com/?a=constellation_map&amp;mapid;=137439422001
and, as noted previously, created mirror groups on Yahoo and
Google Groups.

Indeed, Grp-Facl started out in 1995 as the UseNet Newsgroup
misc.business.facilitators. (You can still find it in Google
Groups
&lt; http://groups.google.com/group/misc.business.facilitators &gt;.) We
shifted away from that technology because of the difficulty in
keeping out irrelevant posts.

At some point we added a web page and web-based access to the
archives and subscription options.

I think we should continue to experiment with new technologies,
as is currently underway with &lt; http://grpfacl.ning.com/ &gt;. It
would be useful to have any resulting findings and suggestions
reported here for everyone to assess.

2. Sub-groups or special-topic groups

There are many sub-groupings by which we could organize ourselves
and develop separate discussion for each, e.g, large group
interventions; Total Quality Management; electronic meeting
systems; dialogue; strategic planning; graphic facilitation; JAD;
team building; project management; community planning ... In the
past, when we have considered creating sub-groups or sub-topics
-- a feature that is already available to us using the existing
Listserv software -- the conclusion has been that we would more
likely devolve into unsustainable subgroups, and that it was
valuable to retain the &quot;critical mass&quot; offered by one larger
group.

On the other hand, a successful spin-off group is one that
focuses on online facilitation
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/onlinefacilitation/

Other means for addressing &quot;newcomers&quot; as a sub-group have been
successful. &quot;Stupid Question Friday&quot; was one way to invite
newcomers (and others who might be reluctant to raise a question)
to initate topics without separating them into a new subgroup.

3. Topically organized historical record of discussions,
insights, and resources.

Topically organized discussion threads are very valuable and it
would be useful to have a technology that does a better job of
doing so. However, until such time as we have something better,
please make use of the following existing resources:

a) The Grp-Facl Archives
&lt; http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/archives/grp-facl.html &gt; are
organized in discussion threads using the email's subject heading
as the &quot;topic.&quot; (This is why it is valuable to retain the
previous subject heading when you reply to a message, and use a
new subject heading when you begin or pick up a new thread.) The
archives go back to June 1996.

b) The Grp-Facl Resource Files
&lt; http://www.albany.edu/cpr/gf/group_facilitation_resources.htm &gt;
include many compiled discussion threads (where the compiler of
the thread made the effort to edit out extraneaous materials and
pull together related discussions from different subject
headings). Additional compiled threads are available on the IAF
website.

Please note too that historical files such as these have
strengths and weaknesses. For example, as many times as we have
had email discussions on &quot;process vs. content&quot; and &quot;neutrality&quot;
(I would say about once a year) it seems that each time something
new comes up. I'm not sure that we would all benefit from those
new insights, nor would we have the interaction that builds
community, if our main vehicle for interaction were wiki pages on
those topics. Nonetheless I think its a strategy we should try.

4. Are we a community

I think the question of whether we are a &quot;community&quot; should not
be determined by which technologies we use. While many
technologies use the word &quot;community&quot; or &quot;collaboration&quot; in their
names or descriptions, this does not necessarily make them so.

Nor does the lack of such terms in &quot;Group Facilitation: Process
Expertise for Group Effectiveness&quot; (the full name for grp-facl)
or &quot;the group faciliation listserv&quot; mean that we are *not* a
community.

I suspect that some of us feel we are part of a community, and
others not. And let's keep in mind that some subscribers might
not be interested in &quot;community.&quot;

Whatever it is we are, I think we should be open-minded about how
we can do it better, including what technologies we should use.
And whatever it is we are, we might consider that perhaps we
should be something a little different. And whatever it is we
are, we should keep in mind that we are not alone. There are many
related discussion groups, websites, and communities.

Sandy,
I appreciate you for carrying this ball for a decade. I appreciate that  you understand this list's metadimensions as an &quot;official&quot; vehicle of the International Association of Facilitators. Professional associations have broader purposes and deeper intents than simple friends networks. I appreciate your thoughtful summaries. I appreciate all the work you do for us, all you've done for us. I also appreciate the time and care others (Loretta, Jan, Jim, &lt;your name here&gt;) are giving to strengthening our global facilitation community.
Thank you all.

&gt;doing so. However, until such time as we have something better,
&gt;please make use of the following existing resources:

&gt;a) The Grp-Facl Archives
&gt;&lt; http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/archives/grp-facl.html &gt; are
&gt;organized in discussion threads using the email's subject heading
&gt;as the &quot;topic.&quot; (This is why it is valuable to retain the
&gt;previous subject heading when you reply to a message, and use a
&gt;new subject heading when you begin or pick up a new thread.) The
&gt;archives go back to June 1996.

&gt;b) The Grp-Facl Resource Files
&gt;&lt; http://www.albany.edu/cpr/gf/group_facilitation_resources.htm &gt;
&gt;include many compiled discussion threads (where the compiler of
&gt;the thread made the effort to edit out extraneaous materials and
&gt;pull together related discussions from different subject
&gt;headings). Additional compiled threads are available on the IAF
&gt;website.

&gt;Please note too that historical files such as these have
&gt;strengths and weaknesses. For example, as many times as we have
&gt;had email discussions on &quot;process vs. content&quot; and &quot;neutrality&quot;
&gt;(I would say about once a year) it seems that each time something
&gt;new comes up. I'm not sure that we would all benefit from those
&gt;new insights, nor would we have the interaction that builds
&gt;community, if our main vehicle for interaction were wiki pages on
&gt;those topics. Nonetheless I think its a strategy we should try.

&gt;4. Are we a community

&gt;I think the question of whether we are a &quot;community&quot; should not
&gt;be determined by which technologies we use. While many
&gt;technologies use the word &quot;community&quot; or &quot;collaboration&quot; in their
&gt;names or descriptions, this does not necessarily make them so.

&gt;Nor does the lack of such terms in &quot;Group Facilitation: Process
&gt;Expertise for Group Effectiveness&quot; (the full name for grp-facl)
&gt;or &quot;the group faciliation listserv&quot; mean that we are *not* a
&gt;community.

&gt;I suspect that some of us feel we are part of a community, and
&gt;others not. And let's keep in mind that some subscribers might
&gt;not be interested in &quot;community.&quot;

&gt;Whatever it is we are, I think we should be open-minded about how
&gt;we can do it better, including what technologies we should use.
&gt;And whatever it is we are, we might consider that perhaps we
&gt;should be something a little different. And whatever it is we
&gt;are, we should keep in mind that we are not alone. There are many
&gt;related discussion groups, websites, and communities.

There's obviously interest in change.  I have a few comments; perhaps
one or two might be helpful.

Sandy does indeed do a great job at this, as has been noted.  While I
like experimentation, I'd be /strongly/ inclined not to split off
GRP-FACL into separate Web 2.0 tools.  I'd much rather wait a bit
until the University at Albany's systems are ready and Sandy can put
together a system that could have longevity, if it turns out to be
useful.  When and if you try an experiment, think about both the
short-term experimental issues and the longer-term information
migration issues, and work /with/ Sandy, not independently of him.  If
in the process of trying a nifty experiment, you create excess work
for him, you might just push him past some tipping point, and you may
not be ready to commit to a decade or more of daily maintenance of
this group of 1,000 plus its tools.

While I spend almost all of my working life online in one way or
another (and, yes, I do use blogs, Wikis and other tools), I'm leary
of trying to replace this mailing list.  Think about the purpose first
and the technology second.  A Wiki could be very good, I think, in
terms of joint creation of documents (perhaps augmenting or even
replacing the methods database someday), but it's not as well suited
for discussion (yes, you can do discussion in a Wiki -- that I know).

Even with Atom or RSS, neither blogs nor Wikis nor tools such as Web
Crossing facilitate discussion the way a mailing list or USENET do.
With a decent MUA and newsreader (one and the same in my case at
least), I seem to be able to skim many mailing lists and USENET groups
faster than I can get back through those other forums, and it takes a
bit of care to be sure one is (or easily can be) subscribed to all the
commenting.  With a decent archiving system, it's not that hard to
search or browse the archives of a mailing list, either, and Google
Groups makes it pretty easy to browse old USENET groups.  (Yes, I know
the problem we had with USENET, and I'm not really trying to resurrect
misc.facilitation or whatever it was.)

I do find those tools helpful for specific purposes when they are one
of my primary areas of focus.  If I'm working with a couple of clients
on issues, you can bet I'll be checking into those sites frequently.
If I'm a member of a bunch of mailing lists and USENET groups, I want
the tools to help me stay up to date better.

Finally, someone pointed to an article suggesting Web 2.0 may not be a
panacea.  I stumbled across
http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2166304,00.asp , which posits that
we may well be at the peak of a bubble.

To be honest, I don't see a problem with GRP-FACL as it stands.  When
someone has something to ask or say, I presume they'll ask or say it.
When they don't, I have a few more moments to attend to other things.
With a good threaded MUA, I can easily track conversations (assuming
people don't corrupt headers by responding to an old message, changing
the subject, and thinking that starts a new thread -- it doesn't).  It
takes a few seconds to log into the archives to search history, but it's
not that much of a problem.

And, yes, Robert, I agree that general online conversation seems to have
declined in at least some of the old fora.  I used to get a lot out of
some action research lists that are now largely silent, and learning-org
has disappeared.  In both cases, I think the archives are still present
(more evidence of the utility of changing tools with care).

Here's an idea that might be interesting, for those who want to try an
experiment: what about setting up an IRQ channel for group facilitation?
IRC doesn't typically get archived, so sustainability isn't a big deal.
With a good IRC client (I use ERC), it's possible to track multiple IRC
threads at once.

Then again, I'm having trouble seeing why.  I can imagine two purposes:
to hang out together, for which I suspect people may be too busy, or to
get real-time answers to questions, for which I suspect there's little
need in facilitation (how many of us might turn to the group _during_ a
meeting to ask what's a good dotting technique?).  Then again, it could
be handy in the design phase of a facilitation, when you're sitting at
your desk working.

If you do try it, I'd still suggest involving Sandy.  In case someone
starts something like that (especially for the second purpose), three
more comments: hang out on IRC for a while, if you're not familiar with
it, to get the culture (it's far different than here), select a common
node used by many chats so we don't need to log into too many different
nodes, and then post the information here so people know how to join --
I might give it a try.

Here's a question: does the decline in discussion here signal or presage
a decline in the need for facilitators?  Are people increasingly doing
it (running meetings) themselves?

Just a few random Friday evening ideas.  Thoughts?

I'm not a professional facilitator; I'm an IT management consultant who
recognizes the increasingly dire need for facilitation and effective
communication in organizations if technology is to be used effectively and
provide real value. Not being a professional facilitator, I cannot claim
extensive knowledge or experience with methods and practices used in
facilitation, therefore often cannot contribute to discussion topics in
those areas. As such, I've long been one of those 'eyeballs only' members of
the group.

I've often been impressed by the degree of civilized and professional
discourse within the group. There are many instances of useful comment. I
picked up, however, on Ms. Levine's comment about connecting '...at a deeper
level.' As someone who's work increasingly involves organizational change or
transformation consequent to technology implementation, I'm constantly
searching for information that would let me understand organizational
behavior so that I might better effect the odds on success of technology
implementations. I assume your role as facilitators would require insight
into the psychology and behavior of groups, which would permit selection of
appropriate facilitation methods.

It is this articulation of insight (tacit knowledge?) I search for, and
perhaps this is one aspect of the 'deeper level' which Ms. Levine seeks. The
choice of enabling technology--mailing list, blog, wiki, discussion
forum--will not affect the quality of discussion, quality in my mind being
the 'deeper level' needed to sustain interest in the long term.

In my opinion, a wiki (or weblog) would not be a suitable tool for the type
of activity currently predominant in the group. As Mr. Harris stated, a wiki
is meant for joint creation of documents--documents covering a specific
topic--and discussion is secondary. (The participation statistics provided
by Mr. Schuman, by the way, I believe are typical of any online group; the
majority are interested observers and only a fraction of members actively
contribute. Those numbers, therefore, do not indicate failure in any sense.)
This is not to say that a wiki does not have a place; only that it is not a
'magic bullet' to either participation or level of discussion.

Regards,
Peter Blackmore

P.S. Mr. Harris' comment about the Web 2.0 bubble is interesting. In this
instance, however, I do not think it is a technology bubble similar to the
one that led to the dot.com meltdown. This time, I believe we're seeing a
participation bubble. Huge numbers (of so-called &quot;amateurs&quot;) are blogging,
wiki-ing, twitter-ing, getting on Facebook. Entrepreneurs and corporations
are desperate to tap into the phenomenon to make a buck, but the majority
haven't yet figured out the whole thing.

It it's not broke, don't fix it!

I have only contributed a few times over the years, however, I do feel part
of a community ...... And I do not think I have met any of you face-to-face!

I love the idea of experimenting with new approaches and new technologies,
as long as the process is allowed to grow organically.  And any of these new
ways do not have to replace this listserv, certainly not in the short-term.
The new ways may become the primary way in the medium term, but meanwhile
this wonderful listserv can provide a foundation and a home to return to in
a world of change.

John.

Hi folks.

Thanks Margaret - I agree that it isn't the technology - entirely. I
do think that we are all less enthralled and more used to the instant
access of e-mail etc.

It's not the technology - it's the facilitation.  Really.  Just as in
a room full of people, this list has an &quot;in group&quot; and the rest of us
- lurkers.  There are about 20 or so people who do all the talking -
occasionally someone new pops up to ask a question - but most of the
time it's Jan, Robert, Sandor, Jon, Loretta..... and those of us
lurking can tell you know each other but we're not part of the
conversation.  Personally, I've put a toe in a few times - perhaps
what I offered (I tried  looking back at the archives, but there's a
problem with getting there) was not provocative enough but since
there wasn't a response - I essentially stopped thinking of joining
conversations.

I wonder if there are other lurkers who share my experience?

&gt; I'm an oldie. I agree with Robt that it isn't the medium, we've

&gt; don't use groupware, although was gung ho back in 96 when we tried
&gt; it out at the IAF conf. Was all set to spend thousands of dollars
&gt; in cash and gold jewelry... but didn't, never had a client that
&gt; wanted it, never had an reason to explore further.

&gt; But...

&gt; One of the things we wanted to do was establish the profession of
&gt; facilitation, to create profession credibility (in addition to the
&gt; skills dev and info exchange etc). While the post-it and sticky
&gt; wall methods are pretty much all I ever need or imagine needing,
&gt; still I feel like my skillset has a void because I'm not &quot;up on&quot;
&gt; the latest tools. I think new folks seeing our community might have
&gt; the expectation that as leaders in our profession we're current
&gt; with available technology. From that standpoint I see the new
&gt; medium as simply a new delivery system for the same old stuff we
&gt; like. If it makes us look more &quot;professional&quot; to the world, all to
&gt; the good.

&gt; But...

&gt; Who pays for hosting, who owns the IP, who's responsible for
&gt; archiving, permissions, security, data integrity, blahblahblah. I'd
&gt; say if Sandy thought this was an augmentation manageable within our
&gt; current association structure and Albany's infrastructure can host
&gt; it (so all we see is a new homepage if we choose to &quot;go look&quot; but
&gt; we still get push posts and don't actually have to wade through
&gt; threads and communities and groups like other portals similar to
&gt; the new one envisioned) then it sounds worth looking at. If not,
&gt; then it sounds like a redundant doppleganger that will splinter the
&gt; group.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd like to return to Elling's original observation that we may
&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; outgrown email and should consider an online community.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Easy way for newcomers to surf existing knowledge and earlier topics
&gt;&gt;&gt; without feeling bad about asking basic questions.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Blogs for the experienced participants who have leading-edge,
&gt;&gt;&gt; thought-
&gt;&gt;&gt; provoking ideas.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sub-groups for people facilitating in certain arenas e.g. River Lee
&gt;&gt;&gt; specializes in facilitating high performance teams in corporations.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Links out to participant websites, indexed by their area of focus
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; expertise.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A wiki for definitions and with links and case studies.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Should we explore a few possibilities and then kick around the pros
&gt;&gt;&gt; and cons? Who's game to help?

&gt;&gt; I don't think that changing the structures of the medium will make
&gt;&gt; much difference, because I don't think it addresses any of the shifts
&gt;&gt; that have taken place that by and large have resulted in much lower
&gt;&gt; volumes of communication on most professional mailing lists.

&gt;&gt; Just my take, generally, is that online communities are NOT defined
&gt;&gt; by the software, or the modes of interaction. They are defined by the
&gt;&gt; attitudes of the people, and in the older days, people participated
&gt;&gt; on this list, and many other lists as members of a community --
&gt;&gt; something held in common with a sense of personal ownership.

&gt;&gt; The change occurred that people began to think of these things less
&gt;&gt; as community and more as a basic functional way of communicating
&gt;&gt; without any &quot;ties&quot;. Novelty wore off. It's become, for some, just
&gt;&gt; more work. For others (like myself), sitting at a computer doing
&gt;&gt; ANYTHING is just more work.

&gt;&gt; Most social networks aren't communities either, and neither are
&gt;&gt; wikis.

&gt;&gt; Some of us old timers bemoan the loss of &quot;our&quot; online communities,
&gt;&gt; but I think the reality is that most professionals are now in a
&gt;&gt; different place with respect to technology. Or there are so many
&gt;&gt; options that participation in any single one is much less.

&gt;&gt; If people want a community, they will create it. And they will use
&gt;&gt; whatever &quot;meeting place&quot; is available. In the old days they could
&gt;&gt; meet at the Church, or the school, or the diner, or the bar..whatever
&gt;&gt; was available.

&gt;&gt; So, it's not the place, figuratively or literally. It's the people.

Hello All,

The one format that no one has suggested is a Forum.  These are popular in
many industries and work great.  They allow members to post ideas, review,
look back, comment, and create new threads.  Everything is easily archived
and forums can handle thousands of users at once.   They are cheap to set up
and easy to run.  If you want to view one, I have a facilitator forum at:

www.mgrconsulting.com/forums/index_vba.php

I'm not suggesting that my forum replace this, but the IAF could look into
developing a similar forum for this use.  Just a thought.

Ciao,
Gary

I have been participating on listservs for many years, although I am new
to this one.  My observation is that activity drops like a stone in the
summer, and that by July, things are virtually dead on almost every
forum I participate on.  By early August, there is usually a post
asking, &quot;Is anyone even out there?&quot; or &quot;Why is the list so dead?&quot;  And
while many of the forums on which I participate have a global reach, it
is summer in the northern hemisphere that seems to guide the level of
activity.

If the desire to create new means of communicating is based on the need
for new means of communicating, great.  If it is based on the lack of
activity for the past few months, my suggestion would be to wait to see
if activity picks up when folks come back to a more normal, non-summer mode.

Hello everyone,

I'm one of the lurkers. In fact this is the first time I've posted.

I'm relatively new to facilitation and just received my first renewal notice as an IAF member.

I value this listserve, find many of the conversations of interest, and appreciate the many gems of insight and experience that help deepen how I think about facilitation and will make me a better practitioner. Though I've been silent, I do feel this to be a community and consider myself a member. In fact, my first metaphor upon coming across the IAF was that at last I'd found the other swans. :)

Thus far when I've had a particular question, my first resources have been local mentorship and the Methods Database. As I've found rich responses to my queries through both, I've not had any questions for you yet. But I will not hesitate to ask when I do. Nor respond to other queries and comments should I have an insight I think would be additive.

I can see where more robust technology might help us and I want to learn how technology can best serve me as a facilitator. As I'm really time constrained and a bit technologically challenged, I appreciate hearing what technologies others are finding useful and ways they are being applied. I agree with Bill Harris' comment from yesterday:

&quot;Sandy does indeed do a great job at this, as has been noted. While I
like experimentation, I'd be /strongly/ inclined not to split off
GRP-FACL into separate Web 2.0 tools. I'd much rather wait a bit
until the University at Albany's systems are ready and Sandy can put
together a system that could have longevity, if it turns out to be
useful.&quot;

The simplicity of the listserve works for me. Though there are times I can't keep up with individual posts, I prefer them to digest as other groups I've gone to digest on, I've tended to become disengaged and fall away from.

Thanks to all of you who are active on the list.

I look forward to opportunities to meet many of you in person.

Best regards,

Kristin Patton

I am looking for online communities engaged in 'serious' dialog or

policy issues, either with or without facilitation or moderation.

Can anyone here point me toward such resources?

I am especially interested in six main ecosystem types: freshwaters,
farmlands, grasslands, forests, coasts/oceans, and urban/suburban.

Thank you.

While Hildy's observation may be true in general, in some years
we have seen some very high volumes of posts in July and August,
as well as some low-volume years. Below are the statistics for
the median number of posts, by month, June 1996 to date.

Jan     165
Feb     209
Mar     238
Apr     199
May     161
Jun     159
Jul     234
Aug     184
Sep     151
Oct     143
Nov     125
Dec     129

In addition you can see several grp-facl graphs showing listerv
data at http://www.albany.edu/cpr/gf/listserv-data/ (last updated
August 2005).

&gt; I have been participating on listservs for many years, although
&gt; I am new to this one.  My observation is that activity drops
&gt; like a stone in the summer, and that by July, things are
&gt; virtually dead on almost every forum I participate on.  By
&gt; early August, there is usually a post asking, &quot;Is anyone even
&gt; out there?&quot; or &quot;Why is the list so dead?&quot;  And while many of
&gt; the forums on which I participate have a global reach, it is
&gt; summer in the northern hemisphere that seems to guide the level
&gt; of activity.

&gt; If the desire to create new means of communicating is based on
&gt; the need for new means of communicating, great.  If it is based
&gt; on the lack of activity for the past few months, my suggestion
&gt; would be to wait to see if activity picks up when folks come
&gt; back to a more normal, non-summer mode.

I think it is important to ask, what can we do (or not do) to
make it easier for people to join in the conversation?

Annamarie's comments suggest that one thing we can do is to reply
to messages, especially those from people who have not yet
established themselves in the group. And I suspect that public
replies, rather than private replies, are more effective in this
regard.

In a previous discussion on this topic, one of the suggestions
was to encourage others to respond and contribute to the
discussion. By way of contrast, some comments tend to be made in
a declarative style that tends to close discussion rather than
invite it. (Indeed, I can clearly see that many of my posts have
been made that way.) It was from that discussion that Ned Ruete
developed his signature closing line, &quot;What do others think?&quot;

And, as previously mentioned, Dutch Driver's &quot;Stupid Question
Friday&quot; opened the doors as well.

So perhaps there are some things we could do that would make
participation easier and help people become established in the
group -- even with the existing technology.

&quot;What do others think?&quot;

&gt; Just as in a room full of people, this list has an &quot;in group&quot;
&gt; and the rest of us - lurkers. There are about 20 or so people
&gt; who do all the talking - occasionally someone new pops up to
&gt; ask a question - but most of the time it's Jan, Robert, Sandor,
&gt; Jon, Loretta..... and those of us lurking can tell you know
&gt; each other but we're not part of the conversation.
&gt; Personally, I've put a toe in a few times - perhaps what I
&gt; offered (I tried looking back at the archives, but there's a
&gt; problem with getting there) was not provocative enough but
&gt; since there wasn't a response - I essentially stopped thinking
&gt; of joining conversations.

&gt; I wonder if there are other lurkers who share my experience?

I took a look at Gary's example, and aside from the specific
design of the user interface, it seems to be quite similar to the
web-based version of listserv, with the exception that the
grp-facl list is segmented by month:
http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/archives/grp-facl.html

It could be that some people would prefer to participate via the
web interface, which I generally have referred to as &quot;the
archives,&quot; but it seems it could also serve as what Gary
describes as a &quot;forum.&quot;

&gt; The one format that no one has suggested is a Forum.  These are

&gt; thousands of users at once.  They are cheap to set up and easy
&gt; to run.  If you want to view one, I have a facilitator forum
&gt; at:

&gt; I'm not suggesting that my forum replace this, but the IAF
&gt; could look into developing a similar forum for this use.  Just
&gt; a thought.
