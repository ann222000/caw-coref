ALL INDIA JAIN MINORITY FORUM

PRESS NOTE ON THE GUJARAT FREEDOM OF RELIGION BILL
CLASSIFYING JAINS AND BUDDHISTS AS HINDUS
---------------------------------------------
The amended Freedom of Religion Bill passed by the Gujarat Assembly
classifying Jains and Buddhists as Hindu is an unwarranted assault on
their distinct religious identity recognised by the Constitution
itselfIt would be best to quote what Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru assured
to a Jain delegation on the so-called ambiguity of Explanation II of
Article 25 of the Constitution of India.

On 25th January, 1950, a Jain delegation was led to the Prime Minister
Jawaharlal Nehru and other central leaders to draw their attention to
the anomalous position of the Jains under sub-clause (b) of Clause 2
of Article 25 and a petition was submitted. Jawaharlal Nehru clearly
assured the delegation that the Jains are not Hindus and on 31-1-1950,
his Principal Private Secretary, Mr.A.V. Pai wrote the following
letter (a copy of the letter is enclosed) in reply to the petition:

&quot;This Article merely makes a definition. This definition by enforcing
a specific consitutional arrangement circumscribes that rule. Likewise
you will note that this mentions not only Jains but also Buddhists and
Sikhs. It is clear that Buddhists are not Hindus and therefore there
need be no apprehension that the Jains are designated as Hindus. There
is no doubt that the Jains are a different religious community and
this accepted position is in no way affected by the Constitution.&quot;

In his Allahabad speech on 3rd September,1949, Jawaharlal Nehru said:

&quot;No doubt India had a vast majority of Hindus, but they could not
forget the fact that there are also minorities Moslems, Christians,
Parsis and Jains. If India was understood as a &quot;Hindu Rashtra &quot; it
meant that the minorities were not cent per cent citizens of te
country.&quot; (The Statesman, 5-9-1949)

It may be recalled that the Deputy Prime Minister of India, Sardar
Vallabhbhai Patel in his letter of 25th August,1946 addressed to Sir
Bhagchand Soni, President, All India Digamber Jain Mahashbha assured
the Jain Community not to be worried about their religious rights and
promised that &quot;in free India there would be no restrictions upon the
religious liberty of any Community and there need be no apprehensions
in this regards.&quot;

The National Minorities Commission arrived at their recommendation
that the Jain community be declared as a minority religious community.
It was in consideration of the following: 1)the relevant
constitutional provisions, 20 various judicial pronouncements, 3) the
fundamental differences in philosophy and beliefs (theism vs.atheism
principally) vis-a-vis Hinduism, and 4) the substantial number of Jain
population in the country, resolved to recommend to the Government of
India that the Jains deserve to be recognised as a distinct religious
minority, and that, therefore the Government of India may consider
including them in the listing of &quot;Minorities&quot; in their Notification
dated 23-10-1993. This recommendation was issued on 3-10-1994.

So far Jains have been declared as a minority in Maharashtra, (which
has the largest population of Jains in India) Karnataka, Madhya
Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttara Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and
Uttaranchala. Dakshin Bharat Jain Sabha and the All India Jain
Minority Forum are pursuing the issue of national minority status for
Jains in the Supreme Court of India

Lokmanya Tilak said: &quot;In ancient times innumerable animals were
butchered in sacrifice. But the credit for the disappearance of this
terrible massacre from the Brahmanical religion goes to the share of
Jainism.&quot; (Bombay Samachar, 10-12-1904)

Thus it would be appropriate instead of saying that the Jains
assimilated the so-called Hindu culture or customs, because there was
nothing was known as Hindu in Vedic times, the Hindus of the modern
India have adopted the Jain culture . It is significant to note that
the Jains do not believe in the most characteristic Hindu-Vedic-
Brahmanic ritual Shraddha

It is important to note in the foregoing context that in the pre-
independence period a decision in the erstwhile Madras High Court:

The acting Chief Justice Kumar Swami Shastri held in Getappa vs.
Eramma &amp; Others (AIR 1927);

&quot;Were matters res integra, I would be inclined to hold that modern
research has shown that the Jains are not Hindu dissenters but that
Jainism has an origin and history long anterior to the Smritis and
Commentaries which are recognized authorities on Hindu law and usage.
The Jain religion refers to a number of previous Tirthankaras and
there can be little doubt that Jainism asa distinct religion was
flourishing several centuries before Christ. In fact, Jainism rejects
the authority of the Vedas which form the bed rock of Hinduism and
denies the efficacy of the various ceremonies which Hindus consider
essential. So far as Jain Law is concerned it has its own Law books of
which Bhadrabahu Samhita is an important one. Vardhamana Neeti and
Aradhana Neeti by the great Jain teacher Hemchandra deal also with
Jain Law.&quot;

Mr. Justice Rangnekar of the Bombay High Court observed in the
Hirachand Gangji vs. Rowji Sejpal (AIR 1939, Bombay 377) :

&quot;It is true that the Jains reject the scriptural character of the
Vedas and repudiate the Brahmanical doctrines relating to obsequial
ceremonies, the performance of Sraddhas and offering of oblations for
the salvation of the soul of the deceased. Amongst them there is no
belief that a son by birth or adoption confers spiritual benefit
Hindus in their conduct towards the dead, omitting all obsequies after
the corpse is burnt or buried. Now it is true, as later historical
researches have shown that Jainism prevailed in this country long
before Brahmanism came into existence or converted into Hinduism. It
is also true that owing to their long association with the Hindus, who
formed the majority in the country, the Jains have adopted many of the
customs and even ceremonies strictly observed by the Hindus and
pertaining to Brahmanical religion.&quot;

It is pertinent to note that Hinduism under Article 25 and in the
Hindu Code bills later passed in 1954/55 when Dr.Ambedkar was the law
minister are two different things although having a generic connection
on the definition of Hindu in the Personal Laws well explained by
Prof..Mahmood a former chairman of the National Commission for
Minorities in (Religious Identity, Beliefs and Practices under the
Indian Legal System,) article in Religion and Law Review June 1999

As Prof. Mahmood, a former Chairman of the National Commission for
Minorities has unequivocally noted &quot;Hinduism is not the state religion
of India. The Constitution of India does not confer on Hinduism the
status of even privileged or favoured religion. It does, however,
refer to Hinduism in different contexts.&quot;6 The Bombay Public Trust Act
1950 says that in its provisions &quot;Hindu&quot; includes Jain, Buddhist and
Sikh. In the Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments Act, 1969 &quot;Hindu
religion&quot; includes Jain, Buddhist and Sikh religions. Under the Madras
Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Act 1959 the expression
&quot;Hindu&quot; does not include Jains, unless the Act is specifically
extended to the Jains.

As is clear, these laws speak only of whether their provisions -
primarily meant for Hindus - would apply to the Buddhists, Jains and
Sikhs (on which point they are not uniform). &quot;They do not furnish and
answer to the question who is a Hindu by religion. Most certainly they
do not, and indeed cannot, mean to say that Buddhists, Jains or Sikhs
are Hindu&quot; (emphasis added.).

The Personal law Acts, The Hindu Marriage Act 1955, the Hindu
Succession Act 1956, the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act 1956 and
the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act 1956, all apply to Hindus,
Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs - as is declared by their opening
provisions. All the four Acts clarify that :

&quot;The expression 'Hindu' in any portion of this Act shall be construed
as if it included a person who, though not a Hindu by religion, is
nevertheless a person to whom this Act applies by virtue of the
provisions contained in this section.&quot;

Clearly, this is a rule of interpretation which cannot, by any dint of
imagination be treated as a definition of the word &quot;Hindu&quot; in general.
Nor can it ever be stretched to claim that in law Hinduism, Buddhism,
Jainism and Sikhism are one and the same religion. It is necessary to
differentiate between &quot;Hindu by religion&quot; and &quot;Hindu for the purpose
of application of laws&quot; - the latter expression referring to those non-
Hindus who share with Hindus certain laws. This is true of the so-
called &quot;definition&quot; of the expression 'Hindu' in Article 25 of the
Constitution as well as of the same in the Hindu-law Acts of 1955-56
and the legislation relating to Hindu religious endowments.

Thus, the provision of Explanation II in Article 25 has no religious
connotation. Instead of saying the same thing four times of four
different religious communities - Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs -
Article 25 (2)(b) says it once, for the Hindus, and then adds that the
same provision be read in the Constitution for three other communities
as well - the Buddhists, the Jains and the Sikhs. Makers of the
Constitution did not intend to merge the Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs
into the Hindu religion; nor were they indeed competent to do so.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism remain, under the Constitution
and the law of India, four different faiths; and their followers four
different religious communities.&quot;

In the latest Supreme Court Appeal (Civil) 9595 of 2003: Petitioner:
Committee of Management Kanya Junior High School Bal Vidya Mandir,
Etah, U.P. Respondent: Sachiv, U.P. Basic Shiksha Parishad Allahabad,
U.P. &amp; Others, Date of Judgment: 21/08/2006

The Division Bench of S. B. SINHA &amp; DALVEER BHANDARI and the Judgment
delivered by Justice Dalveer Bhandai states:

&quot;The Founding Fathers of the Constitution had unequivocally recognized
the Jains as a minority community as is evident from the proceedings
of the Constituent Assembly. While keeping in view that the Jains are
a minority community, a representative of the Jain community was taken
in the Minority Advisory Committee of the Constituent Assembly.&quot;

&quot;Jain religion indisputably is not a part of Hindu religion. The
question as to whether the Jains are part of the Hindu religion is not
open to debate. Jains have a right to establish and administer their
own institution. Jains have a right to establish and administer their
own institution. But, only because an institution is managed by a
person belonging to a particular religion, the same would not ipso
facto make the institution run and administered by a minority
community. A minority is determinable by reference to the demography
of a State. Whether an institution is established and administered by
a minority community or not may have to be determined by the
appropriate authority in terms of the provisions of the statute
governing the field. Furthermore, minority institutions are not immune
from the operations of the measures necessary to regulate their
functions. To what extent such regulations would operate, however,
again is a matter which would be governed by the statute.&quot;

Besides, the Jains, Buddhists and the Sikhs have been counted as
religious denominations right from the first Census in India in 1873
under the Indian Census Act.

In view of the foregoing evidence the proposed Bill of Freedom of
Religion as passed by the Gujarat Assembly is clearly a violation of
the constitutional religious identity of the Jains and Buddhists.
Gujarat Government MUST WITHDRAW this draconian Freedom of Religion
Bill immediately and unconditionally.CHAKRESH JAIN
