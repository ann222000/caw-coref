2 May 1981: His Royal Highness Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, visited the
ship at Norfolk.

26-28 May 1981: During work ups off the eastern Florida coast Aircraft No.
CY 610, an EA-6B (BuNo 159910), 1st LT Steve E. White, USMC, CAPT Elwood M.
Armstrong, Jr., USMC, and 1st LT Lawrence D. Cragun, USMC (Marine Tactical
Electronics Warfare Squadron (VMAQ)-2 Det Y), crashed on the flight deck,
starboard side. A moderate breeze touched the night, and the ship steered
160º at five knots, reaching 30º29'3"N, 080º22'0"W, during the second dog
watch on Tuesday the 26th. A particularly dark night with thin clouds above,
no visible horizon, heavy haze at lower altitude and thunderstorms moving
toward Nimitz produced problems for aircrew in the landing cycle. Suddenly,
the landing signal officer shouted, "Power! Power!" as 610 dropped too low
while landing at 2351. The Prowler hit the ship and its impact sheared off
the top of the aircraft. The EA-6B slammed into three Corsair IIs spotted
forward and then hurtled into a nearby Tomcat, pushing it into two adjacent
F-14As. The EA-6B exploded near aircraft loaded with live ordnance, killing
the crew and sending a "fireball" rolling across the flight deck and cooking
off 20 mm ammunition, which spewed fragments into the men on deck. Sailors
bravely plied hoses onto the inferno as CAPT Batzler ordered left 30º rudder
and brought the ship about 90º to come out of the wind, forcing smoke away
from the hose teams. A secondary explosion erupted at 0021 near catapult No.
2, probably caused by an AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile. The fire blazed
into the mid watch and at one point caused the ship to lose steerageway,
though her crew regained control of Nimitz, battling the flames until 0219.
The fire fouled the flight deck and forced about a dozen aircraft aloft to
emergency divert ashore to Charleston, S.C., before they ran out of fuel.
Destroyer Moosbrugger (DD-980) manned her pilot rescue detail, and her helo
joined two from Nimitz to search throughout the night for survivors,
although they only recovered some aircraft wreckage. Moosbrugger also
refueled one of the carrier's helos during the ordeal, and all three helo
aircrew "performed superbly," including at least one that landed on Nimitz's
fantail at the edge of the wind envelope during the height of the fire, a
dangerous maneuver which observers said could not be done under the
circumstances-until sailors persevered to aid their shipmates. Nimitz passed
through several rainstorms through the nightmare, however, the merits of
avoiding increased wind over the deck offset difficulties imposed by the
rain and the captain chose to keep way to reduce wind interference. Initial
reports, which proved to be erroneous, indicated that some men were blown
over the side. In addition to the three marines on board 610, ABH3 Robert W.
Iser, FN Dennis R. Driscoll, AA Thomas E. Barnhart, AA Frank J. Swider, Jr.,
AR Peter R. Iannetti and AR Jackie L. Gothard from the ship's company,
together with AO3 Lewis J. McLaurin (VF-41), AN Alberto Colon (VF-84), AN
Arthuro Hinojosa, Jr. (VF-84), and AN Patrick D. Louis and AEAN Ronald L.
Wildermuth (VF-41) died. The tragedy injured a further 48 sailors and
marines. The ship's medical department treated casualties, evacuating 21 of
the more critically hurt to the Navy Regional Medical Center at
Jacksonville, Fla., which issued a "total recall" of all staff to respond to
the emergency. Four of the most severely burned men went on to the burn unit
at Brooke Army Medical Center at San Antonio, Texas. The fire destroyed
three Tomcats and 610, and damaged two Tomcats, nine Corsair IIs, one
Intruder, three Vikings and one Sea King. The Naval Air Rework Facility at
Jacksonville assisted with repairing eight A-7Es damaged by the fire, one of
which was so badly damaged that it needed to be taken to the facility. The
Navy determined that a combination of "environmental, mechanical and human
factors" caused 610's loss, and recommended a zealous anti drug program that
became known as "zero tolerance." Nimitz returned to Pier 12 at Norfolk
during the afternoon watch on the 28th to repair damaged catapults, getting
underway for additional training two days later.
