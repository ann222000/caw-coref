It's a tried-and-tested torture technique: strike fear into your
victims,deprive them of cherished essentials and then eradicate their
memories. In2003, the US applied this on an enormous scale for its
invasion of Iraq. Andthen, after Saddam's regime crumbled, Washington
set out to rebuild thetraumatised country through a disastrous
programme of privatisation andunfettered capitalism, as Naomi Klein
shows in this exclusive extract from hernew book  Tuesday September
11, 2007The Guardian   When the Canadian citizen Maher Arar was
grabbed by US agents at JFK airport in2002 and taken to Syria, a
victim of extraordinary rendition, his interrogatorsengaged in a tried-
and-tested torture technique. &quot;They put me on a chair, andone of the
men started asking me questions ... If I did not answer quicklyenough,
he would point to a metal chair in the corner and ask, 'Do you want
meto use this?' I was terrified, and I did not want to be tortured. I
would sayanything to avoid torture.&quot; The technique Arar was being
subjected to is knownas &quot;the showing of the instruments,&quot; or, in US
military lingo, &quot;fear up&quot;.Torturers know that one of their most potent
weapons is the prisoner's ownimagination - often just showing fearsome
instruments is more effective thanusing them.

As the day of the invasion of Iraq drew closer, US news media outlets
wereconscripted by the Pentagon to &quot;fear up&quot; Iraq. &quot;They're calling it
'A-Day',&quot;began a report on CBS News that aired two months before the
war began. &quot;A as inairstrikes so devastating they would leave Saddam's
soldiers unable orunwilling to fight.&quot; Viewers were introduced to
Harlan Ullman, an author of theShock and Awe doctrine, who explained
that &quot;you have this simultaneous effect,rather like the nuclear
weapons at Hiroshima, not taking days or weeks but inminutes&quot;. The
anchor, Dan Rather, ended the telecast with a disclaimer: &quot;Weassure
you this report contains no information that the Defense
Departmentthinks could help the Iraqi military.&quot; He could have gone
further: the report,like so many others in this period, was an
integral part of the Department ofDefense's strategy - fear up.Iraqis,
who picked up the terrifying reports on contraband satellites or
inphone calls from relatives abroad, spent months imagining the
horrors of Shockand Awe. The phrase itself became a potent
psychological weapon. Would it beworse than 1991? If the Americans
really thought Saddam had weapons of massdestruction, would they
launch a nuclear attack? One answer was provided a week before the
invasion. The Pentagon invitedWashington's military press corps on a
special field trip to Eglin Air ForceBase in Florida to witness the
testing of the Moab, which officially stands forMassive Ordnance Air
Blast, but which everyone in the military calls the&quot;Mother of All
Bombs&quot;. At 21,000lb, it is the largest non-nuclear explosiveever
built, able to create, in the words of CNN's Jamie McIntyre,
&quot;a10,000ft-high mushroom-like cloud that looks and feels like a
nuclear weapon&quot;. In his report, McIntyre said that even if it was
never used, the bomb's veryexistence &quot;could still pack a psychological
wallop&quot; - a tacit acknowledgementof the role he himself was playing in
delivering that wallop. Like prisoners ininterrogation cells, Iraqis
were being shown the instruments. &quot;The goal is tohave the capabilities
of the coalition so clear and so obvious that there's anenormous
disincentive for the Iraqi military to fight,&quot; Secretary of
DefenseDonald Rumsfeld explained on the same programme. When the war
began, the residents of Baghdad were subjected to sensorydeprivation
on a mass scale. One by one, the city's sensory inputs were cutoff;
the ears were the first to go. On the night of March 28 2003, as US
troops drew closer to Baghdad, theministry of communication was bombed
and set ablaze, as were four Baghdadtelephone exchanges, with massive
bunker-busters, cutting off millions ofphones across the city. The
targeting of the phone exchanges continued - 12 intotal - until, by
April 2, there was barely a phone working in all of Baghdad.During the
same assault, television and radio transmitters were also hit,making
it impossible for families in Baghdad, huddling in their homes, to
pickup even a weak signal carrying news of what was going on outside
their doors. Many Iraqis say that the shredding of their phone system
was the mostpsychologically wrenching part of the air attack. The
combination of hearingand feeling bombs going off everywhere while
being unable to call a few blocksaway to find out if loved ones were
alive, or to reassure terrified relativesliving abroad, was pure
torment. Journalists based in Baghdad were swarmed bydesperate local
residents begging for a few moments with their satellite phonesor
pressing numbers into the reporters' hands along with pleas to call
abrother or an uncle in London or Baltimore. &quot;Tell him everything is
OK. Tellhim his mother and father are fine. Tell him hello. Tell him
not to worry.&quot; Bythen, most pharmacies in Baghdad had sold out of
sleeping aids andanti-depressants, and the city was completely cleaned
out of Valium. Next to go were the eyes. &quot;There was no audible
explosion, no discerniblechange in the early-evening bombardments, but
in an instant, an entire city of5 million people was plunged into an
awful, endless night,&quot; the Guardianreported on April 4. Darkness was
&quot;relieved only by the headlights of passingcars&quot;. Trapped in their
homes, Baghdad's residents could not speak to eachother, hear each
other or see outside. Like a prisoner destined for a CIA blacksite,
the entire city was shackled and hooded. Next it was stripped. In
hostile interrogations, the first stage of breakingdown prisoners is
stripping them of their own clothes and any items that havethe power
to evoke their sense of self - so-called comfort items. Often
objectsthat are of particular value to a prisoner, such as the Qur'an
or a cherishedphotograph, are treated with open disrespect. The
message is &quot;You are no one,you are who we want you to be,&quot; the essence
of dehumanisation. Iraqis wentthrough this unmaking process
collectively, as they watched their mostimportant institutions
desecrated, their history loaded on to trucks anddisappeared. The
bombing badly injured Iraq, but it was the looting, unchecked by
occupyingtroops, that did the most to erase the heart of the country
that was. &quot;The hundreds of looters who smashed ancient ceramics,
stripped display casesand pocketed gold and other antiquities from the
National Museum of Iraqpillaged nothing less than records of the first
human society,&quot; reported theLos Angeles Times. &quot;Gone are 80% of the
museum's 170,000 priceless objects.&quot;The national library, which
contained copies of every book and doctoral thesisever published in
Iraq, was a blackened ruin. Thousand-year-old illuminatedQur'ans had
disappeared from the Ministry of Religious Affairs, which was lefta
burned-out shell. &quot;Our national heritage is lost,&quot; pronounced a
Baghdadhigh-school teacher. A local merchant said of the museum, &quot;It
was the soul ofIraq. If the museum doesn't recover the looted
treasures, I will feel like apart of my own soul has been stolen.&quot;
McGuire Gibson, an archaeologist at theUniversity of Chicago, called
it &quot;a lot like a lobotomy. The deep memory of anentire culture, a
culture that has continued for thousands of years, has beenremoved&quot;.
Thanks mostly to the efforts of clerics who organised salvage missions
in themidst of the looting, a portion of the artefacts has been
recovered. But manyIraqis were, and still are, convinced that the
memory lobotomy was intentional- part of Washington's plans to excise
the strong, rooted nation that was andreplace it with their own model.
&quot;Baghdad is the mother of Arab culture,&quot;70-year-old Ahmed Abdullah
told the Washington Post, &quot;and they want to wipe outour culture.&quot; As
the war planners were quick to point out, the looting was done by
Iraqis,not foreign troops. And it is true that Rumsfeld did not plan
for Iraq to besacked - but he did not take measures to prevent it from
happening either, orto stop it once it had begun. These were failures
that cannot be dismissed asmere oversights. During the 1991 Gulf war,
13 Iraqi museums were attacked by looters, so therewas every reason to
believe that poverty, anger at the old regime and thegeneral
atmosphere of chaos would prompt some Iraqis to respond in the same
way(especially given that Saddam had emptied the prisons several
months earlier).The Pentagon had been warned by leading archaeologists
that it needed to havean airtight strategy to protect museums and
libraries before any attack, and aMarch 26 Pentagon memo to coalition
command listed &quot;in order of importance, 16sites that were crucial to
protect in Baghdad&quot;. Second on the list was themuseum. Other warnings
had urged Rumsfeld to send an international policecontingent in with
the troops to maintain public order -another suggestion thatwas
ignored. Even without the police, however, there were enough US
soldiers in Baghdad fora few to be dispatched to the key cultural
sites, but they weren't sent. Thereare numerous reports of US soldiers
hanging out by their armoured vehicles andwatching as trucks loaded
with loot drove by - a reflection of the &quot;stuffhappens&quot; indifference
coming straight from Rumsfeld. Some units took it uponthemselves to
stop the looting, but in other instances, soldiers joined in.
TheBaghdad International Airport was completely trashed by soldiers
who, accordingto Time, smashed furniture and then moved on to the
commercial jets on therunway: &quot;US soldiers looking for comfortable
seats and souvenirs ripped outmany of the planes' fittings, slashed
seats, damaged cockpit equipment andpopped out every windshield.&quot; The
result was an estimated $100m worth of damageto Iraq's national
airline - which was one of the first assets to be put on theauction
block in an early and contentious partial privatisation. Some insight
into why there was so little official interest in stopping thelooting
has since been provided by two men who played pivotal roles in
theoccupation - Peter McPherson, the senior economic adviser to Paul
Bremer, andJohn Agresto, director of higher education reconstruction
for the occupation.McPherson said that when he saw Iraqis taking state
property - cars, buses,ministry equipment - it didn't bother him. His
job, as Iraq's top economicshock therapist, was to radically downsize
the state and privatise its assets,which meant that the looters were
really just giving him a jump-start. &quot;Ithought the privatisation that
occurs sort of naturally when somebody took overtheir state vehicle,
or began to drive a truck that the state used to own, wasjust fine,&quot;
he said. A veteran bureaucrat of the Reagan administration and afirm
believer in Chicago School economics, McPherson termed the pillage a
formof public-sector &quot;shrinkage&quot;. His colleague John Agresto also saw
a silver lining as he watched the lootingof Baghdad on TV. He
envisioned his job - &quot;a never-to-be-repeated adventure&quot; -as the
remaking of Iraq's system of higher education from scratch. In
thatcontext, the stripping of the universities and the education
ministry was, heexplained, &quot;the opportunity for a clean start,&quot; a
chance to give Iraq's schools&quot;the best modern equipment&quot;. If the
mission was &quot;nation creating,&quot; as so manyclearly believed it to be,
then everything that remained of the old country wasonly going to get
in the way. Agresto was the former president of St John'sCollege in
New Mexico, which specialises in a Great Books curriculum
[whichemphasises an education based on broad reading]. He explained
that although heknew nothing of Iraq, he had refrained from reading
books about the countrybefore making the trip so that he would arrive
&quot;with as open a mind as I couldhave&quot;. Like Iraq's colleges, Agresto
would be a blank slate. If Agresto had read a book or two, he might
have thought twice about the needto erase everything and start all
over again. He could have learned, forinstance, that before the
sanctions strangled the country, Iraq had the besteducation system in
the region, with the highest literacy rates in the Arabworld - in
1985, 89% of Iraqis were literate. By contrast, in Agresto's homestate
of New Mexico, 46% of the population is functionally illiterate, and
20%are unable do &quot;basic math[s] to determine the total on a sales
receipt&quot;. YetAgresto was so convinced of the superiority of American
systems that he seemedunable to entertain the possibility that Iraqis
might want to salvage andprotect their own culture and that they might
feel its destruction as awrenching loss. This neo-colonialist
blindness is a running theme in the war on terror. At theUS-run prison
at Guantánamo Bay, there is a room known as &quot;the love shack&quot;.Detainees
are taken there after their captors have decided they are not
enemycombatants and will soon be released. Inside the love shack,
prisoners areallowed to watch Hollywood movies and are plied with
American junk food. AsifIqbal, one of three British detainees known as
the &quot;Tipton Three,&quot; waspermitted several visits there before he and
his two friends were finally senthome. &quot;We would get to watch DVDs,
eat McDonald's, eat Pizza Hut and basicallychill out. We were not
shackled in this area ... We had no idea why they werebeing like that
to us. The rest of the week we were back in the cages as usual... On
one occasion Lesley [an FBI official] brought Pringles, ice cream
andchocolates; this was the final Sunday before we came back to
England.&quot; Hisfriend Rhuhel Ahmed speculated that the special treatment
&quot;was because theyknew they had messed us about and tortured us for two
and half years and theyhoped we would forget it&quot;. Ahmed and Iqbal had
been grabbed by the Northern Alliance while visitingAfghanistan on
their way to a wedding. They had been violently beaten, injectedwith
unidentified drugs, put in stress positions for hours, sleep
deprived,forcibly shaven and denied all legal rights for 29 months.
And yet they weresupposed to &quot;forget it&quot; in the face of the
overwhelming allure of Pringles.That was actually the plan. It's hard
to believe - but then again, that was pretty much Washington's
gameplan for Iraq: shock and terrorise the entire country,
deliberately ruin itsinfrastructure, do nothing while its culture and
history are ransacked, thenmake it all OK with an unlimited supply of
cheap household appliances andimported junk food. In Iraq, this cycle
of culture erasing and culturereplacing was not theoretical; it all
unfolded in a matter of weeks. Paul Bremer, appointed by Bush to serve
as director of the occupation authorityin Iraq, admits that when he
first arrived in Baghdad, the looting was stillgoing strong and order
was far from restored. &quot;Baghdad was on fire, literally,as I drove in
from the airport. There was no traffic on the streets; there wasno
electricity anywhere; no oil production; no economic activity; there
wasn'ta single policeman on duty anywhere.&quot; And yet his solution to
this crisis wasto immediately fling open the country's borders to
absolutely unrestrictedimports: no tariffs, no duties, no inspections,
no taxes. Iraq, Bremer declaredtwo weeks after he arrived, was &quot;open
for business&quot;. Overnight, Iraq went frombeing one of the most isolated
countries in the world, sealed off from the mostbasic trade by strict
UN sanctions, to becoming the widest-open marketanywhere. While the
pickup trucks stuffed with loot were still being driven to buyers
inJordan, Syria and Iran, passing them in the opposite direction were
convoys offlatbeds piled high with Chinese TVs, Hollywood DVDs and
Jordanian satellitedishes, ready to be unloaded on the sidewalks of
Baghdad's Karada district.Just as one culture was being burned and
stripped for parts, another waspouring in, prepackaged, to replace it.
One of the US businesses ready and waiting to be the gateway to this
experimentin frontier capitalism was New Bridge Strategies, started by
Joe Allbaugh,Bush's ex-head of Fema [Federal Emergency Management
Agency]. It promised touse its top-level political connections to help
US multinationals land a pieceof the action in Iraq. &quot;Getting the
rights to distribute Procter &amp; Gambleproducts would be a gold mine,&quot;
one of the company's partners enthused. &quot;Onewell-stocked 7-Eleven
could knock out 30 Iraqi stores; a Wal-Mart could takeover the
country.&quot; Like the prisoners in Guantánamo's love shack, all of Iraq
was going to bebought off with Pringles and pop culture - that, at
least, was the Bushadministration's idea of a postwar plan. Ewen
Cameron was a psychiatrist who performed CIA-funded experiments on
theeffects of electric shock and sensory deprivation on patients,
without theirknowledge, in the 1950s. When I was researching what he
did I came across anobservation made by one of his colleagues, a
psychiatrist named Fred Lowy. &quot;TheFreudians had developed all these
subtle methods of peeling the onion to get atthe heart of the
problem,&quot; he said. &quot;Cameron wanted to drill right through andto hell
with the layers. But, as we later discovered, the layers are all
thereis.&quot; Cameron thought he could blast away all his patients' layers
and startagain; he dreamed of creating brand-new personalities. But
his patients weren'treborn: they were confused, injured, broken.
Iraq's shock therapists blasted away at the layers too, seeking that
elusiveblank slate on which to create their new model country. They
found only thepiles of rubble that they themselves had created, and
millions ofpsychologically and physically shattered people - shattered
by Saddam,shattered by war, shattered by one another. Bush's in-house
disastercapitalists didn't wipe Iraq clean, they just stirred it up.
Rather than atabula rasa, purified of history, they found ancient
feuds, brought to thesurface to merge with fresh vendettas from each
new attack - on a mosque inKarbala, in Samarra, on a market, a
ministry, a hospital. Countries, likepeople, don't reboot to zero with
a good shock; they just break and keep onbreaking. Which, of course,
requires more blasting - upping the dosage, holding down thebutton
longer, more pain, more bombs, more torture. Former deputy secretary
ofstate Richard Armitage, who had predicted that Iraqis would be
easilymarshalled from A to B, has since concluded that the real
problem was that theUS was too soft. &quot;The humane way in which the
coalition fought the war,&quot; hesaid, &quot;actually has led to a situation
where it is more difficult to get peopleto come together, not less. In
Germany and Japan [after the second world war],the population was
exhausted and deeply shocked by what had happened, but inIraq it's
been the opposite. A very rapid victory over enemy forces has
meantwe've not had the cowed population we had in Japan and
Germany ... The US isdealing with an Iraqi population that is un-
shocked and un-awed.&quot; By January2007, Bush and his advisers were still
convinced that they could gain controlof Iraq with one good &quot;surge&quot;.
The report on which the surge strategy was basedaimed for &quot;the
successful clearing of central Baghdad&quot;. In the 70s, when the
corporatist crusade began, it used tactics that courtsruled were
overtly genocidal: the deliberate erasure of a segment of
thepopulation. In Iraq, something even more monstrous has happened -
the erasurenot of a segment of the population, but of an entire
country; Iraq isdisappearing, disintegrating. It began, as it often
does, with thedisappearance of women behind veils and doors, then the
children disappearedfrom the schools - as of 2006, two-thirds of them
stayed home. Next came theprofessionals: doctors, professors,
entrepreneurs, scientists, pharmacists,judges, lawyers. An estimated
300 Iraqi academics have been assassinated bydeath squads since the US
invasion, including several deans of departments;thousands more have
fled. Doctors have fared even worse: by February 2007, anestimated
2,000 had been killed and 12,000 had fled. In November 2006, the
UNHigh Commission for Refugees estimated that 3,000 Iraqis were
fleeing thecountry every day. By April 2007, the organisation reported
that 4 millionpeople had been forced to leave their homes - roughly
one in seven Iraqis. Onlya few hundred of those refugees had been
welcomed into the United States. With Iraqi industry all but
collapsed, one of the only local businesses boomingis kidnapping. Over
just three and a half months in early 2006, nearly 20,000people were
kidnapped in Iraq. The only time the international media paysattention
is when a westerner is taken, but the vast majority of abductions
areIraqi professionals, grabbed as they travel to and from work. Their
familieseither come up with tens of thousands in US dollars for the
ransom money oridentify their bodies at the morgue. Torture has also
emerged as a thrivingindustry. Human rights groups have documented
numerous cases of Iraqi policedemanding thousands of dollars from the
families of prisoners in exchange for ahalt to torture. It is Iraq's
own domestic version of disaster capitalism. This was not what the
Bush administration intended for Iraq when it wasselected as the model
nation for the rest of the Arab world. The occupation hadbegun with
cheerful talk of clean slates and fresh starts. It didn't take
long,however, for the quest for cleanliness to slip into talk into
&quot;pulling Islamismup from the root&quot; in Sadr City or Najaf and removing
&quot;the cancer of radicalIslam&quot; from Fallujah and Ramadi - what was not
clean would be scrubbed out byforce. That is what happens with
projects to build model societies in other people'scountries. The
cleansing campaigns are rarely premeditated. It is only when thepeople
who live on the land refuse to abandon their past that the dream of
theclean slate morphs into its doppelgänger, the scorched earth - only
then thatthe dream of total creation morphs into a campaign of total
destruction. The unanticipated violence that now engulfs Iraq is the
creation of thelethally optimistic architects of the war - it was
preordained in that originalseemingly innocuous, even idealistic
phrase, &quot;a model for a new Middle East&quot;.The disintegration of Iraq has
its roots in the ideology that demanded a tabularasa on which to write
its new story. And when no such pristine tableaupresented itself, the
supporter of that ideology proceeded to blast and surgeand blast again
in the hope of reaching that promised land. · Extracted from: The
