Andy, Tony, D, Gary, Bert, Rick,

Nice ride today. We rode controlled, which, has not always been a Gyros
trait. 16-17 usually meant 18-19 (I was as guilty as anyone for this). It makes the
decision to do an announced ride much easier if we know for sure that the
ride will be just what it claims to be.

A controlled 16-17 on Sundays sounds like a great idea for every Sunday. This
means that we can ride hard and/or long on Saturday knowing that there will
be a recovery ride on Sunday, and, it will be exactly that - a recovery ride.

I would also like to return to Saturday rides as they have always been:
announced by Thursday, and, manifested on Saturday. Every Saturday, weather
permitting. We want all Gyros to know that it is a hard and fast club rule that we
ALWAYS have a group ride on Saturday. I cannot believe that with the growth of
our club recently that there are not at least 8-12 club members looking forward
to a ride on Saturdays. I truly believe that there are more than this, we
just need to have a firm time/distance/route announced by Thursday, at the very
latest. Just my opinion, mind you.

Tony, I think that you had mentioned that you would not be able to lead the
Saturday ride this weekend. If this is the case, than I would be glad to be the
ride leader; or, at least one of them. Let me know.

Rick I.

PS. I liked that route today. Could Tony or Bert provide a written course
map? I would appreciate it.

Guys,

Sorry I missed you today. I had a little trouble finding Tony's house,
and didn't give myself enough time to get there. I showed up there around
9:20. At least now I know where it is. :-) . It was definitely a great day
to ride.

Brian

Rick,

It was an excellent ride today. Perfect pace for getting in some
exercise and some good conversation. As you know, I always post
Saturday rides by Thursday of each week, with a few exceptions. Lately
though, with soccer games, it has been difficult for me to lead these
rides. Therefore, any one like yourself who is willing to step in to
lead these rides would be greatly appreciated. A wise man once told me
that leading the rides EVERY weekend is a lot of pressure and I didn't
realize just how much pressure there is until I got involved in doing
this every weekend. That wise man was Jim Adams. Don't get me wrong,
though. I thoroughly enjoy it! Anything I can do to get Gyros up for
a ride, as long as no one has any complaints, is fine with me. This is
a good time to thank those who have stepped in for me in the past and
who CONTINUE to take over in my absence. That would be you, Gary, Bert
and Mike V.

I like your idea about riding on Saturday and Sunday but, for me, my
family schedule only allows me to ride either day. I don't think we
ever really had huge turn outs for Sunday rides which is a shame because
there is less traffic on that day. I used to ride both days in years
past but it was just too much so I had to cut back. Lately, Sunday has
been my day to ride because of kid's soccer games. Next spring will
bring on the same dilemma when games start up again. After this coming
weekend, I may alternate between riding Saturday or Sunday. I am, of
course, speaking only for myself.

So please, by all means, take over as ride leader on Saturday so that
the Gyros, who typically rely on Saturday for their &quot;long&quot; ride, can
still do so.
I will send you today's cue sheet once I figure out the names of some of
the roads we were on.

Thanks, Tony

Tony,

I did not mean to imply that you have not been very good about posting rides
each Thursday. You have. I am sorry if it sounded that way because no-one
appreciates the job you have done for our club more than I do. I should have
chosen my wording a bit more carefully.

But, it has become quite obvious that the club relies heavily upon you. Case
in point: the past 2 weeks you have been unable to lead the Saturday rides,
but announced that you would be riding on Sunday instead. Look what
happens...your ride on Sunday is better attended than the Saturday ride! And, we come
right to your house! That is how much respect we have for you. (None of us mind
coming to your place to ride...it is a great location.)

All that I was suggesting is that if you are unable to lead the ride it
should not fall by the wayside. Like yesterday. If there isn't anything firmed up
by Thursday we begin to make other plans. You gave plenty of notice, as you
always do, and I did attempt to salvage something, but, it was too little too
late. I know that I rode solo as did Bert. I am sure others did, also.

I want to help where I can, and there should be others in the club to lead
rides in your absence. But, you are the main ride leader! I am sure we all feel
that way. Besides, they are not likely to follow me as they do you....or
Jim....or Bert.

D,

Thanks, buddy. You were very quiet on the ride...choosing to stay at the
front for most of the ride.

There are a number of reasons why one is so quiet on a recovery ride: 1. They
are in a contemplative mood. 2. The company that they are keeping do not
possess the cognitive skills to engage in intelligent conversation, so, might as
well keep to oneself. 3. They decided to focus on nature. 4. This is just the
way they like to ride, so mind your own business.

Nice riding with you, as always.

Rick

Rick,

I was not offended at all and I welcome &quot;strong&quot; leaders to step in and
take over just for that very reason - so the club isn't relying on me
all the time. It'll work out. I think you can call it growing pains.
I don't want to see Gyros giving up a Saturday ride because a few of us
don't show.

Anyway, see ya on the road next weekend. It's dark already and it feels
like 9pm instead of 6pm. YUCK!

Tony

i was at PUE at 9am on saturday and i sent the google alert ahead of
time saying i would be there. no one showed. did it bother me? noooo
... i knew there was the halloween ride in durham and besides, it was
cold outside! i was happy to go home and wait for the temp to jump some
before getting on my bike.

it is fun to ride with the gyro group (no matter how many show) and it
was my understanding the group rides happen on saturday (tony or no
tony), not sunday, morning. i was not aware of any dependence on tony
as a leader for a saturday ride to evolve, but then i am a newbie.

by the way norwood road is open. the bridge is fixed, raised about 20
feet ... really nice!

Maria,

I apologize no one else showed up.

When Tony is not available someone else will organize the ride. I was out
of town and perhaps the others were tied up. We will continue to ride on
Saturday mornings and will post the ride information on Thursday. Usually
anyway. :)

I think that everyone who shows on Saturday can certainly take care of
themselves whether I am there or not, obviously. BTW, Sunday's are
really not a scheduled ride, as Maria stated. All I was doing is
telling the group that I could not ride on Saturday so I will ride
Sunday and anyone who wants to join me can. Saturday's will continue to
be the scheduled Gyros ride.

I also failed to mention and give credit to others who have stepped in
to lead rides. Those are Fernando, Keil, Andy and Jim. (Jim - It was
good to see you getting back to joining us again. Hope that
continues). So there are plenty of leaders to go around.

Nuff said. Try to ride this week if you all can. It is going to be
glorious weather.

Thanks, Tony
