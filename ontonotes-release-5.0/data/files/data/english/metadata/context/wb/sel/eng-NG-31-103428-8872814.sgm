Every once in awhile, if you consume enough media, you'll come across a
real gem of an article.Gary Taubes writes about how exercise doesn't
make you thinner - and how that myth came to be:&quot;The Scientist and the
Stairmaster&quot;Ahh...the sweet taste of vindication. His insight might be
old-hat if you're already familiar with the research, but Mr. Taubes
truly puts it all together in a well-written, straightforward manner. A
summary of his key points:
- The research supporting the idea that exercising more (i.e., &quot;doing
more cardio&quot;) results in greater weight loss simply doesn't exist.
Upping your treadmill time from 30 to 60 minutes won't change a thing
on your waistline - but controlling calorie intake and insulin levels
will.
- We believe more exercise will help us lose more weight because of
cultural hypnosis and the seminal work of Dr. Jean Mayer, not because
the science actually says so.
- Lots of vigorous exercise makes you hungrier, so you eat more (and
offset the calories you burned via exercising). Lesser amounts and
intensities of exercise don't burn enough calories to make it
worthwhile (sounds familiar).This article gives a prime example of the
bias with which much of our fitness, health, and nutritional
information is filtered through, and why it's dangerous to
accept &quot;official guidelines&quot; and &quot;the latest scientific news&quot; at face
value. Even researchers who should know better act upon faith instead
of science:Steve Blair, for instance, a University of South Carolina
exercise scientist and a co-author of the AHA-ACSM guidelines, says he
was “short, fat, and bald” when he started running in his thirties and
he is short, fatter, and balder now, at age 68. In the intervening
years, he estimates, he has run close to 80,000 miles and gained about
30 pounds.
When I asked Blair whether he thought he might be leaner had he run
even more, he had to think about it. “I don’t see how I could have been
more active,” he said. “Thirty years ago, I was running 50 miles a
week. I had no time to do more. But if I could have gone out over the
last couple of decades for two to three hours a day, maybe I would not
have gained this weight.” (emphasis mine)WOW. Not only is Dr. Blair
ignoring the findings in the AHA-ACSM guidelines (which he
co-authored), he is willing to discount his personal experience. Now
that's what you can call a real &quot;faith-based initiative.&quot;(BTW, in case
you didn't know who Dr. Blair is, he is a renowned researcher
and &quot;guru&quot; of exercise science. The mere mention of his name elicits
oohs and aahs from exercise physiology departments in colleges and
universities all across the country. He's probably best known for the
ACLS (Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study), which is probably the
largest study aside from Framingham that looks at how lifestyle factors
like smoking and exercise affect mortality. Just in case the other 349
studies he published or co-authored caught your eye as well.)Just goes
to show you - you are your own best council. Take what you read with a
grain of salt (Celtic Sea Salt, preferably), even the stuff you read on
this blog. Don't stop at the headlines, look deeper. Check the actual
research, the actual science, and see what it says. The answers may
surprise you.The moral of the story: Don't look to exercise as a
panacea for your fat loss woes. Without proper nutritional habits,
you'll be getting nowhere fast with regards to fat loss (although
exercise will make you feel better, sleep better, live longer, etc.).
Sorry, you can't outrun a crappy diet.
