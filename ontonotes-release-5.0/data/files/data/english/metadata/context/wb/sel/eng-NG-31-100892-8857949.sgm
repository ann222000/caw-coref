As the heart beats its rhythm of life, we go about our daily chores of
living. Sorrow is felt upon the wind as it flows past our weathered
face, but we continue on our daily tasks, after all, we have felt his
wind for centuries and we have grown accustomed to its message.
Nothing can be done here. It is part of life.
We stretch our aching back worn down by years of hardship. With weary
eyes we scan the horizon for any signs of relief...we see none. The
cries of the fallen reverberate in our ears and no matter how hard we
try, the sounds never seem to go away. Tears fall like heavy rain and
our shoulders slump under their weight. The walls we have built out of
mortar and sand crumble at our feet and we cry &quot;no more&quot;.
We have had enough. We have had enough of the bloodshed. We have had
enough of the pain. A thought echo's in our mind that speaks of a new
beginning and that we are its creators. It is time. With strength we
knew not we had, our back straightens with a conviction of a billion
billion souls whose time has come.
We are the power of change. We are the power to bring peace, truth and
compassion into our lives. Our body tingles with life that has long
been dormant; our heart pumps strong and true with the power of
humanity beating as one. Humanity has the power to change if we wish
to change.
Once again our eyes scan the horizon and we see hope where once was
fear. Our body finds its strength from the countless men and women who
have come before us and gives us the courage to take that step towards
peace. Our heart instinctively knows the way. Deep down, we have
always known the way. We are coming home to peace. We are coming home
to a life long denied.
Today is that day. Today is the first step in a long climb to bring
hope to those who despair, compassion to those afflicted with the pain
of loss and integrity to those that have lost the light of truth.
Today is that day. We have reached a defining moment in our lives. It
is time. It is time to bring world peace upon this Earth.

Beautiful, but  for one &quot;trauma causative&quot; aspect.

You have described the journey of &quot;one&quot;. When that emerging view mutates
into the projected expectation on &quot;humanity&quot;, the conflict is perpetuated.
From Marks, to Ghandi, to Hitler. They all had great vision &quot;for others&quot;.

Think about it. If it was chronological for all, we wouldnt be able to read
of historical figures who had already found the bliss of existance.Why do
you think that many see religion (read also ideology) as the cause of most
world conflict? One group tries to either overpower or eradicate the
other.....to fight for peace, or as Ghandi espoused, via peaceful
resistance.

Enlightened ones dont try to elucidate by instruction,
Because they know the point and purpose of the road of disruption. They can
see how the disruption really comes about and why.

They may however write poetry or compose inspiring music.

The creative artist has the innate need to create. There's no need for
an appreciative audience.
Most of the world conflict is caused by the Levantine religions. There
are many others which have operated peacefully with each other for
millennia. Ghandi's vision worked with the Brits. It would not have
worked with the Nazis.

Nazi officers were concerned because SS troops were suffering what we
now call PTSD from shooting women &amp; kids, so they invented the gas
chambers so the troops would not have to watch people die. Solved the
problem.

&quot;Humanism features an optimistic attitude about the capacity of
people, but it does not involve believing that human nature is purely
good or that each and every person is capable of living up to the
Humanist ideals of rationality and morality. If anything, there is the
recognition that living up to one's potential is hard work and
requires the help of others. The ultimate goal is human flourishing;
making life better for all humans. The focus is on doing good and
living well in the here and now, and leaving the world better for
those who come after, not on suffering through life to be rewarded
afterward.&quot;

Well Dan, this was moving for the first few paragraphs.  It seemed you were
being successful in capturing something in articulation of the suffering
people withstand in this world.  Cudos on that.

But then you went into a diabtribe about world peace and a call for people
to change and all that...a diabribe that has been heard by every generation
since time immemorial perhaps.  Well, the world changes...evolves, that's
for sure...and in many ways, gets better I suppose.

Indeed, there is much suffering in this world.  There are two issues [among
others] that probably makes suffering non-retractable: 'over-population',
and 'scarce resources'.

But even if we were to overcome such issues, I always offer the idea that
most humans, at least in the first world, already live on the material level
that Kings and Queens did centuries ago.  Yet, the struggle [and suffering]
still continues on.  Few of us 'feel' like Kings or Queens, but more like
roadkill running from street pavers.  So, if the materials of life do not
make us happy...nor even content...then I ask 'what does'?

Has anyone noticed that Bowery Row is inhabited mostly by men?  That our
prisons are full of ...mostly men?
The simple minded might be tempted to make a gross judgment about 'men' from
such observation.  But I think the better question would be 'what is driving
men'?

Well, I always promise myself to write shorter comments on this NG...so I'll
cut to the chase.  I contend that 'human relations' make or break us...is
cause of our greatest suffering or the greatest joy.  If human relations are
healthy, we can withstand pestulence, desease, even war and our spirits not
too greatly damaged.  But if our human relations go sour, even a stubbed toe
might seem like hell.  So, there's your peace on earth if you want it.
Which has become 'piece' on earth I think, LOL.

Ah Turtoni...you judge humanity by your own unselfishness methinks.  As I've
observed, humans are selfish creatures.  What else is 'rational' predicated
upon anyway?  Rational is always about 'self interest', how to maximize
profit...that sort of stuff...&quot;What's in it for me?&quot;.  Our universities
spread this value in a big way...and no one wants to be stupid...right?
Rational, rational, rational...and so, our CEO's and leaders in all arenas
must become Machievellian, at least in private thought, while stoking the
masses only with 'altruistic' masks for good PR.  Intellectualism is about
rationalism...is about 'selfishness'.

Well, I'm not so pessimistic as it sounds here, but I do think this is more
'realistic'.  The great flaw in humanism is that there is no 'authority' by
which people can 'rationalize' against self interest...for the greater good
etc.  Morality becomes simply what is popular today...a 'relative' standard
that flops in the wind [like Bush Hating being what is vogue, the 'IN' thing
to do, ha, joke].  God gives the individual a symbol by which they can
reason with themselves a state of higher virtue by which they may align
their personal behavior...even if it means 'self sacrifice' [and often it
does, should].  God's symbol incorporates not just supreme order, but all
higher order in all it's forms...coalesced internally as however we sense a
'higher virtue' than our selves.

Whatever conscience humanists exist upon today, I argue it is only borrowed
from deist cultural foundations that date back to the earliest
socializations...like a 'muscle' already developed.  But now, without
further accord to it's maintenance and repair [as we tear down God's
standard in our minds and morality becomes a thing of choice, without a lot
of personal sacrifice involved], Conscience wanes.  True, that borrowed
'unselfishness' may sustain us for a time...but not for long, IMO. Quiery
your own substantial intellect and ask yourself what justification do you
have to go against yourself?  A feeling perhaps...but remember, some of us
have gone further in our ordination of emotion to symbolize God's existence
in us as Love itself.  That will be the defining element in your
humanism...but without the symbol or intellectual justification of existing
beyond self [unless one is simply willing to be irrational...which is of
course, insane].

&gt; might seem like hell.  So, there's your peace on earth if you want it.
&gt; Which has become 'piece' on earth I think, LOL.

&gt;&gt; &gt; As the heart beats its rhythm of life, we go about our daily chores of
&gt;&gt; &gt; living. Sorrow is felt upon the wind as it flows past our weathered
&gt;&gt; &gt; face, but we continue on our daily tasks, after all, we have felt his
&gt;&gt; &gt; wind for centuries and we have grown accustomed to its message.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Nothing can be done here. It is part of life.
&gt;&gt; &gt; We stretch our aching back worn down by years of hardship. With weary
&gt;&gt; &gt; eyes we scan the horizon for any signs of relief...we see none. The
&gt;&gt; &gt; cries of the fallen reverberate in our ears and no matter how hard we
&gt;&gt; &gt; try, the sounds never seem to go away. Tears fall like heavy rain and
&gt;&gt; &gt; our shoulders slump under their weight. The walls we have built out of
&gt;&gt; &gt; mortar and sand crumble at our feet and we cry &quot;no more&quot;.
&gt;&gt; &gt; We have had enough. We have had enough of the bloodshed. We have had
&gt;&gt; &gt; enough of the pain. A thought echo's in our mind that speaks of a new
&gt;&gt; &gt; beginning and that we are its creators. It is time. With strength we
&gt;&gt; &gt; knew not we had, our back straightens with a conviction of a billion
&gt;&gt; &gt; billion souls whose time has come.
&gt;&gt; &gt; We are the power of change. We are the power to bring peace, truth and
&gt;&gt; &gt; compassion into our lives. Our body tingles with life that has long
&gt;&gt; &gt; been dormant; our heart pumps strong and true with the power of
&gt;&gt; &gt; humanity beating as one. Humanity has the power to change if we wish
&gt;&gt; &gt; to change.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Once again our eyes scan the horizon and we see hope where once was
&gt;&gt; &gt; fear. Our body finds its strength from the countless men and women who
&gt;&gt; &gt; have come before us and gives us the courage to take that step towards
&gt;&gt; &gt; peace. Our heart instinctively knows the way. Deep down, we have
&gt;&gt; &gt; always known the way. We are coming home to peace. We are coming home
&gt;&gt; &gt; to a life long denied.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Today is that day. Today is the first step in a long climb to bring
&gt;&gt; &gt; hope to those who despair, compassion to those afflicted with the pain
&gt;&gt; &gt; of loss and integrity to those that have lost the light of truth.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Today is that day. We have reached a defining moment in our lives. It
&gt;&gt; &gt; is time. It is time to bring world peace upon this Earth.

&gt;&gt; Beautiful, but  for one &quot;trauma causative&quot; aspect.

&gt;&gt; You have described the journey of &quot;one&quot;. When that emerging view mutates
&gt;&gt; into the projected expectation on &quot;humanity&quot;, the conflict is
&gt;&gt; perpetuated.
&gt;&gt; From Marks, to Ghandi, to Hitler. They all had great vision &quot;for others&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Think about it. If it was chronological for all, we wouldnt be able to
&gt;&gt; read
&gt;&gt; of historical figures who had already found the bliss of existance.Why do
&gt;&gt; you think that many see religion (read also ideology) as the cause of
&gt;&gt; most
&gt;&gt; world conflict? One group tries to either overpower or eradicate the
&gt;&gt; other.....to fight for peace, or as Ghandi espoused, via peaceful
&gt;&gt; resistance.

&gt;&gt; Enlightened ones dont try to elucidate by instruction,
&gt;&gt; Because they know the point and purpose of the road of disruption. They
&gt;&gt; can
&gt;&gt; see how the disruption really comes about and why.

&gt;&gt; They may however write poetry or compose inspiring music.
&gt; The creative artist has the innate need to create. There's no need for
&gt; an appreciative audience.

And you dont have to be enlightened to create...but it is a step on the
way...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Most of the world conflict is caused by the Levantine religions.
">

Whatever they are. Whoever believes that,  are still &quot;group think&quot;
restricted...and part of the cause of the problem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There
&gt; are many others which have operated peacefully with each other for
&gt; millennia. Ghandi's vision worked with the Brits.
">

Limited view. Look at the broader picture. He did later on and was
traumatised by the direction which took place.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;It would not have
&gt; worked with the Nazis.

Nazism was an ideology. My whole point. Different &quot;group thinking&quot;,
different outcomes, but always disruptive .

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Nazi officers were concerned because SS troops were suffering what we
&gt; now call PTSD from shooting women &amp; kids, so they invented the gas
&gt; chambers so the troops would not have to watch people die. Solved the
&gt; problem.

Nothing to do with my point.

&gt; Well Dan, this was moving for the first few paragraphs.  It seemed you
&gt; were being successful in capturing something in articulation of the
&gt; suffering people withstand in this world.  Cudos on that.

&gt; But then you went into a diabtribe about world peace and a call for people
&gt; to change and all that...a diabribe that has been heard by every
&gt; generation since time immemorial perhaps.  Well, the world
&gt; changes...evolves, that's for sure...and in many ways, gets better I
&gt; suppose.

&gt; Indeed, there is much suffering in this world.  There are two issues
&gt; [among others] that probably makes suffering non-retractable:
&gt; 'over-population', and 'scarce resources'.

&gt; But even if we were to overcome such issues, I always offer the idea that
&gt; most humans, at least in the first world, already live on the material
&gt; level that Kings and Queens did centuries ago.  Yet, the struggle [and
&gt; suffering] still continues on.  Few of us 'feel' like Kings or Queens, but
&gt; more like roadkill running from street pavers.  So, if the materials of
&gt; life do not make us happy...nor even content...then I ask 'what does'?

&gt; Has anyone noticed that Bowery Row is inhabited mostly by men?  That our
&gt; prisons are full of ...mostly men?
&gt; The simple minded might be tempted to make a gross judgment about 'men'
&gt; from such observation.  But I think the better question would be 'what is
&gt; driving men'?

&gt; Well, I always promise myself to write shorter comments on this NG...so
&gt; I'll cut to the chase.  I contend that 'human relations' make or break
&gt; us...is cause of our greatest suffering or the greatest joy.  If human
&gt; relations are healthy, we can withstand pestulence, desease, even war and
&gt; our spirits not too greatly damaged.  But if our human relations go sour,
&gt; even a stubbed toe might seem like hell.  So, there's your peace on earth
&gt; if you want it. Which has become 'piece' on earth I think, LOL.

Peace unearthed would be more accurate, individually &quot;wrapped&quot; ....:-)
