BLOSSOM: The First Date

"Sure, I understand," Nick said into the phone. "No, no hard feelings. Well,
nice talking to you."

"Shot down again, huh?" His son Anthony came ambling in from the kitchen.

"Yeah," Nick said, "and thanks for the sympathy. Hey, are you doing anything
Saturday night? Maybe we could rent a video, or..."

"Sorry, Dad, no dice. I've got to work." Anthony plopped down in front of the TV
as Nick's other son, Joey, came through the front door. "Hey, Joey," Anthony
called out. "Dad struck out with some woman again. You busy Saturday night?"

"Uh, no," Joey said. "Why?"

"To go out with Dad," Anthony explained patiently.

"Oh. Uh, I'm busy."

"But Joey," Nick broke in. "You just said you were free!"

"Uh -- something came up?"

"But ..."

Not waiting for the rest, Joey ducked into the kitchen.

Just then Nick's daughter, Blossom, came down the stairs. She was about 16, just
on the verge of true womanhood. She hid a developing body in an agglomera- tion
of bits and pieces of old clothes, but her growing breasts and slender legs were
becoming too noticeable to be hidden. Nick had done the best he could raising
her on his own these last few years since the divorce, but secretly he feared he
hadn't done enough. Was she ready for adulthood -- and adult relationships? One
son was a recovering addict, another was -- not to put it too bluntly -- dumb as
a rock. Blossom was his last hope.

Luckily, he thought to himself, she never seemed to realize how much hope and
concern he had invested in her she was almost always cheerful, easy-going, ready
for anything.

"Hi, Dad," she called out, heading for the door. "I gotta..."

"Blossom!" he cut in. "Are you ..."

"Watch out," Anthony interrupted. "Dad got stiffed again. He's..."

"Again?" Blossom edged closer to the door. "Look, I've really gotta go ..."

"Doing anything Saturday night?" Nick finished.

"Looking for someone to go out with him," Anthony said.

"Out to meet Six," Blossom answered as she slipped out the door. "See ya!"

=== === === ===

"So, like, he wants you to spend Saturday night with him? Your own father?" Six,
Blossom's closest and dearest friend, punctuated her amazement with a deep draw
on the straw sticking out of her ice cream soda.

"Yeah, Six, but I didn't say yes or anything," Blossom said.

"So what's the problem?"

"The problem is I think I should. Say yes, I mean."

"But, Blossom, this Saturday? It's, like, the big- gest dance ever! Like,
everyone will be there! You can't miss it -- Oh, wait. Don't tell me you're think-
ing of bringing your dad along?"

"No, it's not that. I just think we should have some time together. You know,
father-daughter stuff. With school and dates, I hardly ever just sit down with
him anymore."

=== === === ===

Nick was staring at some old movie on TV when Blossom slipped in the door that
evening. "Oh, hi, Blossom," he said quietly, before dipping a hand into his
microwave popcorn. He tried to put just enough angst into his words to make her
feel guilty, without putting in so much that she'd catch on to the con. It was a
dirty job being a parent, he told himself, but someone had to do it.

The young girl came up behind him and put her arms around his neck. Nick's
eyebrows rose. Had it worked?

"Hey, Dad, guess what? I am free Saturday," she said. "So whaddaya say? Is
it a date?"

"A date? Oh, sure, I guess, if you really want to," Nick said, lazily. "I was
going to do some work around the house, but if you want some company..."

Blossom put her lips close to his ear. "Nice try, Dad," she whispered. "But I
saw right through you. Pick me up at seven. And it better be a nice dinner."

As she went up the stairs to her room, Nick turned around and watched her go
with a smile on his face. Well, he thought, I guess my act didn't work, but who
cares? At least I won't be alone on Saturday night.

=== === === ===

Six was sitting cross-legged on the bed as Blossom pulled out outfit
after outfit.

"What's the big deal, Blossom? You're only going out with your dad. It's not
like you have to look good or anything. Why don't you wear that green thing?"

"What, I don't look good in that?" Blossom held the vest and skirt against her
body. "What's wrong with it?"

"Nothing's wrong with it," her friend said, exas- perated. "That's my point. I
think. Look, just throw something on. You don't have to impress anyone."

"But I want to, Six," Blossom said, tossing the green outfit onto the rumpled
pile of rejects. "I know it's just my dad, but he's taking me to a really fancy
restaurant. And, besides, I want to look nice for him. Show him how good I
turned out, so he doesn't keep worrying about whether I'll be a catastrophe."

"You? A catastrophe? Come on, Blossom. Now, me ..."

"Well, he worries. I mean, he doesn't say anything about it, but I can tell. So
I think -- hey, how about this?" She pulled out a black velvet dress from the
deep recesses of her closet and held it up.

"Wow, where have you been hiding that?"

Blossom blushed. "I bought it for one of the dances last year. You know, the one
I didn't go to? I thought I'd look all sophisticated, but it was too big and I
just looked like a little girl playing dress up. That's why I stayed home at the
last minute. I don't know. Maybe I've grown into it?"

At Six's urging she slipped into the sleek dress. She had, indeed, grown into
it. As she twirled in the mirror, the dress clung to her curves. Its deep V
neckline plunged between her breasts, showing off their firm young mounds, and
the thin spaghetti straps con- cealed nothing of the creamy sweep of her
shoulders. Although the hem fell to her knees, deep slits on either side showed
off flashes of slim thighs with every movement. When Blossom stepped into a pair
of shiny black high-heeled pumps, she completed the trans- formation from frumpy
teenager to blossoming young woman.

Six stared open-mouthed. At last she shrieked in glee. "Blossom! Is that you?"

Blossom made one last twirl in front of the mirror. "I do look pretty
good, don't I?"

"You look like a million bucks. But ..."

"What?"

"Well -- you're not gonna wear that with your dad, are you? I mean, Blossom,
this is not a dress for going out with Daddy. This is a dress for going out with
-- I don't know, somebody hunky. You've gotta save this!"

A cloud of uncertainty crossed Blossom's face. Then, with a look of
determination, she unzipped the dress -- but hung it in the front of the closet,
not back in the dim recesses. "That's the one," she said. "That way my dad will
know his little girl has grown up."

=== === === ===

Nick shrugged into a gray sports coat, smoothed out the wrinkles in his slacks
and tugged his tie into place. For a minute, he almost felt like he was getting
ready for a first date. Blossom had insisted they go someplace nice, and
Arturo's was the best Italian restaurant in town. But it also had a strict
dress code. He twisted his neck back and forth and stuck a finger underneath
the collar. Darn shirts must be shrinking, he thought they didn't used to be
this tight.

At 8 o'clock sharp he heard footsteps tumbling down the stairs. He looked up ...
and wondered how such a beautiful woman could have snuck into the house without
him noticing. It was only when he glimpsed that unmis- takable nose that he was
really convinced this was his daughter.

Blossom's lithe legs flashed down the stairs with every step the dress's slits
parted, revealing a long expanse of leg encased in sheer black stockings. The
velvet clung tightly to her young body, emphasizing the slim waist, the full
breasts. A gold pendant on a thin chain hung just between the twin rises. Nick
had to force his eyes away.

He tried to swallow and found that his mouth had gone dry. He had never imagined
Blossom could look so -- so, well, sexy. The thought hit him hard. This was the
little girl he was sending off into the world? How could she protect herself?
Every horny boy in sight would be trying to get his hands on her. With a frown,
he thought of some greasy punk putting the moves on his daughter.

"Hey, Dad, cheer up," Blossom chirped as she hit the bottom step. "Come on, this
is our big date! You've got to show a girl a good time!" She slipped her arm
into his and steered him toward the door.

The ride over to the restaurant, the conversation was just like any other they'd
had over the years -- what happened in school that day, what dumb thing Joey had
done now, stuff like that. But when they got to Arturo's and the maitre'd in his
tuxedo showed them to a candlelit booth set with red linen, white china and
sparkling crystal, Nick didn't feel comfortable chiding Blossom about her
homework. Their talk turned to more serious topics -- her future dreams, his
future wor- ries. Blossom seemed like a pro at it, he thought even as he went
along with it he knew she was carefully guiding their conversation, keeping it
happy, trying to boost his spirits. She seemed so mature, in these surroundings.

Maybe, he thought, maybe it was because seeing her outside of the house meant
seeing her outside of all the accumulated memories of her childhood. In such an
adult setting, he was finally able to see his daughter as an adult -- or, he
reminded himself, almost an adult.

He tried to tell her that, but the words seemed to trip over themselves and he
couldn't get them out right. Trying to make his point, he reached across the
table and took her slim hand in his. It started out as just a momentary gesture,
but his hand lingered on hers. He felt her downy skin, the pulse beating just
below the surface. Their eyes locked and for a moment neither spoke.

"Ahem." It was the waiter, bringing their main courses. Nick took his hand away,
slowly. The conver- sation lagged as they ate.

Halfway through dessert, Blossom suddenly whispered to her father. "Psst. That
couple to your right. Don't look now! The ones having the lasagna."

Nick lifted his napkin up to his face, using it as a shield while he snuck a
peek. A middle-aged couple surrounded by a forest of empty wine bottles and glas-
ses looked away quickly as his eyes caught his.

"What is it?" he whispered to his daughter. "What are they doing?"

Blossom leaned over the table, keeping her voice low. Her young breasts pressed
against the top of her dress as she bent forward, and her pendant dangled just
above her pasta.

"They've been staring at us all night. You know what I think?" She winked.

"What?"

"I bet they think I'm your date, not your daugh- ter." She smiled. "From the
looks on their faces now, I'm almost sure of it!"

Nick leaned back, blushing. He was a bit embarras- sed, but Blossom seemed to
take it as a great joke.

"You know," she said as the waiter picked up Nick's credit card, "we could
really drive them crazy. You want to?"

Nick smirked. This was the Blossom he always knew, the one who loved to pull the
leg of stuffy people. With only a passing thought about pulling a practical joke
in such a fancy place, he nodded his assent. "What do we do?"

"Just follow my lead," she said. The waiter brought the check back then Nick
signed off with a generous tip and rose from the table.

Blossom slid out of her side. As she did, her skirt rode up and a slit opened
wide, giving the couple at the next table a clear view of her luscious legs. She
tugged on Nick's shoulder as he started to turn for the door. He turned back to
her, and Blossom reached up and flung her arms around his neck and kissed him.

It was no father-daughter kiss. She opened her mouth and pressed it to his lips,
slipping her tongue inside. He felt her body pressed closely to his, her breasts
squashed against his chest, one of her legs wrapped around his. His arms
surrounded her, and his hands met on the bare, warm skin of her back. Blossom
held the kiss for a full minute, her hands tangling in his hair.

At last they broke their embrace. "Thanks for the dinner, Daddy," Blossom said
in a stage whisper as they passed the obviously shocked couple.

Nick's mind was awhirl. To his own shock, he real- ized he now had an erection,
his hard cock pressing against his pants. He hastily buttoned up his sports
coat, hoping it would cover up the bulge. For a frac- tion of a second, he had
forgotten Blossom was his daughter and had become lost in a passionate kiss with
a very lovely young woman. Now, realizing what he had done, Nick was in a daze.

Somehow he made his way to the car. As he opened the door for her, Blossom
pecked him on the cheek -- a very daughterly thing to do. By the time he'd
gotten in on his side, he'd almost convinced himself he was exag- gerating what
had gone before. He felt his erection subsiding as he slipped his key into the
ignition and started up the engine. Then he looked over at his daughter. She was
looking out the passenger window, the light from a passing car throwing her into
silhouette. Nick smiled at the familiar profile. But then his eyes went down,
down to her chest, where he could see her breasts heaving. It wasn't just him,
he knew then.

And as the car passed and his eyes adjusted to the dim light, he saw the
smooth curves of Blossom's silky legs. He closed his eyes briefly. His
erection was back.

Suppressing his stormy emotions, Nick opened his eyes again and pulled out of
the parking spot. "Good food, don't you think?" he said, an artificial bright-
ness making his voice brittle.

"Hmm? Oh, yes," Blossom said, still staring out her window. She seemed far away.

"Yes, good food," Nick repeated.

They didn't say another word while they drove across town to the theater, got
their tickets and settled into a back row in the crowded screening room.

The lights dimmed, but it took a few minutes, while the trailers zipped past,
for the audience to quiet down. The theater was hushed by the time the feature
was underway. It was a romance -- Blossom had picked it out, of course -- filled
with lingering moments and tight embraces.

Nick became aware, little by little, of a subtle scent of roses. He bent closer
to Blossom -- yes, it was her perfume. She noticed the movement and bent toward
him, resting her head on his shoulder. Nick watched as the light from the screen
cast a flickering halo around Blossom's long brown hair. Each strand seemed to
catch the light a different way, lending a sultry sheen to her appearance.

A man from further down the row bumped past then. "Excuse me! Pardon me!" Nick
and Blossom settled back into their seats after he passed.

On the screen, it grew cold and wintry as the lovers struggled to make a go of
it. The sound of the wind rushing through the cracks in their hovel seemed to
fill the theater, and soon everyone in the audience was shivering along with the
actors. Nick put his arm around Blossom's shoulder and drew her close.

She burrowed into his side. He felt his heart thump loudly and was amazed that
everyone else in the theater didn't turn around and tell him to shush.

Nick's hand was resting on Blossom's bare arm. Then she shifted slightly and his
hand slipped in between her arm and her side. Instinctively he flexed his
fingers and felt her warm flesh give a little. The feeling was familiar. His
eyes staring straight ahead, Nick realized with a thud that he was groping his
daughter's breast. His cock grew harder and he squirm- ed a bit.

Blossom made no move to get away. It seemed to Nick that his hand didn't belong
to him any more. Without conscious direction, it followed the sensuous curve of
Blossom's firm mound. His fingers moved slowly, tender- ly across the velvet. A
prickle of electricity shot up Nick's arm as they strayed off the material and
onto her skin in the deep valley between her breasts. Her pendant slipped over
his fingers as they explored fur- ther.

"Sorry! Coming through!" The man from down the aisle worked his way back past
them, a huge tub of pop- corn and a vat of soda clutched to his body. This time
when he passed Nick and Blossom remained linked.

Nick's cock was rock-hard now, squeezed so tightly by his slacks that the pain
was intense. Suddenly he felt the pressure ease. As he looked down, a small,
pale hand was unzipping his fly.

Nick licked his lips.

A small voice within him continued to tell him it was wrong. But the memory of
his daughter's hot, burn- ing kiss was stronger. As the lopsided battle went on
with his conscience, Blossom spread apart the flap of his briefs and tugged his
dick free.

Nick sighed at the relief as his massive erection sprang out. While he tenderly
caressed Blossom's breasts, his young daughter grasped his shaft and began to
rub. Slowly, at first. He felt her fingers slide over the wide helmet and down
the rod, tugging slightly at the dry skin stretched tight by his hard-on. Soon,
though, a few drops of pre-cum oozed out of the tip and she rubbed them down,
lubricating his shaft as she be- gan to speed up her ministrations.

She was using only her thumb and forefinger to circle his cock. Nick bent down
and whispered in her ear. "Use your whole hand, sweetheart. Oh, yes, like that.
Honey, you know I love you. You're making your father very happy now. Oh,
sweetheart!"

Blossom, her head still buried in his side, mur- mured back, "Is it really good,
Dad? Am I doing it all right?"

"You're doing it perfect, Blossom," Nick cooed. "Just ... just ... oohhhhhhhh!"

Two spurts, then a third and the cum boiled out of him, erupting out the tip of
his cock and flowing down over Blossom's hand. She continued to rub until he
pushed her hand away.

Taking his arm from her side, Nick reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a
handkerchief, offering it to his daughter.

But Blossom lifted her head and looked directly into his eyes. Then she put her
hand to her mouth, the hand glistening with Nick's cum, and licked the fingers
clean, one by one. After she had finished, Nick bent down and kissed her. The
taste of his own salty cum in his daughter's mouth was incredibly erotic, and
his cock began to stiffen slightly.

Just then the credits began to roll and the house lights came up slowly. Nick
stuffed his cock back into his pants and zipped them hastily.

Nick weaved slightly as they walked out to the parking lot he felt unsteady and
uncertain and very confused.

Blossom clung closely to him, but the crowd was everywhere and it wasn't until
they were both in the car that he felt it safe to talk.

"Blossom..." he began.

"Dad..." she did as well.

They both smiled.

"You first," she said at last.

Nick began by looking at her, but found it easier to turn away and stare out the
windshield. He took a deep breath.

"Blossom, I -- I'm sorry for what happened in there. I let things get out of
control. It's my fault. I -- Can you forgive me? Can you ever forgive me?"

Blossom put a hand on his arm. Nick flinched.

"Dad, it's not your fault. You can't help what happened. It was me. I -- I don't
know. Maybe I got caught up in the movie. All I know is that I love you and ..."

"I love you, too, Blossom. But you know we can't.."

"I know!"

Nick could hear her sobbing quietly, but Nick still kept his eyes straight
ahead. His fingers were curled so tightly around the steering wheel that the
knuckles were a ghostly white.

"It's wrong." Even to Nick, his words sounded cold and flat. "It's just
wrong. Blossom, I'm your father. I should know better. But when I saw you
tonight, so beautiful, so -- so sexy, I -- NO! No, I can't do that! I can't
say that! There's no excuse!" His head fell onto the steering wheel. "Oh,
God, what have I done?"

"Dad?" Blossom put her arm around him. "Dad, I... maybe I wanted something to
happen. I knew what this dress was like. And in the restaurant -- well, you
know. I have to admit I've wondered for a long time what it would be like to
kiss you like that. I've never kissed a boy like that -- well, except for
one, once, but that was just to see what it was like. And it wasn't -- like
it was with you.

"So it's my fault, Dad. Oh, please, don't hate me!"

"Hate you?" Nick turned toward her. He saw the tracks of her tears running down
her smooth cheeks. "Honey, I love you. I really do. I always -- always..."

Nick bent forward. The words were still dying on his lips when he kissed the
tears from her cheeks. But then he went on, to her mouth. Their tongues met.
A flame rose high within him. His arms wrapped around her, pressing her
against his chest. He felt her heart- beat pounding madly. Eagerly, hungrily
they kissed.

All hesitation and doubt had left him. There was room for just one emotion in
his mind, and that was a deep, abiding, erotic love for this nubile goddess
in his arms.

Their embrace lasted long after the other cars had left the lot. Finally they
broke it off. With trembling hands, Nick put the car into gear and drove off.

What now, he thought? Now that I am madly in love with my own daughter?

It was Blossom who made the next choice.

"Turn here," she said softly. "At the light."

Nick swung the car to the right. Within a few blocks they had left the bright
lights of the main road behind them. He looked around. It had been awhile since
he'd been in this part of town, and he wasn't sure where they were heading. The
street lights were few and far between now.

"There, off to the right. See, between those two posts?"

Dimly he made out a rutted path. The headlights picked out a narrow, rugged lane
that went into the brush for a hundred feet or so and then stopped in a dark,
secluded clearing.

He turned to Blossom. "Where are we?"

"The kids at school told me about this place," she said quietly. "They use it
for -- well, special occa- sions. I've never been here myself. I guess I never
had a special occasion - until now."

Blossom's fingertips brushed Nick's neck as she helped him off with his sports
coat. The steering wheel jabbed him in the side as he twisted.

"Maybe we should ..." Blossom said, motioning with her eyes to the back seat.

She and Nick got out on opposite sides of the car. Blossom quickly opened the
rear door on her side and slid in.

Nick, though, closed the driver's door and then let his body sag against the
car's frame. The enormity of what he was about to do seemed to concentrate
itself into a roar in his head like a massive wave breaking over the shore. I
can't, he told himself.

There was a tap at the window. He looked in. Blos- som crooked a finger at him.
He got in.

The young girl slid back to her side of the car. While Nick loosened his tie and
undid his belt buckle, Blossom slipped the thin straps of her dress off her
shoulder and reached behind her back to pull down the short zipper.

Tugging his shirt out of his slacks, Nick found his thoughts hopelessly tangled.
In his mind's eye he saw Blossom growing up -- a babe in arms, a little girl
taking her first bike ride, a kid singing along with him. But when he looked up
he saw something else: a lovely maiden lowering her dress, exposing a pair of
exquisite breasts. The thin moonlight rippling through the branches made
speckled patterns on her pale skin, revealing now and again the small, dark
circles at the peak of each breast, the darker nubbins protruding from them.

Nick fumbled off his shoes and socks, then slid off his slacks and briefs.
Blossom reached out, her dress still half-on, and caressed his chest.

And then she wiggled out of the dress. As it slumped to the floor, she reached
down and peeled off her pantyhose.

Even in the dim light, Nick could make out the dark patch of hair, the
voluptuous swell of her hips.

He moved toward her, stretching out on the bench seat. His hand fluttered above
her body, tracing out every curve and hollow. They kissed, tenderly, and then he
moved down, nuzzling her neck, working his way to Blossom's perfect orbs. With
soft, butterfly kisses he surrounded them, until at last he reached the summit.
Then greedily he suckled his daughter's nipples, taking them into his mouth,
biting gently at their sensitive skin.

Blossom moaned, deeply, and writhed beneath him.

Nick's hand followed the swoop of her torso down to her thighs. He ran the back
of his hand over the soft skin, moving with each pass closer and closer to her
virgin treasure. Blossom opened herself to him, spreading her legs apart.

Nick savored every second, every touch, every sen- sation. Never in his life, he
thought, had he seen such a perfect body. Never had love and lust mingled so
intoxicatingly.

His fingers brushed against the crinkly hair of his daughter's pubic mound, and
then slid down to her labia. He was delighted to find them already slick.
Tenderly he spread them, slipping a finger inside, running it up and down her
lubricated slit.

"Yesss," Blossom sighed, spreading her legs further apart.

Nick explored deeper into his daughter, pressing on until he came to the
maidenhead. A frisson of joy reverberated in his head. Still a virgin! For a
second some almost dead part of him called out to let her re- main so. But this
felt so right.

His thumb found the little button of her clitoris and Blossom shrieked for a
second. Her breath was com- ing in gulps now as he manipulated her clitoris and
extended two fingers into her opening.

"I want you," Blossom gasped. "I want you in me now, Daddy!"

Nick shifted, rolling over so that his hips rested between hers. He felt the
underside of his cock rub against her pubic patch, scratching delicately at the
sensitive shaft.

"We don't -- we don't have to do anything you don't want to," he whispered to
her. "I want you, honey, but if we're going too fast, it's not too late."

"No! I want you!" she insisted. "Please, please, put it in me!"

Nick let the head of his cock slide down to the hot, wet entrance to his
daughter's tunnel. Blossom immediately began to buck up at him.

He held back, letting his cock ride up and down the slick folds. He wanted her
first time to be as special, as gentle, as perfect as he could make it. Still
hold- ing his cock outside her, Nick bent down and kissed Blossom. She kissed
him back hard, inflamed with lust.

Ever so slightly, ever so cautiously he pressed his cock into her. The hot
folds spread apart easily, open- ing -- blossoming, even -- to accept his
engorged rod.

With the helmet not quite all the way in, Nick pul- led back again. Blossom
answered with a quiet growl. "You're teasing me," she protested.

"Love isn't something to be rush, Blossom," Nick told his daughter. "It's like a
fine wine. You should approach it slowly. Explore it from every angle. Sip at it
lightly, then savor the taste." As he spoke, he again slid his cockhead into
her. This time he let the helmet pop all the way in, but held it there.

"What if I want to gulp it?" Blossom said. He could hear the smile in her voice.

"There will be time for that later," he said. "But now, honey, this might
hurt a bit."

"I know, " she said. "But I'm -- I'm ready."

Nick covered her mouth with his as he pressed his cock up to her maidenhead. The
thin tissue held. He thrust once, twice, a third time, and then felt it tear
away, allowing his cock to slide all the way in.

Her vagina was tight, tighter than he'd ever had before. He felt every inch
inside her, and it was hard to resist the urge to begin driving his shaft in and
out immediately.

But Blossom was biting her lip, and a tear or two glistened in the corners
of her eyes.

She must have sensed his fear. "It wasn't too bad," she whispered.

That eased Nick's fears, but he still was afraid to move. After a few moments,
Blossom moved her hips under him, urging him on. Still he didn't dare.

His daughter put her lips to his ear and whispered softly.

"Fuck me, Daddy."

With a groan, Nick eased his raging hard-on out of Blossom's cunt and plunged
it back in.

"Oh, yes!" she cried, her hands clawing at his naked back. "Yes, more!"

Nick complied with her request, driving his rod in and out of her no longer
virginal tunnel. On each up- stroke he would lift almost completely out, so he
could get the delight of feeling her tight lips spread open before his pressure
again and again.

Fucking his daughter, her hole so tight, but her body so willing, made him feel
like a teenager again himself, like he was experiencing his own first fuck. He
tried out different rhythms, he wiggled his cock from side to side -- though
there wasn't much room to maneuver -- he even inserted a finger in her anus and
felt the pressure of his shaft through her asshole's wall.

Through it all Blossom kept up a running commentary complimenting his technique,
suggesting new angles, screaming her joy. Her mother had been almost silent in
bed, especially toward the end this was a new and wonderful experience for Nick.
Blossom's encouragement -- especially, he found, the unusual thrill of hearing
her use language he never thought she knew -- magnified his ecstasy.

"Fuck me harder," the young girl moaned. "I want your cock in me all the way.
Please, please, push it in! Harder!"

With her vaginal secretions easing the way, Nick increased the tempo,
faster, faster, pistoning his rod into her eager cunt until he felt a
boiling in his loins.

"Oh, God, Blossom, I'm gonna cum," he groaned. "I'd better pull out!"

"No, no! I'm on the Pill! Put it all in me!" She was a wildcat, scratching at
his sides as she bucked furiously. "I want it all!"

And then Nick felt the cum explode out of him, a hot jet of jism surging into
his daughter. He pressed his mouth to hers as the cum poured out.

Blossom kept humping her hips, trying for more and more. Nick's cock quivered
under her attack it had grown so sensitive after the orgasm that every touch was
a delicious agony. He pounded his fists into the car's upholstery as his
daughter fought to push him into her cunt.

At last Nick's rod began to shrink, until just the tip was still clutched in her
vaginal lips. He raised himself on his arms and tried to move away.

"Oh, no, you don't," Blossom said with a smirk. She had wrapped her legs around
his, holding in him place.

"I can't do any more," Nick protested. "That's it!"

"Maybe not," Blossom purred as she licked his sweaty neck. "Are you sure?"

Nick thought he was, but now his daughter was caressing his shaft with her cunt,
bucking up at in in short, sharp movements. To his amazement, his cock began to
grow again. A third time in one night? That was a record for him, he knew.

But Blossom seemed to take it for granted. God, what a devil he had,
Nick thought.

Obeying his cock's urgings, he resumed the in-and- out motions, sliding through
his daughter's pillowy tunnel. She sighed as she matched him stroke for stroke.

It didn't last long this time. Nick's cock quickly grew larger, thicker,
pressing against the tight walls. "Oh, God, Dad," Blossom said. "It's even
better! Oh, please, please, take it slow. That's it!"

Nick played her cunt like a violin, running his bow over the strings of his
daughter's cunt. It built and built to a crashing crescendo as again he felt his
cum boil up.

And this time Blossom joined in his cries. "I'm cumming," she moaned. "Don't
stop, don't stop, don't sttooooopppppppp!" As the jism pulsed out of his cock,
Nick felt Blossom stiffen and then suddenly release like a spring, and again,
and again. Her wild flailing milked every drop of cum from his cock until at
last she was still and he slipped his shrunken rod out of her, still cuddling
her to him as the sweat cooled their bodies.

"Dad?" Blossom whispered in his ear.

"Yes, honey?"

"I'm free next Saturday."
