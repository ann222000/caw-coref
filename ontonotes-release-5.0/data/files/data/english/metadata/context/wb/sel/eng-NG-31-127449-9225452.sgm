They say it's best to die from something you love doing, but this seems
tragic nonetheless (though a good plot-line for Poirot or Miss Marple):

&quot;Gloria Dawson, a theatre worker, loved to present flowers to the leading
ladies. But being present when the curtain came down was to cost her life.
Mrs Dawson developed a disease caused by asbestos from a crumbling fire
safety curtain, an inquest was told.
She worked at the municipal Hexagon Theatre in Reading for 25 years,
beginning as an usherette and working her way up to assistant house manager.
After retiring in 2001 the grandmother continued to work part-time and would
present actors with after-show flowers on stage, breathing in the asbestos
with every encore.&quot;

The story says the municipality, which owned the theatre, accepted
liability, and a settlement was negotiated. Lawsuits are for when they
don't accept responsibility, or you can't agree on a settlement.

Not sure what you mean by her unborn. She was in her 60s when she was
diagnosed, and highly unlikely to produce more offspring even had she
lived to 90.

I was guessing that he was refering to a greedy piling-on at the feed

Those safety devices'll get you every time.

Earlier this year ago I was on vacation with my father, who has
limited vision, but normally enough to get around in daytime.  As we
crossed the road onto a sidewalk, there was a line of bollards to
keep the French drivers on the road and safely off the sidewalk.
They were knee-high and the same color as the sidwalk.  He walked
right into one without seeing it.

He wasn't seriously hurt, but it was rather a shock.  Here's a worse one:

In Toronto (or maybe it was Scarborough; Toronto now, anyway) about
25 years ago, the rear doors on a bus malfunctioned, opening by
themselves and staying open.  Nobody fell out when it happened, and
a safety interlock immobilized the bus.

On a railroad crossing.

With a train coming.

I don't remember the casualty count, but it was a nasty crash.
(No, the bus driver wasn't at fault.  The crossing lights started
flashing just after the involuntary stop.  There wasn't time for
everyone to get off and away.)

My grandpa allegedly stalled a school bus on train tracks, and he drove it
off with the starting motor (i.e. cranking with the tranny in gear and the
clutch engaged.  Or whatever passed for clutches back when he was drying
school buses. The belt tensioner tensioned, maybe.)  Probably can't do that
anymore either.  Although you could on my Dodge Colt.

The ValuJet crash in Florida was caused by safety devices for another
type of airplane entirely, being shipped as cargo.  Interestingly
enough, no passenger life has ever been saved by these safety devices,
which are emergency oxygen supplies.

There's a guy named Perrow who wrote a book ages ago (it was
republished fairly recently) about how adding on all kinds of safety
system and back-up systems and stuff make systems so complex that
humans are unable to understand them.  The various systems interact in
ways that can't be predicted, leading to what he calls &quot;normal
accidents&quot;.  Other people have followed up this research, including a
group at Stanford (where I think Scott Sagan, Carl's son, is; he did a
fascinating study on nuclear weapons safety).

You couldn't have done it in my Corolla, at least not until I
semi-permanently bypassed the clutch interlock.
