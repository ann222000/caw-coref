It pays to pitch Scientology, according to earnings reports the church has
filed with the Internal Revenue Service.

One man averaged almost $200,000 a year in commissions from the fees of new
members he had solicited to become Scientologists.

The church gives its proselytizers 10 to 15 percent of what newcomers
&quot;donate&quot; for church services, such as the process called auditing that tells
how far from salvation the newcomer is. That means the top pitchman in the
1990s, identified only as Barry Klein, drummed up more than $1.3-million for
Scientology each year.

Scientologists who collect from other church members can make out even
better. Ken Pirak made $407,000 in 1991 from a western states &quot;membership
tour,&quot; as the church calls its fund-raising roundups. Next in line that year
was Steve Grant, whose commissions totaled $340,000 from a membership tour
based in Clearwater, home of Scientology's spiritual headquarters.

The rest of the article has an interesting breakdown of the asset
information presented to the IRS:

Documents from 12 Scientology organizations, all but one dated 1992, list
$275-million in assets. The church has holdings in real estate, stocks and
gold bullion, but by far its largest source of revenue appears to be
donations from its members and newcomers, who pay fees to undergo
Scientology's ascending series of personal evaluation, called auditing.

Exact figures remain elusive, however, because money flows freely among the
more than 30 Scientology organizations that received tax-exempt status from
the IRS this month. Their hierarchy is far from simple.

For example, the buildings in Clearwater house the church's spiritual
headquarters, known as the Flag Service Organization. It had assets last
year of $48-million and revenues of $74.3-million. Of those revenues,
$24.3-million was transferred to the &quot;mother church&quot; - the Church of
Scientology International in Los Angeles.

The mother church listed assets of $69-million in 1991. They were topped a
year later by the $92-million controlled by the International Association of
Scientologists, a &quot;support&quot; organization established to safeguard
Scientology and raise funds. It is based in Sussex, England.

Meanwhile, the church's top executive, David Miscavige, is paid by Religious
Technology Center, a $3.8-million organization that serves as &quot;protector of
the religion of Scientology&quot; and its logos and slogans.

If it seems confusing to an outsider, its lawyers explain that Scientology
is a &quot;very exact faith . . . (and) utmost importance is given to the precise
application of Dianetics and Scientology.&quot; In the hands of rivals, the
religion's trademarks could &quot;deny unwitting and well-intentioned individuals
the opportunity to experience the gains of real Dianetics and Scientology,
and thus ultimate spiritual salvation.&quot;

Easier to make out is where the church spends its money. In one document,
lawyers detail $205-million in spending from cash reserves across two years,
1987 and 1988. The total includes $30-million in legal bills, and
$3.4-million used to mount a Hollywood Boulevard exhibition on Hubbard's
life.

The church spent relatively little on good works. Its own statement of one
year's cash flow to organizations devoted to &quot;social betterment,&quot; such as
The Way to Happiness Foundation, totaled less than $9-million.
