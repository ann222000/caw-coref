As discussed by Gordon Holt in some interesting quotes published in the
December Stereophile, audio developments in recent years, which have
entailed the discarding of objective standards such as blind listening
comparisons, have in some respects reduced what used to be &quot;high
fidelity&quot; to voodoo science. As stated by Mr.Holt:

&quot;... &quot;good&quot; audio is now often defined as &quot;whatever one likes.&quot; And
since the only measure of sound quality is that the listener likes it,
that has pretty well put an end to audio advancement, because different
people rarely agree about sound quality. - Abandoning the acoustical
instrument standard, and the mindless acceptance of voodoo science, were
not a parts of my [Holt's] original vision.&quot;

Further:

&quot;As far as the real world is concerned, high-end audio lost its
credibility during the 1980's when it flatly refused to submit to the
kind of BASIC HONESTY CONTROLS (double blind blind testing, for example)
that had legitimized every other serious scientific endeavor since
Pascal. ..&quot; [emphasis added]

Anyone see any correlations between the characterizations of Mr. Holt
and opinions posted on rao by the anti-objectivists in recent years?

Sure. The &quot;anti-objectivists&quot; want to advance sound quality.

Why &quot;advance&quot; sound quality when everything already sounds the same?
We've hit the wall: 16-bit CDs, QSC amps and wire from Home Depot.
Audio nirvana, no sound advancement required.

So what are you bitching about?

I see clearly that much of high end audio has become a symbiosis of
audio charlatans and willing audio suckers. Pitchers and catchers.
Tops and bottoms. Both parties like it and resent anyone calling
bullshit as a, well, muuuuuuuusiccccphobe and an anti-nuanceite. ANd
they are not content to their aural perversion in private but DEMAND
thet EVERYONE ELSE KNOW and moreover, APPROVE OF their &quot;choices&quot;.

Outside of the ego-centric world of high end audio, the key to progress is
comparison of relevant performance measures to objective standards.

The high end audio approach to football would be to not keep score, but
instead ask the competing teams at the end of the game who felt they played
the better game.

The high end approach to fuel efficiency would be to ignore miles and
gallons, but rather ask the drivers whether they felt they had a driving
experience that made them feel that they were fuel-efficient.

In any endeavor, especially one beyond the basic survival needs, ego
is involved. I have a friend who at one point owned both a Lamborghini
and a Ferrari. I asked which one he liked better. His wife jumped in.
&quot;Lamborghini thinks everybody's ass is twelve inches wide!&quot; Her
husband preferred the Ferrari as well. They both *perform* well. Their
decision was not based on MPG, 0-60 times, skid pad tests, or any
other *objective* measurement.

Nice! You were able to insult anybody who likes listening to vinyl or

You are The Master of ridicule. You have destroyed audio discussion on
this group. Who, for example, wants to &quot;admit&quot; to liking the sound of
tubes or vinyl, for example, and face the crap you poop on the group
in response? I remember when I was first here I mentioned that I own
several thousand LPs. I explained why I listen to them, which was a
logical decision. I did not claim that they &quot;sounded better&quot;, nor did
I make any other claim. Yet I became a &quot;vinyl bigot&quot; and I was
ridiculed by you. There wasn't even a cue for this attack on
preference. You just regurgitated it out of habit, I suppose. Who
wants to admit to being so stupid as to buy an overpriced Krell amp?

As I said: everything else is 'solved'. The room can be treated to an
extent, but often the only recourse is a different room, so all we are
really left with to discuss is speakers. So can we assume that you'll
stay out of any discussion not concerning speakers, or will you
continue to ridicule those who have different preferences?

Maybe you could come up with a FAQ: Here is what is OK, here is what

&gt; &quot;Lamborghini thinks everybody's ass is twelve inches wide!&quot; Her

Not necessarily. But they have a lot of specific excess wealth. And
it is a fact the Ferrari and Lamborghini are not very good cars in
some ways. Traditionally reliability of both was poor.

I find Mr. Holt's remarks arrogant and frustrating.

For example, this comment below from him is so meaningless and
non-sensical that I wonder if his internal organs has begun to self-digest
his own brain in lieu of his advancing age.

&quot;... &quot;good&quot; audio is now often defined as &quot;whatever one likes.&quot; And
since the only measure of sound quality is that the listener likes it,
that has pretty well put an end to audio advancement, because different
people rarely agree about sound quality. - Abandoning the acoustical

were not a parts of my [Holt's] original vision.&quot;

He seems to correlate personal taste as a means to put an end to
audio advancement.  Only someone with 2 ounce waffle-head like
Howard Ferstler would make that type of pronouncement.  Perhaps
Mr. Ferstler paid him a visit and put his tools to good use.

I apologes about my comment with regard to his head though, it's one
of those spur of the moment deals.

In any case, you did share an interest with regards to what we think
about Mr. Holt's commentary.

At some point in the ladder of ascending performance, reliability becomes
less important. Nobody buys Ferraris because they have 12,000 mile oil

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

If anybody's forgotten, duh-Scottie has never, ever undergone any DBTs
of consumer audio equipment. That's a grand total of zero &quot;tests&quot; for
Yapper. Which is to say that he has yet to participate in his very first
DBT of audio gear.

Furthermore, Scottie has never witnessed a single DBT of consumer audio
gear. Nor has he learned how to design such &quot;tests&quot;. And on top of that,
Witless isn't smart enough to understand that no DBT procedures exist
for casual use by consumers that have been proven reliable.

If anybody wanted to know what Scottie's discernment is like, they could
drop by his house and listen to his precious Quad system (assuming
there's room around the pool table in the low-ceilinged basement). Or,
failing a trip to ScottieWorld, they could inquire of certain RAOers who
have already been there and done that.

Who cares? The level of performance is legally limited. Around here,

ticket for cornering too fast.

&gt;&gt; Bingo...nothing wrong with that.  I've heard more technically

&gt;&gt; They just left me flat.....

No. But objectivism isn't only DBTs.
I wouldn't know the speakers were technically flatter without
objective measurements.

Scott may suffer from 'inadvertent self influence'. Certainly what he
says on political issues is riddled with bias. And fear. And
prejudice.

To summarize, you &quot;support&quot; the space station by drawing two lines in
the form of an 'X' once in a blue moon.

So how do you support DBTs....
Bleating like a sheep?

By saying this...they have legitimate applications in the development of
audio equipment and technology and could provide useful information
to consumers if added to audio reviews.

Thank-you for providing this opportunity to show my support for
DBTs..
