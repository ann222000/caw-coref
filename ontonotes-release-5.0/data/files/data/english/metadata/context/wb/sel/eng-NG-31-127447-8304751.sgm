If DM stepped aside or moved off the top role, either disgraced or
jailed or just defects, my thoughts are Scientologists would REGROUP.

I think their future after DM will be sort of like communism after
Stalin, it'll go on for another decade or two, disintegrating
gradually until Scientology turns into what the free zone is now.  I
think how communism disintegrated is how things will move forward.
I'm being optimistic, I think it will actually drag on longer range,
and mainly due to the fact of LRH leaving behind such massive amounts
of detailed writings for them to follow.

I think the speed of that transition is influenced greatly by the
personalities of whomever is leading the movement.

A tyrannical DM type turns the movement into a Mussolini type setup
for the time slot that a personality like DM is running the place.

But once the DM tyrant leadership role model type steps aside or falls
from the top role, unlike fascism, Scientology has a more extensive
body of writings for the members to be guided by in regrouping after
the fall of one of their tyrant leaders.

Hubbard's prolific administrative writings detail for all the various
top echelon bureaucratic sub-units.

I don't think Lenin and Marx wrote as prolifically as Hubbard did
about the bureaucratic day to day operations.   Hubbard wrote a huge
body of administrative writings that have a whole huge impact on the
longevity of this movement.

Hubbard's administrative writings detail how the Scientology
franchises should operate down to the minutia, and how the top
echelons bureaucratic units should operate as well.   He wrote on the
whole setup, top to bottom, in detail, over several decades, tweaking
the whole setup into what they are left with today.

So, regardless of the behavior of the periodic  DM tyrant types, or
the incompetence of whoever does the top level managing.   LRH's
revered administrative guideline writings are the marching orders for
whoever finds themselves in the bewildering world of the top ranks
administratively of this movement.

Hubbard's Executive Strata (ED Int and his 11 or so senior ranking
subordinates, all of whom are NOT on post at the moment, the Exec
Strata isn't even manned per report), but the point is LRH ordered
pretty extensively and in detail how this &quot;think tank&quot; (my term) top
ranks bureaucracy was to operate to the movement's benefit.   Watchdog
Committee similarly, there are orders from Hubbard on what its
functions are, so as soon as people step up once DM's gone, they'll
turn to Hubbard's orders absolutely for how to carry on.

Scientology's administrators do NOT turn to the outside world's
(freezone's or critic observer's) advice.

Hubbard's writings ensure there is no dialogue between outside
observers and the internal leadership.

I have wanted to encourage former Scientology leaders to comment
however they can, just to add in their thoughts in hindsight.

The point, I don't think the members left holding the bag after DM is
out of the picture, those members WON'T be turning to the outside
world (freezone or critics) for advice.

So unfortunately, realistically how to change the course of the
Scientology movement is a taking on, point by point, the major
downside writings of Hubbard, and force the movement into a dialogue
regarding those downside points, over and over.

Because it is LRH's writings that DM's replacements will looking at to
decide what to do next after DM.

The people who replace DM  who will reform the Executive Strata and
Watchdog Committee positions and do what LRH ordered decades ago for
those echelons.   They will go to LRH's writings and lectures for what
to do to solve the problems they face.

I urge the former top members to comment on the strategies they know
LRH had ordered for the &quot;sectors&quot; that Watchdog Committee oversees,
and also I hope former Executive Strata members also comment.

Definitely.  I think that the corporate entity would survive, and

Very interesting speculation.  In the event that DM went away as in
&quot;went away to prison&quot; I doubt he would go alone.  It takes more than
one person to run an operation as big as this.  I would think, much
like the last time, it would be at least a half dozen or more that
would go with him.  As far as what would happen to the CoS I agree it
would go on in one form or another.  Although it would still be a con,
without the criminal activity and violation of human rights it would
probably be a very successful one.

There is one major difference between the CoS and the former Soviet
Union.  The CoS has hundreds of millions of dollars in assets.  The
main reason the Soviet Union failed was that it was bankrupt.  The
real damage to them would be to lose their tax exemption, which I
believe is inevitable.  The special status given the CoS by their IRS
settlement, especially the clause that denies the same status to any
other church, is bound to be challenged in court sooner or later.  The
settlement was reached after the IRS had gone all the way to the
supreme court and won.  It was obviously not based on the law but on
the IRS wanting peace with the CoS.  They tried to keep it secret for
the very reason that it is unconstitutional on the face of it.

There is a real &quot;catch 22&quot; however.  In the recent law suite by the
Jewish couple trying to get the same deal for the money they spent on
yeshiva school for their kids the court ruled that the law clearly was
against them.  When they brought up the CoS the judge said they should
sue the IRS to stop them from giving the CoS what the court had ruled
was an illegal tax break.  The problem with this is that whoever filed
such a suit would get nothing for themselves and so it would take a
person or group that had altruistic motives, such as the Lisa
McPherson Trust.  We all saw what a fight they put up against a
wrongful death suite that could have been settled for some millions of
dollars.  I can only imagine the legal battle that would ensue when
their very existence as a church was challenged.

Still, I believe sooner or later it will be tried.  If a group of
established churches were to sue that would preclude the CoS from
using their anti-religion smear tactics.  I also believe the resulting
publicity would finally wake people up to what a rotten deal the IRS
made.  On every occasion I have discussed this with someone I have had
to refer them to the Internet before they would believe it.  I also
believe the IRS itself would not be fighting that hard to win.  There
were a lot of disgruntled career IRS types last go around and I
believe they are the ones who leaked the details of the agreement to
the press.

Even this would not be the end of scientology.  They still operate as
a business in several countries and they only have to pay taxes on
their profits which would still be substantial.  Without the cover of
religion however the government would be all over them like white on
rice and they would at least have to clean up their act.

That depends Chuck on who actually &quot;owns&quot; the assets and cash salted
away.   If it was found that DM had actually full personal control
over these then there would be a major collapse.  A free fall into the
FZ but a huge number of devotees would fall away like they did when DM
staged his coup.

It would be a wake up call to many and just the excuse they would
accept to leave.  Like many I joined the FZ (in fact I was in ground 0
of the movement) but as time went by &quot;normality&quot; took over and I
accepted Darwin as my new master.  One could say the ep  of my OT3 was
a case state of atheism!!

Gosh I wish the collapse will happen soon - all those people wasting
their lives on a crock of shit.  Worse some are actually being harmed.

Agreed. Yank that tax exemption. Quit letting them pose as a religion to
justify their antisocial behavior. Make them pay taxes. (that could help
Clearwater a lot!) And, most importantly, stop allowing them to misuse
the courts. Joel Phillips owes a lot of people for the lies he promotes
on his RFW pages. Payback time is gonna be tasty. :)

&gt;&gt; The problems is that this cannot stand up to the changes in electronic

&gt;&gt; update or be eclipsed by the FZ (which is how I think it will go down.

Certainly, yank the tax exemption. It was fraudulently acquired,
lacks legal merit and was specifically rejected by the Supreme

And, even so, they have and continue to violated the terms

Yes, of course. Just like that happy little woodchuck, Rustle Shaw,
wasn't responsible for the SPL website.

Still, Joel's name is on it, so he is going to have to shoulder the
responsibility for it. Taking responsibility is a big deal in
Scientology. Gonna be fun watching him do it.

Wallets are also important in Scientology, and, Joel's isn't
*nearly* fat enough to be 'responsible' for RFW.

Give credit where credit is due.

give this read, first Chuck,
http://www.lermanet.com/exit/CST-miscavige-and-satanism.htm

then consider if this scenario, makes sense, the following is a
sanitized email between me and an ex

Arnie,
Hubbard may have encouraged and authorized d.m. to appoint Suzette as
his maid in a weird attempt to get the two sexually involved, after
which d.m.would presumably dump Shelly and marry Suzette, thereby
legitimizing his future status as scientology dictator for life. He
would have been in the Hubbard family. Hubbard's &quot;genius&quot; backfired
however, because Suzette disliked the dwarf and routed out of the S.O.
I ought to write a booklet with a sepia tinted photo of Hubbard on the
cover wearing a goofy smile titled, &quot;Ron the Matchmaker&quot;.

0 interesting, thanks, I had not considered that....considering herr
0 dwarf's birthday matches CST, hitler and witches day
0 Suzette was the only one who would stand up to dad
0 i was clueless - totally f**king clueless - at that time... when
she
0 would ask me &quot;Arnie, aren't you afraid of  my dad ?&quot;

For a moment,  I descended into Hubbard's point of view. What other
more devious way could he fix his daughter up with his protege' than
have Suzette appointed as his &quot;maid&quot;?  D.M. would make trips to LA,
away from Shelly, and his maid would be there to take care of him.
D.M. gets involved with a vivacious redhead at his PAC condo and loses
interest in the scrawny blonde in Hemet.  &quot;Let nature take its course&quot;
was Hubbard's thought. D.M. tosses Shelly away like a used condom and
the dwarf now has more credibility for being married to a Hubbard.
Trouble was, Hubbard's mind and the real world operate differently.
Suzette was not the robot Hubbard presumed that she was. Suzette
bailed from the Sea Org rather than be a slave to the dwarf.

&gt; If DM stepped aside or moved off the top role, either disgraced or
&gt; jailed or just defects, my thoughts are Scientologists would REGROUP.

&gt; I think their future after DM will be sort of like communism after
&gt; Stalin, it'll go on for another decade or two, disintegrating
&gt; gradually until Scientology turns into what the free zone is now.  I
&gt; think how communism disintegrated is how things will move forward.
&gt; I'm being optimistic, I think it will actually drag on longer range,
&gt; and mainly due to the fact of LRH leaving behind such massive amounts
&gt; of detailed writings for them to follow.

&gt; I think the speed of that transition is influenced greatly by the
&gt; personalities of whomever is leading the movement.

&gt; A tyrannical DM type turns the movement into a Mussolini type setup
&gt; for the time slot that a personality like DM is running the place.

&gt; But once the DM tyrant leadership role model type steps aside or falls
&gt; from the top role, unlike fascism, Scientology has a more extensive
&gt; body of writings for the members to be guided by in regrouping after
&gt; the fall of one of their tyrant leaders.

&gt; Hubbard's prolific administrative writings detail for all the various
&gt; top echelon bureaucratic sub-units.

&gt; I don't think Lenin and Marx wrote as prolifically as Hubbard did
&gt; about the bureaucratic day to day operations.   Hubbard wrote a huge
&gt; body of administrative writings that have a whole huge impact on the
&gt; longevity of this movement.

&gt; Hubbard's administrative writings detail how the Scientology
&gt; franchises should operate down to the minutia, and how the top
&gt; echelons bureaucratic units should operate as well.   He wrote on the
&gt; whole setup, top to bottom, in detail, over several decades, tweaking
&gt; the whole setup into what they are left with today.

&gt; So, regardless of the behavior of the periodic  DM tyrant types, or
&gt; the incompetence of whoever does the top level managing.   LRH's
&gt; revered administrative guideline writings are the marching orders for
&gt; whoever finds themselves in the bewildering world of the top ranks
&gt; administratively of this movement.

&gt; Hubbard's Executive Strata (ED Int and his 11 or so senior ranking
&gt; subordinates, all of whom are NOT on post at the moment, the Exec
&gt; Strata isn't even manned per report), but the point is LRH ordered
&gt; pretty extensively and in detail how this &quot;think tank&quot; (my term) top
&gt; ranks bureaucracy was to operate to the movement's benefit.   Watchdog
&gt; Committee similarly, there are orders from Hubbard on what its
&gt; functions are, so as soon as people step up once DM's gone, they'll
&gt; turn to Hubbard's orders absolutely for how to carry on.

&gt; Scientology's administrators do NOT turn to the outside world's
&gt; (freezone's or critic observer's) advice.

&gt; Hubbard's writings ensure there is no dialogue between outside
&gt; observers and the internal leadership.

&gt; I have wanted to encourage former Scientology leaders to comment
&gt; however they can, just to add in their thoughts in hindsight.

&gt; The point, I don't think the members left holding the bag after DM is
&gt; out of the picture, those members WON'T be turning to the outside
&gt; world (freezone or critics) for advice.

&gt; So unfortunately, realistically how to change the course of the
&gt; Scientology movement is a taking on, point by point, the major
&gt; downside writings of Hubbard, and force the movement into a dialogue
&gt; regarding those downside points, over and over.

&gt; Because it is LRH's writings that DM's replacements will looking at to
&gt; decide what to do next after DM.

&gt; The people who replace DM  who will reform the Executive Strata and
&gt; Watchdog Committee positions and do what LRH ordered decades ago for
&gt; those echelons.   They will go to LRH's writings and lectures for what
&gt; to do to solve the problems they face.

&gt; I urge the former top members to comment on the strategies they know
&gt; LRH had ordered for the &quot;sectors&quot; that Watchdog Committee oversees,
&gt; and also I hope former Executive Strata members also comment.

One aspect of the changing of the guard is that the membership sees
whether they have a voice or not in the process. If they don't, then
it will piss off some members for being treated like sheep.  If they
do, then they will enjoy the power of input they have in how their
church is run and will want more say so in what's being done.

&gt; That depends Chuck on who actually &quot;owns&quot; the assets and cash salted

&gt; over these then there would be a major collapse.

There is someone else in possession of the moies and accounts, either the
IRS itself through its attorney/CST major guy - either though the ASI other
major, so, that would not be the point. The point would rather be : who will
