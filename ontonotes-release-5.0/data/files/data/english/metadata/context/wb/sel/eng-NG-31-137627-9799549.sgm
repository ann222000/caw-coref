SOME COMMENTS ON MATTHEW GALKIN'S 'I AM AN ANIMAL'
by Lee Hall

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Ingrid Newkirk is president of People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals (PETA), and Newkirk's personality drives the film I Am an
Animal1 -- starting with the first word of its title. During the
course of filming, director Matthew Galkin comes to see Newkirk as
operating &quot;on a different plane than anyone I've ever met&quot;, adding,
for example, &quot;I don't think Ingrid needs the same kind of
relationships in her life that I, or most people, do.&quot; 2

The story begins with an undercover case against a primate lab in
Maryland, in which activists gave the police evidence of filth and
untreated wounds, a prosecution was mounted. This got attention, the
film explains, &quot;like no other anti-cruelty group had done&quot;. Newkirk,
who previously worked as a Maryland law enforcement officer and a
director of animal cruelty investigations in Washington, D.C., had
found a calling. PETA was born.

Early in the film Newkirk invokes the day when everyone will think
animals are not ours to eat, wear or experiment on, using a famous
phrase that PETA's founders apparently borrowed from the British Union
of the Abolition of Vivisection, whose simple magazines and
straightforward slogans PETA closely mimicked in the early eighties.
By the nineties, PETA went glossy, and the use of celebrities and high-
profile media stunts became its hallmark. And that's what attracted
Matthew Galkin to make this film. &quot;PETA is aggressive and its
marketing tactics are obscene and offensive to a lot of people. Yet
Ingrid has grown PETA into the largest animal rights group in the
world.&quot;3 But are Galkin's subjects prepared to tell us what &quot;animal
rights&quot; is?

&quot;Ingrid just has the philosophy, this mantra: She feels that there's
no such thing as bad press&quot;, says Alex Pacheco, who co-founded PETA
with Newkirk in 1980 but left in 1999. &quot;Today the mission has become
diffuse, and really watered down by what I call stupid human tricks.&quot;
And Galkin's film includes plenty of media clips to illustrate the
point: garish stunts including a campaign suggesting college students
replace milk with beer. After seeing PETA's blood-drenched photos on
lunchboxes handed out to children, a parent asks, &quot;Do I have the right
to hit them if they frighten my children?&quot;

&quot;Everything that has turned you off about PETA has come directly from
Ingrid&quot;, states Pacheco, who says the shock value draws attention, but
it's attention to &quot;the fact that it's outrageous.&quot;

&quot;I regret it,&quot; Newkirk counters, &quot;But if you switch on the nightly
news, everything is reduced to the tiny sound bite. Everybody is
obsessed with sex and obsessed with violence&quot; and thus PETA's choice
&quot;is no attention or some attention.&quot; And if they don't get attention,
&quot;nobody will know there is an animal-rights movement.&quot; (The words &quot;it
works&quot; and &quot;no other tactic works&quot; recur throughout the film.) But
PETA has pursued sexist advertising zealously, with spectacles such as
a Penthouse model &quot;tofu-wrestling&quot; in a tub of bean curd, and
campaigns director Dan Mathews telling the Washington Times: &quot;Playboy
is helping us put the 'T &amp; A' in PETA.&quot;4

The example Galkin presents is PETA's video Milk Gone Wild, a rejected
Super Bowl advertisement trading on the idea of female college
students on display for their male peers. (This milk-related campaign
is clearly geared to young viewers: &quot;You won't BELIEVE what we've
packed into this video! You'll see the HOTTEST girls baring it all --
AND MORE!!! No rules, no parents, no limits, and of course no cows.&quot;)
Priscilla Feral, president of Friends of Animals, sees PETA staffers
as driven to get attention by any means, paraphrasing a term of
Newkirk's own: press sluts. &quot;Is that how you get a society to respect
animals?&quot; asks Feral. &quot;I don't think it does a thing for animals.&quot;

Abraham Foxman, president of the Anti Defamation League, discusses
PETA's &quot;Holocaust on Your Plate&quot; campaign. &quot;This was so hurtful. This
was not only hurtful to survivors, but it was hurtful to -- just
decent people. It trivialized what the Holocaust was all about.&quot;
Foxman points out that the Holocaust planners had a deliberate,
genocidal &quot;strategy to destroy and eliminate the Jewish people from
the face of the earth.&quot; Foxman then seems to make a personal statement
by saying that the parallel to animal agribusiness -- insofar as it
involves strong feelings about cruelty -- is understandable to draw,
and that's &quot;fine&quot;. But then Foxman asks, &quot;Is this the only way to
express animal advocacy?&quot; Not an unfair query; but Newkirk dismisses
critics of the Holocaust campaign, saying &quot;we must get over ourselves
and not live in the past&quot;.

Next, Newkirk and a half-dozen staffers review staffer Dawn Carr's
proposal for PETA's Animal Liberation (&quot;Are Animals the New Slaves?&quot;)
display, juxtaposing pictures of a hoisted steer and a lynching. A
media relations staffer, obviously aware of the Holocaust outcry (but
somehow not extrapolating that concern to the African-American
perspective), asks if the slavery exhibition should avoid the use of
Holocaust images. Newkirk says no, especially not if they happened to
find a &quot;super-duper one&quot;.

Dr. James Cameron, aged 91 when PETA launched the New Slaves tour,
founded America's Black Holocaust Museum. Cameron escaped a lynching
after he and two friends were falsely accused of murder in Marion,
Indiana, in 1930. &quot;I just cannot believe they would do this,&quot; the
museum's director said. &quot;Dr. Cameron was supposed to have been the
third man in this picture.&quot;5 Thus did the inner circle of PETA
staffers create a spectacle with pictures of slaves and other
exploited individuals, and reproduce the depersonalization of subjects
who weren't asked to authorize such reproduction. An African-American
organizer campaigned to flood PETA's faxes, writing, &quot;I'd like to see
someone write a point-by-point response to that form-letter pap
they're mailing back to people, because obviously they have few, if
any, politically educated people in their ranks.&quot;6

Community response to PETA's New Slaves tour is not covered in I Am an
Animal; but Priscilla Feral observes, &quot;They have exploited racism and
women in campaigns, using people as props to project animal rights,
and you can't do that. You can't sensationalize an issue involving a
lot of pain, a racist issue for example, and expect to advance an
ethical cause in doing so.&quot;

Some defenders of these atrocity exhibitions have denounced as
&quot;speciesist&quot; those who've objected. At the same time they're defending
people whose campaign against KFC insists that chickens should not be
electrocuted but, for humane reasons, gassed instead. In a world where
we all grow up with the idea that humanity is unique in some way,
tossing around accusations of species bias is hardly creative
advocacy. Moreover, by its disinterest in the views of those advancing
other social causes, PETA enables the perennial belittlement of its
own.

The White Dog

Newkirk tells the filmmakers &quot;I believe in being decent to people&quot;;
yet most viewers will find something they do incurring Newkirk's
express disdain. Including many who do animal-protection work.
Newkirk, whose oceanfront flat is not home to any animals, says people
&quot;should work to help them&quot; and not &quot;accumulate them&quot;. This disregards
the needs of animals who are put into peril, or positions of
dependence, because of human actions. They are our refugees, our
asylum seekers. To them, the most critical help is food and shelter.
Advocates who provide for the well-being of dependent animals become
ethical models -- both in their dedication to the individuals whose
cause they're entrusted to champion, and in their intervention in the
breed-and-kill cycle that produces animals as disposable commodities
in the first place. If an advocate declines this responsibility,
however, basic decency would involve supporting -- certainly not
disparaging -- those who accept it.

The filming goes out on the road, headed for North Carolina. Newkirk
doubles back on the roadside to inspect the body of &quot;a dove that's
probably dead but I have to have a look, because I never trust that
they are. Dead! So where were we?&quot;

The car pulls into a park of rust-streaked mobile homes. &quot;There are
occasions when I really have almost done physical damage to people&quot;,
Newkirk recalls, describing a childhood trip out of Britain and into
India, where, she says, a man was beating a bull in the street and put
a stick up the animal's rectum, causing the animal to scream and
collapse. &quot;I was just filled with so much anger and panic to stop this
from happening to this being,&quot; Newkirk says. &quot;And I tore the stick
away from him; I was only about 8 1/2, probably, and I made him kneel
down. I was just filled with rage. And this rage that is my father's
rage just came up straight inside me and he knew that he's lucky I
didn't kill him.&quot;

Newkirk approaches a badly underfed, white dog. &quot;You look like a sorry
soul.&quot; Newkirk quizzes the owner quickly, several times interrupting
the answers, gives the dog a bowl of food, and tells the owner, a soft-
spoken person with dreadlocks, that the dog has a serious case of
worms. After offering the owner free veterinary care -- &quot;We have to
sign him over for that. Let me get my clipboard&quot; -- Newkirk removes
the dog.

In the van, Newkirk comments, &quot;He's just a thing. He's one more thing
that they have, I think. Sort of a passing nice idea, you've got
yourself a pet. But the reality of care is -- not understood.&quot; Yet the
ultimate proof that a being is a &quot;thing&quot; is when somebody can destroy
it. And this is exactly what Newkirk proceeds to do.

The white dog waits in a glass room, where there appears to be at
least one other animal.

&quot;So what's the verdict?&quot; Newkirk asks Daphna Nachminovitch, PETA's
director of domestic animal welfare. Presumably Nachminovitch is
reading from a vet's report, yet there is no evidence of a vet
actually seeing this dog.

Heartworm-positive, reports Nachminovitch. An abnormal red blood cell
count.

As Newkirk looks on, Nachminovitch is on the phone, telling the owner
they've discovered heartworm disease. &quot;And so that requires some
pretty aggressive treatment. You know, I want to talk to you about
putting the dog to sleep.&quot;

Newkirk adds: &quot;I think he should go down right away.

If you look at him, he really looks miserable,&quot; says Newkirk, with a
brisk, throat-cutting gesture. &quot;His whole face looks miserable. So
will you?&quot;

Nachminovitch says, &quot;I can see the pain in his eyes.&quot;

&quot;Will you?&quot; Newkirk asks Nachminovitch.

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

The camera shows the face of an apparently calm, comforted dog.

Newkirk says, &quot;I think I'm like a child who was raised by wolves.&quot; She
speaks of the dog who had the role of her childhood companion and
sibling: &quot;You come to understand them, and they don't have to say
anything to for you to know what they're feeling.&quot; Sounding uncannily
like Temple Grandin, a slaughterhouse designer who suffers from autism
and claims this permits an understanding of animals' feelings, Newkirk
speaks of being able to imagine herself going through &quot;exactly&quot; what
animals are going through.

No one from PETA tries to communicate with the person in the mobile
home in more than the authoritative language of the expert assuming
control. Nor do we see any hint of PETA going to the root of the
matter: breeding and trading in dogs. The messages in this scene?
Those who don't treat dogs well shouldn't have them. Animal advocates
perform a lethal kind of sanitation role. As Priscilla Feral said
after the film's HBO premiere, &quot;It's not an animal rights message, but
a reduce-the-suffering, kill them gently overall thrust, and that
defines PETA's regulatory approach to exploitation.&quot;

&quot;My first euthanasia experience&quot;, Newkirk remembers, was taking a
group of abandoned kittens to a shelter, believing they'd be homed,
later to learn the reality. &quot;Obviously I had betrayed them. I'd taken
them to this place, and they'd been killed.&quot; But that impression
changed. &quot;Sometimes, euthanasia is a gift... I had to study how to do it
properly, because we weren't taught to do it properly in the shelter
where I started.&quot; Newkirk reports having seen animals stabbed &quot;with a
needle that had never been changed -- in a long time, and it had barbs
on it and so on. And the animals would thrash about... It was like a
slaughterhouse.&quot;

Without actually saying that PETA's policies drive the roundups and
systematic &quot;euthanasia&quot; of animals now well into five-figure numbers,
the filmmaker asks, &quot;Why did you take it upon yourself to do it,
though?&quot; Replies Newkirk, &quot;Because I didn't want them to experience
that, and -- well, I just knew that if I came in early, and made a
clean place for them, and brought them out as if they were going for a
walk, and did it kindly, they wouldn't know.&quot;

Galkin spent two years directing the film, and apparently never had
reason to think that animal control and animal rights are two distinct
concepts:

Obviously, the dog's situation was horrible, but watching Ingrid
scurrying about, sweeping up dog shit, feeding someone else's animal,
I felt her sadness and desperation that day like I hadn't felt before.
She's the head of the largest animal rights organization in the world,
and here she is, spending her day dealing with one neglected dog in
North Carolina...7

And this misses one of the film's most striking and disturbing
messages. Although Newkirk thinks sheltering animals detracts from
advocacy, going out on interstate rounds to find and possibly kill
them is not subject to that same objection. The filmmaker's primary
sympathy is for Newkirk, not the dog; not the person in the mobile
home park, whose situation is also bleak yet who might be open to new
understandings, if treated as a person. What did the filmmakers learn
from Newkirk about animal rights or movement building?

The Killing Floor

Newkirk states that PETA's &quot;main goal is to stop suffering, as much
suffering as we possibly can&quot; but never distinguishes animal suffering
that happens as biological fact from that which happens as a result of
deliberate human activity. Yet this distinction is critical, for pain
is a natural mechanism and to eliminate it all would be to destroy
every single bit of conscious life on earth. Would the reduction of
suffering be the key point if we lived in a society that respected
animals' interests in living on their own terms in their own habitat?
The film fails to tell of the real world of animals' interests and
animal-rights advocacy, within Newkirk's hearing but beyond her ken.
When a staffer shows Newkirk footage of a person in Oklahoma hitting
tigers, Newkirk first says, &quot;Do we have more of this?&quot; and then stops
short. &quot;I am deeply worried,&quot; Newkirk says, &quot;because we keep doing
these investigations into exotics, and it's all worthwhile ... but the
one thing that everybody needs to get involved in is empathy with the
animals they eat and don't think twice about&quot; rather than bears and
tigers. The Thanksgiving holiday is coming, Newkirk adds, and &quot;we
absolutely need an investigation inside a turkey slaughterhouse or a
turkey factory farm.&quot; Then, seemingly lumping all undomesticated
animals into the classification of &quot;cute&quot;, Newkirk says, &quot;All animals
feel -- not just the cute ones with the big eyes, not the fluffy
bears, and the smiley dolphins, but all the animals.&quot;

True, but the point of animal rights isn't to ensure nonhuman beings
feel better in captivity. It involves opting out of animal
agribusiness, not reforming it; it means advocating for the interests
of free-living animals and defending the habitat they require to
experience their lives. In the midst of today's world, with its
melting ice caps and extinctions, nearly every aspect of Newkirk's
focus is gravely obsolete.

&quot;No one is going behind the scenes. Who would want to go into these
ugly places?&quot;

Mary Beth Sweetland, director of the research and investigations
department, approaches a young employee. &quot;I've been talking to Bruce
about you for quite a while. And I know you're really valued down in
the campaigns department. But we've got a big investigation planned.
It's the ConAgra slaughterhouse and they provide Butterball with
turkeys.&quot;

The young campaigner's head is shaved into a military buzz. But once
on the killing floor -- where, from 5.45 a.m. to 5 or 5.30 p.m., a
four-person team works the shackles to process some 50,000 birds every
day -- Chris is utterly unable to run the hidden camera. Thus,
Galkin's is the only crew to tape cruelty during the two months Chris
descends into despair. &quot;I saw a turkey get sexually abused before it
died today&quot;, Chris tells the filmmakers. About filming this part,
Galkin has said: &quot;I secretly want drama and I want everything to go
haywire because it's potentially good for the film, but when it does,
it's difficult to watch people suffering though the lens of a
camera.&quot;8

Like those of the soldier who declines to shoot, Chris's constant
technical failures suggest a gut resistance to an active role in
violence.9 To Sweetland, they mean a job undone. Sweetland approaches
Newkirk, who is typing an e-mail. &quot;Thank you for your favorable review
of Making Kind Choices...&quot; Newkirk is told of the lack of footage,
Chris's battery-charge failures.

&quot;He was told exactly what went into this job. It's not a picnic, it's
not a walk in the park; he was told&quot;, Newkirk replies.

&quot;We can't afford to just lollygag around with some young person who
can't get their act together...Mary Beth, you've got to come down on him
like a ton of bricks.&quot;

Newkirk replaces Chris, saying to Galkin's camera: &quot;I could do it
myself so I know it's doable.&quot; By failing to produce what Newkirk
wants, &quot;he's screwing the birds over.&quot; But the inability to just
follow orders and observe atrocity with a lifeless, electronic eye is
to Chris's credit, and it's disturbing to watch this young person on
the verge of breakdown with no one around to help. In Chris's failure,
perhaps we see where the real hope for the end of war-like treatment
of the Other -- human or not.

A more experienced infiltrator is deployed. At the headquarters, they
watch Jay's footage. Mary Beth Sweetland says, &quot;I like this, Jay,
following this truck. Those animals are just crammed so tightly in
those cages.&quot; A close-up. &quot;Look at them panting, and this is in June,
when it was cooler.&quot;

Jay documents the workers grabbing the birds as &quot;innumerable bones&quot;
are broken.

We hear Newkirk exclaim, &quot;He's just throwing them!&quot;

When a staffer asks whether Chris's notes and sworn statement will
carry any weight in court versus the more reliable video evidence,
Newkirk says they'll use all &quot;we possibly can just hang onto by a
straw&quot; in order to build a case that the plant has offended state
cruelty law and the Poultry Inspection Act. A press conference begins.
Arkansas law, Newkirk points out, deems anyone engaging in &quot;cruel
mistreatment or neglect&quot; guilty of animal cruelty, defined to include
causing &quot;unjustifiable&quot; pain. Whereas Newkirk says footage of abuse
has the potential to change the world, the group doesn't challenge the
agricultural use of birds or animals generally; the idea here is to
score a victory with a &quot;big&quot; company, and on the grounds that workers
in the investigated plant have inflicted &quot;gratuitous&quot; harm. Butterball
assures PETA that if there is any abuse found, they'll fire the
employees responsible. &quot;I wouldn't hold your breath 'til you turn
blue&quot;, Newkirk tells the camera -- without a word, now, about the goal
of &quot;total animal liberation&quot; asserted earlier in the film.10

Not surprisingly, activists on the street convey a mixed message:
&quot;Like a free DVD?&quot; &quot;Boycott Butterball; we found them molesting birds
at a processing plant in Ozark.&quot; &quot;Go vegetarian this holiday, but at
the least don't support Butterball.&quot; Similarly, in lab investigations,
we see no critiques of, say, language studies. Instead, we see &quot;hell
holes&quot; where monkeys are used in experiments guaranteed to make an
audience squirm, animals' skulls being crushed, skinned heads,
breeders hitting animals with guns. PETA goes in &quot;to stop suffering&quot;
-- again, a distinct concept from &quot;total animal liberation&quot; -- and the
film takes no note of the incongruity.

The investigator receives approval to rescue a turkey who falls from a
truck, and whom Newkirk receives and puts in a room at the PETA
headquarters, with a heap of straw and a radio playing. &quot;Look at those
little, tiny ears. We'll get you some water.&quot; The scene has a weird,
fetishistic quality in a setting where so many animals are processed
into lifeless bodies. Like the U.S. president who &quot;pardons&quot; a single
turkey on Thanksgiving Day, here's Newkirk, who can order the demise
of an animal at any minute, saving one bewildered bird. Commenting on
the turkey's lucky day, Newkirk leaves the bird at a refuge -- run,
one must assume, run by the accumulators previously mentioned.

Strategic Opportunities

Newkirk hugs a designer who promises to use no wool in the coming
season. Is Marc Bouwer preferring the bouquet Newkirk brought to a pie
in the face, a takeover of a runway, or a dead animal dropped in the
middle of a perfectly set table? Or is the commitment based on
principle? The answer is evident when Bouwer qualifies the vow as
meaning products of the Australian Wool Industry -- a particular
business PETA has targeted in a lawsuit. &quot;We definitely won't use wool
from Australia, that's for sure!&quot;

But then there's Jean Paul Gaultier. The video cover -- with a fur-
clad Newkirk behind a glass window, drenched hands smearing red fluid
over the pane -- depicts a protest at Gaultier's boutique in which
PETA protesters smear the storefront with fake blood. Dan Mathews sees
the Paris shop, with its furs and large windows, as a &quot;great target&quot;
and Newkirk agrees: &quot;We want to take over those windows.&quot; They get to
Paris, film crew in tow, and Newkirk leads a rehearsal. Mathews wants
to speed the entrance of Newkirk's entourage of protesters; Newkirk
wants to browse alone for a few minutes. A brief squabble ensues, with
Newkirk sure of the plan, and Mathews sceptical. While Newkirk
impatiently restores the dominance hierarchy, we see Mathews doing
what other staffers aren't: openly second-guessing Newkirk.

The manager locks the protesters into the shop as Mathews sprays the
windows, holding a sign (&quot;Death for Sale&quot;) printed in English. Newkirk
wears a t-shirt saying Fur Is Dead. Pedestrians pause to watch this
rather surreal exhibition until the group -- covered in dye and
chanting (in French) &quot;Gaultier, murderer!&quot; -- is hauled away by the
Paris police.

Back in the U.S., the authorities are increasingly treating as
&quot;terrorism&quot; any actions that disrupt the affairs of businesses that
rely on animals and products derived from them; and as the film points
out, PETA has already been the subject of FBI investigations into
possible ties to the militant Animal Liberation Front. Pacheco says
&quot;everything the ALF does, by definition, is illegal&quot; so &quot;you'd be a
fool to admit&quot; working with them.

A videotape of a fire-damaged building appears. In other footage, a
Columbia emeritus professor describes the home phone ringing at 2 a.m.
by someone who claimed to be watching his movements, and how this
upset the family. Newkirk declares that animal abuse is &quot;a far greater
crime than any crime that the ALF may commit.&quot; But one can and should
oppose authoritarian treatment by humans against each other and other
animals. And not, as Humane Society CEO Wayne Pacelle states at one
point in the film, because coercion &quot;hands a strategic opportunity to
our opponents.&quot; Yes, activists who resort to coercion and threat can
enable animal users to manage activists -- by portraying activists as
menacing. But we need not call anyone our &quot;opponents&quot; if we're
committed to the ethical evolution of humanity. As a social movement,
animal rights is about cultivating understanding, not finding
opponents.

Newkirk praises the ALF but insists that &quot;PETA has chosen a much
different way to go&quot; -- although if there's any striking revelation in
this film it's how much PETA people are expected to behave like the
modern ALF.11 The interest in scoping out &quot;targets&quot;, in investigating,
infiltrating, and seizing control is evident in nearly every scene.

In a hall-of-mirrors effect, the theme of infiltration is replicated
in this production itself. No one's ever been in Newkirk's flat
before, says Galkin in the film's press notes -- not even other PETA
people.

&amp;#x201CLike any corporation -- and PETA is essentially a corporation
-- it took a while to peel back the layers and finally sit down with
Ingrid herself&quot;, says Galkin. &quot;She agreed in principle but it took
many months of shooting until I felt I was really inside both the
organization and her life.&quot;12 Who's zooming who? PETA's paid staff
tops 300 people, we're told, but those seen on camera are the same
people Newkirk has time and again unleashed on the public. And
although the producers intermittently allow others to critique PETA's
tactics -- for interviewing &quot;people who seem to share the same goals
as Ingrid, but who might be critical of PETA's methods&quot;, Galkin says,
&quot;allows us to get into more subtle arguments about PETA and the animal
rights movement in general&quot;13 -- they never ask anyone to present a
coherent message of animal rights. Had they done so, the film might
have had more than curiosity value.

At the group's 25th anniversary gala, an interviewer asks pop singer
Pink, &quot;Why do you support PETA?&quot; The answer: &quot;'Cause I love animals!&quot;

After watching the premiere, Priscilla Feral said, &quot;I met the film
crew when they'd just returned from Paris with Newkirk. They were
giddy over having access to celebrities. They ended up doing a number
on Newkirk, which Newkirk understands,14 but apparently they don't.&quot;
Indeed, a portrayal of a media-driven individual wanting to brand the
idea of animal rights is disconcerting to activists. For the public in
general, as one writer says, &quot;I Am an Animal deftly highlights why the
movement is so hard to take seriously, exhibiting a kind of messianic
zeal, narrow perspective and shrill moral superiority that borders on
narcissism.&quot;15

&quot;I believe that the horrors in this world could not ever have been
created by a loving god&quot;, says Newkirk, whose opinion of this world is
stark: &quot;Overall it's not a nice place.&quot; And Newkirk resolves to
continue, even in death, to be its perpetual nemesis. The finale is
Newkirk's reading of the last will and testament that directs her skin
to be made into leather products, and her flesh into &quot;Newkirk
Nuggets&quot;, barbequed to demonstrate that all flesh smells the same when
cooked. One eye is to be mounted and sent to the Environmental
Protection Agency (long under PETA's scrutiny for violations of its
animal welfare rules) to keep an eternal watch.

For activists, the clearest message from I Am an Animal is the
importance of accurately describing what groups do, so as not to
mistake demagogy for respect, strategy for moral coherence, regulation
and authority for conscientious commitment. Yes, PETA has accomplished
something: the imposition of tabloid culture onto a serious idea. PETA
gets away with it because, as the nonprofit most admired by people
aged 13 to 24, its pool of supporters is perpetually replenished.16 In
the course of a year PETA's &quot;Youth Division&quot; chatted up more than 2
million young people at music festivals and other events. And the kids
are consumers, persuaded to spend over a million dollars a year on
PETA merchandise.17 Trendy rock musicians, sex(ism) and violence sell
well to people in this emotionally vulnerable time of life. For the
perceptive among them, I Am an Animal will be a wake-up call: They
will know a cultural paradigm shift cannot be brand-named, and it's
precisely that insight that will lead to the most significant steps
for animal rights.

10 Notwithstanding the &quot;total animal liberation&quot; sound bite, PETA
opines:

When there is a respectful, loving bond between horse and human, then
horseback riding is as much an act of companionship and exercise as
walking one's dog. However, just as we oppose the use of &quot;choke&quot;
collars on dogs, we also oppose the use of whips, spurs, and other
devices that cause discomfort and pain to horses. PETA supports
humane, interactive training. Just as a dog can be lovingly or
abusively house-trained, gentle methods can be employed to teach a
horse to allow a rider on his or her back.

PETA Founder&quot; (19 Nov. 2007), Newkirk approves of some aspects of the
film; yet:

'[O]n a personal level, I found the film mortifying,' she says in an
interview with USA Today. 'I'm not a morose person. I'm amazed at what
(Galkin) left out and a bit uncomfortable about what he put in,' she
says. 'I suppose people can make fun of me and deride us for the
things we do. All that matters is we get out the stories of what's
being done to animals.'
