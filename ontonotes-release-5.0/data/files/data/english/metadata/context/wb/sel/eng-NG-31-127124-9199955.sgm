Dear Friends,

I would appreciate your advice in order to avoid having to pack the
monster and send it to LEVT for diagnosis and (hopefully) repair.

Was riding normally at a leisurely pace in turbo mode on a new point
one lipo pack and after about 4 miles the bike just died. No power and
the control lights on the left of the panel just went out.  Attempts
to restart brought no change.  I unplugged the control cable from the
hub battery (as well as unplugging both batteries) and waited a few
minutes, then reconnected the control cable and the A battery and the
behavior was the same.  After a lot of fiddling with different
configurations I brought the bike home without power assist.

I thought maybe the A pack (hub) was depleted and so not providing any
juice to the control circuits so I disconnected everything and
recharged the A battery, then hooked everything in the factory config
and there was still nothing.  The panel shows full SOC on the A
battery but there is no flashing of the three lights on power-up and
no response at all to the throttle (irrespective of whether the A batt
or the Lipo pack is connected)..

I opened the control box and everything looks normal.  All the cables
are plugged in and none looks damaged. (by the way, I have been riding
with no jumper, just reactivitating the A power circuit every 10 min
when it times out.)

I then got brave last night and opened up the front hub to check the
fuse.  It was not burned and there was no evidence of damage in the
hub.  I closed it back up.

I have the following questions:

a) is there any way the lipo pack provided excess voltage and damaged
a control circuit or something else in the motor hub?  Is there a fuse
in the motor hub that might have burned?

b) would connecting the jumper have the potential to bypass a circuit
which is not functioning and provide power to the motor?

c) is it possible that one of the reed switches on the brakes has been
damaged/cracked and that is disabling the whole power system?  Is
there a way to bypass the reed switch protections?

d) do you have any other ideas?

any suggestions would be greatly appreciated in order to keep a
dedicated TF rider on the streets.

thanx in advance,  louis helling

Louis,
This sounds a lot like your power lead to the motor is 1. not
connected, or 2. damaged.
If you do not see a power up (three lights flash on console), that
means the motor does not have power applied, or maybe the com cable is
not communicating to the console.
Battery is a power source and well below the motor max voltage, which
even if you exceeded that, the motor would just fault out as designed.
I would check all wiring connections before doing anything else.

Louis,
Doug's advice is golden.
Are you getting ANY lights on the dash besides the SOC lights?

To answer your questions:
a) There's no fuse in the motor hub.
It's very unlikely that excess voltage came out of your batteries as long as
you didn't accidentally connect your &quot;B&quot; pack in series.

b) &amp; d) no.  see Doug's more likely scenario - no power's getting to the
motor hub if no lights are coming on, OR something seriously wrong with the
console or cable(s).  If the motor hub logic board is dead you should get a
blue light on the dash.  When you roll the bike (spin the rear wheel) with
it on do you get a blue light (spinning provides internal &quot;regen&quot; power)?

c) the brake switch could disable the throttle but you'd still get normal
power on 3 LED sequence light display.  Brake switches can be easily
overridden by disconnecting in the console if they're a problem.

Be very careful when messing with the data cables and inside the console.
You can EASILY DO MORE DAMAGE TO YOUR ELECTRONICS.

I believe LEVT can fix anything, but the more that's broken the more it will
cost.

Good luck and I hope it's just a bad power connection to your motor!
Inspect that rear hub power connection carefully for signs of wear or
melting and replace it if you find anything wrong.

Best,
Joe

A few questions:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;No power and the control lights on the left of the panel just went out.
">

The control lights (regen, cruise, turbo) are on the right; battery
SOC lights are on the left.  Did the control lights or the SOC lights
go out?  That's two different problems.

Also, take a voltmeter and check to make sure the front hub is
actually providing power.  (Check at the B battery hookup location.)

How are you connecting your lipo?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; a) is there any way the lipo pack provided excess voltage and damaged
&gt; a control circuit or something else in the motor hub?
">

Possible but unlikely.  If that happened it would tend to happen on
initial connection.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; c) is it possible that one of the reed switches on the brakes has been
&gt; damaged/cracked and that is disabling the whole power system?  Is
&gt; there a way to bypass the reed switch protections?
">

Unplug them from the dash controller.

Also, a common problem with the Andersons is that they melt
(especially in turbo mode.)  Sometimes they melt just enough to allow
the contact to disengage from its mate; then it cools down and
solidifies.  This has happened to me twice at the junction between the
bike harness and the motor power input.

Using a sharp needle, peirce the sheath behind the motor connector &amp;
in front of the A battery connector and check the ohms on both the + &amp;
- (not at the same time), should be zero. Then check the voltage with
the same method starting at the hub battery.

Report back and we will go from there.

PS if you roll the bike by hand, does the blue regen light come on
with speed?

I'm using 75A Andersons as that's what Dougie provided with my
original Point 1 lipos. They've been flawless, and I've ditched the
Delphis that came with my S as they were getting too sloppy. The big
boy Andersons inspire confidence with their huge contacts and positive
connections.

If that's true (and the battery lights are still on) I would strongly
suspect one of the power connectors.  Inspect carefully for signs of
damage/overheating/corrosion/dirt.

I use 45A  Andersons and so far they are perfect -- But I'll keep an
eye on em, clean em once or twice a year and love their smallness.

Still, if our motors can routinely pull close to 60A in high torque
mode, why would WC spec a 45A connector? Makes no sense. Go offroad up
a steep hill and you'll easily see 55A on a DB; I did it this past
weekend, and we've verified here that this high torque mode appears to
be programmed to kick in once the bike gets below 5 mph on a climb.
And extended offroad climbs will keep the power demands in this range
for far longer than just a momentary peak.

Unc L, no offense but yer connectors are HUGE &amp; HONKIN -- even Delphis
are smaller -- aren't they?

I regularly go up some 17% grades standing up and at full throttle at
8mph. I should check to see if the Andersons are warm -- but they are
fine at 2 years and 1500 miles and every ride has the steepness above
as I live on top of a hill.

greetings far-flung advisors,

have just finished the exam.  data follows:

1) power connections seem intact.  no visually obvious burns, melts or
corrosion on any connectors.  i used the multimeter from connector to
connector among all 3: input to motor hub, output from A battery hub,
and output from B battery (under the seat) .  there is continuity
between all pairs. also i get the same voltage (~40V) on motor and
front connectors when the LiPo is hooked to the B connector.  i could
not manage to penetrate insulation to measure either continuity or
voltage in the cables behind the connectors.

2) the blue light in lower right on the panel DOES come on when the
key is in the off position and the bike is moved manually.

3) still no flashing of the three lights on power up. SOC still shows
full charge in key on position.  still no reaction at all to the
throttle when the key is on.

HERE IS THE ANOMALOUS THING:

4) there no voltage measurement across the output connector of the A
battery (unlike the B connector which comes from the LiPo which does
show voltage).  this seems at odds with the SOC showing 5 bars when
the control cable is connected to the front hub even when both power
cables (A &amp; B) are disconnected.

so there seems to be a contradiction between the SOC and the lack of
voltage on the A battery cable.

SO...

a) any theories?  in spite of the fact that the A hub fuse was sound,
is the hub battery somehow burned?

b) any more tests i might try to clarify the situation?

c) can i install the jumper in the dashbox and remove the A hub
entirely and just run off the LiPo via the B connection?  should i try
this?

once again, thanx in advance to all for your insight and assistance.

- louis

I'm almost afraid to reply as I don't want to tell you something that may
wind up causing you to make things worse.  I say this from experience as my
bike is dead as a result of my killing it from attempting to install the
&quot;non-WC jumper&quot; into the controller.
Warning out of the way, I'll go on...

The controller only shows the 5 LED SOCs from the front A hub which is
totally independent of what is coming out of the power leads from the A
hub.  the LED display comes from the data connection directly out of the A
hub.  When all is well these LEDs tick down as current flows from the A hub
so they usually correspond to how much is left in the battery.

Getting down to your specific problem.  It's a little hard to follow your
description of the problem.  DOES YOUR BLUE LIGHT COME ON WHEN YOU ROLL THE
BIKE WITH THE BIKE TURNED ON?  You said it comes on when it's OFF.  What
about ON?
Also, are you leaving the Lipo pack connected all the time, bike on/ bike
off, every test?  That confuses the diagnosis too.

It seems your problem may be with the A hub.  You should definately be
seeing power coming out of it, but only when it's turned on.  IE when the
&quot;bike&quot; is switched off, you will not see any power coming out of the A hub.
The power &quot;switches&quot; are inside the A hub.
Chew on these tidbits and tell us some more.

Best,
Joe

&gt; greetings far-flung advisors,

&gt; have just finished the exam.  data follows:

&gt; 1) power connections seem intact.  no visually obvious burns, melts or
&gt; corrosion on any connectors.  i used the multimeter from connector to
&gt; connector among all 3: input to motor hub, output from A battery hub,
&gt; and output from B battery (under the seat) .  there is continuity
&gt; between all pairs. also i get the same voltage (~40V) on motor and
&gt; front connectors when the LiPo is hooked to the B connector.  i could
&gt; not manage to penetrate insulation to measure either continuity or
&gt; voltage in the cables behind the connectors.

&gt; 2) the blue light in lower right on the panel DOES come on when the
&gt; key is in the off position and the bike is moved manually.

&gt; 3) still no flashing of the three lights on power up. SOC still shows
&gt; full charge in key on position.  still no reaction at all to the
&gt; throttle when the key is on.

&gt; HERE IS THE ANOMALOUS THING:

&gt; 4) there no voltage measurement across the output connector of the A
&gt; battery (unlike the B connector which comes from the LiPo which does
&gt; show voltage).  this seems at odds with the SOC showing 5 bars when
&gt; the control cable is connected to the front hub even when both power
&gt; cables (A &amp; B) are disconnected.

&gt; so there seems to be a contradiction between the SOC and the lack of
&gt; voltage on the A battery cable.

&gt; SO...

&gt; a) any theories?  in spite of the fact that the A hub fuse was sound,
&gt; is the hub battery somehow burned?

&gt; b) any more tests i might try to clarify the situation?

&gt; c) can i install the jumper in the dashbox and remove the A hub
&gt; entirely and just run off the LiPo via the B connection?  should i try
&gt; this?

&gt; once again, thanx in advance to all for your insight and assistance.

&gt; - louis

Do this:

Keep your Aux LIPO disconnected.
Turn on the bike and tell us if the 3 colored lights blink on in sequence
when you first turn on the bike.

Try clamping a sewing needle using Vise-Grip pliers.

BE CAREFUL NOT TO SHORT ANYTHING (ie DONT TOUCH THE 2 VISE GRIPS TOGETHER.

Joe,  here are the answers to your questions:

1) the 3 lights DO NOT come on at all when the key is turned on and
the A battery is connected.

2) the blue light DOES come on when the key is turned on and the bike
is moved manually.  this is true both with the A pack connected (SOC
full) and without the A pack.

3) you were right about the A battery being disconnected from the
cable when the key is turned off.  i forgot the A hub is smart, not
dumb like the LiPo.  the A cable shows ~40V across the connectors when
the key is turned on.

4)  at no time have the A hub and the B LiPo been connected at the
same time. i have been very careful about this, both in prior use and
during this testing.

does this help clarify things?

i will have to get organized to follow cliff's method for in-cable
testing...

gratefully,  louis

do cliff's method to check that you are getting power to the rear hub.
Keep the lipo out of these tests, it just muddies the results.
If you watch carefully while pushing the bike or spinning the rear wheel with the bike on does only the blue light come on or do you see the other lights come on?
So far i'm thinking either your motor is not getting any power or if it is (ruled out via &quot;cliff&quot; pin test) there's a problem with a data connection, probably at a connecter but could be a cut wire.  Carefully inspect the pins in the data connecters and then in the console to make sure none are bent or lose.
Best,
Joe (mobile)
