We just took our Odessa-doll to get ehr teeth cleaned this morning, and
Mama's frantic; I worry myself sick over the babies when they have to go. She
does have some nasty gingivitis, which Louie and I have been trying to treat
with the Rinse of Evil and brushing. Of course, catching The Doll is like
trying to catch a ball of grease with legs.
She is the most slippery cat I've ever known: fast and sleeck with very
smooth fur, she can slip out of grasp easily. But we got her in, under her
loud protests.

Please spare a few for our little dolly to co0me through okay?

Blessed be,
Baha

Tigger is at the vet getting her teeth cleaned too.  I know how you feel.
Purrs for Odessa to come through just fine.  Tigger had just been to the vet
Saturday for her regular checkup and had not had a chance to forget what the
cat carrier was for.  It's amazing how much strength she has in her front
legs :-)

Thanks all...

Just got word from the vet, Odessa's fine but she had some nasty extractions.
Apparently there were root-tips from busted teeth that had been there awhile,
and our Doll, the little soldier, never gave indication of trouble.

Our vet is looking for a suit of armor for when we have to do her cleanings
now...

Blessed be,
Baha

Why a suit of armour? If I remember rightly from Odessa's last visit to the
vet a gasmask is a much better idea

Oh, PHEW!!!!! :-P

The gas mask is for the vet. The armor's for Mama, the chief administrator of
drugs. Odessa was sent home with two liquid pain medicines and pill
antibiotics, and catching and dosing her has already been an adventure. For a
dainty Lady, she's pretty foul-mouthed (not to mention what comes out of the
other end!) and she is very hard to hold on to. But she's douing well.
Apparently a long time ago she'd lost some teeth, but left some root-tips
behind, and the gums grew over them, like an ear pierce closing. Then they
got inflamed, and nastily. Our poor Dolly had to have some unexpected
emergency work done. I am indebted to the Georgetowne Animal Clinic and Dr.
Newman. We were expecting a routine cleaning, not emergency surgery, and the
doctor and office contributed from the Emergency Pet Fund to cover some of
the cost. (Of course i feel guilty now, hoping I didn't end up taking from
some poor soul who really needs it. That little donation box is going to get
quite a few little fillers over the next several pay periods.)

On a side note, I understand that the other cats weren't happy that we had to
sequester Odessa in the bedroom the night before we took her in. The Juvies
in particular like to come and sleep with us, and Roxie likes to come in
early for her Daddy time. I truly believe a cat can fart at will, and I
believe that Louie got the brunt of it. he went back into the house for his
work badge after getting me and the Doll into the car, and there were three
cats in the kitchen, giving him filthy looks, and a filthier smell. There was
no evidence of litter usage, the boxes being in the bedroom and basement, and
methane has its own, um, special quality. Louie came out running with one of
my little fans, waving it desperately in front of his poor abused nose.

Blessed be,
Baha
