I currently have a 99 2.8 A6 with 106k and am thinking about moving to a
2001/2002 4.2 A6.  Anyone have any opinions on the 4.2 version?

What kind of gas mileage can I expect?  I currently get about 21 mpg with
the 2.8 A6.

Thanks!
John

I had a 2000 A6 4.2 and loved it.  One of the best cars I've ever
owned.  I got about 23 mph on a trip, and about 18 driving around
town.  The only problem in three+ years was a leaky xmsn seal, fixed
under warranty.

When I bought my RS6, I sold the A6 to my son-in-law.  He has driven
it for two years with no problems.

A friend of mine just got a 2000 4.2 and loves everything about
it.....except the gas mileage. According to him, practicing anything other
the most conservative style of driving leads to "city" mileage in the low to
mid teens and "highway" mileage in the upper teens.
