(Free Market News) U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services and four-term governor of Wisconsin Tommy Thompson said a few months ago that he would be "chipped." But now he says he has no time.

In July, during a CNBC interview, he declared that he would allow the VeriChip Corporation, of which he is a board-member, to implant him with one of the RFID devices they manufacture. However, according to an article on SpyChips.com, Thompson has not done so as yet, and has no plans to undergo the procedure in the near future.
It is ironic that for a man who  advocated the use of verichip  by all Americans now seems too busy to implant himself with the device. If the Verichip was as beneficial as Mr. Thompson claims, one would expect that he of all people would lead the way by personally having the chip inserted in his body.

Apparently Mr. Thompson is having some second thoughts about the new technology (within people that is). After all, if it is  efficient for US passports , wouldn't it be efficient for human bodies as well?

(Free Market News) [Thompson] reportedly told CBS MarketWatch in July, and when a CNBC correspondent in another July interview asked if he would take a chip himself, Thompson allegedly replied, "Absolutely, without a doubt." However, further follow-up has revealed that such chipping has never taken place. VeriChip spokesman John Procter is quoted as saying Thompson has been "too busy" to undergo the chipping procedure, and that "I wouldn't put any type of time line on it."
Although the Verichip has proven its usefulness in  hospitals , bars and even  children's pajamas , Thompson's reluctance may reflect an American fear of being tagged by "Uncle Sam." Although some may view this technology as "the mark of the beast," citizens of faith generally have nothing to fear as Thompson's dream of every American being implanted with this device probably will not come to pass in this life time--at least not without a fight.
