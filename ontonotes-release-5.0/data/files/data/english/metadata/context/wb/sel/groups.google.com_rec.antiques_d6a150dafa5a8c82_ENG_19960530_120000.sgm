REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION (RFD)
unmoderated group soc.history.property

Summary: Discussions related to restoration &amp; preservation of
historic properties
Proposed by: LeAnne Davis &lt;n ... @msg.ti.com&gt;

This is a formal Request for Discussion (RFD) on the subject of
creating an unmoderated Usenet newsgroup, soc.history.property.

This message inititates a discussion period to consider the creation
of soc.history.property newsgroup. This is not a Call For Votes (CFV);
you cannot vote at this time. Procedural details are below.

RATIONALE: soc.history.property

Current discussions on issues related to an interest in &quot;antique&quot;
houses, take place on rec.antiques, misc.consumers.house, and
alt.home.repair. Currently, there is no Usenet group where these
discussions *really* fit so most discussions take place informally via
e-mail.

CHARTER: soc.history.property

The newsgroup discussions will not be limited to discussions about
houses, but will also include other structures that are sometimes used
as homes and are often used as businesses (such as warehouses, barns,
town square storefronts,...) The property being discussed should be in
excess of 50 years in age. This cutoff is in accordance with the
rec.antiques guidelines for &quot;antiques&quot;. Granted, a 50 year old
building is considered in new many locales, however, there are several
styles falling into this period of 50-100 years in age which should
not be omitted (for example, some of the homes designed by Frank
L. Wright.)

Occasional ads will be acceptable in response to requests for
information or service pointers, but the preferred method is for
respondents to contact the person requesting information directly via
e-mail. While you are likely quite proud of your home &amp; its
restoration, because of newsreader limitations, this newsgroup will
not be an appropriate place to posts files with graphics, however, by
all means offer to send via e-mail or scan into your web pages then
tell us the URL.

Issues which may be discussed:

registering historic properties at state &amp; national levels
preservation restrictions (OK, my house has a marker now, what
if I want to.....?)
redevelopment for public access
demolition delay
historic interpretation
archaeological surveys (I found this fossil in my back yard....)
restoration tips &amp; techniques - (been there, done that!)
restoration suppliers - &quot;who has this?&quot; types of questions
historic gardens &amp; landscaping
data sheets for restoration/preservation materials &amp; services
my home is on tour this Christmas, where can I get a period outfit?
anecdotes from restoration/preservation experiences
ads for historic properties on the market (owner posted - no brokers)
web-sites for preservation/restoration issues
historical vacation sites for the preservationist
conferences, shows, upcoming events related to preservation/restoration
reviews of magazines, books, etc related to preservation
decorating interiors - repro or period?
color schemes for &quot;painted ladies&quot;&amp; other old buildings
tax issues (like increasing tax credits for restoration/preservation)
&amp; so on (I've probably left out a lot)

In general, if a property is eligible for discussion in &quot;Old House
Journal&quot;, &quot;This Old House&quot;, or &quot;Historic Preservation&quot;, we'll probably
be talking about it.

END CHARTER.

PROCEDURE:

This is a request for discussion, not a call for votes. In this phase
of the process, any potential problems with the proposed newsgroups
should be raised and resolved. The discussion period will continue
for a minimum of 21 days (starting from when the first RFD for this
proposal is posted to news.announce.newgroups), after which a Call For
Votes (CFV) may be posted by a neutral vote taker if the discussion
warrants it. Please do not attempt to vote until this happens.

All discussion of this proposal should be posted to news.groups.

This RFD attempts to comply fully with the Usenet newsgroup creation
guidelines outlined in &quot;How to Create a New Usenet Newsgroup&quot; and &quot;How
to Format and Submit a New Group Proposal&quot;. Please refer to these
documents (available in news.announce.newgroups) if you have any
questions about the process.
