The protest against pope in London. Fundamentalists Muslims chanting:
"Democracy is hypocrisy".

I remember that on the usenet I already saw another group of people that
believe exactly the same thing. They call themselves libertarians.

An ancient provers said that "those who are the same eventually gather
together".  Libertarians are well known to promote "economic efficiency"
and not opposing any merger betwen corporations. Maybe they take a clue
from their own ideology and for a better efficiency in fighting against the
(evil of) democracy, they can merge with the "London group" to form the
new, more efficient: Talibano-Libertarian Party.

Just a thought :-)

The basic premis of the libertarian philosophy is the non-initiation of

Why are you railing against "tooneys" (whoever that is) when the
discussion is libertarianism philosophy?  Please do try to stay awake.

Or are you attempting to denigrate an entire class of good folk with what
you believe to be a cute derogative?  If so what is your position on
niggers, kikes and hook-noses?

No you don't because you're incapable of understanding the offence

Had you stopped to consider the ramifications of the non-initiation of

engage in self defense.

Everybody it is a libertarian by the age of 3 till before puberty. Then, the

How do you imagine that you get from the "non-initiation of force" to
an absolute right to private property?  Answer: you don't.  Almost no
libertarian policy conclusions regarding property follow logically from
the "non-initiation of force".

Wrong.  It is impossible to mix labor with natural resources.  That is
merely an uninformative metaphor.  You might as well talk of mixing
England with origami.  By _applying_ labor to natural resources, you
make create something that did not exist before.  _That_ is your
stuff.  Not the resources that are still there in nature just as they
were before you were born.

The fact of which you are trying to keep yourself ignorant is that
labor earns its product.  No more, no less.  It does not earn the land
under the laborer, nor does it earn any part of nature but the part
that is extracted and removed from nature, and transformed by labor
into a product that is no longer a natural resource.

Nope.  The fact is, products of labor are _separate_ from the
resources nature provided.  The process of production is thus not a
process of mixing labor with resources but of separating products from
resources.  Labor cannot be "mixed with" resources because once
expended, the labor no longer exists.  Only the product remains, which
is rightly owned, and the remaining unaltered natural resources, which
as they are not products of labor cannot rightly be owned.

I do not contend that. But it is not a problem to claim that the product
became seperate from the land when the latter was mixed with the labor.

And of course "mixing labor with land" is a metaphor. Labor, as far as I
know, do not change the atomic composition of the resourcers that have
been extracted and turned into a product.

As you said, and as I contend, it is a metaphor.

You are probably right that your wording - "applying labor to land" - is
more correct than "mixing labor with land", but I maintain that the two
concepts cover the same process and yield the same result - namely a
product that is seperate from the nature-given resources.

Yes, it means someone is trying to rationalize the unjust privilege of

ownership inherently violates the equal rights of all to use them.

nature.

A farm consists of both improvements and natural resources (see above
for an explanation of which is which).  Only the former are rightly
private property.  The farm cannot exist without the space that sun
and rain will fall on.  Yet that space was there before any human
being existed, and any person who deprives others of its use without
just compensation is robbing them of the exercise of their rights.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Wrong.  It is impossible to mix labor with natural resources.

&gt; Irrigation is moving water to grow crops.  Any labor expended to do so

&gt; Yes, it means someone is trying to rationalize the unjust privilege of

&gt; If products are merely a mixture of labor and natural resources,

But anyone who insists on veto power over the use of the improvements

I got so tired of demolishing this nonsensical and illogical but
oft-repeated falsehood, that I took the time to create a blog entry on
it.

http://www.disequilibria.com/blog/?p=7

-------------------------------------------------
The labor-mixing argument was likely first proposed by John Locke in
his Second Treatise On Government (1690).  The argument is relatively
straightforward - a man owns himself therefore he owns his labor
therefore he owns the fruits of his labor; by mixing his labor with the
land, he removes the land from the commons, transforms the land and
comes to own the land as well as its product.  From there, any sort of
inheritance, trade, or other voluntary act of transfer preserves the
right on the part of the new proprietor.

There are a number of logical problems with this exposition.  Locke
himself recognized the most glaring one, and made it explicit through
what's known as the Lockean Proviso - that the appropriation of land
from the commons is only just to the extent that "there is enough,
and as good, left in common for others".  In other words, the Lockean
justification only holds for as long as there is sufficient good land
that's freely available for the taking. Since that is not the case in
our world, the Lockean justification fails immediately on its own
accord.  Of course, even if that were not the case, there are other
serious problems with Locke's analysis.  What does it mean to
"mix" labor with land?  Is such a concept coherent?  How much labor
must one mix?  Even if it the concept were coherent and quantifiable,
how does mixing something you rightfully own (your labor in this case)
with something you do not own confer ownership of the whole thing?
It's just as logical to conclude that you either cede ownership of
what you previously owned or that you only own the increment you
provided. As Robert Nozick pondered in Anarchy, State, and Utopia
(1974) - "...why isn't mixing what I own with what I don't own a
way of losing what I own rather than a way of gaining what I don't?
If I own a can of tomato juice and spill it in the sea so its molecules
mingle evenly throughout the sea, do I thereby come to own the sea, or
have I foolishly dissipated my tomato juice?"

Libertarians claim that all of their beliefs can be logically deduced
from the "non-initiation of force" (sometimes known as the
"non-aggression axiom").  I have demonstrated that this is false.

Libertarians claim to be the party of principles, but apparently they
can't even define their own principles in a coherent manner.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Wrong.  It is impossible to mix labor with natural resources.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  Then what is irrigation?

&gt;&gt; Irrigation is moving water to grow crops.  Any labor expended to do so

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Nope.  The fact is, products of labor are _separate_ from the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; resources nature provided.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  So a steel knife is seperate from the atoms of carbon and iron that
&gt;&gt; &gt;it's made up of?

&gt;&gt; It is separate from the ore from which its raw materials were

&gt;  It's not seperate from all of what made up the ore though is it?

Right.  The part that is now in the knife, but formerly was part of
the ore, is now a product and no longer a natural resource.  The part
of what was once all ore that is no longer ore is no longer ore but a
product of labor.

No matter how determined you are not to know it.

The iron atoms that we used to regard as a natural resource but are

It is entirely separate from the iron that is still natural.  The iron
that occurred naturally is now in two parts: the part that is still
natural, and the separate part that is no longer natural but has been

No, of course not.  Your right to use the irrigation system is
contingent on not thereby violating anyone else's rights.  And if you

&lt;yawn&gt;  No, stupid liar.  By that "logic," you could acquire ownership

Stupid, lying filth.

No.  You have not removed it from nature, but only added improvements

Why do you insist it is rightful for you to grab ownership of natural

&gt; The iron atoms that we used to regard as a natural resource but are

No they are not because they still are a natural resource.  Are they
an artifical resource?  Did they somehow jump into an alternate

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Their situation is.

But not the atoms themselves, which is what you tried to claim.

No liar I'm not being equivocal at all.  The iron atoms are a natural
resource.
They continue to be one because they can't be anything else.  The fact
that they are _part_ of an artificial resource (e.g. a pure iron ingot)
doesn't
change the fact that they themselves were not created by man.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The basic premis of the libertarian philosophy is the non-initiation of

&gt; &gt;   Sure there is, taking your stuff is force, and it's your stuff if you
&gt; &gt; mixed labour
&gt; &gt; with natural resources.

&gt; I got so tired of demolishing this nonsensical and illogical but
&gt; oft-repeated falsehood, that I took the time to create a blog entry on
&gt; it.

&gt; http://www.disequilibria.com/blog/?p=7

&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; The labor-mixing argument was likely first proposed by John Locke in
&gt; his Second Treatise On Government (1690).  The argument is relatively
&gt; straightforward - a man owns himself therefore he owns his labor
&gt; therefore he owns the fruits of his labor; by mixing his labor with the
&gt; land, he removes the land from the commons, transforms the land and
&gt; comes to own the land as well as its product.  From there, any sort of
&gt; inheritance, trade, or other voluntary act of transfer preserves the
&gt; right on the part of the new proprietor.

&gt; There are a number of logical problems with this exposition.  Locke
&gt; himself recognized the most glaring one, and made it explicit through
&gt; what's known as the Lockean Proviso - that the appropriation of land
&gt; from the commons is only just to the extent that &quot;there is enough,
&gt; and as good, left in common for others&quot;.  In other words, the Lockean
&gt; justification only holds for as long as there is sufficient good land
&gt; that's freely available for the taking.
">

But there is never "enough and as good" because the best land is
logically taken first.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Since that is not the case in
&gt; our world, the Lockean justification fails immediately on its own
&gt; accord.  Of course, even if that were not the case, there are other
&gt; serious problems with Locke's analysis.  What does it mean to
&gt; &quot;mix&quot; labor with land?  Is such a concept coherent?
">

If you make something out of X amount of land and Y of your
labour is the product not a mixture of both?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  How much labor must one mix?
">

Well I'd say you have to create as much value for other people in the
mixing (by increasing your own productivity and thus allowing cheaper
exchange for others) as the land is worth unimproved.  I know that's
vague but it's a big question.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Even if it the concept were coherent and quantifiable,
&gt; how does mixing something you rightfully own (your labor in this case)
&gt; with something you do not own confer ownership of the whole thing?
">

Certainly not if someone else owns it.  If nobody does then yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's just as logical to conclude that you either cede ownership of
&gt; what you previously owned or that you only own the increment you
&gt; provided.
">

The later would make sense if they were seperable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As Robert Nozick pondered in Anarchy, State, and Utopia
&gt; (1974) - &quot;...why isn't mixing what I own with what I don't own a
&gt; way of losing what I own rather than a way of gaining what I don't?
&gt; If I own a can of tomato juice and spill it in the sea so its molecules
&gt; mingle evenly throughout the sea, do I thereby come to own the sea, or
&gt; have I foolishly dissipated my tomato juice?&quot;
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
">

But if mixing your labour with natural resources did not create a
right
to the product nobody could own anything created with their own labour.
Which means that the right to own the product of your own labour is
someone theorectical and useless.  It must be possible to own
something.

Your blog entry mentions homesteading as though people could simply
state a claim to natural resources.  My understand is that you must
claim, use and occupy the resources for a set period of time (e.g. you
must keep a fire going in a house on the land for a year).  Thus the
idea
that you could beat the other two guys to the oasis and claim it all
fails because one man can't use the whole oasis.

It is hard to figure out which one of the 4 groups above are actually more

simultaneously :-)

The question to ask them is however, how can they prove (with logic and not
senseless PR) THAT THEIR ALTERNATIVE IS BETTER.
