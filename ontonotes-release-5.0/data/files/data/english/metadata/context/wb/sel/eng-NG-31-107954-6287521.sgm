Nexus 7 - freezing

I've got a so-called commuter bike (Giant Cypress, won through the
Biketown promotion last summer) that has a Nexus 7 hub.  A few weeks
ago I rode it in the rain.  Ever since then whenever the temperature
is below 32 something freezes, and I can with difficulty shift up
(higher cable tension) but not down.  The cable is continuous from the
grip shifter through the ferrule just before it attaches to the hub.
I have not yet disassembled the cable to clean/dry/lube the cable and
housing (take it off the hub, unscrew the doo-dad that the is attached
to the cable, pull off all the housing, clean and lube and hope I
reinstall correctly, etc.)

Anyone had this problem - it it common with this hub?  Am I right that
it's likely the cable, or is there something about the hub that would
cause this?  For years I had a Sachs Super 7 on a Broadway Bike and
though it froze like this once or twice, it cleared itself up within a
day or so.

I told my wife I was posting to this group to ask why the bike was
freezing.  She says that "it's darn cold".

It's the cable. The labyrinth seals on the hub itself thumb their nose
at cold and wet. I've had the same thing happen with brake cables.
Displace the moisture with your choice of appropriate lube. It's a
great hub, you'll get years of enjoyment out of it, I'm sure.

Good advice.  I've been using a Nexus 7 for two winters now, and I've
never had a shifting issue even down to -25C.  Also, in order to
reduce chances of the cable getting frozen or gummed up I use as
little housing as I can get away with.  The hub came to me secondhand
without any fittings (save for the hub's own housing stop), so I used
some old Sturmey Archer frame fittings to run the cable.

Ha, that's a bruiser of a winter bike. Good stuff!

I did see that ya made a note about cleaning that shocking chain, but
might I recommend a KMC heavy duty one. They're nickel plate, and the
side plates and pins are fatter than usual. $10, and require little
love. I ran one on my Nexus 7 during the winter and it  was one less
thing to worry about.

I have the same problem on my shopping/railway station bike, which has
the same hub.  Whenever the temperature drops below freezing, it won't
shift down below third.  Four to seven work fine in both directions.

Check the adjustment of the cable and lube. I've ridden a Nexus- 7
down to around 10F and it shifted just fine, but dang was I cold. :-P

Yeah, I could do that, but since I volunteer at a bike recycling co-op
we have lots of old but still useable chains.  I toss one on and ride
it (and clean and lube it) until it starts getting too creaky. Then it
goes into our metal recycling bin and I put another old one on.  I
don't care how the chain looks as long as it still flexes freely and
does what it should do.

One thing I have been trying out recently is one of those extra-thick
innertubes on the rear tire to minimize flat potential.  But it adds a
bit too much rolling mass to the bike (the old adage is 1 lb. on the
wheel is like 4 on the frame), so it's coming off.

Also, I have removed the roller brake and installed cantis, because I
was getting a bit paranoid about getting a flat back there and having
to undo not only the wheel nuts and shifter cable, but also the brake
arm and brake cable.  Sure, the cables have QRs, but the arm doesn't,
and none of it would be fun to wrestle with covered in grunge at
-20C.  And yes, one can patch a flat with the wheel still on the bike,
but patches don't always stick in cold weather, and things like broken
valves still mean changing the tube (for which I always keep a spare
on hand).

Mostly there with ya, but I still like shiny chains. :-P Too much of a
PITA to try to deal with old ones. Exception being the lovely original
chain on my '76 Raleigh Woman's Sports.

Those are awful. Tried them.Hated them. I've been quite impressed with
the IRC Tandem tires on my day to day ride--I ride it over anything,
like the crow flies, and zero flats in a thousand miles , but they're
unfortunately expensive in the context of a bike recycling thing.

I never, in the 30K that my Nexi bike did, had a flat that needed a
wheel removal. Two flats. Patches. Tough tires. Even so, I never found
a wheel removal to be that traumatic. Disengaging the shifter cable is
far more traumatic than the brake cable. Cantis are gonna be better
than the roller brake, but you give up that Toyota reliability on the
back end.

Sometimes new stuff is indeed worth it.  On my cargo trike I'm running
Schwalbe Big Apples (406 size), and they are the perfect tire for that
application, since they can be run at low psi for shock absorption
without the sidewall deforming.

Hmm, I could look into the Schwalbe Marathon with its fat kevlar
strip, but for winter riding I want a tire a more agressive tread.

Is this in winter riding? I 've had patches not hold when put on in
below-freezing weather.

Yes, the shift cable is a pain. I understand Shimano's concept of
making the mech. inboard of the frame to protect it, and in warmer
weather it's not a big deal to fuss with.  But on a dark, cold
winter's night I don't like the idea of trying to get that all hooked
back together.  I use this hub because it came to me really cheap, as
the left bearings were shot and had to be replaced, and I also had the
hub's innards inspected and re-lubed by my old bike shop boss (who has
taken lots of these apart). If I was buying new I'd spend the extra
bucks and get the Sachs hub, as the clickbox concept works just fine
and makes wheel removal a snap (as long as it doesn't have the coaster
brake!).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Quite true.  The roller brake is prefectly consistent no matter what
kind of slushy grunge is buiding up on the wheel, but it's also
consistently not very strong.  And I use the rear brake far more in
winter than in summer to keep control of the front end in slippery
conditions, and now that I have the cantis back on it feels much
better (as does removing that 2 lb. brake!).
