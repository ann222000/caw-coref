A First shot of the Bird at Okhla Bird Park.  These are always way away for even the bazooka to be effective.  This morning, not only the guy was lording over the kins of same variety, there were lots of birds around in the background.

The Forest guys were removing some hyacinth and had a boat handy.  Just hijacked the boat and punted into the water at the islands of hyacinth.  Reached near enough to get some details before the guy decided to take off and settle much farther.

Cheers.
