When you said they have a WEREO here, I thought you meant they have some
sort of Wereo RECORDING of their own.

I quickly ascertain they don't. This LIBERATOR guy will soon fall to the
True Beliefs just like everyone else falls.

I am the only one who matters on the newsgroups. I don't like the &quot;Hitler&quot;
talk either. That ain't something to joke about. I suppose the guy's
entitled to his &quot;opinion&quot; like everyone else but so am I.

I am the only one who matters in Music, Art, and Film. if you see so.

I believe Wereo in the sense of unique and compelling personality was
intended and not in the sense of any recording.

Actually it's 1's and 0's.  Did you get tired of the child molestation
evidence that has been posted about you in every single music group in
Usenet and decide to wander over here?
