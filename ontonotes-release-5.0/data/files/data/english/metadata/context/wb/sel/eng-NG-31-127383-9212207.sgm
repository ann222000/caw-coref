Considerable.  A scanner that is linked to an OCR (Optical Character
Recognition) program scans text and converts it to an editable format
of text.  The editing can include changing the font, font size, and
the wording.  The result is a document in a word processing format.

Simple scanning results in an image of the page; similar to
photographing the page.  The text on the page cannot be edited.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Are the terms used interchangeably by some?

Scanning the text into the OCR program is the first step, so the
document *is* scanned.  It's what happens next that is the difference.
A person could say &quot;I scanned the page and then edited it&quot; if he was
discussing the process with someone who was aware that the page was
being processed by an OCR program, but the statement would mislead
anyone not familiar with what the original person was doing.

Optical Character Recognition is a process done to a printed (or

their scanner for much more than feeding their OCR program, so by

I'd be surprised.  I'm the treasurer and webmaster for my block's
homeowners' association, and I scan in important documents (e.g.,
insurance policies, by-laws) and save them as images.  The important
use is to have the image that somebody can print out later and be
assured that what they're able to look at is the same as the
original.  No, they're not searchable, but that's less important than
that they be right.

For personal documents, I don't bother OCRing things like birth
certificates or the like, and when my grandfather died, I scanned in a
number of his personal documents, again keeping them as images.

You can always run the OCR later on to go from image to (imperfect)
text, but if you throw away the image, you can't go backward.

This is ignoring all of the scans that are made but never stored
because people think of what they're doing as &quot;copying&quot; or &quot;faxing&quot;
rather than &quot;scanning&quot;.

Anyone who needs a death certificate has to present an original,
sealed copy. (They might make a photocopy of it, but they need to see
both the forgery-proofing and the embossed seal of the issuing

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That Mr. Heinlein, like many authors, used a familiar phrase as the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; title of his novel?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Also that more book were published in the 20th century than in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 19th, and more in the 19th than in the 18th and preceding centuries.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;And that typographic conventions that lead to OCR errors were more
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;common then.  I see 15 eighteenth-century hits (and another nine from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;the nineteenth century) for &quot;ftranger in a ftrange land&quot;.  And two
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;eighteenth-century hits for &quot;STRANGER in a ftrange land&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Ah.  I wasn't sure if anyone was actually going to think of this idea,
&gt;&gt; &gt;though Richard M. hinted at it in his message.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, Google Books gives me only one hit for &quot;Mufhtari&quot; and,
&gt;&gt; &gt;not surprisingly, nothing at all for &quot;Mufhtara&quot;.  You may want to take
&gt;&gt; &gt;a look at the &quot;Mufhtari&quot; page yourself; you may be surprised at what
&gt;&gt; &gt;shows up in the actual text of the book.  (It's dated 1989, so don't
&gt;&gt; &gt;expect a &quot;Mushtari&quot; that was written using a long &quot;s&quot;!)

&gt;&gt; Incidentally, is there any particular difference between &quot;OCR&quot; and
&gt;&gt; &quot;scanning&quot;?  Are the terms used interchangeably by some?  I've been
&gt;&gt; increasingly wondering about this.

&gt;Optical Character Recognition is a process done to a printed (or
&gt;typewritten) page that has been scanned in. People probably don't use
&gt;their scanner for much more than feeding their OCR program, so by
&gt;metonymy it comes to be used for the whole process (whn the context
&gt;makes it clear).

I haven't run anything through an OCR program for at least a decade. I
use my scanner for making digital copies of legal documents, pictures,
slides, and for faxing.

the Bronx County Surrogate's Court. I believe insurance companies also

As usual, you duck the point that you used a contradiction in terms.
With the possible exception of some of the Mainland China posters who
appear in aue to ask a question about English usage, your posts
contain more errors in word usage than any of the other posters.

Your comments are also factually incorrect.  I dealt with this issue
after my father's death and my mother's death.  I obtained several
certified copies of their death certificates.  Each was a copy, but
certified as an authentic copy of the original.  The original was
filed with the state.

The certification, accomplished by the embossed seal impression and
initialing by the clerk, makes the *copy* valid as an authentic
representation of the original.

When dealing with the various situations that arise after a death, a
certified copy of the death certificate is necessary in some cases but
not in all cases.  In the case of canceling an automatic renewal of
some agreement, for example, a simple copy will suffice.

The US Treasury Department attempts to make our currency
forgery-proof, but a death certificate doesn't have &quot;forgery-proofing&quot;
attributes.  The embossed seal authenticates that the copy is a
verified copy of the original but it does not forgery-proof the copy.
The copy could easily be altered after it is received.

Yup.  When I'm doing genealogical research, I always insist on a
certified copy of death certificates.

Not all other uses need to be certified copies, either.  I'm pretty
sure that you don't need a certified copy to reply to a jury duty
notice, for example.  And Googling, I see things like

Within 90 days of the date of death of an individual who received
or may have received Medi-Cal benefits, or was the surviving
spouse of a person who received health care Medi-Cal benefits, the
attorney for the estate, or if there is no attorney, the
beneficiary, the personal representative, or the person in
possession of property of the decedent, must give written notice
by mail of the decedent's death to the Director of the Department
of Health Services (DHS) at his or her Sacramento office, or,
Estate Recovery Unit, Mail Stop 4720, P.O. Box 997425, Sacramento,
CA 95899-7425 of the decedent's death. The notice must include a
copy of the decedent's death certificate (which does not need to
be a certified copy).

In &quot;official documents&quot; terminology there can be multiple originals.
A letter of credit might require the supplier to provide (for example)
the commercial invoice in three originals and four copies, the bill of

The shipping people I used to work with carried that out in practice
by laser-printing the invoice seven times and rubber-stamping
&quot;ORIGINAL&quot; on three copies and signing them, then stamping &quot;COPY&quot; on
the other four.

As far as &quot;original copy&quot; is concerned, &quot;copy&quot; is ambiguous in
English:

1. (French &quot;copie&quot;) I hand you a piece of paper and say, &quot;Please make
five copies [or duplicates] of this.&quot;

other non-genealogical uses of a death certificate elsewhere that
don't require certified copies.  For example, Nebraska:

Change the titles and registration of your vehicles. This is done
at the Division of Motor Vehicles. This includes cars, trucks,
trailers, motor homes mobile homes, homes, etc. You may use a
photocopy of the Death Certificate for this.

Change over all bank accounts and remove the deceased's name from
those accounts. You may need a photocopy of the Death Certificate
for this.

http://www.klsfuneralhome.com/resource/checklist.asp

Georgia:

Photocopy of your marriage certificate; if either spouse was
previously married, you must provide a photocopy of any divorce or
death certificate

http://interglobalassist.com/nurses.htm

Canada:

The CAAT Pension Plan will accept as proof of date of death a
legible photocopy of one of the following:

- provincial death certificate

http://www.caatpension.on.ca/Staffroom/Glossary/gloss3.html

United Kingdom:

If shares were held in joint names, the account can simply be
re-registered in the sole name of the other holder. We will need a
photocopy of the death certificate to amend the register as well
as the share certificates so that we can issue replacements in the
new name.

http://www.shareview.co.uk/helpcentre/pages/faq4.aspx

etc.  A lot of uses require certified copies.  A number do not.  For
those, having a printable scan handy can be useful.

You remind me of our cocker spaniel.  We've had that dog for something
like seven years, and for all that time I've been doing this thing
where I pretend to throw the ball.  Every time, every damn time, as
soon as my arm comes forward she takes off after the ball that hasn't
been thrown.  You'd think she'd catch on after seven years, but she
doesn't.

Don't talk to me about keeping up.  You've been lapped more times than
a tractor would be in a NASCAR race in Talladega.

Ahhh, Petey, Petey, Petey.  You *still* don't understand what the

an application for a driver's license be accompanied by the original

Even without the French for comparison, it's clair that the English

(for the sake of argument, let's ignore the others): (1) duplicate or

I'm quite aware of the different meanings and uses that can be
associated with the word &quot;copy&quot;.  However, in this case, there is only
one meaning and use:  a replication of an original document.

A birth certificate is a single document that has legal standing and
acts as an official record.  It can be replicated, but any replication
is a copy that is not &quot;equally original&quot;.  The replication can be
certified as being an authentic and true replication, but it never
becomes &quot;an original copy&quot;.  That's a contradiction in terms.  The
certified copy serves as an original, because it is accepted as a true
replication, but &quot;serves as&quot; is not the same as &quot;is&quot;.

There are occasions where multiple copies are ordered where all of
those copies are to be marked as certified copies.  You may call them
a &quot;set&quot; of copies, but they are not a set of original copies.  They
are a set of copies of the original.

If Petey wants to continue to intrude into aue by following
cross-postings, then Petey should expect to have his posts critically
examined and his frequent vocabulary gaffes exposed.

Personally, I don't mind if he continues to intrude.  He's always good
for a laugh with his weaseling evasions when caught out with yet
another word bumble.

I'm joining the thread belatedly, and apologize if I'm
repeating someone else's comment/question...

What if there is no original &quot;copy&quot; (or printed &quot;original&quot;)?

When I was a working woman, I frequently had x number of
&quot;copies&quot; printed of a manual or listing, and then
distributed them. The &quot;original&quot; did not really exist except
as a Word document in my PC.

So, were they &quot;copies&quot; or &quot;originals&quot;?

Just asking.

Print-outs.

However, you are using &quot;document&quot; differently.  The birth certificate
is a blank form when printed.  It becomes a document when the
information is filled in and some authorization - like a signature -
is added to indicate that the information added is a true
representation and the document is an official record.

At that time, blank form becomes an original document.  Any copy or
facsimile of that is a copy of the original, but it may be a certified
copy and therefore acceptable as an official record for some uses.

Your &quot;documents&quot; were simply print-outs.  Like the blank forms, they
can achieve document status.  Each could become a separate original
document.

I guess you haven't ordered a birth certificate in a very long time. I
needed mine in 1992 in order to get my first passport. My mother
couldn't find the embossed-sealed photostat of the original that had
been around for 40 years, so I ordered one from New York's City Hall.
What they sent was nothing but a computer printout with an embossed
seal -- it didn't even carry a replica of the signature of Vincent I.
Impelliteri -- the only act I've ever heard of by the most
insignificant mayor of New York City in more than half a century.

Contrariwise, my mother's ten death certificates were
indistinguishable from the one that may or may not be on file in some
office in Bronx County.

I'm sure you had a point in mind when you wrote the above.  It would
have been a good thing to have included it in your post.  If you look
at my last paragraph below you'll note that I've clearly said that a
print-out can become a document.  In a paragraph above I've said that

That's what you got:  a blank form (blank paper, in this case) with

You received ten certified copies.  You stated that in an earlier

Interesting that you snipped the fact that the original, of which we
had a photostat (look _that_ up in your Funk and Wagnall's), bore the
signature of the Mayor of New York, and the current avatar does not.

I don't know why that's interesting.  &quot;Some form of authorization&quot;
could be a signature, a seal, or an embossed stamp.  I would doubt if
the original had the mayor's signature.  It probably had a replication
of the mayor's signature and the authorization would be the embossed
seal or the actual signature of some hospital, health department, or
other official.

Yes, the form is created on the blank paper when the print-out is

Whoa!  There's a new slant.  &quot;Contemporary usage&quot; no longer
incorporates the definition of the word &quot;original&quot; to mean &quot;original&quot;.

You can, of course, back this up with some examples or cites?
