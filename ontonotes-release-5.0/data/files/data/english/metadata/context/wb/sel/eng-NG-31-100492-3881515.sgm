I have a problem i have a very loud noise coming from I am assuming the
pulley area of the engine. I am not very noligable on cars sorry, and
today the oil light started flashing on and off and there is plenty of oil
is this something I should be majorly concerned about is this mean my
engine is going out? or what. I make a long drive every day for work and
am concerned.

The engine oil light came on?? Usually it is only illuminated if the
oil pressure is too low, so yes that would be a problem. The oil pump
could be going bad if you hear a squeeling noise

When does the oil light flicker on and off?   Is it when you are in drive
and stopped ??   When it flickers what is the rpm?    I'm just guessing you
have a tach.     With the engine running look under the hood and look
closely at the AC compreessor.     Does the pulley have any unusual
movements ?   Does it sound like the noise is coming from that ?    Your
compressor pulley may be getting ready to seize.     I have the same
problem.   97  3.3L      Better get it fixed if thats the problem.   You
don't want it to seize.
