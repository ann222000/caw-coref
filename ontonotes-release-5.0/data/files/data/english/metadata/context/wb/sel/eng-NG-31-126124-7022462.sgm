I like the casting idea and made a post to racdcu on it that included
a couple of links to IMDb photos:

http://google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.dc.universe/msg/17cfb01c969cbc7d

It's kinda ironic that immediately remembering the woman in that
one Smallville episode, as the only thing I'd seen the actress in,
made me think yeah she'd definitely be WW material.  Before this
casting news, I had no idea that actress was the one who ended
up in HIMYM.  I knew the Buffy actress was in HIMYM but nothing
about the other one (who I think is the future "Mother" in the title,
right?).

Getting back to your "softer" point, versus kick-ass action...

The casting of Wonder Woman might have been much better
approached differently in any case, even when Lara Croft and
Trinity from Matrix and Dark Angel were being sold as kick-ass
females at the peak of that cycle.  It probably started with
Sigourney Weaver playing Ripley from Alien 20 years prior,
but except for Xena in between it was probably the late 90s
when it really got going and I think overdone.  At this point I
think that's older hat at best and especially with WW they
should go with something a bit different.

Supergirl was a bad movie but many view Helen Slater's casting
as good and one of the few things the movie did right.  When
you're Supergirl, you don't need to look or act like a female
version of one of Arnie's characters.  Wonder Woman is a
somewhat different type than Supergirl, and it depends how
the character and story are written.  But I think WW is ideal for
an actress who's chameleon-like and can play and evoke more
than one emotion and tone.  If she CAN'T do that or if the script
doesn't build that in, it might become another Supergirl or worst
of the old TV show.

Looking at it another way, the character would have a certain
status among her "sisters", that isn't the same as the Wonder
Woman persona, that isn't the same as the secret identity, and
she'd be different in the kick-ass action (which I think Smulders
would be capable of doing) versus the love story element.  The
latter especially strikes me as something that would work better
with Smulders, which may be why they got her for the HIMYM
role.  People who've seen her only in that may not see it as
easily as I did immediately after I connected her to that Smallville
episode.

As for FOX, better for them to make a deal I think, and capitalize on
the casting and related publicity, if the TPTB wanted to cast her
for the WW role.  Maybe they shoot seasons three and four of
HIMYM together with a short break, and she's available next year,
say October 2008, for six to nine months before shooting of the
last season 5 begins.  HIMYM doesn't sound like a concept they
would want to stretch beyond 5 years, and so if development of
the movie drags out it may not be an issue anyway.  She'd be just
turning 28 as they finish the series and the role is Wonder Woman
not Wonder Girl.  So I think she'd be fine for the first movie and a
couple of sequels if it does well.

But maybe Whedon's "sorry, Cobes" comment at the end of the
post reflects his belief that the studio didn't like his casting as well
as his script.  Or maybe his FOX connections (Buffy and Angel
were both FOX-produced) may have given him a better shot at
getting her for the role than whoever the new director is.  Maybe
just the fact she's on FOX is enough for Warner Bros. to say no.  :-)
