DAYTON — Mick Montgomery, a 1964 graduate of Fairview High School, was
in the vanguard of the counterculture.

An early devotee of folk singers Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs, he learned
to play a cheap Harmony guitar and joined the Ethan Greene Singers,
which sang &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot; and &quot;Michael, Row the Boat Ashore&quot; clad
in &quot;striped shirts and dickies.&quot;

&quot;We had an original called &quot;Remember Birmingham.&quot; That's when I
realized how cool it was to write your own songs.&quot;

The 'H' word

&quot;I was a real art kid from the time I was in grade school. I was the
weirdo. I was one of the first kids at Fairview who got in trouble for
having long hair.&quot;

He started hearing the word &quot;hippie&quot; around the summer of '64. It was
not used as a term of endearment. &quot;It was the worst, dirtiest name you
could think of. I was not a pacifist. I ended up getting in quite a
few fights about being called a hippie.&quot;

The draft board rejected Montgomery for military service because he
was married with an infant. He stuck around Dayton, worked a day job
and honed his musical skills. He formed an electric band called
Tonto's Headband, which played originals and covered songs by such
acts as the Mothers of Invention, the Fuggs and the Holy Modal
Rounders. They performed at coffee houses that formerly showcased only
folkies.

&quot;We were pretty radical. We had a big UD following. We made great
friends and great enemies playing those places, because we defiled
their folk places with electric music.&quot;

&quot;That was my whole world and I was totally ate up with it, and it was
just a little drop of what was going on at the time.&quot;

Tonto's Headband rehearsed at the East Dayton commune house where
Montgomery lived.

&quot;We shared the rent enough ways that everybody came up with their
share every month.&quot; Over time, though, the house became a magnet for
runaways.

Path to San Francisco

Deciding to go to San Francisco to track down the 13th Floor
Elevators, Montgomery packed into an Opal station wagon with five
others in February 1967 and headed west.

Along the way, they were stopped by police in Oklahoma &quot;for having
long hair. They arrested us for vagrancy because we couldn't show
visible means of support. They said we couldn't go before the justice
of the peace until we looked like Americans, so we got some drunk in
the jail to cut our hair.&quot; The group was eventually fined and released.

Montgomery split up with the other Daytonians in Long Beach, Calif.,
and hitched a ride with a trucker who delivered him to the corner of
Haight and Ashbury streets in San Francisco, ground zero of the
counterculture.

&quot;I think I had 45, 50 bucks in my pocket.&quot; As he stepped out of the
truck, he saw people wearing wild clothes, beads and Afro hairdos.

&quot;It was like, 'Whoa, this is a Fellini move!' It was just culture
shock, really. I was with all these total freaks and all of a sudden
it was like I was the straight guy. I'm walking down the street and
somebody says, 'Hey, Mick.' This was like 15 minutes after I got there.&quot;

It was a friend from the University of Dayton, who helped Montgomery
find lodging with other Dayton transplants in &quot;a big, three-story
mansion that was just the cliche of the hippie commune house&quot; with a
psychedelic paint job and flowers painted on the walls. &quot;I ended up
living at that house for almost a year.&quot;

The house wasn't far from the original Fillmore, Carousel and Avalon
ballrooms, and Montgomery saw local bands like Creedence Clearwater
Revival and Fish. &quot;We helped (Janis) Joplin and Big Brother (and the
Holding Company) move their equipment.&quot; He saw the Grateful Dead at
free concerts in Golden Gate Park.

The Summer of Love

The light shows were almost as big a draw for the ballrooms as the
bands. Eyedrops would glow in the black light, and people painted
their faces with them. Sometimes, &quot;people got amorous and started
going at each other in twos and threes. It was the Summer of Love — it
was like, 'Love your neighbor.' The down side of that was the free
clinic — and crabs.&quot;

The peace-and-love image of Haight-Ashbury was genuine — for awhile.
But the spotlight on the neighborhood increasingly drew runaways,
thieves and addicts.

Montgomery moved to Los Angeles in 1968, after he'd been robbed at
gunpoint in the Haight for the second time.

&quot;The Summer of Love was truly a remarkable experience. I met people
from all over the world and made it without any money to speak of.
Music and art and a lot of the cultural things were so intertwined. It
was a perfect storm, a real popular cultural revolution. There were so
many things happening that made people feel like the world was
becoming a better place.&quot;

Back home in Dayton

Montgomery eventually returned to Dayton. He founded the Canal Street
Tavern in 1981.

&quot;We had the thing of being invincible and immortal, and we got away
with it for a few years. Then they shot a few kids at Kent State and a
few demonstrators in L.A. The powers-that-be reasserted control.&quot;

After the Vietnam War ended, it was time to &quot;figure out how you're
going to make a living, how your kids were going to have it better
than you had it, face the responsibilities that we put off for a few
years.&quot;

Could 1960s-style activism make a comeback?

&quot;The old rubber band stretches in one direction and then another.
Maybe it's time for it to stretch in the other direction and decide
we're not going to live in fear.&quot;

Thanks Hoodude - I go to Canal Street fairly often, and of course spoken to
Mick, but
didn't know his story. Good guy, and a great little club. I've seen some
great shows there.
Adrian Belew and the Bears have played there every tour.
