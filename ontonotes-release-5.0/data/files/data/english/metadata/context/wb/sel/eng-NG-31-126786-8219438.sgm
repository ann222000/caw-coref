&lt; http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click;_id=594&amp;art;_id=nw2007071... &gt; 1.1 The offer was peanuts, says union

IOL, 12 July 2007
National power utility Eskom tabled an offer to settle a dispute with trade unions at a conciliation meeting on Thursday.

Solidarity spokesperson Jaco Kleynhans said a two-year offer was tabled with respective seven percent and eight percent increases.

Parties would meet again next Tuesday.

The offer was &quot;peanuts&quot;, said National Union of Mineworkers (Num) spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka.

&quot;We don't take kindly to that - we'll definitely go to war with them. They are playing games.&quot;

The Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) mediated the dispute with the Num, National Union of Metalworkers of South African (Numsa) and Solidarity on Wednesday and Thursday.

Kleynhans said, &quot;We as the unions will go back to our members and ask them if they are happy with the two year agreement.&quot;

The dispute was declared by Eskom last Friday.

The pay dispute was at the top of the agenda with issues such as housing and pension postponed until the main area of contestation was settled, said Seshoka.

The CCMA offered assistance to parties in May but none consented. A further offer of assistance in June was agreed to by unions, but not Eskom.

Eskom then agreed to the offer of intervention, in terms of section 150 of the Labour Relations Act, last week.

Eskom spokesperson Fani Zulu said on Thursday the utility would comment later. - Sapa

&lt; http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click;_id=594&amp;art;_id=nw2007071... &gt; 1.2 Eskom: Unions remain headstrong

IOL 12 July 2007
Unions rejected a pay offer from Eskom on Thursday that left certain workers with raises of less than 7.5 percent.

The offer was made at a two-day conciliation process facilitated by the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).

Meanwhile, the parastatal said the National Union of Mineworkers of SA (Numsa), the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and Solidarity had until Tuesday to consider the offer.

If it was rejected, Eskom said it would return to offering a package that included a minimum guaranteed increase of seven percent for all employees in the bargaining unit.

The NUM said the CCMA had advised Eskom to put on the table something above 7.5 percent, which is considered a benchmark set by the public service.

&quot;Eskom continued to preach their daily sermons of 6.5 and five respectively and showed no remorse,&quot; said NUM spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka.

However, Eskom pointed out that in addition to the minimum guaranteed increase, it was offering a sliding scale increase of up to three percent more for lower paid employees.

&quot;If the three unions accept this offer, 57 percent of Eskom employees in the bargaining unit will receive a salary increase of eight to ten percent with the remaining 43 percent receiving a salary increase of seven to eight percent,&quot; said Eskom personnel chief Mpho Letlape.

The offer was such that some employees would receive increases of up to 10 percent, the parastatal said.

Seshoka went on to say NUM would do everything possible to make Eskom &quot;live to regret&quot; not changing their offer.

Eskom said the unions had not revised their demand and were still maintaining a demand of 9.75 percent increase across the board for July 2007.

Eskom declared a dispute last Friday. - Sapa

&lt; http://www.sabcnews.co.za/economy/labour/0,2172,152448,00.html &gt; 1.3 Unions declare dispute with coal mine

SABC, 12 July 2007
Trade unions Solidarity and the National Union of Mineworkers (Num) declared a wage dispute with coal mines represented in the Chamber of Mines today, both unions said.

The mines are offering 7.25%, while the two unions are demanding 15%. &quot;The trade unions found this unacceptable and they asked the employers to revise their offer, but employers decided to stand by the 7.25% offer,&quot; Reint Dykema, the unions' spokesperson said.

The chamber of mines had revised its offer with a 0.25% improvement, following a previous offer of 7%. Frans Baleni, the Num general secretary, said the company's reluctance to move forward has set them on a collision course with Num members who gave them strict instructions to &quot;accept no less than a double-digit&quot; figure.

Complaint to be lodged
Both unions are to lodge a complaint with the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). Dykema said: &quot;Professional assistance will be needed to save the situation.&quot;

Eric Nwedo, the Chamber of Mines negotiator, said the chamber indicated to the unions that their demands would cause significant cost implications to the company. The demands include living out allowances (e.g. housing) and higher contributions to the retirement funds, funeral cover and service increment.

&quot;We need clarity from the unions about these demands before we can move forward. We are appealing to the unions to prioritise their demands and urge them to reconsider their stance on these issues,&quot; Nwedo said.

Regarding the dispute, Nwedo said the chamber was firmly committed to giving its full support to the mediator in the CCMA. - Sapa

&lt; http://www.mineweb.net/mineweb/view/mineweb/en/page35?oid=23344&amp;sn;=De... &gt; 1.4 Anglo Platinum earnings suffer from labour action

Tessa Kruger, Mineweb, 12 July 2007
Angloplats is hopeful to resolve wage disputes with South African labour unions through new bi-lateral negotiations, but majority union NUM is threatening strike action if they don't see an improved offer.

A day after unions walked out of wage negotiations with Anglo Platinum the company released a statement saying its production in the first half of this year was affected by major strike action and unsettling wage negotiations.

However, spokesperson for Anglo Platinum Simon Tebele told Mineweb that the company planned to conduct bi-lateral discussions with each of the unions involved in order to reach a wage settlement.

Tebele said Anglo Platinum was the first company in the local mining industry to offer mineworkers a double-digit increase. The company's last offer since it started negotiating with the unions six weeks ago was an annual increase of between 8 and 10%.

Angloplats also offered workers a once-off payment equal to their monthly salaries.

Major labour union - the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) walked away from this offer and Solidarity had walked out of negotiations before this offer was made. But three smaller unions - TAWUSA, Alliance and UASA - agreed to take the offer back for discussion with their members.

Tebele contended, despite Solidarity and NUM's announcements that they would lodge disputes against the company, that there was no acrimony between the parties and that negotiations were conducted in good spirit.

&quot;There is no date set for the bi-lateral talks yet, but the process is looking very positive and strike action is not looming yet.&quot;

Tebele confirmed that about 39,000 of Anglo Platinum's 46 000 workers in the country were unionised.

The local platinum industry is conducting its wage negotiations independently and is not represented as a group by the South African Chamber of Mines.

Solidarity spokesperson Reint Dykema said the parties were much closer to each other then they realised. If the company increased its 8% offer for the majority of workers to 10% they would be very close to the union's current demand of 12%.

He said the union would &quot;welcome&quot; bilateral talks and confirmed the process was proceeding in a positive spirit.

Dykema said that unions were under severe pressure from members this year to negotiate an increase of ten percent or more as essentials in the inflation basket, such as food, has risen by 9.3%.

However, majority union NUM said Anglo Platinum was not likely to improve its offer and the union would not accept anything under a &quot;double digit&quot; increase in bi-lateral talks.

Spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka said the bi-lateral talks were aimed at dividing and ruling the unions and the company should rather make their offer in the combined open forum.

&quot;Anglo should not forget that we are the majority union in these talks.

&quot;Angloplats has remained steadfast at 8-10%, while we have made it clear that we want 12% for the cleaners in category A and 11% and 10% for the majority of workers in categories B and C.&quot;

&quot;We have approached the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to issue a certificate of non-resolution of a dispute and Anglo Platinum could see strike action soon,&quot; said Seshoka.

However, he did confirm that the CCMA had 30 days to conciliate between the parties and to respond to its application.

Seshoka said NUM represented 26,000 of Angloplats workers in South Africa.

Anglo Platinum advised shareholders today that earnings per share and headline earnings per share for the six months ended June are expected to be between 40% and 50% higher than earnings for the half-year ended June last year.

The company said &quot;production efficiency&quot; fell on the back of a lack of skilled labour, strike action at joint ventures, the unsettled labour situation associated with wage negotiations and more fatal events.

Company spokesperson Trevor Raymond said the company would only elaborate on the company's performance and productivity at the announcement of its interim results at the end of the month.

NUMSA

&lt; http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click;_id=594&amp;art;_id=vn2007071... &gt; 2.1 Still no deal on metal strike, says Numsa

Ella Smook, Cape Argus, 12 July 2007
Trade union Solidarity announced on Wednesday afternoon that an agreement had been reached and that the strike had ended.

But while Solidarity has agreed to salary increases of between eight percent and nine percent in addition to employee share ownership benefits, Numsa says it has not yet agreed to anything.

Shortly after the wage negotiation meeting in Johannesburg, Solidarity spokesperson Jaco Kleynhans described the strike as a worthwhile process.

Employers started to realise there is a real problem with the skills shortage and the skills shortage is now on the national agenda, he told the Cape Argus. We see this offer as an indication that the strike was successful.

But Mziwakhe Hlangani, spokesperson of Numsa, said no agreement had been reached. There were proposals, but we have to go back to the regions and report back to them.

Hlangani said Numsa would meet with management again on Friday and he did not want to elaborate on the details of the proposals before presenting it to members at local level.

Members will be holding meetings and we'll get their responses, after which we will finetune the proposals, he said, but added one can safely say management has made an improvement from their original offer.

From Numsa's point of view, the strike continues. The strike will continue until employers have made a substantial offer, Numsa general secretary Silumko Nondwangu told reporters in Johannesburg. There is no deal without Numsa, he said.

Solidarity hastily retracted its inclusion of Numsa on the press release which stated that both unions had agreed to the wage agreement.

Kleynhans said Solidarity would continue to support Numsa, which represents the majority of workers.

&lt; http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click;_id=594&amp;art;_id=iol118423... &gt; 2.2 Is Numsa ready to settle?

Bonile Ngqiyaza, IOL, 12 July 2007
The strike in the metal engineering sector may be called off on Friday after parties reached agreement on what unions have termed a &quot;basis for a settlement&quot;.

The National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) - the biggest union in the sector and which, together with other unions, said on Thursday morning it would be taking the terms of the agreement back to its members, with a recommendation to settle.

Numsa secretary general Silumko Nondwangu denied a statement by the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of SA (Seifsa) that an agreement had been reached to settle.

He said this could only take place after unions' regions accept the terms of the settlement. &quot;You don't simply settle in negotiation.&quot;

&quot;We are now taking this back to our constitutional structures, with a recommendation to settle. If they agree, the strike would be called off tomorrow (Friday), and workers would return back to work on Monday.&quot; - IOL

&lt; http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click;_id=594&amp;art;_id=nw2007071... &gt; 2.3 Striking workers accused of assault

IOL, 12 July 2007
Two cases of assault, allegedly by striking metal and engineering protesters, were being investigated by Germiston police on Thursday.

Captain Steady Nawa said two men were beaten with sticks and knobkerries in separate incidents in Industries West in Germiston on Wednesday.

At 7.55am a man walking along Sigma Street was assaulted after telling a group of protesters that he was going to work.

And, at 9.30am, a worker was surrounded and beaten when he went to fetch something from his car parked outside company premises in Smit Street.

&quot;He was confronted by a group of protesters who surrounded him and asked him what he was doing and who he worked for. After he explained, they started assaulting him with sticks and knobkerries.&quot;

The man was bruised on his head and all over his body, Nawa said.

Nawa appealed for non-violence by strikers.

&quot;We're not against the industrial action but we are against the violence. We will not hesitate to take drastic action against those who are committing crime in the name of industrial action.&quot;

No arrests had been made but Nawa said police would &quot;take action soon&quot;.

Two cases of assault with intention to cause grievous bodily harm were opened. - Sapa

&lt; http://www.sabcnews.co.za/economy/business/0,2172,152444,00.html &gt; 2.4 Unions, metal industry sign landmark 3-year deal

SABC, 12 July 2007
Employers in the steel and engineering industry expect to be fully operational by tomorrow. The industry says it has reached a landmark three-year wage deal with the six unions in the sector.

However, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) is yet to sign the settlement agreement. The agreement will see bottom grade workers receive a 9% increase, while artisans will get 8%. Workers will get a further increase of between 7% and 8% in the next two years. Brian Angus, the Steel and Engineering Industry Federation of South Africa (Seifsa) executive director, says it is the first time that a three-year wage agreement is reached.

For Numsa members the strike continues. The union says its members will only return to factory floors if they agree to the wage deal. The strike affected about 9 000 companies across the country and severely affected the motor industry, forcing some production areas to shut down, as manufacturing at some companies was disrupted. Also added in the wage agreement is for improvements in severance pay and afternoon shift allowance.

The negotiators have also agreed to guidelines in Employee Share Ownership Schemes. Solidarity, the other big union in the sector, yesterday signed the three-year wage agreement and its members returned to work today. Numsa says it has recommended to their members to accept the offer but will wait for feedback.

&lt; http://business.iafrica.com/news/504698.htm &gt; 2.5 Violent metals strike could be over
Business.iafrica/SAPA, 12 July 2007
A wage strike in the metal and engineering industry could be over, the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) said on Thursday.

Numsa spokesperson Mziwakhe Hlangani said the union - which represents the majority of workers - had concluded a &quot;historic agreement&quot; on Thursday night with employer organisations.

He said the union was expecting approval of the agreement from the shop stewards' council and the regions before it signed on Friday.

'Unprecedented deal'

&quot;Striking workers will be expected to return to work on Monday next week,&quot; he said.

Numsa General Secretary Silumko Nondwangu described the agreement as an &quot;unprecedented deal which surpasses all other negotiated settlements in most sectors&quot;.

Hlangani said the Steel and Engineering Industry Federation of SA (Seifsa) - which represents about 9000 engineering companies - also agreed in principle to a nine percent wage increase for the lowest paid workers and eight percent for the advanced A grade level.

Job opportunities

This would be effective from 1 July, 2007. Wages would be increased by 8.1 percent and 7.1 percent respectively in 2008 and 2009.

He said the three-year deal allowed for a new five-grade job structure, an employee share ownership scheme, more job opportunities in industry and skills development.

&quot;In a major victory for metalworkers the parties, involving other progressive unions, also agreed to improve afternoon shift allowances by a considerable eight percent increase,&quot; he said.

Strike continues

Meanwhile, Seifsa Director Brian Angus said the strike - which began on Monday - was continuing despite the agreement.

&quot;The strike is still continuing and it's marred by further acts of violence,&quot; he said.

Germiston police on Thursday were investigating two cases of assault.

Captain Steady Nawa said two men were beaten with sticks and knobkerries in separate incidents in Industries West in Germiston on Wednesday.

Nawa appealed for non-violence.

&quot;We're not against the industrial action but we are against the violence. We will not hesitate to take drastic action against those who are committing crime in the name of industrial action.&quot;

Employers blamed

Hlangani said the acts of violence - allegedly committed by Numsa members - had not been brought to the union's attention.

&quot;It has not yet been brought to our attention, however we feel that the employers are to blame for allowing this confusion to go un-monitored.&quot;

He said the confusion stemmed from trade union Solidarity on Wednesday declaring that Numsa and Solidarity had reached an agreement with employers and that workers were to return to work.

&quot;There was confusion when workers reported without waiting for the formal announcement (from management) and other workers were protesting outside. To my understanding they were shouted at,&quot; he said.

On Wednesday afternoon, Solidarity retracted an earlier statement that only Solidarity, not Numsa, had agreement to an offer by employers and called its members back to work.

&quot;We have stated very clearly that we are against any sort of violence,&quot; said Hlangani.

McBride

&lt; http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=515006 &gt; 3.1 Union says 'McBride must go'

Thokozani Mtshali and Borrie La Grange, The Times, 13 July 2007
Samwu wants Ekurhuleni council to suspend controversial police chief.

THE South African Municipal Workers Union yesterday challenged metro police chief Robert McBride's bosses to suspend him.

The union said McBride, who was served with an interdict on Wednesday that prohibits him from threatening, harassing or intimidating three of his policemen, is still at his job, despite the allegations against him.

The union said this was inconsistent because the municipality had previously suspended officials accused of lesser offences, such as insubordination.

The union's Koena Ramotlou said: &quot;The city manager and the mayor must be seen to be consistent in enforcing discipline because right now they are treating McBride with kid gloves, whereas they treat other officials with an iron fist. The man is dragging the name of the council down and he has threatened to shoot and kill council employees.

&quot;McBride must be suspended like any employee of the council without compromising the principle of discipline.&quot;

But the Ekurhuleni metro council yesterday insisted that it would not suspend its embattled police chief because it believed the allegations against him were &quot;baseless&quot;.

Ekurhuleni mayor Duma Nkosi's political adviser, Prince Hamnca said: &quot;There's no basis for us to even consider a suspension. We don't understand why the union came to that conclusion. Our view is that Robert (McBride) is innocent until proved guilty.

&quot;But also there are institutions ... currently dealing with these matters and some of the allegations levelled against Robert.&quot;

The National Prosecuting Authority is still to decide whether to charge McBride in connection with the car accident that sparked the latest controversy.

Hamnca said Nkosi was not concerned about the negative publicity attracted by McBride because it had no effect on the municipality.

Ekurhuleni city manager Patrick Flusk has also come out in support of McBride.

&quot;Why do we tackle the person who fights crime best. People in the media and elsewhere do not want us to succeed.&quot;

&lt; http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3930765 &gt; 3.2 McBride tells a different story

Anna Louw, The Star, 13 July 2007
They're out to discredit me, claims metro police chief.

'Justice always takes long to come to me,&quot; says Robert McBride - his composure unshakable.

&quot;I don't like slinging mud, but it is good that they have shown their hand. The legal process has begun and now there is no turning back. I'm in the breach and having my say.&quot;

&quot;They&quot; are Stanley Sagathevan, Patrick Johnson and Itumeleng Koko, who were granted a restraining order against McBride and members of the Ekurhuleni metro police department in an urgent application in the Johannesburg High Court two days ago.

Sitting in a small office on the third floor of the metro police department's headquarters in Bedfordview, the gaze of the Ekurhuleni metro police chief is unwavering.

&quot;There is no real conspiracy here, as I've done nothing wrong,&quot; McBride says. His arms are uncrossed; he is relaxed and matter of fact.

&quot;This is about personal issues of survival of a small number of metro police officers and some members of the Organised Crime Unit.&quot;

The irony, McBride says, is that Sagathevan wasn't at the scene of his car crash in Centurion after an end-of-year function in December. In fact, McBride alleges Sagathevan was busy selling plasma screens from a truck hijacked on the N3.

McBride says he was the last to arrive and the first to leave, that he did not drink at all and that he played soccer with his men at the function.

His deputy police chief, Ash Boodhoo, was the first to arrive at the accident scene, but McBride points out that there is no connection between his accident and what is about to unfold.

McBride tells about the intrigue of a handful of metro cops and their &quot;inappropriate relationship&quot; with a &quot;bad element&quot; in the SAPS's Organised Crime Unit in Germiston.

&quot;I have started putting my nose into a lot of things and I am uncovering more&quot; - which brings him to his visit to a C-Max prisoner in Pretoria whom he said visited &quot;to confront him about paying off cops in the Organised Crime Unit&quot;.

McBride stresses that the majority of the Organised Crime Unit police officers are hard working and act within the law, but that there is a bad element who are in cahoots with a handful of his officers.

The trail leads to a small fiefdom of connections with cash-in-transit heist robbers; bank scams with cops striking up relationships with girlfriends in banks and getting them to approve their credit; and a luxury BMW with a criminal history of its own.

It goes back to SAPS case number 368/11/2005, which McBride says was a watertight case derailed after incriminating evidence was removed from the police docket. The investigation was related to robbery at a scrap metal dealer in Dunswart, Boksburg, in November 2005.

Johnson's son Zane Johnson, a constable in his mid-20s, and a police informer, Africa Mteto, were later picked out at an identity parade conducted by an Inspector Horn of the Organised Crime Unit in Germiston.

Three security guards placed Zane Johnson and Mteto at the scene of the alleged crime, which involved copper and aluminium cable valued at about R1-million.

McBride says he knows that some members in that unit are trying to discredit him because they fear that he might be considered for the position of provincial commissioner and the word is out that &quot;He (McBride) must be stopped. We don't want him with his foot on our necks.&quot;

Asked if he would take the job of commissioner, McBride says &quot;No, I'm committed to Ekurhuleni.&quot;

After all, it was his department's sniffer dogs which uncovered the drug factory in Alberton to which Glenn Agliotti has been linked.

McBride says Sagathevan, Johnson and Koko are waging a campaign to discredit him so that nobody will believe what he has uncovered.

He adds he had earmarked Koko for bigger things. &quot;I don't know how he got involved with the other guys, he is intelligent and I viewed him as someone who was upwardly mobile.

&quot;Stanley has a love for material things, he likes to personalise cars. He is the brigadier of bling. After my appointment, he was extremely helpful. If I said I had to pay my water and lights bill, he would offer to do it for me. He made himself indispensable,&quot; says McBride.

Sagathevan soon got the nickname &quot;Little Chief&quot; or &quot;Satan&quot; because he always managed got things done by saying &quot;The chief says ...&quot;

&lt; http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=313812&amp;area;=/insight/i... &gt; 3.3 Twist in McBride saga

Adriaan Basson, Mail &amp; Guardian, 13 July 2007
The Robert McBride drunk-driving imbroglio got murkier this week, as it was revealed that the three metro police officers who have accused the Ekurhuleni police chief of intimidation are themselves the subjects of a string of criminal investigations.

The Mail &amp; Guardian has learnt that Chief Superintendent Stanley Segathevan and Superintendents Patrick Johnson and Itumeleng Koko are being investigated by the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) and the South African Police Service in connection with a wide range of serious offences.

An allegedly unsuccessful attempt by Segathevan and Johnson to break into McBride's Bedfordview office is the latest of these.

On Wednesday this week, the three men, who were recently suspended by the EMPD, won an interim protection order against McBride and his top brass, preventing the latter from &quot;intimidating, harassing or threatening&quot; them.

They claimed the respondents, especially McBride, had threatened to kill them and their children and rape their wives. Their legal representative told the Johannesburg High Court her clients have gone into hiding.

The application followed this week's revelation of the contents of new affidavits the three men submitted to the NPA regarding McBride's controversial car accident last year after a year-end function near Hartebeespoort Dam.

The Star reported on Monday that the three officers -- two of whom previously proclaimed McBride's innocence under oath -- had now turned against the EMPD chief, alleging he consumed a large amount of whiskey at the function and that he ordered them to cover up the accident.

The NPA was told a false medical report was allegedly obtained and the men were &quot;forced&quot; to give false statements under oath.

In an interview on Thursday, McBride hit back at the officers, accusing them of making false statements about his accident after the EMPD and SAPS started investigating their role in serious crimes.

He said he would only provide full details of the investigations in his replying affidavit, to be filed on the interdict return date of July 24.

McBride admits that the three men, especially Segathevan, were previously close to him. &quot;I came here and in my naivety didn't realise that he [Segathevan] moved closer to me to gain more influence,&quot; McBride told the M&amp;G.

It is understood that in court on July 24 McBride will deny that Segathevan was at the scene on the night of the accident, and will allege that he was selling plasma screen televisions obtained from a hijacked truck.

The M&amp;G understands that Segathevan is being investigated for trying to sell the screens to another police officer.

According to a police source in the know, a &quot;pattern of the unauthorised use of confiscated vehicles&quot; is also being investigated against Segathevan and Johnson.

Johnson is alleged to have taken a confiscated quad bike to an EMPD service provider for repair. When confronted about this, he allegedy said the bike was being moved to a police pound.

Another incident McBride will allegedly refer to is an &quot;illegal raid&quot; on the house of an EMPD superintendent.

The SAPS has been asked to conduct a criminal investigation into Segathevan and Koko for their roles in this operation.

The M&amp;G understands that McBride will also draw on an EMPD investigation into police corruption in which Segathevan was involved. Senior police officers allegedly took part in this probe and asked McBride for certain information about some of his officers.

Segathevan allegedly refused to subject his firearm to ballistic tests and told McBride &quot;we will change our statements about the accident&quot;.

After the three officers were suspended, the EMPD searched their offices and allegedly found official stamps, keys to council offices and cars and a hacksaw in Johnson's.

He is also being investigated in connection with the falsification of his matric qualifications. A copy of his &quot;false&quot; SAPS identification card was leaked to the M&amp;G.

An EMPD source said the metro police were &quot;flooded&quot; with information after pictures of the three men appeared in newspapers this week.

McBride maintains his innocence over the accident and claims the NPA has not yet told him that he will be charged with drunk or reckless driving.

He gave the following version of what happened on the night of the accident to the M&amp;G. &quot;I went alone to the year-end function of the EMPD at Hartebeespoort Dam. I was the last to arrive and the first to leave. I left between 6pm and 7pm.

&quot;I consumed no alcohol at the function and was only supposed to deliver a speech of half an hour, thanking my staff for their hard work.

&quot;I had to leave to meet an informant. When I arrived [at the venue] the guys were playing soccer and I joined them. Remember that by then my insulin dosage had been increased [he is diabetic].

&quot;A day before the accident I even fell asleep at the traffic light. Johnson and Koko still had to fetch me and drive me home.

&quot;I gave a speech and left. By the time I arrived at the function, it was almost finished. I closed the event. That was the only way they could come to my assistance.&quot;

McBride claims that he cannot remember what happened after the accident. He does, however, recall that he was taken to his doctor, Segathevan's brother.
&quot;He has been my doctor for over a year. He is the same person who increased my insulin dosage.&quot;

McBride confirmed that he had subsequently travelled to Durban, but denied that the purpose of the trip was to obtain a false medical certificate.

He said he was referred by his lawyer to a specialist in Durban, whose name he could not recall. &quot;This was done in an attempt to explain my blackout [during the accident].&quot;

McBride also attacked Segathevan's claim that everything on the Durban trip was paid for in cash. &quot;They are talking absolute nonsense,&quot; he said. &quot;When I go on trips, I use my credit card.&quot;

Saleem Ebrahim, lawyer for the three officers, on Thursday denied knowledge of the investigation into his clients. &quot;I am not representing them on any other matters,&quot; Ebrahim added.

He also told the M&amp;G it is impossible to contact the men. &quot;To tell you the truth, if is even difficult for me to get hold of them at this point in time.&quot;

IOL July 12 2007
A branch of South Africa's largest municipal trade union has demanded the suspension of Ekurhuleni metro police chief Robert McBride and accused metro leaders of inconsistent disciplinary measures.

&quot;We demand the suspension of Robert McBride,&quot; said South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) East Rand branch secretary Koena Ramotlou.

&quot;He should be suspended like any employee of council without compromising the principle of discipline.&quot;

Junior workers were suspended for &quot;mere insubordination&quot;, said Ramotlou.

&quot;But McBride who has damaged council property gets to wait for a commission of enquiry to look into prima face evidence against him.&quot;

Ekurhuleni mayoral spokesperson Prince Hamnca said a process to verify allegations against McBride had taken place and not a commission of enquiry, or disciplinary process.

&quot;They (Samwu) came to us with a number of allegations and we set up a process and appointed two conciliators to verify a number of allegations [aimed] at the metro police chief.&quot;

A report was handed to mayor Duma Nkosi on July 6 and would be presented to the mayoral committee at the end of the month.

Two conciliators from the South African local government bargaining council facilitated the verification process.

On Wednesday, the Johannesburg High Court ordered McBride and five of his metro police officers not to intimidate, harass or threaten three suspended colleagues.

The three have gone into hiding out of fear for their lives, the court was told on Wednesday.

This, since the publication in a daily newspaper on Monday of excerpts of their statements to the National Prosecuting Authority about a car crash involving McBride in December.

Their counsel, Marne Strydom, told the court that Chief Superintendents Stanley Segathevan and Patrick Johnston, and Superintendent Itumeleng Koko were &quot;living in terror&quot;.

McBride has denied allegations that he was drunk at the time of the car crash and claims to remember nothing of the incident.

At the time, metro police were accused of assaulting witnesses who tried to stop them removing McBride from the scene, and of trying to cover up for him.

Ramotlou said the three suspended officers were part of 11 witnesses, either currently or previously also an officer, who were supposed to testify at the metro probe into the allegations against McBride.

The union's allegations centred around abuse of power, corruption and damage to council property, the latter referring to the metro-owned car that was crashed.

Samwu said some witnesses, six officers and union leaders, did not testify as one commissioner was unavailable at the end of June.

Meanwhile, Hamnca said an investigation into the December crash was a separate police matter.

&quot;Our job is service delivery. It's a police matter...We believe they are capable of doing their job.&quot;

If the investigation found McBride guilty, that was another process, he said.

&quot;We can't act on Robert based on allegations.&quot; - Sapa

News24, 12 July 2007
A North West owner of 10 lions that killed a boy has offered to sell two of the animals to compensate the child's family, the province said on Thursday.

North West agriculture, conservation and environment MEC Mandlenkosi Mayisela said Tommy van Vuuren realised that money - about R700 000 - could not make up for the loss of a life.

&quot;But he has offered to sell a male and a female lion and the money would go to the mother.&quot;

Nine-year-old Tshepo Gaerupe was killed by the lions on a farm near Vryburg.

The lions apparently grabbed the boy and pulled him into their enclosure after he put his hand through a gap near the entrance gate.

Only a piece of the boy's skull remained after the killing on June 17.

Mayisela said his department confiscated the lions on Tuesday on receiving a report on a three-week investigation conducted at the farm.

&quot;First, the report said Van Vuuren did not have a valid permit, it actually expired.

Lions ordered to be returned
&quot;Two, the infrastructure was not up to what was required, specifically with regard to the gate where the boy was grabbed,&quot; he said.

The MEC said the gate should have had electric fencing as well as ordinary fencing.

On Wednesday, Van Vuuren lodged an application at the High Court in Mmabatho demanding that the lions be returned to him.

The court found in his favour, based on an old ordinance used by the department to confiscate the animals.

&quot;The judge noted an element of unconstitutionality in one of the ordinances we were using and ordered that the lions be returned (to the farmer),&quot; Mayisela said.

Van Vuuren then offered to pay the cost of transporting the animals back to the farm, if the department paid the veterinary costs of darting them.

He also offered the price of the two lions to the family.

Mayisela said as far as the department was concerned the only outstanding issue was Van Vuuren's permit, or lack thereof.

He would have to apply for a permit. If it was rejected, the lions would be put down.

&quot;I cannot say at this stage whether the application will be approved or disapproved,&quot; Mayisela said.

'Consider the lions, too'
A week after the incident Van Vuuren improved the fencing around the enclosure and applied for a renewal of his permit which expired earlier this year.

Meanwhile, the Wildlife Unit of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals called on Thursday for the &quot;welfare of the lions involved in the tragic killing&quot; of Gaerupe to be considered.

&quot;In addition to the repeated use of tranquillising drugs is the stress of transporting wild animals,&quot; said spokesperson Alistair Sinclair.

SABC 12 July 12 2007
The Eastern Cape department of education and teachers unions in the province have failed to reach a decision regarding the recovery plan for learners. The plan is intended to make up for time lost during the public sector wage strike.

Loyiso Pulumani, the departmental spokesperson, says that there are certain issues that they agreed upon. He says some of the difficult issues will be discussed today at the national meeting in Pretoria.

Sadtu in the province says it is prepared to engage in the recovery plan, provided the department is prepared to meet the teachers' needs. Mxolisi Dimaza, the provincial secretary, says that if government decides that their teachers do the recovery plan without being paid, the union will challenge that.

&lt; http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/topstories.aspx?ID=BD4A515300 &gt; 5.1 Nationalise Sasol and Mittal - SACP
Karima Brown and Amy Musgrave Business Day 13 July 2007
South African Communist Party (SACP) general secretary Blade Nzimande has called for the re-nationalisation of Sasol and Mittal Steel SA to ensure sustainable energy security for SA.

Nzimande told delegates to the party's elective congress in Port Elizabeth yesterday that it was absurd that SA was paying high prices for steel and oil produced in the country.

&quot;Why do we now have to pay not just import parity prices but as much as a 30% premium when compared to India and China for our own steel?

&quot;About 40% of our oil comes from Sasol, but we are paying international prices. We could be paying much less,&quot; he said.

Nzimande urged delegates to pass a resolution calling on the state to take control of the two companies.

His call comes amid debate over the role of the state and state-owned enterprises in economic development.

At the recent African National Congress (ANC) policy meeting, delegates supported a strong developmental state actively intervening in the economy. Nzimande said many ANC delegates supported the nationali sation of the two companies. This was in line with the affirmation of a strategic state-owned sector.

The ANC conference had also called for the setting up of a public sector housing bank and a state-owned mining company.

The SACP has said that the state-led infrastructure development programme is tending to have a perverse effect on the country's balance of payments.

While construction sites are booming across the country, this has led to major imports of capital goods for this construction. &quot;The infrastructure programme is also adversely impacted upon by multinational corporations operating and producing within SA but charging us import parity prices for key inputs like cement and steel,&quot; the party has said.

The government has locked horns with both entities.

The government and Mittal Steel SA, Africa's largest steel producer, disagree on the so-called &quot;developmental pricing model&quot;, which is meant to replace the company's import parity pricing model which has come under much criticism.

Mittal has said the new model has already shaved about R550 m off its revenue.

At the end of the month Mittal will be arguing in mitigation at the Competition Tribunal that it has abused its dominant market position and charged excessive prices. The case was first brought to the Competition Commission in 2003.

On Sasol, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has said the government is considering imposing a &quot;windfall tax&quot; on profits made from synthetic fuels.

Sasol's import parity pricing model means that it charges international prices for locally produced fuel.

The SACP has come out in support of Manuel, saying Sasol's reaction to the windfall tax was a reminder of how dangerous it was to leave key strategic assets in the hands of a profit-maximi sing capitalist sector which has no empathy for SA's economic and developmental challenges.

Until recently two state entities - the Public Investment Corporation and the Industrial Development Corporation - had significant stakes in Iscor.

Nzimande asked which state bureaucrat &quot;had happily sold off this national strategic resource&quot;.

He attacked deployed cadres in the government whom he said had come to identify with &quot;the agenda&quot; of big capital.

&quot;Who, for instance, sold off our major steel producer Iscor to the Mittal family empire?&quot; Nzimande asked.

The SACP also called for an investigation into the behaviour of the so-called &quot;deployed comrades&quot; in both cases.

The party said SA's parastatals, state-owned enterprises and state financial institutions should not be abused and &quot;plundered&quot; for personal gain.

&lt; http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/topstories.aspx?ID=BD4A515299 &gt; 5.2 Party not likely to cut ties with ANC
Karima Brown and Amy Musgrave Business Day 13 July 2007
THE South African Communist Party (SACP) is unlikely to contest elections independent of the African National Congress (ANC) if its central committee political report observations on the debate are anything to go by.

The party will also remain in the tripartite alliance with the ANC and the Congress of South African Trade Unions despite it wanting a change in the status quo. The alliance has come under considerable strain over the respective roles of each ally. This has led to heated debates over the ANC's strategy and tactics document, and who constitutes partners for fundamental change in transforming society.

The role of business and whether black business in particular can be a force for change has been a sticking point.

Also at issue is the SACP's firm belief that the ANC under President Thabo Mbeki has been captured by big business at the expense of its core constituency, the poor.

While Mbeki has insisted that the ANC has never been a socialist movement, the SACP says the movement had up until very recently never declared itself a capitalist organisation.

This is the context in which the two-year-old debate on whether the SACP should contest elections alone has escalated.

Yesterday the party's top brass welcomed the debate which has been overseen by a special commission, but warned against reducing the SACP to a &quot;narrowly&quot; electoralist formation.

The Gauteng SACP has called for the party to contest elections under its own banner. This call has resonated in sections of the ANC and business.

However, the SACP's central committee recommended to its elective congress being held in Port Elizabeth that no final decision be taken on the matter at this stage.

Addressing delegates yesterday, SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande said the party had noted continuous attempts by big capital to &quot;goad&quot; the party into pursuing an independent electoral path.

&quot;These are ideologues who reduce politics to the market place of election day choice. Those who were nowhere to be seen during decades of struggle now preach to the SACP about having 'the courage to stand on its own',&quot; he said.

State power was not reducible to elections and electoral victories alone, Nzimande said. There was no simplistic parliamentary path to socialism.

The party has identified six areas it needs to build working class power. The se include the state, the economy, communities, the international front, ideolog y, and the workplace.

On the state, the central committee said the SACP had already made many advances which were recently borne out by the ANC's policy conference.

It said the ANC's acceptance of the need for a democratic developmental state, the adoption of an industrial policy, developing pro-poor legislation on land, and victories in the legislature on antipoverty measures were important for the SACP.

&quot; The last five years have witnessed the intensification of class struggles on many fronts, and we are proud we have led some of these struggles,&quot; Nzimande said.

&lt; http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=515000 &gt; 5.3 Now Blade slashes out at communist fat cats

Xolani Xundu, The Times, 13 July 2007
South African Communist Party secretary-general Blade Nzimande has hit out at former cadres who are now part of the elite.

Addressing more than 2000 delegates at the party's 12th national congress at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in Port Elizabeth yesterday, Nzimande said wealth accumulated under apartheid was being used to &quot;menace, cajole and bribe our new democracy&quot;.

He charged: &quot;This is where the principal strategic threat to our national democratic revolution comes from. It comes also from the absorption of some of our own so-called deployed cadres into the old elite.&quot;

He singled out the Public Investment Corp and the Independent Development Corp, which had controlling shares in Iscor and Sasol, for selling the &quot;family silver&quot; to private individuals such as Lakshmi Mittal .

&quot;Who were the deployed comrades in these entities that happily sold off this national strategic resource?

&quot;And is it true, that one such deployed comrade now has a holiday home on the French Riviera, thanks to this sale of our national heritage?&quot; said Nzimande in an apparent reference to SAA chief executive and former IDC boss Khaya Ngqula.

In response to President Thabo Mbeki's address at the ANC policy conference, in which Mbeki lashed the SACP for attempting to impose its socialist principles on the ANC, Nzimande said: &quot;So, for the record, let us state quite clearly that as in the past, so in the present the SACP has certainly not sought to impose anything undemocratic upon the ANC, nor delegate socialist tasks to it.

&quot;But of course, we are seeking to influence the ANC and its mass membership in a constructive, open and non-factionalist manner.

&quot;We are seeking, without apology, to underline the imperative of many socialist-orientated policies and programmes in order to advance, deepen and defend the very national democratic revolution itself in the present phase of the struggle.&quot;

Nzimande said capitalism was not a solution to the problems the ANC was faced with.

Speaking on behalf of the ANC, party secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe said the resolutions of the recent ANC policy conference were evidence that there was no &quot;fundamental divergence&quot; between the party and its alliance partners.

&quot;The SACP... remains a trusted ally of the ANC,&quot; he said.

Nzimande also confirmed the view that the left had won in the policy debate within the ANC.

The SACP is expected to return to office Nzimande and his deputy Jeremy Cronin. Those expected to face the chop are national chairman Charles Nqakula and central committee member Sydney Mufamadi, both members of Mbeki's Cabinet.

SABC, 12 July 2007
Kgalema Motlanthe, the ANC secretary general, has recognised the South African Communist Party (SACP) for its role in building the tri-partite alliance and advancing the cause of socialism.

Motlanthe was delivering the keynote address at the SACP congress in Port Elizabeth. He says the congress must reach a conclusion on whether socialism is still valid, and if so, what the policy implications are. Motlanthe has also apologised for the absence of president Thabo Mbeki who was unable to attend.

About 2000 delegates are attending the congress. Malesela Maleka, the spokesperson for the SACP, says the mood at the congress is very jubilant. Maleka says they are also joined by various other ANC leaders Jeff Radebe, the minister of transport, and Naledi Pandor, the minister of education.

&lt; http://www.sabcnews.co.za/politics/the_parties/0,2172,152472,00.html &gt; 5.5 Nzimande hits back at Mbeki

SABC, 13 July 2007
Blade Nzimande, the South African Communist Party (SACP) general secretary, has hit back at President Thabo Mbeki for accusing the party of trying to force the ANC to adopt a socialist programme.

He says the SACP has not sought to impose anything undemocratically on its alliance partner. Nzimande was delivering the political report of the party's 12th national congress.

After several delays, the congress started with an address by Kgalema Motlanthe, the ANC secretary-general. In a call for unity, he reminded delegates of the cooperation that has always existed between the two organisations.

However, Mbeki's remarks at the ANC policy conference were a particularly sore point. Nzimande responded by saying the party understands clearly what the role of the ANC is.

The SABC also came under fire. The public broadcaster's coverage, especially of Cuba, was a case in point. Nzimande accused an SABC correspondent of covering Cuba from Miami in the United States, portraying what he called a distorted image.

Privatisation of State assets
On the issue of State ownership, Nzimande questioned the privatisation of major State assets, including Sasol.

Nzimande also dismissed suggestions that there will be a purge of party leaders serving in government. Some provinces fear they may not be represented as they prepare to nominate leadership candidates.

Sello Moloto, the premier of Limpopo, Charles Nqakula, the safety and security minister, and Sydney Mufamadi, the provincial and local government minister, are among those who could lose their positions.

&lt; http://www.dispatch.co.za/2007/07/13/Easterncape/blade.html &gt; 5.6 SACP is no threat to ANC - Nzimande

Sabelo Ndlangisa, Daily Dispatch, 13 July 2007
SOUTH African Communist Party boss Blade Nzimande yesterday hit back at President Thabo Mbeki saying his party and its policies did not pose a threat to the ANC.

Nzimande was replying to Mbeki's opening address at the ANC's recent policy conference in Midrand, where Mbeki said the ANC had never set an agenda for the SACP or dictated which leaders it should choose.

The President had implied the SACP leadership was trying to delegate its task to build socialism to the ANC.

Addressing the SACP's 12th national congress in Port Elizabeth yesterday, Nzimande said his party was seeking &quot;without apology&quot; to push for socialist policies that promoted radical social and economic transformation.

&quot;So, for the record, let us state quite clearly that, as in the past, so in the present, the SACP has certainly not sought to &quot;impose&quot; anything undemocratically upon the ANC, nor &quot;delegate&quot; socialist tasks to it.

&quot;But of course we are seeking to influence the ANC and its mass membership in a non-factionalist manner,&quot; he said, adding that the free market system of capitalism was not the solution to the problems ANC members faced.

Nzimande, however, welcomed Mbeki's statement that the &quot;national democratic revolution&quot; (NDR) still needed the trade union, socialist and civic movements.

He said Mbeki's observation marked an &quot;important shift&quot; from his remarks at the 2002 ANC national conference, where the SACP was lumped with the &quot;ultra-left&quot; that opposed ANC policies.

&quot;The ANC's hundreds of thousands of members know very well that the threat to the NDR and to the ANC itself does not come from the SACP and its policies.

&quot;It comes from the powerful private conglomerates whose wealth and power were accumulated under white minority rule. It is the same wealth that is now used to menace, cajole, and bribe our new democracy. This is where the principal strategic threat to our NDR comes from,&quot; Nzimande said.

He questioned how ANC-deployed officials had sold the government stake in the former Iscor, which has been renamed Mittal Steel, when it was a &quot;national strategic resource&quot;.

The SACP's membership had more than doubled to 51800 members since its last national congress five years ago. It had pushed for major national campaigns such as the transformation of the financial sector, resulting in the introduction of the Mzansi account for the poor and a partial amnesty for people blacklisted by credit bureaus, he said.

Mbeki, expected to address the five-day congress, did not show up yesterday. Instead he was represented by ANC secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe.

Moshoeshoe Monare, The Star, 13 July 2007
Nzimande responds to Mbeki's attack on party

Delegates of the SA Communist Party have opened their congress, chanting and asking President Thabo Mbeki to tell them who killed former party general secretary Chris Hani.

They erupted into the song &quot;Thabo Mbeki siyabuza ubani owabulala uChris Hani Simthanda&quot;.

While Hani's wife Limpho and businessman Tokyo Sexwale were dancing to the chant, SACP chairperson Charles Nqakula, the Safety and Security Minister, tried unsuccessfully to quieten the hall yesterday.

The Young Communist League has repeatedly called for the reopening of Hani's murder investigation, with whispered accusations that senior ANC leaders may have been indirectly implicated.

ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma visited one of Hani's right-wing convicted murderers, Clive Derby-Lewis, who is serving a life sentence, and has urged the SACP to pay him a visit.

Mbeki declined an invitation to address the 12th national congress of the SACP in Port Elizabeth because he is on leave.

In his political report yesterday, SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande grabbed the opportunity to respond to Mbeki's attack on the party at the ANC's national policy conference two weeks ago.

Mbeki said then that the SACP must not &quot;delegate&quot; its socialist agenda to the ANC. Nzimande said while he agreed with this statement, &quot;of course we are seeking to influence the ANC and its mass membership&quot; in a &quot;constructive, open and non-factionalist manner&quot;.

&quot;We are seeking, without apology, to underline the imperative of many socialist-oriented programmes in order to advance, deepen and defend the very national democratic revolution itself in the present phase of the struggle,&quot; Nzimande said.

He said the ANC national policy conference, contrary to the ruling party leadership in government, had reaffirmed some of the policies the Left and the SACP had been calling for.

Nzimande repeated the accusations that there is a group in the ANC - labelled the 1996 class project - that has sought to undermine the movement's programmes and &quot;attempts were made to provoke the allies to walk out of the alliance&quot;.

He said the project had, among other things, led to corruption, succession battles, a weak ANC and a crisis of state-led service delivery.

Nzimande said that whereas the SACP would never leave the alliance, it wanted to restructure it and could not rule out the possibility of contesting elections on its own.

ANC secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe, who spoke on behalf of Mbeki, affirmed the SACP's importance as an ally and called for unity in the alliance.

&lt; http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=313816&amp;area;=/insight/i... &gt; 6.1 Threat to cut Zim salaries

Percy Zvomuya, Mail &amp; Guardian, 12 July 2007
There might be method in the madness going on in Harare -- reports suggest the government is considering slashing the salaries of public-sector workers by 50% in line with the price cuts that have rocked the retail industry.

Business, the government and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe are behind this latest move to control money supply, says the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). &quot;The ZCTU would like to make it known that it will fiercely resist this move as it is retrogressive and goes against the dictates of International Labour Organisation conventions,&quot; it says. However, there are legal hurdles to be faced as the Labour Act does not give the labour minister &quot;or any other government agency any power whatsoever to slash salaries of employees who are covered by the Act&quot;.

ZCTU notes that the measures would further impoverish workers who are already struggling to survive. Public servants earn about Z$3-million and the poverty datum line is Z$5-million.

&quot;A country cannot be run on the whim of ill-thought political projects that are of no benefit to the ordinary citizens,&quot; the labour federation says. &quot;We demand that the authorities rethink this heartless strategy as it will certainly throw the country into chaos and eventually anarchy.&quot; But Zimbabwe Industry and Trade Minister Obert Mpofu denies the report. &quot;We are only concerned about price stabilisation, not incomes,&quot; ZimOnline reports.

&lt; http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/2007/495/index.html?id=pp1547.htm &gt; 6.2 Union leaders call off biggest-ever strike

Weizmann Hamilton, The Socialist (UK), 12 July 2007
Democratic Socialist Movement (CWI, South Africa)
On 28 June, public sector unions called off South Africa's biggest-ever strike, involving nearly one million workers which began on 1 June. 17 unions took action, demanding a 12% pay increase.

The suspension of the longest public sector strike in South Africa's history followed the collapse of the unprecedented inter-union solidarity that had sustained the strike for nearly one month.

The 7.5% increase attained has already been undermined by the increase in inflation to 6.5%, interest rates to 13%, a further increase in the fuel price, and food inflation set to go even higher than the current 20%. Despite this, the public sector strike brought about a turning point in the relations between the classes and in the political situation in the country.

The surrender produced a split amongst the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) affiliates. While the National Education Health and Allied Workers (Nehawu), Cosatu's second biggest public sector affiliate (and four other smaller Cosatu affiliates including the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union) led the capitulators, its biggest affiliate, the SA Democratic Teachers' Union (Sadtu) led the resistance.

Standing firm with Sadtu, on the reduced demand for a 10% pay increase, was the National Professional Teachers Association (Naptosa) and the Public Servants Association, both independent unions.

The unions' decision to suspend the strike was preceded by the government effectively ending the negotiations, by tabling a signed final offer at the Public Service Co-ordinating Bargaining Council in the week before.

The government had threatened the withdrawal of the revised offer of 7.5% as suggested by the mediators, reverting to the previous offer of 7.25%. Such was the fury of &quot;having a gun held to our heads&quot;, workers organised buses to travel to Centurion near the capital Tshwane (formerly Pretoria) to picket. The Bargaining Council meeting ended in chaos when workers entered the building one evening and discharged fire extinguishers.

By the following day, the government denied vigorously that it had issued an ultimatum only to follow this by, in effect, issuing a new ultimatum in the form of its final offer.

According to the Bargaining Council constitution, if either party puts forward a signed proposal, it remains on the table for 21 working days, after which it falls off if a majority has not signed.

Initially, there was not a majority for the 7.5% on the union side. For the proposal to become a council resolution, 50%+1 of the unions must sign acceptance. However, the balance was swung in favour of the proposal after the SA Police Union signed.

Significance

The importance of this strike lies not only in its size and length. It is politically the most significant strike since the African National Congress (ANC) came to power in 1994. Its repercussions will reverberate throughout the Tripartite Alliance (ANC, Cosatu and South African Communist Party) further weakening its foundations.

There will be consequences for the leadership of those unions that capitulated and, in effect, forced on the membership an offer that, to say the least, they are not enthusiastic about.
It has been said of the British labour movement that the working class are lions led by donkeys in the TUC (union congress). After the recent union leaders' cowardly capitulation in South Africa, it would be no exaggeration to say the same of the Nehawu and Cosatu leadership.

Strike tactics

Days before the suspension of the strike, the Cosatu General Secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi, in an address to a Young Communist League rally in Mpumalanga, claimed the 7.5% pay increase offer from the government represented a gain for public sector workers. Yet, only the day before, the Cosatu president assured demonstrators at a picket of the Bargaining Council that the unions would not accept the government's 7.5% offer.

It has been the Democratic Socialist Movement's (DSM - CWI in South Africa) position, from the onset of the industrial action, that the tactic of calling a so-called &quot;indefinite strike&quot; was incorrect. The Nehawu union leadership, in particular, with their eyes on the coming ANC congress, gave the impression they were determined not to repeat the 'mistakes' of past strikes. In reality, they were trying to compensate for the union leadership's opportunist capitulation of 2004, with an attempt to appear more radical, three years later.

It would have been more effective to have called a 'rolling campaign' of mass action, under the protection of an 'indefinite strike notice'.

As we explained in our third and final DSM special strike leaflet, an indefinite strike notice would have provided indefinite legal protection for carefully planned (once or twice weekly) mass actions by the public sector unions.

This action would have built up workers' confidence and organisation and been used as a build-up towards a general strike, drawing in the unions in the private sector, whose wage negotiations are now also starting.

In the end, however, the union leaders chose to defuse the mass working class militancy. It can legitimately be asked whether the calling of an indefinite strike was deliberately calculated to exhaust the membership and to prepare for the union leaders' capitulation.

In the view of some Nehawu shop stewards, their leadership adopted this militant posture to assure their re-election at the Nehawu congress, which took place within days of the suspension of the strike.

The government had also made a number of blunders during the strike. The Minister of Finance announced there was enough money to fund a 9% increase, drawing a stinging rebuke from the Minister of Public Service and Administration, whose husband is the Finance Minister's deputy.

There was further embarrassment over the proposals of the government's remuneration committee to recommend increasing the salaries of government ministers' and the president by between 30% and 57%.

Capitalist party

The facts of the recent strike speak volumes about the character of the ANC. The ANC is a party committed to capitalism and which represents the interests of the aspirant black capitalist class and big business. This was confirmed by the outcome on the debates at its recent policy conference. Although the majority of ANC members supported the public sector workers' demands they were not even debated at the conference!

The DSM was the only left organisation that consistently communicated with workers during the strike by way of three editions of our special strike leaflets, which were warmly accepted by strikers.

Our call for Cosatu workers to take the trade union federation out of the Tripartite Alliance is finding an increasing echo. Many workers remarked that the independent unions, by and large, showed greater consistency, determination and clarity concerning the strike demands and on the prosecution of the strike.

The DSM calls for the lessons of the strike to be urgently digested by the workers' movement in preparation for the coming class battles. This includes struggling for unions democratically controlled by the rank and file, which will successfully resist the neo-liberal attacks of the ANC government.

Terry Bell Business Report 13 July 2007
The national parks are among South Africa's prime tourist attractions and some of the biggest money spinners. Principal among them is the Kruger National Park, although all, from the periurban Table Mountain National Park to the arid expanse of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, attract large numbers of visitors.

Few notice the small army of workers who protect, maintain and service these parks and their facilities. Fewer still, probably, question where these workers live or under what conditions.

This is a largely invisible army that, in the case of the Kruger, last year provided services and facilities for 1.245 million visitors, 944 640 of whom were South Africans. Some of these visitors picnicked, some camped, others relaxed in luxury lodges and a few indulged in that New Age fad of vision quests. All relied on cleaners, cooks, waiters, rangers and guides.

However, the conditions under which most of the poorly paid guides and rangers live in our touted national parks is correctly described by many of them as &quot;a scandal&quot;. For years anger has been growing and increasing numbers have looked to unions for help.

To the chagrin of trade unionists, however, many of the functions in the parks - from gate security to restaurants and staff stores - have been outsourced in the recent past. But a core group of workers, particularly rangers and guides, remain employees of SA National Parks (SANParks). Some complain not only about management, but also about what they see as union indifference.

The only union recognised by SANParks is the Cosatu-aligned SA Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers' Union (Saccawu), which recently concluded a 6 percent pay rise deal for park workers. This was considered by many members of the rival Health and Other Service Personnel Trade Union of SA (Hospersa) to be a &quot;sellout&quot;.

They accuse Saccawu of enjoying a &quot;too cosy&quot; relationship with SANParks management. Last week matters came to a head and more than 700 workers at Kruger went on strike. They were joined by about 150 others at the Table Mountain and Kgalagadi parks.

Says Hospersa assistant general secretary Manfred Rothballer: &quot;This strike has nothing to do with pay. That is a done deal and we have to live with it.&quot;

Instead, it is about a range of other issues, prime among them being housing. This applies in all 20 national parks.

&quot;Families are still living in one-room accommodation [at Kruger], without kitchen facilities or running water,&quot; says Rothballer. The only concession to modernity is an electric light and one electric point.

One striking Kruger guide, who gave his name only as Joseph, also complained about the prices workers had to pay at the staff store. The example given was R6.50 for a standard loaf of white bread, which is at least R2 more than the average price in urban supermarkets.

Pay scales for the workers involved in the strike start at R2 150 a month at entry level and rise to R3 000. Workers are also given a monthly ration of a bag of mielie meal and some spices.

One guide, with 19 years experience, noted that he earned R2 425 a month, out of which R200 went to &quot;medical&quot;. There was no clinic within several hundred kilometres of the camp where he was based, and his family was forced to pay &quot;tourist prices&quot; for their basic necessities because there was little opportunity to travel outside the park.

It was for these reasons that he joined the 720 strikers who marched on the SANParks office at the Paul Kruger gate on Wednesday to deliver a memorandum of grievances and demands. The union announced at the same time that the strike would be suspended today for 14 days to allow management time to respond.

Says Rothballer: &quot;Depending on their response, we either continue working or the strike starts again.&quot;

Park authorities maintain that they have been unaffected by the strike because they have, in terms of the Labour Relations Act, employed &quot;replacement labour&quot;.

However, Rothballer says: &quot;Management has been able to replace administrative staff and some others, but they cannot simply replace rangers, so it is likely that the police reports about increased poaching activity are correct.&quot;

Although it may be officially denied, poaching probably did increase over the week that the rangers were on strike, but it would be impossible to assess by exactly how much.

The argument the workers make is that they protect this precious natural environment, on which a lucrative tourist trade flourishes, and yet have to &quot;live like animals&quot;.

In the Kgalagadi, where employee accommodation comprises asbestos huts, it is perhaps understandable that workers complain that, in terms of their living conditions, they have been &quot;left behind in apartheid&quot;.

Editorial, Mail &amp; Guardian 13 July 2007
It has been the Mail &amp; Guardian's view always that the South African Communist Party has more historical credibility than any other opposition party. Its positive influence on the country's history is undeniable and its policy positions and leaders must be taken seriously. It is the future of the SACP we worry about.

Undeniably, the party is passing through a phase of Stalinist intolerance. While its leaders denounce those who suggest it has purged senior communists who have dared raise their voices, the evidence is clear.

Treasurer Phillip Dexter was axed for writing a scathing critique of general secretary Blade Nzimande; Vishwas Satgar, the former provincial secretary of Gauteng, resigned after being savaged for raising his voice about the party's direction.

Former spokesperson Mazibuko Jara was similarly marginalised for writing a paper that questioned the party's one-track support for Jacob Zuma. The Gauteng Young Communist League has been disbanded.

And let's not forget that SACP publisher Dale McKinley also lost his job for daring to question the leadership publicly.

The party has a rationale for each purge. But, taken together, there is clearly a problem with tolerance and openness -- and communists must address it at their conference this weekend.

At the centre of the dispute is the future of Jacob Zuma. A double irony is that while the debate about the ANC deputy president is seen to have opened space in the ruling ANC, it has closed down debate in the SACP.

Like his foe, President Thabo Mbeki, who has presided over the breakdown in discipline of a 95-year-old movement, Nzimande has allowed Zuma -- not an SACP veteran by any means -- to divide his ranks.

What the party should really be focusing on is forging an independent political future for itself; Young Turks in the party believe the time is ripe to go it alone. It might not win state power immediately, but it could capitalise on grass roots discontent with South Africa's growing wealth gap.

Yet the party's leadership seems intent on clinging like a koala bear to its ANC ally. This week deputy general secretary Jeremy Cronin said the SACP should continue to field candidates as part of the ruling party's lists, but wanted communist speaking time in legislatures.

The SACP uses the entitlements of office to keep its provincial offices afloat; it has said publicly that it encourages provincial chairpersons and office-bearers to seek public office so that the cash-strapped party does not have to pay salaries.

These are displays of political and organisational weakness that the party is failing to tackle as it descends into internal conflict. It's time for the fighting to stop and for the party to start contesting power in its own right.

Aubrey Matshiqi Business Day 13 July 2007
TODAY is the second day of the South African Communist Party (SACP) congress at which, among other things, the bumpy &quot;South African road to socialism&quot; will be debated.

African National Congress (ANC) president Thabo Mbeki will not be delivering the traditional keynote address on behalf of the ruling party. Some of us were hoping he would interrupt his well-earned holiday to expand on some of the critical questions he raised at the ANC policy conference with regard to the historical mission of the two parties in the prosecution of what the alliance partners call the national democratic revolution (NDR). Because Mbeki is clearly not a man who likes repeating himself, we shall have to rely on the SACP interpretation of the NDR, which will result from what will, undoubtedly, be robust debate at the congress.

When Mbeki opened the ANC policy conference two weeks ago, he compared the alliance between the ANC, the SACP and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) to Beethoven's 9th Symphony, about which the composer said: &quot;Mankind may perish, but the 9th will live forever&quot;. In the same way, Mbeki said: &quot;All of us may indeed perish, but the alliance will live forever.&quot; The SACP congress , however, takes place at a time when the relationship between the ANC and its communist partners sounds less melodic than Beethoven's 9th, and more atonal than the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen.

The question of the life span of the alliance should not be controversial because no alliance exists to outlive its raison d'être. The tripartite alliance will exist until it has achieved its strategic goals or will split prior to the achievement of such goals when the contradictions between the partners have become untenable.

One of the contradictions that drive tensions between the ANC and the SACP results from conceptual differences over the meaning of the NDR. In what seemed to be a response to accusations from the SACP that under Mbeki's leadership the post-apartheid state has adopted a policy orientation that has marginalised the working class and its interests, the ANC president argued that &quot;historically ... the SACP has defined itself as an integral part of the national liberation movement ... and therefore accepted that, objectively, the ANC must serve as the leader of the NDR&quot;.

The question is: what is the role of the SACP in the ANC-led NDR? According to Mbeki, it is not the imposition of the socialist revolution on the ANC and the NDR. Since Mbeki sees the NDR as a &quot;protracted&quot; phase of the struggle to create a &quot;national democratic society&quot;, what will the SACP be doing in the meantime, given the fact that it has the right to pursue a socialist agenda despite being part of the alliance? One option is a mechanical two-stage reading of the relationship between the NDR and the transition to socialism, which implies a suspension of SACP structures and activities until the goals of the NDR are achieved. Another is to argue for the continuation of the alliance on the basis of a common set of goals that will define its work and the relationship between its components. If the SACP congress comes to the conclusion that the ideological differences between the Communist Party and the ANC have become irreconcilable and that a programme based on a common set of goals is, therefore, no longer possible, they must delink from the alliance.

Alternatively, and to the extent that the SACP in its draft political programme has called for &quot;working class hegemony&quot;, they must ask themselves whether this hegemonic project should be extended to the structures of the ANC. In other words, is the ANC one of the sites of the socialist revolution? Put differently, should socialist policy measures be instituted through the ANC during the current phase of the NDR?

If, in contradiction to the ANC's strategic orientation, the SACP still insists that the postapartheid state - to borrow the words of social policy expert Tony Fitzpatrick - is not &quot;capable of being transformed into a properly pluralistic and democratic institution&quot; in the absence of working class hegemony, the state's bias towards working class interests must result from a combination of mass struggles and electoral contests.

In addition, there is no contradiction between the idea of contesting elections independently and staying within the alliance, although this would require a reconfiguration of the relationship between the ANC, SACP and Cosatu.

It is highly unlikely, however, that the SACP will take the risk of not depending on the ANC for its representation in the executive and our national and provincial legislatures despite support for the idea of electoral independence from the younger generation of SACP members.
Could it be that the older communists are afraid that the separation between class and political interests will expose a working class consciousness that does not extend adequately beyond living-wage consciousness?
