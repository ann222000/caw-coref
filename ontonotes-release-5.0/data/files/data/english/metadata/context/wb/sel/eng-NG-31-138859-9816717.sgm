*LEG PAINS*

*Pain in legs*, coming on after walking a moderate distance often arises
from narrowing of the blood vessels leading to these areas. If the vessel
becomes completely blocked, gangrene may result and the toes become dark and
cold. This is most frequently seen in cases of uncontrolled diabetes.

People with varicose veins suffer from swelling of the veins, followed by
muscle cramps and a tired feeling in the legs behind the knees. In some
cases the skin over the lower part of the leg may break down, forming a
large, ugly ulcer, which is often painful.

Leg cramps can occur due to running, walking, riding a bike, standing up,
even sleeping. While every lower-leg injury has its specific biomechanical
causes, all are rooted in tight calf muscles and relative weakness in the
front leg muscles. This is very, very common in runners, since running tends
to exercise the calf muscles more than those in the front.

Anterior shin splints is defined as the pain in the front and outer edge of
your legs. The main cause of shin splints is tight calf muscles and weak
shin muscles, the injury may have been further aggravated by a variety of
factors. Shin splints are very common among beginning runners.

Posterior shin splint may be defined as the pain on the inner side of your
leg, right where the calf muscle meets the big shinbone. The cause of this
may be straining of a muscle that gives some support to the arch of your
foot.

Achilles Tendinitis may be defined as the pain in the lower calf along the
Achilles tendon, the cord connecting the heel to the calf muscle. The main
cause of this may be extra pulling of the tendon, which causes a lot of *pain
in legs*.

*HOME REMEDIES FOR LEG PAINS

*

- Grab your upper lip between your thumb and index finger, and squeeze
for about 30 seconds to get relief.
- Grab the cramping muscle tightly, pushing your fingertips deep into
the cramp for about 10 to 15 seconds, then release. You can repeat as often
as necessary to relieve the cramp.
- After the cramp is gone, stretch out the muscle but begin slowly and
without bouncing on it. To begin, sit down on the floor and extend the leg.
Then reach out and gently pull your toes toward your knee.
- Drinking a cup of water (about eight ounces) every 20 minutes
before, during and after exercise will help keep your system from
dehydrating. Dehydration helps to prevent cramping.
- Boil 1-teaspoon saffron in 1/2 cup water. Let it reduce to become 1
tablespoon. Divide this solution into three portions and take with equal
quantities of water, thrice daily for a couple of days. This is very
effective *home remedy for leg pains* and will help to reduce the
pain.
- A diet high in natural fibres from fruits and vegetables, pulses,
whole grains, calcium, magnesium and vitamin E rich foods also help in
fighting against the joint pains.
- Drink 1 cup of warm water mixed with limejuice and honey to reduce
pain.
- Avoid mental tensions that lead to stress. Lose weight, if
necessary, to get close to your ideal weight. If you weigh less, there is
less weight on your joints and less pain.
- Take foods rich in calcium and protein. Exposure to sunlight for
vitamin D is also good. Milk and milk products, ragi, drumstick leaves and
drumstick are excellent sources of calcium and sprouted pulses and nuts are
very good sources of protein for a vegetarian. Include these foods in the
daily diet.
- During the painful stages it is important for the patient to have
one or two rest periods during the day.
- Add one-tablespoon cod liver oil to the juice of one orange, whip
and drink before sleeping.
- One raw clove of garlic every day is very beneficial. This clove can
be fried in ghee (clarified butter) or castor oil. Take for 2 months.
- Drink 15 grams of fresh bathu juice daily with an empty stomach
without adding any salt or sugar to it. This is very effective *home
remedy for leg pains*.
- Massage the affected area with any oil will to provide relief from
the pain.
- Drink a cup of papaya seed tea six or seven times daily for two or
three weeks for relief from joint pain.
- Heavy meals, meat and fish, sour fruits and fried foods should be
avoided, as they are difficult to digest.
- Consumption of rice during nighttime should be avoided. Among fruits
bananas are considered best as they provide strength to the joints and
grease them.
- To get relief from a severe leg cramp in the calf muscle, flex your
shin muscle (which opposes your calf muscle) by pulling your toes toward
your knee.
- To ease the *leg pains* and reduce inflammation, ice your shins
immediately after running. Use either a store-bought cold pack or simply
freeze a wet towel before going out on a run. Whatever you use, wrap the ice
pack around your leg and keep it on for 10 or 15 minutes, keeping your foot
elevated all the while.
