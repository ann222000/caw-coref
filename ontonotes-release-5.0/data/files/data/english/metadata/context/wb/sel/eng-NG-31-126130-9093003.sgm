Funny, with all the steroid and HGH news over the last month or so, the
Barry Haters here have been suspiciously silent. I'd love to hear your
thoughts!

And the poster who said he could tell a 'roid or HGH user just by looking at
them, never mentioned Paul Byrd; Troy Glaus; Gary Matthews Jr.; Jose
Guillen; Matt Williams; ....

Below, an article by someone who can admit he was wrong, from yesterday's
S.F. Chronicle:

It's 'Roid Rage --- A Vote For Bonds

Scott Ostler

Sunday, November 11, 2007

Barry Bonds gets my vote.

If I have a Hall of Fame ballot when Bonds becomes eligible, assuming he
ever retires, I vote for Bonds, first time through.

I'll probably even attend his induction ceremony, which Bonds says he'll
boycott. Staring at an empty podium will be more entertaining than listening
to Barry's stream-of-semi- consciousness prattle.

A few years ago I was the first sportswriter in the country (if I don't toot
my own horn, who will?) to raise the possibility that Bonds and other
baseball greats might be kept out of the Hall of Fame because of links to
steroids.

I wrote that I would not vote for Bonds.

It takes a big man to admit when he's wrong, and I'm about seven pounds
heavier than I was back then.

There's just way too much evidence of widespread use of weapons of mass
construction. Therefore, two options:

1. Ignore the steroids questions and doubts when it's time to vote.

2. Turn Cooperstown into a flea market. Dude, this Honus Wagner plaque is
marked one buck, but his cap is kinda crooked, will you take fifty cents?

The latest 'roid villain is Matt Williams, whose dentist advised him to
floss every day and to shoot three or four different kinds of chemicals into
his butt.

If I ever get busted for steroids, remind me not to have Derrick Hall offer
my public defense. Hall, the Diamondbacks' president, defended Williams, an
announcer for the team, by saying, &quot;Matt is a stand-up guy, who without
hesitation, admitted using (growth hormone) and not liking it.&quot;

Point by point:

-- You have to stand up in order to shoot yourself in the arse.

-- Why would Williams hesitate? He and every other athlete who ordered drugs
through anti-aging clinics have known for months that they might be exposed.
Plenty of time to prepare some kind of mea culpa.

-- &quot;Not liking it&quot;? That's a defense? Sure, my client robbed the bank, Your
Honor, but he didn't enjoy it. No word from Hall on whether or not Williams
enjoyed the steroids he also reportedly ordered.

I don't know if I qualify as a &quot;Barry Hater.&quot;  I don't hate the guy
(which would seem to be what the phrase implies), but I have noted
that he's an illegal drug cheat (which I suspect may suffice).

But I have no problem with the column you posted.  Supporting Bonds on
the theory that &quot;he cheated by using performance enhancing drugs, but
lots of other guys of his generation did as well&quot; has always struck me
as a legitimate POV with no lgical inconsistency or Bay Area homerism
involved.  He's likely only one of hundreds of guys to cheat in much
the same way.

In any event, I think that argument is about 8000 times more
persuasive than the apologist &quot;maybe Barry never was a user -- he
might've just doubled his size and dramatically increased his power in
late career naturally!&quot; variant.

Wow,
I'm shocked, a guy who writes for a SF paper would vote for Bonds for the
Hall Of Fame..

Seriously though,
Bonds is/was a user. It is obvious not only by his appearance, but his
sudden increase in numbers and his just as sudden decline.  Obviously he is
not the only one, but the others didn't end up breaking 2 of baseball's most
cherished records. That is why he is rightfully targeted and chastised.
Where is the deterring factor for other players in keeping Paul Byrd out of
the Hall of Fame ?

This attack on steroids, HGH and any other substances needs someone to take
the fall to set a precedence, just like they did with Pete Rose. Fortunately
for baseball purists, that person is Barry Bonds.

I don't get it.
Suspiciously silent?
Why--because Barry's been basically out of the news since he broke
Aaron's record?
This guy's changed his mind and will vote him in, most will, some
won't.
I don't really get how the Williams issue, and his defenders, relate
to why this guy'll change his vote, though.
I'm guessing he's saying it's because steroids are/were so prevalent
that it would be crazy not to.
But the article's kind of scattered--did you cut off the end?

********************

Why do purists look foolish?
They'd vote down anyone that used.
Hopefully, for their sake, they'll have knowledge of an individual's
use within five years of their retirement/by their eligibility date.
If not, they can not vote for a person as long as they have doubts.
The only vote that really counts is the last one.
Not very many players ever got in on 100% of the vote--maybe 2 or 3.
I think one would be less foolish to vote someone in on this reason
than because a player didn't do interviews, for example.

Yeah, he did curls ...

How about the others, did Byrd's head grow, for example?

Or could it be that Barry got bigger because of lifting weights, and when
somebody gets bigger, their head tends to get bigger too? How many football
players and wrestlers and weightlifters in general have little pinheads?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Wow,
&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm shocked, a guy who writes for a SF paper would vote for Bonds for
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; Hall Of Fame..

&gt;&gt; I'm not shocked that you forgot to mention that that particular writer
&gt;&gt; said
&gt;&gt; he was the first writer in the country to suggest roid users might not
&gt;&gt; make
&gt;&gt; the HOF, and hthat he originally said he wouldn't vote for him.
&gt;&gt; Or that most of this whole scandal was first reported by S.F. Chronicle
&gt;&gt; writers.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Seriously though,
&gt;&gt; &gt; Bonds is/was a user. It is obvious not only by his appearance, but his
&gt;&gt; &gt; sudden increase in numbers and his just as sudden decline.

&gt;&gt; What about Byrd's appearance? And the others? How can it be obvious in
&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt; guy, and not the others?

&gt;&gt; His decrease in numbers could have had something to do with the fact that
&gt;&gt; he
&gt;&gt; was 40, and had no cartiledge in one knee....

&gt;&gt;   Obviously he is

&gt;&gt; &gt; not the only one, but the others didn't end up breaking 2 of baseball's
&gt;&gt; &gt; most cherished records. That is why he is rightfully targeted and
&gt;&gt; &gt; chastised.

&gt;&gt; Why isn't Byrd chastised for helping his team win a division and doing
&gt;&gt; good
&gt;&gt; in the playoffs?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Where is the deterring factor for other players in keeping Paul Byrd
&gt;&gt; &gt; out
&gt;&gt; &gt; of the Hall of Fame ?

&gt;&gt; Huh?

&gt;&gt; &gt; This attack on steroids, HGH and any other substances needs someone to
&gt;&gt; &gt; take the fall to set a precedence, just like they did with Pete Rose.

&gt;&gt; At least you admit that Barry was the fall guy! We're making progress
&gt;&gt; here.

&gt;&gt; Fortunately

&gt;&gt; &gt; for baseball purists, that person is Barry Bonds.

&gt;&gt; Those so-called &quot;purists&quot; as you put it, are looking pretty foolish right
&gt;&gt; about now ...

&gt; ********************

&gt; Why do purists look foolish?
">

First, I put &quot;purists&quot; in quotes to indicate it's ridiculous to indicate it
was purists who singled out Bonds. If they were truly purists, they'd be
making similar remarks about these other guys now.

Second, these people look foolish because they singled out Bonds, and a few
others who had great stats.

&gt; The only vote that really counts is the last one.
&gt; Not very many players ever got in on 100% of the vote--maybe 2 or 3.
&gt; I think one would be less foolish to vote someone in on this reason

I think part of the problem might be that citing some some particular

figuring out whether someone used steroids or HGH needn't suggest
(logically) that one &quot;can tell a 'roid or HGH user just by looking at

To use another context: I would argue that a someone's height is &quot;a
factor&quot; in evaluating whether he can be a great basketball player.
That I certainly don't believe that I can &quot;tell a great basketball
player just by looking at him&quot; doesn't negate or undercut that
argument.

Now if the people you're arguing with actually said that appearance is
the only factor they would need to see in order to determine who has
used steroids and who has not, then I think you're making a good point
and showing them to be inconsistent.

Correct, and the 'roids not only helped him hit the ball further, but more

Appearance means how somebody looks. Now tell me why you should be able to

Then you should clearly understand my argument. If somebody gets bigger over
the course of time, they could be on steroids, but that doesn't necessarily
mean they are. Especially since we now know that appearance doesn't
necessarily have anything to do with being a steroids user.

Why is appearance a factor in some, and not in others? You've avoided that

Burt, what's the end game here?  What (if any) larger point are you
trying to make by means of these questions?

If you firmly believed that Bonds had never done steroids or HGH, then
I could understand where you're going.  But if (as I think I read you)
you agree he did use the stuff and are simply making the (perfectly
valid) point that lots of others did as well -- then what difference
does it make that some of the users (Bonds, McGwire, Sosa, etc.) got
much bigger and displayed obvious changes in physical appearance while
they were on the stuff and other users (Byrd, for example) did not?

To get things off Bonds if he is the real issue for you, just take
McGwire and Sosa instead.  They obviously got much larger and more
musclebound while using and likely hit a lot more homers than they
would've if clean.  How does the fact that Paul Byrd didn't display
the same symptoms have any bearing on Big Mac or Sammy?  Does it
suggest to you in some way that McGwire and Sosa didn't use the
stuff?  I don't understand where you're coming from in this debate.

It suggests to me that you can't tell whether or not somebody has used, by
their appearance. And Barry's appearance has been what many people have used
to determine that he's a user.

I am so confused....

So, appearance is - or is not - a factor when we the experts proclaim who
used and who didn't - and to what extent?

Not pitchers of course!
Pitchers wouldn't even WANT to!
They do not desire greater strength and endurance!
Not even from UNDETECTABLE steroids!

Anyways... if we're going by appearances somebody oughtta warn Big Papy.  As
based on appearances, well...  Here's his picture as a Minnesota Twin.

This page has an older autographed card of Matt when he was a Giant.
(Scroll down about 1/4 of the way and you'll see it).  It ain't easy to
tell, because the picture is autographed, but if you watched Matt all those
years in SF &amp; AZ, you can definitely see that he became a lot &quot;bulkier&quot; as
the years progressed.

The bottom line is there are hundreds upon hundreds of players who used
everything they could get their hands on.  They felt they had too, to keep
their jobs.  For baseball it usually starts in college (but sometimes - like
football - as early as high school).

So far... Bonds is the best of his era, the steroid era, which ain't even
close to over (and has prolly just begun).

If you replace &quot;by their appearance&quot; with &quot;by their appearance alone&quot;,
I would agree 100% with your statement.  Nobody (at lkeast no non-
expert)can tell just by looking at an MLB player whether or which
drugs he has used.

But you seem (maybe I'm wrong) to be carrying things further -- and
suggesting that appearance (head size or added bulkiness or
significant gain or muscle mass, etc.) isn't even relevant to the
analysis; i.e. it isn't even &quot;a factor.&quot;  That strikes me as silly.

Perhaps we can all agree on the following:  There are a number of
factors that suggest (but -- by themselves -- do not definitively
prove) steroid or HGH usage among MLB players.  Chief among these
factors are increased production and power late in career; increased
head size and muscle mass, and greater than normal change in body
shape over time.

Personally, I am convinced that Bonds and Sosa and McGwire (to pick
the three big power guys) all used one or more performance enhancing
drugs to achieve their results.  Most here (I suspect) either agree
with all three or agree with two and carve out whichever guy happens
to play for their team.

The &quot;Williams issue&quot; is pretty easy for anyone who lived in the Bay
Area.  I lived there for a time, and was a season ticket holder for a
couple years when he was the third baseman.  He was the absolute model
of baseball played &quot;right.&quot;  And, as some folks may recall, he was
also on a pace to break Maris's record when the strike hit in '94.  No
one ever suspected a thing when he was playing, at least, nothing ever
surfaced in the press.

How many other sainted former players -- some already in the hall --
will eventually surface?  How many among those who were held up as
contrasts to the evil Barry?  At some point, the choice is either to
vote for no one, or to vote based on credentials (subtracting only for
those who were caught, if then).

For all his supposed decline, Bonds still led the league in OBP, and
would have led the league in OPS had he not been injured in

This isn't even up for debate. There are physical signs of steroid

doesn't change the fact that there are physical signs of steroid abuse.

First of all, your premise is flawed. I suspect that you can tell a
difference in many of the players named...but who the hell cared about
Gary Matthews Jr. enough to do a before and after comparison. That's the
same point I've made all along.

Other than that, I did answer your question. If you don't understand the
answer, or pretend not to for convenience, that's not my problem.

&gt; &gt; It suggests to me that you can't tell whether or not somebody has used, by

&gt; If you replace &quot;by their appearance&quot; with &quot;by their appearance alone&quot;,
&gt; I would agree 100% with your statement.  Nobody (at lkeast no non-
&gt; expert)can tell just by looking at an MLB player whether or which
&gt; drugs he has used.

&gt; But you seem (maybe I'm wrong) to be carrying things further -- and
&gt; suggesting that appearance (head size or added bulkiness or
&gt; significant gain or muscle mass, etc.) isn't even relevant to the
&gt; analysis; i.e. it isn't even &quot;a factor.&quot;  That strikes me as silly.

&gt; Perhaps we can all agree on the following:  There are a number of
&gt; factors that suggest (but -- by themselves -- do not definitively
&gt; prove) steroid or HGH usage among MLB players.  Chief among these
&gt; factors are increased production and power late in career; increased
&gt; head size and muscle mass, and greater than normal change in body
&gt; shape over time.

&gt; Personally, I am convinced that Bonds and Sosa and McGwire (to pick
&gt; the three big power guys) all used one or more performance enhancing
&gt; drugs to achieve their results.  Most here (I suspect) either agree
&gt; with all three or agree with two and carve out whichever guy happens
&gt; to play for their team.

&gt; The &quot;Williams issue&quot; is pretty easy for anyone who lived in the Bay

&gt; also on a pace to break Maris's record when the strike hit in '94.  No
&gt; one ever suspected a thing when he was playing, at least, nothing ever
&gt; surfaced in the press.

&gt; How many other sainted former players -- some already in the hall --
&gt; will eventually surface?  How many among those who were held up as
&gt; contrasts to the evil Barry?  At some point, the choice is either to
&gt; vote for no one, or to vote based on credentials (subtracting only for
&gt; those who were caught, if then).

For the probably tremendous amount of players involved in this
controversy, many of them played for a time in the Bay Area.
I don't think that's a coincidence.
I knew a couple guys from college, each of whom played for one of
those teams for a time.
Although I doubt either was involved, one can never be sure.
I'd love to know what they know, but I'm sure they're not talking--nor
is anyone else.
Except Jose, of course.
He's like the tree they can be traced back to.

Out here in Hicksville, they do as well. But here's the article for you:

Baseball's Jose Guillen, Matt Williams bought steroids from clinic
Mark Fainaru-Wada,Lance Williams, Chronicle Staff Writers

Tuesday, November 6, 2007

Veteran major-league outfielder Jose Guillen, who played part of the 2003
season for the division-champion A's, bought thousands of dollars of
steroids and human growth hormone from a troubled Florida anti-aging clinic
and had some of the drugs shipped to the Oakland Coliseum, business records
show.

Two other major-league players who have since retired also bought
performance-enhancing drugs from the Palm Beach Rejuvenation Center, which
was targeted this year in a law-enforcement investigation of suspected
illegal drug sales.

Matt Williams, the Giants' star third baseman for 10 years, bought $11,600
worth of growth hormone, steroids and other drugs in 2002, when he was
playing for the Arizona Diamondbacks, according to the records. In a phone
interview Monday, Williams said a doctor advised him to try growth hormone
to heal a serious ankle injury he suffered during spring training in 2002.

Journeyman pitcher Ismael Valdez bought $11,300 worth of
performance-enhancing drugs in 2002 after he was traded from the Texas
Rangers to the Seattle Mariners, the records show.

Guillen, an 11-year veteran who played for the Seattle Mariners last season,
ordered more than $19,000 worth of drugs from the center between May 2002
and June 2005, according to the records.

Some prescriptions for the three players were written not by a doctor but by
a Florida dentist whose license later was suspended for fraud and
incompetence, records show. The same dentist prescribed growth hormone to
Paul Byrd, the Cleveland Indians pitcher previously identified by The
Chronicle as buying nearly $25,000 worth of growth hormone through the same
anti-aging clinic. Byrd acknowledged using the substance but said it was
prescribed by a doctor to treat adult hormone deficiency, a rare condition
that affects about 1 in 8,500 adults in the United States.

The players' orders were detailed in records provided to The Chronicle by a
confidential source, who said their purchases were consistent with an
athlete's personal use of the drugs. The records included purchase and
shipping orders, payment data, and buyers' birthdates and Social Security
numbers.

Guillen didn't respond to requests for comment left with his agent and
business manager. Valdez's former agent didn't return phone calls or an
e-mail message.

Guillen, 31, has played for eight teams during 11 seasons in the majors,
batting .267 with 166 home runs. In 2007, he hit .290 with 23 home runs and
99 runs batted in for Seattle.

In February, he was quoted by ESPN The Magazine as saying he had been
approached about using steroids earlier in his career but had declined.

&quot;That is something I never considered in my life,&quot; Guillen is quoted as
saying. &quot;You're ruining your whole career. You're ruining your reputation.
This really is hurting baseball right now, the image of the game.&quot;

However, records from the Palm Beach Rejuvenation Center indicate Guillen
ordered three different types of human growth hormone, two forms of
testosterone and the steroids stanozolol and nandrolone during a three-year
span.

The Palm Beach Rejuvenation Center, along with other anti-aging clinics and
online pharmacies in Florida and Alabama, was targeted by the Albany, N.Y.,
district attorney for illegal sales of drugs, including steroids and growth
hormone. It was raided by state law enforcement agencies Feb. 27.
Authorities have accused doctors associated with the clinics and pharmacies
of writing fraudulent prescriptions to make sales seem legitimate. Thus far,
10 people have pleaded guilty to felony drug and fraud charges, and a dozen
other suspects are awaiting trial. No sports stars have been indicted, but
athletes from professional baseball, football and wrestling have been
identified as customers, according to news reports.

Possession of steroids without a valid prescription has been illegal since
1991. It is illegal for doctors to prescribe growth hormone for uses not
specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Performance
enhancement is not an approved use. Baseball began testing players for
steroids in 2003 and banned human growth hormone in 2005. Growth hormone
cannot be detected via a urine test, and baseball only screens players'
urine.

Guillen's orders
On May 1, 2002, while he was playing for the Diamondbacks, Guillen placed
his first order with the Florida center, paying by wire transfer for $2,180
worth of growth hormone, the steroids testosterone cypionate and nandrolone
and syringes, the records show. The drugs were shipped to a Phoenix address.
Guillen struggled with the Diamondbacks in 2002, hitting .229 with just four
homers before being released in midseason.

Guillen started the 2003 season with the Cincinnati Reds and was having a
career year when he was traded to the playoff-bound A's on July 30. On Sept.
19, 2003, Guillen used a credit card to order $2,083 worth of Genotropin, a
brand name for human growth hormone, along with the steroids testosterone
propionate and stanozolol and syringes and needles, to be shipped to him
&quot;c/o Oakland Athletics-Oakland Coliseum, 7000 Coliseum Way, Oakland, CA
94621,&quot; records show.

In 45 games with the A's, Guillen hit .265 with eight home runs and 23 RBIs.
During the team's American League Division Series loss to Boston, he batted
.455. His season totals were a .311 average, 31 homers and 86 RBIs.

Guillen signed a free-agent contract to play for the Anaheim Angels in 2004.
In July, in the midst of a season in which he would hit .294 with 27 home
runs and 104 RBIs, records show Guillen placed a $6,000 order for growth
hormone, testosterone propionate and syringes. He also ordered two drugs -
clomiphene and Novarel - taken by steroid users to stimulate the production
of natural testosterone. That shipment, purchased with a credit card, was
sent to a house in San Clemente (Orange County) where Guillen lived at the
time, records show.

It was not clear from the records whether two other orders for growth
hormone and syringes placed by Guillen were actually delivered: a $4,869.50
order placed in September 2003, when he was with the A's; and a $5,000 order
placed in June 2005, when he was with the Washington Nationals.

Ex-Giant Williams
From 1987 to 1996, Williams was one of the Giants' most popular players. His
best year in San Francisco was 1993, when he batted .294 with 38 home runs
and 100 RBIs. In 1994, he was on pace to break Roger Maris' single-season
home run record, but a labor dispute ended the season in August, and he
finished with 43 home runs. After the 1996 season, many Giants fans were
irate when he was sent to Cleveland in the Jeff Kent trade. Williams was
traded the following year to Arizona and finished his career there in 2003.

During his penultimate season in Arizona, records show, Williams placed two
orders with the Palm Beach Rejuvenation Center. On March 9, 2002, while the
Diamondbacks were in spring training in Tucson, records show he ordered
$5,693 worth of testosterone cypionate, growth hormone, clomiphene, Novarel
and syringes. On May 8, Williams ordered $6,000 worth of testosterone
cypionate, nandrolone, clomiphene, Novarel and syringes, according to the
records. The drugs were sent to a Scottsdale business office Williams long
has used as a mailing address. Williams' prescriptions were written by the
same dentist who prescribed growth hormone for Byrd and Guillen.

Injuries limited Williams to just 60 games in 2002, and he hit .260 with 12
home runs and 40 RBIs. He retired the following June after playing in just
43 games. Today he works as a broadcaster on Diamondbacks games. In 2004 and
2005, after he had retired as a player, Williams placed three orders
totaling about $11,000 for additional growth hormone and syringes, according
to the records.

Since retiring, Williams has publicly questioned the performance-enhancing
value of steroids for baseball players. In April 2004, while the BALCO
steroids scandal was beginning to unfold, Williams said he hoped Giants
outfielder Barry Bonds would be exonerated in the case, and he downplayed
the impact the drugs might have on a player's power hitting.

&quot;The other side of that coin is, you still have to hit the ball out of the
ballpark. You still have to hit the ball properly,&quot; Williams told reporters
at the time.

&quot;If you put some foreign substance in your body, you don't all of a sudden
learn how to hit homers,&quot; he said. &quot;The question is: Are they illegal? Yes.
If you get caught doing it, should you be punished? Yes. What that is, I
don't know. I had a hard enough time playing third base.&quot;

In a phone interview Monday, Williams said that after his 2002 ankle injury,
a doctor told him that growth hormone might help him heal. He said he
learned about the Florida center from a health magazine and went through a
battery of tests before obtaining a prescription for growth hormone in 2002.

&quot;I didn't like the effects it had on my body,&quot; said Williams, saying he
stopped using the drug that season.

Williams said he had no knowledge that a dentist was prescribing growth
hormone for him. He said he wasn't familiar with the drug clomiphene, nor
did he comment on the steroids that were ordered. He declined to comment on
orders placed with the center after he retired.

&gt;&gt; Burt, what's the end game here?  What (if any) larger point are you
&gt;&gt; trying to make by means of these questions?

&gt;&gt; If you firmly believed that Bonds had never done steroids or HGH, then
&gt;&gt; I could understand where you're going.  But if (as I think I read you)
&gt;&gt; you agree he did use the stuff and are simply making the (perfectly
&gt;&gt; valid) point that lots of others did as well -- then what difference
&gt;&gt; does it make that some of the users (Bonds, McGwire, Sosa, etc.) got
&gt;&gt; much bigger and displayed obvious changes in physical appearance while
&gt;&gt; they were on the stuff and other users (Byrd, for example) did not?

&gt;&gt; To get things off Bonds if he is the real issue for you, just take
&gt;&gt; McGwire and Sosa instead.  They obviously got much larger and more
&gt;&gt; musclebound while using and likely hit a lot more homers than they
&gt;&gt; would've if clean.  How does the fact that Paul Byrd didn't display
&gt;&gt; the same symptoms have any bearing on Big Mac or Sammy?  Does it
&gt;&gt; suggest to you in some way that McGwire and Sosa didn't use the
&gt;&gt; stuff?  I don't understand where you're coming from in this debate.

&gt;&gt; SGH

&gt; ****************

&gt; I wouldn't think every person used the same &quot;cocktail&quot; to achieve
&gt; their goal.
&gt; Therefore, I would think that some players appearance might markedly
&gt; change, whereas others'--not so much.

Which is exactly why judging by appearance is totally flawed.

&gt;&gt; &gt; characteristic (like appearance) and claiming it is &quot;a factor&quot; in
&gt;&gt; &gt; figuring out whether someone used steroids or HGH needn't suggest
&gt;&gt; &gt; (logically) that one &quot;can tell a 'roid or HGH user just by looking at
&gt;&gt; &gt; them.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Appearance means how somebody looks. Now tell me why you should be able
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; tell by how one person looks, and not be able to tell by how another
&gt;&gt; person
&gt;&gt; looks? If appearance is a factor, how come it's a factor for some, yet
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; for others?
&gt;&gt; Nobody can seem to answer that one, so far.

&gt;&gt; &gt; To use another context: I would argue that a someone's height is &quot;a
&gt;&gt; &gt; factor&quot; in evaluating whether he can be a great basketball player.
&gt;&gt; &gt; That I certainly don't believe that I can &quot;tell a great basketball
&gt;&gt; &gt; player just by looking at him&quot; doesn't negate or undercut that
&gt;&gt; &gt; argument.

&gt;&gt; Then you should clearly understand my argument. If somebody gets bigger
&gt;&gt; over
&gt;&gt; the course of time, they could be on steroids, but that doesn't
&gt;&gt; necessarily
&gt;&gt; mean they are. Especially since we now know that appearance doesn't
&gt;&gt; necessarily have anything to do with being a steroids user.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Now if the people you're arguing with actually said that appearance is
&gt;&gt; &gt; the only factor they would need to see in order to determine who has
&gt;&gt; &gt; used steroids and who has not, then I think you're making a good point
&gt;&gt; &gt; and showing them to be inconsistent.

&gt;&gt; Again, my question is, if appearance is a factor, why with some and not
&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt; others?

&gt; ****************

&gt; I think when people have mentioned appearance here, they have used the
&gt; term in relation to what a person used to look like as compared to
&gt; their later appearance.  In this case Bonds' appearance changed quite
&gt; a bit--all I personally recall about Matt Williams changing was his
&gt; hairline.  Doesn't mean he wasn't a user though.  Could mean he used
&gt; less, or that it just didn't affect him in the same way.
