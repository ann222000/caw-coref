I tried to compile this simple program:

program helloWorld;
#include( &quot;stdlib.hhf&quot; );

begin helloWorld;

stdout.put( &quot;Hello, World of Assembly Language&quot;, nl );

end helloWorld;

with

hla -v teste.hla

and got this:

Use an Assembler. Assembly is much simpler than such HLLs,
outputing more than 7000 lines for one line of yours. In
Assembly, when you write one line, the Assembler outputs
one line, and if this line is wrong, the error message
tells you were it is located, and which is the problem.

If you are a pure beginner, i recommend you to start with
the Twelve Assembly Lessons, available at RosAsm Site, in
the Tutorials section:

Nothing much surprising. This guy outputs a downward

He doesn't even recall of which is what, sometimes.

Hope you don't get into a trough though. :)

Seriously Randy needs to provide an &quot;all-in-one&quot; package, with versions for
Linux and Windows of course, incorporating the HLA binaries, includes,
reference manual, a copy of AoA, and any other miscellaneous tidbits, all
extracting into a single neat directory tree, with the appropriate
environment variables preset.

Basically &quot;unzip/untar&quot; and hit the road running, so to speak. :)

The current installation procedure is just too involved for rank beginners,
particularly those who opt for the &quot;manual&quot; method.

Lots of luck Rafael!

No problem, Rafael. There are plenty of good tutorials
over the net. But if you fall into the trap of that one,
you will have almost no possibility to ever get out of
the trap, nor to ever learn Assembly:

You can eventually learn Inline Asm with an HLL having
inline Assembly, but HLA is not this kind of tool. This
is a tool specificaly designed for making it impossible
to the beginners to learn Assembly. The reason why the
syntax is alien, the reason why there is no difference
in between pseudo inline Assembly and pure HLL, the
reason why the Pdfs are Megas and megas of blabla, and
so on.

Also, Randall Hyde being an HLL/VHLL user, he is not
in any position where he could teach others &quot;do what
i am unable to do&quot;. He has not even been able to write
an Assembler in HLL/VHLL, and had to steal one written
by somebody else (FASM: written by Thomasz G. in FASM
Auto-compilable Assembly)!

What you could learn in two weeks with any Assembly
Tutorial, you will not learn it in two years with HLA,
which, anyway, has no relationship with Assembly:

Assembly is way simpler than this HLL.

Hmmm...
It sounds like you've installed some code in the &quot;../Program Files/&quot;
directory. Command-line tools are notorious for not liking programs
installed in directory paths that have spaces (or other delimiters) in
them.

Where, exactly, have you installed HLA? That might be the source of
your problems.

Another suggestion is to grab the HIDE (HLA IDE) package -- it handles
a lot of the directory stuff behind your back and people who've had
problems setting up the paths for HLA have had pretty good success
using HIDE.

You can find HIDE here:

Here's your problem. Spaces are &quot;legal&quot; in filenames, and directory
names, but they cause endless problems!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

PoLink sees &quot;Program&quot;, then a space (which it expects to be a
&quot;delimiter&quot;), and thinks &quot;Program&quot; is an object to be linked. :(

If you're setting those pathnames with &quot;setpath.bat&quot; or so, changing all
references to &quot;Program Files&quot; to &quot;Progra~1&quot; is probably the easiest way
to fix it.

know what a &quot;real beginner&quot; thinks of it. You say in another post:

&quot;The &quot;click here, open
there, go there, and
come back&quot; didn´t suit me.&quot;

Okay, didn't suit your learning style... At least you looked at it. Did
you get anything at all out of it, do you think? You go on to say:

&quot;But I will get trough, eventualy.&quot;

That's the attitude you'll need! Folks who give up easy don't learn
assembly.

Best,
Frank

You also have to set up environment variables and paths. Largely,

If someone opts for the manual method, the assumption is that they
know what they are doing. If they don't know what they are doing, they
shouldn't use the manual method. They should use hlasetup.exe, or just
grab the HIDE package, and go that route.

Now at *some* point, I ought to do an install package for Linux.
However, I generally assume that someone working under Linux is a bit
more comfortable with things like setting up environment variables and
paths. Granted, that's not always a valid assumption, but people who
operate Linux are generally a bit more comfortable with concepts like
command-line tools, environment variables, paths, and stuff like that.

At one point or another (after getting the HLA stdlib into a form it
can be more easily ported to other OSes), I'll produce a MacOS version
of HLA and at that point I'll probably have to address the issue of an
installer under MacOS. But for Linux and FreeBSD, I'm just going to go
with the assumption that people who are installing HLA under Linux
know what they're doing. (and, despite my qualms about an installer
package for Linux, installing under Linux really isn't much more than
a gunzip and untar operation; all you have to do beyond that point is
set your execution path to include the /usr/hla subdirectory).

you get anything at all out of it, do you think?&quot;

I was impressed by the quickness of the disassembly feature.
I was impressed by the goal to make the &quot;equivalent of delphi&quot; for
asm.

I enjoyed playing with the debugger. I already knew few of the first
instructions(nop for instance),
so not a lot of new stuff there. I guess what I will really remember
from it is that &quot;asm programs begin
on main&quot; much like C. I got confused when having to press f5,f6,f7
while reading
the tutorial and eventualy those keys started to behave as though I
was pressing enter
and the text where the coments were began to get identations, instead
of the
debuger functinality being fired.

I would rather have a tuturial in say pdf,  and then coding on another
envirment. Having to learn *the* IDE, from the ide, and the language
at the same time was quite heavy for me.
(I could have learned the ide first, but I have been learning so many
ides lately, that I wasn´t in the mood for it).

I guess when I start getting serious about rosasm I will master the
ide first.
Right now I just wanna learn the language, and have something
producing nice
.exes out of it. I don´t mind writting it on notepad...

Assumption is the mother of fuckup. The man's right, Randy - a mention
of the problem might be in order. I, too, when advising Nasm newbies,
tend to &quot;assume&quot; that they know how to work a command line. T'ain't
always so.

Can you still get help from the command prompt? At one time you could
type &quot;help path&quot;, e.g. and get into a huge help system. Dunno if that
still works under NT-based 'doze.

Rafael has apparently got past this point, but a warning about notepad's
propensity to save your masterpiece as &quot;hello.hla.txt&quot; might not hurt.
(not unique to HLA, of course, the thing's just an uppity editor!)

If you want a constructive feedback, don´t assume people &quot;don´t know
what they are doing&quot; because they install your software on Program
Files
and set the path to it. Just inform them to set the path variables
to Progra~1 and install it on it(which is the default place for
programs,
nobody likes to have tons of programs on root directory anyway).

You don´t have to build the combinatorial universe of all
possibilites that could go wrong if this wasn´t done. This change
solves it all.

Again, I am assuming you want constructive feedback. As for the rest,
thanks for solving my problem.

The smallest program that will compile and run in rosasm is

main:

If you paste this code inside a &quot;file/new/empty&quot; template, it will compile

...

If you have previous experience with C under windows, I recommend the
RosAsm versions of the Izcellion tuts, for reading. That will in a few
hours give you a full glimse at how easy asm under windows really is.

basically what you need to know about asm under windows, is that most
functions returns values in eax. Then, also many return them in pointers
to structures.

example:

[WindowHandle: ?      ;one DWORD
MyDC: ?         ]   ;another one

;the data above is roughly equivalent to Delphi:
; var WindowHandle, MyDC : THandle;  //where Thandle = longint = dword =
32bit

;asm code:

call 'user32.GetDC' D$WindowHandle
;now eax will cointain a handle of the HDC
;so you may save it:

mov D$MyDC eax

; **************** another that returns in pointer

[PointerToRectangleStructure: ? ? ? ?]
; this is 4 DWORD, or 16 bytes, one dword each for (left, top right,
bottom)

call 'user32.GetClientRect' D$WindowHandle PointerToRectangleStructure

(notis that when passing a pointer, you do not need the D$
also, you do not need , (comma) for seperating parameters, but they are
optional there. They are used as line continuation chars. read BU_ASM)

Else, you need to know that esi, edi, and ebx are preserved across all
win32 API calls, and that the other registers are usually not.

programming the &quot;lowlevel&quot; win32 api, in RosAsm differs from Delphi only
in that in Delphi you would write :

GetWindowRect( WindowHandle, MyRect );

(you can create macros for rosasm to make them more similar)

I suppose that, when opening such a software, you have to face
all of the components at once, and that there some kind of
overloading of informations: The Editors, its many functions,
the Debugger window, and so on... plus the... tutorial. So,
yes, of course, there must be an effort to do on the first
Lesson_1, but this is not _that_ complicated:

* Depressing [F5] for a run.

* Depressing [F8] for stepping through.

So, even adding the other minor introductions of the IDE
functionalities, plus the &quot;new thing, normal difficulties&quot;,
I do not think that we could make it simpler nor shorter.
I would wish, but this does not seem to me possible to do.

Also, i think that learning this first lesson, and getting
used of the manipulation of a couple of keys is worthy the
small effort, because all of the other Lessons make it
possible to learn Assembly as easily as you learned &quot;Main&quot;
and &quot;nop&quot;...

The Twelve Lessons are based on a method which is close to
&quot;learn by doing&quot; (even though a pure beginer is not supposed
to do much, he is incitated to do so, here and there...).

Most people prefer this method than linear traditional studies.

His problem was much probably with the first lesson, which is
indeed a bit too long, and which has to introduce some of the
environement details, needed for the other lessons, like the
Right-Click features, and such.

We have re-worked this first lesson many times, but, from the
feed-backs, it seem to be now &quot;tuned&quot;, and i do not think
possible to make it shorter.

Also, there seem to be a very funny counter effect to simpicity
and efficiency:

What does NOT work, seem to interrest more people than what
works. I do not think that young guys would be particulary
maso. Maybe they played to much this kind of game, where

It may be the default place for Windows, but it certainly is not not

like to have HLA installed&quot;, the default value was C:\HLA. Granted,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I don't know. In the past seven years I've seen this problem three or
four times. Granted, people have run into problems with path names
containing spaces before, but installing HLA in the &quot;Program Files&quot;
directory is *not* that common. Perhaps it's mainly because most first
time users use the installation program and use the default path, but
installing HLA in &quot;Program Files&quot; just hasn't been a common problem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt;If you accept my humble sugestion, a warning like &quot;don´t install on

&gt; &gt; Throughout the installation instructions, I keep using the path &quot;C:
&gt; &gt; \HLA&quot;
&gt; &gt; I suggest the use of this path.
&gt; &gt; I stop just sort of *requiring* this path (as, say, MASM32 will do
&gt; &gt; with its required installation path).

&gt; &gt; My assumption is that if you deviate from the manual installation

Well, at *some* point you have to make *some* assumptions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The man's right, Randy - a mention
&gt; of the problem might be in order.
">

There is no question that a rewrite of the entire HLA installation
process would be a good thing at this point; particularly as the
manual installation instructions assume you're installing MASM as the
back-end assembler. That task will become the high-priority item when
the HLA stdlib v2.x is complete and I do the port to FreeBSD (at which
point the installation instructions will need to be rewritten,
anyway). Until then, we can handle these problems manually.

You might argue that &quot;it's not a big deal to add this one line today.&quot;
But it is a big deal. Because there are a dozen or so other issues
that could be argued to have equal priority (even more priority,
because they come up far more often). For example, a line about
POASM's behavior with .BSS sections is a *far* more pressing need. A
better description of how all the tools work together would be
useful.  I have a fair sized list of improvements that need to be
made. When the FreeBSD edition appears, I will address those issues.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I, too, when advising Nasm newbies,
&gt; tend to &quot;assume&quot; that they know how to work a command line. T'ain't
&gt; always so.
">

This is why, for example, I assume that Linux people are a bit more
advanced that Windows people. It's unreasonable to expect new Windows
HLA users to know anything at all about the command line. It's
unreasonable to expect a Linux user *not* to know anything about the
command line.

Sure. But you have to know what to ask for. When someone is getting a
problem like &quot;C:\Program.obj&quot; how would they know that they need to
read about command-line argument separators?

Then again, I'm going to have to try to install HLA in &quot;Program Files&quot;
and try this experiment myself. If the problem was running the linker,
I'm surprised that the path names weren't quoted by HLA.EXE already.

">

Yes, that is a *very* common issue. One that has plagued programmers
for years. That is why, for example, that the HLA installation
instructions have included the following paragraph for years:

&quot;WARNING: if you are a notepad.exe user, note that in certain Windows
modes notepad will always append &quot;.txt&quot; to the end of the filename you
specify. This will cause HLA to fail if you attempt to compile such
source files (because HLA expects the filename to end with &quot;.hla&quot; not
&quot;.txt&quot;. Be aware of this problem.&quot;

Rest assured that if the &quot;\Program Files\...&quot; problem had occured
anywhere near as often, it would have already been mentioned in the
HLA documentation as well.

Sure. Just not a path that contains spaces.
Actually, even *spaces* are okay, if you don't mind quoting all your
file paths when running HLA from the command line. Not a pleasant
thought, though.

As for beginners, the manual tells them to install at C:\HLA. There is
a reason for this: I generally assume that beginners *don't* know a
whole lot about issues related to the command-line and acceptable
parameters to command-line tools. Therefore, if they deviate from this
suggestion, there is the chance that they will run into problems. Now
someone with a little experience, who knows what they're doing, could
move HLA somewhere else (e.g., I put it at &quot;G:\HLA&quot; on my develpment
machine at home). But first timers really ought to install it at C:
\HLA, as the installation instructions recommend, or else they can run
into problems.

I have been tempted, over the years, to *require* the use of C:\HLA
(say, along the lines of what Hutch has done with MASM32) because that
would have eliminated 95% of the installation problems that have been
reported over those years. However, for people with multiple OS
installations, or people working on network servers (e.g., students at
school) it isn't always possible to install HLA on the C: drive.
Hence, I deal with the one or two awry installations that happen each
month. Given that I'm seeing about a 5% failure rate on installations
right now, that's not too big of a deal.

As I've said many times in the past, I'd be far more concerned if
there were *no* issues arising with the installation of HLA. Because
if that were the case, that would simply mean that people are no
longer installing HLA :-).  The only reason you don't see one or two
problems per month with RosAsm is, well, because you have anywhere
near the number of people trying out RosAsm each month.

No, he *was* talking about HIDE installation, which is more prolonged than
hlasetup.exe.

On a related matter I notice that Randy has hardcoded &quot;usr/hla/&quot; as the base
directory for all the HLA files for Linux. I wish he had just used
an &quot;hla/&quot; prefix. The latter form is far more flexible, since writing
to /usr and /usr/local usually need root permissions. Previous versions did
not have an explicit base directory. One more issue is that the header
files have the execute bit set. Nothing major, but a minor point.

Also IMHO, the output for the '-?' and '-license' options should not be
broken into screenfulls but dumped at once. This allows convinient
redirecting to a file. If the user needs to see it a screenfull at a time,
he can always pipe to less. Also far more whitespace than necessary is
emitted between each screenfull.

PS. To Randy: You mentioned renaming hla to lla to disable HLL constructs.
Can we also invoke as mla and expect exception handling to be disabled?

Reflecting on how I always learned hlls,
I realised the most important thing tutorials
need are the little &quot;final exams&quot; at the end of each chapter.

Those programming exercises have always served me as a &quot;self
evaluation tool&quot;,
telling me whether or not I was ready to go to the next chapter.

In the case of assembly, exercises not only on programing, but also on
binary/hex arithmetic, boolean algebra, registers name and what´s
their use, and on basicaly everything you are covering, are of great
help.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;but when someone does something like
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;installing the program in &quot;C:/Program Files/hla&quot; (manually), what can

&gt; &gt; Pretty much the &quot;default place&quot; for Windows, isn't it?

&gt; It may be the default place for Windows, but it certainly is not not
&gt; the default place for an HLA installation. I.e., when I just ran
&gt; hlasetup.exe, and it told me to &quot;Select the folder where you would
&gt; like to have HLA installed&quot;, the default value was C:\HLA. Granted,
&gt; you don't get this nice message when doing things manually, but that's
&gt; one of the reasons the HLA installation instructions say &quot;first time
&gt; users should not install HLA manually.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Happens often
&gt; &gt; enough that the error is quite familiar to &quot;HLA watchers&quot;.

&gt; I don't know. In the past seven years I've seen this problem three or
&gt; four times. Granted, people have run into problems with path names
&gt; containing spaces before, but installing HLA in the &quot;Program Files&quot;
&gt; directory is *not* that common. Perhaps it's mainly because most first
&gt; time users use the installation program and use the default path, but
&gt; installing HLA in &quot;Program Files&quot; just hasn't been a common problem.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;If you accept my humble sugestion, a warning like &quot;don´t install on
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;paths
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;having spaces&quot; or &quot;remember that command line tools need paths to be
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;in 8 char style&quot; would have been helpfull.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Throughout the installation instructions, I keep using the path &quot;C:
&gt; &gt; &gt; \HLA&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I suggest the use of this path.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I stop just sort of *requiring* this path (as, say, MASM32 will do
&gt; &gt; &gt; with its required installation path).

&gt; &gt; &gt; My assumption is that if you deviate from the manual installation
&gt; &gt; &gt; instructions, you know what you are doing.

&gt; &gt; Assumption is the mother of fuckup.

&gt; Well, at *some* point you have to make *some* assumptions.

&gt; &gt; The man's right, Randy - a mention
&gt; &gt; of the problem might be in order.

&gt; There is no question that a rewrite of the entire HLA installation
&gt; process would be a good thing at this point; particularly as the
&gt; manual installation instructions assume you're installing MASM as the
&gt; back-end assembler. That task will become the high-priority item when
&gt; the HLA stdlib v2.x is complete and I do the port to FreeBSD (at which
&gt; point the installation instructions will need to be rewritten,
&gt; anyway). Until then, we can handle these problems manually.

&gt; You might argue that &quot;it's not a big deal to add this one line today.&quot;
&gt; But it is a big deal. Because there are a dozen or so other issues
&gt; that could be argued to have equal priority (even more priority,
&gt; because they come up far more often). For example, a line about
&gt; POASM's behavior with .BSS sections is a *far* more pressing need. A
&gt; better description of how all the tools work together would be
&gt; useful.  I have a fair sized list of improvements that need to be
&gt; made. When the FreeBSD edition appears, I will address those issues.

&gt; &gt; I, too, when advising Nasm newbies,
&gt; &gt; tend to &quot;assume&quot; that they know how to work a command line. T'ain't
&gt; &gt; always so.

&gt; This is why, for example, I assume that Linux people are a bit more
&gt; advanced that Windows people. It's unreasonable to expect new Windows
&gt; HLA users to know anything at all about the command line. It's
&gt; unreasonable to expect a Linux user *not* to know anything about the
&gt; command line.

&gt; &gt; Can you still get help from the command prompt? At one time you could
&gt; &gt; type &quot;help path&quot;, e.g. and get into a huge help system. Dunno if that
&gt; &gt; still works under NT-based 'doze.

&gt; Sure. But you have to know what to ask for. When someone is getting a
&gt; problem like &quot;C:\Program.obj&quot; how would they know that they need to
&gt; read about command-line argument separators?

&gt; Then again, I'm going to have to try to install HLA in &quot;Program Files&quot;
&gt; and try this experiment myself. If the problem was running the linker,
&gt; I'm surprised that the path names weren't quoted by HLA.EXE already.

&gt; &gt; Rafael has apparently got past this point, but a warning about notepad's
&gt; &gt; propensity to save your masterpiece as &quot;hello.hla.txt&quot; might not hurt.
&gt; &gt; (not unique to HLA, of course, the thing's just an uppity editor!)

&gt; Yes, that is a *very* common issue. One that has plagued programmers
&gt; for years. That is why, for example, that the HLA installation
&gt; instructions have included the following paragraph for years:

&gt; &quot;WARNING: if you are a notepad.exe user, note that in certain Windows
&gt; modes notepad will always append &quot;.txt&quot; to the end of the filename you
&gt; specify. This will cause HLA to fail if you attempt to compile such
&gt; source files (because HLA expects the filename to end with &quot;.hla&quot; not
&gt; &quot;.txt&quot;. Be aware of this problem.&quot;

&gt; Rest assured that if the &quot;\Program Files\...&quot; problem had occured
&gt; anywhere near as often, it would have already been mentioned in the
&gt; HLA documentation as well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, that's interesting. You might want to drop Sevag a line and find
&gt; &gt; &gt; out what your problem is.

&gt; &gt; I *think* he's talking about your installer...

&gt; Well, then, there is a communication problem here because his reply
&gt; was to the comment about installing HIDE.

&gt; &gt; Honest, Randy, the guy's giving you valuable feedback, and you're
&gt; &gt; arguing with him!

&gt; Uh, I was not arguing with *him*. I was arguing with Santosh. He
&gt; seemed to take my comments to Santosh personally and tore into me
&gt; about it.  Now I'm arguing with you about it. Do you consider these
&gt; debates &quot;arguing with him?&quot;

&gt; &gt; You really are starting to act like Betov. You gotta
&gt; &gt; knock off &quot;the war&quot;, man - it's bad for ya!

&gt; Go back and follow the thread once more.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Reflecting on how I always learned hlls,
&gt; I realised the most important thing tutorials
&gt; need are the little &quot;final exams&quot; at the end of each chapter.
&gt; Those programming exercises have always served me as a &quot;self
&gt; evaluation tool&quot;,
&gt; telling me whether or not I was ready to go to the next chapter.
&gt; In the case of assembly, exercises not only on programing, but also on
&gt; binary/hex arithmetic, boolean algebra, registers name and what´s
&gt; their use, and on basicaly everything you are covering, are of great
&gt; help.

Thanks for your response, even I never planned to write a full
tutorial, I'll keep it in mind and may add a few pages.

&gt; &quot;Well, anyway, thanks for the feedback&quot;

&gt; You are welcome. If you still want feedback, I just disassembled
&gt; HELLO.EXE a program
&gt; coming with FASM, reassembled and got a diferent message than that
&gt; of the original HELLO.EXE. You can get it at the fasm distribution.

Yes. It is extreemely difficult for a Disassembler to analyse
such PEs' constructs. Holly also fails to Disassemble correctly
this kind of very short PEs, with data and code inter-leaved at
a very small metric. This is a classical case. For the analyses
of what is Code and what is data, under some sizes of chunks, it
is no more possible to tell what is what.
