Same as POP server.

Alpha VMS 8.3, TCPIP Services 5.6

Someone can log in with any username/password combination without
generating any OPCOM &quot;login failure&quot; messages, generating intrusion
record or getting it logged to the audit server logs.

AKA: VMS is vulnerable to brute force attacks from not only the POP but
also the IMAP servers.

(XDM was also vulnerable at 5.3 but I haven't teste it since).

In other words, ANA/AUDIT no longer gives you a trustable list of wrong
username/password attempst since so many service don't signal such
events to the audit server.

The only clue is in:

TCPIP$IMAP_HOME:

example:

IIRC IMAP is not a secure protocol and therefore its not recommended
to be allowing it on a interface connected to an untrusted network.

Have you reported this to HP?

It's only as secure as the layered software you choose to run on it!

On top of standard Intrusion Detection: -

What if the login attack was successful; is the last login time(s) updated?

What privileges do your Apache, Tomcat, PHP, Python, and WASD, servers run
under?

Do all these servers assume the VMS persona of the client before attemting
to access file/devices etc?

If we all continue to ignore Session-Hijacking do you reakon it'll go away?

Cookies, Session Ids, Expiration Dates - that's what VMS is all about these
days :-( Why do you claim it is more secure than anything else?

What's the authentication module for SOAP? Jan-Erik? Still HTTPS or is that
not part of the specification?

From the TCPIP management 5.6 manual page 20-1:
##
The IMAP server uses security features provided in the protocol and in
the OpenVMS operating system, as well as additional security measures.
These methods provide a secure process that minimizes the possibility of
inappropriate access to a user’s mail file on the served system.

It is clear that it doesn't use the OpenVMS security features. I can
understand debate about intrusion detection. (can cause denial of
service). But the lack of logging to audit server is inexcusable.

You seem to be of the opinion that it is perfectly acceptable to have
this and that when limited to a corporate intranet, there is no danger
of a malicious emnployee running a script to do brute force password
guessing on the CEO's account.

that is why it is best to stay on a stable OLDER version of
VMS so that you are not running on the cutting edge or
you may get cut ...

also, it is best to use IMAP or other software from a secondary
vendor (i.e. Process Software) that hires VMS pros who know
what they are doing, and not some new programmer in India
or somewhere who doesn't know what they are doing ...

Any program on a VMS system that evaluates a username/password from an
unauthorized source (Username: prompt, web page or POP/IMAP protocol)
*must* invoke the intrusion routines.

The $SCAN_INTRUSION service historically provided this service, and the
newer $ACM service provides integrated intrusion detection with password
validation unlike $GETUAI/$HASH_PASSWORD.

If a program doesn't do this, it is seriously broken, and is providing a
back door around VMS's standard intrusion detection mechanism.

This typically comes about when Unix-centric developers are involved,
who are not aware of the intrusion detection routines on VMS.  That it
is happening with a standard HP product is shameful.

It should be fixed as a matter of urgency.

In the meantime, please note that PMDF's IMAP/POP servers do perform
this task properly.

You call the same 800 number you'd use if you had a contract.  Tell the
screener that you want to report a security problem with VMS.

The last time I had a contract the number was 1-800-354-9000.  That was
3-1/2 years ago and may be 3-1/2 years out of date!!  YMMV.   In fact
the custom of taking reports of security problems from people without

HTTPS for transport encryption and a oldfashioned username/password

Hi Arne,

I'd be interested in hearing the experiences of others who've found the need
to run their servers or servlet-containers at higher privileges.

And for those of you who like VMS Auditing; how do you feel about the
Server's username being logged against the audit logs for failed access
attempts rather than the Client's username? Or wouldn't it be nice to have a
trigger on an Rdb database table that could log the table access into an
auditing table using the Session User Intrinsic rather than the System User?

Ok, but can you explain a little more about the
WS-Authorization/Authentication mechanisms involved? I guess I was asking
Jan-Erik which method his SOAP implementation was using to pass
Client-Authorization so that we could at least have a real world SOAP
example. (Anyone been able to find examples on the HP/VMS site?)

The gSOAP site says that gSOAP supports WS-Security and unless Jan-Erik's
client doesn't request much except read-only Google-maps or &quot;Give me the
weather forcast&quot; stuff, I'm guessing that the target of his SOAP-call would
want to validate that a) the client is who he says he is, and b) that he's
authorized to perform the requested action on the requested data. I, for
one, am very interested in the codepath for how this is being achieved!

Do you have to pass authorization for each SOAP call, or are you aiming for
a Single-Sign-on mechanism like SAML? The term &quot;Security Interceptors&quot;
sounds interesting also.

As long as our System Managers are abrogating our control over our servers,
data, and security, I'd just like to know a bit more.

Who is your &quot;Identity Provider&quot;? How much does it cost? How long do the
identities live? How do you prevent Identity-Hijacking a la mode de
JavaScript Session-Hijacking? How could one integrate the Identity-providers
&quot;Identity&quot; with our VMS Usernames?

How many of you are working on, or have even seen (website please), an
application that combines update functionality (not
news/sports/weather-aggregators or language translators) from two or more
disparate, heterogenous SOAP servers and RPCs? WS-AT? &quot;Business Activity&quot;
transactions? BEA got a debit/credit thing happening with OracleiAS
somewhere?

Wanting point-to-point access from you to your bank-account is just too
pedestrian I guess? Having the bank make the account transfers at the
back-end rather than parking your Universal Currency Units temporarily in a
Business Facilitator with compensatory-transaction skills, is clearly the
way of the future. . .for some.

WS-S basically normalize the XML and sign/encrypt it using

Caller can be authenticated that way. Authorization has to be

You can use WS-S with SAML and other. But basic WS-S is just signing
the message with the callers private key and the server checking
with the public key. I have never worked with SAML, so I can not

&gt; Who is your &quot;Identity Provider&quot;? How much does it cost? How long do the
&gt; identities live? How do you prevent Identity-Hijacking a la mode de
&gt; JavaScript Session-Hijacking? How could one integrate the Identity-providers
&gt; &quot;Identity&quot; with our VMS Usernames?

A lot of the SOAP stuff is system-system oriented and do not use
sophisticated identity stuff.

And I have never heard about a &quot;SYSUAF based&quot; identity system.

&gt; How many of you are working on, or have even seen (website please), an
&gt; application that combines update functionality (not
&gt; news/sports/weather-aggregators or language translators) from two or more
&gt; disparate, heterogenous SOAP servers and RPCs? WS-AT? &quot;Business Activity&quot;
&gt; transactions? BEA got a debit/credit thing happening with OracleiAS
&gt; somewhere?

I have seen a lot of SOAP stuff.

None that are public available. As I said earlier, then the interesting
stuff is usually not public.

I have not had to work with transaction WS standards - yet.

SOAP is a W3C standard not an OASIS standard.

(but OASIS do a lot of the other WS standards mentioned)
