This one is a lot more expository than humorous.  Oh well.

There I was...

John Wayne had his Dirty Japs.  Conehead had Rat-Eating
Commie Bastards.  These arrangements had a certain
symmetry which appealed to me.

Such are the thoughts of a young man about to launch on his
first weapons hop in Advanced Jet.  It was 8 July 1983.

Today I was bomb-only, six Mark 76 blue bombs on the
centerline MER.  My three playmates were similarly armed.
In later flights we'd carry bombs, 2.75 inch FFARs, 20mm
cannon ammo, or mixes of the above.  Captain Jack Anzur,
my IP, showed me how to preflight the ejector rack, then
we manned up.  Anzur was an A-6 guy, the lead instructor
at VT-22 for air-to-ground phase.  He'd been one of my
instructors for low-level nav, and he'd been pretty cool
about the standard 500-foot student min altitudes, telling me
that as long as I didn't bust a hundred feet, I could have fun.
He'd even shown me how to buzz cattle and flocks of sheep
out in the south Texas hill country.  But today was much
more serious in that regard-you don't screw around much
in the 30 degree dive bomb pattern, at least not if you're a
nub.  Flight School was, in great part, a good lesson in how
to have fun and not break your ass (or your plane) while
you did it.

Some guys did get a bit too unwrapped-we'd recently had
one of our Marine studs get turned into a civilian overnight.
Snapper had been headed home from his successful A-4
CarQual a couple of weeks previously and let his enthusiasm
get the better of him.  Entering Baffin Bay at mumble feet and
going the speed of stink, he had looked up just in time to see
the masthead of a sailboat above him, on the nose and closing
(for the uninitiated, thus can only happen if you are lower than
the masthead).  He honked back on the pole and missed the
obstruction, but his exhaust had knocked the sailboat on her
beam ends.  At least, so the rumor went.  Bad enough he'd
overstressed the jet (the G meter reset button on our planes
was blocked with a tie wrap, only the PCs could reset them).
Worse, he'd lucked into a retired Navy captain sailboat
skipper who knew how to read side numbers (we just
wondered how the bastard had had the time to do so).
Snapper had gotten the 'X'; he was a qual, and the Boat was
his last requirement to get his wings.  His parents had already
bought their plane tickets to attend Snapper's winging, but it
was not to be.  He was off the base in less than 24 hours, an
object lesson in, if not 'what not to do,' at least the
consequences of getting caught.

Sitting in the chocks and ready to go, I turned on the gunsight
and set it on the horizon as a close approximation of the
aircraft boresight.  None of this gyro-coupled bobbing and
weaving of the pipper for us; the Scooter, at least as we flew
it, was a manual bomber.  Let those Air Force weenies fly
around with their 'death dot' bombsights; we were gonna
keep the skies safe for democracy using iron sights.  Yes sir,
&quot;Fill yore hand, you sonofabitch!&quot;

I was slated as Dash Two in a flight of four.  We were not
permitted to make section takeoffs in Weapons hops, and
used a ten second trail of singles instead.  Once we were
joined up in a nice, tight parade, Lead kicked us back into
cruise formation, a much more comfortable arrangement
with doubled separation and a sixty degree line of bearing.
Captain Anzur didn't have much to say on the ride out to the
target complex, which was fine by me.  I was busy flashing
back on all the John Wayne World War Deuce flying movies
I had ever seen.  I checked my switch settings about a dozen
times, and adjusted the brightness on the gunsight, then dialed
in the mil depression for 30 degree divebomb from the gouge
card on the panel.  I always flew with the gunsight on, it just
felt right that way.  I'd drawn beads on innumerable school
buses (we called 'em &quot;yellow troop carriers&quot;) during Fam
phase and Basic, but today I was gonna be dropping actual
bombs, even if they only weighed 25 pounds and didn't go
'boom', they went 'pffft.'

Lead pulled us back into parade as we neared the target, then
he checked in with Control and gave them the spiel.  As
Control was using a right-hand pattern, he crossed the
second section to my side and we settled into echelon as he
brought the speed up to 450 knots.  I tweaked the
&quot;abbajabba&quot; artificial horizon to put the dot on the horizon,
trimmed out, and enjoyed the responsive feel of the jet at
that speed.  We spent most of our flight time at 250 knots,
and there was an enormous difference in how the bird
handled at 450.  The Scooter drove like a Porsche anyway,
vastly different from the truckish T-2 Buckeye.  In the A-4
you thought about what you wanted to do and away she
went-flying the Guppy, you sort of herded it in the direction
you wanted to go.

The target complex came into sight ahead, white-pained
engine canisters as a bullseye, concentric circles marked at
50, 150, and 300 feet.  We were aligned with the run-in line,
a road which ran radially to the center.  We roared overhead
the bull at 4500AGL, then lead kissed me off and pulled up
and to the right.  I counted five potatoes and followed him up.

Imagine a funnel, a cone, quartered vertically and set pointy
end down.  The apex rests on the bullseye, the edges are
oriented at 6 and 3 o'clock.  Six o'clock is the run-in line.  I
climbed up to 8500 feet, keeping in the turn until, as I passed
abeam the target, I had changed course 180 degrees.  I
leveled the nose but kept in the right-wing-down angle of bank.
I was arcing along the rim of the funnel.  As I approached the
run-in line I increased the pull and steepened the bank until the
wings were vertical.  I was pulling the nose across the horizon,
with my eyes fixed on the target.  Pulling level as I was, the
bullseye was well below the nose and getting more so; as my
heading neared the run-in line, the target came toward the nose.
I increased the bank, pulling the nose down until the target sat
on the canopy bow, then unloaded and snapped back upright.
The pipper, the dot at the center of the gunsight, now rested
below the bullseye.

We roared down the funnel toward the bullseye; I set the
Master Arm switch to 'on' and called &quot;Two's in hot.&quot;

&quot;Two's cleared hot,&quot;  responded the controller.

A glance ahead showed the run-in line, I was well aligned wings
level, so I set the pipper one division below the target and held
it there against the natural tendency at one G for it to slide
forward across the ground.  I could feel the speed coming up
rapidly.  Since the jet was trimmed for 450 knots, it took less
and less backstick to hold the nose still.  There was a hell of a
lot of dirt and sagebrush in the windshield.  That was a relatively
new experience for me, and I held in stick pressure against the
natural tendency to pull toward the bright blue shiny stuff above
me.  I scanned between the altimeter, the gunsight, and the
abbajabba; since I was holding less than one G, the dive was
steepening as we went.  If I was doing it right, we'd arrive at the
desired dive angle-30 degrees-just as we hit 6500 feet.  Well,
close enough, here we go.  At 6500 feet I held a steady one G,
letting the pipper slide forward again, trying to hold exactly 1G
and 30 degrees of dive angle.  Next goal was to time the
movement of the pipper so that it crossed the bullseye just as we
hit release altitude, 4500 feet.  The pipper marched ahead steadily
as I shared my attention between pipper, target, and altimeter.
Ball's out a bit to the right, think a little foot pressure on the right
rudder pedal.  Pipper's moving forward too quickly, a little
forward pressure on the stick.  Things looked pretty good and as
the pipper crossed the bullseye I pressed firmly on the pickle
button beneath my right thumb, paused for a potato, then pulled
smartly upward.

Once the nose broke the horizon I rolled right and headed back
upstairs, switching off Master Arm and calling &quot;Two's off cold.&quot;

&quot;Two, your hit 100 feet at four o'clock.&quot;

You never get to see your bombs hit.  Where's the fun in that?
Well, at least I'd hit dirt. Captain Anzur had told me in the
brief to not try to adjust for wind on this first hop, figuring (rightly)
that I had plenty on my plate as it was, but after a lifetime of
shooting I couldn't help but think about making corrections.

&quot;Got your interval in sight?&quot; asked Captain Anzur.

I hastily scanned ahead and to the right as we climbed.  There.
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;

&quot;Well, whaddya think?&quot;

I dropped the nose as we reached 8500 feet.  &quot; I think  I hit the
checkpoints pretty close, it felt good.  If  I was gonna make a
correction I'd try to drop with the pipper at ten o'clock for about
50 feet.&quot;

&quot;Fly it the same as before, let's see what we get.&quot;

I looked out to starboard just in time to see the white marking
smoke spurt up from Three's hit.  Things looked a bit close so
I took out a little bank angle.  The Scooter's wingtips weren't
much help in judging offset, they were too far aft to use as a guide
for distance from a ground point (the only way the pilot can see
the Skyhawk's wingtip is to either twist around in his seat, or
through the rearview mirror).  Over time I would develop a
picture of what to look for, just as I had grown used to what
straight and level looked like out the front window.  My second
bomb was called 80 feet at four o'clock, the third 100 at five.

&quot;Pretty good group&quot; said Captain Anzur.

&quot;Yessir, I'm gonna go for the hit this time.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot;

&quot;Two, your hit ten o'clock for 80 feet.&quot;  You could figure.  That
was where I'd aimed.  I looked around to judge the wind, but
the sneaky bastards had put the target well away from useful
things like smokestacks or busy dirt roads.  Okay, when all else
fails, do what you did last time.

&quot;Two, your hit 6 o'clock for 100 feet.&quot;

WTF?  I may have muttered it into the hot mike instead of just
thinking it.  Or maybe Captain Anzur was a mind reader.

&quot;Whadja do wrong?&quot; he laughed.

I thought back.  &quot;I pickled a little high.  Maybe I was shallow,
too.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.  Ya got one bomb left.  What are you going to do?&quot;

&quot;I got the windage right last time.  I'll do this one the way I
should have last time.&quot;

Once more around, and: &quot;Two, that's a bullseye.&quot;

Well, how about that?  Flying a good form on the way home,
I figured we were pretty safe from Commie incursions.

On later hops I would shoot rockets (rockets were great, you
could just about write your name with 'em-and you got to see
them hit!) and the 20mm cannon.  Bombs and rockets were fun,
but firing the guns was a near-orgasmic experience for me.  I
could feel all my boyhood heroes peering over my shoulder every
time I squinted through the gunsight and squeezed that red trigger
on the stick.  John Wayne, Butch O'Hare, Alex Vraciu, Robert
Johnson, they were all with me as that lovely sound and vibration
shook the jet.
