Calling The MSM Out!
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>Gotta love this : I'm a reporter for a major newspaper in the
northeastern US. I'm also a member of the Newspaper Guild. As a reporter
at the Detroit Free Press in 1995, I participated in a strike against
that newspaper, a strike which cost me my job, because I would not cross
the picket line. I take my membership in the Guild very seriously.
That's why I was dismayed to learn that you, the president of my union,
made a speech on May 13 in which you asserted that the US military has
deliberately killed journalists. The relevant portion of the speech was
videotaped and is available for viewing here. Since then, you have
failed to provide supporting evidence for your remarks, but neither have
you retracted them. I spoke with you at 11:10 AM today by telephone;
union secretary-treasurer Bernard Lunzer was also on the call. When I
told you that I would publish your response to me on the Internet, you
declined further comment--except for the following: "I am not going to
discuss this with you on the eve of Memorial Day weekend." This remark
strikes me as extremely odd. I can't think of a better time to redeem
the honor of the US military by beginning a serious investigation of
outrageous conduct on its part. If our soldiers are deliberately killing
journalists, it's our duty to publicize it, so that such a terrible
stain on our nation's integrity may be quickly cleansed. If, as I
believe, your charge is false, I can think of no better time to retract
this slander. There's a third possibility, though it seems to me a very
remote one. I don't see how it's possible to misinterpret your remarks,
which seem to me quite clear and unambiguous. But I'd be delighted to
learn that I have misunderstood them. I hold out some hope here, as I've
just read a piece on the Editor & Publisher website , written by Thomas
Lipscomb, who has covered this controversy for the Chicago Sun-Times .
Lipscomb wrote that "Foley insists that she 'doesn't believe that our
service men and women would knowingly fire on journalists and innocent
civilians.' " This might be the end of it, except that earlier you made
statements that sought to distinguish between "the US military" from
individual soldiers. This raises the possibility that you still believe
that the military high command is somehow seeking the deaths of
journaiists. Up to now, your efforts at clarification have merely
muddied the waters. I declare myself confused, and I'm not happy about
it. I want to be clear about where my union's president stands on this
issue. I therefore call upon you to state clearly and unambiguously
whether you believe that any branch of the US military or government has
adopted a deliberate policy of targeting journalists in war zones. This
is a simple question, easily answered. I can see no rational reason for
you to hesitate about answering it. At a time when the public's trust in
the integrity of journalism is at a new low, our profession can't afford
to encourage the perception that we're economical with the truth. I
trust you'll put aside your hesitation and immediately explain yourself
publicly, in a way that leaves no further doubt about your views on this
matter. Thanks for reading. I'm glad there are still a reporter's in the
MSM who can see through the bias and actually call out a fellow
journalist for her idiotic statement. I will make it a point to read
this reporter's column regularly. Check out the article the reporter is
referring to in E&amp;P, makes some great points: Newspaper Guild
President Linda Foley made a public statement on May 13 that journalists
are “being targeted for real in places like Iraq.” She has been trying
to slide out of it ever since. Pressed by E&amp;P’s Joe Strupp, Foley
offered a clarification on who specifically was doing the targeting: “I
was careful of not saying troops, I said U.S. military.” Everette
Dennis, a former dean of a journalism school and founder of the Gannett
Center for Media Studies, finds this a distinction without a difference.
“A military without troops is inconceivable,” he told me this week. “One
presupposes the other.” It is as logically impossible to separate the
troops from the military as it is egg whites from an omelet. ... Every
talking head rushed on air 24/7 to attack or defend what Jordan had
supposedly said, and forests of newsprint were devoted to pundantics on
the theme. And because no transcript was ever released, the entire
affair was conducted in an embarrassing blather of hearsay. Foley had
the advantage of seeing what happened to Jordan and, as the head of a
powerful union of 35,000 journalists and media workers, she knew
anything she said about targeting journalists would likely be
scrutinized. So one would expect that she has a pretty solid case for
her revival of the discredited Jordan charges? But one would be wrong.
Her spokesperson, Candice Johnson, told me Foley can provide “no
evidence” to support her charges either. ... To date, not a single
pundit, editorial writer, or newspaper ran anything, with the exception
of the Chicago Sun-Times story I wrote, a St. Paul Pioneer Press column
by Mark Yost, and a Washington Times column item. Clearly Foley was
correct in assuming the Right was the only danger to her repetition of
the statement that got Eason Jordan canned. The Mainstream Media
couldn’t be bothered to cover “Easongate: The Sequel.” And positioning
Foley as the gallant defender of the lives of journalists targeted by
the U.S. military was inspired PR. After all, Sherlock Holmes’s dog
didn’t bark because he was good friends with the thief. Foley decided to
improve the odds and issued another statement to me. In a further
clarification of her clarification, Foley insists that she “doesn't
believe that our service men and women would knowingly fire on
journalists and innocent civilians.” So follow the logic. It is the U.S.
military, not the troops, who targeted journalists. But if an occasional
service man or woman just might have fired a tank round or two into the
Palestine Hotel and killed some journalists, or dropped a bomb on Al
Jazeera’s studio in Baghdad using the coordinates from the U.S. military
(both cited in her letter to President Bush of April 8 th demanding an
investigation), they didn’t do it “knowingly.” ... If the most basic
tenets of Journalism 101 are now no longer important enough for the
media itself to honor and defend against their own members who violate
them, where is the professionalism and the authority that is our main
claim to writing the indispensable “first draft of history” – much less
its value for sale? And if we lose sight of that irretrievably, who
needs us? There are bloggers out there today with more credibility than
Dan Rather, Mary Mapes, Eason Jordan, and Linda Foley combined, and
their audiences are growing. If Foley is allowed to walk unchallenged
from what Mencken might have called “a clear, simple, and” unproven
statement, it will only accelerate the speed at which her members lose
what is left of their credibility--and then their jobs. (Look at The New
York Times newsroom downsizing this week.) If the press isn’t going to
take its own standards seriously, it is hard to think of why anyone
should take the press seriously enough to pay for it. In the meantime,
Rupert Murdoch’s and Roger Ailes’s success offers a constant unpleasant
reminder: the media market prefers dogs that bark. Check out Captain's
