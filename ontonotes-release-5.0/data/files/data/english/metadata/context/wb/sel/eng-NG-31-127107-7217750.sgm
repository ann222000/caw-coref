VHP/Hindu sangathans  must bring up some nice slogan like “dharma bachana hai rastra bachana hai . har hindu ko sukhi banana hai” and should really work on it. Then only there  is a possibility that lalu’s wife , mulayam’s wife , chandra babu’s wife  bansi lal chutal’s wife will vote for BJP during the national election  and BJP will be able to make full majority govt in the centre to cancel the nationality/ voting / property/  rights of the  foreign religions e.g  Muslims and Christians  as per the international norms. E.g like Hindus don’t hv any rights in so many countries where these  religions are in power same way they should never hv any rights in a Hindu country.

Also toady some seriously stupid TV boys from Sahara TV are taking her interview in car only by calling Merry Robert Vadhera  as Priyanka  Gandhi when she is not Priyanka and she is not Gandhi  after marrying with vadhera guy.
So these Sahara TV boys must be jailed for doing the nation gumrah on the identity of this woman. Some small organization should file a petition against these TV boys and TV as well supported by all Hindu organizations. .

Same way there is one ad in which a  boy says guruji mujhe satya ka gyan ho gya hai this is about a cold drink. Satya ka gyan is ishwar ka gyan. Not that  which cold drink quenches thirst is not satya ka gyan because this world is ‘a-stya’ only ishwar is satya.
So this ad maker and actors and TV should be jailed.

BHARAT Jiyega Yedhi  Bharat Ki Naari Jiyegi.
Aur BJP Naari Bachhao Andolan Chhalayega.

Bharat KI  Naari Jiyegai Yedhi Uska Bachha  Swasth Jiyega
Aur BJP Uskey Bachhe Ko swasth Rakhega

BHARAT Ubrega Yedi  Bhaart ka Baalak  Swasth Jiyega
Aur  BJP Swasth Balak Andolan Chaalayega
