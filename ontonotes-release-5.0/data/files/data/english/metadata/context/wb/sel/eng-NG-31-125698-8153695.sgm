President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Thursday explained achievements of his tour

He said that it was a turning point in strengthening bilateral ties with the
three nations.

Ahmadinejad said his visit to Afghanistan took place at the invitation of
his Afghan counterpart Hamid Karzai.

&quot;We held talks on regional situation and issues of mutual interests.&quot;
He said that Iran and Afghanistan have friendly relations and Iranian nation
has helped Afghan people to pass the hardship they suffered for several
decades.

The Iranian president also said that the two sides have signed four
memoranda of understanding (MoUs) in the fields of trade and economy, and
investments in mines, water, electricity and energy sectors as well as
bilateral cooperation on security affairs.

The Islamic Republic of Iran backs political process in Afghanistan to
restore tranquility and national sovereignty to the war-torn country, he
said, adding, &quot;We advise Afghan nation to try to reconstruct their country.&quot;

Ahmadinejad, welcoming his Turkmen counterpart's invitation, visited

Turning to the trade between Iran and Turkmenistan which stands at
dlrs 1.3billion, he said that the two countries inked new MoUs to
increase
cooperation in the fields of transportation, border trade, dam building as

Iran and Turkmenistan are to set up a joint committee on energy and gas
cooperation, Ahmadinejad noted, adding that Tehran will prepare MoUs to be
signed during the Turkmen president's upcoming tour to Iran to take part in
the summit of littoral states of the Caspian Sea.

On his trip to Kyrgyzstan to attend the seventh summit of the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Bishkek, the Iranian president said that
the summit has an effective role to boost economic cooperation in the region
and made a reference to security cooperation too.

He said that participation of Iran in the summit as an observer is
beneficial to the two parties (Iran and member states).

&quot;After taking part in the SCO summit and declaring the stance of the Islamic
Republic of Iran, I met with presidents of China, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and
Kazakhstan,&quot; he noted.

&quot;I held talks with Kyrgyz parliament speaker, finance minister and a number
of academics, underlining the need for expansion of bilateral ties and the
increase of scientific and cultural cooperation.&quot; Pointing to his meeting
with his Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of the SCO summit, he said
that Iran-China economic exchanges are increasing, and that the trade volume
of the two countries will hit dlrs 20 billion this year.

&quot;The Chinese president and I discussed on important political and
international issues, which lasted one hour,&quot; he added.

&quot;I have once more invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to participate in
the summit of littoral states of the Caspian Sea in Tehran.&quot;
Referring to the meeting with his Kazakh counterpart, he noted, &quot;We are to
expand bilateral relations to unlimited level and set up joint commission by
the end of this summer,&quot; adding that the MoUs between Iran and Kazakhstan
will be signed within the next trip of Kazakh president to Iran.
