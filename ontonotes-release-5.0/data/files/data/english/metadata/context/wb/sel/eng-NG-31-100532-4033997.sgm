Well I didn't realize there was any competition between the races to
build cars. Guess just A$$holes like yourself would have any knowledge about
that!

I tend to disagree. Amercian car manufacturers have the ability to build
great cars. Unfortunately their profit margins prevent them from doing so.

Ford makes good trucks, because they make huge profits on them. Their cars
however, are usually pieced together from excess junk left over the past 10
years.

If you want Ford, etc to make a great car, expect tp pay 35K+ for it.

The reason I stoped buying american is I was tired of $1500 dollar repairs
with only 34K miles, if the americans want to compete warranty 5 yrs or 60k.
Its bullshit to have and replace a p/s pump, intake gasket, master cylinder,
when the time part of the warranty is gone and only 34 k miles.

My Lumina had 39 K on it bought it new and reverse went out on the
transmisson. $2400!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Starters, alternators, computers, waterpumps all that should last 10 yrs or
80K.

Ford, Opel (GM), VW, Audi (VW), BMW, Mercedes (DaimlerChrysler) and
Porsche are making plenty of cars in Germany.

The UK still has Westfield, Caterham, Morgan and Bristol.  Pretty much
everything else - McLaren (40% DaimlerChrysler), Jaguar (Ford), Land
Rover (Ford), Nissan, Toyota, TVR (Russian), Peugeot, Honda, Mini
(BMW), Rolls-Royce (BMW), Bentley (VW), Aston Martin (Ford), Vauxhall
(GM) and Lotus (Proton) are foreign owned.  Not sure about Noble - I
think it's South African.  No doubt I've missed a few off.

Sweden is making SAAB (GM) and Volvo (Ford).

The Italians still have Fiat, Ferrari, Maserati (Ferrari), Lamborghini
(Audi), Alfa Romeo. Lancia(?), + ?.

The French managed to prop up their industry and still have 2 car
makers - PSA (Citroen/Peugeot) and Renault.

The Dutch are making cars.
The Spanish are making cars.
Most of the rest of Europe is making cars or bits for cars.

And if none of them are white men then no one in the USA is either.

I suppose that's why Nissan make a third a a million cars a year in
Sunderland, and Rover has gone bankrupt.   Nothing to do with
reliability?

The largest autogroup is GM, then Toyota, then others... in any case,
Renault is the crap of the earth, also I dont like French for their behavior
during WWI and since.  if you want a frog car, go to another newsgroup.

PS Ford does own MANY MANY Euro/Japanese makers, eg Volvo, RollsRoyce,
Jaguar, Mazda, etc, etc.

I agree, a constant battle to see who can build the best car can only
benefit the customer.   Something I don't understand is why G.M. is
called Vauxhall, here in England, Opel in Europe and Chevrolet in Egypt.

Nope, according to Forbes.com's ranking of the largest 2000 companies in the world, Toyota Motor is ranked no. 10, while GM is no. 65! http://www.forbes.com/2005/03/30/05f2000land.html

It will be news the BMW - they have the rights to make cars under the
Rolls-Royce name, cost BMW about £40m.  Nice new undergound factory at
Goodwood, bodyshells are made in Germany and shipped over for
assembly.  It will be news to Rolls-Royce Aerospace they own the name
and license BMW to use it on cars.  R-R Aerospace has a seat on board
of R-R Motors to make sure the Name doesn't get abused on tacky trash.

Means they can charge what the market will stand without making it too
obvious (UK = "Treasure Island" in car maker speak).  The local
Vauxhall dealer put up signs on one end of the showroom for Daewoo
last year, this year the Chevy signs have gone up on the other end.
Holden V8 coupe is being sold as Vauxhall VXR coupe, it's a Pontiac
GTO in the USA.  UK it cost's over £35,000 UK Pounds sterling, it
doesn't cost $35,000 in US dollars (about £20,000UKP) and the Aus
dollar equivalent to £25000 in Australia as a Holden.  No doubt they
claim the UK car has more options fitted as standard but they will
refuse to fit and deny existance of high spec options available in
other markets.

GM have 11 brands.  They put each other down, compete with each other
but most sell cars made or based on platforms produced by other parts
of the group.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

But not merged.  Renault hold a large stake in Nissan shares (bit over
40% I think) and Nissan hold shares in Renault (about 20% I think).

Nissan Micra and Renault Clio are made on same platform.
The VQ35 engine used in so many Nissans was used in the Renault Vel
Satis.

What is the point here?  Carlos Ghosn is running Nissan and he is from
Renault and at last look that was a French company.  So, what is the
point of the argument.  Nissan was going down the tubes and it took
Renault to bail them out and reorganize the company.  Also, the Altima
is made in the United States.  The 350Z I have was designed in
California so we are looking at a global company...

&gt; c'mon buddy...

&gt; The Big 3 (2.5?) would like to have you think that, it would take focus off
&gt; the real problem. But the truth of it is that upper management in Detroit
&gt; (especially at GM) is so out of touch with what people want you'd almost
&gt; think they were trying to take down their own companies. If you want some
&gt; insight into their problems take a look at Dan Neil's op-ed article.

The world has gone global but the domestic US car industry stuck it's
head in the sand.  Helped a lot by the US motorsport.  Things like as
soon as an "import" motor wins a drag race they introduce an "import"
class and protect the antique domestic product from competition.
People turn up and see a Chevy win it's class but look the other way
or go get a hot dog while the 3-4 cars "import" class runs faster
times.

">

As a previous Ford guy who bought his first import (Infiniti G35), I'd say
the first thing Ford and GM need to do is make compelling vehicles.

We use GM as fleet cars where I work and all are POS's that are pretty much
done by 25k.  Be it the interior that falls apart, brakes that are warped,
engines and trans' that are already fatiguing, you name it.  Junk cars.

Look at the GTO - $35k for a friggin Pontiac that looks like every other
Pontiac?  No wonder they are not selling.

Then we have the Chevy/Saturn/Buick/Pontiac minivans that scream "COOKIE
CUTTER".  Not to mention they look like the previous Venture/Montana POS
Minivans that GM put out.  Could they spare $5 for a door handle redesign?

Looking at Ford, they appear to be headed in the right direction but God,
their cars are uncompelling.  Look at the 500 - decent car, but BLANDSVILLE.
And the performance?  0-60 in 8 or 9 seconds.  You would have thought with
an "all new" car they could have at least pepped up the Duratec 3.0 or
something.  It's not a bad engine, but destined for an overhaul (variable
valve timing or something).  Then there's the inside of the 500.  Nice
enough, but it inspires no emotion.  Every review of the 500 says "nice
enough, but no power but it has a big trunk"

The Freestyle is nice enough, but could they spare the power in that thing?

The Mustang looks great, but I wonder about the engines in it - the 4.0 SOHC
that started life in the Explorer has not been their best engine.  The 4.6
is nice, but OUCH on the price for the GT.  There's so much better out there
for $30-32k than the Mustang (it's what led me to the G).

Not really feeling the "freshened" Focus.  That was the car that could have
been.  It had it all - great looks, sporty personality, but it was plagued
by initial quality.

Ford needs to bring back cars that people want, cars that stir emotion.  I
remember the Taurus SHO.  It was a car that people wanted, a car that took
your boring family hauler and turned it into something fun to drive.

I remember the Escort GT - decently performing econobox that was a fun to
drive.

The Contour SVT - a car that handled and performed like a low end BMW.
Another great car to own and drive.

Even the late model Cougar - it was a sharp looking car that was marketed
poorly - should have been a Ford - people under 50 don't like to say they
drive a Mercury.  But, I hear it was fun to drive.

Cars people want to own is one area the imports have it all over the
Americans.  People are scooping up 300Z's, RX8's, Mazda 6's, Miatas,
Maximas, Tiburons, etc.  Those are cars that instill passion, not boring
cars.  You want boring you can get a Toyota (BLANDSVILLE), Honda
(BLANDSVILLE), etc.

Heck, I bought my G35 because it instilled passion -  a 4 door 350Z with a 6
speed and all the toys.  None of the Americans builds a car like this - the
last was the Contour (or the Taurus MT5, but it was a wimpy 4-banger) and it
died a long time ago.  I didn't want an Accord (Snoozeville), the Maxima was
in the running, but I much prefer RWD.

So far, after 1.5 years I'm loving it - fast, maintenance free, and puts a
smile on my face whenever I drive it.  I couldn't say the same about a
Malibu, G6, 500, 300, etc.

The problem with the Americans is they forgot how to build cars that instill
PASSION.  They are building BLANDMOBILES.

Build it and we will come back.
