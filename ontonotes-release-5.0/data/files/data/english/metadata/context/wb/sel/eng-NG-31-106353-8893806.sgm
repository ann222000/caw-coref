Hello, everyone.

Next week my daughter is going to have English speech competion whose
topic is &quot;After 20 years , I am ... &quot;.

My daughter gave me her writing in Korean and I translated it into
English.

I think I made lots of mistakes in my english writting.

If someone who is a native speaker correct me, I will really
appreciate it.

Follows are my dauter's writting and I transtated it in English.

======================================================================

Hello, everyone.
My name is Juhye Lee
I'm in class one of the third grade at Wasuck Elementary School.
What am I going to look like in 20 years? Â I have been thinking about
my future a lot.
I will be going to school every day as I am doing now, because I want
to be an elementary school teacher.
Do you know &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; ?

I read this book when I was in the first grade.

This book is really interesting for me.
Lovely and cut Anne becomes the teacher in her hometown, doesn't she?
Reading the book, I'd like to be a good teacher like Anne.

I want to be a teacher like this.
First of all, I am going to play with my children at P.E class and
Music class.
I hope my children have a good time during my class and even if
someone who is bullied can be one with a classmate.

Second, I want to be a teacher who implants self-confidence in my
children.
I'd like to be a good teacher who will give dreams and hopes even
though it is important how to teach them well in studying.

Third, I want to be a warm-hearted teacher who can share their
happiness and sorrows.

Sure, I know Anne was a typical honor student and I have to study hard
in order to make my dreams come true.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From now on, I will do my best and become a teacher who desperately
">

needed to children, give children happiness and love children
sincerely.

Thank you for listening to my speech about my future.

Thanks in advance.
