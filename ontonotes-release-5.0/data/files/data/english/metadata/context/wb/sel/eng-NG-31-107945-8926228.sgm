Greetings,

This may get many comments, but I'm curious as to the consensus.

On a recent training flight (wasn't me...) the student was advised to go
to about 2/3 spoiler just before the flare.

Normal approach, field was made, on target for a nice touchdown.

When I was getting instruction, I was always encouraged to progress
toward full spoiler in the pattern and to ideally get to a full spoiler
and stabilized approach once the target touchdown point was &quot;in range&quot;.
Advice given was that full spoilers minimized the potential for
ballooning and provided maximum drag and minimized lift.  i.e. get on
the ground and stay there and make a positive effect to get the glider
stopped.  Additionally, I've always been of the mind set that unless
there was an unusual circumstance, that spoiler changes near the ground
were usually best avoided.

Any other thinking as to a benefit in reducing spoiler just before the
flare?

Just pondering...

Gary

a) Some gliders (not the Duo 8^) cause sufficient sink rate at full
extension to make for a rather firm arrival if not reduced.

b) Some gliders actuate the wheel brakes at full extension, and some
instructors are known to get overly concerned about generating a screech
and a nice puff of smoke.

I was not taught (nor did I teach) any such thing.  First of all, spoiler use
is type-specific.  If you have a glider with very effective spoilers, you are
less likely to need them full on.  If you are flying something with wimpy
spoilers, you might routinely fly your whole final to touchdown with them full
on.

I was taught that the theoretical &quot;ideal&quot;, perfectly-planned and executed
pattern would have about 50% spoilers throughout the full pattern.  If you are
at 50%, then you have maximum authority to either increase or decrease your
glide angle as conditions warrant.

I've heard this before, and wondered about why it's &quot;ideal&quot; to have
spoilers open during the downwind and base leg. What was the reason your
instructors gave you?

I've always flown - and taught - the downwind and base legs with the
gear down, spoilers closed. This way, my turns to base and final are as
high as possible, and the final is longer, giving me more time to
stabilize it, to make corrections (especially big ones), and inspect the
landing area.

I agree with this technique, and it is what I strive for on final. I do
use somewhat less spoiler if the glider has a strong landing flaps (ASW
20, e.g.), or responds significantly to just cracking the spoilers.

One principle not commonly taught, but worth understanding, is that
spoilers
do somewhat different things  in parts of the pattern.
I teach the use of approximately 1/2 spoiler from a point abeam the
touchdown.
This uses &quot;safety altitude up at a rate proportional to distance left
to touchdown
thus providing a fairly constant rate of descent and pretty much
constant height
margin.
This assumes steady airspeed selected for conditions.
Adjust spoilers moderately for changes in angles to the touch down
point.
On final, the effect of spoilers changes.
In the early part of final , they are rate(and angle at constant
speed) of descent
control.
As we transition into the flare and touchdown phase the spoilers
become rate of
deceleration control thus determining when the glider no longer has
enough speed to fly.
Teaching this principle of leaving the spoilers alone(unless sink or
other factor dictate) allows a smooth transition into the flare
without losing the drag needed to land at the target.
This method leads to pilots who can land at low energy with minimal
extra float.
It also means that only the pitch control hand needs to do something
which is much easier
for students to master.
Some try to &quot;improve on what we teach&quot; thinking less spoiler near the
ground will give slower sink
and smoother landings. After bouncing around in ground affect and
landing poorly and
long, they come back to what they are taught

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the start, I teach that last part of final, if possible, is with

full  spoilers  to get pilots used
to steep final like is needed landing in a field . This way they will
revert to habits that work well
during their first &quot;stressful&quot; outlanding.
Hope this was not too &quot;windy&quot;.

How do you use the landing flaps on something like an ASW 20 or 27? Use
them only on final? Save them for situations where spoilers aren't enough?

Probably a better idea to teach that they are used
as required, rather than automatically opening them
at a fixed positon irrespective of height.  Doing this
could end in tears.

Very interesting - I guess you are flying a very tight apporach
pattern, starting very high on downwind, right?

I'm just wonderung, because if we'd do this with the ASK-21 in the
traffic pattern at my home airfield (height at downwind about 650 ft
above ground), we wouldn't even reach the airfield.

I've noticed that Americans tend to refer to airbrakes as spoilers. I
wonder if this is because most (all?) Schweitzer iron is fitted with
spoilers rather than Schlemp-Hirth air brakes. Most Americans seem to
have learnt in the SGS 2/33.

Personally, the only spoiler-equipped gliders I've flown are our
Slingsby T-21b and an SGS 2/33. The spoilers on both are memorably
ineffective.

You are quite right on all counts, particularly if
you include the 2-22 and the TG-3.

But we know the difference, and we also know that originally
the DFS divebrakes were speed limiting vertically before
the standards were changed.

You'll probably have to get used to it.  Language changes;
we must all choose our particular upsets over this
fact.

Hmm, I was taught:
Schemmp-Hirth style glide path control devices are spoilers (kill the
lift, make drag by sticking into the wind and requiring greater induced
drag through higher aoa).  Spoilers increase stall speed.
The trailing edge thingees on my old Ventus and Mosquito are dive
brakes.  They don't affect lift or stall speed much.
The things on 2-33s remind the student it's time to begin a slip ;-)

wing and looks much more like an S-H brake.

Thanks for the confirmation about the other Schweitzer gliders.

Actually, the TG-3 and the 2-22 had top only spoilers hinged at the front
and closed with a spring.  You had to overcome aerodynamic and spring force
to hold them open.  I have several hundred hours in a TG-3.  You can see
there were no lower surface spoilers on this picture.

http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Schweizer_TG-3A_USAF.jpg

Although the 2-22 was a dog, the TG-3 was a reasonably good soaring machine
at about 26:1.  The best feature of the TG-3, for the instructor, was the
sliding rear canopy.  The worst was the extremely heavy ailerons - most
pilots flew it with both hands on the stick.

There were serious proposals that the 2-22 replacement should have been an
updated TG-3 with lighter metal wings and tail surfaces instead of the
original wood.  It would have needed lighter ailerons too.  If such a
machine had been produced, it would have been much better than the 2-33.
Note that the TG-3 predates the 2-33 by more than 20 years.

AFIK, the only US made 2-seat glider of this era to have S-H type dive
brakes was the Pratt-Read.

There is one TG-3 left flying, N60434, S/N 88.  It
belongs to a fellow in Tennessee, I believe, Ron Naylor.
This glider never saw military duty and was bought
still in the crate by some folks at Harris Hill, who
sold it to the Tar Heel Soaring Club in Burlington,
NC back around 1960.  It is the glider I learned on
after soloing SG-38s with the Belgians, and the glider
I did my Silver badge in, and did some instruction
in -- back when there was no CFI-G and commercial glider
pilots could instruct. (I got grandfathered and people
still ask why.)

&gt;at about 26:1.  The best feature of the TG-3, for the
&gt;instructor, was the
&gt;sliding rear canopy.  The worst was the extremely heavy
&gt;ailerons - most
&gt;pilots flew it with both hands on the stick.

&gt;There were serious proposals that the 2-22 replacement
&gt;should have been an
&gt;updated TG-3 with lighter metal wings and tail surfaces
&gt;instead of the
&gt;original wood.  It would have needed lighter ailerons
&gt;too.  If such a
&gt;machine had been produced, it would have been much
&gt;better than the 2-33.
&gt;Note that the TG-3 predates the 2-33 by more than 20
&gt;years.

&gt;AFIK, the only US made 2-seat glider of this era to
&gt;have S-H type dive
&gt;brakes was the Pratt-Read.

&gt; &gt;One principle not commonly taught, but worth understanding, is that

&gt; &gt;I teach the use of approximately 1/2 spoiler from a point abeam the

&gt; Very interesting - I guess you are flying a very tight apporach
&gt; pattern, starting very high on downwind, right?

&gt; I'm just wonderung, because if we'd do this with the ASK-21 in the
&gt; traffic pattern at my home airfield (height at downwind about 650 ft
&gt; above ground), we wouldn't even reach the airfield.

LIkely we are teaching a steeper approach profile than you are.
This is because we want pilots used to a fairly step approch on final
to allow shortest landing in a field. It is also easier to judge a
steeper angle.
Pls take the 1/2 spoilers(airbrakes whatever) with a bit of a grain of
salt.
The point is to establish a rate of descent on the order of about
500ft/min
and adjust from there.
