Nothing gets media attention like political infighting.

Let's say Hillary is on the floor of the Senate one day contemplating her
uphill battle to the White House. She sees her colleague Senator Obama and
the plan begins to form in her mind. She approaches him with an offer to
make him President of the United States. She did it for Bill, she can do it
for him.

This is the plan they devise:
1. He agrees to be her running mate for the 2008 election.
2. He announces his candidacy for President.
3. They begin a slightly negative political war that draws all attention to
the two of them and away from all other Democratic challengers.
4. Obama uses the Clinton negatives to build a large campaign fund.
5. Hillary uses the Bush negatives, and perhaps some racist negatives, to
build her campaign fund.
6. The campaigns will battle in secret collusion, producing plenty of free
publicity without any real damage to either side.
7. With the other candidates marginalized the two of them will glide through
most of the primaries with plenty of money ready to do real damage in the
general election.

Although Hillary probably believes she will emerge the marginal winner in
the primaries (which are usually decided in states less favorable to Senator
Obama) I don't think she cares if she ends up the VP on the ticket. Either
way she will have the power she needs to do the things she wants to do
domestically.

Senator Obama is young and will likely be happy to second chair for 8 years
while he builds the experience necessary to be the most powerful man in the
world. If he emerges the front runner, he will owe that position to Senator
Clinton.

If anywhere near the truth, it is politically brilliant. Almost as brilliant
as sending Pat Buchanan to destroy the Reform Party...

The corp. boss media love a negative campaign if it gets the public
discussion off of economic issues like health care, wages, etc.

But a negative campaign isn't much of an issue either way with voters
_as long as the candidates also adequately cover economic issues_.

There is a potential danger to both in that scenario.  The Convention
may be so deadlocked as to go into a second ballot; at which point all
delegates are released to vote as they choose; meaning that anything
can happen.

Up here in Canada, the Liberals just went through a similar, nastily
negative campaign involving the front-runners, Michael Ignatieff and
Bob Rae, culminating in a 4-ballot convention.  The results confounded
most expectations; the delegates rejected both frontrunners, in favor
of 4th-place Stephane Dion (with his Green campaign) as a unity
candidate.

A similar thing could happen if your scenario goes through.  In that
case, I'd say:  look forward to the Second Coming of the Goracle.
