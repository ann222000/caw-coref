Probate questions regarding omitted spouse

My mom is in the middle of an ugly probate case and I was wondering if
anyone out there has knowledge of this.  First off, I should state that
this takes place in California.

Anyways, about a year ago, my mom's husband passed away after they had
been married for only a year.  He had not updated his trust, so the
property was passed down to his children.  Yet by the omitted spouse
clause, I believe that my mom was entitled to 1/3 or half the estate.
Now right after he had passed away, his children basically kicked my
mom out of the house and wouldn't give her any of the possessions that
they had bought together.

Now they are claiming that my mom and her husband had always agreed
that they would keep things separate and that if he were to die then
his kids would get the house.  This was never written down but they
have witnesses to claim to have heard them say this (including police
officers).  My mom claims that she agreed that she was going to let the
children have the house, but not the entire estate (which is worth a
lot more).  The children are saying in their proposal that they will
give my mom half of the possessions bought while they were married and
90% of the debt that was incrued (a lot of it is from traveling).  I'm
not sure how they can justify that 90% though.  They are claiming that
it's because my mom made him travel a lot for vacations, but the way I
see it is that it's his money and his decision.

So do his children have a leg to stand on?  Nothing was written down
about not giving my mom any of the estate, so isn't some of that
automatically given to her under the omitted spouse clause?

Thanks for any help!

I am not familiar with CA law.   After snipping the details of this
nasty family dispute, let's move on to:

The first thing your mom should do, I mean literally before having her
coffee this morning (I guess she should get dressed first), is GET A
LAWYER to represent HER interests in this dispute.   I'm assuming she
doesn't have one yet or you wouldn't be asking these questions here.
If there is a lawyer handling the estate, he is not HER lawyer.   She
needs someone knowledgeable to advocate for HER rights in this
situation, and that means she must hire him herself.   Since nothing
positive is likely to happen (that wouldn't happen anyway) unless she
takes this step, it's time to get going on it.   Good luck,

That's right.  See California Probate Code §21610.

Even if they had agreed to keep their property separate, that wouldn't
change a thing.  Only if if your mother had actually waived any right
to share in the estate would anything change.

She's entitled to half the community property and (assuming two or more
children) one-third of the rest of the estate, including the house.
She doesn't have to take the house, only her share of its value.  But
she is entitled to her share of the whole thing.

[Mom's husband died, leaving a trust that hadn't been updated after he
married her.  Children are claiming Mom should get a lot less of the
estate than OP thinks she should.]

When it comes to wills and trusts, if it's not in writing -- and
properly witnessed -- it doesn't exist.

Your mom needs a lawyer.  Trying to do this herself in something as
complicated as probate is just asking for grief.  Your post implies
that there is a lot of money at stake here, so a few hundred $ to see
an attorney is money _very_ well spent.

Simplistic analysis:

California is a community property state.  That means that half of
anything the husband earned during the marriage is _automatically_
hers.  In addition, if he mingled his money with hers after the
marriage, there's a good chance that it is _all_ community property.

In addition, there's an assumption that you intend to provide for your
spouse.  If you make a will after marriage, you can exclude your
spouse (*except* for community property), but if you fail to amend
your will (or trust) when you get married, the law makes default
provisions.  From the California Probate Code, section 21610, that
would be *all* of the community property and quasi-community property
(not just half of it), *plus* half of her husbands's separate
property.

As for the debts, those are probably community too.  I think that means
they would be assessed against the community property first.  If there
isn't enough community and quasi-community proprty, she would have to
pay half and the other half would be assessed against his separate
property.  But if the debts are entirely in his name, there is a good
chance they would be subtracted from his separate property, *not* the
community property.  It is certainly *not* the case that she should
pay 100% of the debts, as the children are proposing.

I would say that Mom is in a fairly strong bargaining position -- if
she insists on everything the law allows she would get all the
community property plus half of the rest -- including the house.  I
will assume she just wants half of the estate _excluding_ the house,
and I think with the aid of a lawyer she should be able to negotiate
that result.  But she should *not* try to do this on her own.

Her best bet is to ask her personal attorney -- the one who handles
routine matters like wills -- to recommend a specialist in
probate law.  If she doesn't have a personal attorney, ask your friends,
relatives, and co-workers to ask their attorney for such a
recommendation.  If several come back with the same name, call that
one first.

If all else fails, ask your county Bar Association for their referral
list, or look in the yellow pages.  But a referral from somebody you
trust is better than relying on a YP ad, and the Bar Association just
lists every lawyer who _says_ he/she works in that speciality.

Call up and ask for an appointment.  Ask how much he will charge
for the initial consulation.  When she has described the situation to
him, she can ask how much he will charge to handle the case.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

I'm not a CA lawyer, so just a couple of quick thoughts.  First, you say
there is a probate case, but talk about  a trust.  "Probate" is the
court process to distribute property according to a "will, not a
"trust."  It is an important distinction because the rules are likely
very different.

For example, in Oregon, there is a statute that says that a Will is
revoked by a subsequent marriage.  Not so with a trust.  If there is a
similar CA statute, then you really want to know . . . Right?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So do his children have a leg to stand on?
">

I hope you are asking because your mom has a lawyer and you are trying
to find out some info for your self.  If not, if mom does not have a
lawyer, then it does not matter whether the kids are right, she will lose.

Part of the reason is that both probate and trust laws are set up in a
way that makes it relatively easy to resolve many cases where there are
ambiguous facts.  The system acts as a "filter".  The estate's lawyer
reaches an opinion as to the way it should come out.  They tell all the
affected people, and if there is no objection in proper form, then
that's the way it is.  My guess (and it's only a guess) is that you are
asking now, because you have such a notice and the clock is ticking on a
response.

If I am right, and there is serious money at stake, then step away from
the computer and take Mom to a real live lawyer . . . NOW!

You're right about the community property.  I said half, but that's a
mistake.  A spouse can, in a will, give half of the community property
to someone other than the other spouse.  But if there's no will the
other spouse gets it all.

If there are two or more kids the surviving spouse gets one-third of
the separate property, not half.  See Cal. Probate Code §6401.
