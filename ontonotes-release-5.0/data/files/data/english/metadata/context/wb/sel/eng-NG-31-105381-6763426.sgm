Jon Peter is busy this month.  Like a bee.  A bee on crack flowers.

TV appearances a-plenty.  Jon was on the Mike & Juliet show on Fox
Network on April 11th. He is doing multiple TV and Radio appearances.
Everyone wants to pick Jon's brain on this year's American Idol.  Even
Geraldo interviewed him on April 1st with one question on his mind.
Here's a short transcript from the interview.*

Geraldo:  Jon, answer me one thing about American Idol?  Where's the
mustaches?

Jon:  I'm sorry.  What do you mean?

Geraldo:  Why is no one rocking a lip-warmer? A mouth-brow?  A sleepy
chipmunk?

Jon: Mr. Riviera--

Geraldo: Call me Mustache.

Jon: Um, Mustache, maybe because it's not the 70's.

Geraldo: What about Simon?  Put a handlebar on that guy.  He could
twist it, villain-style, as he drops those crushing comments.  Lot of
uses, those fur brushes.

SHOWS, you ask?  If you're in the vicinity of Albuquerque on April 15,
there's an all ages show at the Launchpad.  And for those near Los
Angeles head over to BB Kings on May 4th.  Idaho residents, JPL will
be playing with Paula Deanda in Idaho Falls on May 26th.  You can buy
tickets for that at http://www.vspconcerts.com/ .  If there's a
location you'd like Jon to come play next, drop him an email!

What else, what else? If you haven't read Jon's blog on AOL, get
there:
http://www.tvsquad.com/bloggers/jon-peter-lewis
It's one of the most read blogs about the current American Idol race.
Also, if you aren't near any of those concerts check out Jon playing
on "Idol Extra" on April 18th.  He'll be playing unplugged.  Check
your local listings for times.

More?  Yes, there's more!  Go read People.  There's a great shot of
Jon-- in a bathtub.  Also, you can hear Jon's single, "If I Go Away"
on the radio.  If you're not hearing it, call them up.  Request it!

Check out the website in the next few days, too ( http://jonpeterlewis.com
).  It's going to be all-new.  And if you don't have Jon's album yet,
you can even get it on the American Idol website.  Jon wishes you an
awesome April. It's National Poetry Month!  Go read some verse,
dudes!

April Showers,
