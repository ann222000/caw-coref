The requirements for countries to buy US dollars increases whenever the price of oilgoes up (and the price of imported goods goes up). About $60 million barrels of oildaily have to be paid with US$, i.e. $6 billion daily @100/barrel or close to $2.2trillion annually. Since much of these US$ never get to be spent in the US and arerecycled into US Treasury Bills under threat of US military intervention, the Bankstersget to create US$ from nothing and actually get real goods and services in return whilethe rest of the World gets to hold US Treasury Bills. http://www.currencytrading.net/2007/7-countries-considering-abandonin... Jessica HuppIt’s no secret that the dollar is on a downward spiral. Its value is dropping, and theFed isn’t doing a whole lot to change that. As a result, a number of countries areconsidering a shift away from the dollar to preserve their assets. These are seven ofthe countries currently considering a move from the dollar, and how they’ll have aneffect on its value and the US economy.1. Saudi Arabia: The Telegraph reports&lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml;jsessionid=BYRFMD0QYRQTVQ... &gt; that for the first time, Saudi Arabia hasrefused to cut interest rates along with the US Federal Reserve. This is seen as asignal that a break from the dollar currency peg is imminent. The kingdom is taking“appropriate measures” to protect itself from letting the dollar cause problems fortheir own economy. They’re concerned about the threat of inflation and don’t want todeal with “recessionary conditions” in the US. Hans Redeker of BNP Paribas believes&lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml;jsessionid=BYRFMD0QYRQTVQ... &gt; this creates a “very dangerous situation forthe dollar,” as Saudi Arabia alone has management of $800 billion. Experts fear that abreak from the dollar in Saudi Arabia could set off a “stampede” from the dollar in theMiddle East, a region that manages $3,500 billion. 2. South Korea: In 2005, Korea announced&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45703-2005Feb22.html &gt; its intention toshift its investments to currencies of countries other than the US. Although they’resimply making plans to diversify for the future, that doesn’t mean a large dollar dropisn’t in the works. There are whispers&lt; http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid;=aR5NGOMkBJ9M&amp;refe...; &gt; that theBank of Korea is planning on selling $1 billion US bonds in the near future, after a$100 million sale this past August. 3. China: After already dropping the dollar&lt; http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4703477.stm &gt; peg in 2005, China has more troubleup its sleeve. Currently, China is threatening&lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml;jsessionid=GJCLXDYE1U4SNQ... &gt; a “nuclear option” of huge dollar liquidationin response to possible trade sanctions intended to force a yuan revaluation. AlthoughChina “doesn’t want any undesirable phenomenon in the global financial order,” theirlarge sum of US dollars does serve as a “bargaining chip.” As we’ve noted in the past&lt; http://www.currencytrading.net/2007/how-china-could-crash-the-us-doll... &gt; ,China has the power to take the wind out of the dollar. 4. Venezuela: Venezuela holds little loyalty to the dollar. In fact, they’ve shownovert disapproval, choosing to establish barter deals&lt; http://www.feasta.org/documents/papers/oil1.htm &gt; for oil. These barter deals,established under Hugo Chavez, allow Venezuela to trade oil with 12 Latin Americancountries and Cuba without using the dollar, shorting the US its usual subsidy. Chavezis not shy about this decision, and has publicly encouraged others to adopt similararrangements. In 2000, Chavez recommended&lt; http://www.feasta.org/documents/papers/oil1.htm &gt; to OPEC that they “take advantage ofhigh-tech electronic barter and bi-lateral exchanges of its oil with its developingcountry customers,” or in other words, stop using the dollar, or even the euro, for oiltransactions. In September, Chavez instructed&lt; http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;refer;=latin_america&amp;s...; &gt;Venezuela’s state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA to change its dollar investmentsto euros and other currencies in order to mitigate risk. 5. Sudan: Sudan is, once again, planning&lt; http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article23958 &gt; to convert its dollar holdings tothe euro and other currencies. Additionally, they’ve recommended to commercial banks,government departments, and private businesses to do the same. In 1997, the Central Bankof Sudan made a similar recommendation in reaction to US sactions from former PresidentClinton, but the implementation failed. This time around, 31 Sudanese companies havebecome subject to sanctions, preventing them from doing trade or financial transactionswith the US. Officially, the sanctions are reported&lt; http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article23958 &gt; to have little effect, but thereare indications that the economy is suffering due to these restrictions. A decision tomove Sudan away from the dollar is intended to allow the country to work around thesesanctions as well as any implemented in the future. However, a Khartoum committeerecently concluded &lt; http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article23958 &gt; that proposalsfor a reduced dependence on the dollar are “not feasible.” Regardless, it is clear thatSudan’s intent is to attempt a break from the dollar in the future. 6. Iran: Iran is perhaps the most likely candidate for an imminent abandonment ofthe dollar. Recently, Iran requested&lt; http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;refer;=latin_america&amp;s...; &gt;that its shipments to Japan be traded for yen instead of dollars. Further, Iran hasplans in the works to create an open commodity exchange&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Oil_Bourse &gt; called the Iran Oil Bourse. Thisexchange would make it possible to trade oil and gas in non-dollar currencies, the euroin particular. Athough the oil bourse has missed at least three of its announced openingdates, it serves to make clear Iran’s intentions for the dollar. As of October 2007,Iran receives non-dollar currencies for 85% of its oil exports, and has plans to movethe remaining 15% to currencies like the United Arab Emirates dirham. 7. Russia: Iran is not alone in its desire to establish an alternative to tradingoil and other commodities in dollars. In 2006, Russian President Vladmir Putin expressed&lt; http://news.goldseek.com/GoldForecaster/1147791900.php &gt; interest in establishing aRussian stock exchange which would allow “oil, gas, and other goods to be paid for inRoubles.” Russia’s intentions are no secret–in the past, they’ve made it clear thatthey’re wary of holding too many dollar reserves. In 2004, Russian central bank FirstDeputy Chairmain Alexei Ulyukayev remarked&lt; http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_49/b3911032_mz011.htm &gt; , “Most of ourreserves are in dollars, and that’s a cause for concern.” He went on to explain that,after considering the dollar’s rate against the euro, Russia is “discussing thepossibility of changing the reserve structure.” Then in 2005, Russia put an end to itsdollar peg, opting instead to move towards a euro alignment. They’ve discussed&lt; http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cb1cd3e0-771b-11d9-b897-00000e2511c8.html?n... &gt;pricing oil in euros, a move that could provide a large shift away from the dollar andtowards the euro, as Russia is the world’s second-largest oil exporter. What does this all mean?Countries are growing weary of losing money on the falling dollar. Many of them want toprotect their financial interests, and a number of them want to end the US oversightthat comes with using the dollar. Although it’s not clear how many of these countrieswill actually follow through on an abandonment of the dollar, it is clear that itsstatus as a world currency is in trouble.Obviously, an abandonment of the dollar is bad news for the currency. Simply put, asdemand lessens, its value drops. Additionally, the revenue generated from the use of thedollar will be sorely missed if it’s lost. The dollar’s status as a cheaply-produced USexport is a vital part of our economy. Losing this status could rock the financial livesof both Americans and the worldwide economy.Enjoy this post?

After reaching parity with the Canadiandollar and the offloading of US Treasuries from Asian countries, things just aren’tlooking good. Find out what financial experts have to say about the dollar’s future.1. Paul&lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/10/18/bcn... &gt;Robinson, Barclays: “We expect it to get quite a bit weaker.”The Telegraph reports&lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/10/18/bcn... &gt; ,“Barclays expect the Fed to cut rates by another quarter point to 5pc in a move thatfurther erode one of the dollar’s key props.” Paul Robinson, strategist for Barclays,explains, “We’re dollar bears. The dollar is coming up for an important few weeks. Weexpect it to get quite a bit weaker.” They believe that it’s possible the dollar couldfall to $1.50 on the euro.2. Thomas&lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/10/18/bcn... &gt;Stopler, Goldman Sachs: “The data suggests there will be a weaker dollar.”Thomas Stopler, economist for Goldman Sachs, predicts a troublesome future for thedollar. Based on the negative capital-flows situation, he interprets data to mean that“there will be a weaker dollar.” 3. Marc&lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml;jsessionid=ZWCSSAQ1GUVDFQ... &gt; Ostwald, Insinger de Beaufort: “Woe betide USTreasuries if inflation does not remain benign.”According to a report&lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml;jsessionid=ZWCSSAQ1GUVDFQ... &gt; from The Telegraph, “data from the US Treasuryshowed outflows of $163bn (£80bn) from all forms of US investments.” Mac Ostwald ofInsinger de Beaufort finds these numbers “absolutely stunning,” and warns that inflationcould make things even worse for the dollar: “”Woe betide US Treasuries if inflationdoes not remain benign.” $52 billion worth of the treasuries in the outflow are fromAsian investors, including Japan, China&lt; http://www.currencytrading.net/2007/how-china-could-crash-the-us-doll... &gt; ,and Taiwan.4. Ian&lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml;jsessionid=ZWCSSAQ1GUVDFQ... &gt; Stannard, Paribas: Data is “extremelynegative.”According to Ian Stannard of Paribas, things aren’t looking good for the dollar, as “itis not just foreigners who are selling US assets. Americans are turning their back aswell.” He believes that this situation “exceeds the worst fears,” and ultimately, thedata is “extremely negative” for the dollar.5. Rodrigo&lt; http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/240780/EXTRA_US_dollar_overvalu... &gt; deRato, IMF: “The dollar remains overvalued.”Although the dollar has fallen quite a bit already, International Monetary Fund chiefRodrigo de Rato asserts that it’s still “overvalued relative to medium-termfundamentals.” Digital Journal reports&lt; http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/240780/EXTRA_US_dollar_overvalu... &gt; thatthe IMF hinted “the dollar may be headed for further decline,” with the US tradedeficit, slow-growing economy, and cut in interest rates to blame.6. Jerome Booth, Ashmore Group: “The dollar will keep falling in the near term nomatter what.”Jerome Booth isn’t optimistic for the dollar, either. He believes that it’s just not agood investment vehicle: “It’s a question of returns, and returns in dollar-denominatedassets are simply very low when compared with other regions.” Because of this, hisprediction is grim, asserting that “the dollar will keep falling in the near term nomatter what.”7. Nick&lt; http://investing.reuters.co.uk/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=allBre... &gt; Bennenbroek, Wells Fargo Bank: Recent“strength in the greenback is corrective.”In a note to clients, Wells Fargo currency strategist Nick Bennenbroek asserts thatthere’s still room for a greater dollar fall. He explains, “We do believe the greenbackis consolidating and not too far from bottoming out, but today’s price action suggeststhere is still potential for some further weakness.” According to Bennenbroek, recentgains in the dollar’s strength are “corrective.”8. Michael&lt; http://investing.reuters.co.uk/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=allBre... &gt; Woolfolk, Bank of New York Mellon: “Thedollar has further room to fall regardless of incoming US data.”Senior Bank of New York Mellon strategist Michael Woolfolk seems to think data andopinionated buzz points to a weakening dollar. “Bearish dollar-sentiment appears to besolidly in place going into the weekend,” he said. Because of this, Woolfolk thinksthat, regardless of incoming US data, “the dollar has further room to fall.”9. Alan&lt; http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid;=a7XmtNTULOiI&amp;refe...; &gt;Greenspan, Former Federal Reserve Chairman: China offloading of US Treasuries “won’ttrigger any rapid drop in the US dollar.”Greenspan doesn’t see doom in the dollar’s near future. Although China sales of USTreasuries are troublesome, he believes that “markets are clever enough not tooverreact.” He says this is old news, and doesn’t expect to see a large reaction. Anattendee of Greenspan’s presentation reports his sentiment as, “It’s already-knowninformation that won’t trigger any rapid drop in the U.S. dollar.”10. Eisuke&lt; http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid;=a7XmtNTULOiI&amp;refe...; &gt;Sakakibara, former top Japanese Ministry of Finance official: “We could see a plunge inthe dollar.”Eisuke Sakakibara is concerned that if US economic growth “fall[s] below 1 percent,” thedollar may “plunge.” This plunge, according to Sakakibara, would require interventionfrom the US, Japan and the EU to put a stop to it. 11. Masashi&lt; http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&amp;sid;=aKIYbnyVkqts&amp;refe...; &gt; Kurabe,Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ: “Negative implications for the dollar.”Masashi Kurabe sees the possibility of stagflation&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation &gt; , a period of both inflation and economicstagnation. “Economic data raise the question whether the U.S. economy will fall intostagflation,” he says. A period of stagflation could have “negative implications for thedollar.”12. Mansoor&lt; http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid;=a6sPzJqnT.0U&amp;refe...; &gt;Mohiuddin. UBS AG: “We continue to view dollar weakness as unsustainable.”Mansoor Mohiuddin sees a positive future for the dollar, calling its current weakness“unsustainable.” He believes that the G7 meeting will spark a resurgence of the dollar,explaining, “A strong G7 statement this weekend could be just what the dollar needs.”Bloomberg reports&lt; http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid;=a6sPzJqnT.0U&amp;refe...; &gt; UBS“predicted the dollar will rise 5.2 percent in the next three months as the FederalReserve delays further interest rate cuts.”Despite a few experts with a positive outlook for the dollar, the general consensusreflects a future that doesn’t look good. According to these experts, there is room forthe dollar to continue to fall, and currency traders should vigilantly look forpolitical and economic indicators that could bring trouble for the dollar.Enjoy this post?

Edgar Hoover, FBI Director 1924-1972, quoted in TheElks Magazine (August 1956). &quot;It is the duty of the patriot to protect his country fromits [corrupt feudal] government.&quot; -- Thomas Paine. “Each of you, for himself, by himselfand on his own responsibility, must speak”. -- Mark Twain. “The money powers prey uponthe nation in times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity. It is moredespotic than a monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, and more selfish thanbureaucracy. It denounces as public enemies all who question its methods or throw lightupon its crimes. I have two great enemies, the Southern Army in front of me and thebankers in the rear. Of the two, the one at my rear is my greatest foe.” -- PresidentAbraham Lincoln. “In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionaryact.” -- George OrwellJohn Swinton New York journalist at a banquet (1880’s): &quot;What folly is this, toasting anindependent press? There is no such thing, at this date of the World's history, inAmerica, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you whodares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it wouldnever appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper Iam connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and anyof you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streetslooking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of mypaper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of thejournalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn atthe feet of Mammon [Biblical ref.], and to sell his country and his race for his dailybread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press?We are the tools and vassals of “rich men” [Biblical ref.] behind the scenes. We are thejumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities andour lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.&quot;&quot;It is perfectly possible for a man to be out of prison, and yet not free - to be underno physical constraint and yet to be a psychological captive, compelled to think, feeland act as the representatives of the national state, or of some private interest withinthe nation, wants him to think, feel and act. &quot;The nature of psychological compulsion issuch that those who act under constraint remain under the impression that they areacting on their own initiative. The victim of mind-manipulation does not know that he isa victim. To him the walls of his prison are invisible, and he believes himself to befree. That he is not free is apparent only to other people. His servitude is strictlyobjective.&quot; Brave New World Revisited, Aldous Huxley, 1958*** exposing the hidden truth for further educational research only *** CAVEAT LECTOR***In accordance with Title 17 U.S.C.
