Supreme Court Will Hear D.C. Guns Case
http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8T1J9K80&amp;show;_article=1

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court said Tuesday it will decide whether
the District of Columbia can ban handguns, a case that could produce the
most in-depth examination of the constitutional right to &quot;keep and bear
arms&quot; in nearly 70 years.

The justices' decision to hear the case could make the divisive debate
over guns an issue in the 2008 presidential and congressional elections.

The government of Washington, D.C., is asking the court to uphold its
31-year ban on handgun ownership in the face of a federal appeals court
ruling that struck down the ban as incompatible with the Second
Amendment. Tuesday's announcement was widely expected, especially after
both the District and the man who challenged the handgun ban asked for
the high court review.

The main issue before the justices is whether the Second Amendment of
the Constitution protects an individual's right to own guns or instead
merely sets forth the collective right of states to maintain militias.
The former interpretation would permit fewer restrictions on gun ownership.

Gun-control advocates say the Second amendment was intended to insure
that states could maintain militias, a response to 18th century fears of
an all-powerful national government. Gun rights proponents contend the
amendment gives individuals the right to keep guns for private uses,
including self-defense.

Alan Gura, a lawyer for Washington residents who challenged the ban,
said he was pleased that the justices were considering the case.

&quot;We believe the Supreme Court will acknowledge that, while the use of
guns can be regulated, a complete prohibition on all functional firearms
is too extreme,&quot; Gura said. &quot;It's time to end this unconstitutional
disaster. It's time to restore a basic freedom to all Washington residents.&quot;

Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle
Association, noted that 44 state constitutions contain some form of gun
rights, which are not affected by the court's consideration of
Washington's restrictions. &quot;The American people know this is an
individual right the way they know that water quenches their thirst,&quot;
LaPierre said. &quot;The Second Amendment allows no line to be drawn between
individuals and their firearms.&quot;

Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said
the Supreme Court should &quot;reverse a clearly erroneous decision and make
it clear that the Constitution does not prevent communities from having
the gun laws they believe are needed to protect public safety.&quot;

The last Supreme Court ruling on the topic came in 1939 in U.S. v.
Miller, which involved a sawed-off shotgun. That decision supported the
collective rights view, but did not squarely answer the question in the
view of many constitutional scholars. Chief Justice John Roberts said at
his confirmation hearing that the correct reading of the Second
Amendment was &quot;still very much an open issue.&quot;

The Second Amendment reads: &quot;A well regulated militia, being necessary
to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and
bear arms, shall not be infringed.&quot;

Washington banned handguns in 1976, saying it was designed to reduce
violent crime in the nation's capital.

The City Council that adopted the ban said it was justified because
&quot;handguns have no legitimate use in the purely urban environment of the
District of Columbia.&quot;

The District is making several arguments in defense of the restriction,
including claiming that the Second Amendment involves militia service.
It also said the ban is constitutional because it limits the choice of
firearms, but does not prohibit residents from owning any guns at all.
Rifles and shotguns are legal, if kept under lock or disassembled.
Businesses may have guns for protection.

Chicago has a similar handgun ban, but few other gun-control laws are as
strict as the District's.

Four states—Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland and New York—urged the Supreme
Court to take the case because broad application of the appeals court
ruling would threaten &quot;all federal and state laws restricting access to
firearms.&quot;

Dick Anthony Heller, 65, an armed security guard, sued the District
after it rejected his application to keep a handgun at his home—about a
mile from the court—for protection.

The laws in question in the case do not &quot;merely regulate the possession
of firearms,&quot; Heller said. Instead, they &quot;amount to a complete
prohibition of the possession of all functional firearms within the home.&quot;

If the Second Amendment gives individuals the right to have guns, &quot;the
laws must yield,&quot; he said.

Opponents say the ban plainly has not worked because guns still are
readily available, through legal and illegal means. Although the city's
homicide rate has declined dramatically since peaking in the early
1990s, Washington still ranks among the nation's highest murder cities,
with 169 killings in 2006.

The U.S. Court Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-1
for Heller in March. Judge Laurence Silberman said reasonable
regulations still could be permitted, but said the ban went too far.

The Bush administration, which has endorsed individual gun-ownership
rights, has yet to weigh in on this case.

Arguments will be heard early next year.

The case is District of Columbia v. Heller, 07-290.

I agree, IF they decide on the merits of the case. The SCOTUS has been
establishing a pattern of finding technical reasons for making decisions
which still leave the Constitutional question up for grabs.

I agree also. Those Supreme Court Justices will probably do every kind

I respectfully disagree.

&quot;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a
free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,
shall not be infringed.&quot;

If the first clause weren't important, why on earth would it
be in there at all, why would it come first, and why would it
contain the otherwise meaningless adjectival structure
&quot;well regulated&quot;?

I'd say the amendment is badly written from our perspective,
but I think most people, when they consider the structure of
the states at the time of the American Revolution, would
agree that militias were far more important then than they are
today: more important than a national army.

I concur.  However, I do not believe, nor expect, that strict scrutiny
will apply - and thus most gun laws will still be constitutional.
Only those that are outright bans will likely be invalidated, and DC's
law could go either way.  Also, I expect the Court to not address
whether the 2nd applies to the states via the 14th, although I think
it should.

Not sure that &quot;most&quot; will be the right adjective,  but I quite agree that an
&quot;uphold&quot; by the SCOTUS would not affect (1) screening to weed out felons,
(2) storage regulations, and the like, for example.

I would also expect right-to-carry to be possibly affected in places where
it is strongly regulated.

http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=27640

George Mason, called the father of the Bill of Rights, said, &quot;What is the
militia? It is the whole people. To disarm the people is the best and most
effectual way to enslave them.&quot; James Madison, called the father of the
Constitution, said of tyrants, &quot;[They were] afraid to trust the people with
arms,&quot; and lauded &quot;the advantage of being armed, which Americans possess
over the people of almost every other nation.&quot;
Thomas Paine said, &quot;The peaceable part of mankind will be overrun by the
vile and abandoned while they neglect the means of self-defense. [Weakness]
allures the ruffian [but] arms like laws discourage and keep the invader and
plunderer in awe and preserve order in the world. Horrid mischief would
ensue were [the good] deprived of the use of them. The weak will become a
prey to the strong.&quot;

Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence
Tribe says, &quot;The 14th Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights
applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was
a 'privilege' of each citizen.&quot; Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan
Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the
Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. &quot;Foolish
liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution
by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a
safety hazard,&quot; said Dershowitz, &quot;don't see the danger of the big picture.&quot;
He added, &quot;They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same
means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.&quot;

These are reasonable arguments made for your view, but they
don't persuade the other side away from the counterarguments,
nor will the other side persuade you.  I can't get away myself from
that opening clause of the two clauses - if we're going to stick
with literalism.  That's not to say that being slaves to the
constitution is anything but façade.  It is the American tradition to
try to find some constitutional hook, no matter how far-fetched, to
hang everything on.  Other countries don't do that.  The tradition
does have its virtues, so I'm not really criticising, but it has its
liabilities too, and no shortage of ridiculousness in trying to fit
21st century pegs into 18th century holes.

This particular issue of gun control immingled with militias is not
a straightforward example of the hallowed &quot;English common law&quot;
which does in general elsewhere serve as an &quot;eternal&quot; traditional
basis.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This will be a 4:5 decision to decide if the &quot;right&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is an individual citizen right or a state right. What
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do You think?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what I DON'T think. I don't think the founding fathers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; put into a bill of rights a right granted to the federal government when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the bill of rights was meant to guarantee certain rights to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; individual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; citizen. Do you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, let's put it this way:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think arguments that the 2nd applies to groups and not individual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;citizens
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are contorted, constrained, and all rather silly, when you really parse
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;through.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I respectfully disagree.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  &quot;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;   free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,
&gt;&gt;&gt;   shall not be infringed.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;  If the first clause weren't important, why on earth would it
&gt;&gt;&gt; be in there at all, why would it come first, and why would it
&gt;&gt;&gt; contain the otherwise meaningless adjectival structure
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;well regulated&quot;?

&gt;&gt;It explains the reasoning for the Amendment. I suspect the Framers knew that
&gt;&gt;restrictions on firearms is the first place a coercive goverment wants to
&gt;&gt;exert its control.

&gt;&gt;&gt;   I'd say the amendment is badly written from our perspective,

&gt;&gt;Agreed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; but I think most people, when they consider the structure of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the states at the time of the American Revolution, would
&gt;&gt;&gt; agree that militias were far more important then than they are
&gt;&gt;&gt; today: more important than a national army.

&gt;&gt;Agreed again, but per the above, not germane to the interpretation.

&gt;   I have to disagree.  The first clause is first.
&gt;I think the aim was the strength of the militias,
&gt;and the Founders didn't envision that eventually
&gt;most gunholders would never be connected in
&gt;any way with militias.

The issue at the time was whether the USA had a standing army or
relied on militias in time of war.  It wasn't about individuals.

They gave the right to individuals who were the members of the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Agreed again, but per the above, not germane to the interpretation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;   I have to disagree.  The first clause is first.

&gt;&gt;Then it's unique in the BOR in that it's not targed at individual rights.

&gt;&gt; http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=27640

&gt;&gt;George Mason, called the father of the Bill of Rights, said, &quot;What is the
&gt;&gt;militia? It is the whole people. To disarm the people is the best and most
&gt;&gt;effectual way to enslave them.&quot; James Madison, called the father of the
&gt;&gt;Constitution, said of tyrants, &quot;[They were] afraid to trust the people
&gt;&gt;with
&gt;&gt;arms,&quot; and lauded &quot;the advantage of being armed, which Americans possess
&gt;&gt;over the people of almost every other nation.&quot;
&gt;&gt;Thomas Paine said, &quot;The peaceable part of mankind will be overrun by the
&gt;&gt;vile and abandoned while they neglect the means of self-defense.
&gt;&gt;[Weakness]
&gt;&gt;allures the ruffian [but] arms like laws discourage and keep the invader
&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;plunderer in awe and preserve order in the world. Horrid mischief would
&gt;&gt;ensue were [the good] deprived of the use of them. The weak will become a
&gt;&gt;prey to the strong.&quot;

&gt;&gt;Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence
&gt;&gt;Tribe says, &quot;The 14th Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights
&gt;&gt;applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms
&gt;&gt;was
&gt;&gt;a 'privilege' of each citizen.&quot; Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan
&gt;&gt;Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. &quot;Foolish
&gt;&gt;liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the
&gt;&gt;Constitution
&gt;&gt;by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a
&gt;&gt;safety hazard,&quot; said Dershowitz, &quot;don't see the danger of the big
&gt;&gt;picture.&quot;
&gt;&gt;He added, &quot;They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same
&gt;&gt;means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.&quot;

&gt;   These are reasonable arguments made for your view, but they
&gt; don't persuade the other side away from the counterarguments,
">

No question. Agreed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; nor will the other side persuade you.  I can't get away myself from
&gt; that opening clause of the two clauses - if we're going to stick
&gt; with literalism.  That's not to say that being slaves to the
&gt; constitution is anything but façade.  It is the American tradition to
&gt; try to find some constitutional hook, no matter how far-fetched, to
&gt; hang everything on.  Other countries don't do that.
">

It will be hard to persuade me that the Constitution doesn't mean anything.
For example, I find that's the most appealing thing about Ron Paul -- he's
not afraid to hold it up and say &quot;This means something.&quot; (To me, meaning &quot;We
can debate about what it means, but let's not forget it's the starting point
of the debate.&quot;)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The tradition
&gt; does have its virtues, so I'm not really criticising, but it has its
&gt; liabilities too, and no shortage of ridiculousness in trying to fit
&gt; 21st century pegs into 18th century holes.
">

I see far more appropriateness than I do the reverse. The world changes,
humans don't. (Remembering here the writings, attributed to Socrates, about
the dearth of character he saw amongst the youth of the day.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  This particular issue of gun control immingled with militias is not
&gt; a straightforward example of the hallowed &quot;English common law&quot;
&gt; which does in general elsewhere serve as an &quot;eternal&quot; traditional
&gt; basis.
">

Agreed. However, I see a very important connection between the idea of
&quot;inalienable human rights&quot; (vs. &quot;rights being a government grant&quot;) and
weapon ownership.

I should point out that I don't own a gun, never have, and see no reason to
ever (personally) own one.

I don't think that it did.

The right to bear arms originally was a limitation on the federal
government, not the state governments. The 14th amendment extends that
to limitations on the state governments.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do You think?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what I DON'T think. I don't think the founding fathers
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; put into a bill of rights a right granted to the federal government when
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the bill of rights was meant to guarantee certain rights to the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; individual
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; citizen. Do you?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Well, let's put it this way:

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I think arguments that the 2nd applies to groups and not individual
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;citizens
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;are contorted, constrained, and all rather silly, when you really parse
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;them
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;through.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I respectfully disagree.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  &quot;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a
&gt; &gt;&gt;   free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,
&gt; &gt;&gt;   shall not be infringed.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;  If the first clause weren't important, why on earth would it
&gt; &gt;&gt; be in there at all, why would it come first, and why would it
&gt; &gt;&gt; contain the otherwise meaningless adjectival structure
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;well regulated&quot;?

&gt; &gt;Ever thought that it might be intended to allow the &quot;PEOPLE&quot; the means to
&gt; &gt;regulate the militia?

&gt; &gt;&gt;   I'd say the amendment is badly written from our perspective,
&gt; &gt;&gt; but I think most people, when they consider the structure of
&gt; &gt;&gt; the states at the time of the American Revolution, would
&gt; &gt;&gt; agree that militias were far more important then than they are
&gt; &gt;&gt; today: more important than a national army.

&gt; &gt;That still does not answer my question. Why would the founders include a
&gt; &gt;right granted to a central government in the Bill of Rights?

&gt; They didn't.

This should be very good for the National Guard. They'll have a hundred
million new volunteers. Then we'll have the ability to put the population
in Iraq to go with the new capital city. Though it is bigger than Vatican
City, the architecture will be much more efficient, not being built to inform
the illiterate and all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It explains the reasoning for the Amendment. I suspect the Framers knew

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Agreed again, but per the above, not germane to the interpretation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   I have to disagree.  The first clause is first.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Then it's unique in the BOR in that it's not targed at individual rights.

&gt;&gt;&gt;George Mason, called the father of the Bill of Rights, said, &quot;What is the
&gt;&gt;&gt;militia? It is the whole people. To disarm the people is the best and most
&gt;&gt;&gt;effectual way to enslave them.&quot; James Madison, called the father of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Constitution, said of tyrants, &quot;[They were] afraid to trust the people
&gt;&gt;&gt;with
&gt;&gt;&gt;arms,&quot; and lauded &quot;the advantage of being armed, which Americans possess
&gt;&gt;&gt;over the people of almost every other nation.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Thomas Paine said, &quot;The peaceable part of mankind will be overrun by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;vile and abandoned while they neglect the means of self-defense.
&gt;&gt;&gt;[Weakness]
&gt;&gt;&gt;allures the ruffian [but] arms like laws discourage and keep the invader
&gt;&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;plunderer in awe and preserve order in the world. Horrid mischief would
&gt;&gt;&gt;ensue were [the good] deprived of the use of them. The weak will become a
&gt;&gt;&gt;prey to the strong.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence
&gt;&gt;&gt;Tribe says, &quot;The 14th Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights
&gt;&gt;&gt;applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms
&gt;&gt;&gt;was
&gt;&gt;&gt;a 'privilege' of each citizen.&quot; Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan
&gt;&gt;&gt;Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of
&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. &quot;Foolish
&gt;&gt;&gt;liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Constitution
&gt;&gt;&gt;by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;safety hazard,&quot; said Dershowitz, &quot;don't see the danger of the big
&gt;&gt;&gt;picture.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;He added, &quot;They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.&quot;

&gt;&gt;   These are reasonable arguments made for your view, but they
&gt;&gt; don't persuade the other side away from the counterarguments,

&gt;No question. Agreed.

&gt;&gt; nor will the other side persuade you.  I can't get away myself from
&gt;&gt; that opening clause of the two clauses - if we're going to stick
&gt;&gt; with literalism.  That's not to say that being slaves to the
&gt;&gt; constitution is anything but façade.  It is the American tradition to
&gt;&gt; try to find some constitutional hook, no matter how far-fetched, to
&gt;&gt; hang everything on.  Other countries don't do that.

&gt;It will be hard to persuade me that the Constitution doesn't mean anything.

&gt;&gt;  This particular issue of gun control immingled with militias is not
&gt;&gt; a straightforward example of the hallowed &quot;English common law&quot;
&gt;&gt; which does in general elsewhere serve as an &quot;eternal&quot; traditional
&gt;&gt; basis.

&gt;Agreed. However, I see a very important connection between the idea of
&gt;&quot;inalienable human rights&quot; (vs. &quot;rights being a government grant&quot;) and
&gt;weapon ownership.

We've been through this.  We don't agree.  Half the US
agrees with you, half doesn't.  In the 18th century there
was no confusion because the militias were the peacekeepers.
Now they aren't, and we're debating a distinction that didn't
exist at the time of the framers.

&gt;I should point out that I don't own a gun, never have, and see no reason to

I don't either, though I think about getting one from time to
time.  I have a glass front door, so it would be easy for an
intruder to get in.  I'm getting older, so it's getting more
questionable how well I could handle even an unarmed
intruder.  There's a wire mesh behind the glass door, but
that wouldn't buy much time.  I don't even like having
propane containers inside the house, so I'd probably not
feel comfortable with a loaded gun around.

I've only fired real guns one day in my life, up in Alaska.
(As opposed to BB guns and air guns.)   My friend loaded
the guns for me. I have to admit I enjoyed shooting at
empty cartons.  I wouldn't want to shoot at an animal,
though, even for food, certainly not for &quot;sport&quot;.  My friend
has killed moose, and the moosemeat is good.  It doesn't
taste strange like venison and is a lot less fatty than beef.

The 2nd Amendment was a re-iteration of the guarantee of an American
citizen's right to keep and bear arms. The 14th Amendment, one of the three
&quot;War Amendments&quot; further guaranteed that no individual state could make
and/or enforce any law that took away or hurt a citizen's civil rights.

The founding fathers did NOT include in the amendments one that would grant
a right to the federal government, and subsequently to the states, the power
to preclude an American citizen keeping and bearing arms.

This is just another asanine statement from a very naieve standpoint. It is
sheer fantasy to think that there will never be any bad guys in the world,
or even in your own neighborhood. To deny that is a two-fold trait. It is
cowardice for hiding from reality and it is foolishness for failing to be
prepared for the day you are confronted with that once in a lifetime life or
death situation.

See if you can give an honest answer to this. Assume you are a purse
snatcher. You're walking down the street and you see two old women
approaching you. Both have their purses dangling in such a manner as to be
easily grabbed. One woman has a 357 strappend to her waist, the other has
nothing. Which purse you gonna grab?

Just the possibility that the place one is about to break into is protected
by armed occupants usually precludes the evil deed. If you want to try that
out for truth, just put a sign in your window that says &quot;No weapons on these
premises&quot;.

You can be fairly certain that the applicability of what otherwise might be

of Columbia, since it clearly is NOT a state.  If I wanted to bet on
something, I'd be willing to bet that the Court will limit it's deliberation
and findings to that one issue in order to avoid taking a position that
might reflect poorly on the Court as an institution with the broad American
public.  Precedence, as in their past dealings with the matter of abortion,
suggests that it might just turn out to be so.

This entire subject has been argued ad nauseum ever since the Bill of Rights
was first enacted.  I don't believe that additional argument serves any
purpose at this point unless it takes place within the walls of the SCOTUS.
It doesn't matter how or to what extent you agree or disagree with what they
end up proclaiming.....their interpretation of what the Second Amendment
means is the only one that's going to make any difference in the way anyone
lives, if indeed they even go that far.

The Court claimed it would answer:  &quot;Whether the following provisions

the Second Amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with
any state-regulated militia, but who wish to keep handguns and other
firearms for private use in their homes.&quot;

Well, gee!  If the purse snatcher were at all rational, he would snatch
the 357 and use it to steal both purses!  Or just snatch the 357 to sell
on the black market - it is likely to be worth much more than what might
be in an old lady's purse.  What are they going to do, hit him with
their purses?

OTOH, one can purchase a 120db alarm which will sound as soon as the
purse is removed from the owner for far less than the cost of a 357.
There are even models which will hit the snatcher with a 100,000v
electric shock.

You may have missed my point.  JC complained about your focus on the
word &quot;regulated&quot;, and offered his interpretation.  What JC doesn't
realize, is that his interpretation might allow the DC law to survive,
not something JC likely intended.

And of course Geroge Z is correct that only interpretation that counts
will be that given by SCOTUS.

&gt;&gt; You can be fairly certain that the applicability of what otherwise might
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; termed a right reserved for the states does or doesn't apply to the
&gt;&gt; District
&gt;&gt; of Columbia, since it clearly is NOT a state.

&gt; Until the 14th Amendment, the Bill of Rights limited federal
&gt; government power, and thus DC is covered.

&gt;&gt; If I wanted to bet on
&gt;&gt; something, I'd be willing to bet that the Court will limit it's
&gt;&gt; deliberation
&gt;&gt; and findings to that one issue in order to avoid taking a position that
&gt;&gt; might reflect poorly on the Court as an institution with the broad
&gt;&gt; American
&gt;&gt; public.  Precedence, as in their past dealings with the matter of
&gt;&gt; abortion,
&gt;&gt; suggests that it might just turn out to be so.

&gt; The Court claimed it would answer:  &quot;Whether the following provisions
&gt; -- D.C. Code secs. 7-2502.02(a)(4), 22-4504(a), and 7-2507.02 -- violate
&gt; the Second Amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with
&gt; any state-regulated militia, but who wish to keep handguns and other
&gt; firearms for private use in their homes.&quot;
&gt; http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/uncategorized/court-agrees-to-rule-on-gu...
&gt; That would suggest they are going to rule on both the specifics of the
&gt; DC law, and the more general question of the nature of the Second
&gt; Amendment right.
">

That might very well be their pre-hearing intent, but I'll believe it after
I see it.  In spite of that intent, they may yet end up with nine differing
opinions and no finding.  We shall see in due time.

Stealing a tank and driving down the street does sound
like a helluva lot of fun.  It's something you should only do
before you're 18 and can be tried as an adult, though.

I watched a video a couple of months ago when a disgruntled former GI stole a
tank from a base in California (some years ago), then rode helter skelter all
over the area squashing cars and whatever else got in his way.  His trip didn't
end up in court; he ended up on a slab instead.

You have to survive the arrest process to be tried in any way, shape or form.
There's no guarantees in crime.

Courts-martial offense, especially if in the process thereof you manage to
knock down one of their outhouses (provincially known as latrines) while it
was occupied by a commissioned soul.  The United States Army is well known
for its unfailing lack of humor in cases of that ilk.

I stole a big fire truck and drove around the neighborhood with the siren
blaring for about 40 minutes before they caught me. But it being a small
town where everyone knew everyone, we just agreed that I wouldn't do that
anymore and all was well.
