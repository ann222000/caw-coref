Measuring the vector potential

I was reading up about the magnetic vector potential (A) on Wikipedia
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_vector_potential ) , and got
myself confused about something that I'm hoping y'all can help me
with.

That article says that there is a big guage choice in defining the
vector potential because the divergence doesn't affect the magnetic
field, and could therefore be anything at all.  It seems to me,
however, that:

- The E field is directly measurable, and has a -dA/dt term
- A at every point is a linear function of nearby currents
- We can create an oscillating current element (not a loop) and
correlate dE/dt at nearby points to ddJ/dtdt in that current element.
- this would tell us exactly how the vector potential is generated by
currents, including its divergence.

So how can the divergence be a guage choice?

Thanks for any help,

Mr. E

The mathematical operation of an indefinite integral always includes
the addition of an &quot;arbitrary&quot; integration constant. That means that
the potential isn't fixed but can take any value depending upon the
constant of integration.  One must set the arbitrary constant to some
agreed-upon standard to achieve consistency.

This thing holds for the Magentic Vector potential because as you
note, the E field is determined by induction which relates to -dA/dt.
So to find A one must integrate dA/dt. Once again there is an
arbitrary constant of integration that can be added because there are
many solutions to the differential equation in question.  The choice
of that constant is what sets the gauge.

So then the &quot;real&quot; question becomes what should one set the constant
to such that values of &quot;A&quot; correspond to it's absolute values as
measured in space. But A is very difficult to measure directly and yet
Feynman and others have observed that A rather than B seems to be the
&quot;real&quot; field.  (in other words quantum expressions etc. seem to work
with A but become a mess if one tries to use B)  So. Classical E&amp;M
guys have long regarded A as only a mathematical &quot;trick&quot; useful for
calculation but not fundamental because the value of A seems to be
quite arbitrary. Quantum physicists on the other hand look at their
equations and find A more fundamental than B.

So what gives? What gives is that nobody has quite figured it all out
yet. The key, would be some kind of &quot;A&quot; meter which could read A
directly and therefore set the arbitrary constant by imposing this
&quot;absolute&quot; value as some kind of &quot;boundary condition&quot; to be matched. I
don't think that anyone is quite there yet.

OK?

You might like to take a look at
http://www.scribd.com/doc/4445/quaternionic-electrodynamics
Normal gauge conditions assume that the constant or the potential zero
point is the same for all points in space.
If you don't make this assumption you get a additional free variable
which can be expressed as a new field component.

This helps describing how an electromagnetic system interact with the
zero point energy.

The divergence of A, which is the supposed guage choice, is a spatial
function and is not the integration constant of the time derivative
above.

The purpose of the experiment I outlined is not to directly measure A,
but to determine how A is created by currents.  It assumes that, when
E isn't changing, A = some_kernel convolved with J, which is very
likely, and then measures the kernel directly by modulating J and then
measuring the correlated oscillations in dA/dt at various points in
the surrounding space.

Finding that kernel allows us to calculate A from J, including the
divergence.  The ability to determine that kernel experimentally,
then, makes me think the the divergence of A has easily measurable,
physical consequences instead of being an arbitrary guage choice.

Actually the time derivative IS a spatial function, but be that as it
may...

Any vector field is defined by both its curl and divergence.  A is no
different. The defining relation for A is that B is given by the Curl
of A.  But that leaves divergence of A to be set any way we wish.  One
such &quot;usual&quot; &quot;gauge&quot; is to set the divergence of A equal to zero. this
gives the usual relationship between J (current density) and A. But
actually an arbitrary divergence value can be picked because no matter
what we choose it does not change our definition that the Curl of A
gives B.

I'm not sure that your experiment which to me seems to be nothing more
than creating a varying current and measuring the resultant induction
(E) will determine an &quot;absolute&quot;  divergence of A.      And even if
you could measure the divergence of A what would it give you?  The
divergence plays no role in the determination of B which is the
defining property of A. The divergence is arbitrary in that regard.

It does seem right to me that what you'd want to do is SOMEHOW find a
physical property that is linked directly to the divergence of A. It's
not B, so it must be something else if it exists. Once you find that
property and measure it in relation to J then your plan is on it's
way.

I personally have no idea what that property would be. I don't think
that taking a second derivate of Induction will do it. You'll have to
find something other than B and induction to set this. From the
arbitrary value of A you can easily see how E&amp;M guys dismiss A as
simply a mathematical calculating trick without any physical
significance.

I think you are thinking on the right track here, and you obviously
are going after this just like a bulldog!   I'm hoping you won't
induce me to actually spend the time to go back and understand all
this once again!  Good Luck!

Personally I have a problem imagining a &quot;model&quot; for A.  The Biot-
Savart relation gives a reasonable model for B where a charged
particle that represents the current is thought to have a spinning
field about it.  If one assumes that in a current somehow all the
charged particles line up with their axes in the same direction one
can see how an integration of all particles making up the current
produces the B-S relation for a B field.  But what is the model for
A?  What kind of thing would a spinning charged particle exude
isotropically in all directions and even more interesting only fall
off as 1/r?  What kind of thing would give another field by just
taking it's curl. So here we have a field that is quite weird and
obscure in the sense of modeling it and yet physicists agree is
somehow more &quot;fundamental&quot; that the more easily imagined B field. So
what is going on? Damned if I know!

The E field associated with a time-varying current is different from the E
field associated with electrostatics. An electrostatic field exerts an
attraction or repulsion between charges. But the force associated with a
time-varying current is a dragging force: it causes charges to move parallel
(or anti-parallel) to the current's direction.

This time-varying field has been named an Electrokinetic field or Ek. This
is the field that is responsible for induction.

Its intensity is proportional to the rate of change of current flow and
inversely proportional to r (distance) and to cSQR. It is equal to the
negative time derivative of A, the magnetic vector potential. or,
Ek= -dA/dt.

Integrate this and we get A = - integral(Ek) + a constant

The integral of Ek may be referred to as the electrokinetic impulse. so, we
may say that the magnetic vector potential created by a current at a point
in space is equal to the negative of the electrokinetic impulse produced by
this current at the time the current is switched on.

The electrokinetic impulse is a measurable quantity (in principle) so the
above represents both a definition and a physical interpretation of A.
Please see, Jefimenko' &quot;Causality, Electromagnetic Induction and
Gravitation&quot; Section 2-4. You *have* ordered it, haven't you, Benj?

It will be an interesting challenge to figure out how to measure it, but at
least, Mr. Entropy, you will know what you are looking for.

Well... I have 'em all. Each has its own merits, but the best starting point
is &quot;Causality...&quot; That one has the basic derivations that explain
Displacement Current, Induction etc.

&quot;Retardation...&quot; is an excellent follow-up. As our buddy &quot;maxwell&quot; might
say, &quot;This is the one that &quot;saves&quot; Special Relativity.&quot; Or maybe it &quot;saves&quot;
Maxwell's Equations.&quot; Maybe both.

Be prepared to pay *close* attention in all his work. He does not
differentiate between &quot;stuff&quot; that you already know/should know and &quot;stuff&quot;
that is new and innovative. I read his work on induction three times before
I realized that he had just thrown the basis of everything that I had
learned about transformers and mutual induction right onto the trash heap!

Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.  But that would mean that

Up 'til now it has been masked by at least three issues. The first is the
idea that an E field can *cause* an H field. The second is that an H field
can *cause* an E field. The third is Lentz's law.

The first has been proven empirically false since no one has ever been able
to measure the Magnetic field &quot;caused&quot; by Displacement Current.

The second has been masked by the assumption  that induction is a magnetic
effect when it is an interaction between the movement of charges as
manifested by Ek.

The third has been *ignored*. This is Lentz's law, an interactive property
that has remained unexplained/unexplainable since it was determined
empirically way back when. The equations that define Ek show how and why
Lentz's law &quot;works&quot; the way it does.

I hope this helps. There's lots more, and that's why I was &quot;ragging&quot; on
Benj. Much of the &quot;stuff&quot; that he (and I) are interested in is covered by
Jefimenko's work.

&gt; Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.  But that would mean that

Actually it is &quot;sort of&quot; common knowledge these days. The problem is
that Maxwell himself promoted the &quot;one E field&quot; idea and it was taken
up with glee by the electromagnetic community for a great many years.
You can probably STILL find people teaching it.  But careful
consideration of the field properties of Electrostatic, induced and
motional E fields show that these cannot possibly be &quot;one E field&quot;
Maxwell assumed. The first person I know to point this out was
Bridgeman in his book about &quot;operational physics&quot; where he classifies
fields and effects according to the operations that give rise to
them.  I think it was published about 1930.

&gt; I was reading up about the magnetic vector potential (A) on Wikipedia

&gt; myself confused about something that I'm hoping y'all can help me
&gt; with.

&gt; That article says that there is a big guage choice in defining the
&gt; vector potential because the divergence doesn't affect the magnetic
&gt; field, and could therefore be anything at all.  It seems to me,
&gt; however, that:

&gt; - The E field is directly measurable, and has a -dA/dt term
&gt; - A at every point is a linear function of nearby currents
&gt; - We can create an oscillating current element (not a loop) and
&gt; correlate dE/dt at nearby points to ddJ/dtdt in that current element.
&gt; - this would tell us exactly how the vector potential is generated by
&gt; currents, including its divergence.

&gt; So how can the divergence be a guage choice?

&gt; Thanks for any help,

&gt; Mr. E

It is only the Lorenz gauge that reflects the capacity of the
potentials to propagate across space at speed c, reflecting the fact
that EM interactions occur on the mutual light-cone of each of the
pair of interacting electrons.  This gauge reflects the continuity
condition (in 3D vector form) that c A = u V.  This ensures that both
the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential (A) 'stay in synch'
&amp; both propagate at c in any inertial frame moving at velocity u
relative to the (instantaneous) frame where both electrons were first
at rest before they started to interact.  At the end of the day, both
the potentials (&amp; their derivatives - the fields) cannot be measured:
only the relative motion of the electrons across space over time are
measurable - the rest is theory. It is also useful to think of the
potentials as Aristotle would have: as the capability (&amp; possibility)
to generate change in the world.

I haven't read Jefimenko's work, but I've come to the conclusion that
E of a charge moving in a charge distribution acts upon that
distribution which in turn acts back on the charge so creating an E
with components parallel and normal to the charge's motion. That which
is normal to the charge's motion is interpteted as the B component
because it does no work, that which is parallel is the E component

Nope...

Jefimenko's proposition is that Maxwell's equations are descriptive; not
causative. He maintains Maxwell's independent definitions of E and H and
assumes their properties are pretty much the same as has always been
postulated.

He shows that their causes are charges and the motion of charges. Since both
E and H have the same root causes, this is why a time varying E is always
associated with a time varying H, and vice-versa.

Unfortunately, Jefimenko's work is &quot;equation rich&quot; and no one (that I know
of) has published any simplified versions with diagrams etc.

The only other place to which I can point you would be Wikepedia. Search for
&quot;Jefimenko's Equations.&quot; This will at least show you the structure and

Well put, Bill.  It's hard to get people to think about the physics
when they are only examined on the math.
The L-W potentials are derived using a 'small' volume filled with
electric fluid (popularly known as 'charge density').  The 'back' of
this volume reacts to the 'target' (field) point at a slightly
different time than the 'front', hence the retarded factor. Finally
the limit is taken of shrinking the volume to zero for a 'point'
charge.  Good luck trying to derive this result, ab initio, from the
defininition of a real point-particle, with no finite size, like the
electron.

And it's especially hard when so many physicists think that the math
IS the physics!

On the other side of that coin, however, I recall the chairman of a
major physics department bitching to me about how he was required to
provide a physics course that was a graduation requirement for
Education Majors. However, they wouldn't let him include any math in
the course at all!!!  The upshot was this &quot;special&quot; course just for
future science teachers that I gleefully termed &quot;physics appreciation
101&quot;! :-)  God help America, given that kids are our future.

I recall when *I* was a kid in school. Very interested in physical
science, of course. So I patiently waited through most of the school
year for us to get back to the chapter on physical science. When we
arrived there the Teacher just spend ONE day on it and then moved on
to describing plant and frog parts again!  It's a wonder I'm not
flipping burgers at McDonalds today.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Up 'til now it has been masked by at least three issues. The first is

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; can *cause* an E field. The third is Lentz's law.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The first has been proven empirically false since no one has ever been

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; magnetic
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; effect when it is an interaction between the movement of charges as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; manifested by Ek.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The third has been *ignored*. This is Lentz's law, an interactive
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; property
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that has remained unexplained/unexplainable since it was determined

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; why
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Lentz's law &quot;works&quot; the way it does.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I haven't read Jefimenko's work, but I've come to the conclusion that
&gt;&gt; &gt; E of a charge moving in a charge distribution acts upon that
&gt;&gt; &gt; distribution which in turn acts back on the charge so creating an E
&gt;&gt; &gt; with components parallel and normal to the charge's motion. That which
&gt;&gt; &gt; is normal to the charge's motion is interpteted as the B component
&gt;&gt; &gt; because it does no work, that which is parallel is the E component
&gt;&gt; &gt; because it does work. Is this similar to what Jefimenko has in mind?

&gt;&gt; Nope...

&gt;&gt; Jefimenko's proposition is that Maxwell's equations are descriptive; not
&gt;&gt; causative. He maintains Maxwell's independent definitions of E and H and
&gt;&gt; assumes their properties are pretty much the same as has always been
&gt;&gt; postulated.

&gt;&gt; He shows that their causes are charges and the motion of charges. Since
&gt;&gt; both
&gt;&gt; E and H have the same root causes, this is why a time varying E is always
&gt;&gt; associated with a time varying H, and vice-versa.

&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, Jefimenko's work is &quot;equation rich&quot; and no one (that I
&gt;&gt; know
&gt;&gt; of) has published any simplified versions with diagrams etc.

&gt;&gt; The only other place to which I can point you would be Wikepedia. Search
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; &quot;Jefimenko's Equations.&quot; This will at least show you the structure and
&gt;&gt; layout of the equations.

&gt;&gt; I hope this helps!

&gt;&gt; Bill

&gt; His equations don't look as useful as the Lienard-Wiechert potentials
&gt; or E and B for a moving charge.

Your approach reminds me of the night watchman that spotted a drunk on his
hands and knees under a streetlight.
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; asked the policeman.
&quot;I'm looking for my watch,&quot; replied the drunk.
The policeman glanced around him. &quot;Where'd you lose it?&quot;
&quot;Over there.&quot; The drunk gestured to a dark alley.
&quot;Why are you looking for it here?&quot; asked the policeman.
&quot;Because the lights better here!&quot; replied the drunk.

Moral: The easiest approach will not necessarily yield the desired results.

Cheers!
Bill

One important item Jefimenko points out is that when you have an array
of moving time-dependent charges, Newton's law of action-reaction may
no longer hold true. There are various cases where the force one
charge creates on another is NOT identically reflected back to the
first charge by the motion of the second charge. Conservation of
momentum, on the other hand always DOES hold true even in regions of
space where there are two equal but opposite fields that cancel and
appear to give a space with no field present.  The whole thing is
rather mathematical so for a proof and total understanding you'll have
to read Jefimenko's actual derivations.

&gt; Well put, Bill.  It's hard to get people to think about the physics
&gt; when they are only examined on the math.
&gt; The L-W potentials are derived using a 'small' volume filled with
&gt; electric fluid (popularly known as 'charge density').  The 'back' of
&gt; this volume reacts to the 'target' (field) point at a slightly
&gt; different time than the 'front', hence the retarded factor.
">

Who's point are you answering?

The back of the charge reacting to the observation point is just plain
stupid.

There is a retarded factor because the contributions to the potential
at an observation point for charges moving are different compared to
if the charges were static but at the same positions.

Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Finally
&gt; the limit is taken of shrinking the volume to zero for a 'point'
&gt; charge.  Good luck trying to derive this result, ab initio, from the
&gt; defininition of a real point-particle, with no finite size, like the
&gt; electron.- Hide quoted text -
">

Yes, the factor is still there as the size tends towards zero for an
electron.

Sounds identical to what I've been thinking. I'm saying that this
retarded reacting force can be decomposed into two parts normal (the B
component) and parallel (the induced E component) to the original
motion of the acting charge. B and the induced E are the components of
the retarded E of a reacting charge.

Yes that does sound identical. However Jefimenko seems to break the
forces down into more than two parts, but as I said, it's best to look
at his actual equations and illustrations to see what he did. At this
point I'm really not the one to ask what he did.

&gt; &gt; this volume reacts to the 'target' (field) point at a slightly
&gt; &gt; different time than the 'front', hence the retarded factor.

&gt; Who's point are you answering?

&gt; The back of the charge reacting to the observation point is just plain
&gt; stupid.

&gt; There is a retarded factor because the contributions to the potential
&gt; at an observation point for charges moving are different compared to
&gt; if the charges were static but at the same positions.

&gt; Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
&gt; and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
&gt; observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
&gt; is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
&gt; dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
&gt; the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
&gt; equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
&gt; increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

&gt; &gt;Finally
&gt; &gt; the limit is taken of shrinking the volume to zero for a 'point'
&gt; &gt; charge.  Good luck trying to derive this result, ab initio, from the
&gt; &gt; defininition of a real point-particle, with no finite size, like the
&gt; &gt; electron.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; Yes, the factor is still there as the size tends towards zero for an
&gt; electron.

Please learn to read. I wrote &quot;ab initio&quot; not &quot;tends towards zero&quot;.
This was my point that Maxwellian EM is based on extended charge
definitions not point charges; ah well, they just don't teach Latin
anymore.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.  But that would mean that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Gauss' law, which fails to distinguish E from Ek, is incorrect in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; presence of varying currents.  If that's true, wouldn't it be common
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge by now?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Up 'til now it has been masked by at least three issues. The first is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; idea that an E field can *cause* an H field. The second is that an H
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; field
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can *cause* an E field. The third is Lentz's law.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The first has been proven empirically false since no one has ever been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; able
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to measure the Magnetic field &quot;caused&quot; by Displacement Current.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The second has been masked by the assumption  that induction is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; magnetic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; effect when it is an interaction between the movement of charges as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; manifested by Ek.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The third has been *ignored*. This is Lentz's law, an interactive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; property
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that has remained unexplained/unexplainable since it was determined
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; empirically way back when. The equations that define Ek show how and why
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Lentz's law &quot;works&quot; the way it does.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't read Jefimenko's work, but I've come to the conclusion that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E of a charge moving in a charge distribution acts upon that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distribution which in turn acts back on the charge so creating an E
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with components parallel and normal to the charge's motion. That which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is normal to the charge's motion is interpteted as the B component
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because it does no work, that which is parallel is the E component
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because it does work. Is this similar to what Jefimenko has in mind?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nope...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jefimenko's proposition is that Maxwell's equations are descriptive; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; causative. He maintains Maxwell's independent definitions of E and H and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assumes their properties are pretty much the same as has always been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; postulated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He shows that their causes are charges and the motion of charges. Since both
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E and H have the same root causes, this is why a time varying E is always
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; associated with a time varying H, and vice-versa.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, Jefimenko's work is &quot;equation rich&quot; and no one (that I know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of) has published any simplified versions with diagrams etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only other place to which I can point you would be Wikepedia. Search for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Jefimenko's Equations.&quot; This will at least show you the structure and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; layout of the equations.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this helps!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bill

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His equations don't look as useful as the Lienard-Wiechert potentials
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or E and B for a moving charge.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I hope this helps. There's lots more, and that's why I was &quot;ragging&quot; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Benj. Much of the &quot;stuff&quot; that he (and I) are interested in is covered by

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well put, Bill.  It's hard to get people to think about the physics
&gt; &gt; &gt; when they are only examined on the math.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The L-W potentials are derived using a 'small' volume filled with
&gt; &gt; &gt; electric fluid (popularly known as 'charge density').  The 'back' of
&gt; &gt; &gt; this volume reacts to the 'target' (field) point at a slightly
&gt; &gt; &gt; different time than the 'front', hence the retarded factor.

&gt; &gt; Who's point are you answering?

&gt; &gt; The back of the charge reacting to the observation point is just plain
&gt; &gt; stupid.

&gt; &gt; There is a retarded factor because the contributions to the potential
&gt; &gt; at an observation point for charges moving are different compared to
&gt; &gt; if the charges were static but at the same positions.

&gt; &gt; Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
&gt; &gt; and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
&gt; &gt; observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
&gt; &gt; is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
&gt; &gt; dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
&gt; &gt; the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
&gt; &gt; equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
&gt; &gt; increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Finally
&gt; &gt; &gt; the limit is taken of shrinking the volume to zero for a 'point'
&gt; &gt; &gt; charge.  Good luck trying to derive this result, ab initio, from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; defininition of a real point-particle, with no finite size, like the
&gt; &gt; &gt; electron.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; Yes, the factor is still there as the size tends towards zero for an

So...

It looks like we might have to actually read and analyze his work OURSELVES.

Of course, some have suggested that his work is not worthy of study because
he has not reduced it all to Lagrangians (or perhaps, Hamiltonians or maybe
some other ritualized requirement -- like holding the cruciform hilt of his
sword before him as he prays all night at the altar of peace for strength to
smite the unbeliever and suppress and terrify the peasantry.)

I think the scientific community has moved away from the idea that dB/
dt causes curlE and that dE/dt causes CurlB. Perhaps it's the
electrical engineers that are still stuck in the past, because of the
engineering textbooks that are recommended to them.

Page 262, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation by Head Marion, gives
Jefimenko's equations and states:

&quot;These generalised formulas make clear that, fundamentally, it is
charges and currents (moving charges) that produce electric and
magnetic fields.&quot;

Then further down they say:

&quot;From this view, neither field can cause the other (any more than one
component of E can cause another component). Rather BOTH fields are
cause by charges and currents&quot;

On page 428 ofIntroduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths, he derives
Jefimenko's equations and states them as being the &quot;Causual&quot; solution
to Maxwell's equations.

You cite, below, several powerful precedents to support your premise. I
sincerely wish your premise was true!

Please note, however, that we have already had at least two correspondants
on the &quot;Jefimenko Book Report&quot; thread vehemently defend the causal (or
casual as one poster put it) nature of E ---&gt; H and H ---&gt; E.

The fact is that this erroneous notion IS STILL BEING TAUGHT in virtually
every EM Physics classroom in the world. If you doubt this statement, please
Google &quot;Maxwell's Displacement Current&quot;. In amongst the junk, you'll find
*multiple* examples of university level lecture notes that are used by the
lecturers to &quot;prove&quot; that E causes H and H causes E. Some even include bogus
derivations and examples of &quot;lab experiments.&quot;

Please note that these are PHYSICS classes; not Engineering Classes.

&gt; &gt;&gt; OURSELVES.

&gt; &gt;&gt; #GASP#

&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, some have suggested that his work is not worthy of study
&gt; &gt;&gt; because
&gt; &gt;&gt; he has not reduced it all to Lagrangians (or perhaps, Hamiltonians or
&gt; &gt;&gt; maybe
&gt; &gt;&gt; some other ritualized requirement -- like holding the cruciform hilt of
&gt; &gt;&gt; his
&gt; &gt;&gt; sword before him as he prays all night at the altar of peace for strength
&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; smite the unbeliever and suppress and terrify the peasantry.)

&gt; &gt;&gt; Me? I'll take wisdom and sensibility no matter where and how I find it!

&gt; &gt;&gt; Bill Miller

&gt; &gt; I think the scientific community has moved away from the idea that dB/
&gt; &gt; dt causes curlE and that dE/dt causes CurlB.

&gt; You cite, below, several powerful precedents to support your premise. I
&gt; sincerely wish your premise was true!

&gt; Please note, however, that we have already had at least two correspondants
&gt; on the &quot;Jefimenko Book Report&quot; thread vehemently defend the causal (or
&gt; casual as one poster put it) nature of E ---&gt; H and H ---&gt; E.

&gt; The fact is that this erroneous notion IS STILL BEING TAUGHT in virtually
&gt; every EM Physics classroom in the world. If you doubt this statement, please
&gt; Google &quot;Maxwell's Displacement Current&quot;. In amongst the junk, you'll find
&gt; *multiple* examples of university level lecture notes that are used by the
&gt; lecturers to &quot;prove&quot; that E causes H and H causes E. Some even include bogus
&gt; derivations and examples of &quot;lab experiments.&quot;

&gt; Please note that these are PHYSICS classes; not Engineering Classes.

&gt; &gt;Perhaps it's the
&gt; &gt; electrical engineers that are still stuck in the past, because of the
&gt; &gt; engineering textbooks that are recommended to them.
&gt; &gt; Page 262, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation by Head Marion, gives
&gt; &gt; Jefimenko's equations and states:

&gt; &gt; &quot;These generalised formulas make clear that, fundamentally, it is
&gt; &gt; charges and currents (moving charges) that produce electric and
&gt; &gt; magnetic fields.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Then further down they say:

&gt; &gt; &quot;From this view, neither field can cause the other (any more than one
&gt; &gt; component of E can cause another component). Rather BOTH fields are
&gt; &gt; cause by charges and currents&quot;

&gt; &gt; On page 428 ofIntroduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths, he derives
&gt; &gt; Jefimenko's equations and states them as being the &quot;Causual&quot; solution
&gt; &gt; to Maxwell's equations.

&gt; Out of curiosity, could you please supply the publication dates of those
&gt; texts?

Thank you!

The first edition of Jefimenko's &quot;Causality...&quot; has a date of Sept 1, 1991.

I do not mean to imply that either of the above authors copied or otherwise
purloined Jefimenko's ideas -- with or without credit. In fact, I have
already mentioned one work that predates Jefimenko's publication by a couple
of decades.

Jefimenko seems to be the first to understand their importance and show how
their application leads to some startling conclusions.

You know that the turning of science into dogma and politics is one of
my major sore points. Jefimenko is really a minor case compared to say
Nikola Tesla who virtually invented the 20th century, yet right here
in a thread not too long ago someone was arguing that Tesla was a
&quot;Crank&quot; and unworthy to be recognized for any but a few minor ideas.
The attitude still persists to this day with most physics textbooks
never mentioning the name of Tesla and if they do it's with respect to
some minor tangential thing he did. The whole philosophy behind this
anti-science attitude is seen right here in the response to the
Jefimenko conversation. He is belittled, denigrated and called names
like &quot;crank&quot; by people who admit not even having read his books!  If
you try to discuss his IDEAS the conversation is quickly run off in a
tangential direction.

In MY vision of science ideas stand on their own merit. ANY idea is
examined by all. It matters not WHO proposed it. It is turned round
and round and acceptance is the result of SCIENTIFIC conclusions.
Sadly it seems that today, acceptance is only the result of what is PC
and what &quot;legitimate&quot; houses allow to be published. All else must be
ignored. THAT kind of thinking will really advance human civilization,
I'm sure.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.  But that would mean that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Gauss' law, which fails to distinguish E from Ek, is incorrect in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; presence of varying currents.  If that's true, wouldn't it be common
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge by now?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Up 'til now it has been masked by at least three issues. The first is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; idea that an E field can *cause* an H field. The second is that an H

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can *cause* an E field. The third is Lentz's law.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The first has been proven empirically false since no one has ever been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; able
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to measure the Magnetic field &quot;caused&quot; by Displacement Current.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The second has been masked by the assumption  that induction is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; magnetic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; effect when it is an interaction between the movement of charges as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; manifested by Ek.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The third has been *ignored*. This is Lentz's law, an interactive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; property
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that has remained unexplained/unexplainable since it was determined
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; empirically way back when. The equations that define Ek show how and why
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Lentz's law &quot;works&quot; the way it does.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't read Jefimenko's work, but I've come to the conclusion that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E of a charge moving in a charge distribution acts upon that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distribution which in turn acts back on the charge so creating an E
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with components parallel and normal to the charge's motion. That which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is normal to the charge's motion is interpteted as the B component
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because it does no work, that which is parallel is the E component
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because it does work. Is this similar to what Jefimenko has in mind?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nope...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jefimenko's proposition is that Maxwell's equations are descriptive; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; causative. He maintains Maxwell's independent definitions of E and H and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assumes their properties are pretty much the same as has always been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; postulated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He shows that their causes are charges and the motion of charges. Since both
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E and H have the same root causes, this is why a time varying E is always
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; associated with a time varying H, and vice-versa.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, Jefimenko's work is &quot;equation rich&quot; and no one (that I know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of) has published any simplified versions with diagrams etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only other place to which I can point you would be Wikepedia. Search for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Jefimenko's Equations.&quot; This will at least show you the structure and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; layout of the equations.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this helps!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bill

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His equations don't look as useful as the Lienard-Wiechert potentials
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or E and B for a moving charge.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I hope this helps. There's lots more, and that's why I was &quot;ragging&quot; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Benj. Much of the &quot;stuff&quot; that he (and I) are interested in is covered by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Jefimenko's work.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well put, Bill.  It's hard to get people to think about the physics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when they are only examined on the math.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The L-W potentials are derived using a 'small' volume filled with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electric fluid (popularly known as 'charge density').  The 'back' of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this volume reacts to the 'target' (field) point at a slightly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different time than the 'front', hence the retarded factor.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Who's point are you answering?

&gt; &gt; &gt; The back of the charge reacting to the observation point is just plain
&gt; &gt; &gt; stupid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a retarded factor because the contributions to the potential
&gt; &gt; &gt; at an observation point for charges moving are different compared to
&gt; &gt; &gt; if the charges were static but at the same positions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
&gt; &gt; &gt; and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
&gt; &gt; &gt; is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
&gt; &gt; &gt; dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
&gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
&gt; &gt; &gt; increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Finally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the limit is taken of shrinking the volume to zero for a 'point'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charge.  Good luck trying to derive this result, ab initio, from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defininition of a real point-particle, with no finite size, like the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electron.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, the factor is still there as the size tends towards zero for an
&gt; &gt; &gt; electron.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; Please learn to read. I wrote &quot;ab initio&quot; not &quot;tends towards zero&quot;.
&gt; &gt; This was my point that Maxwellian EM is based on extended charge
&gt; &gt; definitions not point charges; ah well, they just don't teach Latin
&gt; &gt; anymore.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; My derivation used 2 point charges to show that the (1 + B) factor is
&gt; independent of their seperation, dr. I didn't use extended charges.

Still awaiting your derivation.  All derivations of L-W I have seen
use a finite separation to generate a factor from the difference in
transmission times,
Is this what you have done?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He shows that their causes are charges and the motion of charges. Since both
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E and H have the same root causes, this is why a time varying E is always
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; associated with a time varying H, and vice-versa.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, Jefimenko's work is &quot;equation rich&quot; and no one (that I know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of) has published any simplified versions with diagrams etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only other place to which I can point you would be Wikepedia. Search for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Jefimenko's Equations.&quot; This will at least show you the structure and

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His equations don't look as useful as the Lienard-Wiechert potentials
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or E and B for a moving charge.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well put, Bill.  It's hard to get people to think about the physics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when they are only examined on the math.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The L-W potentials are derived using a 'small' volume filled with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electric fluid (popularly known as 'charge density').  The 'back' of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this volume reacts to the 'target' (field) point at a slightly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different time than the 'front', hence the retarded factor.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Who's point are you answering?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The back of the charge reacting to the observation point is just plain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stupid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a retarded factor because the contributions to the potential
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at an observation point for charges moving are different compared to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if the charges were static but at the same positions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Finally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the limit is taken of shrinking the volume to zero for a 'point'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charge.  Good luck trying to derive this result, ab initio, from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defininition of a real point-particle, with no finite size, like the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electron.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, the factor is still there as the size tends towards zero for an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electron.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; Please learn to read. I wrote &quot;ab initio&quot; not &quot;tends towards zero&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; This was my point that Maxwellian EM is based on extended charge
&gt; &gt; &gt; definitions not point charges; ah well, they just don't teach Latin
&gt; &gt; &gt; anymore.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; My derivation used 2 point charges to show that the (1 + B) factor is
&gt; &gt; independent of their seperation, dr. I didn't use extended charges.

&gt; Still awaiting your derivation.  All derivations of L-W I have seen
&gt; use a finite separation to generate a factor from the difference in
&gt; transmission times,
&gt; Is this what you have done?- Hide quoted text -

">

Yes, I am doing this. My crude derivation is further up the thread,
but I'll repeat it here:-
Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

The total potential is then q2/r2 + q1/(r2 + dr(1 + B)) which for
small dr and q1 = q2 can be written:

q/r2 + q/r2 (1 - dr(1 + B)/r2)

= 2q/r2 - q dr(1 + B)/r2^2 )

I'm not sure how to proceed further, since I was hoping to end up with
an expression 2q/(1 + B) r2. Maybe I've made an error some where...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ek= -dA/dt.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.  But that would mean that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Gauss' law, which fails to distinguish E from Ek, is incorrect in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; presence of varying currents.  If that's true, wouldn't it be common
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge by now?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Up 'til now it has been masked by at least three issues. The first is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; idea that an E field can *cause* an H field. The second is that an H
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; field
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can *cause* an E field. The third is Lentz's law.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The first has been proven empirically false since no one has ever been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; able
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to measure the Magnetic field &quot;caused&quot; by Displacement Current.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The second has been masked by the assumption  that induction is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; magnetic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; effect when it is an interaction between the movement of charges as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; manifested by Ek.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The third has been *ignored*. This is Lentz's law, an interactive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; property
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that has remained unexplained/unexplainable since it was determined
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; empirically way back when. The equations that define Ek show how and why
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Lentz's law &quot;works&quot; the way it does.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't read Jefimenko's work, but I've come to the conclusion that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E of a charge moving in a charge distribution acts upon that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distribution which in turn acts back on the charge so creating an E
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with components parallel and normal to the charge's motion. That which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is normal to the charge's motion is interpteted as the B component
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because it does no work, that which is parallel is the E component
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because it does work. Is this similar to what Jefimenko has in mind?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nope...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jefimenko's proposition is that Maxwell's equations are descriptive; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; causative. He maintains Maxwell's independent definitions of E and H and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assumes their properties are pretty much the same as has always been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; postulated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He shows that their causes are charges and the motion of charges. Since both
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E and H have the same root causes, this is why a time varying E is always
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; associated with a time varying H, and vice-versa.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, Jefimenko's work is &quot;equation rich&quot; and no one (that I know

&gt; = 2q/r2 - q dr(1 + B)/r2^2 )

&gt; I'm not sure how to proceed further, since I was hoping to end up with

I see.  You are offering a dipole model for a point particle; not
quite what I was expecting.  If your two charges have the same sign
how do you keep them at the same distance apart as they move, don't
'like' charges always repel?
It seems you have reduced L-W's charge-density 'cloud' to only two
raindrops.
I was asking for a proof that BEGAN with a single point charge, not
some limiting process which is how all classical EM tries to link to
the real world of electrons.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.  But that would mean that

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge by now?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Up 'til now it has been masked by at least three issues. The first is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; idea that an E field can *cause* an H field. The second is that an H
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; field
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can *cause* an E field. The third is Lentz's law.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The first has been proven empirically false since no one has ever been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; able
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to measure the Magnetic field &quot;caused&quot; by Displacement Current.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The second has been masked by the assumption  that induction is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; magnetic

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; manifested by Ek.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The third has been *ignored*. This is Lentz's law, an interactive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; property
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that has remained unexplained/unexplainable since it was determined
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; empirically way back when. The equations that define Ek show how and why
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Lentz's law &quot;works&quot; the way it does.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't read Jefimenko's work, but I've come to the conclusion that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E of a charge moving in a charge distribution acts upon that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distribution which in turn acts back on the charge so creating an E
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with components parallel and normal to the charge's motion. That which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is normal to the charge's motion is interpteted as the B component
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because it does no work, that which is parallel is the E component
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because it does work. Is this similar to what Jefimenko has in mind?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nope...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jefimenko's proposition is that Maxwell's equations are descriptive; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; causative. He maintains Maxwell's independent definitions of E and H and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assumes their properties are pretty much the same as has always been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; postulated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He shows that their causes are charges and the motion of charges. Since both
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E and H have the same root causes, this is why a time varying E is always
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; associated with a time varying H, and vice-versa.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, Jefimenko's work is &quot;equation rich&quot; and no one (that I know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of) has published any simplified versions with diagrams etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only other place to which I can point you would be Wikepedia. Search for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Jefimenko's Equations.&quot; This will at least show you the structure and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; layout of the equations.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this helps!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bill

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His equations don't look as useful as the Lienard-Wiechert potentials
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or E and B for a moving charge.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I hope this helps. There's lots more, and that's why I was &quot;ragging&quot; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Benj. Much of the &quot;stuff&quot; that he (and I) are interested in is covered by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Jefimenko's work.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks much for the reference,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well put, Bill.  It's hard to get people to think about the physics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when they are only examined on the math.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The L-W potentials are derived using a 'small' volume filled with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electric fluid (popularly known as 'charge density').  The 'back' of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this volume reacts to the 'target' (field) point at a slightly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different time than the 'front', hence the retarded factor.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Who's point are you answering?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The back of the charge reacting to the observation point is just plain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stupid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a retarded factor because the contributions to the potential
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at an observation point for charges moving are different compared to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if the charges were static but at the same positions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Finally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the limit is taken of shrinking the volume to zero for a 'point'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charge.  Good luck trying to derive this result, ab initio, from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defininition of a real point-particle, with no finite size, like the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electron.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, the factor is still there as the size tends towards zero for an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electron.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please learn to read. I wrote &quot;ab initio&quot; not &quot;tends towards zero&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This was my point that Maxwellian EM is based on extended charge
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitions not point charges; ah well, they just don't teach Latin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anymore.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My derivation used 2 point charges to show that the (1 + B) factor is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; independent of their seperation, dr. I didn't use extended charges.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Still awaiting your derivation.  All derivations of L-W I have seen
&gt; &gt; &gt; use a finite separation to generate a factor from the difference in
&gt; &gt; &gt; transmission times,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is this what you have done?- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; Yes, I am doing this. My crude derivation is further up the thread,
&gt; &gt; but I'll repeat it here:-
&gt; &gt; Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
&gt; &gt; and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
&gt; &gt; observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
&gt; &gt; is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
&gt; &gt; dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
&gt; &gt; the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
&gt; &gt; equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
&gt; &gt; increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

&gt; &gt; The total potential is then q2/r2 + q1/(r2 + dr(1 + B)) which for
&gt; &gt; small dr and q1 = q2 can be written:

&gt; &gt;   q/r2 + q/r2 (1 - dr(1 + B)/r2)

&gt; &gt; = 2q/r2 - q dr(1 + B)/r2^2 )

&gt; &gt; I'm not sure how to proceed further, since I was hoping to end up with
&gt; &gt; an expression 2q/(1 + B) r2. Maybe I've made an error some where...

&gt; I see.  You are offering a dipole model for a point particle; not
&gt; quite what I was expecting.
">

It's not a model for a point particle, just used to show that in the
limiting process as the point charges approach one another, the
retardation factor is still there and doesn't tend to zero. From this,
it follows that the retardation factor will be there for a point
charge also.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If your two charges have the same sign
&gt; how do you keep them at the same distance apart as they move, don't
&gt; 'like' charges always repel?
">

Yes, they will repel, as will a charge density of finite volume. You
can add a force that keeps the charges together, it's just superfluous
to the purpose of the derivation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It seems you have reduced L-W's charge-density 'cloud' to only two
&gt; raindrops.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt; Page 262, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation by Head Marion, gives
&gt;&gt; &gt; Jefimenko's equations and states:

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;These generalised formulas make clear that, fundamentally, it is
&gt;&gt; &gt; charges and currents (moving charges) that produce electric and
&gt;&gt; &gt; magnetic fields.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; Then further down they say:

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;From this view, neither field can cause the other (any more than one
&gt;&gt; &gt; component of E can cause another component). Rather BOTH fields are
&gt;&gt; &gt; cause by charges and currents&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; On page 428 ofIntroduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths, he derives
&gt;&gt; &gt; Jefimenko's equations and states them as being the &quot;Causual&quot; solution
&gt;&gt; &gt; to Maxwell's equations.

&gt;&gt; Out of curiosity, could you please supply the publication dates of those
&gt;&gt; texts?

Thanks! Do either of these texts also re-derive/define the Poynting Vector
using Jefimenko's Equations? If so, I'd sure love to see it!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E and H have the same root causes, this is why a time varying E is always
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; associated with a time varying H, and vice-versa.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, Jefimenko's work is &quot;equation rich&quot; and no one (that I know

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well put, Bill.  It's hard to get people to think about the physics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when they are only examined on the math.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The L-W potentials are derived using a 'small' volume filled with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electric fluid (popularly known as 'charge density').  The 'back' of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this volume reacts to the 'target' (field) point at a slightly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different time than the 'front', hence the retarded factor.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Who's point are you answering?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The back of the charge reacting to the observation point is just plain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stupid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a retarded factor because the contributions to the potential
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at an observation point for charges moving are different compared to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if the charges were static but at the same positions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Finally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the limit is taken of shrinking the volume to zero for a 'point'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charge.  Good luck trying to derive this result, ab initio, from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defininition of a real point-particle, with no finite size, like the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electron.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, the factor is still there as the size tends towards zero for an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electron.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please learn to read. I wrote &quot;ab initio&quot; not &quot;tends towards zero&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This was my point that Maxwellian EM is based on extended charge
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitions not point charges; ah well, they just don't teach Latin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anymore.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My derivation used 2 point charges to show that the (1 + B) factor is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; independent of their seperation, dr. I didn't use extended charges.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still awaiting your derivation.  All derivations of L-W I have seen
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use a finite separation to generate a factor from the difference in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transmission times,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is this what you have done?- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I am doing this. My crude derivation is further up the thread,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but I'll repeat it here:-
&gt; &gt; &gt; Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
&gt; &gt; &gt; and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
&gt; &gt; &gt; is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
&gt; &gt; &gt; dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
&gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
&gt; &gt; &gt; increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The total potential is then q2/r2 + q1/(r2 + dr(1 + B)) which for
&gt; &gt; &gt; small dr and q1 = q2 can be written:

&gt; &gt; &gt;   q/r2 + q/r2 (1 - dr(1 + B)/r2)

&gt; &gt; &gt; = 2q/r2 - q dr(1 + B)/r2^2 )

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure how to proceed further, since I was hoping to end up with
&gt; &gt; &gt; an expression 2q/(1 + B) r2. Maybe I've made an error some where...

&gt; &gt; I see.  You are offering a dipole model for a point particle; not
&gt; &gt; quite what I was expecting.

&gt; It's not a model for a point particle, just used to show that in the
&gt; limiting process as the point charges approach one another, the
&gt; retardation factor is still there and doesn't tend to zero. From this,
&gt; it follows that the retardation factor will be there for a point
&gt; charge also.

&gt; &gt;If your two charges have the same sign
&gt; &gt; how do you keep them at the same distance apart as they move, don't
&gt; &gt; 'like' charges always repel?

&gt; Yes, they will repel, as will a charge density of finite volume. You
&gt; can add a force that

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.  But that would mean that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Gauss' law, which fails to distinguish E from Ek, is incorrect in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; presence of varying currents.  If that's true, wouldn't it be common
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge by now?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Up 'til now it has been masked by at least three issues. The first is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; idea that an E field can *cause* an H field. The second is that an H
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; field
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can *cause* an E field. The third is Lentz's law.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The first has been proven empirically false since no one has ever been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; able
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to measure the Magnetic field &quot;caused&quot; by Displacement Current.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The second has been masked by the assumption  that induction is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; magnetic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; effect when it is an interaction between the movement of charges as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; manifested by Ek.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The third has been *ignored*. This is Lentz's law, an interactive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; property
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that has remained unexplained/unexplainable since it was determined
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; empirically way back when. The equations that define Ek show how and why
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Lentz's law &quot;works&quot; the way it does.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't read Jefimenko's work, but I've come to the conclusion that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E of a charge moving in a charge distribution acts upon that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distribution which in turn acts back on the charge so creating an E
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with components parallel and normal to the charge's motion. That which

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The back of the charge reacting to the observation point is just plain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stupid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a retarded factor because the contributions to the potential
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at an observation point for charges moving are different compared to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if the charges were static but at the same positions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Finally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the limit is taken of shrinking the volume to zero for a 'point'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charge.  Good luck trying to derive this result, ab initio, from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defininition of a real point-particle, with no finite size, like the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electron.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, the factor is still there as the size tends towards zero for an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electron.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please learn to read. I wrote &quot;ab initio&quot; not &quot;tends towards zero&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This was my point that Maxwellian EM is based on extended charge
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitions not point charges; ah well, they just don't teach Latin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anymore.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My derivation used 2 point charges to show that the (1 + B) factor is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; independent of their seperation, dr. I didn't use extended charges.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still awaiting your derivation.  All derivations of L-W I have seen
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use a finite separation to generate a factor from the difference in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transmission times,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is this what you have done?- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I am doing this. My crude derivation is further up the thread,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I'll repeat it here:-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The total potential is then q2/r2 + q1/(r2 + dr(1 + B)) which for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small dr and q1 = q2 can be written:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   q/r2 + q/r2 (1 - dr(1 + B)/r2)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; = 2q/r2 - q dr(1 + B)/r2^2 )

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure how to proceed further, since I was hoping to end up with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an expression 2q/(1 + B) r2. Maybe I've made an error some where...

&gt; &gt; &gt; I see.  You are offering a dipole model for a point particle; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; quite what I was expecting.

&gt; &gt; It's not a model for a point particle, just used to show that in the
&gt; &gt; limiting process as the point charges approach one another, the
&gt; &gt; retardation factor is still there and doesn't tend to zero. From this,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ek= -dA/dt.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.  But that would mean that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Gauss' law, which fails to distinguish E from Ek, is incorrect in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; presence of varying currents.  If that's true, wouldn't it be common
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge by now?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Up 'til now it has been masked by at least three issues. The first is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; idea that an E field can *cause* an H field. The second is that an H
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; field
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can *cause* an E field. The third is Lentz's law.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The first has been proven empirically false since no one has ever been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; able
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to measure the Magnetic field &quot;caused&quot; by Displacement Current.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The second has been masked by the assumption  that induction is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; magnetic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; effect when it is an interaction between the movement of charges as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; manifested by Ek.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The third has been *ignored*. This is Lentz's law, an interactive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; property
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that has remained unexplained/unexplainable since it was determined
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; empirically way back when. The equations that define Ek show how and why
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Lentz's law &quot;works&quot; the way it does.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't read Jefimenko's work, but I've come to the conclusion that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E of a charge moving in a charge distribution acts upon that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distribution which in turn acts back on the charge so creating an E
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with components parallel and normal to the charge's motion. That which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is normal to the charge's motion is interpteted as the B component
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because it does no work, that which is parallel is the E component
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because it does work. Is this similar to what Jefimenko has in mind?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nope...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jefimenko's proposition is that Maxwell's equations are descriptive; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; causative. He maintains Maxwell's independent definitions of E and H and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assumes their properties are pretty much the same as has always been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; postulated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He shows that their causes are charges and the motion of charges. Since both
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E and H have the same root causes, this is why a time varying E is always
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; associated with a time varying H, and vice-versa.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, Jefimenko's work is &quot;equation rich&quot; and no one (that I know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of) has published any simplified versions with diagrams etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only other place to which I can point you would be Wikepedia. Search for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Jefimenko's Equations.&quot; This will at least show you the structure and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; layout of the equations.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this helps!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His equations don't look as useful as the Lienard-Wiechert potentials
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or E and B for a moving charge.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I hope this helps. There's lots more, and that's why I was &quot;ragging&quot; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Benj. Much of the &quot;stuff&quot; that he (and I) are interested in is covered by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Jefimenko's work.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well put, Bill.  It's hard to get people to think about the physics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when they are only examined on the math.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The L-W potentials are derived using a 'small' volume filled with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electric fluid (popularly known as 'charge density').  The 'back' of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this volume reacts to the 'target' (field) point at a slightly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different time than the 'front', hence the retarded factor.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Who's point are you answering?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The back of the charge reacting to the observation point is just plain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stupid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a retarded factor because the contributions to the potential
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at an observation point for charges moving are different compared to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if the charges were static but at the same positions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Finally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the limit is taken of shrinking the volume to zero for a 'point'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charge.  Good luck trying to derive this result, ab initio, from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defininition of a real point-particle, with no finite size, like the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electron.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, the factor is still there as the size tends towards zero for an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electron.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still awaiting your derivation.  All derivations of L-W I have seen

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I am doing this. My crude derivation is further up the thread,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I'll repeat it here:-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take two charges q1 @r1, q2 @r2 with r1 &gt; r2, dr = r1 - r2, parallel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and both travelling at velocity v away from and along r1, r2. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observation point is at r = 0. The potential of q1 that arrives at q2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is from a retarded time t' = dr/(v + c). This is when q1 was at r2 +
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dr - vt' = r2 + dr - v dr/(v + c) = r2 + dr/(1 + B) where B = v/c. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the potential at the observation point can be replaced by an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent static q1 and q2 seperated by dr/(1 + B), equivalent to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; increasing the charge density by (1 + B) at r.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The total potential is then q2/r2 + q1/(r2 + dr(1 + B)) which for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small dr and q1 = q2 can be written:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   q/r2 + q/r2 (1 - dr(1 + B)/r2)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; = 2q/r2 - q dr(1 + B)/r2^2 )

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure how to proceed further, since I was hoping to end up with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an expression 2q/(1 + B) r2. Maybe I've made an error

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Page 262, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation by Head Marion, gives
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jefimenko's equations and states:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;These generalised formulas make clear that, fundamentally, it is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; charges and currents (moving charges) that produce electric and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; magnetic fields.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Then further down they say:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;From this view, neither field can cause the other (any more than one
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; component of E can cause another component). Rather BOTH fields are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cause by charges and currents&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; On page 428 ofIntroduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths, he derives
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jefimenko's equations and states them as being the &quot;Causual&quot; solution
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to Maxwell's equations.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Out of curiosity, could you please supply the publication dates of those
&gt; &gt;&gt; texts?

&gt; &gt; Classical Electromagnetic Radiation by Head Marion published 1994.

&gt; &gt; Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition) by David J.Griffiths
&gt; &gt; published 1998.

&gt; Thanks! Do either of these texts also re-derive/define the Poynting Vector
&gt; using Jefimenko's Equations? If so, I'd sure love to see it!

No, they just mention Jefimenko's equations in a small paragraph.
