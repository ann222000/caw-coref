Hello all!

I am writing to ask for cooperative assistance in what I feel is an
important matter. I hope that I am not breaking any rules on this list
with this posting. Feel free to forward this to anyone or anywhere it
may be of interest.

In Norway, We have a few wolves running free in the wild. We do not
have enough wolves as yet to support a healthy flock: genetically etc.
yet the authorities want to butcher 2/3 of that number. There are many
people who are against having any wolves at all in Norway.

The &quot;cull&quot; was originally officially planned to take place in early
February but there are now rumors that it will be done secretly before
the official time so we are no longer clear as to when this action
will be executed.

We who are against this are doing what we can here in Norway to
oppose this action in a sensible and responsible manner. The balance
of percentages between those for and those against the slaughter are
very close to even with those against leading by one percent or so.
The don't knows are around 18 percent.

Unfortunately the vested interests of industry seem to be on the side
that wants to destroy the wolves and they tend to carry more weight
than ordinary citizens who operate on a one man one vote system.

In order to counter this it is my belief that we need the support of
international opinion. You can help the Norwegian wolf to live by
simply by clicking on a button which will automatically send a letter
of protest to the relevant seats of power. Click on the link below! It
will take you directly to a page where you can do this.

Protest against the slaughter of the Norwegian wolves!

I have included a couple of links to impeccable sources which will
verify the veracity of my claim as well as an article written by Viggo
Ree of The Norwegian Carnivore and Raptor Society which will give you
some background information concerning the plight of these, necessary
and magnificent, animals in Norway. Both his virtual and his bricks
and mortar addresses are included.

For those who wish to formulate a few choice words of their own, you
can send in your letter of protest to one or more of the following
addresses. Just click on them to invoke a self addressed letter form.

They are the email accounts of an assortment of Norwegian people who
all have the power to make a difference. Several of them represent
political parties which are clearly in favor of the destruction of the
wolves in Norway.

Norway's Plan To Kill Wolves Decried

OSLO, Norway (AP) -- A growing wolf population in southern Scandinavia
has both farmers and conservationists howling in a conflict over
hunting the endangered species.

New York Times

Sweden's Welcome Friend Is Oslo's Big Bad Wolf - by WALTER GIBBS

&quot;SLO, Jan. 20 - Norwegian wildlife officials, who fend off yearly
protests against whaling and sealing, have announced a tentative plan
to shoot most of Norway's two dozen wolves.&quot;

Before we get to Viggo's article I would like to write a few words on
a point that has been brought up many times during the short time that
I have actively campaigned for the preservation of our wolves.

Many are positive to the idea of preserving our natural heritage, wolf
included but have one reservation concerning the fact that wolves do
kill sheep. Yes wolves do attack sheep sometimes. It would be strange
if they didn't.

The farmers in Norway do have a bit of a problem with this even though
they are paid by the government for every sheep they lose to the
wolves. We have a discussion going in Norway on alternative methods of
farming sheep.

The problem as I see it is that the Norwegian sheep farmers are almost
all amateurs or part timers. They have day jobs and let their sheep
graze freely in surrounding territories.

The sheep themselves have been bred over many generations with only
one criterion in mind: profit. They produce a lot of wool and meat.
They have been bred without any consideration to their ability to take
care of themselves. Thus profitability has been cultivated at the
expense of survival skills.

They fall into cracks and holes and can't get out. They can't
distinguish between food they can and cannot eat in the wild so many
die from eating poisonous plants. They are prone to a host of
sicknesses and so need quite a bit of antibiotic treatment.

They are in fact so physically weak that they cannot get up if the
proverbial rollover occurs and they find themselves on their backs.
They also display no will or ability to run or fight when threatened.

The only way that such animals can survive in the wild tracts of
nature, which is where these amateur farmers put their sheep to graze
untended by man or dog, is to kill most of the wild in nature. When
one considers the fact that a german sausage dog can easily kill a
sheep that means that there isn't much that can be tolerated in the
vicinity of domestic sheep.

There are older races of sheep. I don't know the English name but we
call them Villsau. They are closer to the wild form sheep once had.
They are more sure footed, form a circle and successfully defend
themselves against wolves, are not prone to as many diseases and can
distinguish between edible and poisonous plants. They even help one
another when the females are birthing.

Sounds fantastic huh? Well, to the sheep farmers it isn't because they
do not produce as much meat per sheep. They are not as easy to herd
about as domestic sheep and it would require that the shepherd was
actually on the job.

The wolf has been researched a lot in the last few years. It has been
discovered by a team of scientists who have followed wolves in Yellow
Stone park that when the wolves select a target and bring it down,
without fail it is either sick, old or somehow disabled. I saw a film
on this where they showed a hunt and inspected the remains after the
wolves were finished.

Though the wolves took down what seemed to be a strong healthy animal
(it ran right along with the rest of its herd and put up quite a fight
when the wolves finally managed to cut it out and began bringing it
down) when the remains were inspected it was found that it had a
disease in the marrow of its bones.

How the wolves can tell such a thing is beyond me but they are able to
and it is indeed their job to do such. They cull the herds and keep
them healthy.

Now, when they come across large numbers of domestic sheep, which
have been bred to be exactly what nature has not intended, it is not
strange that the wolves' red alert bells and buzzers go haywire as
their senses tell them that whole herds are prima cull material.

I believe that the present conflict between wolf and man is going on
because wolf is showing us the error of our ways. The animals we
create are not approved by nature's department of standards.

Our response to this is to do what we always do: ignore the message
and kill the messenger.

Here is the article by Viggo Ree of The Norwegian Carnivore and Raptor
Society. It has been and will continue to be updated. Those who wish
to read about the latest developments as well as view maps that will
give one a clearer picture of the geography of things can go to:

Latest news (25.1.01):

Dear wolf friends,

On behalf of the Norwegian Carnivore and Raptor Society I have written
an information article about the planned wolf hunt in Norway. The
article also gives some background data about the wolf's situation in
Scandinavia.

Since the hunt may start within a short time - may be this week - it
is important that this information is spread quickly to as many
organizations and persons as possible. I hope you will be able to help
us in this way. Please send me some information back about where this
article is forwarded and used.

Yours sincerely

Viggo Ree

INFORMATION REPORT

Roeyse, Norway 22. January 2001

NEARLY HALF OF ALL NORWEGIAN WOLVES
ARE PLANNED TO BE KILLED THIS WINTER

By Viggo Ree
Information adviser
The Norwegian Carnivore and Raptor Society

The Norwegian Carnivore and Raptor Society ( ) has
been asked - and wishes - to inform about the planned slaughter of
nearly half of all Norwegian wolves.

Background

The wolf is an endangered species in Norway - also in Sweden. During
most of the 20th century the species was on the brink of extinction,
but single individuals and pairs have, the whole time, been present
in Scandinavia: intermittently reproducing and forming sporadic packs.
A pack consists of a minimum of a mated pair and one cub.

The official numbers ranged between 5 and 15 individuals in
Scandinavia from the second world war until the 1980s. As from the
1960s Hedmark in SE-Norway became the most important wolf county in
our country (on the border to Co. Dalarna and Co. Varmland in Sweden).
In this border area wolves were shot in 1964 and 1965. The species was
protected in Sweden in 1966 and in Norway in 1973.

It is deemed probable that in the 1970s reproduction occurred in Co.
Hedmark, since a pack of 6-12 individuals was tracked in the
municipalities of Trysil and Aamot during ...

Hello all!

I'm looking for a drawing of a Badger (or Wolverine) in renaissance style.

Failing to find that, the drawing of a full set of paw prints (2 front, &amp; 2
rear) would be good.

This is for a banner, so a photo is less helpful than a drawing but I'm not
looking for a cartoon. I am looking for something serious and recognizable.

I would appreciate any help you all might have.

Thanks,

Rick

Hi Rick:

(1) In 1996 Luxembourg issued an Engraved stamp
showing a Badger. You can get a gif of the engraved
stamp at:

(2) Engraver Thomas Bewick (1753-1828) engraved a
picture of a badger c. 1790 (3.6 x 7 cm)
The engraving was first published in the second
(1791) edition of the Quadrupeds. It can be found at:

(3) The third engraving is unfortunately (in my opinion)
one of Badger Hunting (now outlawed in Britain).
&quot;Badger Hunting&quot; an engraving after the painting by
L. Beckmann, was published by Aldine, 1872.
Original Size: The image is 7 1/2&quot; x 9&quot; JPG at:

(4) There is a hand coloured 1791 engraving of a honey badger at:

I hope these are of some help to you.

The oldest badger picture I know is
15 th century from a French book of the hunt.

Unfortunately the badgers are barely recognisable!
