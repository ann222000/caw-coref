As previously noted (in the thread about Paul's wife getting scared),
Mary and I had virtually stopped doing this kind of flying for fear of
harming our (very expensive) engine.  A lively debate ensued as to
whether or not repeated high-to-low-to-high power applications would
wear out your engine any faster than would normal operations.

I eventually agreed that gradual power changes would not unduly harm
an air-cooled engine, and vowed that I would endeavor to practice this
most-important skill on our next flight.  And we did.

We were on a flight back from Galesburg, IL when I started the
procedure, and very gradually began a power reduction whilst in cruise
flight at 3500 feet.  I took a full minute to reduce the power to
idle, watching our (newly reinstalled) JPI EDM-700 engine analyzer for
signs of stress.

As RPMs dropped below 1000, the &quot;shock-cooling alarm&quot; suddenly went
off, flashing its dire warnings that EGTs had dropped beyond (and
faster) than recommended limits.  (I can't remember what the threshold
is for that alarm -- it's preset.)

This despite my most careful power reduction, which (obviously) wasn't
slow enough.

Since the damage (so to speak) had already been done, I continued the
descent toward an Illinois corn field.  With the harvest under way, I
had my choice of:

- Freshly harvested corn stubble, not plowed
- Freshly harvested crops, plowed dirt
- Unharvested corn or winter wheat

I opted for the corn stubble, as the stalks would hold the soil
together firmly and not present as much &quot;flip force&quot; to the landing
gear as the plowed or unharvested field.   I took it down to 200 AGL
before applying power and heading home, satisfied that we would have
survived and giving the farmer a nice show.

For you aircraft owners who do this regularly, how slowly do you
retard the throttle to prevent shock cooling?  (I know -- does shock
cooling really exist?  For purposes of this discussion, I'll pretend
that it does.)

Given that the power reduction must be incredibly gradual, do you feel
that this exercise is realistic?   There really is no chance to
simulate how you must &quot;suddenly&quot; find best glide speed (after your
engine has presumably just crapped out), since you're gradually
reducing your speed along with your power.   Or do you put the plane
into a shallow dive as you reduce power, so as not to lose airspeed?

It's funny -- as renters we practiced this all the time.  Now, after 9
years of ownership, we haven't practiced it in ages -- and didn't even
realize this lack until Shirl's comments in Paul's thread.  Another
good thing about &quot;belonging&quot; to this newsgroup...

What happens when you do a normal pattern? Given your explaination, I would
assume that you get a shock cooling alarm everytime you do power reductions
as part of a normal landing. If not, use the same technique at altitude to
get into a power idle glide.

I don't have any engine analyzer. But, on a normal approach, I will reduce
throttle in two or three steps to get to 15&quot; or 16&quot;. That supports my
minimum, flaps up, holding altitude speed. Then, with gear out and flaps
down, I'm descending on extended downwind, base and final, with the power
gradually coming off to flare. (I'm not describing this as the ideal
technique. I'm stating it so that others can say - &quot;Are you crazy! That
technique is an engine killer.&quot;)

Engine out practice for me is very similar. From cruise, reduce throttle in
a couple of steps to 15&quot;. Maintain altitude. Then gradually pull off power
pitching over to maintain best glide. You're right, it's all very methodical
and does not present a sudden engine loss scenario. Maybe only do that once
or twice a year. For me, the engine out practice is all about picking the
spot and making it without power. Practicing that without instaneous loss of
engine power still has a lot of value.

Now, in my Lake, I've got other concerns. Several times a year and during
every annual insurance checkride, a sudden loss of engine power on takeoff
is a required demonstrated skill. With a top-mounted, pusher engine, in a
takeoff configuration, close to the ground, sudden engine loss and anything
but immediate response is deadly. The sudden loss of nose down thrust will
cause pitch up at a speed already close to stall with not much altitude to
recover. An immediate (and I mean immediate) push over is absolutely
critical. Critical enough that practice is necessary regardless of any harm
it might be doing to the engine.

So, for me, the engine-out on takeoff gets me practice responding quickly.
The more gradual throttle to idle and then a practice off-field approach
completes the scenario.

Hey, if you're worried, go rent a plane that will glide in a similar
manner, and take a good instructor too.

The issue with shock cooling isn't the rate of cooling per se, but
rather stress induced by differential cooling.  Most engines see far
higher temperature differentials during start-up than they do during
cooldown.  Jay, have you timed your engine heat up rate?  It would be
interesting to watch how fast your engine heats up from say a 50 degree
cold start and then compare that to the cool-down rate when you pull the
throttle for engine out practice.  I'm assuming this would be fairly
trivial with your engine analyzer.

I'm not sure what your normal operating temps are, but I assume it is a
much larger delta between ambient and your normal operating temps than
between your normal operating temps and the temps you see during a glide
at idle.  I also suspect that the rate of heat-up during take-off is at
least as high as the rate of cooling during an idle glide.  However, it
would be very interesting to see the data if you are inclined to collect
it some day.

Most flight schools practice engine out emergencies frequently, even on
high performance aircraft. The engines typically make it to TBO.

The things that seem to shorten engine life have little to do with
shock cooling. The biggest factor seems to be how much the engine is
used.

If the engine is flown in accordance with the manual, you should not
have any problems with shock cooling.

Actually, I think it is the rate of cooling *and* the differential

willing to bet $25K on it?  Nope.

Therefore, I fly as if it exists.

I'm not an expert, but it seems to me that the important thing is to
reduce airspeed immediately when reducing power. It's the wind
whistling through an idling engine at 140 knots that's going to do
some serious shock cooling.

I have an 0-320, and we probably take 3-5 seconds to smoothly retard the
throttle to idle during simulated engine failure practice. Thinking back
to the *actual* engine failure due to oil loss, the time elapsed between
seeing no oil pressure on the gauge, the initial obvious signs that the
engine was seizing (bucking and shaking), and the time it quit
completely was probably a total of 10 seconds. So comparing the
simulated engine failure to THAT type of actual engine failure, taking 5
seconds to retard the throttle is NOT out of the realm of realism or
accuracy with regard to simulated practice.

To Jay, do you monitor your engine analyzer when you go from cruise
power into the pattern and then pull the throttle back during your
approach? How gradually do you pull power back there, and how do the
temps on the analyzer compare to what you did in the simulated
engine-out practice?

Yep.  The shock-cooling alarm never goes off during a regular
approach, because of the gradual nature of things.   By the time we
enter downwind, we've got the prop and mixture full forward, and are
adjusting manifold pressure (throttle) only slightly to control
airspeed.  We're looking for 100 mph/90 knots on downwind.

This wind-down from cruise speed (160 mph/140 knots) usually takes
several minutes, unless we're being asked to keep our speed up at a
controlled field.  We generally carry power into the flare (hey, it's
a Cherokee, and a nose-heavy one at that), slowly retarding power as
we touch down.

Apparently this procedure (which we do without thinking about it) is
engine-friendly enough to keep the temperature rate-of-decline outside
of the shock cooling alarm's parameters.

In the future I think we'll practice slow flight (which mimics this
whole engine management procedure) before practicing engine-out
stuff.   That should prevent the whole shock-cooling problem,
methinks.

Yes, that is what I said originally.  It is differential cooling that
causes the problem, not the rate of cooling itself.  If you could cool
the entire engine uniformly, I don't think it would matter much how fast
you cooled it.

It isn't the rate itself that causes a problem, it is the difference in
rates from one location to another.  However, I still think that the
greatest thermally induced stress occurs during the initial heat-up from
a cold start, but I don't have any data to confirm that and I don't have
an instrument airplane with which to collect the data.

A slow reduction in power setting certainly isn't realistic. I've had a few
power failures in my time (all in twins) and in every case the loss was
fairly sudden. I've never run out of fuel, but I have run a tank almost dry
on purpose, and the associated coughing and sputtering gave me plenty of
warning.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As previously noted (in the thread about Paul's wife getting scared),
&gt; Mary and I had virtually stopped doing this kind of flying for fear of
&gt; harming our (very expensive) engine.  A lively debate ensued as to
&gt; whether or not repeated high-to-low-to-high power applications would
&gt; wear out your engine any faster than would normal operations.

&gt; I eventually agreed that gradual power changes would not unduly harm
&gt; an air-cooled engine, and vowed that I would endeavor to practice this
&gt; most-important skill on our next flight.  And we did.

&gt; We were on a flight back from Galesburg, IL when I started the
&gt; procedure, and very gradually began a power reduction whilst in cruise
&gt; flight at 3500 feet.  I took a full minute to reduce the power to
&gt; idle, watching our (newly reinstalled) JPI EDM-700 engine analyzer for
&gt; signs of stress.

&gt; As RPMs dropped below 1000, the &quot;shock-cooling alarm&quot; suddenly went
&gt; off, flashing its dire warnings that EGTs had dropped beyond (and
&gt; faster) than recommended limits.  (I can't remember what the threshold
&gt; is for that alarm -- it's preset.)

&gt; This despite my most careful power reduction, which (obviously) wasn't
&gt; slow enough.

&gt; Since the damage (so to speak) had already been done, I continued the
&gt; descent toward an Illinois corn field.  With the harvest under way, I
&gt; had my choice of:

&gt; - Freshly harvested corn stubble, not plowed
&gt; - Freshly harvested crops, plowed dirt
&gt; - Unharvested corn or winter wheat

&gt; I opted for the corn stubble, as the stalks would hold the soil
&gt; together firmly and not present as much &quot;flip force&quot; to the landing
&gt; gear as the plowed or unharvested field.   I took it down to 200 AGL
&gt; before applying power and heading home, satisfied that we would have
&gt; survived and giving the farmer a nice show.

&gt; For you aircraft owners who do this regularly, how slowly do you
&gt; retard the throttle to prevent shock cooling?  (I know -- does shock
&gt; cooling really exist?  For purposes of this discussion, I'll pretend
&gt; that it does.)

&gt; Given that the power reduction must be incredibly gradual, do you feel
&gt; that this exercise is realistic?   There really is no chance to
&gt; simulate how you must &quot;suddenly&quot; find best glide speed (after your
&gt; engine has presumably just crapped out), since you're gradually
&gt; reducing your speed along with your power.   Or do you put the plane
&gt; into a shallow dive as you reduce power, so as not to lose airspeed?

&gt; It's funny -- as renters we practiced this all the time.  Now, after 9
&gt; years of ownership, we haven't practiced it in ages -- and didn't even
&gt; realize this lack until Shirl's comments in Paul's thread.  Another
&gt; good thing about &quot;belonging&quot; to this newsgroup...

Slow flight might increase the problem.  You're mushing along with poor
flow through the cowling, low airspeed and using power...perhaps you're
going to increase engine temp. over cruise.

As for the analyzer warning.  I had one on my 182 when hauling jumpers.
Just pushing the nose over at the top of the climb *without reducing
power* would result in a &quot;shock cooling&quot; alarm, just the increase in
airspeed created a cooling rate that exceeds the limits. I quickly
learned to ignore the shock cooling warning.

Trainer aircraft are flown hard all the time.  Students/renters cram the
power in on takeoff and yank it to idle on downwind time after time.
Those engines last well.

I flew jumpers for 17 years in 182s and 206s.  With the exception of one
airplane flown by an idiot (this guy would cram the power in right after
start with no warmup) we didn't have to replace cylinders, engines went
TBO or beyond.

From my experience more damage is done on power increases than
reduction.  Be as gentle as you can to your engine but don't go crazy
about the shock cooling thing.

Jay, the cylinder barrels on your engine are steel with air-cooling fins
attached.  Your pistons and cylinder heads are aluminum alloy.  The two
metals will expand and contract at different rates when heated or cooled.
Think about the way the thermostat in your house works. A bi-metal strip
(strip of metal composed of one type of metal on one side and another type
on the other), when heated or cooled bends because of the different
expansion rates of the two metals.  When I think of shock cooling I think of
the sudden removal of the heat source (abrupt power reduction) along with
the different metals contraction rate (steel with air blowing over it's
cooling fins versus aluminum inside the barrel with hot oil being sprayed on
it).  It is easy for me to visualize the scuffing that can occur because of
the reduced clearances as the barrel contracts onto the piston.  The same in
reverse would hold true for shock heating.

Whether any of this is true I don't know, but I am with you that gradual
increase or reduction of power seems less likely to cause damage to an
aircooled engine.

Lycoming says otherwise:
http://www.lycoming.textron.com/support/tips-advice/key-reprints/pdfs...

&lt;Lycoming&gt;
Sudden cooling is detrimental to the good health of the piston aircraft
engine. Lycoming Service Instruction 1094D recommends a maximum
temperature change of 50° F per minute to avoid shock-cooling of the
cylinders.

Operations that tend to induce rapid engine cooldown are
often associated with a fast letdown and return to the field after
dropping parachutists or a glider tow. There are occasions when Air
Traffic Control also calls for fast descents that may lead to sudden
cooling.

The engine problems that may be expected when pilots consistently
make fast letdowns with little or no power include:

1. Excessively worn ring grooves accompanied by broken rings.
2. Cracked cylinder heads.
3. Warped exhaust valves.
4. Bent pushrods.
5. Spark plug fouling.
&lt;/Lycoming&gt;

Be aware that &quot;powerplant management guru Kas Thomas&quot; won't buy you a
new engine if you happen do damage yours by following his recomendations.

It's every operator's choice whether he prefers to believe the engine
manufactorer or some guru.

You have no evidence that following Lycoming's recommendations avoids
the mythical shock cooling demon or that it lengthens engine life.  My
experience is that the engines that are run the hardest also last the
longest.  I'm basing this on everything from chainsaws to lawnmowers to
motorcycles to cars to trucks to off-road heavy equipment (dozers,
skidders, etc.) to airplanes (trainers, air taxi operations, cargo).

I'm personally not convinced that Lycoming's recommendations lengthen
engine life.

&gt; Jay, have you timed your engine heat up rate?  It would be interesting to
&gt; watch how fast your engine heats up from say a 50 degree cold start and
&gt; then compare that to the cool-down rate when you pull the throttle for
&gt; engine out practice.  I'm assuming this would be fairly trivial with your

I'm pretty sure that the rate of heating  of the metal of the head is not
the big issue, according to the shock cooling proponents.

Instead, it is the heads (and cylinders) cooling more rapidly than the
pistons, and the hot pistons (not able to be cooled as rapidly) against the
cooler cylinders (the cylinders do not have heat instrumentation, so the
closest thing they can do is to measure is the head temperatures) causing a
reduction in the tolerances between the piston and the cylinder walls, thus
causing possible scuffing and abnormal wear.

At least that is my take on what they say.

My O-320 had 2 cracked cylinders (both on the left side) at the same
time.  This was the year after the exhaust stud hold cracked on
the right front cylinder.  Shock cooling?  More likely due to the fact
that these were cermichromed cylinders with an unknown number
of hours on them before they cracked at &lt;600hours SMOH.

By implication, a fast cooling rate would cause *more* differential cooling,
since the cylinders cool from the fins inward. The faster the cooling, the
higher the delta-T between the internal and external surfaces of the
cylinders. The higher the delta, the more internal stresses on the cylinders
due to the different growth between the hot and cold surfaces.

But you already knew that and were just being difficult, eh?

It is a subtle point maybe, but an important one.  It isn't the rate of
cooling that matters.  It is a difference in rate between two locations.
Faster cooling doesn't necessarily a greater differential, it all
depends on how the cooling is done.

In some materials and at some temperatures, the rate of cooling can
change the fundamental material properties.  That is a different issue
than what is involved with engines.

It seems to me that upon engine start the pistons would heat up much
faster than the cylinders causing the same net affect as cooling down
the cylinders faster once hot.  Either way the pistons are hotter than
the cylinders.

Why would the cylinders heat up faster?  Only the very top of the
cylinder is in constant contact with the combustion heat whereas the top
of the piston is entirely in contact.  As you go down the cylinder away
from the head, the cylinder spends less and less time in contact with
the combustion heat and thus will be cooler.
