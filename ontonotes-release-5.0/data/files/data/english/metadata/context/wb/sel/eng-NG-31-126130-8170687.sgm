I am going to see SiCKO this week.  Krugman makes many points which have
been repeated over and over again.  We spend a lot more than any other
civilized country and we don't live any longer than people in France,
England, Japan, Canada or even Cuba.  The other thing which rarely gets any
mention is that our current health care system puts us at a disadvantage in
the global economy.  It's part of the reason why the Big Three are hurting
so much.

Health Care Terror

By PAUL KRUGMAN

Published: July 9, 2007

These days terrorism is the first refuge of scoundrels. So when British
authorities announced that a ring of Muslim doctors working for the National
Health Service was behind the recent failed bomb plot, we should have known
what was coming.

&quot;National healthcare: Breeding ground for terror?&quot; read the on-screen
headline, as the Fox News host Neil Cavuto and the commentator Jerry Bowyer
solemnly discussed how universal health care promotes terrorism.

While this was crass even by the standards of Bush-era political discourse,
Fox was following in a long tradition. For more than 60 years, the
medical-industrial complex and its political allies have used scare tactics
to prevent America from following its conscience and making access to health
care a right for all its citizens.

I say conscience, because the health care issue is, most of all, about
morality.

That's what we learn from the overwhelming response to Michael Moore's
&quot;Sicko.&quot; Health care reformers should, by all means, address the anxieties
of middle-class Americans, their growing and justified fear of finding
themselves uninsured or having their insurers deny coverage when they need
it most. But reformers shouldn't focus only on self-interest. They should
also appeal to Americans' sense of decency and humanity.

What outrages people who see &quot;Sicko&quot; is the sheer cruelty and injustice of
the American health care system - sick people who can't pay their hospital
bills literally dumped on the sidewalk, a child who dies because an
emergency room that isn't a participant in her mother's health plan won't
treat her, hard-working Americans driven into humiliating poverty by medical
bills.

&quot;Sicko&quot; is a powerful call to action - but don't count the defenders of the
status quo out. History shows that they're very good at fending off reform
by finding new ways to scare us.

These scare tactics have often included over-the-top claims about the
dangers of government insurance. &quot;Sicko&quot; plays part of a recording Ronald
Reagan once made for the American Medical Association, warning that a
proposed program of health insurance for the elderly - the program now known
as Medicare - would lead to totalitarianism.

Right now, by the way, Medicare - which did enormous good, without leading
to a dictatorship - is being undermined by privatization.

Mainly, though, the big-money interests with a stake in the present system
want you to believe that universal health care would lead to a crushing tax
burden and lousy medical care.

Now, every wealthy country except the United States already has some form of
universal care. Citizens of these countries pay extra taxes as a result -
but they make up for that through savings on insurance premiums and
out-of-pocket medical costs. The overall cost of health care in countries
with universal coverage is much lower than it is here.

Meanwhile, every available indicator says that in terms of quality, access
to needed care and health outcomes, the U.S. health care system does worse,
not better, than other advanced countries - even Britain, which spends only
about 40 percent as much per person as we do.

Yes, Canadians wait longer than insured Americans for elective surgery. But
over all, the average Canadian's access to health care is as good as that of
the average insured American - and much better than that of uninsured
Americans, many of whom never receive needed care at all.

And the French manage to provide arguably the best health care in the world,
without significant waiting lists of any kind. There's a scene in &quot;Sicko&quot; in
which expatriate Americans in Paris praise the French system. According to
the hard data they're not romanticizing. It really is that good.

All of which raises the question Mr. Moore asks at the beginning of &quot;Sicko&quot;:
who are we?

&quot;We have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals; we know
now that it is bad economics.&quot; So declared F.D.R. in 1937, in words that
apply perfectly to health care today. This isn't one of those cases where we
face painful tradeoffs - here, doing the right thing is also cost-efficient.
Universal health care would save thousands of American lives each year,
while actually saving money.

So this is a test. The only things standing in the way of universal health
care are the fear-mongering and influence-buying of interest groups. If we
can't overcome those forces here, there's not much hope for America's
future.
