Hi, I am new to this group and really need some help! I adopted a 9
year old Cockatoo on Sunday who obviously had been abused and mal
nourished. He is so scared, not moving around a lot and barely touched
anything to eat. The person who owned him before fed him nothing but
seeds, and of course over time I'll get him on a better diet. But for
now, I'll even settle if he would just eat seeds! He hasn't gone to
his food or water bowl yet. I've hand fed him and gotten him to take a
few sunflower seeds...and he did lick some peanut butter offf my hand.
All he does is sit in one spot and not much more than that. I know
he's terrified and it will take some time, but any suggestions for
settling him in would be greatly appreciated.

Patience.  Truly, a couple of my budgies were paralyzed with fear when
we first got them.   They would huddle in one spot on the perches and
I wouldn't see them access food or water.  He will come around.  Your
presence in the room as you whistle, sing and move slowly about will
help him see that he's in a friendly environment.  Don't be surprised
if he stealthly sneaks down to the seed cup when you're not looking.
It has to be very stressful for him to have to adapt to a completely
new environment after 9 years!   Offer him some spray millet from your
hand, to let him know you're a friend, and he'll be off and running
very soon.  Patience.

I concur. The little guy has had a major upheaval; everything he knows and
what little security he had in a horrid situation about has vanished. The
cockatoo needs to have time to get his bearings and begin to feel safe. It
sounds like he will come around, but do what Starlight said: be around him,
talk to him, offer companionship, and continue to offer treats.

If you have a digital camera, I would love to see a picture of him. Don't
post the pictures directly here, but upload them to a hosting site like
www.tinypics.com , then post the link to the pictures on the newsgroup.

What kind of 'Too is he? It sounds like the best thing that could of
happened to him is your willingness to take over his ownership.

Hi Dave and Becky!
Thank you very much for the advice. He is an Umbrella Cockatoo and
he's the sweetest thing in the world! He may have had a broken right
wing at some point, because now it looks to me like it quivers just on
that side..maybe some nerve damage? I have no idea how some people can
even live with themselves after harming any animal, and this is just
breaking my heart to know what he's been through, or even imagine. He
wouldn't take the millet, but licked some peanut butter off my finger.
Of course, I don't want to give him too much of that! My experience
has been with dogs and cats and I know that cats can starve themselves
to death, but never knew a bird could. Of course this scares me and
maybe I'm just being an overprotective mom. His name was Jules, but I
changed it to "Jewels" because this baby is truly a gem. Would you
believe he never had a shower or bath? I've got my work cut out for
me! I work from home so spending time with him is not an issue. He
does now "step up" even though he was never taught, but it's the
eating I'm concerned about. I've tried veggies, fruits, pellets,
seeds, steak, chicken and anything else I can think of...all he took
was the peanut butter! I saw the cage he lived in for 9 years and it
would break your heart. Not even 1 toy! He's a bit of a plucker, but
not too bad. No wonder..he had nothing else to do! I gave him a few
toys but of course he has no clue what to do with them. I wish I could
wave a magic wand and make everything ok right now, but of course, I
know about patience..although with the lack of experience with birds,
I'm concerned. I'm going to try to get my husband to take his picture!
Keep sending those suggestions if you can...Thanks again!

How's he doing noise wise?

That could be a lot of things.  I'd normally suggest taking him ASAP to
an avian vet.  However, at the moment that would probably be too
traumatic.  Just keep an eye out for any changes.  If he starts to fluff
himself up then off to the vet ASAP.

Try not to look at it that way.  Think of how lucky he is to have found you!

As has been said, birds are very sneaky and unless recognizing you as a
friend will try not to do something as vulnerable as eating.  I'd
suggest that you eat in his presence as much as possible.  Even if he
isn't prepared to eat at the same time, he will learn that you trust him.

I think you may be trying too hard.  He needs to get used to his new
environment and to you.  It's a bit unfair to expect him to change his
diet as well.

As he likes peanut butter, before you let him have some more, let him
see you eating it.  Then try peanut butter and, say, grapes.  Don't be
too disheartened though if it takes a long time.

One trick you can try is to play with the toys yourself.  That way he'll
know that it is fun and also what to do with it.  Also, when you give it
to him, he will see that you are a friend.

It's quite good fun anyway :-)

Have you taken him for a vet check? You need to do that first. If he is 9 he
may well have had more than one previous owner. Too's are probably the most
common bird to see have multiple homes. Many people buy one, then find out
they had NO IDEA what they were in for. It will take lots of time, and have
an Avian Vet check him over good. When he gets to feeling better you will
know as he will vibrate the walls with his voice.

You are meeting his immediate priority needs, so don't worry. YOU ARE DOING
THE RIGHT THING:
-- You are letting him develop trust and you are not violating his
razor-thin feeling of security by trying to be grabby, or forcing him to
deal with new demands .
-- You are providing companionship, and it is a tremendously positive sign
that he is willing to come to you and step up.
-- You are providing a range of food, and it is okay right now that he seems
ultra picky, 'cause I doubt that Jewels' previous owner ever exposed him to
fruits and veggies.

Keep doing what you are doing for now. Let Jewels continue to set the pace.

'Toos are highly social birds, which make them great human companions, if
the human is a decent person.

Many Toos ADORE being held and cuddled and scritched, and the more the
better. They are cuddle sponges, which can lead to negative consequences for
both the owner and the 'Too. It is easy for a 'too to be inadvertantly
'trained' to demand to be held whenever -- and for as long as -- he wants.
By not meeting the demands, the 'too can become despondent or destructive,
or both; screaming and feather plucking are two examples of this.

As hard as it may be, especially right now when Jewels has a past history of
neglect, you do not pick up and hold Jewels as often as he seems to want.
Think a bit about when during the day and evening you would have or will
make time for holding and scritching. Focus your efforts to encourage
Jewels -- during those times -- to come to you for holding. Keep his cage in
a safe area near the action where he can see the goings on of daily life.
You can provide plenty of toys and other diversions (radio, TV, paper to
shred, a seperate play gym and stand,etc) to help him learn how to
positively occupy himself. Wait a while before you add new things to the
cage, and do not introduce too many things at one time; the idea is to not
overwhelm Jewels. Let him acclimate before adding additional stuff. Like any
intelligent creature, Jewels may need to learn how to play after being
neglected.

As to food, keep supplying various fruits and vegetables. Provide the same
two or three choices until you notice that he is chowing them down. Right
now he may be suspicious of the new foods, so let him become acclimated to
the new offerings. Since he likes peanut butter, we know that he's going to
get enough protein, along with the seeds.

Let Jewels watch your family eat. After a few days, try offering some of
what you are eating while he's observing.

As for baths and showers, it is possible that he might not like the idea of
getting wet that way. In a week or so, try placing a shallow bowel of water
on the bottom of his cage.

A good book to read is "Guide to a Well-Behaved Parrot". It is in its second
edition, and will be of tremendous help. You can find it here on Amazon:
http://tinyurl.com/2eob9k The author, Mattie Athan, also wrote another good
book, "Guide to Companion Parrot Behavior", which would be well worth
purchasing.

Judy:  You've gotten a lot of very good advice and recommendations so
far.  Time, patience, perseverance ... take things slowly and calmly and
I'm sure that in a very short while, Jewels will start to look at you as
his trusted friend and best buddy.  You should be very pleased that he's
already taken food from your hands after such a short time.  It's a
wonderful start.  As was already suggested, a thorough check-up at the
avian vet would be in Jewels' best interest and will also put to rest
any concerns you may have about his overall health.  It's an excellent
idea to forge a good relationship with an avian vet because, just as
cats and dogs need medical intervention (check-ups, vaccinations,
emergency visits, etc), so do our pet birds.  You'll also get advice on
diet and nutrition which will help you keep Jewels in optimum health.

I've taken in many "throw-away" birds over the years, mostly budgies and
lovebirds, and with a lot of patience and even more TLC, many of these
birds who came to me wild and unruly have become reasonably tame,
although several of them are still flighty and won't allow too much
interaction.  One particular bird, a lutino peachface hen, was a terror
for the longest time and almost impossible to touch, but after three
years of working with her, she now allows me to handle her and we've
become pretty good friends.  In the early 1970s,  in addition to a
blue-fronted Amazon, I owned three sulphur-crested cockatoos and the
'toos were, by far, the most outgoing, animated (okay, somewhat loud!)
and intelligent birds I've ever owned.  So you're in for a big treat
with Jewels, of this I am sure!

I wish you the best of luck with Jewels and I'm truly hoping that this
is the beginning of a long and wonderful relationship.  Let us know how
things go.

Judy:  Another idea that might be helpful in the "food department" for
Jewels ... there's a Yahoo group called Feeding Feathers which discusses
food- and nutrition-related topics.  This mailing list is a good source
of information about how and what to feed our pet birds and often
discusses subjects as supplements and vitamins, holistic approaches to
feeding and health matters, etc.  Right now try not to get too
discouraged about Jewels' poor eating habits.  With a lot of patience
and trial-and-error, he will most likely start to eat more "healthy",
but this will take a fair amount of time considering his past life.  A
poster mentioned that it's a great idea to eat in Jewels' presence and I
totally agree.  Birds are curious creatures and want to try new things
especially if it involves food.  I'm sure that once Jewels settles in
more and more, he'll start to show a renewed interest in different
foodstuffs.  By the way, in my previous post I forgot to say that you're
doing a marvelous job so far.  It really warms my heart to know that
Jewels has found his "forever home" with you and your husband.

&gt; food- and nutrition-related topics.  This mailing list is a good source
&gt; of information about how and what to feed our pet birds and often
&gt; discusses subjects as supplements and vitamins, holistic approaches to
&gt; feeding and health matters, etc.  Right now try not to get too
&gt; discouraged about Jewels' poor eating habits.  With a lot of patience
&gt; and trial-and-error, he will most likely start to eat more &quot;healthy&quot;,
&gt; but this will take a fair amount of time considering his past life.  A
&gt; poster mentioned that it's a great idea to eat in Jewels' presence and I
&gt; totally agree.  Birds are curious creatures and want to try new things
&gt; especially if it involves food.  I'm sure that once Jewels settles in
&gt; more and more, he'll start to show a renewed interest in different
&gt; foodstuffs.  By the way, in my previous post I forgot to say that you're
&gt; doing a marvelous job so far.  It really warms my heart to know that
&gt; Jewels has found his &quot;forever home&quot; with you and your husband.

I just want to thank all of you SO MUCH for all the wonderful advice
and I will implement everything you told me immediately! I know I have
a wonderful bird to work with and not only is he lucky to have gotten
away from that horrible man, I am feeling extremely fortunate to have
found him. You taught me some wonderful things here and I'll keep you
posted! If you think of anything else, send it along! I'm always
willing to learn! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!
By the way....I got the shock of my life tonight...I told Jewels to
"step up" (like I told you before, the previous owner never taught him
that) and guess what???? HE said "Step Up" and then did it!!! Is this

The large Parrots are VERY intelligent, and have a long memory. In the wild
this serves them well, they remember where food can be found, and what to be
aware of. In the home this can be good and bad. The intelligence can lead to
them learning to "work" their owners for one. Many of us joke about how we
are owned by the bird because of this. &lt;G&gt;. As I mentioned it's very
probable that the guy you got him from was not the only owner. He may have
been taught to step up before, and remembers it. It also means he will
remember past abuse and problems which is why it can take quite some time to
change things. The fact that you can offer food and not end up with bad
bites is a very good sign. One of the worst bites my wife ever got was from
a "tame" U2. As the bird gets more accustomed to you that intelligence can
become a problem if you are not prepared. The bird should outlive you, so as
Dave mentioned a good book would be a good investment. Will help you
understand what the bird is doing as it grows and changes. Once you find a
good Avian Vet it helps also. They can be a great source of help when
needed.
Enjoy!!

Good post, Alex.  I have to admit, I got a little choked up when JudyB told
the "Step-Up" story.  I think she will always remember that moment.  Can't
wait to hear what other surprises are in store for her from this wonderful
creature.

Judy:  As Alex mentioned, parrots are extremely intelligent.  I don't
think you may have had a chance to read this article I posted to RPB a
few days ago, but I'm reprinting it so you can read it for yourself.
The larger size parrots are very bright (bigger birds, bigger brains)
and can be very challenging for their owners, but the little guys are
not dim-bulbs either.  I keep smaller parrots .... budgies, parrotlets,
lovebirds ... and they're really intelligent little creatures.  My
parrotlets are always trying to outsmart me and I always have to be one
step ahead of them.  And most people who have had the chance to get to
know and live with budgies are always amazed at how bright and outgoing
these tiny guys are, in addition to the fact that they are considered
excellent talkers.  Please let us know how Jewels is progressing ... he
sounds as if he's making great strides with you ... good news, indeed.

From: "National Post" - Monday, January 22/07

"It might come as a shock, given the derogatory connotation of the term

scientists found parrot- and crow-like birds had the biggest brains
relative to body size while pigeons and the pheasant family, which

Hi everyone and again thank you for all the advice!! Well I got
another surprise today, but it wasn't good. I got more information
about the past owner of Jewels. He was the only owner. He got Jewels
from a pet store 9 years ago and Jewels never knew anyone but him and
his sister. It seems the only thing Jewels was allowed to eat were
seeds, but he was NEVER offered anything else. Supposedly the sister
sneaked him peanut butter once in a while which is probably why he
took it from me. Then on top of that, I find out that that Jewels was
given a few toys over the 9 years...ready for this?? Old reading
glasses and broken CD's!! That was all he had to play with in 9
years!!!! Consider the danger of those items and no wonder he doesn't
have a clue how to play with a real toy! Right now I'm so mad that
it's beyond description!
I did get him to eat seeds this morning, but he had to be coaxed. He
won't eat anything in his cage, only when I put him on his tree stand.
Of course I don't want to spoil him rotten, but he's not eating or
drinking anything unless he's on the stand. I swirl my hand in the
water, then offer him my finger, which he sucks on. After a few times,
he'll drink. Almost the same thing to get him to eat his seeds.
I've just got to get him to eat and play in his cage, because
obviously I can't watch him every second, but for right now, I'll do
whatever I have to do. Again, any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
I've tried everything mentioned here and so far, not making too much
progress.
BUT..here's something cute...I have 3 standard poodles and a mini
poodle who of course are very curious about Jewels. One of my
standards, Kashmere, is always running over to Jewels' stand and cage,
scaring him. So all day, every day, since Jewels got here, I'm
yelling, NO KASHMERE!  This morning, I heard Jewels yell "Kashmere!"
You just gotta love these creatures.

Oh, Judy, I'm seeing a problem right here.  There is a predator
running up to his cage scaring him all day, every day.  Would you sit
down to a meal if you thought a predator was going to burst into your
house, or if there was one prowling around outside your windows day
after day?   Jewels doesn't understand that you are trying to protect
him from the predator by yelling.  He just knows that a scary creature
is accosting him on a regular basis, then you start yelling at this
scary creature, and Jewels is petrified and uncomfortable.  He is not
going to feel safe in his new home until he's given some peace.
Eventually he may learn to live and function in harmony with your
dogs, but now isn't the time to force that on him.

I hope you take this in the spirit in which it is offered.
Although I don't have a big bird, just little budgies, I think you are
setting yourself up for problems by letting Jewels know that you will
hand feed him, on his stand, if he doesn't eat.  You need to be more
patient.  He will approach his seed bowl and his water when he feels
it's safe to do so, believe me.  Even the most flighty of my birds
did, after a couple days. He will eat and drink, when he can move
about his cage without experiencing the wrath of the barking predator
that stalks him.

Hi! I'm not sure why my post didn't go through this morning, but I am
so mad I don't know what to do. We found out Jewels' owner ONLY gave
him a few toys in 9 years and guess what they were?? OLD sunglasses
and broken CD's. That's it! Jewels has no idea what to do with a toy,
no matter how hard I try to tempt him. He got seeds only and the man's
sister sneaked him a bit of peanut butter once in a while. I'm
thinking based on what I'm seeing that the man bought sunflower seeds,
and that's it. Not even a complete seed diet with all the other stuff
in it because Jewels doesn't have a clue. It seems to me that the
situation may be a lot more difficult than I even originally thought
to get him to eat. I also noticed that he's plucked himself under his
right wing pretty badly and maybe that's why I've noticed the right
wing twitch. He's not eating at all when he's in his cage and the only
way to get him to eat is to hand feed him the sunflower seeds IF he's
in the mood..which was early this morning and nothing since. He'll
only eat that if he's on his stand, not a thing when in his cage. I
know there's no "sneaking" because obviously there would be shells on
the cage floor. I am really worried. This poor thing has really been
thru a nightmare and I have to admit, I'm scared to death for him.
Ok..back to him and trying to feed him. Oh..and he takes water by
sucking it off my finger...then if I'm lucky he'll take some from the
bowl..but again, only on the stand, not the cage. I do know this for
sure, because my office faces his cage so believe me, I wouldn't miss
a thing if he even moved an inch.
Thanks so much for all the great info. I am really trying, but this
is very hard...heartbreaking is more like it.

&gt; house, or if there was one prowling around outside your windows day
&gt; after day?   Jewels doesn't understand that you are trying to protect
&gt; him from the predator by yelling.  He just knows that a scary creature
&gt; is accosting him on a regular basis, then you start yelling at this
&gt; scary creature, and Jewels is petrified and uncomfortable.  He is not
&gt; going to feel safe in his new home until he's given some peace.
&gt; Eventually he may learn to live and function in harmony with your
&gt; dogs, but now isn't the time to force that on him.

&gt; I hope you take this in the spirit in which it is offered.
&gt; Although I don't have a big bird, just little budgies, I think you are
&gt; setting yourself up for problems by letting Jewels know that you will
&gt; hand feed him, on his stand, if he doesn't eat.  You need to be more
&gt; patient.  He will approach his seed bowl and his water when he feels
&gt; it's safe to do so, believe me.  Even the most flighty of my birds
&gt; did, after a couple days. He will eat and drink, when he can move
&gt; about his cage without experiencing the wrath of the barking predator
&gt; that stalks him.

Hi Becky, I just read your post right after I sent the last one. I've
separated Jewels from the dogs this morning so all he can hear is
barking sometimes, and it doesn't seem to startle him as it did in the
beginning. You are absolutely right..I should have known better than
to let the dogs run around anywhere near him. I hope you're right
about not hand feeding...someone told me they could starve themselves
to death within days and I guess that's what I'm so afraid of.
Sorry about not knowing it could take quite a while before a post
shows up...I'm very new to this and EXTREMELY nervous about doing the
right thing. I'm trying to get him to learn to play with a toy so that
I can stop him from plucking out under his right wing any further. At
least if he'd eat that would distract him for a while.

Judy, have you been able to make arrangements for Jewels to see an avian
vet?

As Dave mentioned, it's really important to get Jewels checked out.
Plucking can be caused by all sorts of things, including diseases,
infections and malnutrition.  It can also be triggered by boredom and
neglect which, considering Jewels's previous ownership situation, could
have started the plucking.  I really feel a thorough check-up by an
avian vet should be at the top of your list for Jewels.

He'll

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; only eat that if he's on his stand, not a thing when in his cage. I
&gt; know there's no &quot;sneaking&quot; because obviously there would be shells on
&gt; the cage floor. I am really worried. This poor thing has really been
&gt; thru a nightmare and I have to admit, I'm scared to death for him.
&gt; Ok..back to him and trying to feed him. Oh..and he takes water by
&gt; sucking it off my finger...then if I'm lucky he'll take some from the
&gt; bowl..but again, only on the stand, not the cage. I do know this for
&gt; sure, because my office faces his cage so believe me, I wouldn't miss
&gt; a thing if he even moved an inch.
&gt;  Thanks so much for all the great info. I am really trying, but this
&gt; is very hard...heartbreaking is more like it.

As mentioned things should change when he is not scared by the dogs. You
will know for sure after the Vet has a chance to check him and make sure
nothing is wrong. You have to remember birds do not act like many other
animals when something is wrong. they are very good at hiding illness till
it's too late. If he gets a clean bill from a  Doc, then wait a while with
food offered and no dogs scaring him, he will eat. As time goes on he will
learn to eat with you also. He will want to try anything he see's you
eating.

Hi Linda and Dave,
I've had some PC problems so was unable to respond, but I finally got
an avian vet to see Jewels tomorrow morning. Nothing has changed in
the last day or so, so I know you're right, I'll feel a lot better
when I know we get a clean bill of health. I'll let you know what he
says...hopefully it's not as serious as I'm thinking. Although Jewels
only had one previous owner, that's the only person Jewels knew, so of
course I understand he is probably depressed and misses his old home.
He doesn't know how good his life is going to be...so I'm praying that
with time, the depression will go and a "new" Jewels will evolve. I
sure hope I hear good news tomorrow.
