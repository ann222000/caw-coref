I've never hurt myself that bad, but a girl that went to school with me got
mad at her boyfriend and punched her dresser.  She broke most of the bones in
her hand and had to drop out of school and give up any hope of being a tech.
It was a shame because she was really talented.

I, once, a few years ago, was washing a glass....had my soapy sponge inside
the glass (with my hand of course) and was twisting and turning it to wash
and yep...the glass broke but my hand kept turning...ouch that hurt...had a
"v" shaped cut on my RIGHT pinkie about 1 " long.  Doctor said I HAD to take
a week off..otherwise it might get so infected..I would need to take alot
more time off then....hope your's is feeling a little better already!
Have fun in Disney.

Well, finally broke down and went to the doc, because of what you said, what
will happen down the road......and everyone kept telling me it was broken, I
kept saying no it's not.....but worried about long term.

Spent frigin 2 1/2 hours waiting for a doc to tell me it was not broken!!!!And
that was without an x-ray, just him glancing at it!!!!!! Total of 5 minutes with
him!!!! It still looks like a almost burnt blue hot dog!!!! hehehehe Of course I
am going around to people that I don't like and showing them my finger and
saying see my "broken" finger.  LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO

And thanks for the weather report, was going to ask you anyway.  Wondered if I
should be doing the jean or short thing........what to dooooooo, oh what to
doooooooooo......it's 42 degrees here!!!!!!!! diana from indiana

Doctor said I HAD to take a week off..otherwise it might get so infected..I
would need to take alot more time off then..

Diana,
LOL... not AT you, but WITH you! I also fall up steps. I also fall down
steps and just flat out fall!
I have to be very careful when on steps. The last time I got hurt doing this
was out my back door to let the dogs in. I hit both shins and had a hard
time walking for days.
I also had hand injuries: one really bad one was when my dogs had a fight.
The girls I have to keep apart because they kill each other. They literally
latch on to each others faces. We have had Mallorie get stitches in her ear
a la van Gogh! We found out if we pick them up and put them in the sink and
run the water on their faces, they let go of each other. Well, the one time
I grabbed them and they were not latched, but the little one grabbed hold of
my left index finger in her teeth! OMG.... I never had so much pain. I had
nine puncture wounds in my finger. She got hold of my Celtic crown ring and
squeezed it so I could not get it off. I had so much pain. My finger was so
swollen and I could not get the ring off. Thank god for Vaseline! I was
lucky it was not my right hand. I did not have feeling in that finger for
about nine months. !!!
Hope your hand is healed by now... you must be on your way to Florida!!!
Ahhh, I will be there in three weeks!!! Could not come soon enough!
buenos dias,
Lynnette
Go IRISH!!!

Debbie,
There is an article on the beautytech website regarding MMA that says that
MMA has not been banned by the FDA.
For years I have been telling people that it IS banned for use in nail
products. Is this an error or have I been telling lies to my clients??? ;-)
**** Even though the FDA has called it a hazardous substance, it's not been
banned. Tomorrow, learn why MMA is still legal here and what regulators are
waiting for. Also, learn some of the MMA red flags to look for in your
favorite salon. ****

Lynnette.. MMA was never officially banned by the FDA, never added to the
prohibited list.. there was, maybe still is, ONE article out there
published by the FDA that had MMA listed as prohibited.. after weeks of
calls, emails and smoke signals I did get confirmation from the FDA that it
was on that list in error.. they promised back then they were going to
correct the paper, but I doubt they ever did..

What they did do and still stand behind is deem it poisonous and
deleterious and recommend it NOT be used in fingernail products

What Diana did at this point was to start a crusade of her own, and because
of that many states have written law or rule banning, prohibiting it's use,
sale or possession depending on the state...

The FDA (for those of you outside the US.. that is the United Stated Food
and Drug Administration, a regulatory agency) is not a policing agency,
their stance is we should police our own. They have no power or control to
prosecute individuals or salons, or the man power for that matter.

On the other hand.. *if* complaints against a manufacturer come in with
undeniable proof they are selling MMA across state lines to be distributed
for use in nail products, then they MIGHT (have in the past successfully)
react with legal recourse.. but I was told way back then the proof needed
was almost impossible to obtain..

So there we stand.. police our own - by state rule or law -- *if* that is
in place..

Ali.. that would be very incorrect information unless your state indeed has
a "BAN" in place, some state call it prohibited, some say banned.. you need
to use proper terminology.. we are working very hard to raise the level of
awareness that we are not a group of gum snapping teens here, but
professionals who are quite knowledgeable in our field.

Ali,
Where would the people you know who know about the MMA get it from?
I would be careful about what I say to clients. If I told them it was banded, they would look at me like I had two heads!   ;-)

Date:  Sat, 21 Oct 2006 18:26:03 -0400

&gt;

&gt;Debbie,

&gt;There is an article on the beautytech website regarding MMA that says that

&gt;MMA has not been banned by the FDA.

&gt;For years I have been telling people that it IS banned for use in nail

&gt;products. Is this an error or have I been telling lies to my clients??? ;-)

&gt;**** Even though the FDA has called it a hazardous substance, it's not been

&gt;banned. Tomorrow, learn why MMA is still legal here and what regulators are

&gt;waiting for. Also, learn some of the MMA red flags to look for in your

&gt;favorite salon. ****

&gt;This is an article dated February 18, 2002

&gt;Thanks,

&gt;Lynnette

&gt;

&gt;Notre Dame WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Debbie,
I am writing an article for something and just going over my p's and q's.
What IS truth is the individual states have banned/prohibited the use of MMA
in salons.
Okay---- ready for this? When I got my surprise inspection a few weeks ago,
this guy who knew nothing about what he was doing tells me that his wife
patronizes a chop shop!!!  Thank god I was sitting down giving a pedicure.
OMG--- what is up with these people? Our own inspector's wife!
Muchas gracias for the help.
Lynnette

&gt; Lynnette.. MMA was never officially banned by the FDA, never added to the
&gt; prohibited list.. there was, maybe still is, ONE article out there
&gt; published by the FDA that had MMA listed as prohibited.. after weeks of
&gt; calls, emails and smoke signals I did get confirmation from the FDA that
&gt; it
&gt; was on that list in error.. they promised back then they were going to
&gt; correct the paper, but I doubt they ever did..

&gt; What they did do and still stand behind is deem it poisonous and
&gt; deleterious and recommend it NOT be used in fingernail products

&gt; What Diana did at this point was to start a crusade of her own, and
&gt; because
&gt; of that many states have written law or rule banning, prohibiting it's
&gt; use,
&gt; sale or possession depending on the state...

&gt; The FDA (for those of you outside the US.. that is the United Stated Food
&gt; and Drug Administration, a regulatory agency) is not a policing agency,
&gt; their stance is we should police our own. They have no power or control to
&gt; prosecute individuals or salons, or the man power for that matter.

&gt; On the other hand.. *if* complaints against a manufacturer come in with
&gt; undeniable proof they are selling MMA across state lines to be distributed
&gt; for use in nail products, then they MIGHT (have in the past successfully)
&gt; react with legal recourse.. but I was told way back then the proof needed
&gt; was almost impossible to obtain..

&gt; So there we stand.. police our own - by state rule or law -- *if* that is
&gt; in place..

Pardon my newness, but is a chop shop/nss one of those "mall" places where
you can't communicate because they speak a different language?

Not necessarily..  chop shop, also know as NSS (Non Standard Salon):
Does not hold up to state regulations.. proper sanitation, use of MMA, non
licensed, poorly trained... the opposite end of the stick being a fully
compliant salon whether it be full service, nails only, high or low priced.

Less expensive can be perfectly OK as long as they follow state regs etc..
this would be a discount salon.... the difference between Kmart and
Bloomingdales for instance.. price, value, quality.

There is no reason why a discount - lowered priced services - salon can not
follow state regs and still offer less of the finer things.. spa services,
massages with mani's pedi, no paraffin..

Race, language, color of skin, have nothing to do with this.. and it
doesn;t matter if it is located in the mall, a strip mall or a stand alone
shop. There are plenty of white-anglo saxon salons out there who fit this

Rachel,
It depends on the person with what terminology they choose to use. Some
techs that I admire came up with the nss term a few year back in Orlando. It
was said that there were quite a few of those owners, (have to be careful
not to mention any particular group here...) were upset because it seemed as
if we were making fun of them-- a la "chop suey." They just do not get it.
IMHO, they should stop getting so upset over a term and get with the program
and follow all rules like you and I have to.
Many people have begun to use the NSS term, but they are using it as for
those types of places that you described. To me a nss is **ANY** shop/salon
that does not conform to the rules and regulations of their state and the
industry standards. I know of quite a few upscale salons that use credos, do
not clean their pedi tubs, use half cups to sanitize their implements that
*I* consider NSS. Are they a chop shop? No. To me a chop shop is one of
those places that shred the nails and have absolutely NO regard for ANY of
the rules and regulations of the state or industry. They also use MMA and
lie about to the people who patronize their shops. (to me those places are
shops-- I use salon for the ones who DO follow rules)
You will get some different replies on this. No one is right or wrong about
it. It is just what our opinions are.
buenos dias,
Lynnette

&gt;&gt; What IS truth is the individual states have banned/prohibited the use of
&gt;&gt; MMA
&gt;&gt; in salons.
&gt;&gt; Okay---- ready for this? When I got my surprise inspection a few weeks
&gt;&gt; ago,
&gt;&gt; this guy who knew nothing about what he was doing tells me that his wife

Debbie,
Yes, I know!! Still does not matter.... according to Mr. Inspector, they need proof. What the hell can you give them as proof? Photos do not cut it.
For this article I am writing, I need to go to your link and find out all the states and their rules--unless the list is already available somewhere. I am doing this not just for PA.
I appreciate your help with this!

&gt;&gt; Lynnette.. MMA was never officially banned by the FDA, never added to the
&gt;&gt; prohibited list.. there was, maybe still is, ONE article out there
&gt;&gt; published by the FDA that had MMA listed as prohibited.. after weeks of
&gt;&gt; calls, emails and smoke signals I did get confirmation from the FDA that
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; was on that list in error.. they promised back then they were going to
&gt;&gt; correct the paper, but I doubt they ever did..

&gt;&gt; What they did do and still stand behind is deem it poisonous and
&gt;&gt; deleterious and recommend it NOT be used in fingernail products

&gt;&gt; What Diana did at this point was to start a crusade of her own, and
&gt;&gt; because
&gt;&gt; of that many states have written law or rule banning, prohibiting it's
&gt;&gt; use,
&gt;&gt; sale or possession depending on the state...

&gt;&gt; The FDA (for those of you outside the US.. that is the United Stated Food
&gt;&gt; and Drug Administration, a regulatory agency) is not a policing agency,
&gt;&gt; their stance is we should police our own. They have no power or control to
&gt;&gt; prosecute individuals or salons, or the man power for that matter.

&gt;&gt; On the other hand.. *if* complaints against a manufacturer come in with
&gt;&gt; undeniable proof they are selling MMA across state lines to be distributed
&gt;&gt; for use in nail products, then they MIGHT (have in the past successfully)
&gt;&gt; react with legal recourse.. but I was told way back then the proof needed
&gt;&gt; was almost impossible to obtain..

&gt;&gt; So there we stand.. police our own - by state rule or law -- *if* that is
&gt;&gt; in place..

Deb,
Thanks!! I have been to that site many times, but forgot that I did not have to go to each state individually!! That was easy. I got 35 states with rules on MMA. I really appreciate it. Took all of about three minutes to write them down!! When the article is done, I will get it to everyone. Possibly next week sometime--depending on things here.
thanks so much again,
Lynnette

I just wanted to tell all of you that I know we get in an uproar every time we hear about MMA issues and the pedi tub incidents, etc....
This past summer my daughter worked at NBC Philadelphia. She was responsible for coming up with story lines for the news. I gave her quite a few ideas, two being the MMA issue and the lesion issue.
When she presented it to them, they told her that they had already done them before and they were not interested in repeating this again.
So, even though WE think it is something that needs to be in the public eye often, the news media do not think that way. It does not matter if we send hundreds of letters, they just want fresh news.
My daughter is now interning for NBC in South Bend/Notre Dame Indiana and although she does not have the same job there, I can see if she can plug this there for "filler" on the news.
just some thoughts,
Lynnette

Ali,
I was more interested in the comment about those who find out about the MMA. The way I read it, it seemed as if you knew some who did. Correct me if I am mistaken. I would just like to find some things out from those who do get MMA. (not the kind where the MMA is already in the liquid.) I am interested in those who get it black market.... you know, 100% MMA.... thanks for any info you can give me!

Where would the people you know who know about  the MMA get it from?

Lynette,
I once saw MMA monomer advertised in a catalog for  $35.00 from a beauty
supply in Georgia about 5 years ago. The label I  saw in the ad said "Solvent
resistant monomer". (back before I had 40  something eyes lol) I don't get the
catalog anymore, I guess because I  didn't buy from them.  I still don't know how
I got on their mailing  list.  I bet there are still places to get MMA.
