A high level VP at KDE Corporate Headquarters inadvertently spilled the
details in an interview with Linux Tech Daily of how they plan to take
over everyone's computer.

First, they are buying Yahoo!

No, wait, that's someone else.  Oh!  Yes!  I remember now.  The Evil Plan
[TM] is revealed here:

This bit is particularly terrifying:

&lt;quote&gt;
4. How can everyday users help with “Guerilla Marketing”? Is there an
easy way to step in and help?

Yes, there are many easy ways to help. The most obvious is helping people
installing KDE, answering questions on forums, IRC and other media.
Lately, we’re getting also an increased amount of requests for speakers.
Often local LUGs are interested in talks by KDE knowledgeable people. It
might sound a bit scary,  representing KDE in your local LUG, but it’s
really what KDE is about.
&lt;/quote&gt;

See, they actually admit in the open that they have a marketing plan.

Yikes.  No place to hide.

Sure there is. You just don't install KDE on your computer.
Simple as that. If your mind hadn't been confused and numbed by
all that eye-candy you'd know that.

KDE is just a collection of applications. Their advertising tries
to make it seem to be something more than that, but it isn't.
Just like their advertising tries to make you believe it is a
complete user interface, but it isn't.

The best way to run Slackware, and Linux in general, is with
X and a good window manager and a good file manager, from the
commandline in 'xterms'. Use X apps when they are the best ones
for the job, and console apps when they are the best choice.

That's ODE, the Other Desktop Environment.

You don't have to be some kind of guru to do that. I certainly
am not. But that's what the KDE technocrats and their corporate
sponsors want you to believe: That you need them to run your
computer.

That's what corporations do: They lie to people to promote
dependency on them.

KDE is a clone of the Windows user-interface, created by big
corporations in order to steal Linux from the general public.
They don't like operating systems that are free and that they
can't access when they choose. They don't like people who don't
need their help. They don't like free and open source software.
All these things are anaethema to the corporate agenda.

So they created KDE to lure Windows-users, ignorant appliance
operators, into the Linux world in large numbers, in order to
overwhelm the Linux revolutionaries.

It isn't working.

They can take KDE and grease it up and shove it where the
sun don't shine.

KDE is as much free as Linux is, its GPLed. Probably You feel that
Linux is still for command liners and bashers. What do You wanna say
about GNOME, Compiz and XGL?
