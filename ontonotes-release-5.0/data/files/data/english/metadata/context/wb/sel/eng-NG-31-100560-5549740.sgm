Roachdale Fla.
A Bigfoot displaying pretty unusual behavior appeared in Roachdale, Indiana.
It often spent the nights pounding on the walls of the Roger's farmhouse. It
appeared to be about 6 feet tall, and powerfully built. It walked on two
legs, but went down to all fours to run. However, it never left any tracks,
even when running through mud. It often didn't even appear to touch the
ground, or make any noise as it ran through the undergrowth. Sometimes, the
Roger's could even see through the creature. An hour before the first
sighting, neighbors reported a luminous object pass overhead, which then
exploded, though no debris was ever found. The Bigfoot attacked Carter
Burdine's chicken house, and one two occasions massacred the chickens
inside, dismembering them, draining them of blood but not eating them, and
spreading their remains over a huge area.
