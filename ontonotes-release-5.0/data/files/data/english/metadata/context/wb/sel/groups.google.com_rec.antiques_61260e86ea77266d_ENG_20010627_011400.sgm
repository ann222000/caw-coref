Does anyone know of another name for a &quot;Toronto Couch&quot;.

I've been searching the net for some information on this style of
couch/bed but have found no information regarding history, how long they
were manufactured, who manufactured them, etc...

My family has three of them at the lake and I think they were purchased
sometime before 1940-45.

FYI, A &quot;Toronto Couch&quot; is basically a wheeled metal frame bed with wire
mesh &amp; springs to support the flexible mattress. The two sides of the
bed prop up on metal legs to create a twin bed for sleeping and flip
down for use as a couch (with no back). The mattress is designed to
fold up on top or flop down on either side if you like. We even still
have the original slip covers that go over top when in use as a couch.
They work great on our veranda for overnight guests or afternoon naps.

If anyone knows this style by another name or has any info I'd be happy
to hear from you.

"/> Sounds like a &quot;roll away bed&quot;, I've never heard the term &quot;Toronto bed&quot; even
though I lived there for 16 years ;~)))

David's description sounds like the &quot;day beds&quot; we had on the porch at the
cottage, only his has an additional feature of the ends llifting up to
extend the length of the &quot;couch&quot;. At least that is the way I interpret his
description.
There is only one &quot;folding day bed&quot; listed on Google and no picture. The
website is in the UK so maybe they are imports? There are many &quot;folding
couch&quot; sites, but none seem to fold at each end, only in the middle to form
a back.

"/> I don't know the name, but we had a similar one in Nebraska in the 50's,
which was old enough to be left to rust out behind the shed (most of the
junk back there was from the 20's). But with ours you could fold both
extensions down or up as well as flat for the bed. So the normal
position in couch style was an &quot;h&quot; but it could be a &quot;u&quot; as well. We
just called it the folding bed, and on very hot summer nights piled
quilts on it so we could sleep under the stars without the
ground-crawling bugs joining us. Very common, and mostly kept on
people's porches by then. I'll bet the catalogs from the 20's had a
different name for them.
