Mostly system fix. East could be slightly faulted for the initial
response. As the auction shows, 1H didn't really provide any extra
options over 1D. An initial jump shift looks good too. I hope those
who like 2NT-then-4NT showing 18-19 will agree this hand is too
strong.

West could rebid 3C but only in hindsight. 1NT seems reasonable.

As the auction went East can see a possible grand slam even without
West's long suit but I would also just bid 6NT. West can see that if
East has 17 points including K, K, KQ, KQ, and no 5-card suit, then
7NT is 5/6 to make (2 right jacks, 50% if the wrong jack). However, if
East is missing any of those 6 good cards, the grand slam rates to be
below par. Conclusion: 5NT (forcing, inviting 7) is pointless as
insufficiently delicate. 3C or 3D are far too delicate.

6NT is a very reasonable contract, given that opener shows his point
count and protects his kings by bidding 1NT.  Of course, given my
partnership's methods, 7C  is relatively trivial

1C  1D
3C  4NT (1430)
5C  5NT
7C  7NT or P

Given your methods, no issues except for the argumentation about blame.

At the table playing strong NTs, my partner rebid 2C and we didn't get
there either.  At the time I thought partner was worth a 3C rebid, but I
could also have handled the follow up auction more delicately if I
thought this good of a hand was possible, and I can understand partner
being weary of his aceless hand.  After 1N, I don't think you have a
prayer, east can't picture a source of tricks.

Opener could have shown his HCP by a jump to 3C instead of showing them by
1NT.  That should catapult you to grand.  I have some sympathy for the 1NT
with the kings to protect.  Responder bidding 1H instead of 1D is strange

100% to the responder.  Sure opener has longer than expected clubs, but
unless 6N is supposed to mean &quot;bid 7 with a maximum&quot;, responder has decided
7N has no play even though they may be missing no more than a Q and 2 Js.

East was guilty of lazy bidding. 7NT will be excellent opposite a less
than minimum 1NT rebid such as: xx, Kxx, KQx, KQJxx. However, this is
the type of hand where good methods and experience in slam bidding are
needed, in a casual partnership, East could not be faulted for taking
the simple auction.

Suggested auction:
1C  -  1H
1NT -  2D
3C  -  4C
5C  -  5NT
7C  -  pass

2D = GF checkback
3C = 5+ card club suit
4C = GF slam try
5C = denying an ace
5NT = trying again for a grand
7C = I must have whatever partner needs

converting to 7NT would be reasonable, but on the offchance partner
needs a spade ruff, 7C is a safer.

I can not agree. I'd show a strong NT with this hand every day of the

East does not need the 6th club to make a grand. Trade the sixth club
for a small spade and 7C is an excellent spot and now no one could
fault West's bidding. East is primarily to blame for taking a lazy
bidding sequence.

100% responder. 7 NT is cold opposite as little as
xxx,Kxx,KQ,KQJTx. Next time, use checkback.

Opener's 1NT rebid is correct, with just 15 HCP, the hand is not
too strong for a 15-17 1NT rebid, despite the good clubs.

BTW, in the above auction, responder should not be surprised
that opener holds long clubs. 3235 is a likely distribution
for opener's 1 NT response.

If I held that hand, even knowing that partner has all 4 aces, I'd be
foolish to bid 7.  Where are my tricks?  I can count to 11 (possibly) with
maybe another from a heart finesse.  Guaranteeing 4 aces is not guaranteeing
13 tricks.  West still has to count up his tricks.

The point is that East &quot;tells&quot; when he bids 5NT.  West makes the final
decision based on that input.

With the OP hand, as West, I can count 12 sure tricks, with good chances for
the 13th if partner produces a queen or jack somewhere.  Without anything
extra, there will often be squeeze chances for the 13th trick.  Thus, I'd
opt for 7C rather than 7NT.

A 5NT invitation doesn't promise all of the aces.
Give the 5NT bidder 20+ hcp. You could still possibly be off an ace
when you bid a grand.

&gt;&gt; guaranteeing
&gt;&gt; 13 tricks.  West still has to count up his tricks.

&gt;&gt; The point is that East &quot;tells&quot; when he bids 5NT.  West makes the final

Aside from the (immaterial) fact that these two West hands only have 12
cards, yes, I might miss the &quot;cold&quot; grand with these hands.  But, you are
ignoring my proposition that by showing all four aces, by bidding 4C
(Gerber) followed by 5C, you are improving on the OP auction of just
blasting to 6NT, as well as the other postings' auctions.

With the OP hand, you *will* get to a grand with I'd guess about 90+%
probability of success.

I was think about a previous post where the last bid was 5NT.
The 5NT bid simply asks partner to bid seven if he has a maximum but
if you bid a grand with a minimum but with playing strength you risk
going to seven missing an ace.

Sure bidding 4C and then 5C is another way to approach the hand.
Certainly, it is better than bidding 6NT.
However, you are still guessing. To say opener with all four kings and
a maximum hand can't bid 7NT seems to be asking a lot since partner
could have a different hands where you just make 7NT on sheer brute
power. The fact that you can miss some lay down grands with a 4C-5C
sequence means you are not covered in all cases. Again you are
guessing.

Basically, the decision to open 1C and rebid 1NT instead of 2C created
a situation where a grand that should have been trivially bid without
guessing was not bid and even if you decided to make a grand slam
invite after a 1NT rebid it is not entirely risk free.

I would not bid 6NT with your hand immediately for the reason that
bidding the field 6NT is only going to get you at best average. The
only way you are going to win match points on the bidding is to find a
good excuse to be in a grand or a strong excuse to stay out of slam.
So you have every incentive to slow things down and explore if
alternative contracts to 6NT are reasonable.

On the given hands, if the deal was in the first day qualifying
session of a US national pairs event, I would suspect 7NT would be
worth about 75% board.  7C would be worth about a 37% board, and 6NT
would be worth about a 13% board and I am probably being a little
generous to the pairs who didn't get to 7NT.

A 1 NT rebid is much more limited than a 2C rebid.
A 2C rebid that does not even show a 6 card club suit.
It can be a minimum opener with maybe 11 HCP up to
something like 17 HCP with a poor C suit.

Finding out opener's distribution and strength after the 1NT rebid
is easy if one plays a reasonable version of checkback.
Yes, including the six card club suit.
