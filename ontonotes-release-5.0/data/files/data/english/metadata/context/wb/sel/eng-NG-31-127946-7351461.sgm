Does Ginny-Al Tours have a website we can access?

Thanks.  Elaine

No website...Ginny and Al have been conducting tours to the  Azores since
1982.  One or two groups during the summer.  They  really know the Azores after
all these years.  Ginny can arrange your  private tour.  She has  done this for
many.

Ginny and Al Dutra's trips to the Azores are just too good to describe.
It's like traveling with family.

The following photos (a teeny tiny fraction of what I have) were all
taken on their 2005 trip to the Azores:

I also went on last year's Portugal trip--fantastic. I would be going
to Spain with them this year too, except I am doing some other
traveling and can't make it.

I loved your photos but I would like to know about the door in the  mountain.
Did someone live there or was this a rock quarry and that was  the entrance?
I am very curious.

The doors are in a seaside cliff on Graciosa. They put the boats inside
to protect them from the high seas--it didn't look like there was a
good place to moor them in the water! Gotta admire those fishermen.

Sorry, I don't have my notes handy to give you the name of the place.
But anyone from Graciosa must know of it.

I've been told that Graciosa retains much of the old Azores atmosphere.
However, between my first visit in the early '90s and 2005, it had
changed quite a bit.

A while back someone asked about a photo I had in an online album of
some doors in the cliffs on Graciosa. I have posted a few more photos
at:

http://hununu.org/photos/index.php?gallery=./more%20Graciosa

These are thumbnails, so click for a larger image. I'm on dial-up, so I
didn't upload huge detailed pictures, sorry.

I am also very embarrassed that I can't remember the name of this
place. If anyone can tell me I'll change the name of the album from
"more Graciosa" to whatever it should be!

Mary, could it be the boats were kept in the caves away from any harm such as storms.  It appears that the pictures were taken during low tide, also some of the caves seemed to have collapsed.  They did not offer much protection from earthquakes.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the pictures and allows all of us to see something unique and interesting about the
Azores.  Thanks.
