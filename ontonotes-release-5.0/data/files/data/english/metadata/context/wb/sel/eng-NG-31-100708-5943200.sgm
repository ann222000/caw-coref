FBI worries about an Osama-Sopranos link!
By Ed Naha
Created Oct 6 2006 - 9:48am
"FBI worries about an Osama-Sopranos link." That's an actual headline of a
story [1] written by Associated Press writer Pat Milton.

So, let's get this straight. Aside from the fact that Iraq is right next to
a urinal cake in terms of blossoming freedom, now we have to worry about the
mob?

According to the A.P.: "Though there is no direct evidence yet of organized
crime collaborating with terrorists, the first hints of a connection
surfaced in a recent undercover FBI operation. Agents stopped a man with
alleged mob ties from selling missiles to an informant posing as a terrorist
middleman."

Further investigation by this reporter backs the FBI. In recent weeks, the
city of Basra has officially changed it's name to "Newark, New Jersey," the
Grand Basra Mosque has been re-christened the "Bada Bing! Mosque" and,
across the country, suicide bombers have started yelling "Top of the world,
Ma!" before detonating.

"We are continuing to look for a nexus," Joseph Billy Jr., the FBI's top
counterterrorism official told the A.P. "We are looking at this very
aggressively."

During the recent lock-down of Baghdad, troops rounded up seven alleged
al-Qaida members: "No-Neck" Zahir, "Big Pussy" Wadud, "Squeamy" Shakur,
"Meatballs" Al Harith, Fa'iz "The Enforcer" Dirar, Hakim "Big Al" Harith and
"Knuckles" Husayn. All denied connections to the mob, with "Big Pussy" Wadud
commenting: "Hey, whaddaya looking at? You talking to me? You talking to
me?"

He concluded his brief statement by flipping the bird at American troops and
quipping: "Andate tutti a 'fanculo!" Iraqi translators couldn't quite get
the gist of what he was saying, although Army Private Tony Pedestiano broke
ranks and cold-cocked him, yelling "un bastardo!" at the top of his lungs.

According to the Associated Press, a study contracted by the Pentagon wrote:
"Although terrorism and organized crime are different phenomena, the
important fact is that terrorist and criminal networks overlap and cooperate
in some enterprises. The phenomenon of the synergy of terrorism and
organized crime is growing because similar conditions give rise to both and
because terrorists and organized criminals use similar approaches to promote
their operations."

The mob's potential interest in helping a terrorist has nothing to do with
ideology or sympathy but with greed, said Matt Heron, head of New York FBI's
organized crime unit.

"They will deal with anybody, if they can make a buck," Heron said. "They
will sell to a terrorist just as easily as they would sell to an order of
Franciscan monks. It's a business relationship to them."

"If the mob has explosives and a terrorist wants them and they have the
money, they could become instant friends," he said.

Pat D'Amuro, a retired senior FBI official and now chief executive of
Giuliani Security, said a Mafia boss once acknowledged that the mob would
help terrorists.

"I am aware of a high-level Mafia figure, who was cooperating with
authorities, being asked if the Mafia would assist terrorists in smuggling
people into Europe through Italy," D'Amuro said. "He said, 'The Mafia will
help who ever can pay.'"

While the FBI is taking note of this, just now, there is evidence that
outside influences have been in play vis-a-vis the insurgency for, at least,
a year, due to lack of intelligence in the Bush Administration. (D'oh!)

Last year, for instance, Sunni slums in Baghdad began celebrating the Feast
of San Gennaro.

The still-standing cinemas of Iraq are only playing films by Martin Scorsese
and Francis Ford Coppola.

In Kirkuk, the sale of pasta and Frank Sinatra albums has skyrocketed.

In Baqouba, all posters of al-Zarqawi have been replaced by those featuring
al-Pacino.

Plus, Iraqi head honcho Nouri al-Maliki now likes to be addressed as
"Noodles."

Clearly, the American government has dropped the ball. Again.

When queried about his name change, al-Maliki bristled. "Outta my face. I'm
goin' up down over d'ere. I'm walkin', here."

There is a sense that the sectarian violence in Iraq is out of control and
will gravitate towards any outside influence that is willing to aid the
various factions.

The Mahdi "army," for instance, has recently been kidnapping Iraqis and
beating their knuckles with wooden rulers, suggesting a connection between
these killers and a renegade group of Dominican nuns.

In certain areas of Iraq, drive-by insurgents have been hurling custard pies
at their victims, hinting at an al-Qaida/Three Stooges connection.
Furthermore, Iraq's new number two al-Qaida operative is rumored to be
called "Abu al-Curly." He recently released a tape declaring:
"Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk."

All right, I'm being snarky, here, but the fact is BushCo. has destroyed
Iraq...perhaps, the entire Middle East because of ignorance, arrogance and
ideology.

The Neo-cons wanted to launch a world-changing Crusade, without bothering to
notice how the first Crusades turned out. (Hint: Notso hotso.)

So, how's Iraq shaping up.

Well, we're going to dig a massive trench, or moat, around Baghdad.

The Saudis are going to erect a great wall on the Saudi/Iraqi boarder.

One hundred Iraqis are either slaughtered or tortured to death a day.

American troops are attacked every fifteen minutes.

Up to 1,000 Iraqi policemen were just kicked off the force for alleged
"death squad" ties.

A 36 hour day and night curfew was declared for Baghdad, last weekend,
because a "plot" to destroy the all-important "Green Zone" was uncovered.

Shiite politicians, last weekend, demanded changes in the Iraqi government,
accusing a Sunni Arab party of ties to terrorism.

The Kurds want to have their own country.

There are over two dozen freelance militias in Baghdad, alone.

Over 3,000 Iraqi troops have deserted.

70% of Iraqis think it's swell to attack American troops.

77% think that Americans want to have permanent bases in Iraq.

300,000 Iraqis have said "screw it" and have fled their homeland.

Only 2% of the country is safe to be covered by Western journalists.

America has upped its troop presence to over 147,000.

22 troops have died in the first five days of October, bringing the total to
2,738.

The country's in the midst of a civil war.

And Bush declares we're going to win.

Win what?

To show you how delusional this Administration and toady Congress is? In
this year's Defense budget, approved last week, $20 million was allocated
for a victory celebration - in Republican speak, "a commemoration of
success," once we've triumphed in Iraq.

''If the Bush administration is planning victory celebrations, Americans
deserve to know what their plan is to get us to a victory in Iraq,'' said
Rebecca Kirszner, spokeswoman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid
(D-Nev.).

In terms of the Mob?

Let them take over Iraq.

The Mob has always operated with a twisted sense of honor.

I'd rather have "twisted" than none at all.

Paging Dennis Hastert.
