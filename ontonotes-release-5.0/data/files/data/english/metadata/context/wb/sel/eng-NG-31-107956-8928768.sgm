I am have my first trailered boat; before now my boats were small enough to
just store upside down on the dock for the winter.

Someone told me it I should put the back up on blocks to take the load off
the tires, so I have done that.  How about the front.  Must that be propped
up also, or is the crank thing okay?

The guy I bought it from lubed everything last April.  The trailer has only
been in the water twice since then.  Does it need any maintenance?

Thanks much

- Did the previous owner tell you anything about the wheel bearings? Do you
see something like this in the centers of your wheels?
http://www.bearingbuddy.com/ Or, do you just see a metal cap?

- Before it's too cold to work outdoors without gloves, take a good look at
all wire junctions. Make sure all splices look clean, not corroded. If
they're made with electrical tape over soldered wire joints, that's sloppy
and they should be replaced with crimped connections covered with heat
shrink tubing.

- Spare tire: Got one? Is it secured to the trailer with a cable lock or
some other method?

- Check all trailer hardware for tightness. Make a list of the tools you
need to tighten these things, and buy a dedicated set of tools that will
live in the tow vehicle. Boats &amp; trailers only have problems when you're
away from home. Don't buy cheap tools, figuring that you're not likely to
need them. When you're on the side of a highway in the pouring rain, cheap
tools won't make you happy.

- Check all the boat wiring (lights, etc.) now, same as you did for the
trailer. Tape &amp; solder joints are for slobs. Only crimps &amp; heat shrink
tubing are allowed in this universe, for boats &amp; other toys that live
outdoors.

There is a plastic cover over them.  Is that adequate since it is exposed to
water so little?

Yeah, they are all covered with electrical tape that is falling off; expect
the connections are pretty bad underneath also.  Wouldn't soldered joints
covered with shrink be okay?  I did that for my invisible fence 15 years ago
and they are still okay.  But it is probably easier to crimp them anyhow if
that is better.

That's funny actually.  Before pulling the boat out I checked and found the
spare was flat.  Fortunately it held pressure okay; but the bigger problem
was that it was locked on and I didn't have the key!  When I put the boat in
I didn't have the key either, and the tire was probably flat then also; good
thing I didn't need it.  Came off in 2 seconds with an angle grinder.

What about propping the front up?!

One of the things I look for when shopping for a trailer are trailer
wheels with the same bolt pattern as my tow vehicle. I don't always
find one but a prospective trailer gets extra points when I do,

Prop up the front too. Be sure to remove the transom drain plug and that the
boat is tilted enough to drain any water that gets into it.

Unless you're talking about the soft plastic cover that can cover Bearing
Buddies, I honestly don't know. Are you sure there's not a metal cover under
the plastic thing? Plastic seems like a weak option in a place that could
brush against a curb.

If the original owner didn't mention when he last repacked or replaced the
bearings, it's probably worthwhile to get it done so you've got a starting
point for a maintenance schedule.

Solder + shrink tubing isn't too bad, as long as you check the joint for
sharp edges that might puncture the shrink tubing, and file or clip them.
Crimps are easier, but you should use a properly designed tool, and they not
so easy to find. The jaws on most tools don't shape the crimp correctly as
it squeezes them, because the jaws are almost flat, with slight curves
carved into them. That's useless. At this links below, check out the tool,

I've never propped up any of my boat trailers so the tires are off the
ground. The trailer is designed so that the weight is borne by the the
suspension and tires, and I doubt whether the tires &quot;know&quot; whether they
have been sitting for two weeks or three months. I make sure the
bearings are properly packed before storage, and that the tires are
properly inflated, and that's it for the trailer.

Once the boat and engine are winterized and the batteries are removed, I
have the boat shrinkwrapped.

I do check on the boat every month. With the rig on its own wheels, if I
have to move it for some reason, it's no big deal to do so.

Harry,

When I had a runabout, and kept the boat stored on the trailer, I ALWAYS
kept the trailer propped up using trailer jacks.  The reason I did, was
my father (a mechanic engineer) told me to do it.  He was emphatic that
the weight of the tires sitting on one section of the tire over the
winter, would cause the tire to become permanently unbalanced (I think
he said a &quot;flat spot&quot;.  He also said the tires would crack prematurely,
where they sat on the ground.  I also (based upon his recommendations)
made sure the tires were covered with a tarp to make sure they did not
dry rot from UV degradation.  Both were very easy to do and took less
than 5 minutes.

Now was he correct, heck, I don't know, but the tires were over 20 yrs
old when I sold the boat and trailer.

Yes, I'm sure that all the cars sitting in dealer storage lots for three
or four months are propped up on frame jacks so their tires don't
develop flat spots. So are all the new RVs and travel trailers at the
distribution centers. And of course, the 150 boats that my dealer stores
on trailers over the winter, they're all stored on blocks and jacks, too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for sharp edges that might puncture the shrink tubing, and file or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clip them. Crimps are easier, but you should use a properly designed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tool, and they not so easy to find. The jaws on most tools don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shape the crimp correctly as it squeezes them, because the jaws are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; almost flat, with slight curves carved into them. That's useless. At
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this links below, check out the tool, and click on the picture for a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Spare tire: Got one? Is it secured to the trailer with a cable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lock or some other method?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's funny actually.  Before pulling the boat out I checked and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; found the spare was flat.  Fortunately it held pressure okay; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the bigger problem was that it was locked on and I didn't have the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; key!  When I put the boat in I didn't have the key either, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tire was probably flat then also; good thing I didn't need it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Came off in 2 seconds with an angle grinder.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What about propping the front up?!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Someone else chimed in on that last question.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've never propped up any of my boat trailers so the tires are off
&gt;&gt;&gt; the ground. The trailer is designed so that the weight is borne by
&gt;&gt;&gt; the the suspension and tires, and I doubt whether the tires &quot;know&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; whether they have been sitting for two weeks or three months. I make
&gt;&gt;&gt; sure the bearings are properly packed before storage, and that the
&gt;&gt;&gt; tires are properly inflated, and that's it for the trailer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Once the boat and engine are winterized and the batteries are
&gt;&gt;&gt; removed, I have the boat shrinkwrapped.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I do check on the boat every month. With the rig on its own wheels,
&gt;&gt;&gt; if I have to move it for some reason, it's no big deal to do so.

&gt;&gt; Harry,

&gt;&gt; When I had a runabout, and kept the boat stored on the trailer, I
&gt;&gt; ALWAYS kept the trailer propped up using trailer jacks.  The reason I
&gt;&gt; did, was my father (a mechanic engineer) told me to do it.  He was
&gt;&gt; emphatic that the weight of the tires sitting on one section of the
&gt;&gt; tire over the winter, would cause the tire to become permanently
&gt;&gt; unbalanced (I think he said a &quot;flat spot&quot;.  He also said the tires
&gt;&gt; would crack prematurely,  where they sat on the ground.  I also (based
&gt;&gt; upon his recommendations) made sure the tires were covered with a tarp
&gt;&gt; to make sure they did not dry rot from UV degradation.  Both were very
&gt;&gt; easy to do and took less than 5 minutes.

&gt;&gt; Now was he correct, heck, I don't know, but the tires were over 20 yrs
&gt;&gt; old when I sold the boat and trailer.

&gt; Yes, I'm sure that all the cars sitting in dealer storage lots for three
&gt; or four months are propped up on frame jacks so their tires don't
&gt; develop flat spots. So are all the new RVs and travel trailers at the
&gt; distribution centers. And of course, the 150 boats that my dealer stores
&gt; on trailers over the winter, they're all stored on blocks and jacks, too.
">

Harry,

As I said, he could be wrong, but I was purchasing his boat and it was
in perfect condition so I followed his maintenance recommendations and
procedure.  I not only jacked the tires off the ground, but also put a
jack under the tongue so the adjustable trailer jack was not supporting
the weight.

I think it really depends on the type of tire and it's construction.  Not to
doubt your Dad, but your average, regular duty tires won't become
permanently &quot;unbalanced&quot; due to flat spots.  Although they may take a small
temporary set, it's usually too little to notice and it goes away quickly
when driving.

High performance tires, like those on the Porsche, will develop flat spot
overnight sitting in the garage.  It is very noticeable when you first start
driving and it takes several miles to &quot;round out&quot;.   These tires, unlike
regular tires, are very soft and &quot;gummy&quot; to permit high adhesion to the road
or track.   They also don't last very long either ... 25K-30K miles is about
it.

Whatever floats your boat. You didn't jack the tires off the
ground...you probably jacked the axles off the ground. That might work
with &quot;solid&quot; axles, but I'd be wary of trying it with a torsion bar axle
system, and if you jacked up the frame, the torsion axles would sag, I
would think.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, they are all covered with electrical tape that is falling

Damn, I normally didn't double check my father on engineering type
recommendations, but I just did on this.  It looks like not only did my
Dad recommend it, but so do Trailer Mfg'ers:

http://www.tidewatertrailers.com/wst_page10.html

Winterizing Your Trailer

1. Park in a protected area or cover your trailer with a boat cover or
tarp. Cover tires to protect from UV rays of the sun.
2. Block the wheels, or better, jack up the trailer so the tires do not
come in contact with the ground
3. Fill / repack wheel bearings via Sure Lube
Moisture can cause rust and possible bearing damage, especially when a
trailer sits idle.
4. Lubricate moving parts such as roller bushings, winches and other
rolling parts with lightweight household oil.
5. Tighten loose nuts and bolts.

6. Block the tongue and crank the tongue jack to the completely closed
position.

http://www.discoverboating.com/resources/article.aspx?id=93

Also

Store boat in a garage or other temperature controlled facility if
possible. If not, cover the boat with shrink-wrap or a large tarp.
If your boat is stored on a trailer, block the wheels so they are off
the ground and loosen tie-down straps to reduce stress on the hull.
Store your inflatables away from rodents, who love to eat hypalon and
PVC fabrics. Also, do not leave the inflatable exposed to the elements -
clouds do not inhibit UV rays.

One major advantage of leaving the trailer with the tires *on* the ground is
that in the spring you will notice that they are flat before taking the
jackstands out, only to have to jack it back up again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the original owner didn't mention when he last repacked or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; replaced the bearings, it's probably worthwhile to get it done so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you've got a starting point for a maintenance schedule.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Before it's too cold to work outdoors without gloves, take a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good look at all wire junctions. Make sure all splices look
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clean, not corroded. If they're made with electrical tape over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; soldered wire joints, that's sloppy and they should be replaced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with crimped connections covered with heat shrink tubing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, they are all covered with electrical tape that is falling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off; expect the connections are pretty bad underneath also.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wouldn't soldered joints covered with shrink be okay?  I did that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for my invisible fence 15 years ago and they are still okay.  But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is probably easier to crimp them anyhow if that is better.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Solder + shrink tubing isn't too bad, as long as you check the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; joint for sharp edges that might puncture the shrink tubing, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; file or clip them. Crimps are easier, but you should use a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; properly designed tool, and they not so easy to find. The jaws on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most tools don't shape the crimp correctly as it squeezes them,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because the jaws are almost flat, with slight curves carved into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them. That's useless. At this links below, check out the tool, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; click on the picture for a closer look at what the jaws should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; look like:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Spare tire: Got one? Is it secured to the trailer with a cable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lock or some other method?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's funny actually.  Before pulling the boat out I checked and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; found the spare was flat.  Fortunately it held pressure okay; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the bigger problem was that it was locked on and I didn't have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the key!  When I put the boat in I didn't have the key either,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the tire was probably flat then also; good thing I didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; need it.  Came off in 2 seconds with an angle grinder.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What about propping the front up?!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Someone else chimed in on that last question.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've never propped up any of my boat trailers so the tires are off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the ground. The trailer is designed so that the weight is borne by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the the suspension and tires, and I doubt whether the tires &quot;know&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whether they have been sitting for two weeks or three months. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make sure the bearings are properly packed before storage, and that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the tires are properly inflated, and that's it for the trailer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Once the boat and engine are winterized and the batteries are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; removed, I have the boat shrinkwrapped.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do check on the boat every month. With the rig on its own wheels,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if I have to move it for some reason, it's no big deal to do so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Harry,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When I had a runabout, and kept the boat stored on the trailer, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ALWAYS kept the trailer propped up using trailer jacks.  The reason
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I did, was my father (a mechanic engineer) told me to do it.  He was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; emphatic that the weight of the tires sitting on one section of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tire over the winter, would cause the tire to become permanently
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unbalanced (I think he said a &quot;flat spot&quot;.  He also said the tires
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would crack prematurely,  where they sat on the ground.  I also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (based upon his recommendations) made sure the tires were covered
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with a tarp to make sure they did not dry rot from UV degradation.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Both were very easy to do and took less than 5 minutes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now was he correct, heck, I don't know, but the tires were over 20
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yrs old when I sold the boat and trailer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm sure that all the cars sitting in dealer storage lots for
&gt;&gt;&gt; three or four months are propped up on frame jacks so their tires
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't develop flat spots. So are all the new RVs and travel trailers
&gt;&gt;&gt; at the distribution centers. And of course, the 150 boats that my
&gt;&gt;&gt; dealer stores on trailers over the winter, they're all stored on
&gt;&gt;&gt; blocks and jacks, too.

&gt;&gt; Damn, I normally didn't double check my father on engineering type
&gt;&gt; recommendations, but I just did on this.  It looks like not only did
&gt;&gt; my Dad recommend it, but so do Trailer Mfg'ers:

&gt;&gt; http://www.tidewatertrailers.com/wst_page10.html

&gt;&gt; Winterizing Your Trailer

&gt;&gt; 1. Park in a protected area or cover your trailer with a boat cover or
&gt;&gt; tarp. Cover tires to protect from UV rays of the sun.
&gt;&gt; 2. Block the wheels, or better, jack up the trailer so the tires do
&gt;&gt; not come in contact with the ground
&gt;&gt; 3. Fill / repack wheel bearings via Sure Lube
&gt;&gt; Moisture can cause rust and possible bearing damage, especially when a
&gt;&gt; trailer sits idle.
&gt;&gt; 4. Lubricate moving parts such as roller bushings, winches and other
&gt;&gt; rolling parts with lightweight household oil.
&gt;&gt; 5. Tighten loose nuts and bolts.

&gt;&gt; 6. Block the tongue and crank the tongue jack to the completely closed
&gt;&gt; position.

&gt;&gt; http://www.discoverboating.com/resources/article.aspx?id=93

&gt;&gt; Also

&gt;&gt; Store boat in a garage or other temperature controlled facility if
&gt;&gt; possible. If not, cover the boat with shrink-wrap or a large tarp.
&gt;&gt; If your boat is stored on a trailer, block the wheels so they are off
&gt;&gt; the ground and loosen tie-down straps to reduce stress on the hull.
&gt;&gt; Store your inflatables away from rodents, who love to eat hypalon and
&gt;&gt; PVC fabrics. Also, do not leave the inflatable exposed to the elements
&gt;&gt; - clouds do not inhibit UV rays.

&gt; Well, Reggies, if and when you ever have a boat, you can block up your
&gt; tires.

&gt;&gt; Whatever floats your boat. You didn't jack the tires off the
&gt;&gt; ground...you probably jacked the axles off the ground.

&gt; One major advantage of leaving the trailer with the tires *on* the ground is
&gt; that in the spring you will notice that they are flat before taking the
&gt; jackstands out, only to have to jack it back up again.

&gt; Saves time.

That, too, though surprisingly the radials on my last trailer and on the
new one don't seem to lose much air. Over the winter, the last trailer's
tires lost maybe a pound over the winter. I know, because I checked the
tires when I stored the boat and when I took it out of storage.

I do try to park in areas where there is at least partial shade,
especially for the tires, and when I store for the winter, I duct tape
plastic bags on the sides of the fenders so that the tires are screened
from the sun.

I've got an old sports car sitting in a garage. It is sitting on its
Dunlop tires. The car sits for six months at a time. I have never
noticed any &quot;flat spots&quot; on the tires related to storage. Car spends
most of its life under a couple of sewn-together bedsheets.

I would like to do that, but you would be very surprised at what our water
does to stuff left in it over the winter.
I left a 400 pound sailboat in a large hoist.  Come Spring it was 30' away,
turned 180 degrees (at least; maybe 900, who knows) and one hoist leg was
bent.  I was happy the boat was out of the water.
My neighbors run pumps under their docks all winter so they don't get ripped
out; but I don't have electricity.  I have had some boards ripped off it,
but thankfully the dock has held up.

Harry,

I remembered one of the other reasons my father recommended jacking the
trailer off so the tires did not sit on the ground.  Since I didn't
check the air pressure of the tires during the winter, he said it was
common for the tires to become low in pressure, with would cause
additional stress on the sideways, and cause the sidewalls to crack
prematurely.  I had a tank of air I would bring up in the spring to fill
the tires before the first time I used it.  You have stated many times,
that you don't keep your boats for more than a few years (after only
using them for very few hours), so  it really isn't important for you.

But the original poster was wondering what the recommendation of the
experts are, here is another one who recommends jacking the tires off
the ground.

Harry,
I have never understood why anyone in their right mind would make up
boat ownership.  Since you have fabricated so many boat ownership
stories, (that no one every believes), why do you do it?

The one story I liked best when you posted a wav file of your boat horn
to prove you actually owned a Lobster boat.

I really don't care if anyone believes I own a boat or not, it really
isn't important

&gt;&gt; I've got an old sports car sitting in a garage. It is sitting on its
&gt;&gt; Dunlop tires. The car sits for six months at a time. I have never
&gt;&gt; noticed any &quot;flat spots&quot; on the tires related to storage. Car spends
&gt;&gt; most of its life under a couple of sewn-together bedsheets.

&gt; My '67 GTO has Coker Redlines on it.  After sitting for several months they
&gt; develop a small flat spot that is noticeable for a couple of miles, then
&gt; they round out.

My old car is a 1959-60 model, and British, so there's no assurance that
even if the tires were round, the wheels would be.

&gt;&gt; I remembered one of the other reasons my father recommended jacking

&gt;&gt; didn't check the air pressure of the tires during the winter, he said
&gt;&gt; it was common for the tires to become low in pressure, with would
&gt;&gt; cause additional stress on the sideways, and cause the sidewalls to
&gt;&gt; crack prematurely.  I had a tank of air I would bring up in the spring
&gt;&gt; to fill the tires before the first time I used it.  You have stated

I probably have 10-15 hrs since labor day, so you probably have used
your boat more this fall.  I hope you keep using it, it looks like a
nice fishing boat for the bay.  I am always amazed at how many boats
either sit in dry storage or in their slip for years without anyone
using them.

Actually Harry's previous boat, the pilot house Parker, was much
better suited to Chesapeake Bay.  Except on the calmest days you don't
see many boats under 24 or 25 feet out there.  We spent 4 weeks and
about 500 nautical miles criss crossing the Chesapeake in late
September through mid-October.  There are some days when anything less
than 35 to 40 ft would be inappropriate.

When the wind blows, Wayne's b.s. flows. On any weekend morning, there
are three to four dozen trucks with empty trailers near the launch ramp
at BP Marina, indicating guys out fishing, and at least half the slips
are empty, too. The trailerboats are for mostly 17-22' boats. When I
tried to raise you on the VHF last week, I was over on the other side of
the Bay, and for a while was in the middle of at least 40 small boats
and some larger boats, all bottom or drift fishing. Every day I've been
out in September and October, and I was out many times, there were
plenty of small boats out on the Bay.

&gt; about 500 nautical miles criss crossing the Chesapeake in late
&gt; September through mid-October.  There are some days when anything less
&gt; than 35 to 40 ft would be inappropriate.

There were very days in the time period you mentioned when a 35-40
footer was necessary to be safe on the water.

I think you've spent so much time on that overstuffed, old,
energy-wasting, slow-moving barge of yours, you have no idea of what fun
being out in a small boat can be.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; - Did the previous owner tell you anything about the wheel bearings? Do
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you see something like this in the centers of your wheels?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.bearingbuddy.com/ Or, do you just see a metal cap?

&gt; &gt;&gt; There is a plastic cover over them.  Is that adequate since it is exposed
&gt; &gt;&gt; to water so little?

&gt; &gt; Unless you're talking about the soft plastic cover that can cover Bearing
&gt; &gt; Buddies, I honestly don't know. Are you sure there's not a metal cover under
&gt; &gt; the plastic thing? Plastic seems like a weak option in a place that could
&gt; &gt; brush against a curb.

&gt; &gt; If the original owner didn't mention when he last repacked or replaced the
&gt; &gt; bearings, it's probably worthwhile to get it done so you've got a starting
&gt; &gt; point for a maintenance schedule.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; - Before it's too cold to work outdoors without gloves, take a good look
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; at all wire junctions. Make sure all splices look clean, not corroded. If
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; they're made with electrical tape over soldered wire joints, that's
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sloppy and they should be replaced with crimped connections covered with
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; heat shrink tubing.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yeah, they are all covered with electrical tape that is falling off;
&gt; &gt;&gt; expect the connections are pretty bad underneath also.  Wouldn't soldered
&gt; &gt;&gt; joints covered with shrink be okay?  I did that for my invisible fence 15
&gt; &gt;&gt; years ago and they are still okay.  But it is probably easier to crimp
&gt; &gt;&gt; them anyhow if that is better.

&gt; &gt; Solder + shrink tubing isn't too bad, as long as you check the joint for
&gt; &gt; sharp edges that might puncture the shrink tubing, and file or clip them.
&gt; &gt; Crimps are easier, but you should use a properly designed tool, and they not
&gt; &gt; so easy to find. The jaws on most tools don't shape the crimp correctly as
&gt; &gt; it squeezes them, because the jaws are almost flat, with slight curves
&gt; &gt; carved into them. That's useless. At this links below, check out the tool,
&gt; &gt; and click on the picture for a closer look at what the jaws should look
&gt; &gt; like:

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; - Spare tire: Got one? Is it secured to the trailer with a cable lock or
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; some other method?

&gt; &gt;&gt; That's funny actually.  Before pulling the boat out I checked and found
&gt; &gt;&gt; the spare was flat.  Fortunately it held pressure okay; but the bigger
&gt; &gt;&gt; problem was that it was locked on and I didn't have the key!  When I put
&gt; &gt;&gt; the boat in I didn't have the key either, and the tire was probably flat
&gt; &gt;&gt; then also; good thing I didn't need it.  Came off in 2 seconds with an
&gt; &gt;&gt; angle grinder.

&gt; &gt;&gt; What about propping the front up?!

&gt; &gt; Someone else chimed in on that last question.

&gt; I've never propped up any of my boat trailers so the tires are off the
&gt; ground. The trailer is designed so that the weight is borne by the the
&gt; suspension and tires, and I doubt whether the tires &quot;know&quot; whether they
&gt; have been sitting for two weeks or three months. I make sure the
&gt; bearings are properly packed before storage, and that the tires are
&gt; properly inflated, and that's it for the trailer.

&gt; Once the boat and engine are winterized and the batteries are removed, I
&gt; have the boat shrinkwrapped.

&gt; I do check on the boat every month. With the rig on its own wheels, if I
&gt; have to move it for some reason, it's no big deal to do so.- Hide quoted text -

Neither have I. My boat and trailer sat in my driveway one year for 4
months. Now, when I hooked it up, and took it to the lake, I noticed
in the first few miles that the tires seemed to have a flat spot,
feeling like they were out of balance. It smoothed out almost
immediately.

Undefined, I am sure. I store for about four months up here, maybe four

Harry,
Someone asked for recommendations, I told him what I did based upon my
father recommendations.  If you review this thread, you will see you are
the one who tried to make an issue of it.  Heck, I really don't care
what anyone else does with their boat or trailer.  You seemed to be
insulted because my father and the trailer and tire mfg'ers didn't agree
with you.   As I said, I never researched the subject, I just assumned
he knew what he was talking about.  While he was not always correct
about all subjects, if he pertained to a mechanical issue, he was very
rarely wrong.

Harry,
Nope, this weekend my marina asked me if they could pull my boat and
store it on the hard, so they could move a larger boat into my slip, due
to low water.  Since I am a nice guy and understood their problem, I
told them sure, no problem.  They then agreed to winterize the the
engine and fresh water system for free.  It is amazing how good karma
begets good karma.  On the plus side, I can change my outdrive boots
this winter without paying for a haul.

You seem to have an anger management issue.  What seems to be the problem?

If you look at the bottom of the brochure you will see they list the
tires they recommend for boat trailers.  It is the last tires just
before the list the recommended care and feeding of RV/Trailer Tires.
