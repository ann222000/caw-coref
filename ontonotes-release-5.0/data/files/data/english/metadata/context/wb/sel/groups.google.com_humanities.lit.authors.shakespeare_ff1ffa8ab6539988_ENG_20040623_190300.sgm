It's easiest for me to be less than an apologist for the Oxford
attribution case, considering the main points I find when searching
sites. That Oxford is not Shakespeare is mainly because:

1) he died in 1604, before Shakespeare's late plays were in evidence;
2) he had character flaws indicated by circumstances describing him as
a) a murderer, b) deadbeat dad, c) sexual adventurer and deviant, d)
irresponsible abdication of a military mission assigned by Elizabeth
during time of the Spanish Armada, e) irresponsible management of his
financial affairs, and f) importuning Elizabeth for favors;
3) known facts about Shakespeare that mesh with Stratman but do not
mesh with Oxford;
4) he had a mediocre reputation among writers of the time, who
typically omit him from consideration unless more than a few are
named;
5) his style differs from that of Shakespeare in a) verse forms, b)
spellings, d) worst poetry is recognized as &quot;pretentious doggerel,&quot; e)
deficiency of language skills.

Alleged deficiency of superior literary skills seems critical. From
Sobran's study which compares select images and words from Oxford with
Shakespeare's similar use in poetry, I can refer to the few
selections of Oxford's poetry cited. Are these by Shakespeare?

1. Ev'n as the wax both melt, or dew consume away
Before the sun, so I behold, through careful thoughts decay.

2. Unsettled still like haggards wild they range,
These gentle birds that fly from man to man;
Who would not scorn and shake them from the fist
And let them fly, fair fools, which way they list.

3.(Oxford's shortest poem)
Were I a king I might command content;
Were I obscure unknown would be my cares,
And were I dead no thoughts should me torment,
Nor words, nor wrongs, nor love, nor hate, nor fears;
A doubtful choice of these things which to crave,
A kingdom or a cottage or a grave.

4. And let her feel the power of all your might,
And let her have her most desire with speed,
And let her pine away both day anal night
And let her moan, and none lament her need;
And let all those that shall her see
Despise her state and pity me.

An Oxford English sonnet. Is this by Shakespeare?

[Who taught thee first to sigh?]

Who taught thee first to sigh, alas, my heart?
Who taught thy tongue the woeful words of plaint?
Who filled your eyes with tears of bitter smart?
Who gave thee grief, and made thy joys to faint?

Who first did paint with colors pale thy face?
Who first did break thy sleeps of quiet rest?
Above the rest in court who gave thee grace?
Who made thee strive, in honor to be best?

In constant truth to bide so firm and sure?
To scorn the world, regarding but thy friends?
With patient mind each passion to endure?
In one desire to settle to the end?

Love then thy choice, wherein such choice thou bind
As nought but death may ever change thy mind.

To conclude my survey of the Oxford attribution, I note that
apologists argue in defense that: 1) differences in style from
Shakespeare are developmental; 2) that there was a conspiracy to hide
Oxford's identity, including use of Stratman as a straw man; 3) that
his death was faked; and 4) that he had a secret, special relationship
with Elizabeth.

May 1564 Th' Abridgement of the histories of TROGUS POMPEIUS
-- by Arthur Golding

Dedication to Edward deVere:

&lt;&lt;It is not unknown to others, and I have had experience thereof myself,
how earnest a desire your honour hath NATURALLY graffed in you to read,
peruse, and communicate with others as well the histories of ancient
times . . . and that without a certain PREGNANCY of WIT.&gt;&gt;

John Soowthern, in Pandora (1584) wrote:

&quot;De Vere, that hath given him in part:
The love, the war, honour and art,
And with them an eternal fame.
Among our well-renowned men,
De Vere merits a silver pen
Eternally to write his honour.
A man so honoured as thee,
And both of the Muses and me.&quot;

WILLiam WEBBE's A Discourse on English Poetry (1586)

&quot;I may not omit the deserved commendations of many honorable and noble
Lords, and Gentlemen, in her Majesty's Court, which in the rare devices

the right honorable Earle of Oxford may challenge to himself the title
of the most excellent among the rest.&quot;

George Puttenham, in The Arte of English Poesie (1589) wrote: &quot;And in
Her Majesty's time that now are have sprung up another crew of Courtly
makers, Noblemen and Gentlemen of Her Majesty's own servants, who
have written excellently well as it would appear if their doings could be
found out and made public with the rest, of which number is first the
noble gentleman Edward Earl of Oxford.&quot;

&quot;Case&quot; dismissed due to lack of evidence.
Thanks for the laughs.

Court humored by parody of scholarship.

Oxfordians easily identified by their spite and/or dishonesty:
Crowley and Neuendorffer, spite with a little dishonesty.
Price and Kositsky, dishonesty with some spite.

Drawing a pigtail once does not cause lifelong illiteracy as
these vindictive anti-Judites would have their readers
believe.

NO Oxfordian can add to this list of four, possibly five,
FACTS that support the Earl of Oxford as the writer
of Shakespeare...

- de Vere was alive during a portion of the Shakespeare era
- de Vere was in England during a portion of the Shakespeare era
- de Vere was literate
- de Vere was English-speaking
- de Vere was male (assuming the poet was male)

...though that fifth one WAS suggested by Oxfordian Volker Multhopp
and I think it makes the list stronger (as strong as it will get).

Speculation is fair, Paul, Art, Diana, and Lynne. But twisting all
of the historical record to accommodate some weird alternative
for your own sick pleasure is not.

Either add to the list of FACTS or give it up. You can't live on
spite and/or dishonesty forever.

7) Numerous minor points mesh perfectly with Shakespeare's life but
not at all with Oxford's. I would argue, if I had time, that Robert
Greene's &quot;upstart crow&quot; of 1592 has a 95 percent chance of referring
to the historical William Shakespeare, that A Funeral Elegy of 1612
has a 50-50 chance of being Shakespeare's authentic late work, and
that the Passionate Pilgrim fracas of 1612 refers with a 99-44/100
percent certainty to a living - and irate - author whose name was
William Shakespeare.

&gt;&gt; 1. Ev'n as the wax both melt, or dew consume away
&gt;&gt; Before the sun, so I behold, through careful thoughts decay.

&gt;&gt; 2. Unsettled still like haggards wild they range,
&gt;&gt; These gentle birds that fly from man to man;
&gt;&gt; Who would not scorn and shake them from the fist
&gt;&gt; And let them fly, fair fools, which way they list.

&gt;&gt; 3.(Oxford's shortest poem)
&gt;&gt; Were I a king I might command content;
&gt;&gt; Were I obscure unknown would be my cares,
&gt;&gt; And were I dead no thoughts should me torment,
&gt;&gt; Nor words, nor wrongs, nor love, nor hate, nor fears;
&gt;&gt; A doubtful choice of these things which to crave,
&gt;&gt; A kingdom or a cottage or a grave.

&gt;&gt; 4. And let her feel the power of all your might,
&gt;&gt; And let her have her most desire with speed,
&gt;&gt; And let her pine away both day anal night
&gt;&gt; And let her moan, and none lament her need;
&gt;&gt; And let all those that shall her see
&gt;&gt; Despise her state and pity me.

&gt;&gt; An Oxford English sonnet. Is this by Shakespeare?

Wow indeed. Where does he get these percentages from? I'd agree that
&quot;upstart crow&quot; probably refers to WS of Stratford, though not in any
positive way. Discussion in Knoxville more or less indicated that the
passage is so ambiguous (just like the para in the PP1612) that it can be
read with almost any spin on it one pleases.

But all that aside, if Alan, in 1997, believed that the Funeral Elegy had a
50-50 chance of being Shakespeare's late authentic work, and now he believes
it has a zero per cent chance, what does that say for any other percentages
he might throw around? We also know that at one point Alan said that the
marginalia in Oxford's Geneva had a 99% chance of being Oxford's, and then
changed his mind and said it had a 99% chance of not being his. He seems
remarkably free with his percentages.

And by the way, are these all the points he could find?

Hundreds of points mesh with Oxford's life. Alan knows this very well, but
suggests these are coincidences.

Best wishes,
Lynne, who had up till now stayed out of this argument and will now go back
to her work.

&gt; It's easiest for me to be less than an apologist for the Oxford
&gt; attribution case, considering the main points I find when searching
&gt; sites. That Oxford is not Shakespeare is mainly because:

&gt; 1) he died in 1604, before Shakespeare's late plays were in evidence;

"/>

Now look, Bookburn, you're a very nice chap, but you also know perfectly
well that the orthodox timeline for Shakespeare's plays is predicated on the
life span of Shakespeare of Stratford. Only one play (The Tempest) possibly
has one source (The Strachey letter) that is dated after Oxford's death, but
there is plenty of argument about whether the Strachey letter was necessary
when there were so many other sources floating around. The only other
argument I can find is based on the word equivocator, in Macbeth, but
&quot;equivocation&quot; had existed for many years prior to Oxford's death.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2) he had character flaws indicated by circumstances describing him as
&gt; a) a murderer, b) deadbeat dad, c) sexual adventurer and deviant, d)
&gt; irresponsible abdication of a military mission assigned by Elizabeth
&gt; during time of the Spanish Armada, e) irresponsible management of his
&gt; financial affairs, and f) importuning Elizabeth for favors;

"/>

Yes. Alan Nelson goes on about this all the time, although some of the
labels (murderer, for example) are iffy. Nevertheless, how does his bad
behaviour disqualify him as an author? In fact, many psychologists (Kay
Jamieson, for example) state there is a high degree of correlation between
bipolar affective disorder and creativity. Almost every author I know is
either bipolar or has bipolar members of the family. To my mind, Oxford's
character flaws make him more, not less likely, to be an author. And
Shakespeare was no &quot;gentle Will.&quot; He wrote Titus Andronicus, to give but one
glaring example of his ability to look at the dark side.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Simply not true. He was called the &quot;best for comedy&quot; and was also singled
out as the best writer among the nobility, if their works could only be
known under their own names.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 5) his style differs from that of Shakespeare in a) verse forms, b)
&gt; spellings, d) worst poetry is recognized as &quot;pretentious doggerel,&quot; e)
&gt; deficiency of language skills.

"/>

First, I'd say you have no idea whether the spellings differ, as we have no
work of William Shakespeare in manuscript. Alan and I (and others) have been
round this mulberry bush on this several times. Oxford's early published
poetry shows no idiosyncracies of spelling. His worst poetry has been
sometimes called doggerel, but it may have been written very early. We
simply don't know. And how good do you find Edward III, which is attributed
to Shakespeare? What I believe we're seeing is the apprenticeship of an
artist.

Deficiency of language skills? You're joking, right? How do you account for
his letters? Here's a small sample: &quot;The world is so cunning as of a shadow
they can make a substance, and a likelihood a truth.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Alleged deficiency of superior literary skills seems critical. From
&gt; Sobran's study which compares select images and words from Oxford with
&gt; Shakespeare's similar use in poetry, I can refer to the few
&gt; selections of Oxford's poetry cited. Are these by Shakespeare?

&gt; 1. Ev'n as the wax both melt, or dew consume away
&gt; Before the sun, so I behold, through careful thoughts decay.

&gt; 2. Unsettled still like haggards wild they range,
&gt; These gentle birds that fly from man to man;
&gt; Who would not scorn and shake them from the fist
&gt; And let them fly, fair fools, which way they list.

"/>

This is to my mind a very fine poem, and one of the reasons Oxfordian
scholars try to tie it to Oxford. There are his initials on one copy of it,
but I believe other initials on another copy. I believe &quot;Women&quot; is almost
certainly Shakespeare, replete with one of his bits of bawdy.

Where is &quot;My Mind To Me A Kingdom Is&quot;? One of the most anthologised poems of
all time, and a very fine one, in my estimation and the estimation of many
others, Stratfordians and Oxfordians alike. May gives it to Oxford rather
than Dyer. To end speculation about his attribution, I asked him in a bus in
Knoxville. He is considered the expert.

You are also not taking into account that these are for the most part poems
in the style of the mid-century. Again, they argue that Oxford was very
young when he wrote them. And their &quot;deficiencies&quot; are for the most part
just a patterning on a style that was popular at the time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; To conclude my survey of the Oxford attribution, I note that
&gt; apologists argue in defense that: 1) differences in style from
&gt; Shakespeare are developmental;

"/>

Did you know that only one of Oxford's poems (in Cardanus Comfort) was ever
meant to be published? The rest were stolen or pirated, and could date from
as early as the 1560s, when Oxford was a teen. This was news to me too. I
learned it in Knoxville, from an orthodox speaker.

2) that there was a conspiracy to hide

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Oxford's identity, including use of Stratman as a straw man;

"/>

There are many conspiracies in life. Why is this one so unlikely that we are
called conspiracy theorists? We also know from documents of the time that

a) authorship was not considered important in the way it is now.
b) There were other pseudonyms or cover ups. This is suggested in the
contemporaneous literature.

3) that

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; his death was faked;

"/>

This is a new one to me, and certainly not what most Oxfordians think.

and 4) that he had a secret, special relationship

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; with Elizabeth.

"/>

We know from records of the time that at one point, while he was quite
young, he was the Queen's favourite.

Just thought I'd put my points (and I'm by no means an Oxfordian expert)
against yours. Will not argue further on this as I'm bored with discussing
authorship.

Best wishes,
Lynne

&lt;snip&gt;

So almost EVERY single thing I say in my
exegeses of the sonnets is not merely
wrong, it is utterly and completely wrong?
All the allusions, puns and references are
entirely imaginary and quite fictitious?
Almost any traditional Stratfordian
interpretation is far superior?

IF that is the case, then it should be very
easy to demonstrate -- for each and every
claimed 'allusion', 'pun' or 'reference'. Why
don't you do that -- instead of recycling
this ancient old rubbish? You might even
find something interesting to say about
the sonnets.

You could, for example, show how Sonnet 7
might just as well describe some other
coronation (that of, say, Elizabeth II) or
some other event, such as the sinking of
the Titanic or the first landing on the Moon,
or some event in the Stratman's life -- the
death of his son, or a fire in Stratford, etc.,
etc.

Why can't you at least make an effort?
Or, if not, say why you can't make that
effort?

Paul.

P.S. This is addressed to all Strats, and
quasi-Strats; to anyone who supports

anyone who supports any other theory

Now look, LynnE, you too seem to be a very nice
person, but it does seem that you may not have
been paying attention to what's been going on.

On the assumption that you have Excel (and if not
I suggest you find someone who has) may I suggest
that you take a look at the Excel workbook which
is at   ?

There you will find how one combination of stylo-
metric features of the works of Shakespeare shows
itself when the dates according to several eminent
Shakespearean scholars are applied to it - dates
which have been arrived at in each case with very
little, or no, regard to this characteristic.

Having looked at these, I invite you to consider
the only Oxfordian dating that I know of - that of
Eva Turner Clark - and ask yourself whether you
truly believe that she is on the right track, or
whether you yourself can come up with a better
set of dates. Be warned, though. Paul has already
suggested the possiblity that each date should be
moved *precisely* ten years back in time. I trust
you will have a little more sense than to suggest
anything so ludicrous.

As you know, I tend to think that Christopher
Marlowe beats Oxford hands down as the probable
author, which should explain to you why I find
the worksheet &quot;Taylor (2)&quot; upon which I have
superimposed Marlowe's figures, encouraging.

I would be really interested to know what you,
as one of the apparently less fanatical Oxfordians
makes of these data.

You need to take a course in poetry, Tom. The stanza structure is identical.
The rhythm and meter are similar, although I'd say there are slight
variations in lines 2 and 4. I would also add that many of the verses in V
and A have very little enjambment, if any at all. I found only one line
enjambed in the first two stanzas when I just looked. Enambment, with
Shakespeare, may be a sign of maturation and the fact that poetry styles are
changing over this period.

I'd like to point out that the logic and argument are almost identical in
type. And look here:

Were I a king
Had I no eyes
(The beginning of the argument; the set up, as it were)

And WERE I DEAD no thoughts should me torment, (line 3)
Or WERE I DEAF thy outward parts would move (line 3)

NOR words, NOR wrongs, NOR love, NOR hate, NOR fears; (line 4)
Though NEITHER eyes NOR ears, to hear NOR see, (line 5)

I do see surprising similarities here, sufficient to say that if &quot;Were I a
King&quot; could not possibly be Shakespeare, as suggested by BB, neither could
this verse from V and A. Or perhaps Oxford wrote it, Sidney responded to it,
and Shakespeare copied both of them. We know that Oxford could not have
copied Shakespeare, and that the poem is relatively early, because of the
Sidney response, which had to occur before 1586.

And I promised myself I wouldn't respond any more on this thread.

&gt; There you will find how one combination of stylo-

&gt; little, or no, regard to this characteristic.

&gt; Having looked at these, I invite you to consider
&gt; the only Oxfordian dating that I know of - that of

There's an Oxfordian dating project going on right now. I'll be able to
comment with more authority once I've seen it. I believe Sobran (shudder)
has also provisionally dated the plays.

&gt; As you know, I tend to think that Christopher

Well, once you give me excellent data that Marlowe was still alive, and I
can find a program that will translate the worksheet for me, I'll be happy

| &gt; It's easiest for me to be less than an apologist for the Oxford
| &gt; attribution case, considering the main points I find when
searching
| &gt; sites. That Oxford is not Shakespeare is mainly because:
| &gt;
| &gt; 1) he died in 1604, before Shakespeare's late plays were in
evidence;
|
| Now look, Bookburn, you're a very nice chap, but you also know
perfectly
| well that the orthodox timeline for Shakespeare's plays is
predicated on the life span of Shakespeare of Stratford.

Please; I'm only surveying the status of the Oxford case on usenet. I
find it is a point of serious concern that a 1604 death before the
publication of the 1609 sonnets and First Folio in 1623 makes us
wonder about the life-span factor.

Only one play (The Tempest) possibly
| has one source (The Strachey letter) that is dated after Oxford's
death, but
| there is plenty of argument about whether the Strachey letter was
necessary
| when there were so many other sources floating around. The only
other
| argument I can find is based on the word equivocator, in Macbeth,
but
| &quot;equivocation&quot; had existed for many years prior to Oxford's death.

So I take it your argument doesn't depend on Oxford surviving beyond
1604; that he could have written everything earlier and delayed its
publication. Of course, there are records of performances, too.

| &gt; 2) he had character flaws indicated by circumstances describing
him as
| &gt; a) a murderer, b) deadbeat dad, c) sexual adventurer and deviant,
d)
| &gt; irresponsible abdication of a military mission assigned by
Elizabeth
| &gt; during time of the Spanish Armada, e) irresponsible management of
his
| &gt; financial affairs, and f) importuning Elizabeth for favors;
|
| Yes. Alan Nelson goes on about this all the time, although some of
the
| labels (murderer, for example) are iffy. Nevertheless, how does his
bad
| behaviour disqualify him as an author? In fact, many psychologists
(Kay
| Jamieson, for example) state there is a high degree of correlation
between
| bipolar affective disorder and creativity. Almost every author I
know is
| either bipolar or has bipolar members of the family. To my mind,
Oxford's
| character flaws make him more, not less likely, to be an author. And
| Shakespeare was no &quot;gentle Will.&quot; He wrote Titus Andronicus, to give
but one
| glaring example of his ability to look at the dark side.

And Shakespeare wrote about &quot;sweet are the uses of adversity&quot; and how
they are like the jewel in the head of a venemous toad.

| &gt; 3) known facts about Shakespeare that mesh with Stratman but do
not
| &gt; mesh with Oxford;
|
| Have responded to this elsewhere.
|
| &gt; 4) he had a mediocre reputation among writers of the time, who
| &gt; typically omit him from consideration unless more than a few are
| &gt; named;
|
| Simply not true. He was called the &quot;best for comedy&quot; and was also
singled
| out as the best writer among the nobility, if their works could only
be
| known under their own names.
|
| &gt; 5) his style differs from that of Shakespeare in a) verse forms,
b)
| &gt; spellings, d) worst poetry is recognized as &quot;pretentious
doggerel,&quot; e)
| &gt; deficiency of language skills.
|
| First, I'd say you have no idea whether the spellings differ, as we
have no
| work of William Shakespeare in manuscript. Alan and I (and others)
have been
| round this mulberry bush on this several times. Oxford's early
published
| poetry shows no idiosyncracies of spelling. His worst poetry has
been
| sometimes called doggerel, but it may have been written very early.
We
| simply don't know. And how good do you find Edward III, which is
attributed
| to Shakespeare? What I believe we're seeing is the apprenticeship of
an
| artist.
|
| Deficiency of language skills? You're joking, right? How do you
account for
| his letters? Here's a small sample: &quot;The world is so cunning as of a
shadow
| they can make a substance, and a likelihood a truth.&quot;
|
| &gt;
| &gt; Alleged deficiency of superior literary skills seems critical.
From
| &gt; Sobran's study which compares select images and words from Oxford
with
| &gt; Shakespeare's similar use in poetry, I can refer to the few
| &gt; selections of Oxford's poetry cited. Are these by Shakespeare?
| &gt;
| &gt; 1. Ev'n as the wax both melt, or dew consume away
| &gt; Before the sun, so I behold, through careful thoughts decay.
| &gt;
| &gt; 2. Unsettled still like haggards wild they range,
| &gt; These gentle birds that fly from man to man;
| &gt; Who would not scorn and shake them from the fist
| &gt; And let them fly, fair fools, which way they list.
|
| This is to my mind a very fine poem, and one of the reasons
Oxfordian
| scholars try to tie it to Oxford. There are his initials on one copy
of it,
| but I believe other initials on another copy. I believe &quot;Women&quot; is
almost
| certainly Shakespeare, replete with one of his bits of bawdy.

Excuse me, but &quot;fly, fair fools&quot; give me a chuckle. I do think it's
possible that if Oxford's poetry were acknowledged as Shakespeare
these past centuries, we all might have learned to like his as well.

| &gt; 3.(Oxford's shortest poem)
| &gt; Were I a king I might command content;
| &gt; Were I obscure unknown would be my cares,
| &gt; And were I dead no thoughts should me torment,
| &gt; Nor words, nor wrongs, nor love, nor hate, nor fears;
| &gt; A doubtful choice of these things which to crave,
| &gt; A kingdom or a cottage or a grave.
|
| From &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;:
|
| &quot;Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love
| That inward beauty and invisible;
| Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move
| Each part in me that were but sensible.
| Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,
| Yet should I be in love by touching thee.
|
| The similarities, particularly of logic, are incredible.
|
|
|
| &gt;
| &gt; 4. And let her feel the power of all your might,
| &gt; And let her have her most desire with speed,
| &gt; And let her pine away both day anal night
| &gt; And let her moan, and none lament her need;
| &gt; And let all those that shall her see
| &gt; Despise her state and pity me.
| &gt;
| &gt; An Oxford English sonnet. Is this by Shakespeare?
|
| Is this a mature man? We simply don't know.
| &gt;
| &gt; [Who taught thee first to sigh?]
| &gt;
| &gt; Who taught thee first to sigh, alas, my heart?
| &gt; Who taught thy tongue the woeful words of plaint?
| &gt; Who filled your eyes with tears of bitter smart?
| &gt; Who gave thee grief, and made thy joys to faint?
| &gt;
| &gt; Who first did paint with colors pale thy face?
| &gt; Who first did break thy sleeps of quiet rest?
| &gt; Above the rest in court who gave thee grace?
| &gt; Who made thee strive, in honor to be best?
| &gt;
| &gt; In constant truth to bide so firm and sure?
| &gt; To scorn the world, regarding but thy friends?
| &gt; With patient mind each passion to endure?
| &gt; In one desire to settle to the end?
| &gt;
| &gt; Love then thy choice, wherein such choice thou bind
| &gt; As nought but death may ever change thy mind.
|
| Where is &quot;My Mind To Me A Kingdom Is&quot;? One of the most anthologised
poems of
| all time, and a very fine one, in my estimation and the estimation
of many
| others, Stratfordians and Oxfordians alike. May gives it to Oxford
rather
| than Dyer. To end speculation about his attribution, I asked him in
a bus in
| Knoxville. He is considered the expert.
|
| You are also not taking into account that these are for the most
part poems
| in the style of the mid-century. Again, they argue that Oxford was
very
| young when he wrote them. And their &quot;deficiencies&quot; are for the most
part
| just a patterning on a style that was popular at the time.

I think it's Crowley who argues that poetry is often best done when
young, like late teens.

| &gt; To conclude my survey of the Oxford attribution, I note that
| &gt; apologists argue in defense that: 1) differences in style from
| &gt; Shakespeare are developmental;
|
| Did you know that only one of Oxford's poems (in Cardanus Comfort)
was ever
| meant to be published? The rest were stolen or pirated, and could
date from
| as early as the 1560s, when Oxford was a teen. This was news to me
too. I
| learned it in Knoxville, from an orthodox speaker.
|
| 2) that there was a conspiracy to hide
| &gt; Oxford's identity, including use of Stratman as a straw man;
|
| There are many conspiracies in life. Why is this one so unlikely
that we are
| called conspiracy theorists? We also know from documents of the time
that
|
| a) authorship was not considered important in the way it is now.
| b) There were other pseudonyms or cover ups. This is suggested in
the
| contemporaneous literature.

I think this concerns more than the Hidden Hand convention. Isn't use
of Stratman as a front their whole lives, involving all of the
principals in the Will and FF, plus many commentators, even
government--in a conspiracy--required in the Oxford attribution?

| 3) that
| &gt; his death was faked;
|
| This is a new one to me, and certainly not what most Oxfordians
think.
|
| and 4) that he had a secret, special relationship
| &gt; with Elizabeth.
|
| We know from records of the time that at one point, while he was
quite
| young, he was the Queen's favourite.
|
| Just thought I'd put my points (and I'm by no means an Oxfordian
expert)
| against yours. Will not argue further on this as I'm bored with
discussing
| authorship.
|
| Best wishes,
| Lynne

Addressed to the Queen? use of bawdy for her delectation and
amusement? But this can be accounted for in Stratmanism, too. There
was a great cult of Virgin Queen worship that took the form of poetry
written to her about producing a royal succession, often
enthusiastically erotic. Shakespeare could have used that convention
in many ways, including the ironic, which you sometimes suggest. bb

Of course. And since we now know that Oxford didn't seek to publish any poem
(or as far as we know, any play) under his name during his lifetime, except
for the poem in CC, it's possible that much was delayed for a long time. And
after all, even if one accepts that WS of Stratford wrote the canon, some of
his plays didn't see the light of day until 1623, seven years after he died
and presumably many years after they were written.

I would say that the alliteration here, a kind of euphuism, marks the poem
as early. Style later changed. I still find it a very accomplished poem. But
then I'm a fond, if not fair, woman.

Every artist is different. I wrote my best poetry in my thirties and

| - Gary Kosinsky

I can only come up with secondary sources using the Internet. I
remember having info about the cult of the Virgin Queen and erotic
poetry addressing her in Shakespeare class, then a few years ago at
h.l.a.s. Right now what I have is as follows from several sources.

1. Elizabeth I and the Elizabethan Period:
a Brief Introduction

Even who is more commonly associated with drama, varied the rhyme
scheme and patterns of the sonnet form to suit his own purposes in an
elaborate sequence or &quot;cycle&quot; of over one hundred . The pursuit of a
literary life was viewed as an admirable and worthy endeavor, and
poets shared their work with each other and at court, vying for the
praise and patronage of the Queen and aristocracy. The Queen herself
wrote both poetry and music.

2. Sex, Poetry, and PowerSex The Cult of Queen Elizabeth

In sixteenth-century England, literary treatments of women could not
help but be affected by the fact that the country was ruled by a
virgin queen. Elizabeth customarily received adulation in language
similar to the Petrarchan mistress. Foreign ambassadors, noble
courtiers, and members of Parliament all participated in Elizabeth's
cult of love, showering her with extravagant compliments. &quot;We all
loved her,&quot; her godson Sir John Harrington wrote, &quot;for she said she
loved us.&quot;

3. Emily Spivey
The Cult of Elizabeth
. . . .
Through pageantry, through dance, and through play the practice became
quite common, during the Elizabethan period to portray the admiral
qualities of the English monarch as the center and founder of the
cosmic order in an almost divine characterization. Another portrayal
of Elizabeth, particularly in portraiture, is the embodiment of the
empire or the physical landscape. A good example of this would be the
'Ditchley Portrait'. This painting portrays Elizabeth standing on a
map of England, and every detail of the painting from the jewels in
her attire to the scene of rivers in the background represent an
essential portrayal of the Queen, and specifically the female
body, as the microcosm of the nation, the cosmos, and divinity and
order(Labriola 46-47).

Because throughout Elizabeth's reign, the Queen's sexuality and
marital possibilities determined political culture and her virginity
was emphasized so greatly through the cult, the distinction between
political and rotic/romantic discourse became blurred. The Elizabethan
correlation between sex and power was very strong, and because the
monarch was female, this correlation became even more concretized.
Even for the poets, to &quot;seek patronage .came to be understood as a
political act. (Labriola 43). Courting becomes then an allegory and
has more to do
with political power than with romantic love, despite its Petrarchan
disguise.

4. Michael Best
Propaganda and reality

. . . .
Representations of Elizabeth dating back to her coronation portray her
as an almost divine monarch; however, especially in the early stages
of her reign, she walked a very fine line. For example, shortly after
her coronation she was courted by many men who hoped to father the
next heir to the English throne. People began to speculate to the
extent that betting pools were run on who the next King would be.
Eventually, the line of candidates for the position of Elizabeth's
husband became so long it caused a royal scandal which threatened the
political stability of England. It is likely that at this time
Elizabeth consciously decided to remain single and adopt the persona
of the virgin queen, both to save appearances and for future political
maneuvering.

5. One up on a goddess

In 1601 a whole collection of madrigals was published, called The
Triumphs of Oriana. In it, all madrigals were framed as compliments
to the Queen, and all ended with the refrain &quot;Long live fair Oriana&quot;
(a reference to Elizabeth). , who set some of Shakespeare's songs, and
each contributed a madrigal. Weelkes' is a wonderful example of the
genre, and its lyrics are typical: as the Roman goddess Vesta was
descending from her shrine, attended by the vestal virgins, they saw
&quot;a maiden queen&quot; ascending. The vestal virgins desert the goddess and
join the train of the
queen, singing, of course, &quot;Long live fair Oriana.&quot;

More on this later, if I can find it. bookburn

&gt; This doesn't work for me, Peter, sorry. I don't have
&gt; Excel.

"/>

That's OK, I'm sure that one of your friends does.

Meanwhile, let me try to explain what this is about.

In 1598, Meres gave us a list of plays by Shakespeare
which must therefore have been written by then. To
this list we can perhaps also add the three plays we
now know of as Henry VI, parts 1, 2 &amp; 3, for which,
although they weren't mentioned by him, there is other
evidence of their existence by then.

If we then compare some aspects of the style of these
plays with the rest of the Shakespeare canon we find
that (for example) there is is a far greater use of
run-on lines and of feminine endings in the latter,
there being a statistically highly significant differ-
ence between them and the 'by 1598' list in each case.

One possible explanation of this phenomenon is that
Shakespeare's use of these techniques changed over
time. Whether he would have been unique in this or
not doesn't really matter, but one way to check if
it is so or not is to see whether a *trend* can be
identified in his use of these techniques, using
those dates which Shakespearean scholars generally
believe are the most likely ones for the plays to
have been written. At this stage it doesn't matter
how right or how wrong those dates are.

What I have done, therefore, is simply to take the
number of run-on lines and the number of feminine
endings for each play, and then to express the total
of these as a percentage of the number of lines of
verse. Although some form of multi-variate analysis
might be more appropriate, this is a simpler method,
and easier to explain.

What I found when I plotted these figures against the
dates suggested by a range of scholars was that a
*very* clear trend was observable in every case, even
though we know that these characteristics played very
little or no part in the scholars' reasoning as to
why these dates were the most likely.

What this does, of course, is to confirm our hypothesis
that the reason for the difference we spotted is that
Shakespeare's use of these techniques changed over time.
What it also provides, however, is confirmation of the
validity of the sort of dates they suggest, which in
all cases have those seven plays with the highest
scores being written *after* 1604.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; There you will find how one combination of stylo-
&gt;&gt; metric features of the works of Shakespeare shows
&gt;&gt; itself when the dates according to several eminent
&gt;&gt; Shakespearean scholars are applied to it - dates
&gt;&gt; which have been arrived at in each case with very
&gt;&gt; little, or no, regard to this characteristic.

&gt;&gt; Having looked at these, I invite you to consider
&gt;&gt; the only Oxfordian dating that I know of - that of
&gt;&gt; Eva Turner Clark -

&gt; There's an Oxfordian dating project going on right
&gt; now. I'll be able to comment with more authority once
&gt; I've seen it.

"/>

I will be very interested in the results, and I will
be amazed if anything other than a random scatter of
these figures (as is the case with Eva Turner Clark's
ones) is found when they are plotted in this way.

&gt;&gt; and ask yourself whether you
&gt;&gt; truly believe that she is on the right track, or
&gt;&gt; whether you yourself can come up with a better
&gt;&gt; set of dates. Be warned, though. Paul has already
&gt;&gt; suggested the possiblity that each date should be
&gt;&gt; moved *precisely* ten years back in time. I trust
&gt;&gt; you will have a little more sense than to suggest
&gt;&gt; anything so ludicrous.

&gt;&gt; As you know, I tend to think that Christopher
&gt;&gt; Marlowe beats Oxford hands down as the probable
&gt;&gt; author, which should explain to you why I find
&gt;&gt; the worksheet &quot;Taylor (2)&quot; upon which I have
&gt;&gt; superimposed Marlowe's figures, encouraging.

&gt;&gt; I would be really interested to know what you,
&gt;&gt; as one of the apparently less fanatical Oxfordians
&gt;&gt; makes of these data.

&gt; Well, once you give me excellent data that Marlowe
&gt; was still alive, and I can find a program that will
&gt; translate the worksheet for me, I'll be happy
&gt; to look at it.

Never mind the Marlowe bit for the moment. Just try
to explain how such highly valid trends can possibly
occur if the scholars are all wrong in their dating.

Just to interject, almost a non sequitur, but I've this morning had an email
from Robert Detobel which says: &quot;There is an article of mine in the
forthcoming SOS Newsletter. It is absolutely clear from references by Jonson
that Timon of Athens must have been written and staged by 1601 (orthodox
date: 1608). Othello must have been written and staged by 1598 as Ben Jonson
plainly refers to it in Every Man in His Humour (1598).&quot;

I thought the dating was in his book, *Alias Shakespeare.* Perhaps I am
mistaken, but I do seem to have a memory of it. Perhaps I'll check later.
It's upstairs.

With regard to &quot;Were I a King,&quot; Robert was also kind enough to send me the
following:

Regarding de Vere's poetry.

Were I a King.

Were I a king I might command content;
Were I obscure unknown would be my cares,
And were I dead no thoughts should me torment,
Nor words, nor wrongs, nor love, nor hate, nor fears;
A doubtful choice of these things which to crave,
A kingdom or a cottage or a grave.

and this from Richard II, III.ii:

The King shall do it. Must he be depos'd?
The King shall be contented. Must he lose
The name of king? A God's name, let it go.
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
My figur'd goblets for a dish of wood,
My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
My subjects for a pair of carved saints,
And my large kingdom for a little grave,
A little little grave, an obscure grave-

Thee are two more passages in that play.

(This appears to me to be a reworking of the poem--Best wishes, Lynne)

This is Peter fooling himself with numbers -- yet
again. Firstly, there is no ' . . this characteristic'.
A nearly infinite number of variables could be
extracted from the canon -- indicating some
possible change over time (sentence length,
word size, use of particular words, or part-
words, use of vowels, consonants, etc., etc.)
Peter has (following in the footsteps of some
illustrious Stratfordian 'scholars') taken two
measurements from this enormous pool. These
two variables (which are entirely independent
of each other) _seem_ to indicate a change in
the poet's style over time. But in neither case
are the trends strong.

So what does Peter do? Why, he adds them
together, to create ONE 'variable'. Now he has
something which provides very good 'results'.

(At least, I THINK that is what Peter is doing.
He may well be dividing one measurement by
the other, or dividing the squares of the
measurements -- or anything. He provides no
information on his source data, nor how he has
manipulated it -- as though it would be quite
impertinent for anyone to ask to see that sort
of thing. He _assumes_ that his basic data is
sound -- and unquestionably sound. This is
the sort of thing that drives professionals nuts.
It's typical of the garbage that you get from
loons on the internet. Yet Peter does this kind
of thing all the time -- no matter how often he
is told that it is not on.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - dates
&gt; which have been arrived at in each case with very
&gt; little, or no, regard to this characteristic.

"/>

This 'characteristic' comes from two quite
independent measures -- and BOTH do, in fact
provide the basis for the 'scholarly' dating.
For example, two quite early plays (Cymbeline
and Henry 8) are dated late largely on account
of their scores in these _independent_
measurements.

Of course, taking either measurement as a
basis for dating is next to insane in any event.
No justification for such an exercise is provided
from the WHOLE of English (or any other)
literature. No one would think to apply such a
'theory' to the works of any other author. The
idea here is that, through some 'unconscious'
process, his/her choice in some common policy
or practice -- like feminine endings, or run-on
lines -- will steadily but inexorably change in
one direction over the course of his or her
working career.

No one even conceives of the possibility of
applying such a theory to any other author in
this, or in any other, language. In effect, it
verges on the insane. It represents a level of
stupidity that can exist, and continue to exist,
only because no one ever questions it.
'Insanity' of this nature is almost boringly
routine in Shakespearean studies.

We have a 'discipline' where it has become
impolite to express scepticism; where it is
almost forbidden to ask questions or raise
doubts. It is more a religion than a field of
study. The reason for that is, of course, the
great big hole right in the middle, of which
everyone is aware, but about which no one
wants to talk. 'Scholarship' in such a field
can be no more than a joke.

Quasi-Strats like Peter or Lynne should, in
some theoretical way, be capable of asking
such questions. (They claim to be not of the
orthodox Church.) But, as we all know, their
capacity is severely limited. They have quite
unthinkingly adopted great chunks of the
standard doctrine, and adhere to them with
as much the fervour, and as little reflection,
as any of the great unwashed.

I've been meaning to find an excuse to learn Excel, so I downloaded
your spreadsheet, and now I'm guessing at which commands to use and
doing all kinds of things I hadn't intended to do. I may have to post
something for you so I can make sure I haven't accidentally missed or
deleted something. For now, I have the following questions:

1. What is the measure (not labeled) at the bottom of the column of
ratios? r-squared of the column? (If Pearson had known about
spell-checkers, he would have made all the variables upper-case. :-)
2. Some of the worksheets have extra columns. They are not all
supposed to have extra columns, are they? I'm worried I may have
accidentally deleted them while attempting to get everything onscreen
at once.
(3. A trivia question, for you or anyone who might know: Which
well-known company sponsored early research into statistics,
anonymously?)

I am relying on you not to have inserted a macro virus.

I also took a look at the Freidmans' book, as you'd suggested last
month, and read the first few chapters, but not the rest. I still
haven't got round to tracking down Foster's. My interests in this
area are likely not to coincide exactly with yours, I think, but I do
have an interest in mathematical methods of reasoning. Unfortunately,
very little experience with statistics, except calculating standard
deviations for physics lab.

&gt; I may have to post something for you so I can make
&gt; sure I haven't accidentally missed or deleted something.
&gt; For now, I have the following questions:

&gt; 1. What is the measure (not labeled) at the bottom of
&gt; the column of ratios? r-squared of the column? (If
&gt; Pearson had known about spell-checkers, he would have
&gt; made all the variables upper-case. :-)

"/>

That figure's not really relevant, and shouldn't be
there. It appears to be a very rough indication of
the average (add 'em all up and divide by how many).
You shouldn't do that with percentages, really, and
the actual mean is nearer to .40, but it would be
the one the software would use in calculating the R^2
figure in the top right hand corner of the chart.

This value is a measure of the validity of the trend-
line and shows what proportion of the overall deviation
from the mean (i.e. from that 41%) is probably due to
the trend, rather than to random factors.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2. Some of the worksheets have extra columns. They
&gt; are not all supposed to have extra columns, are they?
&gt; I'm worried I may have accidentally deleted them while
&gt; attempting to get everything onscreen at once.

No, that should be only on the one where I have super-
imposed the data for Marlowe's plays. I use a different
column so that they have a different symbol on the chart.

You are only a dunce in that you are making
a basic error -- and you keep on repeating it.
(The latter I might put down to the effects
of age -- it seems very difficult to learn new
things as one gets older.)

The basic error is simple. You cannot abstract
two independent variables from a set of data,
and then create a third 'super-variable' by
adding them (or multiplying or dividing or
whatever) on which you can perform useful
statistical measurements.

The problem of sequencing past events is
very common. You might have 40 fossils
of some genus, or 40 archaeological sites,
or 40 sets of clay pots. You can usually
extract hundreds or thousands of
measurements from them. Let's say you
have 40 buildings, and you notice that
amid hundreds of other items you've
measured, the door height _seems_ to
increase over time, and that the proportion
of potassium in the wall mortar _seems_
to go down over time (although you accept
that your provisional dating is extremely
uncertain). You cannot create a variable
called 'door height + wall potassium' and
work out a trend on that.

That is what you are doing here.

Paul.

I have already mentioned on HLAS the works of
Wentersdorf, Ledger, Merriam and Matthews, all
of whom use stylometric techniques which collapse
such specially selected variables into one figure.

Wentersdorf, for example, came up with a 'metrical
index' combining information about &quot;feminine endings,
alexandrines, extra mid-line syllables, extra syllables,
overflows, extreme overflows, unsplit lines with
pauses, and split lines&quot;. And Merriam &amp; Matthews
used five different ratios known to distinguish Marlowe
from Shakespeare as input to their artificial neural
network program. (And their work was, of course,
peer reviewed by experts).

Until you come up with a good reason for you
to be right and all of them to be wrong, then I will
feel quite confident in continuing to emulate them.

I know not 'strong'. In both cases the difference

So, when I said &quot;What I have done, therefore, is
simply to take the number of run-on lines and the

you understand?

There is in fact a small error in doing this, in
that, although I do not have the data, there must
be quite a few cases where both an enjambment and
a feminine ending occur in the one line. It would
therefore have been better to take the average of
the two figures. This would have had the effect
of halving them, but as this would only change
the y-axis scale, and not affect the R^2 value at

It's common knowledge. But since there is
ZERO knowledge about either play before
(a) the one record of Henry 8 (IF that was the
canonical play) when the Globe burnt down,
and (b) the Folio, they can be dated to more-
or-less whenever the 'scholars' wish. They
prefer to make them late, because they have
so much to squeeze in during the 'early years'

This is all very interesting, but I think Christopher Marlowe should
be granted some consideration as well. After all, he invented the
English blank verse drama.

By a curious coincidence, two important events took place on this day
(29th June) which are relevant to any Shakespeare discussion. In 48
B.C. Pompey the Great was defeated at Pharsalus, which ended the
democracy of the Roman Empire, since Pompey was the last to challenge
Caesar's autocracy. The tragedy was immotalized by Lucan, the
brilliant poet who was murdered by Nero. This work, &quot;Pharsalia&quot;, was
translated by Christopher Marlowe, who translated the brilliant
rhetorical style of Lucan into English, which must have influenced him
to set the English drama with the same brilliant rhetorical style,
admirably sustained through all the years by 'Shakespeare'. This is
one of the major arguments for Marlowe having survived as Shakespeare.

On the same day in 1613 the Globe burned down, marking the end of that
unique epoch. There was no more Shakespeare work produced after that,
as far as we know. There are theories that he carried on, but the
practical stage epoch was finished. What went on went on backstage.

Thought I just should mention it - no Shakespeare debate is possible
or just without remembering Marlowe.

I agree with you, Art, that Oxford and Derby must have been involved,
as well as Bacon, who, if Marlowe survived, (which there is at least
some 66% chance that he did) must have been Marlowe's chief protector
and helper. A number of the Shakespeare works undoubtedly had their
origin in Oxford's mind, and Derby was a close associate of Bacon's -
Marlowe probably found protection with him in Lancashire also. Only
Stratman is out except as a playbroker, theatre business man and
trademark.

It's more likely an argument that you should be taking a major

Marlowe influenced Shakespeare's writing, so Marlowe must be Shakespeare!

&gt;&gt; So, when I said &quot;What I have done, therefore, is

&gt;&gt; to express the total of these as a percentage of
&gt;&gt; the number of lines of verse&quot;, which bit didn't
&gt;&gt; you understand?

&gt;&gt; There is in fact a small error in doing this, in
&gt;&gt; that, although I do not have the data, there must
&gt;&gt; be quite a few cases where both an enjambment and
&gt;&gt; a feminine ending occur in the one line. It would
&gt;&gt; therefore have been better to take the average of
&gt;&gt; the two figures.

&gt; I'm afraid I don't see how averaging makes any sense.

"/>

No, on second thoughts, nor do I, What the charts
actually show (rather than a percentage, as I wrongly
labeled them) is the average incidence of feminine
endings and enjambments per 100 lines of verse in
each play. I'll get that corrected.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; This would have had the effect
&gt;&gt; of halving them, but as this would only change

&gt; Why didn't you run it as a multiple regression

Mainly because I prefer to keep things as simple as
possible. Multiple regression is of use where you are
interested in comparing the impact of the different
variables, which in this case I was not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Really? I have the relevant extract from Wells and

&gt;&gt; a quotation to support your claim from any of the
&gt;&gt; other scholars whose work I used, or is this to be
&gt;&gt; yet another of your unsupported assertions?

&gt;&gt; The fact is, of course, that although dating is
&gt;&gt; invariably done using whatever external evidence
&gt;&gt; exists, all sorts of internal evidence similar to
&gt;&gt; this is taken into consideration in determining
&gt;&gt; not the date, but the 'cluster' of plays with
&gt;&gt; which each of them is most likely to be associated.
&gt;&gt; But that isn't what you are claiming, is it?

&gt; I'm not sure it's possible to date the Shrew, 1HVI,
&gt; Timon or Coriolanus without relying primarily upon
&gt; internal evidence.

No, perhaps not, but I see no evidence of either
run-on lines or femininine endings (as opposed to
allusions and quotations, for example) having any
noticeable effect on the dates chosen.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Even so, if you were to arbitrarily set those

When someone gets around to reviewing and updating the attribution
case for Marlowe, I think we should discuss his style at the
structural and technical levels, because it is assumed that
Shakespeare and Marlowe collaborated on early plays. Major studies
demonstrate how Shakespeare went on to evolve blank verse for drama in
some ways, as I understand it.

Currently, the discussion about Oxford's style challenges use of
statistical methods of analyzing style on the basis of a priori or
begging the question logic that assumes Stratman was Shakespeare
before finding evidence, but I think Caroline Spurgeon differentiated
between Shakespeare and Marlowe by looking at what she calls images,
not just counts of rare words, feminine and end-stopped lines,
enjambment, spellings, punctuation, grammar, rhetoric, etc..

Paralleling what you reference, my source says seven men, including
Shakespeare, leased Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 for a period of 21
years, and that &quot;Blackfriars records are the last that show
Shakespeare as actor, sharer, and housekeeper in London. By 1612,
though he continued to prepare plays for his company, he had
apparently retired to Stratford, for, as we have seen, when he
testified for Stephen Belott in the Belott-Mountjoy suit in May,1612,
he identified himself as of Stratford-upon-Avon&quot; (in Bentley,
Shakespeare: a Biographical Handbook). bookburn

&gt;&gt; I've been meaning to find an excuse to learn Excel,

&gt; Thank you. I was wondering whether anyone would bother.

&gt;&gt; and now I'm guessing at which commands to use and
&gt;&gt; doing all kinds of things I hadn't intended to do.

&gt; Don't we all!

&gt;&gt; I may have to post something for you so I can make
&gt;&gt; sure I haven't accidentally missed or deleted something.
&gt;&gt; For now, I have the following questions:

&gt;&gt; 1. What is the measure (not labeled) at the bottom of
&gt;&gt; the column of ratios? r-squared of the column? (If
&gt;&gt; Pearson had known about spell-checkers, he would have
&gt;&gt; made all the variables upper-case. :-)

&gt; That figure's not really relevant, and shouldn't be
&gt; there. It appears to be a very rough indication of
&gt; the average (add 'em all up and divide by how many).
&gt; You shouldn't do that with percentages, really, and
&gt; the actual mean is nearer to .40, but it would be
&gt; the one the software would use in calculating the R^2
&gt; figure in the top right hand corner of the chart.

"/>

Gotcha.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; This value is a measure of the validity of the trend-
&gt; line and shows what proportion of the overall deviation
&gt; from the mean (i.e. from that 41%) is probably due to
&gt; the trend, rather than to random factors.

"/>

Okey-doke. Do you have a source for this use of this measure in this
context, or is it based on your practice in industry?

The hacker in me wants to redo the whole thing to improve your design,
but some people find this annoying, or impertinent. (This is as true
for other programmers who feel their every whim is Art with a capital
A and must therefore be immune from any critique, as it is for
non-technical types who just think in a different way.) It looks like
you're not using very many features of the program, only using it to
draw the charts.

So, you have: A list of plays, identified by title.
You have: A set of datings, identified for the most part by the name
of the author. These match plays with year-long, or in one case,
six-month long periods.
And, you have: A pre-calculated statistical ratio for each play.

So, your graph seems to show how reliably year can be predicted from
the ratio, or vice versa, for each dating.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; 2. Some of the worksheets have extra columns. They
&gt;&gt; are not all supposed to have extra columns, are they?
&gt;&gt; I'm worried I may have accidentally deleted them while
&gt;&gt; attempting to get everything onscreen at once.

&gt; No, that should be only on the one where I have super-
&gt; imposed the data for Marlowe's plays. I use a different
&gt; column so that they have a different symbol on the chart.

There are two, actually -- one for the second &quot;Taylor&quot; and one for
&quot;Turner Clark.&quot; I can see what the first of those is supposed to be,
but not the second.

I'm sure I heard in Shakespeare class that Shakespeare likely learned
from Marlowe, then collaborated in writing some of the Henry VI,
finally ventured on his own in CE, demonstrating mastery of plot
intricies. But what I discover on the Internet doesn't support that
very well, although Marlowe attribution sites seek to show continuity
of styles, and there are duplications of plots, e.g., Merchant of
Venice. I find only the following.

(quote)
Dido, Queen of Carthage, printed in 1594, was written in collaboration
with Thomas Nashe. It has been claimed that Marlowe had a hand in
several other extant plays, particularly in the two parts of The
Contention of York and Lancaster, which are versions of Shakespeare's
Second and Third Parts of Henry VI. (Charles Read, ed., Elizabethan
and Stuart Plays
1934.)
(unquote)

But the Encyclopaedia Britannica Macropaedia article on &quot;Shakespeare,&quot;
under Collaborative and attributed plays, first notes that
&quot;Elizabethan theatre encourage collaboration between authors and was
almost the rule in some companies,&quot; then concludes that, except for
collaborations with Fletcher, &quot;critical opinion has held that each
play in the Folio edition of 1623 is substantially Shakespeare's.&quot;

So, Neil Brennen, my pointing out that the battle of Pharsalus, - the
subject of Lucan's masterpiece (in which, quite correctly, John W,
only one song deals with the battle, that song, however, being the
climax of the composition,) which Marlowe translated the first song
of, which translation (together with his translations of Ovid)
provided him with intimate knowledge of the highly eloquent style of
Lucan (as of that of Ovid) which turned out the elementary backbone of
his art (as well as that of Shakespeare) - by an interesting
coincidence occurred on the same day that the major Shakespeare
theatre called the Globe burned down, an important day in
Shakespeariana, is reason enough for you to stamp me with a psychic
illness and confinement in padded cells. This reasoning is symptomatic
of Stratfordians, whose folly survives mainly by ridiculing and
belittling any argument beyond their Stratfordian prejudice. Bookburn
at least is readable, while you, Neil, are just a shame.

&gt;&gt; This is all very interesting, but I think Christopher Marlowe should
&gt;&gt; be granted some consideration as well. After all, he invented the
&gt;&gt; English blank verse drama.

&gt; WOW! Gee Christian, how old was Marlowe when he wrote Gorboduc? And doyou
&gt; ever think before posting, or do your delusions fall straight from what
&gt; passes for your brain onto your keyboard?

&gt;&gt; By a curious coincidence, two important events took place on this day
&gt;&gt; (29th June) which are relevant to any Shakespeare discussion. In 48
&gt;&gt; B.C. Pompey the Great was defeated at Pharsalus, which ended the
&gt;&gt; democracy of the Roman Empire, since Pompey was the last to challenge
&gt;&gt; Caesar's autocracy. The tragedy was immotalized by Lucan, the
&gt;&gt; brilliant poet who was murdered by Nero. This work, &quot;Pharsalia&quot;, was
&gt;&gt; translated by Christopher Marlowe, who translated the brilliant
&gt;&gt; rhetorical style of Lucan into English, which must have influenced him
&gt;&gt; to set the English drama with the same brilliant rhetorical style,
&gt;&gt; admirably sustained through all the years by 'Shakespeare'. This is
&gt;&gt; one of the major arguments for Marlowe having survived as Shakespeare.

&gt; It's more likely an argument that you should be taking a major
&gt; anti-psychotic. Let's see, Lucan wrote something which Marlowe translated;
&gt; Marlowe influenced Shakespeare's writing, so Marlowe must be Shakespeare!
&gt; That must pass for logic in the padded cell you inhabit.

&gt;&gt; On the same day in 1613 the Globe burned down, marking the end of that
&gt;&gt; unique epoch. There was no more Shakespeare work produced after that,
&gt;&gt; as far as we know. There are theories that he carried on, but the
&gt;&gt; practical stage epoch was finished. What went on went on backstage.

&gt; And you know this how?

&gt;&gt; Thought I just should mention it - no Shakespeare debate is possible
&gt;&gt; or just without remembering Marlowe.

&gt; I agree. Why should the Baconians and Oxfordians be the only ones laughed
&gt; at?

&gt;&gt; I agree with you, Art, that Oxford and Derby must have been involved,
&gt;&gt; as well as Bacon, who, if Marlowe survived, (which there is at least
&gt;&gt; some 66% chance that he did)

&gt; WOW! Chris has percentages now! Shame this is all delusion from his illness.

&gt; must have been Marlowe's chief protector
&gt;&gt; and helper. A number of the Shakespeare works undoubtedly had their
&gt;&gt; origin in Oxford's mind, and Derby was a close associate of Bacon's -
&gt;&gt; Marlowe probably found protection with him in Lancashire also.

&gt; Amazing. We should gather all the authorship kooks in a room and lock the
&gt; door.

&gt; Only
&gt;&gt; Stratman is out except as a playbroker, theatre business man and
&gt;&gt; trademark.

&gt;&gt; Cheers,

&gt;&gt; Chris

&gt;&gt;&gt; So, when I said &quot;What I have done, therefore, is

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is in fact a small error in doing this, in

&gt;&gt;&gt; the two figures.

&gt;&gt; I'm afraid I don't see how averaging makes any sense.

&gt; No, on second thoughts, nor do I, What the charts
&gt; actually show (rather than a percentage, as I wrongly
&gt; labeled them) is the average incidence of feminine
&gt; endings and enjambments per 100 lines of verse in
&gt; each play. I'll get that corrected.

"/>

You got your data out of Chambers and
your enjambment counts are taken from the
Overflow counts, right?

Assuming that is the case...

Chambers says that the overflow counts
for Shrew, Pericles, and HVIII are Boyle's
and that the rest are Konig's. He also
says that Boyle's counts aren't comparable
to Konig's. (Boyle had a tougher standard
for what counted as an overflow and he
included rhymed lines in his counts.)
My bet is that you can't do &quot;NA&quot; values
in Excel. If that is indeed the case,
then it seems to me that you might want
to consider dropping those plays from
your analysis.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; This would have had the effect
&gt;&gt;&gt; of halving them, but as this would only change

&gt;&gt; Why didn't you run it as a multiple regression

Ok. I was thinking that maybe it was oversimplified.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Really? I have the relevant extract from Wells and

&gt;&gt;&gt; and in neither case do these characteristics play
&gt;&gt;&gt; any part in the dating. Are you going to give us
&gt;&gt;&gt; a quotation to support your claim from any of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; other scholars whose work I used, or is this to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; yet another of your unsupported assertions?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The fact is, of course, that although dating is
&gt;&gt;&gt; invariably done using whatever external evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt; exists, all sorts of internal evidence similar to
&gt;&gt;&gt; this is taken into consideration in determining
&gt;&gt;&gt; not the date, but the 'cluster' of plays with
&gt;&gt;&gt; which each of them is most likely to be associated.
&gt;&gt;&gt; But that isn't what you are claiming, is it?

&gt;&gt; I'm not sure it's possible to date the Shrew, 1HVI,
&gt;&gt; Timon or Coriolanus without relying primarily upon
&gt;&gt; internal evidence.

&gt; No, perhaps not, but I see no evidence of either
&gt; run-on lines or femininine endings (as opposed to

&gt; noticeable effect on the dates chosen.

&gt;&gt; Even so, if you were to arbitrarily set those

&gt; Sorry, I don't really understand this.

Suppose we knew nothing about the author and had
were unable to use allusions &amp;etc. to date the

SHREW 1622 0.26
1HVI 1622 0.17

&lt;snip&gt;

Re Crowley's complaint:

Lots of statistics packages will do a thing called
stepwise regression, in which one starts out with
a large set of independent variables and the program
throws out all of the variables that don't work.
Frequently, the result is a good fit with only a
few variables. And sometimes, that good fit is
merely an artifact of the process. (If the set
of data points is small, and the set of possible
variables is large, I believe such a result is
almost guaranteed.)

My guess is that Paul thinks that the originators
of the data you relied upon, spent a great deal
of time doing something akin to a stepwise
regression. (I can't say that they didn't.)

I have read in a number of places that the
FE/chronological trend is seen in more Elizabethan
writers than Shakespeare which, if true, would confirm
that, at the very least, it is mathematically
reasonable to use FE in the regression.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm afraid I don't see how averaging makes any sense.

&gt;&gt; No, on second thoughts, nor do I, What the charts
&gt;&gt; actually show (rather than a percentage, as I wrongly
&gt;&gt; labeled them) is the average incidence of feminine
&gt;&gt; endings and enjambments per 100 lines of verse in
&gt;&gt; each play. I'll get that corrected.

&gt; You got your data out of Chambers and
&gt; your enjambment counts are taken from the
&gt; Overflow counts, right?

"/>

No, I got them from a table summarizing a whole lot of
verse test data in Methuen's &quot;Shakespeare Encyclopedia&quot;.
I assembled these figures well over ten years ago, and
long before I got a reader's ticket for the British
Library! The numbers of lines of verse are apparently
Fleay's, as corrected by Chambers. The run-on lines are
Koenig's, and the feminine endings Fleay's.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Assuming that is the case...

&gt; Chambers says that the overflow counts
&gt; for Shrew, Pericles, and HVIII are Boyle's
&gt; and that the rest are Konig's. He also

&gt; to Konig's. (Boyle had a tougher standard
&gt; for what counted as an overflow and he
&gt; included rhymed lines in his counts.)
&gt; My bet is that you can't do &quot;NA&quot; values

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Really? I have the relevant extract from Wells and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Taylor's *Textual Companion* here in front of me,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and in neither case do these characteristics play
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any part in the dating. Are you going to give us
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a quotation to support your claim from any of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other scholars whose work I used, or is this to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yet another of your unsupported assertions?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The fact is, of course, that although dating is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; invariably done using whatever external evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exists, all sorts of internal evidence similar to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this is taken into consideration in determining
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not the date, but the 'cluster' of plays with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which each of them is most likely to be associated.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But that isn't what you are claiming, is it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure it's possible to date the Shrew, 1HVI,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Timon or Coriolanus without relying primarily upon
&gt;&gt;&gt; internal evidence.

&gt;&gt; No, perhaps not, but I see no evidence of either
&gt;&gt; run-on lines or femininine endings (as opposed to
&gt;&gt; allusions and quotations, for example) having any
&gt;&gt; noticeable effect on the dates chosen.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Even so, if you were to arbitrarily set those
&gt;&gt;&gt; composition dates to 1622 and rerun your analysis,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am quite sure you'd still see statistically
&gt;&gt;&gt; significant results.

&gt;&gt; Sorry, I don't really understand this.

&gt; Suppose we knew nothing about the author and had
&gt; were unable to use allusions &amp;etc. to date the
&gt; play. I might stupidly decide that the plays
&gt; in question were probably written just before
&gt; the FF was printed and change the relevant
&gt; entries in my version of your table to:

&gt; SHREW 1622 0.26
&gt; 1HVI 1622 0.17
&gt; TIMON 1622 0.53
&gt; COR 1622 0.74

I'm sorry, I understood that bit (and assumed that
it would probably turn out to be the case), but not
the point you were making.

On this subject, though, it does show why it isn't
really necessary to strive for absolute accuracy in
the data. Just as the different ideas about the
dating (other than the Oxfordian one) make very
little difference to the overall validity, so a
notch or two either way on the RO/FEM data (eg the
figures you used vs mine) is unlikely to have any
significant effect either.

&gt; Re Crowley's complaint:

&gt; Lots of statistics packages will do a thing called
&gt; stepwise regression, in which one starts out with
&gt; a large set of independent variables and the program
&gt; throws out all of the variables that don't work.
&gt; Frequently, the result is a good fit with only a
&gt; few variables. And sometimes, that good fit is
&gt; merely an artifact of the process. (If the set
&gt; of data points is small, and the set of possible
&gt; variables is large, I believe such a result is
&gt; almost guaranteed.)

&gt; My guess is that Paul thinks that the originators
&gt; of the data you relied upon, spent a great deal
&gt; of time doing something akin to a stepwise
&gt; regression. (I can't say that they didn't.)

I can say for a fact that Taylor didn't, and have

everything I have seen leads me to believe that
external evidence (such as the gunpowder plot,
the Strachey letter and Foreman's diary) is the
primary method used in dating the plays, with
internal evidence, particularly where one play
seems to have influenced another, used mainly
for 'fine tuning'. Verse tests, if used at all,
have had a negligible effect on the choice - and
rightly so, in my opinion.

My claim is a simple one. It is that all of the

Whatever John W knows for sure, the &quot;Pharsalia&quot; as it exists clearly
stresses the Pharsalus battle as its main moralic thrust against war
and autocracy. We don't know what Lucan's further intentions were, if
at all there were any, but we do have a work as it is, a marvellous
argument against the fatal consequences of arbitrary government, the
like of which was also effected by James I, which led to the downfall
of the Stuarts, civil war and the definite end of democracy and
theatres in England, which the fire on June 29th of The Globe was very
much regarded as a portent of. My view is that coincidences are always
interesting and worth observing. If your view is the opposite, then I

A few years back when I was arguing with Pat Dooley,
I felt I needed a refresher in regression. I was
looking about for online resources and came across
quite a few negative comments about Excel's statistics
package. In short, professional statisticians were
telling everyone that Excel's programmers had written
algorithms that would have worked perfectly, if only
they were using infinite precision arithmetic.
(Reportedly, MS upgraded the regression routines in
2003.)

If you are interested in trying R, it's free

Suppose, for a moment, that the system was &quot;trained&quot;
using orthodox Shakespeare chronologies. Would it
be safe to turn that around and say that because
the system's predictions are very consistent with
orthodox chronologies, orthodox chronologies are
probably close to correct?

Konig and Fleay didn't have access to computers
and the work involved in picking out the data is
large. The idea that they could have looked at
a large set of possible predictors seems to me
to be very dubious, but I suppose someone like
Paul might think they just kept on looking until
they got lucky.

That's the context.

Now what can we make of the fact that a system
that was &quot;trained&quot; on Shakespeare works for other
contemporary authors?

It's certainly worth a look, even if Excel is probably
good enough for this relatively simple stuff. Thanks.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; My claim is a simple one. It is that all of the
&gt;&gt; trends based upon 'orthodox' datings have such a
&gt;&gt; high validity that it is almost impossible for
&gt;&gt; *some* of the plays not to have been written
&gt;&gt; after 1604, as they all claim. Maybe, despite
&gt;&gt; these figures, one or two of those seven plays
&gt;&gt; with the highest RO/FEM values could have been
&gt;&gt; written before Oxford's death, but not *all*
&gt;&gt; of them.

&gt; Right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have read in a number of places that the
&gt;&gt;&gt; FE/chronological trend is seen in more Elizabethan
&gt;&gt;&gt; writers than Shakespeare which, if true, would
&gt;&gt;&gt; confirm that, at the very least, it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; mathematically reasonable to use FE in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; regression.

&gt;&gt; Seems a bit non-sequiturial to me, but thanks anyway!

&gt; Suppose, for a moment, that the system was &quot;trained&quot;
&gt; using orthodox Shakespeare chronologies. Would it
&gt; be safe to turn that around and say that because
&gt; the system's predictions are very consistent with
&gt; orthodox chronologies, orthodox chronologies are
&gt; probably close to correct?

&gt; Konig and Fleay didn't have access to computers
&gt; and the work involved in picking out the data is
&gt; large. The idea that they could have looked at
&gt; a large set of possible predictors seems to me
&gt; to be very dubious, but I suppose someone like
&gt; Paul might think they just kept on looking until
&gt; they got lucky.

&gt; That's the context.

&gt; Now what can we make of the fact that a system
&gt; that was &quot;trained&quot; on Shakespeare works for other
&gt; contemporary authors?

"/>

Ah, now I get you! Yes, this is much the same argument
as I deployed against Paul, when he was complaining
that the trends based on function word usage that I
had found in the plays didn't really exist, being
(although he didn't use your words) simply the result
of my 'training the system'.

I asked him how he would explain, in that case, my
finding the same trend to a highly significant level
in the Sonnets.

another set of figures above the first

Actually, such trends are seen in ALL writers.
It's very easy to tell the age of any author from

have made it SO much easier today. It is very
easy to tell what kind of school you went to,
and to distinguish between graduates of
Harvard and Yale, or between Oxford and
Cambridge of a red-brick university. The CIA
has programs that enable them to find out

&gt; It's easiest for me to be less than an apologist for the Oxford
&gt; attribution case, considering the main points I find when searching
&gt; sites. That Oxford is not Shakespeare is mainly because:

&gt; 1) he died in 1604, before Shakespeare's late plays were in evidence;
&gt; 2) he had character flaws indicated by circumstances describing him as
&gt; a) a murderer, b) deadbeat dad, c) sexual adventurer and deviant, d)
&gt; irresponsible abdication of a military mission assigned by Elizabeth
&gt; during time of the Spanish Armada, e) irresponsible management of his
&gt; financial affairs, and f) importuning Elizabeth for favors;
&gt; 3) known facts about Shakespeare that mesh with Stratman but do not
&gt; mesh with Oxford;
&gt; 4) he had a mediocre reputation among writers of the time, who
&gt; typically omit him from consideration unless more than a few are
&gt; named;
&gt; 5) his style differs from that of Shakespeare in a) verse forms, b)
&gt; spellings, d) worst poetry is recognized as &quot;pretentious doggerel,&quot; e)
&gt; deficiency of language skills.

I'd almost stopped reading HLAS because so few posts were about the
authorship issue, which is the subject I'm most interested in
discussing. I'm a Shakespeare Fellowship member, so have been getting
to discuss it there in some detail, though without as many serious
retaliators as I once got here. Anyway, I wanted to chip in here
minorly mostly to let everyone know I'm still around and to applaud
the fact of this and a few other authorship-related threads I've
noticed but haven't read yet.

Fun list of BB's but I would go with 1 and 3, only, the latter being
overwhelming. I read the examples of Oxford's poetry and really can't
confidently state Shakespeare couldn't have written any of it.
Shakespeare wrote some stuff as bad as much of the wort of these
texts, and we probably have little poetry from Shakespeare's earliest
writing apprenticeship to compare with the Oxford poems. The number
of great artists of any kind whose earliest works are junk is quite
large, it seems to me. On the other hand, I'm open to a detailed
comparison of Oxford's poems to Shakespeare's with the intent of
determining if one man could have written both. I see no possible way
it could come close to proving that one man did not write both,
though.

I would agree that there are similarities, but I bet Jim KQK could
quote similar passages from at least a dozen poets of the time that
were as close to Oxford's poem as the Shakespeare stanza. The form of
each is absolutely standard for that time and a long time thereafter.
So is the logic.

| &gt; It's easiest for me to be less than an apologist for the Oxford
| &gt; attribution case, considering the main points I find when
searching
| &gt; sites. That Oxford is not Shakespeare is mainly because:
| &gt;
| &gt; 1) he died in 1604, before Shakespeare's late plays were in
evidence;
| &gt; 2) he had character flaws indicated by circumstances describing
him as
| &gt; a) a murderer, b) deadbeat dad, c) sexual adventurer and deviant,
d)
| &gt; irresponsible abdication of a military mission assigned by
Elizabeth
| &gt; during time of the Spanish Armada, e) irresponsible management of
his
| &gt; financial affairs, and f) importuning Elizabeth for favors;
| &gt; 3) known facts about Shakespeare that mesh with Stratman but do
not
| &gt; mesh with Oxford;
| &gt; 4) he had a mediocre reputation among writers of the time, who
| &gt; typically omit him from consideration unless more than a few are
| &gt; named;
| &gt; 5) his style differs from that of Shakespeare in a) verse forms,
b)
| &gt; spellings, d) worst poetry is recognized as &quot;pretentious
doggerel,&quot; e)
| &gt; deficiency of language skills.
| &gt;
|
| I'd almost stopped reading HLAS because so few posts were about the
| authorship issue, which is the subject I'm most interested in
| discussing. I'm a Shakespeare Fellowship member, so have been
getting
| to discuss it there in some detail, though without as many serious

| minorly mostly to let everyone know I'm still around and to applaud
| the fact of this and a few other authorship-related threads I've
| noticed but haven't read yet.
|
| Fun list of BB's but I would go with 1 and 3, only, the latter being
| overwhelming. I read the examples of Oxford's poetry and really
can't
| confidently state Shakespeare couldn't have written any of it.
| Shakespeare wrote some stuff as bad as much of the wort of these

I've taken shots at Shakespeare attributions lately, sort of hunting
grounds the public has passed over and finding some interesting
thickets with tracks here and there. A few birds get up, but I'm
shooting mostly blanks, I suppose, so they end up back under cover.
So the game goes on.

One point I favor, inadvertently left off in the above, is 5, c),
which should have been about imagery. This is the area that Spurgeon
developed in her monumental study, apparently referring to not only
images in the usual sense but including symbols, approaching
archetypal patterns. I think she compared Marlowe to Shakespeare,
rather than Oxford, Bacon, etc.. In the end she did try to draw
conclusions about what Shakespeare must have been like: that he was
well-formed and good looking, of medium height, agile, musically
inclined, with special capabilities in auditory memory and empathy for
people. But critics think she doesn't support that, I understand. bb

Sigh. Poking around on the Web, I found a chapter on the website of
Matthews's research group. The approach they take more or less makes
my skin crawl, and I suppose they'd say the same about any criticism I
might make from a computer science point of view.

It looks like they've reduced &quot;neural network&quot; to a simplified
&quot;interface&quot; (as in &quot;user interface&quot;) to &quot;real&quot; statistics. They
ignore computational issues so completely that from the very first
paragraph they make themselves (from a computer science point of view)
nearly laughable. (Although an alternative possibility is that my
knowledge is out of date and that in certain circles the terminology
they use is acceptable.) Of course, they'd say the mathematics is all
that matters.

I assume that the Netlab package is what he and Merriam used for their
Shakespeare analysis, as this is the only specific software that's
referenced at that site.

Peter's 'work' is simple -- AFAIR he
ASSUMES that they were written in the
order we have them. He then puts them
into groups, and does some number work
on them. But few 'scholars' (or non-
'scholars') accept that sequence.
Theoretically, it might be true, but (even
ignoring all the other serious problems)
there is no way he can regard his results
as any kind of 'confirmation.

My stuff is ground-breaking. I would
only expect exceptional people -- those
able to discard pre-conceptions, with a
capacity for independent thought, and
an ability to assess evidence objectively
-- to be able to consider it.

There are none such around here.

&gt;&gt; A caveat.

&gt;&gt; A few years back when I was arguing with Pat Dooley,
&gt;&gt; I felt I needed a refresher in regression. I was
&gt;&gt; looking about for online resources and came across
&gt;&gt; quite a few negative comments about Excel's statistics
&gt;&gt; package. In short, professional statisticians were
&gt;&gt; telling everyone that Excel's programmers had written
&gt;&gt; algorithms that would have worked perfectly, if only
&gt;&gt; they were using infinite precision arithmetic.
&gt;&gt; (Reportedly, MS upgraded the regression routines in
&gt;&gt; 2003.)

&gt; The problems around here come (as
&gt; nearly always) come from the inability
&gt; to grasp basic mathematical concepts.
&gt; They do not arise from lost 'accuracy'.

"/>

I am going to say something kind of snippy. It seems to me that
mathematicians work by assimilating new discoveries, to the absolute
greatest extent possible (including discoveries in the sciences), to
results that are already known. Whereas computer science works by
stressing the benefits of using some new methodology to do the same
old thing. This may be a UK/US distinction, which I naturally
misread, or it might be an intra-UK Oxbridge/Redbrick distinction, or
I don't know what. But it's darn annoying.

Oops. Is that how one categorizes poetry?

And oops again, Shakespeare only uses two words that are more than two
syllables--&quot;invisible&quot; and its rhyming word. My guess anyway is that the

may have been written much earlier than that. V and A was published seven

The point is that most of Oxford's known poetry is congruent with the style
of poetry of the mid century, which suggests it was written when he was very
young. He was, after all, only born in the mid century himself.
Shakespeare's known narrative poetry is later. And his plays later still,
when styles had changed quite dramatically.

Show me another poem with the same cliches and logic and stanza form. I'm

show me something that approximates &quot;Were I a King&quot; the way the speech from
Richard II, 3, ii does. I put it up last week. It looks almost as if the
earlier poem is a precis of the later speech. Or that the later speech is an
embroidering of the themes in the earlier poem, which makes more sense in
terms of maturity and time frame.

Grumble Bunny,

I love it when you say that we know *for a fact* that the theme *had to have
been used.* You can only know *for a fact* that the theme *was* used, in
which case you should have no problem giving examples.

Besides, I can't believe that I ever said that Oxford invented the theme.
Only that it appears again very similarly, even to the words used, in
Richard II. It's possible that there are other very similar pieces from the
time which weren't either Oxford or Shakespeare (and of course discounting
Sidney), but as yet I haven't found them. Have you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So much for the critical abilities of an award-winning

&gt;&gt;&gt; You need to take a course in poetry, Tom.

&gt;&gt; I'm sure that's where award-winning poets think poetry is
&gt;&gt; learned.

&gt; No, that's where it's taught, or at least where I taught it.
&gt; Whether you want to learn anything is entirely up to you.

&gt;&gt; The stanza structure is identical. The rhythm and meter
&gt;&gt; are similar, although I'd say there are slight variations
&gt;&gt; in lines 2 and 4.

&gt;&gt; Take a look at Oxford's verse. Can you see how primitive
&gt;&gt; and plodding his use of iambic pentameter is? Count the
&gt;&gt; number of one-syllable words he uses. Then count the number
&gt;&gt; of two-syllable words he uses. Then count the number of
&gt;&gt; three-syllable words he uses. Whoops! He doesn't use any
&gt;&gt; three-syllable words!

&gt; Oops. Is that how one categorizes poetry?

&gt; And oops again, Shakespeare only uses two words that are
&gt; more than two syllables--&quot;invisible&quot; and its rhyming word.
&gt; My guess anyway is that the first poem is much earlier.
&gt; We know it can't come any later than 1586, but may have
&gt; been written much earlier than that. V and A was published
&gt; seven years after the latest possible date for &quot;King.&quot;

"/>

I have just been reading the latest biography of Marlowe,
by David Riggs, and he has some interesting things to say
about the question of multi-syllable words in iambic
pentameter. He reports Gascoigne (the discoverer of the
iambic pentameter, according to Riggs) as recommending
that vernacular poets should 'avoid words of many syllables'.
Riggs goes on to claim that Marlowe met this challenge
head-on by the use of what Riggs calls the 'mismatch' and
&quot;instead of avoiding polysyllabic words, he incorporates
them into the architecture of his verse.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; I would also add that many of the verses in V
&gt;&gt;&gt; and A have very little enjambment, if any at all.

"/>

*Venus and Adonis* has less enjambment than any other work
of Shakespeare's. Only 7.25% of the lines, compared with
12.8% for *The Rape of Lucrece*. As we know, this was a
characteristic which increased in his verse over the years,
reaching over 40% in *Anthony &amp; Cleopatra* and *The Tempest*,
and over 45% in *Coriolanus* and *Cymbeline*.

As far as Marlowe is concerned, *Hero and Leander* was at
10.55%, but his range was quite surprising, going from
3.23% for his Ovid translation to an extraordinary 24.46%
for his translation of Lucan - a level that Shakespeare
wouldn't reach (again?) until about 1602, with *Troilus
and Cressida*, at 26.97%.

Well I merely report what he says in the book, but I
suspect that he means that Gasgoigne was the first to
*describe* what constituted an iambic pentameter,
with its use of stress rather than the syllable length of
the classical poets, don't you?

However, each of the lines in the Oxford poem stands alone. The
odd-numbered lines in the Shakespeare poem need the succeeding
even-numbered lines to complete them. This changes the stanza
structure slightly, to my ear, almost enough to suggest that if the
even-numbered lines were to be excised, _then_ the stanza structure
would be close to the same (though, of course, in that case, the rhyme
scheme would change).

I cannot make head nor tail of this, for I cannot imagine any distinction

I don't recall any such questions from you,
but I have written here on the 'dating' -- at
length -- in other threads. The 'scholars'
simply took the &quot;first record&quot;, subtracted a
few months, and Bob's yer uncle. Of course,
they often had to dismiss records that were
'too early', so we have rakes of 'Ur-Hamlets',
and 'Ur-Lears', and 'Ur-Taming of the Shrews',
etc. -- written by some other unknown
authors. And sometimes the 'first records'
came in a bundle -- like the eight in Meres's
list. They had to spread these out a bit,
dating one or two up to 3-4 years before
Meres printed his list. (They assume
omniscience on his part, of course.)

&gt;&gt; solid commercial and critical success already
&gt;&gt; behind him. Yet we hear nothing -- absolutely

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My claim is a simple one. It is that all of the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *some* of the plays not to have been written
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after 1604, as they all claim.

&gt;&gt; Total and utter rubbish. You are fooling
&gt;&gt; yourself with figures yet again. IF this theory
&gt;&gt; of yours had any validity, how is it that the
&gt;&gt; Stratfordians haven't argued it up to now?

&gt; Two main reasons, I think. First, Shakespearean
&gt; scholars do not spend their time even looking at,
&gt; let alone trying to refute anti-Stratfordian

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Second,
&gt; and following on from the first, because these

The dating of the works (including the
sonnets) is a massive topic in its own right
within Stratfordianism. Most 'scholars'
don't even think of it as having anything
to do with the authorship question. IF your

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Perhaps you might say that their ability at

&gt;&gt; . . true for most, but certainly not all. Some

&gt;&gt; Shakespeareans. B.F. Skinner is one name
&gt;&gt; I have come across recently, but I'm sure
&gt;&gt; that there have been many more.

&gt; B.F. Skinner! What in your fevered imagination
&gt; do you conceive as a possible reason for one of
&gt; the world's most influential behavioral psychol-
&gt; ogists to have spend his valuable time refuting
&gt; Oxfordianism?

"/>

He was concerned about the dating of the
works, as much as any. I came across a
reference to him in Rollins. This is the
quote (Vol I, page 300) which indicates
that he was keen to apply mathematical
techniques:

T. R. PRICE (Studies in Honor of. . . Gildersleeve, 1902, pp. 368 f.) remarks that
Sh. prefers alliteration in 'S' (134 times) or a vowel (118 times), that in 'L' (61 times)
coming next. Alliteration &quot;rises to its highest use in sonnets 141-50 and sinks to
its lowest in sonnets 41-50.&quot; Ten are free from alliteration, seven (30, 85, 116,
129, 135, 146, 148) &quot;rise above the rest in what may almost seem excess of
alliterative art.&quot; I have not verified these statistics, but reference may be made to
B. F. SKINNER's &quot;Alliteration in Sh.'s Sonnets: A Study in Literary Behavior&quot;
(Psychological Record, 1939, III, 186-192). After elaborate mathematical
calculations he decides (pp. 191 f.): &quot;In spite of the seeming richness of alliteration
in the sonnets, there is no significant evidence of a process of alliteration in the
behavior of the poet to which any serious attention should be given. So far as this
aspect of poetry is concerned, Shakespeare might as well have drawn his words
out of a hat. . . . If 'formal strengthening' proves to be a real characteristic of normal
speech, we shall have to look for the key to Shakespeare's genius in his ability to
resist it, thereby reversing the usual conception of this kind of poetic activity.&quot;
Skinner has further pronouncements of this sort in the American Journal of
Psychology, 1941 (LIV, 70-79). E. E. STOLL (M. L. N., 1940, LV, 388-390) attacks
Skinner's method and conclusions. He writes (p. 390): &quot;The alliterative practice of
a great poet, though appropriate and artistic, not accidental as Mr. Skinner thinks,
is, by the time he reaches mastery, a second nature to him-incidental, one might
say . . . &quot;

You will notice how Skinner was thinking
along your lines. (Further proof that great
minds think alike.) Shakespeare's use of
alliteration should reveal 'trends'. I'm
surprised that you've ignored this factor.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; They weren't under his conscious control.
&gt;&gt; He wrote in a dream-like state, so he no more
&gt;&gt; understood what he was writing, nor had
&gt;&gt; any control over it, than he was counting
&gt;&gt; his breaths or the number of times he blinked
&gt;&gt; his eyes.

&gt; I am not interested in the extent to which he was
&gt; aware of this change occurring.

"/>

Sure -- it's entirely irrelevant. Skinner would
say that same. In reality, there is no such
thing as 'conscious behaviour' -- everything
we do is governed by simple rules -- forms
of stimulus and response. We are really not
much more than billiard balls. That's the
great lesson from Stratfordianism (and
from quasi-Strats like yourself).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I merely point out
&gt; that based upon these figures it almost certainly
&gt; did.

"/>

Peter -- even if your mathematical ability
is minimal -- a good clue to the fact that
you are fooling yourself with figures is
when the results they produce are arrant
nonsense. Another good clue, btw, is
when the 'results' you get are terrific --
i.e. when you get an r^2 which approaches
0.8 or is even better. If you get such
figures, you KNOW that you are an idiot.

Now, tell us of ANY other literary figure
or artist (in any form) whose works show
simple mathematical trends over their
careers. Just ONE will do. Perhaps a
painter who steadily used more and more
blue paint, and, say, whose pictures got
bigger and bigger. So you could put
them in a graph showing the 'blueness'
added to the 'bigness' proving the 'trend'
beyond all shadow of doubt.

Or perhaps a composer, who steadily
moved up the scale, and put, say, more
and more brass into his works. So you
could add the height on the scale to the
amount of brass and prove the 'trend'
beyond all shadow of doubt.

There's a whole new science out there,
waiting for you -- the application of
elementary statistics to aesthetics.

Think of it. You can be the founding
genius. In the next century, if not before,
there will be universities named after you:

&gt;&gt; It's easiest for me to be less than an apologist for the Oxford

&gt;&gt; sites. That Oxford is not Shakespeare is mainly because:

&gt;&gt; 1) he died in 1604, before Shakespeare's late plays were in evidence;
&gt;&gt; 2) he had character flaws indicated by circumstances describing him as
&gt;&gt; a) a murderer, b) deadbeat dad, c) sexual adventurer and deviant, d)
&gt;&gt; irresponsible abdication of a military mission assigned by Elizabeth
&gt;&gt; during time of the Spanish Armada, e) irresponsible management of his
&gt;&gt; financial affairs, and f) importuning Elizabeth for favors;
&gt;&gt; 3) known facts about Shakespeare that mesh with Stratman but do not
&gt;&gt; mesh with Oxford;
&gt;&gt; 4) he had a mediocre reputation among writers of the time, who
&gt;&gt; typically omit him from consideration unless more than a few are
&gt;&gt; named;
&gt;&gt; 5) his style differs from that of Shakespeare in a) verse forms, b)

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's easiest for me to be less than an apologist for the Oxford
&gt;&gt;&gt; attribution case, considering the main points I find when searching
&gt;&gt;&gt; sites. That Oxford is not Shakespeare is mainly because:

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) he died in 1604, before Shakespeare's late plays were in evidence;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) he had character flaws indicated by circumstances describing him as
&gt;&gt;&gt; a) a murderer, b) deadbeat dad, c) sexual adventurer and deviant, d)
&gt;&gt;&gt; irresponsible abdication of a military mission assigned by Elizabeth
&gt;&gt;&gt; during time of the Spanish Armada, e) irresponsible management of his
&gt;&gt;&gt; financial affairs, and f) importuning Elizabeth for favors;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) known facts about Shakespeare that mesh with Stratman but do not
&gt;&gt;&gt; mesh with Oxford;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4) he had a mediocre reputation among writers of the time, who
&gt;&gt;&gt; typically omit him from consideration unless more than a few are
&gt;&gt;&gt; named;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5) his style differs from that of Shakespeare in a) verse forms, b)
&gt;&gt;&gt; spellings, d) worst poetry is recognized as &quot;pretentious doggerel,&quot; e)
&gt;&gt;&gt; deficiency of language skills.

Yes, really awkward, just like the rather heavy hint of masturbation in the
sonnets. And displaying the same kind of attitude towards women as in many
of the sonnets.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I would be pleased to to have written a poem as competent as &quot;Women&quot; when I
was young. My guess is that the author of the poem, if Oxford, was pretty
young too, as the style is somewhat euphuistic. Euphuism, as you know, later
went out of style.

Best wishes,
Lynne

Yes, it's not good, but I wanted to distinguish between the best and worst
of Oxford. His best is piss-poor by Shakespearean standards, but passable by
general Elizabethan standards. And this is one of his best. It's outstanding
in Oxford's output for having at least a striking metaphor that is pursued
to the end. The idea of women as hawks or falcons is at least an &quot;image&quot;
that commands attention. He doesn't do a lot with it, and his misogyny is
obviously something of an embarrassment, but you can at least say that he
had an idea and succeeded in pursuing it with some semblance of consistency.
What it has in common with all his other poems is its lack of development.
It's one thing, then another thing, then a third thing, and so on. There is
nothing like the progression that we would expect from Shakespeare, no
emotional transformation, no metamorphosing of images, no sudden word-play,
no reversals of meaning, no paradoxes. Surface meaning is all there is.

It's dull, but it isn't bad.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To mark the choice they make, and how they change,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How oft from Phacbus do they flee to Pan,

&gt;&gt; That's &quot;Phoebus&quot;, I rather fancy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Unsettled still like haggards wild they range,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These gentle birds that fly from man to man;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Who would not scorn and shake them from the fist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And let them fly fair fools which way they list.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yet for disport we fawn and flatter both,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To pass the time when nothing else can please,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And train them to our lure with subtle oath,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Till, weary of their wiles, ourselves we ease;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And then we say when we their fancy try,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To play with fools, O what a fool was I.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And did you get a signed statement from Auden to the effect that he
&gt; thought
&gt;&gt;&gt; this poem was anything better than passable verse? Were there any
other
&gt;&gt;&gt; witnesses present who can confirm it? Without that, I would have some
&gt;&gt;&gt; difficulty believing it.

&gt;&gt; I shouldn't even call it passable, what with the forced and ambiguous
&gt;&gt; inversions of &quot;service long&quot; and &quot;fawn and flatter both&quot;, the rather
&gt;&gt; uncertain use of &quot;bond&quot;, Oxford's customarily (or should that be
&gt;&gt;&quot;comfortably&quot;?) heavy-handed alliteration,

&gt; So I take it that you are agreeing with RNP that Oxford wrote this poem?

&gt;&gt;and the awkward hint of bawdy
&gt;&gt; in &quot;ourselves we ease&quot;.

&gt; Yes, really awkward, just like the rather heavy hint of masturbation in
the
&gt; sonnets.

"/>

No, not like the sonnets. In those the heavy hint of masturbation serves the
purpose of supporting the theme - the begetting, the procreating, and the
not-procreating, the killing of notional offspring with the wasting of
semen. In sonnet 7, as we both agree, we are witnessing the rise and fall of
a giant erection - &quot;Lo! in the orient when the gracious light lifts up his
burning head&quot;. This is not gratuitous, it's a metaphor that carries all the
implications that the surface reading of the sonnet also has - the rise and
fall of virility, the wilting of the powers with the passage of time, the
droop towards sunset. Thus, far from being distractions or diversions,
these puns and metaphors are little eddies that emphasise and reinforce the
main current. Shakespeare's poetry doesn't carry passengers; everything
pulls its weight.

So, no - not at all like the sonnets. John Kennedy sees a hint of bawdy in
&quot;ourselves we ease&quot;. In which case he's bound to call it &quot;awkward&quot;, and
could with justice call it fatuous. To find out how much such a bit of bawdy
would actually be worth, we'd need to decide exactly what having a crap has
to do with consorting with women, or hunting with peregrines. How does this
pun fit into the theme of the poem? And, of course, the answer is that its
contribution to the poem is nil. But his seeing it in the first place means
John is not giving Oxford the benefit of the doubt. But I will, because I am
kinder. I'll say no bawdy was intended by Oxford, which allows me to call
the phrase and the idea merely dull, rather than incompetent and juvenile.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in &quot;ourselves we ease&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, it's not good, but I wanted to distinguish between the best and
&gt; worst
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Oxford. His best is piss-poor by Shakespearean standards, but
&gt; passable
&gt;&gt; by
&gt;&gt;&gt; general Elizabethan standards. And this is one of his best. It's
&gt;&gt; outstanding
&gt;&gt;&gt; in Oxford's output for having at least a striking metaphor that is
&gt; pursued
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the end. The idea of women as hawks or falcons is at least an
&quot;image&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; that commands attention. He doesn't do a lot with it, and his misogyny
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; obviously something of an embarrassment, but you can at least say that
&gt; he
&gt;&gt;&gt; had an idea and succeeded in pursuing it with some semblance of
&gt;&gt; consistency.
&gt;&gt;&gt; What it has in common with all his other poems is its lack of
&gt; development.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's one thing, then another thing, then a third thing, and so on.
There
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing like the progression that we would expect from Shakespeare, no
&gt;&gt;&gt; emotional transformation, no metamorphosing of images, no sudden
&gt;&gt; word-play,
&gt;&gt;&gt; no reversals of meaning, no paradoxes. Surface meaning is all there
is.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's dull, but it isn't bad.

&gt;&gt; So Buff, you too are agreeing that this poem is by Oxford?

&gt; I'm assuming it's his. But if it turns out that it isn't, that's not good
&gt; for Oxford. This is one of the better offerings in his meagre collection.

"/>

I do believe it's by Oxford also, although I can't prove it, as there's at
least one copy with his initials attached, and it is a fine poem of the
time. I also venture to say that if it were said to be by Shakespeare, most
would be fawning all over it. There is, of course, word play, as you've
flitted over in another post by talking about &quot;ourselves we ease,&quot; which has
at least two meanings, both of which fit the tenor of the poem. There is
also the lovely extended metaphor of the haggards. The misogyny, which has
been noted above, is very typical of Shakespeare in the early sonnets. As
I've suggested before, in some of the sonnets women are merely receptacles.
Here we have the poet talking to other men with women as objects. In the
marriage sonnets and after we have the poet talking to a man with women as
objects. I'm not an expert on Elizabethan verse, but I'd venture to say that
there's not too much of this kind of attitude displayed at the time. Perhaps
someone such as Terry, who is an expert, could inform us.

And Shakespeare has written some God-awful stuff, some far worse than this.
It's only because of the name attached to it that no one here dare criticise
it. Sonnets 153 and 154, for example, are so mediocre that some scholars
have long tried to separate them from the rest of the cycle.

We will have to agree to disagree.

Best wishes,
Lynne

I'm no fan of Auden (or, even, most of the time, RNP) but I like the above. It
gets pretty colorful in the middle, and is mostly technically
proficient--though, like some of Shakespeare's stuff--the need to keep to the
metrical and rhyme schemes results in forcings. Conventional subject matter,
but what poet wasn't dealing with what we'd call conventional subject matter at
that time? I'd give it high marks in melodiousness.

I think the alliterations not forced, though close--I mean, every line has them;
but I didn't find any words stuffed in for alliterativeness. And I thought the

&gt; I love it when you say that we know *for a fact* that the theme *had to have

&gt; which case you should have no problem giving examples.

"/>

Actually, LynnE, someone capable of meta-empiricism--or using one's
intelligence--can KNOW FOR A FACT certain things without having ANY
empirical evidence for them. For example, I can tell you that human
beings reached the Isle of Man by the year 10 AD or sooner even though
I have no empirical evidences of it, at all. How? I know that men
were sailing for thousands of years before that, and that the Romans
had gotten to Britain by then. In boats. I know approximately where
the Isle of Man is. I know the human psyche. An exploratory urge is
part of it. Etc. Ergo, I know enough to know that it has to be
near-certain that human beings got to the Isle of Man by 10 AD.

Similarly, I know poetry has been written for thousands of years, and
that certain human beings have imaginations. I know that &quot;what if's&quot;
crop up in human minds. I know that people dream of having better
lives. I know that children play at being kings and queens. I know
that people have written about the differences between kings and
commoners for millennia. I know how poets' minds work. Ergo, I know
without a need for the empirical proof that Jim provided that poets
compared kings and peasants long before Oxford did.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Besides, I can't believe that I ever said that Oxford invented the theme.

So what? The point is that his use of a very common theme that
Shakespeare also made use of is irrelevant so far as the authorship
question is concerned.

Yep, that's all it means. A phrase to fill up the line when he couldn't
think of anything else, but needed something to rhyme with &quot;please&quot;. It
would be more appropriately used in a context where doing what he was doing
before he took his ease was something that suggested effort. But two lines
before he tells us that disporting with women/hawks is something done &quot;to
pass the time when nothing else can please&quot;. And since passing the time is
another way of taking your ease, it sounds like he was taking his ease from
taking his ease. It's a good example of Oxford's biggest problem as a poet:
he keeps forgetting what he's just written.

Buffalo, my dear, as Fagin would say:

It took another poet (Bob) to see how good &quot;Women&quot; is. There is something
you have forgotten also. This poem, like &quot;My Mind to Me a Kingdom is&quot; is
most likely song lyrics, which puts it in a slightly different class.

Again, if this poem were pinned on Shakespeare, my guess is that few would
have problems with it. Although it comes earlier and displays the
alliterative poetic style that had gone out of fashion by the time the
sonnets were written, it is, imo, as good as some of the lesser sonnets.
That's why I was so surprised that at least two of you were happy to give it
to Oxford. Most anti-Oxfordians fight that attribution to the death.

My guess is that whoever wrote this poem, whether Oxford or someone else (my
money, of course, is on Oxford), was a young Shakespeare. It has his ease of
style, his assurance, his use of metaphor and bawdy, his dislike of women
(as exhibited in the sonnets).

Can you tell I'm biased? This is one of my favourite poems. It's part of my
rogues' gallery on my wall. Although, dammit, why couldn't the poet like
women?

Best wishes,
Lynne

I can't conceive that Shakespeare would have written it unless he meant to
parody an outmoded style of verse (and if that had been his intention, I
think he would have exaggerated the most dated elements).

Shakespeare left us nothing in this form: the 18-line poem in three IP
sexains that rhyme ababcc. It might be useful to call this form the
&quot;Watson sonnet,&quot; after Thomas Watson, whose *Hekatompathia* comprised 100
such poems (and which, by the way, was dedicated to Oxford). Oxford's
&quot;Feyne would I singe but fury makes me frette&quot; is in the same form, but
there are a great many such poems by other writers of the time. I think
the form as well as the extent of both the alliteration and the inversions
would have seemed old-fashioned for Shakespeare's generation; but this
would have been a reasonably good poem in the 1570s.

Here is a poem (not by Oxford) from the 1576 *Paradise of Dainty Devices*
(I have modernized the spelling):

No pleasure, without some pain

Sweet were the joys, that both might like and last,
Strange were the state, exempt from all distress:
Happy the life, that no mishap should taste,
Blessed the chance, might never change success.
Were such a life to lead, or state to prove,
Who would not wish, that such a life were love.

But O the soury sauce of sweet unsure,
When pleasures fly, and flit with waste of wind:
The trustless trains that hoping hearts allure,
When sweet delights do but allure the mind.
When care consumes and wastes the wretched wight,
While fancy feeds, and draws off her delight.

What life were love, if love were free from pain?
But O that pain, with pleasure matched should meet:
Why did the course of nature so ordain,
That sugared sour, must sauce the bitter sweet.
Which sour from sweet, might any means remove,
What hap, what heaven, what life, were like to love.

I think a poem such as this may be a more useful comparison for &quot;If women
could be fair and yet not fond&quot; than anything by Shakespeare would be.

Just taking a break from editing. That would be the Rearl of Woxford.

Terry, I need to ask you a question because although I talked to Stephen a
few weeks ago about the poem, I forgot to ask him the following and I don't
have his book: &quot;Women&quot; appears in William Byrd's _Psalms, Sonnets, and Songs
of Sadness and Piety_ (Ha, that's a laugh) of 1588. So that is its latest
possible date of composition, as I understand it. I have no idea if the ms
copies are dated. Do you know if Oxford's name is attached to the poem in
the Byrd?

&gt; Here is a poem (not by Oxford) from the 1576 *Paradise of Dainty Devices*
&gt; (I have modernized the spelling):

&gt; No pleasure, without some pain

&gt; Sweet were the joys, that both might like and last,
&gt; Strange were the state, exempt from all distress:
&gt; Happy the life, that no mishap should taste,
&gt; Blessed the chance, might never change success.
&gt; Were such a life to lead, or state to prove,
&gt; Who would not wish, that such a life were love.

&gt; But O the soury sauce of sweet unsure,
&gt; When pleasures fly, and flit with waste of wind:
&gt; The trustless trains that hoping hearts allure,
&gt; When sweet delights do but allure the mind.
&gt; When care consumes and wastes the wretched wight,
&gt; While fancy feeds, and draws off her delight.

&gt; What life were love, if love were free from pain?
&gt; But O that pain, with pleasure matched should meet:
&gt; Why did the course of nature so ordain,
&gt; That sugared sour, must sauce the bitter sweet.
&gt; Which sour from sweet, might any means remove,
&gt; What hap, what heaven, what life, were like to love.

&gt; I think a poem such as this may be a more useful comparison for &quot;If women
&gt; could be fair and yet not fond&quot; than anything by Shakespeare would be.

"/>

I disagree. I think it's a better comparison, perhaps, for when the author
of &quot;Women&quot; may have written his poem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Bookburn&quot;:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's easiest for me to be less than an apologist for the Oxford
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attribution case, considering the main points I find when searching
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sites. That Oxford is not Shakespeare is mainly because:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) he died in 1604, before Shakespeare's late plays were in
evidence;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) he had character flaws indicated by circumstances describing him
as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a) a murderer, b) deadbeat dad, c) sexual adventurer and deviant, d)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; irresponsible abdication of a military mission assigned by Elizabeth
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; during time of the Spanish Armada, e) irresponsible management of
his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; financial affairs, and f) importuning Elizabeth for favors;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) known facts about Shakespeare that mesh with Stratman but do not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mesh with Oxford;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4) he had a mediocre reputation among writers of the time, who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; typically omit him from consideration unless more than a few are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; named;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5) his style differs from that of Shakespeare in a) verse forms, b)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spellings, d) worst poetry is recognized as &quot;pretentious doggerel,&quot;
e)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deficiency of language skills.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd almost stopped reading HLAS because so few posts were about the
&gt;&gt;&gt; authorship issue, which is the subject I'm most interested in
&gt;&gt;&gt; discussing. I'm a Shakespeare Fellowship member, so have been getting
&gt;&gt;&gt; to discuss it there in some detail, though without as many serious
&gt;&gt;&gt; retaliators as I once got here. Anyway, I wanted to chip in here
&gt;&gt;&gt; minorly mostly to let everyone know I'm still around and to applaud
&gt;&gt;&gt; the fact of this and a few other authorship-related threads I've
&gt;&gt;&gt; noticed but haven't read yet.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fun list of BB's but I would go with 1 and 3, only, the latter being
&gt;&gt;&gt; overwhelming. I read the examples of Oxford's poetry and really can't
&gt;&gt;&gt; confidently state Shakespeare couldn't have written any of it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare wrote some stuff as bad as much of the wort of these
&gt;&gt;&gt; texts, and we probably have little poetry from Shakespeare's earliest
&gt;&gt;&gt; writing apprenticeship to compare with the Oxford poems. The number
&gt;&gt;&gt; of great artists of any kind whose earliest works are junk is quite
&gt;&gt;&gt; large, it seems to me. On the other hand, I'm open to a detailed
&gt;&gt;&gt; comparison of Oxford's poems to Shakespeare's with the intent of
&gt;&gt;&gt; determining if one man could have written both. I see no possible way
&gt;&gt;&gt; it could come close to proving that one man did not write both,
&gt;&gt;&gt; though.

&gt;&gt;&gt; --Bob G.

&gt;&gt; I quite like this one and so do a number of good poets(like Auden)
&gt;&gt; to whom I read it blind.The first section is by far the strongest. The
&gt;&gt; question is(I think yes but won't argue it here today) did Oxford
&gt;&gt; write it?
&gt;&gt; Woman's Changeableness.

&gt;&gt; If women could be fair and yet not fond,
&gt;&gt; Or that their love were firm not fickle, still,
&gt;&gt; I would not marvel that they make men bond,
&gt;&gt; By service long to purchase their good will;
&gt;&gt; But when I see how frail those creatures are,
&gt;&gt; I muse that men forget themselves so far.

&gt;&gt; To mark the choice they make, and how they change,
&gt;&gt; How oft from Phacbus do they flee to Pan,
&gt;&gt; Unsettled still like haggards wild they range,
&gt;&gt; These gentle birds that fly from man to man;
&gt;&gt; Who would not scorn and shake them from the fist
&gt;&gt; And let them fly fair fools which way they list.

&gt;&gt; Yet for disport we fawn and flatter both,
&gt;&gt; To pass the time when nothing else can please,
&gt;&gt; And train them to our lure with subtle oath,
&gt;&gt; Till, weary of their wiles, ourselves we ease;
&gt;&gt; And then we say when we their fancy try,
&gt;&gt; To play with fools, O what a fool was I.

&gt;&gt; RNP

&gt; I think Bob needs to take another look at Shakespeare's verse.
&gt; The above poem is not much more than doggerel. Shakespeare
&gt; is guilty of a few lapses in taste, mostly in Lucrece, but
&gt; his verse is never this repetitive or simple. The hallmarks
&gt; of Shakespeare's verse are the mellifluous phrasing achieved
&gt; *without* excess alliteration, the intricate manner in
&gt; which most words are connected in some way to others, and
&gt; interesting word choice. Compare for example the second stanza
&gt; above with this stanza from V&amp;A:

&gt; ===
&gt; Once more the ruby-coloured portal opened,
&gt; Which to his speech did honey passage yield;
&gt; Like a red morn, that ever yet betokened
&gt; Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,
&gt; Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
&gt; Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.
&gt; This ill presage advisedly she marketh.
&gt; ===

&gt; There were few, if any, poets then who would attempt a line
&gt; as non-regular as the last one, and note how Shakespeare
&gt; uses alliteration. He uses &quot;f&quot; as does the author
&gt; of the above poem, but only twice; the other alliteration
&gt; is on &quot;h&quot; and he contrasts the soft sounds of the &quot;f&quot; with the
&gt; hard &quot;g&quot; of gusts, while the author of the above poem
&gt; uses far too many &quot;f&quot;'s (&quot;fist&quot;, &quot;fly fair fools&quot;).
&gt; Note the many words longer than 2 syllables in the
&gt; Shakespeare passage, the second stanza above has one (&quot;unsettled&quot;).

&gt; I don't mean to imply that Shakespeare never uses
&gt; too much alliteration in some of his passages, for
&gt; example, this line by itself in V&amp;A is not great, imo:

&gt;&quot;Rain added to a river that is rank&quot;,

&gt; but in general Shakespeare does not use it to excess, his
&gt; word choices are more interesting and more polysyllabic, and
&gt; there is more use of internal rhymes and near alliterations
&gt; (such as the &quot;b&quot; and &quot;p&quot; of &quot;ruby-coloured portal&quot;). What
&gt; it all adds up to is a style that is markedly different
&gt; not only from what is in the poem above but also from
&gt; most, if not all, of his contemporaries.

"/>

My husband and I were listening to a god-awful piece of music on the radio
the other day. Our best bet was that it was by Salieri and we kept listening
to the end just to prove ourselves right. My husband, by the way, is a
classical musician. How are the mighty fallen! It was by Mozart, a
reasonably early piece, and was light years away from his later work. In
another universe, in fact.

The latest that &quot;Women&quot; could have been written was 1588. In fact it may
have been much, much earlier, judging from the style. That is not to say
it's god-awful. It's very good for what it is. But it's not mature
Shakespeare. Most people here do not seem to wish to understand that artists
go through an apprenticeship. They do not spring fully grown out of the sea
or the head of Zeus.

Best wishes,
Lynne

lines

&quot;to

is
&gt;&gt; another way of taking your ease, it sounds like he was taking his ease

The only good thing about this poem is the choice of metaphor - women as

Rubbish. Oxford was bisexual. He got a Lady in Waiting (Anne Vavasour)

I suggest that it was written when he was
12 or 13, and the bitterly cynical views on
&quot;women's changeableness&quot; derive mostly
from his feelings about the behaviour of
his mother -- with her new-found
attachment to Tyrell. Also, by this time,
he has been around the court quite a bit,
and seen what went on, especially
between his 'master-mistress' and her
'lovers' including Leicester, Ormond,
et al.

It's the first intimation of Hamlet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My reading: we spend all our time with women--until, finally, we
&gt; tire
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and go off to relax.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yep, that's all it means. A phrase to fill up the line when he
&gt; couldn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think of anything else, but needed something to rhyme with &quot;please&quot;.
&gt; It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be more appropriately used in a context where doing what he
was
&gt;&gt;&gt; doing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before he took his ease was something that suggested effort. But two
&gt;&gt; lines
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before he tells us that disporting with women/hawks is something
done
&gt;&gt;&quot;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pass the time when nothing else can please&quot;. And since passing the
&gt; time
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another way of taking your ease, it sounds like he was taking his
ease
&gt;&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taking his ease. It's a good example of Oxford's biggest problem as
a
&gt;&gt;&gt; poet:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he keeps forgetting what he's just written.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Buffalo, my dear, as Fagin would say:

&gt;&gt; I notice that I'm not the only one you're dear-ing today.

&gt; I &quot;my deared&quot; someone else? How promiscuous of me.

&gt; Criticism of this
&gt;&gt; poem obviously pulls your wire. But if you want to defend it, you'll
have
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; do a bit more than you've done.

&gt; It pulls my wire because I think it's an excellent poem. There are many
&gt; poems of Oxford's I wouldn't defend.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It took another poet (Bob) to see how good &quot;Women&quot; is.

&gt;&gt; And trying to pull rank by implying that you and Bob as published poets
&gt; have
&gt;&gt; insights denied to me is not the way to do it. I see your reply appears
&gt;&gt; directly below a paragraph of mine that contains some detailed
criticism.
&gt; I
&gt;&gt; would be much more impressed by some counter-criticism, something that
&gt;&gt; contested what I'd said.

&gt; I will, Buff, I promise, if you remind me when I get home.

&gt;&gt; There is something
&gt;&gt;&gt; you have forgotten also. This poem, like &quot;My Mind to Me a Kingdom is&quot;
is
&gt;&gt;&gt; most likely song lyrics, which puts it in a slightly different class.

&gt;&gt; But not a class that exempts it from normal standards of literary
&gt; criticism.
&gt;&gt; (My Mind to Me a Kingdom is - another example of Oxford's habitual
&gt;&gt; word-inversions, his way of signalling that he's writing poetry not
prose)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, if this poem were pinned on Shakespeare, my guess is that few
&gt; would
&gt;&gt;&gt; have problems with it.

&gt;&gt; Well, then, I'd be one of the few. I'm not a Bardolater, and I'm well
able
&gt;&gt; to distinguish the good from the less-good in Shakespeare. If I saw his
&gt; name
&gt;&gt; on this poem, I'd call it a bad day at the office.

&gt; Shakespeare had several bad days at the office; however, I would disagree
&gt; this was one of them. More likely a good day at school.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Although it comes earlier and displays the
&gt;&gt;&gt; alliterative poetic style that had gone out of fashion by the time the
&gt;&gt;&gt; sonnets were written, it is, imo, as good as some of the lesser
sonnets.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's why I was so surprised that at least two of you were happy to
&gt; give
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt; to Oxford. Most anti-Oxfordians fight that attribution to the death.

&gt;&gt; Alliteration was certainly more fashionable earlier in the century, but
&gt; even
&gt;&gt; poets of those times knew where to draw the line. I've been through all
&gt;&gt; Oxford's poems, and find many of them to be excruciatingly
&gt; over-alliterated,
&gt;&gt; though &quot;Women&quot; isn't one of them.

&gt;&gt; I'm perfectly happy to give this poem to Oxford. It isn't worth fighting
&gt;&gt; over. It's inclusion makes his corpus better than it otherwise would be,
&gt; but
&gt;&gt; not by very much.

&gt;&gt;&gt; My guess is that whoever wrote this poem, whether Oxford or
&gt;&gt;&gt;someone else (my money, of course, is on Oxford), was a young
&gt;&gt;&gt;Shakespeare. It has his ease of style, his assurance, his use of
&gt;&gt;&gt;metaphor and bawdy, his dislike of women (as exhibited in the sonnets).

&gt;&gt; The only good thing about this poem is the choice of metaphor - women as
&gt;&gt; hawks flying from man to man is a striking image. And he holds onto it
and
&gt;&gt; plays with it for a while in a way that is reasonably competent. That's
&gt; all
&gt;&gt; I can grant it.

&gt;&gt; As for Shakespeare's dislike of women in the sonnets - we haven't seen
it
&gt; so
&gt;&gt; far in our journey through the collection, have we?

&gt; I certainly have. Women as receptacles.

&gt; Rubbish. Oxford was bisexual. He got a Lady in Waiting (Anne Vavasour)
&gt; pregnant. He was married twice and had several children. But he clearly

Which part of what I said is rubbish - &quot;he liked them fine&quot; or &quot;it was
Oxford that didn't&quot;? My reasons for saying Shakespeare was not a misogynist
are based on my readings of his poems and plays, because I know nothing
about his real life relations with women. With Oxford, it has to be the
other way round. There isn't enough poetry to give us much idea (though
&quot;Women&quot; obviously doesn't help his case), but from what I know of his life,
he did not hold them in much regard.

Also, you are surely not so naive as to imagine that you've listed in your
rejoinder anything that disqualifies a man from being a misogynist.

Crap. Yet another worthless opinion
based on nothing but a generalised
prejudice. Quote some lines that support
that argument -- other than misreadings

who share your (quasi-Strat) opinions
have been studying the sonnets for
decades (if not centuries), and have
come up with zilch.

And how come there is absolutely
NOTHING in the plays?

"/>

Who said there was a play on it: &quot;Make sweet some vile&quot;? In any case, the
idea that a woman is vile or even a vial or walls of glass is
depersonalising her. That is what I feel in these early sonnets, that women
are depersonalised and slighted, as if they aren't members of the club that
the poet and addressee belong to. There is an exception--when the poet talks
of the addressee's mother or mothers in general. Later, when we get to 20,
we see women as a group--

But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,
Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.

This reminds me of the way women are spoken of in the poem we are
discussing. Not really a negative allusion in 20, as in &quot;Women&quot; but les
girls are not individuals either. Later, in the Dark Lady sonnets, there are
flashes of real hatred against the addressee, whoever she is:

For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

Shakespeare is very slighting about women in some of the sonnets, and
downright nasty about them in others. I can point out his nastiness as we go
along. He is also quite horrible about Venus' character in V and A.

If you think Oxford is a misogynist on the basis of &quot;Women&quot; and his life,
you must also consider Shakespeare a misogynist, or at least, a *particular*
woman hater, on the basis of some of the sonnets and V and A. There is a

&gt;Here is a poem (not by Oxford) from the 1576 *Paradise of Dainty Devices*
&gt;(I have modernized the spelling):

&gt; No pleasure, without some pain

&gt; Sweet were the joys, that both might like and last,
&gt; Strange were the state, exempt from all distress:
&gt; Happy the life, that no mishap should taste,
&gt; Blessed the chance, might never change success.
&gt; Were such a life to lead, or state to prove,
&gt; Who would not wish, that such a life were love.

&gt; But O the soury sauce of sweet unsure,
&gt; When pleasures fly, and flit with waste of wind:
&gt; The trustless trains that hoping hearts allure,
&gt; When sweet delights do but allure the mind.
&gt; When care consumes and wastes the wretched wight,
&gt; While fancy feeds, and draws off her delight.

&gt; What life were love, if love were free from pain?
&gt; But O that pain, with pleasure matched should meet:
&gt; Why did the course of nature so ordain,
&gt; That sugared sour, must sauce the bitter sweet.
&gt; Which sour from sweet, might any means remove,
&gt; What hap, what heaven, what life, were like to love.

&gt;I think a poem such as this may be a more useful comparison for &quot;If women

It'd be fun to argue this at length, Jim, but I don't have the time. I will
say, though, that I'm not arguing that the alleged Oxford poem is in
Shakespeare's style or that it has the earmarks of a Shakespeare poem, only that
it is as good as many of Shakespeare's many B-poems. The stanza of
Shakespeare's that you quote seems above that level--but I bet if Oxford had
written it, detractors would be horrified at the THREE instances of &quot;or&quot; in its
first line (with an extra r-sound, to boot). Also, there are only two words in
the Shakespeare that are genuinely more than two syllables long. I agree that
there are too many f-words in the other poem. ANd that the thinking is sloppy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Woman's Changeableness.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If women could be fair and yet not fond,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or that their love were firm not fickle, still,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would not marvel that they make men bond,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By service long to purchase their good will;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But when I see how frail those creatures are,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I muse that men forget themselves so far.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To mark the choice they make, and how they change,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How oft from Phacbus do they flee to Pan,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unsettled still like haggards wild they range,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These gentle birds that fly from man to man;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Who would not scorn and shake them from the fist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And let them fly fair fools which way they list.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet for disport we fawn and flatter both,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To pass the time when nothing else can please,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And train them to our lure with subtle oath,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Till, weary of their wiles, ourselves we ease;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And then we say when we their fancy try,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To play with fools, O what a fool was I.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RNP

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think Bob needs to take another look at Shakespeare's verse.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The above poem is not much more than doggerel. Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt; is guilty of a few lapses in taste, mostly in Lucrece, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; his verse is never this repetitive or simple. The hallmarks
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Shakespeare's verse are the mellifluous phrasing achieved
&gt;&gt;&gt; *without* excess alliteration, the intricate manner in
&gt;&gt;&gt; which most words are connected in some way to others, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting word choice. Compare for example the second stanza
&gt;&gt;&gt; above with this stanza from V&amp;A:

&gt;&gt;&gt; ===
&gt;&gt;&gt; Once more the ruby-coloured portal opened,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Which to his speech did honey passage yield;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Like a red morn, that ever yet betokened
&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.
&gt;&gt;&gt; This ill presage advisedly she marketh.
&gt;&gt;&gt; ===

&gt;&gt;&gt; There were few, if any, poets then who would attempt a line
&gt;&gt;&gt; as non-regular as the last one, and note how Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt; uses alliteration. He uses &quot;f&quot; as does the author
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the above poem, but only twice; the other alliteration
&gt;&gt;&gt; is on &quot;h&quot; and he contrasts the soft sounds of the &quot;f&quot; with the
&gt;&gt;&gt; hard &quot;g&quot; of gusts, while the author of the above poem
&gt;&gt;&gt; uses far too many &quot;f&quot;'s (&quot;fist&quot;, &quot;fly fair fools&quot;).
&gt;&gt;&gt; Note the many words longer than 2 syllables in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare passage, the second stanza above has one (&quot;unsettled&quot;).

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't mean to imply that Shakespeare never uses
&gt;&gt;&gt; too much alliteration in some of his passages, for
&gt;&gt;&gt; example, this line by itself in V&amp;A is not great, imo:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Rain added to a river that is rank&quot;,

&gt;&gt;&gt; but in general Shakespeare does not use it to excess, his
&gt;&gt;&gt; word choices are more interesting and more polysyllabic, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; there is more use of internal rhymes and near alliterations
&gt;&gt;&gt; (such as the &quot;b&quot; and &quot;p&quot; of &quot;ruby-coloured portal&quot;). What
&gt;&gt;&gt; it all adds up to is a style that is markedly different
&gt;&gt;&gt; not only from what is in the poem above but also from
&gt;&gt;&gt; most, if not all, of his contemporaries.

&gt;&gt; My husband and I were listening to a god-awful piece of music on the
radio
&gt;&gt; the other day. Our best bet was that it was by Salieri and we kept
listening
&gt;&gt; to the end just to prove ourselves right. My husband, by the way, is a
&gt;&gt; classical musician. How are the mighty fallen! It was by Mozart, a
&gt;&gt; reasonably early piece, and was light years away from his later work. In
&gt;&gt; another universe, in fact.

&gt; Why are you telling us that you don't recognize Mozart? I couldn't either
&gt; for sure, but I don't brag about it.

"/>

I would suggest that there are maybe one or two people, if that, on hlas who
could recognise every single piece that Mozart has written. It is no shame
to admit one doesn't know something. Not in my book, anyway.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; The latest that &quot;Women&quot; could have been written was 1588. In fact it may
&gt;&gt; have been much, much earlier, judging from the style. That is not to say
&gt;&gt; it's god-awful. It's very good for what it is. But it's not mature
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare. Most people here do not seem to wish to understand that
artists
&gt;&gt; go through an apprenticeship. They do not spring fully grown out of the
sea
&gt;&gt; or the head of Zeus.

&gt; That's a given, but as usual you miss the point. It's not like
Shakespeare's
&gt; writing.

"/>

I disagree. I am entitled to do that, I suppose?

If you want to claim that it is not like Shakespeare because
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; it was written when he was young, then any bad poem by any author can
&gt; be thought of in the same way, with the excuse &quot;well, he was young.&quot;
Therefore
&gt; there is no reason to believe that the above poem has any more
&gt; claim to Shakespearean authorship than anything else. It's just a bad

"/>

poem.

I disagree again. There is some poetry written when he was young that is
light years from Shakespeare. That is the main reason that I gave the Mozart
parallel. Here and in one or two other poems usually attributed to him I can
see the possibility.

Best wishes,
Lynne

Just shows to what extent Osborne is not a critic but a reviewer who
reports on a media production; and a reviewer necessarilly performs
for an audience, too. Osborne is comparing himself to an eunuch,
aware he is only a society functionary. That such creatures use
sexual innuendo to describe authors is telling, assuming that personal
comparison is involved. A good example is Max Eastman's insight that
Hemingway imitated his fictional self as if to prove his manhood by
showing hair on his chest. In Perkin's office, Hemingway tore open
Eastman's shirt to see if he had any hair there, which of course he
hadn't. Hemingway thought he had the last laugh, but the academic
community has found him indelicate and unworthy of emulation, it
appears. bb |

This poem is in the old alliterative style, which we don't find in
Shakespeare except as parody (&quot;He bravely broached his bloody boiling
breast&quot;). There is a generation gap between this and Shakespeare. At
the beginning of Spenser's Amoretti there is a pair of commendatory
sonnets by father and son which illustrates this nicely.

G.W. Senior, to the Author

Dark is the day when Phoebus' face is shrouded,
And weaker sights may wander soon astray;
But when they see his glorious rays unclouded,
With steady steps they keep the perfect way:
So, while this Muse in foreign lands doth stay,
Invention weeps and pens are cast aside,
The time like night, deprived of cheerful day,
And few do write but (ah) too soon may slide.
Then hie thee home, that art our perfect guide,
And with thy wit illustrate England's fame,
Daunting therebyour neighbours' ancient pride
That do for poesy challenge chiefest name:
So we that live, and ages that succeed,
With great applause thy learned works shall read.

Ah, Colin, whether on the lowly plain,
Piping to shepherds thy sweet roundelays;
Or whether singing in some lofty vein
Heroic deeds of past or present days;
Or whether in thy lovely mistress' praise
Thou list to exercise thy learned quill,
Thy Muse hath got such grace, and power to please
With rare invention beautified by skill,
As who therein can ever joy their fill?
O therefore let that happy Muse proceed
To climb the height of Virtue's sacred hill,
Where endless honour shall be made thy meed
Because no malice of succeeding days
Can raze those records of thy lasting praise.
G.W.J.

(I get these from the Longman edition of Douglas Brookes-Davies,
except for any typing errors of my own. He identifies the initials GW
as Geoffrey Whitney.)

The father uses alliteration regularly as a feature of his rather
stiff verse. The alliterations fall in emphatic positions in the line.
The son writes in a lighter, smoother, easier style. If there are two
words beginning with the same letter, they are not stressed - it looks
as if they were accidental.

G.W. Senior writes as elderly amateur poets often do: &quot;As a hopeless
epigone he keeps on sailing in the wake of the masters whom he admired
when he was young.&quot; (E. Fraenkel, 'Horace', p.17)

I would suggest that Shakespeare may have begun a bit earlier than
you imagine and occasionally reverted near the end of his life to the
style with which he began both here and in certain fragments in
Macbeth .Alternatively,the final editor(Middleton,if an editor is
needed),finding gaps in the deceased's foul papers, filled in with
bits of a surviving earlier drafts from the eighties.

No, certainly not, though I do think the actor has some work to do to
stop them. I should have realised Shakespeare can use anything! What
is happening here (as I see it) is that a great king (so addressed by
Lear) is making a sudden startling personal declaration. The level of
his language rises to meet the occasion - archaism often gives the
impression of majesty. Aristotle, Poetics ch. 22 applies to styles as
well as to words.

But I would still contend it is for special uses, not part of
Shakespeare's general style.

Fragments, I would suggest, in which he varies his style for special
effect - but I do't know exactly which ones they are.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This poem is in the old alliterative style, which we don't find in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare except as parody (&quot;He bravely broached his bloody boiling
&gt;&gt;&gt; breast&quot;).

&gt;&gt; How about this,Robert? King Lear,Act One,Scene One.

&gt;&gt; FRANCE
&gt;&gt; .....................
&gt;&gt;Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
&gt;&gt;Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
&gt;&gt;Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
&gt;&gt;Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.

&gt;&gt; Do you really think the author intended the audience to break out
&gt;&gt;in guffaws at this point?

&gt; No, certainly not, though I do think the actor has some work to do to
&gt; stop them. I should have realised Shakespeare can use anything! What
&gt; is happening here (as I see it) is that a great king (so addressed by
&gt; Lear) is making a sudden startling personal declaration. The level of
&gt; his language rises to meet the occasion - archaism often gives the
&gt; impression of majesty. Aristotle, Poetics ch. 22 applies to styles as
&gt; well as to words.

&gt; But I would still contend it is for special uses, not part of
&gt; Shakespeare's general style.

&gt;&gt; I would suggest that Shakespeare may have begun a bit earlier than
&gt;&gt;you imagine and occasionally reverted near the end of his life to the
&gt;&gt;style with which he began both here and in certain fragments in
&gt;&gt;Macbeth .Alternatively,the final editor(Middleton,if an editor is
&gt;&gt;needed),finding gaps in the deceased's foul papers, filled in with
&gt;&gt;bits of a surviving earlier drafts from the eighties.

And therefore not unlikely once a part of his general style as
in the exquisite opening to &quot;like haggards wild they range.&quot;

&gt; Fragments, I would suggest, in which he varies his style for special
&gt; effect - but I do't know exactly which ones they are.

If Shakespeare had in the past been an alliterative poet (I think this
is what you are saying) then to prove it we need an extended example,
not just a few lines. Have we a play of Shakespeare that looks
anything like Jasper Heywood's Seneca? (Heywood? Hayward? Haywood?
Heyward? Jasper, anyway.)

Ir seems we have two approaches:
1. Shakespeare had been a writer in the old alliterative style, but
had thrown it off and returned to it only for special effects.
2. The old alliterative style was out of date when Shakespeare began
to write and he, as a consciously up-to-date poet, avoided it except
when it suited him to use it for special effects.

These are not so far apart as it may have seemed earlier in this
exchange. Even the parodies Shakespeare writes do not settle it: &quot;the
assumptions against which I exhibit most heat are assumptions of which
I myself have been a victim&quot; (Gilbert Ryle, introduction to The
Concept of Mind). But I do suggest that if we are going to say
&quot;Shakespeare set out as a writer in the old school&quot;, we need to adduce
some early work that really is old-school as a whole, not just in
particular short passages.

But, Robert, what I am, first of all, saying is that there is
nothing absurd about the form in itself(i.e.there is no aesthetic
reason that one couldn't make an excellent silent film, but no one is
now doing so) and,secondly ,that both Shakespeare and the author of
&quot;If woman could be fair&quot;(particularly in the first half) make
excellent use of their medium.
I noted similar &quot;archaic&quot; but powerful (at least to my ears)
material in Macbeth. And intended to raise two questions(we are not
far apart)(l)Would the author of Lear use this device for the first
time in his life before (unspoken assumption which you vocalized) a
large popular audience which would not(and could not have been
expected to) appreciate the extremely subtle vocal effects
involved(i.e.slipping in 'the waterish Burgundy' line).One explanation
is that he reverted of course for special effect to an old device
that once flowed effortlessly from his fingers. The other,I suggested
,that both the archaic fragments in Macbeth and Lear are the result of
an extremely respectful editor who was handicapped by his lack of fair
copy.
That gets back to the question of what Shakespeare meant by the
first heir of his invention. How much experience did the poet need to
write the Venus. If King John is say 1589 or even 87,as I think
probable,the situation gets even more thorny.
I must stop. Bot I believe a lot of experience in a time when he
could have written occasionally in the old style is probable.
