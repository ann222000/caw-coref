I was wondering if somone could address the claim that the Oxford theory is
taken seriously by acedemics is in the UK. So far as I know, it's seen as
as much nonsense in the UK as it is over here, but wanted to let the
Shakespeare group weigh in.

I would guess that most academics in the UK who have a background in
Elizabethan England think the Oxford theory is rubbish. The Oxford
movement began in England when school master, J. Thomas Looney
published his little book in the 1920s

All the British academics I know who specialize in Elizabethan history

co-author of the new book (&quot;The Truth Will Out&quot;) arguing that Henry
Neville was Shakespeare, but Rubenstein is a historian of 19th- and
20th-century England, with no specialized knowledge of Elizabethan
literature that I'm aware of. In fact, to judge from the Shakespeare
authorship article he wrote a few years ago for &quot;History Today&quot;, along
with the &quot;Media Pack&quot; for his new book, his knowledge of Elizabethan
literature and history is rather shaky and filled with the usual
antistratfordian misunderstandings, and is not of a type that would
compel anyone to take his opinions on the subject seriously.

In a puff piece for his book

Professor Rubinstein says that anti-Stratfordian theories face &quot;adamant
and virtually unanimous opposition from nearly all established scholars
of Shakespeare&quot;. He's probably credible on that point, if not on much
else.

The normal career path for established scholars begins with university
study under some established scholar, continues with some junior
academic appointment which will in due course lead to tenure as
established scholar provided the young academic's published writings
are viewed favorably by established scholars on the tenure committee.

It's a long and arduous path, along which would-be established scholars
acquire a vested interest in established orthodoxy in the form of
intellectual capital which, if all goes well, will ensure the scholar's
passage through decades of work into financially secure retirement.

All of us are protective of things which are important to us.

Thus, it is in the nature of things that radical departures from
established orthodoxy are unlikely to come from within the ranks of
established scholars.

Rubenstein is a well-respected academic --
although that fact is no bar to putting out
rubbish; of which I'm sure that his new
book will prove to be an unmitigated pile.

BUT, while his book is little more than another
straw in the wind, the point is that a gale is
blowing. The academics &quot;who specialize in
Elizabethan history or literature&quot; are getting
more and more annoyed, as more and more
'ignorant' folks are asking questions, and are
not satisfied with the brush-off answers that
were accepted (more-or-less) up to recently.

Okay. Suppose I grant you this.

We might object that the subject matter of English literature, and of
literary studies generally, was not created by scholars, let alone
&quot;established&quot; scholars. Yet experts in English literature are,
admittedly, established scholars employed by universities.

What is the missing premise? It is again obvious: there exists a solid
and well-articulated body of knowledge that explains the proper
&quot;scientific&quot; way to study and to write about literature, comprising (as
the layman would see it) psychology, social science, and philology,
among other fields.

Maybe in Denmark they believe this.

Since this thread is cross-posted to a comics group, and there are a
handful of science-fiction experts here in the Shakespeare newsgroup
(as well as a couple of people who might well be religious nuts, but
who are certainly at least secular cranks), might one want to replace
even my preliminary objection, with something along the lines of:
'those authors were _in reality_ nothing more than the witting or
unwitting pawns of those who had indeed been trained according to
&quot;establishment&quot; standards of &quot;scholarship&quot;'? You tell me.

But -- I forget myself -- your point was only that, as everyone knows,
large and long-established institutions and disciplines tend to be
resistant to change, and so require mechanisms for permitting change
instigated from the outside to be absorbed into their own methods of
operation. As might be expected from an IMF economist.

Your point is wholly an Establishment one. But you've left loopholes
scattered throughout your argument, in which all kinds of crank
theories might be able to nest. &quot;Let a hundred flowers bloom,&quot; is
_not_ an idea I'd expect to see supported by an IMF economist, from
Harvard or anyplace else, and I don't think when Jesus said, &quot;In my
Father's house are many mansions,&quot; Chairman Mao is quite what he had in
mind.

&quot;In due course&quot; ought perhaps to be made more precise. The normal
probationary period at most institutions for a freshly-minted Ph.D.
appointed to a tenure-track position is six years. A scholar appointed
to a tenure-track position after one or more postdoctoral appointments
might easily negotiate a shorter probationary period, and many people in
that situation do.

"/>

No, that's a radical oversimplification; although procedures vary
slightly among institutions, initial tenure recommendations are normally
made not by a &quot;tenure committee&quot; but by a vote of the entire tenured
faculty in the department in which the candidate holds an appointment.
That departmental recommendation is generally based in part *not* upon
department members' assessment of the candidate's work, since few (if
any) of the candidate's colleagues are likely to be specialists in the
candidate's field, but upon opinions of the candidate's work solicited
from widely recognized leaders in the candidate's field of speciality
outside the candidate's institution.

Many other factors enter into such decisions as well, including the
quality of the candidate's teaching (as assessed by the candidate's
departmental colleagues and often by the candidate's students), the
candidate's willingness to shoulder departmental and institutional
committee work and other administrative burdens, his or her service to
the profession, etc.

Once the department settles upon its recommendation, the case is
passed on to the level of institutional oversight, generally by the Dean
in consultation with a committee. A negative recommendation from the
candidate's department kills the candidate's case at the outset, but a
very enthusiastic (even unanimous) departmental recommendation may well
be overturned by the Dean or his/her advisory committee; such denials
may very well turn upon unpredictable factors such as budgetary
constraints, but they may also result from the Dean's own sometimes
idiosyncratic reading of the experts' opinions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's a long and arduous path,

It is indeed arduous, but not generally long, unless the candidate is
denied tenure and must thus seek employment elsewhere; as noted, the
normal probationary period is six years, and strong candidates in demand
by other institutions can and often do negotiate early tenure decisions.

Again, this caricature of the process is far from accurate. In fact,
tenure frees a researcher to undertake riskier and more speculative
projects. Indeed, some of the most controversial proposals (such as
Martin Bernal's _Black Athena_) have come from tenured academics.

I've already mentioned Martin Bernal's _Black Athena_. One could
also mention the radical and certainly controversial explanation
suggested by Alvarez and Alvarez and colleagues for the mass extinctions
at the K-T boundary. And if John Mack's explanation of the widespread
preoccupation about alien abductions is not &quot;radical,&quot; then one wonders
what gangleri means by the word. All of these radical proposals were
made by established scholars. Gangleri seems rather out of touch with
reality where the academy is concerned.

It sounds overstated to me. There's no doubt that Shakespearean scholars
dismiss alter-Shakespeareanism, but &quot;adamant and virtually unanimous
opposition&quot; makes it sound as though established scholars devote a
significant amount of time to the authorship 'question,' and most of
them don't. Rubinstein claims that &quot;as a topic of discussion, it is
strictly taboo. [How can it be opposed if no one can mention it?] Most
academic conferences and journals concerned with Shakespeare and his
works automatically ban any discussion of this subject submitted for
consideration...&quot; He cites no examples of banned such automatically-
banned submissions, though he does go on to mention the ban on
authorship discussions at SHAKSPER, which he describes as &quot;the leading
Shakespeare academic website&quot; -- he somehow forgot that SHAKSPER is a
mailing list whose moderator banned authorship discussions not because
of fealty to some academic taboo but because of Richard Kennedy's
intemperate behavior.

Amusingly, Rubinstein goes on to say that the imaginary taboo on
authorship discussion &quot;is not as outrageous as it may seem,&quot; seeing as
how &quot;although well-intentioned and often highly intelligent searchers
after the truth, many anti-Stratfordians have been egregious and
counterproductive in their persistence as well as in their lack of
compelling evidence.&quot; (Faith, here's an equivocator, that could swear in
both the scales against either scale...)

Depends what you mean by &quot;established scholars&quot;. I'd agree that people
with a significant body of work generally have an investment in a
certain academic approach or theory which makes then defensive of it
(if not necesarilly less innovative within that theory). That said
various academic disciplines have changed greatly over time and while
there is a certain level of conservatism there's also the desire to

Comment:

Schumpeter and Keynes were the only 'revolutionary' thinkers in 20th
century economics, both of whom recognized the vacuity of established
orthodoxy which Samuelson summarized in the 1940s as follows:

&quot;The economist has consoled himself for his barren results with the
thought that he was forging tools which would eventually yield fruit.
The promise is always in the future; we are like highly trained
athletes who never run a race, and in consequence grow stale. It is
still too eearly to determine whether the innovations in thought of the
last decade [read: Keynes' General Theory] will have stemmed the
unmistakable signs of decadence which were clearly present in economic
thought prior to 1930.&quot;

Samuelson went on to cast pre-1930 &quot;economic thought&quot; in mathematical
form, laying thereby the foundations for what has since been mainstream
orthodox teaching and its offshoot known as The Washington Consensus.

Roger and I think we can possibly redate Tempest to 1604-1605, or
even--and this would be pushing it--1602. I don't know of any Oxfordian
who dates The Tempest to the 1570s, or suggests that it is a
pro-Catholic play, and I thought we'd read all the available
literature, both Oxfordian and traditional. Perhaps Elizabeth could
comment further.

Right. I don't know very many scholars personally, but the few that
I know devote about as much time to anti-Stratfordian scenarios as most
mathematicians devote to circle squarers, angle trisectors, and other
assorted mathematics and science cranks. That is, a few mathematicians
patiently explain to cranks who write or visit them where the errors of
the latter lie, generally without much comprehension on the part of the
cranks. It can seem like a waste of time, but it is also an important
public service. Indeed, I know of one physics/astronomy department that
gave one its graduate students (as part of his TA duties) the task of
answering all the department's crackpot mail. Some of the mail received
was rather amusing. I recall one letter that proposed a solution to the
problem of decaying satellite orbits and the dangers posed by their
uncontrolled descent to earth -- the writer suggested that astronauts
rendezvous with the satellite and attach helium balloons to it to float
it back up into a safe orbit! (Question to Art Neuendorffer: Have you
by any chance proposed that solution at NOAA, Art?)

The recognition of crankery is of course far more clear-cut in a
field like mathematics than in literary history, but the approach of the
scholars of whom I'm aware is pretty much the same -- they devote very
little time to the authorship &quot;question,&quot; if indeed they devote any time
to it at all. This fact should engender a greater appreciation among
anti-Stratfordians for the patience, forbearance, and generosity with
their time and expertise of the very few scholars like Dave Kathman and
Peter Groves who do take the time and trouble to respond.

Elizabeth has a charming way of coming up with &quot;facts&quot; that are news

that he used to hang around the theaters hoping to play female roles,
that he was eventually given a few such parts, and that he was quite
convincing as a girl? And did you know that &quot;shake-scene&quot; means &quot;stage
hand&quot; in Elizabethan theater slang? Or that &quot;Verulam&quot; means &quot;state of
truth&quot; in Latin? It is really remarkable what one can learn by reading
Elizabeth's posts!

You mean, she could supply her source? ELIZABETH??! Surely you've

Lynne.

Still, I have no doubt that she could indeed comment further, and I
hope that she will. Indeed, one can't lose -- if Elizabeth is right,
and some Oxfordians do date _The Tempest_ to around 1570, then that
information would furnish some new Oxfordian reading material that
promises to be even more amusing than many of the standard Oxfordian
works with which I am already familiar; if Elizabeth is wrong, then her
erudite commentary promises to be equally entertaining in its own right,
and I look forward to seeing with what new and surprising &quot;facts&quot; she

Lockyer was an astronomer - and in his case the university system was the
cranks - they rejected his findings without even looking at them
scientifically. I suppose this just goes to show that one can be a bit smug
about one's sensibleness, to the extent of taking all things which are

As I once patiently explained to Streitz

the problem is one of DRAG not LIFT:

A hypersonic balloon creates far more DRAG than LIFT.

As for NOAA satellites:

The Hubble Telescope flies at 600km. and orbitally decays over a few
decades. NOAA's low flying satellites are up at 840km. where the air
density is 10 times less. Ergo, our satellites orbitally decay over
a few centuries... long after the instruments have failed. However,
with a large enough helium balloon one could drop that down to years.

None of these people were cranks, Art. Meeting opposition from some
authority figure is not a sign of crankery _per se_. In the case of
Chandrasekhar, Eddington did not by any means refute his argument;
rather, Eddington opined (on aesthetic grounds) that there ought to be a
law forbidding stellar collapse above the Chandrasekhar limit. Bohr,
Pauli, and other greats supported and encouraged Chandrasekhar, but
nobody really wanted to offend a grand old man like Eddington.

None of these people were cranks, Art. Meeting opposition from some
authority figure is not a sign of crankery _per se_. In the case of
Chandrasekhar, Eddington did not by any means refute his argument;
rather, Eddington opined (on aesthetic grounds) that there ought to be
alaw forbidding stellar collapse above the Chandrasekhar limit.
Bohr,Pauli, and other greats supported and encouraged Chandrasekhar,
butnobody really wanted to offend a grand old man like Eddington.

Comment:

Chandrasekhar's point reduces to restatement under specified conditions
of Newton's conclusion that, IF things were as he supposed them to be,
universal gravity would cause the whole universe to collapse in on
itself.

As for &quot;nobody really want[ing] to offend a grand old man like

That's just the Canadian Hurricane center talking.

I wouldn't be too concerned until a detailed calibration
of the instruments and calculations is performed:
----------------------------------------------
Hurricane Wilma Discussion Number 16 Corrected

Statement as of 5:00 am EDT on October 19, 2005
...To use the proper word...relayed...

&lt;&lt;in addition to the spectacular cloud pattern observed on satellite
...An Air Force reconnaissance plane measured 168 knots at 700 mb
and estimated a minimum pressure of 884 mb extrapolated from 700mb.
Unofficially...the meteorologist on board the plane relayed an
extrapolated 881 mb pressure and measured 884 mb with a dropsonde.
This is all in association with a very small eye that has been
oscillating between 2 and 4 N mi during eye penetrations. This is
probably the lowest minimum pressure ever observed in the Atlantic
Basin and is followed by the 888 mb minimum pressure associated
with hurricane Gilbert in 1988. However...one must be very careful
before it is declared a record minimum pressure until a full and
detailed calibration of the instruments and calculations is
performed. So please do not jump into conclusions yet...be patient.

Wilma is a catastrophic category five hurricane that is moving over
very warm waters...typical of the northwestern Caribbean Sea...and
within an environment of light shear. However...despite the
favorable large scale environment...Wilma is near its maximum
potential intensity and further strengthening is not anticipated.
Most likely...the small eye will collapse followed by slight
weakening or some fluctuations in intensity. Eyewall replacement
cycles will likely control the intensity for the next 2 to 3 days
while the hurricane is over the northwestern Caribbean Sea.
Thereafter...once Wilma reaches the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and
encounters the westerlies and high shear...weakening should begin.

The hurricane is moving toward the west-northwest or 295 degrees at
7 knots. It seems that data from the high altitude NOAA jet
ingested by models caused the track guidance envelope to shift
slightly westward for the 2 to 3 day period. However...no change in
track is indicated over the Gulf of Mexico and guidance continues
to turn Wilma sharply to the northeast over Florida. Based on the
latest guidance...the official track forecast has been shifted
slightly westward but is kept on the eastern side of the envelope.
This in case the track guidance shifts back to the east in the next
run.

In summary...the official forecast brings the core of this
catastrophic hurricane northward through the Yucatan Channel and
then sharply turns a weaker hurricane to the northeast toward
Florida with an increase in forward speed.&gt;&gt;

few people immediately recognized their significance, and nearly all others

his theories, improbable as some of them must have seemed, were in

&gt;&gt; This is news to me. I certainly have never put forward such a

&gt;&gt; Tempest. Perhaps Lynne will have a comment about it.

&gt; Roger and I think we can possibly redate Tempest to 1604-1605, or
&gt; even--and this would be pushing it--1602. I don't know of any Oxfordian
&gt; who dates The Tempest to the 1570s, or suggests that it is a
&gt; pro-Catholic play, and I thought we'd read all the available
&gt; literature, both Oxfordian and traditional. Perhaps Elizabeth could
&gt; comment further.

This is puzzling. &quot;This Star of England,&quot; the Ogburns' magnum opus
(1297 pages) devotes 2 chapters to The Tempest, dating it as follows:
&quot;From the time of his imprisonment in the Tower, April-June 1581, until
his return to favor in June 1583, [Oxford] seems to have written eleven
plays. Of these the only ones which can justly be called comedies...are
As You Like It, Much Ado, and The Tempest; none of these is
light-hearted: the first has overtones of sadness, with banishment its
dominant note, the second is satirical, and The Tempest, based on
banishment again, is anything but merry.&quot; [p.357]. The Ogburns suggest
that the play is not so much pro-Catholic, as it is anti-Calvinist. And
that it is among the most &quot;autobiographical&quot; of &quot;Shakespeare's&quot; plays.

Are we discussing an hypothesis which is not testable, or hypothesies which
are not tested? David Webb has not responded to the subject of Lockyer
either. These ideas upon testing proved to be discomfitting to the
establishment to the extent that actual tests were delayed 100 years. [This
reminds me of Rowse's ennui... see below]

I am rather making the point that if there is no sincere investigation then
inevitably there will be no result - half-assed flip commentary being no
fair substitution for concentrated investigation - but acceptance of any
apparent strangeness is a subject of its own, and is met in all areas of
life. Acceptance of the New is not always the result of failing to look at
what is indicated, but is often in the evaluation of what is indicated.

These is more social science, but in a popular way you might look at Robert
Hughes's title, Shock of the New, which addressed the initial popular
pyschologial responses to Impressionism. There was nothing but mockery from
the establishment. This is somewhat at odds from our current acceptance of
Impressionism. As a study, it is illustrative.

I think you must more candidly address a mocking attitude by the
establishment to the possibility of the New hypothesis, as a contributory
factor in inhibiting its emergence. This is certainly true in all other
fields of endeavor!

In fact Rowse, perhaps sick and tired of the entire issue, proposed that no
real advances in Shakespearean studies would really happen for 50 years
since it seemed evident to him that there was no one receptive to the
leading edge of thought in his own time, although there were many
enthusiasts of all stripes.

This would be a populist response - that one must produce evidence in order
to sway /other/ people. But this is a different subject entirely to whether
anything might be investigated by /ourselves/. How happy are we with our
current theorums? Are they really so convincing? We have some doubts, no? If
not, do we not suspect that we are rather strange in not having doubts where
doubts seem indicated? What moves us to examine new things?

These are not generally populist activities, and if we were reliant on them,
instead of a more experimental and indeed risky attitude - which may as well
be non-rational too, we cannot [ratio] measure the New before we wander off
into the dark to explore its extent - then we would all still be living in

I ought to add that the Ogburns suggest that other hands completed the

Derby, Oxford's son-in-law via Derby's marriage to Elizabeth Vere,
Oxford's oldest daughter. They suggest that Ferdinando, Miranda's
suitor, memorialized William's brother, who died. And thereby made it
possible for William and Elizabeth to marry, in the merry old English
upper-class tradition that the daughter of an Earl couldn't very well
go about marrying a title-less lad, cadet son and all that. The
Spaniards don't come into this riff. According to the Ogburns, it's all
about Oxford (Prospero), &quot;Marina&quot; (the plays, and also, Elizabeth
Vere), Caliban (the Calvinists, who ought to be banned), and the
plotters (Oxford's enemies), on whom Oxford (Prospero) strongly desires
to wreak revenge.

If you've read any of Cantor's biography, Art, you should be aware
that Cantor had many mathematical supporters and admirers, among them
Dedekind and Mittag-Leffler, Heine, Hurwitz, and Klein, and only one
major detractor (Kronecker). Despite his opposition, Kronecker actually
*published* the paper that Cantor submitted to Crelle's journal. Even
Kronecker's opposition does not necessarily mean that Kronecker viewed
Cantor as a crank. This may be news to you, Art, but even scientists of
great power and originality often have their submissions rejected by
good journals, not because their work is crankery or even because it is
wrong, but because in the opinion of the referee or the editor, it is
not sufficiently interesting or important. Indeed, Cantor enjoyed
sufficient respect that a very strange paper of his was published,
probably after the mental problems that were to plague him began to
surface; the paper verifies Goldbach's conjecture for even integers less
than 1,000 -- but Goldbach's conjecture was *already known* to hold for
all even integers less than 10,000, and indeed had been known for nearly
a half century! Incidentally, Art, one of Cantor's biographers writes
that during the celebration of the 500th anniVERsary of the University
of St. Andrews in Scotland, Cantor's mental health began to deteriorate:

&quot;During the visit he apparently began to behave eccentrically,
talking at great length on the Bacon-Shakespeare question....&quot;

Einstein's theories were *never* as far as I know, considered crankery.
They were published in mainstream (although small circulation)
journals. A few people immediately recognized their significance, and
nearly all others recognized that they might be *wrong*, but deserved
testing. Why? Because his theories, improbable as some of them must
have seemed, were in accordance with known facts, explained things
well, and were testable.

Comment:

Einstein &quot;anticipated a lively, if critical, response to his work
[special relativity paper published in September 1905 in Annalen der
Physik - insert], but to his dismay there was none, either positive or
negative. No one seemed even mildly curious about his extraordinary
new view of the universe.&quot; (Denis Brian, 'Einstein - A Life', 1996, p.
67)

&quot;... Einstein submitted his application to Bern [in 1907 - insert],
together with his special relativity thesis and seventeen other
published works. To his dismay, the department head, Aime Forster,
turned him down flat, dismissing the relativity paper as
&quot;incomprehensible&quot;. Einstein blamed his rejection on ignorance.&quot; (Op.
cit., p. 70)

&quot;He had been brought to the Institute for Advanced Study to prove what
a forward-looking place it was, but virtually his first significant act
there as a physicist was an attempt to overturn the theory [QM -
insert] that seemed to be the wave of the future. It was as if he were
taking physics back to the Dark Ages, and other physicists were a bit
distressed. J. Robert Oppenheimer visited the Institute in 1935, the
same year that Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen were coming out with their
paradox. &quot;Einstein is completely cuckoo,&quot; Oppie said at the time.&quot;

I'm not talking about either. I'm talking about your two specific cases:

1) Was Einstein considered a crank? No, I don't think so - his papers on
relativity were published rapidly (on the scientific-publication time scale)
and were widely accepted as valid scientific theories, if perhaps wrong.
You *do* think he was considered a crank. Where am I wrong?

2) Was Schliemann considered a crank, or were his predecessors? I don't
know. I *do* know that anyone proposing the reality of a city of Troy and
the Trojan war before Schliemann's digs, purely on the basis of a poem,
*deserved* to be called a crank. It was Schliemann who established the
validity of using myth and legend as a source for scholarly investigation.
Note the careful choice of the word &quot;source&quot;. A poem is not evidence, it's
a hint about where to look for evidence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; either. These ideas upon testing proved to be discomfitting to the
&gt; establishment to the extent that actual tests were delayed 100 years.
[This
&gt; reminds me of Rowse's ennui... see below]

&gt; I am rather making the point that if there is no sincere investigation
then
&gt; inevitably there will be no result - half-assed flip commentary being no

"/>

The anti-Stratfordians have had 150 years or so to make investigations in a
field where amateurs can and do make significant contributions. I don't
think a lot of new stuff has turned up since the Ogburns and what they
turned up wasn't enough to raise more than a ripple in the scholarly
community; and what's come up since has done even less. If you want to get
people interested, come up with a convincing argument; or give it up.
Otherwise, you're a crank. You might be a nice crank, an
otherwise-well-informed crank, a genial crank, you name it, but a crank.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; fair substitution for concentrated investigation - but acceptance of any
&gt; apparent strangeness is a subject of its own, and is met in all areas of
&gt; life. Acceptance of the New is not always the result of failing to look at
&gt; what is indicated, but is often in the evaluation of what is indicated.

&gt; These is more social science, but in a popular way you might look at
Robert
&gt; Hughes's title, Shock of the New, which addressed the initial popular
&gt; pyschologial responses to Impressionism. There was nothing but mockery
from
&gt; the establishment. This is somewhat at odds from our current acceptance of
&gt; Impressionism. As a study, it is illustrative.

"/>

I suppose you can call Hughes work social science, but the art he discussed
wasn't. If Hughes is dismissed as a crank, you've got a metaphor; but the
difference between proposing a radical scholarly/scientific theory (his
wasn't radical, as far as I know) and creating new art forms is so great as
to make them incomparable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I don't know if pre-Schliemann &quot;Trojans&quot; were called cranks or not, but
&gt;&gt; any
&gt;&gt; charges of crankery that might have been tossed about were put to rest
by
&gt;&gt; evidence.

&gt; I think you must more candidly address a mocking attitude by the
&gt; establishment to the possibility of the New hypothesis, as a contributory
&gt; factor in inhibiting its emergence. This is certainly true in all other
&gt; fields of endeavor!

&gt; In fact Rowse, perhaps sick and tired of the entire issue, proposed that
no
&gt; real advances in Shakespearean studies would really happen for 50 years
&gt; since it seemed evident to him that there was no one receptive to the
&gt; leading edge of thought in his own time, although there were many

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; enthusiasts of all stripes.

&gt;&gt; Before someone actually produced some, unfounded speculation on
&gt;&gt; the reality of Troy *would* have been crankery. If you can produce
&gt;&gt; evidence, people will go your way.

&gt; This would be a populist response - that one must produce evidence in
order
&gt; to sway /other/ people. But this is a different subject entirely to

This is populism? I thougth it was scientific method.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; anything might be investigated by /ourselves/. How happy are we with our
&gt; current theorums? Are they really so convincing? We have some doubts, no?
If
&gt; not, do we not suspect that we are rather strange in not having doubts
where
&gt; doubts seem indicated? What moves us to examine new things?

"/>

If we are unhappy with the current &quot;theorems&quot; regarding Shakespeare, we
should indeed propose alternatives. Propose an alternative, back it up, and
if it makes sense, I'll listen to it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; These are not generally populist activities, and if we were reliant on
them,
&gt; instead of a more experimental and indeed risky attitude - which may as
well
&gt; be non-rational too, we cannot [ratio] measure the New before we wander
off
&gt; into the dark to explore its extent - then we would all still be living in
&gt; caves.

&gt;&gt; Likewise, if any mainstream academic could produce a convincing case
&gt;&gt; against
&gt;&gt; William of Stratford's authorship, he would never have to teach another
&gt;&gt; English 101 in his life.

&gt; I have not met a single person who could enunciate why the matter of
&gt; authorship would make the slightest difference to their appreciation of
the

&gt; I am sorry not to be able to conclude as you do.

&gt;&gt; You'll do better with other examples. Von Daniken?

&gt; It is unnecessary to speculate on my behalf, there are plenty of people

This sounds like Galileo was considered a crank by the &quot;qualified&quot;
scientists of his time:

&quot;Galileo Galilei, Paduan mathematician, came to us at Bologna, bringing
his telescope with which he saw four feigned planets [the moons of
Jupiter]. I never slept on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth of April,
day or night, but I tested this instrument of Galileo's in a thousand
ways, both on things here below and on those above. Below, it works
wonderfully; in the sky it deceives one, as some fixed stars are seen
double. I have as witnesses most excellent men and noble doctors ...
and all have admitted the instrument to deceive. Galileo fell
speechless, and on the twenty-sixth ... departed sadly.&quot;

I think most people would read it that way, don't you? The more
quotations you read, the stronger the impression becomes. Nobody in
modern times would dismiss the results of an experiment so
high-handedly.

Of course, eventually the man was vindicated. And everyone knows
there's a difference between innovation and pseudo-science. Galileo's
problem was that the orthodoxy of his time was pseudo-science, whatever
Karl Popper might say (and if Popper, who studied physics as an
undergraduate, really believed Galileo was wrong in comparison to
Cardinal Bellarmine, it doesn't reflect all that well on the science
education of his time, imho -- possibly he felt constrained not to
contradict the religious orthodoxies of his contemporaries?).

Oxfordians' arguments too often seem like someone arguing Galileo was
wrong, and only cranks accept Galileo, because there are all these
credible statements saying that he was.

Here is the ruling of the &quot;theological qualifiers&quot; on the first -

&quot;That the sun is in the centre of the world, and totally immovable as
to locomotion.&quot;

- of two propositions they were asked to consider:

&quot;Censure: All say that the said proposition is foolish and absurd in
Philosophy, and formally heretical inasmuch as it contradicts the
express opinion of Holy Scriptures in many places, according to the
words themselves and according to the common exposition and meanings of
the Church Fathers and doctors of theology.&quot;

Stillman Drake, from whose essay on Galileo in the Past Masters series
the citation is taken, puts the Galileo episode in perspective in the
first paragraph of his Preface as follows:

&quot;The silencing and punishment of Galileo twoard the end of a life
devoted to scientific inquiry was an event of profound significance for
our cultural history. Its full understanding requires much more than
an assumption of inevitable conflict between science and religion - a
cliche which originated largely from the case of Galileo that it is
widely used to explain. If any simple explanation existed, it would
rather be in terms of the customary ruthlessness of societal authority
in suppressing minority opinion, and in Galileo's case with
Aristotelianism rather than Christianity in authority.&quot;

Customary ruthlessness?

Customary perhaps, but ruthlessness is not the proper term for the firm
determination of sober-minded agents of societal authority, who are -
or feel - called to protect the status of right opinion by suppressing
foolish and absurd opinion by assorted upstart looneys.

Looneys, who arrogate to themselves the right to abuse their freedom of
thought and expresssion.

And reached the root, and fed upon it;
Then, in a language newly learned,
I grew another stalk and turned
Your stanza patterned on a sonnet,
Into my honest roadside prose--
All thorn, but cousin to your rose.

&quot;Reflected words can only shiver
Like elongated lights that twist
In the black mirror of a river
Between the city and the mist.
Elusive Pushkin! Persevering,
I still pick up your damsel's earring,
Still travel with your sullen rake,
I find another man's mistake;
I analyze alliterations
That grace your feasts and haunt the great
Fourth stanza of your Canto Eight.
This is my task: a poet's patience
And scholiastic passion blent --
Dove-droppings on your monument.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Given the unusual nature of the beast successful mathematics
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;cranks&quot; are a little hard to come by but there is certainly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our beloved (Baconian) Georg Cantor.
&gt;&gt;&gt; David L. Webb wrote:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But Cantor was not a mathematical crank (not while he was sane,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at any rate), merely a Shakespeare authorship crank.
&gt;&gt;&quot;Art Neuendorffer&quot;&lt;aneuendorffer114 ... @comcast.net&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; So Cantor's rather peculiar mathematical ideas
&gt;&gt;&gt; were accepted immediately?
&gt; David L. Webb wrote:

&gt;&lt;&lt;If you've read any of Cantor's biography, Art, you should be
&gt; aware that Cantor had many mathematical supporters &amp; admirers,
&gt; among them Dedekind &amp; Mittag-Leffler, Heine, Hurwitz, &amp; Klein,
&gt; and only one major detractor (Kronecker).

&gt; Despite his opposition, Kronecker actually *published*
&gt; the paper that Cantor submitted to Crelle's journal.&gt;&gt;
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------
&gt; So Kronecker was more fair &amp; responsible than, say, Eddington or
&gt; the sleaze balls who will prevent Roger &amp; Lynne from publishing.

"/>

The last I heard, their paper was still not complete, although they
had sent out a draft to various people who might be intersted; if the
paper was not complete, then Lynne and Dr. Stritmatter can scarcely have
been prevented from publishing -- although the fact that submission is a
necessary precondition for publication may well be news to you, Art. It
is true that, according to Lynne, they have been refused as speakers at
a major conference, but that is a completely different matter from being
unable to publish. For that matter, it is my understanding that they
*are* speaking at another major conference. Your &quot;Petulant Paranoid&quot;
persona is always so entertaining, Art!

&gt;&lt;&lt;Even Kronecker's opposition does not necessarily mean that Kronecker
&gt; viewed Cantor as a crank. This may be news to you, Art, but even
&gt; scientists of great power &amp; originality often have their submissions
&gt; rejected by good journals, not because their work is crankery or
&gt; even because it is wrong, but because in the opinion of the referee
&gt; or the editor, it is not sufficiently interesting or important.&gt;&gt;
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------
&gt; Did Kronecker's misgivings about Cantor's paper mean that it
&gt; was not sufficiently interesting or not sufficiently important?

"/>

Who knows? In any event, Kronecker published it, so the basis for
his opposition is not recorded.

As an amusing aside, one of my colleagues tells me that when
Lefschetz was editing _Annals of Mathematics_, he once sent a manuscript
that had been submitted to that journal to a referee with the following
instructions (I'm paraphrasing):

&quot;Dear ____, Please reject this paper. Sincerely, Solomon Lefschetz.&quot;

(This incident is known because Lefschetz's letter to the referee was
inadvertently sent to the author of the paper along with the referee's
negative report.)

&gt;&lt;&lt;Indeed, Cantor enjoyed sufficient respect that a very strange paper
&gt; of his was published, probably after the mental problems that were to
&gt; plague him began to surface; the paper verifies Goldbach's conjecture
&gt; for even integers less than 1,000 -- but Goldbach's conjecture was
&gt; *already known* to hold for all even integers less than 10,000,
&gt; and indeed had been known for nearly a half century!&gt;&gt;
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------
&gt; No doubt Cantor actually had A PROOF involving Goldbach's
&gt; conjecture applicable to integers less than 1,000
&gt; that DID NOT simply involve TRIAL &amp; ERROR.

"/>

&quot;No doubt&quot;?! In fact, if you had read either the paper or one of
Cantor's biographers, you would know that the paper merely listed all
the ways that each even number less than 1,000 can be written as a sum
of two primes. In fact, that's exactly why I said that the paper was
VERy strange, Art. As at least one of Cantor's biographers has noted,
the paper was perhaps an indication of the impending mental breakdown
that became apparent to eVERyone when Cantor started babbling about
Bacon as Shakespeare. Note, howeVER, that although the paper was VERy
strange, and although Cantor was on the VERge of a nERVous breakdown,
his paper is *still* not crankery, because it is *correct* -- it may be
of VERy limited interest and scant originality, but it is correct.

&gt;&quot;During the visit he apparently began to behave eccentrically,

Of course -- talking at length about Bacon as Shakespeare is nothing

Plainly, you are unfamiliar with Chandrasekhar's career, Art. He

No, that's because Chandrasekhar was not a crank, as many
anti-Stratfordians are.

Question:

Was Laplace a crank?

Looks like it to me.

Was there anyone in the 19th century physics community who called his
bluff?

I can't think of any.

Was the 19th century physics community a conclave of cranks by your

Mousie Sweetie - On the SF site, in a pointless discussion about Meres,
I discovered the following comment by Dr. Stritmatter.

Yes, we ought to be clear about this, Tom:
It is not necessary for the Oxfordians that Robert's analysis is
correct, although it may well be, and it certainly deserves further
consideration.
It is, on the other hand, absolutely necessary for the Stratfordians to
be correct when they insist that Meres is proof that the two names were
used to signify two different persons.
As Ken indicates, your own reasoning invalidates the Stratfordian
proposition in this case, since you admit that certainy about Meres'
intent does not exist.

Overall I'm not really surprised, but Roger's comment, about the
Oxenfordians don't need analysis to be correct, is a rare admission by
one of your crowd. I take this to mean that anything written by someone
of your ilk doesn't have to be correct. It doesn't matter as long as
Oxenfordian writings stink up the joint to distract people from the
fact that everything from Looney to Anderson to your presentation, it
would be foolish to call it a paper since it appears you haven't
written it, is a pile of crap!

Lynne sugar, the name Mousie doesn't fit you; Litter Box Cat is more

&gt; Einstein's theories were *never* as far as I know, considered crankery.
&gt; They were published in mainstream (although small circulation)
&gt; journals. A few people immediately recognized their significance, and
&gt; nearly all others recognized that they might be *wrong*, but deserved
&gt; testing. Why? Because his theories, improbable as some of them must
&gt; have seemed, were in accordance with known facts, explained things
&gt; well, and were testable.

&gt; Comment:

&gt; Einstein &quot;anticipated a lively, if critical, response to his work
&gt; [special relativity paper published in September 1905 in Annalen der
&gt; Physik - insert], but to his dismay there was none, either positive or
&gt; negative. No one seemed even mildly curious about his extraordinary
&gt; new view of the universe.&quot; (Denis Brian, 'Einstein - A Life', 1996, p.
&gt; 67)

"/>

I'll accept this one as relevant, but no one seems to be calling him a
crank, just irrelevant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&quot;... Einstein submitted his application to Bern [in 1907 - insert],
&gt; together with his special relativity thesis and seventeen other
&gt; published works. To his dismay, the department head, Aime Forster,
&gt; turned him down flat, dismissing the relativity paper as
&gt;&quot;incomprehensible&quot;. Einstein blamed his rejection on ignorance.&quot; (Op.
&gt; cit., p. 70)

"/>

Nope, being dismissed by an ignorant department head doesn't qualify you for
crankdom.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&quot;He had been brought to the Institute for Advanced Study to prove what
&gt; a forward-looking place it was, but virtually his first significant act
&gt; there as a physicist was an attempt to overturn the theory [QM -
&gt; insert] that seemed to be the wave of the future. It was as if he were
&gt; taking physics back to the Dark Ages, and other physicists were a bit
&gt; distressed. J. Robert Oppenheimer visited the Institute in 1935, the
&gt; same year that Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen were coming out with their
&gt; paradox. &quot;Einstein is completely cuckoo,&quot; Oppie said at the time.&quot;
&gt; (Ed Regis, 'Who Got Einstein's Office', 1987, p. 24)

"/>

I don't think we were talking about his later work opposing QM, which I
agree some saw privately as crankery, but which was always, as far as I
know, received with respect publicly.

Anyway, I'll stand down on this issue.

Was it dismissed as &quot;crankery&quot;? I don't know. I thought, perhaps, simply
not verified for ... oh a couple milennia. I happened to check this the

atoms at that time. Doesn't seem like &quot;crankery&quot;, but I could be wrong.

I suddenly remember why I looked it up. Andrews was debating Crowley about

&gt;&gt;&gt; there's a difference between innovation and pseudo-science. Galileo's
&gt;&gt;&gt; problem was that the orthodoxy of his time was pseudo-science,
whatever
&gt;&gt;&gt; Karl Popper might say (and if Popper, who studied physics as an
&gt;&gt;&gt; undergraduate, really believed Galileo was wrong in comparison to
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cardinal Bellarmine, it doesn't reflect all that well on the science
&gt;&gt;&gt; education of his time, imho -- possibly he felt constrained not to
&gt;&gt;&gt; contradict the religious orthodoxies of his contemporaries?).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxfordians' arguments too often seem like someone arguing Galileo was
&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong, and only cranks accept Galileo, because there are all these
&gt;&gt;&gt; credible statements saying that he was.

I was going to say, &quot;Are you kidding?&quot; But I guess your point must be
that Galileo's case immediately broke the hold of the Catholic Church
on scientific inquiry, and academic inquiry more generally. In other
words, everybody saw that Galileo had been right and Rome had been
wrong, and that Rome had acted unjustly in the &quot;silencing and
punishment&quot; of Galileo (as gangleri's source has it), and from then on
they rejected Rome's suggestions as to how they should think about
science. That's one way of telling the story. But it's not really
what happened. Luther, too, seems to have thought his ideas were so
rational that the church hierarchy would obviously accept them. There
should have been other ways to deal with the problem Galileo's
telescope posed; no one serious who understood what was at stake could
have approved of the way it was done unless he'd thought a lesson was
going to be learned, or believed he had no choice whatever.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;There is no
&gt; doubt that some valid and valuable scientific ideas were dismissed

&gt; But are there any examples where *150 years* later the scientist was still

I believe Mendel was probably considered a crank, more or less, by
those few who were aware of his work, given that literally nobody paid
any attention to it for forty years. Maybe there were people (God
knows who) who read it, and discussed some amusing ways in which he
seemed to have gone wrong, but that is not the same thing -- there was
nobody who was knowledgeable and qualified to think about what he'd
written who used the material (much less disparaged it) until around
1895, when a handful of scientists independently discovered the papers
in an obscure journal nobody actually working in the field read. In
Mendel's case, the way his work was received seems to have had no ill
effects, either on the science he founded or on the study of its
history, but perhaps in Mendel's case, we were lucky.

So it seems reasonable to guess that to his fellow monks, he was a
genial crank who had permission to carry out his odd studies, though
they were of no conceivable use. What those who accepted his papers
for publication thought is anyone's guess, but they forgot him quickly
enough.

There are so many misunderstandings and errors in your caricature
that it is difficult to know where to begin. First, if you are
referring to Laplace's claim that one need only know the initial
conditions in order to predict the future of the universe, I don't know
of anyone, including Laplace, who took that as literally as your
simplistic, cartoonish conception suggests. Laplace was well aware (as
is anyone who has any experience at all with differential equations)
that if one perturbs the initial conditions of even the most tractable
evolution equations, then the solution curves can drift *very* far away
from those of the unperturbed equation as time elapses; thus one would
need an absolutely *exact* measurement of the initial conditions in
order to make such a prediction over an appreciable time scale, *even*
if one could solve the differential equations analytically. Second, as
Laplace knew as well as anyone, very few differential equations admit
explicit analytic solutions in any case, nor is perfect knowledge of the
initial conditions a remotely reasonable expectaion. Laplace's remark
should be viewed as the hyperbolic musings of one impressed by the
enormous and quite surprising power of differential equations to
describe a bewildering variety of natural phenomena. The utility of
differential equations in understanding fundamental physics has not
changed with the introduction of quantum mechanics.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Laplacian crankery (scientific determinism), which went unquestioned
&gt; in 19th century physics, went the way of the dodo with the advent of
&gt; quantum mechanics in the physics community of the 20th century.

"/>

On the contrary -- the unitary time evolution of the wave function
governed by the Schrodinger equation is still *perfectly* deterministic;
only the measurement of an observable causes the wave function to
collapse into an eigenstate of that observable.

In fact, the most surprising departure from what you call &quot;scientific
determinism&quot; arises not from quantum mechanics but from classical
mechanics -- that came with the realization that for many nonlinear
differential equations, the solution curves could be exponentially
sensitive to perturbations, but that it is nevertheless possible to gain
some qualitative understanding of the solutions in some circumstances.

Third, Laplace's whimsical idealization does not constitute crankery,
for an obvious reason: first, cranks are generally unfamiliar with the
rudiments of the subject of their crankery, whereas Laplace was a
master; second, cranks persist obliviously in their delusions despite
being shown clear-cut refutations (circle squarers, angle trisectors,
and some anti-Stratfordians are good examples).

In fact, nineteenth century physics was astoundingly successful both
at explaining virtually all the fundamental phenomena that were amenable
to precise observation at the time and at predicting as yet unobserved
phenomena via a fairly small collection of fundamental differential
equations; one of the few exceptions was the perihelion of Mercury, an
anomaly explained by Einstein's general relativity, a completely
deterministic theory. Moreover, nineteenth century classical mechanics
and electrodynamics are *still* in constant use as limiting cases of
more elaborate theories that afford better agreement with observation in
realms (small scales, high velocities, etc.) that were not accessible to
nineteenth century observational and experimental techniques.

Incidentally, some of Laplace's most important work was in the theory
of probability -- rather an odd pursuit for the dogmatic determinist of
your silly caricature.

Comment:

I'm sorry in spades this time for raising issues beyond your ken - the
author of the &quot;silly caricature&quot; is arguably more knowledgeable about
physics and the history of physics than yourself.

Here, for example, is how the author, Stephen Hawking, summarized the
facts of the matter in Ch. 4 of his 'A Brief History of Time':

The success of scientific theories, particularly Newton's theory of
gravity, led the French scientist the Marquis de Laplace at the
beginning of the nineteenth century to argue that the universe was
completely deterministic. Laplace suggested that there should be a set
of scientific laws that would allow us to predict everything that would
happen in the universe, if only we knew the complete state of the
universe at one time. For example, if we knew the positions and speeds
of the sun and the planets at one time, then we could use Newton's
laws to calculate the state of the Solar System at any other time.
Determinism seems fairly obvious in this case, but Laplace went further
to assume that there were similar laws governing everything else,
including human behavior.

The doctrine of scientific determinism was strongly resisted by many
people, who felt that it infringed God's freedom to intervene in the
world, but it remained the standard assumption of science until the
early years of this century. [...]

The uncertainty principle had profound implications for the way in
which we view the world. Even after more than seventy years they have
not been fully appreciated by many philosophers, and are still the
subject of much controversy. The uncertainty principle signaled an end
to Laplace's dream of a theory of science, a model of the universe
that would be completely deterministic: one certainly cannot predict
future events exactly if one cannot even measure the present state of
the universe precisely!

&gt; but it remained the standard assumption of science until the
&gt; early years of this century. [...]

&gt; The uncertainty principle had profound implications for the way in
&gt; which we view the world. Even after more than seventy years they have
&gt; not been fully appreciated by many philosophers, and are still the
&gt; subject of much controversy. The uncertainty principle signaled an end
&gt; to Laplace's dream of a theory of science, a model of the universe
&gt; that would be completely deterministic: one certainly cannot predict
&gt; future events exactly if one cannot even measure the present state of
&gt; the universe precisely!

"/>

One the contrary -- as I already noted, the Schrödinger equation is
completely deterministic, and the probabilistic aspects of quantum
mechanics do not arise from the uncertainty principle. In that sense,
conventional quantum theory says that one can predict a quantum system's
future state exactly, provided one has exact information of the initial
conditions (which, as I noted, was *already* hopelessly infeasible in
Laplace's Newtonian clockwork world), and *provided* one is willing to
forego any observation of the outcome. Since your familiarity with
these matters is evidently confined to the level of popularizations, I
refer you to Penrose's account of the unitary time evolution in quantum
mechanics:

&quot;Regarding [psi] [the wave function] as describing the 'reality' of
the world, we have none of this indeterminism that is supposed to be
a feature inherent in the quantum theory -- so long as [phi] is
governed by the deterministic Schrödinger evolution. Let us call
this evolution process U. However, whenever we 'make a measurement,'
magnifying quantum effects to the classical level, we change the
rules. Now we do *not* use U, but instead adopt the completely
different procedure, which I refer to as R, of forming squared
moduli of quantum amplitudes to obtain classical probabilities! It
is the procedure R, and *only* R, that introduces uncertainties and
probabilities into quantum theory.&quot; (p. 250)

It is only when one *measures* a quantum system that probabilities
enter. Of course, trying to do science without measurement or
observation is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, so scientists are
very naturally led to measure quantum systems and thereby to induce a
collapse of the wavefunction of the system to an eigenstate of the
observable being measured (this is Penrose's &quot;procedure R,&quot; although as
he remarks in a footnote, these two evolutions -- deterministic unitary
time evolution (U) and &quot;reduction of state vector&quot; (R) are already
explicitly identified in von Neumann's work).

Quantum mechanics did not overthrow a completely deterministic
universe, which was a chimera to start with because of the hopeless
infeasibility of perfect determination of initial conditions; rather,
quantum mechanics introduced a limit beyond which measurements could not
even be improved *in principle*. It is the measurement problem, *not*
an inherent indeterminism in the governing equations, that introduces
the probabilistic character in quantum mechanics. Indeed, the governing
equations are every bit as deterministic as those used by Laplace,
provided one forgoes measurement. It is the measurement problem in
quantum mechanics, not the uncertainty principle, that is insufficiently
understood and that lies at the root of controversies; the uncertainty
principle is a mathematical theorem (about a function and its Fourier
transform) that is well understood and not controversial at all.

However, the main point is that Laplace was definitely not a physics
crank for postulating the efficacy of techniques that had proved and
would continue to prove to be spectacularly successful, when no
observations were clearly violated by the theory. As I already said,
cranks are those who (1) do not know the rudiments of the subject in the
first place, and (2) continue undaunted in their delusions, utterly
oblivious to all refutations. Laplace does not fit either criterion.
Circle squarers, angle trisectors, Velikovskians, and certain
anti-Stratfordians do.

It's not a general rule, but I think it would
apply here. The aristocracy have left plenty
of descriptions of the 'lower-classes' and their
groupings, as they viewed them. They'd have
noticed the emergence of a 'middle-class' almost
as soon as it raised its ugly head. No doubt
only a tiny proportion of their observations
got into published texts. However, social class
is so pervasive and so important that IMHO
there would have been some records.

The first record in the OED (for 1766) is in a
private letter of an exiled Queen. The absence
of the term is fairly good evidence (if far from
conclusive) that there was not much of a
recognisable middle-class (as a class) in the
country before about 1700.

A rough equivalent is the French 'bourgeois'

Bourgeois OED
1. orig. A (French) citizen or freeman of a city or burgh,
as distinguished from a peasant on the one hand,
and a gentleman on the other; now often taken as
the type of the mercantile or shopkeeping middle
class of any country.

a1674 Clarendon Hist. Reb. III. xii. 241 He liv'd in a jolly familiarity

1794 J. Courtenay Pres. State Manners of France &amp; Italy ii. 25
Here the pretty Bourgeoise, drest in smiles and in charms.

But again, note the restriction of the sense
to someone of wealth and standing in a city
or town. It's nothing like our sense of 'middle-
class' now. It is far better to simply avoid the
use of the term when talking about people in
Shake-speare's day.

Only a total pedant would say that Jonson 'did not say' that the author
coined on earlier British language - which would be literally true, and
entirely misleading. Jonson said where not to look.

The reader should use their own judgement on what language the author
coined, and these surely juvenile references by Peter Groves apart - how
should anyone employed in these studies make of them? - Will they make up

Robert,

The very first time I met Mark (quite by accident), he was studying in
the Smith Library. He's lucky enough to live in an area where there are
several very good universities, including U Mass and Amherst, and he's
spent an enormous amount of time researching. I may not agree with
everything he's written, but I have enormous respect for him and am
proud to call him my friend. I am proud to call other scholars my
friends also, whether they're Oxfordians or Traditionalists. All they
have to do to earn my respect is show that they know what they're
talking about.

It's very easy to stand on the sidelines and cry foul, especially when
you've only managed to read part of the introduction of a rather large
book--which is all you had read at the time, and that's being generous.
So far your posts haven't revealed that you have much scholarship at
all--though it appears there's some stagecraft in there somewhere--so
it's hard for me to take what you say seriously.

Why not be a mensch, relax, and take a decent part in the proceedings?
It would work much better for you than insulting perfectly reasonable
people. Failing that, maybe you could go find a play to direct.

I have been quick to admit when there are problems with anything I'm

I always feel an honest approach is best. At least two non-Oxfordians
on hlas have access to our essays. Neither so far has suggested that
we've distorted, misread, or ignored anything. Nor am I desperate to
prove that The Tempest was written before 1604. I am an Oxfordian, it's
true, but rather different from most people on either side of the

might find fascinating or persuasive. Others here will tell you that
I've always felt that Shakespeareans of all stripes are more alike than

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think most people would read it that way, don't you? The more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quotations you read, the stronger the impression becomes. Nobody in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; modern times would dismiss the results of an experiment so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; high-handedly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, eventually the man was vindicated. And everyone knows

&gt;&gt;&gt; The point, to me, isn't even &quot;eventually&quot; - but fairly rapidly. There
&gt; is no
&gt;&gt;&gt; doubt that some valid and valuable scientific ideas were dismissed
&gt;&gt;&gt; initially, and no doubt that some scientists were probably called cranks
&gt; or
&gt;&gt;&gt; the equivalent. Even my arguments elsewhere about Einstein and
&gt; Schliemann
&gt;&gt;&gt; weren't to say that this couldn't happen - merely that I thought they
&gt; were
&gt;&gt;&gt; bad examples (and I may have been wrong even there).

&gt;&gt;&gt; But are there any examples where *150 years* later the scientist was
&gt; still
&gt;&gt;&gt; universally called a crank, then in the 151st year, he was vindicated?

&gt;&gt; How about Democritus' atomic theory?

&gt; Was it dismissed as &quot;crankery&quot;? I don't know. I thought, perhaps, simply
&gt; not verified for ... oh a couple milennia. I happened to check this the
&gt; other day, and it seems there were a few philosophers on to the idea of
&gt; atoms at that time. Doesn't seem like &quot;crankery&quot;, but I could be wrong.

"/>

I'm sure that there would have been a large group of people who would
have rejected it as 'bizzare' or manifestly absurd- but i'd have to
check.

I don't have time to develop this point but I might just quickly add
that I think there is a substantive difference between crankery in
science and crankery in history. The former being somewhat more
palatable than the latter.

&gt; I suddenly remember why I looked it up. Andrews was debating Crowley about

&gt; say, &quot;Of course, we don't know what the universe was made of before 5th C

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there's a difference between innovation and pseudo-science. Galileo's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem was that the orthodoxy of his time was pseudo-science,
&gt; whatever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Karl Popper might say (and if Popper, who studied physics as an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; undergraduate, really believed Galileo was wrong in comparison to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cardinal Bellarmine, it doesn't reflect all that well on the science
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; education of his time, imho -- possibly he felt constrained not to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contradict the religious orthodoxies of his contemporaries?).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxfordians' arguments too often seem like someone arguing Galileo was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong, and only cranks accept Galileo, because there are all these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; credible statements saying that he was.

&gt; nobody who was knowledgeable and qualified to think about what he'd

Art seems to think that the mathematical establishment regarded

publishing *one* of Cantor's papers -- this despite the fact that
Kronecker *did* publish Cantor's paper, that Cantor routinely published
mathematical papers throughout his career without interference by Art's
_bête noire_, the mathematical establishment, and that Cantor had many
distinguished supporters and admirers, among them Hilbert, Dedekind,
Heine, Klein, Hurwitz, Hadamard, Mittag-Leffler, and others. But then
Art doesn't seem to understand that even very good papers get rejected
all the time, not because they are wrong (far less because they are
crankery), but merely because journal editors don't view them as
sufficiently interesting or important. As noted, other journal editors'
tastes may differ, as the case of Cantor (among many others) illustrates.

Not that I don't find the subject interesting, but may I respectfully
ask that you no longer crosspost this conversation to the comic book
newsgroups? We're much too busy over there pondering far weightier
subjects than the authorship of Shakespeare's works, such as who would
win a fight between Superman and Martian Manhunter.

Thank you.

It is possible to read the denunciations of his work as _actually_

the conviction, as gangleri posted it here, as acknowledging that he is
right. Big deal. (I hope you aren't assuming post-1979 or post-1992
arguments to be typical of what was said at the time.)

The quotation I gave, and other contemporary quotations, show that he
was treated as a crank. The usefulness of the telescope in observing
the heavenly bodies was denied; sometimes the fact that it worked at
all, even on the ground, was denied; sometimes the fact that it seemed
to work was called a trick of the Devil. His ability to describe and
to interpret what he saw through the telescope was ridiculed. His
assertion that what he did see had anything to do with what we call the
&quot;sun&quot; and the &quot;planets&quot; was claimed to display his ignorance of &quot;real&quot;
astronomy. Some people refused to look through the telescope at all (I

Experts were sent to him to evaluate his work. He was required to
travel to Rome twice to be tried by the Inquisition. He lost his
academic positions and was told that nobody with an academic post
accepted the validity of his work. He was convicted of crimes. He was
imprisoned. He was informed that his work was prohibited by his
religion, though whatever real effect that had on him, I don't really
know. What work he did produce after his conviction was required to
conform to what he'd been told was doctrine. True, maybe through all

Exactly: he was vindicated *eventually*. He never knew about that, nor
did anyone near him, nor did anyone who knew his story. For centuries,
anyone who might have to worry about what the Catholic Church would
think, had to avoid the subject. And even in the Western European
modern scientific community, it took a couple of centuries to work out
a way of doing science in the face of opposition from Rome. Moreover,
if his case motivated the Vatican to crack down, it would have become
more and more difficult for others in Catholic Europe to work, and more
and more unlikely that anything they did work on could be heard about
elsewhere.

But also, part of my point is that there were _already_, as you
suggest, parts even of Catholic Europe that could operate without
Vatican control. The Vatican and the church hierarchy surely were not
capable of controlling all social activities from the top down. For
example, obviously the Vatican did not care about the use of telescopes
in the navy or in surveying work. They should _not_ have cared about
the movement of the sun and the planets. But they already had a
tradition of interpreting Greek and Latin books about the movement of
the heavenly bodies, and they considered everything written part of
their own realm. Galileo himself might have thought he was operating
in an arena in which the Vatican was not interested, and if so, he
discovered that he had been wrong; so did anyone who thought similarly
to him.

There is, in fact, little difference between the way some successful

Actually, he was only forbidden to claim that Copernicanism was a proven
fact. It was OK to show that it agreed with the observations (though, in
the form used by both Copernicus and Galileo, which depended on complex
combinations of circles, instead of the ellipses that were the real
answer, it was only a little better than Ptolemy's system).

And at the very same time that he was being found guilty, one of the
churchmen involved wrote in a letter that, if Galileo /had/ proved his
case (which he didn't even try to do, having limited his defense to the
claim that his accusers were too stupid to understand the truth), the
Church would naturally have to take a long, hard look at its views,
inasmuch it would be wrong for her to persist in upholding a position
that science had disproved.

Which is indeed what happened.

Thank you gangleri for your Einstein comments which any sober historian of
science will acknowledge as correct - this was only a side point in any
case, but for one year Einstein's famous-5 papers sat around with little
establishment notice. This was the only point I made - and this only because
I thought people would be familiar with it.

I have yet to read if anyone understood what the Astronomer Royal underwent
at the hands of the establishment. From general responses read here, I gain
the impression that Establishment is represented to immediately recognise
and laud the New. This are very strange comments to read!

While my original comment referred to an area of consideration in
Elizabethan times, Sheldrake is an interesting example to study from our own
period. For a dozen years he has been rocking the boat, suggesting
experiments which seem to refute explanation by previous means, and engaging
the scientific community with a less mechanistic view of causality.

Even so, his work is scarely known here, which I think qualifies the
critic's level of appreciation rather than of &quot;typical 'cranks'
encountered&quot;.

Cordially, Phil Innes

&gt; Einstein's theories were *never* as far as I know, considered crankery.
&gt; They were published in mainstream (although small circulation)
&gt; journals. A few people immediately recognized their significance, and
&gt; nearly all others recognized that they might be *wrong*, but deserved
&gt; testing. Why? Because his theories, improbable as some of them must
&gt; have seemed, were in accordance with known facts, explained things
&gt; well, and were testable.

&gt; Comment:

&gt; Einstein &quot;anticipated a lively, if critical, response to his work
&gt; [special relativity paper published in September 1905 in Annalen der
&gt; Physik - insert], but to his dismay there was none, either positive or
&gt; negative. No one seemed even mildly curious about his extraordinary
&gt; new view of the universe.&quot; (Denis Brian, 'Einstein - A Life', 1996, p.
&gt; 67)

&gt;&quot;... Einstein submitted his application to Bern [in 1907 - insert],
&gt; together with his special relativity thesis and seventeen other
&gt; published works. To his dismay, the department head, Aime Forster,
&gt; turned him down flat, dismissing the relativity paper as
&gt;&quot;incomprehensible&quot;. Einstein blamed his rejection on ignorance.&quot; (Op.
&gt; cit., p. 70)

&gt;&quot;He had been brought to the Institute for Advanced Study to prove what
&gt; a forward-looking place it was, but virtually his first significant act
&gt; there as a physicist was an attempt to overturn the theory [QM -
&gt; insert] that seemed to be the wave of the future. It was as if he were
&gt; taking physics back to the Dark Ages, and other physicists were a bit
&gt; distressed. J. Robert Oppenheimer visited the Institute in 1935, the
&gt; same year that Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen were coming out with their
&gt; paradox. &quot;Einstein is completely cuckoo,&quot; Oppie said at the time.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Einstein's theories were *never* as far as I know, considered crankery.
&gt;&gt; They were published in mainstream (although small circulation)
&gt;&gt; journals. A few people immediately recognized their significance, and
&gt;&gt; nearly all others recognized that they might be *wrong*, but deserved
&gt;&gt; testing. Why? Because his theories, improbable as some of them must
&gt;&gt; have seemed, were in accordance with known facts, explained things
&gt;&gt; well, and were testable.

&gt;&gt; Comment:

&gt;&gt; Einstein &quot;anticipated a lively, if critical, response to his work
&gt;&gt; [special relativity paper published in September 1905 in Annalen der
&gt;&gt; Physik - insert], but to his dismay there was none, either positive or
&gt;&gt; negative. No one seemed even mildly curious about his extraordinary
&gt;&gt; new view of the universe.&quot; (Denis Brian, 'Einstein - A Life', 1996, p.
&gt;&gt; 67)

&gt;&gt;&quot;... Einstein submitted his application to Bern [in 1907 - insert],
&gt;&gt; together with his special relativity thesis and seventeen other
&gt;&gt; published works. To his dismay, the department head, Aime Forster,
&gt;&gt; turned him down flat, dismissing the relativity paper as
&gt;&gt;&quot;incomprehensible&quot;. Einstein blamed his rejection on ignorance.&quot; (Op.
&gt;&gt; cit., p. 70)

&gt;&gt;&quot;He had been brought to the Institute for Advanced Study to prove what
&gt;&gt; a forward-looking place it was, but virtually his first significant act
&gt;&gt; there as a physicist was an attempt to overturn the theory [QM -
&gt;&gt; insert] that seemed to be the wave of the future. It was as if he were
&gt;&gt; taking physics back to the Dark Ages, and other physicists were a bit
&gt;&gt; distressed. J. Robert Oppenheimer visited the Institute in 1935, the
&gt;&gt; same year that Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen were coming out with their
&gt;&gt; paradox. &quot;Einstein is completely cuckoo,&quot; Oppie said at the time.&quot;
&gt;&gt; (Ed Regis, 'Who Got Einstein's Office', 1987, p. 24)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right. I don't know very many scholars personally, but the few

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know devote about as much time to anti-Stratfordian scenarios as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most mathematicians devote to circle squarers, angle trisectors, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other assorted mathematics and science cranks.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you mean to say that you can't draw the great pyramid with just
&gt;&gt;&gt; compass and straight edge? If you can't do that you also couldn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; construct Chartres. Why are medievel cathedral builders cranks?
&gt;&gt; No I'm sure he means exactly what he said.

&gt;&gt; It is impossible given a circle to construct a square of equal area using
&gt;&gt; ONLY a compass and a straight edge.

&gt; :)

&gt;&gt; It is likewise impossible given an angle to construct and angle that is
&gt;&gt; one-third of the given angel using ONLY a compass an straight endge.

&gt;&gt; And the handful of individuals who insist that these things are possible
&gt;&gt; are cranks.
&gt; John Michel is such a crank.

"/>

The ancients had precise rules for construction with compass and
straightedge; methods for squaring the circle, trisecting the angle, and
duplicating the cube *using those rules* were long sought. There are
now rigorous mathematical proofs (based upon elementary field theory)
showing that such constructions are impossible, just as there are deeper
proofs based upon Galois theory showing that the general equation of
degree five or higher cannot be solved by radicals. A readable and
thorough textbook reference for these theorems is Jacobson's lovely
_Basic Algebra I_.

There are many ingenious ways of trisecting the angle using more than
compass and straightedge, but these algorithms do not adhere to the
ancients' rules. There are also various iterative algorithms that
converge to a solution, but these methods are also inadmissible, as the
original problems require an *exact* solution in *finitely many steps*.
Those who do not understand these matters and persist in the futile
quest for ways of solving these classic problems now known to be
insoluble are indeed cranks.

I have no idea whether John Michel is one such or not; Mr. Innes's
reports of the opinions supposedly expressed by others (Orwell, etc.)
have not proven reliable in the past, so some caution is required. I
would request a specific reference, but Mr. Innes definitely has not
been forthcoming with references supporting his claims about Orwell,
etc., so I am not too optimistic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So I suppose that people who follows his
&gt; construction method are too. It's an interesting way to speak of people who

Mr. Innes never does so? Perhaps that's because the set of such is

Mark, I think you understood which book Chess One was talking
about, but in case anyone is confused, it should be pointed out
that this is a different Hughes than Ted Hughes, whom Chess One
also quotes.

I'm not sure there is a great deal of difference between
reactions to new artforms and reactions to new science. Science
always seems somewhat at issue with the church, and art always
seems somewhat at issue with those who prefer traditional
artforms.

Yet it seems that within the peer group, no one objects to the
newer ideas. For example, if you talked to established artists
today, they would mostly say 'Postmodern art, that's cool',
though some would not completely like it and would want to try
their own thing, and if you talked to scientists today, they
would all say 'Einstein, Darwin, that's cool', even if some
slightly disagree with Einstein or Darwin.

The problem seems to arise when those who are in power to judge
the new ideas are in a different peer group, e.g., church vs.
Roger Bacon, who got it much worse than Galileo. Or, as Chess
One points out (and I haven't read the book, though I have seen
it and have heard some lectures on the subject), traditional art
schools in Paris did not accept Impressionism, so the group
broke off and started their own new peer group.

Now, whether anti-Strats become their own peer group, I don't
know. Even if they do, there is always a possibility that their
ideas will never become accepted by the establishment.
Impressionism and relativity did become accepted. (Whether art
is accepted seems slightly more subjective to me than whether
science is accepted, and the length of time it takes can often
depend on the radicalness of the ideas, or on the particular
personalities or intellect of those judging.)

The question today, however, becomes, 'Is the establishment
losing its importance'? In other words, even if the
establishment seems to have better standards (in general --I
realize there are exceptional geniuses) for determining what is
correct, the populace seems not to be concerned with it. Or

Is it because the establishment sometimes has bad manners,

Comment:

If the Facts are against his client, a good lawyer is said to argue the
Law, and vice veras, if the Law is against his client.

But no lawyer of sound mind would ever compromise his client's case
through display of bad manners towards witnesses, opposing counsel,
members of the jury, or the judge.

While the circumstances are different in a forum like the present one,
it is hard to see why anyone would risk compromising his case by
presenting arguments in its favor or against alternative viewpoints in
language which, in some cases, would make Howard Stern blush.

&gt; Mark, I think you understood which book Chess One was talking
&gt; about, but in case anyone is confused, it should be pointed out
&gt; that this is a different Hughes than Ted Hughes, whom Chess One
&gt; also quotes.

&gt; I'm not sure there is a great deal of difference between
&gt; reactions to new artforms and reactions to new science. Science
&gt; always seems somewhat at issue with the church, and art always
&gt; seems somewhat at issue with those who prefer traditional
&gt; artforms.

"/>

In some ways, this forms a difference between Christian and modern
thought. Philosophy makes much of the ambiguity, in earlier English
writings and especially in German, between &quot;science&quot; or &quot;Wissenschaft&quot;
in the modern restricted sense meaning natural science, and an older
sense indicating all knowledge. Many who are educated in Western
philosophy, having been inculcated with this broader, more
sophisticated definition of &quot;science,&quot; will naturally assume that what
the church considers &quot;knowledge&quot; (another synonym for science, in
German and in ancient Greek) or &quot;science&quot; includes (by reference, as it
were) all knowledge in the modern sense that is worthy of the name.
Worse, perhaps, the very recent vindication of Galileo by the Vatican
makes a distinction between &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;science,&quot; which the kind of
person I've just described will probably naturally take to indicate the
classic medieval distinction between knowledge based on scriptural
principles and knowledge based on scientific principles; but this may
be wrong, as those who are aware of that medieval distinction may well
not be in the habit even of using terms like &quot;faith.&quot;

Art, on the other hand, has very rarely been considered a form of
knowledge, unless it is inspired directly by God, in which case it
becomes Scripture; and as everyone knows, Christendom has not has not
admitted any new Scripture for nearly two millennia, and is not likely
to do so in the near future. And Scripture is not read as Art, as
everyone who knows of the controversies over the still rather new
&quot;Bible as Literature&quot; courses will be aware.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Yet it seems that within the peer group, no one objects to the
&gt; newer ideas. For example, if you talked to established artists
&gt; today, they would mostly say 'Postmodern art, that's cool',
&gt; though some would not completely like it and would want to try
&gt; their own thing, and if you talked to scientists today, they
&gt; would all say 'Einstein, Darwin, that's cool', even if some
&gt; slightly disagree with Einstein or Darwin.

"/>

Um, trying not to be rude, but have you actually talked to both artists
and scientists and heard them say that? Are you translating what
they've said in some way so as to emphasize the similarity? (Are you
even entirely serious?) Or are you reporting what you've read in some
book, or had reported to you by somebody else? Or are you even,
possibly, deriving your statement from your theoretical beliefs? I'd
like to know more about the context of your statement, preferably, I
think, by seeing you discuss a greater variety of topics and subject
matters in a similar way, before I drew any conclusions about the
reliability of your statement. I feel I have to ask, or else ignore
what you say, unfortunately, because there are so many people making
unsubstantiated statements on Usenet, and it *would* seem unwise to
trust all of them unquestioningly.

&gt;&gt; order
&gt;&gt;&gt; to sway /other/ people. But this is a different subject entirely to
&gt;&gt; whether

&gt;&gt; This is populism? I thougth it was scientific method.

&gt; Method is process, populist response is to a result of process. You do not
&gt; need populaist response to undertake a process.

&gt;&gt;&gt; anything might be investigated by /ourselves/. How happy are we with
our
&gt;&gt;&gt; current theorums? Are they really so convincing? We have some doubts,
no?
&gt;&gt; If
&gt;&gt;&gt; not, do we not suspect that we are rather strange in not having doubts
&gt;&gt; where
&gt;&gt;&gt; doubts seem indicated? What moves us to examine new things?

&gt;&gt; If we are unhappy with the current &quot;theorems&quot; regarding Shakespeare, we
&gt;&gt; should indeed propose alternatives. Propose an alternative, back it up,
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; if it makes sense, I'll listen to it.

&gt; This is a result-oriented argument rather than a process one. It contains
a
&gt; presumption.

&gt; Some people write in order to explore [to process] a subject, and to state
&gt; their own perspective to other people who are similarly engaged.

&gt; Other people state the result of their processing - AND - it is
significant
&gt; that the reason they write is also [often!] different. They are no longer
&gt; sharing their process as much as proselytising it. They are out to
convince
&gt; other people.

&gt; These are 2 primary aspects to any field of investigation.

&gt; The second is not a prescriptive state. People will not necessarily
attempt
&gt; to influence other people about their results. Yet it is a common
attribute
&gt; to writing, especially in newsgroups. The presumption is not that there
&gt; point of view is absolutely correct - but that it is the 'right' result.

&gt; It is notable that such posters resent other people's results, and
sometimes
&gt; even independent areas of investigation, as if they felt threatened by
it -
&gt; and this occasions abuse /to the person/.

"/>

Am I missing the point? We are discussing conflicts between the
Establishment and the Anti-Establishment. Objection has been made to a
certain manner of, in many cases, persecuting those who present the New
(if I understand Mr. Innes's definition of the term), and of unfairly
claiming to have won the argument, on the part of the Establishment.
Whereas, oddly enough, the Establishment has no very obvious reason why
it should bother claiming to have won the argument, as the
Establishment can prevail in any dispute by main force should that be
the Establishment's desire.

So that it would indeed appear pointless for the Establishment to have
gone to any significant effort in order to create an appearance of
having won an argument. Of course, there may be members of the
defeated group who would be less likely to make a fuss if they believed
a real debate and/or &quot;trial&quot; had really occurred. And obviously there
may be members of the triumphant group who will also be more tractable
should they believe their side had always won all the arguments fair
and square. To put it in a way Mr. Innes might, I think, in many cases
the desire to believe one's side is morally correct may triumph over
the desire to be always historically accurate, and to do justice to
opponents.

Now, most people know (and this is an important point in explaining why
scientific progress &quot;works&quot;) that presenting one's ideas for critique
and correction is an important part of ensuring that one's ideas are
accurate to reality. Neither Mr. Innes nor Mr. Cipra so presents his
own ideas. Nor does either Mr. Innes nor Mr. Cipra appear to attempt
to read more and more books, and to test the ideas from one book, as he
understood it, against the next book, which appears to disagree. Both
Mr. Innes and Mr. Cipra begin with the idea that he is right about
pretty much everything, and that those who disagree with him
necessarily fall into one of the following two categories: those who
must be brought back to correct belief, and those who are hopeless. It
is obvious that Mr. Innes and Mr. Cipra each believes the other to fall
into the latter category; where each would place myself, is anybody's
guess.

But the effect is that neither Mr. Innes nor Mr. Cipra much cares
whether their opponents in argument understand or agree with their own
statements. Everything they say, and everything their opponents say,
turns out to be proof that they are right and their opponents are wrong
-- or, should their opponents happen to have said something with which
they agree, perhaps by presenting new evidence, whatever their
opponents said was not properly understood by the person who said it,
but only by themselves. It's a very convenient method. One wonders
how they manage to convince themselves both that it's morally
acceptable and that it's socially effective.

I myself am somewhat skeptical of what I read on the internet,
so I would certainly encourage you to find out for yourself
rather than to take anything I say particularly seriously.

As for myself, I have spent many years of my life around
scientists, including more than a few physicists, though I am
obviously not a physicist! My impression is that they regard
Einstein's theories very highly, but I did not discuss it with
them in any detail. My freshman university classes in science
never had lectures that questioned Darwin, Newton, or Einstein,
but rather seemed to support them.

My experience with traditional art is more limited, and my
talent in drawing, for example, is zilch. I did once take a
university course in History of Modern Art through 1945, so
after 1945, my knowledge is very fuzzy. I did meet an art major
or two in that class, and they certainly took modern art very
seriously. The teacher was very enthusiastic about both modern
and postmodern art. All I can say is that it certainly did not
seem to me that it was a joke to them at all.

I am also presently near Chicago, which
is a major US city for modern and postmodern art. One can easily
visit galleries and museums (and there is even at least one TV
show that sometimes touches on and interviews present-day
artists), and I can guess that there are people who live in
relative poverty producing these works of art, so I don't
believe that they don't take it seriously. But, no, I haven't
done a scientific survey asking their exact opinions, nor have I
met them (though I have met a few creative writers in past
years who certainly sometimes don't take all of literary theory
seriously, but who do seem to respect many of the traditional
and newer writers, but that is a whole 'nother story).

I'm sorry, I misunderstood. I thought you were focusing on something
else. I would indeed like to have more information about this theory
you were talking about, whether it involved eternal principles for
analyzing and understanding single works of art, or whether it involved
the way art forms evolve through time and eventually constitute
something similar to a mature science. Not because I believe it and
would like to help others understand it too, and not because I think it
might be believed by people I otherwise respect, but because I'm

&gt; This is puzzling. &quot;This Star of England,&quot; the Ogburns' magnum opus
&gt; (1297 pages) devotes 2 chapters to The Tempest, dating it as follows:
&gt;&quot;From the time of his imprisonment in the Tower, April-June 1581, until
&gt; his return to favor in June 1583, [Oxford] seems to have written eleven
&gt; plays.

"/>

Looney and the Ogburns subscribe to the Strat revisionist
school of romantic biographies. Young Shakespeare rolls
his hoop to petty school. Oxford conceals the works he wrote
for the Queen. Romance is promoted, evidence is demoted.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Of these the only ones which can justly be called comedies...are
&gt; As You Like It, Much Ado, and The Tempest; none of these is
&gt; light-hearted: the first has overtones of sadness, with banishment its
&gt; dominant note, the second is satirical, and The Tempest, based on
&gt; banishment again, is anything but merry.&quot; [p.357]. The Ogburns suggest
&gt; that the play is not so much pro-Catholic, as it is anti-Calvinist.

"/>

The experts on Catholicism in The Tempest are the seminarians
who edited the 1911 Catholic Encyclopedia. Shakespeare is going
to hell (purgatory is too good for him) for writing that life is
a dream and the soul sleeps in the grave. Heresy! The editors
held out hope that Shakespeare would reconsider his &quot;atheism&quot;
on his death bed and take last rites before he expired.

Contra the Ogburns, the Shakespeare works are not anti-Calvinist,
they are a reform Calvinist's examination of how the Calvinist
doctrine on &quot;will&quot; influenced English morals. (Calvinism was
in the process of taking over the Anglican Church at the time
the play was written -- Neville will be the &quot;other Calvinist
Bard&quot;).

Macbeth's Calvinist resgination to the doctrine of predestination
makes murder an easy choice to satisfy his ambitions. If you're damned

if you do and damned if you don't what's the distinction between
slitting a throat or a slap on the back? Life is a stage and actors
are only reading the script. The author, a reform Calvinist in the
modern Baptist vein (the Baptists took over the faculty at
Cambridge) was not as cynical as Macbeth.

Oxford, on the other hand, was a Catholic closer in his
thinking, if not his character, to Sir Thomas More than he was
to Shakespeare. Here's something Nelson missed:

Jesuit Scholar Thomas M. McCoog, S.J, in his article
&quot;The English Jesuit Mission and the French Match, 1579-1581,&quot; 1
expresses &quot;no doubt&quot; that Oxford was a Catholic:

There was no doubt about the Catholicism of Oxford,
Charles Arundell, Henry, Lord Howard, and Southwell:
the secular priest Richard Stephens (or Stevens) reconciled
them to the Roman Church during his stay in England between
November of 1576 and July of 1577.

There's no record that Oxford ever converted to the Church of England
as Southampton later did. The high Catholic aristocracy was permitted
to keep private chapel so other than his marriage (he called Cecil a
whore
per the Council of Trent) there is no indication of his belief one way
except for the documents the Jesuits are sitting on in Rome.

Nelson's indictment of Oxford does not take Oxford's motives into
consideration. Oxford is engaged in plots against the state because he
is &quot;monstrous,&quot; not because he's defending English Catholicism. More
revisionism.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And
&gt; that it is among the most &quot;autobiographical&quot; of &quot;Shakespeare's&quot; plays.

"/>

In what sense? Since Prospero is a pirate operating in the
Mediterranean the most likely Prospero is an authentic pirate that
really had a death sentence on his head, one who desperately
needed the King's redemption in the literal sense to save his
life, Sir Robert Dudley. Bacon was a bastard, if Leicester's
bastard (see the Spanish ambassador's letters in the Escurial)
Sir Robert Dudley was Bacon's half-brother. Dudley looked
like a young Francis Bacon, was a brilliant polymath like
Bacon and was driven by the same insatiable curiosity (Pasternak's
&quot;seeking gene&quot;). Dudley accumulated enormous
wealth through piracy and slavery but the London insurers and
Merchants were hurting so under pressure from that quarter
James I put a price on Dudley's head. Dudley retreated to
Italy.

Robert Wilson has written a well-received paper on the
&quot;Mediterranean Tempest&quot; theory which argues that Dudley
is Prospero. There are no loose ends, the widow Dido
and everything else that puzzled Strats is finally explained.

Wilson's paper does not eliminate the Virgina Company sources.
The Stuart &quot;dowry&quot; in 1613 was North America, and the Jamestown
colony gets more than a nod in the play. At the age of seventeen
Sir Robert Dudley captained his first ship in the Caribbean and
left an account of a tempest in the Bermoothes that is suspiciously
similar to A True Repertory (Spedding and Brown say Bacon wrote
the latter). Dudley is a thrilling Prospero in Wilson's paper.
Dudley even staged Kyd's Spanish Tragedy on the deck of his ship to
raise the morale of his crew. Naples and Milan also figure into it.

Bacon's motivation for writing the play would be to
pursuade James I to identify with Sir Robert Dudley
through their mutal characteristics in Prospero and
from there give Dudley the pardon that would save his
life. Prospero's eloquent plea for a pardon at the
end of the play was written to serve that end.

James must free Sir Robert Dudley as the English Redemptionist
movement was ten ransoming English slaves in North Africa.
It must have worked -- James I thought the play was FABULOUS
and had it staged many times at Court.

The happy ending: The king pardoned Dudley, gave him Leicester's
Kenilworth and eventually Dudley was able to retrieve what
he wanted, Leicester's Warwick Castle.

Cordially,

Elizabeth

I don't think I have much studied anything in such an abstract
way, though I was required to take one class in literary critical
theory, which covers essays written by those who are trying to
decide how to write and judge works of literary art. For the English
Renaissance, I recall the essay by Sir Philip Sidney where he discusses
what he thinks are the qualities of a good dramatic work (The Defense
of Poesie). There are modern editions of this. I believe that
literary criticism is in some ways an attempt to make the analysis
of literature more scientific or logical.

As far as 'art art', the terms 'philosophy of art', 'art critism'
'aesthetics', 'humanities', 'art appreciation', 'art history' come
to mind. Perhaps you might look at books in those areas to see
what in particular interests you, if you haven't already. I
noticed that artists themselves occasionally write very well
and express what they are trying to do too (Van Gogh, for example).

In the modern art class, I don't recall the teacher trying to explain
eternal principles of good art, but rather pointing out why a
particular work of art was innovative or unusually good. For example,
he might say that Cezanne painted fruit in such a way that it seemed
to be almost moving out of the painting towards you, or that someone
did such and such with brush strokes or lines or representation of
light or shadow, or that Picasso painted in such a way so as to
express the primitive within us.

I think others on this or other newsgroups might be able to give
you a better answer about books of this nature.

This clownish procedure is published here by someone who also thinks that

You might be right, but the quote that Bianca mentioned didn't
seem to be written by someone thinking about heresy. It wasn't
clear to me if the writer was from the church or from a
university, but he certainly went through all the scientific
steps to try to verify or deny the claim. He was just unable to
accept what he saw, so assumed that it was an illusion, and said
that others did the same.

An illusion could be an optical illusion or something like that,
which is something scientific, not magical or religious.

But by not accepting what G said, he was in effect implying that
G was either a crank or deluded, even if he was too polite to
say so.

It sounds like there were other people knowledgeable about
science at that time, including churchmen, who did not reject
G's theories. I think there was a long time span involved here
too. I wonder how Copernicus was treated.

I think you were completely right about Galileo: he was not a crank or
considered a crank by anyone of his time.

Comment:

Historian Gale E. Christianson has written of Galileo, inter alia, as
follows:

&quot;Whereas Kepler wrenched in agony when he discovered the hitherto
undreamed of principle of ellipses, Galileo relished almost to the
point of perversity the prospect of debunking the shopworn techniques
of those who defended the scientific status quo. Whereas Copernicus
held back the publication of his manuscript for fear of being publicly
ridiculed, Galileo - whilie under the ban of papal authority - wrote
and published a sizzling dialogue in which he attacked the
Aristotelians, an open invitation to public censure and worse.
Galileo, even more than the gregarious Tycho, was the supreme activist.
He derived an instinctive satisfaction from doing battle with others,
and thus became the central figure in the first major public conflict
between established authority and the search for truth in the history
of modern science.&quot; ('This Wild Abyss - The Story of the Men Who Made
Modern Astronomy', 1978, p. 253)

Now consider an anti-Strat, who relishes almost to the point of
perversity the prospect of debunking the shopworn orthodoxy of those
who defend the Stratfordian status quo - one who derives an instinctive
satisfaction from doing battle with Strats.

Perhaps Galileo's academic and religious foes were more enlightened -
but can there be any doubt that such an anti-Strat would be branded a
CRANK by his Strat foes?

&gt;&gt; what he thinks are the qualities of a good dramatic work (The Defense
&gt;&gt; of Poesie). There are modern editions of this. I believe that
&gt;&gt; literary criticism is in some ways an attempt to make the analysis
&gt;&gt; of literature more scientific or logical.

&gt;&gt; As far as 'art art', the terms 'philosophy of art', 'art critism'
&gt;&gt; 'aesthetics', 'humanities', 'art appreciation', 'art history' come
&gt;&gt; to mind. Perhaps you might look at books in those areas to see
&gt;&gt; what in particular interests you, if you haven't already. I
&gt;&gt; noticed that artists themselves occasionally write very well
&gt;&gt; and express what they are trying to do too (Van Gogh, for example).

&gt;&gt; In the modern art class, I don't recall the teacher trying to explain
&gt;&gt; eternal principles of good art, but rather pointing out why a
&gt;&gt; particular work of art was innovative or unusually good. For example,
&gt;&gt; he might say that Cezanne painted fruit in such a way that it seemed
&gt;&gt; to be almost moving out of the painting towards you, or that someone
&gt;&gt; did such and such with brush strokes or lines or representation of
&gt;&gt; light or shadow, or that Picasso painted in such a way so as to
&gt;&gt; express the primitive within us.

&gt;&gt; I think others on this or other newsgroups might be able to give
&gt;&gt; you a better answer about books of this nature.

For what it's worth, his reputation was not attacked by the RCC,

From 1616 to 1620, Copernicus' book was banned &quot;pending corrections&quot;.
The &quot;corrections&quot; announced in 1620 amounted only to removing nine
sentences saying that heliocentrism was not just a theory, but an
established fact; with those changes, the book was approved. In 1758
(the next thorough updating of the Index of Prohibited Books), all
mention of Copernicus was dropped.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Phil, being wrong is not what makes one a crank; what makes one a
&gt;&gt; crank
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is proposing a fallacious relatively complex theory and persisting
&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it in the face of all evidence against it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that is one condition of crankdom. But Einstein was a crank

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people got around to appreciating his genius. And who were the cranks

Dear Sweetie, did you ever try to get hold of a copy of Hughes in
Northampton [any Hughes]

They will offer you Langston, tons of it, and the good booksellers have no
idea of Ted, even though Sylvia and he taught there. The stacks are better,
and I have been the first reader of many a Smith acquisition from, say, by
the state of the pages even as earlier as 1950.

Hughes is also banned in the town because of his, of course, maleness. But
Sylvia's hand and writings is all over the posters.

To challenge a Smithie on these things occasions scorn. One needs to flounce
around - then, then it can be said that she saw his heart from the start,
and he instead perceived her over time, and even while abstracted, bemused,
famous, and even when she was dead, he loved her.

This is difficult for your Smithie, but it is admitted! Especially if what
she first indicated he then extrapolated.

That the Author was crucial to them both is a story one would hope another
lifetime together would unravel for them together.

&gt; The very first time I met Mark (quite by accident), he was studying in

&gt; friends also, whether they're Oxfordians or Traditionalists. All they
&gt; have to do to earn my respect is show that they know what they're

&gt; It's very easy to stand on the sidelines and cry foul, especially when

anyway stephanie, or lynne, can you remember your first books?

mine was a picture book which also had 2 levels of text, one as caption to
the picture, and the other the straight tale - intended for adult reading to
the child

but the subject of these books was none other than Toby Twirl, who was a
bear, who had the traditional little elephant friend, 'Eli', and Toby was
quite adventurous - his main antagonist was of course the witch who lived
the other side of the wood, and who kept 2 rooks in a cage hanging outside
her house

but where they rooks or ravens? maybe ravens?

of course the impetuous young Toby would lead sensible Eli through the wood
amid protestations, then approaching the wtich's house... but the cage was
open, the birds away... the witch too?

will they enter the house...

i wish i could find those books again, and don't know who wrote them, but
whoever that was, these were well fit my understanding, as well as superior
authors later

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other assorted mathematics and science cranks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you mean to say that you can't draw the great pyramid with just

&gt;&gt;&gt; No I'm sure he means exactly what he said.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is impossible given a circle to construct a square of equal area

&gt;&gt;&gt; ONLY a compass and a straight edge.

&gt;&gt; :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is likewise impossible given an angle to construct and angle that is
&gt;&gt;&gt; one-third of the given angel using ONLY a compass an straight endge.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And the handful of individuals who insist that these things are
&gt;&gt;&gt; possible
&gt;&gt;&gt; are cranks.

&gt;&gt; John Michel is such a crank.

&gt; The ancients had precise rules for construction with compass and
&gt; straightedge; methods for squaring the circle, trisecting the angle, and
&gt; duplicating the cube *using those rules* were long sought. There are
&gt; now rigorous mathematical proofs (based upon elementary field theory)
&gt; showing that such constructions are impossible,

Just to intercede here - the subject is not mathematics, but geometry. Mr

&gt; There are many ingenious ways of trisecting the angle using more than

Mr. Webb demands proofs already given to what I have cited of Orwell and

Mr. Webb knows that both conditions are true but this is his method of

&gt; Mr. Innes never does so? Perhaps that's because the set of such is

Mr . Webb has also not heard of Critchlow and therefore ducks his head. He
science in this case resides in a misrepresentation by Brennan [who has
never told the truth in his life] on the literary subject of an Orwell
'quote' - and this is club-Strat at play.

Clearly Webb knows nothing, has researched nothing, and is content with his
ignorance on other subjects, so long as he can posture before the fillies of

I cannot recommend this approach, nor that what supplicates itself has any

&gt; that the acceptance/rejection of Hughes's *book* might be a useful
&gt; analogy,
&gt; since the book itself could be considered social science.

"/>

Very good Mark.

[more asides] I suppose we should also note that the Shock of the New was
made into a television series, with Robt. Hughes himself presenting it. As
you note, someone that might combine more art &amp; science together would be a
figure like Leonardo, or Bacon.

[and even more] the sociological impact of the New seems interesting. Where
the New is an Idea there are interesting social patterns to observe, and I
think this is often confused in historical analysis such as we have in this
newsgroup;-

Let us consider a 'crank' ideas: geomantic issues relating to the landscape.

What one frequently encounters are belief systems rather than analysis. for
example, someone will not consider astronomical alignments in the landscape
to be 'real' therefore reject writing on the subject of geomancy - even
though the writer under historical consideration may have not rejected
astronomical alignments. in other words, the current reviewer rejects out of
hand what his subject did not. objectively astronomical alignments may be
proved false or otherwise, but these are not considered - the Idea of
astronomical alignments is rejected

this obviously presents difficulties in evaluating the original writer on
these subjects, since we may not even recognise that writer's investment in
such an 'abstruse' subject, because we consider it 'crankery'

to switch Hughes's from Robert to Ted: he wrote that in his opinion much of
Shakespeare has dissapeared from our view, since we do not credit the
author's investments in 'abstruse' materials, since we ourselves have made
an investment in a different sort of world-view

what I do not like in these conversations about 'crankery' is precisely
this; we are not as much appreciating the expression of the Work in
question, but rather judging its basis from our own held views

some sort of analogy would be playing a game like chess where the board and
the pieces were the same then as now, but somewhere between, the rules of
play changed [example, extent of queen's move, or differences in castling]

how should we appreciate the historical game if we reject it blinded by our
'superior' modern rules?

these remarks are to no very particular point, other than to make our
current worldviews more conscious - particualrly when there is a strong
emotional reaction, which typically expresses itself as a shock and with a
'I don't believe that' form of statement, since without being aware of what
our modern filters may be, we could render the subject of our attention
invisible to our conscious selves

&gt; Okay, at this point, I continued reading, but ceased understanding. Bye

&gt;&gt; You would have to presume it if you didn't understand it. But where is
&gt; your
&gt;&gt; own cupidity? Is your comment to be taken that Rowse held unwarranted
&gt;&gt; opinions? Or that /you/ do not accept them - or are even aware of them?

&gt;&gt; So what is the meaning of your expression?

&gt;&gt; -----

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before someone actually produced some, unfounded speculation on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the reality of Troy *would* have been crankery. If you can produce
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence, people will go your way.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This would be a populist response - that one must produce evidence in
&gt;&gt;&gt; order
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to sway /other/ people. But this is a different subject entirely to
&gt;&gt;&gt; whether

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is populism? I thougth it was scientific method.

&gt;&gt; Method is process, populist response is to a result of process. You do
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; need populaist response to undertake a process.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything might be investigated by /ourselves/. How happy are we with
&gt; our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; current theorums? Are they really so convincing? We have some doubts,
&gt; no?
&gt;&gt;&gt; If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not, do we not suspect that we are rather strange in not having doubts
&gt;&gt;&gt; where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doubts seem indicated? What moves us to examine new things?

&gt;&gt;&gt; If we are unhappy with the current &quot;theorems&quot; regarding Shakespeare, we
&gt;&gt;&gt; should indeed propose alternatives. Propose an alternative, back it
&gt;&gt;&gt; up,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; if it makes sense, I'll listen to it.

&gt;&gt; This is a result-oriented argument rather than a process one. It contains
&gt; a
&gt;&gt; presumption.

&gt;&gt; Some people write in order to explore [to process] a subject, and to
&gt;&gt; state
&gt;&gt; their own perspective to other people who are similarly engaged.

&gt;&gt; Other people state the result of their processing - AND - it is
&gt; significant
&gt;&gt; that the reason they write is also [often!] different. They are no longer
&gt;&gt; sharing their process as much as proselytising it. They are out to
&gt; convince
&gt;&gt; other people.

&gt;&gt; These are 2 primary aspects to any field of investigation.

&gt;&gt; The second is not a prescriptive state. People will not necessarily
&gt; attempt
&gt;&gt; to influence other people about their results. Yet it is a common
&gt; attribute
&gt;&gt; to writing, especially in newsgroups. The presumption is not that there
&gt;&gt; point of view is absolutely correct - but that it is the 'right' result.

&gt;&gt; It is notable that such posters resent other people's results, and
&gt; sometimes
&gt;&gt; even independent areas of investigation, as if they felt threatened by
&gt; it -
&gt;&gt; and this occasions abuse /to the person/.

&gt;&gt; This is a curiosity!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have not met a single person who could enunciate why the matter of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; authorship would make the slightest difference to their appreciation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; texts.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I know you've been posting here for quite a while. Don't you also read
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; postings of others?

&gt;&gt; That is direct a statement as I have read on this often impassioned

&gt; the Establishment's desire.

&gt; So that it would indeed appear pointless for the Establishment to have
&gt; gone to any significant effort in order to create an appearance of
&gt; having won an argument.

"/>

An interesting point - but we are not dealing with intellectual disruption,
we are dealing with EMOTIONAL shock. Response to this shocking new thing is
expressed intellectually, but that is a curiosity! There is a pretense not
to be shocked, and to have fairly evaluated the New thing, but no such thing
has taken place.

To return to Robert Hughes - he pointed out that Manet for example could
show female nudes in a park! One could not pretend one was looking at some
classical Amazons holding spears as if one were interested in the spears and
not the naked warriors. To observe the painting one had to admit a liking
for the women themselves.

This was no easy thing for duplitious Victorians. The shock was to confront
the non-intellectual interest of the viewer in a non-intellectual way.
Straightforward confrontation with especially sexuality was a Victorian
taboo, in an age where even table 'legs' were covered.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Of course, there may be members of the
&gt; defeated group who would be less likely to make a fuss if they believed

&gt; should they believe their side had always won all the arguments fair
&gt; and square. To put it in a way Mr. Innes might, I think, in many cases
&gt; the desire to believe one's side is morally correct may triumph over
&gt; the desire to be always historically accurate, and to do justice to
&gt; opponents.

"/>

In this case we see a conflict between highly artificial Victorian art
directly contrasted with Nature. It is not at all an intellectual issue,
only a pretended intellectual issue. It was an emotional address to the
thing most repressed. Who was its best analyst? Dostoyevski?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now, most people know (and this is an important point in explaining why
&gt; scientific progress &quot;works&quot;) that presenting one's ideas for critique
&gt; and correction is an important part of ensuring that one's ideas are

&gt; own ideas. Nor does either Mr. Innes nor Mr. Cipra appear to attempt
&gt; to read more and more books, and to test the ideas from one book, as he
&gt; understood it, against the next book, which appears to disagree. Both
&gt; Mr. Innes and Mr. Cipra begin with the idea that he is right about
&gt; pretty much everything, and that those who disagree with him
&gt; necessarily fall into one of the following two categories: those who
&gt; must be brought back to correct belief, and those who are hopeless. It
&gt; is obvious that Mr. Innes and Mr. Cipra each believes the other to fall
&gt; into the latter category; where each would place myself, is anybody's
&gt; guess.

"/>

I would say that in this case Innes and Cipra may fall into agreement. I
mean, these views are not controversial after all, are well noted, even if
they are difficult to negotiate!

I am making [not assuming Mark Cipra's agreement] a further case for our
modern sense of establishment also being shocked, and to some extent also
blinded to our received view of the Work. It is easy to retrospectively mock
the Victorians for their double standards - but where is any consciousness
of our own?

I do not as much care to convince anyone of a result, as Bianca says, as to
ask that when we all consider the Work, what filters may be impose on it
from our time, and ESPECIALLY to note that these may not be intellectual
filters, but emotional or psychological ones, not entirely conscious or
unified.

Should other people not care to consider themselves liable to such a
condition, and announce themselves immune to any distortions thereby, good
luck to them! But such people do not much ressemble real people if they
cannot admit that very many factors which motivate us are not intellectual
ones at all, but rather other complexities.

I would even state that this subject was the crucial one for the Author.

I need not speak for Mr. Cipra. but what is the alternative to engaging in
public discourse when you cannot ask other people if they experience certain

"/>

There is a presumption in that statement that one wishes to convince [as in
convert] someone else to a /result/. Whereas another possibility is to ask
if such-and-such a factor plays a part in another person's experience? In
other words, to look at the process, rather than to the result.

And for result, to let the chips lie where they may! Far from being
cooercive or insistant on one result, a rigorous process seems to provide a
very liberal atmosphere for whatever conclusion each person chooses to make
of it all.

Cordially, Phil Innes

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are cranks.
&gt;&gt;&gt; John Michel [sic] is such a crank.
&gt;&gt; The ancients had precise rules for construction with compass and
&gt;&gt; straightedge; methods for squaring the circle, trisecting the angle, and
&gt;&gt; duplicating the cube *using those rules* were long sought. There are
&gt;&gt; now rigorous mathematical proofs (based upon elementary field theory)

I repeat what Mike Ward already said: trisection of the angle by
means of compass and straightedge alone has been shown to be impossible.
There is a purely mathematical proof, as the question itself is a purely
mathematical one. Those who persist in seeking finite angle trisection
algorithms to solve this ancient problem, oblivious to the decisive
impossibility proof, are cranks. The classical angle trisection problem
has nothing whatever to do with Chartres, with Medieval (or, if Mr.
Innes prefers, &quot;medievel&quot;) cathedral builders, with the Great Pyramid,
with sacred geometry, with Lockyer, or with any of the other irrelevant
entities that Mr. Innes has bizarrely injected into the discussion in

No, it was a clarification of why most cranks' supposed &quot;solutions&quot;

neither did Mr. Innes.

No, I am not referring to anything that Neil Brennen has said, but
instead to Mr. Innes's own unsupported claim that Orwell asserted that
Zamyatin's _We_ was suppressed by the American and British governments
and banned by the latter. As we have already seen, Mr. Innes has no
identifiable source for this claim, which he has evidently misread,
misremembered, or invented outright; thus one must bear in mind that his
characterizations of what Michell believes must be greeted with caution
and skepticism.

&gt; as reproofs of why he knows shit about
&gt; geometry. Where will he go from here?
&gt;&gt; so some caution is required. I
&gt;&gt; would request a specific reference, but Mr. Innes definitely has not
&gt;&gt; been forthcoming with references supporting his claims about Orwell,
&gt;&gt; etc., so I am not too optimistic.
&gt; Mr. Webb demands proofs already given to what I have cited of Orwell

"/>

Mr. Innes has not cited *anything* pertinent of Orwell, other than a
vague reference to a letter to Moore or Rahv; my rereading of Orwell's
correspondence reveals no such letter, and Mr. Innes cannot produce the
letter's date, so he must have misread, misremembered, or invented it
outright.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and
&gt; contines to demand proofs of inventions by Brennen to which I never
&gt; subsribed.

&gt; Mr. Webb knows that both conditions are true but this is his method of
&gt; deflecting comment on geometry {!!!} by way of Brennen's understanding of
&gt; what I have said of Orwell. What crap!

As noted above, this has nothing whatever to do with Neil Brennen;
Mr. Innes himself made the claim concerning Orwell:

&gt;&gt; Mr. Innes never does so? Perhaps that's because the set of such is
&gt;&gt; empty.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I wonder, did you ever study this writer? Or maybe
&gt;&gt;&gt; Keith Crichlow [sic]?

&gt; Mr . Webb has also not heard of Critchlow [sic]

"/>

Since Mr. Innes cannot even decide whether the name is &quot;Crichlow&quot; or
&quot;Critchlow,&quot; it is not easy to guess what he may mean here (if indeed
anything intelligible). If Mr. Innes is referring to so-called &quot;sacred
geometry,&quot; then that subject has nothing to do with the classical angle
trisection problem, which as I noted above is insoluble by compass and
straightedge.

Only a curiosity concerning follies, not fillies, could prompt one to

The trouble that so many anti-Stratfordians have with even very
straightforward contemporary attributions -- the daunting difficulties
that beset the lesser Kennedy in telling Tom Reedy from Terry Ross, Mr.
Crowley's uproarious &quot;Ray Mignot&quot; exegesis, Ken Kaplan's extravagant
encomium bestowed upon a ludicrous kvetch that was quite obviously
Sobran's (and required all of about ten seconds to confirm as such), and
especially Elizabeth Weird's farcical inability even to recognize her
*own posts* -- make a mockery of their pretense to be in possession of
useful insights into attributions of texts some four centuries old.

There is certainly no implied criticism of either of you, Neil; your

This poster is not just a little disturbed. Some say his name is Neal
Brennen. Neal Brennen is a stranger from the truth.

I would venture a non-clinical, yet an advised opinion, that we have a
schizoid character here of some certain dimensions. This is no cause for
resentment as much as some care.

I do not recommend looking up the writings of Xganon by google search unless
you have a strong stomach, but Brennen under all sorts of pseudonyms seems
to compulsively need to suggest that I would have written this material
about my own family.

I am not much amused or have sympathy for by those who befriend him and then
get caught, sickened and very saddened by it all. If you want to view the
dark-boy, do the google.

Dear David,

I don't 'imagine' anything about it. Do you?

Try not to get yourself confused by the names of the objects. We are
discussing a pure activity in geometry - a construction using only compass
and straightedge.

My question was if you understood a specific construction that I described.

You have now made many posts of this subject. It's okay to say 'no' if you
can't do it. So can you?

You seem to be writing about Lockyer and tri-secting angles and have
confused yourself.

I can't be bothered to follow all the implication that you 'imagine' as a
result of this simple exchange, and if you choose to write on some
associated subject - it is your association not mine. I know that you want
to quote and cite all sorts of exciting stuff to illustrate some knowledge
and impress people.

But please note that my question is much simpler than you have thus far
grasped, and it is true that all questions cannot be answered &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;,
but this one can.

There is no need to keep reaching round the moon for a reply.

Cordially, Phil Innes

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Mr
&gt;&gt; Webb intends to indicate that what is easily achieveable [sic]
&gt;&gt; is impossible, from
&gt;&gt; a borrowed basis in mathematics. !!! :(

&gt; I repeat what Mike Ward already said: trisection of the angle by
&gt; means of compass and straightedge alone has been shown to be impossible.
&gt; There is a purely mathematical proof, as the question itself is a purely
&gt; mathematical one. Those who persist in seeking finite angle trisection
&gt; algorithms to solve this ancient problem, oblivious to the decisive
&gt; impossibility proof, are cranks. The classical angle trisection problem
&gt; has nothing whatever to do with Chartres, with Medieval (or, if Mr.
&gt; Innes prefers, &quot;medievel&quot;) cathedral builders, with the Great Pyramid,
&gt; with sacred geometry, with Lockyer, or with any of the other irrelevant
&gt; entities that Mr. Innes has bizarrely injected into the discussion in
&gt; his typically farcical name-dropping fashion (when Mr. Innes drops a
&gt; name, it is invariably damaged by the hard landing).

&gt;&gt; Not that this comment will inhibit our enthisiast [sic] for [sic]
&gt;&gt; abbrogating [sic]
&gt;&gt; all things
&gt;&gt; :)))

&gt; Does someone have an Innes-speak/English dictionary?

&gt;&gt;&gt; just as there are deeper
&gt;&gt;&gt; proofs based upon Galois theory showing that the general equation of
&gt;&gt;&gt; degree five or higher cannot be solved by radicals. A readable and
&gt;&gt;&gt; thorough textbook reference for these theorems is Jacobson's lovely
&gt;&gt;&gt; _Basic Algebra I_.

&gt;&gt; Here is a supposed proof that the great pyramids do not exist &amp;c,

&gt; No; as noted above, a solution to the classical angle trisection
&gt; problem is not needed to build pyramids. Why Mr. Innes would imagine
&gt; that it is needed (or even relevant) is indeed baffling, but since his
&gt; ignorance of mathematics is so complete as to be comparable to his
&gt; ignorance of linguistics (improbable though such a feat may seem), it is
&gt; perhaps best not to inquire too closely into his &quot;reasoning.&quot;

&gt;&gt; and that
&gt;&gt; Lockyer's sudy of astro-mathematical alignments

&gt; No; the classical problems of trisecting the angle, squaring the
&gt; circle, duplicating the cube, solving algebraic equations by radicals,
&gt; etc. are not pertinent to &quot;Lockyer's sudy of astro-mathematical
&gt; alignments.&quot;

&gt;&gt; do not indicate -according
&gt;&gt; to 'mathematics' that the Egyptian sites of antiquity did not accord to
&gt;&gt; 'as
&gt;&gt; above so below' and specifically of Orion.

&gt; Was the above supposed to be an English sentence?

&gt;&gt; What is not mathematicaly [sic] provable according to David Webb, though
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; subject be non-mathermatical - ie, a geometry, or even lingusitic [sic]
&gt;&gt; issues,

&gt; I have never expressed any views on &quot;lingusitic&quot; issues, being
&gt; neither a specialist in &quot;lingusitics&quot; nor a &quot;linguistist.&quot;

&gt;&gt; does not actually exist. :)))

&gt; No, I have only discussed mathematics: the classical problem of angle
&gt; trisection by compass and straightedge is a purely mathematical one, so
&gt; the proof that such an algorithm does not exist is perforce purely
&gt; mathematical; those who willfully disregard this simple impossibility
&gt; result and continue to seek such an algorithm are cranks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There are many ingenious ways of trisecting the angle using more than
&gt;&gt;&gt; compass and straightedge, but these algorithms do not adhere to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; ancients' rules. There are also various iterative algorithms that
&gt;&gt;&gt; converge to a solution, but these methods are also inadmissible, as the
&gt;&gt;&gt; original problems require an *exact* solution in *finitely many steps*.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Those who do not understand these matters and persist in the futile
&gt;&gt;&gt; quest for ways of solving these classic problems now known to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; insoluble are indeed cranks.

&gt;&gt; An errant Rant. Displaying nothing.

&gt; No, it was a clarification of why most cranks' supposed &quot;solutions&quot;
&gt; to the problem fail. Of course, most cranks who set out to solve the
&gt; problem do not understand a word of the above, but they are not alone --
&gt; neither did Mr. Innes.

&gt; No, I am not referring to anything that Neil Brennen has said, but
&gt; instead to Mr. Innes's own unsupported claim that Orwell asserted that
&gt; Zamyatin's _We_ was suppressed by the American and British governments
&gt; and banned by the latter. As we have already seen, Mr. Innes has no
&gt; identifiable source for this claim, which he has evidently misread,
&gt; misremembered, or invented outright; thus one must bear in mind that his
&gt; characterizations of what Michell believes must be greeted with caution
&gt; and skepticism.

&gt;&gt; as reproofs of why he knows shit about
&gt;&gt; geometry. Where will he go from here?

&gt;&gt;&gt; so some caution is required. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; would request a specific reference, but Mr. Innes definitely has not
&gt;&gt;&gt; been forthcoming with references supporting his claims about Orwell,
&gt;&gt;&gt; etc., so I am not too optimistic.

&gt;&gt; Mr. Webb demands proofs already given to what I have cited of Orwell

&gt; Mr. Innes has not cited *anything* pertinent of Orwell, other than a
&gt; vague reference to a letter to Moore or Rahv; my rereading of Orwell's
&gt; correspondence reveals no such letter, and Mr. Innes cannot produce the
&gt; letter's date, so he must have misread, misremembered, or invented it
&gt; outright.

&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; contines to demand proofs of inventions by Brennen to which I never
&gt;&gt; subsribed.

&gt;&gt; Mr. Webb knows that both conditions are true but this is his method of
&gt;&gt; deflecting comment on geometry {!!!} by way of Brennen's understanding of
&gt;&gt; what I have said of Orwell. What crap!

&gt; As noted above, this has nothing whatever to do with Neil Brennen;
&gt; Mr. Innes himself made the claim concerning Orwell:

&gt;&lt;http://groups.google.com/group/humanities.lit.authors.shakespeare/msg/98
&gt; 14afb617ce4875?dmode=source&amp;hl=en&gt;

&gt;&lt;http://groups.google.com/group/humanities.lit.authors.shakespeare/msg/d9
&gt; 58bf449e76a8c9?dmode=source&amp;hl=en&gt;

&gt;&lt;http://groups.google.com/group/humanities.lit.authors.shakespeare/msg/53
&gt; ac727eeaafe85f?dmode=source&amp;hl=en&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So I suppose that people who follows his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; construction method are too. It's an interesting way to speak of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know more than you do.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Mr. Innes never does so? Perhaps that's because the set of such is
&gt;&gt;&gt; empty.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wonder, did you ever study this writer? Or maybe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Keith Crichlow [sic]?

&gt;&gt; Mr . Webb has also not heard of Critchlow [sic]

&gt; Since Mr. Innes cannot even decide whether the name is &quot;Crichlow&quot; or
&gt;&quot;Critchlow,&quot; it is not easy to guess what he may mean here (if indeed
&gt; anything intelligible). If Mr. Innes is referring to so-called &quot;sacred
&gt; geometry,&quot; then that subject has nothing to do with the classical angle
&gt; trisection problem, which as I noted above is insoluble by compass and
&gt; straightedge.

&gt;&gt; and therefore ducks his head. He [sic]
&gt;&gt; science in this case resides in a misrepresentation by Brennan [who has
&gt;&gt; never told the truth in his life] on the literary subject of an Orwell
&gt;&gt; 'quote' - and this is club-Strat at play.

&gt;&gt; Clearly Webb knows nothing, has researched nothing, and is content with
&gt;&gt; his
&gt;&gt; ignorance on other subjects, so long as he can posture before the fillies
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; his attention,

&gt; Only a curiosity concerning follies, not fillies, could prompt one to
&gt; read Mr. Innes's unintelligible and farcically ignorant effusions, let
&gt; alone to try to decipher them; however, if one seeks follies, then there
&gt; can scarcely be a more reliable supplier of that commodity anywhere on
&gt; Usenet than Mr. Innes.

&gt;&gt; no matter how pliable these dear things are to his
&gt;&gt; attentions.

&gt;&gt; I cannot recommend this approach, nor that what supplicates itself has
&gt;&gt; any
&gt;&gt; self-confidence neither [sic].

&gt; Would a speaker of the British language please translate that last
&gt; sentence?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gangleri, Chess One, Art Neuendorffer, Elizabeth, Stephanie Caruana,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mousie, Roger Stritmatter? I don't think so. Stick to kiddie books,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they probably don't tax your mind!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thanks neil, kiddie books are informing of the early mind, and early
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning is pyschologically so much more important than late, doncha
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phil

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry Philth AKA &quot;Xganon&quot;, I'm not &quot;seaker&quot;; Lynne Kositsky addresses
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;seaker&quot; as &quot;Robert&quot;, which is hardly a nickname for &quot;Neil&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nor is seaker's style remotely similar to yours, Neil.

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Dave.... I think. :-)

&gt; There is certainly no implied criticism of either of you, Neil; your
&gt; styles are just very different.

Thank you, David, none was taken.

However, many anti-Stratfordians seem

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; to be utterly tone-deaf to stylistic nuances, so perhaps Mr. Innes's
&gt; confusion is not surprising. Indeed, confusion seems to be his steady
&gt; state.

What can we expect from a Russian translator who cannot read Cyrilic?
