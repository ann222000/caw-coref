************50 Billion************ remember?

It says: &quot;If there is a risk of casualties, that fact should be acknowledged
at the outset, rather than allowing the public to believe an engagement can
be executed antiseptically, on-the-cheap, with few casualties.&quot; What should
the public know right now about what a war with Iraq would look like and
what the costs would be?

Rumsfeld: Cost in dollars or cost in lives?

Stephanopoulos: Dollars and human costs.

Rumsfeld: Well, the lesser important is the cost in dollars. Human life is a
treasure. The Office of Management and Budget estimated it would be
something under 50 billion dollars.

Stephanopoulos: Outside estimates say up to 300 billion.

Rumsfeld: Baloney. How much of that would be paid by the United States, how
much by other countries is an open question. But if you think about it,
September 11th, besides the 3,000 lives, cost this country hundreds of
billions of dollars. So, yes, measure the risk of acting, but also the risk
of not acting. And if we suffered a biological September 11th, the cost
would just be many, many, many multiples of any conflict.

Stephanopoulos: But do you think the risk of an attack like that, another
attack on the United States is increased by taking military action against
Iraq?

Rumsfeld: It is clearly decreased, because every day that Iraq continues
with its chemical, biological, and nuclear programs, they get that much more
mature and that much closer to -- in the case of nuclear -- to his having a
nuclear weapon.

We're going to Iran:
