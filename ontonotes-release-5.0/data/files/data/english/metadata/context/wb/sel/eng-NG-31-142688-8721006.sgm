As U.S. officials touted progress, Blackwater guards killed 16

By Leila Fadel, McClatchy Newspapers

BAGHDAD - On Sept. 9 , the day before Army Gen. David Petraeus , the U.S.
military commander in Iraq , and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker told Congress
that things were getting better, Batoul Mohammed Ali Hussein came to Baghdad
for the day.

A clerk in the Iraqi customs office in Diyala province, she was in the
capital to drop off and pick up paperwork at the central office near busy al
Khilani Square, not far from the fortified Green Zone, where top U.S. and
Iraqi officials live and work. U.S. officials often pass through the square
in heavily guarded convoys on their way to other parts of Baghdad .

As Hussein walked out of the customs building, an embassy convoy of
sport-utility vehicles drove through the intersection. Blackwater security
guards, charged with protecting the diplomats, yelled at construction
workers at an unfinished building to move back. Instead, the workers threw
rocks. The guards, witnesses said, responded with gunfire, spraying the
intersection with bullets.

Hussein, who was on the opposite side of the street from the construction
site, fell to the ground, shot in the leg. As she struggled to her feet and
took a step, eyewitnesses said, a Blackwater security guard trained his
weapon on her and shot her multiple times. She died on the spot, and the
customs documents she'd held in her arms fluttered down the street.

Before the shooting stopped, four other people were killed in what would be
the beginning of eight days of violence that Iraqi officials say bolster
their argument that Blackwater should be banned from working in Iraq .

During the ensuing week, as Crocker and Petraeus told Congress that the
surge of more U.S. troops to Iraq was beginning to work and President Bush
gave a televised address in which he said &quot;ordinary life was beginning to
return&quot; to Baghdad , Blackwater security guards shot at least 43 people on
crowded Baghdad streets. At least 16 of those people died.

Two Blackwater guards died in one of the incidents, which was triggered when
a roadside bomb struck a Blackwater vehicle.
