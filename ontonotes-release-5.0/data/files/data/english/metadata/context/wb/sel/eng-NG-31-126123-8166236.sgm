Ok
Here we go..
first.. got this at an auction a week ago.. paid forty bucks.
had three or four light guage strings.. really high action..
completely filthy, rusted out tuners..
but otherwise looked kinda promising.

so..
apologise for the fuzzy pics..
I cleaned it up, lemon oil on and off twice to get the dirt out.
http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid225/p080fa2624fdf220936305b7...

you can see where the pickguard used to be and that shows the finish
wear. mostly due to sunlight I would guess.
you can't see the painted on white binding very well.. I'll have to
redo that, kinda chipped at.

and here's the headstock. It's the only one with the design on it that
I've found on the web.
you'll notice I put in a set of saga six on a side tuners while I'm
waiting for deliver of the three on a plate replacements.
funky!
http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid225/p6a3e752977f0fc44af07c33...

plastic nut by the way. will be bone soon.

and here's the back of the guitar..
http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid225/p22b44e08d4cffdb39aba36d...

it appears to be solid wood.. judging by the top wear which shows the
grain is worn into a bit.. like around the f hole where your arm
rests.. but it's very light.

the back isn't quite as dark as the shots.

and here's the bridge.
http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid225/p8cff73816971c3aa2d96577...

I removed the thumbwheels. and then shortened the screw posts that
held them so that when I put the bridge back together they wouldn't be
digging into the top of the guitar.

The neck has pulled slightly forward.. the bottom of the neck is
deeper, it slants toward the body.. this means the action was raised
and since the bridge was made wrong in the first place.. it wouldn't
go low enough.. this made it pretty useless except for slide work with
almost no fingering.
removing the thickness of the thumbwheels brought the thing to pretty
nice action.

and the neck is pretty straight, too.

The D and G strings and a bit on the A string, have some hassle with
fret buzz around fret 9 and up.. *up to where the neck angles down,
and there of course the action is high*

But this is pretty minor.. because the slots in the bridge top are too
deep for those strings.

I put a piece of paper underneath the G string for temp. playing.

Never underestimate heavier tuners, or air space.

Putting the heavier tuners on, though they are crap, improved tone and
volume.
Of course, just getting it halfway set up and being played for a few
days made a big difference there, too.
And the bridge parts didn't fit. Air space between them.. quite a bit.
Once I sanded them to fit together I became convinced that the
thumbwhell adjustment has to go forever.
I'll do a custom build on this bridge.
Probably I'll just slice a bit of the top off, replace it with a bone
piece and then intonate it
and leave it as non adjustable.

I'll also have some improvement from the nut replacement.. and getting
rid of the dead air and bone on the bridge top ought to combine with
the tuners and playing the darn thing to give me a fairly nice
sounding guitar.

I'll put heavy tuners on this.. I may even go with individual tuners
so I can get as much mass at the headstock as possible.

Keith would probably lean this thing toward slide.. an aluminum nut
and bridge would, it seems to me, combine with  this guitars bright
tone to produce a little razor blade, if you know what I mean.

But I'm going to keep costs down, and effort, as much as possible, and
see what I get once it's got better parts and decent set up.

Right now, I like it already. Save the funky fretwork.

Wish it had a truss rod. But I'm not going to straighten that neck
right now. I want to see how good it can sound and play without  it.

I'm sure a true luthier would want to remove the neck and maybe even
plane it because of the drop at the bottom of the board. But that's
expensive and this is forty bucks.

Bottom line: it's really nice not having the dreadnaught volume.. and
it's fairly well balanced tonally.. enough to make me think the fixing
up will give me something good.

I think I can keep it alive. And I think it's worth it. And though
it's not a five thousand dollar holy moly aint I the one piece. it's
pretty darn cool

I think the bone bridge top will look way spiffy and I know getting
rid of those thumbwheels was pretty dramatic.
so there you go.
I'm going to call it

The Resurection.

If anyone has any info on this thing.. please pass it along.

oh yeah
the top isn't quite right.. you can see that the carved top is not
curved smoothly anymore. it's dipped in in a couple of spots. near the
bridge. but pretty slight, really.

I'd bet this thing came with those hellacious black diamond heavy
guage strings.

again, to repair that would be very time consuming.. so it's going to
have to stay that way.
I'm not going to take off the top.

but, it really vibrates nicely all over.. and the braces are all still
full contact..

You know.. this was nice work.
No matter it's inexpensive. It really makes you kind of proud to see
an american made guitar, this old, this inexpensive, hang in for so
long with what are really nothing more than normal and expected wear.

Cool beans, Kay workers. Thanks.

and congrats to the folks who owned.. they may not have known a great
deal, but they must have liked this, and tried to keep it in good
shape.

Probably dates from the late sixties.

damn things stick to my fingers now.
I'm pretty sure it's the chemical reaction from the film and the lemon
oil.

However, I found out I can play the hell out of Trini Lopez now.

Pretty nice looking guitar Twang. I sometimes use aluminum for nuts Twang
but never felt it made the guitars bright.  Its just a good material for
transmitting the strings vibration into the guitar.  If anything I think it
makes a guitar louder. Anything directly touching the strings has a big
impact on how the guitar is going to sound. I like individual tuners
because even the cheap ones are more sturdy than the 3 on a strip tuners
I've seen.. I built a lap steel a while back and used 3 on a strip tuners.
When I swapped them for individual tuners the difference in tone and sustain
was amazing. Mass in the headstock wont do anything for you. Thats BS. I've
found that the lighter I could make a headstock then the better the guitar
sounded and sustained. IMO the individual tuners are better not for their
mass but for more sturdy shafts and the nut used to hold them down works
much better than just a push in bushing which is junk.

I was trying to go cheap and still make it ok.
I haven't even looked at any plate tuners yet.
I spose I could put a set of grover minis on it.. but I think I'll
wait to see how the fret/neck nut/bridge work pans out.
I was judging the mass improvement on comparing individ. tuners .. one
cheap and light and one heavier and more costly.
And it sure seems to make a difference to me there.
This had no bushings. man.. the post angled off with string pull and
the gears were all too tight probably since it was built.

new pics in a couple of days. and hopefully better sound, too.

thanks
gonnna do the nut today.. might even get to the bridge top.
did a bit of fret levelling last night... just spot levelled .. the
12th fret was high all across it's middle..
starting to play nice.

one thing.. very flat board. no radius I can see at all.
and thin frets..
I may get itchy and switch fret sizes. *G*
