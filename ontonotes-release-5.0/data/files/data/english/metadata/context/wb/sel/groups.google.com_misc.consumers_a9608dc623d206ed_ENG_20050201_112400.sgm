&gt;2. Their customer representative gave me wrong mailing address to send

&gt;4. After pressing 23 buttons and waiting 19 minutes, I finally got

&gt;After talking about 10 minutes, she gave me another address to send my

&gt;Whay a shame! An American tradition is gone.

"/> Yes it is, the tradition is called personal responsibility. It has long
vanished.

You say AT&amp;T overcharged you $100 to call Canada. Did they quote you one
rate and then charge you a higher rate? IF that is the case, yes, they
overcharged you. However, if you paid $1.32 a minute because you negected
to inquire about the rates, then it is YOUR fault.

Any customer who makes a long distance calls without first checking rates
is asking to be gouged.

BTW, with a little searching you should be able to call Canada for as low
as 1.9 cents a minute.

"/> For a big company such as AT&amp;T, you can find out who's in charge simply
by googling or looking on AT&amp;T's web site. I can save you the trouble
though. For months, I was receiving spam that came from one of AT&amp;T's
servers, but the userid was randomized each time. I would have gladly
filtered the spam, but I was doing a lot of consulting with people who
used AT&amp;T as their ISP and I could not risk accidentally filtering out
their email.

After a month of emails to the usual administrative contacts at AT&amp;T and
phone calls to their technical help desk, all I got was a run around, or
just simply ignored. Finally, I decided to send a snail mail letter to
AT&amp;T's CEO. The contact info took me a few minutes to find via an
Internet search. That was a wasted stamp. I finally gave one more try
and phoned a technical contact at AT&amp;T who finally took action to stop
the spamming. AT&amp;T is a worthless company and its no wonder they're on
the verge of extinction.

You may be right. But a company, who depends its business on cheating
customer, will be gone, forever.
