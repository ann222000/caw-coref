Check out the video of the Grove landing gear drop test.

Pretty impressive.  I wonder, though, what would happen to the prop in
a real landing that causes that level of gear deflection.

It would be interesting to see a simular video of a test using a gear
attached like the Eagle attachment.

I remember talking with the factory and seeing photos when they were
developing the radiused plates for the LG.  They were slamming the fuselage
down hard enough that the wheel pants were damaging the lower wing and still
no incurring any fuselage and/or structure damage.  It was very impressive
(and as I had not learned to land a plane at the time; it gave me hope the
plane would survive my efforts)

I think that is pretty similar to what the Eagle uses.

It is, Eagle has a centering plate below the gear is the only
difference.

making the gear for Eagles.  I was told that Grove recommended that
the Eagle switch to 1&quot; thick gear and the longeron cracking issue
would go away.  Aviat didn't want to deviate from the plans.  You can
see from the test why a thicker gear would help the longerons, and why
the radius plates are necessary.
