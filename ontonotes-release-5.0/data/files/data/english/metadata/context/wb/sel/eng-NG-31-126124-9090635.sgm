I am not sure if this is the right board to post this in (I also
posted in a Teen Titans board), but given the last appearance of the
character that is relevant to my question, here goes...

In reading one of the latest issues of Teen Titans, I could not help
but notice that many D.C. writers (from Batman, to Green Arrow, to
Nightwing, now Teen Titans) have written the &quot;new&quot; Jason Todd as
almost unbeatable.

When he first came back in Batman, I was willing to accept Batman's
challenge with him given the emotional surprise and ambivalence he
must have felt facing him.

However, in later issues, while watching him take out various villains
and the like, I started wondering just how formidable was he. This
became confirmed when he basically thrashed Tim Drake in a Titans
issue a few months ago. He literally beat him senseless (after a
reasonably competitive fight...for awhile).

Then when over in Nightwing, although Dick was recovering from injury,
he fought him to a standstill...in some regards getting the better of
him (twice).

He then &quot;schooled&quot; Mia over in Green Arrow even though she had just
returned from intense training with Connor and Ollie.

Finally, in the most recent Titans issue, with both Dick and Tim
holding him, he seemed to &quot;handle&quot; both a bit too easily (although Tim
got the last kick in).

My question is, have they &quot;overpowered&quot; up this new Jason Todd or is
he just that good? Seemingly a notch or so below Batman. Whereas
obviously not Tim, but could Dick take him a square fight if he had
to? In fact, I don't think I have seen him beaten (with the exception
of when the Meta twins over in Nightwing had him basically embalmed by
that creature due to his overconfidence). Or am I not reading his
character correctly.

Thoughts? - Sprtan

He's this year's Deathstroke.  Whereas Deathstroke should pretty much
have his ass handed to him by anyone with a superpower, over the last
few years he's kicked the crap out of pretty much everyone but
Superman.

Jason has been trained by both Batman and the League of Assassins, so
he's no pushover, but as Nightwing pointed out, it's only Batman's
guilt that prevents him from taking Jason down and Nightwing should be
able to take him as well, though on sheer experience alone, as Jason
is younger.

I still remember, in JT's first reappearance in &quot;Hush&quot;, Batman knows
it's not him because he fights too much like Nightwing, and &quot;Jason
never was that good&quot;. I suppose the LoA training would account for
that...Honestly, Jason *should* be able to take down Tim, as he's
older, more experienced, and always was a more physical, meaner
fighter than Tim ever was.

BTW, how old IS Todd meant to be, anyway??

Tim is smarter than Jason ever was.  That matters.

Ali beat Foreman, after all, and nobody hit harder than George Foreman.

Tim is also much smarter than Nightwing ever was, but I wouldn't bet
on him to beat Dick. Still, Tim's smarts are probably what helped him
to last as long as he did against Todd...

Very well stated...and apt comparison.  I do recall reading that post
return from death, he did train around the world with different
experts and the League of Assassins (much like Batman).

However, even if this were true, he should be no better than say
Batman was during maybe Year 2 or 3.  D.C. did a similar treatment
with Batgirl for awhile where she was literally untouchable and
unbeatable.  Since then, they seem to have powered her down a bit
making her a little less invinsible.

I am intrigued though as to how they plan to evolve him into a
redeemable character...assuming that is the plan.

i forget... how long ago was he supposed to have been &quot;back from the
dead&quot; c/o S-Prime's reality punches? 1 year ago? 2, 3? maybe 5? He had
that much time to train to be a good fighter.. because, as some people
pointed out, he wasnt that much of a fighter pre-crisis. Especially
after his retcon at the time... he used to have a virtually identical
origin as Dick Grayson (Circus acrobat whose parents where murdered...
that at least would explain his agility and strength).. but after the
retcon he's just some street punk who got caught trying to steal the
batmobile's wheels (really!!!)

So what if he was trained by the LofA? You mean the same guys who have
scores of ninjas that Batman et al regularly dispacth with ease? (Same
thing with Marvel.. you have the Hand, a secret society of Ninjas
who're supposed to be training in their martial arts something like
24-7 and get their asses kicked by any grade-c hero with a green belt
in judo)

The original poster is right... Jason Todd is severely 'over-powered'
simply because the writers (or TPTB) simply want him to be...

I mean, does anyone here even *like* the character? Even the new
firestorm and blue beetle have their fans... but Jason Todd? Hell,
fans VOTED to kill him off!! Now not only do they bring him back (w/o
asking the fans) but they decided to make him 'kewl'.

It was the reality punch that killed him.  According to the Batman
Annual he was meant to survive.

Then he came back to life soon after.

According to the wikipedia Timeline of the DCU that all occurred 5
years before &quot;One Year Later&quot;.

So, yeah, 5 to 6 years ago.  So, 4 to 5 years of training.

That scene in Titans bugged the hell out of me too. No matter if Jason
has spent a couple of years training with the League Dick should be able
to take him every day and twice on sunday. As has been noted Batman
saying in Hush that Jason was nowhere near in Dick's league. Plus Dick
regularly has to fight metas which would give him a huge tactical
advantage over Jason. And yes, I think Slade's overpowered too. Seeing
him beating 6-8 members of the Justice League without breathing hard is
hard to believe.

Batgirl is supposed to be *the* best fighter (or at least top 3) in
the DCU. I'd love to see a scene where Todd faces her and she dodges
his attack, takes one punch at him and he's out like a light.

I'd also would love to see a scene where Slade tries to do that 'im-oh-
so-cool-i-can-take-out-8-JLAers-at-once' thing again, Superman swoops
down, or Flash (the *real* Flash..not that fake moron who ran into a
waiting sword and stabbed himself) runs in at Slade at Super-speed and
disarms him, takes off all his clothes cept for his underwear and ties
him up in Supes cape/lampost/wonder woman's lasso, etc)

Thats what i miss about the silver age.. no one does that kinda thing
anymore. :-)

Or an Elseworlds Superman can just Fry him with heat vision.

Or Guy Gardner just blast him with a wide angle beam.

Or Hawman drops a net on him

Or.. aarggh!! several years after ID crisis and I STILL CANT DEAL with
those plot holes!!!

Before Brad Meltzer and DC in total decided to make Deathstroke &quot;the
shit&quot; Superman snatched his ass up before breakfast and a teenaged
Atom (remember when he was deaged) beat the crap out of him (after he
ironically poisoned Superman with kryptonite for a contract) by
hopping in his head and jumping around.

Deathstroke shouldn't be able to handle any true meta, period.  Even
back in the day it was a stretch that Wally wasn't kicking his ass
every time they met, something Marv Wolfman actually acknowledged as a
problem.

The problem with Batgirl is that she's like Connor Hawke...pretty much
the best fighter in the DCU as long as she stays in her own book but
really nothing special when she's out and about in the DCU...it's lame
but that's the kind of editing we get these days.

&gt; In reading one of the latest issues of Teen Titans, I could not help
&gt; but notice that many D.C. writers (from Batman, to Green Arrow, to
&gt; Nightwing, now Teen Titans) have written the &quot;new&quot; Jason Todd as
&gt; almost unbeatable.
">

Every Jason Todd appearance I've read since his resurrection has left
me with the resounding impression that he has superhuman strength.
Not ridiculous strength, but maybe twice human.

I don't much care if Editorial says that's not the case- it's how he's
being written.  He goes through rooms of guys effortlessly, fighting
close-in and dirty.  Every bad can take a room full of guys- Jason
takes them AND SUFFERS NO DAMAGE, and he's not using a cautious
fighting style, it's an aggressive pure-power take-and-shrug-off-
attack style.

Did Venom figure into his resurrection somewhere?  Because if not,
it's GOING TO show up at some point to explain this.  (Well, and also
to make him a more sympathetic character when it 'flushes out of his
system.')

Jason Todd's not unbeatable in the same sense Deathstroke is- but he's
CLEARLY got a a 'roidrage powerup going on.  We're not even gonna find
out what is actual personality is like until that's over.

Um, nope, the Supergirl and Slade fights happened *after* her book was
cancelled (the BoP scene happened while her book was on it's last
storyline, so I'm sure they knew it was being cancelled, but it wasn't
yet). She came just a hairsbreaths' from killing Supergirl, only
failing because of a DeM the writer pulled out of Supergirls' ass
(almost literally!), and briefly fought Slade to a standstill when she
was trying to kill him for brainwashing her in the last &quot;Every Titan
Vs. Slade&quot; storyline...

Yeah, Nightwing took her out, but she was still dazed from the drug's
antidote and unbalanced by rage, so I'm good with that.

How she's treated from here on in, probably depends on what they mean
to do with her. So you might be right. We'll see...

dcuniverse,

&quot;Hell, fans VOTED to kill him off!! Now not only do they bring him back
(w/o asking the fans) but they decided to make him 'kewl'&quot;

Sort of voted to kill him off, as it was found some time after that the
vote would have been for him to live had it not been for one voter who
had his phone hooked to a redialer and the Kill Todd number where he
left going for days.

First of all, her nearly taking out Supergirl didn't really showcase
how great she was so much as how inept Supergirl was/is...secondly,
the Titans story didn't really show her distinguishing herself at
all...many, many, many characters have been shown holding their own
against Slade or even beating him (and he's another one of these
characters whose skill level varies wildly from one appearance to the
next)...simply put, this Batgirl, as traditionally written, should be
able to hold her own against all of the Titans (on both sides) and
Slade would never have believably been able to drug her in the first
place (while I still hope they will use this cop-out excuse to redeem
the character I love, it doesn't really make sense)...BoP I'll grant
you mainly because Gail Simone, unlike most DC writers these days,
generally respects continuity...but Geoff Johns usually does this as
well and he wrote the Titans story.

More than likely they just want her out of the way...I doubt there are
any grand plans for the character though it would be nice...they were
just clearing the board for Batwoman...it may be a while before we see
her again.
