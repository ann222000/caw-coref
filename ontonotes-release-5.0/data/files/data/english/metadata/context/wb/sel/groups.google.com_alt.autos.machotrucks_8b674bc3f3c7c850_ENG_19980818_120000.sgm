I have problem and need any help that can be offered:

I have a 86 Ford Bronco II, V 6 2.9 L, 4 x 4, Auto Trans with Overdrive

The oil was changed about a week apart, and I still have the lifter noise.
(All of these events have happened in the last 2-3 weeks).

The transmission is definitely still under warranty --- and the repair on
that is a story of its own.
Quick Recap:
1st - Transmission rebuilt including the new torc converter and
plantary.
- Repair shop could not get it to go into reverse, took apart
and
discovered that one of the new bands was broken.
- Put in new band.
2nd - Picked-up Bronco - drove home and discovered that whenever I
came to a stop, the transmission acted manually. Meaning,
that
it felt jerky --- as if I was driving a manual transmission
and was
releasing the clutch without pressing on the gas enough.
AND
- Transmission was not shifting properly ----- getting stuck in
2nd ( I think)
and loser power.
3rd - Back to the shop -- Very angry and told the shop ---- &quot;You got
my
money, NOW I WANT A TRANSMISSION THAT WORKS&quot;.
4th - They opened up the transmission and discovered metal shaving
from the
torc converter. (Apparently, unbeknownst to me - that I paid
for a rebuilt
torc). So they had to replace the torc and rebuild
transmission again.
- They did and discover that transmission was still not shifting
quite right.
Finally, they replaced the modulator only after I demanded
that they do -
(they were trying to adjust the old one).
Now at this point ----- Brought home vehicle - seemed to be working
fine ----but as each day went by ---- seems to run more and more sluggish.
Sometimes it's seems okay --- but my gut feeling is ??????

Throughout this....the lifters are tapping and singing quite loudly
and continuously. I was told that when the vehicle lost power and I reeved
the engine - that this could have cause a possible failing lifter to fail.
I don't know.

At this point..... I just don't know which way to go.

The transmission shop told me to bring the Bronco back in about 10 days to
adjust transmission if needed and just to double check that things are
working fine.
I got the Bronco II back from them about a week and a half ago. So you can
see this is all very recent. Oh by the way.... this transmission shop is
highly recommended and I believe that they do good work..... BUT is it
just a my vehicle or is it them?

I was hoping that by replacing the lifters it would eliminate the noise and
Rule out whether the lifters are causing the sluggishness.

HELP HELP HELP

Thanks Karen

BUT is it just a my vehicle or is it them? &lt;-- well 86 was a bad year
for ford, especially with those bronco 2's with overdrive.
But, it sounds like your lifter noise could be the sound made when the
timing is off a few degrees......
sluggish acceleration, and noisy lifters always point me to the timing.
check it &amp; see.

If you haven't always had lifter noise than it could be something new but
as far as lifters go the 2.9 Ford had solid lifters so there will be some
noise not alot but there will definately be some.
