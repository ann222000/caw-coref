Someone (Blinky?) posted a little while ago about a picture of a house in
California which had escaped the fire while those either side were razed to
the ground.
I dunno if anyone responded with the following, but it's a possible
explanation:

http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2204471,00.html

&quot;Even as wildfires devoured whole swaths of the region, some homes in the
heart of the inferno were left intact, as if saved by a higher power. But it
wasn't the hand of God; in several cases it was the handiwork of Firebreak
Spray Systems. Firebreak is a special service offered to customers of
insurance giant American International Group - but only if they happen to
live in the wealthiest zip codes in the country. Members of the company's
Private Client Group pay an average of $19,000 to have their homes sprayed
with fire retardant. During the fires, the &quot;mobile units&quot;, racing around in
firetrucks, even extinguished fires for their clients.
One customer described a scene of modern-day Revelation. &quot;Just picture it.
You are in that raging wildfire. Smoke everywhere. Flames everywhere,&quot; he
told the Los Angeles Times. &quot;Here's a couple of guys showing up in what
looks like a firetruck who are experts trained in fighting wildfire, and
they're there specifically to protect your home.&quot;

And your home alone. &quot;There were a few instances,&quot; one of the private
firefighters told Bloomberg News, &quot;where we were spraying and the
neighbour's house went up like a candle.&quot; &quot;
