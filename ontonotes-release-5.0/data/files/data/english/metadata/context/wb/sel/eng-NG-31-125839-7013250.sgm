I'm a bit of a newbie to GPS devices but want to buy one for my car with
various bells and whistles.

What recommendations does the group have for a GPS which:
- can route around traffic problems (preferably automatically)
- can use speed camera POIs
- has a screen you can read in sunlight
- has maps that can be upgraded as new ones come out
- ideally has an FM transmitter so I can have the voice as loud as I
like
