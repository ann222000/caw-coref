COVER STORY
Credibility crisis
PARVATHI MENON

The JD(S)-BJP attempt to form a government in Karnataka two weeks after a
bitter separation is seen as a betrayal of the people's mandate.

V. SREENIVASA MURTHY

At a rally in Bangalore on October 7, against the JD(S)'s &quot;betrayal&quot;, B.S.
Yeddyurappa, BJP State president Sadananda Gowda, national general secretary

H.N. Anantha Kumar and former Irrigation Minister K.S. Eswarappa.

COALITION politics in Karnataka, currently in a serious crisis of
credibility, may yet get a fresh lease of life, with Governor Rameshwar
Thakur expected
to invite an alliance of the Janata Dal (Secular) and the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) back to power again. This is perhaps one of those rare junctures
in democratic practice when the solution to a political crisis,
constitutionally speaking, calls for a set of measures that appear to be in
conflict with
the public perception of political fair play and morality.

Unabashed political opportunism and power play from the principal actors in
the drama have, in the past few weeks, provided endless fodder for 24-hour
news
channels, which captured the sordid developments blow by blow for an
increasingly disillusioned public. The re-alliance between the JD(S) and the
BJP,
just two weeks after a bitter separation, and their joint claim to form the
government on the basis of the majority they command in a 224-member
Legislative
Assembly, is in the public perception a cynical betrayal of the people's
mandate for a stable government.

No sooner had the ink dried on the October 9 presidential proclamation
imposing President's Rule in the State than factions within the Congress,
the JD(S)
and the BJP began moves for a fresh alliance. The Assembly was placed in
suspended animation in accordance with Article 356 (3) of the Constitution,
which
lays down that dissolution must be approved by both Houses of Parliament
within 60 days of the proclamation of President's rule. The winter session
of
Parliament was to have considered the matter when it met in early November.

While the State units of the JD(S), the BJP and the Congress officially
supported the dissolution of the Assembly, legislators of these parties,
including
leaders and former Ministers, were opposed to fresh elections 20 months
ahead of schedule. Back-room negotiations commenced and factions of the
three parties
sent feelers to legislators to get the numbers required to stake a claim to
form the government.

The moves for a new grouping were fuelled by two factors. The first was the
Governor's statement in New Delhi just days after the imposition of
President's
Rule, in which he said the field was open for a fresh regrouping to stake
its claim. The second was the delay of about two weeks by the Governor in
the
appointment of advisers. In both these acts, the non-Congress parties saw
the subtle encouragement of a possible Congress-led alliance of parties that
could form the government.

The stakes in the political game are evidently the highest for the BJP and
its leader B.S. Yeddyurappa, who did not hide his devastation at the
last-minute
refusal of the JD(S) to hand over power to the party, denying him the chance
of becoming the first Chief Minister of the first BJP government in the
South.
Yeddyurappa never hid his over-weaning desire for chief ministership when he
was Deputy Chief Minister in the H.D. Kumaraswamy-led government.

The BJP decided to cash in on a strong sympathy factor created by the
JD(S)'s refusal to abide by the agreement that bound the coalition. On
October 7,
the party took out a large procession, which culminated in a protest rally
in Bangalore, at the Gandhi Statue in the central district of the city,
where
BJP leaders fulminated against the &quot;betrayal&quot;.

Following Kumaraswamy's resignation on October 8, the BJP launched a
Dharmayudha Yatra, comprising processions, rallies and demonstrations, to be
held in
all district centres. The Yatra was to culminate in another protest rally in
Bangalore on November 5. &quot;Vachana Bhrashta&quot; (breaker of promises) was the
epithet the BJP coined to describe Kumaraswamy.

The JD(S) put up its own defence – though a less spirited performance – of
the decision not to transfer power to the BJP. Kumaraswamy and his father,
the
national president of the JD(S) H.D. Deve Gowda, went on a media offensive
against the BJP. Their main contention was that the BJP was trying to
convert
the State into a &quot;Hindutva laboratory&quot;, a claim that hit a sympathetic
chord, coming as it did when a sting operation by Tehelka magazine had
unmasked
details of how the Sangh Parivar planned the 2002 riots in Gujarat aided by
a sympathetic BJP regime.

To counter the Dharmayudha Yatra, Kumaraswamy and Merajuddin Patel, State
president of the JD(S), called a Vilasa Yatra, a 1,000-km-long padayatra
from
Kudala Sangama in Bijapur district in the north to M.M. Hills in
Chamarajanagar district in the south, during which the leaders planned to
counter the
BJP campaign against them.

However, they soon called off the plan and instead the party took out
full-page advertisements in local newspapers, in which it explained the
reasons for
not handing over power to the BJP.

In the 18 days between October 9, when the State came under President's
Rule, and October 27, when the JD(S) and the BJP went to the Governor armed
with
letters from 129 legislators staking their claim to form the government,
feverish behind-the-scenes negotiations and deal-cutting took place among
party
factions.

A few days into President's Rule and there was intense speculation, which
found its way into the media, of a possible Congress-JD(S) realignment with
the
blessings of the central Congress leadership. Several Congress leaders in
the State hinted at the possibility, with M.V. Rajashekharan, Union Minister
of State for Planning, even stating on October 13 in Mysore that a secular
government could be formed soon in the State. He expressed his willingness
to
head such a formation if asked. The State leadership of the party had to
issue a statement asking its leaders to desist from making statements on
government
formation.

Both Kumarswamy and Deve Gowda refuted the rumours of a JD(S)-Congress
tie-up as false. In an interview to Frontline, Deve Gowda spoke emphatically
against
any alliance with either the Congress or the BJP, and, in fact, expressed
his desire to forge ties with his erstwhile allies, the Left parties.

Indeed, Deve Gowda further set at rest speculation that he was seeking a
rapprochement with the Congress through a letter he sent on October 24 to
President
Pratibha Patil, Governor Rameshwar Thakur, Congress president Sonia Gandhi
and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. In the letter he sought speedy
dissolution
of the Karnataka Assembly, arguing that a prolonged state of suspended
animation would encourage &quot;horse-trading&quot;. He called for fresh elections as
soon
as possible.

The next serious attempt at government formation was made by former State
Home Minister M.P. Prakash, who left for Delhi on October 23 with about 14
legislators
to meet the central Congress leadership and explore the possibility of an
alliance with the Congress.

He met Home Minister Shivraj Patil, treasurer of the All India Congress
Committee Motilal Vohra, and Minister of State in the Prime Minister's
Office Prithviraj
Chauhan, among others. He reportedly told the Congress leadership that in
addition to the 15 legislators who were with him, he could get the support
of
another 16, thus taking his support base to 31.

Prakash's initiative took the JD(S) leadership by surprise. Unclear and yet
suspicious of Prakash's game plan, Kumaraswamy and Deve Gowda gave it their
reluctant nod in the interest of party unity, as it appeared that Prakash's
move had substantial support amongst JD(S) legislators, who were desperate
to avoid elections. Had he firmed up an alliance with the Congress, he would
have got even more legislators to his side.

Indeed, after initial hesitation, Kumaraswamy went public saying that the
entire JD(S) contingent would support Prakash if he could swing a coalition
arrangement
in which the Congress supported Prakash as Chief Minister. A buoyed Prakash
left for New Delhi again on October 26 to meet Congress leader Ahmed Patel
and firm up such an alliance.

His undoing was his meeting on October 26, prior to his departure for New
Delhi, with Siddaramaiah, Deputy Chief Minister for a time in the first
coalition
headed by N. Dharam Singh, who left the JD(S) to join the Congress after a
bitter rift with Deve Gowda.

The meeting fuelled the rumours that had been doing the rounds in Bangalore
for several days of large-scale pay-offs by a group of Congress leaders to
JD(S)
legislators in return for support for a new JD(S)-Congress combine that
would exclude Deve Gowda, his family and supporters.

K. BHAGYA PRAKASH

JD(S) leader M.P. Prakash addressing the media with his supporters at his
residence in Bangalore on October 16. He made two trips to New Delhi in four
days to explore the possibility of an alliance with the Congress.

Events moved swiftly after that. According to JD(S) sources, a group of 12
legislators were taken by an anti-Deve Gowda group of Congress moneybags to
a
resort near Bangalore where they were promised ministerial berths and
astronomical bribes if they broke from the party.

Getting wind of this from a loyalist within the group late in the night, and
fearing that the blandishments offered by the Congress group would result in
an exodus from his party, Kumaraswamy did a repeat performance of his
February 2006 act. He called up Yeddyurappa and asked for his hand in
forming yet
another – this time &quot;unconditional&quot; – alliance.

Yeddyurappa and the BJP leadership immediately called off the Dharmayudha
Yatra to reconcile and reunite with the party that had been at the receiving
end
of their vitriolic campaign. The very next day, October 27, the two parties
submitted to the Governor individual letters signed by 129 legislators
staking
their claim to form the government under the leadership of Yeddyurappa.

&quot;To save my party&quot;

Kumaraswamy went on another media offensive, this time even less convincing
than on the previous occasion. &quot;I did it to save my party&quot; was the burden of
his song. The Congress was out to break the JD(S) by luring away his
legislators and he was only protecting his party, he said.

As if to prove the reality of this threat, Kumaraswamy moved his flock of
legislators from one luxury resort to another in order to keep them away
from
the reach of those who could allegedly win them over with more attractive
blandishments.

None of the three parties has emerged from this crisis unscathed. For the
JD(S), which has handed over the government to the first communal party to
come
to power in Karnataka, the stain of opportunism and doublespeak will not be
easy to erase. The shifting statements of party leaders carry little
credibility.
For instance, while Kumaraswamy and Merajuddin Patel went on record saying
that their support to the BJP was &quot;unconditional&quot;, on November 1 Deve Gowda
put forward a set of 12 fresh &quot;conditions&quot; that he said must form the
written bedrock of the new arrangement.

Only until Lok Sabha polls

G.P. SAMPATH KUMAR

Congress leaders wait at the Raj Bhavan to meet the Governor on October 8,
the day H.D. Kumaraswamy resigned as Chief Minister.

In these are included the &quot;condition&quot; that the duration of the coalition
will last only until the next Lok Sabha elections. The other conditions
relate
mainly to sharing of portfolios and to coalition conduct. At the same time,
Deve Gowda also said that he would not withdraw, and that he continued to
stand
by, his letter of October 24 to the President calling for the dissolution of
the House and fresh elections.

The main reason that Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy gave for not transferring
power to the BJP on October 9 was the fear that the BJP would turn the State
into
a &quot;Hindutva laboratory&quot;. The threat of that happening now seems to have
receded for them.

A euphoric BJP, which sees power finally within its reach, has been in
permanent Dharmayudha mode since October 7. Once the deal was made, the
campaign
against the &quot;treachery&quot; of the JD(S) (this did not prevent Yeddyurappa from
rushing back to Bangalore by helicopter from Tumkur on the day the campaign
was inaugurated when he was told of a possible patch-up with the JD-S)
quickly re-focussed its energies on a new slogan, namely, the &quot;defence of
democracy&quot;.

Anticipating the imminent dissolution of the Assembly, the party had hoped
to turn to its electoral advantage the public sympathy generated by the
denial
of power to it by the JD(S). It was for this reason that the Dharmayudha was
launched. The BJP leaders needed no persuasion to recreate the old alliance
that they had so vehemently discredited. Now that the party has allied
itself with the object of its public ridicule campaign, whatever little
sympathy
it had may well evaporate.

The Congress, too, must bear a good measure of responsibility for bringing
the BJP to power by its refusal to distance itself from back-door
negotiations
to form the government. There was an evident lack of communication between
the central leadership, which entertained overtures from the JD(S), and the
State leadership, which appeared to be in the dark about the negotiations
with the high command.

Finally, it was the attempt to split the JD(S) by a group of second-rung
State Congress leaders with large coffers of money, which came largely from
the
real estate sector, that pushed the JD(S) leadership once again into the
BJP's embrace. Constitutional correctness demands that the Governor invite
the
party or coalition that has the numbers to form the government. Politically
opportunist the JD(S)-BJP re-marriage may be, but denying the alliance the
right to form the government will plunge the State into yet another crisis.

12 'commandments'
V. SREENIVASA MURTHY

H.D. Deve Gowda, JD(S) chief.

AFTER the assurance of &quot;unconditional&quot; support from former Chief Minister
H.D. Kumaraswamy and Merajuddin Patel, State president of the JD(S), the BJP
was
in for a rude shock on November 1 when H.D. Deve Gowda, national president
of the JD(S), presented it with a list of 12 conditions. These, he says,
must
form the basis of a written understanding with the BJP in a future
coalition.

1. The post of Chief Minister shall be given to B.S. Yeddyurappa.

2. The post of Deputy Chief Minister shall be reserved for a JD(S) nominee.

3. The portfolios and the list of Ministers shall be finalised in
consultation with the JD(S). (The number of Cabinet positions and the number
of Ministers
of State for each party shall be finalised later.)

4. The government shall provide protection to the minorities, the Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.

5. In the event of any Minister or legislator having a grievance, it shall
be routed through their respective party heads for redress.

6. The coordination committee shall be presided over by H.D. Kumaraswamy.

7. The strength of the coordination committee shall be decided by the heads
of both parties.

8. The presidents and leaders of both parties shall refrain from airing
allegations.

9. Important administrative postings and appointments shall be made in
consultation with the JD(S). The same rule shall apply in the appointment of
the
Advocate-General and other law officers.

10. No Cabinet decisions with regard to ongoing development projects shall
be altered.

11. The State government shall recommend dissolution of the Assembly along
with elections to the Lok Sabha.

12. In the event of any significant departure from the understanding (and
that which cannot be resolved) both parties will have the liberty to
withdraw
support.

'My time has now come'
R.V. MOORTHY

B.S. Yeddyurappa: &quot;I will provide good administration.&quot;

HAVING won back the support of the Janata Dal (Secular), which had pipped
him at the post a few weeks ago, B.S. Yeddyurappa is now a happy man. But he
has
apparently decided to maintain a low profile, in view of the manner in which
Governor Rameshwar Thakur has been dilly-dallying in sending across what has
been described as a factual report to President Pratibha Patil that could
prompt her to revoke President's Rule. The Governor has stated that the ball
is not in his court and that he will act according to constitutional
guidelines once he receives the presidential directions.

After parading 129 legislators before the Governor, the BJP had waited for
nearly a week to obtain a favourable decision from him about government
formation
when Frontline met Yeddyurappa. In a brief chat, the Chief
Minister-in-waiting said he was confident of good support from the JD(S) and
that the two coalition
partners would together provide a people-friendly government over the next
19 months. &quot;It was Kumaraswamy and me who finalised the initial
understanding
between the two parties. We have a good relationship and there should be no
cause for any worry,&quot; he said, adding that the Congress has been working
overtime
to prevent the formation of a BJP-led government. &quot;Whatever the Congress may
say, the people of Karnataka are fully aware of all that has happened on the
political front over the past month and there will be a fitting reply if
anything adverse takes place,&quot; he said.

Asked on the 12-point condition sought to be imposed by H.D. Deve Gowda,
former Prime Minister and the national president of the JD(S), Yeddyurappa
said
further discussions relating to the agreement would be held between the
BJP's central leaders and Deve Gowda. &quot;We have just crossed the first stage
in
government formation. After the Governor's invitation to form the government
we will start the second stage of discussions. There will always be a give
and take and both parties will have a good and transparent understanding. I
do not want to talk anything more on this subject at the present juncture,&quot;
he said.

Among the conditions that he has sought to impose, Deve Gowda has asked for
the post of chairman of the coordination committee of the two parties for
his
son and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy. Significantly, the
coordination committee of the JD(S) and the BJP had not met for the last
seven months
of the Kumaraswamy government and this led to the differences between the
two parties. Despite the BJP's constant reminder, the then convener of the
committee
and former Home Minister M.P. Prakash did not call a meeting of the
coordination committee, apparently acting on directions from the Janata Dal
(S) leadership.

Yeddyurappa, who had embarked on a pilgrimage in the wake of the crisis,
said he was confident from the very beginning that the JD(S) would return to
extend
support to the BJP. &quot;My time has now come. My confidence stems from the
blessings of God and the people of Karnataka. What should have happened
about a
month ago will now be completed. Let there be no worry. I will provide a
good administration and ensure that the image of the State is better than
what
it has been. I will do the people proud and take care of all sections of
society,&quot; he said.

'Why all this drama?'
K. GOPINATHAN

The present understanding between the BJP and the JD(S) is an unholy
alliance, says Mallikarjuna Kharge, State Congress president.

THE Karnataka unit of the Congress is in a fix over the decision of the
Janata Dal (Secular) to opt again for an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata
Party
(BJP) to form the government in the State. This alliance is expected to have
been borne out of an open understanding between the two parties unlike the
January 2006 secret pact between H.D. Kumaraswamy of the JD(S) and the Chief
Minister-in-waiting, B.S. Yeddyurappa, of the BJP.

It is common knowledge that a section of the Congress leaders in Karnataka
had made a desperate attempt to woo a major section of the JD(S) legislators
to form the government. But the official version of the Congress is that
right from day one of the political crisis in Karnataka, when the JD(S)
refused
to hand over charge to the BJP, it has been keen on the dissolution of the
12th Legislative Assembly to pave the way for a fresh mandate.

The Congress is keen that the State, which has been under President's Rule
since October 9, should continue to be so until the elections. It feels that
since considerable acrimony had pushed the JD(S) and the BJP apart, they
cannot provide a stable government. The 12-point &quot;dictum&quot; laid out by the
former
Prime Minister and national president of the JD(S), H.D. Deve Gowda, to
extend support to the BJP has come about as a morale booster to the
Congress, which
believes that the BJP will never approve the conditions.

Speaking to Frontline, M. Mallikarjuna Kharge, president of the Karnataka
Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), said the present alliance between the BJP
and
the JD(S) was nothing but an unholy alliance. &quot;They have come together for
the sake of power and this has been visible from the very outset. Hence we
will
oppose this alliance tooth and nail,&quot; he said.

He said it was improper to compare the present political situation in
Karnataka with that in 1989, when the late S.R. Bommai sought to prove his
majority
on the floor of the legislature, or that in 2005 when Nitish Kumar wanted to
be invited to form the government in Bihar. Hence the judgments of the
Supreme
Court in the S.R. Bommai case in 1994 and the Bihar case in 2005 cannot be
applied here, according to him.

Here, Kharge said, two parties which had fought bitterly for several weeks,
accusing each other of cheating and foul play, had come together merely for
the sake of power. He said the media advertisements given by the JD(S) over
the past fortnight would vouch for that. &quot;They poured out all their venom
against
the BJP in the advertisements and explained why power was not transferred to
the BJP. By any yardstick they cannot provide a stable government. The
Karnataka
Congress party and the party's central leader in charge of the State,
Prithviraj Chauhan, have been pressing on this point to the Governor,&quot; he
said.

Kharge's poser is if the JD(S) was keen on continuing its alliance with the
BJP why then did it pull out of the relationship in the first place. He said
Kumaraswamy should have handed over charge to the BJP on October 2, as
reportedly agreed to by the two parties 20 months ago when they formed the
government.
&quot;Why all this drama? It is quite obvious that the two parties do not see eye
to eye and in the fitness of things would it be right for the Governor to
invite them to form the government? I am confident that the Governor, who is
a stickler for constitutional guidelines, will not invite them,&quot; he said.

He said the interests of the State would be served best by opting for
elections. Both the Congress and the BJP had told Governor Rameshwar Thakur
over three
weeks ago that they were interested in the dissolution of the Assembly and
the holding of elections.

On the BJP-JD(S) producing 129 legislators before the Governor in their
quest to form the government, the KPCC president said it spoke of the
horse-trading
that was going on. &quot;They blame the Congress for indulging in horse-trading.
The fact is that these two parties have indulged in horse-trading. Why
should
a political party opt to keep its legislators at a secret location – a
resort? They did so apparently to prevent their legislators from crossing
over to
another political formation and to ensure that the legislators went by the
dictates of the party leadership,&quot; he said.

Bellary billionaires
&quot;HORSE-TRADING&quot; has been an allegation that rival political parties have
levelled against each other in the current crisis. Although direct evidence
of
monetary pay-offs to legislators is virtually impossible to marshal, such
pay-offs are a practice many politicians will attest to off the record.
Indeed,
the allegations of &quot;horse-trading&quot; have been used by commentators to bolster
their arguments in favour of dissolution of the Assembly.

In the 1970s and the 1980s, the 'excise lobby' was a major source of funding
for political parties and individual politicians. However, since the early
1990s, and alongside economic liberalisation, two new sources of political
funding/corruption have been the real estate and iron-ore mining sectors.
Bangalore's
growth as a high-tech city has resulted in a real-estate boom, with land
developers – several of them with direct political interests – acquiring
land
at throwaway prices in the city's rural hinterland. These areas have now
been opened up for information technology (IT) parks, residential layouts
and
commercial projects. The land mafia is believed to be the source of much of
the slush money in circulation for political parties to use.

A measure of the extent of land-grabbing and speculation on land has been
provided by the A.T. Ramaswamy Committee, which was a Joint House Committee
set
up in June 2006 to inquire into cases of encroachment on government land. It
submitted its first interim report in December 2006 and the second one in
July 2007.

The committee called the city &quot;a haven for land-grabbers&quot; where the
&quot;administrative machinery has utterly failed to take any action against the
land-grabbers
and their official abettors and promoters&quot;. Land in Bangalore, the report
says, is valued at Rs.46 crore an acre, and on its outskirts at Rs.1 to 4
crore
an acre. As in May 2007, around 30,000 acres in the Bangalore Urban district
had been encroached upon, according to the report.

The nexus between mining and political funding is clearer, as several
iron-ore billionaires from Bellary are legislators in the Congress, the
JD(S) and
the BJP. The opening up of mines to private entities in 1999 was followed by
a sudden surge in the international price of iron ore – from $17 a tonne in
2000-2001 to $55 a tonne in 2005-06. Nearly a quarter of India's iron ore is
located in Bellary and the adjoining regions, and the value of the ore
excavated
was Rs.3,500 crore in 2005.

Driven by a voracious Chinese demand for ore, India is now the third largest
exporter of iron ore in the world after Australia and Brazil (Frontline,
June
16, 2006). The Bellary billionaires, it is believed, have invested hugely in
funds for election campaigns and also in bribes and pay-offs.

'The ideology is only in speeches'
RAVI SHARMA

Interview with former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy.

AIJAZ RAHI/AP

H. D. Kumaraswamy: &quot;You can't trust anybody in politics today.&quot;

IN October, Karnataka was mired in political shenanigans and uncertainties.
With the transfer of power from the Janata Dal (Secular) to its coalition
partner,
the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), not taking off, hell broke loose as the
political parties and their leaders tried every trick to cobble together a
government.
The person at the centre of the turmoil, former Chief Minister H.D.
Kumaraswamy, spoke to Frontline on the issues involved. Excerpts:

The transfer of power to the BJP did not go off smoothly. The popular
perception is that while you wanted to transfer power, your family,
especially your
father [former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda], stopped you. Was this a
mistake?

Though everybody thinks so, it was not my family that stopped power being
transferred. On the night of October 1, I called a meeting of JD(S)
legislators
and asked them to express freely their feelings and opinions on the
situation and said that I wanted their permission to resign. I told them not
to be
afraid of my father and said I would convince him [on the decision to
transfer power]. But all the MLAs said, &quot;You must continue, considering the
incidents
that have taken place over the last 15 days.&quot; They cited the violence at
[Tamil Nadu Chief Minister] M. Karunanidhi's daughter's house in Bangalore,
the
burning of a bus and the death of two people who were on the bus. They said
that without discussing these issues there was no necessity to transfer
power.

As for the attack on Karunanidhi's daughter's house by Bajrang Dal and the
RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh] youth, I know that these people are not in
the hands of BJP leaders. These leaders are in the hands of these youth.
During my tenure, two or three communal clashes took place near Mangalore,
and
at that time also these [BJP] leaders were helpless. They do not have the
capacity to control these boys.

You are saying the BJP's refusal to hold talks prevented you from
transferring power?

Yes. On September 30, Yashwant Sinha (the BJP's point man for Karnataka)
came to Bangalore. We had not invited him but he came and met my father at 2
a.m.
for almost two hours. Even then my father said he wanted to hand over power
provided three or four issues were discussed; like the Nandi Infrastructure
Corridor Enterprises expressway project, over which my BJP friends had
boycotted a Cabinet meeting for nearly six hours, forcing me to remove that
subject.
I bent to their pressure.

My father also wanted clarifications from BJP leaders in Delhi as to why the
BJP supported and encouraged the MLC G. Janardhana Reddy when he made
charges
against me, and over the Bababudangiri-Datta Peetha issue.

My father said that before power was transferred, BJP leaders L.K. Advani,
Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, H.N. Ananth Kumar and [former Deputy Chief
Minister]

B.S. Yeddyurappa should first discuss with him, JD(S) leader M.P. Prakash
and myself these issues.

Sinha promised my father that he would go back to Delhi and the meeting
would be convened. But he stayed on in Bangalore. And the BJP said it was
not necessary
to discuss anything. On October 5, I sent my friend N. Cheluvarayaswamy
(former Transport Minister) to speak to Yeddyurappa, but even he said, &quot;no
question
of talks, please send your resignation&quot;. Even BJP leader M. Venkaiah Naidu
came to Bangalore, attacked us and said &quot;no more talks&quot;.

Considering the bitterness between the two parties, what future does a
coalition government have?

The way in which I ran the government for 20 months, giving even the common
man, who normally cannot meet even a panchayat member, the opportunity to
come
and meet me with his problems, gives me the confidence that I can win over
the people's hearts.

But all the bitterness...

Yes, we discussed some issues with the BJP leaders [in Delhi] and decided to
continue our arrangement in Karnataka.

Yes, but Deve Gowda has raised some issues in the form of a memorandum that
the two parties have to sign. These issues could cause problems since the
BJP
has said that the JD(S)'s support is unconditional.

No. Only with some conditions did my father agree to give support to the
BJP. Even when Yeddyurappa met my father all these issues were narrated. But
I'm
not bothered about these issues, nor about the allegations made against me
by some BJP leaders. People feel that the tenure of this Assembly should not
be curtailed and it should run its full term [until May 2009].

People meaning legislators?

Yes. Legislators of all parties are afraid of facing the electorate. With
this in mind some of our legislators wanted to go with the Congress. But I
advised
them against it, since going with the Congress will affect the JD(S). During
the [standoff] between the JD(S) and the BJP, the Congress tried to
destabilise
our party. It started pressuring our MLAs by offering inducements, including
Rs.10 crore for each of them. To save the party, I requested my father to
allow us to form the government with the BJP. And he had no hesitation.

What about his ideology to shun the communal BJP?

There is no compromise on his ideology. That is why he wrote to Rajnath
Singh regarding the protection of minorities, backward classes and Dalits.
Anyway,
on communalism, I have no faith in what political parties profess. In public
meetings all of them profess an ideology but the lack of its implementation
has been demonstrated over the past 50 years. The ideology is only in
speeches.

Even the BJP did not implement its communal ideology when it ran the
government at the Centre for five years. Political parties only publicly
discuss ideology
to win people's votes.

Politicians from the undivided Janata Dal who gravitated to the Congress
were pushing for a JD(S)-Congress coalition. Is this why Prakash went down
this
route?

I don't want to blame Prakash. Our legislators want to form a government
with anybody and avoid early elections. That is why Prakash moved with some
Congress
leaders in Delhi. Some Congress leaders from Karnataka spread the news that
the Congress was ready to form a government with the JD(S) but without Deve
Gowda and his family. That hastened us to go to the BJP. Even the BJP has
been stating publicly that they are ready for polls but privately they are
moving
with us. Even some RSS functionaries have been contacting us every day and
requesting that we form the government with the BJP.

In Karnataka, the Congress is your enemy?

Ever since the 2004 elections, even though they took our support they have
been trying to split the JD(S). They first won over Siddaramaiah and a few
MLAs
who went with him. They have still not stopped. The Congress wants to weaken
us and gain strength. Today the main decisions in the Congress in Karnataka
are taken by former Janata Dal leaders like Siddaramaiah, Ramesh Kumar, V.S.
Ugrappa, R. Jalappa and C.M. Ebrahim. The Congress is now a divided house.

But you would have still formed a government with the Congress if it had
acted faster?

If they genuinely wanted to form a government with our party, that could
have happened.

The electorate is disgusted with the tamasha that has been enacted. Is it
not better to go in for elections?

Personally, I'm totally disgusted with the incidents that took place. I'm
totally hurt by both my BJP friends and also my own party. Personally, I
wanted
to hand over charge, but circumstances forced me to go against my
conscience.

Can you trust the BJP?

Today in politics you can't trust anybody because everybody takes decisions
to get themselves benefits and personal gains. The BJP was not in a position
to get power in Karnataka even in the next 50 years, but I have given it
support. Of course, it is only with the BJP's help that I became Chief
Minister.
The way their leaders reacted after their MLA Janardhana Reddy directly
accused me of involvement in a Rs.150-crore scam made me lose faith in the
word
trust. Today, in politics, trust is a meaningless word.

The BJP has accused you of breaking a promise, and called you a Vachana
Bhrashta.

The BJP, before coming to power at the Centre in 1999, promised the country
that it would build the Ram temple at Ayodhya. It also showed a few bricks
and
collected over a thousand crore rupees. But even after running the
government for five years it did not fulfil that promise.

Again, Kalyan Singh, as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, promised the
court that his government would protect the Babri Masjid. But he failed to
keep
that promise. Compared with those promises, I only made a promise to one
man,Yeddyurappa.

Governor's choice
V. VENKATESAN
in New Delhi

The recommendation of President's Rule in Karnataka has put the federal
spirit under test.

V. SREENIVASA MURTHY

Karnataka Governor Rameshwar Thakur.

WITH the Indian electorate repeatedly delivering fractured mandates in a
number of States, and in Parliament, the phenomenon of hung legislatures,
with
the resultant dilemma of who should be invited to form the government, has
long demanded constitutional solutions that are in sync with representative
democracy. At the Centre, such a dilemma has been addressed differently as
there is no constitutional provision for imposing President's Rule or for
keeping
Parliament in suspended animation. If a Central government is reduced to a
minority it continues in power until an alternative government, which
commands
the confidence of the Lok Sabha, is formed. Alternatively, the outgoing
Ministry remains in office as a caretaker Ministry until fresh elections are
held,
following the dissolution of the Lok Sabha by the President.

Indian democracy has failed to build similar conventions in the States. If a
ruling party or a combination of parties in power loses its majority in the
Assembly, it is always interpreted as an indication that a situation has
arisen in which the government cannot function in accordance with the
provisions
of the Constitution, thereby enabling the President to assume the functions
of the State government through a Proclamation under Article 356.

On October 9, the Centre decided to impose President's Rule in Karnataka and
keep the State Assembly in suspended animation following the resignation of
Janata Dal (S) Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, whose government had lost
its majority following the withdrawal of support by its coalition partner,
the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). With all the three major political parties in
the State demanding President's Rule and the holding of fresh elections,
Governor
Rameshwar Thakur probably believed he had no option but to recommend
President's Rule. If a similar situation at the Centre is to be taken as a
model of
analogy, the Governor ought not to have recommended President's Rule but
advised Kumaraswamy to continue until alternative arrangements were made,
whether
it was an invitation to another chief ministerial aspirant who could
reasonably convince him that he could command the confidence of the House or
fresh
elections.

Clearly, the denial of the courtesy – usually extended to an outgoing Prime
Minister – of being asked to continue in power to an outgoing Chief Minister
is an affront to the federal spirit. Whereas an outgoing Prime Minister is
not suspected of misusing the office if allowed to continue in power, such
suspicion
is allowed to be entertained with regard to an outgoing Chief Minister.
President's Rule is considered a remedy to such hypothetical abuse of power,
rather
than to any real failure of the constitutional machinery, as required under
the Constitution. However, none of the stakeholders has any qualms about
this
abuse of Article 356.

Having chosen to follow a wrong precedent, repeatedly set by several
Governors in different States, Rameshwar Thakur found himself in a dilemma
when the
Janata Dal (S) decided on October 26 to support the BJP to form the next
government and gave him the requisite letter of support to facilitate the
formation
of the government. The BJP staked its claim on October 27 and paraded the
supporting Members of the Legisalative Assembly, numbering 126 (13 more than
the half-way mark in the 225-member Assembly) before the Governor on October
29.

As the Frontline issue goes to press, the Centre is reportedly examining two
options. One is rescinding President's Rule to pave the way for the
formation
of a government in the State. The other is to accept the Governor's report
to the President, which, according to media reports, is in favour of
continuance
of President's Rule. The Governor is believed to hold the view that giving
another chance to the BJP-Janata Dal (S) will lead to political instability.
Whatever the outcome, the issues involved in this controversy need to be
examined in the light of the apex court's judgments.

The Supreme Court's judgments in S.R. Bommai v Union of India (1994) and
Rameshwar Prasad v Union of India (2006) have dealt with such situations. In
both
the cases, the Court laid down detailed guidelines to be followed by the
Governor and the Centre.

In the S.R. Bommai case, the Supreme Court dealt with the case of dismissal
of six State governments – in Karnataka, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Madhya
Pradesh,
Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. The cases of Karnataka, Meghalaya and
Nagaland were similar in that in all these States the incumbent governments
were
dismissed and President's Rule was imposed on the basis of the Governors'
satisfaction that the governments had lost the majority support in the
respective
Assemblies, without giving them an opportunity for a floor test. The Court
held the proclamation of President's Rule in these States unconstitutional
because
in each of these States, the Governor hastily recommended exercise of power
under Article 356. Ironically, S.R. Bommai, who passed away on October 9,
was
the main petitioner in the case, having been dismissed from the office of
Chief Minister in 1989. (In a strange coincidence, Sarkaria also passed away
on October 9.)

K. MURALI KUMAR

S.R. Bommai, former Chief Minister, who challenged his dismissal in 1989.

Although the Court could not revive the dissolved Assemblies and the
dismissed governments as Assembly elections had taken place subsequently,
all parties
to the case requested the Court to express itself on all the issues arising
from these cases so that the principles enunciated by the Court could serve
as guidelines for the future.

The BJP-led governments of Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan
were dismissed and President's Rule was imposed on the States following the
demolition
of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992. The Supreme Court justified the
proclamation of President's Rule in these States on the grounds that any
profession
and action which went counter to secularism were prima facie proof of
conduct in defiance of the provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, it
could not
be argued that there was no material before him [the President] to come to
the conclusion that the governments in the three States could not be carried
on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, it held.

The Bommai judgment was delivered by a nine-Judge Bench. Paragraph 82 of the
judgment quotes the Sarkaria Commission Report on Centre-State Relations
(1988),
which illustrates the situations that may not amount to failure of the
constitutional machinery in a State inviting the presidential power under
Article
356(1), and where the use of the said power would be improper. One such
situation is where a Ministry resigns, or is dismissed on losing its
majority support
in the Assembly, and the Governor recommends President's Rule without
exploring the possibility of installing an alternative government enjoying
such support
or ordering fresh elections. The report also states that the use of the
power under Article 356 to sort out internal differences or intra-party
problems
of the ruling party would not be constitutionally correct. The Bench had no
hesitation in concurring broadly with the above illustrative occasions where
the exercise of power under Article 356(1) would be improper and uncalled
for.

In paragraph 120 of the judgment, the Bench said: &quot;What is to be ascertained
is whether the Governor had proceeded legally and explored all possibilities
of ensuring a constitutional government in the State before reporting that
the constitutional machinery had broken down. Even if this meant installing
the government belonging to a minority party, the Governor was duty-bound to
opt for it so long as the government could enjoy the confidence of the
House.&quot;

Karnataka 2007 is different in the sense that the Governor recommended
President's Rule as none of the parties was willing to form a government in
the aftermath
of the resignation of the Janata Dal (S) government.

Even here, the Sarkaria Commission Report – which the Bench judging the
Bommai case said merited serious consideration – said in Paragraph
6.8.04(a): &quot;In
a situation of political breakdown, the Governor should explore all
possibilities for having a government enjoying majority support in the
Assembly. If
it is not possible for such a government to be installed and if fresh
elections can be held without avoidable delay, he should ask the outgoing
Ministry,
if there is one, to continue as a caretaker government, provided the
Ministry was defeated solely on a major policy issue, unconnected with any
allegations
of maladministration or corruption, and is agreeable to continue. The
Governor should then dissolve the Legislative Assembly, leaving the
resolution of
the constitutional crisis to the electorate. During the interim period, the
caretaker government should be allowed to function. If the important
ingredients
described above are absent, it would not be proper for the Governor to
dissolve the Assembly and install a caretaker government. The Governor
should recommend
proclamation of President's Rule without dissolving the Assembly.&quot;

In the Bommai judgment, the Court also endorsed the unanimous report of the
Committee of Governors (1971), appointed by the President of India. This
committee,
comprising five Governors, recommended that only when a responsible
government cannot be maintained without doing violence to correct
constitutional practice
should the Governor resort to Article 356 of the Constitution. It said:
&quot;What is important to remember is that recourse to Article 356 should be the
last
resort for a Governor to seek… the guiding principle being, as already
stated, that the constitutional machinery in the State should, as far as
possible,
be maintained.&quot;

In the Rameshwar Prasad case, the Supreme Court was called upon to pronounce
its verdict on the validity of the proclamation of President's Rule and the
dissolution of the Assembly in Bihar in 2005.

The Bommai judgment could not be applied to a situation in which no
political party could get a majority and more parties could not come
together to form
a government, as was obtained in Bihar in 2005.

THE HINDU PHOTO LIBRARY

Justice R.S. Sarkaria (right), Chairman of the Sarkaria Commission, with S.R.
Sen, member of the Commission, in Bangalore. A file photograph.

The petitioners in this case alleged that the Governor of Bihar, Buta Singh,
recommended dissolution of the Assembly on the basis of his subjective
satisfaction
– without any material – that some parties were trying to cobble up a
majority in the Assembly through tainted means, and that it would not lead
to a stable
government.

The Supreme Court's majority view in this case was that if a political party
with the support of other political parties or other MLAs staked claim to
form
a government and satisfied the Governor about its majority to form a stable
government, the Governor could not override the majority claim because of
his
subjective assessment that the majority was cobbled up by illegal and
unethical means. (Buta Singh had to quit following the Supreme Court's
judgment holding
the dissolution of the Assembly unconstitutional.) In the Rameshwar Prasad
judgment, the majority of the Supreme Court's five-Judge Bench said: &quot;The
minority
governments are not unknown. It is also not unknown that the Governor, in a
given circumstance, may not accept the claim to form the government, if
satisfied
that the party or the group staking claim would not be able to provide to
the State a stable government. It is also not unknown that despite various
differences
of perception, the party, group or MLAs may still not opt to take a step
which may lead to the fall of the government for various reasons, including
their
being not prepared to face the elections. These and many other imponderables
can result in MLAs belonging to even different political parties to come
together.
It does not necessarily lead to assumption of allurement and horse-trading.&quot;

This pronouncement has great relevance in the context of the current
political situation in Karnataka.

The Court further said: &quot;In absence of the relevant material much less due
to verification, the report of the Governor has to be treated as the
personal
ipse dixit of the Governor. The drastic and extreme action under Article 356
cannot be justified on mere ipse dixit, suspicion, whims, and fancies of the
Governor… The Governor may be the main player, but the Council of Ministers
should have verified [the] facts stated in the report of the Governor before
hurriedly accepting it as a gospel truth as to what Governor stated.
Clearly, the Governor has misled the Council of Ministers, which led to aid
and advice
being given by the Council of Ministers to the President leading to the
issue of the impugned Proclamation.&quot;

In the ongoing crisis in Karnataka, the reports sent by the Governor to the
President, therefore, acquire extraordinary significance, as the Centre has
to rely on them before taking a decision on the use of Article 356 in the
State.

STOCK MARKET
False notes
V. SRIDHAR

Recent events in the markets confirm the suspicion that the stock market
tail is wagging the economy dog as never before.

THAT the Indian stock markets have lost their moorings in the &quot;economic
fundamentals&quot; is now a cliché. What is not as readily recognised is that the
economic
fundamentals have been impacted adversely by foreign institutional investors
(FIIs), the main drivers of the unprecedented stock market boom. Recent
gyrations
in the markets confirm the apprehension that the government is willing to
appease the big guns of global speculative finance even at the cost of
economic
logic. Indeed, recent events confirm the suspicion that the stock market
tail is wagging the economy dog as never before.

On October 16, after the markets closed for the day, the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the market regulator, issued a discussion
paper
setting out a road map to wind up the issuance of Participatory Notes (PN),
which, even according to a large section of market participants, are opaque
instruments (see separate story). SEBI sought the views of market
participants on the issue by October 20.

SEBI proposed that FIIs and their sub-accounts stop issuing PNs with
immediate effect and sought that they unwind their current positions over an
18-month
period. It also sought the discontinuance, with &quot;immediate effect&quot;, of fresh
issue of PNs by broker sub-accounts of the FIIs. Clearly, the move was aimed
at weeding out PNs and the 18-month period was to ensure that the markets
did not crash as a result of bunched unwinding of positions.

For a long time several regulatory agencies, notably the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI), have called for a halt to the issuance of this instrument,
which has
been used primarily by hedge funds to enter the Indian markets. For the RBI,
the issue was not one of merely curbing excessive speculation in stock
prices,
which have driven share prices to unprecedented levels in the past few
months (graphic below). The notion of throwing &quot;sand in the wheels of the
market&quot;
– an expression made famous by Nobel laureate (1981) James Tobin in the
context of the East Asian crisis a decade ago – was appealing to the RBI not
merely
because it would curb speculation. More critically, the central bank saw it
as a measure that would offer it respite from dealing with the macroeconomic
imbalances posed by the influx of large volumes of portfolio investments.

The RBI found that the flood of money not only rendered ineffective its
monetary policy – the institution's raison d'être – but also exposed the
economic
system to instability.

Mayhem followed the SEBI announcement, on October 17. In the Bombay Stock
Exchange, trading halted minutes after it commenced, as the bellwether, the
Sensex,
dropped by 1,700 points. The markets recovered 1,000 points but not before
Finance Minister P. Chidambaram made a statement. He said the government was
&quot;not in favour of banning PNs&quot;. &quot;We have simply placed a cap on the
proportion of money coming through PNs,&quot; he said.

Although Chidambaram refrained from mentioning anything adverse about the
instrument itself, he gave some idea why the government had resorted to the
move.
In particular, he stressed that SEBI's proposals were intended to moderate
capital inflows, which have been copious in the past few sessions.

PUNIT PARANJPE/REUTERS

Outside the Bombay Stock Exchange building when the BSE Sensex topped 20,000
on October 29.

Reacting to the sharp fall in share prices, Chidambaram assured investors
that sobriety would set in. &quot;Before the day is over, everybody will think it
over
and the market will cool down,&quot; he said. And, indeed, the Sensex recovered
nearly 1,000 points by noon. But what really set the markets moving up again
was a &quot;clarification&quot; from SEBI that &quot;there was no bar&quot; on PNs being
renewed, provided they were done within 18 months.

The Sensex, which had breached the 19,000 mark on October 15, took fewer
than ten more trading days to top 20,000, which it did on October 29. In
effect,
the Sensex registered a whopping 33 per cent growth since July 2007. No
other asset, not even the highly speculative real estate business, currently
offers
comparable returns. Later, SEBI chairman M. Damodaran reiterated that the
use of PNs would be restricted. However, he made two important concessions.
The
first related to allowing proprietary sub-accounts of the FIIs, which are
formed to invest their own funds, to issue PNs provided they register
themselves
with SEBI within 24 hours. The other was to put FII registration on the fast
track. Damodaran also said SEBI would consider broadening the list of
categories
of investors that can enter Indian markets as FIIs.

Although initial indications were that SEBI would not allow investors who
were not regulated in their own country to be registered here, Damodaran
later
said that they may be allowed if &quot;they gave regulatory comfort about the
nature of funds and the kind of investments made in India&quot;. He added that
SEBI
&quot;may waive the requirement that entities need to be regulated in their home
country for being registered as an FII in India&quot;.

Damodaran also said that SEBI &quot;may allow&quot; foreign individuals with an
investment kitty of over $50 million to operate as sub-accounts to invest in
the Indian
equity market. He said the condition that a foreign entity should have a
one-year track record for getting registered as an FII might be reviewed.

The SEBI chief's statements since the collapse of October 17 and the upward
climb of stock prices since then give the impression that the FIIs have
managed
to wrangle a good deal from what appeared to be a weak position. Between
October 17 and October 22 the FIIs liquidated (in net terms) more than Rs.6
,000
crore in equities. However, between October 23 and October 30 they made net
investments of more than Rs.3,300 crore in equities. Clearly, for them the
India Story still looked good.

Statements of several FIIs, welcoming the SEBI move to weed out PNs,
indicated that they now had other avenues of investing in Indian markets.
The promised
liberal approach towards registration is likely to open the doors to
entirely new classes of investors – pension funds, universities and
charitable societies
among others. The move is also likely to favour the larger FIIs, leading to
greater concentration within the FII class of investors. The experience with
FII investment indicates that larger funds have greater ability to effect
volatility in the Indian markets, much more than what has been seen in the
past
few years. The recent developments indicate that FIIs have finally had their
way. Even if PNs are phased out, they may still have the last laugh.

FOREX INFLUX

For some years now the RBI has been grappling with the problem of a
&quot;copious&quot; inflow of foreign exchange. The inflow has played an important
part in bolstering
the foreign exchange reserves. In March 2005, about a year after the United
Progressive Alliance (UPA) assumed power, the reserves stood at about $150
billion.

By the end of March 2006 they were almost $200 billion, an increase of
one-third in a year, and as of October 19, 2007, they amounted to $261
billion, a
nearly 25 per cent increase in six months since the end of the last
financial year (March 31, 2007).

The effect of these burgeoning reserves has been felt particularly on the
value of the rupee vis-À-vis the dollar. The exchange rate was Rs.39.58 to a
dollar
on October 24. At this level, the rupee has appreciated over 10 per cent
compared with the levels prevailing on March 31. The rupee is now at its
highest
level against the dollar in more than nine years.

Large swathes of the real economy, particularly those tied to exports,
ranging from software to textiles and even automobiles, have been affected
by the
appreciation of the rupee. Almost all industrial lobbies, including the
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the Associated Chambers of Commerce
and
Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce
and Industry (FICCI) and others representing sectional interests, such as
garment
manufacturers, have appealed to the government for a bailout of some sort.

More critically, the burden of the rupee's appreciation is likely to fall on
workers in these industries in the form of wage cuts and/or more onerous
working
conditions so that companies remain &quot;competitive&quot;.

The government faced criticism from the Left and the Right for its handling
of the issue. The Bharatiya Janata Party demanded a Joint Parliamentary
Committee
to determine who and which entities profited from the extreme volatility in
share prices after the SEBI announcement. Kirit Somaiya, the party's former
Member of Parliament and founder president of the Investors' Grievance
Forum, criticised Chidambaram for issuing the &quot;clarification&quot; to investors
on October
17 and accused him of acting &quot;irresponsibly&quot;.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) demanded a ban on PNs, seeing its
continued existence as a part of the government's resolve to continue with
capital
account liberalisation. It pointed out that &quot;even such a half-hearted
measure by SEBI has led to massive pull-out of funds precipitating a huge
fall in
the markets&quot;. This, it observed, &quot;only reflects the defiance of the FIIs
towards regulatory institutions in India&quot;.

CASINO ECONOMY

SHASHI ASHIWAL

M. DAMODARAN, SEBI Chairman. He said SEBI would consider broadening the list
of categories of investors that can enter the Indian markets as FIIs.

The RBI, in an effort to stem the appreciation of the rupee, has been adding
to its foreign exchange reserves by buying dollars. Although the RBI has
undertaken
measures to mop up excess liquidity resulting from its purchase of dollars,
it is finding it more and more difficult to &quot;sterilise&quot; the excess liquidity
in the system. Moreover, there is always the danger of the central bank not
being able to cope with a sustained speculative attack on the rupee.

While defending the rupee, the RBI also has to ensure that the overhang of
liquidity does not stoke inflation. In effect, the RBI's ability to impose
its
monetary policy on the economic system is seriously compromised because of
these large and increasing volumes of inflows.

The option of using the reserves to expand productive capacity through
public spending – referred to as deficit financing – is a strict no-no
according
to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management (FRBM) Act.

It is estimated that FII inflows account for about one-fifth of all inflows
in the current year. The move to curb PNs, even if it had not sealed all
routes,
would have at least sent a signal to foreign investors that the government
would not hesitate to use any means at its command to arrest speculative
inflows.
The dilution of the move evidently opens the doors to speculative attacks on
the rupee.

Hedge funds

VIJAY KUMAR JOSHI/PTI

FINANCE MINISTER P. CHIDAMBARAM with RBI Governor Y.V. Reddy at an RBI
function in New Delhi. A file picture. For some years now, the RBI has been
grappling
with a copious inflow of foreign exchange. On October 30, Chidambaram said:
&quot;This is a complex, new situation for us. We welcome capital, but we must
learn
to manage it and how to absorb it.&quot;

Although precise data on hedge fund operations in India are hard to come by,
market sources reckon that they are among the main holders of PNs. Between
September 18, when the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates, and the end
of October, net FII investment in equity markets amounted to $7.53 billion.
It is widely believed that U.S.-based hedge funds are the major contributors
to the fresh inflows.

It is well known in market circles that hedge funds prefer PNs as the
vehicle of investment. Hedge funds' very existence is based on moving large
volumes
of investments across the globe in search of the slightest possibilities for
arbitrage. Moreover, they play &quot;two-way&quot; bets in multiple markets, resulting
in their making profits irrespective of the direction in which the markets
move. They are, in effect, investors who can enter multiple casinos with a
single
ticket and make profits in each one of them.

Recent reports indicate that several hedge funds have resorted to currency
arbitrage under the pretext of equity investments. Nameless and faceless,
these
funds apparently bet on both the upward and downward movement of the rupee,
all under the pretext of investing in equities. Although RBI rules do not
permit
hedge funds to place bets on the Indian foreign exchange market, they park
their funds in Indian equities, which they liquidate when the targeted
profits,
determined on the basis of levels in the forex market, are reached.

On October 30, Chidambaram reaffirmed that the country did face a problem of
capital inflows. &quot;This is a complex, new situation for us. We welcome
capital,
but we must learn to manage it and how to absorb it. We need to put in place
appropriate regulations and risk management systems,&quot; he said. He also
promised
that the Indian regulatory system &quot;will not fall behind [financial]
innovation&quot;.

The unwinding of the U.S. economy, which started with the sub-prime lending
crisis, has since enveloped the housing sector. Recent forecasts indicate
that
these may result in a squeeze on consumer spending, which can have ominous
consequences worldwide.

Meanwhile, market players appear less bothered about what the RBI Governor
has to say than what the U.S. Federal Reserve will do about interest rates.
The
recent cut in U.S. rates by 0.25 percentage points – and more cuts are
expected – is likely to drive portfolios scampering to emerging markets,
India being
a prime destination. Even without PNs the RBI is likely to come under
greater pressure to defend the rupee as it rises against the dollar.

It is well known that FIIs rule the markets (Frontline, June 16, 2006).
Since 1991, FII investment in Indian equity markets have amounted to nearly
Rs.3
lakh crore. The current market value of these investments amounts to nearly
Rs.7 lakh crore. The market value of holdings through PNs account for a
little
over half of all investments of FIIs. In fact, while overall FII investment
has increased 4.3 times between March 2004 and August 2007, holdings through
PNs have increased 11 times.

It is clear that a ban, or at least a series of steps aimed at enforcing a
ban over a clearly defined time frame, is not only prudent from a regulatory
perspective but also necessary for macroeconomic stability. The watered-down
interpretation of the SEBI ruling is unlikely to achieve either objective.
In effect, the demands of the casino economy have taken precedence over
those of the real economy.

All about PNs
PARTICIPATORY Notes (PNs) are instruments held by entities that are
otherwise not allowed to invest in Indian markets by the market regulator,
the Securities
and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). These instruments confer anonymity on
those who hold them. PNs are a class of Offshore Derivative Instruments
(ODI)
and have been the main avenue for the officially barred hedge funds to enter
Indian markets.

Brokerages affiliated to foreign institutional investors (FIIs) buy
India-based securities and then issue PNs to foreign investors, which are
basically
in the form of IOUs. Even though PN holders do not own the shares directly,
they are able to collect dividends or capital gains that accrue from the
underlying
assets. Moreover, the velocity of circulation of this instrument is enhanced
by the fact that it can be traded in international markets, which is why
foreign
investors find it attractive.

It is a derivative instrument since it &quot;derives&quot; its value from an
underlying share or security. It allows investors to build portfolios
depending on their
preference for individual shares. The instrument is issued through the
sub-accounts of registered FIIs operating in Indian markets.

Of the little over 1,000 FIIs registered with SEBI only about 34 are both
stockbrokers and institutional investors (in March 2004 there were only 14).
These
are the entities that issue PNs. Hedge funds are reckoned to be among the
main holders of PNs. Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Credit Lyonnais,
Citigroup
and Goldman Sachs are among the prime issuers of PNs.

According to SEBI, the notional value of PNs outstanding has shot up ten
times between March 2004 and August 2007 – from Rs.31,875 crore to Rs.3
,53,484
crore.

For regulatory agencies PNs are a major irritant because they are opaque
instruments belonging to faceless investors. But more importantly, from a
wider
economic perspective, they amplify the risks associated with volatility in
financial markets. For instance, sub-accounts themselves pool the PNs and
use
them as collateral to raise loans. The scope for such leveraging is
amplified when the resulting investments go into other derivative
instruments such
as futures and options of shares in Indian markets. This kind of leveraging
amplifies not only the scope for investing but also the movements of share
prices in the markets. The fact that players in the futures market need pay
upfront only a small part of the value of the contract as margin money
further
amplifies the fluctuation in turnover and prices.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been a consistent opponent of these
instruments. In November 2005, it presented a dissenting note to the Finance
Ministry's
Expert Group on Encouraging FII Flows and Checking the Vulnerability of
Capital Markets to Speculative Flows.

The RBI reiterated its &quot;stance that the issue of PNs should not be
permitted&quot;. It pointed out that its &quot;main concerns&quot; pertained to the
regulator's inability
to know the identity of the owner of the assets or who are the actual
&quot;beneficial owners&quot; of these instruments.

It also pointed out that the instrument encourages &quot;multilayering, which
will make it difficult to identify the ultimate holder of PNs&quot;. This results
from
the ability of the original PN holder to sell them to other players, whose
identity is also unknown. The central bank always regarded the spiralling
trade
in these opaque instruments as a serious hazard. It also observed that
weeding out these instruments would actually &quot;enhance the reputation of
markets
and lead to healthy flows&quot;.

The RBI has also reiterated its case that the modus operandi of PNs is a
gross violation of the know-your-customer norms, which are a basic
requirement
for any investor participating in any financial market.

In the past two years, there were several proposals to ban PNs. The S.S.
Tarapore Committee's report on full capital account convertibility in July
2006
recommended that FIIs be prohibited from investing fresh money through PNs.
It recommended that PNs be phased out in a year after providing its holders
an exit route.

In fact, a few years ago, under the stewardship of G.N. Bajpai, SEBI itself
considered banning PNs. This was based on its investigation of the stock
market
scam in 2000, orchestrated by the Kolkata-based broker Ketan Parekh. In
fact, SEBI admitted, &quot;it is not possible to identify the actual
beneficiaries of
PNs&quot;.

The regulator also found that about $2 billion had been brought in and taken
out of the country by Overseas Corporate Bodies (OCBs) registered in
Mauritius.
Although the RBI subsequently banned OCBs from investing in the stock
market, the PN game continued with SEBI and the Finance Ministry looking the
other
way. The Finance Ministry's logic, driven by its overarching interest in
wooing foreign investors at any cost, was that PNs provided an opportunity
for
unregistered investors to invest in India.

The dangers posed by PNs can be disproportionately larger than the actual
amounts involved in the transactions. For instance, the Joint Parliamentary
Committee
(JPC) probe into the stock scam of 2000 (popularly known as the Ketan Parekh
scandal) revealed that although only four sub-accounts issued PNs (against
shares worth Rs.14,000 crore) involved in the scandal, they were used to rig
share prices on a much wider scale, which disrupted the entire system.

Fears have repeatedly been expressed by not only the RBI but also political
parties that these opaque instruments pose a serious security hazard. In
particular,
there is the apprehension that they can be used by drug cartels and
terrorist organisations to funnel money into India. While this may be so,
the threat
perception need not necessarily be based on such fears alone.

For a long time now, PNs have been regarded as a threat to the very
integrity of the economic system. Quite apart from the fact they are a prime
vehicle
for the burgeoning foreign exchange reserves, which has been a worrisome
factor for the RBI in the past four years, they pose other systemic risks as
well.
For one, it is well known that Indian promoters of companies have used PNs
to bring in funds parked overseas to fund the creeping acquisition of their
companies' stock to guard against takeovers. Tax authorities also fear that
Indian money launderers use PNs to ship funds out of the country using the
hawala route and then get it back into the country posing as PNs.

PURNIMA S. TRIPATHI
in Ballabhgarh and New Delhi

Over 25,000 Dalits and tribal people from 18 States march from Gwalior to
New Delhi to fight for land rights.

S. SUBRAMANIUM

The Janadesh yatra near Badarpur on its way to New Delhi, on October 27.

&quot;WORK for every hand, bread for every stomach, land for the landless,
protection for small farmers and traders, change in the present economic
policies.&quot;
This summed up the demands of 25,000 landless Dalits and tribal people, from
over 18 States in the country, who marched to New Delhi last month.

The padayatra, called Janadesh 2007, began in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh on
October 2, Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary, and culminated in New Delhi
on
October 28. In the process, the marchers proved that Gandhian satyagraha can
achieve results even today. They were to march to Parliament House the next
day and gherao it. Overawed by their sheer number and determination (they
had declared that they would stay put in the capital until all their demands
were accepted), the government announced the formation of a committee to
look into their demands, thereby stopping them from marching to Parliament
House.

The committee on &quot;State Agrarian Relations and The Unfinished Task in Land
Reforms&quot;, which will be formed within a month, is to be headed by the Rural
Development
Minister and will have on its panel experts from the field and rights
activists. It will submit its report to the National Land Reform Council,
which is
headed by the Prime Minister. The committee, whose recommendations would be
advisory in nature, will look at various livelihood issues related to land.
Among other things, it will come up with a national land reforms policy and
ensure its implementation within a time frame.

Sceptics may say that the best way to sweep an issue under the carpet is to
form a committee to look into it. But the fact that the marchers forced the
issue of land reforms into the Central government's agenda is an achievement
by itself, particularly in an age in which big dams displace thousands from
their lands and big industries drive farmers out of their croplands.

ANU PUSHKARNA

The marchers at the Ramlila Grounds in New Delhi on October 29.

Satisfied with the government move, the marchers celebrated the day as
victory day and dispersed for their respective destinations – after making
it clear
that they would return with another movement called &quot; Joto Jeeto&quot; (plough
and earn the land) in case the government failed to solve their land
problems.

P.V. Rajgopal, president of the Ekta Parishad, which organised the
padayatra, welcomed the government announcement and said his movement would
wait for
the outcome before deciding the next move. The Ekta Parishad has three main
demands: formation of a national land commission to sort out land-related
issues;
establishment of fast-track courts to resolve land disputes pending in
courts for years; and the setting up of a single-window system to take care
of administrative
procedures in land-related issues.

More than the committee, what is actually remarkable about Janadesh 2007 is
that in true Gandhian style, 25,000 people walked for 26 days, covering 350
kilometres, without causing any major disruptions in the cities and villages
they crossed even though the yatra occupied a minimum of five to six
kilometres
on the road while on the move. They walked 12 km every day and camped on the
highways at night.

The preparations for the yatra had been going on for the last one year.
Every minute detail – where and how they would eat or relieve themselves
without
creating a mess on the roads, or how they would walk – was worked out. In
fact, a smaller yatra of 500 people traversed the same route and the same
distance
a year ago in order to work out the details and create awareness about
Janadesh 2007.

&quot;People's support was overwhelming. In fact even those who had nothing to do
with land issues came out in support and helped us in whatever way they
could,
such as by arranging for food and shelter,&quot; said yatra coordinator
Mrityunjay Sanjay. The cooperation from State governments, too, was
adequate, and at
no point did the marchers come across any hurdles created by the
authorities, he said. Except, of course, in Delhi, where the marchers were
barricaded
inside the Ramlila Grounds, their camping site, and prevented from marching
to Parliament House.

It was actually their Gandhian style that won them the enthusiastic support
of Rural Development Minister Raghuvansh Prasad, who went out of his way to
persuade the Prime Minister to give the satyagrahis sympathetic
consideration. &quot;They walked, despite grave hardships, in true Gandhian
style, totally peacefully,
without creating any chaos anywhere. It is our duty to give their demands
due consideration because their demands are absolutely justified.
Landlessness
has emerged as a big problem in our country and it is our duty to tackle the
problem at the earliest; otherwise it will breed discontent and violence in
the rural areas,&quot; he told Frontline.

PTI

Women participants shout slogans as the yatra passes through Agra on October
12.

The naxalite problem, described as the &quot;biggest internal security challenge&quot;
by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, is basically a result of unresolved land
issues. According to an assessment by the Planning Commission, land-related
issues constitute the basic factor contributing to the growth of naxalism.
The Commission has listed eight basic reasons for the growing naxal menace
in tribal areas: sale and transfer of land to other tribal people;
indebtedness,
causing sale of land for inconsequential amounts; eviction of tribal people
by non-tribal people or government authorities; conversion of land from
community
ownership to individual ownership; treatment of tribal people as encroachers
on forest land, their traditional source of livelihood; failure to give
title
deeds for government land distributed to tribal people but not possession
deeds on them; environment-disturbing developments in tribal areas that
force
tribal people to move out; and large-scale displacement because of
development projects such as multi-purpose irrigation projects, power
plants, mining
projects and urbanisation.

In fact, every single marcher that this correspondent spoke to during the
yatra – whether Malthu from Kosalpur in Madhya Pradesh, or Puran Chand from
Chhattisgarh,
or Shobh Lal of Bihar, or Ram Dulari of Uttar Pradesh (incidentally she came
carrying her four-month-old baby in her arms) – were all victims of
landlessness,
having lost their lands to either the government or some big business house
for some project or the other. Some had had their lands taken over by forest
department officers who claimed that these were forest land. From being
farmers, they had suddenly found themselves reduced to being labourers
working
for daily wages; and they had no forum to seek redress. Complaints to
authorities yielded no results. No wonder they came on the yatra with a 'do
or die'
spirit; they had nothing to lose and this yatra at least held the promise of
hope for the future.

Remarkably enough, over 250 foreign nationals from 12 countries, either
representing various rights groups or in their individual capacities,
marched with
the procession. It gave them a rare opportunity to participate in a truly
Gandhian satyagraha. &quot;This is the closest that one can get to the concept of
Gandhian satyagraha. Besides, the sufferings of these people have moved me
enough to join the yatra,&quot; said 67-year-old Jacques Vellut from Brussels,
who
has worked for the deprived all his life.

One can only hope that the Indian government, too, will be equally moved to
deliver what it has promised these people.

THE STATES
Fanning the flames
SUHRID SANKAR CHATTOPADHYAY

Nandigram erupts again. And with the Opposition spurning the government's
offer of dialogue, a political solution is not in sight.

ARUNANGSU ROY CHOWDHURY

In Kolkata, Trinamool Congress workers led by Sonali Guha, MLA (pointing
fingers), preventing autorickshaws from plying on a day of bandh called by
the
party to protest against the conflict in Nandigram, on October 31.

What started off as a violent agitation against a rumour of land acquisition
in Nandigram block in West Bengal's East Midnapore (Purba Medinipur)
district
10 months ago has, in fact, taken the form of a struggle for turf control
between the Bhumi Uchhed Pratirodh (Land Eviction Resistance) Committee – a
motley
crowd consisting of supporters of the Trinamool Congress, the Socialist
Unity Centre of India (SUCI), the Jamait-i-Ulema-e-Hind and naxalites – and
supporters
of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). After incessant violence during
which many lives were lost, properties destroyed and more than 2,500 CPI(M)
supporters forced to flee their homes, there followed a relative calm in the
month of September.

The Left Front government in the State had just started formulating a
political strategy to ensure safe return of those rendered homeless when
clashes broke
out again on October 7. In the firing that followed, Parvati Mitra, 72, was
killed and two others, including 10-year-old Mano Mandal, were injured. In
Daudpur and Ranichak areas of Nandigram, another 200 people were rendered
homeless and 25 houses were ransacked, allegedly by the BUPC. The violence
that
continued unabated for the next two days claimed the life of Manas Mandal,
49, a schoolteacher and zonal committee member of the CPI(M). Later, another
16 houses were reportedly ransacked.

Each side accused the other of precipitating the violence. When the CPI(M)
claimed that the BUPC was trying to extend its control in Nandigram by
encroaching
on CPI(M) strongholds, the BUPC blamed the CPI(M) for trying to regain lost
ground with an eye on the panchayat elections due next year. Areas of
control
are clearly demarcated in the region: Nandigram Block I, comprising five
gram panchayats and 40 mouzas, is under the control of the BUPC; in Reyapada
and
Chandipur – formerly known as Nandigram II and III – the CPI(M) retains some
hold, albeit in pockets.

The Telpatti canal separates Nandigram from Khejuri, a CPI(M) stronghold,
where villagers, allegedly driven out of their homes by the BUPC for being
CPI(M)
supporters, have taken shelter in makeshift relief camps. But even in these
impoverished shelters, they are not safe.

From mid-October, people all over the State got into the festive spirit of
Durga Puja and Id. As though waiting for the celebrations to end, on the
evening
of October 22, armed BUPC men launched a fresh attack in which 50 families
had to flee their villages in Nandigram II. A CPI(M) regional office and a
panchayat
office were ransacked; even the only library in the area was not spared. The
attack took place in Takapura, in the BUPC's zone of control in Nandigram
II, close to the relief camp at the Khejuri border. CPI(M) sources say the
BUPC's idea was to attack the refugees in the camp.
