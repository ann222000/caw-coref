Yeah, they got lucky against a mediocre teamk, but they have some GOOD
teams on the sked, starting next week.

I say again, the Steelers are going to KILL us, absolutely hand our
asses to us.

Unless they can turn the offense around, they're going to be 2-3 at the
bye.

As well it should, the Rams should have handed the Niners asses to them,
based on how the two teams play.

But I can't say it feels like much of a win, in light of the next three
teams the Niners play. I say again, they will probably be 2-3 at the bye
next month.

Your team deserved to win, I think your coach lost the game for you.

56 yards is clearly out wilkins range. amazingly dumb call.

and bulger spiking the ball when we got that first down? amazingly
stupid. the rams needed yards, not time (there was plenty left), and to
get yards, you need downs.

but congratulations on the win. a win is a win, as they say.

And 2-3 after five games is, compared to what a lot of people were
predicting, actually pretty damn good. The hard part of our schedule is
early this year, and if this team can get to the midpoint at 3-5, that's
not such a big deal, we could still finish over .500.

Next week we're @ pittsburg, should be an L.
Then we're home agains Sea, who'll be favored but are beatable if we
play well (a big if).
The Baltimore will come in and clobber us.

But, again, what were your expectations before the season?

Why do you say think that? The Steelers have played the Browns with
Charlie Frye and a horrible defense and the Bills with JP Losman, two
weak teams. Smith ain't that much better than Losman or Frye but a
least the Niners are showing some defense this year. I think its a
good test for both teams.

The 49ers have played the Cardinals, who have a weak defense and a weak
armed QB, and the Rams who have a weak defense.  Two weak teams.  The
difference is that the Steelers won both games handily.

Some, but if you noticed, the Rams pretty much passed at will on the 49ers
all day.  What saved them were turnovers, particularly when Clements
punched the ball out of Holt's hands.

The Rams moved the ball on the Niners but never really got into the
endzone. Only time they did was  Williams muffed punt in the first
quarter put them on the 30yrd line.

As long as the Niners don't commit a ton of turnovers I think game
will be close.
