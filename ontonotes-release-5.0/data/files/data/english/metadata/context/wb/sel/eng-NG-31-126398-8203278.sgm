I recently encountered issues with two applications which I literally run
every day, SuperDuper! and Hogwasher.

In both cases I reported in detail the issues I encountered to the suppliers
of the aforementioned applications, Shirt-Pocket for SuperDuper! and Asar for
Hogwasher.

I received a response from Shirt-Pocket within the hour. Although a number of
days have passed I have yet to even receive an acknowledgment from Asar.

I am a strong proponent of both SuperDuper! and Hogwasher, but find myself
perplexed at the difference in support provided.

This is a general statement, not specifically about Hogwasher and Asar,
but you have to bear in mind that many shareware companies are quite
small, often just one person, who quite likely has a day job.  It's
entirely possible you're waiting to hear from someone who's on vacation.

&gt; I always assumed Kurt Spaker (Hogwasher) was a lone operator with a
&gt; day-job. He assures me he is the only person involved with HW but does not
&gt; have a dayjob. So maybe he's rich and Asar is a hobby. Only speaking for
&gt; myself, in my experiences with HW issues, unless the problem is truly with
&gt; HW itself (i.e. a bug) you probably won't hear back. If the problem is
&gt; user error, corrupt files, something that is somewhere in Help, user
&gt; ignorance (of even the most obscure, arcane, inane facet), or something
&gt; rectifiable with any other methods, you will not hear. Dave will help when
&gt; you are using a bogus copy and when it's not even a SD! issue.

The following three statements are from the Hogwasher help file....

==========

Symptom: &quot;An unknown error has occurred&quot;

Explanation: The MacOS has reported an error that is not in Hogwasher's
defined list of errors.

Solution: Please choose Technical Support in the Hogwasher menu and include
the error code, a description of what you were doing when the error occurred,
and the Technical Support information (see above). We will assist you in
determining the cause of the error and an appropriate course of action.

==========

When the crashing occurred I did use the Technical Support option and
included a description of what I was doing at the moment of the crash and
included a copy of the Hogwasher crash log. This was done several times
without any response.

Having received no response from Asar regarding my Hogwasher problem,
immediate crashing upon an attempt to read a given subscription, I finally
totally trashed Hogwasher and all of its files and then reinstalled Hogwasher
and rebuilt my subscriptions, an action that eliminated the crashing. However
this was an action I preferred to not do, but in desperation finally forced
myself to do. It did cure the problem, but at the expense of losing my
history. Whether or not there could have been a less violent solution could
likely have been answered if Asar bothered to respond to my request for help.

There have often been grumps posted in these discussions that Hogwasher is
high priced for a newsreader. One would expect that part of what you are
paying for is the support I did not receive.

Hi

I haven't personally had a problem with getting responses from Asar, but
I've seen these issues raised by others so I don't doubt your experience.

I've never known if there is any form of contractual obligation with regard
to support for software however I would think that it would surely always
make sense for the software developer to respond to emailed queries.

Patrick,

Like you I have yet to find a newsreader that has an interface as useful and
as enjoyable as that provided by Hogwasher, a product I have used for around
five years. But unfortunately in those five years I have experienced somewhat
lackadaisical level of support from Asar. As I suggested earlier in this
thread this support, or lack of, is in extreme contrast to that provided by
Shirt-Pocket. One wonders how much support relates to market penetration. I
started using SuperDuper! a few years ago when it was a quite obscure backup
application for the Mac. Now SuperDuper! seems to have become the most
recommended of those applications, seemingly bypassing such as CarbonCopy
Cloner and Retrospect. Has the extreme level of support for SuperDuper! been
partly responsible? I want to say yes it has!

Jim

I bet it has :)

If I were a software developer I'd give a great deal of attention to the
any problems people might have with my program.

Quite apart from being considerate, which is why I'd do it, there would I
think be a benefit in market share.

I once wrote an e-mail to Shirt-Pocket support and received a helpful
response five minutes later.  Those guys are awesome.
