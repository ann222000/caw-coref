Consider these lines from a ‘what if’ piece in the National
Geographic of October, 2004:

“As the whirling maelstrom approached the coast, more than a million
people evacuated to higher ground. Some 200,000 remained, however—the
car-less, the homeless, the aged and infirm, and those die-hard New
Orleanians who look for any excuse to throw a party.

“The storm hit Breton Sound with the fury of a nuclear warhead,
pushing a deadly storm surge into Lake Pontchartrain. The water crept to
the top of the massive berm that holds back the lake and then spilled
over. Nearly 80 percent of New Orleans lies below sea level—more than
eight feet below in places—so the water poured in. A liquid brown wall
washed over the brick ranch homes of Gentilly, over the clapboard houses
of the Ninth Ward, over the white-columned porches of the Garden
District, until it raced through the bars and strip joints on Bourbon
Street like the pale rider of the Apocalypse. As it reached 25 feet
(eight meters) over parts of the city, people climbed onto roofs to
escape it.

“Thousands drowned in the murky brew that was soon contaminated by
sewage and industrial waste. Thousands more who survived the flood later
perished from dehydration and disease as they waited to be rescued. It
took two months to pump the city dry, and by then the Big Easy was
buried under a blanket of putrid sediment, a million people were
homeless, and 50,000 were dead. It was the worst natural disaster in the
history of the United States.”

That was written a year ago. You see, we did know. We’ve known it was
coming for years.

The Big Easy is being buried now under a blanket of lies.

Consider this from a Sept. 4, 2005 Chicago Tribune piece:

“While federal and state emergency planners scramble to get more
military relief to Gulf Coast communities stricken by Hurricane Katrina,
a massive naval goodwill station has been cruising offshore, underused
and waiting for a larger role in the effort.

“The USS Bataan, a 844-foot ship designed to dispatch Marines in
amphibious assaults, has helicopters, doctors, hospital beds, food and
water. It also can make its own water, up to 100,000 gallons a day. And
it just happened to be in the Gulf of Mexico when Katrina came roaring
ashore.

“The Bataan rode out the storm and then followed it toward shore,
awaiting relief orders. Helicopter pilots flying from its deck were some
of the first to begin plucking stranded New Orleans residents.

“But now the Bataan's hospital facilities, including six operating
rooms and beds for 600 patients, are empty. A good share of its 1,200
sailors could also go ashore to help with the relief effort, but they
haven't been asked. The Bataan has been in the stricken region the
longest of any military unit, but federal authorities have yet to fully
utilize the ship.”

Or this from an Associated Press piece this morning:

“The top U.S. disaster official waited hours after Hurricane Katrina
struck the Gulf Coast before he proposed to his boss sending at least
1,000 Homeland Security workers into the region to support rescuers,
internal documents show.”

We did the best we could? That’s a lie. We did not do the best we
could. The federal response to this disaster was a tragedy of
incompetence.

This administration failed us—and thousands of Americans died as a
result of that failure.

Sure, there will be hearings and inquiries. There will be commissions
of one sort or another. We had those after 9/11, remember? What was that
conclusion?

“Across the government there were failures of imagination, policies,
capabilities, and management. The most important failure was one of
imagination.”

Thousands of Americans died as a result of those failures, too. Was
there any accountability? Were there any firings? Any charges filed?

No.

Instead we got Homeland Security, a new federal agency with 180,000
employees and a $40 billion budget, an agency that waited five days to
respond to Katrina--five days during which Americans died for lack of a
bottle of water.

Here's the rub. I have every confidence that when this is all sorted
out, the local and state officials will get more than their fair share
of blame. It's clear that they misjudged and played it easy, and their
incompetance cost yet untold lives. They will hopefuly lose their jobs,
face endless inquiry into their past dealings, and so forth.

I also believe it incredibly clear that our federal government
demonstrated that, if anything, it seems LESS well managed and capable
of responding to national disasters since 9/11. After all the money we
spent, after trusting and voting for the guys who claimed to be the ones
we could trust to ensure our security.

But I have little hope at all that much will change on that level.
Fact is, the only people who can really make a difference here are those
on the right. And for a couple of days there, the right suddenly seemed
to realize that it sort of matters even to them if our federal
government is incompetant: there are real "brass tacks" moments in which
wavering, incompetance, inattention, and wrong priorities just aren't
acceptable. But then they got the memos. They saw that this could hurt
the President politically: that their enemies on the left were
attacking. And the reflexes kicked in. Searching through the news to
find the most comical liberals and holding them up to prove that all
liberals are nuts is becoming the priority again. The mode of pure
apologetics started to take over. They had a choice. Demand
accountability from a President who will never have to run for office
again anyway, who has nothing to lose but the security of his country:
demand he own up to some of his poor choices in personel and judgement
as a leader in a crisis. Maybe improve our country's preparedness and
safety. Get some better people in there. Heck: why not actually do
something about the insane amount of pork that's been passed on, all to
either the detriment of either taxpayers or REAL security concerns:
stuff conservatives should care about (but now blithely say: "oh, well
that stuff, the betrayal of the very core to my entire ideology as a
conservative, I have a small disagreement with the President on that.
But he's so dreamy! Mentioning it at the fundraiser would be rude!"). Or
back to the same old same old of warring endlessly with liberal critics,
our country be damned. We'll see.

Excuse me, Barnie, who, exactly, said that "we did the best that we
could?" Not president Bush. He said the government response was
"unacceptable." Not me. Not anyone I've read. Please explain who this
mythical person is, and what he or she said, and then I might understand
the "lie" that supposedly took place.

Bush did say -- "Brownie, you're doing a great job." Jim, look up the
definition of "great" in the dictionary.

Even Michelle Malkin is calling for Brownie's head.

MEMO TO BUSH: FIRE MICHAEL BROWN

BY MICHELLE MALKIN • SEPTEMBER 04, 2005 08:17 AM

During his visit to Mobile, Ala., on Friday, President Bush singled
out Michael D. Brown, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
for praise:

"Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job."

Really? "Brownie's" job is to direct the federal response to natural
disasters such as Hurricane Katrina. Let's review his public statements
during the past week:

- He admitted that he didn't act more aggressively because as late as
last Sunday he expected Katrina to be a "standard hurricane" even though
the National Weather Service in New Orleans was already predicting
"human suffering incredible by modern standards."

- He proved himself utterly clueless about the disaster unfolding in
New Orleans. He claimed that the federal relief effort was "going
relatively well" and that the security situation in New Orleans was
"pretty darn good."

- He blamed the flood victims in New Orleans for failing to evacuate
on time, even though local authorities failed to make municipal vehicles
available to residents who could not drive or did not own their own
cars.

"It took four days to begin a large-scale evacuation of people
stranded in the Superdome stadium and to bring in significant amounts of
food and water to an American city easily accessible by motorway," the
Observer notes. "Relief agencies took half that time to reach Indonesia
after the Boxing Day tsunami. "

Although the delay was not entirely the fault of the Bush
Administration, Brown's complacency clearly didn't help. And his
bumbling statements after the hurricane struck have not inspired
confidence.

This is not the time to give a weak performer the benefit of the
doubt. The FEMA director's role in the ongoing recovery effort is too
important to be entrusted to a clueless political hack with such poor
judgment.

Rather than praise Michael Brown, Bush should fire him.

***

And Jim what about Karl Rove's sidekick Grover Norquist blaming the
debacle on Democratic local and state leaders?

And W himself said "I don't think anyone anticipated the breach of
the levees."

Well, that is just an outright lie, as we've seen from muliple
stories, such as the one about former Republican congressman and
assistant secretary of the Army named Michael Parker who was fired by
the Bush White House after accusing it of shortchanging the Corps of
Engineers. Wasn't Bush really saying "we did the best we could?"

And still Bush implicitly has faith in Brown. It takes guts to fire
someone in the middle of a job, like Truman did with MacArthur.

Jim, if you don't understand the rhetorical nature of this question

desperately spinning--read BIG LIE--then the only response I have is:
How 'bout them Red Sox!

PM offers a powerful bill of indictment against Michael Brown. If
Michelle Malkin offers a fair and accurate summary of Brown's
performance, I would agree: Bush needs to get over his personal loyalty
to the guy and relieve him from duty. Bush also deserves to take heat
for sticking with Brown as long as he has. Thank you for specifics, PM,
you're not fulminating, you've surfaced information that I was
unfamiliar with, and you've added to the quality of the dialogue.

Barnie, I'm sorry, but you don't have a lot of credibility on this
issue. When you call for Bush's head, and only Bush's head, and ignore
the pathetic performance by Louisiana and New Orleans government, you
don't come across as someone seeking the common good -- you come across
as a partisan blame monger. You see, while some people look to the
federal government for solutions to every problem, the United States is
still a federal system. States, localities and the feds all share
responsibilities in responding to disasters. Every level of government
was overwhelmed by this hurricane. But the only thing that outrages you
(and people like Scott) is the screw-ups that can be laid at the feet of
George Bush. Demonizing Bush as the fount of all incompetence,
negligence, suffering and evil in the world may satisfy the ultras in
the Democratic Party, but the general public will see see you as
unhinged.

Read Ed Risse's post. Some of the issues can be tied to individual
incompetence and negligence, but many problems have been brewing a lot
longer than any single mayor, governor or president. And none of those
problems will disappear if you impeach George Bush tomorrow. (As an
aside, the thrust of Ed's post is not to excuse Bush's performance.)

Focusing your ire on a single individual or even an entire
administration does nothing to illuminate or address the systemic
aspects of the disaster. Indeed, by your determination to personalize
the tragedy, you distract attention away from the systemic issues.

It's worth pointing out that a lot of the truly outrageous stuff
coming out of this disaster is not some ambiguous "who is to blame"
puzzle that will take months of working out chains of responsibility.
It's specific outrageous facts about the state and local and federal
government that the tragedy laid bare.

For instance, the gross political nepotism at work in the ONE agency
I would hope to be free from it (the one entrusted with ensuring our
national security). The tone deafness of sending rescue workers, eager
to get to work and save lives, off to be props in a political photo-op,
and then berating their "commitment to FEMA" when they refuse to
participate. The sheer ignorance of top officials about the facts of the
crisis, and the willingness to lie straight faced to the american people
about things in direct opposition to what we now know they had been
fully briefed on. None of these things, and countless others, are some
vague shifting morass of responsbility. They are shockingly, horribly
wrong on their face.

And to call for a wait in a rush to judgement, in the face of a huge
taxpayer-funded rush to judgement led by the administration's media
team: that's just silly. Politicians only listen when there is huge and
fast public outcry against what they do or don't do.

I am shutting down this thread and any other thread connected to
Hurricane Katrina -- unless there is a clear and compelling Virginia
angle to it. If you want to assert George Bush's culpability in the
disaster, then fine another blog. If you want to defend George Bush,
find another blog.

If you want to discuss what Katrina means for Virginia, I recommend
any number of posts that already appear on Bacon's Rebellion. Our
contributors have raised any number of serious issues already.
Development of vulnerable coastlines. Erosion of the wetlands that
buffer hurricane storm surges. Evacuation routes out of Hampton Roads.
Reshaping government entities with appropriate size and authority to
respond to emergencies. Empowering communities to respond to
emergencies. Virginia's response to the Katrina catastrophe. The
Governor's response to Katrina.

There are any number of other useful questions that could be
addressed here. What are the major threats that face Virginia? Where are
the gaps? Who has first-responder responsibility, and how long would
they have to operate alone before FEMA could arrive on the scene? What
is the condition of Virginia's emergency communications infrastucture --
how interoperable are state, local and federal communications sytems?

I welcome discussion on any of these topics. However, I will delete
any post that veers back into partisan blame mongering/defending of
President Bush, FEMA or anyone else for their role in Katrina.

This decision is not targeted at any individual or their comments No
one person's actions or comments have inspired this decision. (Salt
Lick, take note: This is not about your use of a particular word.) I
don't blame people for having strong emotions. I just refuse to allow
Bacon's Rebellion to become a forum for bitterness and divisiveness.

What does it mean to virginia? (1) Appoint capabale, experienced
people, not patronage buddies, to imporant leadership roles, 'cause when
the wind starts blowing, we need real people who know what they're
doing.

(2) Don't assume everyone is just like you and can just in the 'ole
SUV, fill it with $100 worth of gas and charge a room in C'ville to the
VISa. Do we have an inventory of target neighborhoods we'd have to
evacuate BEFORE the storm?

(3) Use the word MANDATORY a lot. Many LA communities never
instituted mandatory evacuations, which became justification for private
medical facilities (such as nursing homes) to say put. Make clear it's
mandatory and then BACK IT UP with the National Guard helping people
out.

(4)Schedule the National Guard days ahead of time. We are able to
watch developing storms and predict their path to an amazing degree of
accuracy now. I knew it was going to hit, so I know the LA emergency
officials did too. If the storm veers away, we can always cancel the
order.
