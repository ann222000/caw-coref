Hints of a breakdown of relativity theory?
The MAGIC gamma-ray telescope team has just released an eye-popping preprint
(following up earlier work) describing a search for an observational hint of
quantum gravity. What they've seen is that higher-energy gamma rays from an
extragalactic flare arrive later than lower-energy ones. Is this because
they travel through space a little bit slower, contrary to one of the
postulates underlying Einstein's special theory of relativity -- namely,
that radiation travels through the vacuum at the same speed no matter what?

The team studied two gamma-ray flares in mid-2005 from the black hole at the
heart of the galaxy Markarian 501. They compared gammas in two energy
ranges, from 1.2 to 10 tera-electron-volts (TeV) and from 0.25 to 0.6 TeV.
The first group arrived on Earth four minutes later than the second. One
team member, physicist John Ellis of CERN, says: &quot;The significance of the
time lag is above 95%, and the magnitude of the effect is beyond the
sensitivity of previous experiments.&quot;

Either the high-energy gammas were released later (because of how they were
generated) or they propagated more slowly. The team ruled out the most
obvious conventional effect, but will have to do more to prove that new
physics is at work -- this is one of those &quot;extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence&quot; situations. But if the high-energy gammas really did
lose the cosmic race, we're talking Big Discovery. It could be a way to
constrain string theory, loop quantum gravity, and other bleeding-edge
theories.

The basic picture is that high energies might cause small-scale fluctuations
in the shape of spacetime, which would act as subatomic lenses. The higher
the photon energy, the more it might induce such lensing and the slower it
would cover large distances. Four minutes isn't much of a delay over a
half-billion-year journey, but then again, you don't expect much. From the
lag, you can deduce where quantum gravity kicks in. Some theories predict
the effect is proportional to the quantum-gravity scale, in which case it
happens at 5 x 1017 giga-electron-volts (GeV). In others, it's proportional
to the square of the scale, in which case the lag implies 6 x 1010 GeV.

I need to look into this a bit more, but I just wanted to get the news out
there for people to mull.

Update (August 23rd): Another co-author, string theorist Dimitri Nanopoulos
of Texas A&amp;M, writes to me: &quot;I am very excited about this, because as you
know we suggested this effect about ten years ago and we have follow through
with several analyses and/or improvement on theory. Notice that the 0.4 x
1018 GeV is the typical string scale!!!!&quot;

Daniel Ferenc of U.C. Davis on the MAGIC team writes: &quot;There have been
attempts to observe time lags in gamma flares and in gamma-ray bursts, but
we have never seen something like this.... We should keep in mind that the
effect may still be inherent to the process of the emission of gamma rays in
the source, although not very likely. We are rapidly learning about such
emission processes in AGNs from new data collected by MAGIC, HESS, VERITAS,
and CANGAROO, in coincidence with x-ray and optical measurements, and will
know more soon.&quot;

Update (August 24th): We're starting to see bloggers weigh in, including the
inimitable Lubos Motl and Chris Lee at Ars Technica, though I'm surprised
there's not more. Here we finally get some observations that probe string
theory, if only tentatively, and people who have been loudly complaining
about the lack of such observations have gone silent.

Update (August 25th): Peter Woit has now weighed in, though he has less to
say about the MAGIC result itself than about a Slashdot headline about its
being used to test string theory. I think Woit's comments miss the point
somewhat. Like Samuel Johnson's walking dog, the fact we can talk about
empirically probing quantum gravity at all is remarkable.

Update (August 27th): Backreaction is skeptical, and rightly so. Although
caution is certainly in order, the whole reason that physicists (including
Backreaction itself) are interested at all is that it might indicate a
violation of special relativity.

Backreaction takes a lot of the puff out of this particular sail.

1) Sensationalism. That is not a good thing, for oh so many reasons.
2) The result is completely model-dependent.
3) The model sucks - not enough data to know if we are right.

It is notable that the higher energy rays appear to travel slower. In
theoretical discussions of tachyons, the higher energy particles
actually travel slower though above light speed than lower energy
tachyons, which is the reverse of the case with slower than light
particles. It would be interesting to find out if even higher energy
gamma rays appear to travel even slower.
In an earlier report, the higher energy gamma rays from Markarian 501
were also regarded as being anomalous because they were expected to be
absorbed by cosmic background radiation which wasn't observed.
Breaking of Lorentz invariance was one of the explanations proposed
for this also:

anomalies.

The post below originally from New Scientist of 23rd September 2000
discusses the anomalous detection of high-energy gamma rays from
Markarian 501. One proposed solution is that this may be due to
Lorentz invariance breaking at ultra-high energies:

UHECR AND THE TEV GAMMA PARADOXES.

This paper and others investigating breaking of Lorentz invariance at
ultra-high energies all note that this would require a preferred
frame,
that is, implicitly, violations of causality are not required.

Outburst from a galaxy leaves scientists in a quandry
By Hazel Muir

ONE WEEK in 1997, a mouse of a galaxy between the shoulders of
Hercules
turned into a monster. &quot;It was rather inconspicuous before,&quot; says
Heinz
Vslk, who watched the action from the island of La Palma. &quot;But all of
a
sudden it became the strongest source we've ever seen.&quot;

This outburst from the galaxy Markarian 501 has left scientists in a
quandary. The most energetic photons in the blast had trillions of
times the energy of a visible photon, and according to the laws of
physics as we understand them, they should never have made the vast
journey from that galaxy to Earth. They should have been snuffed out
by
the sea of infrared radiation that fills space.

So what's going on? Some physicists think there's something weird
happening inside Markarian 501: bunches of photons are ganging up into
exotic globs called Bose-Einstein condensates. Others say there'll be
an everyday explanation once they've mulled over the facts and figures
a little more. But some scientists think that Markarian 501 is telling
us something momentous. It might, they say, go down in history as the
key to a 21st-century revolution, a theory that at last marries
quantum
mechanics with Einstein's theory of gravity. Then this galaxy would be
a gateway to a hidden realm of nature where space and time are
radically transformed.

Markarian 501 is no newcomer to astronomers. It appears on photos of
the constellation Hercules dating back at least a century, and gets
its
name from Beniamin Markarian, a Georgian astronomer at the Byurakan
Astrophysical Observatory in Armenia who started to compile a
catalogue
of hundreds of bluish galaxies in the 1960s.

Numbers 501 and 421 in his catalogue are special. At around 300
million
light years away, they are the two closest examples to Earth of a rare
and strange type of astronomical object known as a blazar. Like other
kinds of active galaxy, such as quasars and radio galaxies, blazars
are
thought to be powered by a central black hole which feeds on the gas,
dust and stars that whirl around it in a hot disc. Above and below the
hole, two jets of energetic protons and electrons shoot millions of
light years into space.

Blazars are capricious, flaring up and dimming again within just a few
days. Astronomers think that this is because of their orientation. We
see an active galaxy as a blazar if one of its jets is pointing
towards
us, as though we're looking down the barrel of a gun. The jet sends
out
a narrow beam of radiation whose brightness can change rapidly as it
shifts slightly or its supply of material from the black hole changes.

This special alignment also means we are assailed with ferociously
energetic radiation. In 1992, the orbiting Compton Gamma Ray
Observatory picked up high-energy gamma rays from Markarian 421.
Astrophysicists believe they are cooked up in the jet by superfast
particles. As electrons and protons spiral around the jet's strong
magnetic fields, they emit powerful radiation. They could also be
colliding with ordinary photons, boosting them to ultra-high energies.

But it wasn't until March 1997 that astronomers saw what a blazar can
do when it really flexes its muscles. They watched astonished as
Markarian 501 flared up from one of the puniest gamma-ray sources in
the sky to upstage even the Crab Nebula, the debris of an exploded
star
in our own galactic backyard, which is the brightest steady gamma
source in the sky. The outburst lasted several months, and at its peak
Markarian 501 was ten times as bright as the Crab, despite being 50
000
times farther away. &quot;The distance difference is just mind-blowing,&quot;
says Vslk, a director at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics
in Heidelberg.

Air shower

Vslk is a spokesman for an experiment called HEGRA (High Energy Gamma
Ray Astronomy), which kept its eye on Markarian 501's storm from La
Palma, in the Canary Islands. When a high-energy gamma ray hits the
upper atmosphere, it sparks an &quot;air shower&quot; -- a spreading cascade of
superfast subatomic particles. These emit light, and because they move
faster than the speed of light in air their emissions pile up into
blue
flashes known as Cerenkov radiation -- just as sound waves from
supersonic aircraft pile up into a sonic boom.

During 501's outburst, HEGRA's six big mirrors saw astoundingly bright
blue flashes. These indicated that some of 501's gamma rays had
energies of up to 22 teraelectronvolts (Astronomy and Astrophysics,
vol
349, p 11). This is trillions of times as much as a photon of visible
light, which has an energy between 1 and 3 electronvolts.

What is hard to explain is why the gamma rays made it to Earth. When a
high-energy gamma ray and an infrared photon collide, they have enough
energy to mutate into an electron and a positron. So the gamma rays
should be gradually mopped up by the sea of far-infrared photons that
fills space, emitted by forming stars and hot dust.

How far the gamma rays get depends on how many far-infrared photons
are
out there. In the past two years, several teams of scientists have
taken old images from NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)
satellite and the European Space Agency's Infrared Space Observatory
(ISO) and used some novel mathematical tricks to cancel out the
infrared from our own Solar System and Galaxy. The results show that
the far-infrared background is so bright that gamma rays with energies
of more than 10 teraelectronvolts should never reach the Earth from as
far away as Markarian 501. So why did we see them?

Perhaps the gamma rays are colluding against us, says Peter Biermann,
an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in
Bonn. He and his colleagues suggest that several gamma rays from
Markarian 501 might merge into a Bose-Einstein condensate -- a densely
packed globule of lower-energy photons that have exactly the same
positions.

This should happen to light from a super-efficient laser -- one far
more efficient than any yet built on Earth. Nature does build lasers:
in many active galaxies, X-rays make clouds of water vapour emit
microwave laser light. The Universe is dotted with billions of these
microwave lasers, or &quot;masers&quot;. But is a natural, super-efficient,
ultra-
high energy laser plausible? Biermann claims that it could conceivably
happen when a group of excited atoms in a blazar's jet all stimulate
each other to emit light at the same time (Astrophysical Journal
Letters, vol 524, p 91).

Say the blazar fired out a Bose-Einstein condensate of 20 identical
gamma rays with energies of 1 teraelectronvolt each. Because these
photons have relatively low energy, they would be unimpeded by the
far-
infrared background. Arriving together in the Earth's atmosphere, they ...
