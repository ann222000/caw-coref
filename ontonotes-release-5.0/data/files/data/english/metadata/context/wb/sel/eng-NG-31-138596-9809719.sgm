To hear scholars tell it, Africa is the center and the beginning of
humankind, dating back 200,000 or more years. Africa, they contend,
was the home to well structured and well organized city-states,
thriving empires and unique Kingdoms. The works of Toyin Falola, Ali
Mazrui, Festus Ohaegbulam, Basil Davidson, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and
J. F. Ade Ajayi all supports these assertions. Furthermore, it was the
work of these and other Africanists that helped dispel the insidious
inference that Africa had no history and contributed nothing to
civilizations. Along that continuum was the thinking in Europe, which
posited that Africa was &quot;nothing but the unrewarding gyrations of
barbarous tribes.&quot; Back then, Europe and the New World never thought
much of Africans. And they still don't. Oddly, Africans themselves
don't think much of their land and their people.

Africans themselves don't think much of themselves, their peoples and
their land, and have, for the most part, contributed to the continuing
underdevelopment, chaos and anarchy that have come to characterize the
continent. Long before the Trans-Atlantic and the Indian Ocean slave
trade, Africans have been trading and dehumanizing their own peoples.
Call it servitude or call it indenturedness, slavery is slavery: the
long term exploitation, maltreatment and dehumanization of another
human being. It's been more than one hundred and ten years since
formal slavery ended, but one might not know this as a sizeable number
of Africans are still involved in dehumanizing their fellow Africans.
No group is guiltier of this than African Presidents and the political/
economic elites.

Beginning in the 1960s, in one country after another, African
Presidents and Prime Ministers have been physically chaining and
mentally abusing their own people. What's more, they collaborate with
foreign and domestic agents and saboteurs to loot their own resources.
Not only are these leaders involved in enslaving their own people,
they are also involved in the economic exploitation of the continent.
Africans are doing to Africa what despicable Europeans did to Africa
from the 14th century onward. Essentially, slavery and the economic
exploitation of the continent have not ended. It is in full force now.
After slavery was colonialism which formally began after the Berlin
Conference hosted by Otto von Bismarck and attended by major European
powers, notably Britain, France, Belgium and Portugal -- from November
1884 through February 1885.

History shows that the scramble for Africa was necessitated by
commercial greed, territorial ambition, Christendom and proselytism,
reckless adventures, and political rivalry. Today, European and other
western powers need not plan for the partitioning and looting of the
continent. No. African leaders and African elites have been doing the
partitioning and economic exploitation on behalf of these Powers. In
recent years -- under the guise of the Cold War -- the continent was
overran and overtaken by the East and the West. Since the end of the
Cold War, the continent continues to be overtaken and overran by
foreign powers; only this time, other powers are involved in the
exploitation and enslavement of Africa. The Chinese, the Israelis, the
Indians, the Lebanese and every other big, small and inconsequential
Power are all roaming the African woodland, digging into the African
soil for minerals, and exploring the oceans and waterways for
treasures. Former colonial powerhouses never left; they have the
continent in the palm of their hands. Vultures, big and small, have
descended on Africa.

For the old and new powerhouses, Africa has become their playground,
their dumpster, their killing field, their Wall Street, and their spit-
bucket. While the Vultures are feeding off of the fat and riches of
the continent, Africans themselves -- much like some of their
forefathers -- are on the sideline as though watching a freak show.
There is nothing freakish about what is happening to Africa and
Africans. There is nothing amusing about five hundred years of
exploitation, servility and bastardization. At home and overseas, the
vast majorities of Africans are slaves and hired hands; and in most
cases, are treated like dirty rags. Blacks in the Caribbean, Blacks in
Africa, and Blacks in the United States, as with Blacks everywhere,
all suffers the same fate: second class citizens to be used and
exploited and discarded. More so in Africa -- they allow themselves to
be used, exploited and discarded like spent dolls.

Social historians and chroniclers of events in and around the
continent cannot but notice the fact that the average Africans give
their leaders the permission to exploit and abuse and to steal and
mismanage their resources. In country after country, African leaders
steal and commit all sorts of crimes and iniquities with the full
acquiesce of their people. In turn, African leaders green-light
foreign powers and foreign entrepreneurs the power to exploit,
subjugate, and to steal their continent's resources. From Tunisia to
South Africa, from Nigeria to Djibouti, and from Mauritania to
Tanzania, the reality of the continent is the same: lacking in
economic power, lacking in technological know-how, and also lacking in
political will. What's more, Africans seem to lack commonsense, sense
of purpose and sense of self. Otherwise, why would they allow their
leaders, and outsiders, to basically mess with their continent and
their destiny? What rationale people would allow such?

One need not dig deep into the mind of White Americans and their
European counterparts to know what they think of Africans. You know
it, and I know it, too: people incapable of common task and unable to
solve complicated tasks. The residual effects of slavery are very much
in evident. Beyond the lingering effects of slavery, there are the
delayed effects of colonization vis-à-vis economic, political,
cultural, social and psychological. For instance, &quot;Political
instability, border disputes, ethnic suspicion and primordial fear,
economic ruin, and massive debt continue to plague Africa.&quot; We have a
continent that is being plundered every which way by every body. We
have a people that do not care about their land. And because of the
people's attitude towards their land, we now have a land that has
become the world's whore -- to be used and abused and toyed with and
then discard without much thought.

As an African, one cannot think of Africa and not cry. One cannot
visit the continent and not feel depressed. Sure, there are moments of
pride and joy and euphoria. There are moments when it feels good to be
Black and African; there are moments when some aspects of the African
culture makes ones soul sing and dance; there are moments when being
an African, is the damn best thing in the whole wide world. Truly, to
be an African is a privilege. The blessings and the pride is
boundless. But there are many more moments when it sucks -- truly
sucks and irritating -- to be Black and African. The African continent
has been severely impacted by several factors: slavery, colonialism
and neo-colonialism, the Cold War, globalization, self-immolating
leadership and the mental and physical abuse of Africans by their own
leaders. How to wiggle out of the current and residual effects of the
aforementioned are some of the challenges young Africans will have to
contend with in the 21st century; otherwise, it may take five hundred
years before there is noticeable progress in the continent.

Sabella's account exemplifies Afro-Pessimism in search of critical perspectives! For instance, he writes that &quot;Africans themselves don't think much of themselves, their peoples and their land, and have, for the most part, contributed to the continuing underdevelopment, chaos and anarchy that have come to characterize the continent.&quot;

Admittedly, I am afraid to write about the depredations of slavery, colonialism, neocolonialism here, but it seems to me that our frustrations, regarding the state of Africa today, cloud our abilities to ably frame and appreciate the challenges facing African states. The application of comparative history would rescue us from our frustrations-induced Afro-Pessimism.

Paradoxically, we measure the growth of &quot;infant&quot; African states with the very &quot;established “societies that had aborted our growth and benefitted immensely from exploiting us. As a Ghanaian, I am very proud of what Ghanaians, etc. have been able to achieve in the last 51 years or so of independence! Call me &quot;Afro-Optimist&quot; and I would tell you where Afro-Pessimism lives: compare 51 years of postcolonial self-renewal with the histories of the states and societies that serve as our measuring-rods and you would laugh all the way to the camp of Afro-Optimists!

Kwabena:

Which kain arunkushanka talk be dis? Why are you
afraid to write about these things here? Because there
are Africans who, having signed up for membership of a
forum convened by one of Africa's most famous
historians, have declared history and memory dead and
rush out with cutlasses and langalangas every time
they hear the stubborn words slavery, colonialism, and
neocolonialism? When did such feelings about history
begin to dictate what we are able to write here? I
didn't get the memo.

By the way, when did Henry Louis Gates become an
Africanist? I noticed that the author of the original
article smuggled him into his list of Africanists.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;dear kwabena et al
">

i wonder if the problem you are addressing
doesn't lie with the notion of african
exceptionalism. i am opposed to notions of
progress, except in the narrowest of
technological meanings. as a result, i don't see
differences between states and peoples as marking
a continuum of less or more developed, as more or
less advanced in a progressivist model. rather, i
think of states as more or less powerful or
wealthy, as more or less able to exercise control
over other states and over their own territories.
the more powerful states have used their power
when economic exegencies have encouraged them to
do so. and in that use, they conquered and abused the conquered.
is there any place on earth, and time in history,
where this has not been the case? africa's roles
in slavery, colonialism, neocolonialism, do not
represent some exceptional historical experience.
in some places, the damage to the conquered was
worse, in some cases less violent or oppressive.
but the thinking and acting along the lines of
force were the same when circumstances permitted.
that's why slavery was universal in the past; and
it's why the forms of economic exploitation or
domination today are only variants of that past.

there is no more reason, then, for afro-pessimism
than for euro-pessimism or americano-pessimism.
after all, we in the west have the power to
control the world, and see how it is being deployed and misused.

as for those less powerful, to blame them for
their condition is to pretend it occurs and occurred in a vacuum.
so, for example, the wonderful development and
progress of american society can be taken as such
only if we ignore the horrendous conquest and
destruction of the native american population,
those whose lives are now marked by the failures
of being conquered. who should feel pessimism
over this? the conquered? the dominated? and if
you want to say, that was all in the past, then
ask yourself the question about how conditions in
the present are still generating relationships of domination and power.

a brief example of non-exceptionalism, democracy.
right now we lament the violence in kenya arising
over an apparently stolen election. i live in
michigan where we have a senate controlled by the
republicans, 55%. however, in the last election,
they garnered only 45% of the vote. how did they
do this? they stole it legally by gerrymandering.
kif kif. only, the one is termed savage, the other democratic.

sorry for the lengthy response: my concern is
with african exceptionalism: africans should not
idealize the past, nor blame themselves for the
present. we are all collectively engaged in
relations of power, and i don't see why we should
feel one group is intrinsically different from any other.

Come on , Pius.?Be a good sport.?I walked into Hotel Presidential, Port Harcourt , with a friend not too long ago. A register of guests was shoved at us. My friend filled in as &quot;Chief XYZ&quot;, and pushed the register to me.?I saw his name with the Chief before it, and he winked at me. Later I asked him why the masquerade, and he smiled cynically. &quot;What if there is something to gain and I lose it because I am not a chief? I looked at all the names before mine and almost every guest was a chief !!! What did you want me to do?&quot; I understood and laughed in my own?belated epiphany.Thereby hangs a tale. So leave Henry Louis Gates alone. He is indeed an Africanist...

Pius:

Sometimes arunkushanka or buga buga talk is meant as a sarcastic jolt! Obviously, colonialism is now seen as an interlude without any consequence in African history. We have happily bought what our time-honored detractors want us to believe: Africans with or without colonialism, etc. are hopeless, indeed, incapable of any measure of human achievements. Not long ago African universities were being juxtaposed with the Oxfords and the Cambridges! I have not said that we can't do better! Yes, we can! Oh, Barack Obama has conscientized me with his popular refrain of yes we can. My simple point is that Africa will come of age and don't need the condescending praise-songs of Afro-Pessimists.

“Africanist titles” are a part of the cottage industry of Africa-area studies, and we can all assume such titles. You have people who have never been to any African market, but write about African market women and hence are called specialists and seen as consultants! At least, Prof. Henry Louis Gates had traveled across Africa with modern cameras that recounted the stories of the Mungo Parks and the David Livingstones. I would say that let him keep his Africanist title!

Kwabena:

Which kain arunkushanka talk be dis? Why are you
afraid to write about these things here? Because there
are Africans who, having signed up for membership of a
forum convened by one of Africa's most famous
historians, have declared history and memory dead and
rush out with cutlasses and langalangas every time
they hear the stubborn words slavery, colonialism, and
neocolonialism? When did such feelings about history
begin to dictate what we are able to write here? I
didn't get the memo.

By the way, when did Henry Louis Gates become an
Africanist? I noticed that the author of the original
article smuggled him into his list of Africanists.

Oga Kwabena:

We should distinguish between the anxieties and frustrations of
Afro-pessimism and those of Afro-optimism. Sabella's pessimistic and
self-deprecatory generalizations about Africa and about what Africans think
of themselves and their continent are a showcase for the former. Pius
Adesanmi's and my own frustrations and unease are those of Afro-optimists
who want to stress African responsibility alongside the familiar story of
the continent's travails in the hands of predatory Euro-American forces.

I hope you are not telling us that inconvenient &quot;quotidian details&quot; of the
African postcolonial condition do not intrude into your Afro-optimist
vision, nibbling at your mental edifice of hope and redemption. You
can confess this objective recognition of the &quot;supply side&quot; of the African
bad news industry while remaining grounded in a nuanced understanding of the
multiple external complicities that have interpellated Africa into its
present political and economic state.

Any African, optimist or not, who does not acknowledge that their optimism
is ocassionally challenged by what Pius calls Africa's generous production
of negative headlines is not being sincere. The difference between such an
honest assessment of the anxieties and instabilities of Afro-optimism and
Sabella's unrestrained indictment of the continent and its people lies in
the fact that the former perspective does not ignore the global
intertwinements and entanglements that contribute to African adversities.

&gt; To hear scholars tell it, Africa is the center and the beginning of
&gt; humankind, dating back 200,000 or more years. Africa, they contend,
&gt; was the home to well structured and well organized city-states,
&gt; thriving empires and unique Kingdoms. The works of Toyin Falola, Ali
&gt; Mazrui, Festus Ohaegbulam, Basil Davidson, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and
&gt; J. F. Ade Ajayi all supports these assertions. Furthermore, it was the
&gt; work of these and other Africanists that helped dispel the insidious
&gt; inference that Africa had no history and contributed nothing to
&gt; civilizations. Along that continuum was the thinking in Europe, which
&gt; posited that Africa was &quot;nothing but the unrewarding gyrations of
&gt; barbarous tribes.&quot; Back then, Europe and the New World never thought
&gt; much of Africans. And they still don't. Oddly, Africans themselves
&gt; don't think much of their land and their people.

&gt; Africans themselves don't think much of themselves, their peoples and
&gt; their land, and have, for the most part, contributed to the continuing
&gt; underdevelopment, chaos and anarchy that have come to characterize the
&gt; continent. Long before the Trans-Atlantic and the Indian Ocean slave
&gt; trade, Africans have been trading and dehumanizing their own peoples.
&gt; Call it servitude or call it indenturedness, slavery is slavery: the
&gt; long term exploitation, maltreatment and dehumanization of another
&gt; human being. It's been more than one hundred and ten years since
&gt; formal slavery ended, but one might not know this as a sizeable number
&gt; of Africans are still involved in dehumanizing their fellow Africans.
&gt; No group is guiltier of this than African Presidents and the political/
&gt; economic elites.

&gt; Beginning in the 1960s, in one country after another, African
&gt; Presidents and Prime Ministers have been physically chaining and
&gt; mentally abusing their own people. What's more, they collaborate with
&gt; foreign and domestic agents and saboteurs to loot their own resources.
&gt; Not only are these leaders involved in enslaving their own people,
&gt; they are also involved in the economic exploitation of the continent.
&gt; Africans are doing to Africa what despicable Europeans did to Africa
&gt; from the 14th century onward. Essentially, slavery and the economic
&gt; exploitation of the continent have not ended. It is in full force now.
&gt; After slavery was colonialism which formally began after the Berlin
&gt; Conference hosted by Otto von Bismarck and attended by major European
&gt; powers, notably Britain, France, Belgium and Portugal -- from November
&gt; 1884 through February 1885.

&gt; History shows that the scramble for Africa was necessitated by
&gt; commercial greed, territorial ambition, Christendom and proselytism,
&gt; reckless adventures, and political rivalry. Today, European and other
&gt; western powers need not plan for the partitioning and looting of the
&gt; continent. No. African leaders and African elites have been doing the
&gt; partitioning and economic exploitation on behalf of these Powers. In
&gt; recent years -- under the guise of the Cold War -- the continent was
&gt; overran and overtaken by the East and the West. Since the end of the
&gt; Cold War, the continent continues to be overtaken and overran by
&gt; foreign powers; only this time, other powers are involved in the
&gt; exploitation and enslavement of Africa. The Chinese, the Israelis, the
&gt; Indians, the Lebanese and every other big, small and inconsequential
&gt; Power are all roaming the African woodland, digging into the African
&gt; soil for minerals, and exploring the oceans and waterways for
&gt; treasures. Former colonial powerhouses never left; they have the
&gt; continent in the palm of their hands. Vultures, big and small, have
&gt; descended on Africa.

&gt; For the old and new powerhouses, Africa has become their playground,
&gt; their dumpster, their killing field, their Wall Street, and their spit-
&gt; bucket. While the Vultures are feeding off of the fat and riches of
&gt; the continent, Africans themselves -- much like some of their
&gt; forefathers -- are on the sideline as though watching a freak show.
&gt; There is nothing freakish about what is happening to Africa and
&gt; Africans. There is nothing amusing about five hundred years of
&gt; exploitation, servility and bastardization. At home and overseas, the
&gt; vast majorities of Africans are slaves and hired hands; and in most
&gt; cases, are treated like dirty rags. Blacks in the Caribbean, Blacks in
&gt; Africa, and Blacks in the United States, as with Blacks everywhere,
&gt; all suffers the same fate: second class citizens to be used and
&gt; exploited and discarded. More so in Africa -- they allow themselves to
&gt; be used, exploited and discarded like spent dolls.

&gt; Social historians and chroniclers of events in and around the
&gt; continent cannot but notice the fact that the average Africans give
&gt; their leaders the permission to exploit and abuse and to steal and
&gt; mismanage their resources. In country after country, African leaders
&gt; steal and commit all sorts of crimes and iniquities with the full
&gt; acquiesce of their people. In turn, African leaders green-light
&gt; foreign powers and foreign entrepreneurs the power to exploit,
&gt; subjugate, and to steal their continent's resources. From Tunisia to
&gt; South Africa, from Nigeria to Djibouti, and from Mauritania to
&gt; Tanzania, the reality of the continent is the same: lacking in
&gt; economic power, lacking in technological know-how, and also lacking in
&gt; political will. What's more, Africans seem to lack commonsense, sense
&gt; of purpose and sense of self. Otherwise, why would they allow their
&gt; leaders, and outsiders, to basically mess with their continent and
&gt; their destiny? What rationale people would allow such?

&gt; One need not dig deep into the mind of White Americans and their
&gt; European counterparts to know what they think of Africans. You know
&gt; it, and I know it, too: people incapable of common task and unable to
&gt; solve complicated tasks. The residual effects of slavery are very much
&gt; in evident. Beyond the lingering effects of slavery, there are the
&gt; delayed effects of colonization vis-à-vis economic, political,
&gt; cultural, social and psychological. For instance, &quot;Political
&gt; instability, border disputes, ethnic suspicion and primordial fear,
&gt; economic ruin, and massive debt continue to plague Africa.&quot; We have a
&gt; continent that is being plundered every which way by every body. We
&gt; have a people that do not care about their land. And because of the
&gt; people's attitude towards their land, we now have a land that has
&gt; become the world's whore -- to

Good Evening, Professor Akurang-Parry:
Pessimistic? Well, that is not a label that is ever going to stick on
me. How do you write about Africa, how do you teach Africa, and how do
you comment about Africa - Africa of the last fifty years -- in an
optimistic way? You grudge my position primarily on the ground that
&quot;&quot;Africans themselves don't think much of themselves, their peoples
and their land, and have, for the most part, contributed to the
continuing underdevelopment, chaos and anarchy that have come to
characterize the continent.&quot; Sir, on what basis are you going to fault
me.

I am not going to regurgitate my position as to why Africa is
stagnant, or slow-moving. I have made my position clear in my other
writings and speeches. For whatever reason, some scholars have been
touting &quot;Africa's gain and progress&quot; within the last ten or so years.
Here is what I think: they are being overly optimistic, and also
engage in duplicitous exaggerations. These scholars and commentators
see what is not observable; they engage in romanticism, and also
peddle lies.

It is true that in one or two countries, there are ant-size gains.
That's about it. Data and real-life observations do not give me joy --
be it in Ghana, Senegal or Botswana. If you want to fault my language,
that's fine; but not my gist. The &quot;problem&quot; with me is that my writing
style does not allow me to cuddle, stroke egos, or to appease African
leaders and their agents. Save for two or three, African leaders all
deserve to be shot, hanged or skinned for what they have done and
continue to do to the continent and its peoples.
Cordially,
Mr. Sabella Abidde

Citizen Sabella Abidde,
You do not need to sound like &quot;Good Evening Professor Akurang-Perry,&quot; Sir,&quot;
&quot;Cordially,&quot; etc.
The level of erudition and intellect consistently demonstrated in your
prolific writings here does not qualify you to discuss as an underdog.
I have a 25-year old PhD and I interact with mates, elders and kids out here
without such protocol, except basic human respect.
You articulate your own views on Africa, you have a right to them and guess
what, you are not alone, many Africans concur with your views.
Indeed, this USAAfricaDialogue discussion group is gradually becoming
one-sided in actors and in opinions.
Perhaps this is due to Toyin's one-man moderation style which often rejects
many related submissions that, naturally, would have modulated the glee with
which some folks gloat here on incomplete intellectual outlook, brandished
as the main cause and solution to Africa's myriad problems. Dunno, maybe it
is something else.

It is a tired supposition to view, analyze and solve modern African problems
only in terms of effects of colonization. This view is packaged
surreptitiously as Afro-optimism by its peddlers.
But the position is weak, unedifying and especially patronizing to the
capability and integrity of contemporary Africa.  The position is almost in
cahoots with the concept of fatalism. What hurts me the most personally, in
particular, is that some of these &quot;self-styled&quot; Afro-optimists teach this
kind of misleading academic opinion to young minds, white and black.

The effects of slavery and colonization of Africa are enormous, no doubt.
But 100 years hence end-of-slavery and some 50 years after colonization, the
problems of  modern Africa are not due to the white man's burdens on Africa
alone, anymore. Some remain as post-traumatic effects of
slavery/colonization, while many more are effects of crimes of subjugation
and impoverishment by Africans on Africans. The later is called &quot;personal
responsibility&quot; and the so-called Afro-optimists do not seem to care for it
or even acknowledge it.

If I started writing out here about my proficiency in &quot;the stoichiometric
mole ratio calculations in chemical reactions of both atomic and nuclear
electrons as profiled by Schrödinger's equation constants....&quot; would that
make any sense against the current state of Science and Technology in
Africa? That is exactly the problem with all the esoteric socio-political
textbook expressions that some of our brothers use out here. Expressions
such as &quot; quotidian details,&quot; &quot;periodization of events in Africa&quot; etc, are
meaningless to most of the current reality in Africa. They are nonsense.
These are mere ostentatious clichés that have no relevance to the true cause
and potential cure of many a today Africa problem. They have no use to the
current carnage in post-election Kenya. What is solving Kenya's problems
eventually is not sticking out our butts in Nairobi (or Washington DC) and
pointing fingers toward the West. What is solving Kenyan problems is
Africans agreeing to work together, curb their greed for absolute power for
life, form a government of unity and trying out moving their peoples forward
once again.

It is what it is for Africa. Slavery and Colonization have happened in our
history and their effects have been devastating. We don't have to forget,
but we can choose to move on as a race.
We have to. We can't wind the clock back.
One prominent lasting but unwanted effect of colonization of Africa is how
today countries have been arbitrarily carved in the 19th century for a much
more different purpose than for the purpose they need to serve today. But so
were Asia and the Middle East carved.  Some of these have made sense out of
the senseless foreign intervention in their history. Nigeria or Kenya can
choose to make sense out of theirs and live it out as countries or break up
into a thousand more problematic pieces.

For every African who sheepishly proclaims satisfaction with the current
level of progress in his country 50 years after flag independence, there are
probably a thousand who are not and are outraged.  There are simple human
development indices that we all can see and use for a more accurate and
sincere evaluation of our state of well-being or lack of it. This evaluation
should be dispassionate and should have nothing to do with the dubious
polemics about &quot;West definition of progress.&quot;  I, as an African, want to
live in a house that has electricity, I don't want to live in the dark. I
want potable water and good health care. I also want to have education in
today global world. I would like to live a life that gives me the
opportunity to pursue a happy life. That is not what I've got today.
Prevalence of communicable diseases that have been eradicated in many parts
of the larger world, such as water borne (guinea worm, cholera, etc),
air-borne (meningitis, etc) are still my bane in Africa. Other basic human
requirements such as good governance, electricity, potable water, food
security, even hope are beyond my reach in 2008 Africa.  These are problems
that Africa should be brave enough to own as her responsibility.

When government aficionados loot all the state funds, adequate money would
not be left for good governance let alone available for provision of basic
human needs such as water, electricity, health care, education and police.
Why should we have to hold the 100-year old slavery responsible for that?
There are post-traumatic effects of slavery and colonization that continue
to dog Africa.
But there is also personal responsibility that Africa must bear for poor
governance, greed and aggrandizement, people impoverishment and senseless
wars.
To continue to deny or ignore this under the guise of Afro-optimism is
misleading, unedifying and insulting to Africans.

Best wishes, my brother.

Progress

Good Evening, Professor Akurang-Parry:
Pessimistic? Well, that is not a label that is ever going to stick on
me. How do you write about Africa, how do you teach Africa, and how do
you comment about Africa - Africa of the last fifty years -- in an
optimistic way? You grudge my position primarily on the ground that
&quot;&quot;Africans themselves don't think much of themselves, their peoples
and their land, and have, for the most part, contributed to the
continuing underdevelopment, chaos and anarchy that have come to
characterize the continent.&quot; Sir, on what basis are you going to fault
me.

I am not going to regurgitate my position as to why Africa is
stagnant, or slow-moving. I have made my position clear in my other
writings and speeches. For whatever reason, some scholars have been
touting &quot;Africa's gain and progress&quot; within the last ten or so years.
Here is what I think: they are being overly optimistic, and also
engage in duplicitous exaggerations. These scholars and commentators
see what is not observable; they engage in romanticism, and also
peddle lies.

It is true that in one or two countries, there are ant-size gains.
That's about it. Data and real-life observations do not give me joy --
be it in Ghana, Senegal or Botswana. If you want to fault my language,
that's fine; but not my gist. The &quot;problem&quot; with me is that my writing
style does not allow me to cuddle, stroke egos, or to appease African
leaders and their agents. Save for two or three, African leaders all
deserve to be shot, hanged or skinned for what they have done and
continue to do to the continent and its peoples.
Cordially,
Mr. Sabella Abidde

&gt; I hope you are not telling us that inconvenient &quot;quotidian details&quot; of the
&gt; African postcolonial condition do not intrude into your Afro-optimist

&gt; can confess this objective recognition of the &quot;supply side&quot; of the African
&gt; bad news industry while remaining grounded in a nuanced understanding of
the
&gt; multiple external complicities that have interpellated Africa into its
&gt; present political and economic state.

&gt; Any African, optimist or not, who does not acknowledge that their optimism
&gt; is ocassionally challenged by what Pius calls Africa's generous production
&gt; of negative headlines is not being sincere. The difference between such an
&gt; honest assessment of the anxieties and instabilities of Afro-optimism and
&gt; Sabella's unrestrained indictment of the continent and its people lies in
&gt; the fact that the former perspective does not ignore the global

I think everyone who has commented on this debate have their valid points.  I quite appreciate Akurang Perry's, comparative historical perspective since I am basically a comparatist by training, and i would like to explore some issues along the line

Has anyone considered the real prize of the Chinese miracle which commenced with the Detente started by Nixon and Zhou Enlai?  Many Chinese people today complain about enslavement by their government in a bid to &quot;catch up with the West&quot;.  They complain about whole swathes of the countryside being demolished and taken over by their own capitalist noveau rich.  That was the price ordinary Chinese had to pay for twenty years of continuous surplus trade relations with the West.

Visit corruption: This forum debated Congressman Jefferson's involvement in scandalous cash dealings recovered in a refrigerator.  The subject of probe has been properly indicted.  Over the past two years, operations Tennessee Waltz had been in progress against legislators indicted for corrupt enrichment and backhanders (both black and white) in that state.  Some culprits have actually been sentenced.  I would like people who are not very intimate with the history of the United States to look up the word &quot;Carpetbaggers&quot; and trace its history.  It did not happen in Africa.  Of, course the profits were not siphoned to Africa.

Do we really know how many citizens of the West take their cue on the shop floors being equally exploited and working in slave conditions to produce the &quot;progress&quot; of these countries, alongside the Africans from the diaspora?

And are we aware not &quot;all&quot; Africans working in the West were subject to these dehumanizaing exploitation before making it to the level of the intelligentsia in such countries, and part of this forum?

And are we also aware that all so called great nations have in the past enslaved their own people as well as others (and are still doing so in various guises)?

This is therefore a cautionary note against generalizations, and against essentializations of the African condition.  Certain systems are constructed to produce oppressors and the oppressed. Analysis upon analysis on this forum alone show clearly that certain events happened beginning in the late seventies and peaked in the late eighties /early nineties and resulted in a complicity of forces to lay the continent prostrate.  Optimists have a point in noting that until the last few years there was no real injection of funds to galvanize a quick recovery as was the case in the Marshall Plan.  Pessimists also have a point in observing that too much corruption, given the meagre level of resources, is frittering away whatever modicum of progress is anticipated.

Let us all put all our hope in true democrcay; meaning accountability to the people.  This does not mean any nation on earth would be short of characters trying to defraud the common purse; only this process of probity will ensure they never get away with it and comparatively, with time, lower the incidence of people willing to give it a go.

Dunno, maybe it&gt; is something else.&gt; &gt; It is a tired supposition to view, analyze and solve modern African problems&gt; only in terms of effects of colonization. This view is packaged&gt; surreptitiously as Afro-optimism by its peddlers.&gt; But the position is weak, unedifying and especially patronizing to the&gt; capability and integrity of contemporary Africa. The position is almost in&gt; cahoots with the concept of fatalism. What hurts me the most personally, in&gt; particular, is that some of these &quot;self-styled&quot; Afro-optimists teach this&gt; kind of misleading academic opinion to young minds, white and black.&gt; &gt; The effects of slavery and colonization of Africa are enormous, no doubt.&gt; But 100 years hence end-of-slavery and some 50 years after colonization, the&gt; problems of modern Africa are not due to the white man's burdens on Africa&gt; alone, anymore. Some remain as post-traumatic effects of&gt; slavery/colonization, while many more are effects of crimes of subjugation&gt; and impoverishment by Africans on Africans. The later is called &quot;personal&gt; responsibility&quot; and the so-called Afro-optimists do not seem to care for it&gt; or even acknowledge it. &gt; &gt; If I started writing out here about my proficiency in &quot;the stoichiometric&gt; mole ratio calculations in chemical reactions of both atomic and nuclear&gt; electrons as profiled by Schrödinger's equation constants....&quot; would that&gt; make any sense against the current state of Science and Technology in&gt; Africa? That is exactly the problem with all the esoteric socio-political&gt; textbook expressions that some of our brothers use out here. Expressions&gt; such as &quot; quotidian details,&quot; &quot;periodization of events in Africa&quot; etc, are&gt; meaningless to most of the current reality in Africa. They are nonsense.&gt; These are mere ostentatious clichés that have no relevance to the true cause&gt; and potential cure of many a today Africa problem. They have no use to the&gt; current carnage in post-election Kenya. What is solving Kenya's problems&gt; eventually is not sticking out our butts in Nairobi (or Washington DC) and&gt; pointing fingers toward the West. What is solving Kenyan problems is&gt; Africans agreeing to work together, curb their greed for absolute power for&gt; life, form a government of unity and trying out moving their peoples forward&gt; once again. &gt; &gt; It is what it is for Africa. Slavery and Colonization have happened in our&gt; history and their effects have been devastating. We don't have to forget,&gt; but we can choose to move on as a race. &gt; We have to. We can't wind the clock back.&gt; One prominent lasting but unwanted effect of colonization of Africa is how&gt; today countries have been arbitrarily carved in the 19th century for a much&gt; more different purpose than for the purpose they need to serve today. But so&gt; were Asia and the Middle East carved. Some of these have made sense out of&gt; the senseless foreign intervention in their history. Nigeria or Kenya can&gt; choose to make sense out of theirs and live it out as countries or break up&gt; into a thousand more problematic pieces. &gt; &gt; For every African who sheepishly proclaims satisfaction with the current&gt; level of progress in his country 50 years after flag independence, there are&gt; probably a thousand who are not and are outraged. There are simple human&gt; development indices that we all can see and use for a more accurate and&gt; sincere evaluation of our state of well-being or lack of it. This evaluation&gt; should be dispassionate and should have nothing to do with the dubious&gt; polemics about &quot;West definition of progress.&quot; I, as an African, want to&gt; live in a house that has electricity, I don't want to live in the dark. I&gt; want potable water and good health care. I also want to have education in&gt; today global world. I would like to live a life that gives me the&gt; opportunity to pursue a happy life. That is not what I've got today.&gt; Prevalence of communicable diseases that have been eradicated in many parts&gt; of the larger world, such as water borne (guinea worm, cholera, etc),&gt; air-borne (meningitis, etc) are still my bane in Africa.
