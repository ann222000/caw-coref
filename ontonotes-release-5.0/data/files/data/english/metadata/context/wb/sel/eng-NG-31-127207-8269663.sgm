... well, depends on who you're referring to:

o by ESPN and the media, in general, in addi-
tion to by quite a few sports fans, harassed,

o by Cowboys fans, under-appreciated, a re-
sult of both the above, the following, and
the inability of many fans to 'get over' T.O.'s
supposedly 'sacriligious' prance on the star
(when a 49er),

o by Bill Parcells, under-used -and- to varying
degrees, under-appreciated as exhibited
by the manner Bill refused to call T.O. by
name, refused to get T.O. engaged early
in most games, refused to call crossing
routes T.O. had excelled in with other teams,
commented (after resigning) that the T.O.
signing was *not* a decision he agreed with
(in essence, confirming what everyone al-
ready knew, that T.O. was *not* and would
*never be* a so-called 'Parcells player'),
and refused to comment with any concern
whatsoever regarding the report of T.O.'s
supposed suicide attempt.

Last year, despite playing with a lingering
finger injury that would've sent many players
to the sidelines, T.O. *led the league* in TDs,
-and- should've, per the following, represented
the Cowboys in the Pro Bowl:

Excerpt:

... Owens led the NFL in touchdown recep-
tions (13), yet wasn't invited to Hawaii for
the Pro Bowl. Anquan Boldin, Donald Driver,
Torry Holt and Roy Williams [Lions] were
deserving, but Owens (1,180 receiving yards)
should have been picked over Steve Smith
(1,166, 8 TDs). ...

--- end excerpt ---

By the way, regarding T.O. the person and
player, Tony Romo appreciated what he
brought to the team last year, and after
that Seattle debacle, T.O. was among
Tony's biggest supporters / defenders,
both in private and public.

How many crucial passes did drop while under Bill Parcells management? It
was Deion Sanders turf toe all over again.

Fact is T.O., while he may be a top 5, needs to show up this year and not
drop crucial passes. I hope he shines. I really do. I think every Cowboy fan
wants him to shine.

Even among the dropped passes, and there sure were a bunch of 'em, he shined
at times last year.

Frankly, I'd still rather he not be on the team, but as he is, I surely hope
he plays up to his billing, his own self image and the potential that
obviously is still there.

If he does, it opens up a lot for other skill players and even makes the OL
job a bit easier, and could lead to a fun season.

We'll soon see.

Everyone here knows I was thrilled to get TO last year

He is like Michael Irvin but only with incredible speed

Parcell's treatment of him, if true, was ludicrous, not addressing him
by name

I think he will have a great season

He may be trouble but let's remember that football is a violent game
and these guys are not choir boys
