Hi Group,

I'm trying to access Google Maps through a wrapped ActiveX browser
(I.E. 6 in a proprietary 3rd party application). I keep getting the
JavaScript error: &quot;Object doesn't support this property or method&quot;
when calling new GMap2(document.getElementById(&quot;map&quot;));

It works perfectly in a standalone browser.

Anyone got any idea what I method/properties I might need to set in
the ActiveX wrapper to get it to work?

And yes before you point it out I am aware that this is outside of the
terms of standard google maps API, however I am running on the 30-day
trial of the Enterprise API, and I'm still awaiting a response from
the Google help. If this doesn't work then it's not really useful for
us.

Regards,

Mark Henderson

The Google Maps API certainly should work in an ActiveX IE6/7. As it happens
I was just looking at one of my test map apps in an ActiveX.

The excellent Directory Opus program includes an HTML viewer which uses the
IE ActiveX. If you browse to a Google Maps API HTML file in Opus, it
displays the map as expected.

You can find Directory Opus here if you'd like to see this in action:

Now to troubleshoot the problem... Have you tried throwing in some alerts
before the function call, to find out what it is complaining about?

alert( GMap2 );
alert( document );
alert( document.getElementById );
alert( document.getElementById('map') );
alert( new GMap2( document.getElementById('map') ) );

Or, a long shot... What variable are you storing the new GMap2 return value
into? Try changing the name of that variable and see what happens.
