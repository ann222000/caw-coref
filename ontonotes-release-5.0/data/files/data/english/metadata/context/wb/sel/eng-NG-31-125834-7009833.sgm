So Cleo - why didn't you break up that fight?
You should have broken up that fight.
I don't understand why you couldn't look into
the future and realise that a huge fuss about nothing
was about to break out.

So, like I say, why didn't you do something when Jade
strangled Shilpa bare-handed while the henchwomen sat
around boiling her brains in a cauldron? At least that
is how it appeared when viewed on the TV.

Or she was taking notes for having a go at Dirk once Jade was out.

Why didn't C4 break up that fight.
They are now blaming Cleo, to take the blame and pressure off them.
It was their fault that they never stepped in earlier and prevented it
getting
to that terrible row over the oxo. They are now trying to wriggle out of it
and passing the
blame onto Cleo. Bad move C4.

Its big business, I'm sure Endemol engineered it  (Reality show producers
have no common sense just ALWAYS engineer conflict) just didn't realise that
It would grow quite so much.

People appearing on the show will suffer, the agents won't and neither will
Endemol in the long run - even the Car phone warehouse by dropping
sponsorship  (before re-joining?) have had more than £3million worth of
advertising in just 3days

Cleo : "But i did do something Davina i gobbed on her back while Leo was
flushing her head down the toilet."
Davina : "Why did you leave it to Jermaine to break them up  ?"
Cleo : "Well i didn't want to get blood on my clothes as they were clawing
each others eyes out.But like you said  the Nig -
coloured gentleman, Jermaine dragged her off anyway to give her a wedgie and
tip her bag over her head.
Davina : "Before we send you to stand in the corner and think about what
you've done what has been your best moment in the house."
Cleo : "It must have been when we switched Shilpa's paracetemol with
laxatives while she was trying to take an overdose, that was hilarious.But
I'm so pissed off with Dirk for not using her belly button as an ash-tray."
Davina : "Do you feel no remorse for your treatment of her ?"
Cleo : "No my conscience is clear, she brought it on herself by using the
deeply offensive term - onion bhaji"

Davina : "So Jade, are you really really sorry for being a strong
independant women i.e a brazen chav gobshite ?
Jade : " I truly am, i never meant to call Shilpa Shitty-whatever no names
nor nuffin.
Davina : "Then what would you call a Pakistani who wasn't married to his
cousin?"
Jade : "Nah, nah i'm not answering that."
Davina : "Asif perhaps ?
And are you sorry for claiming benefits while you were in the house ?"
Jade : "Yes i am, but, but , but."
Davina : "Got you, you racialist bastard you."
