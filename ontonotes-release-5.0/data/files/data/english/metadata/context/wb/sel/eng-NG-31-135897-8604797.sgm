The game so far is cruising on my mediocre system which includes a
Creative X-FI XtremeGamer soundcard (latest drivers).  Whenever there
are voices, there is a constant breakup of sound.  I have turned off
sound accelertion in the control panel and disabled both EAX and
Reverb in the game. Playing it at 1280x1024 (no widescreen resolution
as of yet).

Any ideas?

I'm no expert, but maybe your PCI bus is saturated.

Your mediocre system is probably &quot;limping fast&quot;, as opposed to &quot;cruising&quot;.

Assuming WinXP. Try this.
Run &quot;msconfig&quot; and  turn off all Startup programs ONLY via &quot;Selective
Startup&quot;by unchecking &quot;Load Startup Items&quot; After the mandatory reboot,
when you get back to the msconfig screen hit &quot;cancel&quot; . You have now
started up without any background programs running (hopefully). Also,
manually turn off any viruskillers that manage to elude &quot;msconfig&quot;.
Then restart Bioshock and see if the problem has disappeared. To get
back to normal just run &quot;msconfig&quot; again and select &quot;Normal Startup&quot;.

If that simple exercise does not work, I would recommend checking that
the X-Fi drivers are the latest.  Silly question -- you have
definitely completely turned off the A8NSLI on-board sound in BIOS??

Oh, considering that you were the guy having so much trouble running
Bioshock in the first place, I consider it highly likely that one of
your installed programs running in background is VERY likely to be the
maverick giving you the grief with the sound as well.  Seems as if you
may have a bunch of badly-behaved programs running in background on
your system. Time for a full system clean-up?

And referring to my immediately preceding reply to your posting:-

If you are unnecessarily scared of running msconfig, just create a
System Restore point before running &quot;msconfig&quot;.  Also, I have one
critical professional program that I run on my system ( dual-core
4400+, A8N32-SLI) that is a very serious resource-hog and I have to
turn off all my background programs with &quot;msconfig&quot; for the program to
bootup and work normally.  A trivial exercise with &quot;msconfig&quot;. See the
sequence in my previous reply.  Just run &quot;msconfig&quot; again and select
&quot;normal startup&quot; to return to your normal state (after reboot).

I know there are some people who are having problems with sound breakup
in Bioshock, and I think most of them are Creative users (although I
recall other reports that some other sound chips also have the problem.)

My guess is it's a bug in the game, but it could be that it's just
saturating the sound card with too much data. Either way, the Bioshock
team know about it and hopefully will be coming out with a patch soon.

maybe your sound card is sharing an IRQ with other hardware like graphics
card - move sound card to another PCI slot. if that doesnt sort it try using
PCI Latency Tool to force all devices onto 32 latency so they share the PCI
Bus equally.

The latest drivers from Creative's site are dated October 30th 2006!!
I am sure I installed them and not the ones from the CD.  I will check
my BIOS but I don't think there's any way the on-board sound is turned
on.

This is the only game that I have this issue with.

This is good advice. Last week, I was experiencing stuttering problems with
Bioshock (other games were OK), so I moved my X-Fi card to a different slot
and there was a big improvement. It can't hurt to try.

I should have figured what it was right away given that Logitech's G5
Gaming Mouse application stopped the game from loading in the first
place.  At first, I disabled the Creative X-Fi Volume panel / Game
Mode selection utility in the taskbar after discovering that EAX was
checked.  Then, I disabled Logitech's G15 Keyboad software.  Yup, it
was Logitech's fault again!  Am now running the game with the Creative
app in the taskbar and with EAX enabled in the game too.

Now back to the weirdest game I think I ever played.  If only I can
figure out how to survive that turret!

Thanks everyone once again!

There is a fix at widescreengamingforum.com.Download their fix here:

http://dl.tocaedit.com/bioshockdFOV.zip

1. Run the hack.

2. Set your desired &quot;Width FOV&quot; and &quot;Height FOV&quot;
(Please refer to the readme.txt that came with the hack for more
details)

3. Run the Game.

4. Press the &quot;*&quot; to activate the FOV settings once in game.

If you like the hack, please consider donating to the creator.
http://www.tocaedit.com/donate

NOTE: Currently the hack only supports DirectX9, but Racer_S is
working on a solution.

I found that 16:9 users should set it to:
Width FOV: 0.75
Height FOV: 0.75

16:10 users:
Width FOV: 0.84
Height FOV: 0.84
