A Conservative's Garden of False Narratives: Who are you calling  a moonbat,
anyway?

One would think that from the cries of (feigned) indignation and calls for
repentance arising from conservatives regarding Move-On.org's ad in the N.Y.
Times that the liberal-leaning group had not simply questioned the insights and
intentions of a public servant, promoting, in a public forum, the policy of
an  illegal and immoral occupation of a sovereign nation; rather, the folks of
Move-On.org had committed blasphemy against the holy name of some revered
saint  -- General Mary Petreus, Mother of God.
The false outrage of perpetually offended conservatives  serves as cover for
the true outrages of our era, including: truncated civil  liberties, rising
levels of social and economic inequality and injustice, and  foreign wars of
aggression waged by an insular and secretive executive branch  and fought by a
permanent underclass. The outrages keep arriving, because the  collective
imagination of the citizen/consumers of the US, arbitrated by a  careerist media
elite, has been, for decades, in the thrall of false narratives  that serve the
interests of the elite of the corporate/militarist classes.
Concurrently, a sense of unease and despair, due to a sense of personal and
collective powerlessness before exploitive power, has created the tone and
tenor  of the times, and begot the phenomenon of supine liberalism and Viagra
conservatism. (In this way, liberals stand fecklessly by, as the public is, time
and time again, screwed by the decrepit schemes of the right.)
In this way, liberal paternalism is insufferable; worse, it is dangerous.
This has been the right's craftiest accomplishment: inducing &quot;reasonable&quot;
liberals and &quot;sensible&quot; centrists to enable their crimes, from stolen elections  to
their present preparation for a massive bombing campaign of Iran, by
intimidating them with the fear that any protest on their part will cast them  among
the ranks of America-hating, lefty moonbats, who wish to see the terrorist
win, dumpsters piled high with discarded fetuses and metro-sexuality made the
official state religion.
Moreover, these assaults upon both reason and the republic (what's left of
it) will persist until progressives begin to effectively counter the narratives
of the predatory right. Some call it shameful demagoguery; although,
conservatives call it career advancement. This is not a novel situation.  Throughout
history, these kinds of pernicious mindsets have always been with us;  it is
our tragedy that they have been allowed to prevail.
Conservatives are eager to embrace false narratives: The surge is working;
the terrorists hate us for our freedom; Fred Thompson is Ronald Reagan
incarnate, but with a touch of Jed Clampett &quot;folksiness.&quot; Accordingly, when the
times are roiled with uncertainty, when thoughts of the future are tinged with
dread, conservatives, like a character in Southern Gothic literature, will fall
into a swoon, longing for the return of an imagined, purer past that never
was.  One can picture these rightwing sorts wandering the streets, wearing a
faded  prom dress and a broken, prom queen tiara, twittering and cooing, while
repeating over and over again, &quot;the surge is working; Anbar Province is now a
beacon of freedom unto the world...&quot;) in an imaginary dialog with the ghost of
their long lost beau, Ronald Reagan.
Ronald Reagan, an ungifted actor, by means of playing the role of a
&quot;resolute&quot; Cold Warrior, was able to gain the approbation and wealth that had  alluded
him as a contract player in Hollywood. In truth, Reagan's greatest
accomplishment was convincing himself of his own sincerity.
Constantin Stanislavsky, who is considered the father of modern acting
technique, is reputed to have said that when an actor starts to believe he is  the
character he's portraying it is time to escort him from the theatre. Withal,
Fred, Rudy, Rush, Hannity, O'Reilly, et al., can you find the exits on your
own  or will you need to be medicated, strapped to a gurney, and wheeled from
the  public arena? Rather than being candidates for President of the United
States,  most of the Republican field seems to be vying for the title of National
Crazy  Uncle -- the kind of guy who corners you at a family gathering and
rants that  the PTA is a terrorist front group and gangs of illegal aliens are
engaged in a  vast conspiracy to steal single socks from his washer-dryer.
The Republican candidates for president and their fantasy-prone constituents
wish to set the Way Back Machine to the golden days of the 1980s when Ronald
Reagan was impersonating a man just arrived via the 1940s. This phenomenon is
known as the Law of Republican Special Relativity, which states: When events
begin to accelerate forward, the conservative mind will be cast, at an equal
rate of speed, backwards in time. But the paradox is: they arrive in a
parallel  universe, an alternative past that never existed on this earth -- a low
probability dimension, comprised of platitudes and false pieties, where white
male privilege is sacrosanct, only for the reason (according to their
reality-proof perspective) that it serves to provide all mankind with all things
good and holy.
This law can be tested by performing the following simple exercise: Engage a
conservative true believer in a dialog regarding the manner by which &quot;state's
rights&quot; was misused in the Jim Crowe dominated Deep South of the pre-Civil
Rights Era in order to propagate and maintain segregation, and your  conse
rvative-minded test subject will respond as if those realities transpired  long
ago and far away on a planet that he has never visited.
Yet, paradoxically, rightists have manage to create a Time Retrieval Device,
a device that has summoned from the past wonders, such as the following: a
reversal of many of the rights of working people; the return of unsafe and
unsanitary practices in the food industry; widening gaps of wealth, health and
privilege between social, racial and economic classes; in short, many the
excesses of plutocratic rule inherent to unfettered capitalism.
As a result, a generation has inherited power who are devoid of the concept
of causation and consequence. Ergo, we have developed a political class who
rule  by narratives of denial and shallow self-justification. An example of this
is  the blaming of the people of Iraq for the blood-drenched debacle that has
resulted from the illegal and immoral invasion of their nation. As well as,
an  enabling cadre of media elitists who served as cheerleaders for the
invasion,  because they deemed it to be good for business, and, to this day, are
unwilling  to admit their complicity.
All of the above leads to the question: What are present day conservatives
striving to conserve? Historically, conservatives gave their utmost to conserve
institutions such as slavery, Jim Crowe, child labor -- and, of course, the
use  of leeches for medical purposes. (Perhaps, they simply couldn't stand the
thought of a fellow blood-sucker being deemed dangerous, and they feared the
start of a trend.) At present, the central paradox of contemporary
conservatism  is this: How does one practice conservatism within an all-encompassing
economy  based on disposability? This is analogous to establishing a brothel
devoted to  the goal of abstinence.
When engaged in a dialog with many conservatives, the question becomes: Are
their reactions and responses evoked therein simply borne of plain ignorance,
willful ignorance, or outright lying? Or are their responses the result of a
group hallucination? All progressives have experienced the following
nonsensical  encounter of the conservative kind. Present a reasoned argument to a
conservative -- and, all at once, completely ignoring the tenet, tone and thrust
of the point, they begin hallucinating a creature, only known to exist in the
rightwing bestiary, known as a &quot;moonbat&quot; -- a mythological beast that,
ironically, seems to appear when a conservative is confronted with reality.
Accordingly, the time has come for a study of political zoology and to posit
who are the true moonbats now making their habitat in the United States. Case
study: Unregulated, wish-fulfillment-based conservative economic policy has
created those suburban arrays of mold-incubating petri dishes known as
products  of the housing boom. Moreover, the bursting of the whole bubble-prone
Ponzi  scheme has sent shock waves throughout international economies and is
surging  the economy of the US towards recession. Furthermore, conservative
anti-regulatory policies have rendered us babes in a cheap, plastic Toyland.
What has an era of conservatism wrought? Answer: a culture that has all the
value, integrity, sustainability and safety as a toy manufactured in China.
Apropos, contemporary life, as conceived and manufactured by conservative
&quot;values&quot;, is shoddily made, toxic and not a lot of fun.
In addition, it has spawned a culture ridden with public relations fabulists
and media-savvy confidence artists who tell us that the taste of corporate
ass-suck is the ambrosia of the gods. The locked-down, stultifying mindset and
ideological barbarianism of present day conservatism is directly linked to
the  steep decline of the quality of life in the United States.
The recent revelations regarding the
&quot;I'm-not-gay-I-simply-engage-in-same-sex-encounters-in-puplic-restrooms&quot; wing of  the Republican Party are
instructive in understanding the rightist's worldview  and its effect on our times.
Covert sex in a public bathroom stall is an apt  metaphor for how contemporary
conservatism limits and restricts the  possibilities of human life. In the same
way that a closet-case gay conservative  stunts the possibilities of his love
life, the conservative mindset limits the  scope of a culture's possibilities.
Accordingly, economic life must be ruled by  ruthless, unregulated
competition, and the nation's meaning can only be found in  war. Hence, under the Bush
Junta, we are told, as far as international relations  go, that the nation has
few options other than its present policy of predatory  capitalism and
&quot;wide-stance&quot; militarism.
Regarding perma-fools such as these, Ernest Becker wrote: &quot;Once you base your
whole life striving on a desperate lie, and try to implement that lie, you
instrument your own undoing.&quot; Accordingly, the republic is dead; it's ghost
howls online only in pixelated protests such as this one. This grim reality
will  remain, until we rise up and repudiate the false narratives that have
created  and continue to comprise these tragic times.

&quot;When Fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag  and carrying
a cross.&quot; --Sinclair Lewis
