Dear all,

once again I’d like to tap into the great source of knowledge of this
group. For an odd reason, which I’m not going into, I have to write up
an analysis on something that I know nothing about, and am hoping that
some of you can guide me.

Recently GE signed $730 Million Agreement With EDP to supply 500
megawatts of wind turbines (EDP is Energias De Portugal, the world's
fourth largest wind project developer). http://tinyurl.com/25fuyk

I need to come up with a general financial analysis for this deal and
show why it’s profitable for EDP, how long does it take to depreciate
the cost, and what kind of return is expected or predicted. This is all
Greek to me, but I’d like to learn how to go about such an analysis. I
am assuming that environmental issues as well as price of oil are
factors, but I really don’t know where to start. My initial search
hasn’t taken me far. Can anyone help?  Thanks.

Thanks Nina. I sent you an email. But for others who may be able to
help, the required degree of knowledge is minimal. Just showing a
general process of how one goes about figuring such a thing, not
accurate results or numbers.

For this type of analysis, the most important thing to do is to build a
reasonable view of the cash flows that would result from the decision to
do the project.

At a very high level, you would need to apportion the expenditure across
some years (it looks like 2008 and 2009).

You will need to split it into at least two separate models reflecting
the different tax and operating regimes (US and Spain+Belgium).

For each of those you need an estimate of the revenue, operating and
other costs, tax depreciation schedules, tax structure and rates, and
incentives.

If you need to go beyond cash flow and into an earnings model, you need
to know something about Spain's equivalent of Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP), perhaps you can assume same as US GAAP.

The price of oil and environmental factors become an issue if this
project is being considered in lieu of an oil, coal, or gas fired fired
plant. Those would tend to have much higher operating costs, but
possibly lower capital costs. The big advantage of those plants is that
they are more reliable than wind. Price of oil may also affect the price
of power.

Might it be possible that they would realize additional revenue from
selling green credits?

If this project is an alternative to the conventional plants, you could
subtract the cash flows for the wind power from the cash flows of the
conventional, then discount the difference at the appropriate discount
rate. If you get a positive number, the conventional is better.

I don't have the details to answer most of these questions, but it might
at least help you start.

No friggin' clue... but this reminds me of our trip to Spain this
summer. If you need to illustrate your report &lt;grin&gt; I have wonderful
photos of wind turbines we discovered outside of Granada. We had a lot
of fun photographing them. My DD's remarked to us about how silly it
is that people here on the Cape opposed such wind turbines... they
really are quite lovely to look at and don't ruin the view at all!

I always thought it would be an excellent plan to line all our major
highways with windmills. There's enough space, for one thing, and
maybe this is naive, but I imagine the cars whizzing by must create
wind - so why not capture it?

We learned how to do this a bit in one of my engineering classes, but it
has really dimmed with time.  You definitely need to remember to deal
with the time value of money, but for costs and revenues.

Hmm, can you find a case study out there for a business class maybe?

I agree. The modelling is fairly complex and fundamentally is based on a
series of assumptions most of which are out of your control. Email me
offline if you want.
