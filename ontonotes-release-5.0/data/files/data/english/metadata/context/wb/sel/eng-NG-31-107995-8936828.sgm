I had a surprising experience recently. I took a couple of hard drives
and tried to destroy them with a 8 lb sledgehammer. I put a hard drive
on an anvil

http://igor.chudov.com/projects/Welding/13-Homemade-Mini-Anvil/

Then I hit it with a sledgehammer, expecting part to fly away and to
see the hard drive utterly demolished. But no such thing occurred.

Barely any damage was visible on the drive (though, probably, it would
no longer function). After many more hits, finally, the hard drive was
shoring visible deformation of its frame. I am rather amazed as to how
tough the hard drives are.

High velocity data destruction works much better. 7 Rem. Mag. at 100
yds. will punch straight through all platters and cause enough shock to
shatter the cast aluminum frame. .22 LR will stop by the second platter

Waste of a couple of large rare-earth magnets (per drive) you could get
by disassembling (sometimes only 1, sometimes a few tiny ones as well).

Not to mention nice aluminum for casting, when you strip off the other
crap, and some reasonable bearings. Sledgehammer - how...subtle.

The magnets inside the drive have to be the coolest things on the planet!
They are a pain to deal with but once you get them out they are very useful
to have around if anyone has never pulled one apart I'd recommend it just
for the parts.

At the bank I worked for we had a drill press that we sent all the drives
to that were being sunset.  While I agree shooting them would be way more
fun we needed to document the destruction of the platters and a 3/8&quot; hole
did the trick. (Then we scammed the magnets!)

You can buy them by the hundred on eBay, for not too much, in my more
useful shapes. I have a lot of rare earth magnets and they are very
useful, but extracting them from hard drives is not cost effective (I

a non-ferrous disc creating eddy effects...  wouldn't a computer hard drive
do the same thing?  fast spinning non-ferrous disc spinning rapidly near a

Not surprising,

If you take one apart before you sledge it, you'll see the base plate is a
sollid chunk of casting,  they have to be to maintain the close tolerances.

The main spindle that the platters are on is in the center of the device so
if you smacked it in the center your sledge was pretty much striking a
sollid round piece of metal that got pushed directly on to the anvil, ya
might as well have his a 2 inch round aluminum.

Best way to get maximun destruction in one blow would be to grab it in a
vise about a 1/3 of the way up, below what would be the spindle and the hole
it goes through, then smack the shit out of it, you'll have a better chance
of cracking the base plate casting where the spindle goes through.

All it takes is some tiny Torx (usually), a Phillips (often) and less
than 3 minutes. No drilling or hammer required. Bet it takes me less
time to take one apart than Iggy spent hammering.

Helps to remember that every &quot;do not remove&quot; label is concealing another
screw. Torx sizes under T10 are easy from McMaster or MSC, nearly
impossible at the average hardware store. Shipping will kill you if
that's all you order, but if you're placing an order anyway, a set from
T5 to T9 comes in handy.

No. The magnets are off to one side of the disc, driving the head. They
are in pole pieces that make for a very powerful field between the
magnets (there's a coil on the head mechanism back-end that sits
in-between there), but which also help to contain the field there. If
you had them in a position to cause eddy currents, you'd destroy the
magnetic data on the drive surface.

Note - some very old drives don't have such nice magnets - they have a
stepper motor, but that's usually obvious from the outside of the drive.

">

Most of the military manuals, especially the improvised anything ones,
are only trustworthy if accompanied by the training that would have gone
with them when they were issued to those that needed them.

As stand alone knowledge bases, the ones I have seen, left a bunch to
be desired, and were written on the premise that the reader already knew
many important things.
They also presume access to supplies that would not be readilly
available, outside a combat zone (eg, mortar shells, from which, anti
personell mines could be improvised)

The basics of this stuff is easy, it's the million little details
that'll get the experimentally minded reader killed.

Even the better written books, that I have seen, expected that a base
of knowledge was available, and that the reader was not ignorant of the
basic safety precautions.

There's two problems here.

- there's no anvil, not that you need one to smash a hard disk.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; this is something i've been wondering about, i mean, not a LOT but was
&gt; wondering.  the thread about a way to slow down a windmill using magnets and
&gt; a non-ferrous disc creating eddy effects...  wouldn't a computer hard drive
&gt; do the same thing?  fast spinning non-ferrous disc spinning rapidly near a
&gt; rare earth magnet?  wouldn't you need at a certain point like a 3/4 hp motor
&gt; to spin the disc in a hard drive?
">

Nope!  The magnets are in a set of pole pieces which confine the
field well away from the disks, and the coils on the back of the head
arms are in the only place where there is much field.

Remember -- if the field got to the platters, it would happily
erase the data on the platters, so there is very strong motivation to
keep the magnets' fields confined where it can move the head arm stack
and do nothing else.

Once you get the magnets out, if you try to separate the pole
pieces, be careful.  You can get some nasty blood blisters if you start
to pry them apart and they snap closed again on your fingers. :-)

Enjoy,

If you want to separate the magnets from the pole pieces, heat
it up with a torch to soften the Loctite (or similar) which glues the
magnets to the pole pieces.  Put the pole piece in a vise, apply
sideways pressure with a screwdriver (or with some wood), and heat the
pole piece from below.  When the Loctite softens, you will feel the
magnet slide sideways on the pole piece, and you can continue shoving
until it is clear.  (It will probably flip over and stick to the back
side of the pole pieces.)  Anyway, once you have it separate from the
pole piece, you can affix it to pole pieces designed to serve *your*
needs instead of those of the disk drive.

Enjoy,
DoN.

My 25+ year old shop vac had the cheap plastic dolly go bye-bye so I
cut a circle and square of particle board and glued them together.
Casters on the bottom of the square and two HD magnets set flush with

That's because you're trying to squash a casting.

Try setting the drive on its edge and whacking it, but be sure to
take safety precautions, because it will probably fly across the
room. Maybe clamp it to an angle plate.

Or, get a sledge with a pointy peen, if there is such a thing.

But why smash it? Why not just open it up, salvage the supermagnets,
and bend the disk? And, with modern drives, as soon as it's open
to room air, it'll be pretty much useless for data - the last time
I worked with flying heads, they flew at less than 0.000050&quot;, which
is smaller than dust.

&gt;&gt; I had a surprising experience recently. I took a couple of hard drives and

&gt;&gt; Then I hit it with a sledgehammer, expecting part to fly away and to see
&gt;&gt; the hard drive utterly demolished. But no such thing occurred.

&gt;&gt; Barely any damage was visible on the drive (though, probably, it would no
&gt;&gt; longer function). After many more hits, finally, the hard drive was
&gt;&gt; shoring visible deformation of its frame. I am rather amazed as to how
&gt;&gt; tough the hard drives are.

&gt; That's because you're trying to squash a casting.

&gt; Try setting the drive on its edge and whacking it, but be sure to
&gt; take safety precautions, because it will probably fly across the
&gt; room. Maybe clamp it to an angle plate.

I did that, and no, it did not fly apart.

&gt; Or, get a sledge with a pointy peen, if there is such a thing.

&gt; But why smash it? Why not just open it up, salvage the supermagnets,
&gt; and bend the disk?

Too time consuming, I already have enough magnets. I did take a hard
drive apart before.

&gt; And, with modern drives, as soon as it's open to room air, it'll be
&gt; pretty much useless for data - the last time I worked with flying
&gt; heads, they flew at less than 0.000050&quot;, which is smaller than dust.

&gt;&gt; I think the ones that are actual US govt./ military publications should

&gt;  Most of the military manuals, especially the improvised anything ones,

&gt;  As stand alone knowledge bases, the ones I have seen, left a bunch to

That would explain the Operations section of the U.S. Army manual of the
Burke #4 horizontal mill:
