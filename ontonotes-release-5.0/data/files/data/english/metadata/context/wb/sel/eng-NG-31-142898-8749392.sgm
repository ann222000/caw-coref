Mahabharat III: Coming of Ram to punish evil forces

Yuvraj Singh got six sixers against England. Who will get winning
sixers in the coming election againt the 'Ravan and Rome Sena? UPA is
going to down! All are in hurry! Will Soni Sonia Balu Bhalu Monkey
eldest Jatayu all not want to touch the feet of god?

How can Rams keep his feet on the Bharat Bhumi? How can Bhalu Jatayu
Monkey be active without Ravan and Surpankha? Who can write Mahabharat
if there will never be Duryodhans? Mahabharat III is certain:

Keeping Democratic Gandiv down is not dharm. Hear and follow Geeta,
which is our national Dharm Granth as said by Allahabad HC. Recall few
days back, which are the evil forces to deny this fact.

Supreme Court's decesion on Hindutva

We became outsider in our country. Hinduism and Hindutva of our
nationalism as defined by the Supreme Court are being dishonored to
honor Western Italian culture. Now there is no shame to be Ramdrohi.

Give message from earth to sky: 'Victory of dharm is certain'

Whatever happened, it happened for good.
Whatever is happening is happening for good.
Whatever that will happen, it will be for good.
What have you lost for which you cry?
What did you bring with you, which you have lost?

You all are Bharat, sons of Dushyants.
Roar of the sons of Dushyant's Bharat has power to paralyze the Anti-
Hinduism: http://www.newsanalysisindia.com/118092007.htm

How can you be coward lion?

I guess I got the chance today: Yuvraj Singh

&quot;You know I was hit for five sixes by Dimitri in the sixth ODI (at
Oval). The number of phone calls I got after that. ... So I said 'God,
this is not fair. You got to give me a chance' and I guess I got the
chance today,&quot; Yuvraj said

Be prepared for Lok Sabha polls, says Advani

With issues like the Indo-US nuclear deal and the Ram Setu hotting up,
senior BJP leader L K Advani forsees a &quot;radical political change&quot; and
early general elections.

Change is Life (Parivartan hi jivan hai)

Theory of nature is 'Parivartan'. Without change there is no life. I
am writing this in the night, does it mean sunshine not come? Ganga
Yamuna and underground Sarswati flow always to give pure water to
their children. This was the reason I published 'Badhate Chalen'
students Hindi 'Weekly in 1960 from Delhi in my nineteen. . Printing
was done in the OK press at 'Turkmangate. That was the residence of
most attractive Eunuches. I have heard Mahabharat in my childhood. At
that time in the night 'Mahabharat' katha were organised in the
residential colonies. I heard about Brihanlala. I thought what would
be if they became Brihannala.

Eagles sokes blood of people

I began to think. Why do these euruches not become the brihannalas to
win the Mahabharat whenever would be figh between dharm and adharm?

Now I see everywhere Kanyakumari to Kashmir dance of demons to ruin
Hinduism and Hindutva. I see Indianless fake secularist eagles of the
present government are soaking the blood of people. Every field of the
society and nation is captutured by the evil forces and India of 100
crores become parrots in the captivity. http://www.newsanalysisindia.com/125112006.htm

Democratic Mahabharat

These captives are not different than the Eunuches. But I am making a
blunder mistake to think like that. People of my nation can't remain
in captivity for forever. Ther will be democratic Mahabharat soon.
Brihanalas will take Gandivs in their hands.

I read an editorial of T.V.R. Shenoy in the Tribune's old edition.
''URVASHI shaapam upkaaram'' runs a Sanskrit proverb - ''Urvashi's
curse is actually a blessing.'' The Mahabharata says the gods
manoeuvred the nymph Urvashi into trying to seduce Arjuna. He refused
firmly, pointing out that she was his ancestress. Urvashi wasn't used
to such rebuffs. &quot;If you are so unmanly that you spurn me&quot;, she cursed
him, &quot;may you become a woman in body as in mind.&quot;

Indra consoled the distraught Arjuna. &quot;Everything that comes from
heaven shall prove beneficial in the long run,&quot; the king of the gods
said, ''you shall indeed become a woman but it shall be only for one
year and at a time when you so choose.&quot;
A few years later the Pandavas were forced to live in disguise for 12
months (one of the conditions imposed upon them by the Kauravas after
the famous game of dice). Arjuna then invoked Urvashi's curse to pass
himself off as a dance teacher called Brihannala.

Now Mahabharat is takig shape again in the democracy of our country,
which has been wounded by the Indianless evil forces. There may be the
repeatation of Ramayan now.

Arjuna (Bruhannala)

King of Virat and most of his army were fighting with Trigartas in the
battlefield at that time. Uttar, the young prince, was the only man
left who could fight back but he was too afraid. He tried to avoid it
by saying that his charioteer was nomore. How possibly could he go to
warfront without a charioteer?

Arjuna heard this and promptly offered his services. He asked
Sairandhri to convey his readiness to prince via Uttara, Uttar's
sister. Uttar headed for fight with Brihannala (Arjun) as his
charioteer. When Uttar saw mighty warriors of Kauravas in the
battlefield, he was frightened and decided to run away. Arjun stopped
him mid-way and alleviated his fears. Arjuna proposed that he would
fight and asked Uttar to take his place as a charioteer while he does
the fighting. Uttar agreed.

Arjuna (Bruhannala) took his chariot close to the tree where Pandavas
had hide their weapons during incognito. He asked Uttar to bring down
weapons. Uttar was surprised to find Pandavas weapons on that tree.
Uttar insisted Brihannala upon revealing his identity. The time of
incognito was over so Brihannala identified himself as great archer,
Arjuna. He also revealed identity of other Pandavas; Kanka as
Yudhisthir, Ballav as Bhim, head of cowherd as Sahadev and overseer of
King's horses as Nakul.

For Uttar, the revelation was startling. He wanted to verify
Bruhannala's claims so he questioned about other names by which Arjuna
was known. Brihannala narrated his ten names: Arjuna, Falgun, Jishnu,
Kirit, Shwetavahan, Bibhatsu, Vijay, Krishna, Savyasachi and
Dhananjay. Uttar then requested Arjuna to reveal how he became
impotent Brihannala. Arjuna narrated his story. Uttar was satisfied
with Arjun's reply. He apologized Arjuna for his misconduct due to his
ignorance.

Arjuna headed towards the battlefield with Uttar as his charioteer.
Arjun's outer appearance was totally changed as he removed his old
dress and wore protective gears befitting a warrior. We Indians (if
not Italian, American and other invaders) know what happened later.

What says Geeta?

Yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham

Synonyms
yada--whenever; yada--wherever; hi--certainly; dharmasya--of
religion; glanih--discrepancies; bhavati--manifested, becomes;
bharata--O descendant of Bharata; abhyutthanam--predominance;
adharmasya--of irreligion; tada--at that time; atmanam--self; srjami--
manifest; aham--I.

Translation
Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O
descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion--at that
time I descend Myself.

This is what the Lord Himself gave his word in the Bhagvat Geeta. The
Lord did not ever fail to keep His words down the ages. From His
heavenly abode at the Vaikuntha, He incarnated down to the earth to
protect His devotees. Just like 'the waves in an ocean,' Lord Vishnu,
the Supreme Soul and the sustainer, appeared down to the earth in
different, different forms, one after another.
