How does towing work?

If I have a AAA membership, and my car breaks down at night, I can have them
tow my car to a shop or my dealer.  I've never needed to have my car towed, so
I don't know how this works.  If my car breaks down at night, and I have it
towed to a shop/dealer who has already closed, do I just leave my car there?
Do I put a note on the windshield explaining why my car is there?  And will
the tow truck also take me back home?

The tow-truck drivers know which shops stay open late.

Nowadays, it takes a fully-equipped professional to  *optimize* a
vehicle's performance.

It does NOT take a pro, to do basic inspections that will AVOID  a
show-stopping  "breakdown."

I think most folks over in the auto groups would agree with me that, if
you religiously follow the manufacturer's stated maintenance
timetables, you will never have a "breakdown".

The most profitable organizations, are the most careful about
maintenance.

Maintenance *is* the frugal path.

Most repair facilities have a night box where you can drop the key.
You can then call them or go back in  the morning. If you a wary of this
simply leave the car o the property and get there when they open.
The AAA obligation ends when the towing ends but the driver should do
one of he following:
Drop you off somewhere in the way back to their garage (Of course he
might be going in the opposite direction) or in a safe location.
If you do not have a cell he should use his or use his radio to call
the garage to get you a taxi,

I totally disagree with your statement "if you religiously follow the
manufacturer's stated maintenance timetables, you will never have a
"breakdown"."

While you will lessen your chance of a breakdown, you will *never eliminate*
your breakdowns due to a faulty part.

I think that any mechanic (excluding shadetree) will agree with my
statement.

I repair multi-million dollar pieces of equipment for a living, and while
our parent company says that we do too much preventative maintenance, we go
with the manufacturers recommended schedules (actually sometimes we go
beyond) for the PM's. We still have breakdowns almost every day. During
production, when the machinery is down, we are talking thousands of dollars
per minute that we are down. Downtime, or the lack of, is *very* important
to us at work.

Totally agree.  I had a 4runner that was well maintained and it broke
down on the road when the starter failed without any warning.

Therefore best to say "almost never" breakdown.

As someone else pointed out, some of the shops stay open late, but
still, if you get towed at 2am, it's unlikely that anybody's going to
be open.  If that happens, then yes, the tow-truck driver will tow
your car to the repair shop (or for that matter, to any location) of
your choice and leave it there.  You can leave a note on the
windshield, but you should also call the shop as soon as they open in
the morning and let them know what's going on.

Note also that with standard AAA membership, the amount of towing you
get for free is limited to a few miles.  If you ask the two-truck
driver to tow farther than that, you'll pay by the mile at rates set
by the driver (i.e., not by the AAA).

Note also that some tow-truck drivers will try to rip you off and
charge you for things that are supposed to come for free with AAA
membership.  For example, they may charge you a "hook-up fee" or "lift
fee".  Perhaps they legitimately think that these are legitimate
charges, but I think it's more likely that they're looking to make a
quick buck.  It's best not to argue with the driver about this.  Just
pay the fee, and then contact the AAA and ask them to reimburse you,
which they will if the fee wasn't legitimate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And will the tow truck also take me back home?
">

That's not included in the AAA service.  The driver may agree to take
you home, but he's free to charge you whatever he wants to do it.  You
can usually ask him to call you a cab, though.  If you're in a remote
location, it might be wise to ask him to stay with you until the cab
arrives.  You should consider the distance from your house and the
remoteness of the location when deciding to where to ask the driver to
tow your car.

Impossible and here is an example. I keep my vehicles well maintained. I
was driving at highway speed on the Interstate on a busy Friday
afternoon when the engine simply stopped. Fortunately I was in the far
left lane so I was able to coast off the road without cutting thru
traffic. I had the car towed in to the garage. It started and ran OK.
The computer did not have any stored codes.  They eventually found a
failing crankshaft position sensor.

Indeed.

Wrong. Some machinery isnt designed for a certain life time of use at all.

One obvious example is simple stationary diesel engines.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Correct. And its never going to be possible to eliminate early
failures with those components by replacement even if they did.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Most if not all manufacturer's maintenance timetables do not

He can claim that that isnt the sort of breakdown that needs towing tho.

Funny, we have other plants in our industry from all over the country call
and ask us questions on our maintenance program and ask for advice. We have
had people fly in and "join us" for a training crash course.

Maybe when I said breakdowns almost everyday, I should have stated that most
of them are minor and many of those minor repairs can be made with the
equipment running. We do have major breakdowns from time to time, and those
could take 3 shifts working around the clock 3 to 4 days to finish the
repairs as long as we have the parts that are needed or have them available
to be Fed Ex'ed in.

If your home is within 7 miles he'll tow you there if that's what you want.  I
once wanted the guy to just tow me up to the top of the hill, I could make it
from there, but he said no, it had to be a real place, so he towed me to his
station and we pushed it from there.  Yeah, on the freeway again!

With AAA - Texas, you get four, three mile tows per member, per year on the
standard membership.

I called and checked with Sprint PCS, with whom I have roadside assistance
with, and they are the same as AAA-Texas.

I will soon be calling and cancelling Sprint ($96 per year) and getting AAA
(Plus) with four 100 mile tows per member per year plus the other perks for

AAA will only tow a few miles and then it costs you per mile.
It's a lot cheaper to buy x-dollars worth of towing insurance as part of your
regular auto insurance policy than AAA, IMO.

It might be a good idea to give some thought beforehand, where you might
want your car towed if it were to break down anywhere along your regular commute.

Towing
When a disabled vehicle cannot be started or driven safely, it will be
towed to either the independent contract service station answering the
ERS call, anywhere of your choosing within five miles of where you're
stranded, or anywhere that is en route to, or within five miles of, the
contract station. Additional towing may be available at your expense. If
you are a AAA Plus® Member, towing is provided up to 100 miles per

---------begin---------

Towing Benefits

* AAA Premier? ? Receive one 200-mile tow per membership year, and the
remaining calls up to 100 miles per membership year
* AAA Plus? ? Receive 4 calls per membership year, up to 100 miles each
* Standard ? Receive 4 calls per membership year, up to 7 miles each

When a vehicle cannot be started or safely driven, the vehicle can be towed to
the independent contract station providing the service (no matter how far
away) at no charge to the member.

A member must be present when the vehicle is delivered to a closed repair
facility. Towing beyond the benefits described above is at the member's
expense and may be subject to a delay.

In general:

They "just leave the car there. "  An exception might be if the tow
operator also was employed at the repair shop, in that case they might
put the car in the garage.

Feel free to leave a note, it is YOUR responsibility to contact the
operator of the repair facility to arrange for service.

The tow truck driver may or may not take you home.  That's between you
and he and is not covered under your AAA coverage.

Call me crazy, but I don't quite get why it's worthwhile to buy
insurance for this in the first place.

At the worst, I can imagine needing a tow perhaps twice a year, and
that would be in a bad year.  Given that it costs about $125 for a
tow, I'm not sure how it's a catastrophe to have to pay for it yourself.

More to the point, unless the insurance company is negotiating special
rates with tow truck companies (which, I admit, is possible), they are
paying the same rates as you and yet making money despite all their
overhead.  Therefore, on average you should expect to pay less if you
simply pay the costs yourself on the rare occasion that it's necessary.

To put it another way, the purpose of insurance is not to get free
stuff: it never works that way, because the insurance company makes
a profit, and you must therefore wind up paying more *on* *average*.
The purpose of insurance is instead to protect you from large expenses
that could damage your financial stability or at least throw you off.
I just don't see how having to pay $125 typically less than once a
year can threaten to throw anyone off all that much.

All in all, if I had to choose between the two, I'd much rather have
insurance for the repairs themselves.  You can bet that after you
spend that $125 to be towed to a shop, the repair bill is going to
come to a lot more than $125 most of the time.  Seems to me that's
the type of unexpected expense to protect yourself from.  Not that
I'm aware of a company that offers this type of insurance, but it
does seem more desirable.

Because there is a single point of contact. If you were 75 miles from
home and your car stopped on the Interstate who would you call? AAA has
negotiated contracts and service level agreements with providers and

You do know that is completely ridiculous. The failure that the car had
could have been caused by a number of components. It is totally
impractical to remove all of those components and perform some sort of
exhaustive analysis on them. And more importantly it is outrageous to
perform periodic testing on such components because it typically does
not produce a reduction in failures.

Instead the mechanic performed a reasonable and customary repair. He
plugged his analyzer in and went for a ride until the computer produced
a service code. The service code was for a specific sensor. He replaced
the ~ $40.00 part and the car has worked fine since. What else exactly
needed to be determined?

The Space Shuttle level inspection/maintenance process you advocate just
doesn't make sense for a passenger automobile. And even with the extreme
level maintenence the shuttle does have problems.

Once in my lifetime.  Situation was, I was stopped in traffic (as in, not
moving at all).  I had cars beside me and a guard rail on the other side.  A
ford taurus came up fast behind me and didn't stop until it was parked in my

When you drive cars into the ground, it happens more often than you'd
think. :-)  Let's see -- green car twice, yellow car twice, first white
car once, not yet for second white car.  First white car got broadsided
by a red-light runner so it was being hauled away by the city, green
car had a power steering pump failure and another part (can't remember
which one) failue, yellow car had a bad alternator and a bad water
pump.

The green car died with 276,000 miles, the yellow I sold at 250,000,
the white was totaled in an accident.

Three times that I can recall.  In high school, I had an Olds Cutlass
that my parents gave me.  It was serviceable, but built in 1980,
pretty much the low point of all time for GM.  The car had a
rotor (in the distributor, that is) had a nasty habit of cracking
in two if it got slightly too hot.  Pushing the car too hard could
cause it to get slightly too hot, where "pushing too hard" meant
cruising along the freeway at the same speed as regular traffic.
One time I was driving about 50 mph, and the engine just died.
Since I was on a busy section of freeway (and did not yet know
that was the problem), there was no real way to get the car out
of there.

Second time, same Olds Cutlass.  Had had the engine rebuilt a
few years before.  Apparently the rebuilder wasn't that hot[1].
One day (on my way to show up for my first day of work at a new
job, naturally), the crankshaft just broke in two while I was
driving down the highway.  (Actually, I had it towed twice: once
to the service station, and once from there to the car dealer
that got it when I traded it in on something more reliable.)

Third time was totally my fault.  I knew it was time to replace
the timing belt on my Toyota, but I kept putting it off.  I
really was planning on doing it, but I didn't get around to
it until after having to have it towed.  Whoops.

So, all in all, one of them should have been avoided, and one
of them could have been avoided if I'd known more about who
not to take the car to, which I didn't.

- Logan

[1]  The day after we took it down to them to have them start
work, I was talking to a classmate whose family owned a
lawnmower repair business.  I told him where we'd chosen
to take the car, and he said something like, "You took it
to where?  You're going to regret that."  And he was right.
I don't know why I didn't think to ask him where to take it,
since he did basically grow up working on small engines...

Most AAA memberships limit the number of tows per year, so it
isn't exactly "forever" -- there's a built in limit on the
amount that one membership can cost the auto club.

Too few people hit that limit for the AAA to worry about it.

They mostly just have a limit to the number of calls per year etc.

He doesnt appear to be saying that is done, just

Really depends on the percentage of sensors that go bad

detect some going bad before they fail completely.

&gt;&gt; You're happy because they fixed the complaint within a reasonable

&gt;&gt; their actions for a complete diagnostic work-up.

&gt;&gt; A real diagnostic work-up for evaluating a vehicle isn't easy to
&gt;&gt; find.... it takes  LOT of expensive equipment, and a learning curve
&gt;&gt; for the mechanics. Money, and more money, which could only be
&gt;&gt; recovered by charging for... no repair work.  Bev, over in another
&gt;&gt; thread, already displayed a VERY typical consumer reaction to such
&gt;&gt; an offer:  &quot;I don't want to pay for information about the mechanical
&gt;&gt; condition of my property&quot;.  She is really in the center of the Bell
&gt;&gt; curve.  How many people get their homes inspected outside of a
&gt;&gt; trying-to-sell situation? How many people keep even the simplest
&gt;&gt; track of MPG or of (eg) battery specific gravity, or condition of
&gt;&gt; crankcase oil?  THese things are quite cheap to do.

&gt;&gt; Go into any auto-parts store and look at the tremendous number and
&gt;&gt; variety of after-market products which cater to activities which
&gt;&gt; enhance the COSMETICS of a vehicle. They get the shelf space because
&gt;&gt; they have a high profit margin  (ie, the chemicals involved are not
&gt;&gt; spectactular, but they've been marked up spectactularly); and because
&gt;&gt; they move well.  People get pleasure in burnishing the appearance of
&gt;&gt; their vehicles. I don't see many people blueprinting their engines,
&gt;&gt; or the auxiliaries.

&gt;&gt; It used to be that the AAA of Massachusetts owned and operated an
&gt;&gt; actual Diagnostic Center. You paid a few hundred dollars for a
&gt;&gt; top-to-bottom evaluation of your vehicle, by Master Mechanics using
&gt;&gt; the best instrumentation... no repairs, you paid for RELIABLE
&gt;&gt; INFORMATION. I don't know if it still exists.

&gt; At the worst, I can imagine needing a tow perhaps twice a year, and

How far do you get for $125?  AT $7/mile, that's 18 miles.  Our kids live 50
miles away.  I go skiing 86 miles away.  My mom lives 11 miles away.  Never
can tell, we might even go somewhere else.  The idea of making a simple phone
call and having some pre-vetted tow truck show up to haul the truck back home
so we can fix it ourselves seems not all that dumb.  You like the idea of
Billy-Bob towing you to his station and telling you that you need your engine
replaced?  Save the $75/year!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; All in all, if I had to choose between the two, I'd much rather have
&gt; insurance for the repairs themselves.  You can bet that after you

&gt; come to a lot more than $125 most of the time.

Unless you do it yourself, which is why you want it towed home rather than to
Billy-Bob's shop.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Seems to me that's
&gt; the type of unexpected expense to protect yourself from.  Not that
&gt; I'm aware of a company that offers this type of insurance, but it

I guess new cars come with stuff like that, but since I wouldn't dream of
buying a new car I guess I'll never find out.

Me.  Lifetime, maybe a dozen times.  Most memorable:  a bearing in the
differential broke, allowing the axle to pull out, which broke the brake
lines.  Rolling down Angeles Crest in a 60 Ford station wagon with no brakes.
Fortunately we got to the little bar/restaurant with the sandy parking lot,
which slowed us down considerably before we hit the bank.  That was the last
stopping-place on our side of the road, although we could have crossed over to
the other side and scraped up against the bank until we stopped or were hit by
another car.

What's your story?

I've used my AAA road service calls two or three times per year, on
average - If I didn't PLAN to use it, I probably would not continue to
pay for it.

By "planning" to use it, I don't mean a predetermined schedule of use,
but rather making sure that I receive the level of service I'm paying
for.  I'm not averse to allowing the autoclub contracted drivers
change a flat in the rain, snow, or heat, nor am I willing to spend
several hours trying to diagnose a problem at the side of the road if
the car quits running.

My time is worth the investment - your mileage may vary.

They do - AAA provides a specified number of service calls per year -
you pay after that.  In California, it's four calls per card per year
- in any given year, my wife and I between us can call for up to eight
tows.

The ability to have a single number to call for help when the car breaks
down in that remote town.

The insurance of the towing fees is something that comes bundled with the
package. If there was a cheaper version that insured only the availability
of the tow and not the cost of the tow, I'd go for it. (But I'd want such
"insurance" to cover the payment to the tow truck operator and have it on a
"bill me later" basis because Murphy's law section 6, paragraph 3 guarantees
that your bank's fraud department will also shut off all your credit cards
at the same time the car breaks down in that remote town.)

Sort of on that subject, my parents always told me to make sure and
carry cash with me when I travel.  Apparently they learned this the
hard way when they were on the road halfway between Dallas and Lubbock
(which is a 7 or 8 hour drive) and ran out of money for gas or something,
and my grandfather had to drive 200 miles (each way) just to hand them
$5 or whatever.  He was NOT amused at having to do this and made it
clear to both of them how he felt about it.

I ran into something similar years ago.  I was on a 200 mile road
trip, and I was low on gas in the middle.  I stopped in the nearest
town, drove to the ATM, and the ATM was broken.  I didn't have a
credit card, and I hadn't thought about bringing cash.  I didn't have
enough gas to make it to a town with a working ATM.  Finally, I
found a gas station that, after some pleading on my part, agreed to
accept a personal check even though it was against company policy,
and as a result I made it home.

Naturally, carrying cash isn't a totally bulletproof idea either.
You could get robbed at a rest stop or something.  But if you carry
enough to fill your gas tank once or twice, that can get you out
of a lot of situations.  It might not be enough to pay for certain
things, but it might be enough to convince someone you're serious
about paying (for a tow or a repair) even if it isn't enough to
pay them in full.

By the way, I agree that having one number to call when you're in
some strange town probably is a convenience worth something.
