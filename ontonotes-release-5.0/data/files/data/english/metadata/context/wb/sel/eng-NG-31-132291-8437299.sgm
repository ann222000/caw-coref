Black July and the Rule of Unreason

*&quot;Our challenge is to devise some arrangement which enables us to coexist if
not in amity then at least in forbearance.&quot;*
*Jawaharlal Nehru to Andre Malraux *

For Sri Lanka, the cruellest month is not April but July.

Reconciliation cannot come without truth. And the truth is that in July 1983
we, Sinhalese, disgraced ourselves beyond words, beyond comprehension,
beyond belief. We shamed our history, our culture, our very humanity. And we
endangered our future. The Sinhala Only gave birth to Vellupillai
Pirapaharan but without the horror that was Black July – and with enough
devolution at the right time - the monster may well have become a mere
footnote in history. Instead we taught our Tamils, in the most unmistakable
and unforgettable manner, that they need a protector who is at least as
vicious as we can be on occasion. And Tamils learnt the lesson only too
well. The choices they made post-Black July were all coloured and warped by
Black July. Those choices have cost and are costing the Tamil community
dearly. But this is cold comfort to us, because the plague of extremism has
made a triumphant return amidst us; today we are more prone to remaking old
mistakes than we have been at any time since July 1983.

Such retrogression could have been avoided if we accepted our culpability
for the outrage that was Black July and internalised its lessons. We would
not and did not. As the mini-riot in Trincomalee last year demonstrated when
we think Tamils are weak and there is a tough regime committed to Sinhala
rather than Sri Lankan interests, we have no compunctions about resorting to
our old methods of keeping the 'uppity Tamils' in their place. After all
Black July was not the first and only anti-Tamil riot; it was the last and
worst in a series of anti-Tamil riots which began with the 1956 revolution,
at a time when Vellupillai Pirapaharan was a toddler and the LTTE did not
exist. And the Trinco mini-riot could have developed into a full blown one,
as it had the backing of certain state actors, had it not been for the
personal intervention of the Indian Prime Minister.

Therein lies the crux of the matter – that it took outside intervention, in
the form of a call by the Indian PM, for Lankan authorities to intervene to
quell the attack on Tamils. The lesson of that incident would be lost
neither on the Tamils nor on the international community. Sri Lankan state –
or at least some Sri Lankan regimes – cannot be trusted to protect the
country's Tamil citizens and therefore they need non-state actors or
external players as protectors. That was the lesson of Black July and it was
reinforced once again in Trinco last year. That such an impression, such a
message is damaging to the interests of the country *and *of the Sinhalese –
and helpful to the LTTE - should have been obvious to the regime.
Unfortunately the regime does not seem to have been cognizant of this danger
– as evidenced by its disastrous decision to expel North-Eastern Tamils from
Colombo lodges. This time fortunately countervailing pressure did not come
exclusively from the international community. The judiciary intervened while
the civil society was unequivocal in its condemnation. It was left to a
handful of government leaders and the some JHU members to defend the
indefensible.

*The One and Only Country*

**

There is 'our' history; and there is 'their' history. Our history is
naturally correct in our eyes. According to our history Black July, though
it did happen, was actually a minor matter. There was some violence, some
unpleasantness; but the account the Tamils give – and the international
community believes in – is grossly exaggerated. Though quite a few of us
feel a sense of embarrassment, even shame about Black July, this has not
made us acknowledge our crime fully or apologise unconditionally. Our
apologies are usually qualified, using as excuse the gruesome killing of 13
soldiers by the LTTE – as if that crime can in anyway justify the collective
insanity the Sinhala society plunged into and revelled in, day after day, in
July 1983. We also try to palm off the entire responsibility of the riots on
the UNP, conveniently forgetting that the mobs were truly multi-partisan,
that they consisted of UNPers, SLFPers, JVPers and people who did not belong
to any party. And we get irritated, even angry, that Tamils and some
foreigners continue harping on this one incident. Why not put it behind us
and look ahead, we ask with a genuine sense of bewilderment. The community
which refers to the millennia old Dutugemunu-Elara war as if it is a
contemporary event wants the Tamils to forget Black July which is less than
three decades old! The irony of such an expectation is naturally beyond our
collective comprehension.

Sri Lanka is the only land of the Sinhalese. This is true, though our case
is hardly unique. There are many ethnic/ethno-religious communities in the
world facing similar circumstances and some of them do not have even a
single country. But such realities would not change our perception of
Sinhala Buddhists as an endangered species and Sri Lanka as the 'One and
Only country' which is constantly in danger of being defeated by external
enemies or subverted by internal foes. Much that happened to this country in
her post-Independence history are sourced in this belief, the irrational
fears it gives rise to and the maniacal manner in which we react to those
fears.

This belief of the perpetually endangered 'One and Only Country' turns the
defence of 'living space' – land – into a sacred duty, a duty to be carried
out, irrespective of the cost, to others and to us. Thus living space – the
notorious *Lebensraum* – becomes a determinant factor, both at the local and
national levels, in renting a house or in devolving power. Traces of this
psychological condition can be found in our historical memory; the best case
in point being the lament of young Prince Gamini – later the legendary hero,
Dutugemunu – to his mother: How can I stretch my arms and legs, with the sea
on one side and 'alien Tamils' on the other? (This is hardly a rational
observation as it was supposed to have been made at a time when much of the
island was uninhabited). For Sinhala supremacists, this lament is expressive
of our current predicament vis-à-vis minorities in general and Tamils in
particular.

In the Sinhala supremacist worldview, the Sinhala – Tamil contradiction
expressed in the above statement is the main contradiction in Lankan
history. Fundamental to this mental universe is the premise that Sinhalese
have no other country but Sri Lanka; from this flows the belief that Sri
Lanka is the land of the Sinhalese and that all other communities are merely
guests in it, without the same rights. They are regarded with mistrust,
suspected of conspiring to take our country away from us, either for their
exclusive use or to hand it over to some foreign power.

That is where the global conspiracy theory comes in. Depending of the
politico-ideological views of the believer this can either be an imperialist
conspiracy or a Christian one; its aim is to deprive the Sinhalese/Sinhalese
Buddhists of their one and only country. The 'reason' for this varies, again
according to the belief system of the believer – it can be because of
Trincomalee, our strategic location in Asia, the need to destabilise India
or the desire to destroy Buddhism. And those who hold these views regard
them as self-evident and axiomatic truths, beyond dispute or debate.

*Racial Religion and, Religious Nationalism *

**

Commenting on an article by Samuel Huntington (*Robust Nationalism – The
National Interest*) Philip S Golub (*My Country, 'tis of thee - Le Monde
Diplomatique – *July 2005) points out that Huntington advocates a new
nationalism based on a &quot;mystical union of God, the nation and the armed
forces&quot;.

The Dutugemunu reign, as it is depicted in some of the chronicles, was a
precursor of this religious nationalism. Perhaps that was why King
Dutugemunu became our greatest hero, even though objectively his achievement
was hardly peerless. For example the achievement of King Vijayabahu was
greater and more impressive. The enemy he had to fight against was not
merely a regional kingdom (with an aged king) but an empire. He took on the
might of the great Chola Empire and won. He saved this small island from
becoming a client state of India. His example should have been more
inspiring because he was a rebel, without a kingdom, taking on a mighty
empire. Dutugemunu was a regional king who went to war with another regional
king. Nevertheless in the eyes of the chroniclers and of us, Vijayabahu is
the lesser hero. A Sinhala child grows up hearing romantic tales about
Dutugemunu's heroic life but there are no such tales about Vijayabahu, the
greater hero and king by any objective standards. Why?

The story about Dutugemunu's conscience is as important as his lament about
shrinking living space. The victorious king tells the eight arhats of
Piyangudipa about his regret for having caused 'the slaughter of a great
host numbering millions'. They reply, &quot;From this deed arises no hindrance in
thy way to heaven.

Only one and a half human beings have been slain here by thee… The one had
come unto the (three) refuges, the other had taken on himself the five
precepts. Unbelievers and men of evil life were the rest, not more to be
esteemed than beasts&quot; (*Mahavamsa*). A religion that is premised on loving
kindness to all living beings is thus made to stand on its head; it is
twisted and tortured so that the slaughter of innumerable living beings in
the cause of faith can be justified. This perhaps marks the point of
conscious transformation of Buddhism into Sinhala Buddhism which teaches
that slaughtering enemies of the race is not a sin because the survival of
the faith is interwoven with the survival of the race. This Sinhala-Buddhism
is thus by nature incapable of acting as a constraint on horrors such as
Black July, where the victims are the *'Untermenschen'*

* *

The following comment by the JHU parliamentarian Ven. Ellawala Medhananda is
important because it indicates the destructive paths in which this racial
religion (and the religious nationalism it gives birth to) can take this
country:

*Q:* &quot;As compensation for defamation you have requested Rs. 2.5 billion. Why
such an exorbitant amount? Wouldn't a public apology suffice?&quot;

*A:* &quot;It is tit for tat. If they come with sword, we answer with sword. If
they come with kindness, we answer with kindness. Otherwise you cannot live
in this world. Even Lord Buddha approved of this and said that you should
not remain silent in the face of provocation. The proper response should be
given when the situation demands it&quot; (*The Nation* - 22.7.2007)

We cannot prevent future Black Julys, bring peace and reconciliation to the
East or to Sri Lanka through a policy of eye for an eye. Emulating the Tiger
will help neither Sri Lanka nor Sinhalese. We cannot justify unfree and
unfair elections on the grounds that the Tigers do not permit free and fair
elections. We cannot justify human rights violations on the grounds that the
Tigers violate human rights as a norm and at will. We cannot justify
intolerance on the grounds that the Tigers are fundamentally intolerant. We
cannot use the LTTE's ethnic cleansing to justify our own attempts at
expelling our Tamils from lodges in their own country. Tit for tat or an eye
for an eye is not a civilised practice; nor is it a sensible one. If the
regime succumbs to such thinking, unreason will triumph, as it did in July
1983.
