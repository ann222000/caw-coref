*If the military is going to Mexico to fight the drug cartel, why is the US
not jailing drug runners with smaller than 500lb loads of drugs?

If you're caught with two pounds of pot that you plan to sell, plan on going
to jail for up to seven years.

With 500 pounds, you can kiss your freedom completely goodbye.

But head down to Southern Arizona, near the border, do the exact same thing,
and in many cases you get off scott-free.

No prosecution, no penalty, no prison...in fact - not even a slap on the
hand.

County prosecutors say it's enormously frustrating and for the drug cartels,
enormously profitable.

But this sweet deal only applies if you're illegal and smuggling 500-pounds
or less.

And therein lies one of our country's dirty little secrets: Mexican drug
runners getting a free pass back to Mexico if they're caught with less than
a quarter-ton of pot.

Cochise County attorney Ed Rheinheimer spells it out. &quot;If a seizure is made
of an amount less than 500 pounds, the case doesn't get prosecuted.&quot;

You read that right.

Drug runners doing business without punishment.

But don't blame the county attorneys.

Remember: These are federal cases and should be federally prosecuted.

But guess what?

They don't get prosecuted by the feds and now, they don't get prosecuted by
guys like Ed Rheinheimer, either.

&quot;Since 2003 we stopped prosecuting federal referrals because of a lack of
resources.&quot;

Until 2003 Rheinheimer's office handled about 150-of these federal cases a
year.

Quantities of pot annually with a street value as high as 60-million bucks.

But his county, like others, didn't have the money, prosecutors, jail space
or court-appointed attorneys to keep up with a federal referral literally
every other day.

&quot;When the marijuana ends up in a middle school in Lincoln, Nebraska, the
parents of the kids who get a hold of that marijuana have no idea that the
reason that stuff ended up in Nebraska was because the federal government is
not prosecuting the stuff on the border and allowing the stuff to get
through,&quot; says Rheinheimer.

And while these &quot;weight limits&quot; are unfamiliar to most Americans - drug
cartels know them well and plan accordingly.

Sergeant Terry Parish warehouses the seizures.  We walked through store
rooms holding marijuana from floor to ceiling.

Lisa Fletcher: &quot;How many of these guys do you think are aware of this sort
of unspoken rule that if you've got less than 500 pounds, you're probably
not going to get prosecuted?&quot;

&quot;I think probably more of them are aware of it than individual officers
are.  Their intelligence is very good, it's what they do for a living.&quot;

And they do it every night...all along Arizona's border.

We spent two nights down there with deputies and border patrol and watched
as drug runners tried to race through.  One group we chased ended up dumping
their load to try to get away.  Not that it would have mattered. We were in
Santa Cruz county - another border county that can't afford to handle the
criminals the feds won't take.

Sergeant Parish told us the thinks it's almost criminal.  &quot;As a law
enforcement officer it makes me feel terrible.  As a citizen of this country
it makes me feel terrible.&quot;

It's hard to know how many drug runners are getting a free bus ride back to
Mexico because no one seems to keep track.

We went looking for answers to the office of Dan Knauss - the US Attorney
for Arizona.

Lisa Fletcher: &quot;You are the top dog for federal prosecution in this state.
How do you justify to Arizona citizens that you are blowing-off these 400,
500 pound loads of marijuana that are routinely coming into our state?  US
Attorney for Arizona Dan Knauss:  &quot;It's easy.  We don't have the money and
the resources.  I can't create that.  It has to come from Congress.&quot;

It's Knauss's office that should handle the cases now going unprosecuted.

&quot;If they close the border and shut if off we wouldn't have an issue,&quot; says
Knauss.

Lisa Fletcher: &quot;So really what's going on in the counties is a microcosm of
what is going on in your office?&quot;

US Attorney for Arizona Dan Knauss: &quot;Exactly.&quot;

Lisa Fletcher : &quot;So are you screaming to DC?&quot;

US Attorney for Arizona Dan Knauss:  &quot;They know.  We're tapped out.  We're
redlining our lawyers.  We have higher case loads than just about any US
Attorney's office in the country.&quot;

But even on top of the nation's pot pipeline, he says there's not much he
can do.

&quot;We have no choice.  I have got no people to handle the cases.  What am I
going to do?&quot;

The only r3eason American military should enter Mexico is to force all those

*PREMEDITATED MERGER
*U.S. military headed next for Mexican soil?
Help in war on drug cartels on coming SPP summit agenda

Posted: August 10, 2007
1:00 a.m. Eastern

By Jerome R. Corsi
(c) 2007 WorldNetDaily.com

A Texas congressman is leading discussions with the White House to develop a
military plan to assist Mexico in the war President Felipe Calderón is
waging against the drug cartels.

Yolanda Urrabazo, spokeswoman for Rep. Henry Cuellar,
D-Texas&lt; http://www.wnd.com/redir/r.asp?http://www.house.gov/cuellar/ &gt;,
told WND the discussions involve the possibility of utilizing the U.S.
military directly in the effort in addition to providing military
assistance.

The Bush administration is considering a multi-year multi-million dollar
military assistance package that could include telephone-tapping equipment,
Blackhawk helicopters, radar to track drug shipments and training, according
to the Associated Press.

Until now, there has been no mention that the assistance might include
direct U.S. military involvement in Mexico.

*(Story continues below)*

Urrabazo also confirmed to WND that the issue of involving the U.S. military
and providing military assistance to Mexico would be on the agenda of the
upcoming third summit of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North
America, or SPP, scheduled Aug. 20-21 in Montebello, Quebec.

Cuellar's district includes Laredo, Texas, which has been considered ground
zero for spillover of the Mexican drug war into the U.S..

On Jan 17, Cuellar filed H.R. 502, entitled the &quot;Prosperous and Secure
Neighbor Alliance Act of
2007,&quot;&lt; http://www.wnd.com/redir/r.asp?http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/C?... &gt;which
originally proposed providing military assistance to Mexico to fight
the war on the Mexican drug cartels.

H.R. 502 proposed to spend $90 million to provide Mexican law enforcement
with sophisticated military technology, training and equipment from the U.S.
military to assist Mexico in fighting the drug war.

The other goal of the bill was to spend another $80 million to provide
economic development assistance to Mexico under the premise that combating
Mexican poverty would also combat Mexican drugs.

H.R. 502 was referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The committee
press office told WND no hearings on the bill have been scheduled.

The legislation, however, placed Cuellar at the forefront of the effort to
involve the U.S. military in Mexico's war on the drug cartels.

Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, whose district includes El Paso, has joined
Cuellar in urging the Bush administration to allocate up to $850 million
over the next five years to help train Mexican law enforcement and military
personnel to utilize the advanced military equipment the U.S. is planning to
send to Mexico in a drug-related military assistance effort.

Soon after taking office this year, Calderón ordered some 20,000 Mexican
troops to get involved domestically in combating the Mexican drug cartels.
Current efforts to involve the U.S. military attest to the limited success
Calderón and the Mexican military have had in their war on drugs. Over 3,000
Mexican civilians have been killed in the drug war so far this year.

WND previously reported &lt; http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=56809 &gt; a
document &lt; http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=56813 &gt; obtained through
an Access to Information Act request in Canada shows a secondary focus of
the SPP leader's meeting in Montebello will be to prepare for a continental
avian flu or human pandemic and to establish a permanent continental
emergency management coordinating body to deal not only with health
emergencies but other unspecified emergencies as well.

WND previously reported
&lt; http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55824 &gt;on National Security
Presidential Directive No. 51 and Homeland Security
Directive No. 20, which allocate to the office of the president the
authority to direct all levels of government in the event the president
declares a national emergency.

WND also previously
reported&lt; http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=56014 &gt;that under
SPP, the military of the
U.S. and Canada are turning USNORTHCOM into a domestic military command
structure, with authority extending to Mexico, even though Mexico has not
formally joined with the current U.S.-Canadian USNORTHCOM command structure.

WND inquired of USNORTHCOM whether the U.S. military's involvement in the
Mexican drug war, either directly or indirectly through foreign military
aid, would involve USNORTHCOM.

USNORTHCOM spokesman Michael Kucharek responded, saying it was premature for
USNORTHCOM to discuss any possible involvement with Mexico in any military
assistance program which might be forthcoming from the Bush administration.

The White House, the State Department and the Drug Enforcement
Administration did not return WND phone calls asking for comment.
