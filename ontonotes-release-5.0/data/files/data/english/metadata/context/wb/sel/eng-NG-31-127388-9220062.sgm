I visited Miller website just to drool and looked at the stick welding
section. They list some stick welders that could go up to 800 amps.

I just wanted to hear just what kjinds of welding rod could be used at
800 amps and what does the process look like. I rarely exceed 150 amp
when stick welding. (not that I am saying that there is nothing beyond
it, only that I did not need it)

One needs at least 400 amps at 100 percent duty cycle to arc air gouge
with carbon rods.
Welding shops that do heavy equipment repairs need such power supplies.
Often 1000 amp constant current machines in shops are used for gouging.  I
have used gouging rods that were half inch in diameter.
Wire feed semiautomatic processes are usually constant voltage however
submerged arc welding can use D.C. constant current or even alternating
current.  I have seen over 900 amps run through a 5/32 inch diameter wire
doing submerged arc.
It is rare now that any money can be made welding with large diameter
welding rods.
Wire feed is the profitable way to go.

When I was in the oilfield, a lot of jacket fab was going on at shipyards.
A jacket looks like a windmill or high tension tower, A-shaped but is made
laying on its side.  It is made out of large diameter pipe.  They used very
large rods on them, I don't know the diameter.  They were like 1.5 to 2x the
length of average rod, too.  The stubs were big as cigars.  Maybe some of
those.

I'll have to listen for more informed answers.

A friend worked in a steel mill, for a short time, and a good while
ago.

He was doing things with rod, 30-some inches long. I don't recall, I'm
sure the rods were 1/2 inch or larger.

Any of the 'Jet' rods (high deposit rates) from Lincoln want around 350
to 400 amps in the 1/4&quot; size. They lay down beautiful beads but the
puddle is just one runny mess so downhand only. This is pretty much the
turf of wire feed or submerged arc these days. These rods have a lot of
metal in the coating, the arc just melts that along with the core rod.
http://content.lincolnelectric.com/pdfs/products/literature/c210.pdf

As others mentioned, arc gouging is the other high amperage area.

One thing to look at in the amperage ratings is the 100% duty cycle
rating. Arc gouging can run close to 100% duty cycle, downhand on a long
seam can easily get over 80% to 85%. That might knock the 800 amps down
considerably.

Running these high currents is a real pain. #12 or #13 shades, insulated
gloves, full leathers, even a bucket of water to toss the stinger in
after it gets too hot to touch (with gloves!).

Ditto what Zimmerman said.
I work at the mines and we have plenty of machines this size.  A 500 is a
standard size, but not really quite enough to drive any big loads like
gouging.  We dont have any machines smaller than 500's around.  800's and
1000's are in abundance and they are more the way to go.  Some stick welding
goes up to about 400A, but we dont do so much of that.  Mostly these units
are used to drive arc air gouging where the 800-1000A really helps.  You can
drive the 1/2&quot; carbons pretty easy with these, and the harder to drive flat
carbons.  These units are also used to drive the sub arc tractors and a 1000
is about what you want for that.

I have not run flat carbons in years.  They are very versatile having a
cross section much like a carpenters pencil.  You can trough out a wide
groove or turn them a bit and push out a narrow groove.
For people who have not done arc gouging I liken it to pushing a blunt
pencil along the surface of a block of butter.  The air blows away the
bulldozed refuse and leaves you a nice rounded channel.  It is important to
ensure you don't leave any bits of carbon down in there to contaminate the
weld.
Shawn is right... that even 500 is barely enough:')  The bigger the
machine the better.  Imagine a repair to a huge bucket that goes on for
weeks 24-7..... Then another one comes in for repair.

Check out www.weldmold.com
They used to make some pretty large electrodes.
800amps wouldn't come near what they need.

I want to thank everyone. Looks like these capacities are mostly so
that these welders can be used for submerged arc welding, or gouging,
but not as much for stick. Very interesting.

So why exactly are you two doing all this gouging?  Is it mostly to repair
cracks?  So you gouge out the cracks and fill it in with weld?  Or are
there other uses for it?  Is it used for general cutting instead of other
options like oxy or plasma?

I've played with air-arc a little bit at school to burn off backing strips.
I was using a machine in the 400 amp range turned all the way up.  Your
description of pushing a pencil through butter is spot on.  I can also
understand why you would want much larger machines than 400 amps when
working on thicker metal.

Working in a naval shipyard, we use these machines all the time to
backgouge for full-penny welds.  Crack repairs can often require a heavy
duty machine.

Or, Lord forbid, some idiot puts the wrong wire into a submarine hull
cut.  Or they try welding a SubSafe hatch by laying unburned sticks of
11018-M in the bottom of the groove!

I've seen both of the above happen, and I have had to gouge out other
people's F*&amp;k-U%$ before.

Just thank GOD that all Pressure Hull work gets MT, UT, and or RT
tested!!

The flats are a bit more expensive than the rounds and harder to drive but
very nice to use.  I like them for clean up work when there is just too much
weld left, say, when oxy cutting off a piece of 2&quot; plate from another piece
of 2&quot; plate and there is a 1&quot; fillet, you can use the flat gouging rods to
give you very minimal clean up time with a grinder afterwards.

They also have 'slotted' carbons where there is a slot in one end of the
rod, and a nub on the other end.  As the rod becomes too short to be of use,
you put a fresh rod in and attach the stub to the end of it, meaning you
never waste any rod (or have to clean up stubs!).

Back in the 60's there were some commercial power station reactor
vessels that the welders had done the &quot;lay extra rod in the groove&quot;.

Found it during the Gamma ray exams.  Some of the welders were really
whizzed about being caught and having to grind it all out and do it
right the second time.
