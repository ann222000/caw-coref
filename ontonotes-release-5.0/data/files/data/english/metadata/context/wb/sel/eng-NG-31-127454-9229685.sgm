Disney TV in the USA just started showing trailers for a new live action
kids show/sit-com call &quot;The Wizards of Waverly Place.&quot;  It sounds more than
a little like a HP clone, just different enough not to be considered a
rip-off.

It is about a family of Wizard children living in New York City with their
human mother and Wizard father (stripped of his powers though).  Apparently
they must keep their powers hidden, &amp; are only allowed to use magic while in
training.  The chief difference between this and HP is the kids at
apparently home schooled in magic, and only ONE per family (the best at
magic) is allowed to keep their powers as an adult.

Sounds interesting.  There was a show on one of the cable channels about
a teen witch at a school for witches (Which Witch?) that was amusing,
and the kids were fun.  Might try to catch that one.  Thanks for the
heads-up.

A lot of magic training stories abound.  HP made them hot, and in
fashion.  But few are actually ripoffs.  In the same vein is more
accurate.

Take the Winx Club.  very similair tp HP, but not a ripoff.  Girl
saves a fairy, finds out she's a fairy, goes to a school to learn to
be a fairy.  Fights evil world domianting witches, and powerful, evil
magic dudes, find sout the evilest of all, imprisoned for 17 years by
the Company of Light (semi reformed, and which includes his girlfriend
who turned against him, and is sorta evilish), killed her parents, and
she was sent to Earth to live in safety.  Now, she's learning to use
the magic necessary to beat him once and or all, though it might
defeat her as well.

Very HP like, but still quite different.

If it's by Disney, it will be sickeningly sweet, and dripping with family
values.
It will lack substance, and certainly won't have that dark edge, and subtle
humour that crept into the Potter series as it progressed.
Every episode will have a happy ending.
All the children will be portrayed as highly intelligent genius'.
All the adults will be portrayed as bungling buffoons with no street-smarts.
All the gags will be obvious and painfully embarassing, and their punchlines
will be so well signposted that they've been stripped of all humour long
before their delivery.

In short, it will be painfull to watch.

This is the Disney formula.
They are such a disappointingly predictable company.

I'm glad you wrote &quot;company&quot; because Walt definitely had that dark edge
and regularly scared the sh#t out of me when I was a kid. More than once
I have caught myself visualizing scenes from HP as though they were done
in the style of the Wicked Witch's death in Snow White. I would trade
Dan, Rupert and Emma for Walt's (non musical) hand drawn version any day.

Bless you for saying this.  How can one truly respect an organization that
takes a great work of literature (Victor Hugo's &quot;The Hunchback of Notre

I'm sorry, but it simply cannot be done.

I watched the YouTube trailer for this show, and yes, it does look to be

Which one? There were 3.
The Pilot, a trip to Rome, and a trip to Australia

BTW Sabrina can't be seen as a clone or rip off of HP, it's older than HP by
quite a bit.  Sabrina started on the &quot;Archie&quot; comics in 1962, even the TV
pilot movie &amp; 1st episode of the TV series was a year before the first
release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

Nope, When Micheal Eisner ran Disney, he actually had a rule that no
&quot;offical&quot; Disney series (shows made for other networks didn't count) be more
than 65 episodes, even if VERY popular.

When he left in 2005, the rule left with him or was at least relaxed.  The
first two Disney shows to break the rule was &quot;That's so Raven&quot; and &quot;Kim
Possible.&quot;  Kim Possible had already been cancelled (65 episode limit), but
had so many vocal fans it was given one more season so Kim could complete
High School.   &quot;Raven&quot; did have more episodes (past 65) already in the works
but with major location/plot changes and was going to be considered a
&quot;spin-off.&quot;

One of the last seasons of Charmed also had a School of Magic.
(from Wiki, 'cause I really didn't follow the series after season 3)

&quot;Magic school is a place where young or novice witches or supernatural
beings learn to improve their magical craft and history. There are
classes for students in telekinesis, spell-casting, potion-making,
astral projection, medieval weaponry, etc.; understanding the history of
good magic, learning about the moral implications on magic, and also
basic classes like literature.

It is magically protected so that no evil can enter in order to protect
the often vulnerable students. On one occasion, the Headless Horseman is
magically created and begins to decapitate faculty, staff and students.
Fortunately the school is also magically protected so that no one can be
hurt or killed while on premises, and the Horseman's effects are
returned to normal.[1]

Magic School is originally run by Gideon but after it is revealed that
he seeks to kill one of the Charmed Ones' children (Wyatt Halliwell),
Wyatt's father, Leo kills Gideon[2] thus leaving Paige Matthews to take
over as headmistress. Once Paige seeks to have more life away from
magic, she convinces Leo to later become the new headmaster of Magic
School.&quot;

Just another person who thinks if he doesn't like something, it isn't
any good.
Disney caters to a younger crowd than what is on this group, and they
have a nasty habit of growing up, and wanting something different pretty
often.  Disney does rotate its shows pretty often, given that the people
ON the shows grow so fast that they aren't suitable for the parts any more.

It's an insult to Disney and their sick policy of 65 eps and that's
it.  If you're lucky.  Phil Of The Future got less (and the writers
planned a season 3).  That's So Raven got 100 (still haven't aired
them all, yet already spun off Corey In The House).  Kim Possible
series finaled with the two hour movie, So Not The Drama, but fans
revolted and got Season 4 (which i think is ending witht eh 1 hour Fri
ep.  Well, it's ending soon enough).  I believe Jake Long American
Dragon just series finaled (all the classic ending signs, but it's due
to end soon anyway), The Suite Life Of Zac And Cody wrapped up filming
and have already destroyed their sets (but still have most of Season 3
to air.)

It's also to make anybody bothered by the HP ripping off happier
knowing it's not gonna last too long.

It all started when Disney wanted to syndicate their cartoons.  Live
action needs 66 eps before syndication.  Cartoons, based off the 13
Week Sat Morning schedule, gets 65 (5 days a week, for 13 weeks).
Somehow, Disney decided that getting enough eps to syndciate is enough
to ever make.  A few exceptions crop up every now and then, and the
rare fan intervention.

Disney says Hilary Duff got to old for the target demos, but Lizzie
McGuire also was hitting the 65 ep mark.

And My point was that Magic is a Disney &quot;Trademark&quot; that they have

success of HP.  If similar series, written or television, were performing
poorly then they'd be unlikely to market their own.

So while they mey not be influenced creatively by HP they would very likely
be influenced by it in other areas.

Not a movie, a 1/2 hour animated cartoon show based on their Hercules
animated movie.  Young Hercules goes to a school called &quot;Prometheus Academy&quot;
with both mortal &amp; Gods like Hercules, Adonis, Cassandra, &amp; Icarus
(flame-broiled but still alive.)  There were several episodes were figures
from the Trojan war fight or compete with each other at the school.

BTW this is a Disney was that was axed after 65 episodes, it was popular
with kids but not really with adults.

I think it is likely that there won't be a lot of &quot;magical school&quot;
stories for a while, just because authors don't want to be called
copycats.  Series that are already started will continue, no doubt.

&gt;Disney caters to a younger crowd than what is on this group, and they

Maybe if they stopped hiring older people to play the younger roles,

Which is what my earlier reply was about.  There's been a lot of those
stuff around, with many similarities to HP without being because of

They were influenced buy it's success.  Notice after HP hit it big,
magic was everywhere, even the Power Rangers for some reason.  Themes
beget themes.  If magic's big, everybody wants magic.  Publisher's
become more interested in magic stories because that's what's hot and
is selling.  Disney sees HP going strong for years, sees magic's the
hip new thing for the kiddies.  So, they start shopping around for a
magic show that meets their show criteria.

Are the shows influenced by HP.  Not really.  Maybe a bit here and
there.  Maybe more wizards can go invisible, but most stuff is
original, or just naturally similar.  But people can't comprehend
similar but different.  We've all seen the posts insisting JK ripped
off, was influenced, based HP off of LOTR, Bewitched, or this or that.
and we've all seen the posts saying this and that was clearly ripped
off of HP.  None of which is true.  Magic schools and such have been
around for ages.  Disney's own Darkwing Duck had Morgana, a witch, who
went to a witch school.  Gosalyn wants to go, then finds out magic is
not all simple wand waving, but pure work.  You've got to know
recipes, wiggle your fingers just right, compute various effects and
what not.  Magic is hard work.  And this was way before HP.  A magic
school where short cuts backfired.  IE, inadvertently selling you
dad's soul for power (and then strangely, Disney pulls the ep a little
later on).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sounds interesting.  There was a show on one of the cable channels about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a teen witch at a school for witches (Which Witch?) that was amusing,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and the kids were fun.  Might try to catch that one.  Thanks for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;heads-up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Worst Witch?  HBO did a movie, and then turned it into a series.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Series not as good as the movie.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I've just remembered Sabrina, the teenage witch - I'd forgotten that,
&gt;&gt;&gt;though
&gt;&gt;&gt;I rather liked it, though didn't like the film  :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;DaveD

&gt;&gt; They also changed the Aunt's personalities between versions.  and
&gt;&gt; Muggles are just called Mortals.  And Sabrina's a half blood.

&gt;And the TV show started out a year BEFORE the first HP book was even
&gt;published, and the actual character &quot;Sabrina&quot; started out in 1962 in the
&gt;&quot;Archie&quot; comics.

And had a cartoon series before Hart family one. And in the hart one
at least, Sabrina goes to a witch boot camp.
