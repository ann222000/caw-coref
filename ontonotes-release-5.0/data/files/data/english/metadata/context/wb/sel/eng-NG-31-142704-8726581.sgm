CAMBODIAN LEADERS ON NOTICE

It seems the time has come when Cambodian leaders are under pressure
to take responsibility for their actions. The Khmer Rouge trial and a
recent public call by obscure US based Cambodian Action Committee for
Justice and Equity (CACJE) for the retired king to answer in court for
his past actions indicate that sooner or later the leaders can no
longer avoid facing up to their responsibilities.

However, reactions to the demand of the CACJE show it may take a while
longer before Cambodian leaders develop sufficient courage to
voluntarily take responsibilities for their actions. Many, including
the ruling party, have immediately jumped to the former king's
defence, and outright condemned the CACJE for such a dare. The
reactions seem to assume the retired king is guilty, and thus needs
all protection he can muster to avoid a court of law. However, the
former King may just forgo what is an opportunity for him to set the
record straight once and for all, which is best done in a credible
court, like the Khmer Rouge tribunal. Only then will the former king
be left in peace without hurtful insinuations in his remaining years.
This court option would, nevertheless, require a great deal of courage
on his part, which is not a forte of leaders who are accustomed to not
answering for their actions.

These leaders only know that the buck stops somewhere else, not with
them. The former king puts the blame squarely on the republicans for
what happened to Cambodian people. The republican leaders point the
finger to the former king for joining the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge
leaders hold foreign forces responsible for the massacre under their
administration. None can accept any propositions that may have
anything to do with their own ineffectual leadership.

Their inability to look inward to determine why they fail continually
to serve and protect their own citizens may relate to a mindset that
has repeatedly manifested itself since the collapse of Angkor. The
Khmer words for ascending the throne are &quot;souy reach&quot;, which literally
mean &quot;consuming wealth&quot; reflecting a destructive attitude that leaders
are at the top just to enjoy themselves. The obligation of protecting
and building up wealth for the nation has been foreign to Cambodian
leaders for centuries. The indulgence without any regard for
responsibility obviously entices many to do whatever it takes to reach
the top and stay there.

Nevertheless, the successive irresponsibility may come to an end with
the Khmer Rouge tribunal and the CACJE demand. They may mark the
beginning of the end of passivism that has thrown Cambodian people
into chaos and premature death every time there is a change at the
top. When the people begin to ask difficult questions, the leaders
will find it hard to run away from their responsibilities. The
Cambodian people are, in effect, starting to put their leaders on
notice.

WAT TO GO

·      The minutes of the meeting of the Khmer Rouge leaders on 11 March
1976 stop short of making an explicit call for an execution of the
former King's sons. But this does not stop the current prime minister
- he must know the Khmer Rouge well - from claiming that they really
call for the execution.
