Hi everyone,
I haven't been on here in a long time since I graduated and moved and
got a new job.  But I'm back and I have a dilemma of sorts.
I'm working on the Diamond Jubilee quilt from last years "Quilts With
Style" magazine.  I love to piece quilt tops but I'm not crazy about the
actual quilting.  Also, I have a down comforter that I love and am not real
likely to use a quilt on top of it year round.  So, here's my actual
question: Do you think I could make the quilt top into a duvet cover???
Here's what I'm thinking....I could finish the top, quilt in the ditch
to a backing without any batting.  That would stabilize the top.  Then take
that and sew it to another large backing along 3 edges and bind around it
all.  Buttons along the top, and that would make a duvet cover.
Please let me know what you all think of this...would it work? Would you
change something? Etc.etc...
Thanks so much in advance!!

hmmmm, i think i'd make the quilt so it only attaches to the duvet cover for
ease of separate washing. also means you'd be able to use it elsewhere on
its own if you wanted to anytime.
just my 2 cents,

I've seen this done and it looks fine. Quilting in the ditch is still
quilting. So what you are suggesting is still making a quilt. Your just
adding another backing to cover your duvet. I would just stitch in the
ditch and use it as a summer quilt. But if you don't use a different
quilt depending on the seasons I think go ahead and make the cover. I'm
one for using quilts rather than them being stuck in a closet somewhere.
So what ever makes you happy.

I have done almost exactly what you suggest, Sara.  What I did
differently was to sew press stud tape all around.  That meant that the
pieced top didn't have to get washed so much.  The raw edges of the
'backing' were sewn under the press stud tape.  I didn't bind the two
top layers, just turned the edges in and under the other half of the
press stud tape.

Yes, I feel the same about using them, that's why I wanted to try making a
top into a cover, since I use the comforter all year long.
I see what you mean about it still technically being a quilt....my thought
was that a pieced top would need some sort of stabilization under it and
would need to be stitched down....what do you think?  I just feel like I'm
not all that creative or experienced yet to know what other designs I want
to quilt and once I get the top pieced, I feel like I want it to be
completely done already!

Thanks for all your suggestions so far!!

It should work nicely.  My understanding of a duvet cover is something
like a giant pillow case with the addition of some form of closure at
the open end.  You could use snaps or velcro instead of buttons if you
think the buttons might annoy you.  You could also make it rather more
like an envelope, so you fold a bit of the back of the cover over the
front and then button down.

Two ideas come to mind on this, coming from my own store bought duvet cover.
1) Move the opening down about 12-18" from the edge on the back and use a
flap to attach the buttons and button holes. It's a little more work, but
having the flap moved down gives more room for the buttons, less wear and
tear on them and you don't rub them while sleeping.
2) Put little ties (or similar) inside the corners to secure your comforter.
It will keep the comforter from slipping around.

Other than that, have fun!!!

I think you are right I would back the top with something, even cheap
fabric just to prevent wear and tear. Duvet covers do move a lot.

But don't worry about just doing stitch in the ditch. I did that for
about 4 or 5 years before I learned anything else. In fact it's only
recently that I seem to be able to do free motion quilting. Trust me I
tried many many times and it was horrible. So I'm still content with
SITD. I was more interested in mastering piecing first. If you do decide
to back you don't need batting between the top and cheap piece. You also
don't need to do a whole lot of stitching in the ditch because it won't
be to hold the batting in place. You could just do a bit in the middle
and around the edges to make it lay flat.

I also like someone else's suggestion that you use like a double fold at
the end that is going to open. I also would not use buttons I would use
infant snap tape. They are little snaps that come all ready sewn on
tape. You just have to buy the amount you need. If you choose to use any
fasteners at all. Some have suggested if you use the snap tape get the
plastic ones not the metal, as the metal can rust and ruin the material
it's close too.

My true preference is to sew a loop on all four corners of the duvet,
then but a tiny amount of either velcor or very small buttons where the
duvet would attach inside at the corners. This stops the duvet from
moving or bunching up in the middle of the cover. If you do the corners
like that then you don't need the snap tape at the closing, you can just
do the double fold thing. I know this is probably clear as mud but maybe
someone else can explain it a little better than I.

Don't worry about being creative enough or experienced enough. How do
you think most of us have learned? Trial and error. This group is great
for advice but you still need to find what you are comfortable with. I
would have never dreamed even a year ago that I could do free motion
quilting. Tried so many times and failed. Now it seems easy. So if you
like something keep trying. If you don't like it then don't. I too still
think I lack in the design part, or even picking colors some times. I
always ask for help but the final desicion is mine. And I can honestly
say I have never regretted trying anything. It's always a learning
experience and fun too.

but if you put the buttons at the foot end, they don't rub whilst sleeping,
move them up and they's be at your toes or ankles.

Sorry I wasn't clear! Down from the top, and face them toward the inside
(button facing in so it is on the inside of the flap and buttons kinda
backward toward the center) if that makes any sense. I had one cover that
had bottom buttons and they took a lot of stress and many popped off because
the comforter would bunch up down there and pull at the opening. When the
opening is moved down from the top, you don't really feel them. I suppose it
could be anywhere (like knee area maybe) as long as the flap tucks them in.
Just my experience anyway. YMMV :-)

Yes, definitely line/back the pieced top, Sara.  The seams will need
protection from friction, if nothing else!  Quilting in the ditch is a
perfectly fine way of quilting - it isn't that easy, either!  So it will
be an achievement to do a whole quilt like that.

Are comforters and duvets the same - I have seen comforters in shops
which were a patterned bedcover to match curtains, etc. I remember my
sister was going to have one instead of a duvet but then realised you
couldn't take the cover off.

Duvets first came to the UK in about the late 1960's, and are now the
usual bed covering. I wonder if your 'duvets' are the same as ours over
here, as I've never had one move in its bag and need tying down, or
ending as a bundle at the bottom of the bag. Have had synthetic, feather
and down, and we bought ourselves a pure down one for Christmas - its
wonderful - as light as a feather and really warm. I just give it a
shake in the morning to fluff up the down - like you do feather
cushions. The duvet has a crisp, slightly shiny cotton cover which is
machine stitched so the down is all in little 12" squares so the filling
can't go anywhere!

The covers I have fasten right at the bottom with a line of concealed
buttons, or with a strip of the readymade poppers. As the duvet hangs
over the end  of the bed the end is way below foot level, and anyway the
opening is very firmly buttoned up! They don't have the extra little
flap that pillowcases have. We don't use a top sheet as that stops the
duvet moulding to your body as you lie in bed, which is what they are
supposed to do.

I wash our duvet cover at the same time as the bottom sheet and
pillowcases, so a pieced bag would soon get faded with me. Our duvet
covers are all cream polycotton like the sheet, and I put a quilt over
the top of everything during the day and take if off at night as duvets
work better when the filling can puff up.

Incidently when we stayed in Sweden I noticed that their covers had a
little slit in the top corners where the top and bottom were not joined
for about 3". When you were putting the cover on you could pull the
quilt right into the corners - made the battle easier! I altered all
ours - but that was in 1978 and I didn't get round to it with subsequent
covers!

I did this when I was getting started in patchwork.  Just did a "trip
around the world" pattern to keep it simple.  Anyway, that duvet cover
is still on our bed and has even been through the wash no problem.
FWIW I did not add a backing to the top.  The only problem is that some
of the fabrics are wearing out - since I was a newbie I skimped on some
of the fabric and the poor quality ones are developing holes.  Guess
it's time to make a new cover with better fabric!
