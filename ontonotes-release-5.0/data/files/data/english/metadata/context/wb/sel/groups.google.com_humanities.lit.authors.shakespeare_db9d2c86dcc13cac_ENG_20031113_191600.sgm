Two classic near-anagrams for Oxford's (shortened) motto
&quot;Vero Nil Verius&quot;

are: &quot;our ever-livin(g)&quot;&amp;
&quot;enviou(s) sliver&quot;

There are only 3 such near-anagrams in the 3M set:

1) &quot;univers(e) revol&quot; (Moby Dick)
2) &quot;ourles(s) Iverni&quot; (Finnegans Wake)
3) &quot;ere sinvoriv(a)l&quot; (Finnegans Wake)

Therefore a &quot;Vero Nil Verius&quot; 13 letter near-anagram
is still a one in a million chance.
------------------------------------------------------
HAMLET: How all occasions do inform against me,
And spur my dull REVEnge! What is a man,
If his chief good and market of his time
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
Looking before and after, gave us not
That capability and god-like reason
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be

BESTIAL OBLIVION, OR SOME CRAVEN SCRUPLE OF THINKING

too precisely on the event,
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
And ever three parts coward, I do not know
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Sith I have cause and WILL and strength and means
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
Makes mouths at the invisible event,
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
Is not to stir without great argument,
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,

That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,

Excitements of my reason and my blood,
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Which is not TOMB enough and continent
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
-----------------------------------------------------------
Claudius reads Hamlet's letter to Laertes:
Folio version (Act 4, Scene 7)

'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my
sudden *and more strange return.' 'HAMLET.'*

_Moby Dick_ requires a 39 letter string:

2) &quot;ventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors&quot;
----------------------------------------------------------------
However, a *single Act* of _Hamlet_ (Q2 Act 4) has not one
but TWO such strings with less than 36 letters!

&quot;CLAMBRING TO HANG, AN ENVIOUS SLIVER BROKE&quot; 35 letters
&quot;BLIVION, OR SOME CRAVEN SCRUPLE OF THINK&quot; 33 letters

Estimated probability of finding the

33 letters { &quot;BLIVION, OR SOME CRAVEN SCRUPLE OF THINK&quot; }

&lt;&lt;William Shakespeare: 38 plays, 154 sonnets and 2 epic narrative poems. In
all of Shakespeare's works there are a total of 884,647 words, 118,406
lines, and 31,959 speeches. Shakespeare's vocabulary comprises 29,066 words,
many of which are acknowledged by the Oxford English Dictionary as being
coined by Shakespeare (i.e. they are first seen in the printed editions of
his plays). These include: accessible, barefaced, exposure, lament,
paternal, puke, roadway, schoolboy, and watchdog. Think where we would be
without Shakespeare. Phrases which we use and hear everyday were coined by
this one man; 'Brave new world' (The Tempest), 'Bated breath' (The Merchant
of Venice), 'We have seen better days' (As You Like It), 'Cruel to be kind'
(Hamlet), 'A tower of strength' (Richard III), and 'Foregone conclusion'
(Othello). Shakespeare's vocabulary, whether or not a person has ever read
or even seen any of his works, is integral to our culture and language.&gt;&gt;

The Earle of Oxforde:

&lt;&lt;Sitting alone upon my thought in melancholy mood,
In sight of sea, and at my back an ancient hoary wood,
I saw a fair young lady come, her SECRET fears to wail,
Clad all in colour of a nun, and covered with a VEIL;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Genesis 38: And [Tamar] put her widow's garments off from her, and
covered her with a VAIL, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place,.
. . And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? And he
said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy
bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and
came in unto her, and she conceived by him. And she arose,
and went away, and laid by her VAIL from her,
and put on the garments of her widowhood.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------
&quot;NIL VERO-VERIUS&quot;
VOILE SURVENIR: VEIL TO OCCUR . . .
VOILER UNIVERS: TO VEIL UNIVERSE.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Yet (for the day was calm and clear) I might discern her face,
As one might see a damask rose hid under crystal GLASS.

Three times, with her soft hand, full hard on her left side she knocks,
And sigh'd so sore as might have mov'd some pity in the rocks;
From sighs and shedding amber tears into sweet song she brake,
When thus the ECHO answered her to every word she spake:

Titus Andronicus Act 2, Scene 3

TAMORA The green leaves QUIVER with the cooling wind
And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:
Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
And, whilst the babbling ECHO mocks the hounds,

Oh heavens ! who was the first that bred in me this fever ? Vere (Ver.)
Who was the first that gave the wound whose fear I wear for ever ? Vere.
What tyrant, Cupid, to my harm usurps thy GOLDEN QUIVER? Vere.
What sight first caught this heart and can from bondage it DELIVER?
Vere.

Yet who doth most adore this sight, oh hollow caves tell true ? You.
What nymph deserves his liking best, yet doth in sorrow rue ? You.
What makes him not reward good will with some reward or ruth ? Youth.
What makes him show besides his birth, such pride and such untruth?
Youth.

May I his favour match with love, if he my love will try? Ay.
May I requite his birth with faith ? Then faithful will I die? Ay.
And I, that knew this lady well,
Said, Lord how great a miracle,
To her how Echo told the truth,
As true as Phoebus' oracle. The Earle of Oxforde.

QUIVER, a. [Akin to AS. cwiferlice anxiously; cf. OD. kuiven, kuiveren.]
Nimble; active. [Obs.]

King Henry IV, Part ii Act 3, Scene 2

SHALLOW He is not his craft's master; he doth not do it
right. I remember at MILE-end GREEN, when I lay at
CLEMENT's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's
show,--there was a little QUIVER fellow, and a'
would manage you his piece thus; and a' would about
and about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah,
tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; and
away again would a' go, and again would a' come:
I shall ne'er see such a fellow.

QUIVER/QUAVER, v. i. [OE. quaven to shake, to tremble;
cf. LG. quabbeln to shake, to be soft, of fat substances,
quabbe a fat lump of flesh, a dewlap, D. kwabbe, and E.
QUIVER, v.] 1. To tremble; to vibrate; to shake. --Sir I. Newton.

QUAKE, v. i. [AS. cwacian; cf. G. quackeln. Cf. {Quagmire}.] 1. To be
agitated with quick, short motions continually repeated; to shake with
fear, cold, etc.; to shudder; to tremble. &quot;Quaking for dread.''-Chaucer

She stood QUAKING like the PARTRIDGE
on which the hawk is ready to seize. --Sir P. Sidney.

Much Ado About Nothing Act 1, Scene 1

DON PEDRO Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his QUIVER in

chohh[=a]ri quiver, receptacle, G. k[&quot;o]cher quiver; akin to
AS. color, cocur, cocer, D. koker. Cf. {Cocker} a high shoe.]

&lt;&lt;&quot;AHA!&quot; cried he suddenly, smiting his hand upon his thigh &quot;I have it
now! Ride on, my MERRY men all, and let us get back to Nottingham Town
as speedily as we may. And mark well my words: before a fortnight is
passed, that evil knave Robin Hood will be safely clapped into
Nottingham gaol.&quot; But what was the Sheriff's plan?

[The Sheriff] sent messengers north &amp; south, east &amp; west, to proclaim
through town, HAMLET, and countryside, this grand shooting match,
and the prize was to be an ARROW of PURE BEATEN GOLD.

Robin Hood might be overpersuaded by his spirit to come to the butts;
and it was this thought which caused him to cry &quot;AHA!&quot;

Sir Richard gave to Robin Hood
a stout bow inlaid with the cunningest workmanship in gold,
while each arrow in his QUIVER was innocked with GOLD.

GENESIS 27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes
were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and
said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I. And he
said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death: Now
therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy QUIVER and thy bow,
and go out to the field, and take me some venison;

ISAIAH 49:1 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far;
The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath
he made mention of my name. And he hath made my mouth like a sharp
sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished
shaft; in his QUIVER hath he hid me; And said unto me, Thou art my
servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified. Then I said, I have
laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain:

JOB 39:20 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory
of his nostrils is terrible. He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his
strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. He mocketh at fear, and is
not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. The QUIVER
rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bow in Hindu Mythology

&lt;&lt;The arrow is a symbol of the intercommunication between Heaven and
Earth. In its upward flight it is connected with the symbolism of the
axis mundi. The divine archer is the one who walks between the worlds.
In the Old Testament, those whom Jehovah could use to accomplish his
works are called &quot;SONS OF THE QUIVER.&quot;

Origen, one of the early Christian &quot;fathers&quot;, likens God to an archer.
A twelfth century Italian illuminated manuscript shows God driving
Adam &amp; Eve out of the Garden of Eden with a flight of arrows,
much as Apollo in the Iliad pursued the Greeks.

The arrows of the gods never miss their mark. Those of Apollo, Artemis
and Eros were always supposed to strike the heart. Love, Ovid informs
us, uses two types of arrow which always hit their mark; if they are
tipped with gold they kindle passion, but if they are tipped with lead
they extinguish it (SPENSE: Italian EXTINGUISHED). Mystical love strikes
home like an arrow and rives the soul with torment which cannot be
assuaged. In this mystical sense, its meaning is the struggle to achieve
union with the godhead.

Of incarnations of the Divine Archer on Earth, we may instance ABARIS,
the Scythian who was a priest of Apollo. The god gave him a golden arrow
on which to ride through the air. This dart rendered him invisible; it
also cured diseases and gave oracles. ABARIS later gave it to Pythagoras
and is one of the few figures of Greek legend who can be related with
shamanism. We may note that the healers, diviners or ecstatics who might
be connected with shamanism have no relation to Dionysis.

Greek shamans are related to Apollo, and it is from the NORTH, from the
land of the Hyperboreans, from Apollo's country of origin, that they are
said to have come to Greece. Such a one was ABARIS. &quot;Carrying in his
hand the golden arrow, the proof of his Apolline origin ...

David, some asides from Art's post. First, a minor point; I notice from
Art's post Shakespeare credited with a lexicon of 29,000 words. Recently
someone contradicted my post (I said 30k words) and suggested 'from the web'
that graduate students has up to 70,000 words! whereas I has said &quot;10,000&quot;.

I would guess that a grad student had up to 2,000 words of ready speech
(words used in conversation) but could write some 5,000, understanding about
5,000 more. What's your impression?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But Art -- why should anyone (other than a farcically incompetent
&gt; cretin utterly incapable of constructing REAL anagrams -- like
&gt; aneuendorffer114 ... @comicass.nut, for example) settle for a mere
&gt;&quot;near-anagram&quot; when a GENUINE anagram such as &quot;Evil is oVERrun&quot; is so
&gt; straightforward to devise? The notion that Freemasons and Templars are
&gt; as linguistically inept as aneuendorffer114 ... @comicass.nut simply is
&gt; not credible.

"/>

Here is the main current:-

The &lt;dread-word&gt; semiotic-sense of what a word represents seems to have been
lost among a coterie of pure textualists who are reluctant to admit any
ex-disciplinary sourcing.

Anagrams and acrostics, and other textual DEVicEs do seem to litter the
literary landscape in Shakespeare. It is more difficult to resolve
references to non literary things, no? Perhaps the text is a (veiled)
reference, but not to yet other words or phrases?

Semiotically a word is a label representing something absent, which it
assumes the place of. To insist a word refers to another word is
unwarranted, and even if the substitution makes reference to an object, we
should be careful not to necessarily substitute the name of that object for
the object itself.

I note a previous Bard, a celt, mocked his confreres on this very theme.
Though there were not many texts of which to make reference, there was a
maze of oral tradition, to which he said, they had all lost the key/canon of
the Giant Albion.

Play on words evolved as literary device much later, and varieties of
textual devices and allusion were liberally sewn into widely distributed
texts for over 300 years on such particular themes as Arthurian legend,
(heavily laced with hermetics) whose puzzles much captivated the
imaginations of readers before Shakespeare's time.

That Shakespearean allusion is _limited_ to textual decryption seems
risible. If we return awhile to the preceding period, a greater variety of
reference was evident, and manuscripts also 'illuminated' by such means. If
our Author makes reference to a badge for example, it may be entirely
fruitless to investigate the word 'badge' or the name of whose badge it is,
but to examine the badge itself, which might then reveal certain glyphs or
signs which are the Author's intended reference.

I have previously encountered closed-circuit genres of investigation, where
only certain texts are admitted as sources of investigation, since those are
within relatively easy reach of the investigators, and besides, these texts
contain works with which the investigators have become jeolose authorities
thereupon; and such studies are thereby heavily resistant to things which
are not written, or not written within their particular discipline.

What Art does interests me VERy much, howEVER, I am suggesting that
entailing too great a weight of meaning solely to finding inter-textual
associations of words and phrases is a limited prospect.

Cordially, Phil Innes

&gt; risible. If we return awhile to the preceding period, a greater variety of
&gt; reference was evident, and manuscripts also 'illuminated' by such means.
If
&gt; our Author makes reference to a badge for example, it may be entirely
&gt; fruitless to investigate the word 'badge' or the name of whose badge it
is,
&gt; but to examine the badge itself, which might then reveal certain glyphs or
&gt; signs which are the Author's intended reference.

&gt; I have previously encountered closed-circuit genres of investigation,
where
&gt; only certain texts are admitted as sources of investigation, since those
are
&gt; within relatively easy reach of the investigators, and besides, these
texts
&gt; contain works with which the investigators have become jeolose authorities
&gt; thereupon; and such studies are thereby heavily resistant to things which
&gt; are not written, or not written within their particular discipline.

&gt; What Art does interests me VERy much, howEVER, I am suggesting that
&gt; entailing too great a weight of meaning solely to finding inter-textual
&gt; associations of words and phrases is a limited prospect.

&lt;&lt;[Romans] did eat edible DORMICE (GLIS GLIS) (as Magnus Pyke was
fond of telling us), for which two recipes have survived. One involves
glazing them with HONEY and then rolling them in poppy seeds
(Petronius), while the other involves stuffing them with a mixture of
pork mince, DORMOUSE meat trimmings, pepper, nuts, asafoetida
and nuoc mam and then roasting or boiling them (Apicius 8.9.1).&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------------
Count of Monte Cristo - Dumas

Monte Cristo; &quot;DORMICE are bad neighbors for us
who do not eat them preserved, as the Romans did.&quot;
&quot;What? Did the Romans eat them?&quot; said the gardener -
- &quot;ate DORMICE?&quot;
&quot;I have read so in PETRONIUS,&quot; said the count.
&quot;Really? They can't be nice, though they do say `as fat
as a DORMOUSE.' It is not a wonder they are fat,
sleeping all day, and only waking to eat all night.
---------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;The British DORMOUSE is a tree-living rodent that resembles a small
squirrel much more than it does a mouse. The name is from the Latin
dormire, to sleep, and has reference to the animal's habit of winter
hibernation. Unlike the squirrel, the DORMOUSE is nocturnal, so that
even in May (the month of Alice's adventure) it remains in a torpid
state throughout the day. In Some Reminiscences of William Michael
Rossetti, 1906, we are told that the DORMOUSE may have been
modeled after Dante Gabriel Rossetti's pet wombat,
which had a habit of sleeping on the table.

GIORDANO BRUNO
The Nolan
The Heroic Frenzies
Dedicated to that most illustrious and excellent knight
Sir. Philip Sidney

-----------------------------------------------------------

&quot;In February, 1862, General Lee bought from Captain Joseph M. Broun,
quartermaster of the Third Virginia Infantry, the gray horse so
well-known to the public as 'Traveller.' The horse was the property of
the brother of Captain Broun, Major Thomas L. Broun, also of the Third
Virginia, but who was then in Virginia. The horse was of the 'Grey
Eagle' stock, and was raised by Mr. Johnston, of the Blue Sulphur
Springs, Greenbrier county, Virginia, (now West Virginia.) As a colt,
under the name of 'Jeff. Davis,' he took the first premiums at the fairs
held in Lewisburg, in 1859 and 1860. He was purchased by Major Broun in
the Spring of 1861 at the price of one hundred and seventy-five dollars
in gold. The price paid by General Lee, (his own valuation, as Major
Brown offered to present the horse to him,) was two hundred dollars.
General Lee himself gave the name 'Traveller.' When he returned to
Richmond in the Spring of 1862, he brought back with him 'The Roan' and
'Traveller.' During the battles around Richmond, that summer, 'The Roan'
who had been gradually going blind, became unserviceable, and General
Lee began to ride 'Richmond' again, and continued to do so until the
death of the horse soon after the battle of Malvern Hill. He now began
to ride 'Traveller' regularly. 'Traveller' had no vices or tricks, but
was nervous and spirited. At the second battle of Manassas, while
General Lee was at the front reconnoitering; dismounted and holding
'Traveller' by the bridle, the horse became frightened at some movement
of the enemy and plunging pulled General Lee down on a stump, breaking
both of his hands. The General went through the remainder of that
campaign chiefly in an ambulance. When he rode on horseback, a courier
rode in front leading his horse. It was soon after this that General J.
E. B. Stuart purchased for General Lee, from Mr. Stephen Dandridge of
'The Bower,' near Martinsburg, Jefferson county, the mare 'Lucy Long.'
She was low, and easy to mount, and her gaits were easy. General Lee
rode her quite constantly until toward the close of the war, when she
was found to be in foal and was sent to the rear. About this time some
gentlemen of South West Virginia presented to General Lee a fine large
sorrel horse whom the General named 'Ajax.' This horse had a fine walk
but was too tall for the General, who seldom rode him; riding
'Traveller' almost constantly until the end of the war, and, indeed,
until the time of his death, October 12th, 1870.

1603: Middle Templar THOMAS GREENE appointed Steward (later called
Town Clerk) of Stratford. Greene held this position for the next 14 years,
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;THOMAS GREENE's Diary records scraps of Shakespeare's talk during
a crisis over land enclosure. He &amp; his brother John, who was also active
at Stratford, were called to the bar; John was a lawyer of Clements Inn.

From the Middle Temple, Greene had been solicitor for the Stratford
Corporation, before he served from 1603 to 1617 as borough steward
(by patent) and as town clerk. While waiting for a house, he had noted
in September 1609, 'I mighte stay another yeare at New Place'.&gt;&gt;
- p.384 _Shakespeare a life_ by Park Honan

&lt;&lt;[Among Thomas Greene's fellow students at the Middle Temple] there was
John MANNINGham, the now-famous diarist who described a performance
of *Twelfth Night* in the Middle Temple hall on February 2, 1602 and told
a bawdy anecdote about Shakespeare and Richard Burbage. Manningham
knew Greene, and quotes him in his diary for February 5, 1603:

&quot;There is best sport always when you put a woman on the case.&quot;&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A certain Margaret Wheelar had become pregnant by Quiney nine months
before, and this sexual conduct suddenly became evident a month after
the wedding. Wheelar &amp; child died and were buried on March 15, 1616.

On March 26, with the lawyer, THOMAS GREENE, Will's former lodger, as
prosecuting counsel, Quiney confessed in court that he had had &quot;carnal
intercourse with the said Wheelar&quot; and was sorry. He had good reason for
being genuinely sorry for, the day before the trial, Shakespeare had
altered his will drastically, much reducing poor Judith's expectation;
she was punished for her match. Thomas had to do public penance. He
appeared in the parish church on three successive Sundays at the end of
which time William Shakespeare was to be dead! Thomas had married into
the Shakespeare family without producing his share of the marriage
settlement of one hundred pounds in land. Later, he was to be fined
for swearing and for allowing drunkenness on his premises.

Yes but.

One source is Latin and the other AS.
VERE/VER also have a few other common-place meanings.
Making a specific association as Paul has below 'on something dashed off'
but by a 'brillaint young man' who neverthless lived in the boonies, seems a
bit of a stretch.

A few days ago in another thread there was an idea to apply quantitative
analysis to word repetitions. It would actually be interesting in the
Oxford/Strat debate to look at word origins, nouns, adjectives and verbs
[particularly sentence placement of the verb] in verse-forms. Especially
since there is a claim for small- and greater- Latin as _quantities_; if the
two could be differentiated that way.

This is a more difficult prospect, however.

&gt;&gt; Maybe we should consider the lawyer, THOMAS GREENE,

&gt;&gt; Dave Kathman posted it here about a year ago.
&gt;&gt; The verse on the tomb is still far below his standard,
&gt;&gt; but maybe he just dashed it off in a hurry.

&gt;&gt; Art N maintains that once the Stratman was dead,
&gt;&gt; Greene's assignment in Stratford was over. He quickly
&gt;&gt; wound up his affairs and got back to London, where he
&gt;&gt; had a successful career. The fact that such a bright
&gt;&gt; young man should have rotted in the boondocks for
&gt;&gt; so long, would support Art's theory.
