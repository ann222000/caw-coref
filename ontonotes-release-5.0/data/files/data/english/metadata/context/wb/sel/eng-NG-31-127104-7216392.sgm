When I inquire at the FDA, I'm sure they will say this is an approved
treatment.

Or will they, Jack?

Typical Con... claim to have information but only if you email.

This seems to be the new way to harvest email addresses for spam mailings,
after all you -gave- them your address so that means you "opted in" and are
willing to accept thier spam...

Anyone with real information would just post it.
