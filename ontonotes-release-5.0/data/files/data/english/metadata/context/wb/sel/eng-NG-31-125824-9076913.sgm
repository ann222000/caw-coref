My point was that you should of written &quot;...what they would do to us
Christians.&quot;

I assume you meant to write &quot;your good self&quot; (or even &quot;your goodself&quot;,
which used to be the more common form).

You'll never find any errors in what I write, of coarse.

Nope, you're quite wrong about that.  &quot;They&quot; is the subject of the verb
&quot;do&quot; and &quot;us Christians&quot; is the object:  hence &quot;us&quot; rather than &quot;we&quot;.
If you're going to insist (and I expect you are), then at least provide
some authority to backup your view.  You could try my old stamping
ground alt.usage.english to garner support if you like -- it's the sort
of thing they relish.

I quite agree. It's definitely 'us Christians'. Forget the Christians,
and it's 'us'. Embellish it a bit, and it's 'us, who are Christians'
(although, I admit, this does sound a bit odd).

It's easier to see that it's wrong if you make it singular: &quot;what they
would do to I ... &quot; is clearly wrong.
