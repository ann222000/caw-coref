I was thinking that it was odd that my local voting location was a
church (and has been so in other places).  Considering that voting is
the highest form of our government, does it not seem odd that voting
for leaders in a church is not a &quot;separation of church and state&quot; but
teaching there can be?  Further, isn't it odd that liberals say the
pastor cannot used the building for political purposes, but the
government can hold elections there?

Nonsense.  Plenty of churches have schools and no one questions that.

Nonsense.  Churches can use their buildings for political purposes.
All they have to do is be willing to pay taxes like any other business or
political advocacy group.

Elections are non-partisan and secret -- no one knows for whom you are
voting and you can vote for anyone you please.

Pastors can use the building for political purposes -- for example, a pastor
could preach a sermon about the believers' civic responsibility and could
urge the congregation to vote and participate in political life -- the
pastor CANNOT endorse a candidate, a party, or a position.  Elections are
neutral actions.

You have demonstrated time an again your inability to understand such simple
concepts as this so I don't expect you to understand this time, either.

I generally support your views Ken, but this time you've lost it.

I think that voting should be done in public buildings, not private ones,
but if we are going to have polling places set up on private property, a
church is fine from the perspective of separation issues.

As for the pastor preaching politics, that seems to be a tax problem for the
church. Church income is not taxed -- and it ought not be -- but because of
this, the church should not be on the campaign trail. Having said that, as a
member of the flock I rather enjoy knowing what the other flock members are
voting for, and our voice being presented in a unified manner is a
reasonable goal of the flock -- and by extension, the pastor.

Churches don't have income Jeff.  The income is money from members that has
already been taxed.  Effectively, you are charging them EXTRA for the rights
that everyone else gets for nothing; freedom of speech, freedom of
association.    In other words, there isn't a single dollar in the church
that hasn't already been subjected to taxes, but yet, the church member
needs to be retaxed in order to exercise his supposed rights?

Well, what would you do if all the churches said, okay.  We'll disband and
meet in residences, or out in the woods, or in abandoned warehouses.  In
Secret.  To avoid having the appearance of a church that needs to pay taxes.
Well, it's obvious we hunt them down with the FBI, right?  No, what will
happen is what has already happened; the churches will just shut up and quit
talking - except for the ones who are politically correct enough to avoid
IRS scrutiny.  The ones favored by the Demopublican power bloc.

Let's see.  So in America today we are actively considering laws that
churches must pay to speak, and that people who go to church should be
punitively taxed twice as punishment for being religious.

And look at from which side of the field this is coming.  The liberal side.
Surprise surprise.  The liberal side, comprised about half way of black
&quot;Christians&quot;, Jews and Metropolitan Community Churches.  Isn't that amazing?
And even more amazing that you hear NOT A PEEP of protest from any churches
except those aligned to the right.  Isn't that a-fucking-mazing.  Wow, I'd
have never guessed it.  Who'd have thought this huge boulder would have been
so painful when I dropped it on my foot.

You deserve to have exactly what your beliefs as expounded here will
ultimately result in.

For the rest of you who believe in freedom, what the church should do if
this ever occurs is refuse en masse to pay the church taxes and DARE THE
GOVERNMENT to arrest every single member of every single church and haul
them off to jail while it's being videotaped and broadcast to the rest of
the world.  Be men, stand up for yourselves.  Then maybe I will see the
value in what I otherwise characterize as you weak, anemic religion.  The
weak anemic religion that all the liberals are so scared of supposedly.

You've cow towed for so long and they still hate you.  Remember, you can
never grovel to your master at any level lower than the sole of his boot.

The church member isn't being retaxed.  If the church engages in

dollars.  The right of free exercise of religion doesn't include the
right to exercise it in a building paid for with pretax dollars.
Indeed, tax exemptions for, and tax deductions for contributions to,
religious bodies are purely a matter of legislative grace and are not

Absolute nonsense.  Churches are subject to the same restrictions on
campaigning for candidates for public office as any other tax-exempt
charitable organization, and there's no reason on earth or under the
Constitution that they should be treated any differently.  Consider:
you can't deduct contributions you make to a candidate's campaign;

Helloooooo Mac Fly.

A church doesn't have income.  And nobody is talking about taxing anything
except what hasn't already be taxed.  I.E. the donation of members.
Otherwise, the churches wouldn't be muzzled.  Most churches proper have no
incomes except donations.  If this were the case, then we wouldn't have seen
those voter guides disappear so rapidly.  So, why does the roof of the
building have to have a steeple on top of it for this to be in effect?

There isn't a church in this country that has been built with so-called

of members from paychecks that aren't subjected to withholding tax.  The

Granted.  There is nothing in the Constitution that says churches should get

That's the nuttiest argument I have heard all day.  If we follow your
argument, EVERYTHING WE DO IS ALREADY TAXED.

I receive a paycheck from which income tax has been withheld -- I've been
taxed.  Then, when I buy a bottle of Wild Turkey, I pay a sales tax plus an
excise tax on the booze -- triple taxation -- once with the withholding,
once with the sales tax, once with the excise tax.

So -- by your reasoning, liquor stores, grocery stores, gas stations,
clothing stores, laundries, etc., etc., etc., DON'T HAVE INCOME -- they just
have money from their customers that's already been taxed.

Son, you haven't a clue.  Not all contributions come from paychecks.
Some come from investment income, especially the big donations.  And
in each case, the deduction for the contribution (assuming the donoe

Actually, the question is at legal issue.  A Florida court recently
said that it was OK in that state because it has a secular purpose,
but I suspect it will be appealed to higher courts.

A Texas court has said that if a church allows its buildings to be
used as a polling place, it has no say as to what sort of
electioneering goes on around that polling place (subject to the same
rules as any other polling place).  Thus someone could not be stopped
from parking in the church parking lot displaying a large sign in
favor of a gay marriage ballot issue.

Wrong.  A liquor store is not a coaltion of members who donate money to the

selling a product to someone who is a customer.  I can guarantee you that
the store and the gas station owner is getting income, because he is

The pastor can offer the church as a polling location. The government
accepts by paying a fee to the church. Once this is done, on election day,
the pastor no longer has control over the property. I know that some pastors
in my county have attempted to exclude poll greeters from their property,
claiming trespassing. In EVERY case, the board of elections and the police
have ruled that, on election day, the pastor has ZERO say over who may be on
the property.

In short, on election day, if the pastor has accepted a fee, the church is
no longer a church. It is a polling location, and ONLY a polling location.

Under this argument, stores don't have income because the income is from
customers who have already paid taxes on the money they're spending. Good
luck with this line of reasoning.

The problem with churches who want to be able to be politically active,
especially to support candidates for a political party, is that they don't
want to give up their tax exempt status. If you or I contribute to a
political campaign or a PAC or a 501(c)(4) (a political advocacy
organization), that contribution IS NOT TAX EXEMPT under the tax laws.
Contributions to churches which are set up under 501(c)(3) of the tax code
ARE TAX EXEMPT. Allowing a 501(c)(3) church to participate in a campaign for
a political party would be a way around the tax code which PROHIBITS tax
exemption for political contributions. PERIOD. It has NOTHING to do with
suppression of the church's free speech. If the church is willing to
surrender its tax exempt status, it can politicize itself until the cows
come home.

Son, you were the one that brought up the fact that you didn't get to
vote on the 501(c)(3) restrictions, I didn't.  Frankly, I thought it
was a silly issue to raise, but it apparently meant something to you,
so my illustration was simply to show just how silly it was.

The issue is not political speech in general in churches.  If a
clergyman wants to preach about political issues, that's OK.  The only
time merely discussing political issues would be problematic is if a
&quot;substantial portion&quot; of the church's activities consisted of
attempting to influence legislation.  But what the statute says he
can't do is participate or intervene in any political campaign on
behalf of or in opposition to a candidate for public office.  So if he
gets up in the pulpit and admonishes his congregation to vote for
candidate A, the church has failed to comply with Section 501(c)(3).
Or if he doesn't say anything about candidate A, but instead tells his
flock that because candidate B believes a certain way on a particular
issue, anyone who votes for B is going straight to hell, he's got the
same problem.

The relationship of parishoners to a church is not the same as a customer to
a store.   A store owner generates income from his store.  A church
generates no income.  It receives donations.  My point is that churches
can't lose their 501c3 for what the preacher says in the pulpit.  That was
the original argument I picked up on.  But, if churches do end up losing
that protection, I think people would need to stand up against being taxed
to death, and punished with taxation as a price for purchasing liberty.  Amd
this idea that preachers and church members have to give up free speech
unless they pay double taxes is ludicrous.  I don't give a damn what LBJ
said in 1954 when he got his little bill passed with no assent or dissent

By that measure, I have no income either. I repair homes for the homeowner.
The money you pay me has already been taxed, and since you are a wage
earner, it was likely taxed as corporate income as well, but that's not
really the point here.

As income, all of my money comes from your pocket and the pockets of your
neighbors, therefore it has already been taxed. Now that it is my money,
they are taxing it again. All I'm illustrating is that your argument is not
entirely accurate. Church income is the tithes that it collects, and those
tithes are deducted from the parishoner's income and therefore avoids
taxation at all.

In any case, I am not making an argument in favor of taxing a church. My
only point is that churches enjoy a tax status that you and I do not enjoy,
nor do our employers enjoy, and as a result the church is not allowed to
engage in political activity without risk of losing the tax status it
enjoys.

&gt; another form of &quot;loophole&quot; to evade election spending laws.

&gt;&gt;How come Jesse Jackson still doesn't know about them?

&gt; I am sure that he does, and if he has violated them, then no doubt the

I seldom find myself on the same side with Bob, but this time I do. My only
point of contention is the part about a church being a 501(c)(3). Having
said that, I don't think the actual tax code that a church operates under
changes any of what he said.

Bob says he has looked into this for whatever his reason was, and I've never
looked into it. I thought that churches were not 501(c)s, but I don't know
what they would be otherwise.

But Bob is right about all of the rest, and he is probably right on the very
fine point of 501(c) as well.

&gt; It is not a problem for a pastor to preach politics.  Nor should a church

It absolutely is a problem, ask your pastor.

Okay, let me refine that a bit. The pastor can not stand up and say,
&quot;Alright everybody, Tuesday is election day and I want you all to vote for

country, vote accordingly.&quot; It is permissible for him to suggest a

&gt;&gt; Churches don't have income Jeff.  The income is money from members that
&gt;&gt; has already been taxed.  Effectively, you are charging them EXTRA for the
&gt;&gt; rights that everyone else gets for nothing; freedom of speech, freedom of
&gt;&gt; association.    In other words, there isn't a single dollar in the church
&gt;&gt; that hasn't already been subjected to taxes, but yet, the church member
&gt;&gt; needs to be retaxed in order to exercise his supposed rights?
&gt; By that measure, I have no income either. I repair homes for the
&gt; homeowner. The money you pay me has already been taxed, and since you are
&gt; a wage earner, it was likely taxed as corporate income as well, but that's
&gt; not really the point here.
">

Well, I've answered this question further up the post in another fashion.
But, the income to you from the homeowner is your income paid for services
rendered.  It is your income, and you do with it as you please.  It is your
INCREASE and so you must pay taxes on it.  The church makes no income of its
own because it doesn't GENERATE income.  You GENERATE income and receive it.
THAT is what should be taxed.   A church, on the other hand, is an
organization of people who support it through their contributions, money
which has already been taxed.  Taxing the church is tamtamount to retaxing
the members in exchange for allowing the activities of a conglomerate
entity, which they may or may not be in control of.  I mean, think about
this.  Not all the members in the church vote the same way.  Why SHOULD THEY
BE PENALIZED UNIVERSALLY FOR SPEECH THEY MAY NOT EVEN AGREE WITH?  I mean,
are we trying to drive people to associate in churches according to their
political beliefs?

But ultimately, who exactly do we think will pay those taxes?  The church
entity?  With what?  Money from a money tree?  No.  The members will pay it,
over and above the costs they pay to support the church.  The point I was
trying to make is this.  The government doesn't need to have any more money.
I'm tired of the government making up whatever laws it wants to.  I mean,
this is the same junk they always pull.  They &quot;allowed&quot; the indians to have
a little bit of land &quot;back&quot; that they stole from them in the first place and
then tax them to live on it.  The slave is only x/tenth of a person.  They
steal inheritances from the heirs of the dead and leave them a broken
dissolute estate.  And meanwhile, they give the money away and vote
themselves huge payraises, and build a massive entrenched bureaucracy where
ONE THIRD of the country is earning a living on the economy generated by the
other two thirds.  One divine fiat after another.  I'm tired of not having a
vote on anything in my &quot;democratic&quot; society.  I'm tired of these rich
elitists who've set up a monarchy for the rich, USING MY MONEY.  So, I am
not enamored of any attempt by them to NOW charge &quot;extra money&quot; for civil
rights, whenever they feel like it.  They don't have the right to do this,
and I don't care what anybody says otherwise.  Nor do I like the idea of the
government STEALING MONEY FROM WHAT SHOULD BE GOING TO HELP CHARITABLE
PURPOSES.  The government gets enough money.  Let them cut back on $500
toilet seats and office furniture and fancy junkets.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As income, all of my money comes from your pocket and the pockets of your
&gt; neighbors, therefore it has already been taxed. Now that it is my money,
&gt; they are taxing it again.
">

They are taxing incomes.  A church has no income.  I don't care what the
government says.  The money has been taxed already, and they are RETAXING
the same money and retaxing the SAME PEOPLE, because the CHURCH belongs to
the people who paid the taxes on the donations.  It hasn't been given to the
church in exchange for services.  It hasn't been &quot;Earned&quot; by the church.
And the church doesn't get to do with the money whatever it wants to.  And
without the members, there would be NO CHURCH at all.  And who cares what a
bunch of no-nothing over-educated fruitcake lawyers think?  If they're so
smart, than why is the country so messed up anyway?  These people don't
operate on right and wrong.  They operate on WHAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IN
COURT.  Na.  I say enough is enough.

And I understand that we all get a standard deduction.  But we pay ENOUGH in
taxes even with it.  And Jeff,  WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE FACT THAT WE WILL GET
NOTHING BACK FROM SOCIAL SECURITY - A BREACH OF TRUST THAT PUT THE ENRON
EXECUTIVES IN JAIL - it evens out in my mind.    We MUST NOT allow these
people to continue doing these things.

It is even more galling when you consider that this whole ruckus is most
likely no more that a cheap stunt in election year politics, where one side
tries to blunt the efforts of another.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In any case, I am not making an argument in favor of taxing a church. My
&gt; only point is that churches enjoy a tax status that you and I do not
&gt; enjoy, nor do our employers enjoy, and as a result the church is not
&gt; allowed to engage in political activity without risk of losing the tax
&gt; status it
&gt; enjoys.
">

Now, here's the issue.  The church IS you.  The church IS the members.
Otherwise, why shouldn't the government come out and say that private
citizens have to forgo their standard deduction in order to have the
priviledge of political speech?

There is no law against what a preacher says in his pulpit.  Nor can a
church lose its 501c3 for what is preached in the pulpit, nor for activities
that do not violate the unjust and unagreed upon laws set by LBJ in 1954 for
his own personal convenience.  But that's the problem.  We've got this
monster now that legal activists are CONSTANTLY working to expand and
stretch to muzzle free speech.  Politics is a dirty business.

Check out these two websites, in this order:  freepreach.org and
becketfund.org.  Read the open letter to all churches on the homepage of
freepreach.org.  If you have problems finding it, let me know.  The offer
speaks for itself, as does case law.  The Supreme Court has upheld the right
of pastors and chaplains to say WHAT THEY WANT in the pulpits regarding
whatever.  But, that doesn't mean it won't change, because in this country,
the justice system is wicked and corrupt.  Justice is for sale, and the
decision always goes to the squeekiest wheel or the one with the most money,
or the one with the most poltically agreeable point of view to the judge.
Undoubtedly, given the apathy and lack of concern from the so-called
&quot;conservatives&quot;, free speech in the pulpit will not be protected forever.
As it isn't in Europe and Canada anymore.

Well, it is a 501c3 and if it isn't than Bob isn't right about anything of
&quot;the rest&quot;.  But, I've supplied you with those two websites to look at and I
hope you get the chance.

The bottom line is, we need to hold the line against further taxation of
anybody, whether we agree with them or not, expecially in this regard.  And
especially in light of the fact that laws are being made illegally and
unConstitutionally.  When you consider the FACT that legislators often times
DON&quot;T EVEN READ THE BILLS before they vote on them, than it is imperative
that they not be allowed to legislate such matters without public scrutiny.

We've allowed Congress too much unrestrained power to vote on things they
NEVER discuss with the public, and the next thing we know, we're getting
blindsided.  And, they are sowing confusion about the law, expecially
exemplified by this one.

We need a constitutional amendment to sharply define what can be voted on by
legislators and what needs to be voted on, OR AT LEAST PRESENTED, to the
public for their scrutiny before votes.  This is ridiculous, and I feel like
I'm living in some third rate banana republic.  If these guys are not even
responsible enough to avoid having sex in public airport restrooms, than
they can't be trusted with the country's business.

They need to be held to the standard of the office they seek.  We should be
ashamed of our collective selves for allowing these schmucks to run
roughshod over our futures.  They do not respect us, and it shows.

2007. Instead of taking the IRS' threats at face value, All Saints fought

its investigation. The IRS backed down, never attempting to enforce the
subpoena, and leaving All Saints' tax-exempt status unscathed.   &quot;This
retreat shows what an empty threat IRS sermon investigations are,&quot; said
Kevin &quot;Seamus&quot; Hasson, President of The Becket Fund. &quot;When it comes to
preaching from the pulpit, the IRS speaks loudly, but actually carries a
pretty small stick.&quot;  In the over 50 years the statute has been in
existence, the IRS has prosecuted only one case involving church
&quot;intervention&quot; in a political campaign. That 1992 case involved a full-page
advertisement in national newspapers, rather than core religious speech-like
sermons-that are protected under the First Amendment. &quot;Ministers preaching
truth to power helped start the American Revolution, stop slavery, and end
racial segregation,&quot; said Hasson. &quot;We applaud All Saints for continuing this

The truth is a lot of pastors are completely ignorant of their rights in
this regard, as are their churches.  They receive no guidance and no help,
and when a pastor gets called by the IRS, imagine how he sees his whole life
flash in front of his eyes, if he screws up his parishoneers tax exempt
status.  His career is down the toilet?  Not to mention the legal problems.
So they buckle out of cowardice and or ignorance.  And all along, they could
fight it and win.  Or, they simply don't want to bother with it, so they
shut up.  And the IRS gets to be the fourth branch of government:  The
Extortionist Branch, which gets to threaten your pocket book if you get out
of line.

In my mind, if I were the President of the United States, I would FIRE the
director of the IRS on national television if this happened on my watch.
You can bet your bottom dollar on it.  And I'd make him stand there for
another 30 minutes while the Attorney General and I delivered a
comprehensive presentation about what 501c3 organzations can and can't do.

Damn government.

You can teach anything you want in a church, political or otherwise.

However, if the church is a non-profit or similar tax-exempt entity, it
needs to act like one which precludes most specific political discourse.

There are no &quot;double taxes&quot; involved.   Without 501(c)(3) status, the

payments.  The church members are no more being taxed for those

The record is replete with cases where a church (pastor, priest, rabbi,

The point I was making to Ken is that a pastor can not campaign from the
pulpit, but it is permissible to hold elections on church grounds.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's start over.  Here's the original post that started me off:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As for the pastor preaching politics, that seems to be a tax problem for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;church. Church income is not taxed -- and it ought not be -- but because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this, the church should not be on the campaign trail. Having said that,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;member of the flock I rather enjoy knowing what the other flock members
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;voting for, and our voice being presented in a unified manner is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reasonable goal of the flock -- and by extension, the pastor.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not a problem for a pastor to preach politics.  Nor should a
&gt;&gt;&gt; church lose tax exempt status for this. The Christian Coalition is not a
&gt;&gt;&gt; church either.  Nor should they have lost their 501c3 over this voter
&gt;&gt;&gt; guide issue.

&gt;&gt; It absolutely is a problem, ask your pastor.

&gt;&gt; Okay, let me refine that a bit. The pastor can not stand up and say,
&gt;&gt; &quot;Alright everybody, Tuesday is election day and I want you all to vote
&gt;&gt; for ...&quot; He CAN stand up and say, &quot;alright everybody, we stand for God,
&gt;&gt; family, country, vote accordingly.&quot; It is permissible for him to suggest
&gt;&gt; a conservative agenda, or a liberal one if that is his bent, but any
&gt;&gt; politicking that comes from the pulpit is strictly frowned upon by the
&gt;&gt; tax code. What is permissible is in a very narrow range. Very narrow.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Otherwise, show me the case where the IRS won a case against a preacher
&gt;&gt;&gt; for preaching.  Not that the enemies of freedom haven't tried.  But they
&gt;&gt;&gt; haven't won yet.

&gt;&gt; We aren't talking about preaching, we're talking about politicking.
&gt;&gt; There's a difference. Sorry, I said, &quot;preaching poilitics.&quot; You dialed in
&gt;&gt; on the wrong word.

That makes no sense at all.

As a church, the members can easily meet for coffee and doughnuts and
discuss political stuff, then head out to the polls and all vote in unison.
What can not happen is that the pastor (priest, rabbi, &lt;whatever&gt;) is not
allowed to tell the congregation whom to vote for. The church has a very
fine line to walk when it sends out a list of issues and candidates it
supports. That's a fact.

&gt; imam, &lt;pick one&gt;) has crossed the line where the tax status is threatened.

&gt; The point I was making to Ken is that a pastor can not campaign from the
&gt; pulpit, but it is permissible to hold elections on church grounds.
">

The record is replete with one case in 1992 where a church took out a full
page ad in a newspaper.  But I can assure you that there is not a single
case where the IRS revoked a 501c3 because of what the paster preached in
the pulpit to the church.  Not one.  And, just because the IRS doesn't know
the law, is their problem.  They don't know the law, and it's a common
occurence for government entities to step on the rights of citizens
erroneously.

It is absolutely legal for a pastor to preach whatever he wants.  No
questoin about it.  I mean, there was a case just the other day in Oakland
CA that the IRS gave up on because they were wrong.

The pastor can say whatever he wants to his church from the pulpit.  I would
encourage you to visit freepreach.org for starters.  There is no case law

Here's a snippet from freepreach.org that should settle the issue as it

it's valuable.  I hope you read it carefully.  You will see that not one

Pastors, Churches and Politics  What May Pastors and Churches Do?
by Mathew D. Staver, Esq.
Copyright © 2004

It is important to understand the critical difference between an IRS
tax-exempt letter ruling and tax-exempt status of churches. Every
organization, whether a 501(c)(4) (a nonprofit group that primarily lobbies)
or a 501(c)(3) (a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization), must file an
application with the IRS to be recognized as a nonprofit organization for
purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. The IRS then issues a letter ruling
specific for the organization, in which the IRS acknowledges that the
organization will be recognized as a nonprofit organization, and in the case
of a 501(c)(3), that contributions to the organization will be
tax-deductible.
Unlike virtually every other nonprofit or tax-exempt organization, churches
are not required to obtain an IRS letter ruling. Some churches have an IRS
letter and some do not. What is the advantage of a church having a letter
ruling as opposed to a church that does not have one? There is no
substantive difference. The only difference is one of convenience. If a
donor is ever audited and the IRS questioned the contributions to the
church, the donor can point the agent to the letter ruling on file with the
IRS. However, if a church doesn't have a letter ruling, the church can
merely produce an affidavit by the pastor, or present the church bylaws or
other evidence to validate that the assembly is a church. Other than mere
convenience, there is no substantive difference, as a church with or without
a tax-exempt letter ruling is still tax-exempt.
So long as a church is operating and functioning as an organized church
body, it is automatically tax-exempt and does not have to apply to the IRS
for this determination. This distinction between churches and other
tax-exempt organizations is critically important in understanding the impact
of the IRS's action against the Church at Pierce Creek.
The Church at Pierce Creek had applied for and received an IRS tax-exempt
letter ruling, and the lawsuit was not designed to regain its tax-exempt
status (which the Church continued to enjoy), but to receive back its
tax-exempt letter ruling. The court noted that &quot;because of the unique
treatment churches receive under the Internal Revenue Code, the impact of
the revocation is likely to be more symbolic than substantial.&quot;
During the oral argument, counsel for the IRS confirmed that if the Church
chose not to intervene in future political campaigns, it may continue to
hold itself out as a tax-exempt organization and receive all the benefits of
that status. The court also pointed out that revocation of the IRS letter
ruling did not make the Church liable for the payment of taxes. The IRS also
conceded during the oral argument that &quot;the revocation of the exemption
[letter] does not convert bona fide donations into income taxable to the
church.&quot; Contributions given to the Church, even contributions regarding the
ad, were never taxed. In the future, if the Church wanted to reapply for its
letter, it was free to do so. However, even without the letter, it retained,
and continues to retain to this day, its tax-exempt status.
Other than the Church at Pierce Creek, no other church has even lost its
tax-exempt letter ruling, let alone its tax-exempt status. In other words,
from 1954 to the present, no church has ever lost its tax-exempt status for
endorsing or opposing political candidates. This history alone should
alleviate unfounded fear.
Outside of express endorsement of or opposition to candidates for political
offices, pastors and churches may engage in many other permissible
activities. Churches may host voter registration drives, be a host site for
balloting, or host a forum where candidates address the congregation or
answer questions from a moderator. Candidates visiting the church may be
introduced, and political candidates may even preach in the pulpit so long
as the pulpit is not used as a political forum to urge the members to vote
in favor of the candidate. Churches may also distribute objective voter
guides that address the candidates' views on a broad range of issues.
Pastors can preach on biblical, moral and social issues such as
homosexuality and abortion. Pastors can urge the congregation to become
involved in the political process, urge them to register and vote. Pastors
can acknowledge visiting candidates. Pastors can personally endorse or
oppose political candidates, personally work for political candidates, and
personally contribute to them. Also, a pastor's name may appear in a
published ad or letter signifying the pastor's endorsement of the candidate,
and the pastor's title and affiliation with the church can also be listed
with the notation, &quot;Title and affiliation for identification purposes.&quot;
Although the IRS states that a pastor may not personally endorse a candidate
while in the pulpit, I believe such a restriction is unconstitutional. No
pastor has ever been targeted by the IRS for giving a personal endorsement
from the pulpit. My recommendation is that if the pastor wants to personally
endorse a candidate, he should feel free to do so, as long as the
endorsement is stated as a personal rather than a corporate church
endorsement.
It should also be remembered that the restriction on endorsing candidates
does not apply to appointed offices. Cabinet or judicial appointments are
not political candidates for public office. Therefore, pastors and churches
may expressly oppose or support individuals for appointed office.

But, you are the one who is wrong.  Dead wrong.  And so is everyone else in
this thread, except me, about the issue of what you can and can't talk about
in a church that affect 501c3.  And, I'm not gloating about that.  I'm sad.
Because it illustrates handily the point I'm making about how the government
is so out of control. And how citizens are kept in the dark and ignorant
about the rights by the very government that should be HELPING them
understand.  Not preventing them.     And the facts of the 1992 case... the
FACTS NOT THE RUMORS OR WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW... should blow you away. And
that's a good thing.  I'm not looking to win an argument.  I'm looking to
help pass along information.

Here's the main points YOU GUYS DON&quot;T UNDERSTAND.  And, after I've listed
one, I'm going to give you a good snippet to read from a lawyer.  Read it.
It's long.  But it's of interest.  And not a bit of it lines up with
anything you guys are saying.

1.  The IRS is not the court.
2.  The IRS may not understand the law any better than you do.
3.  The IRS can intimidate you and get away with it with impunity.  All you
can do is do what the church in Oakland did last week.  Stand your ground
and back down.
4.  The LAW in this country doesn't have anything to do with the TRUTH of
the LAW.  The LAW in this country is more decided by who has the most time,
the most money, the most backbone, and the most capable lawyer.
5.  The IRS can also be used as A WEAPON by an adminstration that has a
hostile agenda to intimidate and scare.  You guys love to talk about
coverups and conspiracies.  Well, that's a REAL LIVE ONE FOR YOU.

Now, here's the snippet.

Pastors, Churches and Politics  What May Pastors and Churches Do?
by Mathew D. Staver, Esq.
Copyright © 2004

From the founding of the country until 1954, churches and other nonprofit
organizations were permitted to expressly endorse or oppose candidates for
political office. That changed when Lyndon Baines Johnson ran for United
States Senate. He was opposed by a nonprofit organization (not a church),
and after he won the election, he proposed legislation to amend the Internal
Revenue Code to prohibit nonprofit organizations, including churches, from
endorsing or opposing political candidates. The Code was amended in 1954
without any debate regarding the impact of the bill.

The Internal Revenue Code now expressly prohibits churches and other
nonprofit organizations from directly endorsing or opposing political
candidates. From 1954 to the present, only one church has ever lost its IRS
tax-exempt letter ruling, but even that church did not lose its tax-exempt
status for opposing then-Governor Bill Clinton for President in 1992.
The Church at Pierce Creek, located in Binghamton, New York (a church where
Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry attended at the time), took out
full-page ads in the USA Today and The Washington Times newspapers. The ads
opposed Governor Clinton for President because of his position on abortion
and homosexuality, and then the ads solicited &quot;tax-deductible donations&quot; to
defray the cost of the advertisements. The Church received hundreds of
contributions.

After Clinton was elected President, the IRS notified the Church on November
20, 1992, that it intended to conduct an inquiry into the Church's
activities. After negotiations with the Church broke down, the IRS revoked
the Church's tax-exempt letter ruling and the Church filed suit to get it
back.

It is important to understand the critical difference between an IRS
tax-exempt letter ruling and tax-exempt status of churches. Every
organization, whether a 501(c)(4) (a nonprofit group that primarily lobbies)
or a 501(c)(3) (a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization), must file an
application with the IRS to be recognized as a nonprofit organization for
purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. The IRS then issues a letter ruling
specific for the organization, in which the IRS acknowledges that the
organization will be recognized as a nonprofit organization, and in the case
of a 501(c)(3), that contributions to the organization will be
tax-deductible.

Unlike virtually every other nonprofit or tax-exempt organization, churches
are not required to obtain an IRS letter ruling. Some churches have an IRS
letter and some do not. What is the advantage of a church having a letter

Youi are still protecting the church form an attack that I am not leading.

It turns out that your citation says precisely what I've been saying -- a
pastor is not permitted to endorse or oppose a candidate from the pulpit. A
pastor is also not supposed to directly endorse or oppose a particular
issue.

A pastor is free to talk about issues, but must stop shor of giving an
endorsement. I do not see very much difference in the cite you gave and the
generalization I made.

Whether or not the IRS has actively pursued a pastor or not is not really
the point, because if the pastors know what they are not permitted to do or
say from the pulpit vis a vis political campaigning, and they don't do or
say it, then there will be nothing to pursue.

No, it doesn't.  That's why I posted it for you.

Reread the last paragraph.

Although the IRS states that a pastor may not personally endorse a candidate

from the pulpit. My recommendation is that if the pastor wants to personally

See, just because the IRS SAYS it, doesn't make it law.   And again, in the
1992 case, the church did NOT lose it's tax exempt status.  I mean, did you
read the thing I posted.  See, the IRS can run around saying the moon is
made of green cheese if they want to.  But the IRS isn't the law.  The
courts have the final say.  I mean, you have NO case law to cite.  No pastor
has ever been tried on this.  And Democrat-friendly churhces especially have
candidates and politicians speaking in them all the time about politics.  I
mean, all the time.  They understand the law.  Conservatives don't.  And the
IRS makes no effort to disabuse them of the false notion.

Now, you just read for yourself in that citation that, even in the 1992
case, the one single case... even THAT church is STILL not paying taxes.  I
mean.  How much more clear can it be?  I'm not making this up.

&gt;&gt; I think it's odd that you would spin this out as a liberal
&gt;&gt; issue, since it is the Pasadena Church that was investigated by
&gt;&gt; I.R.S, not any Evangelical Congregations whose pastors handed
&gt;&gt; out acceptable candidate lists pimping war mongering
&gt;&gt; Republicans.

&gt;&gt; How dare a Christian Church deliver a message of peace?
&gt;&gt; What kind of BusHaters are they anyway?

&gt; Well, that's because it usually happens at the instigation of
&gt; liberals against conservatives.  But, this one was probably
&gt; instigated in the opposite direction.
">

This has been spun out in political warfare
instigated by right-sided dialecticians who have attempted
to portray their personal version (per.version)
as the One True Path of Christianity; who have deceitfully
distorted The Nation's historical beginnings, because they will to
bring an American Theocratic government into being, that in its
very nature would be both Unamerican and Unchristianly.

The very last thing in the world Evangelical denominations desire
is a return to the religious view of Revolutionary America in
which the majority of practising Christians viewed Anabaptists as
heretics.  The same is true for Catholics, as that faith was often
scorned by Calvinists, Lutherans and the Anglican Puritans, and
was considered to be unworthy of religious liberty because of
their subversive faith that the Papacy predominated over civil
rule on Earth.

Both of these groups have also preached a justification for waging
war that cannot be found in the New testament, and istead requires
artful out of context quoting tied to mooted Old Testament
citations in order to get around the clear and literal command:
Thous Shall Not Kill.  This is a concept that is transparently
taught throughout the Gospels and the writings of Paul.  It wasn't
called The Axe of The Apostles for a very good reason.

Thin I am wrong?
King James at twenty paces;
name the date, place and time.
I, both apostate and non-laity,
who exists beyond salvations's reach,
will happily bury you, with your own faith's words,
in my wratful indignation over this
preponderate perversion of a philosophy of peace,
that is a primary cause for bringing the whole world
to the very brink into a clash of civilisations.

Worse than these Evangelical Antinomianists
and dumb-founded believers in the Papal Bull,
is the dark evil that lurks in the form of perverted Calvinism:
believers in the inevitability of a Earthly Dominion;
believers of their righteous place in the future,
by the will of their own per.version of god,
as authoritarian boot-stomping Bible thumpers,
who possess a divine right
to violently coerce behaviours they find offensive.

The right does not own Christian Faith.
All they possess is an obscene perversion of a vision for peace,
as they suffer from profound sexual neurosis,
which to them must remain unspeakable;
that was born from an abject fear of their own buried desires.
This does prove that they do have a rightful place in the GOP,
as deeply closeted homophobic members of
The Party of Potty Peepers.
