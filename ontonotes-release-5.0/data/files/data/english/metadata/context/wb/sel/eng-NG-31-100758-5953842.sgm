I'm developing this recipe, I haven't actually cooked it yet. I've been
looking at the tilapia in the freezer case for years, and sometimes I
see them at the 99 Cents Only Store for less than a buck apiece. Such a
deal...

I'm wondering what other typically Mexican veggies would be appropriate
for steaming for 7 to 8 minutes, and what else I could add to give the
recipe a more Yucatecan attitude.

Tilapia En Papillote with Plaintains and Shrimp

(En papillote is a French cooking term for steaming food in a paper
bag. Al cartoccio is the Italian term.)

Serves 4

4 Tilapia filets
4 ripe plantains (or other veggies)
4 tbs butter, softened
Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
4 tbs lemon juice mixed with orange juice to resemble the taste
of a Yucatecan lime
4 oz tiny cooked shrimp rinsed and drained
4 Serrano chiles, or other hotter chiles, to taste
48 inches of baking parchment to form the papillotes, or substitute
aluminum foil

Peel the plaintains and slice in half, lengthwise

Beat 2 tbs butter until light and blend in 2 tbs lemon/orange juice;
season to taste with salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

For each portion, fold a 12-inch square of baking parchment
in half diagonally and crease the corners, or fold in half the ordinary
way
and cut into a large valentine shape

You can lightly butter the side of the papilotte that filet rests upon,
to
avoid the parchment sticking to the baking pan.

Arrange one portion of tilapia filet on one half of the paper.

Season with a little lemon/orange juice and top with a quarter of the
shrimp,
plaintains and chiles.

Dot with a quarter of the lemon butter.

Fold the other side of the paper over the fish and seal the package
into a half oval with a series of creases, starting with one corner
and finishing with a twist at the opposite end. If making a valentine
shape,
fold the pointed end under.

Repeat for the remaining portions.

Bake the packages on a sheet pan until the paper is browned and puffy,
7 to 8 minutes.

To serve, slit open each package and slide the contents, out onto a
plate;
or serve in the paper, letting each diner cut open his own.

Serve with black beans and Mexican rice.
