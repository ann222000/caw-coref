Western World - January 20, 1841

A proclamation has been recently issued by the Presidents of the
Church of Latter day Saints (Mormons) calling upon all who are
converts to the new faith to take up their residence as soon as
practicable at or in the vicinity of Nauvoo. This City having recently
received a charter of the most liberal character, the Mormons have
determined to make it the gathering place of the Saints throughout the
earth

Whatever may be thought of the tenets of this sect, it is certainly an
imposing spectacle to witness the moral power which in so short a
period they have exerted. -- Already, in obedience to this call, have
hundreds left their homes in Europe, and thousands are now preparing
to leave and take up their residence in a far distant land. And in our
own country, from the east, and from the north, and from the south,
converts are continually flocking to this new city. What may be the
ultimate result it is impossible to divine. But a few years ago the
Mormons were regarded as a set of fanatics, deserving only the pity or
contempt of mankind; but now that their numbers are concentrating they
begin to assume, at least in this state, a political and moral
importance possessed by no other denomination.

Believing it to be a subject of interest to our readers we subjoin the
following extract from the Proclamation:

Having been instrumental, in the hands of our heavenly Father, in
laying a foundation for the gathering of Zion, we would say, let all
those who appreciate the blessings of the gospel, and realize the
importance of obeying the commandments of heaven, who have been
blessed of heaven with the possession of this world's goods, first
prepare for the general gathering; let them dispose of their effects
as fast as circumstances will possibly admit, without making too great
sacrifices, and remove to our city and county -- establish and build
up manufactories in the city, purchase and cultivate farms in the
county -- this will secure our permanent inheritance, and prepare the
way for the gathering of the poor. This is agreeable to the order of
heaven, and the only principle on which the gathering can be effected
-- let the rich, then, and all who can assist in establishing this
place, make every preparation to come on without delay, and strengthen
our hands, and assist in promoting the happiness of the Saints. This
cannot be too forcibly impressed on the minds of all, and the elders
are hereby instructed to proclaim this word in all places, where the
saints reside in their public administrations, for this is according
to the instruction we have received from the Lord.

The Temple of the Lord is in process of erection here where the Saints
will come to worship the God of their fathers, according to the order
of his house and the power of the holy priesthood, and will be so
constructed as to enable all the functions of the priesthood to be
duly exercised, and where instructions from the Most High will be
received, and from this place go forth to distant lands.

Let us then concentrate all our powers, under the provisions of our
magna charta granted by the Illinois Legislature, at the &quot;City of
Nauvoo&quot; and surrounding country, and strive to emulate the action of
the ancient covenant fathers, and patriarchs, in those things which
are of such vast importance to this and every succeeding generation.

The &quot;Nauvoo Legion,&quot; embraces all our military power, and will enable
us to perform our military duty by ourselves and thus afford the
power, and privilege of avoiding one of the most fruitful sources of
strife, oppression, and collision with the world. It will enable us to
show our attachment to the state and nation as a people, whenever the
public service requires our aid -- thus proving ourselves obedient to
the paramount laws of the land, and ready at all times to sustain and
execute them.

The &quot;University of the City of Nauvoo,&quot; will enable us to teach our
children wisdom -- to instruct them in all knowledge, and learning, in
the Arts, Sciences and Learned Professions. We hope to make this
institution one of the great lights of the world, and by and through
it, to diffuse that kind of knowledge which will be of practical
utility, and for the public good, and also for private and individual
happiness. The Regents of the University will take the general
supervision of all matters appertaining to education from common
schools up to the highest branches of a most liberal collegiate
course. They will establish a regular system of education, and hand
over the pupil from teacher to professor, until the regular graduation
is consummated, and the education finished. This corporation contains
all the powers and prerogatives of any other college or university in
this state. The charters for the University and Legion are addenda to
the city charter, making the whole perfect and complete.
