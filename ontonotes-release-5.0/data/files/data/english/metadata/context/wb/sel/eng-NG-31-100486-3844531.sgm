Has anyone come across a noise that sounds like you're riding on a bumpy
road? When I'm driving, that's the sound it makes, unless I turn the wheel
to the right, then the noise goes away, until I'm straight again. A friend
suggested wheel bearings. Is this an accurate suggestion? Thanks.

Could be bearings, could be CV joint.

My 2000 Malibu was doing this a while back and I was convinced it was a
bearing problem. I eventually gave in and took it the shop where a
sharp-eyed mechanic informed me that it was a badly worn brake pad. I
wouldn't believe him because it made the noise when I turned, nothing to
with braking. Long story short, he was absolutely right. The calliper had
hung up and the left inner pad had worn to the backing plate. I changed the
pads out (a job I can do now with the speed and precision of a NASCAR pit
crew thanks to all the practise I get.... thanks GM) and it all went away.

Good luck and keep us posted.

well, this noise goes away when I turn to the right, and comes back when I'm
going straight again. It's also there if I go left. But I will post when I
get it resolved. thanks for the input.

Yup, same thing I had (same directions, too). Check those brake pads.

Find a quiet parking lot, get the car up to speed while making a slight left
turn (until the noise starts) and see if you can stop (or change) the noise
by gently applying the brake. If it stops, the pads are definitely the
problem. If it doesn't, it's still worth inspecting the pads.

I had noise which sounded like bad wheel bearings on my 2000 Malibu.
Took it to my good friend, who is also a fully licensed mechanic, and he
said the noise was from bad tires.  He put some new (high quality) tires on,
and presto, no more noise!  This also happened on the 1988 Celebrity.
Hope that this helps; it's less costly than wheel bearing work.
Speaking of wheel bearings, I have been driving Chevys for decades, and the
last wheel bearing was on a 1960 model.  We drive our cars well past 250,000
km, which is more than 150,000 miles.

I have also changed the front hubs on my 98 malibu 2x...fixed the problem,
plus fixed the intermittent ABS problem.  Got the hubs from Murrays'
Discount with lifetime warranty so 2nd time the parts were free!

I thought for the longest time that the noise was coming from the
tires...almost changed them but got another opinion.
