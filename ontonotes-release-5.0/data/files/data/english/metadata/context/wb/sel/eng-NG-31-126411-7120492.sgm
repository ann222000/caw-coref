Hi all,

Been a while since I've used a TV Out card. The last card I had was a
Geforce2 MX or something similar.  From what I remember the quality
was average at best and for some odd reason the picture used to appear
with black borders all around it. This could be fixed using an
application called TV tool but at the expense of losing some of the
picture.

What are the new cards on the market like these days? Has the TV out
quality impvroved?

The reason I ask this is I am building a dedicated "movies" platform
and I want the tv out quality to be as good as possible.

Thanks

you want overscan feature (thats where you 'lose' a bit of the picture, but
covers all the screen)
not sure where the control is on nvidia drivers currently, i'm sure it's
there though
the ati i was using until recently had this feature (i got new video card)

The newer encoder chips are quite excellent these days.  I've tried a
few cards with the Conexant C23xx chipsets and it's the best you're
going to get on composite output.  My current 7600GT with "NVIDIA
Integrated" (probably a Phillips SA713x or similar Conexant) does just
as well.  Also last I checked, the TV-out adjustments did include an
overscan and position adjustment, but it's only available on most GF4
and above cards -- and then it depends on your encoder chip.

Make sure whatever card you get also has a dongle for HDTV output via
Component (red, green, and blue cable ends, labeled YPbPr/YCbCr or such
on your TV);  or if your TV supports DVI like many LCD TV's, then you're
all set.  Since you're building a HTPC, there's no reason to skimp on
the connection and I'm positive you'll be much more pleased with a
progressive 480p or 720p signal than a blurry composite output or
S-video.  Here's a quick example:
