Stats Can numbers short by half
Statistics Canada reported last week on the size of the Fibromyalgia
and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patient populations, stating 393,000
Canadians have Fibromyalgia and 343,000 have CFS. The Fibromyalgia
number is short by half at least. Studies with stronger methodologies
suggest more than one million Canadians have FM. And this drives policy
making.

The Stats Can numbers recorded how many doctors had diagnosed the
illnesses. But many doctors deny the illnesses are real, while most
haven't yet learned how to diagnose or treat the illnesses, and few
want FM or CFS patients because they take so much time and the
physician's compensation isn't high enough. More problematically, most
provinces don't have billing codes for the illnesses, making it
difficult to record diagnoses. These reasons tell why the true number
is higher.

Most randomized population prevalence studies elsewhere and the one
conducted in Canada suggest the minimum Fibromyalgia population size is
about double the Statistics Canada numbers, ranging from 700,000 to 1.2
million Canadians battling Fibromyalgia's chronic widespread pain and
its associated symptoms.

Population numbers aside, the cost of FM & CFS to the Federal
Government in lost taxes and for long term disability insurance
payments is more than $3.4 billion dollars per year. An investment of
less than one percent of this in an action plan would reduce the long
term cost, as FM-CFS Canada has proposed to successive Federal
Governments. The Provinces spend billions too, but poorly and without a
plan. The true size of the community is important because it carries
great costs.

Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome are recognized by the World
Health Organisation, by the USA's CDC, and even Health Canada helped
develop internationally respected diagnosis and treatment guidelines.
The more than one million Canadians with FM & CFS need a national
awareness building campaign so that every patient and health
professional knows what they can do to improve outcomes and stay off
long-term disability insurance.

We encourage you to visit FM-CFS.ca to learn about these chronic and
disabling illnesses, which impact the daily lives of another two
million family members. We invite the media to look into this issue in
greater depth.

Thank you.
