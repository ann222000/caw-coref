Title: Greyhawk Supplement

"Fantasy being what it is, it appears that there will never be an end
to the development of fresh ideas, and this booklet is what we hope
will be but the first of a long series of periodic supplements to add
to your enjoyment of DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS. Meanwhile, find out what the
devious minds behind "Greyhawk Castle" have been dreaming up for the
amusement of the participants of that campaign."

From the foreword of the Greyhawk Supplement by E. Gary Gygax

Code:
TSR No.: 2003
Product Line: D&amp;D
Type of Product: Original D&amp;D

Credits:
Designer: Gary Gygax &amp; Rob Kuntz
With Special Thanks to Alan Lucion, Mike Mornard
and Jeff Key for Suggestions
Illustrations By Greg Bell

Release Date: 1979
Cover Price: $?
Components: A 70-page booklet an expansion on the original D&amp;D rules.

Description: Although this booklet is called the Greyhawk supplement,
it has no Greyhawk content and has little use other than as novelty
value. All of it contains new material, and a number of firsts,
exceptional strength for fighters, thieves, monsters and spells all
developed for the Greyhawk campaign set in the dungeons of castle
Greyhawk. The above quote is the only truly Greyhawk related piece.

Notes: This is a companion piece for Dave Arneson's Blackmoor
supplement. Many of the features of Arneson's campaign would later
find its way into Greyhawk, The Great Kingdom, Blackmoor, the Duchy
of Ten, (becoming the Duchy of Tenh) etc. Blackmoor predates
Greyhawk as the oldest campaign world.

Title: Tomb of Horrors

"In Ages past, a human magic-user/cleric of surpassing evil took the
steps necessaly to preserve his life force beyond the centuries he
had already lived, and this creature became the lich, Acererak. Over
the scores of years which followed, the lich dwelled with hordes of
ghastly servants in the gloomy stone halls of the very hill where the
Tomb is. Eventually even the undead life force of Acererak began to
wane, so for the next 8 decades, the lich's servants labored to
create the Tomb of Horrors. Then Acererak destroyed all of his slaves
and servitors, magically hid the entrance to his halls, and went to
his final haunt, while his soul roamed strange planes unknown to even
the wisest of sages."

From Tomb of Horrors by Gary Gygax.

Code: S1
TSR No.: 9023

Product Line: Advanced Dungeons &amp;Dragons
Type of Product:
Primary Credits: Gary Gygax
Release Date: 1978
Cover Price: $?
Components: Module with removable cover including maps.

New magical items:

Various artifacts like the crown and the scepter mentioned in the
text.

New creatures:

Several unique monsters, are described in the text, but full stat
blocks are not given, there is a four armed Gargoyle, what appears to
be a bone golem, and of course the Demi-lich. The various guardians
of the tomb and there are not a great deal of monsters to meet, are
given the briefest of descriptions. The Demi-lich is unlike any other
creature, nearly invulnerable, but not truly a great threat if
handled correctly, it reacts hostilely to certain stimuli, but is
acquiescent otherwise, more like a cursed object than an intelligent
foe.

Description:

S1 is the first module for D&amp;D published by TSR it is also the first
published Greyhawk module. The module its self is only 12 pages long
and has a total of 33 distinct locations, the module is filled out
with a book of illustrations detailing many of the locations within
the tomb. The layout of the tomb is quite complex for all its
apparent simplicity. The DM is cautioned not to give the PCs hints
or guide them in any way. At one point the module deliberately sets
out to deceive the players, by playing out a false ending. A product
of its age it is filled with instant death traps, which can kill a PC
if they happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Most
however give the PCs a sporting chance; the initial traps are rather
benign, a foreshadowing of what is to come. Toward the end of the
module the PCs are even given the tools to defeat the Demi-lich,
although the author had not realized this (see the introduction to
Return to the Tomb of Horrors).

Notes:

The module was written by Gygax as a leveler for high-level PCs, the
challenge of the module is not its apparent deadliness, but rather it
is a puzzle box with spring loaded poisoned razorblades. Characters
that enter this snake pit had better tread carefully. None of the
traps are random, although some are nearly unavoidable; there is a
fair bit of comedy in the module, as not all the traps are deadly,
but have amusing side effects. The module was later reprinted in a
collection called Realms of Horror, and the box set Return to the
Tomb of Horrors set 20 years after the tombs first discovery, expands
greatly on the original dungeon and contains a copy of it to be used
as part of its campaign, it however does not revise the original.

Comments:

This module has very little true Greyhawk content it could be set
anywhere; in fact 6 widely different locations are given 1) The
highest hill on the Plains of luz, 2) An island (unmapped) In the Nyr
Dyv, 3) In the Bright Desert, 4) At the western border of the Duchy
of Geoff, 5) Somewhere in the Vast Swamp south of Sundl, 6) On an
island beyond the realm of the Sea Barons. Return sets it firmly in
the great swamp. In the modules 12 pages we learn very little about
Acererak, his motives are obscure, hints abound, pictures of undead
servants on the walls, Demons occupying the ethereal plane in the
vicinity, and the introductory text above stating his origins and
that his soul is currently roaming strange planes unknown to even the
wisest of sages.

Title: In Search of the Unknown

"Word just reaching civilization tells of some great battle in the
barbarian lands where Rogahn and Zelligar have met their demise. This
rumored clash must have occurred some years ago, and there are few
detailsâ€”and no substantiation of the story. The only thing certain is
the Rogahn and Zelligar have been gone far too long. If only one had
the knowledge and wherewithal to find their hideaway, there would be
great things to explore! And who knows what riches of wealth and
magic might be there for the taking???"

From In Search of the Unknown by Mike Carr.

Code: B1
TSR No.: 9023

Product Line: Basic D&amp;D
Type of Product:
Primary Credits: Mike Carr
Release Date: 1979
Cover Price: $?

Components: Module with removable cover including maps.

Description:

B1 is an introductory module for 1st to 3rd level PCs, for use with
the D&amp;D basic set. The caverns of Quasqueton were constructed by two
long dead, legendary, but reclusive heroes the warrior Rogahn and the
mage Zelligar, as a hide away from civilization. Now abandoned the
PCs must plumb the depths of this monster-infested dungeon to recover
their fabled treasure. The module lists each location within the
upper and lower levels, the hero's residence and the caverns below
respectively, most rooms contain something of interest, furnishings
illusions or traps, each room has a blank monster and treasure entry
for the DM to enter treasure or monsters from the master list at the
end of the module and each level has a wandering monsters chart.

Notes:

No reference to Greyhawk is given, the module is tenuously linked to
module B2 the Keep on the Borderlands as B2's overland map includes a
location not detailed called the caverns of the unknown, and in the
25th anniversary return to the keep on the borderlands the caverns of
the unknown are renamed Quasqueton the name given to the caverns in
this module. The original printing of this module contains notes
(that this reviewer does not have access to) for placing Quasqueton
in Oerth

Both B1 and B2 are generic modules that could be set anywhere, the
Keep found its way into the Mystara campaign setting as original D&amp;D
developed out of these roots. As early generic modules they have
long been associated with Greyhawk.

Comments:

Like many of the "Dungeons" of the era this is a very basic module
(pun intended), very little plot is given it is simply a location
nothing more or less, a modern DM would need to hang a story upon
it. Very little avenue is given for the players to discover any
mystery about the architects of the Dungeon, or for the DM to convey
new information to the players. It lacks any point of resolution, or
discovery, there is no villain to defeat or mystery to solve. It has
potential as a location, but needs work, and makes a handy side trek
for the Keep.

Title: The Keep on the Borderlands

"The Realm of mankind is narrow and constricted. Always the forces of
Chaos press upon its borders, seeking to enslave its populace, rape
its riches, and steal its treasures. If it were not for a stout few,
many in the Realm would indeed fall prey to the evil which surrounds
them. Yet, there are always certain exceptional and brave members of
humanity, as well as similar individuals among its allies - dwarves,
elves, and halflings - who rise above the common level and join
battle to stave off the darkness which would otherwise overwhelm the
land. Bold adventurers from the Realm set off for the Borderlands to
seek their fortune. It is these adventurers who, provided they
survive the challenge, carry the battle to the enemy. Such
adventurers meet the forces of Chaos in a testing ground where only
the fittest will return to relate the tale."

From The Keep on the Borderlands, by Gary Gygax

Code: B2
TSR No.: 9023

Product Line: Basic D&amp;D
Type of Product: Module
Primary Credits: Gary Gygax
Release Date: 1979
Cover Price: $?

Components: Module with removable cover including maps.

Description:

B2 is an introductory module for 1st to 3rd level PCs, for use with
the D&amp;D basic set. The Keep has long been heralded as a classic
module; many an early player cut their adventuring teeth on this
module. It details a Keep as a base of operations for an adventuring
party's wilderness adventures and a series of nearby caves occupied
by various humanoids to test their dungeoning skills. This mix of
role-play interaction at the Keep and hack and slash in the caves
ensured the modules longevity of game play as most parties could not
clear the caves of chaos at low levels without constantly returning
home to the Keep for rest and re-equipment.

The Module is separated into three sections, the Keep, the wilderness
around the Keep and the Caves of Chaos.

The Keep is fairly well detailed, but not overloaded with
information; none of the NPC's have names for example only titles
like Castellan or Jovial Priest.

The wilderness contains the obligatory random encounter charts, and
several locations incase the PCs miss the obvious clues to the Caves
of Chaos.

Finally the second half of the module details the Caves of Chaos.
These are quite extensive, and contain several independent lairs of
humanoids, a Kobold lair, a Goblin lair, an Orc lair, a Hobgoblin
lair and a Gnoll lair, there is constant warfare between the Orcs and
Goblinoids with the Gnolls taking a mercenary position and the
Kobolds remaining neutral. The PC's actions could upset this balance
of power in their frequent visits in several ways. The great secret
of the caves is a hidden shrine that has a corrupting influence on
those who enter it, great play could be made of this as the evil
clerics abduct and initiate more and more people into their cause.
It is possible to use it as a great plot device, by having a PC
abducted and twisted by the temple. Do the other players PCs kill
their friend or try and subdue them and find a cure, what if they are
too late, they evade capture. Such moral dilemmas should be tracked,
if and when they start acting in an evil and chaotic manner. It's
too late. Finding and defeating the clerics at the shrine is not the
end of the story, it's the source of their woes, they must find some
way of permanently containing its evil or preferably permanently
destroy it.

Notes:

No reference to Greyhawk is given, in the 25th anniversary return to
the keep on the borderlands a suggestion was made to set the module
in the Yeomanry, see the review of this module. As an early generic
module it has long been associated with Greyhawk, due in some part to
its author.

Comments:

Like many early modules this one lacks any plot, it is simply a
series of connected locations for the PC to adventure in, it has in
this way the benefit of being very open ended and unconfining, but
lacking in direction.

Adapting it to Greyhawk:

The original module needs little adaptation the Yeomanry is as good a
place as any to start, place the Keep in far western Yeomanry near
the Crystalmist/Hellfurnace mountains, close to the terminus to the
ancient Kendeen Pass used by the Suel in their early migrations, but
long since blocked by volcanic activity as a 300 mile pass into the
sea of dust. The pass lends its name to Kendal Keep as a corruption
of the areas name; the pass still exists as an important road into
the mountains and the mining communities there trading food and goods
for ore, silver and gems. The castellan of the Keep does not fit
well with the Yeomanry stated democratic ideals, but he is likely a
spokesman having an ensured vote to elected office by the militia who
man the keep and are his employees. As a long-term basis for an
adventuring group membership of the militia and heroic status may
earn the PCs enough popular support to oust the present castellan and
have the PCs given custodianship of the Keep and its lands. The
temple in the caves of chaos could be dedicated to any evil Greyhawk
gods, or diabolic entity, ones of Suel origin are preferred or even
the great evil of Tharizdun. The evil temple in the first of the
Giants series is very similar, with this suggested location and their
relative proximity to each other a dark cult could be constructed.

Title: The Steading of the Hill Giant Chief

" Giants have been raiding the lands of men in large bands, with
giants of different sorts in these marauding groups. Death and
destruction have been laid heavily upon every place these monsters
have visited. This has caused great anger in high places, for life
and property loss means failure of the vows of noble rulers to
protect the life and goods of each and every subject-and possible
lean times for the rulers as well as the ruled. Therefore, a party of
the bravest and most powerful adventurers has been assembled and
given the charge to punish the miscreant giants. These adventurers
must deliver a sharp check, deal a lesson to the clan of hill giants
nearby, or else return and put their heads upon the block for the
headsman's axe!"

From The Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, by Gary Gygax.

Code: G1
TSR No.: 9023

Product Line: AD&amp;D 1st ed
Type of Product: Module
Primary Credits: Gary Gygax
Release Date: 1979
Cover Price: $?

Components: Module with removable cover including maps.

Description:

G1 is a adventure aimed at high level characters 10 and up of around
8 PCs,

The module is divided into two sections the upper workings and the
Dungeons below, the giants are presented as being incredibly slow
witted, PCs being able to pass themselves of as Giant children, and
so on, this is excusable only for their initial encounters, as the
Giants are not expecting an attack and have been feasting and a few
are drunk or sleeping off large quantities of booze.

The greatest task will be to take this fortress, giants are quite
formidable and will quickly become organized should the PCs be forced
to retreat after their first foray. Getting out again alive will be
a challenge in its self, not much is made of the wilderness around
the Steading or the giant's relations with other races, and their
kin, the players could attempt to play cat and mouse with the Giants,
while the giants might enlist the help of orcs and others to support
them, whilst hunting the PCs.

The lower dungeons are less fraught with danger but much more
interesting, the place is or superior construction, with ceilings of
17 to 20 feet high, a magical portal links this location with that of
the next Giant stronghold in the series, and an ancient temple to an
unnamed god (most likely Tharizdun) occupies a hidden location,
sealed by the current occupants. It is likely that this whole
underground complex once served another purpose.

Notes:

This is the second Greyhawk module to see publication; it's the first
of a classic seven part series, revamped to modern standards it would
be tough and epic to the extreme. The Giants are not feeble and
likely dominate the other tribes of humanoids within the area. They
have formidable resources. This module has been reprinted several
times in later collections, but never updated. G1-3 Against the
giants collects all three giant modules under one cover. By far the
best version of this series is the one presented in GDQ The Queen of
the Spiders booklet. In comparison the later Liberation of Geoff is
very inferior, as it includes the three original Giant modules, but
makes no attempt to fit them into its plotline, that breaks with
previous canon..

Comments:

The Steading has a real plot, it is part of an onion that has many
layers, the great mystery was that the Giants were secretly being
controlled by the Drow and in the series finally the characters
penetrate the abyss and face Lolth.

You will need to have a well-developed campaign before attempting
this module. In Queen of the Spiders, the collected GDQ series it
suggests playing T-4 The Temple of Elemental evil, then the S series,
the Slavers series then the GDQ series as the climax to the
campaign. Other alternatives present themselves if you wish to keep
your campaign local. The Night Below box set is a complete campaign
that will get the PCs to the required level and allow them some
contact with the Drow, and the underdark.

Hidden flaws:

The whole series is a little too relentless, I find it hard to
imagine that a modern audience would swallow some of the conceptual
problems the players are faced with, in the good old days monsters
stayed put and rarely got organized. PCs could wander into a Drow
city unmolested armed with only a badge to identify them as a friend,
and penetrate their most holy of holies to gain access to their god's
realm. Tomb of Horrors is cited as the most deadly, Greyhawk dungeon
due to its traps and practically un-killable villain, but within the
GDQ series a 20th level Lich is just a side encounter, and the PCs
face a real god. Even with all these apparent flaws the scope is
amazing and the problems can be overcome with a little difficulty.

Greyhawk canon has never fully resolved the final fate of this
series; as it has been consigned to history, it is apparently a
suicide run or would produce characters that would shake the Flanaess
should their mission be successful. One suggestion was in a recent
Dragon article, that the PCs cleared the giant's strongholds and made
it to the Vault of the Drow, and caused enough havoc to uncover
treachery and disloyalty within Lolth's own ranks, the gateway to the
Abyss a ploy to trap the PCs, in Lolth's nighmare web.

Title: World of Greyhawk Folio

Code:
TSR No.: 9025
Product Line: Greyhawk
Type of Product: AD&amp;D 1st Edition Campaign Setting

Credits:
Designer: Gary Gygax,
Editor: Allen Hammack,
Art: David C. Sutherland III, Erol Otus, David S. LaForce,
Maps By: Darlene Pekul,
Associate Editors: Mike Can, Timothy Jones, David C. Sutherland III,
Valuable Assistance: Harold Johnson, Jeff R. Leason, Lawrence Schick

Release Date: 1980
Cover Price: $?
Components: A single 32 page booklet and two poster sized adjoining
maps of the world of Greyhawk, by Darlene Pekul, (the
infamous "Darlene" maps), in a binder.

Description:

This set is greatly expanded upon by the World of Greyhawk box set.
It features a key to the map, a brief history of Greyhawk, and a
guide to the political divisions of the flanaess.
Notes: The later box set version recycles all of the material in
this set, only a completist collector would want both.

Title: World of Greyhawk Boxset

Code:
TSR No.: 1015

Product Line: Greyhawk
Type of Product: AD&amp;D 1st Edition Campaign Setting
Designer: Gary Gygax
Release Date: 1983
Cover Price: $15.00

Components:

Boxed set containing two books; a Guide to the World of Greyhawk
Setting, and a Glossography and two poster sized adjoining maps by
Darlene Pekul identical to those in the 1980 folio.

Description:

The Guide to the World of Greyhawk is a catalogue of the land of the
Flanaess it details the heavens, a brief history, the races,
languages, runes and glyphs, an alphabetical listing of states and
kingdoms and major geographical features such as mountain ranges,
marshlands, seas and oceans etc. honorifics, social rank and status
and heraldry. The guide is suitable for both players and DMs it
contains information any native might know. While the guide is simply
an expansion on material presented in the 1980 folio the Glossography
contains all new information. The Glossography is aimed primarily at
the DM. It details settlement populations as a key to the map, rates
of travel, encounter tables (that reference directly those in the 1st
ed DMG) political and noble rulers, weather tables, adventures ideas,
characters place of birth, deities and personages and the politics of
Greyhawk, the set also contains two maps.

Notes:

As a campaign setting the world of Greyhawk as presented in this set
has several flaws, the population is a fraction of what it should be
and remains so to the present day. Some view this as a
simplification as an aid to the DM, populations, cities and towns can
be designed on a more manageable level to be representative of the
whole. The weather charts make the campaign world very hot, places
like Keoland and the Yeomanry, based seemingly on a medieval English
model is placed in a sub-tropical zone. Comparisons between earth
and oerth abound, but each culture is difficult to pigeonhole, giving
enough clues to similarity to make the place on the one hand familiar
but adding enough difference to make the land strange, magical and
enigmatic. It was left deliberately vague so each set of DM and
players could create their own world of Greyhawk from this skeleton.
The maps have a printing error officially acknowledged when they were
first printed for the folio, the overlay for the towns and cities
symbols were printed off center, meaning that costal and riverside
locations are shown some way in land. The rule of thumb was stated
if a town or city is within a hex of water it should be on the river
lake or sea it is closest to, this error was never corrected.

With all these flaws, the set just for the maps and geopolitical
information, is a must for any greyhawk gamer.

These Modules can be downloaded for the price of $4.99 each from
www.SVgames.com they currently, do not have Keep on the Borderlands.

I would recommend, you obtain Queen of the Spiders, for the full GDQ
series and extra info, Return to the Tomb of Horrors (it contains the
original mod), forget the greyhawk supplement and folio and get the
box set.

Depending on the responce, I might continue this series of reviews.

[x] 11347 Axe of the Dwarvish Lords
The axe is originally from Greyhawk, but the
module
is generic, with no Greyhawk ties.

[X] 11327 Return to the Keep on the Borderlands
Although labelled as a Greyhawk module, Return
has almost no real Greyhawk content, and enough
non-Greyhawk gods to disqualify it

[X] 11361 Warriors of Heaven
Information on the pantheons of Oerth is included

[X] 11448 Dragon Magazine Archive [CD-ROM]
The Dragons in question include a wealth of
Greyhawk
articles and information

[X] 11431 Guide to Hell
An Oerth-based organization is included
