Thoreau returns to housing as a place of warmth. He calls it a sort of
extended set of clothes, but concedes that it is &quot;a necessary of
life&quot;. Our fondness for home may be more due to the qualities which
are not necessarily relevant to its place as a necessary though. Home
as a shelter from the snow and harsh weather is part of the use of a
home.

In Skinner's Walden members have their own rooms, or homes. Each home,
or &quot;room home&quot; is built next to each other in long buildings. The room
size is not clear from the novel but it would seem that they are
modest to small sized rooms. The focus of life in Skinner's Walden is
in the common rooms, passages, and areas. Your room is where you
sleep. But most of the day one is working, eating, outdoors, strolling
in a passage, playing chess in the Ladder or out and about. Even
married couples have their own rooms, suggesting that personal space
and privacy are fairly constant among the adult members, single or
not.

There is no suggestion that Skinner's conception of the home is much
different from Thoreau's in terms of personal space. Thoreau's house
was a small cabin, and a large room is about the same size as a small
cabin. Skinner's Walden focuses more on the practical aspects of
common areas - dining halls, theaters, music practice rooms, libraries
- while Thoreau's house opened out onto a more natural setting.

Thoreau made his house from the houses of others, while Skinner has
houses made from Pise or Rammed Earth (&quot;mud&quot; as one character refers
to it). One advantage to making a house out of rammed earth is that
the materials need not be imported. Trees do not need to be cut down,
lumber doesn't need to be brought in. Rammed earth is somewhat labor
intensive, but there are machines that can generate rammed earth
bricks which should be reasonable in price.

I mention materials because the size of homes or rooms is based on
materials to some extent, except for the richest amongst us.

Here is the original passage from Thoreau:
&quot;[1]    As for a Shelter, I will not deny that this is now a necessary
of life, though there are instances of men having done without it for
long periods in colder countries than this. Samuel Laing (1) says that
&quot;the Laplander (2) in his skin dress, and in a skin bag which he puts
over his head and shoulders, will sleep night after night on the snow
... in a degree of cold which would extinguish the life of one exposed
to it in any woollen clothing.&quot; He had seen them asleep thus. Yet he
adds, &quot;They are not hardier than other people.&quot; But, probably, man did
not live long on the earth without discovering the convenience which
there is in a house, the domestic comforts, which phrase may have
originally signified the satisfactions of the house more than of the
family; though these must be extremely partial and occasional in those
climates where the house is associated in our thoughts with winter or
the rainy season chiefly, and two thirds of the year, except for a
parasol, is unnecessary. In our climate, in the summer, it was
formerly almost solely a covering at night. In the Indian gazettes a
wigwam was the symbol of a day's march, and a row of them cut or
painted on the bark of a tree signified that so many times they had
camped. Man was not made so large limbed and robust but that he must
seek to narrow his world and wall in a space such as fitted him. He
was at first bare and out of doors; but though this was pleasant
enough in serene and warm weather, by daylight, the rainy season and
the winter, to say nothing of the torrid sun, would perhaps have
nipped his race in the bud if he had not made haste to clothe himself
with the shelter of a house. Adam and Eve, according to the fable,
wore the bower before other clothes. Man wanted a home, a place of
warmth, or comfort, first of warmth, then the warmth of the
affections.&quot;

Rammed Earth is a particularly efficient insulator, a feature that
makes it quite attractive.  As extensions of our clothes, one of the
most important functions of houses is insulation.  Way too much energy
goes into maintaining temperature homeostasis in the modern home.
