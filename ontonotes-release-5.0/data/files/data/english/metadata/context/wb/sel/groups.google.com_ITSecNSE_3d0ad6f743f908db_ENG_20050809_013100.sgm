Targeting the Enemy Within
Insider security risks grow as partners and suppliers increasingly have
access to corporate networks. Here's what companies are doing about the
threat.

AUGUST 08, 2005 HYPERLINK &quot;&quot;(COMPUTERWORLD) -
The fear of corporate data being stolen or accidentally leaked by insiders
is what keeps Andreas Wuchner-Bruhl awake at night. Detecting and stopping
such leaks is an enormous challenge, especially for large companies with
widely distributed data stores and networks, says Wuchner-Bruhl, head of
global IT security at Novartis Pharma AG, a $25 billion drug maker in Basel,
Switzerland.

These days, the problem is even tougher because it's no longer just the
disgruntled or malicious employee who poses the internal threat, says
Wuchner-Bruhl. It's also the careless user, the outside hacker posing as a
trusted user and others with inside access to enterprise networks, such as
suppliers, partners and service providers.

As a result, companies must take a fresh look at the scope of the insider
threat and figure out what new technology, processes and administrative
controls they need to implement to deal with it, says Wuchner-Bruhl.
&quot;Security people like to give the impression that things are under control,&quot;
he says. &quot;But the fact is, there are so many things we don't even begin
know&quot; about internal threats.

Wuchner-Bruhl is among a growing number of security managers who are looking
to see what new controls are needed at a time when internal attacks on
corporate information systems are increasing. In fact, at many of the
world's largest financial services companies, such attacks have already
surpassed external attacks, according to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu's June
report on its 2005 Global Security Survey. In the survey of Fortune 100
companies, 34% of the respondents said they had experienced internal attacks
in the past 12 months, compared with 14% in 2004. In contrast, only 26%
reported external attacks in the past 12 months.

&quot;Insider attacks are the most difficult to catch because these are
legitimate users using their legitimate access for inappropriate purposes,&quot;
says Pete Lindstrom, an analyst at Spire Security LLC in Malvern, Pa. &quot;They
tend to have the highest impact, since they are insiders with access and
they know where the valuable information is.&quot;

Know the Enemy

Understanding that it's not just the disgruntled employee who poses the
insider risk is a good place to start addressing the problem, says Jonathan
Bingham, president and chief technology officer at Intrusic Inc., a Waltham,
Mass.-based security products vendor. Very often, the more sophisticated
inside attacks are launched by outsiders who have stolen legitimate user
credentials and then use them to gain access to high-value targets, says
Bingham. For example, selectively planted Trojan horse programs were used to
collect the usernames and passwords of highly privileged users at more than
300 critical infrastructure companies in the U.K. earlier this year. The
credentials were then used by hackers to gain access to high-value systems.
Because such targeted attacks generate much less traffic than mass attacks,
they are harder to detect using traditional antivirus and e-mail filtering
tools, users say (see related story, QuickLink HYPERLINK
&quot;&quot;55220).

The growing interconnectedness of enterprise networks also means it's not
just the employee who has access to internal assets. &quot;We can have a
situation where a guy who has legitimate access for a day can plant a back
door on our systems and log in at will later,&quot; says Jeff Nigriny, chief
security officer at Exostar Inc., a business-to-business portal for the
aerospace industry in Herndon, Va.

Detecting the telltale signs of such activity requires a deeper analysis of
network traffic and behavior than most traditional security technologies
provide, Nigriny says.

Nigriny's company is using a hardware appliance from Intrusic called Zephon
to analyze network traffic at the packet, session, host and environment
levels. Such monitoring allows companies like Exostar to identify suspicious
internal network activity such as data flows going in the wrong direction,
servers consuming data instead of producing it and computers communicating
with one another where no such communication existed previously, Bingham
says.

Malicious insiders use network resources in subtly different ways from
normal users. Intrusic's tool is designed to detect such &quot;illegal movement
of a sophisticated individual within a network,&quot; Bingham says.

&quot;It looks for things down at the Level 2 and Level 3 layers. It doesn't care
what the application is,&quot; says Nigriny. The tool can be used to identify
issues as varied as a misconfigured firewall, an employee downloading porn
or someone attempting to upload confidential data to an external server in
an HTTP stream, he says.

What's Going Out

Network egress filtering is another way of finding out whether protected
data is leaving corporate boundaries in an illegal fashion, says Jeff
Karafa, chief financial officer at Community Bank of Dearborn in Michigan.

The bank uses a hardware appliance from Reconnex Inc. in Mountain View,
Calif., to examine outgoing corporate e-mail, Web mail, instant messages and
Web posts for confidential data such as customer account numbers.

Like other products in its class, Reconnex's iGuard technology uses a
combination of exact data matching, contextual analysis and policy
information to alert administrators when specific pieces of protected
information traverse the network. Such alerts can be useful in identifying
both malicious leaks and accidental ones—such as an employee sending a file
containing confidential information to his personal e-mail account so he can
work on it at home.

The amount of data that trickles out in such fashion can be surprising,
Karafa says. &quot;We thought we were doing pretty well on our own&quot; in detecting
such leaks, he says. But then the bank tested Reconnex's egress-filtering
tool and noticed how much sensitive information was slipping out, often as a
result of employees making mistakes. In one case, an employee was found to
be sending customer account information to a former worker and was promptly
fired, Karafa says.

&quot;When that data was presented to us, it was something of an eye-opener,&quot;
says Karafa, who also uses the Reconnex tool to monitor the Web surfing
habits of employees.

But content-monitoring tools don't always scale well and are of limited use
in environments where network traffic is encrypted, says Wuchner-Bruhl. He
is considering using digital rights management technologies to tag
confidential data and intellectual property in order to control how it is
accessed and used. DRM tools, which are available from vendors such as
Microsoft Corp., Authentica Inc. and Liquid Machines Inc., are designed to
let companies track how data is used and prevent employees who don't have
the right privileges from doing things like reading, altering, copying,
printing and forwarding data.

For the Money

Financial motives appear to be a primary driver in a growing number of
insider attacks, says Bingham. One example of that trend is the theft of
information on about 60,000 Bank of America Corp. customers by a New
Jersey-based data-theft ring that had also stolen information from three
other banks—Wachovia Corp., Commerce Bancorp Inc. and PNC Bank NA [QuickLink
HYPERLINK &quot;&quot;54542]. The ring's members
included seven former employees from across the four banks.

Most such inside attacks are planned in advance and can be prevented if the
right controls are in place, according to a report released in May by the
U.S. Secret Service and Carnegie Mellon University's CERT Coordination
Center. Good configuration management practices, for instance, allow
companies to identify unauthorized changes to software or the creation of
unauthorized remote-access accounts, both of which could portend trouble,
the report says. Segregating the duties of systems administrators and
privileged users is another way of ensuring that a single person doesn't
have unbridled access to network resources, according to the report.

It's also important to have the right processes in place for disabling
network access when employees are terminated, notes the report, which is
based on an investigation of 49 cases of insider attacks via computer
systems in critical infrastructure sectors between 1996 and 2002.

Many inside attacks continue to be the work of disgruntled employees and
former workers who still have access to corporate systems after they leave,
according to the CERT report.

In many cases, the triggers for such attacks are negative work-related
incidents that could be addressed via formal human resources processes for
handling employee grievances, and by reporting suspicious behavior, the
report says.

Companies need to use access control and account provisioning tools to
identify and close the &quot;orphan accounts&quot; that are left behind when employees
leave or are terminated. The failure to close such accounts gives former
employees an entry into the corporate network.

Training, user awareness and administrative measures are perhaps as
important as technology when it comes to dealing with insider risks, says
Kim Milford, information security manager at the University of Rochester in
New York. Outside hackers are increasingly using social engineering methods,
such as spoofed e-mails and Web sites, to lure people into disclosing
sensitive information and user credentials. These so-called phishing and
pharming exploits are now among the top security concerns of the financial
companies in the Deloitte survey.

The efficacy of such methods on untrained users can be alarming, says Jason
Jones, a webmaster at a private university in Texas that he asked not be
named. In a test earlier this year, Jones and his team managed to harvest
authentication credentials from over 90% of targeted individuals by using
spoofed e-mail and Web pages designed to look as though they were from the
university's IT security team.

Educating and training employees about such issues is key, Milford says.
It's also vital that employees know security policies and the consequences
of misusing corporate data and network resources, says Wuchner-Bruhl.

Technological measures are important as well, Milford says. Among those
Milford has found useful are controls that enforce least privilege rules,
meaning they give users no more access than they need. She also likes tools
that use IP restrictions to limit access to protected information and keep
logs for monitoring unsuccessful application access attempts.

In addition, Milford advocates the use of a what she calls a
&quot;carrot-and-stick policy&quot; to induce good security practices. The stick could
be a comprehensive policy with strong enforcement, she says. The carrot
could take the form of incentives for completing security training, such as
job reclassification, merit raises, bonuses and increased opportunities for
career development, Milford says. Empowering staffers at all levels of the
organization to learn about security and take steps to guard organizational
resources in their power is also key, she says.

&quot;Education, empowerment and enforcement are probably the most critical ways
to create a climate of security for administrators and users,&quot; Milford says.
&quot;Utilizing and reinforcing the message that everyone has a responsibility
for information security is important.&quot;
