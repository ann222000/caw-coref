I'm really worried about Dot.  For weeks, she's kept to herself in the
kitchen, on top of her chair, or hiding beneath it.  This isn't her
normal, happy, demanding, and unsuppressed self.  I know that Dot
loves to play, loves to sleep with her hoomins, loves to explore,
loves scritches and belly rubs, always wants to join in whatever I'm
doing.  But she doesn't get to do these things anymore, because she
lives in fear and anxiety.  Her safe spot is a chair in the kitchen.

She's continued to pee in various corners of the kitchen in such
quantity that I doubt she ever actually pees inside the litter box.
I'm always a step behind cleaning up after her, because the pee
doesn't show up against waxed linoleum, even under a blacklight.  I
kind of avoid the kitchen now, except when cleaning it, which is
often, because it's pretty gross.

Dot's attitude towards Buster has always been so consistently nervous
and hostile.  But he's well behaved with her.  Sometimes, he shows
some mild curiosity of her.  Most of the time, he doesn't notice her.
If she growls at him, he leaves.  She'll sometimes take a swipe at him
and run away, if he wanders near her while he's minding his own
business.

I want so much for Dot not to live alone and in fear anymore.  I want
her to join the family and live a life filled with play and love, and
being loved.  I want her to accept Buster as just the little
power-napping self-occupied little goof that he is, and not some scary
monster.  Her behavior living in the house with another cat is soo
atypical of her natural outgoing personality.

Dot, please accept Buster as your little bro-fur.

Well, Dot is on buspirone, which is supposed to be a good treatment
for kitty anxiety, and said to typically eliminate behavioral urine
marking, even after discontinuing after an 8 week course.  Dot has a
prescription for a 13 week course.  She's been on it for a week now.

I think I see why Dot was given up to the shelter - in the six cat
household she was in before, her problems were probably unmanageable.
It's hard enough with just these two.  Also, I think she was meant for
me - sort of like an assignment.

I don't know what to tell you, Tak, except I'm sorry you, Dot and Buster are
having these problems.  I really think some cats have personality problems
just like some humans do.  We got Demi when she was only 5 weeks old, have
treated her like the little princess she is for the last 9 years, but during
that entire time she has lived under a bed and fled from us whenever we
approach her even for pettin's.  It breaks my heart when I think about all
she's missed in her life, but there never was anything that we could do to
change her.  That's one of the reasons I was so upset when Sammy started
living under my bed when we got Tayla - I *DID NOT* want to have another cat
who lives her life in fear and alone, it would have broken my heart to see
me outgoing lovable little Sammy end up like that, because that is *NOT* her
natural personality!

I'm thinking that the Buspar ought to help. If it doesn't at the end of
the course, you might want to talk to the about one of the other similar
drugs. Sometimes animals (or people) just fail to respond to some drugs.

I really don't know what to suggest, Tak.  You are doing the best you can to
integrate them.  I would probably contact the shelter to see exactly why Dot
was given up, if the owners told the truth, of course.
I would persevere myself, for ages.  Let the house smell for a while, it
might be worth it in the end.
If Dot will never *ever* accept Buster in the house without peeing your
house up, you face a harder decision that I would ever want to make.
Purrs and prayers coming over the pond for you all.

I've often thought that Demi is just naturally self-selected to be a
hidey-cat.  Before you got Demi as a 5-week old, didn't she have a
pretty traumatic under-the-car ride?  Unless I'm remembering a
different kitten...  Anyway, there she learned - one step outside her
hiding place, and she'll be hurt for sure!  Or, she hid there so well
in the first place because she was born a hider.  Also, Bandit didn't
accept her as well as she accepted Sammy, IIRC.

But she sounds like she just has that hidey personality.  If the
buspirone treatment works on Dot, I might recommend that you try it on
Demi. :)  Seriously though, it is supposed to be anti-anxiety.

My heart really goes out to you.  It was easy for me to take on Boyfie.
Kitty was still patrolling her garden at the time and for some reason she
accepted him being there.  She never did for any other cat, she would fight
them off fiercely.  It was a small step for her to allow him into the house.
Maybe she recognised his beautiful soul.

This does not help you any, though.  I have no experience at all of indoor
cats.  It's pretty safe for them to be outdoor/indoor here and this probably
diffuses anything.  &quot;Are you looking at me?&quot; soon becomes redundant when
they can disappear into the fields for hours to look for mowsies and big
insects. Or a rabbit. And plan how they will get them..

dearest Tak:

Although I read this group almost every day, you know how little I post.
You are my kitty-rescuer hero and I have often told sympathetic animal
lovers of your super-hero life of caring for a kitty.  Betty's story sucked
me into this group (I mean that in a GOOD way) and also any fan-club you

I was so thrilled when you adopted again but was scared about whom you
adopted.  Trying to intergrate two strange kitties at once is an awesome
undertaking under the best of circumstances and the odds were probably
stacked way against you.  As you sacrificed monetarily and more importantly
your HEART for Betty, you are now sacrificing your lifestyle. You have a
right to sanitation, hygiene, whatever you want to call it. This isn't the
case of an invalid or immature animal wrecking your home.  Dot is UNhappy
and that needs to be addressed sooner now than later.

Kitties are sentient beings in all the colors of the rainbow like people.
Your little blended family is not well blended, that's all.  No fault of
yours.  Or them!

Dot is obviously an only-kitty type.  I had one of those, my greatest
bestest and most wonderful kitty.  She did not act out when another kitty
was brought in, she simply ignored the other to death and made it perfectly
clear she was in fact, a squirrel :)

And Buster, I would say right now I would be happy to take Buster from you.
He is the kind of upbeat happy dude I need! The apt where I live allows one
cat and only one though.  And you know what?  Buster needs another kitty :(

Dot, I can't abide the inappropriate elimination.  There are times where
that is what you have to live with and I have, but Dot has issues.  They
may work out if her life is as she needs it to be but I don't have the
resources to address it.

Anyway, this is just moral support for what is probably the unpopular
opinion.  Keep Dot.  Only cat.  And Buster is more adoptable (damn, I WANT
him) but he needs other kitties to play with.

You just can't have them both.  Buster can survive and is being a
well-behaved companion under the current restrictions, but is this really
fair to him, you want him to go a year like this when he could be playing
in a clowder?

And currently you are keeping Dot a veritable hostage of her personality
(whim? disorder?) who is showing her displeasure about her current
circumstances in the best way she knows how.

You will do the right thing.  I have the upmost of faith in you, and well,
yeah I will probably get flamed but whatever.  As long as we all try to do
our best by the wonderful furry souls that do cross the paths in our
lifetime :)

&gt;&gt;Can't we just get along purrs and wishes for you all from the

&gt;&gt;she'll see that sharing her Paw with Buster is a good thing.  Is
&gt;&gt;there a kitty behaviorist in your area that you can consult?

&gt; Yes, I can get a referral to a behaviorist.  If pharmacology fails, we
&gt; need to try psychology next, I guess?

More purrs on the way from my two boys who have certainly found a way to get
along despite their differences.  Every so often Dante will go barrelling
into Stinky and earn a hiss and a smack, but peace reigns here.  They are
not exactly friends, but they share the house and their toys, and they both
know their Mommy loves them.
Don't give up, please Tak.  I know it's had to see her upset, but sometimes
patience is the best thing.

&gt;You are my kitty-rescuer hero and I have often told sympathetic animal

I miss her so much!  Even the most wonderful kitties, and Dot and
Buster are that, can ever replace Betty.  Nothing heroic happened
though. :)  The story was, she got cancer, treatments couldn't contain
it, and I put her to sleep.

It's true that the situation isn't ideal for either of them, but
frankly, they're just going to have to put up with it for the time
being.  I'd be more casual about giving up Buster if there was a
shortage of young cats for adoption, which there isn't.

After Betty, we're familiar with this drill - when I'm faced with a
kitty problem, I'll stubbornly try various options one by one over the
course of several months, until I run out of options.  There are still
various things left to be tried with Dot.  I may even eventually
consider putting Buster on sedation to make him seem less threatening
to Dot.  Although Buster is already naturally plenty sedate for a
young cat, and Dot's phobia of other cats is sufficiently irrational
that I'm not sure that would do anything for her.

And don't worry, I won't consider giving up Dot.  I'm the owner of
this problem. :)  I'm growing more and more familiar with her issues
every day, and I don't want her to start from square one somewhere
else.  But it's very frustrating seeing a good kitty's spirit crushed
by imagined demons.

No advice to share, Tak, but many purrs and good thoughts on the way for
Dot to &quot;settle in&quot; and enjoy her new realm with a doting Paw, even
though it includes a &quot;pesky young-un&quot;.

&gt; I'm really worried about Dot.  For weeks, she's kept to herself in the
&gt; kitchen, on top of her chair, or hiding beneath it.  This isn't her
&gt; normal, happy, demanding, and unsuppressed self.  I know that Dot
&gt; loves to play, loves to sleep with her hoomins, loves to explore,
&gt; loves scritches and belly rubs, always wants to join in whatever I'm
&gt; doing.  But she doesn't get to do these things anymore, because she
&gt; lives in fear and anxiety.  Her safe spot is a chair in the kitchen.

&gt; She's continued to pee in various corners of the kitchen in such
&gt; quantity that I doubt she ever actually pees inside the litter box.
&gt; I'm always a step behind cleaning up after her, because the pee
&gt; doesn't show up against waxed linoleum, even under a blacklight.  I
&gt; kind of avoid the kitchen now, except when cleaning it, which is
&gt; often, because it's pretty gross.

&gt; Dot's attitude towards Buster has always been so consistently nervous
&gt; and hostile.  But he's well behaved with her.  Sometimes, he shows
&gt; some mild curiosity of her.  Most of the time, he doesn't notice her.
&gt; If she growls at him, he leaves.  She'll sometimes take a swipe at him
&gt; and run away, if he wanders near her while he's minding his own
&gt; business.

&gt; I want so much for Dot not to live alone and in fear anymore.  I want
&gt; her to join the family and live a life filled with play and love, and
&gt; being loved.  I want her to accept Buster as just the little
&gt; power-napping self-occupied little goof that he is, and not some scary
&gt; monster.  Her behavior living in the house with another cat is soo
&gt; atypical of her natural outgoing personality.

&gt; Dot, please accept Buster as your little bro-fur.

&gt; Well, Dot is on buspirone, which is supposed to be a good treatment
&gt; for kitty anxiety, and said to typically eliminate behavioral urine
&gt; marking, even after discontinuing after an 8 week course.  Dot has a
&gt; prescription for a 13 week course.  She's been on it for a week now.

&gt; I think I see why Dot was given up to the shelter - in the six cat
&gt; household she was in before, her problems were probably unmanageable.
&gt; It's hard enough with just these two.  Also, I think she was meant for
&gt; me - sort of like an assignment.

Lots of purrs and best wishes for buspirone to work,
Polonca and Soncek
