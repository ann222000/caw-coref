THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE LOOKED AT NEWSGROUPS, AND I FIND THAT THERE
ARE SOME OF US CRAZIES ALREADY ORGANIZED. I COLLECT BLUE &amp; WHITE
STAFFORDSHIRE TRANSFER-PRINTED WARE, MOSTLY NO LATER THAN THE 1840'S, AND
I SPECIALIZE IN CHINOISERIE AND INDIAN SCENES. I ALSO HAVE A COLLECTION
OF ENGLISH IRONSTONE (1815-1845 APPROX.) WHICH IS QUITE EXTENSIVE. LATELY
I'VE STARTED COLLECTING STAFFORDSHIRE POLYCHROME PORCELAIN WITH
CHINOISERIE DESIGNS. THIS LAST STUFF SEEMS TO BE MOSTLY TEAWARES RATHER
THAN DINNER WARES. I'M ACTIVE IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CERAMIC CIRCLE, A
COLLECTOR'S ORGANIZATION WHICH IS AN AFFILIATE OF THE FINE ARTS MUSEUMS OF
SAN FRANCISCO. I'D LIKE TO KNOW (AT LEAST VIA COMPUTER) OTHERS WHO HAVE
SIMILAR INTERESTS AND COLLECTIONS. MY NAME IS MICHAEL SACK, BUT M L SACK
IS THE CLOSEST I COULD GET TO THAT IN A SCREEN NAME.

Hi. I collect blue and white Staffordshire, too, mostly plates but
also hollowware. Many American scenes, but I also like some of the
named English scenes. In particular, I am trying to get a complete
set of the Riley large scroll border plates. I have 8-10 so far.

Hi Stephen,
From your description of the pots, they are what is referred to as Pratt
Ware Pots. Anyone disagree? I can't remember the exact history about
this ware, but they are Victorian and they are very collectable. Most
held common household cleaning, cooking or medical/cosmetic
creams/ointments of the day. ie: anchovy paste, tooth powder. People
ususlly only find the lids, so having the complete pot is a real find.
Check any antique book on Pratt Ware. Good luck!
BTW, they sound adorable!
Jon

"/>  I shan't disagree! Pictorial potlids came into fashion in about 1840,
when colour printing on ceramics was perfected. They are usually found
on small pots made to contain pastes, ointments and cosmetics. Between
1840 and about 1900, more than 300 designs were produced; all are
well-documented. The best ones are the early flat ones made between
1845 and 1860, and convex topped ones, made between 1860 and 1875.
Later lids had weaker colours and a heavier texture. Later, post-1900
re-issues can usually be detected by the lack of crazing.

Prattware is a form of creamware (fine lightweight pottery covered with
a clear lead glaze) and was popularised, and produced, by the firm of
Felix Pratt, of Delph Lane (Tunstall), Staffordshire, and is especially
known for pictorial earthenware jugs, decorated in yellow, brown, blue
and green. It was, however, widely produced during the late C18th and
C19th, by firms such as Dixon and Austin of Sunderland. Prattware
potlids are especially collectable, especially those signed by the
engraver Jesse Austin.

Things to avoid are lids with poor colour or registration, such as
where the successive layers of colours do not match or line up
properly. Damage and restoration greatly devalues even the rare ones.

Cheers, Laurie.

"/> Many thanks, Laurie, for erudite reply. I have turned up five of these items in
China. I shall look out for more. Mine are very well coloured, with good
registration (ensured by small circular registration marks on the transfer at the
four quarters.)

One has been broken and repaired, The others are perfect. All have both the lids and
the bases, but I have to infer the original contents from the staining.

You presumably know the series with pictures of bears on the slightly concave lids
(approx. 3 inches diameter.) Are there some of these which are rarer than others?
If it does not fall foul of protocol, can you give me an idea of their value in the
West, so that I know the maximum I should offer in China? (p.s. I am not asking for
a specific valuation on my own items, but just &quot;you should offer between x and y,
depending on condition...&quot; sort of thing.)

Ok, I know I pointed people at my netsuke article, but the questions
continue to come, and to centre around real vs fake ivory, and the
difference between ivory and bone. Here's a quick run-through of the
main points, which have been cut and very briefly edited to make them
more general, from the piece I wrote for netsuke:

There are two main reasons that fake ivory abounds. Firstly, it is easy
to do, and secondly, the patina, which is the key asset or quality for
any antique, is easily to reproduce sufficiently well to fool most
people.

Faint longtitudinal stripes are a sure way to spot the fake ivories
that appeared at the turn of the century, with the stripes built into
them. The grain in genuine ivory is only visible at certain angles,
whereas simulated ivory grain is always visible and very regular. To
find the grain, hold the piece towards a light so that the stripes are
visible; slowly rotate or horizontally revolve it through 90 degrees,
and the grain should become very faint/much less pronounced or
disappear. If it doesn't, it's probably fake. This technique takes a
little perfecting, but it's worth the effort. Also, on the simulated
ivory, the stripes also tend to be wider and more regular. The colour
of these fakes is also revealing: they are not stained, and are an even
white all over - too white.

The forgeries made around 1900 are in casein (which is made from milk)
and other plastics, and sometimes have the signatures cast instead of
carved; no genuine netsuke would be signed in any other way other than
by carving. Also, when viewed from the base, the fake piece still shows
the stripes as parallel lines, whereas genuine elephant ivory shows
concentric circles or lozenges rather like tree-rings. Also, if the
piece is made of a whole tusk section, as opposed to a quarter or other
part, there should be a central nerve canal, often inset with something
such as a lacquer panel containing the signature. No genuine ivory
piece will have lines which are more-or-less parallel: just imagine,
given the tree ring analogy, how large the tusk would have to be to
have almost parallel lines even in a small piece such as a netsuke.

Another substitute for elephant ivory is walrus tusk (which is a tooth,
unlike an elephant's tusk), which can be distinguished from true ivory
by its core of granular dentine, often disguised by cross-hatching or
similar patterning. Walrus ivory is composed of different layers and so
is less stable than true ivory, and more prone to cracking. An even
cheaper, and poorer, substitute is bone. Unlike ivory, bone is provided
with a blood source, and so even in small pieces, has minute pores and
channels through which the bone is kept alive. They appear on a carving
as small brown or black spots or channels, and you need to watch for
carving or marks attempting to disguise them.

Since the mid-70s large numbers of very deceptive netsuke and other
ivory figures have been made by casting in plastic resin in a flexible
rubber mould. Taken from originals, usually of okimono (carved ivory
fisures) from the second half of the C19th and therefore highly
accurate (the moulding process is so sensitive it picks up every
characteristic of the original, including under-cutting), these are
extremely difficult to detect. After casting, they are stained in a
deep sepia, which is thinner than the proud surfaces and gives a good
impression of wear. These pieces are all-pervasive, and often have dust
in the lower nooks and crannies to simulate age; this is all part of
the faking process. Turn-of-the-century plastic fakes are lighter than
real ivory, but this has been overcome with the modern ones.

There are two main ways of detecting modern fakes. A chip on genuine
ivory shows an irregular new surface of a similar colour but of,
perhaps, a paler shade or tone. In modern resin, the chip is akin to
glass. Secondly, temperature. Ivory feels much colder than resin as it
conducts heat away from the body faster. However, the definitive and
only foolproof temperature test is burning. Hold a pin in a pair of
pliers, and heat it until it's red-hot. Then stick it in some
inconspicuous part of the carving. If it's genuine ivory, it will
barely mark the surface, and will make that distinctive burnt-teeth
smell you may know from the dentist. If it's plastic/resin, it will
plunge readily into the piece with a puff of smoke, and create a burr
round the hole. There will also be a strong smell of burning plastic.

Be aware too, that China is supplying vast numbers of &quot;hand-carved&quot;
netsuke in ivory. They make no pretence to be old, although some are
stained, or taken in by second-tier fakers who attempt to age the piece
in order to deceive the unwary. They can be found in profusion at
airport and hotel shops, fairs and small dealers, and are remarkably
cheap. Please bear in mind that as old ivory is very hard, and
therefore difficult to carve, these are always made from new ivory.
These pieces are made in such numbers that said ivory is almost always
poached, and buying these pieces only serves to continue the slaughter.

Older netsuke, those made in what is considered the golden age, between
the late C18th and mid C19th, show over a century of natural ageing and
wear. Remember that these pieces were in daily use, and such wear will
be noticeable on the raised portions of the figure or carving, and on
the cord holes or himotoshi. This wear is almost impossible to
reproduce convincingly. The patina, an important part of any antique,
builds up from constant handling and use, and exposure to the air, and
is especially difficult to reproduce. Ivory darkens as it ages, but
haphazardly. Fake pieces stained with sepia show a consistent
colouring, unrealistic and often with a nasty pink tinge.

Cheers, Laurie.

Dear Laurie,

I'm neither a netsuke aficionado nor an ivory collector, although I own
a few pieces I've inherited. I just wanted to thank you for a
wonderful, informative piece. In all the reading I've done in this

And I'll be downloading your article in full from the web site.

Amen to all that Jon. I can't believe people are arguing with you about

Folks, Jon is an expert in his field, with years of experience in
antiques, especially metalwares of all types. He *knows* what he's
talking about. I may be mostly versed in English furniture, but as a
general dealer too, I whole-heartedly endorse Jon's advice. With very
few exceptions, such as late C19th medical, scientific and other such
instruments, metalware needs no more than love and attention, and a
thin coating of good quality beeswax. There is no shortcut where
antiques are concerned.

"/>  Kathy,

Most of the time, furniture requires no more cleaning than a good
polish with a high-quality wax. Doing any more than that can and often
will completely ruin the all-important patina on a piece. However,
there are occasions when more drastic cleaning can be required. In this
case, please do no more than use a proprietary furniture cleaning
product, one which won't harm the patina or finish, and will merely
remove dirty wax. I can recommend Rustin's products, but I don't know
if they're available in the states or not.

If your furniture is in need of any more &quot;cleaning&quot; than that, please
take it to a restorer and ask his or her advice.

&gt;&gt; Help! In my grandmother's estate are 8 antique plates and I need to know if
&gt;&gt; they are old and what they are worth. Each one has a different picture on the
&gt;&gt; front of people in 18th C. dress that looks partially hand-painted and is
&gt;&gt; signed (I can't read the signitures). On the back is printed R.F.ST. Under
&gt;&gt; that is a blue beehive, under that is Made in Vienna, and under that is
&gt;&gt; Austria. Any help in this would be greatly appreciated so I can settle the
&gt;&gt; estate.

"/>  Dave, I'm no expert on porcelain, but a quick skim through one of my
reference books shows a mark a little like a beehive. In fact, two
marks. The first is like an upside down beehive; a U with a line across
the base, and two horizontal stripes equally spaced inside the U. The
second is similar, except there's a thing like a small inverted V at
the rounded base, and what looks like a B on its back across the top of
the U. Both marks relate to the Royal Factory (RF?) of Austria. Both
these marks were in use in the late C18th. I have no idea when this
factory closed, if it has.

What I can tell you is that it is unlikely, given the fact that they
have &quot;Made in Vienna&quot; and &quot;Austria&quot; on the base, that they are older
than 1891, whereupon items were stamped with the country of origin to
comply with the McKinley Tarrif act of America. I further suspect that
they are unlikely to be pre-1910, from about which time wares were often
stamped with the full &quot;Made in &lt;wherever&gt;&quot;. The biggest clue to value
and age would be in the quality and type of decoration, which is
something I can't actually see!

If you're in doubt, have them looked at by an expert.

I hope this helps, Laurie.

"/>  A secretaire is a piece of furniture which often resembles a chest of

A bureau is similar to the above, and has either a fall, tambour or

is always vertical, and a bureau front never is. The most common type
is a simple slope or fall.

A secretaire-bookcase and a bureau-bookcase are as described above but

"/>  Roger,

Carefully is the answer. It depends on your definition of antique, but
let's assume it it's more than 50 years old. You will need to use a
small, soft toothbrush, mild soap, and water. Test first on an
inconspicuous part of the bear (hard to find!). *Gently* clean the pile
of the bear's fur with the soap and water *TAKING GREAT CARE NOT TO WET
THE BACKING FABRIC). Allow to dry, and brush clean. Wash the brush
regularly, don't rub the dirt in, don't use dirty water, don't over-use
the soap.

This is a delicate and time-consuminbg exercise, and one whereby it's
easy to wreck the bear's value. Be careful, and if in doubt, get a
profesisonal to do it for you.

Cheers, Laurie.

"/>  George Hepplewhite (d.1786) was a British Cabinetmaker and furniture
designer. He is especially well-known for shield-back and oval-back
chairs, and sideboards with concave corners, but a wide range of
furniture and other items were made based on his designs. He is
particularly identified with the post-Chippendale period. None of his
furniture is known to have survived, consequently his reputation rests
on the very detailed designs, styles and patterns he produced, notably
in his &quot;The Cabinetmaker's and Upholsterer's Guide&quot; which was published
in 1788 (after his death, by his widow). These designs were widely
circulated and copied in England, Europe and the US. His style can be
described as a simpler, more homely version of the neo-classical style
of the Adam Brothers, for whom he almost certainly worked.

The Federal period to which you refer, as I understand the American
term, covers approximately 1790-1810, which allowing for the time taken
for trends to travel in those days, is about right for Hepplewhite.
However, whilst Hepplewhite may be of the &quot;Federal&quot; period, it is, I
think, overstating matters rather to say that Federal = Hepplewhite!!!

Cheers, Laurie.

right. Hepplewhite was English but its called George III in England(?)
In American its the earliest Federal (post Revolution) period. Time
period (1790-1810) in references like Comstock is useless because of
vernacular style lag. Style (tapered legs; shield backs; swags; eagles;
string inlay, etc.) persists right into mid 1800's in some places.

Okay, now I'm really confused. Is this a stuffed bear as in a toy
made of pile on a cloth backing, or a toy made of fur, or a product
of the taxidermist's art?

&gt;&gt; Roger,

&gt;&gt; Carefully is the answer. It depends on your definition of antique, but
&gt;&gt; let's assume it it's more than 50 years old.

&gt;&gt; Paul Meaden

"/>  No problem, Paul. A &quot;hairy paw&quot; is a kind of foot found on furniture, as
in the places one would expect to find, for instance, the much better
known and more common &quot;ball and claw&quot; foot. It was first used towards
the end of the C17th, and appears sporadically thereafter. It's
sometimes known as a &quot;paw foot&quot;, but that is a more generic term,
covering several different types of paw-like feet.

Cheers, Laurie.

&gt;&gt; I've recently acquired two pieces of wood furniture and would like some advice.

&gt;&gt; i) is a Victorian chest of drawers, mahogany, in quite nice shape but you
&gt;&gt; guessed it, at some point it has been painted all over with white gloss paint. I
&gt;&gt; would like to restore it to its' natural finish - what might be the best way to
&gt;&gt; do this? Heat gun, chemicals, acid bath, combination of these or something else
&gt;&gt; entirely?

"/>  Phil,

The c-o-d is almost certainly veneered, and that rules out any method
involving excessive heat, or immersion in water. If you were to follow
either of these routes, you would completely ruin the piece. That
leaves three options you can consider, in ascending order of merit.

Firstly, if you're very lucky, the person who painted it won't have had
the sense to key the surface first, and the paint won't be adhering too
well. In this case, and if so, you will probably be able to scrape the
paint with a fingernail, you may be able to pull the paint off with
tape. Take a tape such as masking tape, and press it hard onto the
paint. Rip it up, and if you're lucky, the paint will come with it.
Beware loose or cracked veneer, especially in areas without a large
surface area.

Secondly, you may be able to scrape the paint off with a scraper. There
are commercial tools around, but the edge of a freshly broken piece of
glass is just as effective, and probably kinder to the wood. I suggest
you try a combination of these two methods.

Thirdly, chemical strippers. Nowadays, in addition to good old
Nitromors, one can buy strippers for particular finishes. Note
carefully two things. If you use chemicals, you will probably also
remove the shellac finish, which means that the piece will have to be
repolished, which is no easy task for an amateur. Most chemical
strippers have a darkening effect on some woods, always test a small
area first. Homebase (there's probably one near you) sells a lot of
stuff for furniture restoration, I suggest you take a look. I like
Rustin's products best.

Lastly, please be aware that there is no quick way to do this, it will
take a long time, and you must be very, very careful. Taking short cuts
will probably ruin the piece.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; ii) is a 1950s Ercol dining table, probably pine or maple, which at some point
&gt;&gt; has not been looked after too well &amp; is scratched, and has water marks on the
&gt;&gt; top. I've managed to reduce their effect by cleaning &amp; using wood restorer &amp; wax
&gt;&gt; polish, but wonder if there is more I could do.

"/>  It sounds to me as if you've done all you should do, and I suspect that
any more work would ruin it. If in doubt, only do as much as is
required to preserve a piece. One day, 50's Ercol stuff will be an
antique!

BTW, if you're with BT, you may be in Ipswich. If so, I'll be there
(it's &quot;home&quot;) at the weekend. Let me know, and I may have time to look
at the c-o-d for you.

Cheers, Laurie.

&gt;&gt; Could someone out there please help me. I am looking for info about a watch
&gt;&gt; I recently acquired. The maker is John Forrest, London. Hallmarks are: a
&gt;&gt; lion, an anchor, the letter &quot;C&quot; and the initials &quot;WE&quot;. There is also a
&gt;&gt; serial number: 530989.
&gt;&gt; Any information such as the history of the maker; where and when the watch
&gt;&gt; was made, etc. would be greatly appreciated.

"/>  Bill,

Silver marks usually come in sets of four or more: the &quot;hall&quot; or town
where they were assayed, in your case, this is the anchor, and denotes
Birmingham; the &quot;standard&quot; or quality mark, with some exceptions
English silver always has a lion passant (walking leftwards); the date
stamp, in your case the letter C (the &quot;font&quot; of which is *extremely*
important); and the maker's mark, in your case &quot;WE&quot;. Note that the
standard mark is frequently placed, as yours is, before the hall mark.

So, the piece was assayed in Birmingham, and I know that &quot;WE&quot; relates
to the maker William Elliott who was based in London between 1810 and
1844. For Birmingham, the letter &quot;C&quot; in its various forms relates to:
1775, 1800, 1826, 1851, 1877, 1902, and 1927.

If the maker is William Elliott and not John Forrest, London as you
say, then I'd as I can't see the &quot;font&quot; of the &quot;c&quot;, I suggest it's
dated 1826. The date letter needs to be described in detail, the &quot;font&quot;
used, and the precise shape of the box it's enclosed in. The &quot;WE&quot; BTW,
is in a rectangular box, capital letters, with a centred dot between
the letters. John Forrest could have been the retailer, or the
watchmaker, William Elliott having been the silversmith who made the
case.

I hope this helps.

Cheers, Laurie.

A while ago, someone asked for help removing a stain from a marble
fire-surround. This is lifted (with ackowledgement but not permission)
straight from the January '96 edition of the UK magazine &quot;Homes and
Antiques&quot;.

&quot;Marble is porous and any liquid applied to the surface may push dirt
and stains further in, so avoid using water for cleaning. Rub light
marks with a piece of lemon. Wipe off the juice after a minute or two
and repeat if necessary. Tea and coffee stains are harder to remove, as
are wine and fruit stains, which can damage polished marble. Try
rubbing with a solution of one part hydrogen peroxide to six parts
water with a few drops of household ammonia. Treat grease and oil
stains with lighter fuel or acetone and wipe dry. Minor scratches can
be sprinkled with putty powder (available from hardware stores) and
rubbed vigourously with a dampened chamois. A good all-purpose cleaner
is Bell Marble Cleaner, available by post from A Bell &amp; Co Ltd,
Kingsthorpe Rd, Kingsthorpe, Northampton NN2 6LT (tel. +44 1604
712505), costing 6UKP for 10oz.&quot;

I hope this helps, Laurie.

"/>  Craig's on the money. After you've sanded it down properly, and are
happy the wood is properly finished, give it a single coat of brushing
shellac. There are brand names, BRIWAX do one called Sanding Sealer,
but I expect your local hardware store will do a generic one. Lightly
sand it down, then apply a good coat of high quality wax. Allow it to
dry, then buff up. Apply a second, thin coat of high quality wax, allow
to dry, and buff up to a deep shine.

Cheers, Laurie.
