I have come across the term Garmin Lock, referring to an anti-theft
feature.  It seems that this is either a 4 digit PIN code, or a
predetermined location.  4 digit code has 10,000 possibilities.  How
long would it take for someone to try all of them?  That is, to brute
force their way thru this security code?

I guess one way to get at this is to ask, how long does it take to enter
in 1 code?

Thanks,
Rob

It wouldn't be nice to have to try them all.  There is a delay of about 10
seconds after each failed attempt before you can type anything else.  So,
I'd say 15 seconds to 10000 possibilities = 150000 seconds to guarantee
getting the correct code.

Hmmm.  I better change mine to 9999! :)

Regards,

Martin

After three failed attempt, you need to go to a predefined security place,
so that the GPS unlock itself.

If you do not know where that place is, you need the send it in to Garmin to
get it unlocked.

So 10000 possibilities should be enough.

Note that these schemes don't work and thus have been abandoned in
most cases.  They don't work because the thief steels the device
anyhow, and then either fences it for less money or tosses it when its
found to be locked.  The problem is that almost all devices are going
to be unlocked even if there is a lock feature.

If for some reason you need to protect the data in the device, a lock
makes sense.

On my Blackberry, you have 10 attempts to enter the correct password (from
1 - 14 characters).  On the 11th wrong attempt, the memory with the user
info ( addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addeses etc) are erased from memory.
