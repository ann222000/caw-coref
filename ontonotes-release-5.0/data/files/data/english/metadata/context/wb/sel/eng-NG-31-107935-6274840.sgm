Zeno's Warbird Video Drive-In October 2006 Newsletter

We've got some great World War II plane features playing at Zeno's
Drive-In www.zenoswarbirdvideos.com this month -- including two new
premiers.

Our First Jet Warbird!

We're pleased to announce a new addition to our online stable of
aircraft: the US Navy's North American FJ-2 Fury. The FJ-2 is a very
close relative of the USAF F-86 Sabre -- in most respects they are
identical, The F-86 was adapted for carrier use as a quick fix for the
USN's need for a high performance swept wing fighter during the
Korean war. But, the USN soon developed their own new "Navy" fighter,
so the FJ-2 saw most of its service in the Marine Corps. "Flight
Capabilities of the FJ-2 Airplane" shows the FJ2 in color and to good
advantage. We've also added a number of new downloads from an F-86F
Sabre pilot's manual

Now Playing at the Matinee

* "Winged Artillery" (Color) Nine 75mm canon firing B-25Gs of the 48th
Bomb Squadron, 7AAF, based on Apamama in the Gilbert Islands, conduct a
hair raising tree top level strike on the Japanese air base on Mille.
Also features amazingly well preserved and very rare color footage of
daily life of air crew and ground personnel stationed on the islands.
As a bonus, you'll watch Sea Bees using heavy equipment to transform
these hard won tropical atolls into fully functioning air bases and
ground crews maintaining the Mitchell's massive canons.

* "No Sweat" (Premier!) This film was produced by USAFE, (United States
Air Force, Europe, filmed on location) to cut down on costly air
accidents resulting from pilot error. Seemingly trivial mistakes
sometimes led to SNAFUs -- or worse. You'll follow a pilot through what
should have been a routine hop, but turns into anything but. The real
star of the show is the featured aircraft, an F-86D -- the all weather
version of the Sabre jet-- which is shown in considerable detail.
Notice the radar scope mounted on the instrument panel. I especially
like the pre-CGI aerial shots of a real Sabre slipping through the
cumulus. A beautiful sight!

* "Angel in Overalls" This film was developed to show US Lockheed P-38
production line workers the Lightning at war in a wide variety of
combat roles. The dramatic framing for the piece involves a straggling
B-24 that is saved from certain destruction by the arrival of "Angels
in Overalls" -- P-38s. You'll see all aspects of Lightnings in action,
including air-to-air gun camera, bombing, rocketing and photo recon.
There's a cameo by Air Corps P-38 ace of aces Dick Bong too The
dramatic ending of this film brings home a sobering reminder that the
life of the fighter pilot was risky and often dangerous. Many young
pilots made the ultimate sacrifice

* "Mission to Rabaul" The island of Rabaul, located in the southwest
Pacific, northeast of the large island of New Guinea, was one of two
strategic lynchpins for the Japanese. They poured tens of thousands of
troops, hundreds of airplanes, and thousands of tons of supplies and
material on to Rabaul to make it a mighty fortress. Douglas MacArthur's
brilliant solution to the Rabaul conundrum was to isolate it, slowly
starve it, and bypass it -- rather than assault it. One of the key
steps in this strategy was to seize airfields in northern New Guinea to
base Army P-38 fighters that could escort bombers on long range
missions against the heavily defended Japanese stronghold. By the end
of the War, once mighty Rabaul was cut off and reduced to a virtual
prison for the starving Japanese. "Mission to Rabaul" shows how each
piece of this classic campaign culminated inevitably in the first
escorted, massed bomber strike on October 12th, 1943. The film focuses
on the decisive and revolutionary impact of the air component,
including high &amp; low level attacks, parachute drops, and re-supply.
You'll see amazing on the deck footage from attacking A-20s and B-25s.

If you haven't stopped by Zeno's Drive-In before, we also feature
1940-45 vintage WWII Army &amp; Navy films and pilot's manuals on how to
fly the F4U, F6F, P-38, P-39, P-40, P-47, P-51, P-61, TBF/TBM,
AT-6/SNJ, B-17, B-24, B-25, A-20, A-26, B-26, B-29, and Stearman N2S.
And there are different WWII documentaries every month "At the
Matinee." That's over 14 hours of rockin' props for free viewing over
the internet.

Keep 'em flyin'!
