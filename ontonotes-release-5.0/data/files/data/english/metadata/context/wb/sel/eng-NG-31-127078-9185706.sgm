Housing woes have domino effect

By Kathy Chu with Sharon Silke Carty, Greg Farrell, Barbara Hagenbaugh, Edward Iwata, Noelle Knox and Adam Shell

If you haven't yet felt the impact of the nation's credit crisis, just wait. Chances are, you won't have to wait long.

So far, the turmoil may feel a bit remote for average people: Failed mortgage lenders. Gargantuan write-downs by banks. Foreclosures for people who couldn't really afford the mortgages they got.

STORY: Pain isn't restricted to struggling homeowners

What about the rest of us? Are we in danger? No one knows for sure, but quite likely, yes.

As the credit crisis seeps into farther-flung corners of the economy, more of us will find it harder — and costlier — to borrow money. The value of the funds in our retirement accounts could shrink. People with subpar credit will likely find it more difficult to qualify for auto and home-equity loans. Even consumers who make the cut may need higher credit scores and more documentation.

With loans harder to get, people will hesitate to buy cars, boats and other big-ticket items. The gravest fear? That weak consumer spending — along with surging energy prices, a long housing slump and sluggish job growth — will plunge the economy into a recession.

Even if a recession doesn't occur, &quot;We're going to be in for a rough ride,&quot; says Robert Kuttner, a senior fellow at Demos, a New York policy organization. &quot;With job creation slowing down, credit standards being tightened and housing values not going up anymore, the consumer is under pressure to tighten his or her belt.&quot;

Becki Carr, 28, of Detroit, says she's growing gloomier about the economy. Her reasons: rising home foreclosures in Detroit, rising heating and gasoline prices and a cloud of insecurity over the area's job market. As a result, Carr says, she's watching her money more closely.

&quot;Pretty much everyone around me is unemployed or they are having to travel down South to do contract work,&quot; she says. And &quot;Every other house on our street is for sale, and they've been for sale for the last year and a half. … It makes me double-check my costs and things.&quot;

Tighter credit and falling home prices top the reasons why the economy could slip into a recession, according to 50 economists surveyed in late October and early November by the National Association for Business Economics.

Most economists still don't foresee a recession. But the risk of a downturn is growing with each bout of bleak news. About 18% of economists who responded to NABE's survey put the probability of a recession starting within the next 12 months at 50% or greater. That's up sharply from the 11% of economists who said so in August.

A recession would inflict pain on a majority of Americans as unemployment rose and the stock market sank further. In a recession, &quot;Investors have to be prepared to absorb a 20%-plus decline in the value of their portfolios,&quot; says Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, an investment research firm in Great Neck, N.Y.

The benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index hit an all-time high of 1565.15 on Oct. 9, but since then, it's fallen nearly 8% to 1440.70. The S&amp;P index, which tracks large-company stocks and accounts for about 75% of the market's value, is up 1.6% for the year.

What's managed to help prop up the stock market so far is the sinking dollar, which has nourished companies that depend on foreign sales, says Gregory Peters, chief credit strategist at Morgan Stanley.

Peters says the indicator he's watching most closely, to gauge the likelihood of further economic deterioration, is the labor market. Job growth has clearly slowed but has still held up &quot;reasonably well,&quot; he says. U.S. employers created an average 118,000 jobs in the three months through October, down from 142,000 during the first three months of 2007, the Labor Department says. The jobless rate last month was 4.7%, up slightly from the recent low of 4.5% in June but far below the 6.3% of June 2003.

Still, what began as a housing industry downturn more than a year ago has widened into a broader financial industry crisis. Too many risky mortgages were made to people who eventually couldn't afford their payments. Many such mortgages were bundled into securities that were sold to investors who were often unaware of the risk they were absorbing.

Every week, more bad news

The initial low rates on adjustable-rate mortgages are resetting to higher rates. And with housing prices in many markets falling, overextended buyers can't refinance. Delinquencies and foreclosures are rising. Banks and other investors holding downgraded securities tied to risky mortgages are writing down their values billions of dollars at a time.

Each week brings fresh evidence of how the credit crisis is causing damage. Last week, for example, the stock market fell after Goldman Sachs downgraded the nation's largest bank, Citigroup, to a sell. Goldman said the bank would likely have to write down $15 billion over the next two quarters, mainly because of its exposure to risky mortgage securities.

And darker days probably lie ahead: Mortgage-related losses industrywide are likely to mount through 2009 and further bruise financial institutions, says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com.

Such losses eat away at banks' capital reserves. That means they can't lend as much money. Goldman Sachs analysts predict that, overall, banks' exposure to risky mortgages could reduce the credit available to consumers and businesses by a staggering $2 trillion.

Even the $2.5 trillion muni bond market hasn't escaped the credit crunch's damage. Muni bonds are issued by cities and states to raise money for projects such as schools, highways and airports. Historically, they've been relatively safe investments because it's rare that governments default on their debts.

But worries about the companies that insure hundreds of billions of dollars in muni bonds are rippling through to muni bonds and rattling investors. The insurers, which have exposure to risky mortgages, could see their credit ratings reduced. If that happened, the muni bonds they guarantee would be downgraded, too. Cities and states would find it harder to raise money. Projects would be delayed. Taxpayers could face higher taxes.

Miami-Dade County and Puerto Rico have postponed bond issues totaling $1.5 billion in recent weeks because of credit concerns.

In the housing market, tightening credit has shrunk the pool of potential buyers for homeowners such as Glynnis Fairbanks, who wants to sell her four-bedroom home in Broward County, Fla.

Fairbanks had a deal to sell her home in May; she thought the sale would be finished by August. But the buyers, she says, had to back out because their lender, Countrywide, tightened its standards on their subprime loan. She's cut her price to $325,000 from $348,000. But only one other potential buyer has peeked at the house.

By the end of 2008, more than 1 million homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages will see their rates reset higher. Meantime, many people who want to refinance can't because they lack the credit scores or the home equity to meet lenders' tighter standards. This is especially true in neighborhoods where prices are falling. Some people who bought homes with little or no down payment now owe more than their homes are worth.

Investors, too, have been unnerved by the turmoil. Take Doug Breitenbach, 63, who pared back on his investments in financial services this month because of banks' exposure to risky loans.

Since June, &quot;I have lost on paper about $18,000 in my 401(k) fund,&quot; says Breitenbach, a retiree in Silver Spring, Md. Though his portfolio is still up for the year, &quot;I'm quite concerned about future drops.&quot;

As mortgage-related distress spooks the markets, lenders are becoming &quot;more sensitive&quot; to the risks of other loans, says James Chessen, chief economist of the American Bankers Association. Banks may require higher credit scores now to qualify for loans, he notes.

At the moment, though, many businesses say the credit crunch still feels a little remote. In an October survey of small-business owners, only 6% said loans had become harder to get, in line with survey results over the past two years, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Only 3% said credit availability and interest rates were their top concerns.

A Federal Reserve survey last month showed little change in banks' lending standards for small businesses. But the same survey also detected a more ominous sign: On most consumer loans, 14 of the 50 banks surveyed had tightened their standards by October. That was up sharply from six out of 50 banks in July. Banks are starting to do the same with credit cards.

Gary Perlin, Capital One's chief financial officer, said at an analysts' conference this month that the company has become more selective about granting credit cards and auto loans. And JPMorgan Chase says it's being more careful about issuing home-equity credit lines and auto loans, mainly for consumers with poor credit.

&quot;When there's less credit extended,&quot; says Jack Malvey, chief global fixed-income strategist at Lehman Bros., &quot;it reduces world economic growth and puts the U.S. at risk of recession. The real damage of that could be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars and, depending on what happens to the world economy, it could be $1 trillion.&quot;

Discover Financial has jacked up the rate it charges to risky new credit card customers and has raised late fees for all customers. Some banks are likely to consider raising fees or rates on credit cards — one of their most profitable products — because they're under &quot;that much more pressure&quot; in an uncertain economy to recoup mortgage losses, says Edward Woods, senior analyst at Celent, a market research firm.

That means that even those with pristine credit aren't likely to escape the spreading credit crisis. Curtis Arnold, founder of

Given this much warning,  it would seem to me that any working class
person who stayed in the stock market deserves a kick in the crotch.

Instead of small investors holding the sack while the rich escape a
market Crash,  why not do it differently for a change -- and get out
first ?

The safest place for retirement accounts is in CDs and Savings bonds
and.  If you have more that $100,000 per couple --  spread it around
different banks.   If you have a  million,  you need 10 banks.   It
may be a little  trouble but it beats losing 20%.  Or MORE !

There was a guy on TV yesterday who says that he expects another round
of big selling to occur as soon as the 401K investors get their
November statements. In the meantime, though, I'm guessing that there
will probably be a short term rally.

It's interesting to note that after 7 years of borrowing and spending,
both on the part of the government and the individual consumer, the
S&amp;P 500 is currently at about the same place it was when Bush took
office.

&gt; At the moment, though, many businesses say the credit crunch still feels a little remote. In an October survey of small-business owners, only 6% said loans had become harder to get, in line with survey results over the past two years, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Only 3% said credit availability and interest rates were their top concerns.

&gt; A Federal Reserve survey last month showed little change in banks' lending standards for small businesses. But the same survey also detected a more ominous sign: On most consumer loans, 14 of the 50 banks surveyed had tightened their standards by October. That was up sharply from six out of 50 banks in July. Banks are starting to do the same with credit cards.

&gt; Gary Perlin, Capital One's chief financial officer, said at an analysts' conference this month that the company has become more selective about granting credit cards and auto loans. And JPMorgan Chase says it's being more careful about issuing home-equity credit lines and auto loans, mainly for consumers with poor credit.

&gt; &quot;When there's less credit extended,&quot; says Jack Malvey, chief global fixed-income strategist at Lehman Bros., &quot;it reduces world economic growth and puts the U.S. at risk of recession. The real damage of that could be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars and,

&gt;&gt;Housing woes have domino effect

Everybody tries to make the stock market this big mystery thing that only
the insiders can conquer. It's not. It's very, very simple. All it takes is
a bit of patience and enough sense to watch buy and sell volumes. If a stock
goes up on a volume that is 4 or 5 times the average daily volume that means
some pretty smart people have investigated that stock and are accumulating
it and you probably should too. If a stock goes down on a volume that is 4
or 5 times the average daily volume, it means you should probably join the
crowd. Otherwise, you should just buy blue chips, with good dividend
records, and plan on holding them for about 30 to 40 years. All these
formulas, schemes, gimmicks, etc. are just scams to get money from the idiot
class.

If you're going to do the short term bit based on volume, have your gain %
set before hand and have your loss percentage set before hand and STICK TO
IT. When you hit your gain %, sell it, take the money and run even if you
leave money on the table. Greed kills. When you hit your loss %, sell it,
take your lumps and move on. It's just like the sales game, you have to get
the no's out of the way in order to get to the yes's. You're going to have
some losers. The key is to cut those loses and cash those gains.

My gain is 5% and my loss is 7% and they are carved in stone.
