I received a recorded call from DTE Energy advertising the Visa -
Superbowl promotion that is also being aired on the radio. I'm on the
Do Not Call List but figured that DTE was using the &quot;established
business relationship&quot; loop hole to get around it. (That loop hole
however, stipulates such an exclusion does not apply to people who ask
to be put on the company's own internal do not call list.) When I
called customer service about it they did not believe me, and said they
had never heard of this and that DTE does not do any kind of outgoing
marketing calls. So I played her the message from my answering
machine. She and her supervisor said that she had never heard of this
before and said that they would let the marketing department know that
I wanted my name removed from the list. I asked to receive a written
notice that this action had been taken and asked where a person could
register their privacy preferences ahead of time. I was told that
there was no way to do either. This is insane. Anyone else complain
to them about it? I've contacted my state rep's office (MI) about this
issue to ask if there are any regulations regarding this. I'll post any
replies I get later.

"/> There is a *federal* do-not-call list, the violation of which is subject
to *federal* penalties, enforced by the FCC. The provisions of this law
are contained in 47CFR64.1200 (the Code of Federal Regulations).

So if you have recorded *proof* that you received a telephone call in
violation of the *federal* do-not-call list, which I assume you were on
before this violation, then you should send this proof in a complaint
filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The ball will then
be in the court of the alleged violator. Without your proof, however, your
complaint will go nowhere, since the one who called you will deny that it
ever happened.

You are wasting your time to pursue this with any governmental agency
*other* than the FCC. HOWEVER, this law also contains a provision which
permits you (if your particular state allows it) to file a claim for $500
in damages in a *state* court (typically a Small Claims Court). Here
again, your recorded proof is crucial evidence if you are to win such a
suit.

If you are willing to fight the fight, then do a Google search for that
law which I presented above. It will come right up and you can read
it--assuming, of course, that you know how to read. Few people without
some legal background have the ability to read and understand a law (this
law is fairly complex). Perhaps you are an exception. If not, you are
hardly alone.

And according to DTE customer service they have no such list. And due
to the nature of their product - electricity - I cannot choose to take
my business elsewhere if I don't like their intrusions. This is the
first time that I know of that they have done this kind of marketing.
If it isn't limited I can see them 'partnering' with all kinds of other
companies and using their apparent immunity from anti-telemarketing
legislation to return the level of phone harrassment to the
pre-do-not-call-list days.

&gt; The problem is that the recording is likely to be inadmissible in
&gt; court.

"/> Not necessarily, depending upon the particular circumstances. In
California (if not in most states), Small Claims Court is not a *real*
court (due both to the fact that the plaintiff has no right of appeal if
he/she loses the case, and to the fact that the proceedings are not
recorded, so there is no legal precedent established in a small-claims
case). Rather, a small-claims case is merely an informal hearing in which
the judge decides the issues on a common-sense basis, without the &quot;law
getting in the way,&quot; as it were. That is, the judge can decide the case
against the &quot;wisdom&quot; written into law, particularly if disregarding the
law *works in favor of the defendant*.

Due to the fact that such a &quot;court&quot; is not a real court, the judge can
well decide the case based upon recorded evidence, if he/she believes that
the evidence was not tampered with. This is indeed a judgment call, and
many small-claims judges are capable of ferreting out the truth, based
upon a face-to-face encounter with the plaintiff and defendant; i.e.,
without lawyers available to muddy the waters.

I should also point out that, in a very unusual recent case which I
pursued against a telemarketer in Small Claims Court in San Diego, the
telemarketer *gave me his permission to record our conversation*(!), which
I did, using my answering machine two-way-conversation recording setup. I
took this recording to court to use in my case, and the judge did not
question the &quot;legitimacy&quot; of my recording.

This being said, I believe that, even though I might have recorded this
conversation without the permission of the other party (of course, he
could have declined to continue when alerted by the obligatory beeps about
ten seconds apart), the judge would have accepted this &quot;evidence&quot; at face
value. It was a clear admission of exactly what had happened, presented by
the defendant in this case.

"/> True. The federal law permits telemarketing calls to those with whom the
caller has an established business relationship. Therefore, being on the
federal do-not-call list does *not* expose the caller to a legal penalty,
unless the called party has previously requested that he/she be placed on
the telemarketer's do-not-call list.

FCC regulations 47CFR64.1200 (which spells out the enforcement of what is

spells this out, in section 5.2.

This reads as follows:

No person or entity shall initiate any telephone solicitation to a
residential telephone subscriber unless such person or entity has
instituted procedures for telephone solicitations made by or on behalf of
that person or entity. The procedures instituted must meet the following
minimum standards:

(the regulation then goes on to spell out what has to be done by callers
to maintain their do-not-call lists).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply stated: If the company which called you refuses to maintain an
internal do-not-call list, then it is in violation of this federal
regulation and is subject to legal penalty. This company has apparently
admitted openly that they do *not* maintain such a list, and that they
called you because they were permitted to do so by virtue of their
established business relationship with you.

Therefore, *they are in violation of the federal regulations cited above*
and you are justified in filing a complaint with the FCC *and/or* filing a
claim in Small Claims Court for $500 in damages, for such violation.
Remember, however, that the burden will be upon you to provide proof that
this company both refuses to maintain a do-not-call list and indeed made
the call to which you refer.

READ THAT FEDERAL REGULATION!!

to being on the Federal do-not-call list), and sue those that refuse
to put me on the do-not-call list. Suppose, for the moment, that
I'm in an either-party state and I record the call. Do I have to
wait for them to call before suing in order to win? Do I have to
prove that they have ever made an outgoing call (to anyone)? Do I
have to prove that they have ever made a solicitation call (to
anyone)? I suspect some people might manage to make a good living
out of doing this.

here is a helpful page for the FTC do not call list:

https://www.donotcall.gov/FAQ/FAQBusiness.aspx

if you back out to  http://www.donotcall.gov  you will find
everything you need to know about the list and the law.
There is even an on-line complaint form. And the excepted
groups get one free call, then ask to be put on &quot;your do not
call list&quot;. Document the date, time, number called, and
company name, caller-id (as much as possible- and you can
ask the caller, not responding is in itself a violation) and
that you requested to be put on their dnc list. next time
they call, get same documentation, and with your first call
info, file a complaint. In most states you can use this
info to file in small claims court for $400-$500 for wasting
your time. Collecting your judgment depends on conditions.
Filing on the ftc site will not get you any money, but ftc
will follow up if they see the same violator popping up.
The ftc has fined many groups for violation of the dnc list
and the starting point is only $11,000 PER violation.

the fcc does have laws they enforce, but they are for calls
to cell phone numbers, and fax machines. and they also have
an online complaint form. look at &quot;hot topics&quot; top right
corner here:

http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/

They can even help you get money back from communications
utilities.

Both of these programs really do work, but you have to
follow the rules, and take action against those that abuse
your freedom from these folks.

I file about two complaints a month for dnc and cellphone
violations. I finally dumped the fax machine, so I haven't
needed that form lately ;-)

from  https://www.donotcall.gov/FAQ/FAQBusiness.aspx

One caveat: if a consumer asks a company not to call, the company may
not call, even if there is an established business relationship.
Indeed, a company may not call a consumer - regardless of whether the
consumer's number is on the registry - if the consumer has asked to be
put on the company's own do not call list.

Yesterday: They said they would contact the marketing dept. and stop
them but there was no do not call list she said. Could I receive
formal notice that this had been done? No. &quot;You will know it was done
when you don't receive any more calls&quot;. Priceless.

Today: I got a call back from one of the reps on my machine telling me
that there was no way to take me off of the marketing list because of
the &quot;established business .....&quot;

Believe me, I tried to talk to someone else, maybe someone from the
legal dept. or the marketing dept. but one of their strictest rules
must be to prevent a customer from being able to contact anyone else.
They are human moats.

"/> They don't know the rules, and the ftc will be happy to help
them out.

File a complaint with ftc that they do not have a &quot;do not
call list&quot;. The ftc wants to know about these companies.
If they do telemarketing or have someone else do it for
them, they must comply with the law. You might be
contributing to the income side of the federal budget.
There have been several half million dollar fines for
companies that had total disregard for the dnc list.

In the past year and a half, I have not had a telemarketer
not immediately acknowledge they had a do not call list, and
would add my number, and even ask if I had other numbers
that needed to be added. The word is getting out, they
don't just laugh and hang up anymore.

&gt;&gt;No, they are *not* immune from anti-telemarketing legislation.

&gt;&gt;FCC regulations 47CFR64.1200 (which spells out the enforcement of what is
&gt;&gt;also referred to as the &quot;telephone consumer protection act&quot;) clearly
&gt;&gt;spells this out, in section 5.2.

&gt;&gt;This reads as follows:

&gt;&gt;No person or entity shall initiate any telephone solicitation to a
&gt;&gt;residential telephone subscriber unless such person or entity has
&gt;&gt;instituted procedures for telephone solicitations made by or on behalf of
&gt;&gt;that person or entity. The procedures instituted must meet the following
&gt;&gt;minimum standards:

&gt;&gt;(the regulation then goes on to spell out what has to be done by callers
&gt;&gt;to maintain their do-not-call lists).
&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;Simply stated: If the company which called you refuses to maintain an
&gt;&gt;internal do-not-call list, then it is in violation of this federal
&gt;&gt;regulation and is subject to legal penalty. This company has apparently
&gt;&gt;admitted openly that they do *not* maintain such a list, and that they
&gt;&gt;called you because they were permitted to do so by virtue of their
&gt;&gt;established business relationship with you.

&gt;&gt;Therefore, *they are in violation of the federal regulations cited above*
&gt;&gt;and you are justified in filing a complaint with the FCC *and/or* filing a
&gt;&gt;claim in Small Claims Court for $500 in damages, for such violation.
&gt;&gt;Remember, however, that the burden will be upon you to provide proof that
&gt;&gt;this company both refuses to maintain a do-not-call list and indeed made
&gt;&gt;the call to which you refer.

&gt; Are they in violation if they refuse to put you on their do-not-call
&gt; list, in and of itself?

"/> No. They are in violation only if they make a telemarketing call while at
the same time refusing to maintain a do-not-call list.

For example, let's suppose I make pre-emptive

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; requests to everyone in the (national) Yellow Pages (in addition
&gt; to being on the Federal do-not-call list), and sue those that refuse
&gt; to put me on the do-not-call list.

"/> It is my understanding that:

(1) You may only request *preemptively* to be placed on the do-not-call
list of a business with whom you have an established relationship.

(2) You may request, *after the fact*, to be placed on the do-not-call list
of a business, whether or not you have an established relationship
with that business.

"/> It is the FCC (Federal Communications Commission), not the FTC (Federal
Trade Commission), which is responsible for enforcing the telemarketing
laws. The FTC only keeps the federal do-not-call registry, which is not an
enforcement task.

Also, in case you missed it, if a company with whom you have an
established business relationship calls you and *if they to not have a
do-not-call list, and if you have proof of this fact, then you are
entitled (in most states) to go to court in your state and file a claim
against this business for $500.

This is written into 47CFR64.1200, the federal enforcement regulation. You
are entitled to go to court *and/or* file a complaint with the FCC for
this violation of the law.

I've reported several home-repair telemarketers who were foolish enough to
give me a name, although I guess they could have lied about that. Do the feds
actually go after these jerks, or should I buy more ammunition?

We are going to find out, at least in one case of considerable
significance, involving a major insurance company hiding under the
coattails of my banker, Wells Fargo.

Two months ago, I filed a very comprhensive complaint, including recorded
*proof* (with his permission, no less!) by the defendant outlining exactly
what occurred, in detail. The recording was a two-way conversation set up
using my telephone answering machine, complete with the state-required
intervallic beeps, etc. I sent this comprehensive package to the FCC by
certified USPS priority mail.

Yesterday (two months later!), I got a form letter which acknowledged
receipt of my complaint from the appropriate department within the FCC,
promising that this case was going to be investigated thoroughly, and
giving me a reference number for future inquiry. Perhaps this was all for
&quot;show&quot; purposes. But then again, perhaps it was not. We shall see what we
shall see, but who knows how long this might take?
