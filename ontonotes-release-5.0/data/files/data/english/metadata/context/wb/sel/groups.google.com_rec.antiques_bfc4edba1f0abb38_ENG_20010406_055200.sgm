First, know that nearly all the originals were plated over brass. Plain
polished brass finishes are usually fakes. The true antiques typically
have worn silver color plating with brass showing through. Stanley isn't
the only maker of fakes (I can't call them reproductions, since they
don't make any effort to duplicate finishes or much else, other than the
basic design). When a dealer has a number of pieces of brass
navigational gear with the same maker name, it should raise high
suspicions that they are not old.

There is one thing that might settle the issue by demonstrating
conclusively that they are fakes. Original instruments had the maker
marks stamped. Most of the fakes are made in India and elsewhere, by
small shops that do not have quality stamps. Instead, they peck out the
letters with a punch. Under a glass, you can clearly see that the
letters are formed out of a series of dots, rather than a single
impression of a letter stamp. Pecked out letters are clearly imported
fakes, whatever the maker name. Stamped letters don't prove anything,
though.

Also, the printing on the compass rose will not be crisp and even.
Original printed faces are perfectly crisp.

The most commonly faked are Brunton compasses, the heavy brass ones you
see Stanley sell. The usual story from the less savory dealers is that a
cache of British military instruments was &quot;discovered&quot; in India, which
is supposed to explain why there are so many in perfect condition. Other
dealers will say, when asked, that they don't know. They lie. They
bought them in lots, and they know exactly what they are.

That one's getting old, and it's necessary to age them to pass them off
as antiques to even naive buyers. There are too many legitimate sellers
and catalogs of curio reproductions out there now, and too many people
have seen them.

The compass/sundials, either wood boxed or with a round brass cover are
heavily faked. They're often claimed to be &quot;like that used by Lewis and
Clark&quot;. Others are claimed as 19th century examples.

Check the stampings under a strong magnifier first.

another thing to check would be the patination. Alot of companies out
of india/china are building them and placing chemicals on the metal to
make them look tarnished and such. Upon close examination you can
sometimes see the brush strokes.

Hi Tom,

As usual, Gerald has given top-flight advice &amp; information. As a clincher,
Mark Chervenka in his Guide to Fakes &amp; Reproductions book (a selection of
articles reprinted from his Antiques &amp; Collectibles Reproduction News)
states that the West name is one frequently found on reproduction sun dials
currently being imported from India.

Just try to be glad you don't have much invested in the piece &amp; enjoy it for
what it is.....an attractive decorator piece.

&gt; On a recent antique outing, my wonderful lady friend purchased me a
&gt; beautiful brass combination compass/sundial.

&gt; To learn more about it, I have scoured the 'net, and all I could find was
a
&gt; company called &quot;Stanley of London&quot; (of California, ironically) which
&gt; manufactures a &quot;replica&quot; of the same piece, exactly (picture attached).

&gt; However, ours is clearly worn, much older than a &quot;replica.&quot;

&gt; It's stamped &quot;WEST London&quot; where the &quot;Stanley London&quot; logo appears on the
&gt; replica, without any date, or other markings.

&gt; And it cost SIGNIFICANTLY less than the Stanley &quot;replica.&quot;

&gt; This same dealer had several other &quot;WEST London&quot; brass nautical antiques,
&gt; yet the Stanley site advertises &quot;replicas&quot; of the same pieces, for much
MORE
&gt; money.

&gt; Is this a naive dealer? Did &quot;WEST London&quot; actually create these
instruments?
&gt; If Stanley is creating &quot;replicas,&quot; can we assume the originals are of
value?
&gt; Are there any resources on the 'net?

&gt; Any info/advice/guidance would be appreciated.

The information I received here was tremendous. I also received an e-mail
from a reader of this newsgroup who told me to check to see if the logo was
etched (the sign of a fake), or stamped (the original).

As an engineer (but not an antique expert &lt;grin&gt;), I'm certain it is not
etched (it is stamped), and I'm fairly certain there is no chemical patina,
at least none that is crude.

However, I think my original intent has been lost here, I'm sure because I
was not clear.

I'm not so curious about the value. Several of the readers of this group
have written that they've sold &quot;the real thing&quot; for so little that this
seems like even more of a bargain - Hardly worth haggling over.

More, I'm intrigued by the company.

&quot;West London&quot; seems to have made instruments that have been mimicked all
over the globe, and people are selling those &quot;fakes&quot; all over, including on
eBay, where many even admit their fakes say &quot;Stanley London&quot; rather than
&quot;West London.&quot;

Rather than worrying about whether we bought a &quot;fake&quot; for $42, or an
&quot;authentic&quot; for $90 (as one writer claims), or another &quot;authentic&quot; for
$5,000 as another wrote, I'm more interested in learning some history.

What is &quot;West London?&quot; A maker of navigational instruments, I assume, in
London?

I can't find anything about the company after several cursory searches on
the Internet.

When did &quot;West London&quot; exist? When did they go away? Do they exist? Why do
so many create forgeries?

It's a piece that has me curious, and as a history buff more than a value
buff, I'd love to learn more.

I'm hoping someone can point me to some West London reference material.

Again, thank you kindly, to all.

In case this hasn't already been posted, here's a helpful website on
antique scientific instruments that includes information on fakes,
forgeries, and replicas:
