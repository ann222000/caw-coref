IOL, 13 August 2007

Twenty-three Vodacom employees were suspended on Monday, in a sequel to a month-long strike, the Communication Workers Union (CWU) said.

The employees were a part of a strike in July and August, in which the CWU demanded recognition from Vodacom.

They were also arrested two weeks ago for going against an interdict preventing picketers from entering, interfering or obstructing access to Vodacom premises.

They were later released on bail, and were then suspended a week later.

CWU spokesperson Mfanafuthi Sithebe said: &quot;These loyal and disciplined members did not engage in any misconduct during the strike action, except to be told that they have crossed the agreed upon picketing line.

&quot;During the strike action our members were complaining about the behaviour of the Vodacom security personnel and the risk management services, but our complaints were not attended to by the intransigent and myopic management.&quot;

Sithebe said Vodacom's actions went against the spirit of an agreement reached with the union.

Both parties had agreed that at present, less than 15 percent of Vodacom employees belonged to the CWU, and the company needed 30 percent of their employees to belong to the union for it to be recognised.

Vodacom spokesperson Dot Field said that the company had a zero tolerance policy.

&quot;A number of employees were suspended on full pay, while disciplinary hearings were concluded.&quot;

She said the public prosecutor had issued a warrant of arrest for individuals who contravened the court order during the recent strike. - Sapa

Mineweb, 13 Aug 2007

Fire will be fought with fire, it will be crossfire, and venom with similar venom, the NUM warns gold employers as talks gets into high gear at the CCMA tomorrow.

The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is aware of the venom uttered by the Chamber of Mines representing gold employers in saying that &quot;gold employers will have to be very hard-pushed to give a double-digit offer&quot;.

The NUM would like to assure gold employers that they will get more than the &quot;hard-push&quot; from its members if their intransigence persists. The NUM's commitment to a negotiated settlement remain unquestionable. We are however very well prepared to call our members to the battle front if the situation warrants it.

&quot;For sometime we have been overwhelmed by statements like &quot;negotiators interrupts you when you speak&quot;, &quot;Smiles wont last long if unions get what they want&quot; and any similar kind of venom from the Chamber 's gold negotiators and we call on them not to test our patience&quot; says Frans Baleni, the NUM 's General Secretary.

&quot;We are pleased with progress made with other employers and hope that the Chamber representing gold employers Harmony Gold, Anglogold Ashanti and Goldfields will not instigate what they already show. We need no arrogance but bread and butter for our members&quot; argues Baleni.

Gold employers and the NUM will tomorrow meet under the auspices of a CCMA mediator. &quot;We are optimistic of a settlement and hope we will not be disappointed from the venom we get&quot; he said.

&lt; http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=&amp;fArticleId;=5019479 &gt; 1.3 Coal mine strike continues

Business Report, 13 August 2007

About 3 500 mine workers will continue their strike over low salaries on Tuesday, trade union Solidarity said.

Spokesman Reint Dykema said Solidarity members started striking at coal mines around the country on Monday over an inadequate pay offer, particularly for artisans.

He said that production had been disrupted at some of the mines.

&quot;The workers have united and approximately 3500 workers have come out on strike. The two large producers Anglo Coal and Exxaro are particularly hard hit,&quot; said Dykema.

The mines were in the Mpumalanga and Gauteng area.

However Chamber of Mines negotiator Eric Nwedo said production at all mines was continuing on Monday.

Dykema said members were unhappy with the lower categories of workers being offered a ten percent increase and artisans eight percent.

He said the strike sent a clear message to the Chamber of Mines that artisans, miners and officials were dissatisfied with the offer.

Solidarity is demanding a 10 percent increase for miners, artisans and officials for this year and for next year.

The Chamber is offering an increase of between 7.5 and 8.5 percent.

Dykema said the strike would affect the industry negatively as coalmines planned to increase exports through the Richards Bay terminal from 71 million tonnes to 90 million tonnes by 2009.

He said Eskom would also need additional coal supplies for its planned expansions, aimed at significantly increasing its capacity.

&quot;The production losses caused by this strike will be minimal compared to the losses facing coal mines if they should lose their skilled workers,&quot; he said.

He said urgent steps needed to be taken to improve remuneration and to train new artisans as result of a skills shortage in the industry.

Chamber of Mines spokesman Jabu Maphalala said it was too early to quantify the impact of the strike on mine production.

&quot;It's very early days. This is the first day. The shift and the workload hasn't gone a full cycle as yet, so we cannot say for sure what the impact is,&quot; he said.

Chamber negotiator Nwedo added that production at all mines was continuing but that contingency plans were in place to minimise the impact of the strike.

&quot;The steps taken, as well as the level of strike participation has resulted in a fairly small impact on productivity,&quot; he said.

Nwedo said the majority union-- the National Union of Mineworkers - had recommended the offer to it members and it was &quot;unfortunate&quot; that Solidarity had embarked on strike action.

&quot;The employers are convinced that they have tabled a fair packaged offer to the unions,&quot; he said, adding that the offer took into account the workers' demands, the long term viability of the industry and the specific circumstances of each company.

Dykema said no formal talks had been arranged with the Chamber to find a solution.

Eskom was not immediately available for comment. - Sapa

Namhla Tshisela, Sowetan, 14 August 2007

NUM signs Chamber wage deal

The first day of a strike by members of the Solidarity trade union had not destabilised mining operations, the Chamber of Mines said yesterday.

Chamber spokesman, Jabu Maphalala, said the strike had had &quot;little effect&quot; on coal production.

&quot;There were different levels of participation at different mines, but production at all mines is continuing,&quot; said Maphalala.

About 3500 Solidarity members downed tools yesterday in protest against low salaries for skilled workers.

The workers are demanding a 10 percent increase for artisans, who include technical staff such as boilermakers and electricians.

The chamber has offered a 10 percent increase for its lowest-paid workers and an increase of between 7,5 percent and 8,5 percent for skilled workers.

The National Union of Mineworkers, which represents the majority of mine workers, accepted the offer and did not participate in the strike.

Only Solidarity members have not signed the offer.

NUM spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said its members were satisfied with the increases.

Solidarity spokesman Jaco Kleynhans said poor pay for artisans was the main reason for skills shortages in the mining sector.

&quot;Where skilled workers receive bad salaries, they move to other industries,&quot; he warned.

&quot;Artisans normally earn between R9 300 and R9 600. A 10 percent hike would increase their salaries to between R10 230 and R10 560,&quot; said Kleynhans.

He said the union's demand was justified because of the &quot;huge growth&quot; in profits and production in the industry.

&quot;The coal mining industry can afford a 10 percent hike.&quot;

The Chamber of Mines' offer also includes improved housing allowances, family responsibility leave, sick leave and medical aid benefits.

&lt; http://www.sabcnews.com/economy/labour/0,2172,154045,00.html &gt; 1.5 Poor salaries contribute to skills shortages: union

Frank Nxumalo, SABC, 14 August 2007

Trade union Solidarity who downed tools at coal mines owned by Anglo Coal and Exxaro last night says poor salaries were contributing to skills shortages in the country as this resulted in companies failing to retain skilled staff.

The union says low levels of wage increases for artisans over the past few years did not reflect the high demand for these skilled workers.

Most companies have made very good profits for at least the past five years, and shareholders, directors and top management have shared abundantly in the increase in wealth,&quot; Reint Dykema, the spokesperson for Solidarity said.

&quot;In the majority of cases the best the workers could manage have been cost of living increases. We cannot allow our scarce artisans to be lured away to rich countries if we can afford to keep them here,&quot; he said.

Skills crisis

Dykema said the skills crisis was a worldwide phenomenon triggered by dramatic growth in the global economy. &quot;We need our artisans (to remain) here to build our economy, to develop our country, to alleviate poverty and unemployment and to create a better life for all, we need those who have left - more than a million in the past decade - to come back and help us to create jobs,&quot; he said.

&quot;Better pay will go a long way to convincing them to return. Let us remember that capital markets are not the only ones to have globalised. Let us remember that the whole labour market has globalised, and companies must compete for artisans with rivals in Australia, Britain and the Middle East,&quot; said Dykema.

Solidarity has revised its wage demand to 10 % from 15 % and has rejected the Chamber of Mine's final offer of 8%. The union is unhappy that the Chamber of offered 10 % to unskilled workers.

IOL, 13 August 2007

About 600 members of the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) downed tools on Monday at Hi Tech Automotive near Port Elizabeth to demand union recognition.

Spokesperson Mziwakhe Hlangani said the company had refused to recognise Numsa as a representative union and subsequently rejected going into negotiations.

&quot;Workers are currently engaged in protest demonstrations in the front gates of the car plant near St Alban's prison, outside Port Elizabeth,&quot; he said.

The company was expected to issue a statement later in the day. - Sapa

&lt; http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article.php?a_id=114531 &gt; 1.7 Numsa announces strike at Hi-tech Automotive

&lt; http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/author.php?u_id=148 &gt; Olivia Spadavecchia, Engineering News, 13 August 2007

Workers at car manufacturer Hi-Tech Automotive, in the Eastern Cape, embarked on a strike on Monday, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) said.

The union explained that the workers were demanding a guaranteed annual bonus as a thirteenth cheque, and a reduction in working hours, without loss of earnings, from the current 44 hours to 40 hours a week. The union and its members are of the view that the current excessive overtime is unbearable for workers.

Workers are also demanding equal pay for equal work saying that the company had not standardised the increases given to workers.

Numsa has accused the company of exploiting its workers and of being anti the union and its members. In a statement it said that Hi-Tech Automotive had rejected union recognition for the past eight years.

Numsa raised further grievances regarding disparities between what workers at Hi-Tech Automotive and other workers in the automotive industry earned. It also raised concerns about health and safety conditions and the close proximity of the plant to the St Albans prison.

&lt; http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click;_id=594&amp;art;_id=nw2007081... &gt; 1.8 Rubber strike on brink of settlement: Numsa

IOL, 13 August 2007

The three-week old strike in the tyre and rubber manufacturing sector may end on Tuesday, the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) said.

Union spokesperson Mziwakhe Hlangani said on Monday that a final settlement was expected with the Port Elizabeth-based company, Goodyear.

The agreement hinged on the company releasing its final plan on how it intended to phase out 150 labour brokers on Wednesday.

&quot;The company has in turn agreed to absorb about 100 contract workers into its permanent staff complement, out of the total of 250 employees hired under labour brokerages.&quot;

According to Numsa, the Employers' New Tyre Industry Association was offering wage increases ranging from 8,5 percent for the lowest paid workers, eight percent across-the-board and 7,5 percent for those earning above the maximum grade levels.

&quot;Talks continued in the midst of divisions within the industry with some employers expressing willingness to up their offer, others claiming that they contributed highly competitive and unequalled provident fund contributions.&quot;

In July, almost 6 000 Numsa members at major tyre manufacturing plants, including Goodyear, Continental, Firestone, Dunlop and Bridgestone, downed tools to demand a ten percent wage increases, the union said. - Sapa

&lt; http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click;_id=594&amp;art;_id=vn2007081... &gt; 1.9 TUT chaos as cops fire teargas

Xolani Mbanjwa, Pretoria News, 14 August 2007

Pandemonium broke out during a march at the Tshwane University of Technology on Monday as police fired teargas canisters to disperse students who joined the strike by about 800 lecturers and academics.

The students - most of whom are members of the Pan Africanist Student Movement of Azania (Pasmo) - pledged their &quot;absolute and unconditional support&quot; to the striking workers who have been told by TUT management that the institution would apply a &quot;no work, no pay&quot; policy during their strike.

Early on Monday morning students demanded a meeting with management to force it to end the strike which began last week &quot;as early as possible&quot;, Pasmo national president Mametlwe Sebe said.

Police formed a ring of steel around the main campus's administration block where strikers had gathered to march.

The protest follows last week's SA Students Congress (Sasco) march in which students demanded an end to the ongoing strike which has halted classes as lecturers and academics downed tools.

Sebe said: &quot;We want management to accede to the demands of the unions because this is affecting students.

&quot;If management says it will enforce the policy of 'no work, no pay' then students should be reimbursed their tuition fees as well because we paid to get educated. Many student organisations have rallied behind workers and want to go back to their classes.&quot;

Students at TUT's campuses in Ga-Rankuwa, Witbank, Soshanguve, Polokwane and Nelspruit also staged protests and in some cases burned tyres.

On Tuesday students will be bused in from other campuses to the main campus to lend support to the strike.

While the National, Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) and the National Union of Technikon Employees of SA (Nutesa) have already agreed to a 7,45 percent wage increase with TUT management, the current impasse is over management's reluctance to remove certain conditions before it implements the agreement.

Nehawu's secretary-general at TUT Gugulethu Xaba said that after a six-hour meeting yesterday management agreed not to move staff from the current salary grading system.

&quot;We thought we were making inroads when management agreed not to move staff to another salary grading system or one that would lead to a drop in their salaries.

&quot;But then management said it could not pay the once-off payments required for 104 workers who are not being paid similar salaries to others although they are on the same salary scale.&quot;

&lt; http://www.sowetan.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=539105 &gt; 1.10 TUT strike talks

Sowetan, 14 August 2007

Talks intended to resolve a strike at the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) made good progress yesterday, the TUT said.

Spokesman Willa de Ruyter said the TUT, the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union, and the National Union of Technikon Employees of South Africa agreed on the appointment of an independent consultant to investigate the benchmarking of TUT salaries against the higher education sector.

&quot;The scope and time frame of the investigation is still to be determined by a joint committee comprising TUT and union representatives.&quot;

In earlier negotiations last week the parties agreed to a 7.45 percent salary increase for staff on certain post levels, and other benefits.

However, the parties failed to reach a final settlement because of the unions &quot;reintroducing issues that have already been agreed to&quot;.

&quot;Some of these issues will have significant financial implications for the future sustainability of the university,&quot; De Ruyter said.

Lectures remained suspended until further notice.

Negotiations were scheduled to resume at 10am to day.

The strike was in its eighth yesterday day. - Sapa

2. Fallout from Madlala Routledge's dismissal

&lt; http://www.sowetan.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=539021 &gt; 2.1 Vavi doesn't respect our martyrs - ANC

Eric Naki, Sowetan, 14 August 2007

Cosatu general-secretary Zwelinzima Vavi has come under severe criticism from the ANC for statements he made to the media at the weekend.

Vavi rebuked some of President Thabo Mbeki's cabinet ministers and described them as &quot;deadwoods&quot;, &quot;who remain untouchable&quot;. He said some were &quot;dying on duty&quot;.

In a hard-hitting statement issued late yesterday, the head of the presidency Smuts Ngonyama lambasted Vavi for making &quot;deplorable&quot; and &quot;irresponsible&quot; comments unbecoming of a leader who headed the secretariat of a progressive trade union movement.

&quot;The statements demonstrate a failure to understand the difference between frank and constructive criticism,&quot; said Ngonyama.

&quot;This an essential feature of the democratic movement, and the kind of abusive ranting to which many of the ANC's opponents regularly stoop.&quot;

He said: &quot;These are not the sort of comments one would expect from a senior member of the ANC-led alliance.&quot;

Vavi's comment about ministers &quot;dying on duty&quot; is an apparent reference to Minister of Health Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, who recently had a liver transplant.

Vavi comments came while he condemned Mbeki's dismissal of Deputy Minister of Health Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge who was fired over an unauthorised trip to Madrid, Spain, and for failing to work within the government's collective.

Ngonyama expressed disappointment at Vavi's statements.

&quot;His insensitive reference to ministers 'dying on duty' demonstrates a shameful lack of respect for those who have passed away, and for their families, colleagues and friends,&quot; said Ngonyama.

He said cabinet ministers who had died while in office - former ministers of housing Joe Slovo, safety and security Steve Tshwete, justice Dullah Omar and public works Stella Sigcau - served the nation with dignity.

&quot;Vavi's attack on current members of the executive is uncalled for. The experience of the last 13 years demonstrates that tangible and meaningful progress has been made by the government in improving the living conditions of our people,&quot; he said.

&quot;These achievements have been reviewed and reiterated on numerous occasions including at two successive alliance summits.&quot;

According to Ngonyama, the contribution made by the ministers should not be &quot;demeaned or belittled by those who would rather play to the gallery than honestly examine the strengths and weaknesses of our government&quot;.

He reiterated the ANC's support for Mbeki's decision to &quot;relieve Madlala-Routledge of her responsibilities in government&quot;.

&quot;The ANC respects and accepts the decision taken by the president, in accordance with the powers and responsibilities conferred on him by the constitution,&quot; he said.

&quot;The ANC thanks Madlala-Routledge for her contribution to the country's transformation during her tenure.&quot;

&lt; http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=539481 &gt; 2.2 Cosatu stands by 'deadwood' comment

The Times, 14 August 2007

Cosatu has apologised for Zwelinzima Vavi's comments about ministers 'dying on duty' but refuses to retract its comments about 'deadwood' in Thabo Mbeki's cabinet.

Cosatu secretary general Zwelinzima Vavi's comments on cabinet ministers who died on duty were never intended to show disrespect to them, the trade union federation said today.

&quot;These comments were in no way intended to show disrespect to those ministers who passed away while holding office in the government and Zwelinzima Vavi apologises unreservedly to the families of these comrades, and all others concerned, for any offence that may have been caused,&quot; Cosatu said in a statement.

In his weekend address to the congress of the Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers Union (Sactwu), Vavi said that some ministers were &quot;deadwoods who remain untouchable&quot;, and that some were &quot;dying on duty&quot;.

His statement was prompted by the sacking of deputy health minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge by President Thabo Mbeki last week.

While Cosatu retracted its secretary-general's remarks on ministers who died on duty, the federation said it was still of the view that there was some &quot;deadwood&quot; in Mbeki's cabinet.

&quot;Cosatu wishes to place on record however that there are some ministers who are not performing to that high standard and that part of the statement will not be withdrawn.

&quot;We will not remain silent about government ministers or government policies when they are not serving the interests of the working class and the poor majority of South Africans,&quot; Cosatu said.

&lt; http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3981640 &gt; 2.3 Fired deputy lied over hospital visit - MEC

Deon de Lange, The Star, 14 August 2007

Madlala-Routledge starts adapting to life as plain MP

Eastern Cape Health MEC Nomsa Jajula has accused sacked deputy health minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge of lying.

&quot;I want to place it on record that the ex-deputy minister of health, Ms Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, during her visit to Frere Hospital, did so without informing me as the MEC (of) health in the province of the Eastern Cape.

&quot;Statements by her claiming to have informed me of the visit and its purpose are an absolute lie,&quot; Jajula said yesterday.

Madlala-Routledge paid an unannounced visit to Frere Hospital in East London on July 13. She said last week that before her surprise visit, she had informed Jajula of concerns about conditions at the hospital.

&quot;On the day of my visit to Frere, Ms Jajula could not join me because of the short notice. But she sent the acting head official of her department to visit the hospital with me.&quot;

Madlala-Routledge reportedly &quot;went to ground&quot; at the weekend and is giving no further media interviews, her adviser Sukhthi Naidoo said.

She spent an overcast day house-hunting in Cape Town yesterday.

Since her axing on Wednesday night, Madlala-Routledge started rearranging her life to adapt to her new role as an ordinary MP.

At the end of next month she will no longer qualify for the perks associated with high public office - benefits she has enjoyed since being appointed deputy defence minister in 1999.

These include fully furnished state-owned housing, two state-owned vehicles for official duties (one each in Pretoria and Cape Town), the round-the-clock services of VIP protection officers and drivers from the SA Police Service, and first-class air travel with members of her family and support staff for official trips abroad.

She will see her annual pay package decrease by R300 000 a year - from R889 000 to about R572 900 - as a backbencher.

According to the Handbook for Members of the Executive, she will also have to get along without the extensive private office afforded to deputy ministers.

Significantly, Madlala-Routledge also loses her observer status on the ANC's powerful national executive committee, as this privilege comes with an executive post. She will therefore no longer be privy to some of the most important political decisions taken in the country.

Instead, her exposure to political decision-making in the ANC is now limited to that which is discussed in the party's parliamentary caucus.

Her first appearance back in the halls of parliament will probably take place on Thursday morning, when she is expected to attend the ANC's weekly caucus meeting with fellow MPs.

There she will come face to face with ANC MP James Ngculu, who chairs the health portfolio committee and who last week accused Madlala-Routledge of creating &quot;unnecessary hype&quot; when she investigated reports of high stillbirth rates at Frere Hospital.

Meanwhile, messages of sympathy and support for Madlala-Routledge continued to pour in yesterday.

The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), to which she belongs, issued a statement calling her dismissal a &quot;national tragedy and a disgrace to democracy&quot;.

The government was yesterday quick to try to prove that it was business as usual in the fight against Aids, with the Presidency issuing a statement about Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka's meeting with the Treatment Action Campaign and the National Association of People Living with Aids as part of the work of the SA National Aids Council.

All parties had agreed at the meeting to continue working together, and &quot;a moratorium&quot; was placed on &quot;attacks and counter-attacks on each other's organisations&quot;.

The parties further agreed to stop the &quot;vilification and character assassinations of individuals&quot;.

&lt; http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/topstories.aspx?ID=BD4A539312 &gt; 2.4 Mbeki defends health minister's record

Tamar Khan, Science and Health Editor, Business Day, 14 August 2007

President Thabo Mbeki yesterday defended controversy-prone Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang and dismissed calls to relieve her of her position in the wake of a Sunday Times report alleging that she abused alcohol and sent staff on errands to buy food when she was in hospital in 2005.

Damaging allegations of her unbecoming behaviour when she was admitted to Cape Town's private Medi-Clinic Hospital for shoulder surgery came hand in hand with reports that staff at the run-down Frere public hospital had hurriedly spruced up the facility ahead of an inspection by her officials into baby deaths in its maternity ward.

Frere Hospital has been at the centre of the political storm surrounding the health ministry, as former deputy health minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge told reporters that her frank remarks on conditions there were among the reasons Mbeki gave for firing her last week.

The Sunday Times report of the minister's hospital stay has prompted the Democratic Alliance to call on Mbeki to sack Tshabalala-Msimang, should the allegations prove true. The report included eyewitness allegations that the minister was drunk, threw tantrums, demanded food be brought in from local stores and ordered alcohol to be smuggled into the hospital.

Presidential spokesman Mukoni Ratshitanga issued a statement yesterday, suggesting there was a smear campaign.

&quot;The Presidency notes that the latest allegations levelled against the minister of health appear to be consistent with some in the media and elsewhere to demean the person of the minister,&quot; he said. The allegations published in the weekend press do not warrant the president to take action against the minister of health.

&quot;Anyone who may have evidence which demonstrates that any minister or deputy minister has acted in dereliction of duty is welcome to forward such evidence to the Presidency,&quot; he said.

Mbeki also moved to address public concern over the poor state of public health facilities, saying the government had set aside R1,9bn for the hospital revitalisation programme, which has been running since 2003. About a dozen hospitals have been upgraded, and another 46 projects are in the works: &quot;The Presidency would like to reassure all South Africans of the integrity of the public health system ... led by Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang and the cabinet.&quot;

The minister also hit back, demanding the Sunday Times retract its story and furnish her with all the documentation it possessed relating to her hospitalisation within 24 hours. Her spokesman, Sibane Mngadi, said she might have to go to court should the paper fail to comply with a letter of demand sent by her lawyers.

&quot;The report is false, malicious, and in contravention of the law,&quot; he said in a statement.

&quot;The allegations ... are clearly defamatory and represent ... the latest instance of that particular newspaper's deep-seated contempt for the minister's rights to human dignity and privacy,&quot; said Mngadi .

&quot;Many of the allegations and insinuations are so bizarre, scandalous, speculative and incredible that the minister does not wish to dignify them with a response&quot;.

Sunday Times editor Mondli Makhanya said yesterday he had yet to receive the minister's letter of demand, and would consult the paper's lawyers before taking action.

&quot;There is no way we are going to retract it (the report). It is absolutely, absolutely true. It is up to the minister to disprove the facts,&quot; he said.

Political Bureau,  The Star, 14 August 2007

She demands retraction, return of medical records

Thabo Mbeki has gone the extra mile for his favourite cabinet minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang.

The president yesterday upped the ante and came out in public defence of the minister of health, who faces allegations of abuse of power and excessive alcohol consumption while in hospital.

Mbeki dismissed the claims, saying they did not warrant any action from him.

His bold defence came on the same day as a legal threat from the minister herself, through the Department of Health, demanding a return of her medical records from the Sunday Times.

Also yesterday, the Eastern Cape health MEC, in an indirect act of support for Tshabalala-Msimang, said axed deputy health minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge lied when she said she was invited to tour Frere Hospital, near East London, which was experiencing a high rate of infant mortality.

The last time Mbeki publicly defended a cabinet minister under siege was when he came to Provincial and Local Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi's defence over the Khutsong cross-boundary debacle, involving the municipality's controversial incorporation into North West from Gauteng.

Yesterday, he added Tshabalala-Msimang to the list, although other ministers under siege - including Safety and Security Minister Charles Nqakula, Transport Minister Jeff Radebe, Home Affairs Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa Nqakula and Trade and Industry Minister Mandisi Mpahlwa - didn't get a similar endorsement.

The Presidency last week began responding to the pressure piling up after the dismissal of Madlala-Routledge by releasing her letter of dismissal signed by Mbeki.

This was accompanied by a list of achievements made by the Department of Health.

Yesterday, it was a statement that there was no need to act against Tshabalala-Msimang in the light of newspaper reports.

&quot;The allegations published in the weekend press do not warrant the president to take action against the minister of health.

&quot;However, anyone who may have evidence which demonstrates that any minister or deputy minister has acted in dereliction of duty is welcome to forward such evidence to the Presidency.&quot;

The statement suggested that the attack on Tshabalala-Msimang stemmed from an outcry, particularly from the media, after Mbeki's firing of Madlala-Routledge.

&quot;Such allegations have the effect of shifting focus from the government programme to improve the public health system as a whole.

&quot;Furthermore, they seem to bear on recent decisions taken by the president regarding the leadership of the Ministry of Health and to project these in caricature of derogation.

&quot;The Presidency would like to reassure all South Africans of the integrity of the public health system as led by Minister Tshabalala-Msimang and the cabinet collective,&quot; the statement said.

Tshabalala-Msimang, meanwhile, sought to safeguard her privacy and other rights, with her lawyers demanding that the Sunday Times return her medical records within 24 hours or face legal action.

She was adamant the newspaper had broken the law - it breached the National Health Act by being in possession of confidential medical records, her ministry said.

It repeated that Tshabalala-Msimang had been defamed and that allegations against her were false.

Last night, Sunday Times editor Mondli Makhanya said he had not received any request for the return of the minister's records.

The newspaper on Sunday published allegations of excessive drinking, rude behaviour towards staff, as well as abuse of her position, while the minister was having shoulder surgery in a private Cape Town clinic in 2005.

It also quoted from her medical records, saying she consumed wine while under medication on the eve of surgery and questioned her suitability as a candidate for a liver transplant earlier this year.

Makhanya said the paper had investigated the allegations for five months. &quot;We are 100% sure our facts are true. It is not a story we would publish lightly.&quot;

The ministry also targeted the unnamed doctors approached by the Sunday Times for comment based on the medical records in its possession.

If they indeed had commented, &quot;they clearly acted in an unprofessional, unethical and illegal manner that requires sanction&quot;.

&quot;The minister will be referring this matter to the Health Professions Council of SA for an advisory opinion on the appropriateness of the conduct of the unnamed health professionals involved.&quot;

Staff at the medi-clinic yesterday went to ground, answering all queries with &quot;no comment&quot;.

The ministry said &quot;many of the allegations and insinuations are so bizarre, scandalous, speculative and incredible that the minister does not wish to dignify them with a response&quot;.

Instead, she wanted an apology and a retraction.

It is understood that the minister is pressing legal action in her personal capacity.

Solly Maphumulo,  The Star, 13 August 2007

Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang is to face tough questions surrounding the equipment crisis at Frere Hospital.

Democratic Alliance spokesperson on health Mike Waters on Sunday said he would be posing parliamentary questions to Tshabalala-Msimang to establish whether some equipment was shipped from Cecilia Makiwane and Bhisho hospitals into Frere Hospital, in East London, just before the task team sent to investigate the situation arrived.

&quot;If the equipment was brought in just to create an impression, then the task team's assessment and its final report would have been skewed,&quot; Waters said.

This followed a surprise visit to Frere Hospital by the recently sacked deputy minister of health, Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, on July 13.

The Daily Dispatch had reported that 2 000 babies had died at the hospital in the past 14 years due to a lack of staff and equipment.

After her visit to the hospital, Madlala-Routledge labelled the situation a national emergency.

According to a Sunday Times report, when a task team visited Frere Hospital on July 16, and the minister six days later, the hospital had been hastily refurbished, with Tshabalala-Msimang rejecting the claims that babies had died due to equipment shortages.

Tshabalala-Msimang conceded there were staff shortages.

Waters said the conditions at Bisho and Cecilia Makiwane hospitals were just as bad: &quot;How these hospitals, already grossly under-resourced, are supposed to function needs to be explained.&quot;

He said the DA would pursue the issue until the public was given a suitable explanation.

&lt; http://www.dispatch.co.za/2007/08/13/Easterncape/aalead.html &gt; 2.7 About-turn on hospitals' costly beachfront HQ

Ntando Makhubu, Health Reporter, Daily Dispatch, 13 August 2007

After three years it's going back to Frere

THE EAST London Hospital Complex's controversial beachfront headquarters is to move back to Frere Hospital.

The move comes three years after managers and other senior staff moved out of Frere's fourth floor to the upmarket Ocean Terrace building, shortly after the merger of Cecilia Makiwane and Frere hospitals became public knowledge in August 2004.

The move away from the hospitals raised the ire of staff, unions and the health department's oversight body and was called a &quot;waste of money&quot; at the expense of service delivery.

The about-turn comes in the wake of a report compiled by a three-person task team headed by Professor Ronald Green-Thompson after an exposé by the Daily Dispatch on conditions in Frere's maternity wards.

The task team recommended that the hospital complex &quot;concept and model be reviewed in line with the National policy for the management of hospitals&quot;.

East London Hospital Complex spokesperson Toni van Niekerk confirmed the move but said it was because their lease agreement expired in September.

&quot;There are currently 110 employees in the building and a phased approached is being considered as sufficient space is not readily available at either one of the institutions,&quot; Van Niekerk told the Dispatch.

Both the provincial health portfolio committee, which had investigated reports of a space shortage, and health unions said they believed there was enough space at both Frere and Cecilia Makiwane.

Sources at Frere said that over the past month staff occupying the hospital's fourth floor had been told to prepare to relocate &quot;because the previous owners were coming back&quot;.

&quot;A senior matron was actually approached several times and was moved out last weekend when a senior official moved back,&quot; said a source, who asked to remain anonymous.

Van Niekerk added once the comprehensive relocation plan had been approved by relevant stakeholders, the move would be undertaken with minimal disruption to services and staff.

The move will bring to a close a controversial chapter in the history of the two hospitals.

Both the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) and Democratic Nurses Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) last year slammed the complex's decision to relocate to the beachfront, saying it was a waste of money.

Vukile Maki, a Nehawu shopsteward at CMH, yesterday said the union was excited to hear of the move back as it meant managers would be nearer to where services were needed.

&quot;We said (back) then that the move was a fruitless expenditure and that they would be miles away from the people that were performing duties,&quot; Maki said.

Provincial health portfolio committee chairperson Mike Basopu said: &quot;Moving out of the beachfront is the right thing to do because staff there were inaccessible to the communities that needed them. Some people had to spend a lot of money that they could not afford and time travelling to the beachfront.&quot;

Staff at Frere said having had administration at the beachfront was a huge problem. &quot;If you can't get a problem resolved at the frontline office at Frere you have to find a way of getting down to the beachfront to deal with it there. If you don't have a car you have to take a taxi or a bus. If you work shifts getting to the beachfront is also tricky - sometimes you have to come in on your day off and go then,&quot; said a staffer.

Denosa's shop steward at Frere, Edward Maseti, said it was &quot;unfortunate that the complex management had waited to be pressured to move back, which showed that they did not realise that they had been wrong in moving out.

&quot;At no point did they indicate that they realised moving out had been a waste of time and money,&quot; he said.

Van Niekerk said the cost of renting the beachfront office for this year stood at R108822, against R93297 in year one and R100761 last year.

Bryan Rostron, Business Day, 14 August 2007

NERO did not fiddle while Rome burned. According to Suetonius, who had access to the imperial archives, Nero &quot;put on his tragedian's costume and sang The Sack of Ilium from beginning to end&quot;. So we should avoid the frequent analogy that President Thabo Mbeki fiddles while South Africans die of AIDS. Instead, last week, Mbeki took decisive action - and sacked his deputy health minister, Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge. As an overture to this dismissal, Mbeki had put on his showy philosopher's costume and composed a bizarre, Nero-like riff in his weekly online letter about the relationship between statistics and miniskirts. This was to refute descriptions, including Madlala-Routledge's, of the dire conditions at the Frere Hospital in East London.

Now, more seriously, her sacking has been interpreted both nationally and internationally as a desire by the president to negate the deputy minister's forthright stand on HIV/AIDS.

Officially, the reason given for her sacking is that she was not a team player. Yet the most shocking announcement at Madlala-Routledge's press conference last Friday was her claim that two years ago Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang threatened: &quot;I will fix you.&quot;

Shifts in the health department's own organogram made explicit the deputy minister's noxious rapport with her boss, Tshabalala-Msimang. She started out three years ago directly under the minister; but by the end, the department's website showed her hived off to the side.

Conditions in the deputy minister's office reflected this relegation: she was kept out of the loop, denied access to information and documents, and encountered obstacles appointing staff. More recently, members of her staff received hate mail and threatening e-messages, which could have come only from within the department.

It also seems fairly clear that a trap was set for Madlala-Routledge. She was given a verbal assurance from the Presidency that her trip to a medical conference in Spain had been cleared. Her letter of application had in fact been stamped &quot;approved&quot;. It was only as she flew out of SA that Mbeki scribbled &quot;not approved&quot; on her application. This background and timing carry all the telltale fingerprints of a classic &quot;fix&quot;.

Similar crude office politics occur every day in organisations and corporations all over the country. The crucial difference in this case, however, is that it involves elected politicians, public money, public policy - and a fundamental issue of life and death.

But then this saga exemplifies a trait in South African public life, as if everyone has been on the same public relations course. Whether it's the South African Communist Party responding to accusations of missing cash, the SABC dealing with corruption and blacklists, or politicians of all denominations, the mantra appears to be: &quot;Deny, deny, deny - and, in extremis, shoot the messenger.&quot;

A master practitioner of the art of denial is African National Congress (ANC) MP James Ngculu. It has been widely reported that the Western Cape ANC has been wracked by infighting - attributed to a faction, led by Ngculu, opposed to their own premier. Yet as Western Cape ANC chairman, Ngculu asked last year, &quot;Where is the split? There is no substantiation for this, only speculation. Our strong view is that there is no problem in the Western Cape.&quot; He is now reported to have changed sides - so in fact his words may , finally, have come true.

Later last year, reacting to reports that 60 Somalis had been killed in two months in Western Cape, Ngculu objected, &quot;Why do you call these attacks xenophobic? When a British tourist is attacked, do you call it xenophobic? Do you know how many Xhosa business people are murdered in Khayelitsha every week? Do you call that xenophobic?&quot;

Last week Ngculu, as chairman of the national health portfolio committee, visited Frere Hospital, after which he accused Madlala-Routledge of trying to &quot;create hype&quot; and denounced the original press exposé as &quot;magnifying figments of the imagination&quot;. He added that he was impressed with the cleanliness of the hospital and rejected reports that cleaning companies had worked through the night to spruce up the controversial maternity ward prior to Tshabalala-Msimang's visit last month.

I haven't been to Frere Hospital. But I have covered enough VIP visits to know that in the majority of cases an overnight refurbishment is exactly what happens. I can also introduce Ngculu to refugees in Cape Town who lock themselves in at night for fear of being attacked as foreigners. I can introduce him to poor families who find that ambulances when called either simply don't turn up, or do so seven hours late, and I can introduce him to young women who are treated appallingly in maternity wards, including being subjected to verbal abuse. One told me recently that the girl in the next bed had been crying out in pain, so a nurse yelled, &quot;Were you raped? Then why are you crying?&quot;

To deny truth is, to use a popular phrase, reactionary. The people least taken in by defensive denials are those who suffer the most: they know the reality of their own lives.

In the end the only ones really fooled are those, like E mperor Nero, in denial.

The Star, 14 August 2007

The Congress of SA Trade Unions has demanded action against Limpopo farmers who arrest Zimbabwean border-crossers.

The rounding up of Zimbabwean migrants by farm patrols was reminiscent of apartheid-era white farm commandos, Cosatu said yesterday.

&quot;There is no place for such behaviour in the new South Africa,&quot; said Cosatu spokesperson Patrick Craven.

The Transvaal Agricultural Union yesterday said members were protecting their farms, insisting that the influx of fleeing Zimbabweans posed agricultural and veterinary risks. - Sapa

Lyse Comins, Cape Times, 13 August 2007

Six million people who have been black-listed for debt stand to be cleared by credit bureaus under the National Credit Act's first amnesty provision.

Credit Information Ombudsman Manie van Schalkwyk said last week that the final phase of the amnesty for clearing adverse credit information from credit bureaus would end on September 1.

The act provides for people with outstanding judgments of less than R50 000, which were taken before September 1 last year, to pay the amounts and have the information removed from credit bureaus' listings.

Van Schalkwyk encouraged people to make the most of the amnesty. If they fulfilled the obligations of the amnesty, the judgment information on their consumer credit profiles would be removed. Also, they would not have to go back to court to get these judgments rescinded, he said.

Van Schalkwyk said people who qualified under the terms of the final amnesty should contact their credit providers with the account numbers relating to the judgments and confirm the outstanding amounts. They should then pay the outstanding amount before September 1 and ensure that they received a receipt as proof of payment.

Consumers could then contact the credit bureaus and provide them with the proof of payment. The bureaus will verify the document and remove the judgment information from the person's credit profile. The two main credit bureaus - Transunion and Experian - can be contacted at 0861 482 482 and 0861 105 665 respectively.

People who believe they have been unfairly listed by a credit bureau can complain free of charge to the ombudsman. His office can be contacted at 0860 662 837 or at om ... @creditombud.org.za.

&lt; http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3980485 &gt; 3.3 Donor changes tune on R500 000 'gift' to SACP

Sibusiso Ngalwa, The Star, 14 August 2007

The businessman who accused SA Communist Party leader Blade Nzimande of stealing a R500 000 donation that he made to the party now denies that he had opened a fraud charge against Nzimande.
Charles Modise said he had only lodged a complaint with the police to &quot;emphasise&quot; the importance of accountability.

Modise's lawyer, Zehir Omar, said his client had never opened a fraud charge against Nzimande.
&quot;With due respect, the police are wrong (about the fraud charge). There was never a fraud charge against Nzimande. Modise has the highest respect for Nzimande. He only lodged a complaint about lack of accountability in political parties,&quot; said Omar.

However, Gauteng police spokesperson Director Govindsamy Mariemuthoo has previously confirmed that they were investigating a fraud charge laid by Modise against Nzimande.

Attempts to get fresh comments from Mariemuthoo yesterday failed as his phone went unanswered and he did not respond to messages.

Fellow spokesperson Superintendent Eugene Opperman refused to comment on the matter, saying it was Mariemuthoo's &quot;baby&quot;.

Modise made an affidavit to the police in April detailing how he had donated R500 000 to the SACP after he had been approached by Cosatu leader Willie Madisha to assist the struggling party, as reported by The Star last month.

The money was allegedly collected by Madisha, who is said to have handed it to Nzimande.

In the affidavit, Modise said he could not confirm whether Nzimande did in fact use the money for the purpose intended.

Madisha last week made a statement to the police after he was contacted regarding his involvement in the donation saga.

During an interview on SAfm last week, Madisha confirmed that he had received the R500 000 from Modise and had delivered it &quot;where it was supposed to go&quot;.

He did not mention Nzimande's name and would not give further details, saying the issue was sub judice.

SABC, 14 August 2007

Fidentia boss, J. Arthur Brown, and company accountant, Graham Maddock, have briefly appeared in the Cape Town Magistrates Court this morning. This confirms earlier reports that the pair had been rearrested. Brown and Maddock already face fraud and theft charges amounting to almost R200 million.

They have been released on R5 000 bail each. This is on a new set of charges, also relating to fraud and theft. The two were out on bail of a R1 million each at the time of their rearrest.

Fidentia was recently placed under curatorship after millions of rands had gone missing. Head of the transport, education and training authority, Piet Bothma, was arrested last week for alleged fraud and theft of about R5 million following an investment in Fidentia. Bothma is out on bail of R200 000.

&lt; http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/default/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&amp;A...; &gt; 3.5 Fidentia lawyer slams re-arrest

News24, 14 Aug 2007

Fidentia bosses J Arthur Brown and Graham Maddock were re-arrested by the Scorpions on Tuesday on a fresh set of fraud and theft charges.

The two men, who are already out on bail of R1 million, appeared briefly in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Tuesday morning after handing themselves over to investigators.

They were released on R5 000 bail each.

The new charges relate to what the Scorpions claim is the misappropriation of R4.5m invested in Fidentia by Fundi, said to be a company supplying equipment to mines in Zambia, and over R5m from Infinity, a loyalty card business bought by Fidentia.

Brown and Maddock were first arrested in March, on fraud and theft charges involving just over R200m invested by the Transport Education Training Authority (Teta).

Last week the suspended chief executive of the Teta, Piet Bothma, became the third person to be arrested in connection with the Fidentia affair.

He appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on August 6 and was released on R200 000 bail.

Bothma has been charged with fraud and theft related to the investment of Teta funds with Fidentia, and with corruption involving alleged kickbacks of just under R5m.

It is understood that the reason the fresh charges against Brown and Maddock were not simply added to the existing case is because Bothma was not involved with Fundi or Infinity, and it would have been seen as a misjoinder.

Brown's attorney William Booth said outside the courtroom after Tuesday's hearing that he had protested to prosecutors that there cannot be a new arrest every time new charges came up.

If they wanted to add charges in future, they should add them to the two existing cases.

Tuesday's case was postponed to October 3. The three men are to appear again on the initial charges on August 31.

Fidentia has been put under curatorship, and curators say they are trying to track down a billion rands in missing funds.

Brown was the group's executive chairperson, and Maddock its financial director.

Tamar Kahn, Science and Health Editor, Business Day, 14 August 2007

SA's two highest-profile AIDS lobby groups, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) and the National Association of People Living with HIV/AIDS (Napwa), met yesterday to try to heal their troubled relationship.

The two bodies have a history of mudslinging, and have often taken opposing views on issues relating to HIV, such as the role of nutrition and antiretroviral medicines in combating the disease. The TAC eschews government funding, while Napwa is funded almost entirely by the state. The TAC has also clashed repeatedly with Health Minister Manto Tshabalala Msimang, while Napwa has largely supported her.

Following a resolution taken at the Congress of South African Trade Unions' congress last year, Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ncguka convened a meeting under the auspices of the South African National AIDS Council (Sanac) to try to resolve the differences between the two organisations.

The meeting, which was co-chaired by Sanac deputy chairman Mark Heywood, agreed to a series of measures to bring greater harmony to their work, and establish a unified organisation representing people living with HIV and AIDS that included people who were not members of Napwa and the TAC.
Napwa and the TAC agreed to recognise each other and agreed not to promote any treatments or remedies for HIV/AIDS with questionable safety and efficacy, he said. They therefore recognised the Medicines Control Council as the authority on such issues, he said.

Napwa's national director, Nkululeko Nxesi, said he was &quot;hopeful and positive&quot; that the relationship between the two lobby groups would improve .

Napwa and the TAC agreed to stop attacking each other, and send representative to each others' national congresses later this year.
