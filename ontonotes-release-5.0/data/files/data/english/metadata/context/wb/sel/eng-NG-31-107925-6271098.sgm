I saw them for $6 at Pocono, years ago.  Haven't been there in
probably 7 or 8 years.

They sell burgers at Cup races? lol J/K I only eat my own burgers when
I go, tailgating, out in the lots somewhere...But I will buy those
huge pretzels and the occasional tray of nachos at the tracks
tho...and of course I'll eat a Jesse Jones hot dog or two if I am at
Martinsville. But otherwise I'll take in a few bottles of water, a
candy bar or two, and just eat my own grilled food prior to going in.
(Nathans or Jesse Jones dogs, turkey burgers, sometimes Bubba
Burgers...)

You want a good $3-$4 "burger" at a race, try the bologna burger at
South Boston sometime. Better than it sounds, I promise. And it ain't
that thin stuff that Oscar Meyer sells either.

They are $6.00 more than they are worth! Same as the beer. They really rake
you over the coves and then that isn't the end, they batter and fry your
a--s. It's not enough they got 125.00 a seat from you do there best to keep
you from bringing in your own provisions. They must gouge as much as
possible from your soul. Yep NASCAR is a Good Ol' boy sport all right! Good
for the France family and the track owners, which is again the France family
in most cases.

Wellll...more accurately, M'ville hot dogs *used to* rule.  NASCAR's subsidiary,
AmeriCrown, now owns all the concessions at the track and not the church groups,
Scouts, civic organizations that used to do such a great job with the Jesse Jones
dogs.

Dunno if they even use Jesse's dogs.
