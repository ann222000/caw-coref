ok i'm not looking to crush my pills I'm trying to understand them.
i'm the worlds biggest fraidy kat about drugs. In fact I was on
Fentanyl 50 mcg which I asked to be taken off of cause it made me have
burning sensations and seemed to upset all my anxeity problems... so I
was switched to 20 mg twice a day of methadone. which I was on for
about 3 months. Yesterday morning I took my last dose of Methadone and
had huge anxiety attacks all day that I would have withdrawal... even
though I had been switched to the 20 mg extended release of
oxycontin.

Now here is the question...

If I take my pill at 8am I get 20 mg released then... well then do I
have another 20mg released say in 2 hours or 3?

I know that it basically keeps my body at a level of 20 mg for 12
hours. I was on another site looking for this answer where I her about
crushing pills to get high. And on my leaflet it says if you crush ir
you will release a large potentially lethal dose into your system...
which is why I was lead to believe the pill actually holds more than
20 mg... does anyone know this... how much it really has in it... or
haw it works... does it have another agent in it that amplifies the
drugs affects or something else like that?

I am in worse pain than when I was on the meth... but I have now only
had 3 doses of the oxy... and I guess I need to give it a chance to
build up and work right? Still my level went from 8 yesterday to 9
today. arg...

please help.

Blinded is right. Don't crush your pills.
In addition, if you take a dose of Oxycontin at 8am you should not
need to dose again for at least 6-8 hours. If you find that the 20mg
version is not providing adequate pain relief then go back to your
doctor and explain that. While crushing them might make you high, it
also might kill you. And, if you are intent on crushing them, I'd
suggest you find another group. In here we respect our dosing
instructions. If you look on your prescription bottle it will
say…..*Do Not Chew, Crush or Break - Swallow Whole* or something like
that.

First off, the 20 mg ER means that you get that 20 mg spread out over
several hours.  There are teeny little holes in the casing of the
tablet that allow a small amount of the med to leach out at a time and
that is what makes it extended release.  You are not getting a full 20
mg every few hours.  Each pill, as another noter said, only contains
the amount stated on the bottle.

Secondly, I'm really not sure but I think the amount of oxycontin they
are giving you to switch to is too low according to the conversion
charts.  You may end up in some bad pain unless you have been
prescribed breakthrough meds.  How often can you take this
medication?  Are they trying to wean you off pain medication
completely?  Is this being handled by a pain management physician or a
GP?  Sometimes they don't understand the conversion rates and you will
end up paying the price.

Can you give some more information on how often you took the Methadone
and how often you're taking the Oxycontin?

Blinded and Joe... I would enever crush my pills... the reason I
brought that up is becuase it says if you crush your pills you will
get too much of the med at once... and i know for a fact 20 mg of
oxycodone is not that big of a deal... which is what leads me to
beleieve you get more than 20 mg in the pill... the pill is designed
to keep you at a 20 mg level for 12 hours... I understand better
because I asked my pharmacist. She said you definitely dont get like 5
mg then 5 mg then 5mg... you start off wiuth 20 mg right away and then
when it comes time to release again you get another 20. Otherwise this
pill wouldn't work.

and yes I go to pain management... but when i swtched my pain went
from about 7 to 9.

No that's not correct. A 20mg tablet of Oxycontin contains a total of
20mg oxycodone in and extended release matrix.

angelsong,

It sounds s if you're worry and concern about how much medicine you're
getting, and how your meds really work, is getting in the way with
your objectivity-you seem to work your way into anxiety attacks,
before you get to give the pain meds a chance.  While I'm all for
patients' rights to know just what they're taking, why they're taking
it, and what they can and can't expect from it, until you can have a
looong talk with your doctor, you should keep taking the meds, as
prescribed-and give them a chance.  As to the time I give it(which may
e different for you), since my pain doc sees me once every month,
unless the pain become unbearable, or I get an allergic or otherwise
unusual reaction, I give it that time-one month-and then, talk it over
with my doctor at the scheduled appointment.

The meds you mentioned are all ones that I've used, and, while I have,
at times, had difficulties, they've never made me really sick...and,
they're all approved for Chronic Pain relief. I've also seen these
meds used by other pain patients-in this group, and others. In short,
it's not unusual for a doctor to prescribe them. So, try not to think
about the specifics...just take the meds as directed, and ask your
doctor about the intricacies of how they work, if it's still important
to you, at your next visit.  But, don't forget to tell him how it's
working, how it compares to other pain meds that you've used, and,
definitely,tell him if the meds are not working-or are giving you
unusual side effects (rash, temperature, nausea-really, anything that
makes you uncomfortable).  Be sure to make the distinction-if it's
hardly taking the pain away, you may need more of it, while, if you're
having unusual reactions, you may need to avoid it like the plague!

But, you were right to look up what the drugs were-and, if they're
generally accepted for the reasons prescribed.

Also, if you're anxiety problems persist you might benefit from some
anti-anxiety meds for a while-just to give yourself a chance to
separate the symptoms. but, make sure your pain doc prescribes, or at
least, knows about them.  Some drug mixtures can be dangerous.  In
short, tel him everything-and see how it goes from there.

-Legend

Apparently we're not the only place you're looking for information.

I'm an RN.  20 mg of Oxycontin ER is a total of 20 mg.   You will get
the dose spread out but there is not more than 20 mg in that pill no
matter who tells you different.  The law forbids mislabeling of
drugs.  ER means it is made so that the 20 mg is spread out over an
extended period of time.  What this means is that instead of you
taking 5 mg and then 3-4 hours later taking another 5 mg and then 3-4
hours later taking ANOTHER 5 mg, you take one pill and it lasts as
long as 4 5-mg doses, or that's how it's intended to work, anyhow.  I
think you misunderstood what your pharmacist said.  No pharmacist I
know, and I've known plenty in my 15 years as a nurse, would tell you
an untruth.  Sometimes, though, we don't understand and so our minds
tell us one thing when another thing has been said.

Again, I'll ask how often you're supposed to take the
Oxycontin...because without knowing the frequency, there is no way of
telling if you're going to struggle with the level of pain relief.

You've mentioned crushing the pills twice now.  Is there a reason
behind that statement?

a common misunderstanding i'mafraid - even for some professionals.

from the purdue pharma clinical fact sheet:

&quot;The tablet strengths describe the amount of oxycodone per tablet as the
hydrochloride salt.&quot;

you have to first know that dosages start down at the 5mg range for
immediate release

the slow release forms are supplied in 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and
160 mg tablet strengths for oral administration.

- so a 20 er/hci is a slow release of the  20 over the total time span.

What difference how much it actually has in it?  Are you in a competition
with someone?  Mine is bigger than yours?
You take the medication and if it handles the pain properly, wonderful.
If you are overdosed, tell the doctor so he can adjust the medication.
If it does not perform the proper pain relief, tell the doctor so he can
adjust it.

Mine is bigger than yours

hours which is why most OC patients are on t.i.d. dosing. Don't crush or
chew or monkey with it. That a steep slippery slope and if you want to get
back on methadone, except this time for rehab, mess with your oxyC. I'd give
you 8 weeks before you're screwed.
Now the right way- call your doc and tell him it's not doing crap. They
usually build in, up to 50% safety valve, in dose equivalency when swapping
drugs- they never know how a new drug is going to work on a patient. So you
should probably be at 40mgs t.i.d. but better a trip to the ER for a shot of
demerol than a shot of narcan with an activated charcoal chaser. It sucks,
but it's safe and once the pain control is adequate you can look back and
see the point.
My last pain docs I was with 7 years. They were real jerks. But they always
pushed the point that if you needed to jack your dose it was no big deal as
long as you told them. Yea Right. That's where calling at 3 am is sure to
find them at home with time to listen. Just get a doctor to say OK.
You should also have some breakthrough, be it percoset or plain oxycodone
(better since no tylenol) so if you end up in a jam as you now are, you have
something to take the edge off and help a little.
But the worse thing anyone can do taking a time released medication is
defeat the time release. You go from taking a medication, to a monkey on
your back, to a gorilla on your back, to being sat on by an elephant, in a
matter of weeks
I'm curious as to what you thought of your short period on methadone. It's
quite unlike the rest of the narcotics. You get really good pain control
with none of a buzz feeling that leaves all narcotics so quickly.You'll find
they all go that way but thank god the pain control sticks around. Email me
(careful to edit if you cut and paste) if you want to get a little more in
depth. I've toured them all (even the ones they don't make any more) and
still found oxyC the strongest, methadone slightly less strong but the best
lasting and I include the patch in that

Call your Doc and good luck--og.

&gt; ok i'm not looking to crush my pills I'm trying to understand them.

&gt; If I take my pill at 8am I get 20 mg released then... well then do I

&gt; I am in worse pain than when I was on the meth... but I have now only

I have been sounding like an ass in my posts here, because I do not think we
are getting the entire story.
I fear that angle is playing us.  I looked thru the bbs that Trish posted
the url to and I think that angle is asking everyone
she can until she gets someone to give her the answer that she wants to
hear.
Someone on the other site, even advocates occasionally chewing the oxycontin
as a valid regime.

Angle,  please listen to what you are hearing here.  I think that you have a
chem. dependency problem and you have to use everything in you to take the
meds exactly as the doctors told you and not how you think it should be
done.
According to my GP many years ago, chronic pain patients rarely abuse their
pain meds.   But I am worried that you are not one that this applies to.
I sound like an ass, because I have been where I think you may be heading
and there is nothing worth the consequences to the road ahead of you.
So understand I am an ass hoping to 'scare you straight'     not because I
enjoy being an ass

Dear Mark,

At least we are thinking along the same lines, but suspicion alone leaves
you only two choices. Skip the thread and let them get the answer they're
looking for in another group or from another person, or try to reinforce the
danger of playing with fire.
Last night. this morning before I got my 2 hours of passing out (I can't
call it sleep anymore), I had broken out the old PDR and was going to supply
the exact info on blood plasma concentratiion of Oxycontin from hours 1-hour
12. The bioavaiability is easily found looking at prescribers info which is
found all over the web. Bioavailability of chewing a 20mg oxycontin is
enough to kill the moderately opiate tolerant.
I think that's enough of an answer, rather than what hour it peaks if taken
properly. The PDR does not cover concentrations when abused, chewed or
snorted. If the relief isn't cutting it, it's the patients responsibility to
tell their doc, not the responsibility of the patient to find a work around
to make the dose fit the pain. If the patient stays cool with the med they
can find a stable dose that will last years, sometimes decades. Abusers of
the med will never find an adequate dose, becoming another statistic in
rehab, if they're lucky or if not another statistic on the DEA tally sheet
of inflated OxyContin fatalities (forget the addition of alcohol or any
other recreational combinations, OxyContin still becomes the bad guy). Use
it right, ask for a higher dose or find another medicine, and stop
destroying the lives this medication saves.

Very depressed about the whole question--og

&gt;&gt; take the meds exactly as the doctors told you and not how you think it
&gt;&gt; should be done.
&gt;&gt; According to my GP many years ago, chronic pain patients rarely abuse
&gt;&gt; their pain meds.   But I am worried that you are not one that this
&gt;&gt; applies to.
&gt;&gt; I sound like an ass, because I have been where I think you may be heading
&gt;&gt; and there is nothing worth the consequences to the road ahead of you.
&gt;&gt; So understand I am an ass hoping to 'scare you straight'     not because
&gt;&gt; I enjoy being an ass
