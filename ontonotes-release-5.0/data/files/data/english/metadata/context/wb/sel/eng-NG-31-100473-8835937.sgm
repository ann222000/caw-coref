Hey Guys,
I am wondering how you are doing with MMO in your diesel fuel... I just
saw Kurt said his 87 300SDL is getting 27-28 MPG... so Kurt what was your
usual mileage? 24?

Tiger,

Can you please send me your email address.  I want to call you with a
few questions about my newest acquisition - a 1985 300D TD (W123.133).
I believe that you live in Vancouver, BC.  I am in Victoria, BC.  You
can reach me at C!O@N#T$R%E^X at shaw dot ca.

I filled up yesterday. 15.08 gallons and 389.a miles. Call it 25 mpg.
Previous fill-up yeilded 27.3 mpg. I think that the MM treatment may have
worked, but I've been driving a little more aggressively and faster which
would skew the figures somewhat. I'm planning on changing the fuel filter
(s) tomorrow, and will track the mileage per usual.

Even if the mileage altered with the MM fuel treatment, the apparent
added 'pep' in the way that the car drives is quite remarkable.

It doesn't hurt to periodically clean out the throat of the injectors.
But back when I was running the roads in a big truck, I was told that
continious useage of cleaners could erode the injectors. Anyhow, I figure
2-4 tanks of fuel is not continious usage and I am digging the added pep
big time!

Good to know. I may not use it every tank fill, but will be adding it
periodically. I'm really interested to see if there is an appreciable
difference after changing the fuel filters. They are about due for
changing anyhow.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

8 ounces per tank is what I'm using on the 300SDL. Of course it has a big
tank too.

I got about a 10% increase in both the 4 and 5cyl diesels.  The

Anyone run long enough to see if mileage has improved and stays that way
when no MMO is in the fuel? How about is the improved mileage cancelled out

My Mercedes specialist recommends that one adds about one cup of ATF per
tank.  The reason has nothing to do with improving fuel economy, but
with increasing the lower lubricity of current low sulphur diesel fuels.
Apparently the injection pumps on the older diesel engines (1980s) are
not as sensitive to lower lubricity.  The newer injection pumps (moving
vanes ?) may show a higher failure rate.

I am going to look at the cost difference/savings on my next fill-up.
I have purchased two bottles of MMO so far. I get them for $3.44
(32oz) at the local store. The first bottle I used as an initial
treatment and put 8oz in the tank at fill-up, plus 8oz in the
crankcase. This bottle I'm using per directions.
So, if I use 4-6 oz per tank I should get about 3-4 tanks out of a
bottle. That comes to about a $1 per tank. I usually fill up just
above empty which takes about 12-13 gallons and diesel is running a
little over $2.85 here now (actually higher this week).
So, doing the math, it doesn't take much improvement for it to pay for
itself. Just a 10% increase (2-3 mpg increase) can save a gallon in
one tank. Of course, my problem is that I never seem to fill the tank
up the same amount each time, so my mileage isn't as accurate as it
could be. The auto-shutoff on the pump always fills my tank too full
and it spills out, does anyone else have this problem?
The biggest difference I notice is the pep in the engine, already it
feels much more responsive, especially when its cold. I've only run
two tanks of MMO through mine so far though, so I still have so
testing to do.

One additional note, does it matter about the note on the back stating
that it doesn't meet the low sulfur requirements? That only applies to
the newer diesels, right?

I haven't calculated  mileage changes that may have occurred but I too
have noticed an improvement in how the engine (1984 SD) runs. It seems
smoother and more responsive and I seem to see less smoking.  I've
started using it in my '84 Ford diesel pick up as well and there seems
to be a noticeable improvement there as well.  I'd read about this but
never really tried it.  Thanks for pushing the idea, Tiger

I had my '84 240D in Europe last year and it had to be tested for
registration. A device was attached to the exhaust which had lots of
smoke. The guy doing the testing revved the engine so hard that I
thought it would blow up. Finally, after 3-4 minutes he relaxed the
accelerator and the exhaust was quite clean. The &quot;smoke&quot; was lots of
carbon particles that had built up and this was making the exhaust look
dirty.

Has this Marvel oil being tested by an independent lab that has a good
reputation?

Thanks Tiger.

I find this really astounding. If it's as good as this thread believes,
why was it not tested by a test company with impeccable credentials way
back? This would have put out the good news 40 years ago and the guy
would have made a fortune on it by now.

A similar product is being advertized on Quake radio ( www.quake.com ),
with claims for greatly reduced emissions and higher mileage. Ed Schultz
(Radio Guru) is one of the people pushing it. I asked the company that
sells it about testing and here is what I received:

&quot;Thank you for your inquiry on CA 40g fuel additive.  I forwarded your
question to the manufacturer and they supplied me with a test performed
by Northern California Diagnostics Laboratories, Inc.  It is now on our
website. http://www.hydro-zoneinc.com/ca406.htm &quot;

I would like to believe these claims but I need something really solid
before I spend any money on it.

I'm looking forward to your opinion.

When I had diesels (years ago) I used to run a bottle of techron
through them about every 4-5 tankfulls or about every oil change. It
seemed to keep the fuel system clean and increase pep, however I never
saw it as a cost savings.

Today I still run a bottle of techron through the cars (gasoline)
about once a year or every FSS oil change.

As far as Mercedes recommendations go, I believe they eschew
additives.
