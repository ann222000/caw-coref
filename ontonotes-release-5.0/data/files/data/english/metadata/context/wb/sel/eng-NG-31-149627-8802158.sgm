Wal Asr

The smallest fraction of time is called as moment. It is smaller than
a second. Even smaller than moment is a thing termed as 'batting of an
eyelid'. The life-span of the entire universe is made up of these very
small moments, chained in them. From birth, man grows by the moment.
After a certain period, he starts reducing by the moment to the extent
that he is liberated from this cycle. Sometimes, days pass in a jiffy
but the nights seem so long as if you feel the arrival of each moment
and its passage. Why? How? When? While, none denies that since times
known, there has been absolutely no change in the speed of time nor is
it expected in the future. Yet, why does one feel that time moves with
pauses? The gist lies in the fact that when a person gets afflicted
with difficulties and problems and cannot foresee any solution for
them, worry over takes him. He is restive and desires his problems to
be dispelled in one go. He breathes and thinks of an imaginary moment
when all his problems will be solved and the tumultuous present will
pass! But he feels that there is a clash between time and
difficulties. Neither his difficulties are being solved nor is time
budging from its place. The greater the intensity of the difficulties
and problems, the more does time come to a standstill.

When and where does this happen? It is related to the place where the
circles of human deeds and acts occur in a particular set of
circumstances. Till man is alive, he is active in some place or the
other. If he feels that his problems cannot be solved in one city, he
migrates to another. Nevertheless, while migrating from one place to
another, he is at loggerheads with difficulties and is constantly
striving to regulate the inconsistencies of his moments.

In the scorching summer of May-June, the blessed month of Ramazan
enters. A labourer slogs the whole day under the blazing glare of the
sun. To work hard and slog in a state of fasting is completely
different from fasting in normal circumstances when you are satiated
and your thirst quenched. The fasting labourer intends to come home
early. Noon is on the decline and the sun is all set to sink. The long
walk to his home is all of three hours. His eyes spot an earthen pot
brimming with cold water. His heart is roasted. The sight of water has
increased his thirst. But patience is obligatory because the Holy
Quran has advised 'Seek help through patience' and in the light of
traditions, patience has been explained as fasting. This journey of
three hours -from afternoon to dusk - seems like a travel of many
days. It's the battle of a fasting believer. Killing thirst is
challenged by a pot of cold water right in front of his eyes. If he
breaks his fast, he will lose the battle. And if he passes these
testing moments with the remembrance of Allah, exhibiting
steadfastness and patience while expressing undying gratitude to his
Lord, he will be triumphant. His fast will be accepted and gigantic
rewards will be his destiny.

With this example, in the light of feelings and senses, in those
passing moments - the smallest measure of time - if you have gauged
the miraculous and incredible values of the breaths of human life and
the bond that exists between its intense and light moments, then come,
let us see the number of battles waged by the grandson of the
Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.), Hazrat Imam Husain (a.s.), with each
passing moment from the 28th Rajab till the afternoon of Aashura, the
10th of Muharram. Here, by stating 'the number of battles', we intend
to depict a glimpse of events that began from Madinah and the moment
when the raging battle reached at its zenith in Karbala and finally
came to an end in the afternoon of the 10th of Muharram. After the
death of Moaviyah, his son Yazid ascended the throne, a clear
violation and breach of the peace-treaty concluded between Moaviyah
and Imam Hasan al-Mujtaba (a.s.). As a result, Yazid instructed the
Governor of Madinah to either force Imam Husain (a.s.) to pay
allegiance or behead him and send his head to Syria, the seat of
Caliphate. On the other hand, Imam Husain (a.s.) refused to pay
allegiance. In the gubernatorial palace, Marwaan raised the slogan of
killing Imam (a.s.), who bid farewell to Madinah. The caravan was
ready to depart. Abdullah Ibn Umar came forward and advised, 'Son of
Allah's Messenger! It would be better if you travel in the darkness of
the night.' When Imam Husain (a.s.) politely declined Abdullah's
suggestion, he requested, 'In that case, please unbutton your shirt so
that I can kiss your chest as the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) used
to do. For, he (s.a.w.a.) had prophesied that when my Husain (a.s.)
bids farewell to Madinah, know that he will be martyred.'

Dear Readers! On the one hand is the caravan in which are the youths
of Bani Hashim, the loyal and faithful companions and the infallible
and pure ladies. Children are also quite a few. On the other hand,
traps are laid down by the enemies. The enemy is in a position of
power. This small caravan reached Makkah while staring death right in
its face. After the passage of the months of Shabaan, Ramazan, Shawwal
and Zeeqad, the month of Zilhajj arrived, announcing the season of
Hajj - the annual pilgrimage. Hordes of pilgrims entered Makkah. A
number of mercenaries hired by the tyrant Yazid also entered Makkah
wearing the dress of the pilgrims but with swords concealed in these
holy clothing so that they could kill the son of Allah's Prophet
(s.a.w.a.) and earn handsome rewards from the accursed Yazid. They
thought that this incident would be confined to the books of history
as an obscure event. But Imam Husain (a.s.) converted his Hajj into
Umrah. Initially, Janabe Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah came and met him and
requested him not to take the road to Kufah. Imam (a.s.) turned down
the request. Janabe Abdullah Ibn Ja'far, in a state of illness and
along with the brother of Amr Aas - Yahya, came to meet Imam (a.s.)
with similar requests but Imam (a.s.) did not relent and continued his
journey. The caravan proceeded. On the way, they received the news of
Hazrat Muslim Ibn Aqeel's martyrdom in Kufah. Imam (a.s.) cried yet
the caravan continued to proceed to Kufah. Imam (a.s.) had already had
a meeting with Zohair Ibn Qain, who had announced to the people of his
tribe that his moment of martyrdom had arrived and that he was going
along with Imam Husain (a.s.), the grandson of the Messenger of Allah
(s.a.w.a.). On one occasion, Imam Husain (a.s.) himself went to
Abdullah Ibn Hurr al-Jo'fi and told him, 'If you accompany me now, you
will attain the lofty position of martyrdom.' Ibn Hurr Jo'fi replied,
'I shivered on seeing the mutilation meted out to Muslim's corpse. You
can take my horse - which is unparalleled amongst the fighter horses
in the whole of Arabia - and all my war arsenal but I am sorry I
cannot come with you.' Imam Husain (a.s.) thundered back, 'In this
case, you go so far that my cry for help should not reach to your ears
lest you be destroyed.'

Engaging in minor clashes with the army of Hurr Ibn Yazid al-Riyaahi,
Imam Husain (a.s.) entered Karbala on the 2nd of Muharram. From the
7th of Muharram, the enemies prohibited Imam (a.s.) from taking the
water and from the 8th of Muharram, there was not a drop of water in
the tents. To gauge the extent of thirst on the 9th and 10th of
Muharram is beyond human intellect and understanding. To endure the
trying moments of three days of thirst and parchment of throats with
steadfastness was possible only for the family members and companions
of Imam Husain (a.s.) and the pain of which can be felt only by those
who love them. Without doubt, every second must have seemed like a
gigantic mountain.

Thereafter, the looming darkness of dusk of Aashura was followed by
the journey of the captives from Karbala to Syria via Kufah. How the
days of the children of Bani Hashim must have passed! How the ladies -
with their own throats quenched - must have exhorted their children
for patience! May our parents be sacrificed for those moments that had
become silent after becoming the portraits of pain and grief!

If one ponders deeply and asks a pounding heart about the point of
commencement of the impact left behind by the great sacrifice of Imam
Husain (a.s.), no just person will say that its effect was only on
account of the battle of Karbala, its morn or evening. These were mere
indications towards the culmination of a series of events. Rather, the
canvas of impact commenced with the conversation between Imam Husain
(a.s.) and the Governor of Madinah including in its fold a number of
events till those heart rending moments on the eve of Aashoora. Every
moment, every second, the battle of Imam Husain (a.s.) continued till
his last breath.

Today we mourn the martyrdom of Imam Husain (a.s.). We wear black
clothes and carry the standard of Hazrat Abbas (a.s.). We carry the
caskets of the young Sakinah (s.a.) and Imam Husain (a.s.). The youth
beat their chests (maatam) to express their anguish. Women mourn the
martyrs and the ladies. From every house, wails of 'Ya Husain' can be
heard. The leaders of the community and the heads of tribes all come
together, leaving aside their differences and disagreements, to mourn
as if one of their own has died. This restiveness, restlessness,
crying, wailing and mourning for the martyrs of Karbala is the effect
of the pure milk fed to us by our mothers, which has become blood and
is now flowing in our veins. This amazing and incredible sight that
shakes the mind as to how this crowd of hundreds and thousands, while
listening to the virtues and excellences of the Ahle Bait (a.s.) yells
out cries of 'Ya Ali' and sends salutations on Muhammad and Aale
Muhammad (s.a.w.a.), suddenly, for the last ten minutes, when the
speaker starts narrating the sorrowful events of Karbala, becomes all
heart broken and wails as if afflicted with a great grief! Each and
every one sheds tears uncontrollably. From where did this feeling and
emotion emanate? This is the consequence of Imam Husain's (a.s.) grief
that is deep-rooted in human nature. Did you ever deliberate on it?
Can we compare the inhabitants of this desolate world with the
handkerchief of the Lady of the Universe, Hazrat Fatemah Zahra
(s.a.)?! The only reply one can think of is that our mothers have
instilled this love in our blood that flows through our veins in one
of those sorrowful and heart-rending moments when they grieved for
Imam Husain (a.s.). When a mourner for Imam Husain (a.s.) breathes his
last, amongst all his other wills, he also wills to his heirs and
successors to ensure that this mourning for the Chief of the Martyrs
continues. This battle of Imam Husain (a.s.), which lasted for six
months (from 28th Rajab till 10th Muharram) was fought against an
empire that spread till Rome and Persia. But his (a.s.) handful of
followers fought so valiantly that it wringed and broke the wrist of
the gigantic kingdom. This is the miracle of Islam which is shining
like a golden seal on the history of humanity, every moment of which
will be strengthening the slogan and belief of 'There is no god but
Allah'. Those who oppose the mourning (azaadaari) of Imam Husain
(a.s.) and object at the mourners are unaware that by these
hostilities, they are disgracing none but themselves. It is extremely
difficult to assess the significance of the six month battle waged by
Imam Husain (a.s.) but its every second salutes the mourners who shed
tears for their Imam (a.s.), his household and his companions. True
monotheism reflects the truthfulness of his faith. If you don't
believe, pick up the Holy Quran - which comprises of all things wet
and dry - and ask it about anything from any era and it will reply,
'Why don't you deliberate and ponder on Surah al-Asr?'
