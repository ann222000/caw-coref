A T-6G Texan made an emergency landing just short of the Fond Du Lac,
WI airport. The aircraft landed on highway US 41 on the northbound
lane. Local law enforcement were able to stop traffic moments before
the aircraft made its forced landing. The aircraft struck a sign post
damaging the right wing, the two occupants were unhurt. The aircraft
was towed onto the FDL airport grounds. Traffic was tied up for
several hours. The aircraft was enroute to EAA from an air show in
Peoria IL. Apparently the engine may have lost oil pressure and the
engine had complete power failure. The pilot was attempting to glide
to the FDL runway. All is good, everyone safe including the aircraft.

I was just using shorthand for the city. You are correct the airport
identifier is KFLD.

I'd have given money to be on that highway with a camera when that happened!
Glad to hear plane and pilot are safe.

Not footage of the touchdown itself, but a not-completely-awful news
piece on it.

If it's true that any landing you can walk away from is a good landing
- that was an AWSOME landing.

Hah!  Local radio here reported it as a &quot;WWII Bomber&quot;, and as a
&quot;B-52&quot;.  At the time, I assumed they meant B-25...

I rather think a B-52 (or even a B-51!) would've been a wee bit
tougher to put down on a highway than a T-6... :)

This is a test of the emergency tagline system.  Were this an actual tagline, you would see amusing mottos, disclaimers, a zillion net addresses, or edifying philisophical statements.  This is only a test.

Nice job by this guy. Putting a T6 down on a highway like that at night
without denting anyone's body in the process was a good piece of work.

Local news is showing dash cam footage from the Highway Patrol car of
the landing. I haven't seen it personally but I told by a reliable
source. I'll try to catch it on tonights news broadcast.

Although it sounds like he did have some help in getting traffic stopped before
he landed.

Still, good job.  Nice to hear of a good landing, instead of a bad death.

At 7:45 PM, it was still pretty light out there! Good job! It sounds as
if the engine pretty much ate itself to death.

DAMN ! ! !

That was some MIGHTY FINE flying!

I did note that some people were not stopped, and he had to pull up over a
couple, and did that with flair!

Think the white car that went past the cops doing the flashing light rolling
roadblock is in any trouble? &lt;VGB&gt;

That clip should get around in short order.  We will be seeing that one quite a
bit, I should think.

They should have cuffed 'em and stuffed 'em!  What an idiot!

Yes, a nice piece of flying.

That link described it as &quot;an amateur pilot and his son&quot;...well, these
days, if you are flying a T-6, you aren't actually and amatuer.

I read something somewhere that said the pilot was a highly sought after
test pilot, that frequently flys test missions on government contract.

That I would believe, seeing how he managed his energy to get over all of
the traffic, including the recreational vehicle (I think) that was stopped
on the side, and turned to follow the road, went over a bridge...

Wow.  That guy is my hero! &lt;g&gt;
