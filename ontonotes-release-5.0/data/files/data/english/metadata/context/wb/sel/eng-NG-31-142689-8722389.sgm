Globalism is Advancing Quickly

What happened to sovereignty, which was a right universally
acknowledged until recently? During the past century, the West -
and much of the rest of the world as well - underwent a drastic
political and social transformation. Basically, there was a
battle between nationalism and internationalism . The latter
won. If Westerners want to remain financially solvent and
socially secure, they must reject all forms of internationalism.
They must return to the idea of thinking and acting locally.
Globalism isn't good for Whites, for what is it but a collection
of Jewish ideas that are, unfortunately, often adopted by
gentiles? Jews were the leaders in the creation of world
government and global finance. In fact, the Soviet Union's
Comintern - run by the Jew named Zinoviev - was designed to aid a
global political revolution. Another Jew birthed the UN with help
from other internationalist Jews like V. Perlo, S. Adler and H.D.
White. Globalism is, for all practical purposes, a new type
of Marxism, a suit-and-briefcase version of the old type. It's
revolutionary, it transforms nations and it's profitable, too
[1]

[1] the author Ivor Benson, a journalist and a former Rhodesian
government official, explained that there is a vast difference
between capitalism and &quot;supercapitalism.&quot; He says of the latter:
&quot;For it is not possible to continue concentrating ownership and
control of property and resources without at the same time
reducing the number of those who own and control property and
resources.&quot; Benson calls both communism and supercapitalism
&quot;irreconcilably antagonistic&quot; towards nationalism, and also
&quot;revolutionary&quot; (as opposed to &quot;evolutionary&quot;), a significant
observation. See Benson's book &quot;The Zionist Factor&quot; (Costa Mesa,
CA.; the Noontide Press, 1992)

'supercapitalism' was the word used.

Karl Marx noted that capitalists would dig their own graves.
Because capitalism required constant expansion of markets and
products and perpetual growth, societies that support capitalism
would eventually succumb to socialism and finally, communism.

&gt;

You've been conditioned to believe that capitalism is synonymous with
free enterprise. It is not. Hitler and Mussolini practiced capitalism
and the state dictated the type and extent of commerce. Within those
boundaries business was allowed.

When government runs a central bank that dispenses fiat money, and
politics is underwritten by corporate interests, the individual
conforms to state rules for operation and financing. This delimits
individual options. Hence, markets do not determine enterprise.

A couple things come to mind about Nazi Germany - one was after Hitler
was &quot;enabled&quot; to rule by decree, he demanded the German radio industry
build a radio that any German could afford which only received the
&quot;official&quot; stations even though the sale price meant little or no profit
to the manufacturers and dealers.

Later when the Nazi military drew a conclusion Germany needed more men who
knew how to drive cars and trucks, Hitler demanded the German auto
industry produce a car any German worker could afford; this time they said
&quot; we can't&quot; ... so the nazi government decided to build it themselves.

Now here in the USA we've seen a quarter-century of mergers and
acquisitions in every line of business on the basis of &quot;Economic
efficiency&quot;, that is if 5 companies combine to 1 we can reduce the
overhead of H.R., accounting, upper management; only 1 data center is
needed instead of 5 ... more profits to the shareholders.
If taken to the logical conclusion there will be 1 owner for each line of
business ... then in time only 1 owner for all business and perhaps
even all real property.

That situation would be hard to distinguish from Communism.

Clinton private charities are one thing...
The last twelve years of neocon rapine are quite another - and much
more real as far as US citizens are concerned.

History has shown that the excalating concentration of wealth in the
hands of fewer and fewer citizens ultimately leads to revolutions.

Lose the Clinton shtick, already.
The last 12 years under the republicons have brought enough misery to
America.
Neocons exist in both parties - and people should not vote for any of
them.

But if we are to blame inequities in the governance of this country,
the blame falls squarely on Republicon shoulders for the crap that
they legislated and enacted. (foisted on the public)

Hillary might (ubfortunately) be elected.
You can blame her IF that happens.

&quot;You know the one thing that's wrong with this country?
Everyone gets a chance to have their fair say.&quot;
- Bill Clinton, May 29, 1993, The White House

As reported by the Associated Press, Sen. Clinton said, &quot;Many of you are
well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you. We're saying
that for America to get back on track, we're probably going to cut that
short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you
on behalf of the common good.&quot;
- Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, 2004, San Francisco fund raiser

&quot;When we got organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical
Constitution with a radical Bill of Rights, giving a radical amount of
individual freedom to Americans, it was assumed that the Americans who
had that freedom would use it responsibly.... [However, now] there's a
lot of irresponsibility. And so a lot of people say there's too much
freedom. When personal freedom's being abused, you have to move to limit
it.&quot;
- William J. Clinton, MTV's &quot;Enough is Enough&quot; 3-22-94

&quot;You can't say you love your country and hate your government.&quot;
- William J. Clinton, 1995 (After the OKC bombing)

&quot;The purpose of government is to rein in the rights of the people.&quot;
- William J. Clinton, MTV interview, 1993

Since Socialism eventually results in state totalitarianism

&gt;&gt; LIBs will vote for Killary watching FOXnews liking BOTH!
&gt;&gt; CLINTON is Great and FOXnews is her Profit. OBEY HER. Now!

&gt; Clinton private charities are one thing...
&gt; The last twelve years of neocon rapine are quite another - and much
&gt; more real as far as US citizens are concerned.

The Democrat Neocons tend to be a bit lighter on Zionism because
of the anti-religion zeal among Democrats. Other than that they're
the same.

The Clinton's chief money resource is China, Inc.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; That situation would be hard to distinguish from Communism.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes. And along the same line, a concentration of wealth is
&gt; &gt;&gt; functionally equivalent to totalitarianism.

&gt; &gt;   We can't afford to have that money go to the private sector.
&gt; &gt;   The money has to go to the federal government because the
&gt; &gt;   federal government will spend that money better than the
&gt; &gt;   private sector will spend it.

&gt; &gt; This is Clinton's Bridge to the 21st Century.
&gt; &gt; A Bridge which is NO BRIDGE because it span no river.
&gt; &gt; A Legacy which is NO LEGACY because it embody no legitimacy.
&gt; &gt; A World Safe for Socialism in his image which is NO WORLD
&gt; &gt;            because no one's Rights are secure.

&gt; &gt; Thank YOU! Bill Clinton For Being There at the
&gt; &gt; pinnacle of our Civilization to PISS IT ALL AWAY!
&gt; &gt; Are YOU a Hillraiser yet? She HAS SUCH SIGHTS to show you.

&gt; &gt;     I believe in evil and I think that there
&gt; &gt;         are evil people in the world.

&gt; &gt;            It's HARD to be Humble when you're HILLARY.

&gt; &quot;You know the one thing that's wrong with this country?
&gt; Everyone gets a chance to have their fair say.&quot;
&gt;   - Bill Clinton, May 29, 1993, The White House

&gt; As reported by the Associated Press, Sen. Clinton said, &quot;Many of you are
&gt; well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you. We're saying
&gt; that for America to get back on track, we're probably going to cut that
&gt; short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you
&gt; on behalf of the common good.&quot;
&gt;   - Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, 2004, San Francisco fund raiser

&gt; &quot;When we got organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical
&gt; Constitution with a radical Bill of Rights, giving a radical amount of
&gt; individual freedom to Americans, it was assumed that the Americans who
&gt; had that freedom would use it responsibly.... [However, now] there's a
&gt; lot of irresponsibility. And so a lot of people say there's too much
&gt; freedom. When personal freedom's being abused, you have to move to limit
&gt; it.&quot;
&gt;   - William J. Clinton, MTV's &quot;Enough is Enough&quot; 3-22-94

&gt; &quot;You can't say you love your country and hate your government.&quot;
&gt;   - William J. Clinton, 1995 (After the OKC bombing)

&gt; &quot;The purpose of government is to rein in the rights of the people.&quot;
&gt;    - William J. Clinton, MTV interview, 1993

...

Even as Clinton promises to become the largest mass murderer in History,
LIBs still wonder why such should be *ANY* cause for concern...
LIBs not only sponsor our Adversaries,
they actively defend them as well.

&quot;We'll actually have to work very hard to kill
as many people in the 21st century.
What's the difference?
This time, you think the victim could be you,&quot;
Clinton'07

Why should we settle for the lesser Evil?

It would be wrong to cut off contact with the terror group just because
they may have killed people &quot;in a way that we hate.&quot;
-- Bill Clinton.

Iran is the only country in the world that has now had six elections
since the first election of President Khatami (in 1997). ...
In every single election, the guys I identify with got two-thirds
to 70 percent of the vote. There is no other country in the world
I can say that about, certainly not my own
-- Clinton'05

&quot;to leave now we would send a message to terrorists
and other potential adversaries around the world that
they can change our policies by killing our people.
It would be open season on Americans.&quot;
-- Bill Clinton '93

&quot;I have advocated engagement with our enemies&quot;
-- Hillary'07.

I believe in evil and I think that there
are evil people in the world.
-- Hillary'93

The LIBs proudly do unto our own,
PRECISELY what they forbid us to do to our Adversaries,
because Clinton says so... They will not be satisfied until
they can do to Crawford precisely what Clinton did to Waco...

This is Clinton's Bridge to the 21st Century.
HELLWORLD stands for Hillary. Are you a Hillraiser yet?
She has SUCH sights to show you.
