In my Swan 68, I have a couple of heads but for the ladies I'm planning
to install a bidet. A first class stainless steel bidet at that:
http://img.nauticexpo.com/images_ne/photo-g/94175.jpg

Now, I've never used a bidet but my understanding is it's not a head.
Rather one uses the head first to do one's business and then uses the
bidet for a thorough clean up of the soiled bottom or vagina.

From a discharging of waste standpoint is the gray water coming out of a
bidet considered sewage? Or is it gray water that can be disposed of
directly overboard?

I hesitate to plumb the bidet into the holding tank because I know how
much water women are prone to use. But if it's illegal to plumb it
straight overboard then I guess I shall have to do so.

Have you considered that when it is used as intended the discharge might
make great fish and bird attractor.

Wilbur, will you be installing a bidet for men also?  Whenever I go, it is a
real bother trying to wash my 15" inches of love machine.

That's pretty funny, Lloyd. Funny because, like all good jokes, it is
based upon an underlying truth. Honestly, I have found that most
American women are smelly pigs between the legs. They will readily poke
fun at European women because some of them don't shave their underarms
or keep their pubic hair trimmed and bikini waxed. But, at least
European women douche and use bidets regularly. American women, on the
other hand, have gotten this well-deserved reputation of the fish smell.
It is because American women use the head and give their privates a
quick wipe with toilet paper. Some even wipe from back to front. So not
only is urine spread on their vulva but feces as well. Then the bacteria
starts growing. Yeast infections occur. Genital warts, diaper rash etc
happen. And, it's all because they don't use bidets that they end up
smelly down there. So what do they do instead of washing themselves
thoroughly using a bidet every time they urinate or defecate? They buy
feminine hygiene deodorant sprays in an ineffective attempt to mask the
malodorous condition. It's really disgusting when you think about it.
And, if all that isn't bad enough, the majority of American women use
tampons. Instead of allowing the monthly discharge of blood and sloughed
off dead tissue from the womb to exit into a sanitary napkin which is
changed as needed, they use tampons and trap the dead and rotting tissue
inside their vaginas sometimes for days at a time. Total folly practiced
for vanity's sake alone. And what do many of them do with the used
tampons? You got it! They flush (or try to flush) them down the head and
clog up the works.

Nope, I've had European women aplenty and American women aplenty and I
say, for the above reasons alone, European women are way way superior
and twice as desirable as American women.

That was probably that dastardly Scotty from alt.sailing.asa. He loves
to make changes to various posts saying all sorts of slanderous things
and then he answers them with comments like. "TMI," "Oh, now I
understand" and "Why must you gay up every post?" He's very childish.

Oh, and did you notice how Precious Peggy avoided answering the bidet
discharge question. I think I know why. It's because she's clueless. Her
late husband never had anything to do with bidets so she's got nothing
he wrote to usurp and take credit for her own.
