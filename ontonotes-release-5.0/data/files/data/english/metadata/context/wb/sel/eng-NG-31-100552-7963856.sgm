I just dragged home a new vehicle: a 1953 Willys Overland Pickup.

Stude Content....I think that Brooks Stevens was the designer of the
truck????

I think the original engine was an &quot;Intake Over Exhaust&quot; (F Head); but it
was underpowered, and often replaced with &quot;More Stude Content&quot; the Stude
V8, or the Flat Head Ford. Mine has a Mercury 255 cid (stroked version of
the old 239 Ford FlatHead); but it's stuck. I just pulled the heads, and
number five is a little cruddy, and the PO has used two head gaskets on
that side. There is indication of coolant leakage at number five (and
possibly some at number three).

I'm now soaking the cylinders with Rislone, and will rock it daily for the
next week or so.

Thus far I haven't been overly aggresive in trying to free it up. I'm just
rocking it; and seeing some movement of the fan (indicating movement of the
crankshaft), but so far no movement of the pistons.

Any suggestions?

Thanks; Keith.

If that doesn't work there is always Diet Coke!

Seriously, there is an acid in Coke that will often free a stuck engine
when nothing else will, but you want to be sure to use DIET Coke, sugar
does ugly things to engines!

Is that the truck that looks like a Jeep pickup?  Those are the coolest
looking little trucks.

Someone had one on Ebay a while back that was 4WD and had a Stude 289 in
it, best of both worlds!

Inondate it with PB Blaster.  Eats rust and other corrosion, while
lubricating.

UPDATE
I tried all the magic formulae; and it was still stuck. So this afternoon
I pulled the pan, and disconnected the two stuck pistons, and turned the
engine away from the stuck pistons.
It turned easily.
Then I tapped the stuck pistons: one tapped down easily; the other was a
little more stubborn; but it moved down about half an inch.
The bottom end looked splendid.
I'll soak the stubborn one for another week, and try again.
Thanks for all the help.

Yes; it looks like a Jeep pickup.
Stude V8s, and flathead fords were apparently common conversions.

Make sure your oil pump turns!

I went to a great deal of trouble to un-stick a Ford flattie in a Universal Carrier, and
got it unstuck alright, but the oil pump was full of trash, and it sheared off the drive
gear on the back of the camshaft. That's all she wrote...
