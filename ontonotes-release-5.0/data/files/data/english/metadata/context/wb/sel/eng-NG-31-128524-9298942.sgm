Sharia courts are constantly trying to extend their authority,
secular courts are reluctant to challenge them.

***Apakah yang sama akan terjadi di Indonesia ? Saya percaya bisa,
karena ada sila pertama merestui sharia courts, dan parpol2 sekarang
termasuk PDI-P ramai2 mewarnai dirinya ke-Islam-an, untuk
memenangkan pemilu 2009.

***Amend Pancasila segera dan resmikan dwi fungsi TNI, sebelum
sekularisme lenyap dari NKRI.

THE RIGHT VIEW

Intolerant Malaysia, tolerant faith?

When Hindus gathered courage and protested in an unprecedented
solidarity on November 26 in Kuala Lumpur, they were crushed
brutally by the Malay police using chemicals in the water cannons.
None of those who had put up a united front against a cartoon
created in Denmark felt anything bad or condemnable in the
injustices meted out to the Hindus in an Islamic country. When it's
a question of Hindus getting unfair treatment in a Muslim majority
region, the 'civil, sophisticated and articulate' Muslim
intellectuals take refuge in the statement that it's a matter
concerning a foreign country. But when it's a question regarding a
cartoon or a fatwa for beheading a writer, they say -we are a global
Ummah, anything happening anywhere to Muslims is our common concern!
All big lies and a bigger hypocrisy traded in the name of a
religion.

This year Diwali was not celebrated openly by Malaysian Hindus in
protest against the demolition of one of their most revered shrines,
the hundred-year-old Maha Mariamman temple in Padang Jawa. In the
last fifteen years, hundreds of Hindu temples have been demolished
and the number of forcible conversions and unfair treatment on
religious grounds has been constantly increasing. The tragic case of
Revathi was just a recent one.

Moorthy Maniam was a Malaysian Hindu hero. After he died, a group of
Muslims claimed he'd made a deathbed conversion. Despite his widow's
protests, the Sharia courts declared that he should be buried as a
Muslim. &quot;They used Moorthy to show that in this country, Islam is
supreme&quot;, complained his lawyer.

In the 1980s, Malaysia's Sharia courts were given equal power to the
civil courts, creating two parallel legal systems. But while the
Sharia courts are constantly trying to extend their authority,
secular courts are reluctant to challenge them.

Malaysia which tries to woo Indian tourists with an aggressive media
campaign claiming-it's a 'truly Asian' destination, has become a
hotbed of Islamic intolerance and barbarities on non-Muslims. It has
sixty per cent Malay Muslim population with Chinese, mostly
Buddhists, comprising twenty-five per cent. Malays of Indian origin
constitute about eight per cent and Tamil Hindus are ninety per cent
amongst the Indian origin population. There is a fair number of
Indian Muslims too.

Indian Malays were taken there by the British as plantation workers
in the late nineteenth century and have now become an inseparable
part of Malay life. In fact, from the second century to the 14th
century, Malay Peninsula has seen Hindu kingdoms and a way of life
beautifully expressed in arts, culture, language and Shaivite
values. Sanskrit's influence over their language is visible all
over, yet the Malay Muslims choose to express their affinity with
the Arabs and deny their ancestral heritage.

Politically, Indian-origin Malays follow the Malaysian Indian
Congress (MIC), established in 1946 as an instrument of independence
from the British rule. Malaysia, freed in 1957, remained a
practising pluralistic society till Islamic fundamentalism grew in
the last two decades bringing Arab money and intolerance with it.
Now it has parallel Islamic courts, functioning along with the civil
ones, which are obviously more influential.

Malay Hindus have their leader in Datuk Seri Samy Vellu, president
of the MIC and a minister in the14-party coalition government who
mustered courage to protest against temple demolitions by declaring
a 'private' Diwali this year. However, instead of being supported by
the country's Muslim intelligentsia, he was booed, and in a rally
addressed by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, people demanded
his ouster from the cabinet as a 'trouble maker'.

Hindus seems to be losing hope on all fronts and are making last-
ditch efforts to attract attention by any which way to their sorry
state of affairs. An umbrella organisation of thirty Hindu NGOs has
been formed under the banner of Hindu Rights Action Force or HINDRAF
that had called for the successful demonstration on November 26.
Earlier a court had banned the rally – but HINDRAF workers –
gathered in an unprecedented number – twenty thousand by a modest
count –defied the ban and had their voice heard throughout the
world. A nation, which has seen centuries of Hindu influence
nurturing its socio-cultural milieu, suddenly turned against her own
people when Arab-Islamic influence grew, resulting in the
dispossession of minority rights. It has tried now to completely
eradicate its Hindu history being taught in the schools, including
the descriptions regarding ancient Ganga Negara (2nd to 11th
century), Langka Asuka(2nd to 14th century) and Sri Vijaya empire
(3rd to 14th century) in different parts of the earlier greater
Malay Peninsula.

It's a reflection of India's secular government that the Malay
Hindus of Indian origin chose to knock at the British doors,
strangely petitioning the British government, Malaysia's former
colonial ruler, to pay two million dollars each to every Indian-
origin Malay as compensation for 'putting them in a situation of
darkness and exploitation' which was a result of bringing their
ancestors as indentured labourers a century before. They are
discriminated on religious grounds and economic opportunities are
not available to them.

&quot;Over the years Indians have been marginalised in this country and
we now want the same rights as enjoyed by other communities,&quot; M.
Kulasegaran, opposition lawmaker with the Democratic Action Party
(DAP), told the media. &quot;This gathering is unprecedented, this is a
community that can no longer tolerate discrimination.&quot; said HINDRAF
leader P. Uthayakumar. The demonstrators had gathered at Batu Caves
Hindu temple and many of them carried posters of Mahatma Gandhi.
But, sadly, there was no murmur amongst the Indian authorities in
Delhi or in their High Commission in Kuala Lumpur about it.

Indian secularism prevents South Block to go vocal on injustices
meted out to Indian-origin people if they happen to be Hindus. Only
Muslim sensibilities are deemed fit to be entertained by Indian
envoys abroad. This message further emboldens the jihadi intolerant
rulers to take Hindus in their country for granted as a forlorn
people for whom none would bother. Malay Chinese are given a voice
by Singapore's influential leaders of Chinese origin like Lee Kuan
Yew and Christians get full support from the US, UK and other
European governments. Only Hindus, who have no other country on this
earth but India to look upon for any moral support, are left
abandoned.

Sometimes I feel amazed to see that how highly educated people who
shine in politics and academics can be so ruthless towards their own
fellow citizens as to deny them basic human rights. Like a place of
worship and a choice to adhere to a faith of choice. Why have the
societal ruptures been so visibly strong in countries where
Islamists form majority? We have enough such examples from Indian,
Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Malaysian incidents that have a common
thread – wherever the Muslims are in majority the rights and freedom
of the non-Muslims are severely curtailed.

Take for example Kashmir. It's the only state in India which is a
Muslim majority and see what happened there. Hundreds of temples
were razed, Hindus were forced to flee, their women were raped,
children were killed and houses forcibly occupied. The Muslims in
Kashmir have been enjoying a special status under Constitution's
Article 370, hardly any central law is enforced there, the number of
income-tax payers is among the lowest and unlike other poor states,
J&amp;K gets 90 per cent central financial assistance as grants and only
10 per cent as loans. Still there are complaints that a 'Hindu
central government discriminates'. The other minority, Buddhists
mostly located in Ladakh , too, are harshly treated and
discriminated against by the mainly Sunni Muslim governance in
Srinagar. The Buddhist Association, Leh, has been submitting
memorandums to the central government about how Buddhist youths are
denied jobs and a fair chance to join the Kashmir Administrative
service and professional colleges in spite of clearing the entrance
exams. The number of Buddhist minorities is fast decreasing causing
concern amongst their leaders. Even their dead are not allowed to be
buried in Muslim-majority Kargil area and monasteries have been
denied to be built.

If that can happen in a Hindu majority India's Muslim majority
state, one can imagine the position of Hindus in a Muslim majority
country like Pakistan. A report of the United Nations Committee on
the International Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination (CERD Committee) says, 'The Constitution of Pakistan
segregates its citizens on the basis of religion; and provides
preferential treatment to the Muslims. While Article 2 of the
Constitution declares Islam as &quot;the State religion of Pakistan&quot; and
the Holy Quran and Sunnah to be &quot;the supreme law and source of
guidance for legislation to be administered through laws enacted by
the Parliament and Provincial Assemblies, and for policy-making by
the Government&quot;, under Article 41(2) only a Muslim can become
President. Further, Article 260 of the Constitution
differentiates &quot;Muslim&quot; and &quot;Non-Muslim&quot; thereby facilitating and
encouraging discrimination on the basis of religion.

The Constitution is so glued to providing preferential treatment to
the majority Muslims that even a Hindu judge has to take the oath of
office in the name of &quot;Allah&quot;. On 24 March 2007, Justice Rana
Bhagwandas, a Hindu, while being sworn in as Acting Chief Justice of
Pakistan, being the senior most judge after the suspension of Chief
Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, had to take oath with a Quranic
prayer - &quot;May Allah Almighty help and guide me, (A'meen)&quot;.

The Hindus and Hinduism have been maligned and hatred against them
is propagated in the text books approved by the National Curriculum
Wing of the Federal Ministry of Education. Among others, Hindus have
been stated as &quot;enemy of Islam&quot; in the textbooks of Class V.

I hate to look disillusioned and always try to see something
positive and hopeful for my columns but to avoid the smoke around
your neck is as calumnious as to see bad where everything is
otherwise resplendent with nobility. Last week I met an important
Malaysian foreign dignitary over lunch at Taj Chambers, when during
the course of our discussion about Asians, I mentioned the plight of
Malaysian Hindus. He simply rubbished all that had appeared in the
international newspapers and channels saying 'small matters are
presented hundred times larger than the real quantum of
gravity'. 'We are a very tolerant society'. Really?
