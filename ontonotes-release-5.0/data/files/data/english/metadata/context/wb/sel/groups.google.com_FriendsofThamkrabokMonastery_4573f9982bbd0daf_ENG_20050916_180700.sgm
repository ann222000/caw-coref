I have been asked this question a couple of times but I simply didn't
have an answer (although I'm still thinking about it!).

I'm not so sure that you can map 12 Step teachings over Buddhist
principles or visa versa, although they do share a lot of, what might
be called &quot;universal truths&quot;.

While I continue to ponder the question, (probably for some
considerable time yet!), someone else has come up with some thoughts on
the same matter.

Kevin Griffin's book &quot;One Breath at a Time - Buddhism and the Twelve
Steps&quot;.
ISBN: 1-57954-905-5

Although some on the parallels may seem a bit contrived, it's a very
good effort at answering the question. Overall, I found Kevin
Griffin's book very helpful.

Has anyone else read this book?
Does anyone else have a view?

Go well,

Vince

I was doing some research into Buddhism and addictions (i.e. surfing
the net) when I came across the following book review:-

The Joy Beyond Craving
A Buddhist Perspective on Addiction and Recovery
Jon Keskula Mountain
Desert Wordsmith Productions, 2003.
ISBN 0-9729929-0-1
Paperback. 120 Pages.

Paul:
This slim volume takes us through the Four Noble Truths, and then
re-formulates the Twelve Steps of AA in a Buddhist context, changing
the language to be more accommodating of different religious
backgrounds and dependencies. One of his strengths as a Master of
Divinity is his keen appreciation of the diversity of religious and
spiritual practice. Thus his sensitivity to issues that might alienate
people is very keen. I agree with him that &quot;dull, technical and hard
to follow&quot; books on Buddhism abound, and applaud the attempt at a
short, simple, accessible account. The old joke &quot;I would have written
a shorter letter but I didn't have time&quot; points to the essential
problem here: he has in fact attempted the very hardest thing.
Conveying Buddhist doctrines such as 'no-self' in so few words is a
challenge. For the newcomer to Buddhism and recovery, I am unsure such
a bald statement will be that convincing. It lacks the examples,
anecdotes, and stories that Griffin for example uses to such great
effect to soften our preconceptions and bring to life 'a Buddhist
perspective on addiction and recovery'. For this reason I think
Griffin's book is the better starting point. This shouldn't detract
from the fact that The Joy Beyond Craving makes interesting reading for
those trying to reconcile AA and Buddhism.

Michael:
This small book provides the author's attempt to re-work the language
of the Twelve Steps of AA from a Buddhist point of view. He looks at
the Four Noble Truths in relationship to addiction before addressing
each step in turn. The author demonstrates well his understanding and
qualifications in conveying the steps in the language of Buddhism.
Though other books have discussed a Buddhist approach to the Twelve
Steps as they currently exist, no other work had undertaken to change
the original wording of the steps. Although at times I did get the
sense that maybe he took spiritual correctness a touch too far in his
explicit desire to not alienate others (it is after all near impossible
to be all things to all people), his work nonetheless provided me with
further understanding, clarity, and deeper insight into combining what
is ultimately the heart of recovery with the spirit of Buddhism. Whilst
the language of the book is quite clear and simply conveyed, I do feel
this book would ultimately be best utilized by those who already have
some experience in both Buddhist and Twelve Step practice. It's not a
book that takes a broader Buddhist approach to addiction, but in its
attempt to portray the Twelve Steps translated into a predominately
Buddhist version of the same, I believe it fills a unique but important
gap left by others and well lives up to its basic intention.

Chapter headings:
· Introduction
· Part 1: The Four Noble Truths
o The First Noble Truth: Life is a bitch, and then you die!
o The Second Noble Truth: If you think you have to have it, then it
really has you!
o The Third Noble Truth: Nirvana is the joy of being where you are and
loving what is here and now!
o The Fourth Noble Truth: There is a way!
· Part 2: The Twelve Steps
Step One; Step Two; etc....
· Conclusion
· Annotated bibliography

Selected excerpt:
&quot;We've seen that the cause of our suffering lies not merely in
external events, but in our own thoughts and actions, based on our
false concept of ourselves as independent entities. Turning our lives
over to our Higher Consciousness constitutes letting go of that
self-image, to recognize our oneness with the Emptiness of Ultimate
Being.
Mystics of all religions have said that the way to find Spiritual
Awakening is to open ourselves completely through prayer and
meditation, and listen to the still inner voice. Then in Divine
Ecstasy, when the distinction between our Higher Consciousness and
ourselves disappears, it does so not because we absorb that
Consciousness into ourselves, but because we put aside our illusory
idea of &quot;self&quot; and become absorbed in the Divine Emptiness
completely. This is the spiritual Awakening of which both Bill W. and
the Buddha spoke.&quot; (p. 112)

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Well I've been convinced by this review that this is a book I should
read so I've ordered a copy (this has nothing to do with boredom and
retail therapy, I assure you). I couldn't find a new copy of the book
in the UK so I've ordered one from AMAZON dot COM. Amazon's delivery
estimate is 9 to 36 days, so I might get it before the Christmas! I'm
a very slow reader so it will probably be next year before I finish the
book!!

It's probably too late to ask now but has anyone come across this
book before?

Hi Ron,
Thanks for the book perspective. Hopefully, it won't be an age before it
arrives.
Thanks also for the news of Phra Yeut... may all Beings be well and happy.
On the 'Friends' forum problem, before you can reply to emails you must
sign-in to the group at:

I hope this helps?

With Metta,

Vince,

I leafed through the book in queston at the bookstore last month, seems like
a decent analysis.

Stopped at Thamkrabok in early August, saddened to hear that Pra Yeut had
left and reportedly in ill health after a hard fall off the wagon in
Bangkok. Pra Gordon told me that he was in a hospital , placed there by his
mother. Perhaps an extra prayer from all of is in order.

On another topic, I tried to reply to the group under google, and was given
the message that my membership was still pending. I am guessing that you are
the moderator for the group so just wanted to check.

Peace always,

Ron Cole
