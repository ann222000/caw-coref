In USA , fire fighters have been entrusted with additional responsibility to
keep an eye on suspected persons or unusual activities in their working
neighborhood.

Apparently, the US government is steeped itself in the war on terror and
unleashing innovative ideas to take on the devils. This is supported by
mandatory finger printing all immigrants, in addition to  racial profiling.

Even the law makers passed a PATRIOT Act, with allow the government agencies
viz. FBI to eavesdrop in the US without court approval.

After all these years, due to lack of vision of successive Central
Governments, we don't have a unique ID for each citizen and hence terrorists
take advantage of this.

Political will to counter terror
At first glance, Friday's terror bombings in Uttar Pradesh are just one more
event in the murderous series of urban terror strikes that India has seen in
recent years. For the first time, though, an Islamist terror group operating
in India has issued a manifesto seeking to explain its actions. In an e-mail
despatched to television stations, the perpetrators of the bombings said
their acts were intended to avenge communal pogroms against Muslims.
However,
the e-mail m ade clear, propelling the pace of justice against their
perpetrators was not the bombings' intent. Justice, it claimed, &quot;could be
only possible
in Islamic rule, which could be achieved by only one path: jihad.&quot; Neither
polemic, nor the accelerating tempo of violence, ought to surprise us. The
Hindu
has long pointed to the growing pace of recruitment by Islamist terror
groups after the 2002 communal pogrom in Gujarat. Capitalising on the
legitimate
anger Muslims feel about the atrocities inflicted upon them, and the Indian
state's manifest failure to uphold the rule of law, Islamist terror groups
have been able to create a domestic infrastructure to sustain their violent
campaign. Most of the suspects involved in terror strikes since the 1993
Mumbai
serial bombings have been Indian nationals, drawn to the ranks of Islamist
groups based in Pakistan and Bangladesh in the hope of avenging communal
violence.
A jihad against India waged by Indians, a long-standing dream of south Asian
Islamists, was once thought a deranged fantasy. It is now upon us.

What needs to be done is well known: India's stretched police and
intelligence services need more resources and institutional reforms if
terrorism is to
be combated. The real question is just why politicians have shown so little
interest in bringing about changes all claim to agree are needed. Behind
their
apathy lies a wider political problem. Governments in States like Uttar
Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have been criticised, with some justification,
for their
long-standing unwillingness to combat Islamists — a failure that is, in
turn, a function of the allegiance major parties have developed with Muslim
communal
blocs. However, this criticism misses the point. Across India, governments
have demonstrated a remarkable unwillingness to confront any form of
communalism,
be it Hindu, Sikh, or Christian in its colours. India's decades-old failure
to act against perpetrators of communal violence gifted legitimacy to
religious
fundamentalists among the victims, and power to their counterparts among the
perpetrators. As one fanaticism flowered, it inevitably fed the fears that
fuelled the growth of others. Most political parties developed opportunistic
relationships with the growing religious right-wing, offering protection
from
the law in return for votes. A credible criminal justice system will do more
to contain Islamist terror groups than any number of policemen. But unless
politicians across the ideological spectrum find the will for a meaningful
consensus on upholding India's secular values, the reforms we so desperately
need are unlikely to be ever put in place. Islamists have issued their
manifesto for war. India's politicians now need to put together their own
manifesto
for rebuilding peace.

When extremists fall out
The disintegration of the far-right bloc of Members of the European
Parliament (MEPs) within ten months of its formation is a welcome augury for
peace and
democracy in the region. Parties across the political mainstream should
seize upon the development to expose the dangerous and divisive agenda of
the fringe
element spread across the European Union in the context of the seventh
European Parliament elections due in 2009 and the forthcoming adoption of
the Reform
Treaty fo r the union. The show of transnational unity among the sectarian
groups began when, following the accession of Bucharest and Sofia to the EU
in 2007, the far-right gained the requisite minimum number of seats in
Parliament to qualify as a caucus and coalesced under the banner of
&quot;Identity, Sovereignty
and Tradition&quot;. What triggered the breakup of the alliance was the Italian
MEP, Alessandra Mussolini's highly provocative remark — that all Romanians
are
criminals — made in the context of the row over the influx of the Roma
minority from that country.

To be sure, the resurgence of the ultra-right as a force remains, by and
large, a localised phenomenon, even if it has made electoral gains in
several countries.
The EU has responded to the threat by criminalising Holocaust denial in a
2007 law. While the move has rightly drawn criticism as undermining free
expression,
it is also counterproductive as a strategy to combat right-wing extremism,
as curbs on democratic freedoms ultimately strengthen extremist forces.
Equally,
parties on the right of the political centre have sought to cover up
ineffective governance and consequent voter disenchantment by cynically
manipulating
the populist appeal to racist, anti-minority and neo-nationalist
constituencies in the run up to national elections. The EU leadership must
instead address
the domestic fallout of its recent enlargement and the imperatives of
globalisation with greater sensitivity and maturity than the belligerent
postures
on migrants and widespread Islamophobia suggest.

John Howard went too far with a class war against the ordinary workers; in
his culture wars against many immigrant groups, and in his history wars
against
the aborigines and their plight.

Poor John Howard. Reckless on Kyoto, clueless in Iraq, fickle on civil
liberties, mean to migrants and minorities, ruthless towards the workers —
and now
jobless. He has lost his own seat, which he has represented since 1974, the
first sitting Prime Minister since 1929 to do so. For a change of
government,
the Labour needed a net gain of 16 seats in Australia's 150-seat Parliament.
With six seats still undecided on Saturday night, Labour had won 84, the
coalit
ion 58 and independents 2. As one of the major dailies screamed, &quot;Howard
humiliated as Liberals are mauled.&quot; Another way to appreciate the magnitude
of
Kevin Rudd's achievement is to recall that he is only the third Labour
leader in 60 years to win an election from the opposition.

Mr. Howard's political epitaph may well read, &quot;Nothing so unbecame him as
the manner of his going.&quot; Macbeth said of his Lady, she should have died
hereto.
Similarly, Mr. Howard should have exited last year. He would have gone out
with political aura as well as dignity intact, remembered fondly by the
Howard-huggers
and gratefully by his party, and basked in well-earned rest. Instead, like
so many leaders in all parts of the world, he fell victim to his own hubris
and infallibility.

The Liberal-National coalition had stayed in power owing to luck; sound
economic management that delivered high growth, high employment and low
inflation;
and unbelievably weak and inept opposition. Through this, voters preferred
to ignore and downplay accumulating evidence of dishonourable dealings.
Astonishingly,
when Labour chose Mr. Rudd as its new leader early this year, Mr. Howard
raised issues of trust, integrity and honesty in political leaders as a
campaign
issue in election year.

Targeting minor discrepancies in Mr. Rudd's biography, his opponents
succeeded in riveting voters on the big picture of his life story. His
father died
in a tragic accident. He was working and living on the farm. The family had
to vacate the dwelling in order to make way for the replacement hired help.
Mr. Rudd was 11 at the time. In 2007, as leader of the opposition, he was on
the cusp of becoming Prime Minister of Australia. This is a compelling human
interest and human drama story. The more widely it was broadcast, the longer
the story ran on the front pages and the lead bulletins, the more exalted
was Mr. Rudd's status with the public, to the government's growing
frustration.

The attempt to tarnish Mr. Rudd's character caused no lasting damage to him,
but scored three own goals for the coalition. First, it brought the most
vulnerable
part of the coalition's record — truth in government (cue Iraq, weapons of
mass destruction, reducing terrorist threat, asylum seekers in a leaky boat
being turned away with no mercy and lots of lies, more lies with children
overboard, the government backed AWB as the biggest defrauder in the U.N.
oil-for-food
scandal, election promises broken because they were non-core, leadership
deal with deputy Peter Costello that was brushed aside, ministerial code of
conduct
that was abandoned because too many were having to resign) — front and
centre in election year. Secondly, it energised the Labour base which had
been haemorrhaging
under previous leaders Kim Beazley, Simon Crean, Mark Latham and then Mr.
Beazley again. As Karl Rove showed so brilliantly in the U.S., motivating
your
own base can be the key to electoral success. Thirdly, it communicated to
the broad public, as nothing else could have, that the government was in
panic
mode.

Realising this, the coalition began to dig even more furiously, and thought
it had found pay-dirt when Mr. Rudd was discovered to have visited a strip
tease
club on a visit to the U.N. in New York. The Bill Clinton impeachment saga
showed that there comes a time in the affairs of political leaders when the
voters become stubborn, dig their heels in, refuse to listen to any more
scandalous stories, and punish the muckrakers instead. In fact, the strip
tease
incident showed to the Australian public that Mr. Rudd was human after all,
not a mere robot. Instead of Mr. Rudd being burnt in the glare of the
blowtorch
shone relentlessly on him, the government members have been swept off the
treasury benches by blowback.

Many journalists had become used to being treated like mushroom by the
Howard government — kept in the dark and fed manure every once in a while.
They were
slow to awake to the reality of the voters' mood for change that had been
less strong than Labour's death wish. In the 2004 election, Mr. Latham
self-destructed
spectacularly. When Mr. Beazley returned as party leader, voters simply
stopped listening. Suddenly, with Mr. Rudd, Labour looked and acted
electable to
electrifying effect on the electorate.

Mr. Rudd was prompt in acknowledging transgressions, apologising for the
lapses in judgment and promising to do better in future. This contrasted
powerfully
with the serial can't-recalls, know-nothings, wasn't-tolds and didn't-reads
that Mr. Howard's Ministers threw endlessly at the public. Opinion polls
were
consistently devastating: most Australians considered Mr. Howard too old,
deceitful, desperate and devious. Mr. Rudd is 50, Mr. Howard 68.

Mr. Rudd adopted a two-pronged strategy. First, he shrank Labour as a target
by copying many of the coalition policies that in previous elections had
driven
a wedge through traditional Labour voters: firm reaffirmation of the
alliance with the U.S., strong opposition to terrorism and terrorists, no
wholesale
return to the previous Labour government policies from the Bob Hawke and
Paul Keating eras. Secondly, he staked out a different future on some big
picture
issues such as climate change, Iraq, industrial relations, health and
education.

The coalition stumbled more frequently and consequentially than Labour
during the campaign. Nothing illustrates this better than the final two
days. The
husbands of a retiring and an aspiring coalition candidate were caught
distributing leaflets claiming to be from a (fictitious) Islamic group
urging people
to vote for Labour because of its support for Muslim terrorists. The issue
dominated media comment in the last two days, and reinforced impressions of
desperation, deviousness and racism by the government. Small 'l' liberals
had already been disenchanted by the Howard government over the methodical
assault
on civil liberties (for example, the case of Indian doctor Mohamed Haneef).
Former coalition and Labour Prime Ministers Malcolm Fraser and Paul Keating
were equally damning of the country's loss of moral compass under Mr.
Howard. Most brilliantly of all, Mr. Rudd undercut Mr. Howard by promising
to spend
less, branding him as reckless in a desperate bid to bribe voters while
reinforcing his own image as a responsible fiscal conservative.

The campaign provides clues also to likely changes and continuity under Mr.
Rudd. In the fullness of time, Mr. Howard's contributions over more than 11
years will be judged to include the legacy of a remarkably prosperous,
dynamic and self-confident land of opportunity. Domestically, in efforts to
break
the power of the unions, Mr. Howard went too far with a class war against
the ordinary workers who returned to the Labour fold. He went too far in his
culture wars against many immigrant groups, and too far too in his history
wars against the aborigines and their plight. In foreign policy, he swung
the
pendulum too far away from Asia to the point of being suffocated by the
American embrace.

Mr. Rudd will likely begin preparations to bring troops home from Iraq but
not Afghanistan, and to re-engage Asia (he is a competent speaker of
Mandarin
himself) without spurning America. The most dramatic early action will be
ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and active engagement with the U.N.
climate
change conference in Bali next month. Hopefully, some balance will be
restored in domestic politics among civil liberty, state security, the rule
of law
and governmental accountability. Cultural diversity is likely to be
celebrated once again.

Mr. Rudd began his career as a foreign service officer and rose rapidly to
the senior ranks. When I asked him once why he resigned, he replied that if
you
want to make policy, you have to be a politician. Oddly enough, an early
major test for him might come if the India-U.S. nuclear deal is approved by
all
sides. Mr. Rudd is on record as opposing it. Labour traditionally puts a
higher premium on global regimes such as the NPT than on bilateral ties.
Yet,
as argued in an article in the influential Boston Globe by Karl Inderfurth
and Bruce Riedel on Saturday, two former U.S. administration officials
(1997–2001/02),
the nuclear deal might offer a more realistic route to the goal of a
nuclear-weapon-free world under joint Indo-U.S. leadership. The obsession
with the
NPT ensures that the good becomes the enemy of the best.

Control of both houses of Parliament bred arrogance and hubris in Mr.
Howard, leading to serially flawed judgments on policy and leadership. Mr.
Rudd will
need to avoid falling into the same trap with Labour governments in every
state, territory and Canberra. Out of power everywhere across the land, the
Liberal-National
coalition will find renewal and regeneration a tough challenge. Contrarians
within the party and effective opposition are necessary for responsive and
accountable government.

Online vote to aid product design
Ian Sample

Innovator wants to replace mass-produced goods with people-power ideas.

If Kohei Nishiyama's wishes are granted, he will be financially independent
by the age of 40, living as an inventor and being woken each morning by his
robot dog. But the 37-year-old Tokyo-based designer and founder of Elephant
Design has a more ambitious dream, one he hopes will change the face of
shopping.

He wants to empty the shelves of dreary, mass-marketed and mass-produced
objects and replace them with products that we — the people — have helped to
develop.
Mr. Nishiyama calls his idea &quot;Design to Order&quot; and the principle is simple.
Anyone with a unique idea, for anything from a robotic web camera to a
magnetic
bathroom mirror, posts an image and description on his website. There,
people can log on to suggest alterations and improvements to the design. If
enough
people vote for the product, he makes a deal with a manufacturer and the
product is made.

&quot;There are so many mass-produced products making it on to the shelves
because that's how large companies do things. Our idea is to give people
what they
want by involving anyone who has a good idea early on in the process,&quot; says
Mr. Nishiyama. &quot;There are a lot of people who have great ideas but they're
not working in the business.&quot;

The scheme has been running in Japan for a few years, and has taken off
among designers who use it to float ideas instead of committing to something
that
may flop. The company has recently set up a test site with retailer Muji to
help develop products for its stores. One idea, for transparent sticky
memos,
was suggested by a 21-year-old student and will be marketed next month. She
stands to get royalties from every pack sold.

Earlier this year, Mr. Nishiyama appointed London-based designers The
Division as the first British consultancy to feed into the project, ahead of
a formal

U.K. launch. The company has submitted three designs to Mr. Nishiyama's test
site at
www.cuusoo.jp/muji
, including a clock that is vague about the time, a set of solar-powered,
glowing garden furniture, and a wastepaper bin that tidies ugly cables
around
work desks.

David Tonge, founder of The Division, said, &quot;Our thinking with the clock was
that mostly these are at work to measure people's efficiency and people are
watched clocking in and clocking out. We wanted something more relaxed for
the home, so the hour hand is on the outside, and like a sundial it's fairly
vague. But in the centre, it displays minutes in a digital form so you can
use it if you're doing something like cooking pasta for 13 minutes.&quot;

&quot;Because it's a new thing and it's experimental, a lot of people are posting
ideas and, it has to be said, some of them are utterly rubbish,&quot; says Mr.
Tonge.

Resist, resist, resist: 'The gift of a crisis'
Beena Sarwar

Those who came of age during General Zia's regime and after may have a sense
of déjÀ vu, but for newcomers into the activist field the sense of outrage
is purer.

Taking to the streets: Human rights activists protesting against the
Emergency during a recent rally in Islamabad.

It may not exactly be a revolution, but the revolutionary zeal is there,
particularly amongst the younger lot. Those who came of age during General
Zia-ul-Haq's
regime and after may have a sense of déjÀ vu, but among newcomers into the
activist field the sense of outrage and betrayal is purer. Something about
the
present situation has fired them up enough to engage in &quot;subversive&quot;
activities such as public demonstrations against the martial law, for which
they know
they can be arrested, tried for treason, or worse.

&quot;We've been gifted with a crisis,&quot; is how Ahsan Jamil, a businessman in
Karachi, analyses it. &quot;In countries where things go well, a certain smugness
or
sense of complacency sets in. In Pakistan, we have not been allowed that
luxury.&quot;

The &quot;judicial crisis&quot; that dominated Pakistani politics since March has much
to do with the general sense of discontent that began building up among
those
who otherwise had nothing much to complain about. This includes many among
the &quot;Musharraf generation&quot; — well-to-do young urbanites for whom the
pre-email,
pre-cell phone and pre-independent television channels era is prehistoric —
corporate bankers and lawyers, chartered accountants, television journalists
(fabulously well-paid compared to their print counterparts), software
engineers and business-people. In general, members of the amorphous,
consumer-oriented
urban middle class that benefited materially from the liberal economic
policy of the Musharraf regime.

General Musharraf's announcement of an &quot;Emergency&quot; on November 3 stunned
many among this otherwise complacent generation — enough to finally act upon
their
convictions. In doing so, many re-grouped through contacts originally formed
during times of natural disaster, such as the Kashmir earthquake. They used
the tools at their fingertips — the internet, e-mail, chat, blogs and
cellphone text messages — to come together, and also to join up with
activists who
have a long (pre-cell phone) history of political struggle for democracy.

Some landed up at the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in Lahore the very
next day for a public meeting to discuss the martial law — and were rounded
up and detained for three days after the police raided the HRCP office.

In Karachi too, the jumble of women's and human rights activists,
journalists, trade union members and workers of small left wing political
parties, who
used to come together under the banner of the Joint Action Committee (JAC),
were joined by those who have never been &quot;activists&quot; before: techies,
artists,
bankers and accountants. They eventually named this diverse, loose coalition
of individuals the People's Resistance. &quot;This is the beginning of a
movement,&quot;
someone said at this meeting.

Whether or not that is the case, many are fired up enough to engage in
actions they have never done before. Some have gone to visit total strangers
at their
homes — the deposed judges of the High Courts — taking flowers in
appreciation of the stand they have taken. &quot;At first I thought this was all
nonsense,&quot;
said a seasoned lawyer, who has been helping to get his colleagues released
from Karachi Central Jail. &quot;But it has made a huge difference to the morale
of these judges. They've never engaged with the public before, and now they
are proudly telling friends that 'civil society' came to visit them.&quot;

Some new activists are using their talents to make and design posters that
they distribute at public meetings, or make stencils to spray graffiti in
public
spaces. Some want to make their presence felt in public with candle-light
vigils and demonstrations. Many turn up at short notice for what are called
&quot;flash
protests&quot; at a given public spot, each armed with his or her banner or
placard. They demonstrate for a pre-determined period of time, and disperse
before
the police arrive.

&quot;I want to collect a million signatures,&quot; said Ali Assad, 26. An unlikely
contender for the term &quot;activist,&quot; this mild-looking, clean-cut young
investment
banker, a graduate of the prestigious Lahore University of Management
Sciences, has purchased several notebooks and is working with friends to
formulate
the text they want to get people to sign, incorporating basic demands such
as &quot;Lift the Martial Law, Restore the Judiciary and Media Independence.&quot; His
banker colleagues think he is slightly mad.

He is &quot;mad&quot; alright — as in angry. Angry at what is happening to his
country. An avid reader, he was already familiar with the works of writers
such as
Eqbal Ahmad and Noam Chomsky, who reinforced his liberal political views and
innate distaste of anti-authoritarianism and religious extremism. But he had
never participated even in the anti-Iraq war protests at while a student at
the LUMS.

So what changed things for him? &quot;The lawyers' movement and the media
coverage … lawyers being beaten on streets and for what? They were fighting
for judiciary;
not for power, unlike political parties.&quot;

The new heroes

The bloodshed on May 12 when the Chief Justice was prevented from coming
into Karachi made Mr. Assad's &quot;blood boil with hatred for what was happening
in
the country.&quot; He was &quot;electrified&quot; by the Islamabad Supreme Court seminar.
&quot;People in their speeches were articulating my sentiments, and suddenly my
heroes
became people like Talat Hussain of Aaj TV, and lawyers like Aitzaz Ahsan
and Munir A. Malik.&quot;

Most importantly, after the PCO orders of November 3, he found like-minded
people with whom he could connect and coordinate. &quot;I just wanted to make my
voice
heard. I felt that in a country where the highest judiciary receives no
protection, what is my 'auqaat' [standing]? It scared me.&quot;

Another unlikely young activist is Adnan Mufti, a chartered accountant, who
is spreading the word among his colleagues. Responding to an e-mail from a
lawyer
in Maine, U.S., he wrote, &quot;These young people are aware of their
limitations, but feel that they must protest in whatever way they can.&quot;

&quot;I won't sit still,&quot; says Mr. Assad. &quot;Maybe 10 years down the line I will be
able to do more. But I will continue to do something.&quot; He likes the Dante
quote
in the advertisement released a few days ago by leading intellectuals and
retired bureaucrats in Lahore: &quot;The hottest places in hell are reserved for
those
who in the time of crisis choose to maintain their neutrality.&quot;

Sarkozy gets tough on internet pirates
Bobbie Johnson and Emilie Boyer

French officials are proposing to cut off the broadband connections of
people who illegally download films or music over the internet.

In France's hardest crackdown yet on online filesharing, President Nicolas
Sarkozy said he was backing a &quot;three strikes&quot; policy against internet
pirates,
while simultaneously announcing a new deal with film and music companies,
which would see access to cultural offerings boosted on the web.

The scheme — drawn up following an independent review by Denis Olivennes,
the head of a French entertainment retailer — involves plans to clamp down
on
piracy by sending offenders a series of e-mail warnings. If ignored, the
culprit could face having their broadband account suspended or even closed.

The new rules will also see entertainment companies drop all copyright
protection on French material, meaning that any music or videos bought
online can
be played on any sort of computer or digital player, although it would also
make the files easier to copy.

The deal was backed by more than 40 signatories, including France's
Education, Justice and Culture Ministers, internet service providers and the
entertainment
industry.

As part of the plans, the French film industry agreed to release DVDs more
swiftly, moving the release date of DVDs from seven and a half months after
their
cinema screening to six months.

Some groups in France said the new scheme was unnecessary, since illegal
downloading is already punishable by up to three years in prison. Opponents,
including
consumer groups and some politicians, fear the deal is too repressive and
poses a threat to civil liberties.

Record labels and film studios, however, welcomed the proposals as the
latest victory in their ongoing war with filesharers, who they blame for the
decline
of CD sales and cinema attendance.

Data for 2005 showed that as broadband penetration rose sharply in France to
well above 20% of households, so did filesharing, while music sales fell
dramatically
by more than a quarter in the 2002-04 period, according to the International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry. — (c) Guardian Newspapers Limited,

A new East Asian focus on India
P.S. Suryanarayana

The atmospherics of the East Asia Summit last week propelled India to the
regional centre stage again.

Is India really central to the East Asia Summit (EAS) — an exclusive
regional forum which is expected to play a key role in shaping the next big
theatre
in world politics? Surely, the latest EAS meeting in Singapore, which
brought India and China, as also Japan, into sharp focus, was not designed
to provide
clues to such a long-term proposition. However, the atmospherics of the
third annual summit of the EAS last week propelled India to the centre stage
of
Greater Ea st Asia in several ways.

The larger geopolitical region covers all the 10 countries of the
Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Japan, the Republic
of Korea,
India, Australia, and New Zealand. The United States, for long the dominant
military power in this wider region, is not a member of the two-year-old
EAS,
which remains wary of letting the Americans on to its diversified but rather
very Asian stage.

Interestingly, it was in an overarching cultural setting that the importance
of being India in Greater East Asia was dramatically illustrated. The
occasion
was the dedication of an exhibition, titled &quot;On the Nalanda Trail,&quot; as an
EAS project. The exhibition — tracing the trail of Buddhism in India, China,
and Southeast Asia — is being organised by Singapore at the Asian
Civilisations Museum in the City-State. The unusual show is aimed at
promoting the establishment
of an international university, through a multilateral treaty, at the old
Nalanda site in India. The proposed university will offer a number of
courses,
including peace and security studies.

India's centrality to the current process of inter-state engagement in
Greater East Asia was best put across by EAS Chairman and Singapore Prime
Minister
Lee Hsien Loong. At a reception hosted by him for the EAS leaders, Mr. Lee
said: &quot;The ancient university in Nalanda was not just devoted to Buddhist
studies.
It was also a first-class educational institution and the most global
university of its time. ... The new Nalanda (university) should strive to
perform
a role consistent with this original ethos and vision. It should be a great
intellectual centre, an icon of the (current) Asian renaissance. ... It
should
also be a centre of civilisational dialogue and inter-faith understanding as
the original Nalanda once was. In this way, the (EAS) Nalanda project can
be an inspiration for the future of Asia.&quot;

Piloting the EAS and other ASEAN-related summits with diplomatic skill,
clear from the way he warded off a Myanmar-related crisis that could have
affected
these events, Mr. Lee saw India's relevance to planet-issues as well.

The East Asia Summit is the only pan-regional platform, as different from
sub-regional groups, where India and China share the high table.
Significantly,
China had earlier joined Japan, the global eco-guru, and the U.S., a
reluctant &quot;leader&quot; on green issues, in issuing a declaration on climate
change. The
occasion was the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum's summit in
Sydney in September. The APEC had then endorsed a set of &quot;aspirational
goals&quot;
as non-binding commitments to reduce the worldwide emissions of greenhouse
gases. So, a general expectation ahead of last week's EAS meeting was that
India,
not an APEC member, could perhaps now be brought into this emerging circle
of key state-players as eco-friendly protagonists of economic growth.

Greenhouse gas emissions

What happened at the EAS was a different story though. Japan, taking off
from its earlier platform of &quot;Cool Earth 50,&quot; now proposed a new package of
measures
to ensure &quot;a sustainable East Asia.&quot; The idea was that Japan could help its
other East Asian partners in adopting eco-friendly but growth-protective
technologies
to ensure the reduction of worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases by half
by 2050. Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's EAS partners did not reject
his offer. However, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said India would be
willing to place a &quot;cap&quot; on greenhouse gas emissions at a level equivalent
only to
the &quot;cap&quot; that the developed bloc might be ready to apply to itself. And,
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao made common cause with Dr. Singh in emphasising
how
growth would remain a priority for both their countries and how they could
consider eco-targets only within the ambit of priorities. In the event,
while
the APEC consensus was not repudiated, the EAS could not create any fresh
consensus that might have covered India as yet another example for the U.S.
to
follow.

If Mr. Wen and Dr. Singh were able to advance the cause of the developing
countries, through their mutually reinforcing presentations at the EAS
meeting,
there was a political reason too for their bonhomie. Shortly before the EAS
convened, they met for the first time after a political crisis rocked New
Delhi
over India's civil nuclear energy deal with the U.S. Even as that crisis
spiralled, it was seen in the U.S.-friendly circles in East Asia as a new
reality
check for assessing, over time, India's credibility as a serious negotiator
in sensitive matters. Against this background, it is understood, on good
authority,
that Mr. Wen was willing to consider cooperation with India on matters
relating to peaceful uses of atomic energy within an overall framework of
non-proliferation.
Later, the Indian side even went public with a formulation that Mr. Wen was
&quot;forthcoming and supportive of international civil nuclear energy
cooperation
with India.&quot;

This China-India meeting and the coincidental commencement of talks between
New Delhi and the International Atomic Energy Agency set the stage for the
EAS
deliberations. And, Mr. Lee's commendation of India and China for their
&quot;eloquent presentations&quot; on their shared concerns about economic growth as
&quot;a priority&quot;
virtually put India back on the East Asian stage as a serious player.
