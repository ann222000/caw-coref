Joanne  pranked me but good yesterday, but you'll have to go to her blog to read about it because I'm too disgusted by the whole thing.

People get an unnatural joy from tricking me or proving me wrong. I think it's twisted, and sometimes it hurts my feelings. I'm only human, even if I don't give that impression much. [Insert Human League song here.]

I had a nice visit with Samantha on Thursday. Although a four-hour visit with the person who has been your best friend for almost nine years is hardly adequate. Even though we talk on the phone and email quite often it is a different experience entirely in person.

As always, I am able to tell her things I tell no one else, often saying things for the first time out loud. I can surprise myself, sometimes, with the things I come up with. For example, my current crush. I'm falling for this guy pretty hard, but I don't think the stars are aligned at this point. I'm waiting for a sign, though. (The phrase "stars are aligned" is actually a stand-in for several factors about which I don't feel like elucidating publicly at this time.) If things work out in my favor maybe I'll end up going on a date or two where I don't feel like I'm having a root canal. [Best case scenario, he'd ask me out. I've been taking a lot of initiative here in Seattle in terms of occasional dating. It would be flattering to have someone else actively show interest for a minute or two.]

In addition to being brief, this was also a bittersweet visit. It was the first time I'd seen Sam since she started her relationship with her current partner. While I love her and am glad she's happy, it is always difficult, I think, to see a former lover's face light up when she's on the phone with her current lover the way you used to see her face light up when she looked at you. But it was fleeting, and then she whooped my behind in cards.

Whenever I visit a friend at the airport as they're flying through I end up at the same restaurant. I think it has a chicken roasting in the reception area. Maybe it was a ham. Anyway, it was a dead critter on a stick.

If all goes well all will be revealed on Monday. Well, not all revealed, but my exciting surprise will be revealed. But I'm not going to tell  Joanne , because she keeps bugging me about it. And she tricked me. Bad  Joanne .

Work is going well, but as we're only six months out from  the festival  I need to really get to work starting Tuesday. Which is why I'm "hiring" a volunteer sponsorship assistant next week. Interviews are on Wednesday and we have a very strong candidate I'm excited about. (And a couple of reasonably strong candidates who I'd like to get involved even if I go with the first candidate.) It's an embarrassment of riches, so I guess I can't go wrong.

I made a soup today, and now my windows are all steamed up. I think it's raining out, though.

His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, died today. Someone please explain to me why I had to tell Catholics (practicing  and  otherwise) about the papal selection procedure. And explain to me why I even knew about the papal selection procedure prior to reading  The DaVinci Code .

In unrelated news (maybe), anyone want to play  Trivial Pursuit ?

And now a little Zen story*:
The first task I was given was to sweep the garden with a bamboo broom.... So I grasped my broom and swept mightily and soon had a mountain of leaves. I asked, "Roshi, where should I put all this rubbish?" hoping he would see how good I had been. He immediately roared, "Leaves are not rubbish!... Go to the shed and bring any empty charcoal sacks you find there." Coming back, I found the Roshi vigorously raking through the pile of leaves so that any stones or gravel fell to the bottom. He then took the sacks and filled them to the very last leaf, packing them tightly with his feet. "Now go put these back in the shed," he said. "They're kindling for the bath fire."

When I ... came back I saw the Roshi squatting on the ground picking out the small stones from what remained. When he had carefully gathered them together to the last tiny pebble, he said, "Now put these beneath the eaves."... I was still quite sure that the remaining lumps of earth and scraps of moss could serve no useful purpose. Yet the Roshi just collected them together without fuss and placed them on the palm of his hand. Searching patiently, he put the lumps of earth into depressions in the ground, then firmed them in with his foot until nothing remained. He said, "Now do you understand a little? Originally, there is no rubbish in either men or things." This was the first teaching I received from Zuigan Roshi [master of the Daishun temple in Kyoto, Japan].

The Roshi's words that originally there is no rubbish either in men or in things actually comprise the basic truth of Buddhism.
