The Low-Tech Lynching of Clarence Thomas

By Jerome Doolittle
Created Sep 30 2007 - 11:20pm

As Justice Clarence Thomas flogs his million-dollar memoir, sound bites from
his 1991 nomination hearings have been surfacing in the news - fragrant
bubbles from the swamps of George Herbert Walker Bush's administration.

The saddest of these golden oldies was the nominee's anguished cry that the
hearings were &quot;a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks.&quot; Is it even remotely
possible that Justice Thomas actually imagines himself to be an uppity
black? Can he be unaware that he was the least uppity black that Poppy Bush
had been able to find in all the land?

Of course it's possible, and of course Thomas is unaware of it. All of us
lie to ourselves, and most of us lie to others. But only a few of us get the
chance to lie to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath. Clarence Thomas
is one of them. The Pubic Hair Test proves it.

Fans of political theater will recall that Professor Anita Hill had charged
her former boss at the Department of Education with a pattern of sexual
harassment which included showing her a Coke can with a pubic hair stuck to
it.

But Judge Thomas swore, no doubt truthfully insofar as the truth is
vouchsafed unto him, that he had never in his life done such an
ungentlemanly thing.

How could we, the millions of spectators at this morality play, have known
what to think? Was it the stern federal judge who was telling the truth, or
was it the demure law professor?

Only the Pubic Hair Test could settle the question:

Could Professor Hill could have made up a story so peculiar? In other words,
was there anything in the accuser's much-investigated background to suggest
that she was a pathological liar? Did she suffer from hallucinations? Was
she &quot;creative?&quot; Perhaps even an aspiring novelist?

And if she were such a fabulist, as the Republicans pretended to think,
would the Coke can invention do more damage to her enemy than any other lie
she might have dreamed up?

No to the first question. Professor Hill seemed depressingly literal and
humorless. It was hard to imagine her engaged in a flight of fancy. (The
only suggestion to the contrary came from a young black man who seemed
principally interested in reciting his resume on national TV.)

And no to the second question, too. The tale of the pubic hair and the Coke
can was so meaningless and bizarre that it could not have been an invention.
If Professor Hill wanted to destroy the nominee with lies, she was certainly
smart enough to have stuck to such old standbys as indecent exposure,
groping, and dirty pictures.

The Pubic Hair Test therefore indicated with zero probability of error that
this particular woman could not and would not have invented this particular
senseless, incomprehensible story.

God knows whose pubic hair that was, or how it got on that Coke can, or what
message the future Supreme Court justice thought it conveyed, or what made
him imagine that his weird brandishing of it might be seductive - but the
incident plainly happened pretty much the way Professor Hill said it did.

And Uncle Thomas had been lynched long, long before the Senate Judiciary
Committee ever heard of him. He had slung the rope over a branch at an early
age, poor man, and then hoisted himself all the way up to the Supreme Court.
