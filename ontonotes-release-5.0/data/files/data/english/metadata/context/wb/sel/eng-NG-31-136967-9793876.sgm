***********************************************************

Brothers, you are Christ to the world. Christ has no hands but your
hands to touch and bless and heal, no feet but your feet to lead men in
the path of truth, no arms but your arms to gather the scattered, no
tongue but your tongue to cheer a suffering mankind, no heart but your
heart to love, to pity, to care.  --Francis of Assisi

&quot;He'll work in ways you may not recognize or understand. And He is big
enough to do the things you have labeled impossible.  He has enough
power.  He has enough time.  He is bigger than your problem.  Believe in
Him more than in what you may see.  Trust in Him more than what you may
feel. You can question.  He can handle your questions.  God is highly
confident of His own plans. He can do everything but fail.&quot; - Kathy Troccoli

Looking at circumstance brings despair; looking to God brings hope.

How God answers prayer: yes, no, wait, I have something better in store
for you.

God is completely reliable.

Lost, need directions, ask God.

By living in love, every believer can bring glory to God.

Praise God, no matter what.

God promises to guide us day by day.

God can take a sour heart and make it sweet.

***********************************************************

We Will Not Fear
In these times of great uncertainty let's always remember, our Heavenly
Father is the Creator of the Universe.  He formed the Heavens and the
Earth out of nothing, and, as we place our trust in Him, He has given a
basic promise: &quot;Never will I leave you, never will I forsake you&quot;
(Hebrews 13:5).  His desire is for us to draw nearer in our love and
worship, and allow His Spirit to remove all fear.
Psalm 46:1-3 &quot;God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in
trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the
mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and
foam and the mountains quake with their surging.&quot;
Although we are uncertain what tomorrow may bring, we ought to have
confidence in the One who really controls tomorrow.  If we believe Jesus
died for our sin, rose again in victory over death, and is seated at the
right hand of the Father - if we surrender our life to who He is and
what He has done - our eternal home has been firmly established; &quot;Our
citizenship is in Heaven&quot; (Philippians 3:20).  As a child of the
Sovereign King, as one who believes in our eternal future, we no longer
have reason to fear; &quot;For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a
slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship&quot; (Romans 8:15).
We no longer have a reason, but still we fear.  The unknown is scary and
makes us feel out of control.  But as we pray for an end to violence,
and as we strive to make this world safer, better educated, and more
prosperous, we must understand there is only one true solution to our fear.
Our fear will only be removed as we love the Lord with ALL our heart,
soul, mind and strength.  When we understand that our life is not our
own, we will love with a complete abandonment to His desire.  We will
pray and live each day with the surrender demonstrated by Christ;
&quot;Father...not My will, but Yours be done&quot; (Luke 22:42).  As we live each
day to bring Him glory and honor, fear WILL begin to fade: &quot;There is no
fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear&quot; (1 John 4:18).
Yes, these days contain some uncertainty.  If we continue to focus on
what we can see, there will always be uncertainties.  But our faith,
hope, and joy are in His eternal glory; not in this world which will one
day pass away.  Let's refuse to allow our fear of the unknown cripple
our service for God.  There is still much work He has for us to do.
Let's pray that our love will increase, that our worship will intensify,
and that we will boldly stand up and proclaim, &quot;We will not fear!&quot;
Have a Christ Centered Day!  --Steve Troxel

YOU CAN HAVE IT... BUT... I WANT IT BACK!!!
If you have children, or are around young children, then you'll
recognize this:
Two toddlers are sitting in the floor playing. They are at Suzie's
house, and the floor is filled with toys. Suzie is playing with her
blocks, and Davey is trying to decide what to play with. Suzie tells
Davey, &quot;Davey, you can play with ANY of my toys. I'm playing with the
blocks, but you can use ANYTHING that you want&quot;...so Davey takes her up
on it. He picks up her toy telephone, and begins calling his little
sister...and he's having a great time...such a great time that Suzie
suddenly wants to play with the telephone, so she reaches out and grabs
the phone. Davey, of course, is upset, and tells her that HE was playing
with the phone because she told him that he could use anything that he
wanted to. Her response is, &quot;I know that I gave it to you, but I want it
back to play with it myself&quot;.
Don't we do the same thing with God? He tells us, in one of my favorite
verses (1 Peter 5:7) to &quot;cast your cares upon the Lord, for He cares for
you.&quot; But how often do we really cast them to Him, and allow Him to keep
them? Don't we take them back to &quot;play with them ourselves for a while?&quot;
I don't know about you, but I'm really good at giving God the burdens of
my heart, but taking them back from Him and worrying with them for a
bit, and then giving them back to Him. I'm good at SAYING that I'm
giving God my cares and worries, but I don't seem to truly let them
go...sound familiar?
Worried about your family? Concerned with your finances? Got a health
problem keeping you up late? Problems with your relationship with your
spouse? Your Boss getting on your nerves?
Philippians 4:6-9 says &quot;Have no anxiety about anything, but in
everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which passes all
understanding, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is
just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if
there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think
about these things. What you have learned and received and heard and
seen in me, do; and the God of peace will be with you.&quot;
There it is, my friends - in simple English - by prayer, and in faith,
give your concerns to God. Then, again by prayer and in faith, allow Him
to KEEP them, and watch as His will is done with your requests. Remember
that sometimes He says wait, and sometimes He also says no. The peace
that is promised will come as you allow Him to move in your life, and as
you align your life with His will.
Want God to help you carry the load? Then give Him your concerns, and
DON'T TAKE THEM BACK!
Have a care-free, Jesus filled day!  --Bill Champion

LESSON FROM A HUMMINGBIRD
I want to share with you something that happened to me a couple of years
ago.  I was doing some yardwork around the house.  After I finished, I
went through the garage to get back into the house.
But, as I was climbing the stairs, I heard a loud fluttering of wings
above me.  My first thought was that a large moth or small bat had
gotten itself trapped, but then I realized it was a tiny bird - a
hummingbird!  Its wings were flapping with great intensity as the bird
slammed itself repeatedly into the ceiling.  It was clearly intent on
flying upward, but there was no way out in that direction  No doubt the
poor bird had to be exhausted, and it was evident that it wasn't going
to find its way out by itself.
Using my hand, I carefully guided the hummingbird out into the middle of
the garage, thinking it would have no trouble finding an exit with the
garage door wide open.  The bird quickly found a resting spot, but when
it tried to leave, it once again headed upward, banging itself into the
ceiling over and over.  Could it not see the wide open door with freedom
just a few feet away?  Why was it intent on searching for an escape
route straight up?  Finally, with a little assistance from my son, the
bird made its way outside.
I couldn't help but think how much like that hummingbird we all are.
The difference is that our search is for happiness and the &quot;meaning of
life.&quot;  We search in all the wrong places over and over again, looking
to material goods or immorality or addictive substances, all without
success.  And instead of seeing the wide open door that God has
provided, we continue to painfully beat our heads in frustration.
We try again and again without finding the happiness we crave, so we try
even harder.  We work longer hours to collect more &quot;stuff&quot;, we sample
something a little bit stronger.  Why are we so blind that we cannot see
what God has made available?  He wants us to find the freedom of living
for Him.  Time and again, He gently nudges us in the right direction.
But we're so blind (or stubborn?).
&quot;In the Lord I take refuge...Flee like a bird to your mountain.&quot;  (Psalm
11:1)
Lord, please open our eyes.  Help us to see the frustration of our
attempts to seek happiness apart from you.  Help us to see the need to
yield ourselves to your nudges as you seek to move us in the right
direction.   Thank you for the blessings that you have made so richly
available and that you desire for us to enjoy.  In Jesus' name, amen.
Have a great day!  --Alan Smith

Billows
Okay, who really knows what &quot;billows&quot; are? Many have sung words from the
count-your-many-blessings song: &quot;When upon life's billows you are
tempest tossed, when you are discouraged thinking all is lost.&quot; Have you
ever been tossed upon a billows? Tempestuously tossed?
The word &quot;billows&quot; isn't an everyday word, but if used in context, the
meaning would be clear: Billows are shoving the cruise ship around. &quot;The
billows are frothy---not a good fishing day,&quot; said the salty sailor. The
billows splashed into the leaky John boat causing the fisherman to bail
with vigor.
So, &quot;billows&quot; means waves, usually big one roiling and rolling. And
life-billows must mean huge happenings that could cause drowning. Sea
water can cause harm or good. The sea supports its world and
inhabitants. But many humans, alien to life in the water, have been lost
at sea. Humans can float on the sea, gather food from it or drown in it.
So, now that billows are in mind, what can we do if we get tossed on
one? I've heard folks say that when bad times assault them, they can't
seem to pray. I've experienced that.
Others have told me, whenever pain, loss or devastation comes along,
they find reading their Bible difficult. I've experienced that, too.
When the brain is fogged by bad circumstances, pages can be turned but
not comprehended because the mind is mired in despair.
But what do you do when the presence of God seems far away? For Jesus
and his disciples, when life got crowded or dangerous, that's when they
fled to be alone for a day or night---alone with God.
When Jesus heard of his cousin John the Baptist's beheading, he
&quot;withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place&quot; (Matthew 14: 13).
Oswald Chambers says when &quot;God gets us alone,&quot; that's when his most
effective teaching occurs. When Jesus walked this earth, he and his
disciples were constantly surrounded by problems of others, what Robert
J. Wicks calls, secondary stress in his book Crossing the Desert.
But after a few intense days, Jesus would say something such as, &quot;Come
with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest&quot; (Mark 6:31).
They'd get away by themselves and over and over the same scenario is
presented.
When the disciples were alone with Jesus, who is God, they asked
questions. Isn't that what we do when something puzzling happens? We ask
a lot of questions, aloud and in our minds.
So when a toss on the billows happens, the lesson from Jesus and the
disciples is to get alone with God. And who said questions to God,
aren't prayers. Questions communicate our sincerest thoughts to God.
Then, we can present ourselves to listen for answers.
If you find yourself in the swell of a billows, spend time alone with
God, it's where he does his most significant work. He teaches survival
techniques, passes out swim fins, and teaches us to float.  --Cathy's

One Day at a Time
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about
itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.. ---Matthew 6:34
It has been said that there are two days that people worry most about
but should actually worry least about: Yesterday and Tomorrow. We worry
about yesterday -- the mistakes we've made and what we would like to do
over or differently. Yet, there is nothing we can do to change
yesterday. Our worries are wasted.  We also worry about tomorrow -- the
problems it may bring and the challenges we may face. Yet, we cannot
control tomorrow. It is out of our grasp. So again, our worries are
wasted. When we do not waste our worries on yesterday or tomorrow, it
frees us to live in the present -- today. Today, we are able to make
decisions about our life. Today, we can set our course, set off in a
direction or alter our course, if necessary. Sure, we will still make
our share of mistakes. And, we will still have worries. Each day brings
enough to be concerned about. Still, seldom are life's concerns
unbearable today. Our worries become unbearable when we add the wasted
worries of yesterday and tomorrow.
Jesus instructs us to live one day at a time. He knew that so much of
what we worry about is out of our control. He wanted us to understand
that God gives us today. And, as we live our lives seeking Him, we are
in a safe place. Jesus promises that our heavenly Father will provide us
with everything we need. When I'm tempted to worry about any of life's
concerns, I find that it helps to remind myself of the many times I've
given in to worry -- and how things never came to pass as I had feared
-- which is actually the vast majority of the time!
Do your best to live today -- just one day at a time! And, when you find
yourself tempted to worry, remind yourself of Jesus' words, &quot;Your
heavenly Father knows all your needs, and he will give you all you need
from day to day if you live for him and make the Kingdom of God your
primary concern.&quot; (Matthew 6:32-33, NLT.)  --Jim Liebelt

Perfectly Kept in the Lord.
There are so many products on the market today. Some make unbelievable
claims. They are weather-proof, rust-proof, flame-retardant,
slip-resistant, tempered, protected, stain-guarded, and unbreakable.
They are stronger, last longer, provide more, and are virtually
indestructible! They have been designed by man to stand up to, and hold
up against, forces that would otherwise leave them broken, shattered,
torn, burnt, and saturated. They can beat the things they are most
vulnerable to, just because of their design. Amazing!
You on the other hand are human. You can not be re-engineered,
re-designed or safety-proofed. You can, however, enjoy the grace and
glory of the Jesus Christ. In Him lies the greatest protection of all.
He will strengthen you, transform your mind, keep you safe, deliver you,
uphold you, and raise you up! Don't put your trust in man-made
protection and engineering. Put your trust in Jesus Christ to keep you
today and all your days, forever and ever.
&quot;If the LORD delights in a man's way, he makes his steps firm; though
he stumbles, he will not fall, for the LORD upholds him with his hand.&quot;
Psalms 37:23-24  --The Daily Journey

Divine Deposits
So teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. -
Psalm 90:12
Let's say that your phone rings tomorrow morning, and it is a call from
the manager of your bank. He tells you, &quot;I received a very unusual call
the other day. Someone who loves you very much and is quite wealthy has
given you a large sum of money. This anonymous donor will be depositing
86,400 cents into your account every single day.&quot;
&quot;How is that again?&quot; you ask.
&quot;Every single day, this person will deposit 86,400 cents into your account.&quot;
Is that much money? you wonder at first. Then you get out your
calculator and figure out that it amounts to $864 every day. That is
pretty good, you're thinking.
&quot;But there is one condition,&quot; the banker continues. &quot;You have to spend
it every single day. You can't save it up. You can't add it to the next
day's balance. Every day, you must spend that money. What is not spent
will be taken away. This person will do this each and every day, but the
condition is that you must spend the money.&quot;
So you go back to your calculator and figure out that $864 times 7
equals $6,048 per week. That amount, multiplied by 52, comes to $314,496
per year. That is a pretty good deal. And that is also a fantasy.
So let's deal with reality. Someone who loves you very much deposits
into your bank of time 86,400 seconds every single day. That someone is
God. And the condition is that you must spend it. You can't save up time
today and apply it toward tomorrow -- there is no such thing as a
27-hour day. Each and every day, you have the opportunity to invest your
precious commodity of time.  --Harvest Ministries

***********************************************************

THE BIG PICTURE
EPHESIANS 5:16
Mary David Fisher said, &quot;The length of our life is less important than
its depth.&quot;
Her saying reminds of something that musician Eubie Blake said on his
100th birthday: &quot;If I'd known I was gonna live this long, I'd have taken
better care of myself.&quot;
We never know how much time we have left, either in this life or in this
ministry, but the question of longevity isn't nearly as crucial as the
question of intensity. Even though quantity is an unknown variable;
quality must remain consistent.
I think of this when I spend time with my kids. They're out of the house
now, living in other cities, starting new lives. When we're together,
it's only for a few days -- sometimes only a few hours. When I see them,
I forget about what's on TV and my cell phone gets turned off. I want to
make every second count.
We need to approach our lives and our work the same way. Paul used a
phrase in Ephesians 5 that is translated in the NIV as &quot;make the most of
every opportunity.&quot; The King James uses the phrase, &quot;redeeming the
time.&quot; In order to do this, we need to understand two things:
1. Our lives fit into the Big Picture of God's plan.
2. The Big Picture is played out one frame at a time: one day, one hour,
one moment at a time.
If you're like most of us, your plate is already full. At any moment
there are a dozen things you could be doing. The important question is:
&quot;Of everything on my list, what is the best thing I can do right now?&quot;
You can't answer this question without a good idea about where your life
is going. Grasping the Big Picture empowers you to shape your plans day
by day.
So your day is full. Maybe you'll spend some time today cleaning up
yesterday's mess. Maybe you'll spend some time putting out today's
fires. These things are inevitable. But the biggest &quot;maybe&quot; is if you'll
spend some time today preparing for what your life will become tomorrow.
If we're not careful, we can spend all of our time focused on yesterday
and today. The result is that the Big Picture stuff doesn't get done --
until it becomes another fire to put out or another mess to clean up.
(Need examples? Waiting until December 10 to decide how you'll pay for
Christmas; waiting until you're 62 to decide how you'll pay for
retirement; waiting until September 15 to decide who will speak at your
Fall Retreat ... and so on.)
Redeem the time. Make the most of every opportunity. Think about the
hours you have at your disposal. What's the best thing you can do -- not
just for the crises you're facing now, but for the life you want to have
in the months ahead and in the years to come?
Determining the most important thing to do at any given moment isn't as
easy as it seems. It takes practice, discernment and wisdom. And it
takes a grasp of the Big Picture. The pay off is that your days have
meaning, and your life tells a story that brings glory to God.  --Steve May

WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?
This morning I put moisturizer on to hide my wrinkles, makeup to cover
my age spots, and mascara to make my lashes look longer. I thought about
all the effort I put into disguising the real me. I color my gray hair,
pluck my chin hairs, and buy clothes that will (hopefully) make me look
thinner. Heaven forbid if someone should see what I really look like!
And it's not just my outside appearance I try to hide. I wonder how
often people see me for who I really am. Do they see only what I want
them to see? When I lose my cool, my real attitudes come spewing out and
it's usually not the side of me that I like to show people.
We all pretend at times to be something we're not. It's natural to hide
our faults so people will like us. Just like the characters at Disney
World, we wear masks to disguise our real selves and please those around
us. We may be able to fool some of the people some of the time, but we
can't fool God. He sees through our disguises into our hearts.
Jesus told the Pharisees (in Matthew 23:27) &quot;You are like whitewashed
tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of
dead men's bones and everything unclean. On the outside you appear to
people as righteous, but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and
wickedness.&quot;
God knows our thoughts and motives (Psalm 139). The prophet Isaiah wrote
(in Isaiah 64) that all the good deeds we do to cover up our sinful side
and all of our best efforts to look good appear no better than filthy
rags to God. Sound discouraging?
Here's the GOOD news: Even though God knows who we really are, He loves
us in spite of our failures and weaknesses. He wants to clothe us in
&quot;garments of salvation&quot; and cover us with &quot;robes of righteousness.&quot;
(Isaiah 61:10)
Galatians 3:27 says that when you're baptized, you &quot;clothe&quot; yourself
with Christ. You don't need a mask or a costume to disguise your real
self. If you want something to cover up your bad side or if you need
someone to hide behind, it can be Jesus. You can be covered by God's
grace, salvation, and righteousness. And, unlike worldly clothes, these
garments last for eternity. When you put these on, they don't just cover
your faults and disguise you - they make you a whole new person (2
Corinthians 5:17). What a relief! Instead of trying to hide the real
you, let God change you from the inside out into something better. He
can give you a new heart (Ezekiel 26:36) with new desires. He'll create
a new spirit within you. Then you won't have to worry about pretending,
hiding, or covering up.
With all your failures and faults, you may feel like an ugly caterpillar
right now; but with God's power, you can be transformed into a new
creation, like a beautiful butterfly!  --Marsha Jordan

There Is Always The Promise Of Daylight....
Even in the winter, even in the midst of the storm, the sun is still
there. Somewhere, up above the clouds, it still shines and warms and
pulls at the life buried deep inside the brown branches and frozen
earth. The sun is there! Spring will come! The clouds cannot stay
forever.  --Gloria Gaither
Hosea 6:3 NIV  &quot;Let us acknowledge the LORD; let us press on to
acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises, he will appear; he will
come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the
earth.&quot;
I find the month of February to be difficult as I reside in north
central Canada and February is very much still the dead of winter. The
comfort of Christmas is far behind me. The days are short, the weather
is often bone chilling cold, so cold that snow covered sidewalks, and
roads have no opportunity to thaw naturally. As there are always a few
people who do not clear their sidewalks, I am trapped on my own block,
unable to take care of the daily tasks such as banking, shopping and
such as my scooter cannot navigate across deep snow. As a result, I am
isolated and outside of church on Sundays and a weekly small group
meeting, I rarely have contact with the 'outside' world if not for the
internet. All too often, I struggle with melancholy and self-pity but
God has provided me with weapons in which to do battle against these
destructive and dangerous foes.
The joy of the Lord is one weapon. (Nehemiah 8:10b) As I deliberately
choose to rejoice in the Lord, He strengthens me. At times, it is hard
going for me to be thankful within my own circumstances but God is
faithful. Often, at such times, I am given the opportunity to join with
another person as they rejoice in the midst of a summer experience in
their lives even as I am in the midst of the chill and darkness of a
winter experience. I am given two choices. I can truly rejoice and give
thanks to God for what He is doing in their lives or I can choose to
become jealous, bitter and resentful of their time of outward blessing.
In the natural, February is mid-summer in Australia and New Zealand.
Many of my Down-under and Kiwi friends will share photographs and
stories of their weekends spent camping on the beach and fellowshipping
with friends at outdoor cafes during the workweek. While I allow myself
a certain measure of wistful &quot;I wish I was there&quot; moments, I truly am
thankful to God for His blessings in their lives. As I pour over their
photos and read their stories, I find myself basking in the sun along
with them and I my faith is strengthened, because I know that the same
God who blesses them will bless me as well, in due season.
In the same way, when friends are experiencing so much great
fruitfulness and harvest in their own lives that they find themselves
unable to contain all the rich bounty, God asks me to rejoice with them
in their blessing, no matter what my own personal circumstance may be. I
know that the same spring rains that falls upon them will fall upon me
once again, washing away the soot and grime. If I remain faithful and
pure of heart, in due season, I will see the promise of new life and new
growth in the small seedlings within my spirit that lay dormant during
the winter. I have learned that bitterness, resentment and self-pity do
nothing to lift the 'gloomy clouds' of a spiritual &quot;February&quot; in my
life. If anything, these sins only harden the soil of my heart, making
it difficult, if not impossible for new growth to spring forth at God's
appointed time.  --Katherine Walden

Small Straws In A Soft Wind by Marsha Burns
I am making a clear distinction between that which is holy and that
which is vile.  Move into the days and weeks before you with your eyes
wide open, for these are the days when the fires of purification are
burning white-hot, testing and revealing each one's work for what it
is.  Refuse to try to justify or white-wash any unrighteous motives or
behavior.  Let the fire burn and consume all that is ungodly.  I am with
you, says the Lord, to bring you through this time of severe testing.
Jeremiah 15:19 Therefore thus says the LORD: &quot;If you return, then I will
bring you back; you shall stand before Me; If you take out the precious
from the vile, you shall be as My mouth...&quot;

My people, be cautious, and watch for the enemy to send deception,
perversion, and seduction into your midst.  Do not be moved by any grand
scheme that seems too good to be true, for indeed it is not true.  The
devil's purpose at this time is to pull you off course and cause you to
get your eyes and hopes on unrealistic plans created by your
psychological and emotional needs.  Refuse to be moved by fantasy, but
rather rise up in the realm of the Spirit to know the truth.  Take an
even strain and wait for further developments before making important
decisions that will set the stage for long-term consequences.  This is a
season when your decisions carry extraordinary significance.  Proceed
with caution, says the Lord.  Ezekiel 13:10  Because, indeed, because
they have seduced My people, saying, 'Peace!' when there is no
peace----and one builds a wall, and they plaster it with untempered
mortar ---- say to those who plaster it with untempered mortar, that it
will fall. There will be flooding rain, and you, O great hailstones,
shall fall; and a stormy wind shall tear it down.

Beloved, come deliberately into My presence, for the days have been
hectic and have taken much energy to endure.  Come, I say, and be
renewed, refreshed, and rejuvenated.  Allow Me to bathe you in My
life-giving presence and wash away all defilement.  Come into a
supernatural rest and restoration.  You will need the strength that I
will impart to face the challenges of the days before you.  Quiet your
soul, separate yourself from the noisy demands, and come now, says the
Lord.  Acts 3:19 &quot;Repent therefore and be *converted, that your sins may
be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence
of the Lord.&quot;
*Note:  converted is defined as turning back to God.

Take another discerning look at those things that require your attention
at this time.  Be reminded that chaotic conditions will reveal specific
places where order must be established.  Take first things first and
systematically do what is necessary to eliminate the dysfunction and
confusion caused by disorder.  I will lead you in a step by step process
that will elevate you to a new level of experience and power as you
yield to the leading of My Spirit, says the Lord.  Psalms 37:23 The
steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD, and He delights in his way.

ALWAYS AND FOREVER
Always and forever I'll walk with Thee,
Standing in Your shadow so blessed and free.
Knowing You'll guide me all through the day
With Your comforting hand to lead the way
I praise You Lord for all You've done
For my life's path and victories won!
There's no greater friend that I could find
Than You my Savior with love divine!
My Life forever Yours will be
For all You gave on Calvary!
This love could never be repaid
Your Grace has taken me all the way!
Thank you for forgiving me
And opening my eyes so I can see.
That Grace and Love will over flow
When always and forever with You I'll go!
Always and forever I will follow You,
Always and forever for your love so True!

We complain about the cross we bear but don't realize it is preparing us
for whatever is up ahead that God can see and we can't.
Whatever your cross, whatever your pain,
there will always be sunshine after the rain....
Perhaps you may stumble, perhaps even fall;
God's always ready, to answer your call....
He knows every heartache, He sees every tear,
a word from His lips, can calm every fear...
Your sorrows may linger, throughout the night,
But suddenly vanish, come dawn's early light...
The Savior is waiting, somewhere above,
to give you His grace, and send you His love...

In The Beginning To Amen
There's a book we call the Bible it contains God's Holy Word.
&gt;From Genesis to Revelation, the most amazing things I've heard.
It tells of earth's creation from, &quot;In the beginning to Amen&quot;.
And how God became flesh to save this world from sin
Out of the dust God formed Adam,
&gt;From Adam's rib He made Eve
Then placed them in a garden, and met their every need
When along came a serpent, and he told Eve a lie
Did God say, if you eat that fruit, surely you would die?
Soon man became so evil, it grieved God in his heart
So He told Noah to go and build an ark
After Noah, his family and the animals, all had entered in
God shut the door and flooded the earth to
Cleanse this world from sin
All throughout the Bible men were called to do God's will
But Jesus paid for all our sins upon Golgotha's Hill
When He said, &quot;It is finished&quot;, nothing else could be done
He has the keys to Death and Hell, the battle has been won.
Today's the day of salvation so come to Jesus now
Soon every tongue shall confess and every knee shall bow
To praise the King of all kings, in Heaven He will reign
Always and forever we'll praise his holy name.
God wrote the words in my heart
To Him I give all the praise and glory
In The Beginning To Amen

DO WE MATTER TO GOD?
It does matter what happens to you, my friend. Let me repeat. IT DOES
MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU. You matter to God. Can you believe that???
You DO matter to God. What happens to you is a concern to Almighty God.
I am not much on poems, however, recently in going through a rough time,
the Lord let my eyes fall on this most simply put poem. It lifted my
heart's attitude. The poet put it like this:
&quot;My child, I know thy sorrows,
Thine every grief I share;
I know how thou are tested,
And, what is more-I care.
Think not I am indifferent
To what affecteth thee;
Thy wale and woe are mattersof deep concern to Me.
But child, I have a purposeIn all that I allow;
I ask thee then to trust Me,Though all seem dark just now.
How often thou hast asked Me To purge away thy dross;
But this refining processInvolves for thee - a cross
There is not another pathway If thou would'st really be
Conformed unto the image Of Him who died for thee.
Thou canst not be like JesusTill self is crucified;
And as a daily processThe cross must be applied.&quot;
The thing that keeps me going often times is the belief of what I have
just penned. God does care about me.
So, the things that I go through -call it &quot;crosses&quot; if you will are
known to God.
May I pray for you?
God, how awesome you are. How wonderful it is to know that this reader
is known of you. You not only know their name and place of calling, but
are aware of their situation. Bless I pray with the assurance of your
promise of your presence IN IT ALL. Amen  --Words For Courageous Living

For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his
life for me will find it.  Matthew 16:25

18 Yet the LORD longs to be gracious to you; he rises to show you
compassion. For the LORD is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait
for him! 19 O people of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no
more. How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he
hears, he will answer you. 20 Although the Lord gives you the bread of
adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no
more; with your own eyes you will see them. 21 Whether you turn to the
right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying,
&quot;This is the way; walk in it.&quot;  Isaiah 30:18-21

It seems to be a fact of life that when I want to do what is right, I
inevitably do what is wrong.  I love to do God's will so far as my new
nature is concerned; but there is something else deep within me, in my
lower nature, that is at war with my mind and wins the fight and makes
me a slave to the sin that is still within me.  In my mind I want to be
God's willing servant but instead I find myself still enslaved to sin.
So you see how it is: my new life tells me to do right, but the old
nature that is still inside me loves to sin.  Oh, what a terrible
predicament I'm in!  Who will free me from my slavery to this deadly
lower nature?  Thank God!  It has been done by Jesus Christ our Lord.
He has set me free.  Romans 7:21-25

21 &quot;Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way prosperity will
come to you. 22 Accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words
in your heart.  Job 22:21-22

But you, dear friends, build yourselves up in your most holy faith and
pray in the Holy Spirit. Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for
the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life. Be
merciful to those who doubt; snatch others from the fire and save them;
to others show mercy, mixed with fear---hating even the clothing stained
by corrupted flesh.  Jude 1:20-23

Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our
troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort
we ourselves have received from God.  2 Corinthians 1:3-4

You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's own
people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called
you out of darkness into his marvelous light.  1 Peter 2:9

Let everything that breathes praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!  Psalm 150:6

***********************************************************

Stand in the Ways
Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No! They were not
at all ashamed; Nor did they know how to blush. Therefore they shall
fall among those who fall; at the time I punish them, they shall be cast
down,&quot; says the LORD. Thus says the LORD: &quot;Stand in the ways and see,
and ask for the old paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; then
you will find rest for your souls. But they said, 'We will not walk in
it.' - Jeremiah 6:15-16.
What is wrong with our world? I believe the immorality that we are
seeing that is so abundant everywhere is a result of being on the wrong
path. Somewhere along the way, we have gotten off course. When I was
growing up, I was in a nominally Christian family. However, I have
learned I have ancestors who were very devoted to the Lord.
Somewhere along the way the children of the devout have gotten off
course and it has affected their children and their children's children
and on and on. It will continue to have a negative impact upon our
lives, unless, we do what? Unless we &quot;Stand in the ways.&quot; Stop going
down the wrong path. &quot;Ask for the old paths.&quot; Ask the Lord to help us to
find the right path for our lives and to give us the power to live godly
lives as many of our ancestors once did.
In our local newspapers, they usually have a report of those who have
been arrested for various offenses. Sadly, I now see many familiar names
not just of former clients but even more sad is the names of their
children. Talking to law enforcement, they tell me the same thing that
it is now the children and grandchildren of those they used to arrest
that are now in trouble.
Just because your father or grandfather walked down the wrong path with
their lives does not mean that you have to do the same. A godly heritage
can begin with your life. You can be the one that stands in the ways of
the Lord, living your life for Him. You can be the one who establishes a
new family tradition, a tradition of uprightness, a tradition that will
bring countless blessings upon you and your descendants. Blaze a trail
for your children, grandchildren and all your descendants to follow.
Mark that trail well with your actions, along with your verbal and
written testimony. It will make an eternal difference for those who
follow the trail you have blazed. Stand in the ways!  --Ed Wrather

***********************************************************

Be Renewed in the Spirit of Your Mind

&quot;You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off
your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be
made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self,
created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. Ephesians 4:22-24
You can gauge the depth of a Christian's spiritual life by the things he
puts first. Tell me his priorities and you tell me the focus of his life
and his relationship with the Lord. Matthew said, &quot;Wherefore by their
fruits you will know them.&quot;

The voice from &quot;the world&quot; says, &quot;Don't tell me how spiritual you are;
show me by the way you live. Don't tell me how much you pray, show me
the effect of prayer by the power of God being manifested in your daily
walk. Don't tell me how much you read the Bible, show me how you have
applied it by a righteous life and holy living. Don't tell me how much
you love the Lord; show me how His love abounds in your life unto
others. Don't tell me you are a Christian; show me the evidence through
your godly character and committed life to Christ.&quot; They have had their
full, and more, of superficial, shallow, uncommitted, ineffective
religious professions. They are looking for and are influenced by a
Christian whose life reveals a personal relationship with Christ and
manifests the &quot;fruit of the Spirit.&quot; And what is the fruit of the
Spirit? It is &quot;love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, and temperance.&quot; Can these virtues be evidenced in our
lives by our doing? Absolutely not! This &quot;fruit&quot; is initiated and
manifested by the power of God living within the believer. It is the
manifestation of His indwelling Spirit in our lives. It's the result of
being made a new creation in Christ, but there's more! Paul says, &quot;Put
off the old man and make no provision for the flesh; put on the new man,
which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.&quot;

The &quot;old man&quot; is what we are by birth, by nature, through inheritance,
and by our actions. We are fallen, depraved, corrupt, sinful, and with a
bias against God for evil. Our habits, associations, worldly interests,
lifestyle, and our whole concept of life and God are from a &quot;fallen
nature.&quot; Therefore, Paul says, &quot;Put off the old man.&quot; These things are
incompatible with the &quot;new man.&quot; Get rid of them! WHY? Because they
belong to the sinful life of our past, the way we once lived.

What a radical difference in the way we were and the way God wants us to
be! Paul knows what can happen when we &quot;put off the old man and put on
the new man.&quot; He's been there, done that, and his life was transformed
from a persecutor of the Christians to an apostle of Christ. He went
from one end of the spectrum to the other. BUT SO CAN WE! When we yield
the control of our lives to His lordship, He clothes us with His
righteousness and holiness! This is not our doing; IT IS GOD'S! Let us
adorn our lives with the fruit of the Spirit by the power of the Holy
Spirit, being renewed daily in the spirit of our minds, and strengthened
with His might by the Spirit in the inner man, that we may magnify
Christ and impact lives for eternity. &quot;Ye have not chosen me, but I have
chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth
fruit.&quot;  --Ed Powell

The Most Important Question
We seem to spend an enormous amount of time evaluating questions about
our future: what school we'll attend, what job we will work, who we will
marry, and where we will live. These are important questions and deserve
careful consideration. But have we given proper thought to the question
which determines our eternal future?
If the Bible is simply a collection of stories and the thoughts of crazy
men, then there is no eternity and you need read no further - the next
several years are all we have, so make the most of them. But if the
Bible is God's direct message, then there is nothing of greater
importance! His message says we continue to live long after our physical
body ceases to breathe. Though we pass from this earth, we continue to
live - we either live in eternal joy and peace, or eternal pain and
suffering. There is no greater question: Where WILL we spend eternity?
When Jesus died, He was nailed to a cross along with two other men.
These men were thieves and both mocked Jesus for claiming to be the Son
of God. But at some point during those long hours on the cross, one of
the men demonstrated a changed heart and had his eternal future
radically altered.
Luke 23:40-41 &quot;'Don't you fear God,' he said, 'since you are under the
same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds
deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.'&quot;
In the last moment of life, this common thief pointed the way to eternal
peace. He recognized his sin and understood he deserved death. We ALL
sin and fall short of God's standard; and this sin deserves death,
eternal pain and suffering. But praise God we need not dwell in this
hopeless state. The thief turned from his sin, toward Jesus as the One
who would conquer death; &quot;Jesus, remember me when You come into Your
Kingdom&quot; (Luke 23:42).
Though the thief had nothing to give, he surrendered ALL. God's Word
never says there are specific acts which determine our eternal future.
We are simply told to believe in Jesus with such a belief that we call
out with complete surrender. When the thief recognized and turned from
his sin, with humility toward Jesus as his only hope, Jesus answered as
He promises to answer us today; &quot;I tell you the truth, today you will be
with Me in paradise&quot; (Luke 23:43).
In that moment the thief had his answer. No longer a thief but a Child
of God, he would live forever in joy and peace. Let's not allow another
day to go by without knowing where we will spend eternity! Have we
recognized and turned from the sin within our heart? Have we humbly
placed our life in His hands? Do we really believe? Today, let's make
sure we know the answer to the most important question.  --Steve Troxel

Holy God, Show us how to love as you have loved us. Give us your grace
today to walk as children of light, sharing your light with all we meet.

Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

Read Through The Bible
Exodus 18
Jethro Visits Moses
1 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and father-in-law of Moses, heard of
everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, and how the
LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt. 2 After Moses had sent away his
wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her 3 and her two sons.
One son was named Gershom, for Moses said, &quot;I have become an alien in a
foreign land&quot;; 4 and the other was named Eliezer, for he said, &quot;My
father's God was my helper; he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.&quot; 5
Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, together with Moses' sons and wife, came
to him in the desert, where he was camped near the mountain of God. 6
Jethro had sent word to him, &quot;I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to
you with your wife and her two sons.&quot; 7 So Moses went out to meet his
father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and
then went into the tent. 8 Moses told his father-in-law about everything
the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake and
about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the LORD had
saved them. 9 Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the
LORD had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the
Egyptians. 10 He said, &quot;Praise be to the LORD, who rescued you from the
hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from
the hand of the Egyptians. 11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than
all other gods, for he did this to those who had treated Israel
arrogantly.&quot; 12 Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt
offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders
of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law in the presence of God.
13 The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people,
and they stood around him from morning till evening. 14 When his
father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said,
&quot;What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as
judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till
evening?&quot; 15 Moses answered him, &quot;Because the people come to me to seek
God's will. 16 Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I
decide between the parties and inform them of God's decrees and laws.&quot;
17 Moses' father-in-law replied, &quot;What you are doing is not good. 18 You
and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work
is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone. 19 Listen now to me
and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be
the people's representative before God and bring their disputes to him.
20 Teach them the decrees and laws, and show them the way to live and
the duties they are to perform. 21 But select capable men from all the
people---men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain---and
appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 22
Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them
bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide
themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it
with you. 23 If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to
stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied.&quot; 24 Moses
listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. 25 He chose
capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people,
officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 26 They served as
judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to
Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves. 27 Then Moses sent
his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own country.
