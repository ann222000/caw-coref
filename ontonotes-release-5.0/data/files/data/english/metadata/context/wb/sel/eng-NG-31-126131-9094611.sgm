Those of you who were following the recent thread about a complete set
of Beethoven piano sonatas will know that myself and one or two others
mentioned Paul Lewis though he has still his final volume to issue.

If you don't know his playing and want to hear it, the BBC Radio Three
playback page just now has him in concerts in which he plays the last
three Beethoven sonatas in their &quot;Afternoon on Three&quot; series. op 109
was Monday, op 110 Wednesday, and op 111 today Friday Nov 2nd. You
have to search in each concert playback which lasts four hours. The
one today, the last sonata, you will get by clicking on Friday at
http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/afternoonon3/ Fast forward the little
right arrow in the playback box to one hour, and that is just before
he plays op 111. A great performance, from the Schubertiad festival.

To simply add. Anyone who uses language as these two posters have, and
who speak of Beethoven as if he was some thug who would delight in
smashing people's fingers because he thought their playing too
delicate, does not deserve to hear Beethoven in the first place. Or
they may listen for a thousand years and obviously have not a clue as
to what music is actually for in this planet. These comments are from
the civilisation that makes bunker-busters cluster bombs and go kicks
ass in wherever it is they have to look up the map to see where the
ass is located. I suppose such folk have to heard on even in meeting
places to do with great music. And don't mention the word spiritual.
Gee, shucks, there's a wimp!!! Go get me my six-shooter etc etc etc

Pussy, eunuch, indeed. You are utterly insensitive to any finesse
obviously, though with the language that you choose to express your
lack in, there is as much hope of your ever understanding this as
there is of President Bush deciding there are too many military arms
in the world.

To position Paul Lewis for the benefit of those who haven't heard him
and who would want a sober perspective beyond the boorish macho stuff
above or my angry reply; Lewis is I think in the line, this early, of
being a natural successor to Solomon. Perhaps some will think that too
high praise for one who is still a young pianist-and of course he
still has years to develop-but that's the place in the spectrum of the
Beethoven interpretative scale he inhabits. Kovacevich for instance
has an excellent Beethoven cycle, more dramatic than Lewis, a fine
set, very satisfying. Lewis seems more nimble, has a terrific sense of
rhythm (I think here in comparison, of the last movement of Solomon's
Waldstein) and as a number of commentators have expressed in print,
seems to have a remarkable ability to bring out the emotional
important of the music in an individual but non-interventionist way.
The great Schnabel searching interpretations of say, the adagio of
opus 2 no 3, or the andante of op 109 (neither of which performance
has been quite equalled since in their beauty of pace and hanging-in-
the-air phrasing at crucial points, in my personal opinion) are
sometimes spoiled by Schnabel's not quite so exact articulation
elsewhere (eg his opening of the Hammerklavier). But Schnabel is
indispensable.

I am not saying that Lewis is as great as Schabel, I am saying that he
has a cleanness of articulation, a superb rhythmic understanding, an
apparent grasp of overall structure, and an ability especially in the
slower passages of Beethoven to convey a depth of emotion that brings
to my mind at least both Schnabel and Solomon. His performances and
recordings have been raved about. No matter, in the sense that one
arrives at one's own conclusions from one's own experience, finally.
But to dismiss him in such boorish dismissive and violent terms that
bring in the notion of his fingers needing to be broken by the
composer is very, very sad. &quot;Music hath charms to soothe the savage
breast&quot;-yet some breasts are obviously a deal more savage than others.
Andre Gide said that every age gets the Shakespeare it deserves. It
would seem that the most savage breasts get the Beethoven they
deserve, in their own minds: a violent thug.

Which is why I made my swipe about militarism.  America is of course
by no means the only country in the world with such a faction having
too much power; there is one of the biggest collection of nuclear
missiles in the world stored less than thirty miles from where I
write, in Scotland. Lots of us would enjoy our Beethoven even more if
such were to be removed.

LOL!

If Lewis ever rises to the level of either of the four gentlemen
mentioned above, it will be long after I depart this mortal coil. I
would hardly make a virtue out of Lewis' inability to make in the
competition game. Nor does his voice sound in the slightest
&quot;refreshing&quot;. Did you perhaps mean &quot;sleep-inducing&quot;?

I am on the last disc of the available sets from Lewis.

Genteel is one word I would use. Beethoven's thunderbolts sheathed in
velvet, so as not to disturb us too much. Polite is another word. Soft-
centred is yet another.

Lewis is musical, of course. Nothing to distract one's attention from
the smooth progress of the musical message. And he has nice
independence of hands. Basics of piano-playing, really. But is this
Beethoven? Certainly not my idea of him.

I will hear him in person in a couple of weeks in Paris. It will be
interesting to see if his actual piano sound is as PC as it sounds on
record. And he will follow Sokolov the next evening.

Hmmmmmm. An interesting comparison.

Nothing that PL does reminds one of a lounge lizard. He does have a

I think you've perfectly summed up what must be going through the
minds of a lot of listeners-- a sense of growing frustration at lost
opportunities for pianistic aggression. Lewis floats through Beethoven
as if it never threatens him and should never threaten us. Maybe he's
not threatened because he's mastered it in a way Beethoven did not (or
had not before the very end).

But actually I think Beethoven would be the first to thank Lewis for
taking his music so seriously, for managing to carve out a feeling of
timelessness and inner repose and utter certainty in the face of so
much abruptness. Maybe it is wrong to play all Beethoven like it is
late Beethoven, but the late Beethoven, at least, might very well
shake (gingerly) those precious hands and admire Lewis' ability to
arrive at such maturity so quickly when it took Beethoven so long to
get there. Lewis sees where Beethoven was going before Beethoven saw
it, that's all.

I haven't heard any of his recordings, but I listen to Lewis' live
Beethoven concerts with the certainty that deep concentration is
rewarded deeply, that the music flows without the slightest
distraction, that it bends, soars, and penetrates with neither
exaggeration nor understatement. They've worn very well on repetition,
too.

Call it wrong if you wish, but it is quite possible that you are
seriously underestimating the power of the music--even early
Beethoven--to speak through heavenly refinement rather than through
earthly spasms.

Despite all the obvious moments where a little banging would make a
point, Lewis is not slighting Beethoven's volatility; he's somehow
elevating it to a different point of view. I rather think Beethoven of
all people would appreciate the effort on his behalf.

This isn't my everyday view of Beethoven, but it's becoming clear that
Lewis is not an everyday pianist. This idea that he lacks artistic
masculinity is among the stupidest things I've ever heard. Anyone who
can maintain a long arc of such complicated music with such seeming
effortlessness has an immutable force of will and nerves of steel to
go with his heart-of-gold lyricism. To launch into an interpretation
like this that cannot tolerate the slightest raw tone or poorly timed
phrase or misjudged dynamic is to take a walk on the high-wire without
a net. This guy has guts.

But, of course, that begs the question; is any Beethoven on a modern
piano Beethoven? Should we only listen to his music on period
instruments? Having heard one set of the sonatas on fortepiano, I have
to say it has a totally different feel to it. (This could be, of
course, in part due to the performers, but the instrument has a _huge_
effect on the music.)

Wouldn't the Steinway be &quot;velvet&quot; compared to the instruments of
Beethoven's time?

Hmmm.

Not so much guts that he is capable of facing up to the real sound of
a ff or fff or sf, I would suggest. They are all very velvet-cushioned
experiences for him.

You're right, of course: not the slightest raw tone, poorly timed
phrase. But almost all the dynamics are misjudged. Sorry to disagree.
And this is absolutely crucial in Beethoven. The shocks must NOT be
cushioned, prepared, masticated, processed in the way he manages to
do.

A kind of superb efficiency takes over, allied to a charming way with
melody.

Beethoven? I don't think so. And hardly courageous.

&gt; &gt; Lewis is musical, of course. Nothing to distract one's attention from

&gt; &gt; Beethoven? Certainly not my idea of him.

&gt; But, of course, that begs the question; is any Beethoven on a modern
&gt; piano Beethoven? Should we only listen to his music on period
&gt; instruments? Having heard one set of the sonatas on fortepiano, I have
&gt; to say it has a totally different feel to it. (This could be, of
&gt; course, in part due to the performers, but the instrument has a _huge_
&gt; effect on the music.)

&gt; Wouldn't the Steinway be &quot;velvet&quot; compared to the instruments of
&gt; Beethoven's time?

I am not convinced of that. Indeed, the metal frame of the modern
piano imparts a much more forceful sound than that obtained on a wood
framed piano.

Beethoven practically destroyed his instruments, if one is to believe
reports of his banging furiously to get more sound out of the damned
things. Perhaps this was due to his increasing deafness. Perhaps,
however, just to the lack of force available to this very forceful
pianist.

If Lewis can be compared to any previous pianist, it might be Wilhelm
Kempff, although in concert - I heard him do all 32 sonatas in 1970 -
his sound was far more forceful than on his DG recordings.

But Kempff had additional elements to his pianism, including a very
wide dynamic range. Just try Op. 22 (first movement, development) from
the 1950s set for proof of this. And his Hammerklavier in public was
cataclysmic in approach.

Forceful as in louder; but aside from the loudest parts, the overall

Nor did Beethoven design the &quot;shocks&quot; for cheap thrills, or to grant
the pianist a moment of carte blanche.Lewis does a good job of keeping
all the elements in proportion and context, &quot;letting go&quot; where
needed,eg Appassionata finale as WR noted here earlier. While Goode's
and Richter's and others' Op.111 first movements may be considered
more dynamically dramatic than Lewis', I find Lewis' more
nuanced,interesting, and satisfying than many.

Only IMHO of course.No surprise Beethoven playing should evoke
disagreement,a testament to the music's value.Hopefully, we can all
agree it's a good thing we have youngsters willing to invest in his
music, play it so well at such a young age, and not be dissuaded from
sonata cycles unti they are 50- somethings.

I think the same disagreement would apply to the live performances,
though the thrill of that lovely lyricism is probably stronger in
concert. That's why I felt comfortable to describe what I'd heard.
I've heard about a third or half of Lewis's Beethoven in concert
broadcasts. I do have one commercially issued disc...from the BBC. It
is my least favorite Lewis experience so far--somewhat stale, although
the Beethoven sonata seemed better than the other pieces.

No question, the dynamics are not at all easy to play, either. But
dynamics and articulation are very important in playing Beethoven. I
don't think so many of us would like Lewis' Beethoven if he completely
smoothed these dynamics away...they're admittedly not overwrought, and
perhaps you would not like the playing at all, but there definitely
are dynamic contrasts in his playing. They're just not paramount to
him.

Well , I have listened to Lewis'  broacast Op.111 in two different
live recitals, as well as 109 and 110 in one live, and his is not all
sweetness and light.

In the end,here's what the Cleveland Quartet said about the slow
movement of the Op.,135 Quartet:

&quot; The Lento assai,cantante e tranquillo is the simplest, most
concentrated, most concise of the many great Beethoven slow movements
and is certainly one of the most sublime expressions of
man.Beethoven's own words,' Susser Ruhegesang oder
Friedengesang'( Sweet Song of Rest or Peacefulness') describe it as
well as any.The tranquility of this movement transcends the human
condition and gives credence to Sullivan's assertion that Beethoven's
music has a spiritual content that communicates experiences ' valuable
because they are in the line of human development; they are
experiences to which the race, in its evolutionary march ,aspires.'

As to the finale of Op.135, the Cleveland said:

&quot;Lighthearted and joyous, except for a small 'troubled ' area in the
development that foreshadows the return of the Grave, there is
generally a feeling of not a care in the world.&quot;

Of course, what did the Cleveland know ?

Correct.

The &quot;cheap thrills&quot; statement is diversionary. Beethoven WANTS to
shock your ears. The pianist must simply face up to that. How we

Try the Funeral March sonata. And then listen to Richter. Lewis is
simply not in the game.

The two Op. 27 sonatas, on the other hand, are very much in the game
and the only time I have felt - in listening to seven CDs - that Lewis
is a committed Beethovenian. The other sonatas remind me of pablum.

I can't answer that exactly, but in his recital in San Francisco a year
or so ago, he sounded exactly like his recordings. It's a little hard to
say what it is that keeps him from being more interesting. The playing
is not utterly without vitality, partly because it isn't without force.
I guess it's that he's too much like a machine. In fact, if I'd been
given a recording of that recital, I might well have guessed it was a
studio job, replete with assembly of the whole from multiple takes.
