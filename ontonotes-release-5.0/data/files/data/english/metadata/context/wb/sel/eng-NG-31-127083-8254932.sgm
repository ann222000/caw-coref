Well, it seems I am getting angry at everything.  I even am getting angry at
God for making me this way.  I met with my Bishop yesterday.  I went to
church about 10 minutes before our meeting, and prayed and cried like a
baby.  Then we talked for an hour and a half.  We went thru how much God
loves me and he will never do anything to punish me.  I disagreed and cried
and asked for forgiveness.  Disagreed some more, and did the same thing.
Man, I was a different person.  I don't pretend to be a good Catholic, but I
am not a bad one, either.  I &quot;used to&quot; go to church more than once a week.
Now, only on most Sundays...at best.
Last night I could not stop arguing with Leslie.  I was just angry, I know.
Same this morning.  She left for work, with a mere a peck on the lips
instead of a real kiss.

What the fuck is happening?  Do I need fucking counseling?  Is this the part
where I fucking lose it, and they start pumping me with Lithium and all kind
of shit to calm me the fuck down?  Is nicotine that fucking strong that it
will alter your fucking mind?  Mother fucking cigarette manufacturers knew
all about this, and no one moved a fucking muscle.  Might as well start
sniffing fucking cocaine, and get the same fucking result, you'll just die
earlier without being so fucking angry.  I don't know if there will be
another fucking S.O.S.  And why the fuck am I putting my dirty laundry out
for everybody to see and read?
Damn it all to hell.

AZ, for me, dealing with emotions was as hard, if not harder, than the
physical withdrawal from nicotine during the first few weeks/months of
my quit.  Smoking for 25 years to 'plug' all my emotions rendered me an
emotional cripple.  It was as if I had water balloons filled for each
emotion for the 25 years I hadn't let them out.  When I'd hear a sad
song, I would SOB.  When something annoyed me, I would EXPLODE.   All
of those amplified feelings would erupt, until each of the 'balloons'
was finally empty. The only way to empty them, for me, was to feel
those feelings.  (ew) Then, it was imperative to learn how to Identify
each  emotion, as it occured, and learn how to process it.  It may
sound simplistic, but I had to go deep inside, each time I felt the
rage, sadness, hysteria and consciously ask what the feeling really
was.  If I was hungry, eat.  If I was sleepy, take a nap.  If I was
angry, feel it and process it safely.  If I was sad, cry.  The good
news is, now that I've been practicing that for a while, I've
discovered an amazing serenity deep in my core.  Without the
mini-withdrawals throughout each day, while smoking, and without the
constant plugging of emotions, there was a peace like i've never
experienced.

It's worth it.

(Nice rant, by the way.  I give it a 10!)

AZ-Glad you're airing your laundry...you're not the only one who's
been through this, won't be the last.

Y'know...When I went through my last big quit (Zyban, AS3, the whole
enchilada)...in '98
I found myself in that exact(!) same kind of anger thing. I attributed
it to the Zyban (too much? Not enough? I'll never know)
I say 'never know', since I dropped off that quit when I got fired,
and my wife's father died...same week...three weeks after quit day.

Anger started up after quit day, but before the LifeChangers.
Nicotine is psychotropic. So is Zyban/Wellbutrin/buproprion...if
you're taking it, talk to your MD. Change the dose, change the brand.

At least you're seeing that it's an issue.
Notice that I am not addressing the religious aspect of ctholicism and
punishment, nor whether Leslie should be giving you big sloppies, or
little pecks.

(you're probably cussin' me out, now :o

Relax, take deeper breaths (no...deeper than that)
keep posting here,
talk to your MD, if your doing the pill-assisted quit.

Lots of folks can benefit from YOUR s.o.s.
go ahead, pop another one out here...we can take it.

In my original post I mentioned that people were begging me to start
smoking again, just so I'd stop being such an ass and getting angry at
everything.

I was lucky. My wife put up with me. She wasn't happy about it, but it
went with the territory. I'd alway apologize for my behavior, and then
in the middle of the apology get angry all over again!! But I was lucky.
My wife tolerated it because it made me a healthier person. It's very
comforting to know that when I die, at least I'll be healthy....

Getting angry seems to be part of the process for many of us. Radical
personality changes, mood swings, likes and dislikes, etc. Sorry about
that, but it's reality smacking us upside the head for abusing ourselves
for so long. In my case, 43 years smoking non-filtered menthols. I just
figured this was my 'payback' for all those years of hurting myself
without knowing it. Now I was hurting myself AND everyone around me, and
having my nose rubbed in it. For me, that phase lasted a few years and
then mellowed... a bit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What the fuck is happening?  Do I need fucking counseling?
">

A good counselor is a GREAT help. Do find one who has gone through the
same thing though. Otherwise, they simply can't understand what the real
problem is. That's why this group is so effective. We've all been there
ourselves, and know exactly what you're going through. And no, it's not
pleasant at all. I can empathize with you but I can't take away the pain
and I can't make you calmer. But you can.

Meditation DOES help a lot. Simple, non-specific, non religious
meditation. Pick up any good book on the subject that doesn't require
you to join a sect or wear special clothing and meditate for 20 minutes
twice a day. You WILL feel better in a week or so. Strange, but true.

No, but oddly enough warm milk will work... Heating it up releases
L-tryptophan and serotonin in your brain, (do NOT use a microwave,) both
of which are natural tranqs!  So will vanilla ice cream. (See? There's a
positive side to all this!)

&gt; Is nicotine that fucking strong that it

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; will alter your fucking mind?
">

Absolutely. But Lobilia, a common herb, mimics nicotine and binds with
the nicotine receptors in the brain, and eliminates the withdrawal
sysmtoms. And Lobilia is NOT addictive, so after two weeks of taking
lobilia twice a day, so the nicotine is flushed from the body, then
stoping the herb, there are NO withdrawal symptoms at all. But your
problem isn't withdrawal, and may continue long after you've broken the
nicotine addiction. You are addicted to smoking, not just to nicotine.

You're not unique!  You've been squelching your emotions with a cigarette
for years, now there's no buffer between you and your
rage/joy/sadness/irritation/whatever.  For the first time since you started
your addiction, you have to learn to manage your raw emotions without that
smoky barrier protecting you.

When you were smoking, if someone/something pissed you off, what did you do?
You WALKED AWAY and smoked a cigarette.  Try walking away without the cig.
Grab a bottle of water, or a piece of gum, or just go outside and take some
deep breaths.  When you come back, whatever it was will be less intense
because you've taken a moment and separated yourself from it - just
drug-free this time.  The little mini-breaks your addiction forced you to
take are still therapeutic for a non-smoker, but we tend not to take them.

Meanwhile, it's ok to be an ass for a while.  Come here and dump your anger,
then you can be more human to the ones close to you.  When you feel the rage
rising, walk away - go take a cigarette break without the cigarette and see
if it helps.

I was the same way.  Cussed like a sailor even though I am a Christian who
*tries* to walk the walk; mad all the time, cried all the time, for about 3
months.

Hang in there.  It will pass.  God can take your anger.  AS3 can handle the
posts.  Everyone put up with my stuff too.  I &quot;let it all hang out&quot;.  It was
OK.  I made it.  It passed.  I feel good now.  You just got 2Ms.  Give
yourself about 6 more weeks.  You will feel so totally different.  At 2M's
my husband told me I was an angry person and my little girl cried and said
&quot;everywhere I go you are mad at me&quot;.  I wanted to smoke.  I love my kids and
my husband.  I've done all this stuff to better myself and he basically told
me it didn't matter.

but he lied.  He was caught up in the moment when he said that.  He didn't
know that it was just part of the process.  He couldn't remember who I was.

A month later I asked him if he still believed it.  If it was true, and he
said no.

Keep going AZ.  push through.

AZ, as everyone here has stated already, smoking does repress a LOT of
our feelings, both good and bad.  When we smober-up, we start feeling
feelings for the first time in years and it's wierd and strange and
hard to take at times.  Hang in there, it will calm down over time and
as you emerge it will be as a stronger whole person who better knows
yourself.  If you do find that you are getting depressed and it
doesn't lift in a couple of weeks, talk it over with your doctor.
There is a strong connection between getting smober and getting
depressed.  Sometimes some limited drug use can counter this as your
body adjusts to normal, which is a place we have NOT been in a long
time.

Hang Tuff
Don't Puff

You are doing well with your quit overall and you know you don't want
to go back to sickerettes!

sobriety date and everything, and I really believe the major cause for that

&gt; AZ, for me, dealing with emotions was as hard, if not harder, than the
&gt; physical withdrawal from nicotine during the first few weeks/months of my
&gt; quit.  Smoking for 25 years to 'plug' all my emotions rendered me an
&gt; emotional cripple.  It was as if I had water balloons filled for each
&gt; emotion for the 25 years I hadn't let them out.  When I'd hear a sad song,
&gt; I would SOB.  When something annoyed me, I would EXPLODE.   All of those
&gt; amplified feelings would erupt, until each of the 'balloons' was finally
&gt; empty. The only way to empty them, for me, was to feel those feelings.
&gt; (ew) Then, it was imperative to learn how to Identify each  emotion, as it
&gt; occured, and learn how to process it.  It may sound simplistic, but I had
&gt; to go deep inside, each time I felt the rage, sadness, hysteria and
&gt; consciously ask what the feeling really was.  If I was hungry, eat.  If I
&gt; was sleepy, take a nap.  If I was angry, feel it and process it safely.
&gt; If I was sad, cry.  The good news is, now that I've been practicing that
&gt; for a while, I've discovered an amazing serenity deep in my core.  Without
&gt; the mini-withdrawals throughout each day, while smoking, and without the
&gt; constant plugging of emotions, there was a peace like i've never
&gt; experienced.

&gt; It's worth it.

Good rant AZ, though I get the picture and it's not funny. I don't
know what to say that hasn't been said already, but I'll try anyway...

When I get this way I can go ahead and blow up, but I look at what I
said or did as soon as I can and try to find something about it that's
funny about what I did. The next time it comes up, I'm more likely to
just laugh instead of blowing up. They call it hysterical humor, and
you'll be the only one to get it. Careful not to go over the edge ;-)

I think it kind of get's you comfortable with 'you' when you can laugh
at yourself. Truth is, you need to like 'you' more than you do now and
not take yourself so seriously, before things around you are going to
look much better. You know how it's said that you are what you eat?
Well, in a round about way, you are who you say who you are.

AZ ...

I think it's normal.

Here's my theory ...

I think it's the process of shifting your perspective ... or
'Rebraining'.

With smoking we were 'rewarding' ourselves and soothing ourselves for
the most trivial things ... now we're not. I think that's where most
of the 'constant' anger comes from.  No 'rewards'.  Without these
'rewards' maybe we don't feel as worthy (that would be Nick O'Demon
fucking with your head).

Picture your 'perspective' as being only what you see between too well
anchored goal posts and then having to tear those goal posts from the
ground and move them to a new location.

The 'New &amp; Improved Perspective' reveals that there never was a reward
-- it was a lie. It was an addiction. But that's only when you're
looking back.  Look forward and there's *so* many good things --
*Freedom* and *Health* being the two biggest for me -- to see.

Apologize, make up for the results of the frustration and anger.

Reward yourself.  You're worth it.  Go out for a nice dinner with the
Missus. RELAX!

What are you doing to *actively* relax?  Deep breathing? Stretching
(easy yoga)? Exercise is great -- it really makes you feel good and
burns off excess energy plus conditions you mentally and physically to
deal with stress.

You're doing great AZ!!!

Cheers and High-Fives,
Marvin

Hey AZ -

Other people have already talked about why this might be happening, and I
don't really have much to add to that.  I can tell you, from my own recent
experience, that there are some positive sides to the emotionality that
seems to go with quitting -- but it may take some work and effort on your
part.

The worst part is when you get angry at someone you care about.   Sometimes
it may be phony-withdrawal inspired anger for no real reason.  There, you
just have to suck up and apologize and beg forgiveness and understanding.

Sometimes it can be actual, genuine, anger or irritation or hurt or
whatever, that, until recently, you would have stifled by walking away and
having a smoke.  In this case, you have to figure out what it's about, and
calm yourself down enough to deal with the issue directly and
*productively.*  This can be REALLY REALLY hard, and is what I have been
dealing with lately.   I've had to do it because I'd been boiling over with
anger and resentment at my partner and it was driving me nuts.  I had just a
couple of counseling sessions to get to the bottom of it and learn how to
handle it with my other half.   And, you know what?  I talked with him about
the things that were bothering me, got it off my chest, and now I am not
angry at him any more.  We're cool.  And I also have identified some
internal stuff that has nothing to do with my partner, and I am handling
that too.  And so the positive side of this emotionality is that we actually
strengthened our relationship, and I am taking a more active role in sort of
creating my life (for lack of a better way of putting it) instead of letting
life happen to me.  But, as I said, it takes some work on figuring out what
the issue is, and figuring out how to talk about it productively, or deal
with it productively if it is inside yourself.

The best part of all this emotionality, IMHO, is getting angry at someone
who really deserves it, and NOT stifling it with a cigarette, but letting
the person totally have it.   Have you ever been in a situation where you
were so angry, and you walked away saying to yourself  &quot;I wish I had
said....&quot;?  Now, you just may find that you will have said exactly what you
meant to say, and there can be a LOT of satisfaction in that.  I always felt
like a bit of a doormat and now... well, now I say, fuckem, and I tell them
exactly what I think.  And part of this is because I am a bit of an &quot;exposed
nerve&quot; just as an ex-smoker, and the other part is this learning how to take
a more active role in my life.

Now, it may be nicotine withdrawal screwing with your synapses, or it could
be the lack of nicotine &quot;medication&quot; is unmasking actual, real-life,
emotions; or it could be both.   Just from my own experience, a couple of
sessions of counseling couldn't hurt.  It doesn't mean you're &quot;depressed&quot; or
nuts or that you ought to be medicated.  I have been in for three sessions
and I feel better, improved my relationship, reduced my stress level, and, I
think, figured out what I want to do for my next living.  I'm pretty much
over the counseling now.  YMMV, of course.

In reality, you already went for counseling when you went to talk to your
Bishop.  IMHO, one of the problems with talking to a clergyman can be the
feeling of judgment -- you are worried about sin, God, whether or not you're
a good parishoner, whether or not you're a good Catholic, what this man who
has known you for umpity ump years may think of you -- or whatever.  A good
&quot;civilian&quot; counselor, on the other hand, will have none of that baggage for
you.  You go in, unload your shit - the worst of it, without
self-censorship, they (hopefully) guide your thinking to some solutions, and
you leave.  If you don't want a long-term relationship, you don't have to
have one.   No guilt.  A counselor, unlike the church, does not give a crap
if you aspire to be like the most perfect person.    So, counseling couldn't
hurt, IMHO.

Consider the following:  if, when you apologize to your other half for being
a jerk last night, you tell her that you don't understand what's going on
with you and that you're going to talk to a counselor about it, she may just
cut you some slack because she knows you're &quot;working on it.&quot;  Of course, you
know better than I whether or not she'll go for that, but it's an idea.

I swear it gets better.  It really does.  With some effort.  And time.  And
you will be a better person coming out of this, both physically and
emotionally stronger.  But it sucks going through it.  I know.   So my
thoughts are with you.

Best,

Jaime

Hang in there AZ.

I hope some of these posts have convinced you that this a normal part
of the process, although I'm sure it doesn't make you feel any better
at the moment.

Take a deep breath. Maybe talking to a counselor isn't such a bad
idea. Lord knows I've done it many times in my life when I was having
a rough time, and I'm always glad that I did.

Meanwhile, know that you can *always* talk to us. We don't care about
your dirty laundry, and we'll air ours for you too.

Not in general. Just for getting the benefits of the warm milk. (Or for
drying your cat. Don't.) Something I read said that the microwave
wavelengths broke down the L-tryptophan and serotonin. I don't profess
to understand the physics of it. Just passing on what I read. The page
said it was better to warm the milk over a flame or on an electric
burner. I suppose, in theory, adding chocolate to the milk would work
even better still as there is 'theobrimine' in chocolate. That makes you
feel better too. There are lots of great drugs in normal foods, which is
one of the reasons eating is so good for you. If you don't believe it,
just try stopping for a year or two...  :o)

AZ - Can you feel the &quot;caring&quot; vibes from all these people? How lucky
is this? Just reach out and they will respond. Wow. Take it to heart.
They care. Just take it &quot;one day at a time&quot;. You are going through the
withdrawal process and it takes time. Read &amp; post, read &amp; post. Our
thoughts &amp; prayers are with you (as trite as that sounds).
Hugs,
Pam

&gt;&gt; Forgot to mention that I even slipped in my recovery program and took
&gt;&gt; some pills (Vicodin) for a week beyond what I needed them for.  I had to
&gt;&gt; reset my sobriety date and everything, and I really believe the major
&gt;&gt; cause for that was that I wanted to escape all those feelings.

&gt;&gt; Hey!  I have an AA birthday coming up!!  Whooohoooooo!  5 years...  wow.
&gt;&gt; With hope and heart,
&gt;&gt; Kathleen

&gt;&gt;&gt;I was the same way.  Cussed like a sailor even though I am a Christian
&gt;&gt;&gt;who *tries* to walk the walk; mad all the time, cried all the time, for
&gt;&gt;&gt;about 3 months.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hang in there.  It will pass.  God can take your anger.  AS3 can handle
&gt;&gt;&gt; the posts.  Everyone put up with my stuff too.  I &quot;let it all hang out&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It was OK.  I made it.  It passed.  I feel good now.  You just got 2Ms.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Give yourself about 6 more weeks.  You will feel so totally different.
&gt;&gt;&gt; At 2M's my husband told me I was an angry person and my little girl
&gt;&gt;&gt; cried and said &quot;everywhere I go you are mad at me&quot;.  I wanted to smoke.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I love my kids and my husband.  I've done all this stuff to better
&gt;&gt;&gt; myself and he basically told me it didn't matter.

&gt;&gt;&gt; but he lied.  He was caught up in the moment when he said that.  He
&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't know that it was just part of the process.  He couldn't remember
&gt;&gt;&gt; who I was.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A month later I asked him if he still believed it.  If it was true, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; he said no.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Keep going AZ.  push through.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hugs,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Kathleen

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, it seems I am getting angry at everything.  I even am getting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; angry at God for making me this way.  I met with my Bishop yesterday.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I went to church about 10 minutes before our meeting, and prayed and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cried like a baby.  Then we talked for an hour and a half.  We went
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thru how much God loves me and he will never do anything to punish me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I disagreed and cried and asked for forgiveness.  Disagreed some more,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and did the same thing. Man, I was a different person.  I don't pretend
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be a good Catholic, but I am not a bad one, either.  I &quot;used to&quot; go
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to church more than once a week. Now, only on most Sundays...at best.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Last night I could not stop arguing with Leslie.  I was just angry, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know. Same this morning.  She left for work, with a mere a peck on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lips instead of a real kiss.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What the fuck is happening?  Do I need fucking counseling?  Is this the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; part where I fucking lose it, and they start pumping me with Lithium
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and all kind of shit to calm me the fuck down?  Is nicotine that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fucking strong that it will alter your fucking mind?  Mother fucking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cigarette manufacturers knew all about this, and no one moved a fucking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; muscle. Might as well start sniffing fucking cocaine, and get the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fucking result, you'll just die earlier without being so fucking angry.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know if there will be another fucking S.O.S.  And why the fuck
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; am I putting my dirty laundry out for everybody to see and read?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Damn it all to hell.

Wow!  Thank you all so much for all your responses.  I appreciate every
single word you said..errr...wrote.
Things are calmer yesterday and today.  I am trying to control my anger and
direct it elsewhere if I can.  I have been able to deflect it so far.  Go
for a walk, even though it is 437 degrees outside, or call a friend ( using
one of my lifelines I guess ) or anything that will take my anger away.  So
far, so good.
I have invited God back into my life, and am working a little longer hours,
although I don't know if that is related.  I am just a bit behind at work.

All in all, I think I might be on the right track.  Leslie and I had a nice
evening.  Arguing and gighting free.  Slept close to each other, woke up
with a kiss and talking like we did before (2 years ago).

Again, thank you guys for all you said.

By the way, no matter what happens, &quot;Today's Thought&quot; will go on :)
