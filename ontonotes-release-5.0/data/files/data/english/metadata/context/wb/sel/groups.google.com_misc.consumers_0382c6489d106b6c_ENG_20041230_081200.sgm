Federal tax forms arrived today in the mail.

Once again, the included pie chart shows that 70% of all government
income is derived from personal income taxes, including payments for
Social Security, Medicare, unemployment and other retirement taxes.

70%.

&quot;Borrowing to cover deficit&quot; comprises another 17% of government
revenues (naturally, individual taxpayers are expected to repay this,
with interest--which comprises 7% of government outlays currently).

Even such combined exotica as excise, customs, estate, gift and
&quot;miscellaneous&quot; taxes contribute 7%.

But what do corporations--the largest income-producers in the nation,
the wealthiest entities on the planet--contribute to the government
coffers?

Six. 6%, the smallest amount contributed from any single source. 6%.

This, at a time when personal incomes are shrinking and U.S.
corporations are sending jobs overseas.

This, at a time when American soldiers (&quot;the military we have&quot;, as
Rumsfeld put it) shed their blood and lives in Iraq...to protect
American corporate interests.

The money earned by corporations is theirs. They should pay taxes on it,
just like individuals do. The money earned by corporate workers is
theirs. Corporations cannot be said to pay taxes through the taxes their
workers pay. If corporations paid their fair share, the budget shortfall
would disappear. Bush's war, as well as his tax cuts for wealthy
individuals, would essentially pay for themselves.

Now, if only they could fight their own blasted war and let our soldiers
come home.

You could abolish the individual income tax and replace it with a
hefty rise in the corporate tax. Americans as a whole would still be
paying the same amount except now it would look like higher prices
instead of income tax.

If you're more cynical, consider that corporations have armies

to persuade legislators to slip just a few more tax breaks for
them into the tax code.

If you could bring similar pressure to bear, you'd probably
be able to get your tax bill shrunk down to 6%, too.

Seems easy, but it isn't...

The higher price analogy is bogus. Demand and supply determine price, not
costs (at least in a totally free market), but there are hairier issues to
deal with, mostly related to jobs.

Corporations use jobs to hold our various governments (local, state,
federal) hostage. They always threaten to move jobs to more tax-friendly
environs if our elected officials raise taxes on them. No politician wants
to be branded as the cause of their assembly plant leaving their district,
so they are forced to support tax cuts for corporations whether they like it
or not.

There is obviously more to it than that, but with the recent scarcity of
jobs (that is likely to continue for a long time under this administration),
corporations do a good job tightening the noose around our politicians'
necks, so that the individual taxpayers (mostly ones without means or a
consituancy in congress--the midlde class). This trend has been going on
since the 70's. The middle class is fighting for a continuously shrinking
piece of the pie. Expect it to cointinue drastically as republicans slash
middle-class friendly policies and programs.

Thanks,

Mike

It's easy enough to say the tax code is over-complicated. It may even
be true. But the _easy_ part is the final arithmetic; the hard part
is determining what's income.

And furthermore you have to determine _net_ income, which means you
have to determine expenses, and that's even harder. Or do you think
the self-employed contract programmer who takes in $120K working out
of his house, and the lawyer who takes in $120K but has to maintain
an office and a secretary out of that, should pay equal taxes?

"/> It seems to me you've left fairness and simplicity behind. If the lawyer
buys or rents an office, it's deductible. If he practices out of a room in
his house, it's not, there is no deduction even if the square footage and
the time that square footage is devoted to income producing activity is the
same.

Here you say something's a deductible cost &quot;when you bought it&quot;, elsewhere
you say it's deductible &quot;in the year the payments were made&quot;. Anyone who's
ever bought anything on credit knows those aren't the same thing - which is
it?

You said sending the secretary to a class was deductible, but you wouldn't
allow travel or entertainment deductions. How is the secretary supposed to
get to the class? Saying this is the age of telecommunications rather begs
the question - there are all kinds of classes that aren't &quot;telecommutable&quot;.
If you'd allow a deductible mileage expense for driving to the class, does
the secretary deduct it? If the mileage is reimbursed by the employer, does
the employee deduct it and add the reimbursement and the employer deduct it?

If classes are deductible, does that mean I would have been able to deduct
the cost of my college degree - that degree has after all made a huge
difference in my earning power? For the more workaday types, are commuting
expenses deductible - without commuting I can't earn a living, after all?
Does the amount of the deduction depend on actual costs - the fancier car I
drive, the bigger my deduction?

My office has a dress code, and the clothes I wear to work aren't very
useful for much of anything outside the office - since I have to buy this
stuff in order to generate my income, is it deductible? For those
professions where the normal attire is even less &quot;normal&quot; - scrubs for a
nurse, wet suits for a diver, hard hats and steel toed boots for a
construction worker - are their clothes deductible? If they can deduct what
they normally wear to work, shouldn't I and everyone else be able to do the
same?

How about a drug company that spends millions of bucks over a dozen years to
develop and test a potential new drug? Are those costs deductible as
they're being paid? What if the new drug fails to win approval and never
makes it to market and never generates any income - does that mean those
deductions shouldn't have been made? Part of the cost of developing new
drugs is clinical trials, and part of the cost of those is a reimbursement
to the volunteers who participate for commuting costs to and from the test
sites. Since you wouln't allow travel costs, is it fair to tax the
participants income even though it's spent on what is ultimately income
producing activity (though they're not the ones getting the income) and tax
the income of the company developing the drug even though they can't get to
market without paying these costs?

We could go on like this almost forever - that's why the tax code is 200,000
pages or whatever it is long.

It is just as false now (at least in economic terms; I'm not addressing
military and strategic terms because none have ever been offered as
reasons for being in Iraq) as it was then as proven by the passage of
time and fortune.

Nobody can foretell the future, so who knows? Maybe Iraq will be the
biggest success story in American history. But it seems like a lot of
money (not to mention blood, time, and effort) to risk on such a chance
in this nation's current position,

So where do corporations get the money to pay Federal taxes? What the

on their employees, suppliers, contractors, and shareholders or for
delivering more/better product/services to their customers.

So you may not care about shareholders? That's your and my IRA, 401K,

people should.

Have a problem with some &quot;corporate fat cat&quot; not being taxed enough for
