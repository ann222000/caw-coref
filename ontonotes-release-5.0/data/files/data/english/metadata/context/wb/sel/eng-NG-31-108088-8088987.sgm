...And I am a Culprit...

I don't know about y'all, but when I found RMD 5 years ago, it was
rife with Ride Reports (RR's).  I enjoyed writing up my
(mis)adventures, just to read your reactions, wit, and &quot;I've done
that's&quot;.  I lived vicariously through the RR's when I was bored,
injured or bikeless.  Basically, you guys kept me pumped when I wasn't
riding.  I used to write up all my rides (do a search on Thomaston Dam
- you'll see), but lately, I've been pretty complacent - even going
back to ISF '06.  I have 5 pages of notes from ISF '06 I was going to
do RR's on.  I only did day 1.  The week out in the San Rafael Swell
with VLJ, Deeney, etc. this past May?  6 pages of notes, no RR.  Our
club, NCTR?  4-5 group rides, and no RR to speak of.  I love to write,
and assume my eloquence can convey the feeling of being on the ride
with me....but...I just don't think anyone gives a rat's-ass anymore.
Tiago and a few others post RR's, but it's not the same as a few years
ago (no disrespect, Tiago, et al).  What happened ???  My excuse is
maybe being lazy, but in reality, I don't write because I don't think
anyone cares.  80-85% of the posts these days are OT or impersonal -
or just friggin' stupid.  I've done more riding, trips, adventures,
etc. than ever before (being plated helps ;) in the last year, but
feel RMD is....just...not the same as it used to be.

Those of you who are going to Baum soon...I'll be there in spirit.
I'm booked up for rides the next 3 weekends, and if anyone cares, I'll
type up a RR for you.  I'll be looking for Idaho posts, so maybe
that'll motivate me.  In the mean time, go ride, and write about it
HERE.  I want to read about your adventures...want to read about mine?

No ride reports from me because, well, I haven't been riding. (Too
damn hot!) But I do enjoy reading a good RR, and I was emailed a
succinct but well written and entertaining one just today! I did miss
a couple while on vacation though... KW's and Tim's... and really
should find time to catch up on 'em as I'm sure they're entertaining
also.

But sometimes I'm afraid I'm guilty of Alzheimers... I see a long
RR and don't have time to read it when I first discover it, then
forget about it and never end up reading the damn thing. I imagine
this happens for a lot of folks though.

In any case, RR are always welcomed as far as I'm concerned.

I owe myself and all of you an apology for not riding more. Then I could
write something good, maybe.

I was having a daydream yesterday about getting my bike ready and riding
enough to feel ready for the Turkey Run this year; ready enough for a
personal best. I'd like to finish three laps before the fast guys finish
five. Somehow races usually make better stories for me than fun rides...

Was that you at the dam who helped me pull my bike out of a mud pit and then
rode yours right into the same hole? I guess there are some good trailside
reports too.
I wish you were still around here. All the catalyst people are gone... Sean,
DDave...
sing it:
Where have all the spodelings gone,
long time crashing...

Prof. Dowd has inspired me to get at least one sample from my helmet cam
too, dammit. Jim, did you ever do anything with that extra R-cam you got
from me on ebay, or did it get sold retail? I picked the wrong recorder for
off road use so I haven't had luck yet. But why add another layer to my
unpreparedness? I should just go ride.

It would be good to show some CT woods to those who can't really imagine how
close a big gun exhaust can get to an unsuspecting patio table. And it's
just a little different from what I see elsewhere. You've seen enough
variety that you could probably describe the difference better than I could.

Anyway, I'm glad you're riding a lot. That's what matters when it gets right
down to it.

miss you, dewd

I agree with a lot of what you said, Chris. When's the last time I
wrote a ride report?
It might've been after my first &quot;real&quot; ride on the KTM, although I
can't remember. Thre have been numerous real rides since then but not
a word from me about them.

We did a 10-day dual-sport ride in NV in April that was absolutely
spectacular, and had a bit of adventure involved, too (Eric blew his
WR motor and I towed him 50 miles over 2 mountain passes, and we slid
the van down a hill and had to camp there for 3 days until the mud
dried enough so that we could get out) but I never really wrote about
it. I mentioned it, but the interest just wasn't there so I didn't
pursue it. We went on a stunningly beautiful ride in the high Sierra
last weekend but didn't mention that either. A few folks saw the
photos...I don't know, guys, was it worth writing about? I can add
links to my photos now, so maybe I should write something up...

I'm sure I'll have something to write about after we ride the Dusy
Ershim Trail with the Harrells in a few weeks &lt;G&gt;

Put `em down in words, Chris; I always enjoy your reports, especially
after riding with you and seeing your, um, skills firsthand &lt;G&gt;

I'm coming in the middle of this thread but here is my thoughts on what I
can figure the tone of the thread is.

I ride 1-2 times a week and race about ever 2 or 3 weeks.  I use to do a
lot more ride/race reports but got so little feedback I didn't think typing
them out was worth the effort.

Ohhh I rode yesterday at the MX track, went early in the morning before
the temps were over 90.  They had groomed and the dirt was in good shape, I
swaped out over a small double landing sideways on the landing and how I
didn't auger in I don't know.  The back side tightened to a diamond forming
pressure.  &lt;--- Short but still a ride report.

That's pretty much why I don't bother most of the time anymore. I can

Yep. When some totally stupid off-topic post can spin off a 100 post
thread, and your laboriously crafted ride report dies at 3, it doesn't
provide much incentive to write. Apparently, as a group we are more
interested in flaming each other or discussing, well, anything BUT

Yeah, Chris, I want to read yours, and most everybody else's too. I
just feel guilty when I reply to something in a healthy, active thread
and kill it dead in it's tracks. Probably 4 out of 5 posts I've made
turned out to be the final post in that thread, or at least to the
particular branch of the thread I was responding to. (I'll probably
kill this thread, too; sorry Chris.) Unlike some people around here,
I'm not into forcing my views on others, and if they show no interest
in my opinion as almost everyone here consistently has, I'll just keep
it to myself. I delete easily 90% of my replies without sending them,
because I realize there's no point to it. Scott and I had a double-
header race weekend last weekend, 2 enduros in one day, one at night.
As much as I'd like to write something, I just can't justify wasting
my time when the only people who seem to care will be sitting across a
campfire from me in a week. We'll talk then.
It must be nice to be like Levy or Buckley, where you can just pop in
occasionally, spew some arrogant opinionated bullshit about something
you have no real qualifications to comment on, insult the hell out of
anyone else in the thread, and spawn dozens of replies and adoring
comments. Or like Rick, where you can just make shit up and then
refuse to admit when you're wrong, hiding behind your work history
like that somehow imparts infallability upon you. Either way, they
generate more apparent interest than attempts to actually talk about
riding.
I think the group is getting what it wants. It's sad, really. I feel
bad for the O.G. rmd'ers like Deeney and Baxter; it must be like
watching one of your kids progress from cutting school to stealing
cars and going to jail, all of that early promise gone to waste...

FWIW: I rarely respond to the RRs, but I read and appreciate most of them.
Perhaps a pat on the back now and then is in order.

A lot of it is just conversational stuff between folks with similar

&gt; because I realize there's no point to it. Scott and I had a double-
&gt; header race weekend last weekend, 2 enduros in one day, one at night.
&gt; As much as I'd like to write something, I just can't justify wasting
&gt; my time when the only people who seem to care will be sitting across a
&gt; campfire from me in a week. We'll talk then.
&gt; It must be nice to be like Levy or Buckley, where you can just pop in
&gt; occasionally, spew some arrogant opinionated bullshit about something
&gt; you have no real qualifications to comment on, insult the hell out of
&gt; anyone else in the thread, and spawn dozens of replies and adoring
&gt; comments. Or like Rick, where you can just make shit up and then
&gt; refuse to admit when you're wrong, hiding behind your work history
&gt; like that somehow imparts infallability upon you. Either way, they
&gt; generate more apparent interest than attempts to actually talk about
&gt; riding.
&gt; I think the group is getting what it wants. It's sad, really. I feel
&gt; bad for the O.G. rmd'ers like Deeney and Baxter; it must be like
&gt; watching one of your kids progress from cutting school to stealing
&gt; cars and going to jail, all of that early promise gone to waste...
">

Alright. Then I'll post a race report.  I didn't write it.  A friend and
RMD occasional user did and I hope he doesn't mind me reposting it.  If
so, I'll hear about it.

I'll edit the names so that RiderRick doesn't try and track anyone down
and sue them with his arc welder.

RR follows:
(side note: we formed an informal team a few weeks back that currently
has about 15 members who will pick and choose what events to do.  We've
done two so far.  The first, we had about 10 or 12.  This was the second
one, this past weekend, where we had three riders)
---------------------------------------------------

So there we are at the riders meeting when I realized I had forgotten to
reset my rear shock rebound after playing with different settings week
or so back. Even thoughh my attention was diverted momentarily when the
adjustment knob broke off in my hand, I was pretty sure I heard
everything Alan was saying about creek jumps, drop-offs, etc.

5 miles in. Caution. Got it.

On the start, I was probably around 12th or 13th into the woods. Not
great, but better than usual for me. We all got into the woods clean and
I'd picked off three riders by the time we got through the first
left-hander. There was a decent gap between me and the next group of
riders, but I was able to close in just as we hit the first bit of tight
single track, about a mile or so in. The beauty was that I wasn’t
pushing at all, just running a nice comfortable, sustainable pace. This
was encouraging.

Right in front of me was another Senior-C guy on a Yamaha (I think), and
right in front of him was Dave Xxx on his KTM 200. I was hoping to catch
and do a little racing with Dave, but just then my afternoon took the
turn I was hoping it wouldn’t. I was so focused on the rider immediately
in front of me that I stopped looking down the trail for a moment, and
that’s all it took - by the time I realized the boneheaded mistake I was
in the process of making, I was face down in the mud with my rear fender
bouncing off the back of my helmet. Apparently (as I found out
afterwards), Alan had said something about this first drop-off, but I
missed it because I was screwing around with my rear shock. Two hard
lessons barely a mile and a half in. I will never, ever learn....

Anyway, same old story, in the time it took - several minutes at least -
to get the mud out of my nose and get the bike out of the mud and
re-fired, everyone including the women-b class was long gone. I took off
in hopes of that I could salvage a couple of positions before the end of
the race.

Just past the 2 mile mark, I came up on a guy who’d crashed pretty hard
in the mud pit and was on the ground in very obvious pain. I couldn’t
just ride by without stopping. spent probably 6-8 minutes there making
sure he was'nt,I dunno, not dying I guess, before getting under way
again. He seemed to have hurt his foot pretty bad, hope he’s OK.

A couple miles past that on a steep loose downhill reminiscent of Pilot
Mountain, I found friend and fellow Team Krusty racer John (son of
Scrape) who had crashed and then gotten run over repeatedly. BAD place
to crash, dood. John’s an ex-motocrosser with a lot of talent, but he’s
new to woods racing and is on the steep part of the learning curve at
the moment. Anyway, once we got him down the hill and got his bike
unflooded and re-fired, we decided to just run together for the
remainder of the race since neither one of us were in a position to be
competitive anymore. Back to the parking lot where his dad got to
working on the bike (bark busters bent into the levers) and I went back
to my car for a fresh set of gloves and goggles.

Back down at the track, John’s bike was still getting worked on and I
thought he might be done for the day, so I went back out by myself to
see if I could still run a decent lap.

This second lap was going much, much better. The bike was handling well
and I had managed to regain my focus. Unfortunately, a poor line choice
through another mud pit at a creek crossing bit me. I took the same line
I’d taken on my first lap, but it had degraded significantly since and
all but swallowed my bike this time. Stuck right next to me was a guy on
a Kawasaki who goes &quot;hey, help me get out and then I’ll help you&quot;. (If
you think you know where this one’s going, you’re probably right!).
Yeah, we got him out alright. He pulls about ten yards up the trail,
pauses for a few seconds and looks back like he was deciding what to do,
and then the little bastard takes off. Gone. I do know who he is but
he’s just a kid so I’ll leave it alone. Here’s a hint though - if #627
tries to strike a deal with you out in the woods, make damn sure you get
yours first..

But who shows up not two minutes later but John who, unlike me, picks a
smart line and gets right through it. John helped me dig the bike out
and then hung around pointing out the good line to everyone else for a
few minutes while I was getting my crap together. We finally got going
again, finished out the lap, got the checkers and called it a day.

We had three Team Krusty riders in this race.

* Nick S. - 7th in 250-A
* John L. - 14th Light-C
* Me      - 18th in Senior-C

Congrats to Nick S. on the awesome run. John and I were, not
surprisingly, dead last in our respective classes, but we’ll get ‘em at
County Line.

I can’t think of any other sport where things can go so wrong and yet
you can still honestly say you had a great time. Thanks to Vance Earl
and anyone else who was involved in putting together what was arguably
the best course yet.

---------------------

One other note:
Bob, one guy did place behind John with a DNF - at least according to
the sheet on the board after the race.
And, Bob finished 128th overall in the afternoon race.  John finished
129th.
Just got some photos back.  I'll pick a few out and post them to ABPM.

&gt;personal best. I'd like to finish three laps before the fast guys finish
&gt;five. Somehow races usually make better stories for me than fun rides...

&gt;Prof. Dowd has inspired me to get at least one sample from my helmet cam
&gt;too, dammit. Jim, did you ever do anything with that extra R-cam you got
&gt;from me on ebay, or did it get sold retail? I picked the wrong recorder for
&gt;off road use so I haven't had luck yet. But why add another layer to my
&gt;unpreparedness? I should just go ride.

&gt;It would be good to show some CT woods to those who can't really imagine how
&gt;close a big gun exhaust can get to an unsuspecting patio table. And it's
&gt;just a little different from what I see elsewhere. You've seen enough
&gt;variety that you could probably describe the difference better than I could.

&gt;Anyway, I'm glad you're riding a lot. That's what matters when it gets right
&gt;down to it.

The other forums have bled off alot of people.
I have done more riding this year than ever.  Almost 5,000 miles dual
sport on my Vstrom.  It isn't a KTM but I made a decision at the end
of 06 that I need to get more ride time in even if it isn't TST or
motocross.  I am happy with the decision.  My KX is ready for the next
WUDI so TST is always on the table.

Tim,

I agree with all you have said, but as the &quot;other than MX&quot; part of dirt
bikes diminishes, all we can expect are ride reports from David Levy, for
instances:

left turn, left turn, left turn, left turn, left turn,left turn, left turn,
left turn, left turn, left turn,left turn, left turn, left turn, left turn,
left turn,left turn, left turn, left turn, left turn, left turn and some
hills.

Sean's ride reports would probably look like:

right turn, right turn, right turn, right turn, right turn, right turn,
right turn, right turn, right turn, right turn, right turn, right turn,
right turn, right turn, right turn, right turn, right turn, right turn,
right turn, right turn and some hills.

Rex's ride reports:

Pulled out from behind billboard, fired up the Harley, chased perp, wrote
ticket for excessive speed, went home, cleaned gun, and thought about some
hills.

Me too. I used to write quite a few reports until they all sounded the
same unless something unexpected happened to make the ride turn into
an adventure. Guess I'm not nearly as adventurous any longer...

Someone commented on the forums taking away from RMD. They have
certainly come of age in the last few years, I spend more time on
KTMTalk than I do here anymore and even when I'm here I don't read
most of the stuff.

One thing about the forums is that you can see how many views a post
has had. Post a RR here and unless there are replies you have no idea
if it even gets read at all. But then again, the very nature of a RR
doesn't necessarily elicit or require replies.

Fantastic! Thanks for sharing, Tim.&quot;

I wish I could ride more so that I could share more RRs myself. But

Riders ride, and writers write. Doesn't really matter whether anyone

Right?!

I read your teasers, and hope to get the full monty, but when it
doesn't show up I figure you're still fighting the effects of using
your helmet for a plow in Idaho last summer. If you're just waiting

We're gonna stress test the kids with KLR650s on some knarly TST this

technicolor, senso-round, feelo-vision.

Thanks for giving a shit, y'all.  I didn't know this post would elicit
the responses it did, but I'm glad it did.  I'll do my part and work
on some write-ups.  Utah was un-freaking-believeable, and I've crossed
some milestones this year I'd like to tell (ahem...Tami, what you saw
in Idaho was not remotely representative of my ability - I was just
Spodely).

Dean:  Miss you, too, man.  The last time I saw you in CT was also the
last time I saw my father.  Whether you like it or not, you two are
linked.

Thanks to all who reinstilled my belief in riding, and sharing.
please do more of it, and I promise to do the same.

Someone else hit it on the head, and David's reincarnation of a '98 RR drove
the point home.

When you keep riding the same areas, it feels like nothing new to report.
The obvious solution is for everyone to ride new areas.  Along those lines,
I'm proposed the RMD exchange-rider program.  We pick a partner from another
region, swap bikes, houses, wifes, and jobs with them and write new ride
reports.

The other option is to intentionally start making adventures out of every
ride.  Bring a new guy and put him in way over his head.  Once you're 30
miles into the backcountry, wring a commitment for a ride report out of him
if he ever wants to see his family again.

Maybe it's because I'm looking for new challenges that I've started putting
together knarly dual-sport rides.  It brings a whole new outlook to the same
old trails.
