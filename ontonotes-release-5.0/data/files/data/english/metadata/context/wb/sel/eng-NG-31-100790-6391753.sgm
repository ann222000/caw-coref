Microsoft To Announce The Xbox 360 Elite

By Dean Takahashi
Saturday, March 24th, 2007 at 2:15 pm in Dean Takahashi, Gaming,
General.

Rumors have floated in the past month that Microsoft will launch a new
high-end version of the Xbox 360. It's true that Microsoft is
preparing to announce the Xbox 360 Elite, a version of the game
console with black plastic and advanced features. Several sources
confirmed Microsoft plans to add this box to its product line.

The new box will go on sale in limited quantities soon for $479. The
details may not be precise here, but I believe it will have an HDMI
connector so that you can connect at the highest speed to a high-
definition TV. It will come with a 120-gigabyte hard disk drive and
will have IPTV capability.

Bill Gates announced in January that the Xbox 360 was capable of
serving as a set-top box for IPTV, or Internet Protocol TV, which
phone companies such as AT&amp;T are using to offer high-definition movies
and scores of channels in competition with TV.

The Xbox 360 Elite will apparently not come with a built-in HD-DVD
drive, which will remain an option for playing high-definition movie
disks. In the spring, the new machine will be available in limited
quantities and it will reflect a redesigned motherboard. Tina Conley,
an outside spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to comment on Saturday.
How solid is this information? Some details may be wrong. I'm not
looking at any press release right now that describes it all. The
details will be announced soon enough.

I've been waiting for Microsoft to make a move like this. The company
has scheduled a motherboard redesign and cost reduction for every
year, but this is the first major change to take the costs out of the
inside of the Xbox 360. By the fall, the company will also implement a
chip redesign, shifting from 90-nanometer production to 65 nanometer
production. That will bring costs down fairly dramatically and will
enable Microsoft to make the box in larger quantities by the fourth
quarter.

Every other year, the company plans to shrink the size of its chips.
It is overdue for a shift from the 90-nanometer chips that it started
with in 2005 to the 65-nanometer chips commonly in production
elsewhere. That transition isn't yet complete but it should be by the
fall.

Why is it important to miniaturize a chip? When you make the width
between circuits in a chip (the difference between 90 and 65), the
technology gets better. The electrons travel shorter distances, the
circuits are more reliable, defects can go down, yields go up, and you
can fit the same chip design in a much smaller area. Since chip costs
directly relate to how much material you use, a smaller chip is
cheaper to make.

Every console maker will have the opportunity to reduce the costs of
its chips. But how the console makers capitalize on that decision
depends on strategy.  Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan,
said in an email that he believes Microsoft will launch its elite box,
but he isn't sure how it will position the other boxes, especially the
Core unit. I expect the Xbox 360 with the 20-gigabyte hard disk drive
will continue to sell for $399 and the Core unit, which has no hard
drive, will sell for $299.

At $479, the Xbox 360 Elite will still be cheaper than Sony's $499 20-
gigabyte PlayStation 3 and the $599 60-gigabyte PS 3. But it will
match the Sony box with the HDMI connector feature. The Sony box is
not yet capable of IPTV.

It is interesting that Microsoft hasn't added the HD-DVD drive as a
permanent feature. The format war with Blu-ray is still going on, and
that drive would add considerable cost. Microsoft sells it separately
for $199.

The larger hard drive on the Xbox 360 Elite will make it much more
useful for downloading movies and serving as a digital video recorder,
which is one of the primary uses of an IPTV set-top box. High-
definition movies can take up five gigabytes or more, while standard
movies take about a gigabyte of storage space. Hence, 120 gigabytes is
enough for, accounting for 10 gigabytes used by the system for other
things, about 22 HD movies.

In any case, this is going to put some pressure on Sony and it will
enable Microsoft to patch some holes in the technological capability
of the Xbox 360. It will enable Microsoft to please the relatively
small group of hardcore gamers who care about having the highest-end
technology in the living room. It's those gamers who are most tempted
by the PS 3. HDMI, for instance, will enable someone to view games and
movies the way they were meant to be seen in either 720p or 1080p
resolutions.

If MS introduce a new 360 with functionality that isn't possible in the

&gt;&gt;&gt; an outside spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to comment on Saturday.
&gt;&gt;&gt; How solid is this information? Some details may be wrong. I'm not
&gt;&gt;&gt; looking at any press release right now that describes it all. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; details will be announced soon enough.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've been waiting for Microsoft to make a move like this. The company
&gt;&gt;&gt; has scheduled a motherboard redesign and cost reduction for every
&gt;&gt;&gt; year, but this is the first major change to take the costs out of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; inside of the Xbox 360. By the fall, the company will also implement a
&gt;&gt;&gt; chip redesign, shifting from 90-nanometer production to 65 nanometer
&gt;&gt;&gt; production. That will bring costs down fairly dramatically and will
&gt;&gt;&gt; enable Microsoft to make the box in larger quantities by the fourth
&gt;&gt;&gt; quarter.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Every other year, the company plans to shrink the size of its chips.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is overdue for a shift from the 90-nanometer chips that it started
&gt;&gt;&gt; with in 2005 to the 65-nanometer chips commonly in production
&gt;&gt;&gt; elsewhere. That transition isn't yet complete but it should be by the
&gt;&gt;&gt; fall.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is it important to miniaturize a chip? When you make the width
&gt;&gt;&gt; between circuits in a chip (the difference between 90 and 65), the
&gt;&gt;&gt; technology gets better. The electrons travel shorter distances, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; circuits are more reliable, defects can go down, yields go up, and you
&gt;&gt;&gt; can fit the same chip design in a much smaller area. Since chip costs
&gt;&gt;&gt; directly relate to how much material you use, a smaller chip is
&gt;&gt;&gt; cheaper to make.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Every console maker will have the opportunity to reduce the costs of
&gt;&gt;&gt; its chips. But how the console makers capitalize on that decision
&gt;&gt;&gt; depends on strategy.  Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan,
&gt;&gt;&gt; said in an email that he believes Microsoft will launch its elite box,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but he isn't sure how it will position the other boxes, especially the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Core unit. I expect the Xbox 360 with the 20-gigabyte hard disk drive
&gt;&gt;&gt; will continue to sell for $399 and the Core unit, which has no hard
&gt;&gt;&gt; drive, will sell for $299.

&gt;&gt;&gt; At $479, the Xbox 360 Elite will still be cheaper than Sony's $499 20-
&gt;&gt;&gt; gigabyte PlayStation 3 and the $599 60-gigabyte PS 3. But it will
&gt;&gt;&gt; match the Sony box with the HDMI connector feature. The Sony box is
&gt;&gt;&gt; not yet capable of IPTV.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is interesting that Microsoft hasn't added the HD-DVD drive as a
&gt;&gt;&gt; permanent feature. The format war with Blu-ray is still going on, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; that drive would add considerable cost. Microsoft sells it separately
&gt;&gt;&gt; for $199.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The larger hard drive on the Xbox 360 Elite will make it much more
&gt;&gt;&gt; useful for downloading movies and serving as a digital video recorder,
&gt;&gt;&gt; which is one of the primary uses of an IPTV set-top box. High-
&gt;&gt;&gt; definition movies can take up five gigabytes or more, while standard
&gt;&gt;&gt; movies take about a gigabyte of storage space. Hence, 120 gigabytes is
&gt;&gt;&gt; enough for, accounting for 10 gigabytes used by the system for other
&gt;&gt;&gt; things, about 22 HD movies.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In any case, this is going to put some pressure on Sony and it will
&gt;&gt;&gt; enable Microsoft to patch some holes in the technological capability
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the Xbox 360. It will enable Microsoft to please the relatively
&gt;&gt;&gt; small group of hardcore gamers who care about having the highest-end
&gt;&gt;&gt; technology in the living room. It's those gamers who are most tempted
&gt;&gt;&gt; by the PS 3. HDMI, for instance, will enable someone to view games and
&gt;&gt;&gt; movies the way they were meant to be seen in either 720p or 1080p
&gt;&gt;&gt; resolutions.

&gt;&gt; I assume that the regular 360 would be similarly IPTV capable? Although
&gt;&gt; it would need the 120Gb drive as an option to be useful.

&gt;&gt; If MS introduce a new 360 with functionality that isn't possible in the
&gt;&gt; regular machine (I can live without HDMI) I can see some very unhappy
&gt;&gt; people
&gt; Me too, I can see hate posts like the one the PS3 is getting over its
&gt; price. A revamped 360 would cost a bit, even if you traded in the current
&gt; version

&gt; Martin
">

$479 to $600 (since the 20 GB version is impossible to find) is a $121
difference. That is quite a bit so I really don't see many people
complaining. Besides, the price point for Sony has only become a problem
because there are NO games and they're losing exclusives left and right to a
cheaper console. Every console goes through different versions and the pace
of technology is likely going to decrease the time frame of those versions.
I have no doubt Sony will switch to cheaper technology once it's possible.
Everybody already knows those who buy earlier in a console's lifespan get
screwed in one way or another. It happened with the PS2, it'll happen with
the 360 and PS3 too.

I also wouldn't put it past Microsoft to sell the 120 GB HD as a standalone
purchase a few months after the release of the new 360 just like they
released the 20 GB HD for those that bought the core to add to their
machine. Anybody that doesn't want HDMI and IPTV functionality can simply
purchase the 120 GB HD.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Microsoft To Announce The Xbox 360 Elite

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By Dean Takahashi
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Saturday, March 24th, 2007 at 2:15 pm in Dean Takahashi, Gaming,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; General.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rumors have floated in the past month that Microsoft will launch a new
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; high-end version of the Xbox 360. It's true that Microsoft is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preparing to announce the Xbox 360 Elite, a version of the game
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; console with black plastic and advanced features. Several sources
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confirmed Microsoft plans to add this box to its product line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The new box will go on sale in limited quantities soon for $479. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; details may not be precise here, but I believe it will have an HDMI
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; connector so that you can connect at the highest speed to a high-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; definition TV. It will come with a 120-gigabyte hard disk drive and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will have IPTV capability.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill Gates announced in January that the Xbox 360 was capable of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; serving as a set-top box for IPTV, or Internet Protocol TV, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phone companies such as AT&amp;T are using to offer high-definition movies
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and scores of channels in competition with TV.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Xbox 360 Elite will apparently not come with a built-in HD-DVD
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drive, which will remain an option for playing high-definition movie
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disks. In the spring, the new machine will be available in limited
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quantities and it will reflect a redesigned motherboard. Tina Conley,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an outside spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to comment on Saturday.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How solid is this information? Some details may be wrong. I'm not

&gt; Plus (this is sad....) I really like the white 360. I would hate to have a
&gt; black one (wouldn't go with my decor!)
">

Yes, that's one sad complaint, lol. But it's also something you don't have
to worry about. From everything I have read, the black version is going to
be a "limited edition" of a few hundred thousand units. Then it will be
released in a white version later.

I don't care about HDMI. I've got a VGA adapter and a very large, good
quality monitor that looks better than any HDTV will anyway, even though it
may not be 70000 gazillion inches large. It would be great to have a 120 gig
drive though, even though i still haven't filled up my 20.

Back when Microsoft was talking about the HD era of gaming it was
strange to me how at the same time they weren't supporting DVI or
HDMI. Yes you can do 720p and 1080i over component, but an all digital
connection just makes more sense.

My next set will have component, HDMI and VGA, it will be nice to use
the best inputs available.

Component has No problem and looks just as good as HDMI at 1080P.  The #1
reason for HDMI is because it's Digital, and because it's Digital you can
COPY PROTECT it with Digital Rights Management(DRM).  The #2 Reason is
Simplicity of setup, but it also has it's own problems besides the failed
connection problems because of the DRM, but because it's a tiny plug with No
type of connection to hold it securely in place like the DVI or VGA cables
for example.  This can cause picture quality problems, and you have to make
sure the cable is Secured in such a way it's not under a load.  It's just a
Bad Design.   HDMI is not the answer.  There are a couple Open formats
coming that are a lot better and I hope in the end they just replace HDMI
all together.   VGA is also a format that works quite well and with even
higher Resolutions on PC Monitors then HDMI does on HDTV's!  HDMI is just
the last thing needed to close the Analog Hole.  You can't really copy
protect a Analog Signal.   Oh sure there was Microvision for VCR's, but a
little cheap Box connected to the Video out and problem solved.  Copy away.

Unless you really need HDMI because your 1080P HDTV for some reason doesn't
have a VGA Port, though MOST DO, then a new 360 may be your only choice in
the matter, otherwise your fine with what you have, and go and just get the
larger 120 Gig HDD is you need more space, which I have for a long time now.
Quite frankly, even if you connect your 360 to your 1080P HDTV using
component, your 1080P HDTV will STILL convert it on it's own to 1080P for
display anyway, so wither the 360 does it or your HDTV does it, it's pretty
much the SAME THING.

In that story they say the Elite will be priced at $ 479 (about £ 244 UKP)
and the Premium will remain at $ 399 (about £ 203 UKP) how does this
translate to UK prices where the Premium costs £ 279. Will the Premium will
remain @ £ 279 and the Elite cost £ 320 or will they reduce the price of the
Premium and leave any price-cuts untill the 65nm version is available in the
fall?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Microsoft To Announce The Xbox 360 Elite

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By Dean Takahashi
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Saturday, March 24th, 2007 at 2:15 pm in Dean Takahashi, Gaming,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; General.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rumors have floated in the past month that Microsoft will launch a new
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; high-end version of the Xbox 360. It's true that Microsoft is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preparing to announce the Xbox 360 Elite, a version of the game
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; console with black plastic and advanced features. Several sources
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confirmed Microsoft plans to add this box to its product line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The new box will go on sale in limited quantities soon for $479. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; details may not be precise here, but I believe it will have an HDMI
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; connector so that you can connect at the highest speed to a high-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; definition TV. It will come with a 120-gigabyte hard disk drive and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will have IPTV capability.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill Gates announced in January that the Xbox 360 was capable of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; serving as a set-top box for IPTV, or Internet Protocol TV, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phone companies such as AT&amp;T are using to offer high-definition movies
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and scores of channels in competition with TV.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Xbox 360 Elite will apparently not come with a built-in HD-DVD
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drive, which will remain an option for playing high-definition movie
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disks. In the spring, the new machine will be available in limited
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quantities and it will reflect a redesigned motherboard. Tina Conley,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an outside spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to comment on Saturday.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How solid is this information? Some details may be wrong. I'm not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; looking at any press release right now that describes it all. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; details will be announced soon enough.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've been waiting for Microsoft to make a move like this. The company
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has scheduled a motherboard redesign and cost reduction for every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; year, but this is the first major change to take the costs out of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inside of the Xbox 360. By the fall, the company will also implement a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chip redesign, shifting from 90-nanometer production to 65 nanometer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; production. That will bring costs down fairly dramatically and will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enable Microsoft to make the box in larger quantities by the fourth
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quarter.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every other year, the company plans to shrink the size of its chips.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is overdue for a shift from the 90-nanometer chips that it started
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with in 2005 to the 65-nanometer chips commonly in production
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elsewhere. That transition isn't yet complete but it should be by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fall.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is it important to miniaturize a chip? When you make the width
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; between circuits in a chip (the difference between 90 and 65), the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; technology gets better. The electrons travel shorter distances, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; circuits are more reliable, defects can go down, yields go up, and you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can fit the same chip design in a much smaller area. Since chip costs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; directly relate to how much material you use, a smaller chip is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cheaper to make.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every console maker will have the opportunity to reduce the costs of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; its chips. But how the console makers capitalize on that decision
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; depends on strategy.  Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said in an email that he believes Microsoft will launch its elite box,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but he isn't sure how it will position the other boxes, especially the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Core unit. I expect the Xbox 360 with the 20-gigabyte hard disk drive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will continue to sell for $399 and the Core unit, which has no hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drive, will sell for $299.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At $479, the Xbox 360 Elite will still be cheaper than Sony's $499 20-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gigabyte PlayStation 3 and the $599 60-gigabyte PS 3. But it will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; match the Sony box with the HDMI connector feature. The Sony box is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not yet capable of IPTV.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is interesting that Microsoft hasn't added the HD-DVD drive as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; permanent feature. The format war with Blu-ray is still going on, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that drive would add considerable cost. Microsoft sells it separately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for $199.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The larger hard drive on the Xbox 360 Elite will make it much more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; useful for downloading movies and serving as a digital video recorder,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which is one of the primary uses of an IPTV set-top box. High-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; definition movies can take up five gigabytes or more, while standard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; movies take about a gigabyte of storage space. Hence, 120 gigabytes is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enough for, accounting for 10 gigabytes used by the system for other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; things, about 22 HD movies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In any case, this is going to put some pressure on Sony and it will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enable Microsoft to patch some holes in the technological capability
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the Xbox 360. It will enable Microsoft to please the relatively
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; small group of hardcore gamers who care about having the highest-end
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; technology in the living room. It's those gamers who are most tempted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by the PS 3. HDMI, for instance, will enable someone to view games and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; movies the way they were meant to be seen in either 720p or 1080p
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resolutions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I assume that the regular 360 would be similarly IPTV capable? Although
&gt;&gt;&gt; it would need the 120Gb drive as an option to be useful.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If MS introduce a new 360 with functionality that isn't possible in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; regular machine (I can live without HDMI) I can see some very unhappy
&gt;&gt;&gt; people
&gt;&gt; Me too, I can see hate posts like the one the PS3 is getting over its
&gt;&gt; price. A revamped 360 would cost a bit, even if you traded in the current
&gt;&gt; version

&gt;&gt; Martin

&gt;$479 to $600 (since the 20 GB version is impossible to find) is a $121
&gt;difference. That is quite a bit so I really don't see many people
&gt;complaining. Besides, the price point for Sony has only become a problem
&gt;because there are NO games and they're losing exclusives left and right to a
&gt;cheaper console. Every console goes through different versions and the pace
&gt;of technology is likely going to decrease the time frame of those versions.
&gt;I have no doubt Sony will switch to cheaper technology once it's possible.
&gt;Everybody already knows those who buy earlier in a console's lifespan get
&gt;screwed in one way or another. It happened with the PS2, it'll happen with
&gt;the 360 and PS3 too.
">

Sony has already started to lower their hardware costs by switching to
ps2 software emulation for the European release of the PS3  and I
suspect they'll do the same very soon in the US.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I also wouldn't put it past Microsoft to sell the 120 GB HD as a standalone
&gt;purchase a few months after the release of the new 360 just like they
&gt;released the 20 GB HD for those that bought the core to add to their
&gt;machine. Anybody that doesn't want HDMI and IPTV functionality can simply
&gt;purchase the 120 GB HD.
">

Microsoft will absolutely sell the 120GB HD separately.  Fans would
scream bloody murder if they didn't.  It wont be cheap though, I
expect a price of at least $149.

BTW, IPTV will be made available to all 360 models.

As far as the bigger HD goes, the "Video Marketplace" happened.  If
you aren't into downloading movie/TV content, there STILL is no reason
for anything bigger than the 20 gig HD.  Unless you like keeping year-
old demos around, I guess..

yeah, I'm sure there was a collective "d'oh" heard around the Microsoft
campus when their IPTV pimps realized that there was only 10 gigs or so
available for downloads, which quickly turned into evil cackling as they
realized that now they get to sell large hard drives AND expensivish movie
downloads to all that swear that the 360 isn't anything more than a game
console and that high def isn't important instead of just including a high
def drive from the get go, but ~whooooaaa, tah PsthuhrEe ish teh espenseev~

You're mixing up Microsoft with Nintendo. The 360 has always supported high
def and the new 360 won't have a high def drive built in either.

MS had a HDMI/bigger HDD version planned before the 360 launched, much
less any competition launched.   We are all wondering why HD-DVD
wasn't included though.   Oh, and MS added support for 1080p awhile
ago; as long as your TV accepted VGA or Component cables.
