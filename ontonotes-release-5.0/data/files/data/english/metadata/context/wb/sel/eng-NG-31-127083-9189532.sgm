I quit for over 1 year and actually started training for a triathlon.
In July I started smoking again to cope with sadness due to my
relationship.  Now it is October and I'm still smoking and no longer
working out.  I'm missing out on the training and the friends that
used to work out with.  I keep trying to quit. but the stress of
work gets me by 4pm.  I'm now feeling like I'm addicted again.
Any inspiration for me?

Mid afternoon slump eh? I get that way with sweets. first of all I would
distract myself with something else (a brisk walk, ice cold water, sucking
on lemon wedges) etc taking a moment out to just breath and calm down, or
pop in here and post.
also would a NRT help you? might help you get over that slump.

Get back to training even if you have to start slow again .getting back into
the groove will give you confinence and around others who are not smoking
and where you want to be.
you can do this.

Kris - You did it once, you can do it again. NOTHING is worth giving
up your quit. Just start over. Your &quot;relationship&quot; may not get better,
but you can quit again. You didn't really give up - you just got
derailed for a time. Just don't smoke - not even one - it's not worth
it. Go back to the training and friends you had before. They can help
you in a way that we can't. You need the workouts and training and
they will make you feel better.
Hugs,
Pam

Hi Kristin and welcome to AS3!

My best advice to you at this moment would be to read back on the
group. Just recently there were some very inspirational threads from
old fogeys who quit years and decades ago. Also from some folks that
god the nudge from the Judge and survived it. And from those in
various stages of their quits who have started reaping what they sown.

You, too, can do it. Every single quitter here had to start from day
one. If you *want* to quit, nothing can stop you.
It may not be easy, but it is probably one of the most rewarding
thing, both physically and spiritually, that you will do in your life.
You can never be a happy smoker again. You have tasted freedom.
There is only one way for you from here!

Kristin,

I think so. I first came to AS3 in the late 90s... I forget the exact
year. Stayed quit for a couple of years and then decided that I would
have &quot;just one&quot;. We all know what that means, don't we? Well, seven
years later, I dragged my butt back to AS3. I now have almost three
months without a cigarette.

My thinking during the previous seven years when I was smoking was very
strange. I quickly fell back into thinking that it would be impossible
for me to quit! I felt like I would be a smoker my whole life. Kristin,
you may have forgotten just like I did that it IS possible to quit. We
CAN be non-smokers. You too can become a non-smoker like you were
before. You had a year smober, remember??? You CAN quit again. The
monster we believe is waiting for us when we quit is in reality only a
pesky mosquito that bothers us less and less the further away we get
from our last cigarette.

Look, I'm NOT saying that quitting is a breeze. It isn't. But have a
plan. I'm sure you'll get PLENTY of suggestions in this group for tools
you can use; nicotine gum, Chantix, Wellbutrin, cold turkey are some of
the various ways we AS3'ers have successfully quit smoking. You choose
the one that you think will work for you.

Above all, read the posts here and post your own messages when you need
to. We are a very supportive group of people. You've already taken one
huge step by posting this message so follow through with it.

Good luck and I look forward to seeing your next post.  :)

Kris, all the information so far is very on-target.  To give yourself
a fast 'total immersion' about smobriety, I suggest you go to our
unofficial webpage at www.quitbuddies.org .  Our FAQs are there as well
as a ton of other information on smobriety and links to several other
sites of use.  Do come here often and read and post as much as you
can.  Get focused, set a date to quit and go for it.  You have been
here before so you do know some of the downfalls and can do it
again.

Hi Kristin,

Uggggh, don't despair!  Do you remember what it felt like to truly
breathe?  Dopamine high and all?  Get that mindset back and go for it.
Only you can make this decision to get back to where you want to be.
Just do it!!!

You only have one life to live, please don't waste it on inhaling a
4000+ toxic cocktail...

cheerios,

i suspect the truth is that you never got over your addiction in the first
place. a lot of people make the mistake of thinking that after a relatively
short period of time they have overcome their addiction whereas in reality
it tends to hang around for a lot longer, often in subtle forms.

after a year of not smoking you thought that you needed to smoke in order to
deal with your relationship sadness. you didn't need to smoke and smoking
wasn't going to help you at all but for some reason you decided that smoking
was a viable solution and you need to understand why you did that. you are
now saying that you need to smoke to deal with work stress but you don't so
you need to think about that as well.

you are addicted to smoking and you need to understand that as an 'addict'
you are capable of coming up with no end of 'reasons' why you need/want to
smoke and that they are all lies.  take a good look at as3's junkie
thinking.

smoking is not going to do anything that's beneficial for you. in fact the
opposite is true and smoking is going to do nothing but harm you and stop
you from doing things and living your life to the full.  you're missing out
on the training and friends that you used to work out with but that's only
the beginning and  not being able to take part in a triathlon is a shame but
not being able to walk up a flight of stairs without getting dizzy and
feeling that your lungs are collapsing is a tragedy and that's what you have
to 'look forward' to if you keep smoking (and all the other shitty stuff
that smoking can do to your body)!

if you're going to stop smoking you have to understand that smoking doesn't
help anything! smoking will only ever make things worse because whatever
your problems are, smoking will just add another problem to them.

decide what you want for yourself. decide what's important to you. make the
choice and commit yourself to it.

my advice is.......stop smoking right now and get back into training.

but the question is...........what do you want?

one last thing, putting off the decision to stop smoking is the same as
deciding to continue.

best wishes

richard

Nah.. you started smoking because you lit up that one cigarette. And
did it help you at all to cope? I doubt it. All it got you were
additional problems. Stinky clothes, burn holes, rollercoated of need
and feed nicotine, not working out anymore, lost social contacts.. You
would've gotten through the sadness whithout smoking as well.

It's the withdrawal that gets you at 4 MP. You been without a smoke
long enough for the feeding cues to get overwhelming. You get nervous,
jittery, impatient, and all you can think of is that cigarette you can
smoke when work is done. Try and remember your 4pm's at work, while
you were smober that year. Do you recall them as being so stressful
you just HAD to smoke?

This may sound hard but ex-addict is a word that is non-existent. Once
you quit, the only thing that keeps you from smoking is never take the
next one again. Once you do, you fall back hostage to your addiction.
You will forever be on probation. 1 is either all or go through
withdrawal again. So far, you are opting for all, instead of
withdrawal. However, all is forever, withdrawal is temporary.

My heart goes out to you.  It is so hard to make changes and
backsliding is part of the process of growth.  I agree with getting
back to training even if you have to do less or go slowly - your real
friends will support you for turning the corner and coming back.

Recognize you took a BIG step in writing this out here.  A BIG step.
It takes a lot to lay this out.

You'll be in my thoughts.  Stephanie

You are an addict, as we all are here. When you had relationship trouble
and you started smoking it did not help you cope it gave you the added
problem of being a smoker again. Read and post, read and learn about
your addiction. Get back into training, not just the physical side of it
but the mental side too. You sound young, get it done *now* while you
can benefit from your health.
You can do it.
Regards Chris

I know this sounds like I am selling something, but I found Allen

I found that I was looking at quitting all wrong, my mentality was
wrong, and it really helped.  Its been in print for 20 some-odd years,
and it was good to read.

I love the replies this post has gotten.
I love the reminders that the addiction doesn't go away.
I've heard things like.....
While I'm in here, my addiction is in parking lot doing pushups.
If you put down a devil, when you pick him back up he brings 7 more
with him.
But my favorite is the theory of progression.
While I'm not smoking, my addiction continues to gain strength.
If I pick up another cigarette I will be as addicted as I would have
been had I never put them down.
I don't get to go back to where I was when I put them down.
What ever time I have without a cigarette, whether it is 4 hours, 4
days, 4 weeks, 4 months, 4 years or 4 decades, I have to guard it with
my life.  If I lose it, I may never get it back.
Thank-you AS3!!!!!
