Hinson Lake,

Wow, what fun!  Thanks again to Tom, your awesome family, Doug,
Sarah Jane, Trey Barnes and everyone else who helped out in making
this another fantastic event.  Oh, and to be blessed with such great
weather yet again.  How lucky are we?  Would have liked to have gotten
in a few more miles than I did, but I started to get a sore leg and
after the stress fracture at Umstead, thought it might be wise to
scale back a bit.  Alas, the scaling back was not quite enough and I
spent the morning at the hospital being treated for, yet again,
another stress fracture.  In the other leg this time.  Can you believe
exactly six months to the date?  My license plate says RUN 50's, and I
guess that's just what I'm destined to do, and not a mile more.  So,
for the time being, if anybody needs crew, I'm available.  Well, at
least when I get off these crutches...

See you all soon,

Susan

One week before last year's Hinson I had run a 100K, my longest run at that time.  I then came out to Hinson and hobbled through a 50K and vowed to make Hinson a main event during my '07 calendar.  And I did just that, breaking my personal record of 100K by running, walking, plodding, crawling through 70.5 miles.

I can't even begin to describe the amazing spirit and cameraderie of this event.  The atmosphere was incredible.  I enjoyed many miles and banterings with MTC friends Mark, Darryl, Tony, Jeff, Fred, Susan, Frank.

A special thanks to Tom, his family, and his crew (Doug and Trey among many others) for pulling off a stellar event.  I am certain to have this on my calendar in '08 as well.

Susan, I feel so badly for you regarding your new ailment.  I am in awe of your spirit and determination and your presence on the trail was certainly inspiring for me.  Heal quickly, my friend.

david

susan,
real sorry to hear about your new broken leg. that is awful luck. you really push youself to the limit. that is not always a good thing. i sure hope you heal up stronger than ever and are able to enjoy running soon.
i want to thank tom and all of the helpers also for putting on another great event. everything went well for me and anita. the bright moon and train sounds at night, the sunrise, seeing all of our friends made the whole thing special. i could name lots of people to thank but there are too many. i do want to name trey and doug and the others that stayed up during the long nighttime hours. thanks, again.

OK, I know this is getting cheesy by now, but I have to say this.  On my way home from work this evening, I realized that my email was correct - I DID enjoy banterings with Frank, but also with Fred, whom I originally left off!  I guess I should refrain from creating emails before 6am!

And Frank, my wife loves talking with you!!!

Dave,

We know we what you meant.

As I said during the event... the Hinson Lake 24 hour is our MTC &quot;annual reunion&quot;. Chat, eat, run, sleep, chat, run, eat, throw-up, run, eat, sleep, wake up with a hangover.

Tom, his family, Doug, Sarah Jane, Trey, and all the other folks that volunteered allowed all of us, including our drunk uncle Mark (90 mile man), to enjoy ourselves whatever we wanted to accomplish by coming to Hinson Lake.

For the past two years my reason is to see how bad off I am after spending the summer in Afghanistan. This year was worse then last...But I enjoyed myself just as much. Other then Mrs. Doom's injury, we had another great time at Hinson Lake.

Regards,
DOOM

(AKA - Fred)
