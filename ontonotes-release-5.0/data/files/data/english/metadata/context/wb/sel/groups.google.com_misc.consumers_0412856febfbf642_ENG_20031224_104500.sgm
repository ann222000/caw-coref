Anyone have any recommndations for a practically indestructable 3-ring
binder for my school kids? Even the best 3-ring binders sold at Office
Depot and similar stores for about $10 last only about 3 months before
falling apart. The hinges break and the rings become misaligned quickly.

I've seen aluminum binders with real hinges offered at several on line
retailers, and I'm wondering if the rings stay aligned. They cost about $30
to $40 each, but it's worth it to me if I they really last.

try using more, but narrower, binders. try binders made with the
semi-flexible plastic sheeting covers. offices often dump sales binders out
in batches (when cleaning the product library)

I don't use binders. the sheets of paper remain properly bunched together,
especially since I fold the thinner bunches in half. (or staple the corner.)

"/> Not off hand. How about disciplining your kids so they learn to treat
their school supplies properly? If it were my kids, replacement binders
would come out of their allowance.

"/> Or you can order binders with metal piano hinges and metal covers. They aren't
cheap. Should be available online...

binders should be bought with their own money that they have to

Otoh, why not let them live with shabby broken binders until
they're willing to pay for new ones?

"/> it's got nothing to do with how well the kids take care of the
binders. Our kids have the same problem. It's the absolutely crappy
construction that makes them fall apart. It's a common problem
amongst
school kids.

"/> So you have kids and their binders last the entire year? Tell me what kind
of binders they have.

Or do they go to a school where they hardly have to do any work?

"/> i have several binders for work-related stuff that i schlep in
and out of my car and in and out of briefcases all the time. all
of them are at least a year old, and don't show much wear. they
are standard view binders (transparent covers that allow
insertion of printed material for the spine and covers.

of course, i *do* try to not abuse them, but they do get stuff
dumped on them when they're on the rear car seat, and one gets
stashed regularly under the car's front passenger seat. they all
look fine.

a similar binder should be able to withstand a year of a child's
school use if the child took reasonable care of it. if your
binders are falling apart, stop buying them at walmart.

"/> I remember using binders when I was in school and I'd have the same one or
two for the entire school year. Yeah, by the end of the year they were
often pretty shabby looking, but they were still doing their job and they
weren't considered fashion statements back then so I didn't care what they
looked like. (Corporations like Meade, with their Sponge Bob and Britney
binders and whatnot, have unfortunately done a good job of making school
supplies 'fashion accessories'.)
