Data from Indian call
centres being sold: report
By
IANS
Sunday October 1
http://in.news.yahoo.com/061001/43/683m3.html

London,
Oct 1 (IANS) Sensitive personal information of British customers from Indian
call centres are being sold for a price, according to an investigation by
Channel 4, The Sunday Times reported.

The
Channel 4 programme, as part of its 'Dispatches' series, is titled 'The Data
Theft Scandal' and is to be shown on Channel 4 Thursday.

The
details are likely to increase demands to close down call centres of British
banks and other companies in India.

The
report based on the programme said that data available for sale included credit
card data, along with passport and driving licence numbers. The details are
reportedly being 'sold to the highest bidder'.

The
report added that middlemen were offering bulk packages of tens of thousands of
credit card numbers for sale. They even have access to taped telephone
conversations in which British customers disclose sensitive security
information to call centre staff, it said.

The
Sunday Times recalled that in June an HSBC employee in Bangalore was arrested
after 230,000 pounds was stolen from British customers' accounts.

The
report quoted Stewart Room, head of the data protection unit at Rowe Cohen
solicitors, as saying that the investigation highlighted serious breaches of
customer confidentiality.

'Customers
are going to be outraged by this. By giving your data to a firm in Britain, you
don't assume it's going to end up being sold in India,' he said.

During
the investigation for Channel 4's Dispatches, one middleman offering stolen
data, Sushant Chandak, reportedly offered to sell a database with the credit
card details of 200,000 people as commercial 'leads'.

At
a meeting in Kolkata, he boasted of a network of agents in call centres across
India. 'I have a good rapport with them. We cooperate. I pay them, so they
trust me,' he is reported to have said.
In
addition to credit card numbers, Chandak was also offering passport numbers,
driving licence numbers and personal banking details.

In
a separate meeting, the report said that Chandak offered the details of 8,000
British mobile phone users.

In
the programme, the report said that Chandak was seen grinning on the film as a
British woman is coaxed into giving the security number on the back of her
credit card. The caller claims to be from a British company that sells mobile
phones.

In
a meeting in New Delhi, a second middleman, only known as Ghufran, reportedly
offered details of customers with Halifax, Nationwide, Woolwich, Bank of
Scotland and NatWest for five pound each.

Ghufran
claimed the information was obtained by technical support staff who visited
call centres and used memory sticks to download recent sale transactions.

The
report added that Chandak and Ghufran had denied unlawfully selling
information. Chandak said the information he provided was not genuine, while
Ghufran said he was passed the data.

IT Risks Rise on USB Drives

Insiders
stealing relatively large amounts of data on tiny USB memory sticks have
already made the ubiquitous devices a potent security threat. But the emergence
of flash drives capable of storing and auto-running applications straight off
the device will likely make them an even greater security headache.

This
danger is not going unnoticed by IT professionals.

USB
thumb drives pose a pretty big threat within the medical industry if not
properly managed, said Chris Anderson, an assistant analyst at John C. Lincoln
Health Network in Phoenix. And his company has already deployed tools to
protect against these new problems.

Demonstrating
the potential risks, Hak.5, a security-related podcast run by self-described
white-hat hackers, last month showed how a USB memory stick can be turned into
a device capable of automatically installing back doors, retrieving passwords
or grabbing software product codes.

What
makes it a security nightmare is that its a faster and automated way to do
existing threats, said Darren Kitchen, one of the hackers who hosts the Hak.5
podcasts from his home in Williamsburg, Va. What could have been done before
in four to five minutes can now be done in a few seconds, he said.

The
Hak.5 demonstration involved the use of a relatively new technology from
Redwood City, Calif.-based U3 LLC that lets software execute directly from USB
drives. Unlike traditional USB flash drives, U3 memory sticks are
self-activating and can automatically run applications when inserted into a
system by appearing to be a CD-ROM to a computer.

U3s
technology is designed to increase mobility by letting a user store his
personal desktop with his programs, passwords and other data on a memory stick
and then use them on any computer without worrying about whether those
applications are installed. Its among an emerging set of similar smart flash
drives from vendors such as Migo Software Inc. in Redwood City, Calif., and
Route 1 Inc. in Toronto.

But
this boon to mobile end users gives malicious hackers another way to compromise
systems, said John Pescatore, an analyst at Gartner Inc.

For
instance, Hak.5 has already developed and made publicly available payloads that
make it possible to use U3 thumb drives to automatically retrieve Windows
password hashes, browser histories and AOL Instant Messenger and MSN passwords.
For the moment, they only work if the user has full administrative privileges
on the computer in which the USB device is inserted. But in the works is a hack
that automatically escalates user privileges via a U3 drive. Another pending
hack deposits code on a computer that steals information off any USB key that
is subsequently inserted into the machine by e-mailing the data to another
location.

This
Thursday, Hak.5 will podcast its latest refinement of the USB hacks, Kitchen
said.

Most
people think of these things as storage sticks. What they dont realize is the
U3 is a little computer on a thumb drive, Pescatore said.

Companies
need to think seriously about managing USB storage devices, said Jonathan
Singer, an analyst at Yankee Group Research Inc. in Boston. You canhave a user
walk away with awhole bunch of information, or someones PCs could get owned by
a USB device they picked up in a parking lot, he said.

Anderson
said those concerns prompted Lincoln Health to install software from SecureWave
SA that lets administrators manage access of USB drives to computers.
SecureWaves product lets Lincoln Health prevent multiple USB device types from
being connected to its systems. IT can also monitor and audit activities in the
cases where end users are permitted to connect USB devices to their systems.

Fabi
Gower, vice president of IT at Martin, Fletcher, a health care company in
Irving, Texas, has also deployed similar technology from SecureWave. She said
she is reasonably confident that it should protect against threats such as
those associated with the U3 flash drives. Our security measures prohibit any
applications from being installed or running on the network unless it has been
authorized, Gower said. SecureWave provides a way to enforce this at the USB
device level, she said.

In
one sense, the threat is not new, said Robert Wesley McGrew, a research student
in computer security at Mississippi State University in Starkville. For
example, the ability to install malicious code on removable systems via CD-ROMs
has existed for several years, he said. What makes the U3 threat dangerous,
though, is the fact that the devices can retrieve and store data, he added.

Top Data theft by employees 'commonplace' : British Report
No
qualms about copying the customer database, says report

Britain
is a nation of thieves when it comes to the workplace, especially where data is
concerned, according to a recent report.

UK
businesses are the victims of high levels of data theft by staff, including
confidential documents, whole customer databases, business contacts and sales
leads, says a report from IT security firm Prefix.

The
majority of the 1,000 respondents admitted to stealing, but many do not
perceive their actions as 'wrong'.

"Clearly,
many employees do not see company theft as stealing and do not apply any 'moral
brakes' to such activities," said Graeme Pitts-Drake, chief executive at
Prefix.

"Nave
employers who continue to trust their staff blindly without relying on robust
security measures are asking for trouble."

Headline
findings from the Prefix Security Report include:

* 37 per cent of men believe it is
acceptable to take database information and sales leads
* 49 per cent of 16-24 year-olds do not
think that workplace theft is 'stealing'
* 73 per cent of graduate trainees admit
to office theft
* 56 per cent believe that companies
expect things 'to go walk-about'

Companies
are especially vulnerable to internal data theft, according to the report,
because 78 per cent of the workforce owns devices capable of downloading and
storing data, such as USB memory sticks or media players.

Small
firms in particular were shown to be at most risk of 'disappearing data'.

Top Scream alarm may stop phone theft
Security experts
have devised a system which triggers a high-pitched screech on a mobile phone
if it is stolen.
BBC
NEWS:
2006/10/01
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/technology/5397602.stm

The
service is also designed to prevent thieves from using stolen phones and
accessing the data contained on them.

Under
the new system, Remote XT, a signal is sent to the mobile once it is reported
lost or stolen, causing it to emit an alarm similar to a scream.

The
service is backed by the Mobile Industry Crime Action Forum and is aimed at
businessmen and women.

The
alarm noise is accompanied by a message, reading: "This phone is
stolen".

The
phone is also automatically disabled, with contact numbers, texts, images and
emails removed, even if the SIM card is removed.

Detective
Superintendent Steve Bending, head of the National Mobile Phone Crime Unit,
said: "The NMPCU is supportive of measures that make mobile phones less
desirable items to steal and worthless in the hands of those who seek to profit
from mobile phone criminality.

'Render it useless'

"Any
opportunity to disable a mobile phone and render it useless, should it be
stolen, is welcomed."

According
to BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw thefts of mobile phones are on the
increase.

Some
services have been developed to block the use of stolen SIM cards and handsets,
but these are not foolproof, he went on.

He
also added that the cost of the service will be almost 10 a month, which may
prove prohibitive to some.

Mark
Whiteman, managing director of Remote XT, said: "By making mobiles
unusable to anyone but the rightful owner, the phones become worthless and
we'll see (the) market for stolen handsets stamped out once and for all.

"Theft-proof
phones spell disaster for the huge criminal industry that has profited from
mobile theft for too long."

Top New IT Term of the day
data
deduplication
In
storage technology, deduplication essentially refers to the elimination of
redundant data. In the deduplication process, duplicate data is deleted,
leaving only one copy of the data to be stored. However, indexing of all data
is still retained should that data ever be required. Deduplication is able to
reduce the required storage capacity since only the unique data is stored.
Deduplication is also also written as de-duplication, and is synonymous with
data reduction or commonality factoring.

Do not live in the past, do not live in the future;
concentrate the mind on the present moment.
