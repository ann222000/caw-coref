I'm having a hard time figuring out how to get rid of the jagged pixels on
his image I have created for a logo.  The Red area is just a stroke on the
blue textured layer.  Any help would be appreciated.

The area is jaggy because it is too low resolution. I assume you're
making this for print.

Unfortunately, you've already started down the wrong path. You used
Photoshop. Photoshop is not te right tool for logos; logos need to be
used at many different sizes, and they need to be able to print crisply
and smoothly at any size. That means using Illustrator, not Photoshop.

Had you made the logo in Illustrator, it would print razor-sharp at any
size, even if you made it the size of a billboard.

I suggest you scrap the logo and re-create it correctly in Illustrator.
If you must use Photoshop for some reason, scrap the logo and re-make it
at a much higher resolution.

I'd second that. You should always work your art up at the largest
possible size if using any raster based tool, like PhotoShop. That way
you only have to scale the image down, rather than up, and jaggies are
less of an issue.

For logos, always use Illustrator as the size then doesn't matter.

Trace the logo inside Illustrator, or recreate it by hand.

I'm currently experimenting with the pen tool in Photoshop.  I don't have
Illustrator.  This is for the web only, not for print logo.  Tx Blah

&gt; IMHO, for that one, you'll have to put it onto the actual background
&gt; you'll
&gt; use.
