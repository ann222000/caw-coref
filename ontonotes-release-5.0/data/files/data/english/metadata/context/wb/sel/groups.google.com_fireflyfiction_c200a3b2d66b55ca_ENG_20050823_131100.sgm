*Kaywinnit Lee Frye. They call her Kaylee.*

Six tables and chairs sat spaced evenly into three rows. They sat with their
backs straight and faces forward, hands laid flat in front of them. The screen
at the front of the room flashed with images that burned into their brains. The
only muscles they moved were the ones attached to their ocular cavities.

*She has brown hair.*

Small white dots taped wires to the sides of their heads, their scalps, the
pulses in their necks. The wires quivered all the way to the left of the room,
to the computers that monitored the electrical impulses of their brains. The
spikes rose and fell with the timing of the screen.

*And freckles on her cheeks.*

Far beneath them, alone and unnoticed, he allowed himself the smile they
couldn't, let his brainwaves spike in a pleasure that was denied them. He
stretched his hands, let the bones and tendons creak into movement. Blood and
expectation pumped sluggish through his veins. A warmth he hadn't felt in
eighteen months.

*She makes River smile.*

***

Simon walked into the kitchen to see them sitting around the table. Nobody was
speaking much, but then nobody really had since the night before. It was almost
as if Serenity and the people within her were in a stunned form of grieving.
The only person who didn't want to be in the company of others was River. She
had holed herself up in her room and didn't want to leave. Everyone else stayed
in close proximity to each other.

&quot;She wants to go back.&quot; He felt numb. &quot;Wants to make a trade, herself for
Kaylee.&quot;

They took this information in silently. Zoe took Wash's hand and they shared a
look as he bent his head towards her. Inara brought her shaking hand up to her
mouth. Jayne gave a silent snarl. Book made a steeple of his hands. Mal eyed
him carefully.

&quot;And where do you stand on that, doc?&quot;

Simon felt everyone's eyes on him, felt their interest.

&quot;What? Where do I...?&quot; Disbelief and confusion sharpened into anger. &quot;How can
you ask me that? Better yet, where do *you* stand, Captain?&quot;

Mal didn't blink at the hostility in Simon's voice, he wasn't fool enough to
take it personally. He kept his eyes and his voice level.

&quot;I'm asking you.&quot;

&quot;She's my sister and I'm not going to just hand her back to those... those...&quot;
Simon took a breath. &quot;But it's Kaylee. I can't leave Kaylee with...&quot;

He looked straight at Mal.

&quot;I guess I don't stand anywhere.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; Mal nodded. &quot;Right answer.&quot;

&quot;So, what's the plan?&quot; Simon asked, still privately convinced Mal was a sadist.
&quot;I'm assuming there is a plan?&quot;

&quot;A vague semblance of one, yes.&quot;

&quot;We're taking the good doctor.&quot; Zoe stressed the word 'good' in a way that
suggested she thought otherwise. Vehemently. &quot;We need a contact.&quot;

&quot;Kidnapping&quot; Simon's jaw dropped. &quot;You're kidding, right?&quot;

&quot;I know where he lives, where he likes to spend his time, where he goes every
third day.&quot; Inara shrugged. &quot;Every little thing we need. It won't be too
difficult.&quot;

&quot;Assuming we don't get caught,&quot; Simon countered. &quot;he won't tell us anything, he
won't...&quot;

&quot;That,&quot; Mal broke in. &quot;is where River comes in handy.&quot;

Simon winced.

&quot;Hasn't she been through enough?&quot;

&quot;She ain't made of china, doc.&quot; Mal said it softly, but firm enough that he
knew Simon would listen. &quot;Matter of fact you keep telling us how much she's
been through and how much she's suffered, but what you don't seem to realize is
that she's bounced back from all of it. Maybe not a hundred percent, but she's
come through. She's able bodied and as long as she is, she's gonna help us get
Kaylee back. My way of thinking? If she's willing to put herself back into that
hell, it's a mite possible she'd be willing to try a few other things first.
Just a mite.&quot;

That made a lot of sense, actually, and Simon began to think that maybe he
should stop being so reactionary. Think before speaking, Mal had said, and it
was true here, too.

&quot;Even if she does help,&quot; he noted. &quot;the doctor won't know how to reach them.
All he had would have been a hotline, some anonymous message system, not a
direct link.&quot;

&quot;There is another way.&quot; Everyone turned to Book. &quot;I can reach them for you.&quot;

***

&quot;No!&quot; Kaylee woke with a start, jack-knifing her body as she fought people that
weren't there. She had to stop herself from falling off the small bunk. &quot;Leave
me alone!&quot;

Her fingers gripped the edges of the bed as she panted hard and tried to calm
herself as she looked around. It was a small room, bare and starkly white,
nothing save for herself, the bed and a small basin and toilet hatch. Kaylee
gasped and backed herself into the corner against the wall.

A man sat on the floor in the corner opposite her. Watching her. His elbows
rested on his knees. He smiled at her, friendly and soothing. Her eyes picked
up the strangest details as she allowed herself to breathe again. His hands
hung loosely past his knees, exposing thick wiry hairs that dotted his wrists,
his shoulders were wide and strong, his hair hung in loose brown curls just
past his ears and his dark brown eyes sparkled.

His hand rose up and brushed the side of his head gently. It was such an odd
gesture that Kaylee found herself echoing it as she watched him, her hand
running through her hair. Metal snagged her fingers and she tugged it free. Her
heart ached when she saw the hair clip River had given her.

When she looked up again, the man had gone.

***

&quot;What...?&quot; Simon felt himself hardening just a little, preparing for something
he wasn't sure about. &quot;What are you trying to say?&quot;

&quot;I think...&quot; Book spoke slowly, the words were almost too hard to speak, but
they also felt good after all this time. &quot;I think it's time I told you the
truth.&quot;

&quot;I'd say it is, too, Sheppard.&quot; Mal tightened his hold on his mug. &quot;You better
start speaking.&quot;

But Book was looking at Simon.

&quot;You sister already knows and she's made peace with it. I'll understand if you
don't.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Lord knows I haven't.&quot;

&quot;I knew it.&quot; Came Jayne's excited whisper. &quot;I knew he weren't a Sheppard.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I am.&quot; Book replied. &quot;I took my vows, lived in the Abbey off and on,
prayed up a storm. But I haven't always acted as one.&quot;

They waited for him to continue.

&quot;I worked for the military before and during the war. Alliance.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Mal couldn't resist it.

&quot;Covert Ops, which comes with all the specified training and abilities you'd
assume. My field was Undercover assignments, the more delicate ones.&quot;

Zoe looked at him.

&quot;You mean wet works? Assassinations, that kind of thing?&quot;

&quot;Not always.&quot; He admitted. &quot;But sometimes.&quot;

A few more bricks were added to Simon's wall of defense.

&quot;What does that have to do with River and I?&quot;

&quot;My last assignment was just over three years ago. It wasn't my place to ask
questions, I just followed orders. I was hired to negotiate... uh... deals if
you will.&quot;

&quot;No need to be coy at this point.&quot; Mal sipped his coffee.

&quot;All I knew was that there was a group of children that were specially selected
by this corporation. I had no more information than that. It was my job to make
sure the families of these children didn't ask questions.&quot;

When he didn't go on, Zoe prompted him.

&quot;How exactly did you do that?&quot;

&quot;Bribes mostly, lots of money, stature, safety. Whatever they needed. Sometimes
it took a little convincing. Occasionally threats.&quot; He swallowed. &quot;One family
was more problematic.&quot;

Simon looked down at the table and his voice was soft.

&quot;And my parents?&quot;

&quot;I never had cause to meet your parents, Simon, and that's the truth.&quot;

At least it was something. Simon felt himself relax just a little at these
words, despite the sympathetic expression on Book's face.

&quot;They didn't know?&quot; Of course he had never met them. They wouldn't have agreed
to any terms like that. They couldn't have. &quot;Of course they didn't.&quot;

&quot;They knew.&quot; River's voice came from the doorway. She stood there pale, one
hand holding on to the frame. &quot;They accepted the price readily.&quot;

&quot;River, no.&quot; He was trying to convince himself as well. &quot;Our parents are
already rich, they have everything, they know everyone who counts on Osiris,
what could anyone possibly offer...?&quot;

River looked at him sadly.

&quot;A career.&quot;

&quot;What? Father already had...&quot;

Then it dawned. He looked at the faces around him and felt the universe fall
out from under him. Simon had every confidence in his ability and talent as a
surgeon, but now he suddenly doubted the ease and speed of his appointments,
the seamless rise to the top.

It could affect his entire career, his mother had warned him when he started
asking about River. His father's words came back to him, oddly meaningful now.
Being a doctor means more to you than just a position, I know that.

&quot;No, River, they wouldn't...&quot; He couldn't accept it, couldn't wrap his head
around it. &quot;If they'd known...&quot;

&quot;They didn't even try, Simon.&quot; She walked into the room and sat down. They
watched her as she looked at the one empty chair that was left. &quot;They didn't
want to know.&quot;

&quot;Why are you on this ship?&quot; Inara's voice startled all of them, except perhaps
River. She'd been quiet during the whole revelation. &quot;It's no coincidence you
chose Serenity when they did, is it?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Book looked down. &quot;No, it's not.&quot;

&quot;You told me you were sworn to protect that Marshall and it didn't even
register until now.&quot;

&quot;Marshall?&quot; Jayne looked up. &quot;You mean that Fed that shot Kaylee?&quot;

&quot;Like I said, it was my last assignment. I retired and was spending my time at
the abbey. I thought... we all thought the job was finished.&quot;

&quot;Until I broke her out.&quot; Simon finished as his mouth gaped open in shock.
&quot;You're here to kill me.&quot;

&quot;Was, Son, was.&quot; He wasn't sure if the distinction would help any. With Simon,
or with Mal who was watching him with calculating eyes. &quot;You might have noticed
that I haven't yet.&quot;

***

Her hand pressed over the wall, smooth and white, fingers trying to feel for
any groove or divot that might explain it, might hide a hidden hatch. Kaylee
knew she had seen someone here, knew there was no exit other than the locked
door, knew he hadn't stood up to walk past her. She also knew he was no longer
there.

Nothing. She trembled and it wasn't because of the cold.

She ran a hand over the basin, her fingers hooking under the rim. There was a
space underneath it, a ledge of sorts. It took her all of a split second to
decide to hide the hair pin there.

The door opened behind her and she spun around.

&quot;I won't waste time.&quot; Her eyes fell to his hands first, noticed the whiteness
of them, before she looked up at his face and recognition flared. He looked
different, more at home and unspeakably more dangerous. &quot;You're a smart girl,
Kaylee, if that is your name this time, I believe we can come to an
understanding.&quot;

She couldn't stop the shaking. There was no way to get away from him and no one
to call for help, she was alone. Her heart sped up and she could feel it
pounding fast.

&quot;Stay away from me.&quot;

&quot;Now, now. You haven't let me finish.&quot; He clucked his tongue and shook his
head, already disappointed. &quot;I was going to explain to you how this whole thing
works.&quot;

Kaylee pressed her back up against the wall.

&quot;What do you want?&quot;

&quot;Me? I don't want anything.&quot; He laughed low in his throat and stepped forward.
&quot;Them? They want a lot of things, but let me tell you what they don't want.
They don't want to hurt you. They don't want you screaming or fighting or
making any kind of trouble for them. Do you understand?&quot;

She didn't respond.

&quot;Silence will be taken as express consent. Don't make any mistake, Kaylee, just
because they don't want to hurt you, doesn't mean they won't. They are not nice
people and they have no love for you. You are a means to their end. You bring
them an opportunity they've been waiting for. If you refuse to cooperate, then
there are other ways to help them. Other, less enviable, not so pleasant
ways.&quot;

The way he said it, so calmly, as if he were explaining the instructions on a
new prescription left her breathless. She wanted to break down and cry, to call
out for River or Mal or Jayne or anyone. She was alone, her traitorous brain
kept throwing the word at her, and she knew it.

&quot;It's time to go.&quot; He said and reached out to her.

&quot;No!&quot; She flinched from his touch and edged sideways. &quot;Get away from...&quot;

Anger flared in his eyes and he drew his arm up, bringing his elbow hard across
the right side of her face. She stumbled, dazed, a blank look on her face as
the blood began to pour from her nose and she slid down the wall.

&quot;I said it's time to go.&quot; Dr. Williams leaned down and hauled her up by her
armpits. &quot;And you'll do what I say.&quot;

***

As one, the six of them turned away from the screen. They did not need to see
through the wall. Their eyes followed the slow movement of the people behind
it. Step after step through the corridor. One set of feet dragged, sluggish
against the floor.

The monitors stopped spiking. The lines went flat.

Unnoticed, six pairs of hands bunched into fists, air hissed into lungs, eyes
bored through the wall, narrowing.

*He's already hurt her.*

As one, the six of them turned back to the screen. They sat with their backs
straight and faces forward, hands laid flat in front of them. The screen at the
front of the room flashed with images that burned into their brains. The only
muscles they moved were the ones attached to their ocular cavities.

The monitors began to spike in time with the images on the screen.

***

Wash stared out to the stars. They looked so different planet side and he
wished they were up in the black. He wanted nothing more than to be free of
this whole planet, everyone back on board, and nothing said about it. In fact,
what he really wanted was to go back about a week and slap Mal when he agreed
to the plan.

Hard.

Maybe even a punch. A big, manly punch. Something that knocked some sense into
that thick, stubborn skull of his. Wuh de mah, it had all gone wrong and, even
though nobody had been crass enough to say anything, Wash held more than a
little guilt. Enough to share, really.

*Wash? Help me!*

And he'd done nothing. Nothing as they'd manhandled her, nothing as she'd
fallen limp into their arms. Absolutely gorram nothing. Sat there like some
rutting back birth.

&quot;Not your fault.&quot;

Oh, sweet jesus. Could a man not wallow in private? Wash let his head drop,
chin to his chest, and breathed in before he looked up again. River didn't even
wait to be asked in, she stepped into the bridge and strode right to the
passenger chair.

&quot;Yeah, well, it certainly feels like it.&quot;

&quot;Not you. You weren't there.&quot; She looked at him solemnly. &quot;Hidden away from
their eyes.&quot;

&quot;Oh and have I thanked you for that, by the way?&quot; He picked up a little plastic
tree. &quot;That was very helpful. Thanks heaps.&quot;

&quot;Saved you.&quot; She pointed out and his hands stopped fidgeting for just a second.
&quot;They would have taken you, found us, people would have died. Serenity would
have died.&quot;

He heard the tremor in her voice and he looked up.

&quot;It's not your fault, either, you know.&quot;

She drew her legs up onto the chair and sat her chin on her knees.

&quot;She was so scared.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; He could still hear the growing edges in Kaylee's voice over the
whole day, her pleas for him to snap out of it.

&quot;And I can't feel her anymore.&quot;

Wash was too scared to ask what that meant. There were too many possibilities
and he didn't like any of them. He didn't want to think about any of them. He
wanted to flick his beloved switches, fire up the ship and just get out of
here.

&quot;We'll sit vigil, you and I.&quot; She rocked back and forth on the seat, ever so
slightly, as she looked out into the same mess of distant stars. &quot;The guilty
ones.&quot;

***

&quot;No!&quot;

They held her down by her shoulders, pressed her to the table as she tried to
free herself. Kaylee felt as if she were going to explode, her heart was
beating too fast and she couldn't stop fighting them. Hadn't stopped fighting
them as they'd made her change into a hospital gown. So many people in white
coats, faces covered with white medical masks, they surrounded her. Her eyes
flew from one to the other.

&quot;Lie still, please.&quot; One of them said.

She heard the peel of Velcro and felt her wrists being forced into restraints,
ankles too. Her head shook back and forth and her shoulders twisted in fear.
The side of her face was already swollen and aching. It added to her confusion.

Behind the looming figures in lab coats Kaylee saw him again. The strange man
with the brown hair and nice eyes. He nodded to her, but he didn't smile this
time. Immediately she stilled, let herself fall back on the table as her head
was also strapped in.

He stayed there, kept her eyes focused on him as they stuck needles into her
arms, ran hands over her limbs, pushed fingers gently into the muscles of her
abdomen, attached machines to the pulse points in her neck and ran scans over
her body.

She couldn't look away and found she didn't want to.

***

Basement detail. Piece of cake. All she had to do was sit there and nobody much
minded what she did during that time. Books were the easiest solution, she
could lose herself in another world and not have to think about what they were
paying her not to talk about.

Machines beeped an alarm at her.

Bored, she hit the requisite buttons and the tinny beeps stopped. All her
training, all those years, and this is what it came down to. She walked over to
the bed and quickly scanned the body lying there. He never moved, never
changed. Her job was simple and she changed the lines with ease, flicking away
an air bubble here and adjusting the flow rate there.

&quot;You poor, sorry idiot.&quot; She'd taken to talking to him as if he could hear her.
It got awfully lonely sometimes. &quot;You'd be better off if they just pulled the
plug. Pity you're so damned important to them.&quot;

She went back to her book.

***

*He walks down another hall and pulls her out of her sleep to join him. He
allows her a yawn in his throat, his body warms her quickly. She takes the
details in, white walls again.*

*River doesn't want to be here, not after last time. Yet she can't stay away,
not after last time. She thinks maybe he's going to take her back to Adam, so
both of them can hurt some more. Somebody has to.*

*In a way, she's right. He shows her the painfully small box. They both feel
his hand touch the metal, they both taste his tears.*

*There are other things to see, other secrets to be witness to and he wastes no
time in taking her to them. The room holds a bed. They look through the window
and she sees the woman staring up at the ceiling, her body distorted. River
feels the anger coil in her belly. He tries to soothe her, tries to stop the
rise of her emotions. It's harder to control when she's upset.*

*His eyes scan the screens and she takes in the data with a gasp. Problems
she'd helped solved are now being used against her. They're doing it again. She
knows they're doing it wrong. Again.*

*Landing strained it. Heated into itself. Didn't want to snap so it buckled.*

*She watches him type the commands on the key pads, watches the screen glow a
bright white, sees the information disappear into nothingness. It doesn't make
her feel better. The answers are gone, but the problem remains and they won't
stop.*

*River doesn't want to know what they'll do with the woman when they're
finished with her. When they blame her for their mistakes. She can't think
about it. It's too hard. Not even the hum of his thoughts, sliding over her
like a blanket, is enough to stop her shaking.*

***

Voices and footsteps invaded the silence. Wash looked up to see them all pour
into the bridge. His eyes flicked to the figure slumped in the passenger chair
and he motioned them to be quiet.

&quot;We're keeping vigil.&quot; He informed them.

&quot;No.&quot; Mal looked at River then back at Wash. &quot;You're keeping vigil.
Technically, she's sleeping vigil.&quot;

&quot;She's asleep?&quot; Simon walked up to the chair and stopped short of touching her,
checking to make sure she was okay. &quot;I don't think she's slept much during this
whole thing.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Wash continued. &quot;So don't wake her.&quot;

Zoe frowned as she crossed over to her husband. He still hadn't spoken to her
about it, not really, and even though he let her brush her hands through his
hair, submitted to all the little caresses she gave him, she knew there was
something wrong. She knew he felt worse than he let on and felt a sudden stab
of jealousy. It was obvious he'd spoken to River and she knew that River would
have seen a part of him that she never could.

&quot;Where are we headed?&quot; She asked.

&quot;That's it.&quot; Inara pointed as she and Book crowded the land layout. &quot;He goes
there every three days, takes the morning off terrorizing patients.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Book asked and his voice hinted that he'd prefer it a great
deal if she told him no.

Zoe came to look and hissed through her teeth.

&quot;Is that what I think it is?&quot;

&quot;What? What is it?&quot; Mal pushed his way into the group. &quot;Yeh soo, tah ma duh...&quot;

&quot;Alliance Military Express Port.&quot; Book confirmed flatly. &quot;With clearance into
that thing and access to their faster ships, that man could be back and forth
between here and anywhere in this galaxy within a matter of hours.&quot;

&quot;It doesn't matter.&quot; Inara insisted. &quot;He has to return tonight. He'll be in
transit between the base and the medical quarters. And that's our
opportunity.&quot;

She stared Mal down.

***

&quot;You were rude to me before.&quot;

Kaylee's eyes snapped open and she realized that she had begun to drowse,
having been left strapped to the table after the doctors had left. Well, all
except one. She could not move her head to look at the voice behind it and her
eyes scanned from left to right, straining to see him.

Or someone else that might be near.

&quot;I was only trying to help you.&quot;

She sucked air through her teeth and tried to jerk away when a warm cloth
touched the swell of her right cheek. Remembering the last time, she flinched
and waited. It was soft, his hand, when it finally came to her good left cheek
and held her head still.

&quot;That's better.&quot; He continued to wash her face and his thumb pressed into the
bone of her jaw. &quot;I offered you a choice before. Do you remember?&quot;

She nodded as best she could.

&quot;You hold the power here, Kaylee. Do as you're told and things will go nice and
easy. Make trouble and you'll get trouble. Are we agreed?&quot;

She nodded again. He put down the cloth and cupped her chin with both hands,
his head appeared upside down above hers.

&quot;I'm sorry? I couldn't hear you.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; She managed to say. &quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;How can I be sure you really mean it?&quot; He smoothed his hands down the sides of
her neck and over her shoulders. &quot;You've lied to me before, haven't you?&quot;

This time she stayed silent. A tear slid down from the corner of her eye into
the curve of her ear and sat there, cold and prickly.

&quot;I don't think you understand the consequences of your actions.&quot; He walked
around the table and she could finally see all of him. It didn't help her at
all, not with the way he was smiling down at her. &quot;What can I do to show you
how much you hurt people when you lie to them?&quot;

He ran one finger down the bare skin of her arm.

&quot;I mean, you lie and you lie. To me. To that poor man you've just stranded in
that place and left entirely at my mercy.&quot;

Kaylee stiffened and a strangled sound came from her throat.

&quot;That's it, isn't it?&quot; He gave a feral grin and leaned down close to her face.
&quot;You actually do care about him, don't you? Not enough to not put him at risk,
of course, but enough to know to stay quiet right now and be a very good
girl.&quot;

Laughter, low in his throat, as Kaylee felt him reach down and take her left
hand. He wound his fingers around her little finger and began to bend it back.

&quot;Look at you, look how terrified you are.&quot; She bit down hard. &quot;And so helpless.
It's a heady mix, it really is.&quot;

Kaylee heard the door open behind her head.

&quot;Get away from her, Williams.&quot;

She couldn't see the boy that had spoken, but by the sound of it he couldn't be
much older than River. Dr. Williams' reaction was instant, his eyes flared with
anger and his chest puffed up, but his hands sprang away from her and he took a
step back.

&quot;You forget who you're talking to.&quot; He tried to sneer.

&quot;She's not your toy.&quot; A girl this time, younger, Kaylee's eyes flew back and
forth, trying to see. &quot;Not this one.&quot;

&quot;We didn't bring her here for you.&quot; Two voices in unison. &quot;Neither did they.&quot;

&quot;You better go.&quot; Dr. Williams swallowed and his voice shook, but he kept
looking forward. &quot;If they find out you're here...&quot;

&quot;Worry about what they'll do if they find you here.&quot; Something edgy in the tone
of this one, a boy with a purposefully deep voice, as if he were trying to
sound older than he was. &quot;Now leave before we make you. And you know we
will.&quot;

Kaylee felt herself breathe again as Dr. Williams glared at her and then walked
away, she could see him shaking. She felt a sob rise in her throat and couldn't
control it.

&quot;Don't worry, Kaylee, you'll be safe now.&quot; This girl was much younger than the
rest of them, her voice softer, and the only one to address her specifically.
Kaylee really wanted to see her. &quot;You haven't been forgotten. Someone will be
back to take you to your room. Dr. Williams won't return today.&quot;

***

They sat side by side in identical postures, blue hands clasped on top of the
desk in front of them, faces unmoving and unreadable as they listened to the
little man sitting across from them.

&quot;I'm telling you, Dr. Williams is going to ruin everything. I've been telling
you for years!&quot;

&quot;Is he really?&quot; Said the one on the right.

&quot;Have you really?&quot; Said the one on the left.

&quot;Yes and yes.&quot; Came the exasperated voice. &quot;If he's tied to one more missing
girl...&quot;

&quot;We cleared him of all charges.&quot; Was the first reply.

&quot;We'll clear him of these. If there are any.&quot; Was the second.

&quot;That's not the point! He was just left alone with her... he's already come
close to breaking her nose and scarring her face.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; One eyebrow raised on the right.

&quot;And the children?&quot; Another raised, this time on the left.

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Just a hint of sarcasm ran into his voice. &quot;They play with
him like a cat with a mouse.&quot;

&quot;I take it there was no other... damage?&quot; The question came from the right.

He shook his head.

&quot;What about the results?&quot; From the left this time.

&quot;Oh, she's prime.&quot; He assured them. &quot;A little nutrient deficient, but that's
not uncommon for someone in constant space travel. A few boosters to flood her
system and she's our girl.&quot;

Inara stood by the door of the shuttle with Zoe, watching people walk past.
They could no longer see Book or Jayne. She was surprised at the amount of
traffic the place generated. Taking a breath, she prepared for her part in the
heist, unsure if she had the energy or stamina to pull off such a taxing role.

&quot;That one.&quot; She pointed. Done.

Zoe walked up to the man and gave a muffled curse as they knocked into each
other. The crowd gave them a cursory glance then left them alone to sort out
their petty squabbles. No one was going to get involved in a dispute right
outside of a military base.

&quot;Oh, sorry.&quot; Dr. Williams rushed to exclaim. &quot;I didn't mean...&quot;

His words trailed off as he felt the barrel of a gun pressing into his back,
just behind the kidneys. Two men had closed in behind him when he had been
distracted and they now held each of his arms still against his body.

&quot;You be quiet now, doc.&quot; Jayne growled low. &quot;And there won't be a problem.&quot;

He knew that shuttle, a cold slice of fear slid down his spine, and he damn
well knew the woman who held open the door for them.

***

She was taken into a room that held nothing but a chair. A memory flared in the
back of her brain and Kaylee could hear the Captain and Zoe telling a story
about being captured. Mal's voice echoed in her ears, telling them all that if
you're lead into a room with comfortable seats, it's them that's gonna want to
sit down, but if it looks uncomfortable as all hell, you better park yourself
down and shut up.

Kaylee looked at the stark wooden chair and didn't need to be told.

Her eyes scanned the room and all the white hurt her brain. Nothing but white,
the walls, the clothes people wore, the floors, everything. She longed for
color again.

The door opened with a loud crack and she gasped to see the two men walk in,
blue hands swinging at their sides. Behind them, faces blank, six children
filed in. They wore identical medical gowns, white like hers, and walked in
bare feet, their knobbly ankles lined up in a row. Their faces stared straight
ahead and did not look at her.

&quot;She's scared.&quot;

Ah, more geniuses. The thought came into her head before she could stop it and
Kaylee thought she saw the hint of a smile reach the face of the boy who had
spoken. He was blond and blue eyed, he wasn't as tall as the boy next to him,
but he looked stronger and there was an air about him that screamed danger, an
energy she likened to Jayne even though he looked about fifteen. She recognized
him as the one who had threatened the doctor.

On his right, taller and obviously older, stood a boy in his late teens who had
dark chocolate skin, with black hair and black eyes. He held his hands behind
his back and stood slightly forward and she took him to be the leader.

&quot;She's a jumble of fear and pain and anger. She's thinking about the man in the
hospital.&quot;

The girl who spoke had bright red hair and even brighter green eyes. She had to
be in her early teens, Kaylee thought, just old enough to have the long legged
coltish look of young girls. No, Kaylee thought, I'm not a toy.

It wasn't hard to figure out who the two voices speaking unison had belonged
to. An Asian boy and girl who could be nothing short of identical twins stood
together. They were small, with blue black hair and almond shaped eyes, and
each movement was made mirrored with the other.

&quot;She cries for her family.&quot; The youngest girl began. &quot;Her daddy said she had a
natural talent.&quot;

The child couldn't have reached her teens yet, Kaylee mused as she looked at
the piercing gray eyes and light brown hair that was streaked with shining
silver. She was pale and slight and easily the most striking of the six of
them. Something about that thought stuck in Kaylee's brain.

She thought about it, scrambled to figure out why it disturbed her. The elusive
sound of River's voice echoed around her head and Kaylee tried to remember
exactly what the girl had said. It hit her then, seven, River had said there
should be seven. She thought about the man who had sat in the room with her.

Six faces snapped a warning to her that she couldn't miss.

&quot;She's thinking about the farm back home.&quot; Said the tallest boy. &quot;She misses
her dog, her brothers and sister. Wants to be back with them.&quot;

Kaylee had been thinking no such thing, she had no dog and he'd gotten her
family all mixed up, and she knew they knew it.

&quot;What about River Tam?&quot; The first man asked, the tone of his voice suggesting
very little patience.

They hesitated a little too long.

&quot;Children?&quot; Said the second man. &quot;Take Alexandria to room four.&quot;

&quot;She knows River.&quot; The red haired girl rushed to say. &quot;Plays games with River.&quot;

Kaylee watched as the very youngest girl took a step back and the others
stepped around her, shielding her from the men.

&quot;River called her green.&quot; The twins broke in. &quot;Gave her a strawberry.&quot;

&quot;She knows River.&quot; The blond boy repeated. &quot;But she doesn't know about River.
She doesn't know why she's here.&quot;

&quot;I said take her to room four.&quot; They were not persuaded.

Slowly, the children walked out of the room and Kaylee was left with the two
men. They watched her carefully and any comfort or security she had just gotten
from the group began to melt away.

&quot;We know they're lying for you.&quot; Said the man on the right.

&quot;We will know why soon enough.&quot; Said the second man simply. &quot;They don't like
the young girl's cries.&quot;
