The idea that by saying a "sinner's prayer" asking for forgiveness
and by stating some words about accepting Jesus into one's heart is
all that is necessary for salvation is one of the biggest lies
perpetrated upon mankind. That there are church leaders teaching others
to believe this lie is one of the greatest examples of the blind
leading the blind. That there are thousands who believe such leaders is
proof that people have truly lost their God given common sense.

Jesus said "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter
into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father.
Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done
many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew
you: depart from me..." Matthew 7:21-23

The acid test of whether or not a person is right with God is whether
they hear the message Jesus spoke AND ACTUALLY LIVE IT.

Those that claim to be a saved Christian, and who continue to sin,
contradict the very bible they claim to embrace.

What exactly does scripture say about those who are saved? It actually
says that those who are saved no longer sin, that because God and Jesus
live within them, they can not sin.

Read it for yourself.

1 John 3

1 See what love the Father has bestowed on us that we may be called the
children of God. Yet so we are. The reason the world does not know us
is that it did not know him.

2 Beloved, we are God's children now; what we shall be has not yet been
revealed. We do know that when it is revealed 2 we shall be like him,
for we shall see him as he is.

3 Everyone who has this hope based on him makes himself pure, as he is
pure.

4 Everyone who commits sin commits lawlessness, for sin is lawlessness.
3

5 You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is
no sin.

6 No one who remains in him sins; no one who sins has seen him or known
him.

7 Children, let no one deceive you. The person who acts in
righteousness is righteous, just as he is righteous.

8 Whoever sins belongs to the devil, because the devil has sinned from
the beginning. Indeed, the Son of God was revealed to destroy the works
of the devil.

9 No one who is begotten by God commits sin, because God's seed remains
in him; he cannot sin because he is begotten by God.

10 In this way, the children of God and the children of the devil are
made plain; no one who fails to act in righteousness belongs to God,
nor anyone who does not love his brother.

I don't care what "God says". Why? Because those men that supposedly
wrote the book wrote it because they felt moved to do so in their
hearts and minds and were "lead by God". Who is to say that I, myself,
am not lead by God? Who is to say that my heart, and my mind are not
directly connected to God in the same way as these men. Wouldn't God
tell me the same things that he told them? Following my own heart, from
what's right and wrong to what it is I'm supposed to do with my life...
as long as I am open, aware, and even listen?! Should I follow a book
that teaches many things that make me feel uneasy and uncomfortable and
goes against the natural instincts of humanity?

What kind of God would create beings, and then demand them to be better
than he created, and hold them accountable for that? Thats like
demanding a cat to walk on two legs at all times, or asking a dog to
meow and a Cheeseburger to be a HotDog.

Prostelytizing -- no matter how much you believe your enternal soul is
on the line -- is likely to get you banned from here.

You might follow the words of Jesus, but what about Thor, Posiedon,
Zeus, or any of those other former favourite deities of mankind?
Wouldn't they be unhappy that you aren't living according to their
word?

Basically, you're going Hell.

Keep in mind that "Christians" believe that the Christian God is the
ONLY God and all other Gods, like the ones you named, are idols, false
gods, and employed by the devil. Yeah for brainwashing, huh?

I guess that means that NO ONE is saved then, huh?

All those "other" gods ARE the only God.   Merely, other men's conception of the Creator of the Universe.

That there is only One Creator of the Universe is axiomatic.  There can be only one Infinite.  How the Infinite is perceived, however, can very greatly from individual to individual.  Some only see the Infinite's finite qualities and deny the Infinite altogether.  Don't they, Ian?   ;)

EternityGrace said "Who is to say that I, myself, am not lead by God?
Who is to say that my heart, and my mind are not
directly connected to God in the same way as these men. Wouldn't God
tell me the same things that he told them?"

Me: That's exactly correct, you could very well be all these things.
But if you are, you will not be breaking the laws of right living. You
will not be a living contradiction within yourself. You will not longer
say, as Paul once said about His pre-saved life, "the good I want to
do, I do not do". You will be whole, complete and empowered to do ALL
the good things you know that you should do. You will love, not hate
your enemies. You will give your cloak as well, to those who compel you
to give your shirt. You will resent not evil, but overcome it with a
good and proper attitude. You will be still within and know what is
right to do each and every moment and do it.

Not sinning does not mean you have suddenly become perfect...you may
still spill milk and choose the wrong answer on your drivers license
test, or even misunderstand what another says to you, but you will not
be divided within yourself and go against your conscience because God
lives in your heart and gives you power and grace to avoid and overcome
ALL temptation, within and without, to do what you know to be wrong.
That is what Jesus, and men like Him do, they live what they know to be
right for each and every moment. All men such as these are living
examples of what we are all capable of, and how we all should be.
