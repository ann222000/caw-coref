I'm just curious; is this a predominently American issue? How do other
countries handle this? First of all I'm not 100% sure of how I feel
about homosexuality. And I'm proud of that. I do NOT like to judge
other people. But as to the fundamental right to happiness that each
United States citizen should possess, as long as his or her happiness
is not curtailing anyone (or anything) else's (and by that I am not
including someone's moral superiority) who has the right to say yes you
can or no you cannot? But, hey, I know that's idealistic.

hmm, this has been a hotly debated topic for some time now, my stand
on the issue is this: -
Note, I don't have anything personal against gays/lesbians etc - they
are human beings like anyone else on the planet - however, the concept
of being 'gay' or 'lesbian' is something I don't agree with as far as
I understand it - granted though, my understanding may be limited as
though I do know people who are of such orientation, I am only just
acquainted with them and have so far not heard much of the other side
of this arguement directly.
For a 'calm, rational analysis' - here's my take -

Firstly, the precepts on which I base this arguement: -
Marriage is a way by which two people (male and female, speaking in
this case) come together in union in the mental and spiritual sense,
as well as physical sense. (Personally, I think sex - as in, you kno -
is something that should only happen between individuals if they are
already married - or if marriage is inevitable in the very near
future).
The purpose of marriage - speaking in terms of the physical aspect
only of it - is reproduction.

A gay or lesbian union will not be allow for reproduction - theres
the oh-so-obvious biological fact - a - ahem - is not made for another
- ahem.

Now, leaving that 'logic' aside - one may argue and say &quot;Love is more
than just a physical union. And a man/woman may love another man/woman
(respectively)&quot; - I agree with both those statements - However, where
the 'Love' between men is concerned, it should properly be brotherly
love and between females it should be sisterly - and if two guys or
two women wish to live together in one household their families may
live together just fine or even if, say, two women decided they didn't
want to marry but wanted to raise kids, they can adopt kids and raise
them.
A gay or lesbian union is merely so for the purpose of sex, and sex
between people of the same sex is unnatural and I personally don't
agree that it is alright.
Not to say that we should all go on a spree and start burning the gays
and lesbians on the stake lol - I'm not against them, they are people
after all - I've also heard from some that people of such sexual
orientation usually have a form of mental impairment and some have
been 'cured' after counselling - now, I don't know about the mental
impairment arguement but this is what I know about this issue so far.
I'm open to hear other views and though personally at this stage,
there is no 'calm, rational' debate that I see which supports the fact
that these people are doing the right thing. However, as far as
equality goes, and tolerence, I think we need to treal all people
equally and justly - and tolerence is a result of understanding - I am
not intolerent to gays etc. they shouldn't be treated badly or
stripped of any rights (except marriage which we're discussing here).
Again, this is how I see it so far - thoughts?

How things are in reality, and how a government runs are two different
things. Even if it is &quot;wrong&quot; for two individuals of the same sex to
get married, it doesn't follow that it should be banned by our
government. The government is forced by the laws it enacts to be
consistent. But how far does this go? Chris you struck down the
argument that legalizing gay marriage would then open the door for
beastialites, pedofilia, etc. But what about polygamy. Over a hundred
years ago, the government banned polygamy in the United States of
America because the Mormons in Utah were practicing it, and were
petitioning for Statehood. The government banned polygamy, and would
not allow Utah (then Deseret) to become a state. Not only did they not
want Utah to become a state, they also sent &quot;Johnsons Army&quot; to occupy
Utah, and enforce its will upon Utah. Finally the Mormons officially
rejected their practice of polygamy because of the danger it brought to
them as a people. Now if your saying that gays should be granted the
right marriage, then is what the government did to the Mormons a
hundred years ago wrong? And if it is, then should they now legalize
it? I think that if they are going to legalize gay marriage, then they
must also, by reason, legalize polygamy. Now if you know modern
Mormonism you will know that they will not pick up this practice again,
at least in it's present state, it is much too mainstream for that.
But there are splinter groups of the church that have broken off in
Utah and started polygamous groups in Utah and Colorado. I always grew
up thinking these people were freaks, but last summer I attended a
conference where a group of these people were present. They were
extremely smart, and well cultured, I was surprised. They were in
charge of a session of a conference where they defended polygamous
marriage. They gave statistics of their educational levels, absence of
civil disobedience, success of the family etc. etc. I'll have to tell
ya, they were above and beyond what any group of people in the united
states could hope for. So what do you think? Should polygamy be
legalized right along with gay marriage?

I have also heard many rational discussions on the right to polygamy.
And once again, I feel that to impose a moral restriction on one's
choice of lifestyle goes against what we stand for in our country.
However, there are cases in this practice, I have heard, where
underaged girls were &quot;chosen&quot; to be wed before they were of a legal age
to understand the full consequences of their decision. (I know age is
relative, some mature faster than others) I don't know if this is why
the law first came about, I would doubt it. Once again, my personal
belief on this matter depends on whether the &quot;right&quot; is interfering
with someone else's &quot;rights&quot; - whether one's choice might cause another
harm. In this case, if the young ones could be guaranteed protection,
then the choice should remain between concenting parties. But once
again, I am an idealist.

Gay marrige, gay people and polygamy yeah now here's a tread :)

First off Chris, exactly I can see no, absolutely no reason why gay
marriage should not be leagl.

Being gay is not a choice Renrath, it is a physical differance. I
cannot be Gay, no more than a Gay man/woman can be straight. As for
the whole gay relationships are only for sex, phtahh, rubbish. By your
own addmission you hardly know any gay people, so I guess I can see why
you would say this.

If two people fall in love, there is a very big chance that they can't
help this feeling. This is no differant wether you are a man who loves
men, or a woman who loves women. A loving relationship is not ever
just about sex.
Nor is samesex sex unatural. It has been going on for far more years
than either of us has been alive.

If gay people are that way because of nature(read God) then neither is
gay sexual practice unatural.

Polygamy, I recently have been having a fine time with this re Sikhi,
it seems a sound idea, and I can see the merits of it. Heh whether it
is my bag or not, well ask the wife, I'll leave that one up to her :)

Cheers,

Lee.

Although we might call a union between two gay people a marriage, that
infers *orthodox* religious connotations; which I think, in reality,
is mostly inaccurate.

Living in Brighton (the city with highest gay, lesbian, and
transsexual population in Europe) and having a girlfriend with two gay
brothers, I can honestly say I do know quite a lot of homosexuals.
Although these people may want to be married, and deemed in society's
eyes as a properly joined couple, they, in no case that I know of,
want to subscribe to the complete orthodox values of a mainstream
religion. Although they might wish to recognise God in their vows and
ceremony, they obviously find themselves persecuted, or at least
alienated by, most religious doctrines. Basically, by most notions of
religious doctrine they are sinners.

What I'm saying is that they aren't likely to want to be married in
your local Mormon temple or Mosque according to orthodox religious
doctrine. I guess, then, that they wish to lead their lives as they
see fit and would want you to enjoy the same right.

Gay marriage, as a civil union, will be legal in the UK within this
term of government or the next. It's already legal elsewhere in
Europe.

This is sadly another issue where religion tries to impose an absolute
value upon an democracy, which, by nature and definition, is a vague
thing made up of heterogeneous values. It doesn't work. If it went the
other way and homosexuals started to drum up campaigns suppressing
religious freedoms, things might start to make sense for your average
Christian or Muslim. The fact is that all faiths are merely tolerated
by society (which is a far better position than the hand history has
sometimes dealt them) and it is a shame that this tolerance cannot be
extended to other beliefs and values systems.

Frankly the argument against gay marriage is a non-starter.
Christians, for example, find that their argument rather is amusingly
caged by their own doctrine: i.e. they should be more concerned about
the well-being of their own souls and, of course, accept that it is
not within their rights to pass judgement upon others since only God's
judgement is &quot;true and righteous&quot;.

Quite right Ian, although I do not think that many people still see
marriage as solely a persuit for the religious. Indeed my wife is a
commited atheist, so our marrige had no religious sicnificanes at all.

So my question is, marrige for God or for Love?

Excellent points all. Ren, while I understand your perception of what
love between men and love between women should be, the opinions, and
even hard beliefs, of an invidual cannot be used to restrict the civil
rights of another individual. This issue is identical to the bans on
interracial marriage in the past. At that time, they considered it
&quot;unnatural&quot; and &quot;improper&quot;; in reality it was neither.

The libertarian in me wonders why the governement even has a device
&quot;marriage.&quot; The only reason possible is to encourage mating for life for the
purposes of reproduction. When we are well outside of that box (marrying
your gay partner, your dog, your grandmother, whatever), why not just
abolish the civic idea of marriage and make it a strictly religious issue?

Hello everyone,
See, as to what interracial marriage goes, and initially though it did
seem 'unnatural' - of course that was not the case - we can obviously
see that it was natural from the fact that biologically it is possible
for reproduction and also since though the 'race' of the two people
was different, they were human and as far as 'race' goes, I think that
the lack of logic and reason in the anti-interracial marriage debate
obviously caused inter-racial marriages to gain the recognition they
have.
However, Lee, since you said:
(Lee)
Being gay is not a choice Renrath, it is a physical differance. I
cannot be Gay, no more than a Gay man/woman can be straight. As for
the whole gay relationships are only for sex, phtahh, rubbish.

- Fair call lee, however, what is this 'physical difference' - like,
I've asked my uncle in Malaysia who is a doctor what differences a gay
person would have to a normal one and he said he didn't know of any
physical difference except for that they have a, as he said, 'strange
sexual inclination' - please do tell me what this difference is and
what is a gay person? not merely as the common definition goes: a
person who would marry another of the same sex - but like for the
inter-racial debate, which is now log forgotten, to say that it is
totally fine for people of different races to marry can be reasoned by
what I said earlier, thay race is firstly a form of distinction
between people of different backgrounds in terms of place of birth etc
but in no way do they have any physiological differences which say
that they could not have a proper marriage and also, besides people of
different 'races' are basically just people of either different belief
systems - which may be quite similar to others or not so similar to
some - or people with different skin colour but as we all now know -
skin colour is only a skin colour difference and we're of the same
species anyway - so the 'rationale' behind anti-interracial marriage
does not hold its ground there. However, I don't see any sound ground
on which the pro-gay debate is held except for the fact that people
seem to support it more so because they want the government's imposive
authority on people's rights to marriage to either loosen or let it be
left religious, then again, if as you said since your marriage, Lee,
was something that was purely secular, your wife being atheist, maybe
then the government needs to reconsider how 'liberal' it is. Still
though, if you know something I don't about what gay people are then
I'd like to know for my own understanding - because I though am not
anti-gay - I'm not pro-gay marriage either because I don't totally
know, considering theres more to know, about what the real difference
it is between a gay and straight person besides sexual inclination -
kindly clarify.

Renath, you seem to want to understand what being &quot;gay&quot; or what
homosexuality in general is - the substantial &quot;it&quot; that makes one
different. Do you feel that it's just a 'decision' on a subconscious
level that one makes to be different? First of all, though I don't
necessarily believe in &quot;soul-mates&quot; I do believe that there are people
we are supposed to meet in our lives that will allow us - say, open the
door - for the things we need in our lives to grow. Some relationships
are very profound, and they can be with someone you spend the greater
part of your life with. However change can also be made with somebody
you momentarily met.....it just depends on what kind of impact that
person had on your life. Some of us will walk away from this forum and
it will just be a brief period of entertainment. Some of us will carry
something significant the rest of our lives because of one of the
topics. (For instance, if Pottsie had not made an off-hand remark
about about courage one day, I would have chickened out of something
that might prove a life-changing event for me. Good or bad? Only time
will tell. :D And he probably didn't have a clue what sort of impact
it had on me [but I had to let him know :) ] ) Anyway, back to my
point. The people we fall in love with, I believe, are there to
present us with an opportunity to resolve something in our growth
toward &quot;God&quot;&quot;Perfection&quot; etc. I feel that in regard to
homosexuality, in the Greater Scheme of things, what you get is what
you need. Does this mean I am pro-homosexuality? Not necessarily.
Perhaps the opportunity here is to discipline one's self. I don't know
- I won't judge. But love is love. Usually you can't choose who is
going to burrow under your skin.

Well, we got an assignment for English - to read multiple texts and
see how that changes our perceptions or supports our perceptions on
certain issues - now, though I'm moving to Perth this weekend and
won't have to hand this assignment in - I still went ahed and decided
to do something on my perceptions of homosexuality - so some of my
research led me to some sites posted below...
(You would need abode pdf to read this): -
http://www.ias.ac.in/jgenet/Vol83No3/251.pdf
Now, from this article and research this guy has done, firstly his
fact-collection methods are a bit - dodgy, however, it does state
strongly that there is no consensus clinically as to what is the cause
of homosexual behaviour - on one other site, however, though the
ethics of what was done by these clinical experts and psychologists
can be debated, what they've found is basically that it is just a
mental orientation and an anomaly, or as they call it in this article,
disorder -  http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/bmj;328/7437/429
- you may need to scroll a bit down to read the article... Now, I
however think that calling it an entire 'disorder' is not the right
term, coming from psychologists as well, because a disorder is some
condition of a person's mental or otherwise which makes them a danger
to themselves and/or others - now, a gay person is not necessarily a
'danger' to anyone so I won't say that they have a 'disorder' per se,
in that clinical sense - but if disorder is what it sounds like - the
negation of 'order' , from the viewpoint of 'order' as 'normal' in the
sense I'm speaking, then I guess in a way it probably is.
Anyway, what I'm finding out has more so just shown me that there is
no reason for a person being gay, and that since it is a reversable
condition, I think that insted of discriminating them, homosexuals
just need to be helped - when asked for, and it should not be imposed
upon.
Though, I still hold that being discriminatory towards them, and not
giving them rights - is oppressive and unethical, I would not
personally support the making of gay marriage legal either... however,
as far as rights go, making it illegal for a gay union is 'stepping
on' their rights as individuals because if a heterosexual is entitled
to union with a partner of their choice, a homosexual should (speaking
if homosexuality is a legitimate phenomena) - however, from what I
see, I think that they just need counselling or some supportive,
positive help to allow them to become normal.
Still open to opinions as always though, this is just how I see it thus far,
Sat Sri Akal!

Hey Ren, folx :)

Let me try to clarify the 'differances' that I speak of between a gay
man and a 'hetro' man.

These differances are in the way in which the brain works. I have
talked before of mindsets, what I mean by this is if you belong to a
certian mindset then it is very hard, if not impossible for you to
agree with things from a differant mindset. Lets just take music as an
example.

I like heavy metal music, always have always will. Now I know some
people that do not. This is fine, not likeing the same music as me
does not make you wrong or unnatural. It just means that you do not
feel what I feel when I listen to heavy metal. It may be instead that
you get the same sort of feelings from another type of music.

What about violence? Some belong to that mindset. For a peace loveing
man it is very hard just to understand the thought processes of a
violent man. Violence makes no sense to me at all. However I realise
that to some it does. Now who's right and whos wrong? None of the
above, it's just that my mind works in a way that the violent man's
does not, a differant mind set. I can not help this, nor can the
violent man help himself.

Some people will never belive in God, not because they don't want to,
but because they cannot, their brains are not built that way.

This is the differance, you have no choice to be gay or not, it is not
a lifestyle choice it is something that you are born to be, you cannot
control it nor can you not be gay if born that way.

Now wether this is beacuse of a genetic differance, or a differance in
the brain itself I don't know.

Heh and as for normality, I think that is a very dangerous road to
tread. Hands up who knows what normal it? What are the normal working
parameters of the human body and brain? Who do we trust to tell us
what is normal or not. What if the people that let us know what is
normal then want to do something about the non normals. Hitlers
eurgenics ring a bell?

Renath, remember you don't want to belive all that you read(except this
now! heh) being gay is not something you have control over, there is no
going backward to become 'normal'. Not only is this type of thinking
wrong, but dangerous. Go on, walk up to any gay man and ask him, if he
feels normaol or not.

Any how I've witterd on enough for now.

Cheers,

Lee.

Regarding the issue of what is homosexuality, or why are they that way
to begin with, WebMD offers this:

http://my.webmd.com/content/article/46/2953_531.htm

The amount of pre-natal androgen may be one of the factors which
decides sexual orientation:

http://my.webmd.com/content/article/22/1728_56075.htm

and a smaller dimorphic nucleus in the preoptic hypothalamus:

http://my.webmd.com/content/article/53/61397.htm

The American Psychiatric Association found no evidence whatsoever in
its exhaustive study in 1973 to support the belief that Homosexuality
is a treatable pathology. It was then that they removed it from their
list of &quot;mental illnesses&quot;.

http://my.webmd.com/content/article/24/1728_57704.htm

I know you can find websites all over the internet which will support
any belief you choose to make, so I stuck with references from WebMD,
as I am very familiar with their clinical data vetting process.

The fact is, there are different biological makeups, albeit subtle
ones, to homosexuals. They are minor differences, but consistent across
all races within our species, and they clearly have a profound effect
on a person's life, loves, and attractions.

For those who think this is just a choice, still, let me ask you this:
Can you change what you think is attractive? If I brought you the
ugliest man or woman you have ever seen, and said &quot;it is proper for you
to be attracted to this man or woman, so forget that other kind you
normally go for&quot;, do you think you could change? Look around you today
as you go through your life, find that person you find repugnant, or
even just unattractive, and try to force yourself to be attracted to
them. I'd be interested in hearing some of your results.

Attraction, which is the baby step foundation of love, is innate. We
can't explain why we prefer blondes, or brunettes, or redheads,
rubinesque (mmm...) or petite; some women prefer skinny pretty boys,
and some like large men with facial hair and rough hands. What defines
that? Some of it is environmental, sure, and some of it is innate, in
one way or another. No matter the finite detail explaining that
attraction, it is only homosexual attraction (currently) which people
attempt to change, or consider wrong. Your statement that counselling
or supportive, positive help to allow them to become normal assumes
they are not. This is a fallacious assumption. With between 10-15
million exclusively homosexual individuals in the united states, living
their lives as productive members of our society, I would say they are
as normal as any other minority.
