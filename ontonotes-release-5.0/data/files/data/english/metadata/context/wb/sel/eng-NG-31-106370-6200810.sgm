That is the best estimate so far using data from
http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_10_06.html
October 2006
( worth reading in its entirety, an ex-Brit I think)

Previous disclosure of the Arizona data contained
"another few who match at 10 loci"
has now been enlarged on to
"approximately 1 in every 1,489 profiles matched at 10 loci"
for 65,493 samples , which equates to 22 pairs in 65,493.

The database structure used in the UK is 10 loci.
The Arizona data was for any 10 loci in the 13 of
the USA codis system. The number of permutations
of 10 from 13 is
13! / ( 10! * 3! ) = 286

There is a square law of match probabilities
so that the minimum number before a match is
more likely than not is
65493 * SQRT(286/22) &lt;&gt; 236,000
not 65493 * (286/22)

From my first simulations and calculation using
all the published
allele frequencies and assuming "parthenogenic "
profiles, that is absolutely no co-ancestry, then the
minimum 10 loci database size for 1 pair match would
be of order 830,000 or 14 in the current UK NDNA
database size of  3.2 million (square law again)
There is no getting away from that number.
The question is how much larger a figure it
is due to factoring in that everyone is related
to someone else, to some extent , co-ancestry.

Bearing in mind the UK and USA profiling systems
use incompatible areas of DNA, all the loci used
are broadly similar as far as the miulti-value
nature is concerned, ie the discriminating function.

From the Arizona data
1 in 236,000 becomes (3.2/0.236)^2 = 184 pairs
in a 3.2 million 10 loci database.

If the corrupt keepers of these databases disclosed
the actual figures all this would not be necessary

To give the lie to all that corrupt crap presented
in courts about probabilities in the trillions and bigger.
There is something of the order of 184 chances in
3.2 million for false matches. So 1 in 3.2 * 10^6/ 184
chance of an unrelated false match with someone else
of 1 in 20,000 , let alone half the
whole population (men or women).
That is for every 20,000 crime scene DNA profiles
determined and a match found to someone's
DNA profile on the NDNAD (criminal or non-criminal)
then 1 is likely to be a false match.

I would posit that the population of the UK
has more co-ancestry than Arizona but I have no
figures . If anyone has any input on
that factor or similar please put any leads/ here.
But due to that reason the figure could be higher.

Just in case anyone's interested
For half (no amelogenin, sex marker) of the UK population
of 30 million and square law fashion.
1 in 236,000 becomes 16,200 in 30 million or
1 in 185 chance of an unrelated false match with
someone else in the whole population.

Square law derivation etc and
what they aren't telling you about DNA profiles
and what Special Branch don't want you to know.

No it doesn't decimal point in wrong place
1 in 1850 chance of a false match in 30 million
