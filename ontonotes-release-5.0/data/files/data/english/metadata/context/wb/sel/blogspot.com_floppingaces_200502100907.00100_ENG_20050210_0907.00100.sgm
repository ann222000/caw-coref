<P>You can check out my earlier post here . During the outcry from the
scum of the neighborhood at least a few groups are putting forth some
common sense. The Law Enforcement Alliance of America (LEAA) today
defended members of the LAPD who have come under attack for their role
in a shooting involving a juvenile car thief. The suspect allegedly led
police on a high- speed chase in a stolen car at 4 a.m. through the
streets of Los Angeles. After crashing the stolen car, the suspect
rammed into a police cruiser and officers fired at the driver of the
stolen car, killing him. LEAA Spokesperson Ted Deeds called the actions
of the LAPD officers self-defense saying, "the question is not why these
officers used deadly force on a criminal who turned out to be a
juvenile, but what was this juvenile doing allegedly stealing cars at
four a.m., leading police on a high speed chase and then attempting to
use the stolen car as a weapon by ramming the police cruiser?" The facts
are that officers in this brief and violent chase instigated by the
juvenile car thief had no way of knowing the age of the criminal they
were pursuing. Deeds added that the violent act of using a vehicle as a
weapon to ram a police car during a pursuit makes the use of deadly
force a clear act of self-defense. "This young man is dead because of
the choices he made and the actions he took; he was allegedly out
stealing cars at four a.m., leading police on a dangerous chase and then
attempting to injure or kill police officers as he rammed their patrol
car -- his age, race and being a good student have nothing to do with
it." said Deeds. Plus the LAPD Chief had a press conference (surprise
surprise, since he is just a big showboating politican anyway) that
detailed the shooting. Below is the timeline of the chase.</P>
