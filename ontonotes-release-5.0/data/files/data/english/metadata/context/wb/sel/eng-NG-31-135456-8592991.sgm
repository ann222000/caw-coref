I have been trying to find something that will help me to set up just enough
DECnet to allow me to download the software to a DECserver, and connect
together a small number of VAXstations I have at home (I am already
networking with TCP/IP, but DECnet would be fun to play with too). There is
a huge amount of documentation which would take me some time to work through
and understand.

Is there a resource somewhere that would allow me to get started a bit more
quickly for the sake of domestic harmony? I am thinking along the lines of
Phil Wherry's page for installing VMS.

I tried setting it up and got as far as choosing a local namespace (seems
simple), but the next question about the location of the file stumped me
somewhat.

Thanks

Rob

Do yourself a favour and get the &quot;real&quot; decnet (decnet 4). It is MUCH
easier to install, configure and maintain and you won't have to fight
the osftware to find a way to elininate annoying OPCOM messages. Decnet
4 also takes a MUCH smaller footprint on your system disk and in memory.

It should be part of the VMS distribution CD.

I assume that you're running NET$CONFIGURE.COM.  What, exactly, was

The DECnet protocol is not use for DECserver downloads, so you can
just skip all that.  MOM/MOP is used for DECserver downloads.  Older
versions of MOM/MOP were managed through NCP, like DECnet Phase IV,
which often leads to this confusion.

Current versions of VMS provide LANCP for managing MOM/MOP, or if you
use DECnet Phase IV you can still use NCP.

If you're setting up a local namespace then you're using DECnet Phase V
management tools which won't help you with MOM/MOP.

If you are running some older VAXstations with limited memory, I tend to
suggest to run DECnet Phase IV instead of DECnet-Plus. And if your wish
is to just do the basic tasks with DECnet, it will be enough. But if you
want to do something advanced like running DECnet-over-IP or run a
DECdns server etc, then you need to install DECnet-Plus.

The net$configure procedure provides you with good default values for
different parameters and you can safely use them. I think most users
don't alter the parameters unless there is a really important reason.

Personally I like DECnet-Plus because of its support for very detailed
management of all the layers of the protocol stack. Of course it takes
time to learn it, but when you know it, you have a very thorough view of
what is happening in the stack and the configurability is really
comprehensive.

OK, so I switched to IV, but it looks like I don't know how to specify
decnet addresses because this is how I responded to the NETCONFIG.COM:

$ @netconfig.com

DECnet for OpenVMS network configuration procedure

This procedure will help you define the parameters needed to get DECnet
running on this machine.  You will be shown the changes before they are
executed, in case you wish to perform them manually.

What do you want your DECnet node name to be?           [VLC]: VLC1
What do you want your DECnet address to be?                  : 1.1
Do you want to operate as a router?         [NO (nonrouting)]:
Do you want a default DECnet account?                    [NO]:
Do you want a default account for the MAIL object?      [YES]:
Do you want a default account for the FAL object?        [NO]:

Do you want a default account for the NML object?       [YES]:
Do you want a default account for the MIRROR object?    [YES]:
Do you want a default account for the VPM object?       [YES]:

When I installed the DVNETEND license and rebooted, this is what
STARTNET.COM gave me:

$ @STARTNET
%RUN-S-PROC_ID, identification of created process is 0000008F
%NCP-W-INVPVA, Invalid parameter value , Physical address

DECnet IV expects to set the physical address of the network
interface according to the SCSSYSTEMID, and it can do this only if it's
the first network protocol to grab the device.  Thus, DECnet IV must be
started before the IP stuff.  The system start-up stuff tends to do it
right, but if you do it manually, you need to inhibit the IP (and/or
Appletalk, and/or so on) stuff until you get DECnet (IV) going.
DECnet-Plus (V) doesn't care.

Post the output of SHOW DEVICE E and maybe we can figure out where NETCONFIG
made an invalid assumption. (ESA0: doesn't sound right for a VLC - I'd have
expected EWA0: and EWA-0, but it's been a while).

Well, as other posters have noted, there actually is no connection between MOP
and DECNet other than that the Phase-IV executor facilitates MOP functions and
the Phase-IV NCP program is used to configure the necessary database entries.

Current VMS versions provide LANCP and LANACP which handle MOP stuff without
DECnet Phase-IV.

MOP and DECnet are different protocols (packet types). Within MOP, there are
actually four packet types:

- Downline load
- Upline dump
- Remote Console
- (I forget the fourth)

If you just want MOP loading control, SET HOST and file copy etc, then
you need local namespace.
The name for this namespace will be LOCAL:.nodename

If you ask for a domain name service then it will also ask for the
fully qualified node name for an IP-centric view of the world.

I suggest you don't want to use DECdns as I've yet to find anyone who
DOES use it!

If this covers the &quot;next question&quot; then that's great.  If not, what is
the next quesiton please?

Indeed I now see that I do not need DECnet for downloading firmware to a
DECserver, I was misled slightly by the Hoffman Labs page which mentions
DECnet, but then says it is not actually used. Still it is nice to get
DECnet going and I succeeded with phase IV when I started TCP/IP afterwards
(thanks to other posters for this advice).

Is there somewhere that summarises DECnet Phase IV addressing and also
explains its relationship to SCSSYSTEMID (I am sure I saw somewhere that
they are related)?

I'm not sure that there is a requirement (in the back of my mind there
is something that says there is, but that doesn't help) but it's
certainly traditional that the SCSSYSTEMID is the same as the DECnet
phase IV address.

The DECnet phase IV address is made up of a DECnet area and a node
number within that area:
area.number

So, for a node 36.101 it's node 101 in DECnet area 36.  There are up
to 1023 nodes in an area.
the SCSSYSTEMID is a number which is made up as:
(area*1024)+number

So, for the 36.101 it's (36*1024)+101 = 36965

You can actually put the calculation as above in the MODPARAMS.DAT for
setting the SCSSYSTEMID:
SCSSYSTEMID=(36*1024)+101

DECnet phase IV isn't MOP, but includes control of the MOP service for
downline loading.  Similarly, it isn't command console protocol but it
can be used to control it.

If you set SCSSYSTEMID and start DECnet Phase IV they must contain
the same bits.

cluster_config.com will look at your DECnet address and I think
netcongif.com will look at your SCSSYSTEMID to try to make them so.

If you're doing it by hand the relationship is (area.node being the DECnet
address):

scssystemid = (area * 1024) + node

Both of these will cause the NIC's physical address to become
AA-00-04-00-xx-yy where scssystemid in hex is yyxx.  Some protocols
can't deal with the physical address changing after they've started
which is why DECnet Phase IV won't start if other protocols are
already using the hardware address as the physical address.

I think that's a bit stronger statement than reality.  The only
thing DECnet Phase IV and MOP have in common is using NCP and the
NCP database as management tools.  I can see why you might use
&quot;control&quot; in that context, but the DECnet stack does not control
the MOP stack.

&gt;&gt; expected EWA0: and EWA-0, but it's been a while).

&gt;   I don't think he's seeing a NETCONFIG.COM bug, I think the poster was
&gt;   right about this being an issue with having some other protocol
&gt;   started prior to DECnet Phase IV trying to change the physical
&gt;   address.

&gt;   None of which is doing him any good since he needs MOP, not DECnet.
">

I thought I replied to this but I cannot see the reply several hours later,
so apologies if this is duplicate:

I now realise that I don't need DECnet for downloading firmware to a
DECserver (I was led astray by the Hoffman article which mentions DECnet and
then says it is not actually used). Still it was fun to get it working.

Is there a relationship between DECnet addresses and SCSSYSTEMID? If so what
is it? Is there a simple explanation somewhere of Phase IV addresses?

Thanks

I don't know where the code which is now in LANACP existed before,
it might actually have been stuck in the NETACP, but it's not really

There is nothing terribly complicated about DECnet Phase IV addresses.
They consist of an &quot;Area&quot; from 1-63 (or 64?? I'm too lazy to look it
up!) and a &quot;Node&quot; number from 1-??.  Most organizations don't have
DECnet networks large enough to tax this addressing scheme; Digital was

MOP DL requests are sent to a multicast address, which nodes with MOP

Nop.

At the VMS level, in an environment without LANCP database, which process:

1- Tells the ethernet driver to forward received MOP protocol requests
to whatever will handle them ?

2- When a MOP request comes in, is a new process created, or ir there an
existing process which does it ? (and if so, which process).

With LANCP, it is obvious that LANACP is probably the one registering
itself to the ethernet driver as the handler of packets with the MOP
protocol bytes.  But without LANCP, it has never been obvious to me
which one it would have been (if it wasn't DECNET).

When you configure DECNET, it will suggest the right etwork address if
SCSSYSTEMID is already set. I suspect it will warn you or perhaps not
allow you to make a mistake.

If you subsequently reset SCSYSTEMID to something else, I suspect DECNET
will fail to start.

At least some DECservers can boot using either MOP or BOOTP (TCP/IP
protocol).  It attempts to boot using whatever was successful the last
time.  If you have, as I once did, something that will answer a BOOTP
request, and a MOP boot fails, you can get a situation where the
DECserver switches over to BOOTP.  The way out is to connect it to a VMS
system with a crossover cable making sure that VMS cannot respond to a
BOOTP request.  When BOOTP fails it will try MOP which succeeds and
resets things.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Is there a relationship between DECnet addresses and SCSSYSTEMID? If so
&gt;&gt;&gt;what is it? Is there a simple explanation somewhere of Phase IV
&gt;&gt;&gt;addresses?

&gt;&gt;SCSSYSTEMID:==AREA*1024+NODE
&gt;&gt;e.g. if your DECnet address 2.7 your SCSYSTEMID= 2*1024+7=2055

&gt;&gt;There is nothing terribly complicated about DECnet Phase IV addresses.
&gt;&gt;They consist of an &quot;Area&quot; from 1-63 (or 64?? I'm too lazy to look it up!)
&gt;&gt;and a &quot;Node&quot; number from 1-??.  Most organizations don't have DECnet
&gt;&gt;networks large enough to tax this addressing scheme; Digital was one of
&gt;&gt;the few organizations larger enough to have a problem.  NASA was another.
&gt;&gt;Most of the world now uses TCP/IP which has become the de facto  standard.

&gt; So what happens if I use an SCSSYSTEMID of 1025 and then I set a DECnet
&gt; address of 1.2 (say)?
">

I couldn't say, I never tried it!  You really have to work at it to
screw it up.  If you use the configuration (.COM) files provided, that
stuff all gets set up for you when you configure DECnet.

FWIW, the 1-?? in my original response should be something like 1-1023
or 1-1024.  (I'm still too lazy to look it up!)

&gt; At least some DECservers can boot using either MOP or BOOTP (TCP/IP
&gt; protocol).  It attempts to boot using whatever was successful the last
&gt; time.  If you have, as I once did, something that will answer a BOOTP
&gt; request, and a MOP boot fails, you can get a situation where the
&gt; DECserver switches over to BOOTP.  The way out is to connect it to a VMS
&gt; system with a crossover cable making sure that VMS cannot respond to a
&gt; BOOTP request.  When BOOTP fails it will try MOP which succeeds and
&gt; resets things.
">

There is a bit of magic that will cause a DECServer to reset to its
factory default configuration.  The exact sequence varies with model,
but for some, I think you hold down the reset button while it's
powering up.

Does your DECServer have a 7-segment LED display?  If so, what is it
doing?  (IIRC, for most models, it counts down from about 8 to about
3 while it selftests, and then waits for a download.)

Do you have a terminal or emulator you can connect to port 1?  Does
it print anything?  (8 bit, no parity, 9600 baud, IIRC.)

Do you see any OPCOM messages on the VMS system when you power up
the DECServer?  If the load server (of whatever ilk, DECnet MOP,
LANACP MOP, BOOTP) is running, it should notice the download
request and log an OPCOM message, and then a 2nd message when it
succeeds or fails or defers to another load host.

If there are no OPCOM messages, two possibilities:  1) If this is
an AUI/Thin-wire DECServer, is the selector switch in the right
position.  (Twisted-pair DEC servers shouldn't have this issue :-)
2) If the DECServer doesn't get a response to its load request,
it will back off for a while and try again.  Initially the back off
is a minute or two, but I think it can grow to longer than you're
probably willing to wait...  like hours.  Power-cycling should
reset this.

That's right!  The problem with this approach is that it wipes your
configuration.  If you don't want to have to issue 8, or 16, DEFINE/SET
PORT commands, an alternative to resetting is preferable!

Sorry about that.  I just naturally use &quot;TCP/IP&quot; to refer to the whole

Holding down the reset switch during power up fixed my first problem, which
was that it printed garbage on the console. I suspect that line was not set
to 9600,N,8,1. Now I can see the console, but it just tells me that there is

This is an AUI box, but there is no selector switch I can see. When the

In NCP, verify that the ethernet circuit shows &quot;service =

If you have clustering on then the hardware address set during boot

I made a lot of progress thanks to this posting. I thought that all OPCOM

that after running DSVCONFIG.COM I needed to copy the SYS from
SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER] to SYS$COMMON:[MOM$SYSTEM]. I am not clear why
DSVCONFIG did not copy it there for me or point MOP to the right location.

That is because it was expecting MOM$LOAD to be a search list that
included SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER], MOM$SYSTEM:.

I do not remember if the installation of the package that installed the
DSVCONFIG command file did it automatically or if it was a post
installation step.

On Phase IV, I stopped running DSVCONFIG.COM a long time ago.  It was
faster to put together a DCL script that did the important part.  That
was putting in the name to I.P. address mapping in the DECNET tables.

After the service is enabled for the ethernet circuit, and the DECServer
load image is put where MOM$LOAD will find it, your basically done.

None of the information is actually used in a DECServer downloading its
load image.

The I.P. address to name mapping is used for two purposes only:

1. It gives the name of the DECserver that is doing the download on the
opcom messages.  This is why I used the script to make sure that the
DECNET tables were up to date on all of the systems.  When I heard the
opcom beeps, I could look at any console to see which DECServer rebooted.

2. It allows TSM and manual commands to connect to the command interface
of the terminal server by specifying the node name instead of the I.P.
address.

If you are using TSM, then you will probably want the scripts I wrote
that are in the Freeware 5.0 distribution in the tsm_tools directory.

Decservers will load their boot image from any host on the network that
answers the MOP request by claiming that it has a load filename of the
name requested by the DECServer.

Nothing that DSVCONFIG.COM does will affect this.  Which means on a
large network with multiple VMS administrators, it is very possible that
there will be out of date DecServer load images, and you could find
sometimes that you are running an out of date version.  And at the site
I was at, that could really mess up the production printers.

Generally I made a copy of the current download image, giving it a site
specific name.

Then I changed the DECserver to request that specific image when it
boots.  This was the only way that I could guarantee that my DECservers
were loaded with the correct image.

In the NCP database, you can put almost any text for the download
filename of a DECserver, as it is totally ignored by everything.

As I recall, TSM also requested the name of the load image for it's
database of managing the server.  It also ignores this information,
other than possibly putting it in the DECNET database where it is

&gt;&gt;&gt;At least some DECservers can boot using either MOP or BOOTP (TCP/IP
&gt;&gt;&gt;protocol).  It attempts to boot using whatever was successful the last
&gt;&gt;&gt;time.  If you have, as I once did, something that will answer a BOOTP
&gt;&gt;&gt;request, and a MOP boot fails, you can get a situation where the
&gt;&gt;&gt;DECserver switches over to BOOTP.  The way out is to connect it to a VMS
&gt;&gt;&gt;system with a crossover cable making sure that VMS cannot respond to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;BOOTP request.  When BOOTP fails it will try MOP which succeeds and
&gt;&gt;&gt;resets things.

&gt; I have not enabled BOOTP, unless it is enabled by default, so this should
&gt; not apply.

&gt;&gt;There is a bit of magic that will cause a DECServer to reset to its
&gt;&gt;factory default configuration.  The exact sequence varies with model,
&gt;&gt;but for some, I think you hold down the reset button while it's
&gt;&gt;powering up.

&gt; Holding down the reset switch during power up fixed my first problem, which
&gt; was that it printed garbage on the console. I suspect that line was not set
&gt; to 9600,N,8,1. Now I can see the console, but it just tells me that there is
&gt; a load failure due to a timeout.

&gt;&gt;Does your DECServer have a 7-segment LED display?  If so, what is it
&gt;&gt;doing?  (IIRC, for most models, it counts down from about 8 to about
&gt;&gt;3 while it selftests, and then waits for a download.)

&gt;&gt;Do you have a terminal or emulator you can connect to port 1?  Does
&gt;&gt;it print anything?  (8 bit, no parity, 9600 baud, IIRC.)

&gt;&gt;Do you see any OPCOM messages on the VMS system when you power up
&gt;&gt;the DECServer?  If the load server (of whatever ilk, DECnet MOP,
&gt;&gt;LANACP MOP, BOOTP) is running, it should notice the download
&gt;&gt;request and log an OPCOM message, and then a 2nd message when it
&gt;&gt;succeeds or fails or defers to another load host.

&gt; No, I do not see any OPCOM messages on the console.

&gt;&gt;If there are no OPCOM messages, two possibilities:  1) If this is
&gt;&gt;an AUI/Thin-wire DECServer, is the selector switch in the right
&gt;&gt;position.  (Twisted-pair DEC servers shouldn't have this issue :-)
&gt;&gt;2) If the DECServer doesn't get a response to its load request,
&gt;&gt;it will back off for a while and try again.  Initially the back off
&gt;&gt;is a minute or two, but I think it can grow to longer than you're
&gt;&gt;probably willing to wait...  like hours.  Power-cycling should
&gt;&gt;reset this.

&gt; This is an AUI box, but there is no selector switch I can see. When the
&gt; diagnostic lights on the DECserver indicate network activity I can see the
&gt; lights on the switch flash, so it is doing something and I think it is
&gt; getting to the LAN.
">

Okay, if it really is making boot requests, then lack of OPCOM messages
means the VMS system isn't seeing them.  If LANACP or DECNET MOP handler
(forget what process/image this is) is configured incorrectly, then
it would see MOP download requests from an unknown system and would log
it to OPCOM, so it must either not be running or must not be listening
on the correct ethernet adapter.  Do you have more than one ethernet NIC?
Are you running LANACP or DECnet?  DECnet 4 or 5?

If LANACP, post the output of LANCP's SHOW MOPDLL, SHOW DEVICE/CHAR,
SHOW NODE/ALL and SHOW CONFIG commands

For DECnet-5, $ mcr ncl show mop circuit * all

For DECnet-4, I forget the commands.

Maybe a little late to join the fray, but you might find this useful for
some of the background:
http://www.downloads.xdelta.co.uk/vmstjv5%20feb2005/decnet%20article%... -
it's an article I wrote for the Technical Journal a while back.

I'd recommend the effort to get to grips with Phase V as it does do a better
job, especially in multiple LAN (or VLAN) networks, for example you get load
balancing on all paths for the price of an end-system license. Phase V can
also give you a lot more useful information when trying to figure out what's
happening.

Have fun!

Cheers, Colin.

But a worse job on Security, without the SET EXECUTOR DEFAULT ACCESS NONE
capability of Phase IV.  That is what is required by NIST SP 800-53
SC-7 Boundary Protection Control Enhancement (5) required for Moderate
and High (FIPS-199) impact systems:

(5) The information system denies network traffic by default
and allows network traffic by exception (i.e., deny all,
permit by exception).

And the DECUS (sic) Security SIG made a formal request of DEC (sic) to
fix that before Phase V was released, many years before NIST SP 800-53
was released.

Indeed they did - and yes, I'd like to see it back as well.

&gt; I made a lot of progress thanks to this posting. I thought that all OPCOM
&gt; messages were already going to the console, but they weren't. It turned
&gt; out that after running DSVCONFIG.COM I needed to copy the SYS from
&gt; SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER] to SYS$COMMON:[MOM$SYSTEM]. I am not clear why
&gt; DSVCONFIG did not copy it there for me or point MOP to the right location.

&gt; Thanks

I see that you missed my post in the thread about the DECserver.
