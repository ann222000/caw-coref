I'm not a long-term OS X user, so I'm not familiar with many of the issues
he writes about, but an interesting read.

Took me a while to get through it though ;-)

John's reviews are probably the best, most technically grounded
reviews of OS X I've seen published. His 10.4 review remains my 'go-
to' article when I want to explain to people how Core Video works,
for example.

Thanks for pointing it out, I'm anticipating reading it with relish
(perhaps some ketchup, too! 8-)

I'm always looking for the practical points.

Here's how he says to get a more Tiger like Dock:
-----------------------------------
If you want the alternate look when the Dock is on the bottom too,
type the following commands at a Terminal prompt:
% defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES
% killall Dock
-----------------------------------

To undo the above(change the YES to NO):
-----------------------------------
% defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean NO
% killall Dock
-----------------------------------

P. S. I tested the undo so I could play with the &quot;Half Drop&quot; effect.
That's where if you only go half way down the icon it only highlights
for your file to &quot;Drop On&quot; a program for &quot;Open With&quot; functionality,
but if you go all the way down to the 3D shelf then you can &quot;Drop On&quot;
or &quot;Drop Between&quot;.

note: holding &lt;command&gt;&lt;option&gt; will allow you to force the &quot;Drop On&quot;
effect for &quot;Open With&quot; functionality of Apps that would otherwise
refuse to try opening the file.  This was important for me when
someone renamed jpg files to the zip extention before emailing to me
to get it through a corporate spam catcher.  I'd just drag that image
to Preview and force it to try opening it.

For these old eyes, using only a 17&quot; c2d, it is really hard to see &amp;
be able to differentiate, what is what, with  the new Leopard look
folder icons; even worse in the transparent dock, where I have to zoom
in, to find if something is open (  I prefer the black triangle).
Stacks drives me mad. Don't like transparent menu, either.

I prefer to have a &quot;bootable&quot; back-up and therefore, won't give up

Apple is quickly moving to larger displays, so there are several
things that seem to look better in the latest version of the OS when
it's on the latest version of the hardware.

Personally I think the problem is that you can't opt out of these high
end features to just &quot;upgrade the core&quot; and keep your old OS fresh
enough to work with the latest software.  It's that &quot;Latest Software&quot;
that requires an upgrade.  If new software could be made 10.2
compatible, but sense Leopard options and use them when available,
that'd keep a larger customer base.  And if Apple would define that
version that all software should work with this year, there'd be much
more certainty for the customers, even if it was &quot;certainly not
officially supported&quot;, at least it'd be certain.  People who want
newer computers would still get them, but their old Macs wouldn't
&quot;have to be&quot; thrown away / recycled so soon.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Stacks drives me mad.
">

The problem I'm sensing in most responses is that people expect them
to work like folders.  They are a different thing.  I love stacks, but
I also miss folders on the dock.

I'm currently experimenting with having no Apps on the dock, and
grouping App Aliases into logical stacks.  For example, my &quot;Internet&quot;
stack has Safari, Firefox, and Mail.  So far it feels like a set of
start menus (you know... MS Windows) but more efficient.  It does get
odd when I've minimized several windows (which I didn't realize I did
so often).  It seems like stacks would be better on the Apps side, or
in a third zone.  Maybe I'll just get used to it, it's only been a
couple hours.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Don't like transparent menu, either.
">

I don't like Broccoli but that doesn't make it bad.  Depending on the
background I like it as a washed out and blurred background to the
menu.  It would be nice if we could choose an opaque menu though.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I prefer both.  TimeMachine gives me several versions, a history of my
files, and much faster restore of small things than SuperDuper.  But
when the world comes crashing down, it's nice to just boot into my
backup and run with it till I have a better time to recover
completely.  In case you don't know, you can boot from the install DVD
and restore a Time Machine backup w/o having to install Leopard
first.  I'm wondering what Time Machine will do when I boot from my
SuperDuper backup since I keep Time Machine on a second partition of
the external drive. Will it let me restore forward too? LOL.

Doable, but not without *great* pain.  I love my older systems, but
it's just not reasonable to hold developers down, to cater to a tiny
percentage of end-users.  You're asking them to implement a feature,
then re-implement it for each older system/framework.  What a PITA!
Then how do you test it?  Unless they keep older macs and older
systems around, they're writing blind - depending on forgiving alpha
and beta testers to do the dirty work.  Not good.  The time factor
alone would hold up apps for so long, they'd never get &quot;done&quot;.  Do
you really want buggy garbage like they have in the windozs world?

To give you an idea of the magnitude of this problem, take a look at
the recent stats collected by Sparkle in Adium.  Sparkle is the
package that manages Adium's updates.
&lt; http://www.adiumx.com/sparkle/ &gt;

Of particular note is the OS Version chart, near the bottom of the
page ... ~115K use OS X 10.4.  Only 10K use 10.3.  Older OSen account
for only 0.28%.  And *already* there are 13K using Leopard - more
than using Panther!!!!

Is it really fair to expect developers to spend their time on
supporting the older systems, instead of fixing current bugs and
otherwise improving their products for 99% of their market?

FWIW,

I can see I wasn't clear enough.  There are lots of features in
Leopard that require newish hardware to run.  But there are also lots
of features that could run on much older hardware just fine.  I'm
suggesting that there's a way for Apple to make the compatible
features available to owners of that older hardware.

In Windows there's DirectX 10, and you can run XP w/o it, but you
can't run some software w/o it.  But there is plenty of software that
will run w/o it.  And if you want DX10 support, you have to upgrade
your video card.

That's the kind of distinction I'm suggesting.  The features come with
the OS, and if you want them to run you have to have the hardware to
support it.  Customers should have a simple way to check if their
system supports the major feature in question and if it does, then
they can buy the software that requires it, as well as buy software
with the knowledge that the features they need will work even w/o
support for that major OS feature.

In the case of Leopard, I could see Core Animation requiring a minimum
CPU or Graphics card (or combination of the two).  And I think there's
enough detail in the &quot;Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard: the Ars Technica review&quot;
article to conclude that developers could write programs that would
work with or without Core Animation, and could set a flag to require
Core Animation if it was truly needed.  Most of the uses of Core
Animation suggested are for &quot;more visually appealing&quot; software
interaction.

Users of older Macs would be happier and would say things like, &quot;So
it's less appealing, at least I can still use it.&quot;

This would still mean that systems will become obsolete (unable to
upgrade), but they'd stay current longer and also live longer lives
since they'd become obsolete later. Therefore they'd provide more
customers to 3rd party developers, encourage a larger number of
software titles on the mac, and thus more potential customers for
Apple and all the developers.

This isn't really about hardware.  From the developer's point of
view, it's all about software frameworks (the shared libraries
provided by Apple in the OS).  Many/most frameworks already
automagically use special hardware features if they're available, and
&quot;emulate&quot; the function if not.

The problem is that as frameworks advance, they do more and more - so
the programmer has to do less and less.  If the function is not
available in an older framework, then the programmer has only two
choices:  Don't support that older OS or write the whole thing
himself.

What you're suggesting is, in essence, for the programmer to pick a
least common denominator, and then never use anything more advanced.
That way the app can run on the older systems as well as the new,
without extra coding.  That's fine, if you want to ignore n years
worth of Apple's advances.

[This is why, back in the 80s, I used to support a particularly large
application that was written in FORTRAN II; the equivalent of driving
the flintmobile on a superhighway. FORTRAN II is from 1958, and was
replaced by FORTRAN IV in 1961.]

I understand what you're saying.  It's a tough balancing act.  I
think it's made more difficult because people that use older hardware
are *less* willing to pay to have the app supported.

Does Leopard allow Thumbnail previews of videos?  I have to say that
it's the one thing I get in Windows XP and Vista (which I don't love),
but not in Tiger.  To answer this, if you have Leopard, simply download
and AVI and see if you get an icon preview of it in icon view mode.

Larry,

My comment was in the context of changing the equation of what's
required to upgrade to a new OS, so the requirements for running new
software would change too.

I was trying to explain my idea in an email and have come to the
conclusion that it's just too big, involving too many variables to
completely explain.  The point is that Apple has forced the Leopard
installer to refuse to install on machines that don't have at least an
867 MHz CPU, and I think they could change their approach so they
could keep those customers current for the same upgrade price instead
of forcing them to choose between buying a whole new computer and just
staying obsolete.

My speculation is that the overwhelming majority of Leopard would run
on significantly lesser hardware, and there are only a few of the
major features of Leopard that would have to be disabled on those
computers to make it happen.

Maybe the point should be that if 3rd party developers were to commit
to developing for Panther (10.2), and their software would work in
Tiger and Leopard too, then those customers wouldn't be obsolete.  I
suspect that a lot of software could be developed that way and it
would just work even better in Leopard.  But we all know it's better
if everyone can upgrade to the latest OS.

So in my ideal world, everyone would upgrade to leopard, and based on
their hardware, certain features would be enabled, such as Spotlight,
Core Animation, and Time Machine.  If your hardware could handle the
basics of the OS, then you'd check an &quot;Enabled Features&quot; panel to see
what features are enabled.  Older hardware can be kept current, but
would lack some features.  Programmers could disable groups of
features and test their software, then add support for features that
would enhance their products, but they'd still be functional on lesser
hardware unless their software absolutely required some feature, like
DVD Burning.  This is the best short explanation I can come up with,
and since we're not likely to influence Apple with comments on this
list, I don't wish to expend the effort to write more about it unless
a publisher or someone is willing to pay for my opinion.  Don't get me
wrong, I love helping others with free advice.  I just feel this has
gone way beyond that, and it's my own fault for bringing it up.

So I'd like to politely stop encouraging it now.  If you all wish to
make comments and/or discuss it among yourselves, feel free, just
kindly forgive me for bowing out of future comments on this subject.

It probably would not.  Apple makes most of their money on hardware
sales, be it the iPod or a computer.  You also have to factor in
support costs for the extra machines being supported.  Plus you have
legacy issues with hardware support.  If you turn off X feature what
are the dependencies on Y and Z?  It is not a simple thing.  I am sure
a cost analysis was done on where to cut it off.  Plus PPC is now dead
for Apple from a hardware perspective.

With the caveat that I&quot;ve only seen screenshots yet, I agree with

spring-loaded folders in my dock, it's probably going to take some
serious musle retraining to get used to them.

I also have some reservations about coverflow everywhere. I initially
really liked this feature in iTunes, but oddly I've found it less and
less useful as time went on. At least for my tastes, it was too fast,
I spent too much time flipping back and forth to get to one album or
song.

yes, but... more and more of their business depends on that software.
And it has become a significant revenue source.

Apple sold 2 million copies of Leopard in the first three days.
That's 2 million times ... $100 avg retail or $80 wholesale... call
it $160,000,000 to $200,000,000 revenue.  Not too shabby for three
days sales.  Certainly not something to wag your bart at either.

According to the latest quarterly (extending), Apple capitalizes
about $120M on development of OS X per year.

Potential sales ... Macs from 2001 to this year, is about 38M units?
* $80, is $3 BILLION+.

Not too shabby, for Just A Hardware Company.

Possibly significant, but I'll wager it's dwarfed by their hardware

Apple is, and has always been a computer company. They make computer
hardware; their entire income model is predicated on selling
hardware. They've expanbded (iPods, iPhones, ITMS) but fundamentally
Apple's software is offered as an incentive to buy their hardware.

So your point of view is that it's not worth Apple's time to make an
extra few *BILLION* dollars every 18 months?

Sure, if they would make a few extra billion every 18 months, yes
that would be significant.

However we're talking about the real world here, not some fantasy
'everyone and their brother
runs out and buys the newest OS X' just because they can run it on
their PowerMac 8600.

Oddly enough, Apple seems to be run by some very competent business
folks; they're staggeringly profitable, healthily outperforming the
market and their market segment, and I'm willing to believe that they
have looked into the cost/benefits of maintaining a longer 'tail' of
OS compatibility.

Are you saying this is hardware income? I think not, but it begs the
question, is digitized music &quot;software&quot;?  It's certainly a resource
included in many software packages.  So is iTunes Store revenue in the
&quot;Software Income&quot; category?

And shouldn't we at some point start a new thread since this seems to

LOL.  Sorry, but you gotta read the sanity there.  By your
definition, OS X is a loss-leader.  So as long as they
recover the cost of developing and marketing the OS, it's worth selling!

18 months... call it 2 years.  $120M * 2 = $240M for development.
Add an over-generous $60M for marketing and production.  Their break
even point around 3.75 M units.  Surely they can sell at least that
many copies of OS X every two years.  heh.  Forget the marketing -
they could sell that many sans marketing!

(Of course, remember that the $120M/yr, from a tax pov, is
capitalized expense.  The after-deduction &quot;value&quot; of that means that
the &quot;break even&quot; point is really much lower.)

I really think OS X has become a profit center for Apple.  Ok, so
it's not their biggest and perhaps not even big compared to their
other products but still...

sigh.  If only it was truely Universal x86 - for Mac and PC
platforms.  Now that would be PROFIT.

TO prove Dan,s point even more, Apple has almost 1 BILLION IN CASH!!
Microsoft can't even make that claim, only the owner.
And the 4k + share of stock that I was laughed at buying (at 15
dollars, oh they are going to fold!)
Apple could re package the Newton and at this point i would not care.

Apple released QT 7.3 yesterday, and it seems to be an issue for at
least one app (ProfCast).  You might want to wait a week or so before
upgrading iTunes which includes Quicktime.

Wm

P. S. Here's the message I received moments ago:
------------------------------------------------------
Yesterday Apple released QuickTime 7.3, an update to it's QuickTime
software.  Apple has made some fundamental changes to QuickTime and to
the underlying CoreAudio technologies in this new release of QuickTime
(these changes are also evident in Leopard).

If you have not upgraded to QuickTime 7.3, please wait to do so.  We
are working on providing a resolution to these fun new updates as
quickly as we can!
