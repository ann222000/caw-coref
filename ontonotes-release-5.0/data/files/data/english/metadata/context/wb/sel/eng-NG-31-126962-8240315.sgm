Crap. Is it that time again? About every six months or so I forget what
they do to me and get the urge. Ok, pick me up 8 cheese rectum rockets and
a chocolate shake-like beverage. Ignore the horseshoes in the garbage cans
outside.

Yep. I'm having an E.coli craving and I can't seem to get rid of it. Please
FedEx a burger ASAP.

If they've been eating at White Castle, no one will be able to pick

Funny, they all have that, it's a matter of taking it home with you.
I used to savor the hunt until Mrs Boots caught me, now I'm consigned

Must be difference in location, location, location. Or maybe because
my 3 am meals tend to Denny's Grand Slams. Only females I see a WC are
those behind the counter and most don't even come close to willowy and
do not a favorable tooth to tatoo ratio.

Rectum rockets, sliders, horse hoagies, colon cloggers. All the same. The

Magnets draw steel and shit draws flies.

This morning seems one for thread-enders.  Perhaps it's me.  Perhaps
it's the weather.  We seem to be getting the national supply of rain
just now.  Weather does seem to influence the mood, or vice versa, or
sumpin.

I wonder if turnabouts are fair play.  They say so, but what do they
know, really?  Besides, everyone knows life is not about fair play,
it's about winning.  Or surviving.  Or affluence.  Or sumpin.

I used to eat 3am meals at Denny's.  It was quite a while back.  The
meals usually came at the end of the day.  Now I seldom eat before
noon when I've drunk pots and pots of coffee and put in a day's work.

Those opposite-gender hotties you seek are out there, and they are
actively looking for you.  The prollem is that both you and they are
ookin-pa-nub-in-ah-da-wong-pwaces.  Temporal and spacial coexistence
is required, synchronicity of sorts, two atoms collide on non-random
bases after all, the trick is allowing a collision and being quick
enough to explode on impact.  If you're a pond raindrops will fall
into you, if you're a peak rocks will roll down you and be seen on top
nevermore... if you're a volcano everything living will flee.

It's what you are that matters, not what you appear to be, or where
you hang out.  Itchy little chihuauas aren't the same as long-haired
persians, they're different.  You don't even have to join the army.
