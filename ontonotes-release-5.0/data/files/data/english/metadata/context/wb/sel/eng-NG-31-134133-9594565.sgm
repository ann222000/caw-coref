In a casino, the house has an &quot;edge&quot; - an unfair advantage. The odds
of making money are weighted in their favor by the rules of the game.
Individuals in a casino land big wins now and then but over time the
casino can never lose - the odds guarantee this.
Your trading edge must be something which swings the odds in your
favor whilst you trade. Then you rake in cash like clockwork from a
sea of hopeless punters - just like casino owners.
So, what is your trading edge?

...but before we go any further allow me to answer your first
question: &quot;why would such a successful trader go to the trouble of
teaching you?&quot;. Excellent question!!
Listen, in my time I have witnessed first-hand some truly shocking
tales of trading woe which would make your hair stand on end. Traders
who have lost everything, gone bankrupt and cast themselves and their
loved ones out on the street.
But worst of all was when I discovered one friend tried to take his
own life after wiping out his entire life savings. Luckily he survived
but since that day, no matter how high I soared with my trading
profits, I vowed to rescue as many traders from being shredded by
market wolves as possible. It's what I feel I was born to do. And as I
mentioned earlier, I do so at great personal risk - I'll tell you why
further down...
And so I began to teach my methods to a handful of traders - with
truly astonishing results. But there are 24 short hours in a day and
only so many traders I can help one-to-one. So I decided to boil down
my method and system to a concentrated, power-packed course which you
can tear off and read in bite size chunks any time you choose.
Because I know what works like gangbusters in the markets, I also know
what doesn't work. Not a soul I have found is teaching a system like
mine, one which truly works across every market. And I've seen it all.
I've paid hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars for woeful trading
products barely worth the paper they were printed on. Some were so
poor they even made me laugh. But they made another part of me angry,
really angry...
