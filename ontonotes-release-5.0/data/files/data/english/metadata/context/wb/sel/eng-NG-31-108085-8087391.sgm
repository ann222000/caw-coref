At NARAM a few folks inquired about the knit mylar sunscreens we had around
our canopies.

http://www.gothicarchgreenhouses.com/shade_aluminet.htm is where I got mine
from. The densest stuff they have is the 70% reflectivity, which is what I
got and what you want. The ones I first saw at the dog shows were absurdly
expensive for the 50% stuff, which is why I didn't buy then. Twice the price
for the less dense material. I see there is now an Aluminet Ultra.

The Aluminet works MUCH better than a tarp for blocking the sun. It lets the
air through, and REFLECTS rather than absorbs the sun's heat, so it doesn't
get hot underneath.

At the time Gothic's minimum order was $50, which is why I got 2. I wasn't
sure of the exact dimensions given the way the E-Z-up flairs from top to
bottom, or how much if any you lose when hemming the edges, so to be safe I
got 7x10.5', but it looks like 7x10' would have been fine for the standard
size E-Z-Ups. It would be really cool if they could make them as trapezoids
to exactly match the E-Z-up side, but that's probably pushing the envelope!
They were just under $30 each. Add 10 grommets per screen ( $0.15-0.25, for
permanent brass or plastic clip on), and $10 shipping, and the total came to
about $72, or $36 each.

So far I've used the big black binder clips to fasten the screen to the
E-Z-up. The short bungee tie downs with the plastic knob also work well.
Better ideas are welcome. We use some plastic fence posts to extend one out
as an awning to shade the dog from the hot sun.

Gothic doesn't actually make the stuff, they just re-sell it. It's made by
Green-Tek in Edgerton WI ( http://www.green-tek.com/alum.html between Beloit
and Madison just off I90), but Green-Tek doesn't accept consumer orders.
Looks like all Gothic does is transfer the order to Green-Tek who makes the
material to order, and ships it directly to the Gothic customer.

WARNING: I ordered mine in late spring, which is their busy season. It took
about 2 months to get. But they don't bill me until it ships. The person at
Gothic I dealt with is Nicole Davis. Her name and number was on the web
site. She did a good job of informing me of the lead time, and let me know
when it would ship. My teammate Ken ordered some a year later, and got his
in about 2-3 weeks IIRC.
