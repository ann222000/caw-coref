Hi, folks.
I recently dug out a bunch of very dirty/dusty/moldy 78s, and I want to clean
them and see how they sound. Do any of you wise people know the best way to
clean them? I'm afraid that water alone would not be enough, but anything else
might dissolve the vinyl (?) and/or leave residue in the grooves. I don't want
to use anything abrasive either, but if I can't dig the yucky stuff out of the
grooves, they won't be playable. Are today's needles the same as in years
past? (Want to make sure that the needle, itself, wouldn't harm them.) Thank
you for your help. :)
Kisses,
Cyn

The safest way would be to wipe off dust with a soft cloth
or remove mildew with a damp cloth, but I don't know about
the heavy cleaning you need to do.

Only use needles that were created for the purpose of
playing 78 rpm. They are still being produced &amp; I've seen
ads for them in magazines &amp; newspapers.

If you were referring to playing them on a phonograph,
rather than a victrola, I think you can still purchase the
33-45-78 rpm needles at Radio Shack.

Thank you, my friends. I appreciate the advice. :-) I may try to play them
on Sunday on a friend's turntable (I don't have one here) if I can get over to
R Shack to pick up the 78rpm needle/cartridge before then.

There were a bunch of old family records in the stack, dating from the teens
through the forties, but the ones I most care about were recorded by my mother.
I salvaged a couple of those last year, but I just found this new stack.
These are far less scratched up, so I'm excited to hear them, but they are far
more, uh, gunky.

As for melting them and making popcorn bowls, that is not an option for obvious
reasons as well as the fact that some of them have metal inside. But thanks
for the suggestion. ;) I also found a couple of old &quot;test pressings&quot; from
Columbia Records. Have no idea what to do with them or how they wound up mixed
in with these.

Thanks again.

leave your stereo switch set to stereo, not mono. And if

_________________________________________________________________

The most frequently asked question continues to be from the very
first day of the group: &quot;Where can I buy steel needles for my
Victrola?&quot;
* Answer: Contact the Antique Phonograph Supply Company, Route
23, Box 123, Davenport Center, NY 13751. Phone 607-278-6218
or  http://www.antiquephono.com . Remember to change your
needles after every play. The engineering concept was simple:
the needles are softer than the record, and will wear without
stressing the record. Some records had grit in the mix to
wear the needle and not the record.
____________________________________________________________

Section 1.1: Technical Questions about Phonographs

1.

I have found a phonograph. Can I overwind it? I've never wound one before.

+ Unless you wind your new acoustic phonograph very
quickly and let the wound spring(s) fetch up sharply,
you should not worry about overwinding. Turn the crank
slowly until you feel the springs tighten. After a few
tries, this should be second nature to you. If you hear
a spring slip after you wind a few turns, or if the
handle keeps turning forever, you have a broken or
disconnected spring. A single-spring phonograph will
play 1 or 1.5 records. A 2-spring model will play for
2-5 records. There are also 3 and 4 spring models.
2.

My phonograph does not work. What can I do?

+ Answer: There is one excellent book which explains how
old phonographs, gramophones and cylinder players work.
&quot;The Compleat Talking Machine&quot; by Eric Reiss. It is also
available from APSCO listed above. It explains how to
work on a phonograph to get it running again. It
contains detailed photographs. Be sure to buy the Third
Edition since it contains updated price lists and a good
discussion of fake phonographs.
3.

I have just found this wonderful windup phonograph. How can I tell if it
works? I don't have time to read a book. What can I do? (Is it REAL? See
Q4 below).

+ Answer: Phonographs are found which look new. Others
look as if they have been sitting in a wet basement for
70 years. But there are a few quick tests:
+ Does the dealer demonstrate the unit? If it plays and
sounds fine, it probably is in good shape. It is
relatively hard to hide problems with spring motors.
+ Is the spring broken? This means that your turn the
crank and nothing happens. Usually the spring is broken
near the center, so the phonograph does not play. New
springs can be found for most phonographs from the
Antique Phonograph Supply Company. Cost: about $50 if
you send in the barrel. If a new spring is not
available, you can patch the old one by following
instructions in the Reiss book listed below. But please
note that you may not want to do this without some
experience since you can cut your fingers off.
+ If the turntable rotates (or the cylinder turns), but
you hear a loud bump while the record is playing, then
the spring needs grease.

a. This is not easy. Purists will say to take the
spring out of the barrel, clean it and the reload the
barrel. Warning: if you try to do this, you can cut your
fingers off. The barrel is a cylinder into which the
spring is wound. Some cheaper units simply have an open
spring. Greasing such a spring is much more easy.
b. Shortcut: You can add grease to the spring
without first taking it out of the barrel. Most barrels
had an opening called a graphite hole. Wind up the unit
all the way. Take the plug out of the graphite hole and
force in grease. The original Edison formula, which I
have used, contains 10 parts vasoline to 1 part
graphite. Put the screw back in the hole. Let the unit
run down, dispersing the grease.
+ Listen to see if the governor is in good shape. When you
play the unit, is there a high speed vibration. If so,
you may need work on the governor. This is difficult.
+ If the turntable works (or the cylinder turns), then
play a record. What does it sound like? If you hear a
lot of vibrations, or if the sound is bad, you probably
need to rebuild the reproducer.

a. Rebuilding an Edison reproducer for a cylinder
phonograph is ususally an easy job. Kits cost $6.00. A
new sapphire is $30.00 and is likely to outlast you.
b. Rebuilding a Victor #2 (the most common) is not
difficult either.
c. Rebuilding a Diamond Disc reproducer is more
difficult. The old diaphragms take effort to remove
without damage. It can be done. Kits are available. New
diamond needles: $60.00. But the old diamond may be in
good shape.
d. Rebuilding the Victor Orthophonic is very
difficult and few people will touch this one. Such
reproducers (heads) cost about $100 in auctions. Many
were made of pot metal, and they are gradually falling
apart.
e. Rebuilding other heads requires buying generic parts
and doing the best you can. 6. Ok, I don't know much
about mechanical things. What can I do? You can send the
entire works off for repair and cleaning. This costs
about $150 for an Edison unit. 7. What about parts? What
if something wears out? If you buy an Edison or a
Victor, most motor parts are still available. As for the
other units around, if something other than the spring
is broken, you might want to look for a different unit
unless you are handy around a machine shop, or are
willing to pay to send the entire motor out for repair.
4.

The dealer offered me a nice external horn machine. Is it a fake or a
reproduction? Is it as old as he says it is? The catalog says the
phonograph is 'remanufactured.' What does this mean?

+ Answer: Since external horn machines command a big
price, operators in South Asia has begun taking old
motors and remanufacturing cases to make 'new' old
phonographs. These phonographs are often excellent in
appearance, and come with marvelous reproduction brass
horns and often with good reproducers too. But their
weakness is often the motor, which is from an old
portable

"/> Cyn, if a job is worth doing then it's worth doing right.

Just like 33s (vinyl LPs) your 78s can be professionally cleaned, by a
specialist audio dealer offering this service. The record is placed on
a special machine (like a big turntable) a special arm tracks the
record whilst it injects a cleaning liquid (fluid) into the groove,
agitates the dirt within the groove and then sucks all the crap out
with a power vacuum, each groove is clean as the arm continues to
track. With vinyl the fluid is a fast evaporating alcohol based
cleaner, with vintage shellac it's clean pure filtered water, or
sometimes with a special additive to the water (Discwasher D4 fluid)

The whole process is quickly achieved, and the cost per record is not
excessive. The cleaning system produces good results provided that the

As to a suitable 78 cartridge. Stanton (Pickering) or Ortofon are only
two of the better companies today which manufacture 78 cartridges,
there are quite a few more. Stanton is perhaps the best of the bunch
at a resonable cost.

But whatever you do .. DO NOT .. used a cartridge which has been
design only to play modern micro-grooved 33 rpm LPs. In order to play
78s the styli (stylus) and cantilever need to be up to the job and
need to be replaced.

&gt;Cyn, if a job is worth doing then it's worth doing right.

&gt;Just like 33s (vinyl LPs) your 78s can be professionally cleaned, by a
&gt;specialist audio dealer offering this service. The record is placed on
&gt;a special machine (like a big turntable) a special arm tracks the
&gt;record whilst it injects a cleaning liquid (fluid) into the groove,
&gt;agitates the dirt within the groove and then sucks all the crap out
&gt;with a power vacuum, each groove is clean as the arm continues to
&gt;track. With vinyl the fluid is a fast evaporating alcohol based
&gt;cleaner, with vintage shellac it's clean pure filtered water, or
&gt;sometimes with a special additive to the water (Discwasher D4 fluid)

&gt;The whole process is quickly achieved, and the cost per record is not
&gt;excessive. The cleaning system produces good results provided that the
&gt;cleaning machine is set up properly and the operator knows his/her
&gt;job.

&gt;As to a suitable 78 cartridge. Stanton (Pickering) or Ortofon are only

"/>  You know, if you have Edison records and you want to play
those on modern turntable, you must have a 'modern' stereo
cartridge and you should use the .7 mil needle too for best
results. As for all the fears expressed here, hopelessly
overblown.

Sorry to be a &quot;fearmonger&quot; but washing 78's with a toothbrush &amp; soap &amp; water
is not advisable ! I had a collection of 78's and did exactly that and they
ended up sounding much worse than originally . I'm no expert on such things
but I was told by someone who is that the soap leaves a residue at the
bottom of the grooves and attracts dirt , thus resulting in poor sound
quality . Now if this info is correct or not I honestly couldn't say but I
do know what the results were when I tried it !!!
If passing on advice is construed as &quot;fearmongering&quot; what would be
the point of newsgroups at all ?!!!

&gt;Ronnie
&gt;=====

"/> Yes. Transfer to CD is definitely the way to go. I had that done with the
records I dug out last year. Went to a recording studio and had them clean the
records, enhance/reconstruct some of the sound (because the records were
so-o-o-o scratched up), and then transfer onto CD. The result was still very
scratchy, but at least the recordings were preserved. The problem was the
expense--not *that* expensive just for a simple transfer, but when they add in
the studio time.... This new batch of records I found includes some of the
same recordings I had transferred as well as others. But they are all less
scratched, so it might even be worthwhile having the duplicates
transferred--might have a better quality result. The thing is, I want to be
able to listen to them before I bring them to the studio so I can compare and
decide whether it is worth having them redone. That's why I wanted to find out
the right way to clean and play them. Don't feel like having to bat my
eyelashes at the studio guys to get them to clean and play the records for me,
so I can decide whether to have them transferred.

Anyway, thanks again for all the advice from everyone. George, I appreciate
your experience and expertise. Since some of them are my mother's recordings,
I really don't want to risk damaging them, so I think I'll take the good Mr.
McK's advice about bringing them to an audio dealer to have them cleaned, just
to be on the safe side. With the other records, maybe I'll try cleaning them
myself, using the advice I've received here. :)

&quot;Section IX - Sound restoration&quot;

&quot;Q9.1 - How can I play old 78s?

&quot;First rule of thumb: DO NOT PLAY THEM WITH AN LP STYLUS!

&quot;The grooves on 78s are gigantic compared to the microgroove LPs. As a
result, specialized styli are needed for proper playback of 78s. Also,
the RIAA equalization curve normally used for LPs has no relation to
the frequencies that were equalized on 78 recordings.

&quot;The easiest stylus to obtain is the Shure V15 with the 78 pickup.
This is a good, though not great, 78 stylus and will do an okay job at
playing most discs.

&quot;The serious 78 collector will want to obtain not only a collection of
78 styli for the various discs in their collection (groove sizes
varied, and most serious collectors own a handful of styli), but also
a preamp with variable equalization curves. One supplier of
all this apparatus is Audio-78 Archival Supplies at (415) 457-7878.

&gt;Poppycock!....roflmao Now, where ever did that term originate from?

"/> It's (Anglicized) a derivative from a foreign term (French or Latin, I
think) ... papkak (pappekak) ... meaning soft dung.

Pap = soft; light or trivial reading matter ...
