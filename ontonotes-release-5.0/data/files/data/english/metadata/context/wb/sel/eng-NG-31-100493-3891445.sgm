Thats why I make sure and only have 1-2 gallons in the tank! ;-)

I am thinking about getting a locking cap for my Dak too... my truck is

would rather not distribute it for free.

I read an article today online that some manufactures, Chrysler being
mentioned, put baffles or valves in the gas filler pipe to deter people from
siphoning off gas.  Anyone know if the Durangos have this in them?

Around here (New Brunswick, Canada) they (crooks) have a new trick. They drill
your tank and drain your gas out.

Well I suppose if those jerks are going to go to that much trouble to steal
gas, there's not much that can be done.

any locking gas cap can be removed with a flathead screwdriver. anyone

Its not the "thief" that Im protecting against. They will get what ever they
want. Its simply to reduce the temptation... Plus, with a locking cap pried
off. Its harder to explain "yeah, my buddy said I could take a few gallons
from his truck"

LMAO!!!!  I'd love to see some F'in moron get fried just for stealing a
little gas.  It'd serve them right for being so completely idiotic.  Of
course I'd feel bad for the owner of the vehicle for losing it due to fire.

Don't look under Chevies or Fords because they are steel tanks. GM just
uses a plastic cover over them. Most SUVs are steel tanks as well.

no prying needed. Takes less time then using the key more often then
not. but the tether will come off with a screw and it should be easy
enough to attach it to a new cap if you cant find one. also you might
try looking for tethered caps that just fit the same, shouldnt have to
be dodge OEM.
