Astronaut wigging out in space?

Serious question:

I'm sure they have some sort of a plan already put together should an
astronaut totally wig out in space?

Even with all the screening and training, I'm sure they have to think that
there is a (very remote) possibility such a thing could happen to anyone up
there by any number of unknown mental (or more likely, physical) reasons...

Perhaps the plan is just "everyone grab him/her, hold 'em down, and tie 'em
up", or do they have syringes that they could quickly inject someone with.
(tranquilizer) ?

There have been persistent rumors over the years that at least one Salyut 7
had to be cut short due to psycological issues.

I got to work with the Russians in 1993 when we were considering buying the
Soyuz as the station "life boat".  I heard it straight from one of their
flight directors that they had to cut mission short because the astronauts
lost touch with reality.

Long-duration spaceflights with large crews (e.g., trips lasting several
years to the outer planets) are still a big unknown.  We don't know if a
large, mixed-gender crew will degenerate over several years like "Mutiny
on the Bounty" or "Lord of the Flies" or "The Caine Mutiny" or any of
the other scenarios we're already familiar with.

You're only thinking about an individual astronaut freaking out.  What
about a "love triangle," complete with jealous rages, forming *among*
three or more members of a mixed-gender spaceflight crew *during* a
long-duration mission?

I've changed my mind about building a lunar base.  I'm now thinking it
really is the only way to test out really long-duration spaceflight--put
a whole bunch of men and women on the moon for 5+ years and see how they
deal with it.  They may form a new society, just like how tribes
self-organize on the TV show "Survivor."  If things go really wrong,
rescue from Earth is only a few days away.

Yes.  In my opinion the Russians take mental health more seriously than we
do.  Read the book "Dragon Fly".  The Russians told us a perticular
astronaut was not mentally OK to fly in their station.  In training he was
showing signs of not getting allong with his crew mates.  We flew him anyway
and he had MAJOR problems with his crew.  This is a documented case of NASA
not taking mental health seriously.  Keep in mind the Russians had a LOT
more experience with long stays by a crew in space.

Why do you think they all have access to email phones private  medical
conferences etc?

The mind is complex and I'm sure they are aware of the problems.

I heard a story during the Skylab era that there were tranquiliser
injections available simply to allow someone to be brought back without
destroying the  capsule!

Mike Mullane wrote in his recent book that some of the early shuttle
Payload Specialists gave their commanders a rough time. One pretty
much went into a state of depression when his experiment didn't work
in orbit. Another apparently kept asking the mission commander about
the shuttle hatch to the point that it got the commander worried "why
are you asking about the hatch so much?" and resulted in a
recommendation that it be padlocked after the shuttle reaches orbit,
with only the CDR's knowing the key.

Imagine a shuttle docked at station....

Crewmember loses it and somehow depressurives station / ISS

No cabin air no control:(
Now we have a large sectional vehicle stuck in a eventual declining
orbit.

Can progress reboost with shuttle attached?

How long till average ISS orbit with draggy shuttle attached would re
enter?

I rather imagine structure would tumble and come apart distributing
debris all around the globe:(

Obviously a astronaut can lose it:( Screening must be poor once your
on the team.

This exact thing happened to William Shatner on at least two occaisions. In
Star Trek episodes 105 and 210 he was divided into a good Kirk and an evil
anti-Kirk. I believe this happens in space and we just have to look on the
Enterprise for the good Nowak and recombobulate her with the evil
anti-Nowak... easy

When you launch an astronaut into space wearing diapers you are asking for
trouble. What were they thinking.

NASA ignored *a lot* of the advice of the Russians during the Shuttle-Mir

I attended a few meetings on Mars missions.  We seriously talked about
possibly flying some anti-depressants, anti-mania, and anti-psychotic
medications.  With medication a wigged out astronaut could be brought back
to being functional.

Many people said things like, "Because of the way we pick astronauts, we
would never fly a person that might have difficulty to Mars."  I don't think

Quite true.  My feeling is that if you put a group of average people up
there then yes it is going to go badly, but if you put people who are
successful, screened, normal, and who make a conscious effort to put the
mission priorities over personal issues that it can work. And then luck
helps also.

Not just nuclear submarines, but Antarctic stations (which includes a
mixed gender component in the later years), various voyages of
exploration, intentional and accidental isolation, etc... etc...
There are some questions - but I'd not characterize it as a 'big
unknown'.

In short, just as he is with the PRP, Steven is fearmongering/trolling
out of his ass.

I wouldn't have said it in a meeting last week, let alone today.  Not
because of errors in psychological screening - but because the hiring
system is broken at the most basic level.  Highly competitive,
overachieving, individualistic alpha types are precisely the *wrong*
type to send on a long duration mission - but that's precisely the
kind of people the ASCAN selection process is designed to find.

Yes, I know they work in teams today - but as Micheal Collins said,
"in pursuit of a common and greatly desired goal, almost anyone can
work together for a time".  I suspect that the duration of training
for, and flying a Mars mission will exceed that time.

There were some long duration expeditions to Antarctica about a hundred
years ago.  Though everyone who went are long since gone, so the only
source of experience would be the captain's logs and crew members'
letter and diaries.

There's also long duration Navy submarine missions.  With crews and
inside space roughly comparable to what a Mars mission would look like.
Though with a sub, if a really serious problem comes up you can head
for  the nearest Navy base, which is at most a day away.

I suppose NASA could borrow a nuke submarine and do a test run of a crew
who have been selected for the Mars trip.  They need not be isolated
from the world, let them have 'net access and such they would have on
the Mars trip.  So the scientists on board can continue to publish

ROTFLMAO.

The one time we had a serious problem (we were directed to offload
someone due to a family situation he needed to attend to), it took
over a day to get from where we were to the rendezvous point.

The East coast was much further away.  (And we were in the Atlantic,

As well as valid launch codes and so forth to get past the permissive action

Future spaceships will need to be designed fail-safe.  Just like the
ICBM missile silos where it takes four men to turn keys simultaneously
to launch one missile, it's going to get to the point where a spaceship
won't be able to be destroyed by any one person *even if they try to*.

One simple measure is to require two or more crewpersons to turn keys or
enter passwords in order to enter any course correction into the
guidance system.  That way, no one crewperson can throw the spaceship
off course.  Ditto for opening an airlock--it will require simultaneous
entry of passwords by two or more crewpersons in order to open the
airlock door.

Shades of Star Trek!  We really are going to need a large crew.  It's a
lot harder for one berserk crewperson to overcome twenty others, than
for a berserk crewperson to just overcome two or or three others.

You are totally misremembering that.

The Weps has the combination to the safe holding the firing trigger,
(which is actuated for each missile in sequence). The CO holds the
keys that arm the eject system (one key per tube), and issues the
required number of key to the XO on setting 1SQ. In the inner SAS safe
is a key which is issued to the CO on verification of launch authority
by the SAS team - the CO must use this key to arm the firing circuit
from a panel in the control room.  (Said panel also allows the the CO
and XO to monitor which tubes have been released by Fire Control and
Launcher.)

All three keys must be used to launch missiles.

Interesting comments all around.

Regarding everything that NASA seems to be prudish about (which they need to
overcome) ---

This may sound silly or even nuts at first, but makes sense if you think
about it...

The long mission and sex thing:  why shouldn't the crew be composed of
couples that are sexually intimate?  Why can't they even be sexually
intimate during the mission?  Other than the risk of pregnancy, which is
overcome by pills, what harm could come of it.  I'll even go further --
maybe the couples should even be liberal with the idea of, ahem, "swinging",
should that occur..

Going even further, perhaps even take a very liberal approach to some other
things (within reason) as well.   If that means smoking a little, ahem,
marijuana occassionally -- so be it.

I'm not saying to turn the vehicle into a hippy Volkswagen "Love Bus".
Its just, it seems to me, that if you are going to send people 33+ million
miles (with a good chance they may never return), some of these things take
re-thinking...

...but even if two (Air Force) butterbars are having a bad day and decide to
nuke someone, doesn't it take a bunch of other BS to happen first --- or
otherwise they can turn the keys all day long and it won't do anything?

Such as the launch codes to propagate their way down the pecking order and
also even with if they have the launch codes, doesn't the system still
require other "yes" votes from other silos in the the same squadron?  The
smallest "independent level" is the squadron.  The silos attached to a
single squadron are spread out by miles, so that the other side can't take
them all out with a single "hole-in-one" nuke..

I'm as much asking as telling.  I seem to recall this as described once by a
missileneer..  It may even be by wing.  Replace "wing" for "squadron" above
if thats the deal.

Seems like the "squadron (wing?) vote" would be just one mode of operation
though and their would be a also mode of operation to make the individual
silos become indepenent in a scenerio where things were already getting blow
up everywhere..

Not even going to speculate on the Navy.  They are weird to begin with,
especially anyone who volunteers to go on a boat that intentionally sinks
(subs).  Seems logical that sub commanders would have the ability to become
far more independent though as a sub can get cut off the rest of the

that had nothing to do with "mental health",  just basic personality type.
Jerry Linenger was the MS in question, adn the Russians kept warning NASA
that he was too much of a "loner" to function well in an extended-duration
mission. And they were right, and he basically withdrew into his shell.

N.b. he wasn't "depressed", he didn't stop functioning, but he just kept to
himself all the time and didn't rely on all the support staff groundside to
help him with his mission objectives.

Kind of like the basic rule for Survivor: if you don't like being around

&gt;&gt; This exact thing happened to William Shatner on at least two occaisions.
&gt;&gt; In Star Trek episodes 105 and 210 he was divided into a good Kirk and an
&gt;&gt; evil anti-Kirk. I believe this happens in space and we just have to look
&gt;&gt; on the Enterprise for the good Nowak and recombobulate her with the evil
&gt;&gt; anti-Nowak... easy

&gt;&gt; When you launch an astronaut into space wearing diapers you are asking
&gt;&gt; for trouble. What were they thinking.

&gt;They were likely thinking that the alternative wasn't too pretty.

Which brings up the question: Have any astronauts crapped themselves during
launch? I bet I might...

&gt;&gt;&gt;How do you keep the commander of a nuclear missile facility from
&gt;&gt;&gt;launching?

&gt;&gt;You have a second person in the facility that also has a key.

&gt; Both of whom are armed, in the case of American launch facilities (or they
&gt; used to be, way back when I actually paid attention to such things).

&gt;&gt;It takes two
&gt;&gt;keys to launch.

What if it's the President of the USA is the one who goes nuts?  Though
I've heard that the secretary of state has to concur to launch the
nukes.  Or he forgets the password...

&gt; I got to work with the Russians in 1993 when we were considering buying the

I vaguely remember hearing something about a Skylab mission where the
commander was relieved of duty and one of the other two guys became the
new commander.  They didn't have to terminate the mission early, though.

Where the hell did you hear that one?

The third Skylab crew felt they were being overworked and went on
strike for a day, and also tried to cover up that the pilot, Bill
Pogue, got a bad bout of space-sickness early in the flight.

That may have been just what it really was then.  What I "vaguely"
remember may have been a garbled news report.  Or just a mis-remembered
comment from 30 or so years ago...
