Hey all,

I've acquired recently a few macs in good condition, but I don't
really have much use for them. Picked them up from a client who wasn't
using them and was going to throw them out (!!), saved them from death
but I've got nowhere to put them.

The macs:
Macintosh 512K - In working condition. I have a bunch of system disks,
none of which are labelled. I have the labels for them, but they're so
old that the adhesive has worn off so they've all fallen off, and I
don't know which is which. The disk drive makes the most horrid of
sounds, but appears to work fine, though I won't vouch for the safety
of any disks inserted.

Powerbook 180 - As much as I'd love to keep this guy, it just doesn't
make sense. I don't have the room in my apartment for it, and the only
useful thing I could do with it would be to load A/UX, which I don't
have. It's in good working condition, has AC adapter, but no battery.
Installed with System 7.1 as I recall, and has the latest and greatest
Netscape Navigator 2 for your web browsing pleasure... assuming you
can find some way to get it online. I'm without a localtalk-to-
ethernet adapter, so I can't do much with it for now.

Also, I have an Imagewriter that I haven't tested. It's likely older
than I am, and I haven't bothered to plug it in at all, but it might
well work as intended.

So, why am I posting? Well, I need the space in my tiny apartment. The
512K I'd like to give to a good home, someone who will appreciate it
and not just Macquarium it. The Powerbook 180 has a far slimmer chance
of that happening, but if I can find someone who'll get some use out
of it, for fun or profit, then so be it.

I live in the Vancouver (British Columbia) area; if anyone's
interested, you can let me know and come by to see them. They could be
shipped, as well, to whoever wants them, but obviously shipping a 512K
is going to be a pain, as they're rather heavy and the keyboards are
awkward.

Let me know if you're interested; failing that, let me know if you
have a localtalk-to-ethernet adaptor you're not using. ;)

Thanks,
Dan

Yeah, it'd be a bit diffucult to convert a PowerBook
into a fish tank. &lt;ducks and runs&gt;

You're skating on thin ice, I think - you know what the nannies can
be like.

my neighbor who had a macII long ago had
a fish tank screen saver. i thought i heard
something later that people got into it and
made their own fish designs and some people
even put in ecology simulations, and stuff.

but it would be hard to do black and white.

180 does i believe have 68040LC so it could run 8.1.
I have a 520c and a 540c both run 8.1 and I use the 540c quite a bit
-- it has a 32MB ram card and a
500mB hd (and one good battery that cost me $50).

I used to use the 520 more when i was newer to macs -- it replaced my
165c. it only has 20 ram
and 250 hd and runs cpu 25mhz not 33.

these are still my fav macs.
