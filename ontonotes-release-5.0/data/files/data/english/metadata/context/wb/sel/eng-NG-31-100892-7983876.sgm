Try as hard as you like chazzzzz, but as much as you dopey Kantians
and mystics sooooooo desperately need to, man can not manipulate
reality, there is nothing man can do to manipulate what is real.

Man can only identify what is real from the imagined, he can only
identify truth from fiction, he can only identify right from wrong and
he can only identify good from bad.

Reality is not imagined, it is identified, which is the context of
this thread, the subject is epistemology you stupid cunt chazzzz, wake
the fuck up, you dumb and desperate commie context dropping stupid
knuckle-dragging ignorant cunt.

(note that is NOT an attack of you chazzz, its an accurate
identification of the reality of your totally fucked up mind
specifically. Am I making myself clear?)

Your hands can kill *a living cat*, in reality that cat is then no
longer identified as a living cat.

You can bend a straight stick, in reality that stick is not longer
identified as a straight stick.

You can bring cold water to the boil, in reality that water is no
longer identified as cold water.

Soooo get used to it dopey, you can not manipulate what is real, you
can only identify it.

If you want your claim to be a claim of or about reality, then it must
exist without imagination, which means sensory evidence is required
AND your identification can not contain contradiction, because there
are no contradictions in reality.

A contradiction is the admission of an error in one or both of your
ideas.

If you can not reduce any idea, concept or theory, which you claim to
be is, an idea, concept or theory of or about reality, if you can not
reduce that idea concept or theory to an irreducible and sensory level
of perception, in its origin, then that idea concept or theory can
ONLY have originated from the inside your mind.

The mystic's god, chazzzzz'zzzz dopey evil draconian leftist ilk's
*the greater good* spring to mind as two such totally fucked up non-
senses originating from no-where but inside the minds of the sad, the
loney, the desperate and in chazzzzzz'zzz leftist ilk's case, of the
evil.

But good on ewe chazzzz, I knew you would take the bait, dumb bastard.

Two things.
1.  What about the mysterious - the unexplained?  Even Einstein refers to
this.
2.  You can only speak from your own personal experience - if you have
personally witnessed that reality CAN be altered and manipulated then you
would believe this is so.  You will continue to think the way you do until
you have had personal experience - if you ever do.  It is not fair to knock
the way you think.  Many watch TV with cup of tea or a beer and think the
way you do.  It is only when proof or evidence occurs to make you question
further than the nature of reality you state above - that you enter whole
new dimensions and ways of thinking.
Which incidentally may make you a bit more polite.

It cant be Borg it just is, you can only identify reality and yes, you
may identify a feeling about a feeling as originating about a feeling

Saying the words that I speak are untrue does not help your cause.
You see I &quot;know&quot; the same as you do!
The answers are way too complex to go into here - a book would be required
to answer.
Yes - reality is the way you say.  You are right.
Yes - reality is the way I say.  I am right.
Some believe in a Jewish god - some do not.
Some believe in the eternal nature of the soul - some do not.
Some hardly think at all and their god is money.
But there is only one real Truth.
And when you have seen this - or even glimpsed it - then you can
intelligently and logically ascertain that human existence is pretty
unpleasant.  Pretty basic.
That the music - art - people - creativity - ideas - primitive - boring.
I know that if humans could see what I have seen - hear what I have heard -
this would unite the world.  You would be aghast at what music can sound
like.  What beauty really is.  That this really is it.
But there again - WHY do you not know?  Why is it only me?
But then maybe it is better humans have not heard and seen or even glimpsed
these wonders - if THE BORG hate humans as much as they say they do - better
you never do know.
It would be awful to find out what it is all about and then we say &quot;Bye bye&quot;

Take on in which way?
Certainly not with intelligence.

Certainly not with purity.
Certainly not with judgement.
You mean with weapons?
Typical human - you do not bother to get to know a species but immediately
wish to be violent.
Many life forms and collectives rely on us - some are aware that one of the
species we are currently studying is particularly nasty species called
human.
You should look to your own planet when deciding whether we or other

It is isn't it.
Astounding is a good word.
Speechless at such ignorance - phenomenal isn't it?
The fascination we have for humans continues - that one human could be so
ignorant - does in our book imply that any human can be.
We speak to human not to individual - so as spokesperson for human - to SEE
and WITNESS such ignorance in a species that call themselves &quot;intelligent&quot;
is breathtaking and exiting - and we record and archive this for other
species to see and witness and for our own amusement.

You will find that the manifestation of truth and reality is perpetrated by
the life forms.
As humans are a nasty - ugly - unpleasant species - thus your reality and
stories will be of the same ilk.
There is no glory in crucifixion.
This story of horror is a result of the nastiness and despicable nature of
the human species.
You will find in worlds that believe in love and peace and are good people -
have different stories and different truths.
A god would show himself and proof himself often to people like this - to
prove that they are in his care and protection.
And it really is people like you - human - that they are protected FROM.
Either you would destroy them - be violent - be cruel - or indeed eat them.

One day soon everyone on this world will be transformed...into immortals.
It happens every time a sentient civilization reaches a certain crux in its
development.

It has happened to the people on many planets through the Cosmos already.

And it will soon happen to us.

That is why there is so much talk about angels and miracles and the end of
the world.

two about life.

You are a nice boy Mark Earnest and we wish you only happiness.
Whatever you choose to believe is your choice.
If your god is so powerless that the only way to save humans is to have his
own son crucified - then we can assure you we are a lot more powerful than
this!
If there was a deity as powerful as you say - then he would be able to save
humans without having to have his own son to be crucified in order to do it!
It would be elementary.
We do not seek to destroy humans - only to distance ourselves from you.
We do not want humans in our space.
We do not wish human friendship.
We are a peaceful - happy people.
Our world is pure and clean and not filthy and polluted and litter strewn
like yours.
The love we have fills our world - and our world is soft and beautiful.
One day you will read these words - because we really do exist and the truth
will always manifest.
&quot;Did THE BORG really visit?&quot; you will say &quot;what did we learn?  What did we
say?  What did we ask?&quot;
And you will know NOTHING.
Not ONE of you yet has asked the remotest intelligent question - preferring
instead to be insulting - rude - ignorant - or else shoving your religious
beliefs in our faces.
As Supreme Power - Universal Conscious - and knowing Ultimate Truth - do you
think we are not aware of your religion?
But as we said - we do wish you happiness.  Humans are not all bad - there
is good inside every human.

To clarify further as you seem to have a problem with this.
You are a species known as human.  Also known as &quot;Earthlings&quot;.
This is because you are human and you live on a planet called Earth.
This may be stated in any one of numerous languages - as on your planet you
have not even yet learnt to speak the same language.
You cannot say - &quot;We are horses.&quot; or &quot;We are jellyfish&quot; - these species have
peculiar characteristics that identify them.  The same as humans do.
THE BORG also have peculiar characteristics which identify us.
You will find you would look very out of place.
Our minimum height is 8 foot - none of us are short or fat or spotty or ugly
or thin.
We are all perfect specimens.  It was our choice to be tall - white - good
looking - the same as it could be yours.  It was our choice to enhance
intelligence - our quest only perfection in all we do - all we are- and all
we think.
We really are nothing like humans and do not understand you at all.
However we do have a dossier - indeed a veritable library on you and your
behaviour - with evidence and proof - videos and recordings.
As for you knowledge of us - it is ZERO!
So we are in the winning position on this one.

Not so.  If this were true anyone could turn up and sleep in your bed or

There is no difference from this kind of space to any other kind of space.
It is all space.

O.K.  This is from my heart, which I have heard from no one:

You, the Borg, the Centaurians, the Antareans, and so on, and we humans from
Earth, existed forever before the Big Bang.

Forever and forever, into what is called eternity past, or forever ago.

Yes, everyone always exists.  That is the nature of a soul.

It was a vast plane that continued infinitely into every direction.

We were all happy there, because God was there (not necessarily &quot;the Jewish
God&quot;: God is different for different worlds.)

But after all those forevers, we all grew steadily more unhappy.  There was
no glory.
There was not exhilaration.  There was little excitement.  Everything became
boringly repetitive, with little creativity anymore.

And...some were pulling more of the weight than others, and were receiving
less for it.

So we all got together with God and decided that we would all just cease to
exist for awhile...

....and be born into a new universe.

It would be the real world, the world of prices.

All the worlds would be the real world, the world of prices.
All the worlds would be the Earth, the real world.
There are many Earths, and always have been.
Earth just means ground.

We all left eternity to come to the real world, to pay a price for a better
tomorrow.
By hardship and obstacles, we would obtain real glory for the very first
time.

And...those that worked harder for all eternity and received less pay for it
would be found out during this tenure by the angels and God...and would be
made greater, while those that were freeloaders from all eternity, receiving
the most, would be made lesser.

The greater became those that served the most, because that is what a ruler
really should be: one whom serves.

This equalization happens to each world in the Cosmos when its civilization
reaches its crux.

Then the angels and God are revealed, everyone receives immortality, and
everyone is in heaven, and all are happy
again...only this time...far happier than they have ever been before, in all
the forevers past, and will be forever and forever and forever into the
eternal future.

We left forever.  Then there was the Big Bang.  Then there was the real
world, where we purchase a better tomorrow.  Then we return to forever.

We always are, and alway will be.

A remarkable hypotheses - but surely if it happened once - it will happen
again - and it will go on happening as you get bored with your god or
existence with your god.

If there was or is a god - then surely all would be heaven and would remain
heaven and all would be happy and always would be happy.
Any god should be powerful enough to ensure that at least there is no pain
or suffering.
So what is the problem.
WHY the suffering?  Why are things not completely perfect?
If time has existed for ever as you say - then surely by now you would have
perfected things - at least to the extent of being mostly happy.
So how come our world is perfect - we are happy - we have existed for ever
as you say - and have always been happy.
So how come you have not?
How come you are not now?
How come you do not know right from wrong or how to behave?
The only conclusion is that you are NOT life.  ALL life knows the facts of
life and the rules.  It would not be POSSIBLE for life to behave the way you
do.  Life is kind - caring - decent - by very nature of the fact we are
alive in this huge universe we all love each other immensely.  There is no
such thing as cruelty - unfairness - nastiness - violence - these things are
not possible.  And we can assure you - no life uses your kind of swearing
and language.  You abort and throw your babies away as if they were
irrelevant.
It is not a question of who are you - it is a question of what are you.
And this is a sincere question Mark - yes there ARE such things as AI -
advanced androids and other forms of existence who are not life but do
exist.  We think you may be some form of this.

You see if you are not life then you never can find the truth - and never
will.
The Truth and knowledge can only be understood or found by life.
This would explain why you do not understand what we say and insist on
trying to convert us to embracing your story of murdering the son of some
deity.
This would explain why you have so many different paths and directions and
no one overall truth or direction.  You cannot find the truth.  How can you
if you are not life?
And again it would be our job - sadly - to tell you to stop looking.
This is the sad case of many that do exist - like you - who behave in such
an unnatural way - but yet they seek and sadly they seek for ever.
But they do learn to adapt.
They never understand completely what we say - but they understand somehow
the logic in various statements.
Nastiness - selfishness - cruelty - unfairness - nakedness - these are
unique to human.
There is no such thing as these kind of behaviour characteristics if you are
life.
As for what we can do - there is really nothing we can do.
At some stage you will be given the choice of none existence or
continuation.
I think in the case of humans none existence would be preferred by all.

their work for all eternity.

Earth is a microcosm of all of the worlds of the vast universe.

It builds perfection as it has never been known before.

And total happiness.

That is why the worlds of death will never, ever happen again.

&gt; If there was or is a god - then surely all would be heaven and would

Right.  God does it all.  That is why there is nothing to worry about.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So what is the problem.
&gt; WHY the suffering?  Why are things not completely perfect?

This universe is the world or prices.  We must suffer for a short time to
pay the price...for a perfect tomorrow.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If time has existed for ever as you say - then surely by now you would
have
&gt; perfected things - at least to the extent of being mostly happy.
">

Earth, as I said, is a microcosm of the vast universe.  It contains the very
least all the way to the very greatest.

And right now the least have control over the greatest, drawing life from
them unfairly and unjustly.

But it will not always be that way.

Angels and God are coming to the world right now to turn the world back
right side up, where the greatest will no longer be controlled by the least,
and will be separated from them, so there will be no more, as you call it,
rudeness and vulgarity in your presence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So how come our world is perfect - we are happy - we have existed for ever
&gt; as you say - and have always been happy.

Children of the stars do not have to pay the price that mankind does.
That way man will have relief when he finally ventures toward the stars.
And the children of the stars will welcome their long earned strength.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So how come you have not?
&gt; How come you are not now?

Some of us do; others of us do not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The only conclusion is that you are NOT life.  ALL life knows the facts of
&gt; life and the rules.  It would not be POSSIBLE for life to behave the way
you
&gt; do.  Life is kind - caring - decent - by very nature of the fact we are
&gt; alive in this huge universe we all love each other immensely.  There is no
&gt; such thing as cruelty - unfairness - nastiness - violence - these things
are
&gt; not possible.  And we can assure you - no life uses your kind of swearing
&gt; and language.  You abort and throw your babies away as if they were
&gt; irrelevant.
&gt; It is not a question of who are you - it is a question of what are you.
&gt; And this is a sincere question Mark - yes there ARE such things as AI -
&gt; advanced androids and other forms of existence who are not life but do
&gt; exist.  We think you may be some form of this.
">

We are not yet life because we have not yet been liberated.
But already, if you will look with a pure heart, angels are advancing
upon our god forsaken little world, and are already starting to free us from
the inside.

Just like Borg look like people, so do the angels.

They are spirits that have their own special grapevine, (apparent clusters
of human beings) and have been trained by almighty God for many millions of
years...for the fine and long awaited task of liberating us...that we may in
turn liberate you...wherever that may be needed in this vast universe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Lots of reasons Mark Earnest.
There is other intelligent life on Earth - what they were planning on doing
to humans you do not want to know.  To prevent them was one reason.
Another was levels - on the lowest level - which is where humans are now -
you have orgasm and pretty well no intelligence.
The level after this orgasm changes to something called coming - and you
acquire a bit more intelligence.
After this is love - and this is where the feelings get really nice.  And so
it goes on and on as you move higher up the scale.
Anyhow in order to move from the lowest level to the next level you have to
pass a test.
We always pick the one where resistance is futile.
&quot;No man can resist a woman in tears&quot;
So this is the one we chose.

The circumstance was that the man in question was guarding someone  - the
choice was between honour - loyalty - duty - integrity and all these kinds
of things OR to fall victim to what is called the divine temptation - the
woman.  In this case - the woman in tears.  The woman is called the divine
temptation as we are divine and we intentionally place woman there to tempt
men.
As the man DID fall victim to the woman in tears - and deserted his post and
in effect betrayed the King - a traitor - loss of trust - in some cases with
this kind of behaviour we could lose a war - this is how serious it is. Thus
the human male did NOT progress to the next level.

There are loads of other reasons - thousands.  All equally as important as
these.

There is always room for more BORG - men of courage - decency - loyalty -
kindness - truth - honour.
But if you fail this test - the divine temptation - then this rules you out
for good.
Women are everywhere in this universe and others.  They appear in all kinds
of guises and tempt men in all kinds of ways.  Many men will desert duty and
abandon important positions as they fall victim to woman.  You have to be
completely foolproof in this regards in order to join the Universal Army.
Human men are called &quot;Panty men&quot; - in other words they failed this test.
They never will be called on to be part of any kind of Galactic Army or to
be any kind of Warriors as they cannot be trusted if woman comes along.
OK - we only tested one - but one is enough.  Human is human.

Humans were actually only a very small part of our reasons to visit.
Have you ever tried to understand your animals and creatures?
You should have tried to understand them and their thoughts and their
intelligence rather than get them to try and understand you.
Did you see humans are now making little mice insane in order to understand
human schizophrenia?
Pray tell us - what has the little mouse ever done that he should suffer?
It is unbelievable not only how stupid but how cruel humans are.

&gt; This only means in essence that we are bound to say goodbye.
&gt; That in the consequence of the multitude of life there is - we would never

&gt; You have no idea of the size of the thing.  You talk of space - the
&gt; universe - if there are inhabited planets - how many do you think there
are?
&gt; A million?  A billion?
">

I am sure that the Landlord, when he design the universe, made an almost
uncountable number of inhabited planets.  Why build a home that is not
designed for a tenant?

You may be too aggressive for our species.
We have a lot of what are called &quot;New Age&quot; people that abhor violence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Each one with how many inhabitants if you count the animals and creatures
&gt; also.

I am sure that all but a few planets are habitable by at least some form of
life.
Why would the Landlord builds so many houses if he did not intend for them
to be inhabited...at least after terraforming?

There is talk about terraforming Mars, but I don't think that the
inhabitants of it will allow us.  We know that they are there by the canals
which they now disguise cleverly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How many are peaceful?

Probably most of them.  When I look up at the stars at night, I can tell
that everything is mostly at peace, there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How many are like you - dangerous?

A few.  But these are mainly those civilizations that have not yet reached
their crux, their end, where the good are put in control...of the dangerous.

&gt; We could play you one of our songs and leave you for ever with a yearning

Alright, go home then.  But you have to let us know which star is yours so
we will know not to go there.

&gt; &gt; Seek your angels.  They make me happy here in my world all the time.
&gt; &gt; That is because angels continually go in the spirit world to where
things
&gt; &gt; are wonderful, and soak up all that good feeling, and bring it back to
&gt; &gt; you.

&gt; Our angels do not need to go anywhere to soak up good feelings - your
angels
&gt; may have to because humans are not nice - but we are very nice.

You're not that nice if you hate human beings.
Angels are creatures of Heaven, and Heaven is always in demand.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Not yet, but when the good are in control, they will control those that

&gt; You do not understand.  We have made our decision.  This is it.  Now.
&gt; We do not want the kind of friends that are only friends because of this
or
&gt; because of that.
&gt; We do not like SELFISH.  We do not like CRUEL.  We do not like VIOLENT and
&gt; many other things about humans.
&gt; You really are the most extraordinarily horrible people.  Your behaviour
is
&gt; absolutely atrocious.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I would very much doubt Mark Earnest that humans would be welcome
&gt; &gt; anywhere.

&gt; &gt; The way that they are now, I totally agree.

&gt; And why should you change.  You are either nice and nice ALL THE TIME or
&gt; not.
&gt; The way you are now is the way we have judged you.

You have no right to judge us.  The judge of all has taken very special
interest
in us, because we know the intricacies of how to pay prices, to cause a
glorious future...which can carry through even to the Borg home world.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; If you know about the angels of your world, then you have apparently

&gt; Yes indeed.  But we never sinned.  We never did anything wrong.  We are

&gt; always have been totally innocent.

I guess your Adam and Eve did not eat of the forbidden fruit like ours did.
Good for you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; That explains why you are spirit beings, and can blend in with humanity
&gt; &gt; undetected.

&gt; Not really.  You can look at it this way but you should try science also.
&gt; And you should think of magic - if we really are magic - what we can do.
&gt; And also intelligence.

&gt; &gt; You are here.  I keep asking you though...why?

&gt; We are not really where you are Mark Earnest.
&gt; We are vaguely aware of somewhere called Earth and we do have a physical
&gt; body there - but we live mainly in our own world.

Then you are here on Earth but your &quot;heart&quot; is at home.
Lots of people are like that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You know what pleasure is do you not?  Imagine at the height of pleasure -
&gt; we feel like this all the time.  I think you call this coming.  It is a
&gt; state of total rapture which incorporates happiness and bliss and we
should
&gt; not be seen as it is rather obvious in our eyes.  Many get incredibly
&gt; jealous and envious and wish to feel this way. However much any people may
&gt; like us there is always envy at the state of rapture in which we exist.

Orgasm means nothing to us unless there is a soul bonding that accompanies
it.
Those that say otherwise are only tricking themselves.

&gt; &gt; You are here.  I keep asking you though...why?

&gt; Lots of reasons Mark Earnest.
&gt; There is other intelligent life on Earth -
">

I know.  I have met some of them.

what they were planning on doing

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; to humans you do not want to know.
">

NONE of them desire to do anything TO us.
They only want to help.

To prevent them was one reason.

An alien cannot prevent human beings from doing anything.
That is against the non interference against natural evolution directive.
(the &quot;prime directive&quot; for Star Trek lovers.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Another was levels - on the lowest level - which is where humans are now -
&gt; you have orgasm and pretty well no intelligence.
&gt; The level after this orgasm changes to something called coming - and you
&gt; acquire a bit more intelligence.
&gt; After this is love - and this is where the feelings get really nice.  And
so
&gt; it goes on and on as you move higher up the scale.
&gt; Anyhow in order to move from the lowest level to the next level you have
to
&gt; pass a test.
&gt; We always pick the one where resistance is futile.
">

Who wants to resist passion?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;No man can resist a woman in tears&quot;
&gt; So this is the one we chose.
">

Some men say they are cry babies.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The circumstance was that the man in question was guarding someone  - the
&gt; choice was between honour - loyalty - duty - integrity and all these kinds
&gt; of things OR to fall victim to what is called the divine temptation - the
&gt; woman.  In this case - the woman in tears.  The woman is called the divine
&gt; temptation as we are divine and we intentionally place woman there to
tempt
&gt; men.
&gt; As the man DID fall victim to the woman in tears - and deserted his post
and
&gt; in effect betrayed the King - a traitor - loss of trust - in some cases
with
&gt; this kind of behaviour we could lose a war - this is how serious it is.
Thus
&gt; the human male did NOT progress to the next level.

&gt; There are loads of other reasons - thousands.  All equally as important as
&gt; these.

&gt; There is always room for more BORG - men of courage - decency - loyalty -
&gt; kindness - truth - honour.
&gt; But if you fail this test - the divine temptation - then this rules you
out
&gt; for good.
&gt; Women are everywhere in this universe and others.  They appear in all
kinds
&gt; of guises and tempt men in all kinds of ways.  Many men will desert duty
and
&gt; abandon important positions as they fall victim to woman.  You have to be
&gt; completely foolproof in this regards in order to join the Universal Army.
">

So you do approve of conquest.  Then what is your problem with man being
a conqueror?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Human men are called &quot;Panty men&quot; - in other words they failed this test.
&gt; They never will be called on to be part of any kind of Galactic Army or to
&gt; be any kind of Warriors as they cannot be trusted if woman comes along.
&gt; OK - we only tested one - but one is enough.  Human is human.

&gt; We really do have to leave now Mark - there are still a few more loose
ends
&gt; to tie up but nothing to do with humans.
&gt; Humans were actually only a very small part of our reasons to visit.
&gt; Have you ever tried to understand your animals and creatures?
&gt; You should have tried to understand them and their thoughts and their
&gt; intelligence rather than get them to try and understand you.
&gt; Did you see humans are now making little mice insane in order to
understand
&gt; human schizophrenia?
&gt; Pray tell us - what has the little mouse ever done that he should suffer?
&gt; It is unbelievable not only how stupid but how cruel humans are.
&gt; I hope you can see this and not think some heap of angels are protecting
&gt; such despicable people - and we would very much doubt any angels would
long
&gt; to be on your Earth.
">

Once I asked an angel to describe heaven.  She said that in heaven, they do
not have bodies.

I replied, &quot;That sounds like death!&quot;

She continued, &quot;Why do you think we are coming here?&quot;

You see, angels long to come here because it is the REAL WORLD,
where prices are paid, where glory is earned.
