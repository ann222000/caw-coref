Deuteronomy, chapter 11
26: Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;
27: A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD** your God, which I
command you this day:
28: And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God,
but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after
other gods, which ye have not known.
29: And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in
unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the
blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.
30: Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth
down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over
against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?
31: For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the
LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.
32: And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set
before you this day.
1: These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the
land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the
days that ye live upon the earth.
2: Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye
shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the
hills, and under every green tree:
3: And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn
their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their
gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.
4: Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.
5: But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your
tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and
thither thou shalt come:
6: And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and
your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your
freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:
7: And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in
all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy
God hath blessed thee.
8: Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man
whatsoever is right in his own eyes.
9: For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the
LORD your God giveth you.
10: But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your
God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies
round about, so that ye dwell in safety;
11: Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to
cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command
you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave
offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:
12: And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and
your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite
that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with
you.
13: Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every
place that thou seest:
14: But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there
thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I
command thee.
15: Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates,
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy
God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as
of the roebuck, and as of the hart.
16: Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as
water.
17: Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy
wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any
of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering
of thine hand:
18: But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the
LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy
manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates:
and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest
thine hands unto.
19: Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou
livest upon the earth.
20: When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised
thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat
flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.
21: If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be
too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which
the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in
thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.
22: Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the
unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.
23: Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and
thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.
24: Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.
25: Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy
children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of
the LORD.
26: Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and
go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:
27: And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon
the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be
poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.
28: Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go
well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest
that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.
29: When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee,
whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest
in their land;
30: Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after
that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after
their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I
do likewise.
31: Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the
LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons
and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.
32: What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add
thereto, nor diminish from it.
1: If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth
thee a sign or a wonder,
2: And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee,
saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us
serve them;
3: Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of
dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD
your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
4: Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his
commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto
him.
5: And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death;
because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which
brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of
bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee
to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.
6: If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or
the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice
thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not
known, thou, nor thy fathers;
7: Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto
thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the
other end of the earth;
8: Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall
thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal
him:
9: But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put
him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
10: And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath
sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of
the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
11: And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such
wickedness as this is among you.
12: If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God hath
given thee to dwell there, saying,
13: Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and
have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve
other gods, which ye have not known;
14: Then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and,
behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is
wrought among you;
15: Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of
the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle
thereof, with the edge of the sword.
16: And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street
thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every
whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not
be built again.
17: And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that
the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and
have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy
fathers;
18: When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all
his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in
the eyes of the LORD thy God.
1: Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves,
nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
2: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath
chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that
are upon the earth.
3: Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.
4: These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,
5: The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and
the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.
6: And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two
claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat.
7: Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them
that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for
they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto
you.
8: And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it
is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead
carcase.
9: These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and
scales shall ye eat:
10: And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean
unto you.
11: Of all clean birds ye shall eat.
12: But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and ossifrage,
and the ospray,
13: And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,
14: And every raven after his kind,
15: And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his
kind,
16: The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,
17: And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,
18: And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the
bat.
19: And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they shall not
be eaten.
20: But of all clean fowls ye may eat.
21: Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it
unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest
sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God.
Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
22: Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field
bringeth forth year by year.
23: And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall
choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of
thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou
mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.
24: And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry
it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall
choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:
25: Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand,
and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose:
26: And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after,
for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever
thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and
thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,
27: And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for
he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.
28: At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine
increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:
29: And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and
the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates,
shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless
thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.
1: At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.
2: And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth ought
unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour,
or of his brother; because it is called the LORD's release.
3: Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with
thy brother thine hand shall release;
4: Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly
bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance
to possess it:
5: Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to
observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.
6: For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt
lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over
many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.
7: If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy
gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden
thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:
8: But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him
sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.
9: Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The
seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against
thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD
against thee, and it be sin unto thee.
10: Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when
thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall
bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.
11: For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command
thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor,
and to thy needy, in thy land.
12: And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman , be sold unto
thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him
go free from thee.
13: And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go
away empty:
14: Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor,
and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed
thee thou shalt give unto him.
15: And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt,
and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to
day.
16: And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee;
because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;
17: Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the
door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant
thou shalt do likewise.
18: It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from
thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving thee
six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.
19: All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou
shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the
firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.
20: Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place
which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.
21: And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have
any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God.
22: Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person
shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.
23: Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the
ground as water.
1: Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God:
for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by
night.
2: Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the
flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his
name there.
3: Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat
unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest
forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day
when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.
4: And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast
seven days; neither shall there anything of the flesh, which thou
sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.
5: Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the
LORD thy God giveth thee:
6: But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name
in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of
the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.
7: And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall
choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.
8: Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be
a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work therein.
9: Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks
from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn.
10: And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a
tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto the
LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:
11: And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and
thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that
is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow,
that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place
his name there.
12: And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou
shalt observe and do these statutes.
13: Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou
hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:
14: And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy
daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the
stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.
15: Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the
place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee
in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou
shalt surely rejoice.
16: Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God
in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in
the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not
appear before the LORD empty:
17: Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the
LORD thy God which he hath given thee.
(Haftarah)
Isaiah 54:11-55:5
11: O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will
lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.
12: And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and
all thy borders of pleasant stones.
13: And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the
peace of thy children.
14: In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from
oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come
near thee.
15: Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever
shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.
16: Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and
that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the
waster to destroy.
17: No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue
that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the
heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me,
saith the LORD.
1: Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no
money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and
without price.
2: Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour
for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that
which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
3: Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I
will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
4: Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and
commander to the people.
5: Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that
knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the
Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.
