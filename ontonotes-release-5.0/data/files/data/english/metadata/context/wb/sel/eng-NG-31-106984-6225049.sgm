What are the rights of ODSP recipients concerning ending our ODSP
benefits? Is it possible to simply withdraw from the program once we
have been beneficiaries for a long time? I would rather eat crumbs
than be treated the way I have been treated by their staff. Anybody
know what my next move is if I no longer wish to participate? And if
anyone knows where I might join something so I could have some
benefits, I'd really appreciate the insight. If I try to withdraw,
with their lame mentality, thinking that everyone is sneaky and is
trying to pull one over on them, they'll probably think I have
something to hide WHICH I DO NOT. I simply resent being scrutinized
and having half of what I make at my little part-time job which I am
reporting, taken by them. PLEASE help. Thank you.

Remember the old saying, "Half a Loaf is Better than None."

ODSP is considered the LAST RESORT. (CPP-D is harder to get, pays less
and is far more restrictive vis-a-vis 'earnings'.)

Yes, with a single key-stroke on a terminal, they can disrupt your
life.

But remember, we OUTNUMBER them by about 800 to 1 - you have vastly
far more "spare time" to file complaints with the Ministry, the Media,
MPPs, political parties, the Ombudsman, etc and etc. Always DEMAND an
internal review. Always pursue things to the SBT.

I have a simple rule - if they try to give me grief, I ensure that
they are paid back TENFOLD. (It starts with my sudden LOUD arrival
upon their doorstep.)

They exist FOR US, not the other way around.

'Fix" your problem, rather than be "driven away".

But if you want, simply ignore them - they'll first suspend your
benefits and then finally disqualify you.

I've been thinking about that myself...waiting for my big Readers
Digest lottery win and wondering what I'll do with my life when/if I
have $$$$$$. It does seem like there's no way out of this ODSP/OW
system, not even death!
First call would be to my bank telling them to refuse anymore
deposits from Min.Com.Soc. and I'd change my bank account #, then I'd
write to ODSP and simply tell them I no longer wish to recieve ODSP
and have put a stop on all deposits. Â At least that way they couldn't
nab me for overpayments.
I wouldn't give them a reason.
I remember someone named Bette posting here awhile back saying she'd
tried to get an adult dependant removed and had written and told them
to remove him cause she didn't want to endure the stress they'd been
put through with an elder sibling, and they wouldn't remove him,
instead they argued and bickered among themselves about whether he
should or should not be in the system.
