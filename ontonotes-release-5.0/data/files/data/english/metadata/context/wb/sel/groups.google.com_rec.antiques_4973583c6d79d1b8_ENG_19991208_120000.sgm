I know a lot of RA's sell on ebay. But how many are regular buyers?

I just started the buying part of the game and I am p*ssed! I have, so far,
received 11 of the 22 items I bought over the last month. Of the 11 I
received, 2 were cracked, 3 were chipped, &amp; 1 suffered from an obvious &amp;
badly done repair. None of these defects were described when these items
were offered. In fact, these items were described as in &quot;very good&quot; or
&quot;excellent condition.&quot;&amp; the photos sure didn't show the damage.

None of these defects could have happened in shipping. The cracks had old
dirt in them, as did the chips. Good fairies do not attempt repairs to
pottery bookends in transit.

All of these items were relatively inexpensive items that I felt would, by
their nature, do better in my shop, in my local, than they were doing on
ebay. Needless to say, damage negates that.

So far, I have complained only to two of the sellers &amp; they both offered to
refund my money in full. That is commendable. But there was no word of
explanation about how the sale &amp; shipping of damaged goods took place in the
first place.

I sell over ebay, through a friend, &amp; we are scrupulous in our inspection &amp;
description. Is it too much to expect others to be? Do they just figure that
enough people will &quot;let it go&quot; if it's inexpensive to pay for the refunds
for those that complain.

The rest of the damaged items, I received just today. I guess that's what
really churned my spleen......three out of the four items I received today
were damaged (again, I repeat, not in transit) I have emailed the sellers.
I suppose they will offer to make it right.

But I just don't understand why it should be necessary!!!!!Is this happening
to others also, or is it just me? Gosh, I used to like to open
packages......

I generally sell, and I always check very carefully to make sure there
isn't any damage, but I know that some sellers don't. I buy on eBay
around the holidays for presents when I spot something going cheap. My
wife collects bells, and I bought a Fenton bell for her about ten days
ago (I know it doesn't fit in the FAQ, but it's just being used as an
example, not as a topic for discussion) which was described as in
excellent condition. The original glass clapper was missing, and a
crude metal clapper was attached inside with what looked like a bent
paper clip. The seller agreed to refund my money, but I stopped bidding
on bells when I got a couple I thought my wife would like, and I don't
think I could reliably get another one by Christmas now. This seller
has no negatives, and as he is returning my money, I can't really
justify giving him one either, but it certainly did irritate me to no
end.

Donna, I have my share of problems buying online. My one gripe is ,sellers
do not understand the term Mint when describing glass. Mint , in my opinion
, means straight from the factory ..never been used condition. That means no
flea bites, chips , or hairline cracks under UV. They use that term too
loosely. Knowing this, I do email the seller with my list of questions
before I bid, but I've had at least a dozen problems with damage of some
sort after auction. I've had packages come here that are wrapped for an
earthquake....wrapped in bubble, double boxed, in peanuts. Damage did not
happen in the handling, it's only their lack of keen observation.
Buying in shops or at auction are the ideal. I can take pieces outside in
bright sun light. I know what I'm buying and have no surprises. Why I
continue to buy fragile items from a photo , I do not know....! (I'm
addicted).

Richard,
None of my rotten apples had any appreciable bad feed back either. And if
they make it right how do you justify giving one? Yet if they are sending
this stuff out deliberately, knowing that they will get by with a percentage
of it, shouldn't somebody howl loudly &amp; clearly?
I was foolish enough to be impressed by the first full refund &amp; actually
sent in a positive because the seller resolved in my favor. Duh!!!!! in
retrospect.
What are you going to do about your bell? Send no feedback at all?
Somehow or other, a neutral feedback doesn't do it for me. I feel anything
but neutral!!!!

Donna, I really don't know. His story was that he didn't sell Fenton as
a rule, and he didn't know what the clapper was supposed to look like.
I looked at his auctions, and most of them were old fishing lures, so I
guess it's just barely possible, but the paperclip part makes me doubt
it a bit. It's just that I have a bit of a problem assuming that he's
doing this to other people with no real proof. He could just be unaware
of what he's doing on this one auction, and doing a better job on his
main stock in trade. I'm not sure I believe that, but it's possible. I
must admit I'd feel very funny demanding and getting a refund, then
giving someone a negative anyway. If it had happened to me as many
times as its happened to you, I'd probably feel different.

Truth is, Richard, I don't think I could get the refund &amp; then give a
negative either. Maybe the negative should be saved for attitudes &amp; no
responses.
Anyhow, I feel a little better now that I've blown off about it.

&quot;After all, it's in excellent condition for its age.&quot;

One of my two negatives is from a woman who sent me cracked (with stains)
Minton china, agreed to accept a return, then accused me of swapping her
&quot;good&quot; pieces out for the cracked and stained ones she got back.

I got mail from a bunch of &quot;how dare you give *her* a negative&quot; folks,
presumably friends and family, when I negged that seller in return.
Later, another buyer wrote to me and said the seller was trying the same
you-switched-it tactics with her.

As a seller I offer a moneyback guarantee for any reason whatsoever, including
buyer's remorse. I just had one customer return a piece of silver because it
wasn't shiny enough, which I guess is one of the hazards of offering a
guarantee...people will use it occasionally for the silliest of reasons.
But overall I think it's a good business practice and will continue to use it.

I'd like to hear some opinions on the feedback issue. IMO, buyer feedback
should be given as soon as the money is in the sellers wallet. Which is
usually within days in my buyer transactions. My part of the auction
agreement is over. The seller was satisfied with money . In the times I've
been bidder, the seller waits till they see my feedback to send theirs. The
seller debate says that the transaction isn't over to qualify feedback from
the seller, until all parties are finished with the transaction.. I honored
my part of the bargain with cold hard cash or postal MO. The seller is now
benefiting from my transaction. Sellers should give positive feedback upon
money given in a timely fashion. If you disagree, please give me a reason to
understand your reasoning....besides paranoia that you may get bad feedback
first. If it makes sense, I will gladly change my opinion.
BTW, I buy from another online auction that specializes in glass and seller
feedback is usually given first. Only on Ebay does this happen where
feedback is withheld by a seller.

I always leave feedback as soon as I ship the merchandise. I've found I
get a greater percentage of my customers bothering to leave feedback if
they know I've already left feedback for them.

"/> Feedback is a big waste of time on ebay....

1) its hard to give negative feedback to a buyer/seller because 9 times out of
10 they will give you negative in return.

2) Its too darn easy to switch to a new user name once one gets a few overly
bad feedbacks. Heck, if you are on aol... you have almost unlimited
possibilities
for switching your AOL handle and thus you are able to get a new account.

3) Once you reach the status of a few 100 positive feedback responses... one
or two negative feedbacks are pretty much meaningless... even if that
person
got royally screwed. They all melt right in to the big ol pot of +.

4) the feedback responses are TOO small. When you have had a bad experience,
its pretty damn hard to sum it all up in a sentance.

5) I have about 400 + feedback responses on one of my ebay accounts... which is

25 pages of feedback responses.... who has time to fuddle through all of
those
to find any negative feedbacks? I certainly dont.

6) Ebay doesnt do a damn thing about people with severe negative feedbacks.
I was looking at a guys feedback about 5 months ago... it was something in
the range of 200 + feedbacks and 50 - feedbacks.... obviously a high
number of bad dealings... yet... they were still selling on ebay. Speaking
of
that --- Ive caught several people shilling on their accounts --- reported
them,
and not a darn thing ever happened with that either.

My personal feedback policy --- I dont give feedback unless the buyer or seller

gives me feedback first... I dont have time to spend giving every little person
+
feedback that I handle buisness with. On occasion I will give feedback first
if a
buyer is a first time buyer.... thats about it though.

(sounding quite negative),
DU

&gt;been bidder, the seller waits till they see my feedback to send theirs. The
&gt;seller debate says that the transaction isn't over to qualify feedback from
&gt;the seller, until all parties are finished with the transaction.. I honored
&gt;my part of the bargain with cold hard cash or postal MO. The seller is now
&gt;benefiting from my transaction. Sellers should give positive feedback upon
&gt;money given in a timely fashion. If you disagree, please give me a reason to
&gt;understand your reasoning....besides paranoia that you may get bad feedback
&gt;first. If it makes sense, I will gladly change my opinion.
&gt;BTW, I buy from another online auction that specializes in glass and seller
&gt;feedback is usually given first. Only on Ebay does this happen where
&gt;feedback is withheld by a seller.

"/> Feedback sure tends to make people grumpy. Not you, jc! But it can turn
into such a power struggle.

I agree, sellers should give positive feedback when buyers complete their
end of the transaction. Timely would be good, but what do you consider
timely? I'm currently working my way through a stack of feedback for items
that shipped 12/3. The feedback will get posted soon, but let's be frank
here: fulfilling orders, especially right now, is my most important task.
Would you agree that you'd rather get your things right away and maybe have
to wait a week for feedback?

I have only one disagreement with you. Buyers aren't &quot;like&quot; customers,
they are customers, and any retail business, whether you are selling
Tiffany lamps or cottage cheese, whether you are selling on eBay or in a
store, that doesn't feel it has to be polite to it's customer base is
going to kid itself out of business eventually. Leaving feedback for a
customer who has performed their end of the transaction is only being
polite.

I feel that once the buyer has paid their money in a prompt fashion,
they deserve my feedback. If I am going to benefit from them leaving me
feedback, I ought to do the same for them. Hopefully Derek's response
was more the kneejerk reaction of a bedraggled retailer at Christmas
than his real sentiment towards his customers. (I can understand
Charlene's viewpoint, but she was talking about how quickly she got
feedback out, not whether you should leave it at all.)

This thread is getting a bit far afield for this group, but I felt I had
to agree with jc on this. Have any of you looked at the
alt.marketing.online.ebay group? It would probably be a more
appropriate forum for this kind of thread. (Coming from someone who has
been as guilty as any, and more guilty than most, on this issue.)

The legitimate argument against doing this is (1) the buyer's check
might bounce after the seller ships; (2) the buyer might turn around and
demand an unjustified refund; (3) the buyer might attempt fraud by
returning a diferent item for refund, etc. There are things that can go
wrong with a transaction *after* the item is shipped. Personally, I
think the odds of any of these things happening is low enough that I
don't worry about them, but some sellers do.

IMO, refusing to leave feedback just because the buyer hasn't left you
feedback is childish behavior. Sellers will generally leave more
feedback than buyers, because sellers are more likely to be
professionals with systematic procedures. Buyers are more likely to be
casual eBay users; I was terrible at leaving feedback when I was just a
buyer. Sellers should accept this imbalance as part of the unfairness
of life, leave appropriate feedback for all buyers, and move on to the
next item for sale, IMO.

Sending a form &quot;I shipped your item today&quot; e-mail is a similar process,
a few clicks less since you don't have to access an eBay page.

Donna, now that you feel a little better, &lt;grin&gt; you could leave
accurate feedback without getting angry... something along the lines of
&quot;Item was not as described, but seller refunded in full.&quot; That would let
others know that the seller's descriptions are not always accurate, but
give them credit for making it right... whether you do it as a positive
or a neutral is your choice, but once the refund is given, I don't see
the reasoning for posting a neg.

As a seller, I screwed up once or twice, bent over backwards to make it
right, and was rewarding by outstanding positive feedback from the
buyer... so I think the attitude of the seller determines the type of
feedback they receive, and rightfully so. OTOH, I've denied a refund
once because the description was clear and he just didn't want to
believe it, and that got me a neutral...

IOW, your feedback should help the next buyer decide on the
trustworthiness of the seller.

HTH, Michele

Well, Charleen, here we go again. The answer to your needs is the
AuctionAssistant program I use. It has preprogrammed letters. Among others,
these include the letter to high bidder after auction has ended (which lists
the number, description, ending bid, shipping, insurance and tax if applicable
and gives a grand total), letter telling them payment has been received, and
letter stating item has been shipped. As soon as you click the &quot;Item has been
shipped&quot; button (and it states the auction number and what the item is) a
screen pops up which says &quot;You have just notified that an item has shipped. Do
you want to leave feedback?&quot; You click on yes and it takes you to the feedback
screen where everything is filled in. I have a &quot;canned&quot; positive feedback
which states something like &quot;Great communication, fast payment, smooth
transaction. Highly recommend.&quot; All I have to do is click the Leave Feedback
button and I'm done.

"/> Ahh........shoot. I've gotten feedback similar to that, and I've flattered
myself into thinking that my email was great and the payment was particularly
fast.

I'd like to point out at this place in the thread that some feedback is outside
of ebay's forum and is invisible to the sellers. I'm talking about people who
email a high bidder and ask them to let them in on exactly how the transaction
worked out. All the details. It has happened to me a couple of times.

The one that sticks in my mind concerns a seller very new to ebay. I was the
high bidder for a very nice &amp; expensive piece of belleek (natch). Soon
afterwards I got an email from someone I had seen many times before bidding on
quite a bit of high-end belleek, although I didn't know him personally. He
introduced himself and asked for me to let him know how everything went - he
was a bit nervous about the seller's low feedback. It turns out there was a
bit of a problem. About a week after I sent my payment, I got an email from
the seller saying that when he was getting the piece ready to ship, he noticed
an small flaw in the piece. He was quite sorry about it, and wanting to make
good on it offered several options to me, including a full refund. After
thinking it over, I decided on another option he suggested, a $50 refund on the
piece, but also mentioned that I would be willing to take a $50 valued piece of
belleek instead. I added that I was very fond of belleek earthenware. He
emailed back that he would be putting a piece of earthenware in the package,
but that he would not tell me what it was. It was to be a surprise. I LOVED
the idea. Made getting the package so much more fun. The piece was a small,
very nice gilded plate in great condition, well worth fifty bucks. I sent the
buyer who inquired a full description of the transaction, included how pleased
I was at the end. Within a week he was the high bidder on half a dozen of the
seller's auctions. I don't think the seller ever knew the connection. For a
marketplace that sells thousands of things everyday, ebay can sometimes be a
very small world.

&gt;these include the letter to high bidder after auction has ended (which lists
&gt;the number, description, ending bid, shipping, insurance and tax if applicable
&gt;and gives a grand total), letter telling them payment has been received, and
&gt;letter stating item has been shipped. As soon as you click the &quot;Item has been
&gt;shipped&quot; button (and it states the auction number and what the item is) a
&gt;screen pops up which says &quot;You have just notified that an item has shipped. Do
&gt;you want to leave feedback?&quot; You click on yes and it takes you to the feedback
&gt;screen where everything is filled in. I have a &quot;canned&quot; positive feedback
&gt;which states something like &quot;Great communication, fast payment, smooth
&gt;transaction. Highly recommend.&quot; All I have to do is click the Leave Feedback
&gt;button and I'm done.

&gt;Ashley

I've been using Auction Assistant since shortly after it appeared, and
it is about the best piece of add-on software I've ever run across. I
wrote to John Slocum, who created it, and told him he ought to charge
more. Never done anything like that before.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Would you agree that you'd rather get your things right away and maybe
&gt;&gt;&gt;have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to wait a week for feedback?

&gt;&gt;&gt;It would be silly for me to disagree..but let me ask you a question?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Wouldn't you like to have me as a repeat, satisfied buyer by posting
&gt;&gt;&gt;feedback, if that's what I wanted as part of the transaction? Before the MO
&gt;&gt;&gt;was put in your bank, couldn't feedback be posted as part of a priority?

&gt;&gt;No, I'm afraid not. There is just not time when I'm shipping
&gt;&gt;12-20 items per day. Like many other eBayers, I work full-time as well
&gt;&gt;and like to think I have somewhat of a life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Waiting a week for feedback is no big deal, unless that week is used to see
&gt;&gt;&gt;what I say regarding the transaction... I appreciate your opinion.

&gt;&gt;Everyone who buys from me gets feedback. It's all positive. It gets
&gt;&gt;posted no matter what the buyer says. Though as I said, I do get behind
&gt;&gt;at times. What I would like would be an auction management system that
&gt;&gt;posts a factual emotionless &quot;item shipped this date. thanks for prompt
&gt;&gt;payment.&quot; feedback when I check the Item Shipped box. Then you could get
&gt;&gt;the super-timely posting that you want.

&gt;&gt;But as long as it has to be done manually, it's going to be subject to human
&gt;&gt;limitations. And given the choice of getting a Christmas tree tonight and
&gt;&gt;posting feedback, the tree is probably going to win.

&gt;&gt;I understand this is a sensitive issue for some, but I think some people
&gt;&gt;(again, not you!) are getting way worked up over it. I've gotten two nasty
&gt;&gt;e-mails recently from people who claimed I hadn't given them feedback when
&gt;&gt;in fact I had. One had the grace to apologize, the other is unrepentant.
&gt;&gt;All that wasted energy. And for what?

&gt;&gt;Charleen

Hi Ashley,

Sorry I haven't had time to catch up on mail...but AA is only (AFAIK)
for the PC, not for the Macintosh.

Sounds like a great tool, anyway.

I'm going to write to the Andale folks; they may be planning on adding
auto feedback sometime soon.

That &quot;re:sale&quot; program I told you about has one button feedback and
they are made for Mac.
I'd still like to hear from anyone else using this program. It's got a

I've got a couple horns of a dilemma I could send you!
No kidding though, If the goat wasn't advertised as half horny, I think
you should not only demand a refund ASAP, butt an apology as well.
Anyone sending broken items (especially this close to Christmas!)
without disclosing the damge should be called on it before they do it to
the next buyer. Ebay is a wonderful venue for sellers who otherwise
couldn't give their damaged crap away, where will it end if nothings
done? whats next, Headless horseman? Hummels without a leg to stand on?
Venus Di Milos with arms glued on?
Maybe a simple little form included in the &quot;Hi, I'm the high bidder
response&quot; or included with your payment would eliminate some of this
type of practice:
Hi, I was the high bidder on your-----My bid was based apon your
description. If this item is NOT in the condition you stated, Please do
not waste the time it will take for you to send it, me to return it and
the bad feedback that will result because of it. Bidding is not based
'on approval', it's based on trust. Have a nice day!
.... or something like that. btw, I'm sure glad I didn't get YOUR
goat!

I have been thinking about this. The only recommedation
I can make, and you may already be doing it, is that
you email the seller well before the auction's close
and ask for a specific description of the condition
of the item. And if you don't get it, don't bid.
They might be a little more forthcoming if you put them on the
spot by emailing them first.
Just a suggestion.
And I send you my sympathies,
which, I suppose, aren't worth much. But I have
bought my share of cracked and chipped shit
and it just drives me crazy.

I'm sure you meant to say, &quot;Does anyone know how it came about that
Europe lists the day, month, &amp; year, when we do it in reverse order?&quot;

FWIW, I don't have the answer to the question, but I'm certain that
the use of D-M-Y came before M-D-Y.

Personally, I think we should all use Y-M-D.

Charleen,

I offer a money back guarantee on Ebay
and a return time policy with things
sold on my website.

Regards,

Kathleen

&gt;&gt;I know a lot of RA's sell on ebay. But how many are regular buyers?

&gt; Me, when I get my daily prune juice.

&gt;&gt;I just started the buying part of the game and I am p*ssed! I have, so far,
&gt;&gt;received 11 of the 22 items I bought over the last month. Of the 11 I
&gt;&gt;received, 2 were cracked, 3 were chipped, &amp; 1 suffered from an obvious &amp;
&gt;&gt;badly done repair. None of these defects were described when these items
&gt;&gt;were offered. In fact, these items were described as in &quot;very good&quot; or
&gt;&gt;&quot;excellent condition.&quot;&amp; the photos sure didn't show the damage.

&gt; I don't blame you for being upset. Much of the stuff I've received in the
&gt; past had damage or defects not disclosed in the description. I'm trying
&gt; to be firm with myself now: no purchases unless either 1) seller accepts
&gt; credit cards, so I have some recourse or 2) seller offers a moneyback
&gt; guarantee.

&gt; I run like the wind when I see &quot;All Sales Final&quot;. Please sir, may I have
&gt; another?

&gt;&gt;I sell over ebay, through a friend, &amp; we are scrupulous in our inspection &amp;
&gt;&gt;description. Is it too much to expect others to be? Do they just figure that
&gt;&gt;enough people will &quot;let it go&quot; if it's inexpensive to pay for the refunds
&gt;&gt;for those that complain.

&gt; I think there's a lot of self-deception, a common human trait, going on
&gt; in the sellers' heads. &quot;Oh, it's just a tiny nick, it couldn't possibly
&gt; matter.&quot;&quot;If I say in the description it's cracked, no one will buy it.&quot;
&gt;&quot;After all, it's in excellent condition for its age.&quot;

&gt; One of my two negatives is from a woman who sent me cracked (with stains)
&gt; Minton china, agreed to accept a return, then accused me of swapping her
&gt;&quot;good&quot; pieces out for the cracked and stained ones she got back.

&gt; I got mail from a bunch of &quot;how dare you give *her* a negative&quot; folks,
&gt; presumably friends and family, when I negged that seller in return.
&gt; Later, another buyer wrote to me and said the seller was trying the same
&gt; you-switched-it tactics with her.

&gt; As a seller I offer a moneyback guarantee for any reason whatsoever, including
&gt; buyer's remorse. I just had one customer return a piece of silver because it
&gt; wasn't shiny enough, which I guess is one of the hazards of offering a
&gt; guarantee...people will use it occasionally for the silliest of reasons.
&gt; But overall I think it's a good business practice and will continue to use it.

I bought and recieved a badly stained antique
quilt from a seller on Ebay once. The quilt
wasn't as described nor did it look badly
damaged in the picture. I was disappointed
that I couldn't get the stain out. But I did
not give the seller a bad feedback.

What I do now with textile related auctions is I
take a copy of of a picture of something that I am
interested in buying from ebay and enlarge the
picture in a photo editor to see if I can see
any discolorations or defects. Its not easy to
see the defects often times but it helps. I then
delete the pictures after I am done.

I think everyone takes a chance buying things
from Ebay. Its just a question of how much we
want the item we see.

I avoid auctions that say &quot;no returns&quot; or &quot;as is&quot;
even if they say the item is in good condition.

I am both a seller and buyer on Ebay. When I sell
items I really try to be as empathic as possible
to the buyer since I have been in their position
myself. I try to be as detailed as possible in my
descriptions and if there is a defect or discoloration
on an item I will clearly state it.

Regards,

Kathleen

&gt;FWIW, I don't have the answer to the question, but I'm certain that
&gt;the use of D-M-Y came before M-D-Y.

&gt;Personally, I think we should all use Y-M-D.
