I bought a silver spoon this weekend. The seller says it is plate, but
I'm pretty sure it's sterling. It is about 12 inches long, and its
lines are very simple. Made by Gorham, it has the following
inscription:

Rochambeau
to Lt. Gov. Jabez Bowen
R.I.
1780

All I can find is that &quot;Rochambeau&quot; is Jean Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur,
comte de Rochambeau
(1725-1807), Commander-in-chief of the French forces during the American
Revolution. He was instrumental in the Battle of Worktown, the deciding
battler of the RW. He quartered troops in Rhode Island in 1780-81. I
can't find any reference at all on the 'net to J. Bowen (Lt. Gov's don't
seem to matter much in history).

I have yet to contact Gorham but will try; any commemorative silver or
Rev. War buffs here who can help? Any ideas on what value might be, or
which group might be interested in having it (lilke someone in
Williamsburg, etc.)?

Please reply to group as this is an employer-provided account. Thanks

"/> That's interesting. I would have thought it was coin silver. Any
particular reason why you think it's sterling? Always happy to learn.

"/> There was a silver maker by the name of Jabez Gorham (b1792-d.1869) who
produced silver in Providence, R.I. from 1813-1847. His items were marked J
Gorham. The only Gorham producing silver during the time frame you mention was
Miles Gorham but his silver was marked either MG in a wavy rectangle or M
Gorham in a rectangle. This really doesn't answer your question, I realize but
have you considered going to one of the geneological web sites and putting in
either of those names? Also, is there any other mark on the piece besides
&quot;Gorham&quot;?

"/> That is very interesting because I own one that sounds identical. What I have found out
is that in fact it is plate. One way you can tell by its weight and second is the &quot;SP&quot;
stamp on the spoon which stands for silver plate. I suspect our spoons were made for a
commeration or something such as that because the date &quot;1780&quot; is way to early for
Gorham silver with these particular markings. BTW does the handle on your spoon have
an engraved cartouche underneath the end of the handle? The one here does.

I just find it interesting that the spoon has such reference to RI and Gorham not only
because of its markings but the engraving as well.

Hope this helps!
