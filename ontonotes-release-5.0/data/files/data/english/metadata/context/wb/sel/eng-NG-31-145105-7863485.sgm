&gt; Playlist for Bob's Scratchy Records on August 03, 2007
&gt;Key:  Artist - Title - Notes
&gt;
&gt;Tommy Roe - Kick Me Charlie -  - ABC-Paramount - Though they toured the world as the backing band for Tommy Roe, The Roemans - in the words of lead guitarist Bo Glover - &quot;were a 'garage band' for sure. We just had some opportunities to move to a bigger garage.&quot; Hooked up with Roe by ABC Paramount, The Roemans also achieved a degree success on their own.

&gt;
&gt;The La Dell Sisters - Rockin' Robert -  - Mercury
&gt;
&gt;B.B. King - Mercy Mercy Baby -  - Kent - W hen he's onstage singing the blues, B.B. King will often take his hands off his guitar and repeatedly slam his right fist into his the open palm of his left hand, in the manner of an old-time gospel preacher. He does this to drive home some particularly poignant or pointed lyrical line. It's one of his trademark stage gestures.
The other one is this: He'll crisscross his hands at his heart, thumbs intertwined, his eight remaining fingers fluttering in the manner of a bird's wings. He usually plays this move for laughs--to impart an ironic undercurrent to some cutely romantic lyric line. But this gesture is actually just as gospel as the Bible-pounding fist--a sign of the Pentecostal dove, Christian believers' heart connection with their savior.
It's an odd thing to encounter onstage at a smoky Vegas lounge or roadside gin mill. But that juxtaposition of the earthy and the sanctified--showbiz glitz and the deepest depths of the soul--lies at the core of the life and music of the man born Riley B. King. He started out as a member of the Famous St. John Gospel Singers out of rural Indianola, Miss. And he never completely lost touch with those church roots--not even once he'd made his way to the bright lights and wicked ways of Memphis, reinventing himself as the Beale Street Blues Boy or just B.B. for short.

&gt;
&gt;The Everly Brothers - Gone, Gone, Gone -WB - Issued at the beginning of 1965, Gone, Gone, Gone kicked off the second half of the 1960s for the Everly Brothers, after a half-decade of work for Warner Brothers that had seen their albums go through some strange twists and turns. Their longplayers had started in a straightforward and highly successful fashion with 1960's Top Ten LPs It's Everly Time and A Date with the Everly Brothers , both of them offering diverse new material that nonetheless all fell into the umbrella of rock'n'roll. For the next four years, however, the Everlys seemed incapable of concocting
anything so conventional when it came time to issuing albums. Their two 1961 efforts, Both Sides of an Evening and Instant Party , were ersatz concept albums of sorts that leaned heavily on non-rock pop standards and film/Broadway tunes, while 1963's Sing Great Country Hits was entirely devoted to covers of popular country songs. There was also a Christmas album and two hits compilations, one of which actually contained some re-recordings of numbers they'd first done for Cadence Records before joining the Warners roster. Gone, Gone, Gone was a return, at last, to the relatively standard format albums were supposed to offer: new material, in the pop-rock style the brothers were known for, with a hit single or two.
The highlight of the album was the pounding title track, composed jointly by Don and Phil, which found them rocking harder than they had in about four years (or, indeed, ever). The song melded the rhythms and structures of Chuck Berry classics like &quot;Memphis, Tennessee&quot; with their peerless close harmonies, and became their next-to-last Top Forty hit in the United States, peaking at #31. Its quality would be recognized a few years later by Fairport Convention, who did their own fine version in 1968 for the BBC; Fairport must have been major Everlys fans, as they excavated another under-recognized Everlys classic, &quot;Some Sweet Day&quot; (from It's Everly Time ), for the BBC that year as well.

&gt;
&gt;Sam &amp; Dave - You Don't Know What You Mean To Me -  - Atlantic - Perhaps no act epitomized soul music as the secularization of gospel more than Sam &amp; Dave.
Samuel Moore and David Prater were both raised in the Southern United States, where they sang in church as children. During the '50s, they performed in soul and R&amp;B clubs with the gospel groups The Melionaires and The Sensational Hummingbirds, respectively, before meeting each other in at the King of Hearts club in Miami in 1961. Moore was hosting an amateur-night contest where Prater was singing. Once, Dave forgot the lyrics to Jackie Wilson's &quot;Doggin' Around,&quot; Sam coached him through the song. Following that night, the singers agreed to work as a duo and soon became a popular local Miami act and signed with Roulette Records, releasing a handful of unsuccessful singles before being signed to Atlantic Records in 1965. Atlantic persuaded their Memphis affiliate, Stax Records, to produce them.
Working with the Stax house band, Sam &amp; Dave created a body of sweaty, gritty soul that ranks among the finest and most popular produced in the late '60s. The duo's 1966 debut, &quot;You Don't' Know Like I Know,&quot; kicked off a series of Top Ten R&amp;B hits that included &quot;Hold On! I'm Comin'&quot; (1966), &quot;You Got Me Hummin' (1966), &quot;When Something Is Wrong with My Baby&quot; (1967), &quot;Soul Man&quot; (1967), and &quot;I Thank You&quot; (1968). However, the duo's career began to unravel in 1968, when Stax's distribution deal with Atlantic ended. Since Sam &amp; Dave were signed with Atlantic, not Stax, they no longer had access to the production team of Hayes and Porter or the house band of Booker T. &amp; the MG's, and their recorded work took a dip in quality. Though the switch of labels was unfortunate, what really caused the duo's demise was their volatile relationship. While the pair had enormous creative
energy, they frequently fought off-stage. Nicknamed &quot;Double Dynamite,&quot; Sam &amp; Dave became famous for their energetic, infectious live performances during the late '60s, which complimented the overall high-quality of their studio work. They may have communicated on-stage, but behind the scenes, it was reported that the duo could hardly stand each other's presence. The tension caused Sam &amp; Dave to part ways in 1970, just a few years after their heyday.
During the '70s, Sam &amp; Dave reunited several times to little attention. At the end of the decade, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd's Blues Brothers routine, which borrowed heavily from Sam &amp; Dave, sparked a resurgence of interest in the two, and the pair performed a number of concerts during 1980. However, their personal animosity had not faded, and they separated after a performance on New Year's Eve 1981. For the next few years, Dave Prater toured as Sam &amp; Dave with vocalist Sam Daniels. During the mid-'80s, Sam Moore revealed the sources of the duo's tensions in a series of interviews. Moore disclosed that he had been addicted to drugs during the '70s.
Dave Prater met with an even worse fate when he was killed in a car accident near Sycamore Georgia, on April 9th, 1988. Moore went on to appear with Junior Walker in the 1988 film &quot;Tapeheads&quot; and enjoyed a renewed solo career in 1994 when his duet with Conway Twitty, &quot;Rainy Night In Georgia&quot; appeared on the Top 10 crossover album &quot;Rhythm, Country, and Blues&quot;. He rarely played on the Oldies circuit, but continued to record with the likes of Don Henley and Bruce Springsteen, as well as hosting his own show at Boombox Radio.
Sam and Dave were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.

&gt;
&gt;Buffalo Springfield - Mr. Soul -  - Elektra - Buffalo Springfield was an American supergroup that didn’t exist long enough to be recognized as such. Though their tenure was short, Buffalo Springfield was a pivotal rock group with an organic, home-grown musical approach that reverberated beyond the Sixties. Along with the Byrds, the Buffalo Springfield laid the groundwork for the folk-rock and country-rock genres that took root in the Seventies. They produced two of rock’s greatest guitarists in Neil Young and Stephen Stills. Their three albums- Buffalo Springfield, Buffalo Springfield Again and Last Time Around -wove together strands of folk, country, pop, soul and rock. Buffalo Springfield also recorded one of rock’s greatest topical songs, “For What It’s Worth.” A cautionary number inspired by clashes between police and youthful protesters on Los Angeles’s Sunset Strip, it was the only Buffalo Springfield single to make the Top Forty, reaching #7 in 1967.
The five original members of Buffalo Springfield converged on California from different backgrounds and locales. Guitarists Stephen Stills and Richie Furay had been members of the Au Go-Go Singers, a nine-member folk group. Guitarist Neil Young, bassist Bruce Palmer and drummer Dewey Martin were all Canadian-born. Young and Palmer briefly played together in the Mynah Birds, a group built around singer Rick James (later, a funk-soul superstar). Stills and Furay crossed paths with Young in Toronto and New York in 1965. Then Young made a fateful decision: “Let’s go to California,” he told Palmer. Stills and Furay fortuitously spotted Young and Palmer driving the other way on L.A.’s Sunset Strip, and Buffalo Springfield was born. Martin, the last to join, had been the drummer in Sir Walter Raleigh and the Coupons, a group that was regionally popular in the Pacific Northwest. A mere week’s
worth of rehearsals preceded their first gig. Buffalo Springfield quickly gelled into a unit whose tight, energetic live shows at the Whisky a Go-Go, where they held down a magical six-week residency, are the stuff of rock and roll legend.
The group boasted an almost uncontainable pool of talent. Stills, Young and Furay were all formidable writers, guitarists and vocalists. When bassist Palmer got deported to Canada following a drug bust, producer Jim Messina-himself a singer and guitarist with a predilection for country- and folk-flavored rock-joined the band. Internecine squabbles, particularly between Stills and Young, led to Buffalo Springfield’s disbanding, but not before they’d recorded three classic albums that sketched a number of directions rock would follow in their wake.  It would be hard to imagine the careers of the Eagles, Jackson Browne and others without Buffalo Springfield as a precursor, and the roots of the currently popular Americana movement can be found here as well. However, the prolific solo careers of Neil Young, Stephen Stills and Richie Furay, and the band members’ respective group
endeavors-Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (and sometimes Young), Poco, and Loggins and Messina-are the larger, ongoing legacy of Buffalo Springfield. Neil Young included a nostalgic song about his old band, entitled “Buffalo Springfield Again,” on his 2000 album Silver and Gold , raising speculation that some sort of reunion might be in the offing.”

&gt;Jack O'Fire - Asked For Water -  - Estrus
&gt;
&gt;Black Diamond Heavies - Poor Brown Sugar -  - Alive Records - With an earthy blues-soul-jazz-punk credo feeding every inch of the rhythm and shake, the band lurches between foot-tappin’ freedom on “Fever in My Blood” that resembles the sweaty and spine-tingling moments of Memphis garage’n’roll purists the Oblivians. Yet, the Heavies’ palate is not one dimensional or stuck on the ratty and raunchy gutter tunesmith treadmill, for the old-fashioned preacher man soul delivery of “All to Hell,” with its smoke-encrusted, red shag carpet ambience could be a Stax cut from the 1960s. The horns make it that much more authentic and pregnant with slow swaying redemption. In turn, the big drum bombast of “Leave it on
the Road” pipes past the Tom Waits-esque exorcism of the devil, who had been chasing the narrator’s ass. Not by surprise, there’s a gritty Fat Possum records chill and distortion to the amblings of “Poor Brown Sugar,” which makes it a reptilian cousin to the Stones song by the similar title. Meanwhile, angels, pill-poppers, and a buttoned-down narrator sauntering under the alias Jesse James show up for the barroom crawl of “Stitched in Sin,” while the thrust and torment of cocaine gets unraveled and stabbed at on “White Bitch.” She may kill friends, steal wills, and keep the singer on the floor, but he’s got to wrestle with her, like a crazed snarling dog, damnit, less he becomes a helpless victim of that serpent eye she keeps trained on him, keeping his upside-down world baited, barbed-wired, and wrecked. The song is punchy and profound due to this thermal and toxic emotional core.
.
“Guess You Gone and Fucked It Up” wraps up the disc, and it is a burning rendition of the Paul “Wine” Jones song, who is a former Delta cotton gin worker and welder described as having “a dexterous manner of subsuming rhythm and lead functions in to a guitar style with the momentum and unpredictability of a runaway steamroller.” Luckily, Black Diamond heavies do right by him, preserving that unbridled, steam engine stoked, catapulting sound right into the dead silence of the end. If you think sound verite, lo-fi, or a hands-off technology is the road map to an unembellished sonic freedom, then this is your pork skin and chitlin plate of goodies.

&gt;
&gt;The Bob Seger System - 2 + 2 =? -  - Starline - Seger started his musical career in 1961 in Detroit as a member of The Decibels and there met his future manager and record producer, Punch Andrews. Seger returned to Ann Arbor where he played with The Town Cryers and then Doug Brown and the Omens. With them he released his first single in 1965, for the local Hideout Records label. In 1966 Seger sang on Doug Brown and the Omens' parody of Barry Sadler's song &quot;Ballad of the Green Berets&quot;, titled &quot;Ballad of the Yellow Beret&quot;, which mocked draf dodgers. Soon after its release Sadler and his record label threatened Brown and his band with a lawsuit and the recording was withdrawn from the market.
In 1966 Seger left Brown's group but retained him as a producer. As Bob Seger and the Last Heard , Seger had his first big Detroit hit with &quot;East Side Story&quot;, which sold 50,000 copies, almost all in Detroit and leading to a deal with Cameo-Parkway Records. Another of Seger's biggest early hit singles in the Detroit area was &quot;Heavy Music&quot; in 1967, which sold even more copies and had potential to break out nationally except that Cameo-Parkway folded. Nevertheless, &quot;Heavy Music&quot; would stay in his live act for many years to come.
During these early Detroit years, Seger also acted as producer for the local band The Mushrooms. He became (and remained) friendly with the band's leader Glenn Frey, who would later become one of the founding members of the Eagles.
In 1968, Bob Seger signed with major label Capitol Records and formed The Bob Seger System . This group was essentially a Michigan proto-punk band not unlike the SRC or The Frost. Their first single was the anti-war message song &quot;2+2=?&quot;, which reflected a marked change in Seger's political attitudes from &quot;The Ballad of the Yellow Beret&quot;. The single was again a hit in Detroit, but went unnoticed almost everywhere else.
The second single from The Bob Seger System was &quot;Ramblin' Gamblin' Man&quot;. Predictably it was a smash hit in Detroit, but it also became Seger's first nationally charted hit, peaking at #17. The song's success led to the release of an album in 1969, and the Ramblin' Gamblin' Man album reached #62 on the Billboard pop albums chart.
Seger was unable to follow up this early moderate success; the Seger System's follow-up album Noah failed to chart at all, leading Seger to briefly quit the music industry and attend college. Seger returned the following year, however, with the System's final album, 1970's Mongrel . In 1971, Seger released his first solo album, the all-acoustic Brand New Morning. But having met with minimal chart success over the course of three consecutive albums, Capitol dropped Seger from their roster.
Seger's next few albums, released on Punch Andrews' Palladium label and distributed by Reprise Records, were stylistically erratic and appeared in the low 100s on the Billboard albums chart, if at all. These albums included Smokin' O.P.'s (1972), which featured a minor hit (#76 US) with a cover of Tim Hardin's &quot;If I Were A Carpenter&quot;, and Back in '72 (1973) which featured a long list of known session musicians and work from J.J. Cale. It also has the studio version of Seger's live classic Turn the Page(later covered by Metallica). Seger maintained his regional appeal in Detroit, and had built a modest following in Florida (necessitating many drives back and forth), but to the general music world was regarded as a one-hit wonder.

&gt;
&gt;Roky Erickson - Red Temple Prayer (Two Headed Dog) -  - Shout Factory - Sumner Erickson's on the phone from Copenhagen, Denmark, explaining that his older brother, Roger Kynard Erickson, will be phoning a few minutes later than expected. &quot;We're in the car, and he wants to do it from his hotel room, if that's OK,&quot; says Sumner, who, in no uncertain terms, helped pull his brother from the abyss just when everyone else thought him lost to the demons, ghosts, gremlins and two-headed dogs barking in his head. He knows what is OK for his brother. There was a time when Sumner was the only one who knew what was OK.
Roger—known as Roky, chief among the acknowledged, revered and beloved fathers of psychedelic rock—has just finished his set at the Roskilde Festival, where he shared a weekend bill with the likes of The Who, the Flaming Lips, Wilco, Spiritualized and dance-rock sensations J.U.S.T.I.C.E. Sumner is still buzzed from the reception his brother received: &quot;The crowd at the end kept singing, 'Whoa-oh-oh-oh- oh ' for, like, 10 minutes, and Roky was already leaving the stage, and I told him, 'Why don't you go out and take another bow?' So he did all by himself, even while the stagehands were pushing the drum riser off the stage. And the crowd kept singing. It was beautiful.&quot;
He is, by all accounts, in fine voice; no surprise there, as it's been resting for more than two decades—the last time Erickson was doing full shows. He's performed only a few times in the past two decades, and usually only a few songs here and there. This comeback began more or less at the South by Southwest Music Conference in March 2005, when Erickson sang three songs at Threadgill's, among them his immortal ballad &quot;Starry Eyes.&quot; In September of that year came a show at the Austin City Limits music festival, where Erickson was introduced by Kinky Friedman as &quot;an explorer of the mind and a pioneer of the heart...the man I call The Magic Messenger.&quot; Erickson opened the show with &quot;Cold Night for Alligators,&quot; and he sounded like he did when he was a young comer—his voice high and tight, his guitar full of sparks and gasoline.
By now, anyone who knows the name Roky Erickson knows his story—his rise to prominence (in 1966, Roky and the 13th Floor Elevators performed their Top 40 hit &quot;You're Gonna Miss Me&quot; on American Bandstand ) and his descent into mental illness (the trips in the 1960s and early '70s to Hedgecroft Hospital in Houston, where he was treated to electroshock jolts, and Rusk State Hospital) and the Roky road in between the horrific then and the astonishing now. And for those unfamiliar with Erickson's story, in stores this week is former Dallasite Keven McAlester's documentary's You're Gonna Miss Me , which he started working on eight years ago this very month.
McAlester didn't know what the movie was going to be in 1999—probably a first-timer's short feature on the man Erickson used to be , a look back at the ghost of greatness. Then he found himself capturing Erickson's recovery, as Sumner, 18 years Roky's junior, went to court to get himself declared Roky's legal guardian. When McAlester met Erickson he was living outside Austin in a house full of TVs and radios tuned to everything and nothing—hellish white noise. He was rotting from head to toe, literally—his teeth and toenails were about to fall out. Now, Erickson's got a full head of fresh pearlies (thanks to Henry Rollins), and he even drives. &quot;Better than me,&quot; McAlester says.
&quot;When I started the movie, Roky seemed wholly uninterested in doing anything other than sitting in his house with that horrible white noise playing,&quot; McAlester says. &quot;I never in a million years thought this would happen. I never thought in a million years he'd get a driver's license, much less play concerts.&quot;
Or, for that matter, do interviews. As McAlester says, as recently as a decade ago Erickson was never engaged in conversations; I spent a few days with him in 1995 and always wondered if he heard me or was just putting me on, so oblique and strange were his answers to simple questions. Now, he doesn't say much beyond, &quot;I'm just havin' fun, man,&quot; but even over an international call, you feel that he's, well, present . &quot;Hello, Robert,&quot; he says later, when Sumner calls back. &quot;How ya doin', brother?&quot;
&quot;I just expected this to be real good, ya know?&quot; Roky says. &quot;My manager's been booking a lot of concerts for me, and this is going real well. Been a lot of fun. Exciting. I've been havin' a lot more fun since I began playing.&quot;

&gt;The Owens Singers - Walked On The Moon -  - Marble Hill
&gt;
&gt;The Rolling Stones - Have You Seen Your Mother -  - Exotic Import - &quot;Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?&quot; is a song by the British rock 'n roll band The Rolling Stones. It first appeared on their 1966 compilation album Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass) .
Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the song was recorded in the late summer of 1966. It is famous for its horns arrangement (arranged by Mike Leander; this is the first Stones song to feature brass) and is one of the earliest songs to use feedback from the guitars. The Stones have said that they were unhappy with the final cut, bemoaning the loss of the original cut's strong rhythm section. Well, this is the more stripped down  version!
It was released as a single in September 1966 simultaneously in the UK and the US (a first for the band), and reached #5 and #9 on those country's charts, respectively. The b-side is &quot;Who's Driving Your Plane?&quot;. The UK single is famous for its cover featuring the band dressed in drag. Peter Whitehead's promotional film for the single was one of the first music videos. A fan favourite, the song appears on many hits compilations and was recorded for the live album Got Live if You Want It!

&gt;
&gt;Elmore James - Sunnyland -  - Kent - Most electric slide guitar players will admit to the massive, if not, total influence of James' style. He was also a major influence on rock guitarists such as The Rolling Stones' Brian Jones and Fleetwood Mac's Jeremy Spencer. His songs &quot;Done Somebody Wrong&quot; and &quot;One Way Out&quot; were often covered by The Allman Brothers Band, who cited him as a major influence. James was also covered by blues-rock band Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble many times in concert. The most famous of these covers is one that came by an indirect route - James' fellow bluesman Albert King recorded a cover of &quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot;, and Stevie Ray Vaughan copied King's version of the song. That song was also covered by George Thorogood on his second album, &quot;Move It On Over&quot;
Another guitarist who admired Elmore James was Jimi Hendrix. There is a photo of Hendrix (that can be seen in the sleeve of Blues -album) in London wearing his famous military jacket and holding Elmore James's UK LP The Best Of Elmore James (Hendrix performed James' &quot;Bleeding Heart&quot; during the Experience's Royal Albert Hall concert in 1969, also with the Band of Gypsys at their new years concerts at the Fillmore East in 1969/70 and recorded two different versions of it in the studio).
James is mentioned in The Beatles' song &quot;For You Blue&quot;: while John Lennon plays the slide guitar (James' trademark), George Harrison says, &quot;Elmore James got nothin' on this, baby.&quot; Other artists influenced by Elmore James include Frank Zappa and Jeffrey Evans of the band 68 Comeback .
The Grateful Dead, John Primer ( Blue Steel CD) Billy Gibbons and Eric Clapton are other notable artists to have recorded Elmore James covers.
James's older cousin &quot;Homesick&quot; James Williamson, a regular companion of Elmore's from an early age, played with Elmore in the Broomdusters from 1957 on. He was also a successful blues man who played electric slide guitar in Elmore's style. He continued to record and tour until his death in 2006.

&gt;
&gt;Jimmy Grubbs - I Got A Rocket In My Pocket -  - Dee-Jay Jamboree - this song was never released back in it's day - Jeffery Lee Peirce did a version of it on a collection they put out after his death.
&gt;
&gt;Stud Cole - The Witch -  - Norton Records -  one of the best songs of this album is real killer. Stud Cole is an mazing rare and good album from California. Perhaps recorded in 1971. Originals go for big $$, Here is Scott's great reissue in heavy paste-on-sleeve. The songs have a dark and scary feel. What a singer Stud is. Pure Psych with Elvis like vocals. If you like Arcesia (Stud sings better) and Rick Saucedo you will love this one.

&gt;Clay Harper - I Can't Shake It -Casino Royale -
&gt;
&gt;The Immortal Lee County Killers - Revolution Summer -  - Estrus Records -
It's important to talk about the offshoot of the supposed garage rock revival of the last couple of years and where it's taking us. We've perhaps underestimated the result of such a throwback period, where guitars and drums are all one needs to make a lot of noise and sound good doing it. The White Stripes are the obvious example but for every Cinderella story comes the slew of other 'the' bands then prompted to be something different, something more progressive, and if they don't succeed they'll be in the bargain bin before you can say &quot;the Strokes&quot;. I've noticed this progression to good effect in my local music community, and have begun to see said bands popping up with releases that sound one step ahead of the averagely straightforward garage rock with which we've been inundated.
The Immortal Lee County Killers 3 is one such band. It's not so much that the band itself is a product of that &quot;revival&quot; -- this band has been around, making wild rock 'n' roll with punk and blues attitude since 1999. It's really a simple matter of what the trio has done with a once-simple music.
Drenched in the sweat of Jon Spencer (ILCK3 even cover &quot;Revolution Summer&quot; from Pussy Galore's 1990 LP Historia de la Musica Rock ), Chetley &quot;Cheetah&quot; Weise leads this guitar-drums-organ trio through the blistering, bluesy set of songs that comprise These Bones Will Rise to Love You Again . The result is both an examination of garage rock's origins and a deconstruction of where it's gone.

&gt;
&gt;Jimmy Newman - Carry On -  - Dot - Jimmy C. Newman is an American singer and a long time star of the Grand Ole Opry. He was born near Big Mamou, Louisiana, on August 27, 1927. As a child, he listened more to Gene Autry than to the Cajun music of the area but had a number of Cajun songs in his repertoire when, as a teenager, he joined Chuck Guillorry’s Rhythm Boys. He recorded a few unsuccessful sides for J.D. Miller’s Future label in the 1940’s but Miller persuaded Fred Rose in Nashville, Tennessee to give the young singer a shot. In 1953, he was signed to the Dot label and the following year recorded “Cry, Cry Darling” which reached Number 4 on the country charts.
His recording success led the Louisiana Hayride, in Shreveport, Louisiana, to hire him as a regular performer. His next four records all reached Top 10 status and in 1956 he was invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry. That following year he released his biggest hit, “A Fallen Star” which spent two weeks at Number 2 and also entered the Top 25 pop chart.
Now that he was an established artist, he began to integrate his Cajun influences into his music and recorded “Alligator Man”, which was a Top 25 record and continues to be his theme song at the Opry. In 1963, he released a Top 10 Hit, “The D.J. Cried”. His final hits came in 1965 and 1966 with “Artificial Rose” and “Back Pocket Money”. When his commercial popularity declined he returned to Cajun music, forming his “Cajun Country” band and taking the high energy fiddle and accordion based music of his native Louisiana to fans around the world. In 1976, his recording of the Cajun French song, “Lache Pas La Potate” (“The Potato Song”) earned Gold Record status in Canada. In 1991, Jimmy C. Newman and Cajun Country earned a Grammy nomination for their Rounder album “Alligator Man”.
He is  honored in the Cajun Music Hall of Fame in Lafayette, Louisiana.

&gt;The Jayhawks - Stranded In The Jungle -  - Flash - The Jayhawks were one of those West Coast groups who changed names, personnel and labels at the drop of a hat. Their career spanned over two decades, but only two years as the Jayhawks. The original group was formed in 1955 at Los Angeles Jefferson High School and included Jimmy Johnson (lead), Carl Fisher (tenor), Dave Govan (baritone) and Carver Bunkum (bass). An encounter with Flash Records owner Charlie Reynolds led to a recording contract. Reynolds liked their ballad &quot;Counting My Teardrops&quot;, which was released on Flash 105 in October 1955 (according to Marv Goldberg) or January 1956 (Jay Warner in his Billboard book of American singing groups). It sold well enough locally to give the group a second chance. The novelty rocker &quot;Stranded in the Jungle&quot; came out in May 1956. It was written by
group member Jimmy Johnson, the Jayhawks' manager Al Curry and local teenage girl Ernestine Smith. In spite of the record's low fidelity and the Jayhawks' shaky harmony, &quot;Stranded in the Jungle&quot; became an instant hit. Modern Records, recognizing the song's potential, recorded a more polished, more powerful and better recorded version with the Cadets. In fact, most people think that the Cadets' version is the original. Their version peaked at # 15 in Billboard's pop charts, bypassing the Jayhawks' version (# 18) and another cover by the Gadabouts on Mercury (# 39).
The Jayhawks' hit proved to be a one-shot. A third single on Flash, &quot;Love Train&quot;, derailed early and two singles on Aladdin in 1957 also failed to catch on. They changed their name to the Vibes for two singles on the Allied label, but in 1959 they were again credited as the Jayhawks for a further two singles on Eastman Records. Then, in 1960, they changed their name - almost for the last time - to the Vibrations. Carver Bunkum had left the group and with the addition of Don Bradley (bass) and Richard Owens (tenor, ex-Six Teens), the group was now a quintet, with much-improved harmonies. There was one release on the small Bet label before the Vibrations were signed by Checker Records in Chicago, a subsidiary of Chess. With their third single for that label, the group returned to the charts after a 5-year absence. Released in early 1961, &quot;The Watusi&quot; went to # 25 pop and # 13 R&amp;B.
The melody was almost a note-for-note copy of Hank Ballard's &quot;Let's Go, Let's Go, Let's Go&quot; from a few months earlier.
Two weeks after &quot;The Watusi&quot; dropped off the Hot 100, the group entered the charts again, but not as the Vibrations. H.B. Barnum, A&amp;R man for Arvee Records, had a problem. His hot act the Olympics were touring on the East Coast and he needed a new single immediately. Barnum persuaded the Vibrations to do a little moonlighting, and an Olympics- styled novelty called &quot;Peanut Butter&quot; was cut and credited to &quot;The Marathons&quot;. It peaked at # 20, but Leonard Chess discovered the fraud and filed a lawsuit against Barnum and his label. The Arvee single was stopped and Chess-Checker released a re-recorded version of &quot;Peanut Butter&quot; on both Chess 1790 and Argo 5389, labeled as &quot;The Vibrations named by others as Marathons&quot; (&quot;Vibrations recorded as Marathons&quot; on some pressings). Arvee kept the name the Marathons for use with another group to record a Marathons LP.
By 1964 the Vibrations were progressing from a dance group with hits like &quot;My Girl Sloopy&quot; (# 26) on Atlantic to a more ballad-oriented sophisticated soul sound on Okeh. Erroll Garner's &quot;Misty&quot; was another Vibrations hit, in 1965 (# 63 pop, # 26 R&amp;B) and in 1968 they had their final chart entry with &quot;Love In Them There Hills&quot; (# 93 pop, # 38 R&amp;B).

&gt;
&gt;The New York Dolls - Chatterbox -  - Mercury - Initially, the group was comprised of singer David Johansen, guitarists Johnny Thunders and Rick Rivets (who was replaced by Sylvain Sylvain after a few months), bass guitarist Arthur &quot;Killer&quot; Kane and drummer Billy Murcia. The original lineup's first performance was on Christmas Eve 1971 at a homeless shelter, the infamous Endicott Hotel.
They got their big break when Rod Stewart invited them to open for him at a London concert. Shortly thereafter, Murcia died of accidental suffocation (after he passed out from drugs and alcohol, groupies put him in a cold bath and forced coffee down his throat). He was succeeded by Jerry Nolan, a friend of the band's, though future Richard Hell and Ramones drummer Marc Bell (Marky Ramone) later claimed he auditioned to take Murcia's place: &quot;Only two people showed up to audition, me and Jerry. They gave it to him because I was doing all the fancy fills.&quot;
The band was influenced by vintage rhythm and blues, the early Rolling Stones, classic American girl group songs, and anarchic post-psychedelic bands such as the MC5 and the Stooges, as well as then-current glam rockers such as Marc Bolan. They did it their own way, creating something which critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote &quot;doesn't really sound like anything that came before it. It's hard rock with a self-conscious wit, a celebration of camp and kitsch that retains a menacing, malevolent edge.&quot;.
Johansen's energy made up for what was a weak singing voice; Thunders's fuzzy guitar sound became a near-instant band trademark, as did Sylvain's minimalistic rhythm guitar, Arthur's bouncing basslines and Nolan's tom tom-heavy drumming style. Sartorially, the Dolls looked like a Halloween party gang of transvestites who had broken into the Rolling Stones' and Marc Bolan's wardrobe trunks and made it even more androgynously exaggerated - best described by journalist Alan Parker as &quot;still shocking today... devastating then.&quot; Musically, their repertoire - mostly written by Johansen (he spelled his name JoHansen at the time) and Thunders, occasionally by Johansen and Sylvain - was a series of unapologetically high-energy, demimonde expressions of the seamy New York underground from which they emerged, particularly through their legendary shows at the Mercer Arts Center. Songs like
&quot;Personality Crisis,&quot; &quot;Trash,&quot; &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; and &quot;Jet Boy&quot; were seminal squalls of guitar abuse, making up in attitude what they lacked in musical ability. But for all their squall the Dolls didn't entirely lack for subtlety; &quot;Subway Train,&quot; for one, was as striking a piece of songwriting and even musicianship as the band could execute.
Those and six others (including a speedballing cover of Bo Diddley's &quot;Pills&quot;) turned up on their eponymous debut album, 1973's New York Dolls , on the Mercury label. It was produced by Todd Rundgren, who some critics think laid too dense a hand on the band's raw thrust, while others think he gave them precisely the guidance they needed to let the best of their singular snarl step forth. In an interview in Creem Magazine, Rundgren says he barely touched the recording, everybody was screaming &quot;turn me up&quot;, and when it came time for him to leave with the tape to bring it upstate to his studio in Bearsville, NY for mastering, Johnny Thunders stopped him and said &quot;that tape stays with us, you fiddled around with the knobs enough&quot;. The album received mostly positive reviews, but sales were sluggish. In any case, a Stereo Review magazine reviewer in 1973 compared the Dolls' guitar playing to lawnmowers!

&gt;Hank Ballard - (All The Things In Life That) Pleases You -  - King - Hank Ballard was so good he makes me crazy!!!

&gt;
&gt;Otis Spann - Walkin' -  - Blue Horizon - Personnel: Otis Spann: piano &amp; vocal/Peter Green: guitar/Danny Kirwan: guitar/ John McVie: bass/S.P. Leary: drums/Mike Vernon: producer  Recorded at Tempo Sound Studios, New York 9th January 1969

During the sixties, there was the British blues boom, containing many blues bands, one of the finest being Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. In January of 1969 Fleetwood Mac were at Chess Studios, Chicago, jamming with the likes of Willie Dixon, S.P.Leary, Honeyboy Edwards, J.T.Brown and longtime Muddy Waters pianist Otis Spann. The end result of those sessions was the classic double album “Blues Jam At Chess”. The rapport between the Mac and Otis Spann was such that they recorded another whole album together, “…Colossus”. Otis
Spann is his usual emotive and exciting self, feeling totally relaxed alongside his regular drummer, S.P.Leary. This coupled with Peter Green’s guitar playing, which is probably at it’s peak on these recordings, makes for a blues album of substance. “
The Biggest Thing Since Colossus” is probably one of the most underrated blues albums. Long out of print on vinyl and now re-mastered from the original ¼ inch tapes this album is a must buy for all.

&gt;The Lone Twister - The Lone Twister -  - Atlantic -
Murray “the K” Kaufman was born on February 14, 1922. He worked his way into radio in 1953, producing a late night interview show before receiving his own nightly program on WMCA/New York.
In 1958, Kaufman joined WINS/New York as the host of the Swingin’ Soiree , a mixture of rock and roll and Kaufman’s inventive patter. When he took over Alan Freed’s timeslot a year later, Kaufman quickly became the most popular disc jockey in New York.
Kaufman’s love for rock and roll and its audience led the Beatles to seek him out when they first came to America in 1964. Kaufman’s friendship with the group earned him the nickname “The Fifth Beatle.”
Anyway, he recorded this song in 1961 and it's actually kinda cool - it's said to have been done to promote a radio contest but hey, it rocks!

&gt;
&gt;Jerry McCain And His Upstarts - Rock &amp; Roll Ball -  - Norton Records -
Over a span of three years years, 1955 to 1957, Jerry McCain and his band, the Upstarts, cut no less than a half-dozen singles for Young, all in Nashville, including some memorable pieces like his first and now classic &quot;Courtin' In A Cadillac (2068)&quot; and later &quot;Run, Uncle John! Run (2081).&quot; Generally speaking, most of his endeavors of this era were upbeat numbers verging on rock and roll and many had a decided comic bent with a philosophic &quot;sadder but wiser&quot; life lesson prevailing.
In the studio, Ernie &quot;the dictator (to use Jerry's expression),&quot; tried to keep the music stark, simple, and uncomplicated, often just employing three musicians to back his harmonica player, like Robert Christian or Chris Collins on guitar, Skippy Brooks on piano (so-named because of a pronounced limp), and brother Roosevelt McCain on percussion, who kept beat with a folded magazine. And since he was a &quot;control freak,&quot; Young often was at odds with Jerry's own perception about how things should be done. &quot;One thing we went around and around with was the volume on the bass. He wanted the bass in the background with the sound level down and I wanted it more out front and louder because we weren't getting enough bottom to the record,&quot; said Jerry, who to his perpetual regret had to, in addition, sign over the publishing rights of these compositions to Ernie's Excellorec Music.
Although the dozen sides recorded in Nashville were sufficient for an album, none was ever envisioned and McCain had to wait until a CD, That's What They Want: The Best Of Jerry McCain was issued by AVI/Excello in 1995. Record executive Ray Harris, superagent Seymour Heller (Liberace), and writer Ed Cobb (&quot;Dirty Water&quot; and &quot;Every Little Bit Hurts&quot;) of the AVI entertainment group in the late 70s bought the entire Excello catalogue and Woodland Studio from the Crescent Corporation (to which they were originally sold by Ernie Young) and then sought to repackage the masters, a commitment which for rather arcane financial reasons was never fully realized. Not long after the initial releases of this series, including McCain's, AVI sold the Excello inventory to Rhino, the famous oldies label, and they reissued the same assemblage as CD 70896.
Undoubtedly Jerry's frustration with the Excello sessions led to his undertaking a home recording project back in Gadsden during 1956-57 which eventually yielded eleven sides, many of them wild stompers, which did not see the light of day until 1981 when a Dutch record entrepreneur, Martin Van Olderen (spelling?), inquired about them and issued them on White Label (LP 9966) as Choo Choo Rock, a transaction which, to say the least, never sat well with Jerry. &quot;He said he was a fan and he offered to give me three hundred fifty dollars[in advance for royalties] for the tape. And like a fool I mailed it to him. Then came the LP, which surprised the hell out of me. And since then, I've never heard from him and never been able to contact him. As far as I know, this crook's been selling the thing overseas for the last twenty years,&quot; said Jerry ruefully. Later, when Jerry began traveling
overseas, his Dutch booking agent, Helma Vogel, of Bluebird corroborated his appraisal of the producer. But, by then, the damage had already been done.

&gt;Frankie Lymon - Jailhouse Rock - Roulette -
Frankie Lymon had a falsetto voice and recorded a monster hit in the 50's with some friends. He was born in New York City in 1942, and attended Edward W. Stitt Junior High School where he helped to form a singing group called The Premiers. Along with lead singer Frankie the group included Joe Negroni, Herman Santiago, Sherman Garnes and Jimmy Merchant. Richard Barrett, leader of a group known as The Valentines and a talent scout for the Gee record label, heard them singing on the stairs of a tenement on 165th Street in Manhattan and brought them to George Goldner at Gee. They were renamed The Teenagers.
In 1955 they formed a song from a poem that had been given to them by a friendly neighbor. Later that year they recorded Why Do Fools Fall In Love? and it was released as a record by The Teenagers featuring Frankie Lymon. The song went to the top ten in the USA and remained on the charts for many weeks, and it reached #1 in the United Kingdom. A catchy tune with a brilliant performance by Frankie Lymon, it was one of the most popular songs of the early days of rock-and-roll.
Other songs were recorded and released in 1956 and 1957 including I'm Not A Juvenile Delinquent and others. The group appeared in some movies such as Rock, Rock, Rock and Mister Rock and Roll , and in 1957 Goldner began promoting Frankie as a solo act; Frankie released some songs of his own including the top twenty song Goody, Goody and eventually he signed with Roulette Records. Meanwhile, The Teenagers tried various replacements but none with the success that they had had earlier.
Frankie Lymon by this time had a serious drug problem. In 1961 he was forced into a drug rehabilitation program at Manhattan General Hospital. He attempted a comeback -- singing, dancing, and playing drums -- but never was able to shake his addiction and was convicted on a narcotics charge in 1964. He was found dead from a drug overdose on the bathroom floor of his grandmother's apartment at age 25, on February 28, 1968.

&gt;
&gt;Eddie Hodges - New Orleans -  - Aurora - Eddie Hodges was a child movie star in the fifties - oddly in 1965, at the peak of the British invasion he had the rockinest version of this song ever recorded!  Go figure.
Examining the showbiz credits of Eddie Hodges, you may be surprised to learn that this very talented and popular child star appeared in only about eight films [according to IMDb] between 1959 and 1968. We seem to recall that he was all over the map in the early 60s and just about every movie-struck kid in the country envied him. After all, here was a kid who got to work with just about everybody of major importance in the entertainment business: Sinatra, Elvis, Lucy, even Joi Lansing . . . the list just goes on and on. Of course, Eddie Hodges also made numerous television appearances and had hit records too, so it shouldn't be surprising that he made such an impact on us. Kid actors come and go, and some of them actually do a lot of good work before they're forgotten, but Eddie Hodges is one that a lot of us still remember. Maybe in a way he symbolizes an era
that fell between Shirley Temple and Macaulay Culkin -- which was not such a bad time to grow up in.

&gt;John Lee Hooker - The Motor City Is Burning -ABC - Hooker was born on 22 August 1917 in Coahoma County near Clarksdale, Mississippi, the youngest of the eleven children of William Hooker (1871–1923), a sharecropper and a Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (1875-?). Hooker and his siblings were home-schooled. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs, with his earliest musical exposure being the spirituals sung in church. In 1921, his parents separated. The next year, his mother married William Moore, a blues singer who provided John's first introduction to the guitar (and whom John would later credit for his distinctive playing style). The year after that (1923), John's natural father died; and at age 15, John ran away from home, never to see his mother and step-father again.
Throughout the 1930s, Hooker lived in Memphis where he worked on Beale Street and occasionally performed at house parties. [1] He worked in factories in various cities during World War II, drifting until he found himself in Detroit in 1948 working at Ford Motor Company. He felt right at home near the blues venues and saloons on Hastings Street, the heart of black entertainment on Detroit's east side. In a city noted for its piano players, guitar players were scarce. Performing in Detroit clubs, his popularity grew quickly, and seeking a louder instrument than his crude acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.

&gt;Billy Childish And The Blackhands - The Double Ax -  - Sympathy For The Record Industry - A cult figure in America, Europe and Japan, Billy Childish is by far the most prolific painter, poet, and song-writer of his generation. In a twenty year period he has published 30 collections of his poetry, recorded over 70 full-length independent LP’s and produced over 1000 paintings. Born in 1959 in Chatham, Kent. Billy Childish left Secondary education at 16 an undiagnosed dyslexic. Refused an interview at the local art school he entered the Naval Dockyard at Chatham as an apprentice stonemason. During the following six months (the artist’s only prolonged period of employment), he produced some six hundred drawings in ‘the tea huts of hell. On the basis of this work he was accepted into St Martin’s School of Art to study painting. However, his acceptance was short-lived and before completing the course he was expelled for his outspokenness and unorthodox working methods. With no qualifications and no job prospects Childish then spent some 12 years ‘painting on the dole’, developing his own highly personal writing style and producing his art independently.

&gt;The Red Squares - I Held Her In My Arms - self-released - The REd Squares were a south St. Louis band - gone but not forgotten -
THE RIVERFRONT TIMES said &quot;[the Red Squares] play punk rock funneled through '60s AM radio, all hooky and melodic and romantic. ... Drummer Perry has the steadiest, quickest high-hat tap in the city ... lead guitarist Boelter creates weird, unpredictable lead lines that work inside the songs ... They're as tight as they should be: On shitty sound systems, their work ethic shows, and on good sound systems, they're so good that they deserve thousands of diehard fans.&quot;

&gt;
&gt;ACDC - Highway To Hell -  - Atlantic - AC/DC's first American exposure was through the Michigan radio station AM 600 WTAC in 1977. The station's manager, Peter C. Cavanaugh, booked the band to play at Flint's Capitol Theater. The supporting act was MC5, who had briefly reunited and agreed to play at the event. The band opened with their popular song &quot;Live Wire&quot; and closed with &quot;It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)&quot;.
AC/DC came to be identified with the punk rock movement by the British press. Their reputation, however, managed to survive the punk upheavals of the late 1970s, and they maintained a cult following in the UK throughout this time. Angus Young gained notoriety for mooning the audience during live performances.
The 1978 release of Powerage marked the debut of bassist Cliff Williams, and with its harder riffs, followed the blueprint set by Let There Be Rock Only one single was released for Powerage , &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Damnation&quot; and gave AC/DC the highest mark at the time, reaching #24. An appearance at the Apollo Theatre in Glasgow during the Powerage tour was recorded and released as If You Want Blood , featuring classic songs such as &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot;, &quot;Problem Child&quot;, and &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;, as well as lesser-known album tracks like &quot;Riff Raff&quot;. The album was the last produced by Harry Vanda and George Young with Bon Scott on vocals (although Vanda and Young later produced Blow Up Your Video ) and is claimed to be AC/DC's most underrated album.
The band's sixth album, Highway to Hell , was produced by Mutt Lange and released in 1979. It became the first AC/DC LP to break into the U.S. top 100, eventually reaching #17, and it propelled AC/DC into the top ranks of hard rock acts. Highway to Hell put increased emphasis on backing vocals but still featured AC/DC's signature sound: loud, simple, pounding riffs and grooving backbeats. The final track, &quot;Night Prowler&quot;, has two breaths in quick succession at the start of the song, intended to create a tone of fear and loathing.
Bon Scott's Death
On February 19, 1980, Bon Scott passed out after a night of heavy drinking in London, and was left in a car owned by an acquaintance of his named Alistair Kinnear. The following morning, Kinnear rushed him to King's College Hospital in Camberwell, where Scott was pronounced dead on arrival. Although common folklore claims that pulmonary aspiration of vomit was the cause of Scott's death, the official cause was listed as &quot;acute alcohol poisoning&quot; and &quot;death by misadventure&quot;. Scott's family buried him in Fremantle, Western Australia, the area to which they had emigrated when he was a child.
Inconsistencies in the official accounts of Scott's death have been cited in conspiracy theories, which suggest that Scott died of a heroin overdose, or was killed by exhaust fumes redirected into the car, or that Kinnear did not exist. Additionally, Scott was asthmatic, and the temperature was below freezing on the morning of his death
