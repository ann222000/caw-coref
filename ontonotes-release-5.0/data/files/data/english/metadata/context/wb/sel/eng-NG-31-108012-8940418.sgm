How much do you eat and what foods do you like?

Too much. Rice, beans and kraft mac-n-cheese don't cost near that much  :-)

You can eat well for that kind of money. Of course, frequent restaurant
meals (or even take out) will kill that. If you're trying to save as
much money as possible, you could slip in for half that amount (though
it depends where you live). But assuming you're willing to prepare
almost all meals, don't have really expensive tastes, and are an
efficient cook/shopper, I think that's more than you need. But I'd be
curious what others think.

Depends on where you live and if you know how to cook without TV dinners and
prepared frozen foods.  Because we do know that, we average about that for a
fsmily of 3 but that doesnt add in the incidentals at the grocery store like
cleaning compounds and such.  The majority of my meals (breakfast and lunch)
cost 3$ for the 3 of us.  That adds up to 270$ a month is dinner if also 3$
but dinner is usally about 4$ and snacks add in another 1$ a day or so.
Call it 330$

This will NOT work with TV dinners and prepared foods.

Are you a cook and know how to make simple dishes from pretty much raw
produce?

I agree with the responses you've gotten so far.  You don't have to
turn into a chef or anything to be able to eat very well on the budget
you mention.  I'm curious what types of food you like to eat.

I don't know.  $100-$125 a week for FOOD for one person sounds like an
awful lot to me.    Much will depend on whether or not you are cooking
or whether you are heating.  Cooking from scratch is cheaper and usually
healthier and tastier.  If you have the interest in it, you'll make the
time for it.    BUT, if you're going to cook, expect to have high
expenses for at least one or two months while you stock your pantry and
larder with staples and &quot;good things to have on hand.&quot;  J M O.

Too hard to say without knowing more.  What part of the country are you in?
What type of diet do you eat?  Also, keep in mind that your first grocery
trip is likely to be your most expensive because you are starting from
scratch.  You will need to buy all of your spices, oils and other kitchen
staples.

That sounds a bit high to me, but does that include cleaning supplies,
pet food, dining out, etc.?

Everyone is right about your first (and possibly second) month being
pricey ....

Might I suggest that a sibling or friend host a &quot;Pantry Party&quot; for
you? Guests could bring a jar or spice or a can of veggies, dried
pasta -- you get my drift  -- and you provide pizza or whatever and
everyone has a great time celebrating your new found freedom. Sort of
a low budget version of the traditional House Warming. You are going
to have costs with moving that you never even thought about. Then, the
next day, you take inventory of what you have and what you need
(keyword here: NEED) and do your shopping.

It depends.

It's possible to live almost entirely on potatoes; for one thing, you
can get your daily requirement of Vitamin C from them.

Near the other end of the spectrum, if you _must_ have the best
available kind of steak, the priciest kind of bread, etc....

It also matters where you live.

And how much preparation you're willing to do yourself.  If you buy the
kind of Hamburger Helper with hamburger (freeze-dried) already added as
a regular thing, you'll probably spend a lot more than if you're the
kind of person who uses dried beans rather than the canned ones.

Great thanks for answers.
I will be in West Virginia, in Three States Area, in very small town.

I would say that I eat normal food, and try to consume very little of
any frozen products, and unfortunately no restaurants. I can cook, but
only time to cook is after work, and I might even work on Saturday.

$400 and below /month sound like a reasonable numbers. $500 is bit too
much, but still in my budget.

If you can make things that freeze well, you'll be more than fine.
Cook more in the beginning and freeze portions, this way you won't
be stuck eating the same thing every night.  I get the idea you're
going to be pretty tired when you walk in the door, that's when
it'll pay off being able to pull pasta sauce or chili or whatever out
of the freezer and eat.  Maybe keep salad stuff on hand.

Stick around, people will give you great ideas and recipes.  Good luck.

Then consider getting a Crock-Pot or other slow cooker.

For this and other kitchen stuff, I recommend looking first in thrift
shops.

My time is similarly constrained.  I cook large batches on the weekends,
and then use them up during the week.  If I can't use something up fast
enough, I freeze what's left, for times when I don't get a chance to cook.

Oh, I see where you are.  Lovely country.   Shopping is closeby for you at
either Martinsburg or Hagerstown, depending on your transportation
situation.  In my opinion, Hagerstown is quite spread out, but there's lots
of shopping there.  Martinsburg is OK.

Martins Supermarket  is a good grocery store.  I live in the Winchester VA
area and that is where I do my 'regular' grocery shopping.  There 'may' be
one in Martinsburg, but you'd have to check.

Good luck.

Depends on what you eat/buy.  I am very thrifty and don't
eat anything too fancy or expensive for the most part.
I spend less than $100/month, for just me.  This is of course
just food.  Not other things I might buy at the &quot;grocery&quot;
store.

That is plenty, assuming you can cook and make your own
lunch.  Here, let's try some ballpark numbers:

1 Doz. eggs - $1.50
2 loaves bread - $4.00
1 lb. luncheon meat - $7.00
1 gal. milk - $3.50
3 lbs frozen vegetables - $5.00
1 lb. hamburger - $1.50
2 rib eye steaks - $10.00
2 boneless/skinless chicken breasts - $3.00
1 head of lettuce - $1.50
5 lbs. potatoes - $3.00
5 lbs oranges - $5.00

Now figure thats for one week.  Maybe with some extra.
OK, that's not a complete list but from that you could eat 2 eggs
every moring for breakfast with toast and an orange.  Make a sandwich
for lunch every day, and have meat and vegetables and potatoes for
dinner and all that is $42.  Add in a box or two of cereal or
whatever.  Add some more fresh vegetables for a salad and you are
still under $50 per week.  I won't swear by those numbers, but
they're probably close.

As others have said, you'll need to stock up on some basics at first
and restock those over time, but still nothing that should drive the
bill up too far.  Of course, some of that budget you mention may have
to go to cleaning supplies and other household expenses so don't go
nuts on the steaks and such until you have a good feel for that.

I'd say that's very generous. When I was living in Chicago I'd rarely
spend more than $50 a week, Of course I was a pretty capable cook so I
didn't go for expensive pre-prepared stuff, but was still able to eat
fairly well. You should be fine.

I second the suggestion of making stuff and freezing it - a big time
saver. It also solves the problem of making something and having it
for 6 meals it because you're the only one eating it! Maybe also get a
few good crockpot recipes in your meal rotations - easy to throw
together in the morning and dinner's waiting when you get home.  Basic
crockpots aren't very expensive, especially if on sale.

Good luck on your own - a very exciting time!

Not to far off.  I'd not eat that much bread in a week, but then Id eat lots
of rice (Just got stateside from 6.5 years in Japan and my cooking changed).

The initial stocking has been mentioned by many and it can be a killer.  We
are in that mode having gotten here 3 weeks ago.  Also since I really so
make most things from the scratch basic foods and add my own stuff, that
means it takes money to stock the spices and such.  My basic spice set needs
about 25 spices, of which I have only 9 just yet (dried chinese mustard,
ground ginger, garlic powder, 5 spice, wasabi powder, poultry spice, old
bay, black pepper, dried chile flakes from korea).  As you can see, I'd have
a problem making anything 'italian' still.  When done stocking spices, I
will spend an estimated 150$ and still be reaching for something I don't
have.

But because I know how to use all those spices, they will save me *bundles*
later as I dont have to buy pre-built spagettii or pancit seasonings etc.

But lets go back to Alexander's time constraints.  One person made a good
suggestion of a crockpot and it's dead on target for his time needs and
simple foods ready to go when he gets home.

Alexander, if you are reading all this thread &lt;g&gt;..  Removable liner,
standard 'tall' model, cant quite fit a gallon milk jug in it but almost.
10$ tops at a yardsale, new they are usually 15$.  Get the glas lid ones as
they work better and last longer.  Can get replacement lids easy at any
Kmart etc type place for 3-5$.  The good part is food ready at all times.
The down part is you cant eat the contents up in one meal so are gonna have
to either freeze then reheat the excess, or eat the same meal several days
in a row.  Some folks do not mind that but dunno about you.

Food there is decently priced so you'll fit the other fellow's estimate
pretty close.

Your needs also contain being able to mix something up when you are tired
and hungry which means some 'fast prep' things will want to slip in.  For
example, it takes time to boil a potato to done.  Canned ones arent as good,
but you can pretty much just reheat them.

Here's a time saver for potatoes.  Get a crockpot with a removable liner
(easier to clean by far and you dont have time to muck with the other type).
wash and dont dry the potatoes.  Wrap in alumnium foil if you like and put
them in the crockpot on low.  Tuck the excess in the fridge for use the rest
of the week.  This lets you take advantage of the 5# bag of potatoes for 3$
and meet your time needs.  People with time needs and no sense, get
pre-baked ones at the freezer section for about 1$ each &lt;g&gt;.  Make your own
for about 7cents each.

I'd also skip the boneless chicken breasts.  Sure they are 'fast' but even a
person with no experience can reach with their fingers under the meat and
pull it off the bone in 30 seconds or less.  Cost difference *significant*.
I also happen to like thighs better anyways so go that route.  I leave them
on the bone but pull off the skin with some recipes.

Here's 2 cost saver 'hamberger helpers' for you.
MMMMM----- Recipe via Meal-Master (tm) v8.06

Title: Hacienda Hamburger
Categories: Beef, Groundmeat
Yield: 6 Servings

2 lb Ground Beef
2 tb Cooking Oil
1 1/2 c  Chopped Celery
1/2 c  Chopped Onion
6 oz (1 cn) Tomato Paste
2 1/4 c  (3 cns) Water
2 c  Uncooked Noodles
1 c  Diced American Cheese
1 c  Sliced Ripe Olives
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper

Brown meat in oil in electric skillet or large frying-pan.  Add
celery and onion; cover and cook slowly 10 minutes.  Add tomato
paste, water, noodles, cheese, olives, salt and pepper; stir to
combine.  Cook slowly until noodles are tender, abotu 30 minutes.
NOTE: This is just as good on the second day.

MMMMM

In that one, skip the celery.  It doesnt really add anything this time and
tends to be a bit pricey.  I'd use a can of rotel tomatoes with chiles in it
to replace 1 cup of the water, then I'd add stuff from my spice cabinet like
a little more 'hot' stuff.  I'd not use a whole cup of black olives if
finances were trim, but I would add a small can of the chopped ones.

4 sl Bacon diced
1    Chopped green pepper
3    Potatoes peeled and diced
2 ts Mustard
3    Beef bouillon cubes
1/4 ts Pepper
2 c  Boiling water
6 tb Vineger

Brown meat, onion, bacon and green pepper; drain. Stir in remaining
ingredients. Simmer unitl potatoes are tender over low heat, about 45
mins.

MMMMM

This is good but better with red wine vinigar and I'd use 4TB vice 6.  I
dont bother with the bacon as you cant tell it's in there.  Want it faster?
Remember above and the pre-cooked potatoes?  This is practically heat and
eat stuff.  Not haute cuisine, but good simple solid stuff.  Reduce the
recipe to 1/4 of each thing there and you have a fast skillet supper for 1.
Reduce by just half and you have a lunch to take wirh you next day &lt;grin&gt;.

Do you have Fresh Market where you are? They have bulk spices in small
ziplock baggies. They hold as much as or more than the usual spice bottle,
but are much cheaper. A dollar and change for most spices. You can fill old

Good prices.  I got small jars of 18 of my things I was still lacking, 35$.
I still have many other things to find which they do not stock, but thats a
big chunck of the common stuff for far less than the commisary has them!
Thanks, you just saved me about 40$  They lean more to european spices so
I'm hunting up the remainders elsewhere.  Not allowed to ship any foods
(spices included) from Japan.

Some of the rest arent truely 'spices'.  Peanut flour, bonito flakes,
various dried seaweeds (not talking nori here, other ones).  Grin, don't get
scared, all 'legal stuff' no 'magic mushrooms' or anything like that.
schimi (probably mis-spelled that one, it;s a 5-7 blend japanese chile
powder mix).  I did see some interesting blends as well but didnt get any of
those.

Alexander, if you see this and need spices, check out www.penseys.com but
only if you need 10 or more types.  Otherwise, the shipping will get ya.

Nope sorry, no name like that which I am aware of here.  Either way, I have
the basics now (or such as I term basics.  YMMV)

Now added to the kitchen:  allspice, basil, cinnimon, celery seed, whole
cloves, coriander, whole comino (cumin), dill weed, black peppercorns
(whole), majorum, oregano, sweet hungarian paprika, whole caraway, ground
galingal, whole rosemary, whole sage, thyme, whole anise seeds, tarragon.
Left out of above list but have 3 types of curry powder.

Things that come to mind I do not have yet: vanilla bean, fennel seeds,
sesame seeds, poppy seeds, tumeric, saffron, mace or nutmeg, star anise (not
same as the seeds), cream of tartar, arrowroot.  Some of thsat they had but
I didnt get it this run.  I want to check the quality of what arrives and
they arent as essental to my cookery.

In his circumstances?  Possibly so.  I'd find the crockpot route more handy
but if you notice, he's only got limited time.  This isnt someone who can
sous-chef or spend 4 hours making a fancy meal every night.  Alot of recipes
work fine for just simple dinner and call for some cooked potatoes.  Thats
what canned ones are.  Not as cheap or good as fresh cooked, but they work
in a pinch.

I usually have a can or 2 on hand for a fast need.  I also have potato
flakes but they get used more as breading on in a bread batch.

I realize that the recipe doent tell you to drain the beef but is it needed
to spell everything out?  As to 'process cheese' if you look up 'American'
on wikipedia you will come up with that definition but in some parts of the
country (of which he is in one of them) there is a real cheese that's a
medium cheddar which goes by that name.  It's a little softer than aged
cheddar, but is hardly velveeta or anything like that.  Its very close to
wisconsin chedder.

No, but i think posting an idea of a recipe is a good thing from time to
time, especially when the thread (you did read it right?) showed he needed
fast tthings that fit his budget and time allowances.

Gotta see what his level of cooking is first, before we get into homemade
udon with home made dashi and kangkoon vinigrette.  Although come to think
of it, thats faster to make!

Thats for sure!  I am not going to mail order those things until I check the
local stores out.  I've been so busy getting setup, we havent had time to
travel around and find such a place and the old one moved.

What I miss, I knew I would miss.  Tonoo Market and the open air little
grocery nooks.  The seaweed lady had bins with 30-40 types dependng on
season and the miso lady had bins with 10-15 misos (sometimes more,
seasonal).  Many of the seaweeds would be fresh and we worked out how to
tell me how to fix them, though I never did get good at naming them.  I can
deal with dried versions though well enough for most things.

I havent located fresh miso yet but I can cook around that with most things.
I havent located mirin yet but have sake and can adapt.  Many of the
vegetables I got used to, arent common in America (gobo anyone? it's Burdock
root).  Yet there are other things I missed there, which I can find here to
its a trade off.  I'm doing a mix and match style of cookery to keep the
family from the edges of 'culture shock'.

Since I'm largely a scratch cook, shifting what I have to scratch cook with,
is making me feel a little like 'The Iron Chef' shows with a strange
ingredient to master.

Funny one happened though today.  I had to run to the store for a quick grab
of eggs and things, and took Charlotte with me.  Krogers had small pansized
fish.  Charlotte found the bamboo sticks and we are having grilled fish
sticks tomorrow.  The fellow at the counter thought it quite amuzing that a
grilled fish on a stick in Japan is called a fish stick.  I asked him, 'what
else would you call it?'  Dont worry, we get a giggle out of 'engrish' too
there. BTW, present the traditional American fishstick to a japanese person,
and they ask why it isnt round.

Basics:
There's nothing to worry about doing math with a bread machine.  Put 1-1/4
cups liquid in it.   Add oil if you wish.  Add salt.
Put in a couple of cups of flour.  Let it mix a moment. Then add more flour
until it's just right for you.

For non-food items, a lot of people turn their noses up at dollar stores
(why, I don't know).  I don't buy cleaning products or other every day
household items at the grocery store.  I go to the dollar store.  Of course
not everything is a dollar!  But yes, they have name brand items and are
much cheaper than what a grocery store charges for the same thing.

They aren't &quot;factory seconds&quot;.  There may be two, three, even four aisles in
a grocery store devoted to everyday household non-food items.  Dollar stores
pretty much stock the whole store with these things.  It's their bread and
butter, so to speak :)  They buy in bulk so they get (and offer) much better
prices.  And I have to repeat, they are name brands.  Sure, you can get the
&quot;generic&quot; dollar store label for a few cents less.  But that's not all they
sell, not by a long shot.

I'm not a stickler for name brand items.  There are a few things, but for
household cleaning items, paper towels, soap... if I find the quality is
just as good it doesn't matter to me what name is on the packaging.  If I
don't like the quality I don't buy it again.  Simple as that :)

&gt; &gt;&gt; Your needs also contain being able to mix something up when you are tired
&gt; &gt;&gt; and hungry which means some 'fast prep' things will want to slip in.  For
&gt; &gt;&gt; example, it takes time to boil a potato to done.  Canned ones arent as
&gt; &gt;&gt; good,
&gt; &gt;&gt; but you can pretty much just reheat them.

&gt; &gt; You aren't suggesting that canned potatoes are EVER an option, are
&gt; &gt; you?

&gt; In his circumstances?  Possibly so.  I'd find the crockpot route more handy
&gt; but if you notice, he's only got limited time.  This isnt someone who can
&gt; sous-chef or spend 4 hours making a fancy meal every night.  Alot of recipes
&gt; work fine for just simple dinner and call for some cooked potatoes.  Thats
&gt; what canned ones are.  Not as cheap or good as fresh cooked, but they work
&gt; in a pinch.

&gt; I usually have a can or 2 on hand for a fast need.  I also have potato
&gt; flakes but they get used more as breading on in a bread batch.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Here's a time saver for potatoes.  Get a crockpot with a removable liner
&gt; &gt;&gt; (easier to clean by far and you dont have time to muck with the other
&gt; &gt;&gt; type).

&gt; &gt; Mmm!  No suggestion to drain the ground beef, and double mmm, it uses
&gt; &gt; process cheese.  YeeHaw!

&gt; I realize that the recipe doent tell you to drain the beef but is it needed
&gt; to spell everything out?  As to 'process cheese' if you look up 'American'
&gt; on wikipedia you will come up with that definition but in some parts of the
&gt; country (of which he is in one of them) there is a real cheese that's a
&gt; medium cheddar which goes by that name.  It's a little softer than aged
&gt; cheddar, but is hardly velveeta or anything like that.  Its very close to
&gt; wisconsin chedder.
">

Wikipedia says:
&quot;The common use of the marketing label &quot;American Cheese&quot; for
'processed cheese' combined with the prevalence of processed cheese in
the U.S. compared to the rest of the world has led to the term
American cheese being used in the United States synonymously in place
of processed cheese. Moreover, the term 'American cheese' has a legal
definition as a type of pasteurized process cheese under the U.S. Code
of Federal Regulations. The legal definition is discussed in the
article on processed cheese.&quot;

So, do you happen to know that in his &quot;Three States Area,&quot; real cheese
is called &quot;American&quot;??  In any case, when you list American cheese,
nearly everyone assumes process cheese.

&gt; &gt;&gt; MMMMM

&gt; &gt;&gt; This is good but better with red wine vinigar and I'd use 4TB vice 6.  I
&gt; &gt;&gt; dont bother with the bacon as you cant tell it's in there.  Want it
&gt; &gt;&gt; faster?
&gt; &gt;&gt; Remember above and the pre-cooked potatoes?  This is practically heat and
&gt; &gt;&gt; eat stuff.  Not haute cuisine, but good simple solid stuff.  Reduce the
&gt; &gt;&gt; recipe to 1/4 of each thing there and you have a fast skillet supper for
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Reduce by just half and you have a lunch to take wirh you next day

&gt; &gt; Maybe she thinks that West Virginians are ignorant bumpkins all, and

&gt; No, but i think posting an idea of a recipe is a good thing from time to
&gt; time, especially when the thread (you did read it right?) showed he needed
&gt; fast tthings that fit his budget and time allowances.

LOL! - Hey, I'm a California gal, and in my young years (when I was
once a bride), we sometimes lived on road kill, and wild mustard
greens!  The father, of most of my children, back then, wasn't always
the Great Hunter, that he portrayed himself to be!

I remember one wild turkey in particular, which &quot;happened&quot; to get hit,
as we were driving down the road;-D  The outcome of that little
cooking caper, made me feel sorry for the Pilgrims on the first
Thanksgiving!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have not heard of Penzeys.  Is that an online order place?  Or a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; local place to where you are?  Meantime, its the variety that adds
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I didnt mention my spice mixes but i was happy to find Fumi
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Furikake in both Ebi (shrimp) and wasabi versions.  I'm used to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mixing my own but it's hard to get the raw ingredients here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Would you happen to have a web pag for penzeys?  I'd like to check
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them out and am about to google for them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, it's Penzeys.com.  Many people here get their spices from
&gt;&gt;&gt; them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; nancy

&gt;&gt; Yep, Penzey's is online. www.penzeys.com It's only &quot;local&quot; in some
&gt;&gt; places.
&gt;&gt; We got a Penzey's in Germantown, TN a few years ago.  Before that I
&gt;&gt; ordered
&gt;&gt; from them online.  Far superior to grocery store herbs and spices
&gt;&gt; which have
&gt;&gt; been sitting in a warehouse for who knows how long.  There's also
&gt;&gt; www.thespicehouse.com You may have local ethnic markets which have
&gt;&gt; some of
&gt;&gt; the things you can't find elsewhere.

&gt;&gt; Jill

&gt; I've often wondered just how long Penzey's stuff have been sitting,
&gt; also. But that's just my mind working overtime, I guess.

Not necessarily.  I wondered about that until they opened a Penzey's in
Germantown, TN.  Walked in, Oh.My.God.!  The wonderful aromas!  The little
jars they had set out on every aisle so you could taste, sample, savour the
aromas.  Forget about potpourri in your bathroom.  Set out jars of these
herbs!  It was heaven just walking in the door :)

Oh, and I think some folks neglected to mention, store dried herbs and
spices in the freezer.

I even store Persia's dried catnip in there.  I take it out and shake a
little bit into her velcro &quot;sock&quot; every few weeks and she goes nuts over it.
Cat Fancy magazine also recommends you store a few kitty toys they've lost
interest in in a baggie with some freshly dried catnip.  It certainly does
renew their interest!

&gt; Hi!
&gt; I am moving out very soon, I will be living by myself. How much should

That should be plenty to budget for most items.  You'll be able to
eat quite well on that, even if you use part of it to eat out once or
twice a week.

I spend about that much for a family of three for groceries, with
dinner at Mom's once a week and dinner out once a week.  We do
eat fairly low on the food chain, with fish, tofu, and vegetarian
entrees several nights a week.

Good luck

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Steve.  I'm a breadmaker though some might disagree as
&gt;&gt;&gt; I use a breadmaker machine.

&gt;&gt; I think they are fine. I just wish the loaves were bigger.
&gt;&gt; My husband eats that much bread in one meal. Sometimes I
&gt;&gt; want some too.

&gt;what size loaf does your machine make? mine makes a 2 pound
&gt;loaf &amp; while i love fresh bread, there's no way i could eat a
&gt;whole 2 pound loaf ;)
&gt; my mom gave me the bread machine &amp; a bread machine
&gt;cookbook... only problem is the book is for a 1-1.5 pound
&gt;machine &amp; i generally don't want to bother futzing with the
&gt;math to get it to work... plus i keep forgetting i have the
&gt;machine &amp; keep making bread like i always have ;)
">

I'm the only person I know who can't use a bread machine.  I borrowed
a friend's machine because she was going on and on about how wonderful
it was.  All I ever made was bricks.  I had all fresh ingredients and
used the recipe book religiously.... at least I didn't waste my money
on one before I found out I sucked at machine bread.

I'm also the only person I know who can't make decent banana bread.
