They can be flown from either the front or the back position, but
according to one maven:

&quot;Anyway, I'd venture to say that the visibility for taxiing is much
better from the aft seat, and for general flight, better from the
front. However, maybe weight and balance comes into play when you are
the sole occupant in a two seater, hence the rear seat is preferable.&quot;

All round visibility is better from the back seat when in flight according
to several pilots I talked to &lt;mumble&gt; years ago.

IANAPilot.  I have been told that it is a balance issue -- the rear seat
is aft of the center of gravity and is always occupied to balance the
weight of the nose.  The second seat is near the center of gravity and so
does not affect the fore-and-aft balance of the aircraft much if it is
occupied or vacant.

IANAP either, but I can't see balance being a major factor.  Did
planes of that day have trim flaps?  Even if not, surely it's just a
case of using the normal flaps to compensate?  They'd have to do that
anyway if the front seat were vacant/occupied, or if the plane were
carrying significant cargo or munitions.

My own opinion, for what little it's worth, is that it was largely
down to the overall configurations of those early birds.  Tricycle
undercarriage (giving a nose-up attitude on the ground), a relatively
large engine nacelle - it's going to be damned hard to see if you're
too far forwards on the fuselage.

So my vote's with the visibility thing, at least on the ground.  Once
in the air, levelled off, it's much less of a factor - but then a lot
of those planes (eg the Fairey Swordfish and other bombers) had the
front seat allocated to a observer who directed the pilot to observed
ground positions.

I've been struggling to remember the specific details of the
successful Swordfish torpedo attack on the Bismarck, but IIRC it goes
something like this:

The observer up front guided the pilot towards the ship and shouted
instructions to get the plane on course horizontally.  The pilot in
the meantime was watching the waves below, controlling the vertical
and looking for a trough into which to launch the torpedo (helps
ensure it doesn't get knocked off course on impact).  The torpedo was
launched by the pilot.  All this was SOP.

IIRC, as they got closer and closer to the ship (and its AA fire), the
observer was getting a bit freaked out and wondering why the pilot
hadn't launched by now so they could get away from the AA.  He assumed
at the time that the pilot hadn't found any decent wave conditions to
launch into; it turned out later that the pilot had actually been
wanting to get as close as possible to the ship to ensure a hit; the
waves were just fine.

These were relatively light aircraft: A 150 pound passenger is 5% of the
maximum take off weight for a PT-17 Stearman[1] biplane and 12% of the
gross weight of a Piper J3 Cub[2] monoplane, so the fore-n-aft position in
the aircraft does make a difference as does changes in fuel loads.
Again, IANAPilot, but I gather that the center of gravity affects stall
characteristics and that you can adjust trim for level flight but not the
stall behavior.  I'll happily bow to those with better information.

This fragment of a conversation [3] says:

[quote]-----------------------------
You must fly the aircraft in accordance with the Flying Manual/Pilot's
Operating Handbook.

Some FM/POHs state that the aircraft must be flown solo from the rear seat
for CofG purposes eg, Piper Cub. However, I've never seen a FM/POH which
states the aircraft must be flown solo from the left seat.
[unquote]--------------------------

The early 40 horsepower Cub &quot;needed to be flown solo from the rear seat
for reasons of balance&quot;.[4]

This fragment of a conversation [5] supports the passenger closer to the
center of gravity idea:

[quote]---------------------------
If you think about it, thats the best &quot;consistent&quot; spot for the pilot
(rear). The passenger sits closer to the CG in the front, so has a less
effect than a rear seated passenger. If the plane were balanced with a
front seated pilot, think of the CG shift when a passenger got behind him.
In front, it does shift, but not nearly as much.

There weren't all that many tricycle-geared biplanes, though, apart from
the Curtis JN-4 Jenny and a few others, most airplanes (western ones,

the ground in a tail-dragger was poor to nil.

Sorry - I misused &quot;tricycle&quot;.  I meant the ones with the little rear
wheels, not the P-38 Lightning type of configuration. &quot;Tail-draggers&quot;,
presumably, is the correct term.

You know, that might be a real factor.

I once flew as passenger in a glider, and the pilot was in the front
seat.  The rear seat, where I was, didn't have controls.  The first
thing he said to me as we were preparing to take off was &quot;don't touch
the wires&quot;.

Sure enough, on each side of the rear compartment was a load of steel
wires, presumably for controlling the flaps and ailerons and rudder
and so on, and it was difficult to avoid, say, resting a knee against
one of them by accident and inducing a roll or something.

No, the old biplanes had controls both in the front and rear seats.
Your glider experience was different; the pilot sat in the front seat
because that's where the tow line release is, and the pilot is not
going to trust a passenger to release the line at the right moment.

&gt; I hadn't realised this was a significant factor at all until my first
&gt; (and only) helicopter ride.  It was a Bell Jet Ranger, with three
&gt; seats behind and a vacant co-pilot's seat in front; there were four
&gt; passengers including myself.

&gt; Before boarding, we were all weighed, and the seating allocated
&gt; according to our weights.  I was give the co-pilot's seat because I
&gt; was the nearest of the passengers to the pilot's weight.

&gt; Turned out to be a good thing - we were overflying the Grand Canyon,
&gt; and from the front seats you can see almost straight down, as well as
&gt; excellent visibility to the front and the sides.

&gt; In retrospect, I feel sorry for the woman in the middle of the rear
&gt; seats, though - not only did she have a relatively crappy view, but
&gt; she was presumably put there because her weight was an outlier on the
&gt; distribution.  IOW, she was either heavier or lighter than the other
&gt; four (pilot included) - I forget which.

&gt; That was my understanding of how it worked, anyway.

&gt; As for fixed-wing aircraft, I didn't realise that weight distribution
&gt; was that much of an issue - I'd assumed that trimming flaps during the
&gt; flight would compensate.

&gt; All of which leads to a question:

&gt; You're a helo pilot, a slim and short one, an ex-jockey or something,
&gt; and you have to ferry a supersized giant of a man to somewhere for a
&gt; stomach-stapling operation.  He weighs more than twice your weight.
&gt; Your helo is a two-seater.  So how do you balance it?

The one and only time I rode in a helicopter was from Saunders Roe in
Cowes in the Isle of Wight over to Eastleigh airport at Southampton.  No
ritual was involved, I don't remember how many people were on board but we
just piled in and off we went.

I had been working over there for a consortium who were considering an
America's Cup challenge and had been testing an electro-mechanical VMG
computer I had built for them, partly afloat in an elderly 12-metre called
Norsaga and partly in their ship testing tank.  It just happened that the
chopper was going across when I needed to get back to the mainland.

My wife's employer tossed a dozen or so helicopter tours into the door
prize mix at a company party once.  My wife won.  She was always
extremely conscious of her weight and didn't want to go, in case there
were some balancing embarrassments like John's co-passenger.  The
company asked if she wanted to designate someone to take her flight
for her, so she sent me.  I weighed more than she did, but don't worry
nearly so much about it.

When the time came to board, everyone was weighed, but they didn't
keep track of which one was which.  I think they just wanted a total
load weight.  When we boarded, I was given the other front seat
because of better leg room.  But the fancy (five point?) harness
wouldn't cover my waist, so I got relegated to the back seat.  Nobody
seemed worried about swapping a 325 pound guy with a 120 pound woman
from the back to the front.  The back seats just had a simple lap belt
that fit with no problems.

I remember that one.  Mulcahy rode on the outside, in one of the

There was nothing digital about it at all, pure analogue, just like the
Anti-Aircraft Gun predictors I worked on in the Army.  It consisted of
three servos tracking Apparent wind speed and direction, which is all you
can measure directly from a moving boat, and boat speed through the water,
V Actual in that diagram, from a trailed log.  Synchro resolvers then did
the trigonometry to extract true wind speed and direction, the latter as
rotation of another resolver and finally produce a voltage representing
VMG.  What I was doing in the testing tank was calibrating the log.

A resolver is physically very similar to an electric motor.  The ones I
used were fed with 400Hz AC and were quite small, 1.5in diameter; the old
1950s predictor used 3in ones on 50Hz.  Its stator has two precision
windings at exactly 90 degrees to each other.  The rotor likewise, one of
its windings being used to provide an error signal to a servo which causes
the rotor to line up with the field produced by feeding X and Y voltages
into the stator windings.  Alternatively you can feed a voltage onto one
of the stator windings and extract the sine and cosine of the angle it is
set at from the stator windings.

That is how it was used in the predictor, to turn slant range and
elevation from the radar first into ground range and height and then in a
second resolver fed with the computed ground range and bearing from the
radar into eastings and northings.  E, N and H vary linearly even though
the slant range and direction are far from linear as the target flies by
making prediction of its future position relatively easy.  Further
resolver magic then combines Ef, Nf and Hf to give the bearing and
elevation to point the guns and the fuse setting to set on the shells the
instant before they are fired, though that was obsolete really since the
proximity fuse came along.

I still have the schematics of the predictor but not of the VMG computer,
I would have to think for a while to figure out exactly how it worked.

The example of this that I always remember is news footage of the

pilot's request to land aboard was denied so he dropped his passengers in
the water near a boat, flew off a little way, locked the throttle in a
hover about 20' up and bailed out.  The change in weight and balance put
the Huey into a sideways slip until the rotor made contact with the water,
then it cartwheeled.  The pilot survived.

I recall reading somewhere that the US Army, Navy, Air Force, and
Marines each use a different slang term for their helicopters -- the
four words being &quot;heli&quot;, &quot;helo&quot;, &quot;chopper&quot;, and &quot;copter&quot;, but I forget
which was which.  I can't find a web site that confirms this, though,
so maybe it's not entirely true.

While looking for one, I came across an article that pointed out that
neither &quot;heli&quot; nor &quot;copter&quot; is an etymological element of the word, which
is derived from the same roots seen in &quot;helical&quot; and &quot;pteranodon&quot;.
