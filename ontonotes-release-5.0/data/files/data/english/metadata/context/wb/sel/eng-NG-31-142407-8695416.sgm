and 49 other things you may not know

21st July, 2004 Amended by BreakForNews.com

I just finished Daniel Hopsicker's Welcome to Terrorland. He exposes the cover story of
the Florida flight schools, and the ongoing cover-up.

The whole thing stinks of Iran/Contra and CIA drugs. It's the same, bloody game.

Though his style can be annoyingly breezy, I highly recommend the book. There's original
research you won't find anywhere else but here and on his website:
http://www.madcowprod.com .

FYI, here are some notes I kept while reading the book:

. 1. In Venice Florida, Mohamed Atta lived for two months with an American
stripper/lingerie model named Amanda Keller.

. 2. Atta loved to party. He was out with Keller nearly every night they were
together. He was a heavy drinker, snorted coke, was a stylish dresser and wore expensive
jewelry.

. 3. According to Keller, Atta loved pork chops.

. 4. Keller dumped him after he embarrassed her at a night club by dancing, poorly,
atop a speaker (&quot;doing that old 'Roxbury head bob' thing, you know&quot;?)

. 5. Atta revenged himself later on Keller by returning to the apartment they'd
shared and killing her cat and kittens, disemboweling and dismembering them in her
apartment for her to find.

. 6. In Miami, Atta consorted with women known to be linked to the Mafia.

. 7. Atta's email list included names of people who worked for defense contractors.
One, for instance, worked for Canadian firm Virtual Prototypes, which helped develop the
avionics for F-15, F-22 and B-2.

. 8. Atta was enrolled as a student at the International Officer's School of Maxwell
Airforce Base, and witnesses recall him having been introduced around at an officers'
club party.

. 9. Atta was fluent in at least Arabic, English, German, French and Hebrew.

. 10. One day when Atta was rummaging through his flight bag, Keller got a look
inside. Her words:

&quot;The thing the FBI was most interested in was his pilot bag. They asked about it a lot.
He kept it locked, and they wanted to know whether I had ever seen anything in it. I
told them yes. One day he opened it briefly, and there were a lot of papers in it, and
there was a blue log book in a different language. Mohamed was fluent in almost any
language you can think of. He had a kind of Daytimer in there, too. And a folder with
all these different ID's in it. And that's when I saw one - because it fell out - a
little blue and white thing the size of a driver's license. It had his picture on it,
and it looked like a mug shot, or a prison shot. And it didn't look like him, and I
asked him, 'Who is this?'

&quot;And he said, 'that's me.' He told me it had been taken back when he was in some kind of
militia-type deal, like a military-type deal, he said. He compared it to our military
only they teach you different tactics. He didn't elaborate.

&quot;He didn't say where it was from, either. But the writing looked like a cross between
Hebrew and Arabic, those frilly little lines. He told me he spoke Hebrew. I said
bullshit. So he started speaking it, and I guess he did.

&quot;He told me that he went to different countries and studied. He had pilot's license from
several different countries. But all the pictures looked different. All the names were
different. He had a license to fly from just about every country he had been to. He went
to pilot's school in all these countries.&quot;

. 11. Atta, Keller, a stripper named Linda and two Germans partied for three days in
Key West. Atta paid for everything. Rented three rooms, one just for the men's luggage,
which Keller says contained drugs. The men had a business meeting the women were not
permitted to attend. Met with people, Keller says, who flew in just to meet Atta. Somber
and quiet after meeting. (Key West Airport a known drug transit point. The Sheriff used
to be under orders to keep the dope sniffing dogs off airplanes, and at one time even
sent patrol cars to escort the drugs to Miami.)

The German revelers in Key West were a brother team - two pilots from Munich who had
known Atta for some years. They were Stephen and Peter Verhaaren. Amanda had been led to
believe Stephan and Peter were Austrian. She only knew these European friends of Atta by
first names. Through records from the various airport authorites Lois Ann Battuello, a
researcher working with Hopsicker stumbled onto Wolfgang's last name; and through his
sale of a business to Stephan, was able to identify these two, for example. With the
last names in tow, Daniel then began making contacts at the Naples Airport where these
individuals were well known.

. 12. Atta was a licensed pilot at least during the months of March and April 2001
when he lived with Amanda Keller. He had the privileges of an instructor while he was at
Huffman Aviation, and may have helped pilot South American drug runs.

. 13. The FBI timeline says Atta left Venice Florida in December 2000 after
completing his flight training. But he didn't. Dozens of locals say different - his
landlord, neighbours, cab drivers, restaurant employees and his girlfriend, for a few
instances - and have been told not to talk about it by federal authorities. The FBI
publicly sought information regarding Atta's time in various US locations, but not
Venice Florida, where he spent most of his time in the US. Why the intentional
misdirection? What are they trying to keep hidden?

. 14. Under pressure from the FBI, and despite numerous witnesses who had known them
together, Keller publicly retracted her story of having lived with Atta, saying he'd
been another hijacker named Mohammed, no last name, who seems to have only existed to
get Atta out of this story that didn't fit the official version.

. 15. On September 8th, 2001 --the Saturday before the 9/11 attacks, at a bar called
Shuckums in Ft Lauderdale, Atta and two companions got drunk. The FBI showed up at the
bar just 12 hours after the attack with pictures of two of them, one Atta, saying only
&quot;they were on the plane and passed away.&quot; Manager Tony Amos and bartender Patricia
Idrissi identified both. Manager Amos said they'd gotten &quot;wasted,&quot; Atta drank Stoli
vodka for three straight hours. Atta blasphemed: &quot;F*ck God!&quot; he's said to have cursed.

. 16. The witnesses then retracted the story of Atta being drunk. They now said he'd
only drank cranberry juice the entire evening. Both Amos and Idrissi have gone, no one
knows where, but the current bartender says she believes their leaving was somehow 9/11
related.

. 17. Fourteen of the 9/11 hijackers made Florida their base of operation, and
clustered around two flight schools. What is it about Florida, and these flight schools,
that drew them?

. 18. Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi paid $28,000 each to Rudi Dekkers' Huffman Aviation
for flight instruction that, the chief instructor of a neighbouring school said, was
available at dozens of other nearby locations for a fraction of the price. Why did they
pay an inflated price to Dekkers?

. 19. Dekkers' and his financier, Wally Hilliard, purchased the flight school just
months before Atta and the other hijackers began arriving. Before their purchase, the
flight school catered to largely American students. After, student body became 80%
foreign, mostly Middle Eastern. Yeslam bin Laden, Osama's brother, sent students there
for his business.

. 20. Atta also frequented Arne Kruithof's Florida Flight Training Center, a block
away from Huffman Aviation. Amanda Keller says it is where he would go to replenish his
cocaine stash.

. 21. Though Dutchmen Dekkers and Kruithof claimed they had not known each other
before each coincidently purchased flight training schools in Venice shortly before
terrorists began arriving for training, witnesses claim the two had known each other
well for years before.

. 22. Wally Hilliard is a supposedly-retired, born again insurance executive from the
Midwest (motto for his insurance company had been &quot;Hate Sin, Fight Communism, Back the
Pack!&quot;), who upon arriving in Florida entered into aviation businesses with an
assortment of criminal and covert intelligence elements.

. 23. Dekkers and Hilliard had not been in the flight school business before they
made the purchase. They paid an inflated price for the school, and did no due diligence
before the purchase. They lost millions, but this was apparently not a problem. Charlie
Voss, former employee of Dekkers and an Iran/Contra pilot who'd also flown &quot;Northern
Alliance guys&quot; in Afghanistan in the 1980s, and who had given Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi
a place to stay for a few weeks when they first arrived in Venice Florida: &quot;Rudi's
greedy, and when you're greedy you can be used for something.... When something doesn't
make obvious business sense, sometimes it's because things are being done for another
reason that doesn't have a lot to do with dollars and cents. His business did not add
up.&quot;

. 24. Dekkers went from broke to flush very quickly, without having business success
with the flight school. One observer said &quot;He didn't even have the money to buy gas for
an airplane. and yet a year later he shows up and plops a million seven, a million eight
or two million dollars on the table as if it were paper money.&quot;

. 25. The deputy in charge of Venice Fl airport security: &quot;Wally and Rudi never talk
inside a building, they go out to an airplane and talk inside the plane.&quot;

. 26. Dekkers' claimed he had very little interaction with Atta, and that he never
saw him again after December 2000. But numerous witnesses in Venice claim Dekkers and
Atta were close, and were seen at a restaurant together just two weeks before the
attack.

. 27. Hilliard denied knowing Atta. Keller recalled, on a visit to the airport,
having Hilliard ask her, &quot;What's a nice girl like you doing with a guy like Mohamed?&quot;

. 28. Before the attack, Dekkers was having trouble paying rent on flight school. It
was so bad, it was a story in the Venice paper when he paid rent. One month before
attack, he stopped having trouble. Since attack, every aviation concern at Venice
airport has been late at least once with their monthly rent, except for Dekkers'.

. 29. Both the DEA and US Customs had been interested in Dekkers as far back as 1993.
He was suspected of smuggling drugs and computer chips.

. 30. In early July, 2004 about the same time as Atta and Marwan Al-Shehi began
flying lessons at Huffman Aviation, a Lear jet owned by its financier, Wally Hilliard,
carrying 43 pounds of heroin was seized by the DEA. In news reports later that month,
authorities called it the biggest seizure of heroin ever in central Florida.

. 31. The passengers, Venezuelan nationals, were arrested, but the pilot wasn't
charged, said a DEA spokesman, &quot;because of lack of evidence.&quot; This, despite the fact the
pilot, Diego Levine-Texar, ignored agents demands that he drop his cell phone, which had
to be pried from his hand at gunpoint. Affidavit of the DEA agent: &quot;Based on my
experience I know that narcotics traffickers maintain frequent contact with one another
while transporting narcotics. I believe Levine-Texar attempted to contact other
accomplices as to the presence of agents and other law enforcement officials.&quot;
Information about Levine-Texar is considered &quot;sensitive.&quot;

. 32. But the DEA refused to return the plane to Hilliard. The DEA wanted to use the
plane for drug interdiction. The lender took possession of the plane and sold it.
Unusual for a so-called &quot;innocent man&quot; to be denied the return of his possession, or
compensation.

. 33. After Hilliard lost his plane to the DEA auction, he was loaned a plane worth
$2 million for just one dollar by Truman Arnold, former chief fundraiser for the
Democratic Party, who figured in the Whitewater investigation.

. 34. John Villada, an aviation executive in Naples Florida: &quot;After Wally's plane was
impounded with the heroin and his pilots had machine guns stuck in their faces, the DEA
came to visit our maintenance facility and Wally shouted out to me - right in front of
the DEA guy - 'Make sure all the heroin and cocaine gets hidden!'&quot; Hilliard's mock
warning seemed to show the DEA how little he thought of them, and how well he was
protected.

. 35. The paperwork showed the same plane had made approximately 30 weekly round
trips to Venezuela with the same passengers, and they always paid cash. &quot;They obviously
weren't even bothering to hide what they were doing,&quot; said one observer.

. 36. Hilliard had got his confiscated Lear jet from World Jet Inc, owned by drug
smuggling brothers Don and Bill Whittington, who had supplied a Lear to CIA drug
smuggler Barry Seal that they took back before his arrest and murder. The Whittington
Brothers are now in Club Fed and have been for years since their trials in the
mid-1980s.

. 37. The Sarasota County Drug interdiction people were told that Dekkers and
Hilliard had a green light to operation and that they were to stay away from them, that
they... may have had some type of government protection. And the local Venice Police
Department were also warned to leave them alone.

. 38. A former Huffman executive, speaking about the hijackers: &quot;Early on I gleaned
that these guys had government protection. They were let into this country for a
specific purpose. It was a business deal.&quot;

. 39. The FBI visited the home of this executive just four hours after the attacks.
The purpose has been not to investigate, but to intimidate him into silence. The man
says his phones were bugged, and thinks pilots were &quot;double agents.&quot; He quit the flight
school fearing for his life, and claims he knows too much about Wally Hillier, saying he
&quot;has a family to think about.&quot;

. 40. The FBI removed the flight school records on the early morning of September 12.
According to Venice Police officers, they were taken in two Ryder trucks from Venice
that drove to the Sarasota International Airport and these trucks were driven onto a
Florida Air National Guard C-130 transport that was greeted by Jeb Bush who hopped on
board.

Jeb had signed an Executive Order the morning of Sept. 11 declaring a state of emergency
based on terrorist attacks. This allowed that Florida Air National Guard planes could
land at public vs. military airports. Furthermore, Jeb immediately placed his Florida
Department of Law Enforcement &quot;in charge&quot; of an investigation into the terrorist
presence in Florida. MOST of the witnesses intervewied were NOT interviewed by the FBI,
rather they were interviewed and likewise threatened by members of Jeb's Florida
Department of Law Enforcement.

. 41. Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris have flown and endorsed Hilliard's air carrier.

. 42. In the days following 9/11, a number of Saudis fled the country from Florida
after the attacks. They flew on Wally Hillier's charter aircraft to private fields of
military contractor Raytheon, and departed on a 747.

. 43. After the attacks, a virtually non-existent company that operated out of Venice
Airport under Huffman's license called Britannia Aviation was awarded a five-year,
multi-million dollar contract to run the maintenance facility at Lychburg Virginia
Regional Airport. (FYI, Lynchburg is the home of Jerry Falwell's Liberty Baptist
University.) Britannia did not have an FAA license to work on planes and showed assets
of only $750. It was chosen over Virginia Aviation, which showed a multi-million dollar
balance and boasted more than 40 employees.

. 44. Britannia executive Peter Martens boasted that his company had been providing
maintenance at Venice Airport for &quot;Caribe Air,&quot; which is a notorious CIA proprietary
carrier.

. 45. A source at the Drug Enforcement Agency says that Britannia has a &quot;green light&quot;
from the DEA, and that local police had been warned to leave Britannia alone.

. 46. Martens also has ties to Falwell, having met his wife at his university in
Lynchburg.

. 47. Many of the Venice flight trainers moonlight by flying &quot;missionary flights&quot; to
Central and South America, for such organizations as Pat Robertson's Operation Hope.
(Are mission groups being used as fronts for covert ops?)

. 48. Most of Atta's closest associates in Venice were not Arabs, but Europeans with
connection to the drug trade.

&lt; http://www.BreakForNews.com/iraqatrix.htm &gt; Â  Â . 49. Though flight school owners
Dekkers and Kruithof had before crashed, within weeks of each other in 2002, both had
near fatal crashes. Wreckage was destroyed before it could be examined.

. 50. According to his girlfriend, Atta was a big Beastie Boys fan.
