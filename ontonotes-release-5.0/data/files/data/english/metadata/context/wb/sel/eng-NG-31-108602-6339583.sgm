I am starting a new thread because the other was going no where because
it was Jay who posted the original article.  If I had posted the same
thing I doubt as many would have taken offense by it.

I agree with Jay.  I could care if they get accreditation because I
assure you I can and will be accredited.  I have never seen so many
people puff their chests up about how good work they do, and then have
no self esteem to think that they can pass the test.

If somehow they get accreditation, believe me, our salaries will rise.
If our salaries rise, then all of you will be scrambling just to see
how fast they can get accredited and wishing that they hadn't waited so
long.

Now where I disagree with Jay and that is that there are enough people
that can do the quality of work that higher ups think we need to do in
order to be accredited.  I just don't know if it is because certain
people have it, or if it is because I have been doing it for so many
years that I swear I can transcribe anything.

I think there is more to the story of these autopsy errors.  I am not
sure that the work was done in the states, or even done by MTs.  He
said it was transcription errors, but anyone can say that whether they
have their work transcribed or not.

I sure hope not to ever see any of my accounts sued and have them have
to say, well that is an obvious transcription error.

Nothing personal, Janice, but I can assure you that, IN
MY CASE, not being accredited has nothing to do with
self esteem.  It's simply not necessary and, unless I
have to waste the time and money on it, it's not gonna
happen here.  If the day comes that it is necessary, I
would be most happy to take it and, I'm sure, pass.
People can talk the talk all they want to about a
useless piece of paper which basically doesn't prove
squat to anyone but themselves.

Marsha,

You misread my intent, either that or I haven't said it exactly like I
should have.  I am not advocating accreditation.  I am not working for
or against it.  No one has asked my opinion.  Some days when I see some
of the help boards I think we should have accreditation, but then I
think schools need a preadmitance test.

I am not taking the CMT or RMT.  What I said, was that should it
happen, I will make sure that I can pass it, instead of bemoan the fact
that it has happened.  I don't think that the piece of paper proves
anything as far as being "the best of the best", but I believe there
are current MTs who are transcribing and shouldn't be.  I believe that
accreditation would weed out some of the very worst and I don't see
that as a bad thing.  I also believe that some of those who think that
they are great MTs couldn't pass the critical thinking part of an
accreditation test.

Janice, I am one who thinks that you *have to have it* in order to work in
this field.  It is inborne and doing what I have done, I have seen some
pretty amazing things come from people who say they have been MTs for over 5
years...and I am not saying that meaning I was impressed.  You also cannot
give them feedback as they refuse to take it telling you that they know it
all.

You see naturals every now and then who catch on quickly, but some just lack
the uh...common sense...to know or evaluate the difference of the soundalike
medical words and do not bother to try.

Now, those autopsy errors would knock you down reading about them!

I wish I could agree that credentialing and anything else to add a more
professional flair to the field would raise salaries, but personally, I
don't think anything is going to raise those salaries.  My personal opinion
and after speaking with quite a number of MTSOs is that it just will not
happen.  I would love to be wrong on this, but in the future, it is my guess
that the only people who are left doing MT work will be the ones that love
it so much that you could not tear them away from it and they do not need
the money due to another income in the family or for some other reason.

My big problem with the CMT test is the time limit.   I'm a self-taught

I believe there are MTs and CMTs transcribing who shouldn't be. From the
reports I've heard, however, the CMT does not measure anything relative
to this at all. General knowledge. Someone could have memorized
Dorland's and still be a crappy MT.

I don't know much about AAMT or the exam, but I don't believe that speed has

Lack of speed is a self-correcting issue.  If an MT is unable to be

Well, the dumbest things about the test are the fact that there is *no*
pedal--you have to mouse to work the sound files--and they allow zero
reference materials. How many MTs have memorized everything--and without
those expansions you've been honing for the last decade or two, what
happens when you're stuck on a tricky spelling you remember as a simple
key combination? The biggest requisite skill is the ability to RESEARCH!
Yeah, the transcription clips they have you do are short (not sure how
that proves much in the way of transcription skills), but overall, it
doesn't sound like it reflects the skills needed to do the job. I'm
afraid they sacrificed too much in distilling this down to a format that
could be administered by a third party and would yield immediate scores.

I also remember reading through a sample page of the study guide a while
back and I couldn't believe the weirdly random crap they were suggesting
you study--in a whole page, I don't think there was one thing I've
encountered in 3 years of acute care.

I'd originally thought I'd go for the credential just for my own
satisfaction, but after sifting through all the crap from Modesto and
analyzing the benefits of that investment (i.e. most likely NONE), I
totally got over that. I think they've created this sinking ship and
it's pretty much time for us to paddle our little lifeboats as far away
from the wake as possible before they go WHOOOSH.

The only entity that could've worked toward making our jobs acknowledged
as important by implementing a meaningful credential has failed miserably.

As Queen P pointed out, the word boards are full of examples of how the
schools have failed to teach--and how, despite some glaring illiteracy
(not just medical terminology, but plain, ol' English!), there are some
employers willing to hire nitwits simply because it looks good on the
balance sheet. If you never venture far from SMT and never do QA, you'd
probably be shocked by what passes as employable these days. . .

I am a very fast typist, always have been since I learned how to type
in junior high school on a manual typewriter, without letters/numbers
on the keys.  LOL

My first job interview on an electric typewriter, I had MANY errors, me
being used to banging those manual keys pretty hard.  It was quite
depressing at the time.

If I had to take a test today where I had to take my hand off the
keyboard and use the mouse during the test, it would slow me down for
sure.

In today's transcription world with the shorthand macro programs, it
does help to accelerate one's speed.  I only use about 300-plus
"regular" words in my shorthand macro program, but I couldn't imagine
working without it. ;&gt;)

When I was younger, I went to take a transcription test at a medical
transcription company in my area.  When the test began, I realized
there was no auto-reverse feature on the transcriber machine.  What a
joke, like someone can type as fast as the person speaking.  I asked
the testing lady about it, and she did not know what an auto-reverse
feature was and looked at me like I was a Kling-on invading the
Starship Enterprise.  Again, I did horrible on this test for the job
interview and did not bother calling them back.  I knew I looked bad on
paper. :&gt;(

I think it is helpful to have some sort of typing speed if you're going
to be in this business.  In my world, we get paid by the page.
Beginners may bang out 5 to 10 pages an hour on relatively easy
content, but if it is a technical job, one requiring a lot of research,
then they would be lucky to earn minimum wage.  With my shorthand macro
program, I average 20 to 30 pages an hour for easy content.  When the
the foreign accents and poor quality audio recordings come into play,
only the veterans survive.  Nobody wants to touch these recordings with
a 10-foot pole, but sometimes you have to take the bad with the good.

In sum, typing speed is important in this racket, but it is not the
only necessary trait.  Attention for detail is just as important, IMHO,
like making an effort to get the words spelled right as opposed to
inserting [ph] and/or [inaudible] throughout a transcript.  When
getting paid by the page, some folks do not like going the extra mile
to look up stuff.

I am not so sure I would agree that SPEED is the only trait one needs
to be successful in the transcription world, but it sure does help.

The only time I had to get certified was for stenotype in the court
reporting arena.  About 30 years later, I am living proof that one does
not need to be certified and/or accredited to be a transcriptionist in
today's transcription world.

Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.  Being on time with the transcript is just
as important as being good.  If you're late, it doesn't matter one iota
how good the transcript is.  JMHO, FWIW!

"My big problem with the CMT test is the time limit.   I'm a

The CMT exam is not about speed.  They give you 5 hours to finish the
test, I think, which is PLENTY.  I think I finished it in a little
under 2 hours.  The test does a good job of measuring what you KNOW,
your fund of retained knowledge.  It also tests your critical thinking
skills.  The audio clips are short and not having a pedal is not really
a factor at all.

Certainly the exam is not perfect in that it does not measure things
like researching skills.  But the reality is that pretty much all
professional competency tests are built on this same model, whether
they're offered by AHIMA or any other professional association.
Prometric, the company who administers the exam, also administers
competency exams for many, many other entities, all using the same
basic model as the CMT/RMT exams.

The bottom line is that someone who has worked in multiple specialties
for a few years and has the knack for MT should be able to pass the CMT
exam.  It's not too easy and it's not too hard, in my opinion, although
it is challenging, no mistake about that.  But that's what tests are
supposed to be.

It's not a self esteem issue with me, Janice. I just would never fool
with it. I don't even know if I could pass the test or not, but I
assume if I studied, I could.

I don't want anybody meddling with my business is all I'm saying.

The other thing is this (I haven't read the other thread yet haven't
gotten back to it) is that if the wages rose, it would then become a
necessary thing for me. Right now it's not.

Before you accuse me of not doing my homework, as you just have, I would
like to let you know that when I did consider taking the test I did
check into it, and at that time there was a time limit for completion.
I will admit that this was a while ago, and I have chosen to not pursue
this matter any further.

I'm not an idiot.  I'm not going to spend money if I think I'm going to
fail, and at that time I would have failed because of the time limit.
After giving it more thought I realized that having CMT after my name
wouldn't really help me in any noticeable way.  My current clients
weren't going to pay me more because of it, and it really doesn't help
get new clients; good references are better for that.  Like most people
here, I know CMTs whose work is of poor quality, and I know other MTs
who aren't CMTs who do some great work.  If I ever get to the point
where it becomes a necessity to have it I'll look into it, but until
then it's not worth it to me.  My clients are happy with my work, and
that's what matters.

Kim, all tests have time limits.  The time limit for the CMT exam I took
was generous (this is when it was the 2-part one, written and
practical).  I am not a fast typist, and I had plenty of time to
review, go back and listen again and check my work.  It's not a speed
contest.

Certification has always been a tough sell to MTs.  Now that AAMT is
linking the idea of certification to patient safety and data integrity,
even more MTs will be running away from this test.  This is simply not
going to fly.  If there ever is mandatory certification of MTs, it
won't certainly won't come through AAMT.

If the CMT credential is mandated - well even if it is not mandatory -
are their sanctions for those who operate their businesses unethically,
i.e., is their a code of ethics a CMT must maintain or be stripped of
it. Seems to me I recall from looking at AAMT information in past there
was for members. Hmmm. Maybe this is on their web site...

&gt; Well, the dumbest things about the test are the fact that there is *no*
&gt; pedal--you have to mouse to work the sound files--and they allow zero
&gt; reference materials. How many MTs have memorized everything--and without
&gt; those expansions you've been honing for the last decade or two, what
&gt; happens when you're stuck on a tricky spelling you remember as a simple
&gt; key combination? The biggest requisite skill is the ability to RESEARCH!
&gt; Yeah, the transcription clips they have you do are short (not sure how
&gt; that proves much in the way of transcription skills), but overall, it
&gt; doesn't sound like it reflects the skills needed to do the job. I'm
&gt; afraid they sacrificed too much in distilling this down to a format that
&gt; could be administered by a third party and would yield immediate scores.

&gt; I also remember reading through a sample page of the study guide a while
&gt; back and I couldn't believe the weirdly random crap they were suggesting
&gt; you study--in a whole page, I don't think there was one thing I've
&gt; encountered in 3 years of acute care.

&gt; I'd originally thought I'd go for the credential just for my own
&gt; satisfaction, but after sifting through all the crap from Modesto and
&gt; analyzing the benefits of that investment (i.e. most likely NONE), I
&gt; totally got over that. I think they've created this sinking ship and
&gt; it's pretty much time for us to paddle our little lifeboats as far away
&gt; from the wake as possible before they go WHOOOSH.

&gt; The only entity that could've worked toward making our jobs acknowledged
&gt; as important by implementing a meaningful credential has failed miserably.

&gt; As Queen P pointed out, the word boards are full of examples of how the
&gt; schools have failed to teach--and how, despite some glaring illiteracy
&gt; (not just medical terminology, but plain, ol' English!), there are some
&gt; employers willing to hire nitwits simply because it looks good on the
&gt; balance sheet. If you never venture far from SMT and never do QA, you'd
&gt; probably be shocked by what passes as employable these days. . .

Y/W. (LOL--I figured I got the rant out of my system and it would be too

I forgot to kvetch about the fact that they also allowed Prometric to
charge whatever they want for the exam out of this country, so that the
offshore MTs taking our work actually get to pay a fraction of what it
costs US MTs. . . Not buying the crap about how their cost of living is
less and they "deserve" a price break, or anything about the exchange
rate--the price is given in US dollars and OUR wages are far below our
own cost of living, no thanks to all the above.

Now that Indian MTs are the only ones who seem to care about the
credential, what does it really mean? Sorry, but if some brainiac should
mastermind a way to require credentials, I hope to hell it's another
entity altogether and they do it right.

Agreed.  And I've always maintained that, after having an ear for this
kind of work, good research skills are paramount in this profession.  In
leaving that completely out of the testing process (no, I don't know how
they could do it effectively and still be able to prevent cheating), I
really don't think it's a true test of MT skills.  No matter how much
you know, there's always going to be a new instrument, procedure,
medication, etc., or something you've just never run across before.  (In
my case, that would include ANYTHING related to ophthalmology - I don't
know why that specialty gives me such fits!!)

And that's why the credential has no credibility as a measure of

I can't agree totally.  A substantial core fund of knowledge and the
ability to exercise critical thinking skills are certainly very
important in an MT, and the CMT exam does measure those factors.  Those
are not the ONLY important factors, we all agree, but the cannot be
discounted either.  Nor should we discount the fact that there are a
number of employers who do recognize the value of the CMT credential,
although not nearly enough of them.

Having said that, I do agree that the existing testing methodology is
not perfect and does not measure everything that needs to be measured
in order to identify competency across the board in MTs.  With all my
heart I believe there's got to be a way to create a testing scenario
that would be more thorough, with all the technology that's available
today.  I would love to be involved in making that a reality, but I
don't know if that will happen.

My observation is that those companies are ones where AAMT mucky-mucks

When I took my CPC exam through AAPC, it was an open book exam, but no
dictionary was used.  During the study course for the exam, we were allowed
to make notations in the coding books for certain definitions that would be
important for each body system, but they had to be written on Post-It notes
so they could be moved over to the new books as issued in October of each
year.  I think I scored a 98 on the medical terminology portion of the exam
and don't recall referring to my notes at all.  The proctor looked in
everyone's coding books to make sure nothing other than what was allowed in
class was added into the books we had with us prior to the exam.

The exam was in 3 parts and I only needed to make reference to the coding
books when looking at a report and needing to pull the correct CPT code(s)
and/or modifiers out of the book, which was the hardest part of the exam.

I agree with what you have posted, JulieW8.  Yes, Jay is right in that
a transcriptionist has to have a core knowledge, BUT hearing and
research skills play a huge part in the equation also.  And, because of
that, they shouldn't be discounted on a test.  I believe one needs
their research tools also.

Often I'll know the answer to a post on, say, the Word Board, but I
have to look up the spelling as the particular specialty or OP
instrument/incision being asked about is one I haven't transcribed for
a long time.  This would be the same on a CMT test; I could easily know
the term, but not remember the spelling offhand.

I've often said that to be good at MT what you know you DO NOT know is
as, or maybe more important than what you do know. Almost all of us now
use expanders, spellchecks, etc., to streamline our work and make it
more accurate. As has been demonstrated by those examples sent around
in email, a whole sentence can be written with seriously transposed
letters and misspellings, and you can STILL read it easily - it's hard
to pick up letter transpositions, etc., proofreading - that's why we
have those tools. I probably couldn't spell separate either, but I seem
to recall my third-grade teacher telling us there was "a rat" in the
middle of it. I know I've grown lazy and rely on Smartype and
spellcheck, knowing I have entered information into them reliably (I
HOPE). That way I can concentrate on the meaning rather than the simple
stuff.

(( also have a lot of expansions just for the things that I can never

I have trouble with words ending ent/ant or ence/ance.  I don't keep a
printed list of words I would otherwise have to look up, but I put them in
my expander so that if I spell them incorrectly they print correctly.

If I were ever to take an accreditation test I would be totally lost on
actual transcription testing without my expander.  If I could not bring my
own laptop with my expander on it I would fail.  I have used it so long, and
have so many frequently-used words and terms in it that I cannot type
without it!  I even use things like th for the.  That word is used so often
that it amounts to a lot of strokes saved at the end of the day and then
there is ith (in the) oth (on the)   fth (of the) etc.  Can't you just see
what my test would look like--they would think I was writing in some foreign
language.  I never capitalize drugs, because my expander does the ones that
should be capitalized for me.  I have been using an expander for nearly 20
years--I just don't type anything without it on!

I've been trying to  diagnose a problem that I thought involved my
expander (PRD+) and WP51.  I turned off PRD and worked without it for
a bit.  It wasn't actually as awful as I thought it would be, but
unfortunately it didn't solve my problem so I turned it back on after
about 6 pages.  I was so happy to have it back!

BTW, if anybody cares to tackle this one, the problem is that my WP
program will freeze as I'm typing, sometimes several times a day.  It
seems to happen at the right-hand margin when I type a hyphen (though
it also happens at other times).  EAch time it happens, I have to
toggle back to Windows, close WP, reopen it and recapture the minute
or so of text that I lose each time.  It's a royal PITA and it's
what's egging me on toward switching to Word.  I'm afraid to get a new
computer because I don't think my DOS programs will work.

Oh, and this all started after I had to replace my video card, even
though I ended up with a used card identical to the original one.

A bouquet of flowers to the person who solves this problem for me.
And, no, "don't use the hyphen" is not an acceptable answer.  &lt;g&gt;

&gt;If I were ever to take an accreditation test I would be totally lost on
&gt;actual transcription testing without my expander.  If I could not bring my
&gt;own laptop with my expander on it I would fail.  I have used it so long, and
&gt;have so many frequently-used words and terms in it that I cannot type
&gt;without it!  I even use things like th for the.  That word is used so often
&gt;that it amounts to a lot of strokes saved at the end of the day and then
&gt;there is ith (in the) oth (on the)   fth (of the) etc.  Can't you just see
&gt;what my test would look like--they would think I was writing in some foreign
&gt;language.  I never capitalize drugs, because my expander does the ones that
&gt;should be capitalized for me.  I have been using an expander for nearly 20
&gt;years--I just don't type anything without it on!

&gt;&gt;I also have a lot of expansions just for the things that I can never
&gt;&gt; seem to spell properly, like separate.  I know that sounds stupid, but
&gt;&gt; I cannot spell separate about half the time unless I really stop and
&gt;&gt; think about it, but I can spell hydrochlorothiazide without any
&gt;&gt; difficulty.  Without much of my resources, I would be sunk.  By the
&gt;&gt; way, Cindy, if you are reading, I am getting much use out of the
&gt;&gt; Stedman's resources you gave to me, especially the Equipment Words
&gt;&gt; Third Edition.

Well, you know if I could help I would. Have you tried to do this
deliberately and gotten repeat results with the hyphen? I use my WP on
an older laptop running Win 98. I hope to look for a few more of them
as backups knowing problems with XP and that Vista likely is not
compatible. I don't blame WP, of course. It's Windows causing the
problem. I just use a flash drive to move my files to the net computer.
To me it's well worth the additional effort. It's a triple edged sword
for me: WP51 alone, Smartype, and the advanced macro programming. I'm
sure someone could rewrite them all for me in Word, but in my
experience people want you to do it their way, not help you do it as
you want to, say they can do what they have no clue about, etc.

If this is a computer this all worked on at one time and you haven't
changed anything, it is something to do with windows - DOS doesn't seem
to just decide to work differently at a whim. Example: My Mozzila worked
fine for ages. Then, suddenly, starts locking up for no reason. Well,
there probably IS a reason, but not because I did anything - unless it
was accidently hit something "forbidden" unaware.
