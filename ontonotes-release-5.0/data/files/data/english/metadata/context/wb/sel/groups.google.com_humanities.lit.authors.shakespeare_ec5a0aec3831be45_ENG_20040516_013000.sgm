When fortie Winters shall beseige thy brow,
And digge deep trenches in thy beauties field,
Thy youthes proud liuery so gaz'd on now,
Wil be a totter'd weed of smal worth held:
Then being askt,where all thy beautie lies,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty daies;
To say within thine owne deepe sunken eyes,
Were an all-eating shame,and thriftlesse praise.
How much more praise deseru'd thy beauties vse,
If thou couldst answere this faire child of mine
Shall sum my count,and make my old excuse
Proouing his beautie by succession thine.
This were to be new made when thou art ould,
And see thy blood warme when thou feel'st it could,

When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
Will be a tattered weed, of small worth held.
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
If thou couldst answer: This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,
Proving his beauty, by succession, thine.
This were to be new made when thou art old,
And see thy blood warm, when thou feelst it cold.

"/>

and seeing your blood run hot in another, when in yourself you can
feel it cooling.

Line 1: forty. 'Many', as human life goes. We are not to do arithmetic
based on precisely forty.
Besiege: the siege metaphor runs through lines 1 and 2. In besieging a
town, you first surrounded ('invested') it to prevent supplies and
reinforcements from getting in. The active stage began when you 'broke
ground', that is, began to dig out emplacements for your siege
artillery and the three parallel trenches that enabled your army to
approach the walls under cover from fire. All that excavation changed
the appearance of the district (the 'field of operations').

Line 3: livery. The metaphor changes to clothing in lines 3 and 4. At
present the addressee wears the uniform of youth, but in time it will
turn into a ragged old garment not fit for a jumble sale.
(Ingram and Redpath suggest &quot;The sustained image is the ragged uniform
of the long-besieged defender … of the city … against time.&quot; I do not
see this sustained image, only the two separate ones. 'Livery' seems
always to mean clothing and sustenance provided for the servants of a
subject, not at the public, state level, as the siege needs to be.
Henry VII legislated against 'livery and maintenance', that is, the
keeping of large groups of followers by nobles other than himself.)

Line 6: lusty. Not just vigorous and active in this context of
procreation, I think. But there is no necessity for a special meaning
for &quot;treasure&quot;. It would conflict with the argument. The treasure in
point is beauty.

Line 8: thriftless. Shorter Oxford 1. Not thriving. 2. Unprofitable,
worthless, useless (first in 1568). 3. Devoid of thrift, wasteful,
improvident, spendthrift. The second makes sense in this line; perhaps
the first would too, but not the third, which is our modern meaning.

Line 9: thy beauty's use. People were expected to make use of their
talents, as in the parable (Matthew 25, 14-30). Instead of this,
commentators suggest money-lending or sexual meanings which (I
suggest) are forced and unnecessary.

Line 10: direct speech. Very rare in the sonnets. This is the
addressee's speaking part, replying in a sense to being put on the
spot in sonnet 1 line 5, &quot;But thou …&quot;. This is the dramatic, actor's
touch in this sonnet.

Line 12: by succession thine. Normally this would mean &quot;you own it by
inheritance from someone else&quot;. Here we have to reverse that. It is
just one of Shakespeare's puzzles: he sets many of them in the
sonnets. Ingram and Redpath say &quot;one of the many instances of the
strict use of legal terms in the Sonnets.&quot; Not exactly strict: the
poet stands it on its head.

Line 13: new made. Perhaps this looks back to the clothing metaphor of
lines 3-4? If so, the paraphrase should say something like &quot;repaired
and refurbished&quot;, &quot;mended and made new&quot;. I am not sure that &quot;made new&quot;
is standard enough in that sense to suggest it at such a distance. And
a metaphorical rebirth in someone else seems more effective, at this
climactic point in the poem, than a darning and patching job on the
original old garment.

When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
Will be a tattered weed, of small worth held.
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
If thou couldst answer: This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,
Proving his beauty, by succession, thine.
This were to be new made when thou art old,
And see thy blood warm, when thou feelst it cold.

Some observations on Sonnet 2:

Once again the sex of the addressee is not directly
specified with a pronoun (ie his, her, he or she). But
there are several hints that the addressee is male. The
phrase &quot;Thy youth's proud livery&quot; seems more appropriately
addressed to a young man rather than a young woman. Would
it even have been correct to say that a woman wore livery?
Also, the fact that the imaginary fair child is a male
rather than female suggests that the addressee is himself a
male. Also, the phrase &quot;Proving his beauty, by succession,
thine&quot;, while awkward, suggests that the imaginary fair
child would be able to prove he was the addressee's child by
means of his beauty. If the addressee was a woman, the need
to prove this would be unnecessary.

It was suggested during the discussion about Sonnet
1 that perhaps the 'fairness' which the poet admired was
something more than physical fairness. This sonnet seems to
put that idea to rest. After many years there is no reason
why an admirable character might change. Clearly, the
fairness refers to physical beauty.

The line &quot;...within thine own deep-sunken eyes&quot; is
another reference to the narcissism of the addressee. He's
feasting his eyes on himself.

The poet seems to be suggesting that by having a
child, the addressee will not only do a service to the world
by preserving his beauty, as in Sonnet 1, but that a child
would be of benefit to the addressee personally. I suppose
the satisfaction of seeming himself in his child.

Something that isn't yet clear is the relationship
of the poet to the addressee.

Also, it's not clear what class either belongs to.

That's it for now.

This is from Sidney's Sonnet 103:

O happy Thames, that didst my Stella bear!
I saw thee with full many a smiling line
Upon thy cheerfull face, Joy's livery wear,
While those fair planets on thy streams did shine.

Assuming that he is referring to a classical
goddess of joy like Euphrosyne, then a female
could have a livery too. I don't know if the Thames
is supposed to be male or female.

See my demolition of Monsarrat's RES paper!

The Droeshout portrait is not unusual at all!

Isn't it the Thames here that is wearing livery? The river (normally
masculine) wears the uniform of Joy; that is, it is in service to Joy
and wears the clothing that identifies her servants.

I don't remember ever having seen a rule about it, but it does feel
unnatural to talk of a woman's wearing livery. There was some kind of
standard dress for maidservants, but it did not identify their
employers. Perhaps a crowd of uniformed attendants amounted to a show
of force, not appropriate for maidservants?

You're welcome, but that's not exactly what I meant.
I don't think anyone, including the addressee, is going to
claim he is still good looking after forty winters. The
sense I get is that the poet is asking the addressee what he
is going to tell the world where his beauty is when the
addressee gets old. If the adddressee has a child, he can
point to the child. Otherwise, all he can do is refer to
his eyes, which is where his beauty was spent - in his own
eyes gazing on himself. Narcissism.

Now that I look at this again, I think you're
paraphrase is closer to the mark than I thought. The idea
is: what happened to the addressee's beauty? And if the
addressee has a son, since the son is beautiful, and the son
is the son of the addressee, the beauty the son shows is the
beauty of the addressee. Thus the addressee has accounted
for his beauty. If that makes any sense.

&gt;&gt; I take 'excuse' to mean 'successful justification' (nowadays mainly

&gt;But why is it his *old* excuse?

One other way of understanding it, albeit stretching
the words, is that the child will excuse the addressee's
getting old and losing his beauty. ie: &quot;This fair child of
mine shall sum my count and make my (getting) old (and
losing my beauty) excuse(d).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I don't remember ever having seen a rule about it, but it does feel
&gt;&gt; unnatural to talk of a woman's wearing livery. There was some kind of
&gt;&gt; standard dress for maidservants, but it did not identify their
&gt;&gt; employers. Perhaps a crowd of uniformed attendants amounted to a show
&gt;&gt; of force, not appropriate for maidservants?

&gt;The OED gives many examples, not all of which
&gt;pertain to males, and not all of which pertain
&gt;only to servants (first number is the year):

&gt;13.. E.E. Allit. P. A. 1107 And alle in sute her
&gt;liurez wasse.
&gt;1389 in Eng. Gilds (1870) 21 Ye bretheren and
&gt;sisteren of yis gilde...shul han a lyuree of
&gt;hodes in suyte.
&gt;1522 Wriothesely Chron. 1875 I. 13 The kinge
&gt;and he ridinge both together in one liverey.

&gt;I assume that Shakespeare intended the following
&gt;part of the OED definition to pertain: &quot;in wider
&gt;sense, a distinctive badge or suit worn by a
&gt;servant or official, a member of a company, etc.&quot;
&gt;More particularly only the &quot;distinctive badge
&gt;or suit&quot; of youth, iow the addressee's youthful
&gt;appearance.

"/>

The example from 1389 seems to indicate that, at
least in 1389, one could speak of a woman wearing livery.
Which would negate my point that this was a pointer towards
a male addressee.

My second point, that the addressee's son would have
to prove that he was the addressee's son and so indicating
that the addressee is not a woman, was based on my
(mis)understanding of line 12, and also goes down in flames.

Finally, my third point, that since the child is a
boy rather than a girl, this would indicate that the
addressee is male rather than female, was admittedly weak
from the beginning.

So taking Sonnet 2 by itself, there is really
nothing there to indicate the sex of the addressee, is
there?

One other thing: I recall reading awhile back about
the average age at which Elizabethans married. I forget
where. The best I could find was Michael Woods book where,
speaking of Anne, he writes: &quot;Anne was not exactly on the
shelf at twenty-six, which was around the average marriage
age for women in Tudor England...&quot; (p. 83).

If the average marriage age for women was roughly
twenty-six, presumably, the average marriage age for men was
slightly older. In any event, given that the poet is
telling the addressee that the addressee should be thinking
about marriage and children, wouldn't this indicate that the
addressee is in his/her twenties?

George Wyndham, in his 1898 edition of the Sonnets, may have
the answer. In his notes he writes:

&quot;'Old', sometimes = 'more than enough, copious, abundant' (Imp. Dict.)
eg.: - 'If a man were porter of hell-gate, he should have old turning
the key.' Macbeth II.iii.2&quot;.

He gives a couple of more examples, but then adds that 'old'
might have this meaning &quot;...but not, to my knowledge, outside
humourous application.&quot; (p. 270).

In any event, turning to the Signet edition of Macbeth, and
the quoted line, the editors there give a note to the line,
paraphrasing it as : 'should have old' - would certainly have plenty
of.

This meaning of &quot;old&quot; fits nicely in the line - the addressee
would have ample excuse for his handling of his beauty by pointing to
a beautiful son.

3. Thy youthes proud livery so gaz'd on now,

The OED give plenty examples of figurative use:

1412-20 Lydg. Chron. Troy ii. xiii, When that Flora. . .Hath euery playne,
medowe, hil and vale . . clad in lyuery newe.
1494 Fabyan Chron. vi. clxxxii. 180 That Rollo shuld . . take vpon hym
the lyuerey of Cristes baptym.
1563 Homilies ii. Rogation Week iv. (1859) 495 Love and charity, which
is the only livery of a Christian man.
1590 Shakes. Mids. N. ii. i. 113 The childing Autumne, angry Winter
change Their wonted Liueries.
1611 Cotgr., Liripipionné, . . .faithfull to the pot, and therefore bearing
the red-faced liuerie therof.
1661 Boyle Style of Script. (1675) 192 White (the livery of innocence).
1667 Milton P.L. iv. 599 Now . . .Twilight gray Had in her sober Livery
all things clad.
1697 Dryden Virg. Georg. iii. 665 A Snake . . .has cast his Slough aside,
And in his Summer Liv'ry rouls along.
1722 Wollaston Relig. Nat. v. 96 Trees receive annually their peculiar
liveries, and bear their proper fruits.

I can see no problem to a broad figurative use
in this line. The poet is talking of something
that people will look at in many years' time, so
it is both continuing and, in some way, transient.
He is not talking about a suit of clothes.

3. Thy youthes proud livery so gaz'd on now,

A much more relevant question here is what
does &quot; . . . . so gaz'd on now&quot; mean? Who
are all these people gazing at the 'fair youth'?

Doesn't this sounds a bit nutty? Would
anyone have used such language about you
as a youth? Or about anyone you know?

Does Wyndham pick up on the bawdy
allusions at this point?

&quot;Here's a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell-gate,
he should have old turning the key.&quot;

(a) Knocking; (b) in-deed; (b) porter;
(c) hell; (d) gate; (e) key; (f) turning of a key.

All of these are well-recognised by those
commentators not blind to this aspect
(e.g. Partridge, Colman, Rubenstein, Booth.)

'Old' is definitely bawdy -- as anyone
brought up on the streets of London will
confirm. Probably few Cockneys know
exactly why, but the reason is not hard
to fathom -- especially to anyone with a
basic understanding of the (crude and
vulgar) mind of Shakespeare.

See if you can work it out.

(Given the dopiness of the (Strat) minds
around here, I know that I'll probably
have to tell you. But you can have a
couple of days.)

Shakespeare uses 'old' extensively in
bawdy contexts, leaving no doubt as to
his general meaning. Remarkably neither
Partridge nor Colman have picked it up.
Rubenstein does -- although she then
goes wildly wrong in her explanation --
as she so often does. But she's a Yank,
even if one of the best. The fact that she
gets so much right is astonishing.

11. Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse

In this line of this sonnet, 'old' certainly
has (at least one) bawdy meaning since
(i) this is a Shakespeare sonnet, and
(ii) it follows on from 'count' = 'cunt'.
But I have no idea what the bawdy
sense(s) to 'excuse' might be here.

Sonnet no 2 - an alternative version (long)
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is a re-edited version of what I posted last time round.

There are versions of two of the Sonnets in The Passionate Pilgrim but
they are both late ones and it will be a couple of years before we get
to them. The Oxford editor Professor Stanley Wells, in his Oxford
Paperback edition, prints versions of number 2 and number 106 derived
from early 17th century manuscripts which, he says cautiously, 'could
represent the poems in genuinely Shakespearean versions different from
those printed in 1609'.

This is important, because it could mean that our text of the Sonnets
is just a rough first draft and Shakespeare's finished work is lost,
except for this MS version of sonnet 2. The differences are great
enough to imply that. Is the 1609 text we have worth the time it takes
us to study it?

Having no status, income or reputation hanging on this, I boldly rush
in to try and limit the area of doubt. All the egotism is meant to
clear the rest of the world of complicity - not as self-advertisement,
but as saying &quot;This is just me: don't blame anyone else.&quot; I take
Wells's version and call it 'the MS', without knowing in more detail
what underlies it.

There are three possibilities to consider.
A. The MS is a more mature version than the quarto.
B. The MS is the author's less mature version, and the quarto is more
mature - perhaps final.
C. The MS is based on the quarto text and the differences are due to
corruption.

Briefly, I think the first possibility can be eliminated. That means
that, in my opinion (such as it is!), in the quarto we have what the
poet intended, except for mistakes in copying, and we are right to use
it with confidence. I do not see a conclusive way to eliminate the
second possibility but on the whole prefer the third.

The reasons are as follows. (The text is the Quarto, adding the MS
text where it is different.)

1. When forty winters shall besiege thy brow /
2. And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field /
[MS - And trench deep furrows in that lovely field]

The quarto gives us a military metaphor covering the whole of both
lines. When besieging a town the first thing you did was to 'invest'
it; that is, surround it and cut it off. The active attack began when
you 'broke ground', that is, when you began preparing the emplacement
for your siege guns and the system of trenches that would allow your
army to approach the town under cover from fire. So digging trenches
carries on the metaphor of the siege. The word 'field' in military
terms is the area of operations. The excavations and earthworks for a
siege would devastate the field very effectively.

The MS version drops the military metaphor after the first line.
'Furrows' are agricultural, not military, and so the field now has to
be a farmer's field.

I contend that the quarto version, with its fuller working out of the
single military metaphor, is much more effective and no great poet
would have changed from that to the MS version. That means, if the
poet made the change, it was the other way and the quarto is the
later, more mature version.

Could the MS be an early version of the poet's own, before he had
noticed that he could pick up the word 'trench' and continue the
military metaphor? I do not see that we can absolutely deny it. In the
course of composition, anything could have happened. Would he have let
it out of his hands in such a state? We cannot decide.

3. Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now, /
4. Will be a tattered weed, of small worth held. /
[MS - Thy youth's fair liv'ry, so accounted now, /
Shall be like rotten weeds of no worth held. /]

'Fair' just repeats 'lovely' in line 2. 'Proud' is new and more
effective. 'Accounted' seems to refer to cost or value, which is not
really the point. 'Gazed on' gives us the point: this young man is
proud to have everybody looking at him. 'A tattered weed' carries on
the metaphor of clothing, a torn garment, while 'rotten weeds' are
back to agriculture - it sounds like the compost heap. As before, the
quarto is (at least) not the less developed version.

5. Then being asked where all thy beauty lies, /
6. Where all the treasure of thy lusty days /
[MS - Where all the lustre of thy youthful days]

I think 'lusty' is more to the point in a context of child-getting,
but do not see it as decisive.

7. To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes /
8. Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise. /
[MS - To say 'Within these hollow sunken eyes' /
Were an all-eaten truth and worthless praise.]

Direct speech here spoils the effect at line 10, which would otherwise
be electric. I find 'all-eating' effective (he will be eaten up with
shame) but do not understand what an 'all-eaten truth' would be.
Ragged or skeletal perhaps, like a cabbage eaten by caterpillars? Not
convincing. Similarly, 'thriftless' is less commonplace than
'worthless', but says the same thing (Shorter Oxford) in a more
obscure way. On general grounds, the more obscure version is more
likely to be right, the less obscure to be a copying mistake.

9. How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use /
10. If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine /
11. Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse',
12. Proving his beauty by succession thine.
[MS - O how much better were thy beauty's use /
If thou couldst say 'This pretty child of mine /
Saves my account and makes my old excuse', /
Making his beauty by succession thine.]

Again the quarto carries forward the idea of praise where the MS drops
it. 'Fair' compared with 'pretty' is a less trivial prize to offer a
nobleman. The proud 'shall sum my count' also seems more appropriate
to a nobleman, 'saves my account' to a needy debtor rescued at the
last moment. A nobleman might well be a debtor, but he would avoid
talking like one.

It might be said that in the MS we have a money-lending metaphor
carried from line 9 to line 11, which is missing from the quarto.
That would run counter to my general proposition that the quarto
carries these things through better. Line 9 would mean 'How much more
interest you would have to show for your invested capital of beauty'.
The fatal difficulty is that this makes the young man a lender in line
9, but a borrower in line 11. So on this count the quarto wins by
three goals to nil.

13. This were to be new made when thou art old /
14. And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
[MS - This were to be new born when thou art old]

I prefer 'new made', 'renovated, made new again', because the birth of
the child has made the difference. His own is an irrelevant
distraction. He does not want to become a new-born baby. He likes what
he is. I find the half-rhyme 'born' - 'warm' distracting too, since
both words occur at the main metrical break in the line.

Could a generally coherent poem arise purely out of corruption? Just
as we cannot place any limits on what can happen in the course of
composition, so we cannot say that anything is impossible in the way
of corruption. But a story might help, just as an example of how it
might happen.

Suppose, after the first recitation of this poem (in the quarto text)
two or three of those present got together to reconstitute it from
their joint memories. Their memories were pretty good, especially
about salient points; the first line and the last are exactly right.
But every now and then they have lost something and, consciously or
unconsciously, filled it up. Having finally arrived at a text that
made sense and metre, they put a title from Virgil at the top ('Spes
altera', 'Second hope', Aeneid 12.168; has any other work of
Shakespeare a Latin title?. Has any other sonnet of Shakespeare a
title at all?) got it copied fair and proceeded to circulate it among
their friends. Since the poet still kept his manuscript and next
week's recitation was a new sonnet, nobody had a chance to check their
text until 1609. Not that this happened, but it could be what
happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But why is it his *old* excuse?

&gt;&gt; George Wyndham, in his 1898 edition of the Sonnets, may have
&gt;&gt; the answer. In his notes he writes:

&gt;&gt;&quot;'Old', sometimes = 'more than enough, copious, abundant' (Imp. Dict.)
&gt;&gt; eg.: - 'If a man were porter of hell-gate, he should have old turning
&gt;&gt; the key.' Macbeth II.iii.2&quot;.

&gt;&gt; He gives a couple of more examples, but then adds that 'old'
&gt;&gt; might have this meaning &quot;...but not, to my knowledge, outside
&gt;&gt; humourous application.&quot; (p. 270).

&gt; Does Wyndham pick up on the bawdy
&gt; allusions at this point?

&gt;&quot;Here's a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell-gate,
&gt; he should have old turning the key.&quot;

&gt; (a) Knocking; (b) in-deed; (b) porter;
&gt; (c) hell; (d) gate; (e) key; (f) turning of a key.

&gt; All of these are well-recognised by those
&gt; commentators not blind to this aspect
&gt; (e.g. Partridge, Colman, Rubenstein, Booth.)

&gt; 'Old' is definitely bawdy -- as anyone
&gt; brought up on the streets of London will
&gt; confirm. Probably few Cockneys know
&gt; exactly why, but the reason is not hard
&gt; to fathom -- especially to anyone with a
&gt; basic understanding of the (crude and
&gt; vulgar) mind of Shakespeare.

&gt; See if you can work it out.

The

&gt; it even have been correct to say that a woman wore livery?

I think although we have examples of women wearing livery, it was
usually men who wore it. Also, if there is bawdiness in the poem, I
can see it here. &quot;Thy youth's proud livery&quot; could easily be taken to
mean &quot;your boy's erector set.&quot; And it goes perfectly with &quot;the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Agreed. I took that to be one of several meanings. &quot;His resemblance to

word succession. As we go, bit by bit, I'll give a little of the Tudor

you understand that the PT people believe that Southampton was
&quot;Beauty's (Elizabeth's) Rose (offspring--also Tudor Rose, of course),
and so the succession would be through him and his sons.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; It was suggested during the discussion about Sonnet
&gt; 1 that perhaps the 'fairness' which the poet admired was
&gt; something more than physical fairness. This sonnet seems to
&gt; put that idea to rest. After many years there is no reason
&gt; why an admirable character might change. Clearly, the
&gt; fairness refers to physical beauty.

"/>

I think it could have another meaning, especially in S1--fairness as
the ability to weigh arguments equally. After all, the poet is asking
the youth to consider his argument. And this would match other legal
language in the sonnets. And (I'm not supposed to run ahead, I know)it
reminds me of &quot;Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit
impediments.&quot; Aren't true minds fair minds as well as like minds? And
here we do get some of that legal language with that interesting word
impediments.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The line &quot;...within thine own deep-sunken eyes&quot; is
&gt; another reference to the narcissism of the addressee. He's
&gt; feasting his eyes on himself.

&gt; The poet seems to be suggesting that by having a
&gt; child, the addressee will not only do a service to the world
&gt; by preserving his beauty, as in Sonnet 1, but that a child
&gt; would be of benefit to the addressee personally. I suppose
&gt; the satisfaction of seeming himself in his child.

&gt; Something that isn't yet clear is the relationship

That is never clear to me, although overall I tend to think there's a
homosexual relationship or the wish for there to be one.

I would say that they must both belong to a similar class to be on
such familiar terms. Once one admits bawdy language into the equation,

there is a certain equality of station.

&gt;&gt; I don't remember ever having seen a rule about it, but it does feel
&gt;&gt; unnatural to talk of a woman's wearing livery. There was some kind of
&gt;&gt; standard dress for maidservants, but it did not identify their
&gt;&gt; employers. Perhaps a crowd of uniformed attendants amounted to a show
&gt;&gt; of force, not appropriate for maidservants?

&gt;3. Thy youthes proud livery so gaz'd on now,

&gt;The OED give plenty examples of figurative use:

&gt;1412-20 Lydg. Chron. Troy ii. xiii, When that Flora. . .Hath euery playne,
&gt;medowe, hil and vale . . clad in lyuery newe.
&gt;1494 Fabyan Chron. vi. clxxxii. 180 That Rollo shuld . . take vpon hym

&gt;1563 Homilies ii. Rogation Week iv. (1859) 495 Love and charity, which
&gt;is the only livery of a Christian man.
&gt;1590 Shakes. Mids. N. ii. i. 113 The childing Autumne, angry Winter

&gt;1611 Cotgr., Liripipionné, . . .faithfull to the pot, and therefore bearing

&gt;1661 Boyle Style of Script. (1675) 192 White (the livery of innocence).

&gt;1697 Dryden Virg. Georg. iii. 665 A Snake . . .has cast his Slough aside,
&gt;And in his Summer Liv'ry rouls along.
&gt;1722 Wollaston Relig. Nat. v. 96 Trees receive annually their peculiar
&gt;liveries, and bear their proper fruits.

"/>

None of these examples pertain to the problem under
discussion: were Elizabethan women ever described as
wearing livery?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I can see no problem to a broad figurative use
&gt;in this line. The poet is talking of something
&gt;that people will look at in many years' time, so

&gt;He is not talking about a suit of clothes.

No, he's not - he's talking about youthful physical
beauty.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;3. Thy youthes proud livery so gaz'd on now,

&gt;A much more relevant question here is what
&gt;does &quot; . . . . so gaz'd on now&quot; mean? Who

"/>

I take it to meam the anonymous crowd - anyone who
comes in contact with the addressee.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Doesn't this sounds a bit nutty? Would

Flat, boring and pedestrian? Well, maybe you think
so. Personally, I find the theme in the first two sonnets
(of which this phrase is but a part) to be quite unusual.

Here we have a poet telling a physically attractive,
narcissistic addressee that the addressee has an obligation
to the world to somehow preserve and pass on his/her beauty.
The poet suggests that perhaps having a child will acomplish
this. Note that the poet is not particularly concerned with
the addressee personally, only the addressee's beauty. Yet
at the same time, the poet is accomplishing some heavy
flattery of the addressee.

I think this is an unusual scenario, and don't quite
know what to make of it.

So after two sonnets, what do we know? -

In all probability, to the point of near-certainty,
the addressee of the two sonnets is the same person.

The addressee is physically attractive.

The addressee is narcissistic.

While the sex of the addressee has not yet been
specified, it is more likely that the addressee is male
rather than female. But it's not certain, yet. Nor is the
sex of the poet clear, either. This could be a man writing
to a woman, a man writing to a man, a woman writing to a
man, or a woman writing to a woman.

The addressee is of marriageable age, meaning (I
think) that he or she would be in the 19 - 26 age range.

The poet, having posed a problem for the addressee,
is offering a solution to that problem. After all, it's
only the poet's assertion that beautiful people have some
sort of obligation to the world to propagate or preserve
their beauty.

The poet seems singularly concerned with the
addressee's beauty, not with the addressee as a person.

While seeming to chastise the addressee for his/her
narcissistic failure to preserve or propagate his/her
beauty, the poet is, at the same time, acknowledging that
beauty, and so is flattering the addressee.

This is interesting I wonder what the writer is actually describing.
If he meant by 'livery' that she was wearing an acknowledged uniform,
why does he need to say it is 'all in suit'? Might he mean just
'clothing' by 'livery', and then go on to say that her clothing was
all consistent, i.e. one piece with another?

Here there is a common uniform for men and women, which (presumably to
allow for the difference between their other clothing) has to be
confined to their hoods. It must have been unusual at the time - a
nice example of how gilds, as middle-class, commercially-oriented

&gt;&gt;More particularly only the &quot;distinctive badge

&gt; The example from 1389 seems to indicate that, at

&gt;a male addressee.

Not absolutely, no. Of course,there are several sonnets later on to
which that applies. I may argue (no commitment yet) that the poet
wanted his poems to be available for use by a wider audience in their

Among the aristocracy, an heiress (or other major prize) would not
have to wait so long: &quot;the marriage contract, dated November 17th,
1606, stipulated that the marriage should take place 'within three
months after the said Lady Elizabeth should accomplish the age of
twelve years'&quot; (Diana Poulton, 'John Dowland', chapter 3, 'The
Pilgrim's Solace'). That was a political match between Lord Howard de
Walden and the daughter of the Earl of Dunbar: King James wanted
marriages to unite the aristocracies of Englad and Scotland. That
marriage took place in March 1612, a little late because of the recent
death of the bride's father.

So the practice, and the average age, might be different in different
social strata.

The anonymous crowd doesn't &quot;gaze&quot; on
fair youths. A strikingly beautiful woman
(or maybe a man) might attract glances as
she or he walked down the street. But
there's not much 'gazing'.

I suggest that we can read in a critical note
into ' . . . so gaz'd on now . .'. The poet
does not have a high opinion of the gazers.

Those who are subjected to a lot of gazing
are usually performing roles in public --
actors, or opera singers, or they occupy a
public role like Pope or President or they
are 'celebrities'.

Does your 'fair youth' occupy such a role?

Or does mine?

According to Katherine Duncan-Jones's Appendix, there are 11 MSS of
sonnet 2. It seems they are mainly in personal collections of verse by
a number of authors, selected by the people who owned and wrote the
books, such as &quot;George Morley's commonplace book&quot; (page 454).

Wells's version has been made up out of them - naturally they are not
identical - and for present purposes I have simply followed his
result, rather than discuss all the variants in all the MSS to which,
in any case, I have no access.

That gives the impression that the MS version is more unified and of a
piece than in fact it is. I have let this happen, rather than appear
to treat it lightly - it is more convincing to argue against a strong
position than a weak one.

In the overall context of the sonnet, the reading of

Well, yes, in a way. Granted, the poet doesn't use

No, but as noted above, you're right in that the
poet is claiming to have some consideration for the

two poems is the physical beauty of the addressee and the

'Gazers' and 'admirers' are far from being
the same kind of people. The meaning of
'gaze' has not changed much since 1600.
In fact, according to the OED, it's become
a _less_ opprobrious term. But you still
won't find many references to &quot;gazers&quot; in
a modern journalistic context. Shakespeare
used it a lot more than we would because
he wanted to be -- and could afford to be --
disparaging about the 'common herd'.
Most modern publications have to sell to
the 'common herd' and can't afford to think
of them in such terms -- let alone express it.

OED definitions:
1. (intransitive) In early use: To look vacantly or curiously about;
also, to stare, open one's eyes (with astonishment). In modern use:
To look fixedly, intently, or deliberately at something. Now chiefly literary.

2. (transitive) To stare at, look fixedly at. poet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;into ' . . . so gaz'd on now . .'. The poet

&gt; What makes you say that?

"/>

The ordinary meaning of the word
&quot; . .To look vacantly . .&quot; and Shakespeare's
use of it in the rest of the canon. e.g.:

2H6
Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook
The abject people gazing on thy face,
With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,
That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels
When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.

2H6
Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,
Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,
Enchased with all the honours of the world?
If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Or they are physically beautiful people who attract

Can you quote some modern or historical
examples? Can you give an example where
a modern poet might use those kinds of

Do you take everything a poet says in
his sonnets as being the literal truth?
It is clear that the addressee likes being
told that s/he is beautiful. Whether the
poet means it, or is attaching a variety
of tones, is something we must decide
each time.

The core weakness of your (traditional)
interpretation is that it is based on a
wholly unreal notion of the way in which
humans behave. It's a make-believe
'poetry-world' or a 'fantasy-land'.
Nothing in the real world begins to match
anything that you see this 'fair youth'
doing, nor how you see others behaving
towards him or her.

"/>

I can't say anything in general. The above case happens to be rather
well documented. The marriage was solemnised in March 1612. Diana
Poulton says &quot;On 3rd November 1612, John Chamberlain wrote to Sir
Ralph Winwood 'the Lord Walden that hath ben now a goode while wedded
to the Lord of Dunbar's daughter, was not bedded with her till the
last weeke, and that by speciall commaundment.'&quot;(N.E. McClure, Letters
of John Chamberlaine, 1939).

This case was news, which suggests that such a delay was not common
form. Alternatively, though, since it was political, it might be the
king's intervention (speciall commaundment) that made it news. These
people were threatening to turn one of the marriages James so much
favoured into a nullity, and he was not going to put up with it. I
think, though, that if delay was standard form, the sentence would
have been worded differently.

I would contend that the obstacle in this case was the bride's
reluctance. Apprehension might be expected, when she was taken from
her family and country and handed over at the age of 13 to a stranger.
Dowland has produced some very gentle, encouraging, seductive music,
and the unknown poet has produced the words.

Further, Dowland has added an introductory song at the beginning on
the subject of Apollo and Daphne (the paradigm of the reluctant

Elizabeth, but the last line is well chosen to appeal to King James:

&gt; True. But the tone the poet is using strikes me as
&gt;though the addressee is well into the age at which he/she
&gt;should be thinking about getting married and, more
&gt;importantly, having children, but isn't.

Not necessarily 'well into'. For example, he might be just into that
age, but have expressed himself unfavourably towards marriage, or
early marriage, or a particular marriage. Certainly he is not an old
man, or middle aged, or anything close. All this about beauty makes
that definite.

You know, Paul, as coincidence would have it, my

&gt;&gt;&gt;The anonymous crowd doesn't &quot;gaze&quot; on
&gt;&gt;&gt;fair youths. A strikingly beautiful woman
&gt;&gt;&gt;(or maybe a man) might attract glances as
&gt;&gt;&gt;she or he walked down the street. But
&gt;&gt;&gt;there's not much 'gazing'.

&gt;&gt; I think you're nitpicking. However, let's say then
&gt;&gt; that the gazers are the addressee's many admirers.

&gt;'Gazers' and 'admirers' are far from being
&gt;the same kind of people. The meaning of
&gt;'gaze' has not changed much since 1600.
&gt;In fact, according to the OED, it's become
&gt;a _less_ opprobrious term. But you still
&gt;won't find many references to &quot;gazers&quot; in
&gt;a modern journalistic context. Shakespeare
&gt;used it a lot more than we would because
&gt;he wanted to be -- and could afford to be --
&gt;disparaging about the 'common herd'.
&gt;Most modern publications have to sell to
&gt;the 'common herd' and can't afford to think
&gt;of them in such terms -- let alone express it.

&gt;OED definitions:
&gt; 1. (intransitive) In early use: To look vacantly or curiously about;
&gt;also, to stare, open one's eyes (with astonishment). In modern use:
&gt;To look fixedly, intently, or deliberately at something. Now chiefly literary.

&gt; 2. (transitive) To stare at, look fixedly at. poet.

"/>

So what's your point? Definition 2 seems to suit my
purposes well, as does the idea of staring in astonishment
in Definition 1.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;I suggest that we can read in a critical note
&gt;&gt;&gt;into ' . . . so gaz'd on now . .'. The poet
&gt;&gt;&gt;does not have a high opinion of the gazers.

&gt;&gt; What makes you say that?

&gt;The ordinary meaning of the word
&gt;&quot; . .To look vacantly . .&quot; and Shakespeare's
&gt;use of it in the rest of the canon. e.g.:

&gt;2H6
&gt;Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook
&gt;The abject people gazing on thy face,
&gt;With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,
&gt;That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels
&gt;When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.

&gt;2H6
&gt;Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,
&gt;Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
&gt;What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,
&gt;Enchased with all the honours of the world?
&gt;If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,

"/>

Seems to me that &quot;gaze&quot; in these passages can be
understood in the sense of Definition 2. I don't see
anything particularly &quot;critical&quot; about it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Those who are subjected to a lot of gazing
&gt;&gt;&gt;are usually performing roles in public --
&gt;&gt;&gt;actors, or opera singers, or they occupy a

&gt;&gt;&gt;are 'celebrities'.

&gt;&gt; Or they are physically beautiful people who attract
&gt;&gt; a lot of admirers.

&gt;Can you quote some modern or historical
&gt;examples? Can you give an example where
&gt;a modern poet might use those kinds of
&gt;words, or send much the same _sort_ of

Okay. After the first two sonnets it's my opinion

As coincidence would also have it, one of the words of
the day (from Wordsmith) a while back was 'cento'

(SEN-to) noun A literary work, especially a poem,
composed of parts taken from works of other authors.

It resulted in this:

Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
Or close the wall up with our English dead!
O, that there were some virtue in my tears;
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.
This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle,
Such precious deeds in one that promised naught.
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
This is the English not the Turkish court;
And by the hazard of the spotted die
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day.
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I:
When I would pray and think, I think and pray!
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds;
Here never shines the sun, here nothing breeds.

I assume that our poet used words to mean
what they usually mean. So when he says
&quot; . . . . . so gazed on now&quot;, the fact that these
words are in a poem does not change their
meaning. I assume that the poet might well
use the same words to convey much the same
meaning outside a poem as, for example, in a
conversation with, or in a private letter to,
the addressee.

The phrase &quot; . . . . . so gazed on now&quot; does
NOT in itself mean &quot; . . . . . so admired now&quot;,
(although that might be a sense you could
derive from it -- in certain circumstances).
It is not the same. Cows will often gaze on
you. We don't (or I don't) usually assume
that implies some kind of admiration.

'Gazing' and 'admiring' are not the same.
You have no sound basis for translating
one into the other. Gazing does not
usually occur in the ordinary world when
beautiful person walks down the street.
Admiring glances maybe, but 'gazing'
usually only occurs under circumstances
when the gazee is doing something that
gives the gazers implicit permission to
'stare' or to 'look fixedly at' -- such as
wearing very expensive dresses at
Oscar-award ceremonies.

Little or nothing takes place in the heads
of 'gazers'. It's what cows do. It's what
people with the mentality of cows do.
The term is inherently critical. Protestants
in England at the time used the term about
Catholics gazing at the Host, or at other
objects they venerated or adored.

in conversation? I would think the poet must use written forms and
conventions to communicate, and perhaps the audience is him/herself
and the situation/occasion merely a stage? So it's not the same as in
conversation. Not spontaneous either, I think.

This is where identifying galaxies of word definitions, sorting out
likely applications, and adding up their meanings is an obvious
oversimplification, although a necessary step before arriving at
exegesis.

Personally, I have no doubt that all the possibilities of what Empson
calls &quot;constructive ambiguities&quot; are inherent in poetry. bb

1. When fortie Winters shall beseige thy brow,

3. Thy youthes proud livery so gaz'd on now,
4. Wil be a totter'd weed of smal worth held:
5. Then being askt, where all thy beautie lies,
6. Where all the treasure of thy lusty daies;
7. To say within thine owne deepe sunken eyes,
8. Were an all-eating shame, and thriftlesse praise.
9. How much more praise deserv'd thy beauties use,
10. If thou couldst answere this faire child of mine
11. Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse
12. Prooving his beautie by succession thine.
13. This were to be new made when thou art ould,
14. And see thy blood warme when thou feel'st it could,

I am sure that there is much more to this
sonnet than I can see. It appears to be a
fairly straightforward plea to the Queen
to have an heir of her body, with a few
military and sartorial metaphors and a lot
of bawdy punning; (the latter, as ever,
missed by the commentators).

1. When fortie Winters shall beseige thy brow,

The martial imagery is more than an
analogy; it is a warning. The poet sees
civil war as being almost certain if the
succession is not safe and predictable.
'Fortie' plays on 'fort' and hints at 'fortifie'.
The poet is probably pointing to the
large and martial Winter family. They
were mostly sailors with an almost
hereditary control of important posts in
the navy. He may have been using their
name merely as an example -- and as one
that provide a convenient image -- or he
may have had more particular reasons.
Some of the next generation had strong
Catholic sympathies, getting involved in
the Gunpowder plot of 1605. But it is
quite possible that he was jokingly
referring to an attempt by the Winter
brothers to 'brow-beat' the Queen over
some issue.

2. And digge deep trenches in thy beauties field,

The 'deep trenches' are meant both
metaphorically and literally. The poet is
asking the Queen to visualise them in
Windsor Park, outside her strongest
palace.

3. Thy youthes proud livery so gaz'd on now,

The livery of the royal houses was well
known. The Queen had to endure much
'gazing' much of it near-mindless, both
within the court and outside. It was not
necessarily loyal or admiring. The poet
may also be playing on live-ry.

4. Wil be a totter'd weed of smal worth held:

The word is 'tottered', which not the same as
'tattered' (even if it was sometimes used in its
place). Its origin is in 'totter', now obsolete
as a verb, which the OED defines as:
&quot;1. To swing to and fro, esp. at the end of a rope; fig. to waver,
vacillate. Obs. b. spec. To swing from the gallows, to be hanged. Obs.&quot;

At the time bodies were left hanging
from scaffolds (especially at the end of
the rebellion of the Northern Earls of 1569)
with their clothes steadily becoming more
tattered.

The poet is warning of the danger of a
similar, only much more serious, rebellion
in which the Queen could end up losing.
He is also suggesting that, in any event,
few will rate her monarchy highly at the
end of her reign when they know a new
dynasty is about to take over.

5. Then being askt, where all thy beautie lies,

There is a pun on 'askt' / 'arsed' -- which,
in London pronunciation are identical.
Her 'beauty' lies in her arse.

6. Where all the treasure of thy lusty daies;

'Treasure' meant 'virginity' in this context.
The bawdy strain continues with 'die' (i.e.
orgasm) in 'daies' -- another London
pronunciation.

7. To say within thine owne deepe sunken eyes,

The &quot;deepe sunken eyes&quot; alludes primarily
to the sexual organs. That is where her
'virginity' will be buried.

8. Were an all-eating shame, and thriftlesse praise.

The Queen's alternative strategy (to getting
married) was to renounce any possibility of
it and celebrate her virginity. That 'virtuous'
behaviour might be thought to gain her some
kind of 'praise' -- from Catholics (who wanted
Mary QS to succeed) or from those who
thought virginity inherently good. But it
would be entirely 'thriftless'. It would yield no
useful end, be entirely profitless and would
come only from those with a thriftless
(Catholic?) outlook.

Thift applies in these OED senses
&quot;1. Not thriving or prosperous; unsuccessful; unfortunate. Obs.
b. Not flourishing (in physical condition). Obs
2. Unprofitable, worthless, useless. Now rare.&quot;

A bawdy theme is maintained:
(a) 'all' / 'awl' = 'penis',
(b) 'shame' = female puddenda
(c) 'eating' = no explanation needed
(d) thrift = penis

'Thrift' (OED n2)
&quot;[Origin obscure. Cf. Old Norse. þrífa to grip: but connecting
links are unknown.] . . . The handle (usu. wooden) of a mill
bill, which is fixed in a mortise in the thick head of the handle.

The phrase 'all-eating shame' would be
far over the top in a sonnet addressed
to a fair youth. Where is the shame?
Why should it be 'all-eating'? Whereas,
in its true context, it fits perfectly. The
poet foresees all being destroyed or
'eaten', if the succession is uncertain and
contested.

9. How much more praise deserv'd thy beauties use,

'Praise' is repeated almost immediately,
and so carries another (dominant) meaning.
The poet is emphasising the bawdy in this
line, with 'praise' being related to 'pride' and
the male erection, as in 'p-raise'. So many
more male erections should have the use
of the Queen's 'beauty' (or vagina).

In the ordinary sense of 'praise', the poet
is thinking of an entirely different kind
from that in line 8 -- and from an opposing
source. He visualises a great Protestant
celebration on the birth of a (male) heir to
the throne, as set against the quasi-Catholic
celebration of virginity, and the almost
strictly Catholic gratitude for the absence
of a Tudor heir.

10. If thou couldst answere this faire child of mine
11. Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse

It was standard in all official and legal
matters (and in many others) to record
the date as &quot;in the Nth year in the reign
of her majesty, Queen Elizabeth&quot;. That
is the 'count' that would 'be summed'
here when the old Queen died and a new
King ascended to the throne.

The poet is, of course, punning on 'cunt'.
The new child would fill the royal vagina
when it was born, finally putting &quot;some&quot;
thing great in that location.

'Excuse' refers to the female sexual organs.
and their inferior nothingness (which
Freud made so much of later), with a slight
hint at 'making an excuse' when going to
the lavatory. 'Make' is mostly in the sense
of 'make my day' (OED 46a). Their entire
existence and purpose would have been
justified -- after all the tergiversations of
so many years.

'Old' fits in the ordinary sense. By any
standards, the Queen was very old (in
her late forties) to have her first child.

'Old' also fits in a bawdy sense, with the
London practice of dropping of the 'd',
turning it into 'ole' -- the same word as
'hole' (since they also drop its 'h') -- and
also with the visual sense of the round 'O'.
Shakespeare uses 'old' a lot in bawdy
contexts for these reasons.

12. Prooving his beautie by succession thine.

The 'beauty' (i.e. even the very existence)
of the new King will be seen as yet another
attribute of the Queen. She will be admired
all the more for having produced an heir.
The line should be read with the phrase
'by succession' attached to the King:
&quot;Prooving his beautie (by succession) thine.&quot;

Of course, the 'by succession' phrase has
a powerful meaning in this context. It has
none at all in the traditional 'fair youth'
interpretations, none of which can make
sense of this line.

13. This were to be new made when thou art ould,

The Queen did not make a distinction
between herself as an individual and her
role as a monarch. Nor did she expect
anyone else to. She lived the role.
Were she to have a son (or, perhaps --
but let's not think about it -- a daughter)
and heir, she could almost see 'herself'
continuing.

14. And see thy blood warme when thou feel'st it could,

Her royal blood would be warm in her
son, even though it was beginning to
run cold in her own body.

Paul.

It is only a starting assumption -- and not

connection with any reality; any meanings
the words have in the dictionaries can
therefore be disregarded.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Peter Groves kindly supplied the URL and reposted it a while back;
here it is again:
-------------------------
It's his &quot;exegesis&quot; of Sonnet 103 at

e ,
and deserves to be quoted in full :

&quot;1. Alack what poverty my Muse brings forth,

Some commentators propose 'brings forth'
indicates 'gives birth to'. However the poet
means to suggest a much more frequent
bodily function: i.e. 'po-(ver-ty)'. Vendler
acutely remarks how &quot;the _p_overty of the
Muse seems to generate a string of p-words
to accompany itself: pride, praise, pass.&quot;
Robert Stonehouse also makes a good
point about the play on 'A Lack' here.

2. That having such a scope to show her pride,

'Scope' and 'pride' have bawdy senses.
Pride usually indicates sexual organs, and
scope the vagina. However here, I think,
'scope' refers to the anus.

3. The argument all bare is of more worth

Again 'argument' and 'worth' often refer to
'vagina' -- which here is 'all bare'. But I feel
that 'worth' refers to the turd produced by the
Muse; by 'argument' the poet is referring to
what is left behind (no pun intended) after
the act of defecation.

Booth (page 196) refers to two canonical
uses of 'argument' thus: T&amp;C IV.v.26-29 and
R&amp;J II.iv.94-96.

MENELAUS I had good argument for kissing once.
PATROCLUS But that's no argument for kissing now;
For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,
And parted thus you and your argument.

MERCUTIO (R&amp;J II.iv.94-96)
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.

'Worth' has come up in many sonnets in bawdy
and scatological senses.

Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held: 2:4
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair, 16:11
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth. 37:4
. . . . . . if aught in me 38 :6
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight; 38 :6
O, how thy worth with manners may I sing, 39:1
Most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief, 48:6
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are, 52:7
Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope, 52:13
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand, 60:13
Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand. 60:14
As I all other in all worths surmount. 62:8
Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time; 70:6
For you in me can nothing worthy prove; 72:4
The worth of that is that which it contains, 74:13
But since your worth, wide as the ocean is, 80:5
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise, 82:6
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow. 78:8
The Charter of thy worth gives thee releasing; 87:3
Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing, 87:9

3. The argument all bare is of more worth

Booth compares 'bare' with H8, I.i.23-5
&quot; . . . . The madams too,
Not us'd to toil, did almost sweat to bear
The pride upon them . . &quot;

But, amazingly, Booth seems to fail to notice
the bawdy puns in both passages.

4. Than when it hath my added praise beside.

The poet pictures himself sitting beside
his Muse in the 'House of Office' leaving
his 'added praise' on the ground outside,
alongside that deposited by his Muse.

The second quatrain leaves the scatological
discussion of his Muse, and focuses on
the addressee, switching to a bawdy account
of thoughts on an imagined act of sex with her.

5. Oh blame me not if I no more can write!

The poet pretends to be so excited by these
thoughts of sex, that he cannot write.

6. Look in your glass and there appears a face

Here, his beloved uses her mirror to inspect
parts not easily seen otherwise. But he is
almost certainly punning on his own name
'glass' = verre = Vere. He regarded himself,
in many respects, as her other self, or her
double, or reflection. He was, supremely,
the voice of the age she had created.

7. That over-goes my blunt invention quite,

His 'blunt invention' indicates his penis.
Her vagina would 'over-go it quite'.
Booth remarks that 'invention' suggests:
'in' and 'venire' = 'to come'.

8. Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.

'Lines' puns on 'loins'. They will be 'dulled'
by sexual gratification, about which he may
then feel 'disgraced' (possibly also because
he is now depleted, exhausted and can do no
more).

The third quatrain reflects on the nature of
the act of sex generally.

9. Were it not sinful then striving to mend,

'Striving' in the sexual act is intended.
The 'mend/mar' antithesis has nothing to
do with any proverb (the standard idiotic
interpretation). It is about the paradoxical
nature of the sex act.

10. To mar the subject that before was well,

'Subject' is a triple pun: (a) superficially on
'topic'; (b) in the sexual sense -- probably
on 'penis'; and (c) in the monarch/subject
sense, with the poet as subject.

11. For to no other pass my verses tend,

By 'pass' he means passage, and also
sexual gratification.

12. Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;

He hints (or pretends to hint) that he knows
more about her physical attributes than he
is able to tell.

13. And more, much more than in my verse can sit,

The 'more, much more' is, of course, sexually
suggestive; so is 'sit' (as in a sexual position).
We may want to invoke &quot;Stonehouse's Rule&quot; as
regards the repetition of 'more'. But, as in 102,
the application is obvious: no one could be
more 'more' (or less 'less') than the Queen.

14. Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.

'Glass' comes up again as in line 6, and
in much the same manner, reinforcing
the likelihood of a pun on 'Verre'.

The bawdy and scatological aspects of this sonnet are undeniable. The
hopelessness
of trying to place either within a 'Fair Youth'
context is also undeniable.

Once again, the Stratfordian scenario fails
hopelessly; and the Oxford/Queen one is
triumphant.&quot;

Okay. So what's the problem?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;It is not the same. Cows will often gaze on

When you read about &quot;lovers gazing into each other's
eyes&quot;, how do you understand it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The anonymous crowd doesn't &quot;gaze&quot; on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fair youths. A strikingly beautiful woman
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(or maybe a man) might attract glances as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;she or he walked down the street. But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there's not much 'gazing'.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you're nitpicking. However, let's say then
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the gazers are the addressee's many admirers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;'Gazers' and 'admirers' are far from being
&gt;&gt;&gt;the same kind of people. The meaning of
&gt;&gt;&gt;'gaze' has not changed much since 1600.
&gt;&gt;&gt;In fact, according to the OED, it's become
&gt;&gt;&gt;a _less_ opprobrious term. But you still
&gt;&gt;&gt;won't find many references to &quot;gazers&quot; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;a modern journalistic context. Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt;used it a lot more than we would because
&gt;&gt;&gt;he wanted to be -- and could afford to be --
&gt;&gt;&gt;disparaging about the 'common herd'.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Most modern publications have to sell to
&gt;&gt;&gt;the 'common herd' and can't afford to think
&gt;&gt;&gt;of them in such terms -- let alone express it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;OED definitions:
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. (intransitive) In early use: To look vacantly or curiously about;
&gt;&gt;&gt;also, to stare, open one's eyes (with astonishment). In modern use:
&gt;&gt;&gt;To look fixedly, intently, or deliberately at something. Now chiefly literary.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. (transitive) To stare at, look fixedly at. poet.

&gt;&gt; So what's your point? Definition 2 seems to suit my
&gt;&gt; purposes well, as does the idea of staring in astonishment
&gt;&gt; in Definition 1.

&gt;'Gazing' and 'admiring' are not the same.
&gt;You have no sound basis for translating
&gt;one into the other. Gazing does not
&gt;usually occur in the ordinary world when
&gt;beautiful person walks down the street.
&gt;Admiring glances maybe, but 'gazing'
&gt;usually only occurs under circumstances
&gt;when the gazee is doing something that
&gt;gives the gazers implicit permission to
&gt;'stare' or to 'look fixedly at' -- such as
&gt;wearing very expensive dresses at
&gt;Oscar-award ceremonies.

&quot;Lovers gazing into each other's eyes.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I suggest that we can read in a critical note
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;into ' . . . so gaz'd on now . .'. The poet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;does not have a high opinion of the gazers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What makes you say that?

&gt;&gt;&gt;The ordinary meaning of the word
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; . .To look vacantly . .&quot; and Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt;use of it in the rest of the canon. e.g.:

&gt;&gt;&gt;2H6
&gt;&gt;&gt;Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook
&gt;&gt;&gt;The abject people gazing on thy face,
&gt;&gt;&gt;With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,
&gt;&gt;&gt;That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels
&gt;&gt;&gt;When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.

&gt;&gt;&gt;2H6
&gt;&gt;&gt;Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
&gt;&gt;&gt;What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Enchased with all the honours of the world?
&gt;&gt;&gt;If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,

&gt;&gt; Seems to me that &quot;gaze&quot; in these passages can be
&gt;&gt; understood in the sense of Definition 2. I don't see
&gt;&gt; anything particularly &quot;critical&quot; about it.

&gt;Little or nothing takes place in the heads
&gt;of 'gazers'. It's what cows do. It's what
&gt;people with the mentality of cows do.
&gt;The term is inherently critical. Protestants
&gt;in England at the time used the term about
&gt;Catholics gazing at the Host, or at other
&gt;objects they venerated or adored.

&quot;Lovers gazing into each other's eyes.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Those who are subjected to a lot of gazing

It's a silly question, and an argumentative tactic

themes in poetry. We're trying to analyze the meaning of
one specific set of poems. Whether the themes present in it
are unique or not is neither here nor there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Nothing in the real world begins to match
&gt;&gt;&gt;anything that you see this 'fair youth'

The problem is that you cannot put forward
any remotely likely circumstances under which
your 'fair youth' would be subject to admiring
gazes.

It is, in principle, rude to stare or gaze.
However, the gazee may give permission to
the gazer(s) -- usually implicitly. In your
example, each lover gives permission to the
other. Try attempting it with someone with
whom you are not in love (and from whom
you have no such implicit permission) and
see what reaction you get.

an 'argumentative tactic'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We're not doing a survey on common

"/>

First make you mind up. Is there a general
situation of which this poem (and this
phrase, in particular) is one instance? That
is the apparent claim you make above:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or they are physically beautiful people who attract
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot of admirers.

Or is this poem (and that phrase) describing
a real situation between two people, which
was virtually unique in the history of the
human race?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Of course it's relevant. If the theme you
identify in a set of poems is common, or
occurs elsewhere, then you can quote the
other instances as support for the meaning
you claim to identify. When you can find
none at all, your claim does not have much
credibility. When, further, you cannot
indicate any recognisable human behaviour
(which you claim is outlined in the words)
then your reading has even less credibility.

I'm sure the bard had all sorts of &quot;excretory&quot; thoughts, but applying them

of Sonnet 103 was way off the mark. I agree it's bawdy, but you twisted it
to be about having a dump.

For example:

&quot;'Scope' and 'pride' have bawdy senses.
Pride usually indicates sexual organs, and
scope the vagina. However here, I think,
'scope' refers to the anus.&quot;

Why would you think that if you've already said &quot;scope&quot; refers to the
vagina? Do you have any precedent for saying so, or are you just more

Oh dear. I am not locked into a homosexual interpretation, although it

three quarters of Oxfordians are agree with a homosexual interpretation. It

No, but mocking an idiot who writes endlessly on such contests in

&gt;&gt; Didn't you as a child indulge in 'shitting contests'

&gt; Afraid not, even though I grew up in London, so should perhaps, in your
&gt; mind, have been a party to such contests. Perhaps they are where your
&gt; problems &quot;stem&quot; from, unless you had them with the Queen, of course.

"/>

I had a remarkably free upbringing. My
parents were too busy making money and
enjoying themselves. And there were all
those glorious derelict sites, from bombs
and along the river. I get appalled at the
sheltered, antiseptic existence that modern
kids endure. And they think it 'normal'!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;And doesn't the idea of
&gt;&gt; having one with the Queen of England have the
&gt;&gt; potential for a certain amount of humour?

&gt; I wouldn't presume to think so, and nor, I believe, would the poet.

"/>

He had much more of a sense of humour
than you. He also knew hers -- which was
notoriously bawdy. Further, and probably
most important, neither he nor she were
members of the mindless middle-classes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm sure the bard had all sorts of &quot;excretory&quot; thoughts, but applying them
&gt; to the Queen? Why would he do that? Oops, cancel that question. Your reading
&gt; of Sonnet 103 was way off the mark. I agree it's bawdy, but you twisted it
&gt; to be about having a dump.

"/>

I'll get back to 103 sometime. I'm sure
that I'll have 'fresh' thoughts on it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I actually have a very open mind. I just don't happen to agree with you. You
&gt; are stretching the sonnets so far to allow your interpretation that I can
&gt; hear them snapping. Oops, there goes another one.

"/>

So point out far-fetched things as we go
along. You will notice the near-total
silence of the Strats on the matter --
especially the 'scholars'. THAT should
give you pause. If they can't find anything
wrong (or don't dare to question a word)
surely you should suspect that my
exegeses might have something going
for them? Would you ever have expected
an anti-Strat to get so little criticism in a
bear-pit like this?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;and were not
&gt;&gt; so locked into the Stratfordian homosexual
&gt;&gt; interpretation (or some such), you might
&gt;&gt; begin to understand them.

&gt; Oh dear. I am not locked into a homosexual interpretation, although it
&gt; strikes me as the likeliest scenario at present. And by the way, at least
&gt; three quarters of Oxfordians are agree with a homosexual interpretation.

"/>

I doubt that. Firstly, they don't have
much of a choice -- except between the
appalling and the execerable. Secondly,
few express opinions, and certainly not
strong ones. Thirdly, like you, they've
swallowed all that Stratfordian garbage,
and have ceased to be capable of
thought on the matter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It has nothing to do with what the traditionalists say.
&gt; It has everything to do
&gt; with what the sonnets appear to be saying.

"/>

Homosexual interpretations are beyond
the hopeless. Insofar as they have been
expressed at all, they are the incarnation
of shallowness -- not that they are much
worse than the standard crap with which
we are served. But they are worse -- hard
as that is to achieve.

Paul, you and I are just going to have to disagree
on whether it is understandable that admirers will gaze at
the object of their admiration.

However, after reading this sonnet one more time, I
realized there is another answer to your original question:
&quot;Who is doing the gazing?&quot; And that other answer is: &quot;The
addressee himself.&quot;

That is, the poet is again noting the narcissism of
the addressee. And, if you're correct that, at times, the
word &quot;gaze&quot; has a critical connotation, that would work in
this connection.

This interpretation would also link up with line 7.
Rather than mating and having babies, the addressee is
spending his time narcissistically gazing at himself. Thus
when he is asked, when he is old and has lost his beauty,
where his beauty is, all he will be able to say is - within
his own deep-sunken eyes.

He's not my fellow traveller, and of course not. You know I condemn that
disgusting kind of message. And just in case you don't get it, Paul, I'm

Are you now appeasing an hysteric? Someone who bemerds others from one year
to the next is now seeking sympathy from auntie Lynn? ROFL! How come you
don't condemn 'disgusting messages' from all sources?

Paul's sentiment is of course completely discreditable, however, it does not
emerge from any sort of pattern in his writing about Nil or anyone else that
I have ever read. It seems like an exclamation born of frustration.

Maybe Nil should just lively up himself and don't be no drag? Or is it too
much personal responsibility to write publicly about a hobby activity
without non-stop slagging others off?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While I will not speak for Mrs. Kositsky or Mr. Reedy, I think
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; answer is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probably &quot;No&quot;. It is a resounding &quot;No&quot; in my case.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What a deprived childhood you all had.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I blame TV.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; More like the absence of it. I was always reading as a child. Being
a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; published writer - even if only on chess - is the fulfilment of a
&gt;&gt;&gt; childhood
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dream.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's the difference between us, Paul. My childhood dream was to be
a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writer. Yours is to swim in a full chamber-pot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry to hear you never got past Freud's &quot;anal stage&quot; of
&gt;&gt; development,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Paul.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had a normal &quot;pre-TV&quot; childhood, experiencing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all that normal children have had for tens of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thousands of generations.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Aside from your interest in &quot;shitting contests&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I got over the &quot;anal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stage&quot;. That is almost certainly your problem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (and that of Reedy). You were never allowed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to enjoy that stage and explore such matters.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What's to explore? I knew what it was when I swallowed it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The only remedy, it seems, will be to put it on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the National Curriculum. But, somehow, I doubt
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if that will work. The activity is necessarily
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; private and 'sub-rosa'

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And doesn't the idea of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; having one with the Queen of England have the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; potential for a certain amount of humour?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No? What a humourless git. Surely anything
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be better than this? Have you tried
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suicide?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is it newsgroup cranks save their venom for me? Two years ago

&gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with what the traditionalists say.
&gt;&gt; It has everything to do
&gt;&gt; with what the sonnets appear to be saying.

&gt; Homosexual interpretations are beyond
&gt; the hopeless. Insofar as they have been
&gt; expressed at all, they are the incarnation
&gt; of shallowness -- not that they are much
&gt; worse than the standard crap with which
&gt; we are served. But they are worse -- hard
&gt; as that is to achieve.

"/>

The Author of the Works aside, wasn't it commonplace and even universal to
write sonnets and other verse forms, replete with Elizabethan gallantries,
in favour and honour of other men?

This may or may not be 'homosexual' in our modern use of the term, but
nothing in particular recommends it to be so as a prescription.

In the work, did the sonnet writer get rather tiried by that delimited form?
Rowse has suggested that he did, and abandoned it to compass a greater sense
of possible expression in playwriting. It would be of interest to know if
this departure was also synchronous with a developing association with and
appreciation of women.

Regardless of the outer identity of the writer, Rowse makes an interesting
psychological point as may be evidenced from the respective scope of the
first works and the latter sonnets.

Cordially, Phil

An aside: Even as late as only 20 years ago we automatically preferred
the masculine pronoun 'he' when speaking in a generic first person tense.
Did this carry any sense of excluding 'she'? It is a factor of the
awkwardness of English, that we are indifferent to both Latin senses of
'man'; vir and homo, and also counfound the L. homo with Greek homo.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with what the traditionalists say.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It has everything to do
&gt;&gt;&gt; with what the sonnets appear to be saying.

&gt;&gt; Homosexual interpretations are beyond

&gt;&gt; expressed at all, they are the incarnation
&gt;&gt; of shallowness -- not that they are much
&gt;&gt; worse than the standard crap with which
&gt;&gt; we are served. But they are worse -- hard
&gt;&gt; as that is to achieve.

&gt;The Author of the Works aside, wasn't it commonplace and even universal to
&gt;write sonnets and other verse forms, replete with Elizabethan gallantries,
&gt;in favour and honour of other men?

ARE there any other major Elizabethan sonnet cycles
addressed to a man?

And while there may be individual poems written, how
does their tone and content compare to the tone and contents
of Shakespeare's sonnets?

True.

This assumes that the sonnets were written at an
early date. There are those who think they were written in
the late 1590's, early 1600's.

Admirers will often _w a n t_ to gaze at a

people don't usually like being regarded

That is a very peculiar interpretation for

&gt; That is, the poet is again noting the narcissism of

There are only four words here: &quot;so gazed
on now&quot;. It's more of a passing comment.
While it's inherently critical (of the gazers)
it carries no hint of the narcissism you want

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This interpretation would also link up with line 7.
&gt; Rather than mating and having babies, the addressee is

That would have been an unusual and

He wrote the sonnets because he 'got paid'

That amount of effort would not have been

"/>

We've had this argument before and it is totally ridiculous, Paul. I don't
agree with what I've seen of your exegeses because you have no grounds for
them. You say &quot;this sually means that, but in this case it means this...&quot;
with no reason for doing so. Or you suggest (no, state) elaborate contexts
for the sonnets for which you have no evidence whatsoever. At the same time,
you can't give parallels from other writers or any valid reason, for
example, for saying that when the poet says &quot;she&quot; he means &quot;she,&quot; but when
he says &quot;he,&quot; he means &quot;she&quot; also.

I would more readily accept the possibility that the so called &quot;dark lady&quot;
is Elizabeth (in which case the dark imagery would be just that--imagery),
and that she appears in the early sonnets as &quot;your mother&quot; or &quot;Beauty.&quot; That
would make some sense to me, although I could never say for sure that was
the case unless someone was able to come up with more evidence. But I cannot
accept the possibility that many of the early sonnets are addressed to her,
as it seems more reasonable to me, based on the language used by the poet,
that they are to a man. You appear to think that not only are they to a
woman (with a peculiar dearth of evidence) but that it fine to slag everyone
who is not of your opinion.

My mind has been changed many times over the years by reasonable argument. I
can see ambiguity and bawdry in poetry when there is evidence *of some kind*
that it may be there. I readily agreed with you, for example, that the
casket speech had strong elements of bawdry, though I had never thought of
it that way before. And I changed my mind (on the Shakespeare Fellowship
site) about a poem because of evidence Terry Ross presented which appeared
to me to be incontrovertible.

Your argument is not reasonable because it stretches the poems out of shape,
and has no regard for what's actually on the page. Nor are you ever amenable
to change, not one scintilla of change over thousands of emails, nor to
saying, &quot;I didn't know that before. That's very interesting.&quot; So I would
have to say it is you whose mind is shut.

Lynne

What parallels can you give for your (quasi-

writes homosexual poems to a young man
urging him to marry (either anyone or some
unnamed female) -- with the utmost urgency
--- so that he will be able to pass on his
'beauty'. It's a standard, well known theme
in all civilisations . . . ? In fact, you know
a modern Canadian one, just down your

Actually, Hank Whittemore has just done that. His book will be out soon. As
I've said before, he ties many of the events of the Essex rebellion to
specific words in the sonnets such as &quot;misprision.&quot; I don't say I'm
convinced, and I'm certainly not convinced about his &quot;Tudor Heir&quot; theory,
but I will say that from the little snippets I've heard so far from Hank,
I'm intriqued. And Lorenzo has given a very good example of why the
addressee might be Southampton. I've added a few more: He was around 17, he
was much younger than the poet (which makes sense given the words of the
poet in the sonnets) he was extremely important (we know this because he was
suggested as a candidate for the Knights of the Garter very early indeed),
he was balking at marriage to Oxford's daughter, he was very attractive in a
feminine way, he was the dedicatee of the two narrative poems, etc.

Lorenzo also suggests another &quot;fair youth,&quot; William Herbert, who fits the
Mr. W. H. of the dedication and was also of the right age and supposed to
marry a younger daughter of the Earl's.

Either of these young men are much better bets than Elizabeth, who was
1. Female
2. No longer young--even if you're forced to place the sonnets very early
3. Older than the poet, whether he was Shakespeare of Stratford, or, as we
believe, Oxford.
4. Not the kind of person one would make bawdy remarks about, although I

I can't show what is right with any, as in your exegesis of sonnet 18. When
we come to it again, I can go through it line by line, explaining when there
is no evidence for what you're saying. You are forcing the meaning beyond
any reasonable expectation of what the sonnet might be about; however, the
interesting thing to me about 18 is that there is no evidence that it is to
a man, and I'm not sure at all of the gender of the addressee. That is as
far as I can go, although I can make suggestions.

You will forgive me for not answering your other post, which is along the
same lines but I believe says we have no evidence that Oxford was a
homosexual. I'm sure Dr. Webb will be pleased to disabuse you of that notion
as he keeps telling all comers about Cogno, and as I mentioned this morning
on another thread, Rowse called Oxford a &quot;raging homo.&quot;

And you will forgive me for not discussing this any further with you. It is

&gt;&gt;&quot;Who is doing the gazing?&quot; And that other answer is: &quot;The

&gt;There are only four words here: &quot;so gazed

Hank won't even mention it.

numerous other speeches in the plays along
similar lines -- where Elizabeth-type figures are
addessed by Oxford-characters in exceedinly
bawdy terms (such as the Lady Olivia in Twelfth
Night, Queen Gertrude in Hamlet, Titania in
MSND, and many more). Simply translate that

I've only just started looking at this thread, and it's just too long to
read every post, so if I'm re-hashing anything said elsewhere, I beg your
indulgence.

A few years back I read a novel set in the Paris of the 1920s. I can't
remember the author, but it might have been Henry Miller. One phrase caught
my attention, something that went (roughly) &quot;the grey, wasted faces of
onanists&quot;. It made me pause because it seemed an oddly old-fashioned
observation. I had the idea that even by the turn of the century, Victorian
ideas about the destructive effects of masturbation were dying out. The
Victorians, of course, famously propagated the idea that it caused
blindness, but that detail was part of a general belief that it was a
physically-debilitating as well as a morally-reprehensible practice.

What also gave me pause was that I had recently read a glancing reference to
it in another book, one emanating from an older culture that was
uncontaminated with Victorian morals - namely, Hindu yoga. The author, or
guru, spoke about chastity and continence, using phrases like &quot;loss of
essence&quot; and &quot;enfeebled spirit&quot;, and suchlike, in a way that made it plain
he was talking of masturbation. It made me wonder if the Victorian belief
was as daft as I had previously thought it was. I don't know of any studies
done that show whether masturbation has destructive physical effects, but it
looks to me that the idea that it does have is one that is shared across
cultures, and must gain some credibility thereby. At any rate, it seems
reasonable to suppose that the belief in England pre-dates the Victorian age
and was probably shared by the Elizabethans.

It's hard not to read that imputation in this:-

Then being askt,where all thy beautie lies,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty daies;
To say within thine owne deepe sunken eyes,
Were an all-eating shame,and thriftlesse praise.

He isn't being accused of chastity or abstinence. The &quot;treasure of thy lusty
days&quot; sounds like a reference to his seed, which is flowing copiously, but
not into women. The imputation is that the youth's self-absorption will
leave its debilitating signs in his face, an image reinforced on the next
line by &quot;all-eating&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That is a very peculiar interpretation for
&gt;&gt;&gt;which you'd need much better support
&gt;&gt;&gt;from the words.

&gt;&gt; It's not all that peculiar, given that it's already
&gt;&gt; been established that the addressee is narcissistic.

&gt;Funny. I missed that. Do I have to believe
&gt;it nevertheless?

"/>

&quot;But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes&quot; 1.5

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is, the poet is again noting the narcissism of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the addressee. And, if you're correct that, at times, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; word &quot;gaze&quot; has a critical connotation, that would work in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this connection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;There are only four words here: &quot;so gazed
&gt;&gt;&gt;on now&quot;. It's more of a passing comment.
&gt;&gt;&gt;While it's inherently critical (of the gazers)
&gt;&gt;&gt;it carries no hint of the narcissism you want
&gt;&gt;&gt;to read in.

&gt;&gt; But more importantly, it doesn't exclude the
&gt;&gt; possibility that the adddressee is the one who is doing the
&gt;&gt; gazing. Plus we have the continuation in Sonnet 3, where
&gt;&gt; the poet starts off with &quot;Look in thy glass...&quot;.

&gt;If he was on about narcissism, we'd have
&gt;good hints here.

"/>

I think we do. The fact that he mentions the
addressee looking into his glass after he characterizes the
addressee as narcissistic is just that - another hint.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Whereas the poet only
&gt;talks about reproduction (of a face by a
&gt;face, btw) and later of seeing his/her
&gt;mother in his/her image.

"/>

HIS mother, Paul, his.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This interpretation would also link up with line 7.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rather than mating and having babies, the addressee is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spending his time narcissistically gazing at himself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That would have been an unusual and
&gt;&gt;&gt;a powerful attack. If the poet had
&gt;&gt;&gt;intended it, then he'd have made it clear.

&gt;&gt; Fascinating the way you are able to channel the
&gt;&gt; author.

&gt;Surely we expect this poet to say
&gt;what he means, and clearly?

"/>

Hmmmm...should we? Given the form of expression, a
poem, coupled with changes in language over four hundred
years, I can see some room for *some* ambiguity.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;He didn't
&gt;generally have much of a problem about
&gt;words, nor about expressing himself.
&gt;And surely when we find that his
&gt;expression is obscure, that is almost
&gt;invariably our own fault . . . in that
&gt;we are not grasping his sense?

"/>

I'm inclined to agree with that. But I don't find
his characterization of the addressee as narcissistic
particularly obscure.

On the other hand, if you're insisting that a
reading of a particular phrase or complete poem can only be
acceptable if *everyone* who reads it agrees with the
interpretation in all its nuances, then we're screwed.

I think most accurately the addressee is being
accused of something he is NOT doing - ie he is not making
babies. What he is doing *instead* of making babies,
whether it is masturbation, celibacy, or whatever, isn't
really the main issue for the poet.

I think the imputation is that, over time, the
addressee will, quite naturarly, lose his looks. Then the
world will demand an accounting of what he did with his
beauty. And all the addressee will be able to do is to
point to his own old eyes, which is where all his beauty
went, as he spent all his time gazing at himself in his

I don't know the answer to your specific question, but I'd guess
there's probably a similarity between all civilizations that have

Yes that's the general meaning. But secondary, more concrete meanings, are
not disqualified thereby. My hypothesis that Shakespeare was making veiled
references to masturbation does not materially change the overall message of
the poem. It's still a plea to the addressee to reproduce himself, and it's
still addressed to a man, not a woman.

As before, general overall meanings do not preclude secondary ones.
Shakespeare's wording often sends the meaning along parallel tracks. If
there is a secondary track being explored here, it is not in contradiction
to the main one.

I can't. I can _parse_ this passage, to see what its grammatical
structure is, but I don't feel I can _reliably_ construe Lewis's
meaning. If I were reading this novel for pleasure, I'd probably
decide on a meaning and go on, but I might also decide I couldn't make
anything out of it and decide I couldn't understand Lewis, either
because of cultural differences between us or because he hadn't been a
careful enough writer, or both. If the novelist was aware of the
problems that could arise in interpreting this passage, presumably
he'd have made sure the rest of the book explained better how it
should be read.

There seems to be only one idea in the passage. This main idea is not
stated explicitly (at least as main idea), but is implied by the two
comparisons made in the two sentences. It seems that each of these
two sentences states the same idea. The first sentence introduces the
idea, and the second sentence restates the same idea, explaining it
more fully. I might want to change this conclusion after seeing more
of the context.

The main idea seems to have to do with inquiry. It is the only idea
that is mentioned in both sentences, and more of the words in the
passage discuss inquiry than either of the other two ideas. Inquiry
is more abstract than thirst, so it's more likely to be something a
person would discuss (especially in the disputatious way that appears
in this passage), and masturbation seems to be explaining inquiry,
rather than the other way around. It appears that the speaker, in
this passage of dialogue, is criticizing what his listener or
listeners believe, concerning inquiry.

Inquiry is compared to two successive things: thirst and masturbation.
The purpose of thirst is water; similarly, the purpose of inquiry is
truth. In other words, a person needs water and thirst ensures he
will want to get water; similarly with truth. Inquiry is _supposedly_
for the purpose of exercising intelligence, thus using intelligence
properly, in the same way that one might suppose masturbation to be a
proper use of the same thing that is properly &quot;used&quot; in marriage
(i.e., obviously, sex). However, it is asserted that inquiry is _not_
such a proper use.

The grammar of both sentences presupposes someone or something who
&quot;made&quot; thirst and water, and who &quot;gave&quot; intelligence, but a
non-religious person might use these verbs without thinking,
necessarily, that there was a God involved in the process. Without
knowing more about Lewis, his own theology, and this particular
character, I couldn't say much about his implying that physical traits
have specific purposes, other than to say that the character seems to
feel that arguing morals from inferred purpose in this way is a good
way to argue.

Because I do know something about Lewis and about the controversies of
the time, I could say a very little bit about the conflict that he
appears to be referring to, but not much about the opinion expressed
in this particular passage. I assume that somebody more familiar with
C.S. Lewis might be able to make a bit more of it.

The context is rather extended, but to give it simply, the character
being addressed is a left-wing bishop who went to Hell for his apostasy.
He's been given a day trip to Heaven, to give him a chance to change
his mind. (The entire novel is about a bus load of such characters.)
All he has to do is admit that he was wrong. Heaven is real. (He's
there now.) Hell is real. (He just came from there.) But, no, he'd
rather get back to his little theological society in Hell and discuss
&quot;what Jesus's mature teachings would have been if he'd only lived
longer....&quot;

&gt; I've only just started looking at this thread, and it's just too long to
&gt; read every post, so if I'm re-hashing anything said elsewhere, I beg your
&gt; indulgence.

&gt; A few years back I read a novel set in the Paris of the 1920s. I can't
&gt; remember the author, but it might have been Henry Miller. One phrase
caught
&gt; my attention, something that went (roughly) &quot;the grey, wasted faces of
&gt; onanists&quot;. It made me pause because it seemed an oddly old-fashioned
&gt; observation. I had the idea that even by the turn of the century,
Victorian
&gt; ideas about the destructive effects of masturbation were dying out. The
&gt; Victorians, of course, famously propagated the idea that it caused
&gt; blindness, but that detail was part of a general belief that it was a
&gt; physically-debilitating as well as a morally-reprehensible practice.

&gt; What also gave me pause was that I had recently read a glancing reference
to
&gt; it in another book, one emanating from an older culture that was
&gt; uncontaminated with Victorian morals - namely, Hindu yoga. The author, or
&gt; guru, spoke about chastity and continence, using phrases like &quot;loss of
&gt; essence&quot; and &quot;enfeebled spirit&quot;, and suchlike, in a way that made it plain
&gt; he was talking of masturbation. It made me wonder if the Victorian belief
&gt; was as daft as I had previously thought it was. I don't know of any
studies
&gt; done that show whether masturbation has destructive physical effects, but
it
&gt; looks to me that the idea that it does have is one that is shared across
&gt; cultures, and must gain some credibility thereby. At any rate, it seems
&gt; reasonable to suppose that the belief in England pre-dates the Victorian
age
&gt; and was probably shared by the Elizabethans.

&gt; It's hard not to read that imputation in this:-

&gt; Then being askt,where all thy beautie lies,
&gt; Where all the treasure of thy lusty daies;
&gt; To say within thine owne deepe sunken eyes,
&gt; Were an all-eating shame,and thriftlesse praise.

&gt; He isn't being accused of chastity or abstinence. The &quot;treasure of thy
lusty
&gt; days&quot; sounds like a reference to his seed, which is flowing copiously, but
&gt; not into women. The imputation is that the youth's self-absorption will
&gt; leave its debilitating signs in his face, an image reinforced on the next
&gt; line by &quot;all-eating&quot;.

Thank you.

With just a little more information, like what &quot;left-wing&quot; meant at
the time in this context, and how Darwinism was seen in Britain at the
time (maybe also Nietzsche and a few others), and whether or not the
novel was a roman a clef, I could probably get the general idea.

But I'm helped by having read what Ursula Le Guin has said about Lewis
(whom it seems she doesn't like very much), in her reviews of his &quot;The
Dark Tower&quot; and of Doris Lessing's &quot;Canopus in Argus&quot; series, in
&quot;Dancing at the Edge of the World,&quot; which I recommend highly
(especially &quot;The Fisherwoman's Daughter,&quot; which kind of takes off from
&quot;A Room of One's Own&quot;):

&quot;For eighty or ninety years [as of 1977] a school of writing has
flourished that might be called the Inside Club. Although its favored
territory begins at the gates of the British public school, outsiders
are quite welcome if they have very good brains and can adopt the
manner.... None of the Bloomsbury crowd ever even visited the Club,
for a rebellious conscience disbars one automatically. The writing of
detective fiction, on the other hand, is almost an entree; mysteries
lend themselves too well to the snobbery of superior knowledge.... By
breeding, education, profession, and conviction, C.S. Lewis was a
resident member of the Inside Club, and unlike Eliot or Kipling, he
seldom ventured out into the dark.... &quot; (242)

&quot;The spitefulness shown towards women in these tales is
remarkable....
&quot;There's a good deal of hatred in Lewis, and it is a frightening
hatred, because this gentle, brilliant, lovable, devout man never saw
the need even to rationalize it, let alone apologize for it. He was
self-righteous in his faith. That may be permissible to a militant
Christian; but it is not permissible to a highly intelligent, highly
educated man to be self-righteous in his opinions and his prejudices.
Only membership in the Inside Club gives that sanction.&quot; (243)

&quot;Lessing mentions Olaf Stapledon in her introduction, and in scope the
book ... indeed vies with _Last and First Men_; but the almost
obsessive organization, the unity of Stapledon's thought, is wanting.
The majesty of the vision is fitful. Sometimes it is majestic,
sometimes it is little more than a pulp Galactic Empire with the
Goodies fighting the Baddies. Then again it goes off into allegory,
like C.S. Lewis, for a while; and there are moments -- the bad
moments, for me -- when it all seems to have been inspired by the
Velikovsky-Von Däniken school of, as it were, thought.&quot; (249-250)

&quot;[T]he logic of the book is inescapable: humanity is incapable of
doing good on its own, without direct and continual prompting by
Benevolences from Outer Space....
&quot;To find this ... ethic stated by a considerable writer, no hack
or crank, is disquieting to me. Though _Shikasta_ is not a Christian
book, I think it is a Calvinist one: it affirms the radical
irresponsibility of mankind....&quot;(250-251)

(quote)
The Dark Tower and Other Stories
Author: C.S. Lewis
Co-author(s): Walter Hooper

First time published: 1977, Collins

SHORT STORY COLLECTIONS

Synopsis
A haunting, memorable extension of C.S. Lewis's fantasies, these six
stories, not all complete, reveal once more the power and vision of
one of the greatest of storytellers.

The Dark Tower itself is a draft of a possible fourth volume to follow
Lewis's acclaimed adult science fiction trilogy. Two characters -
Ransom and MacPhee - appear again, and the story contains sequences of
brilliant debate about matter in time and space.

Four stories and two fragments of novels, edited by Walter Hooper. One
of the stories and the title fragment were not previously available.

Contents:
The Dark Tower
The Man Born Blind
The Shoddy Lands
Ministering Angels
Forms of Things Unknown
After Ten Years

Three of these six items have turned out not to be by Lewis after all:
&quot;The Dark Tower&quot;, &quot;The Man Born Blind&quot; and &quot;Forms of Things Unknown.&quot;

? Onanism is a /cant/ phrase for masturbation. However, that is not the

No meaning is determined by the writer alone, but by interaction with the

The formation 'onanism' is no doubt confounded with the Greek word Onon,
