A waiter at a Mexican restaurant has been jailed after admitting
touching the bottoms of 12 women.

Marco Lozano, 36, grabbed the women's buttocks as they walked in streets
across Edinburgh, the city's Sheriff Court was told.

He later told police he particularly liked European women as he
considered them to be more beautiful than those in his native Mexico.

Lozano was jailed for a year, with two years on licence after his
release.

He was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register.

'That's what we do in Mexico' he had said.

Lozano, who came to Edinburgh in 2006 and lived in the Gorgie area of
the city, had previously admitted assaulting 12 women by seizing or
touching their buttocks.

The assaults took place between 15 May and 10 July this year, nine of
them in Princes Street, two in Gorgie Road and one in Shandwick Place.

On nine occasions, Lozano grabbed the women's bottoms. He also slapped
one, touched one and rubbed one.

Lozano, who worked as a waiter at Pancho Villas restaurant in the High
Street and Viva Mexico in Cockburn Street, was arrested after being
identified through CCTV footage.

Defence agent Steve Donald told Sheriff Gordon Liddle that there did not
appear to be any reason why Lozano had acted in the way he did.

He said his client, who was said to have been depressed and lonely after
losing contact with his children in America, claimed there was no sexual
gratification, adding: &quot;His position is he was looking for some kind of
response, some reaction.

&quot;He told the police he was just playing. 'That's what we do in Mexico'
he had said. It was a cultural difference.&quot;

Describing the case as &quot;bizarre&quot;, Sheriff Liddle told Lozano his
activities had caused a lot of distress to a lot of people and that a
custodial sentence had to follow.

What is really bizarre is a Mexican national working in Europe with kids in
the US....  he's a Mexican national for Pete's sake... why aren't his kids
in Mexico or in Europe with him?  I guess its a cultural thing and part of
those Mexican family values why Mexicans have a habit of abandoning their
anchors in another country.

You may think that &quot;America&quot;  means only the US.  Probably the English
do not.
