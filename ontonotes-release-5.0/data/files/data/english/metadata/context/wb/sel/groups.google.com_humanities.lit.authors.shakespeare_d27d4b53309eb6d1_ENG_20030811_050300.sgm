_Poor Confusing Elpenor_ by Gerald R. Lucas

&lt;&lt;Near the end of his stay with Circe in Book X of the Odyssey, Odysseus and
crew prepare to leave Aiaia and head for the Underworld. It wasn't his idea:
Circe told him to go to hell. Well, what does he expect? He hung out with
her for a year, ate her food, shared her &quot;flawless bed of love,&quot; and one
day - from the prompting of his men - decides to leave, and fairly urgently
judging by what happens to Elpenor.

Apparently, this idiot climbed up on the roof of Circe's barn, or some other
obscure part of her house, and proceeded to drink enough wine to cause him
to pass out. There he slept, like a drunken little piggie, all night, until
the voices of the crew preparing to leave woke him up. Maybe he was still
drunk, but he stirred and fell off the roof - probably forgot he had climbed
up there &quot;to taste the cool night&quot; - breaking his neck, and killing himself
instantly. A true hero's death.

In all their hasty preparation to get out of town, no one saw Elpenor fall,
nor did they miss him at all. Instead, they sailed straight to hell; only
then did they encounter his shade. Odysseus seemed surprised as he listened
to his dead oarsman's sob story. The latter asks Odysseus to return to
Aiaia - apparently Circe's island is on the way to hell - and give him a
proper burial: &quot;Heap up the mound there, and implant upon it / the oar I
pulled in life with my companions&quot; (XI.87-88). Now, I'm not one to knit-pick
(OK, maybe I am), but you'd think they'd miss one of their oarsmen. Maybe
Elpenor had halitosis, BO, or some other execrable quality that the rest of
the men found offensive, so he had no friends, relegated to spending time on
roofs with bottles of wine. Maybe he was too stupid to have any friends.
Yet, if he made it through the Trojan war, he can't be too dumb.

Anyway, I'm just wondering what this episode is doing in the text in the
first place. It spans three books, X-XII, and just seems to be an
afterthought - another repetitive incident to annoy students and professors
alike.

I will assume that since Books IX though XII are narrated by Odysseus, the
Elpenor episode is important to his journey and personal growth somehow.
Perhaps the Odysseus that forgets Elpenor on Aiaia is not the same one that
returns to bury him after chatting with the Underworld's grim gathering of
shades. Maybe seeing the shade of his dead crewman, even someone as
seemingly insignificant as an oarsman, struck Odysseus in a way that seeing
the heroes of the Trojan war doesn't. Or, seeing Elpenor in the same state
that Achilles and Agamemnon are in finally makes him realize that death is
the great leveller. No matter one's position while alive, everyone comes to
the same place eventually. Therefore, everyone deserves to be treated fairly
and humanely while alive. This lesson is similar to the one that Gilgamesh
eventually brings home to Uruk.

Sounds good, and I wish I could believe it, but much of Odysseus' subsequent
actions suggest that he does not learn this lesson, or is still learning it
as he travels home. Sure, he returns to bury Elpenor, but lets Circe talk
him into traveling past the sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, and other perils
as well. This he does without even seeing if there was another way, knowing
full well that his men would be eaten by Scylla, perhaps swallowed by
Charybdis, and lose their lives on the Island of the Sun. However, we do see
the integral parts that the swineherd and cowherd play in Odysseus'
subsequent battle with the suitors; had it not been for them, Odysseus might
not have been victorious.

Poor confusing Elpenor: you'll be remembered as an idiot who fell off the
roof, but one who became important after Odysseus' life lesson in the
underworld. Any other ideas about Elpenor?&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;The wild and the tamed falcon each have different symbolic
meanings analogous to unconverted and converted man.
Wild falcons represent the unconverted Gentile &amp; sinful thoughts or
deeds. But, the tamed bird symbolizes the Christian convert with
his lofty thoughts, hopes, &amp; aspirations. During the Middle Ages,
paintings of falcons attacking hares depicted the victory of the
Christian over lusty temptations. Roofers noticing that falcons
sometimes took on the shape of roofing hammers,
used this bird as a symbol of their trade.&gt;&gt;

For there he keeps his court, it is his kingdom,
That's his best master-piece; yet 'tis the roof
And ceiling of the world; that may be called
The head or crown of earth, and yet that's bald,
All creatures in it bald; the lovely sun,
Has a face sleek as gold, the full-cheeked moon,
As bright and smooth as silver: nothing there
Wears dangling locks, but sometimes blazing stars,
Whose flaming curls set realms on fire with wars.
Descend more low, look through man's five-fold sense;
Of all, the eye bears greatest eminence,
And yet that's bald; the hairs, that like a lace
Are stitched unto the lids, borrow these forms,
Like penthouses, to save the eyes from storms.

&lt;&lt;Alan Young's _Tudor &amp; Jacobean Tournaments_ . . . recounts Oxford's
participation in one of his last tournaments (prior to his imprisonment
in the Tower), at Whitehall, on 22 January 1581. The circumstance of
this contest was the Earl of Arundel's &quot;friendly&quot; challenge to knightly
gallants as one Callophisus, a Lover of Beauty, to which challenge
responded, among others, Lord Windsor, Sir Philip Sidney, Sir William
DRURY, and Lord Oxford. Young tells us that all of the respondents
to Arundel's challenge at Whitehall styled themselves, rather
unpretentiously (save one!), by such unimaginative nomenclature as the
Red Knight, the White Knight, and the Blue Knight-- but, according
to Young, &quot;the Earl of Oxford appeared in the Whitehall tiltyard

St. Vincent of Saragossa/Aragon)

&lt;&lt;Governor Dacian was doing his utmost to stamp out Christianity in his
domain. He killed 18 believers in Saragossa in 303. It was during these
persecutions under Emperor Diocletian, that Vincent, the bishop, and the
priests were arrested, led away in chains, and imprisoned in Valencia.
Because Valerius suffered from a speech impediment,
Vincent acted as his spokesman.

Vincent underwent terrible tortures; he had resisted turning over his
church's sacred books, and sacrificing to false gods. He was stretched
upon a rack, torn with metal hooks, and laid upon a frame of sharp iron
bars heated from beneath by fire. When even this diabolic cruelty failed
to break his will, he was thrown into a dungeon the floor of which was
strewn with broken crockery that added to the agony of his already
lacerated body.

Vincent declared that God sent the angels of heaven to comfort him.
His cell, he said, was illuminated with a heavenly light, and might have
been filled with roses (the gift of scent), so sweet was its fragrance.
He sang hymns as he suffered, so that even the jailer was astounded.

On hearing this, the Roman governor was infuriated, but finding all his
efforts to unnerve his victim were useless, gave orders for the torture
to stop--perhaps to win Vincent by clemency or to prevent him from
becoming a martyr.

For a time Vincent had some relief. The faithful were permitted to gaze
upon his broken body, probably in the hope that they would abandon their
faith. Instead, they came in troops, kissed the open sores, and carried
away as relics cloths dipped in his blood. The gentle hands of Christian
women tended his wounds. But he did not survive long and died of his
injuries in prison in 304 or 305.

When he died, the anger of the authorities was renewed and followed him
to his grave. His body was thrown into a bog as prey to the wild birds
and beasts, but it was strangely preserved it is said by the protection
of a raven. When any wild beast or bird tried to attack the mortal
remains of the saint, the raven drove them away. Thwarted, Dacian had
Vincent's body tied to a stone and cast into the sea. But in the night
it was washed ashore, and again loving hands gave it reverent care
and secret burial.

He was the protomartyr of Spain. The fame of Saint Vincent spread
very rapidly and far, as Saint Augustine testifies, in a sermon,
that his cultus extended to every part of the Roman Empire.

Several churches in England were dedicated to his honor in the Middle
Ages. Vincent is listed in the Old English Martyrology and many
pre-Conquest calendars. Abingdon, which acquired many of
his relics in the 12th century, graded his feast at the highest level.

He is the patron of bakers, roof-makers, sailors, schoolgirls,
vine-dressers, vintners (Roeder), tile-makers, and roofers.&gt;&gt;

Elpenor &amp; Eutychus

Elpenor's ghost tells Odysseus, &quot;it was all bad
luck, and my own unspeakable drunkenness.&quot;

Review of Dennis R. MacDonald's book,
The Homeric Epics and the Gospel of Mark

Joseph Francis Alward

&lt;&lt;In the first chapter of his book, The Homeric Epics and the Gospel of
Mark, MacDonald offers a story from Homer's epic, The Odyssey, about a
half-sleeping young man dying in a fall from a roof as the basis of a
fictional story by gospel writer Luke in which a sleeping young man dies in
a fall from the third floor of a building. In the former story, the ghost of
the dead young man (Elpenor) proclaims his &quot;bad luck&quot;; in the latter story
by Luke, the dead young man is lucky to have a man empowered by God to bring
him back from the dead. It's no coincidence that Luke calls the young man
&quot;Eutychus&quot;: the word means &quot;Lucky.&quot;

Luke's Eutychus and Homer's Elpenor:
Acts 20:7-12 and Odyssey 10-12

&lt;&lt;ACCORDING to Acts 20:7-12, a young man named Eutychus, sitting on a third
story windowsill, dosed off and fell to his death because of Paul's
longwinded preaching. Paul then raised him back to life.

7. On the first day of the week, when we convened to break bread, Paul spoke
to them, and because he wanted to leave the next day, he prolonged his
speech until midnight. 8. There were plenty of lamps in the upper room where
we were gathered. 9. A certain young man named Eutychus was seated at the
window and was carried off by a deep sleep, because of Paul's having spoken
for so long. Carried off by sleep, he fell from the third story and was
lifted up dead. 10. Paul went down, laid upon him, embraced him, and said,
&quot;Don't raise a ruckus! His soul (psuchê) is in him.&quot; 11. Paul went back
upstairs, broke bread, and once he had eaten and had spoken for a long time,
until dawn, he left. 12. Then they fetched the lad, alive, and were not a
little relieved.

On the surface, the text seems quite straightforward, but a closer reading
discloses several peculiarities. Here are but a few.

1. The change of narrator. The passage begins in the first person plural,
e.g. &quot;we convened,&quot; but switches to the third person in vs. 9. The narrator
retains the third person throughout the story and reverts to the first
person in vs. 13: &quot;But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos.&quot; Such
changes of voice from first to third and back to first person is common in
ancient texts, but Luke could easily have maintained the first person plural
throughout and for some reason chose not to do so.

2. The presence of the lamps. In a story otherwise spare of details, one is
surprised to read &quot;There were plenty of lamps in the upper room&quot; (20:8).
Some interpreters have suggested that the excessive smoke from the lamps
made Eutychus want to sit near the window and ultimately caused him to fall
sleep,1 or that the lamps explain how Paul knew the lad had dropped out of
sight, or that by mentioning the abundance of lamps Luke indicated that the
celebration of the Eucharist was joyous.2 According to other scholars, Luke
fended off charges that Christian meetings were held in the dark for lewd
purposes.3 These lamps puzzled ancient readers too. A scribe of the western
textual tradition thought it more reasonable to supply the room with
fenestration instead of illumination, and thus changed lampades (&quot;lamps&quot;) to
hupolampades (&quot;little windows&quot;).

3. Eutychus's condition after the fall. Several interpreters have taken
Paul's declaration in vs. 10, &quot;His soul is in him,&quot; to imply that the fall
did not actually kill Eutychus but merely stunned him. When Paul embraced
him, the apostle detected a spark of life.4 Vs. 9, however, says
unambiguously that the boy died (êrthê nekros).5 But if Eutychus died, what
then does Luke mean that his soul was in him? At first glance, it would seem
reasonable to suppose that when Paul embraced the corpse he revived it,6 but
the text does not declare Eutychus alive until several hours later.

4. Eutychus's revival. Paul left the body where he had found it, went
upstairs to eat and speak until daybreak, and then walked off for Assos
(20:13). Only after Paul left did the believers in Troas raise the lad to
life. This ending obviously bothered the scribe responsible for a variant
reading that attributes the healing to Paul himself. In Codex Bezae, vs. 12
begins, &quot;and while they were saying their farewells, he fetched (êgagen) the
young man, alive.&quot;7

F. F. Bruce speaks for many interpreters: &quot;Luke probably intends us to
understand that his life returned to him when Paul embraced him. But it may
have been a few hours before Eutychus recovered consciousness.&quot;8 Such an
interpretation, though not impossible, stretches the apparent meaning of vs.
12, which implies that only after Paul had left for Assos was the lad
actually revived. Had Luke wished merely to claim that Eutychus then
regained consciousness, he surely would not have used the word zônta
(&quot;alive&quot;). What is more, although already in vs. 10 Paul tells his audience
not to lament, not until vs. 12 does Luke state that the believers took
comfort in his reviving (paraklêthêsan), presumably because not until then
did they observe any change in Eutychus's condition. Commentators have
attempted to remove vs. 11 or to reverse the order of vss. 11-12 to avoid
the awkward delay in Eutychus's revival.9

5. Theological and literary motivation. This is the only episode told of
Paul's visit to Troas, nothing is said concerning the content of his
preaching, Eutychus appears nowhere else in Acts, and apart from the
&quot;breaking of bread&quot; and Paul's ability to perform miracles, no major Lukan
theme occurs here. In comparison with most of Acts, this story seems to be
an unintegrated, elliptical mess.

Some interpreters have tried to resolve these problems by suggesting that
Luke infelicitously modeled the story after a written source or awkwardly
absorbed it from oral tradition. The most commonly proposed written
narrative behind Acts 20:9-12 is Elijah's raising of a widow's son in 1
Kings 17:17-24.

Elijah said to the woman, &quot;Give me your son.&quot; He took him from her breast
and brought him up to the upper room (uperôon) where he himself slept and
made him recline on the bed. Elijah cried out and said: &quot;Woe to me, Lord,
the witness of the widow with whom I am staying! You have done wrong in
killing her son!&quot; He breathed on the child three times, called on the Lord,
and said, &quot;Lord, my God, may the soul (psuchê) of this child return to him.&quot;
And so it did; the child cried out. Elijah brought him down from the upper
room into the house, and gave him to his mother, and said, &quot;Look, your son
is alive (zê)!&quot; (1 Kings 17:19-23 [LXX], see also 2 Kings 4:18-37)

Here and in Acts 20:7-12 a holy man revives a dead boy by lying upon him. In
both stories one encounters an upper room (uperôon): Elijah takes the lad up
to his room to revive him; Paul descends from the upper room to revive
Eutychus. Both stories comment on the status of the victim's spirit or soul.
Elijah prays, &quot;May the soul (psuchê) of this child return to him&quot;; Paul
declares, &quot;His soul (psuchê) is in him.&quot; One also might argue that Luke
intended this scene to establish Paul's power to raise the dead, in the
tradition of Elijah, Elisha, Jesus, and Peter. Even if 1 Kings 17 influenced
Luke's telling of the Eutychus story, this hypothesis cannot account for the
most vexing features of Acts 20:7-12, such as the emphasis on the many
lamps, Eutychus's fall from a windowsill, and especially Paul's delay in
reviving him, leaving the task for others to do after he had left.

Although apparently no one has suggested it, Luke might also have had in
mind Mark 5:35-43, the revival of Jairus's daughter, which Luke retold in
Luke 8:49-56. Both stories narrate the reviving of a young person (Mark
5:39, paidion; Luke 8:54, pais; Acts 20:12: paida). In both, once notified,
the healer goes to the corpse, rebukes the crowd for lamentation, and states
that the victim is not dead (in the case of Jairus's daughter) or that the
victim's soul is still in him (in the case of Eutychus). In both stories the
declaration that the child was not dead preceded the revivification itself,
and both also contain the motif of sleep. Observe the parallels between the
speeches of Jesus and Paul to the onlookers.

Mark 5:39

And when he had entered,
he said to them (legei), &quot;Why do you raise a
ruckus (ti thorubeisthe) and weep?

&quot;Don't raise a ruckus (mh thorubeisthe). His soul is in him.&quot;

He said (eipen), &quot;Why do you weep?
Paul descended, fell on him, embraced him, and said (eipen),

The child is not dead but sleeps.&quot; Luke 8:52
She is not dead but sleeps.&quot; Acts 20:10

In order to support the dependence of Acts 20:7-12 on Mark 5 one also might
cite Acts 9:36-43, the healing of Dorcas, which Luke probably modeled after
this same Markan pericope.10 However, as was the case with the possible
influence of 1 Kings 17, the parallels between Acts 20:7-12 and Mark 5
cannot account for the most unusual and baffling aspects of the Eutychus
story: the lamps, the fatal fall, and the delay in Eutychus's revival until
the following morning.

SEVERAL commentators thus have argued that Luke inherited the Eutychus
episode from oral tradition. According to Martin Dibelius,

we are dealing with what was originally a secular anecdote, probably
containing a humorous undertone. Although the room was brightly lit, the boy
fell asleep: the length of the speech was the reason! But the speaker made
good the harm he had caused. How he did it, we do not know. It is improbable
that Christians with a literary education would have told of one of Paul's
deeds in this style. I should prefer to assume that a current anecdote had
come to be applied to Paul, that Luke found it in this form and introduced
it into his narrative.11

Furthermore, according to this proposal, one could explain the parallels
with 1 Kings 17 and Mark 5 by claiming that these texts merely informed
Luke's recording of the tale which he had heard.

Such a story might indeed have been the subject of oral narrative. Henry J.
Cadbury adduced a papyrus and an inscription about boys falling from
heights, one to his death, the other to blindness. The blind lad went to the
famous shrine of Asclepius at Epidaurus, &quot;supplicated the god and slept in
the temple and became well.&quot;12

Other scholars have found confirmation of the oral antecedents to Acts
20:7-12 from a similar story in The Acts of Paul. Patroclus, Nero's
cupbearer, sat on a windowsill of a Roman barn listening to Paul preach.
Like Eutychus, he fell to his death and was revived by the apostle. Pursuing
a suggestion of Wilhelm Schneemelcher,13 Willy Rordorf argued that the
author of The Acts of Paul did not know of the tale from the canonical Acts
but from oral tradition.14 Unfortunately, Rordorf does not make his argument
from an analysis of the stories themselves but from cumulative observations
concerning the relationship between Acts and The Acts of Paul.15 The two
stories do bear remarkable similarities-too many and too closely verbal to
have derived from oral tradition.16

Both young men, for example, come at night to a large building and both are
introduced as follows:

Acts 20:9: kathezomenos de tis neanias onomati Eutuxos

APl: Patroklos de tis oinochoos tou kaisaros
(a Greek variant of the APl, followed by the Latin, reads: kai tis oinochoos
tou kaisaros onomati Patroklos)
Both Eutychus and Patroclus, though young men, are called pais (&quot;child&quot;);
both sit on a windowsill; both listen to Paul speak, both fall and die.

Acts 20:9: kathezomenos ...epi ths thuridos ...dialegomenou tou Paulou epi
pleion, katenechtheis apo tou upnou epesen apo tou tristegou katô kai êrthê
nekros. (&quot;...sitting at the window, ...because of Paul's having spoken for
so long. Carried off by sleep, he fell from the third story and was lifted
up dead.&quot;)

APl: epi thuridos kathestheis upsêlês êkousen autou didaskontos ton logon
tou Theou. tou de ponêrou diabolou zêlountos thn agapên tôn adelfôn, epesen
o Patroklos apo tês thuridos kai apethanen. (&quot;sitting at a high window,
heard him teaching the word of God. Because the wicked devil was jealous of
the love of the brethren, Patroclus fell from the window and died.&quot;)
In both stories, people descend before Paul does and lift up the corpse
(Acts 20:9: êrthê; APl: arantes). Paul gives short speeches, the lads are
healed, and others lead them away alive (Acts 20:12: êgagon de ton paida
zônta; APl: kai kathisantes auton epi ktênos apepempsan zônta).

Furthermore, the story of Patroclus resolves many of the difficulties in
Acts 20:7-12. The Acts of Paul narrates the entire episode in the third
person, and there is no mention of the mysterious lamps. One can only guess
from Acts why Eutychus was perched on a windowsill, but The Acts of Paul
states explicitly that Patroclus did so because there was no room left
&quot;because of the crowd that had come to Paul.&quot; He did not fall asleep but
lost his balance because of the &quot;evil devil.&quot; Acts does not say how Paul
knew the boy had fallen, but the Paul of The Acts of Paul &quot;perceived it in
the spirit.&quot; Absent from the Patroclus story is the problematic phrase &quot;His
soul is in him.&quot; In its place, Paul asks the crowd to demonstrate their
faith. Then &quot;the lad received his spirit&quot;; that is, he was brought back to
life. There is no awkward delay between the soul being in the lad and his
being raised to life. Acts 20:12, stating that &quot;they fetched the lad alive,&quot;
has caused commentators to speculate concerning where they brought him. The
Acts of Paul declares clearly that Patroclus's destination was the imperial
palace. Moreover, the story of Patroclus is more integral to the ending of
The Acts of Paul than the story of Eutychus in Acts. Patroclus goes
immediately to Nero, states his intention to serve Christ instead of the
emperor, and thereby inflames imperial hatred for Paul. The author of The
Acts of Paul seems to have known the canonical Acts, fashioned Patroclus
after Eutychus, and removed several of Luke's difficulties. The Acts of
Paul, therefore, does not witness to an oral-traditional tale that Luke also
might have known; the similarities of between the stories derive from
literary dependence.

I PROPOSE a more economical solution to the peculiarities in Acts 20:7-12,
but one apparently never before advanced, namely, that Luke attempted,
somewhat infelicitously, to recast the story of Elpenor found in Books 10-12
of The Odyssey. Elpenor, the youngest of Odysseus's crew, asleep on a roof,
fell to his death in the middle of the night. Odysseus was unaware of the
tragedy until Elpenor's soul came to meet him from the netherworld. Later,
Odysseus gave Elpenor's corpse the requisite lamentation and burial. Because
of the popularity of Odysseus's visit to the netherworld in Odyssey Book 11,
the famous nekyia, Luke could assume that his more educated readers would
have recognized the similarities between the stories.17 Luke apparently
recast Homer's story in order to contrast Elpenor's lethal fall from Circe's
roof with Eutychus's good fortune at having died in the presence of a
wonder-working apostle. Here at last we have a reason for the lamps, the
fall, the delay of the revivification.

After having spent a year with the goddess Circe on her island home of
Aeaea, Odysseus insisted on continuing his journey back to Ithaca. Circe
provided a lavish dinner prior to the disembarkation, and Odysseus spent the
night with her, learning the magic he would need to summon from the dead the
blind seer Tiresias who could tell him how to find his way home. At break of
day, Odysseus woke his crew from their deep, dinner-induced sleep in order
to sail at once for their rendezvous with the dead. All sailed off but
Elpenor. Odysseus speaks:

There was one, Elpenor, the youngest (neôtatos) of all, not over valiant
(alkimos) in war nor sound of understanding, who had laid him down apart
from his comrades in the sacred house of Circe, seeking the cool air, for he
was heavy with wine. He heard the noise and the bustle of his comrades as
they moved about, and suddenly sprang up, and forgot to go to the long
ladder that he might come down again, but fell headlong from the roof
(tegeos pesen), and his neck was broken away from the spine, and his spirit
(psuchên) went down to the house of Hades. (Odyssey 10.552-60)18

Odysseus's ship took him to the edge of the world, where, in near total
darkness, he performed bloody necromantic rites in order to attract the
souls of the dead, especially that of Tiresias. To Odysseus's horror, the
first soul (psuchê) to meet him was that of Elpenor, who told the hero how
he had died and begged him to burn his corpse in full armor and to bury his
ashes with due rites.

Leave me not behind thee unwept and unburied as thou goest thence, and turn
not away from me, lest haply I bring the wrath of the gods upon thee. Nay,
burn me with my armour, all that is mine, and heap up a mound for me on the
shore of the grey sea, in memory of an unhappy man, that men yet to be may
learn of me. Fulfil this my prayer, and fix upon the mound my oar wherewith
I rowed in life when I was among my comrades. (11.72-78)

Odysseus promised.

Indeed, after he had won his traveling instructions from Tiresias, had seen
a host of the dead-including his mother, Achilles, Agamemnon, and
Heracles-and had witnessed the punishments of the wicked, Odysseus returned
to Aeaea where he beached the ship at night. Odysseus tells king Alcinous of
the Phaeacians what happened next.

As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, then I sent forth my
comrades to the house of Circe to fetch the body of the dead Elpenor.
Straightway then we cut billets of wood and gave him burial where the
headland runs furthest out to sea, sorrowing and shedding big tears. But
when the dead man was burned, and the armour of the dead, we heaped up a
mound and dragged on to it a pillar, and on the top of the mound we planted
his shapely oar. (12.8-15)

Because of his strategic location immediately prior to, at the beginning of,
and immediately following one of Homer's most memorable and controversial
episodes, Elpenor became an ancient household word,19 even in Christian
households. Clement of Alexandria, writing at the end of the second century
cited the example of Elpenor's fall in order to discourage drunkenness and
assumed that his readers would recognize the tale: &quot;just as Elpenor 'broke
his neck' (Odyssey 10.560) when he fell down because he was drunk.&quot;20

Before comparing Homer's Elpenor with Luke's Eutychus, I should emphasize
that many ancient authors, including some of Luke's contemporaries, modeled
fictional characters after the fallen youth in The Odyssey. I will begin
with Homer's most famous critic, Plato's Socrates, who expressed contempt
for Homer's nekuia in Books 2 and 3 of the Republic. The great poet,
complained Socrates, depicted the afterlife as a state of terror and
ignorance. The gods themselves recoiled at the sight of Hades, &quot;horrible,
noisome, dank&quot; (386d). Socrates took particular exception to Achilles'
statement that he would prefer the life of a slave on earth than to be king
of all the dead (386c, cf. Odyssey 11.489-91). Furthermore, the nekyia
provided no rewards for the righteous. Tales of life after death, thought
Socrates, must praise it if they are to befit &quot;the ears of boys and men who
are destined to be free and to be more afraid of slavery than of death&quot;
(387b).

At the end of the same work, Socrates provided his own interpretation of the
netherworld in order to replace Homer's version of life after death with one
that not only punished the wicked but also rewarded the righteous. &quot;It is
not, let me tell you,&quot; he says, &quot;the tale to Alcinous told [by Odysseus]
that I shall unfold, but the tale of a warrior bold (alkimou), Er, the son
of Armenius&quot; (614b). The use of the common Homeric adjective alkimos here
contrasts with Homer's description of Elpenor: &quot;not over valiant (alkimos)
in war&quot; (Odyssey 10.552-53).

He once upon a time was slain in battle, and when the corpses were taken up
on the tenth day already decayed, was found intact, and having been brought
home, at the moment of his funeral, on the twelfth day, as he lay upon the
pyre, revived, and after coming to life related what, he said, he had seen
in the world beyond. He said that when his soul went forth from his body he
journeyed with a great company and that they came to a mysterious region.
(Republic 10.614b-c)

Er then articulates a mythical account of reincarnation suitable to Plato's
Socrates. &quot;[H]ow and in what way he returned to the body he said he did not
know, but suddenly recovering his sight he saw himself at dawn lying on the
funeral pyre&quot; (621b). Plato's Socrates recast the tragic role of Elpenor
into that of Er who returned from the dead at dawn to give a more
satisfactory account of the afterlife than had Homer's Odysseus. Er himself
was a metaphor for Plato's understanding of the afterlife: reincarnation.

Compare the following:

Elpenor v. Er

A young soldier.

Not valiant (oute ...alkimos).

Er revived and told what he had seen.

L. Mestrius Plutarchus (c. 50-120 CE), Luke's contemporary, wrote two
stories about young men who visited the netherworld; the one most relevant
to Eutychus is that of Thespesius. This young man had squandered his youth
as a knave until he saw the punishments of the wicked in Hades for himself.
Like Homer's Elpenor,

He had fallen from a height and struck his neck, and although there had been
no wound, but only a concussion, he died away. On the third day, at the very
time of his funeral, he revived. Soon recovering his strength and senses, he
instituted a change in his way of life that could hardly be believed; for
the Cilicians know of no one in those times more honest in his engagements,
more pious toward heaven, or more grievous to his enemies and faithful to
his friends; so that all who met him longed to hear the reason for the
difference, supposing nothing ordinary could have caused so great a
reformation in character. Such indeed was the case, as appears from the
story as told by himself to Protogenes and other worthy friends.

He said that when his intelligence was driven from his body, the change made
him feel as a pilot might at first on being flung into the depths of the
sea. (Divine Vengeance 563d-e)

With respect to his fatal fall, the youth imitates Elpenor, but in his visit
to the netherworld, he is more like Plato's Er. Plutarch narrates at some
length what the youth had seen in Hades, the fates of righteous and wicked
souls (565a-b). Thespesius, too, learned that he had not died; rather,
&quot;through a divine dispensation [you] are present here in your intelligence,
having left the rest of your soul (psuchên), like an anchor, behind in your
body&quot; (564c). He also learned, as Odysseus had from Tiresias, the
circumstances of his own death. Odysseus saw his mother emerge from Hades to
drink the blood from the trench; Thespesius &quot;caught sight of his own father
emerging from a pit, covered with brands and scars, stretching out his arms
to him&quot; (566f). After receiving their appropriate punishments, many souls
then reincarnate (567f.).

In this tale, Plutarch obviously has combined elements from Homer's nekyia
with Plato's myth of Er. The protagonist, Thespesius, plays the role of
Elpenor insofar as he fell from a height and died and was not buried for
three days. Because he came back to like just before he was buried, he also
can play the role of Er: he visited a netherworld similar to that envisioned
by Plato's Socrates and returned to life to tell his tale of reincarnation.
Thereafter he lived a virtuous life, the very goal Socrates desired when he
told the myth of Er. Compare the following:

Elpenor

Young man, not valiant or wise
Young man, a rogue

Fatal fall

Corpse unburied

Virgil was particularly fond of Homer's Elpenor and modeled two characters
after him in the nekuia of the Aeneid (Book 6). These two young warriors,
veterans of the Trojan War, sailed with Aeneas for Italy, and on the journey
they both perished prematurely and remained unburied because Aeneas was not
aware of their catastrophes. Virgil enveloped the tale of Misenus inside
that of Palinurus, siphoning off to one character some of Elpenor's traits,
leaving some for the other.

The pilot Palinurus led Aeneas' armada toward Italy, when, at midnight, the
god Somnus, or Sleep, overpowered him such that he fell overboard into the
sea, undetected by anyone. &quot;Hardly had a sudden slumber begun to unbend his
limbs when, leaning above, Sleep flung him headlong into the clear waters,
tearing away, as he fell, the helm and part of the stern, and calling oft
times vainly on his friends&quot; (5.857-60). Aeneas proceeded to Cumae, the home
of the Sibyl and the entrance to Hades. The goddess told him how to enter
the nether gloom so that he could consult his father Anchises concerning his
route to Rome. First, however, Aeneas must remove the ritual pollution
caused by an unburied corpse. The corpse was not that of Palinurus but of
the young soldier Misenus who likewise had perished at sea. On his voyage
for Italy, Misenus-no Elpenor-like wimp but a fortissimus heros (6.169)-had
recklessly blown into a conch shell as though summoning troops to battle:
&quot;jealous Triton caught and plunged him in the foaming waves amid the rocks&quot;
(173-74). Like Odysseus who knew nothing of Elpenor's fall until he saw him
in the netherworld, Aeneas was ignorant of Misenus's drowning until he saw
his corpse on the beach. Aeneas and company set out to bury the corpse at
once. They cut down an immense quantity of wood, washed, anointed, and
burned the body. Over his ashes they piled &quot;a massive tomb, with the
soldier's own arms, his oar and trumpet&quot; (see Aeneid 6.175-234).

Aeneas never met the soul of Misenus in the netherworld, as was the case
with Odysseus and Elpenor, but he did meet the soul of Palinurus, his
drenched pilot. When he first entered the netherworld, he saw along one bank
of the river Styx throngs of souls (animae) whom Charon the ferryman refused
to transport to the other side until their bodies had been buried or until
they had waited for one hundred years.

Lo! there passed the helmsman, Palinurus, who of late, on the Libyan voyage,
while he marked the stars, had fallen from the stern, flung forth in the
midst of the waves. Him, when at last amid the deep gloom he knew the
sorrowful form, he first accosts thus: &quot;What god, Palinurus, tore thee from
us, and plunged beneath the open ocean?&quot; (6.337-43)

Like Elpenor to Odysseus, Palinurus told Aeneas how he had died, and begged
him to bury his body. After speaking with Palinurus, Aeneas saw other fallen
Trojan heroes, including his own father Anchises, who, like a Tiresias, told
his son what would happen to him on is journey toward Rome and thereafter.
The following columns display the commonalties.

Writing about 170-180 CE, Luke's contemporary, Apuleius of Madauros, wrote a
large Latin novel about the peregrinations of a certain Lucius who, by
accidental magic, had turned himself into an ass. One of Apuleius's stories,
told by a thief, narrates the death of a lad named Alcimus (&quot;valiant&quot;), the
very property-the very Greek word-that Homer denied to Elpenor. Alcimus,
too, was foolish, died from a fall from a tall house at night, and was not
properly buried. Thus Apuleius calls him unlucky, like &quot;unfortunate&quot;
Elpenor. The thief speaks:

Alcimus, despite his cautious plans, could not attract the approving nod of
Fortune. He had broken into the cottage of an old woman who was asleep, and
had gone to the bedroom upstairs. Although he should have squeezed her
throat and strangled her to death at once, he chose first to toss her
possessions out through a fairly wide window, item by item - for us to pick
up, of course. He had already diligently heaved out everything else, but he
was unwilling to pass up even the bed on which the poor old lady was
sleeping; so he rolled her off the cot and pulled out the bedclothes,
evidently planning to throw them out the window too. But the wicked woman
groveled at his knees and pleaded with him. &quot;Please, my son,&quot; she said, &quot;why
are you giving a miserable old lady's poor shabby junk to her rich
neighbours, whose house is outside that window?&quot;

That clever speech cunningly deceived Alcimus, who believed that she was
telling the truth. He was doubtless afraid that what he had already thrown
out and what he was going to throw out later would be gift to someone else's
household and not his comrades, since he was now convinced of his mistake.
Therefore he leaned out of the window in order to take a careful survey of
the situation, and especially to estimate the fortunes of that house next
door which she had mentioned. As he was making this energetic and not very
prudent attempt, that old sinner gave him a shove; although it was weak, it
caught him suddenly and unexpectedly, while he hung balanced there and was
preoccupied with his spying. She sent him head over heels. Not to mention
the considerable altitude, he fell on a huge rock lying beside the house,
shattering and scattering his ribcage. Vomiting streams of blood from deep
within, he told us what had happened and then departed from life without
much suffering. We buried him as we had our other comrade, and so gave
Lamachus a worthy squire. (Metamorphoses 4.12)

The burial of Alcimus was no burial at all, but the wrapping of his corpse
in a linen cloth and a watery grave at sea (4.11). Observe the following
similarities:

Elpenor

Soldier at night
Thief at night

Not valiant (alkimos) and not foolish
Alcimus (&quot;Valiant&quot;) but foolish

&quot;Unfortunate&quot;
&quot;Could not attract the approving nod of Fortune&quot;

Body not buried, but later buried near the sea Alcimus
Body not buried, wrapped and thrown in the sea

I HAVE FOUND several other examples of the rewriting of the Elpenor story,21
but the ones presented thus far should suffice to demonstrate his popularity
in ancient literature. Apuleius's Alcimus is the most useful for our
purposes, for it suggests that the author expected his readers who were
familiar with Homer to derive additional pleasure from the story by
comparing it with the Elpenor incident in The Odyssey. I suggest that Luke
had the same expectation.

As we have seen, Luke's tale is a third-person narration nested in a
first-person-plural narration of Paul's voyage from Achaea to Troas. He
stayed there seven days, and just prior to leaving he and his companions
convened to &quot;break bread.&quot; Odysseus, too, told in the first person how his
crew had sailed to Circe's island, stayed there for a year, and enjoyed a
lavish banquet just before departing (Odyssey 10.476-79). According to
Homer, Elpenor fell asleep when &quot;darkness came on,&quot; when his comrades bedded
in Circe's &quot;darkened halls&quot; (megara skioenta, 10.479). Paul's upper room,
however, was full of lamps. Luke's care to mention these lamps probably
derives from a desire not only to contrast the upper room with Circe's dark,
mysterious home, but also to exculpate Paul for Eutychus's death. The lad
did not die for want of light but for want of attentiveness.22

Acts 20:9 contains several verbal resonances with Homer.

Odyssey 10.522: Elpênôr de tis eske neôtatos (&quot;There was one, Elpenor, the
youngest of all&quot;)

Acts 20:9: kathezomenos de tis neanias onomati Eutuchos epi tês thuridos (&quot;A
certain young man named Eutychus was seated at the window.&quot;)

Both phrases name the lad, call him a young man (neanias/neôtatos), and
contain the words de tis. Furthermore, neither Elpenor nor Eutychus had been
mentioned before in their host narratives.

Homer states that Odysseus's crew gave way to &quot;sweet sleep&quot; (glukon upnon,
10.549); Luke's Eutychus was overcome by &quot;deep sleep&quot; (upnô bathei and apo
tou upnou, 20:9). Homer supplies a reasonable motivation for Elpenor's
location on top of the roof. After a long day of eating and drinking, his
head abuzz with wine, he needed fresh air. Luke, on the other hand, does not
disclose why Eutychus perched on the windowsill, but a reader familiar with
The Odyssey might well have assumed that he, too, wanted ventilation in a
room full of lamps. Elpenor died when he woke up from his sleep; Eutychus
when he dozed off.

Luke's description of Eutychus's fall likewise echoes The Odyssey.

Odyssey 10.559 (=11.64): katantikru tegeos pesen (&quot;he fell down from the
roof&quot;)

Acts 20:9: epesen apo tou tristegou katô (&quot;he fell down from the third
story&quot;)

Both lines contain pesen or epesen (third-person-singular aorist of piptô,
&quot;fall&quot;), a form of kata (katantikru and katô, &quot;down&quot;), and some variation of
the word tegos (&quot;roof&quot;); in the genitive case (tegeos and tristegou).

Luke's choice of tristegon, &quot;third story,&quot; here is particularly suggestive.
It is a hapax not only in Luke-Acts, but also in the New Testament and in
contemporary Christian literature. The related words stegos, stegê, tegos
(&quot;roof,&quot;); from which tristegon derives, appear in Luke's writings only in
Luke 7:6, where stegê derives from Q (cf. Matt 8:8). Insofar as Luke prefers
dôma when referring to a roof,23 Luke's tristegon may have derived from the
tegos in Homer.

Because Elpenor's fall escaped Odysseus's attention, his body remained
unburied until the crew returned from the netherworld. This delay of burial
might account for the peculiar delay between Paul's stating that Eutychus's
soul was in him and the lad's actual revival. Twice Homer says that the soul
(psuchê) of Elpenor immediately rushed off to Hades (10.560 and 11.65). When
Odysseus conjured up souls from the netherworld, it was Elpenor's that first
greeted him (Prôtê de psuchê Elpênoros). On seeing him, Odysseus sobbed: &quot;I
wept, and my heart had compassion on him&quot; (11.55). Believers in Troas, on
the other hand, had no reason to lament, for unlike Elpenor's soul,
immediately and forever banished to Hades, Eutychus's soul returned to him
thanks to Paul's extraordinary powers. Even so, they boy did not yet return
to life. This would happen the next morning when those left in Troas lift
him up.

In the netherworld, Elpenor's soul asked Odysseus to return to Circe's
island to mourn and to bury his corpse (11.59-78), and the king of Ithaca
did so the following day, at dawn:

As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, then I sent forth my
comrades to the house of Circe to fetch the body of the dead Elpenor.
Straightway then we cut billets of wood and gave him burial where the
headland runs furthest out to sea, sorrowing and shedding big tears. But
when the dead man was burned, and the armour of the dead, we heaped up a
mound and dragged on to it a pillar, and on the top of the mound we planted
his shapely oar. (Odyssey 12.8-15)

Both here and in Acts 20:11-12 the resolution of the victim's plight does
not occur until dawn. Odysseus can only mourn and bury his dead comrade;
Paul's God raises Elpenor's counterpart back to life. Furthermore, Odysseus
himself did not fetch Elpenor's corpse, his comrades did, &quot;sorrowing and
shedding big tears&quot; (12.12). Similarly, Paul did not revive Eutychus's
corpse, his converts did, &quot;and were not a little relieved.&quot; Compare the
following lines.

Odyssey 12.10: oisemenai nekron, Elpênora tethnêôta (&quot;to fetch the body of
the dead Elpenor&quot;)

Acts 20:12: êgagon de ton paida zônta (cf. 20:9: êrthê nekros) (&quot;they
fetched the lad, living&quot;)

The following columns summarize the arguments made above.

Odyssey 10-12 v. Acts 20:7-12

1. Odysseus and crew leave Troy and sail back to Achaea

Paul and crew stop at Troy, having left Achaea to sail back
to Jerusalem

2. First person plural (most of book 10)

First person plural (20:1-8)

3. After a sojourn, a meal (10.466-77)

4. Circe's &quot;dark halls&quot; (10.479)

There were plenty of lamps in the upper room. (20:8)

deep sleep (upnô bathei, 20:9)

6. Switch to third person (10.552)

Switch to third person (20:9)

7. There was one, Elpenor, the youngest of all lying on the roof
(Elpênôr de tis eske neôtatos, 10.552)

A certain young man named Eutychus was seated at a window
(kathezomenos de tis neanias onomati Eutuchos epi ths thuridos, 20:9)

8. Elpenor fell from a roof
(katantikru tegeos pesen, 10.559=11.64)

Eutychus fell from the third story
(epesen apo tou tristegou katô, 20:9))

9. Elpenor's soul (psuchê) goes to Hades (10.560=11.65)

Eutychus's soul (psuchê) stays in him (20:10)

10. Delay in burying Elpenor until dawn of the next day (12.1-15)

Delay in raising Eutychus until dawn of the next day (20:11)

11. Associates fetch the body
(oisemenai nekron, Elpênora tethnêôta, 12.10)

Associates revive the body (êgagon de ton paida zônta, 20:12)

The parallels between these stories are more lexical, more detailed, and
more sequential than the rewritings of the Elpenor story by Plato, Plutarch,
Virgil, and Apuleius discussed earlier.

THE literary critic Gérard Genette would call Luke's manipulation of the
Elpenor story a &quot;hypertextual transvaluation,24 a common literary strategy
for replacing the values or perspectives of an earlier, targeted text (the
&quot;hypotext&quot;) with alternative values or perspectives. For such a strategy to
succeed, the hypertext must display, even if obscurely, its relationship to
the hypotext. Obviously, the strategy has not succeeded with modern readers
of Acts; no previous study of the text has suggested this relationship.
Furthermore, evidence of ancient readings provide little encouragement that
they understood the Homeric background either.25

On the other hand, two additional aspects of the story in Acts indicate that
Luke advertised its Homeric hypertextuality, even though his readers failed
to perceive it: the location of the story in Troas and the name Eutychus.

Troas, of course, is ancient Troy. To be sure, the city of Troy during
Luke's day was not precisely on the location of the ancient city, but it was
nearby, and the two were repeatedly identified with each other. No educated
ancient would have been numb to the Troy's rich mythological and Homeric
associations, including the nostos of Odysseus and Elpenor back to Achaea
from the Troad. By placing the story of Eutychus in Troy, Luke seems to be
hinting that one should read it in light of Troy's legacy.26

The most important hypertextual clue, however, is the name Eutychus. Homer
repeatedly emphasizes Elpenor's bad fortune. He simply forgot that he was
sleeping on a roof, died, and was not missed by the crew: &quot;we had left his
corpse behind us in the hall of Circe, unwept and unburied&quot; (11.53-54). The
young soldier survived the Trojan war, Laestrygonian cannibals, and
Polyphemus, only to step off Circe's roof to his doom. Elpenor himself
states that he was the victim of &quot;an evil fate&quot; (aisa kakê, 11.61) and calls
himself &quot;an unhappy man&quot; (andros dustênoio, 10.76). Odysseus too addresses
him as &quot;unfortunate&quot; (ô dustêne, 11.80) When Ovid referred to this story,
his single adjective for the lad was miser, &quot;wretched,&quot;&quot;unhappy.&quot;27
Eutychus, on the other hand, means &quot;lucky.&quot; Although usually one must avoid
putting too much stock in the meanings of personal names used in Acts, such
onomastics were commonplace in Greek literature, as early as Homer himself.
When Apuleius wished to call attention to his rewriting of the Elpenor story
he did so by naming his character Alcimus (&quot;Valiant&quot;) and declaring from the
outset his bad luck: he &quot;could not attract the approving nod of Fortune.&quot; In
light of the other similarities between the two stories, the selection of
the name Eutychus hardly seems accidental. Eutychus had the &quot;good fortune&quot;
(eutuchia) to have died when Paul was nearby to revive him.

If the hypothesis advanced here is correct-namely, that the story in Acts
20:7-12 is a hypertextual transvaluation of Homer's Elpenor-it bears weighty
implications for our understanding of Acts as a whole. First, Luke
apparently expected his primary audience (Theophilus, say) to have been
sufficiently aware of The Odyssey in order to decode the Eutychus story as a
clever transformation of a classical tale. Luke was writing for a
sophisticated reader.

Second, other passages of Acts, especially other we-passages, may also play
off against the Homeric epics or other Greek mythology. For example, the
story of Paul and Silas dragged off to prison for exorcising a slave girl
and their subsequent prison break has parallels in The Bacchae of Euripides.
Tiresias' prophecy to Odysseus concerning his death might compare with
Agabus's prophecy to Paul about his death.28 One also must not overlook the
famous shipwreck scene in Acts 27-28 and the story of the serpent at Malta.
Odysseus too faces dreadful monsters on islands and outlives them.29

Third, if the story of Elpenor lies behind that of Eutychus, it would add
support to those who suggest that Acts ought not be read as an historical
record but as an historical novel.30 One misses the point in the Eutychus
tale if one insists that Luke intended the reader to view it as an
historical event. Rather, Luke's &quot;Lucky&quot; in Troas is an alternative to
Homer's unlucky Elpenor on his way home from Troy.&gt;&gt;
