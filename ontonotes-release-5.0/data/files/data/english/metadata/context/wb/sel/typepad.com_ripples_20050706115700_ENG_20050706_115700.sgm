Identifying your market

So many people write books for noncommercial reasons that it's a
wonder that they sell any of them. When I say noncommercial, I mean
writing because they have something important to say, rather than to
feed themselves.

Noncommercial writing is what blogs are for. You write until the
fever leaves you, then you go back to real life and your job.

For the few writers who combine talent and good business sense,
identifying a market for a book is as important as what they put in it.
They write what experience has told them customers will buy.

For those of us who are new to the game, we have a couple of hard
choices. We can learn the &quot;rules&quot; of publishing and apply them
faithfully and hope that things will work out or we can start with the
position that the &quot;rules&quot; are probably out of date and figure
out what the real situation is today.

In a changing marketplace, old rules can become obsolete while you
are writing your book. What worked last year may not even apply this
year. This even applies to market segments. Once upon a time, there were
genres and these genres were almost sacred. If you book didn't fit a
genre, it couldn't be displayed in your local chain bookstore. Your book
was a &quot;nothing&quot; and you were a nobody, because customers could
not find you and the NY Times couldn't review you.

Times have changed, although the basics remain constant. Your book
needs an audience with money enough to buy it and you need to know that
audience well enough to deliver something that will capture its
interest.

Getting your book in front of customers

This is where the self-publisher can make a lot of false starts. When
your book first comes out, a wide circle of friends and acquaintances
will know about your book because of your blog. (Self-publishers without
a blog need supernatural abilities. The rest of us will blog and
self-publish.)

These friends and their friends will buy your book and you will see
an encouraging flow of orders come in. After a short while the flow
stops, not because your book is no good, but because you have used up
your local and friendly audience.

This is the point that you re-open Dan Poynter's book and John
Kremer's books and start reading in earnest about promoting your book.
Hopefully, you will have the bright idea that in order to sell your
book, you must get the book in front of customers.

You will probably smack yourself on the forehead at this point,
because you will have realized that your customers rarely buy books from
bookstores! Your target customers may buy their reading material at car
washes or riding stables or cycle shops.

Maybe your customers, like mine, rarely leave their cubicles during
daylight hours. How do you reach them? By advertising on websites they
frequent during working hours! There is skill involved in choosing the
right website, because your book and the website must be compatible.
Otherwise the positioning is wrong and your book looks out of place.

BlogAds are a marvelous invention. You can rent space on a busy
weblog for a few dollars a day and if you choose wisely, you will see
immediate results. This graph shows the response to placing blogads on
two new sites. This is traffic on my Bent Crow Press site and the sales
curve shows a similar uptrend.

What you cannot see is that most of the traffic is being generated by
the less expensive site with lower traffic. When I get this advertising
campaign properly tuned, I expect to see even more startling results.
These blogads appear on sites that have hundreds of thousands of
visitors a month. I need to attract only an infinitesimal percent of
those visitors and I will be in danger of changing my lifestyle. :)

I am running long here, so I will discuss the vital issue of
performing customer surveys in a blogging environment in the next few
posts.

Good advice! I imagine this is applicable not only to writers, but
also to anyone wanting or needing to self promote (translation: everyone
in this modern age) I myself am just beginning to explore the idea of
blogging to promote my films. I see many parallels between the journey
which you are in the middle of, and the one which I have just started.
:) I will be reading your self-publishing tips with much interest

I have new topic for you. Many candidates go through tests in tech
companies. Testing varies from pshcho tests to riddles and C questions.
Tests are sometimes with closed books though life is with "open books"
and under stressing conditions. Tests are some times a way to let the
candidate solve a problem for the interviewer. So, David, here is a
topic for you to write about. "Quicksand Tests"

Thanks for the suggestion. I will pick it up in a future post. The
tests often tell you more about the company than they realize.
