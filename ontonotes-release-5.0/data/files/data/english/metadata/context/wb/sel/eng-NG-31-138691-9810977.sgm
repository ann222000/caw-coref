PPP's Democratic Credentials

Anwar Ul Haque

Demise of every human being is sad. It creates a sense of deprivation and
warm feelings among the relatives, friends and those who like the person.
Even those who don't like the person and his/her philosophy and work feel
sad because of their caring of those who feel deprived and who are sad. This
is humanity. This is human and humane part of it. There is another reason
for sadness too; the fact that the chapter of the person is closed and
he/she can not write anymore in that book and therefore his/her chance of
doing good work and earning good credential for that eternal life whose food
will never spoil and whose shadows will never wean away, is lost forever. In
that respect we are very very sad indeed.

However when we deal with political parties and movements we have to go
beyond that see what a political movement is all about and what it has for
the future of the country and the people. Let us look at the credentials of
PPP.

1.      It is a fact that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto served a military dictator i.e.
Ayob Khan. He was his foreign minister. He wrote letters to him equating him
with Qauid-e-Azam etc.

2.      He did not accept the people's verdict which ultimately resulted in
separation of East Pakistan and he raised the slogan of &quot;New Pakistan&quot;.
Although military rulers and bureaucrats played their role but PPP can't be
let off the hook on that account

3.      As we know very clearly that foreign forces and Qadynis played key
role in that sad event, it means also that PPP played in their hands like it
is doing today. Mr. Rehman Milk (Main Security person of PPP) is a diehard
Qadyani and his wife is an abortionist. If Benazir is killed by Zionists
then his role can't be ignored.

4.      When CIA toppled Mian Nawaz Sharif, many CIA agents like Mushahid,
Syed Mehdi etc. played key role but the fact is that PPP was well aware of
his toppling. All the main leadership of PPP remained in London and Paris
for about 4 months during that time along with their spouses. Even the drama
of Nadir Perwaiz which was used to create an excuse between Nawaz Sharif and
Pervaiz Musharraf was a fabricated one which Mr. Nawaz Sharif could not
understand.

5.      BB came to Pakistan as a part of deal. Her huge corruption including
91 billion rupees and Surrey places were all forgiven and all forgotten As
PPP had been involved in massive corruption, it does not like Independent
Judiciary and restoration of judges. Mr. Asif Zardari is very much there to
use his son as a siphon to suck the blood of poor as he did in the past he
used his wife.

6.      USA is anxious to bring PPP in power so that its terrorism action
can be facilitated on the shoulder of 'popular&quot; leaders. Popular leaders can
do more for USA Government (Zionists slaves) than unpopular leaders. Nawaz
Sharif after not taking dictation of Mr. Clinton on Nuclear blast and by
introducing Islamic teachings in text books etc is not trusted by USA. In
order to reduce Nawaz Sharif's popularity Kargil was created. It was indeed
unfortunate that Mr. Sharif didn't clarify his position and his popularity
suddenly sunk and its toppling became easy and &quot;justified&quot; in the eyes of
many people because of his perceived role in Kargil. Had he clarified his
position before it's too late, it would not have been easy to topple him.
Mr. Mushahid Hussain played double role i.e. creating Nadir Pervaiz drama as
well as suppressing clarification (He was information minister) on behalf of
Nawaz Sharif PPP was fully aware of CIA plan and in order to save themselves
from any probable action by military Benazir called party meeting in London
and Paris to protect its top leadership which stayed there for about 4
months.

7.      Mr. Asif Ali Zardari had spent his so called jail in posh hospital
rooms of PIMS and specially built posh suite in Civil Hospital Karachi.  He
was involved in numerous actions of corruption including robbing charity
money for Children Hospital in Sind by using Time Bomb from his close
relative. He has killed Zafar Rajput in Nawab Shah and his associates over a
land dispute by deceiving them. He called them for mutual agreement. While
those were sitting under tree, his gunmen hidden on the tree above fired and
shot them all dead. Seeing nowhere to go relatives of Zafar Rajput joined
MQM (another equally terrorist and racist party)

8.      PPP is not supporting independent judiciary and hence it is not even
trying to get Mr. Aitazaz Ahsan released from jail. It is quite possible
that PPP is instrumental in keeping him I jail, like it was in the arrest of
Javed Hashmi after he became the President of ARD which PPP swallowed by did
not like at all. Makhdoom Ameen Fahim is son of Talibul Mauwla was another
Pharaoh who was a &quot;peer&quot; making common people slave. They can't show their
backs to the peer Sahib and can't wear shoes in his presence. There was an
alleged  murder of Deena Lailah by his sons. It is interesting to see that
these pseudo gods are trying to serve people. It is like Aga Khan serving
his people after robbing them and making them slave. In fact Mr. Aitazaz
Ahsan deserved to be the new chairman of PPP because of his record for
independent judiciary and democracy. But how he is thrown out. If there is
no respect for merit and if all people do not have equal chance forget
democracy. It is high time that PML (N) declare its open policy for new
leadership based on merit and democratic norms in consideration with
competence, contribution, ethical values etc. As USA does not like Aitazaz
Ahsan due to his support for independent judiciary, he will not be offered
chairmanship of PPP. Aitazaz is other fault is that he was born in Maree,
Punjab. A party claiming to represent federation becomes so narrow minded
that it accepts leadership on from Sind and from Sind, only from rural area
and from this too only from Bhutto family. Zardari however tricked them here
too. Through a fraudulent will, he was able to snatch the leadership using
his son.

It is responsibility of media to not to mutilate truth. But Media people are
among the most corrupt and among the most biased people and they serve the
special interest groups. A manipulated and concocted democracy where 3 %
minority rules the majority (USA, under Zionists' rule and India under
Brahmin rule and the rest of the world in the same way under direct or
indirect Zionist control) is not the solution. Islam alone is the answer to
protect poor, women and oppressed people. It also helps the rich by not
letting them to abuse their power and money for injustice but direct their
power and money for the uplift of the poor and the society. Many companions
of the Prophet (PBUH) bought and released free hundreds of slaves. It is
like giving away expensive Mercedes cars free. Not only that slaves after
getting free enjoyed same social rights, status and honor as free men.
Muslims are supposed to the Role Model for the society. Instead many of them
have become just a model and at times the models those whom Allah made swine
and monkeys and made them to worship lowly cow for their misdeeds, cunning
and oppression. It is high time Muslims hold Quran-e-Majid firmly in their
hands (learn Quran, teach others and develop utmost love for it through
frequent reading, memorizing and acting upon its teaching. The Prophet
(PBUH) is the role model (Shaheed) for us and we are for the rest of the
world. Let us take the Quran in our hands and hearts and lead the world out
of utter darkness to the light.

Zionists planned to &quot;disintegrate Pakistan&quot;; Henry Kissinger 1974: US left
Pakistan defenceless after India's first nuclear test; Bhutto sacrificed by
New Feudal World Order

*BHUTTO SACRIFICED AT THE MOMENT WHEN DEAL WAS CUT BETWEEN U.S.MILITARY &amp;
MUSHARRAF*

It seems clear now that Bhutto was sent by US/UK/Israel New Feudal World
Order Elites back to Pakistan to be sacrificed as a new &quot;911&quot; pretext for
disintegrating Pakistan. There must have been Indian Intelligence
involvement as RAW has been given a free hand in Afghanistan to train
Al-Qaida terrorists for bombing and assassination missions inside Pakistan.
India has opened at least 7 so-called &quot;consulates&quot; along the Afghan/Pakistan
border.

In his book *If I am Assassinated*, written from his prison cell, Zulfikar
Ali *Bhutto* revealed how the New Feudal World Order Zionist leader Henry *
Kissinger* &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger &gt; had said to him in
1976: &quot;We will make an example of you.&quot; *Kissinger* had warned Zulfikar Ali
*Bhutto* that if Pakistan continued with its nuclear program the Prime
Minister would have to pay a heavy price, a statement some take to indicate
a Kissinger hand in Mr. *Bhutto's* trial and execution.

WASHINGTON, Dec 25: The United States would also have built a nuclear bomb
if it were in Pakistan's position after India's first nuclear test in 1974,
according to former US Secretary of State Henry *Kissinger*.

Mr *Kissinger* made these remarks while chairing a State Department meeting
on July 9, 1976 to discuss former prime minister Zulfikar Ali *Bhutto*'s
efforts to buy a nuclear reprocessing plant from France. The details of this
meeting were released recently along with other secret documents from that
period.

&quot;What he wants is to build a bomb,&quot; the-then under secretary of state Philip
Habib tells the meeting while talking about Mr *Bhutto*'s intentions for
acquiring a reprocessing plant.

&quot;If you were in his place you would do the same thing,&quot; Mr
*Kissinger*responded. &quot;I must say I have some sympathy for
*Bhutto* in this,&quot; he added.

&quot;We are doing nothing to help him on conventional arms; we are going ahead
and selling nuclear fuel to India even after they exploded a bomb and then
for this little project we are coming down on him like a tonne of bricks.&quot;

According to the documents, the meeting also discussed a joint proposal by
the former Shah of Iran and Mr *Bhutto* to build a multinational nuclear
reactor in Pakistan to be run jointly by the two countries. The proposal,
however, was never implemented as Americans felt that this would enable both
Iran and Pakistan to acquire nuclear technology.

&quot;Gentlemen, there are few countries in the world which by necessity or
choice are still allies of ours. There is something indecent about our
always proving that we are strong by kicking our allies in the teeth,&quot; he
observed.

&quot;The Pakistanis don't even have the appearance of a credible defence. What
they have asked for from us is piddling compared to what the Indians have. I
don't think it adds to the stature of the United States to force an ally to
be defenceless.&quot;

Mr *Kissinger* then explained how he planned to convince Mr *Bhutto* to give
up his nuclear plan.

&quot;First, the only way we are going to get him off this reprocessing plant is
to give him a reactor … Secondly, we should tell him that we will take steps
to enhance his conventional defence. We can't tell *Bhutto* that he can't
have either a conventional or a nuclear defence. Non-proliferation is not
our only objective in South Asia.&quot;

Commenting on the balance of power between India and Pakistan, Mr *Kissinger
* observed: &quot;An imbalance is being created in which Pakistan is totally
dependent on India. There is no question that we can break Pakistan's back
because they have made the mistake of allying themselves with us.&quot;

*In Response To: :) THE USUAL FUN WITH OBL! A COLLECTION PLUS A
*VIDEO*&lt; http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=109349 &gt;(FarSight3)
** *

Jesterday the &quot;plan-B&quot; was put aside. Pakistan's opposition leader, Benazir
Bhutto &lt; http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=115857 &gt;, was
assassinated with two shots in her neck and head. That powerful bomb blast
that killed about twenty Pakistani nationals was ignited shortly afterwards
some twenty meters from the vehicle that Bhutto was in when she was shot at
close range at Rawalpindi near Islamabad...

According to some interview with Bhutto from
November&lt; http://www.parade.com/benazir_bhutto_interview.html &gt;one can
conclude that certain circles inside the
U.S.admin had their plans with Bhutto: Either she was used as a &quot;Plan-B&quot; (if
Musharraf wouldn't act as desired) or else.

Finally we have arrived at this &quot;else&quot; now - as you can read from this WP
piece&lt; http://blog.washingtonpost.com/earlywarning/2007/12/musharrafs_woes_h... &gt;where
you can read that finally
*a deal was cut to make it officially possible that U.S. troops may &quot;return&quot;
into Pakistan:*

*...Beginning early next year, U.S. Special Forces are expected to vastly
expand their presence in Pakistan, as part of an effort to train and support
indigenous counter-insurgency forces and clandestine counterterrorism units,
according to defense officials involved with the planning...*

Now, as this new agreement has been finalized, the first U.S. personnel
could be on the ground in Pakistan by early 2008, according to Pentagon
sources.

Bhutto wasn't necessary anymore, moreover she seems to have spoken too
openly about certain &quot;secrets that everyone knows&quot;: She was *the next to
confirm that Osama Bin Laden is dead already*, as you can hear in this video
at about 6 Minutes, 12 Seconds.

*Bhutto: &quot;OBL was killed by Sheik Omar&quot;*

On the other hand it is interesting to watch what Benazir's return might
have meant for pakistan. Her legacy as a two-time prime minister is a legacy
of gross corruption. She is estimated to have stolen $1.5 to $3
billion&lt; http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/blog/2007/12/pakistan_the_ot.html &gt;from
the Pakistani treasury....

&quot;Mossad Snubbed Bhutto's Protection Request&quot;, on 28th December 2007 an
Israeli website: www.israelinationalnews.com , reported that &quot;Slain Pakistani
opposition leader Benazir Bhutto &quot;desperately&quot; asked the CIA, Scotland Yard,
and Israel's Mossad to assist in her personal protection in the weeks before
her assassination, Maariv reported Friday. Bhutto said that President Pervez
Musharaf's men would not let her protect herself adequately: she was not
allowed to use dark-paned windows in her motorcade or use equipment for
location of roadside explosives. She suspected Musharraf wanted to make her
an easy target for assassins.

When a news organization as venerable as the BBC censors the reportage of a
story as important as the assassination of Benzir Bhutto --a highly visible
critic of Bush/British policy with regard to the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; et al
--it is fair to ask: who is the BBC protecting? Are they covering up the
motive for her murder? Are they protecting the regimes that engineered her
assassination?

This was Pakistan's 9/11; Pakistan's JFK assassination, and its impact will
resonate for years.

Contrary to mainstream corporate news reporting, chaos benefits
Bush-Cheney's &quot;war on terrorism&quot;. Calls for &quot;increased worldwide security&quot;
will pave the way for a muscular US reaction, US-led force and other forms
of &quot;crack down&quot; from Bush-Cheney across the region. In other words, the
assassination helps ensure that the US will not only never leave, but also
increase its presence.

Whenever turmoil is created in our world, such as assassination and bombing,
and the neocons rush to point the finger of blame at 'al Qaeda' or some
other associated 'terror' organisation, one can be reasonably sure that what
the world has witnessed is yet another false flag operation perpetrated by a
group or groups that have some ulterior, political, or even pecuniary motive
or motives for creating such turmoil. And such is the case with the
assassination yesterday of Pakistani politician Benazir Bhutto. This is
again a false flag operation like 9/11 for the benefit of the Neocons.

She was also the figure President Pervez Musharraf most feared as a rival,
as expressed to me by the beleaguered leader's close confidant, Humayun
Gauhar: &quot;If the Americans can have a government led by Bhutto, they will get
what Musharraf has refused them. She will allow NATO boots on the ground in
our tribal areas and a chance to neuter our nuclear weapons,&quot; said Gauhar.
This is exactly why the American government was eager to see Bhutto gain or
share power with Musharraf.

In the wake of the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, a 'surge' of US Special
Forces for Pakistan's remote tribal lands is unlikely to face heavy
opposition from President Musharraf, who will be busy trying to stop his own
name, and that of his political party, from being linked with Bhutto's
assassins.

Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said Sunday she would use economic as
well as military means to defuse Pakistan's pro-Taliban insurgency, warning
&quot;foreign forces&quot; could invade unless the government curbs spreading
militancy.

President Pervez Musharraf has told a visiting top US diplomat that
emergency rule can only be lifted once the law and order situation in
Pakistan improves, a presidential aide said Saturday.

If there is a moderate element that might actually win elections or heavily
influence political events, can they possibly be tolerated as the Musharraf
camp faces declining fortunes? If the moderate sector is silenced, it could
encourage the rest of Pakistan to focus on the perceived options left to
them, the Islamic extremists or the military dictator. That leaves the
Musharraf camp as the ready-made savior without an alternative, doesn't it?
How well, after all, would the moderates do keeping up the fake War on
Terror anyway?

The former Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto has issued her most
defiant statement yet since the imposition of emergency rule, as her
supporters were attacked by riot police firing tear gas in the heart of the
capital yesterday.

Former premier Benazir Bhutto Wednesday urged Pakistanis to hold mass
protests against a state of emergency declared by President Pervez
Musharraf, setting up a showdown with the military ruler.

Bhutto vowed to hold a rally in the garrison town of Rawalpindi on Friday
despite police threats of a crackdown, and called for a &quot;long march&quot; on
November 13 from Lahore to the capital if Musharraf does not back down.
