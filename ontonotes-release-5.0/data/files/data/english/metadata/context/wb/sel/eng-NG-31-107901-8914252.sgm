No, it's from private insurance. The Kroobitch supports him and she gets

The Middiot is externalizing and contradicting himself. He accuses me of
being a computer repairman for a living, and the next thing you know, he
accuses me of living on a disability.   The later is foolishment, pure and

That's not the impression I got Arny. I thought he was casting doubt on the
existence of your computer business whilst claiming that your income was
from a private company's disability payments to your wife. But whether it's

You really do have the same Paranoid Personality Disorder that Phil has
Arny.
I was referring to your personal life when I said it was none of my
business, but true to form, you wrongly assumed that I was referring to the
truth of the accusations.

You seem to see personal attacks in every remark anyone makes about you, &amp;
take
umbrage at comments like the one I made, which was entirely without malice.
Unfortunately, with an attitude like yours Arny, it's likely to be a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

Once again Arny, you've got the bull by the horns. I was merely pointing out
that Middius' comment was to the effect that you DIDN'T have a computer
business, at least that was how I read it, and therefore needed to rely on a
disability pension. But I qualified my remark by saying that as it involved
your private life, it was none of my business.
That's it.
But you, as is your want, took it as yet another personal attack (which it
most definitely wasn't) &amp; sounded off accordingly. Try not to see everyone
as your enemy Arny. I know this might sound a little trite, but not everyone
is, you know.
Cheerio,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Arnii, you and your apologists throw out the &quot;liar&quot; accusation so often
that it's meaningless. However, I'm pleased to clear up the fog of
confusion on behalf of the human race.

You, Arnii Krooger, have claimed to be a &quot;professional recordist&quot; or
some such. Clearly a lie.

You, Arnii Krooger, have claimed to be an &quot;electrical engineer&quot; when you
have never been employed in that role. Clearly a lie.

You, Arnii Krooger, have claimed to be a &quot;christian&quot;. Clearly a lie.

You, Arnii Krooger, have claimed several times to be the victims of
conspiracies on Usenet that are intended to undermine your &quot;business&quot;.
Well, those may not be lies, actually, since you're insane enough to
believe them. Never mind that one.

Anyway, I'm proud to take my place among the vast army of Usenet &quot;liars&quot;
you've identified. In this company are such leading audio figures as
John Atkinson, Glenn Zelniker, Paul Bamborough, and Jim Johnston.
According to you, they're &quot;liars&quot; all. Not to mention the thousands and
thousands of ordinary Normals you've called &quot;liars&quot;. I think that
includes everybody you've ever argued with on Usenet, which means ...
everybody on Usenet.

Arnii Krooger, Liar Detective, has solve another case! ;-)

OK Arny, you win. You have no sense of humour, an ego big enough to start a
tsunami, and a bad case of Paranoid Personality Disorder to boot.

You'll ALWAYS have the last say, whether you're right or wrong, just like
your mate Phil Allison, so there's absolutely no point in even trying to
rationally discuss anything with you, ever.

Don't bother having the last say this time, as I'm about to killfile you,
