Oh gawd, Bill. See if you can take this down somehow. Some loudmouth
on the radio has allowed you to make a complete ditto-headed fool of
yourself with this one.

The vote *for* the Gulf of Tonkin resolution in the Senate was 88-2.
(Both dissenting senators were Democrats, by the way- Wayne Morse from
Oregon and Ernest Gruenig from Alaska).

Every single Republican and all but two Democrats in the Senate that
voted at all on the resolution at all voted *for* it. Despite what
your radio indoctrinator insists, party has *nothing* to do with
this.
If you believe the Democratic majority overwhelmed the valiantly
resisting Republican minority to shove this resolution through, you
have been horribly (and perhaps quite deliberately) misinformed. If
you don't believe that, why the hell would you post this obvious OT
troll?

History and civics lesson for you, Shortwave.

The President of the United States does not vote on Senate
resolutions.

Nobody in the House of Representatives votes on Senate resolutions.

Hubert Humphrey was Vice President, not the Senate Democratic Whip.
Humphrey would only have voted if there had been a tie, not a
virtually unanimous resolution for war by both the Democrats and the
Republicans. Humphrey would not have voted on the Gulf of Tonkin
resolution.

To blame the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on one party or the other is
entirely absurd. Fact is, the vote was 88-2. Fact is, more Democratic
Senators voted for the resolution than did Republican senators- simply
because there were a greater number of Democrats in the Senate at that
time. Fact is, not a single Republican opposed the resolution with a
&quot;nay&quot; vote. Not one. Only two Democrats opposed the resolution.
Plenty of blame to go all the way around on that one. Neither party
looks worse than the other, everything considered.

Your post addressed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution specifically and
implied that it was passed along partisan lines. Let's not wander off
from that claim.

88-2, Bill. 88-2. And the two were Democrats. Unless you can make a
case that there were only 10 Republican senators in 1964 and that they
all abstained in protest, the simple fact is that every single
Republican senator who voted on the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution voted
&quot;aye&quot;. It was truly a bi-partisan debacle.

Shall we all list the dead friends, disrupted lives, and screwed up
veterans that resulted from that war? It was a horrible era in our
history, and, up until that time at least, likely the worst foreign
policy and strategic blunder in American history. You guys dishonor
the people who died for this national mistake by trying to blame it,
40 years later, on one political party or the other.

The nightmare was actually set in motion in October of 1954;

http://vietnam.vassar.edu/doc5.html

but you won't catch me concentrating on the political affiliation of
the individual who thought he was acting in good conscience and in the
best interest of the nation at that time- all that does is dishonor
the people who died for this terrible national mistake.

Hindsight is 20/20.  Demonizing the other political party ultimately
leads to civil war, working through differences to arrive at generally
acceptable solutions to common problems leads to a stronger and more
prosperous nation.

It was LBJ who put us in deep doo doo overthere.  Micromanage the war, and
got us a hell of a lot deeper in to it than Kennedy was going to.  As to
1954, was actually Truman Presidency that allowed the French back in and
supported them with munitions and arms.  I am not dishonering those who
served.  I was one, did not go overseas, but worked on the planes that flew
them over while stationed at Travis AFB.  Was a Democrat escalated war, with
the Republicans helping.  But where is the blame on Hillary, et. al. that
voted for Iraq?  We are F%&amp;ked by both major parties.

Well, lets examine the makeup of the 88th Congress shall we?

Senate - 69 Democrats to 31 Republicans - a clear majority.
House - 301 Democrats - a clear majority.

President of the  United stated - Lyndon B. Johnson, Democrat

Let's get the standard historical definition of the Gulf of Tonkin
Resolution - I'll be right back.

Ah, here we are:

&quot;The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was a joint resolution of the U.S.
Congress passed in August 1964 in direct response to a minor naval
engagement known as the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. It is of historical
significance because it gave U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson
authorization, without a formal declaration of war by Congress, for
the use of military force in Southeast Asia. The Johnson
administration subsequently cited the resolution as legal authority
for its rapid escalation of U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam
conflict.&quot;

Now notice some key features:

1 - An &quot;incident&quot; of dubious provenance involving one of our ships in
&quot;international&quot; waters - basically LBJ, a Democrat, lied.

2 - LBJ, a Democrat, was given permission to adopt a military course
of action without a formal declaration of war by Congress the makeup
of which was overwhelmingly Democrat.

3 - LBJ, a Democrat, uses that authority to initiate military action
against a sovereign nation.

4 - The 88th Congress was majority locked Democrat in both the House
and Senate.

So, let's review.

LBJ, a Democrat, conjuring up a dubious incident, asked for and
received a resolution from a Democrat controlled Congress which he
received and which subsequently was used as a basis for the Vietnam
&quot;Conflict&quot;.

Was it bi-partisian?  Yes.  Would it have passed anyway - you know,
partisian politics, party line votes, stuff like that - of course it
would have.

So, in effect, Vietnam was the Democrats fault.

I, of course, being the sensible and moderate type don't blame anyone.
War is war.  It's going to happen as it's part of the human condition.
Two tours - there were good times, there were bad times and there were
horrible times.

And to be perfectly honest, if I had to do it all over again...

I would.

Thanks to all who served/serve for me and my family.

Anyway, it was interesting out at the stables last week. The owners
have a friend who's son is going to serve in Afghanistan and wanted to
come out and ride a horse for the first time as this would be part of
his task in his specialized unit aparrently. My confusion was that he
was going to be trained from scratch to ride, I would have thought
they would use experienced riders. But maybe those who can already
ride, and make his unit too, are fewer than I would think. I did not
get to talk to him personally and I don't know what kind of unit he is
in, but I did get the idea it was some sort of special forces, not
just general military.

When they were first sent to Afghanistan 6 weeks after 9/11, the CIA &amp;
special forces got around on horses during some of their travels in rugged
areas. The fact that your friend is being trained for that may be a good
sign. Perhaps soldiers are being prepared to finally go after AQ in the
correct country.

Reggie,

That's not the point.  The absolute arrogance of such a statement is
what prompts responses like mine.  Chuck's statement of &quot;fact&quot; is not
how it happened and if he believes it does, then Chuck's claim to be a
historian and civics teacher needs to be challanged.

The Gulf of Tonkin was a JOINT resolution - meaning that BOTH Houses
of Congress passed it - not just the Senate.

If somebody needs a civics and history lesson, it's Chuck, not me.

The resolution, H.J. RES 1145, stated that “Congress approves and
supports the determination of the President, as Commander in Chief, to
take all necessary measures to repeal any armed attack against the
forces of the United States and to prevent any further aggression.”

That's Congress - not the Senate and not the House.

To put paid to this nonsense, it was a different time, a different
place - a lot of Congress were WWII/Korean War vets only twenty and
ten years away from the end of those wars.  There was the &quot;communist
menace&quot;, the space race, society was more &quot;us against them&quot;.

The simple truth is this - if every Republican Senator or
Representative voted no, it still would have passed because of the
preponderance of Democrats in both Houses.  It was bi-partisian in
nature, but it wouldn't have made any difference.

That's the correct history and that's the correct civics.

Then don't cite the President of the United States as a party voting
on a Senate Resolution, and don't forget that Hubert Humphrey was VP
during the Johnson administration. There's no need to call names
simply because I noted the obvious flaws in your argument.

My point is limited to the simple and factual observation that the
Gulf of Tonkin Resolution passed 88-2. The original implication in
this thread was that the Resolution passed along party lines back in
1964. That implication is false. No amount of obfuscation or expanding
the question to partisan responsibility for orchestrating the war in
general
will make the statement &quot;The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed by
the 'party of peace'&quot; correct. 88-2 is a bi-partisan vote by any
standard.

Had the vote been 60-40 or something similar, a case could be made
that it was an issue jammed through by the majority despite the
protests of the minority. The vote was 88-2.

This isn't even politics, Reggie. Events that occured in 1964 are
historical, not political. In politics, there's not really any
objective way to measure accuracy and all politics is primarily a
matter of opinion.
Whether or not a particular senate resolution passed along party lines
isn't a political question, it's a matter of historic record. I'd like
to believe that people would be above distorting historical facts in
order to
make a contemporary political statement- but I'm sure it's commonly
done on both sides of any question.

Tom is correct and I was incorrect regarding the status of the
resolution.
It *was* a joint resolution, not simply a Senate resolution. I was
correct and Tom was incorrect regarding the office held by Hubert
Humphrey in August of 1964.

The total vote in both chambers was something like 500 to 2. The two
dissenters were from the same party, which also happened to be the
majority party at that time. *No* member of the minority party voted
against the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, making any claim that it was an
exercise of partisan power appear extremely weak.

&gt; &gt; what prompts responses like mine.  Chuck's statement of &quot;fact&quot; is not
&gt; &gt; how it happened and if he believes it does, then Chuck's claim to be a
&gt; &gt; historian and civics teacher needs to be challanged.

&gt; &gt; The Gulf of Tonkin was a JOINT resolution - meaning that BOTH Houses
&gt; &gt; of Congress passed it - not just the Senate.

&gt; &gt; If somebody needs a civics and history lesson, it's Chuck, not me.

&gt; &gt; The resolution, H.J. RES 1145, stated that &quot;Congress approves and
&gt; &gt; supports the determination of the President, as Commander in Chief, to
&gt; &gt; take all necessary measures to repeal any armed attack against the
&gt; &gt; forces of the United States and to prevent any further aggression.&quot;

&gt; &gt; That's Congress - not the Senate and not the House.

&gt; &gt; To put paid to this nonsense, it was a different time, a different
&gt; &gt; place - a lot of Congress were WWII/Korean War vets only twenty and
&gt; &gt; ten years away from the end of those wars.  There was the &quot;communist
&gt; &gt; menace&quot;, the space race, society was more &quot;us against them&quot;.

&gt; &gt; The simple truth is this - if every Republican Senator or

&gt; &gt; preponderance of Democrats in both Houses.  It was bi-partisian in

What really gets me is how you can dismiss the idea that one party
supported the other party, which could have been for many reasons. I
suppose if you are a senator or congressperson and see that a
resolution is going to pass overwhelmingly, with the support of the
people, you could support it out of resepect or to get to the next
arena, or whatever. It does not always mean, they themselves support
the resolution. Look at the minority party in the runup to the Iraq
war.

Exactly. And it is equally disingenuous for the party that was in the
minority at the time of the Iraq authorization to put all the blame on
the party that was in the majority at that time.

In both cases the administration capaitalized on popular fears to drum
up a justification for war. In one case, it was fear of communism and
the argument was that if we didn't fight them in Viet Nam we'd have to
fight them in the Phillipines, Australia, or Hawaii. Pobably seemed
like a reasonable proposition to an adult population with vivid
memories of Japanese Imperialist tendencies  in the Pacific.  I'll
refrain from commenting on the second case.

Let he or she whose political party has clean skirts in the run-ups to
any of the wars in the last 50 years or so throw the first stone.
There ought not be any rocks in the air.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No way you're smart enough to remember that on your own. Who told you to

&gt;&gt;&gt; Confess. Do it now.

&gt;&gt;I remember the resolution.  Also remember my draft notice end of 1964.

&gt; Then don't cite the President of the United States as a party voting

&gt; simply because I noted the obvious flaws in your argument.

&gt; My point is limited to the simple and factual observation that the
&gt; Gulf of Tonkin Resolution passed 88-2. The original implication in
&gt; this thread was that the Resolution passed along party lines back in
&gt; 1964. That implication is false. No amount of obfuscation or expanding
&gt; the question to partisan responsibility for orchestrating the war in
&gt; general
&gt; will make the statement &quot;The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed by
&gt; the 'party of peace'&quot; correct. 88-2 is a bi-partisan vote by any
&gt; standard.

&gt; Had the vote been 60-40 or something similar, a case could be made
&gt; that it was an issue jammed through by the majority despite the
&gt; protests of the minority. The vote was 88-2.
">

It was passed my a majority Dem controlled Congress and signed by a Dem
POTUS.  And how many other bills were tied to votes on the resolution?  As
to not knowing about the war, I was stationed at a base where the KIA's were
returned to.  Fairfield, the town just outside the gates, had 5000 residents
in those years and 12 mortuaries.  I did not have to unload bodies, but a
couple from the first unit I was in did, after they disbanded the mobile
comm squadron I was part of.  I just worked on other electronics.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 8/7/1964 Congress aproves the Gult of Tonkin Resolution.  the party of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; peace.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No way you're smart enough to remember that on your own. Who told you to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; say it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Confess. Do it now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I remember the resolution.  Also remember my draft notice end of 1964.
&gt;&gt;&gt;But
&gt;&gt;&gt;I saw the date on another media.

&gt;&gt; Damn, you must be an old man. I didn't get mine until June of '65.

&gt;Turned 22 in Basic Training at Lackland AFB in early 1964.  I am more
&gt;mature.

Very much so. I was 21 when drafted and didn't turn 22 until with the 196th
Bde in Ft. Devins, Mass.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's really interesting, Bilious.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Being political and that you said you were over there.  Figured you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like what?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Listen, drunkboy, we now have an absolute idiot for a president who lied
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; us into a war and is delusional about it. There's no need to regurgitate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vietnam with idiot-boy Bush in the White House.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Are you still stoned?  I rarely drink, but you seem to be constantly
&gt;&gt;&gt;stoned
&gt;&gt;&gt;or terminally stupid.  We need to reference VN at times.  We got into an
&gt;&gt;&gt;shitty conflict and then did not let the military do the required job.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Same
&gt;&gt;&gt;as Iraq.  We were lied to in 1964, probably less lies in the latest
&gt;&gt;&gt;conflict, as even the former POTUS stated there were WMD's.  And we seem
&gt;&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;be restricting the military in this conflict also.

&gt;&gt; Sounds like a super topic for a.politics. Why start it here?
