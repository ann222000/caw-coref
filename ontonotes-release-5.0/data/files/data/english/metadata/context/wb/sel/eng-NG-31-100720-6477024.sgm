Blog Against Theocracy

"There is nothing," wrote Victor Hugo, "more powerful than and idea
whose time has come." And as we have seen, bloggers can generate ideas
and activities to back them that are powerful indeed. This morning,
Blue Gal, a blogger from 'Bama announced an idea that I think is
powerful indeed. She proposed organizing a blogswarm against theocracy
on Easter weekend April 6-8, 2007.

As someone who has been writing about theocratic politics for many
years, I can say that no one has ever done anything remotely like this
and that I think its long overdue for the blogopshere to flex its
muscles more knowledgeably, articulately and collectively in response
to the theocratic politics of our time.

Blue Gal proposes to draw on the themes and resources of First Freedom
First, a joint project sponsored by Americans United for Separation of
Church and State and the Interfaith Alliance, and is endorsed by a
number of other religious, humanist and atheist organizations.

That sounds good to me.

But she is quick to point out that this is an effort entirely
independent of these fine organzations, and is strictly a blogger
initiative. That said, Blue Gal writes:

The post will be against theocracy, in favor of our Constitutional
guarantee of separation of church and state. But there are a LOT of
issues tied to this, as is pointed out in the First Freedom First website:

No religious discrimination.

PRO End-of-Life Care (no more Terri Schiavo travesties)

Reproductive health decisions made by individuals, not
religious "majorities"

Democracy not Theocracy

Academic Integrity (like, a rock is as old as it is, not as
old as the Bible says)

Sound Science (good bye so-called "intelligent" design)

Respect for ALL families (based on love, not sexual
orientation. Hellooooo.)

And finally, The right to worship, OR NOT.

So take your pick and write your post(s). Really, the wider
variety of topics makes it all the more interesting. I can't wait to
read what Pharyngula has to say about sound science, or what some of
you will have to say about reproductive choice as it relates to
church/state separation, or how a religionist blogger feels about
their own freedom to worship and how that is compromised by state
sponsored religion. (That's my topic, fwiw.)

Blue Gal continues:

I really hope this blogswarm does more than just let the world
know how we feel about the separation of Church and State. I hope it
improves and awakens how we feel about each other. I may be a
"believer" whatever the hell that means, but I can't have too many
smart, funny, and fascinating, atheists, scientists, agnostics, GLBT
bloggers, etc. etc. around here. Who the fuck did JESUS hang out with,
anyway? I don't think if he were here today, Jesus would have a beer
with some hypocritical preacherman, even if the preacherman was
buying. MY God is Love, and Mind, and Truth. And this blogswarm is all
about those. Thanks for participating.

I like the way Blue Gal thinks about these things -- and I think she
has hit on an approach we can all get behind.

I first heard about it from my friend and Talk to Action colleague,
Mainstream Baptist (aka Rev. Dr. Bruce Prescott) who wrote:

Some might find it surprising for a Baptist minister to encourage
a blogswarm against theocracy on Easter weekend, but I think it is a
valid expression of an authentic faith.

For Jesus the Kingdom of God is "not of this world." Theocrats are
distorting the teachings of Jesus to promote their own fantasies for a
temporal utopia.

I intend to write a blog against theocracy on Easter Sunday. What
better day than Resurrection Sunday than to hope and pray that the
spirit of democracy will revive in the evangelical churches of America.

Well how about that America! A prominent Baptist will blog about the
dangers of theocracy on Easter Sunday.

I don't know about you, but I love it.

That philosophy 'snipit' helped to get me, and my crew, through a good
many combat missions and far too many scary, inflight, emergencies.

It has also played a significant role in helping me to expose the
plethora of radical Christian propaganda and lies that we find at
almost every media turn.
