First look at Firefox 3.0 Beta 1

I noticed that the Beta 1 for Firefox 3.0 was made available sometime
yesterday. I’ve been curious as to whether the Firefox dev team would
do a serious revamp for this release or just concentrate on bug fixes
and performance improvements.

Early indications seem to suggest that it is indeed a major revamp of
both the core and the UI, and that Firefox will be a much better
browser for it.

I’m not a big Firefox user because I find the memory management to be
very poor most of the time and the spiraling memory consumption
affects both Firefox’s performance and the overall performance of my
systems. I like Firefox but Firefox just doesn’t like me, so, while I
have it installed on most systems, I mostly use Internet Explorer 7
and Opera for day to day browsing. Every time I say this I’m faced by
a chorus of users telling me that there’s no problem with the way that
Firefox handles memory, but this isn’t what I’m seeing. When a browser
starts to edge near to consuming 500MB of RAM on a regular basis,
something is wrong. Sure, I hammer the browser and have dozens of
pages open at a time, but since both IE and Opera can handle this
load, I expect Firefox to do so too. So far, it can’t, and because of
that the icon doesn’t get clicked on that often.

Over the past few years I’ve felt that Firefox has lost its way and
moved too far away from its roots. Firefox used to be about security
and performance, but lately I’ve felt that add-ons and junking up the
interface with eye-candy has taken priority over security and core
stability.

Is Firefox 3.0 going to be better? Given what I’m seeing so far, I
think so. Why? Because it looks like Mozilla have gone back to basics
and worked on what really matters to users - security, speed and ease
of use.

Everything about Firefox 3.0 beta 1 is fast. The download package is
small which means that it comes in fast, the installation is fast, the
browser fires up fast, pages and tabs open fast, the browser shuts
down fast, and the uninstall process is fast and painless (I always
like to test the uninstall process on applications because there’s
nothing worse than having a bad house guest on your system that you
can’t get rid of). This is all good stuff.

Without a doubt the Firefox 3.0 UI has been dramatically improved.
Compare version 3 to version 2 and you instantly see the difference.
Everything is brighter, clearer, and easier to access. Things that
should be simple, such as bookmarking, saving passwords, and finding
words and phrases in the text of a web page are now simple. Page
zooming is brilliant, as is the feature that resumes interrupted
downloads.

Right now, Firefox is my browser of choice, but I do agree.
It is becoming bloated... Trying to add items to make &quot;everyone&quot; happy..
I have noticed a pretty fair slow-down of browser performance in thelast
couple of releases. 2.xxx really slowed things down..

I'm gonna try to make the switch.  I always went with IE, but now I'm
getting crazy errors with it.  Ten times a day i get a dialog box asking
whether I want to send microsoft the stack dump of when an exception
occured.

Any other prog, you would delete and re-install.  How do you do that with
IE?  Anyways, I'll give this a try.  6 megs should take about fifteen
minutes to download with my modem.  (I miss broadband but don't miss
comcast.)

I'll probably stick with mozilla/firefox for right now, at least till
I see how the next release works... I, from time to time, use Opera or
Browzar Private Web browser ( that one kinda uses parts of IE, I do
believe)I use IE very little anymore.. All depends on how a web page is
coded.. I do wish everyone would tell MS to screw themselves and use
the real Java....

I've had some issues with the bookmarks disappearing when I do
installs.  I suspect it is something I'm doing when I install a new
version of Firefox but I've not been able to discover the cause.

My plan is to back up those files and then do an install without first
uninstalling the prior version.  If that works - great.  If it does
not work I'll then do an uninstall, a new install.  If that works -
great.  If the bookmarks are still absent, I'll go to the backups.

I have looked for specific instructions for an install when a prior
version of Firebird is present but have not been successful in that
search.

BTW, I suspect I'm not alone in experiencing this problem since I've
found numerous examples for restoring the bookmarks.

...Comcast is fine if you don't expect much from customer service. But
then that is true of every other isp I've been with. I only do modem
in an emergency or when I go down to visit family in Barbados. I don't

server...webpages, ftp, nntp and bit torrent off of it. The only real
bitch I have at current is they are throttling the bit torrent with
fake packets. But all in all, I'm happy with their service.

Hmmmm, I hadn't considered this path.  I really do like having the
bookmarks in the browser.  If I have similar dificulties with the next
Firefox upgrade I definitly take a look.

In the meantime, here are some others that might worth the look.  They

Would that be:
http://alt.freeware.com/

If so, it seems to have a lot of software that is not really free.
Some of it even limits use to an hour - something I've not seen
before.  While I did find some that was free it was also adware.  Is
there something I'm missing?  Maybe I got the URL wrong.

I like http://www.download.com

While it too has software which is not free, there is a filter
function allowing me to easily view only the software that is actually
free.  No shareware and the adware is generally clearly labeled.  I
also feel comfortable that they've scanned the downloads for viruses,
trojans, etc.  Not that alt.freeware does not but I don't see anything
saying they do.
