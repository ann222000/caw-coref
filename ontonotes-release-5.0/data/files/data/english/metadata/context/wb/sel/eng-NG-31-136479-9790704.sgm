Good morning!!
Not so cold here, so no complaining.... a brisk 11*.
Jimmy... remember not to get so bogged down that WE ALL suffer
(smile)... you need to take care of you.
To all of you that are already decorated or are decorating; please
send some inspiration this way. I cannot for the life of me get in the
spirit of things and get my b*tt in gear!! The outdoor wreaths are up,
but that is where I stopped!! :(

The roads are very slick here, so I'm off a bit early. Slow moving to
class.
Chat later!!
