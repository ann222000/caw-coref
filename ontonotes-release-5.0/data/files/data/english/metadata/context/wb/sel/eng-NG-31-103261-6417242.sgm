[this post seeks to clarify an aspect about 'religion' in relation to
infrastructure...]
---

the last post attempted to convey a complex dynamic that exists in
this 'multidimensionality' of existence, in which public and private
dimensions are mediated by individuals in vastly different relations
within a shared empirical context. there is not necessarily a stable
perspective from which to assume all people can agree about what is
going on, by default. thus, to try to engage this situation, it is
necessary to start with some perspective and move through it or
around it, yet it is based on assumptions about what exists and how
it exists and how people relate to it, so as to share this viewpoint.
it is an unsuccessful approach as few agree about much of anything,
as to a shared human existence. and thus, the situation can lend
itself towards abstraction, i.e. vagueness, if not framing situations
within ideological terms. (church, state).

the purpose all along has been to seek clarification of the basic
condition, yet it seems that when writing through this condition,
oftentimes it may appear that the default is 'against religion' or
against religious interpretation, if not against the private zone, or
some lessening of value through a private framework of religion, in
certain facets of how the public-private mixture works today. it is
more complex than it has been inadequately presented -- and it should
be clarified that there was earlier mention of a public zone which is
based on grounded existence for a common humanity, via shared facts,
truth, and logic - which can then be reasoned as to the human
condition. religious dimensions often can and do exist in this
framework and can function effectively in this realm, as has
hopefully been clear in the relation between theology and the aspect
of grounded metaphysics. including issues of morality, ethics, and so
on. it is the issue of bias and distortion and warping that can
become problematic, what is not effectively 'true' as to religious
ideas as they may be believed, versus actually exist in the shared
world, that is directly engaged within this zoning. zoning thus both
enables people to believe and protects this belief, while also
mediating sharing of ideas in a public zone, which then require
certain empirical grounding so to retain an empirical foundation for
the relations of humans, of diverse beliefs, in terms of this 'one
being' (that which aligns with 'monotheism').

in any case, because things are so mixed up with the symbolism of
infrastructure and Christian religious symbolism, it is important to
make clear that acknowledging this private dimensionality in the
global order may be an important step in transforming the current
situation into one more equitable for all peoples, and in particular,
through this understanding of these public and private dynamics and
their complex relations.

the point here is that, crosses or no crosses in the global
infrastructure -- the 'truth' of the religion is that which is
carried within people themselves, and if this belief and
understanding is not held nor realized in an individual, grounded, as
it were, between their mind and body -- then this 'sea of crosses'
may have little overall effect on those who exist under its
threshold. it may not carry a significant 'charge' for those who are
not adherents to the faith or the metaphysics that are involved. i.e.
it may be ineffective, if to be evaluated in terms of cultivating
religious awareness, outside those who engage it in these dimensions
(which, interestingly, could be conscious or subconscious, as an
interaction -- yet, if this is not grounded in a person, it may not
tend towards a greater balancing or governing of the self, and
instead, towards its splitting due to the overlap and contradictory
messages sent through this seemingly unholy alliance of the profane
dynamics of political-economics with 'eternal' sacred spirituality
(e.g. capitalist 'state' religion).

this is very difficult to write because it is of a private
prerogative as to these dynamics. and it is to attempt to convey the
idea that a person who 'believes' in the Christian faith, and is
grounded within their self as to what this circuitry consists of
(linking mental with physical circuitry, as to human existence) -- it
is then an issue of what this person believes and does with this
belief, in the world, that is paramount to the religion and its
substance. do they recognize the dimensions that may exist in the
environment, as to symbolism and this 'sea of crosses' -- do they
shared certain values and uphold these, in complex scenarios, as best
as they are capable -- do they recognize the dynamics at work, in
this machinery, in these human relations -- do they carry this
foundation within themselves, as they relate to others, or has it
been lost, forgotten?

my personal take on this private aspect of the global infrastructure,
as to having ubiquitous 'cross' symbols flooding the planet under
this universalizing geometry of the grid, is that it is a 'state of
questioning', if not a type of test as to how people relate to such a
situation. i mean -- this situation is quite profound if it is to be
considered in its full range of dimensions -- it is like a giant
enigmatic gift of sorts -- and people get to then decide what it
means to them. and maybe this will only be mediated in private terms,
too, largely. in that there will not be focus groups and voting in
democracies about what this means in the here and now. it is instead
to be mediated in a person's heart, as their mental and physical
circuits find their balance of the issues and the 'reality' of what
is presented, in the most personal of terms (you and your beliefs, etc).

so, it could be that this sea of crosses then is an issue of belief
that individuals may mediate and then, of those people, those who
relate in certain shared frameworks and dimensions may cluster
together. say, believers and non-believers, even. this is to say, not
just 'believers' in the cross as an empty symbol (the next post deals
with this) -- and instead, the cross as a particular symbol and
allegiance to a certain faith, to a certain shared meaning,
obligation to greater being, service, sacrifice, the human family,
and so on.

the private aspect of this, in terms of Christian faith, then could
be quite deeply considered, as to what all of this may mean, what
this may imply about temporal existence, about how the past and
future may find relation in the present moment, on this street, in
the here and now. with what has past and what will arrive, and where
one stands in relation to this context, this event, this eventuality
even, given one's prerogative.

the clarification that is intended here is to say that someone may
have private understanding of the many dimensions involved and may
mediate them, in such a complex scenario, and in this moment on
Earth, it is this 'sea of crosses' which may be especially
meaningful, as to the reality that is shared in such a way.

though further -- it is to also seek to convey, that in the 'truth'
of this belief, its grounding in the everyday environment, that this
belief, this 'true cross' (*) is what is most important as to the
meaning of the 'sea of crosses.' if this 'truth' of the symbolic
Christian cross, as it relates to crucifixion, is not understood in
terms of its metaphysical teachings (values transmitted through this
symbol)... then any external relation to this cross may not be met by
the belief which sustains this symbolism, itself.

(*white cross meant to symbolize the equilibrium of mind and body in
heart with regard to these issues).

in other words, the power of this cross resides in the people who
believe and sustain this belief, which is based in a shared
understanding which may relate to certain facts and beliefs which may
or may not be shared by others, in a private accounting. yet for
those who believe in this Christian dimensionality, and who seek to
ground this belief in their actual existence, their lives as lived,
as practiced (not just theorized) -- it then involves more than just
'wearing a cross' around one's neck as an accessory. for example. it
is a certain understanding about what this individual and collective
sacrifice is about. the reason it exists.

and while this 'reason' may not be universally shared amongst all
people the same, within a certain subset of humanity, it may be. and
this may be a 'private' group of the larger whole of the human
population, thus 'private' in terms of this global zoning. yet so
too, in this subset, these Christians may then constitute within this
set their own 'public' (i.e. the nesting of sets/subsets). and the
point here is that in this private zoning of religion there can be a
public zone of Christianity that exists, and this is 'no less real'
with regard to the ability to mediate dimensional relations between
people as to grounded existence and shared being -- it is an issue of
what these terms of engagement are.

so imagine a machinery of state, as it exists, in its 'public'
manifestation, which is devoid of Â shard values as to 'one being' in
its functioning. and it may be that many degrade those who hold
higher ideals and-or principles for living, beyond the private
relativism of self and its profit based on self-interest above all
else. yet what if there are larger dynamics at work in this cosmic
circuitry? what if this question of 'one being' is not mediated in
the state, as it exists, in terms of the larger commitment of a self
to these greater ideals, and instead, it is an issue of personal
choice, *free-will*, as to what path one will develop their self by...

and what if someone follows 'the state' as it exists, which is a
machine, which is churning into nothingness, in terms of its beliefs,
that there is no there there, in terms of this shared being. it is
just 'me me me'... 'i am [all that is] -- there is nothing greater
than [myself]' etc. Â one could even say the popular ideology now
encourages such conceit, as part of the cultural zeitgeist of
everything goes...

at what point, then, may it be realized that this private
dimensionality still exists, and does not simply 'go away' just
because someone ignores it or is not paying attention or could care
less, because it hurts their style? that, even while it may not be
the basis for the status quo of this machinery, that people who do in
fact (and in deed) _believe in monotheism, in 'one being', are not
simply ungrounded or unhinged as to 'how things exist' in the world?
it is quite interesting to consider because 'reality, inc' as it
presents itself in the mass media goes out of its way to make these
dimensions seem arcane, out of day, passe, and old.

they are old, very old. ancient, if not older and beyond time. and
the speeding newscast of the split-second television newscast, radio
or internet transmissions may warp the basis for understanding this
condition, in a common framework that exists beyond political
commercialization of being and existence in this state...

yet, those who have a framework for understanding and knowledge that
exists beyond this 'nothingness' of the machinery of state, as to
shared values beyond political-economy as society, then also may have
another view of this mundane landscape -- whence it turns
extraordinary, such as in the 'sea of crosses' and in such a symbolic
flood, as to who believe and do not believe the *facts* that present
themselves. that is, that logically reason as to the most accurate
modeling of reality as to what exists as it exists, even if this were
to invert the very paradigm of reality that exists in terms of the
status quo and *its beliefs*.

this is a reason why it is so complex to seek to explain any of this,
and yet it can also be assumed that the people who care to know, or
already connect in these dimensions, have a plethora of resources in
which to then further relate in these same terms, as to this sharing
of dimensions which may constitute a reality.

[note: not the only reality, or perspective of events, yet in terms
of a certain framework it can be modeled as an issue of nesting of
sets and subsets, whereby, within this condition, the larger set is
confined by the lesser subset which then may imply a reversal of
these dynamics may be in store, for these relations...]

in other words, it is to suggest that public zone or private zone,
there is a reality that is being mediated and related to, as to
individual and collective being and existence. and that this also
exists in a context of logic, to some degree, even if the boundaries
of these considerations are not entirely clear at present. and this
may be the point -- that people will decide what this situation is,
that exists, as it exists -- and there will be views that are
grounded, both publicly and privately, as to this existence and these
human relations, and will work towards this co-existence of 'one
being' and there will be those who may stand against this view.

crosses or no crosses in the infrastructure, the 'truth' of this
situation that reveals itself in this questioning of an
infrastructure of cross-symbolism, then provides a model for
mediating this shared condition of truth, as it exists in relation to
power, and must work through the bias, distortion, and warping of the
ungrounded Â perspectives which often are generated from ideology, and
in particular, values of the machinery of state. in a sense, this
again is that context of the duel, humans and machines, even, if
considered in terms of the role of _reason in mediating this
condition between peoples, versus power, force, and violence of one
side versus another, as to beliefs which do not touch ground, from
mental concepts to actual physical material.

in other words, in a sense, this would seem to be a test not only of
ideas, yet also of ideologies, including those who may believe that
'religion' exists in the symbol of the cross, yet outside of the
actual believers in this cross, who also shoulder its responsibility.

[for several posts i have wanted to make this particular point: that
as i understand Muslims teachings, it is a similar issue as to the
'avoidance of icons' and issues of representation -- yet in the
context of the cross of Christians -- where this 'true cross' could
be replaced by an empty cross-symbolism, that could become largely
devoid of spiritual charge because this is not revered within the
hearts of those who encounter it. it could instead become a profane
aspect of its exploitation instead, (which is a particular
interpretation) in which 'the symbol' becomes less of an idea that is
shared than an ideology that is detached from its own basis in
reality, and as such, ungrounded from its spiritual dimensions and
purposes. this again could then be a case in point for why boundaries
can serve to protect this exploitation, this dilution of meaning via
the ubiquity of advertising 'belief' which then becomes separated
from its 'truth' (i.e. the cross from true cross).

as such, it is proposed that in such a way, the cross-arm
infrastructure may in fact do more harm than good, in terms of
Christian teaching and values, as a method of developing cultural
infrastructure, if it is indeed even relevant to this situation,
which is to be determined by each person as to what this means. yet,
that said, there is the past where such dynamics which were once
'public' via set relations now have more private dimensions, due to
complexity and management in a diversified human culture, yet so too,
this issue of 'one being' does not simply go away. it is merely an
issue of re-interpretation of these same issues and dynamics from
another perspective or zone, within a panoptic condition in the
shared state.

the metaphysics exist, the values and dimensional relations are there/
here, to be mediated, in some way. people have liberty to choose, in
this private framework or 'right', as a human being. you do not need
to talk to another to resolve such issues, ultimately. it is a
different issue than that which a state can mediate. that can
legislate, as to this belief, as to the value of this truth, in
relation to the status quo of the machine.

yet, the provocative aspect of this situation would seem to be in
saying that this 'sea of crosses' should not nor need not exist, as
part of the public state and its infrastructural ordering and
development. that is, that future global ordering needs to be
balanced in a neutral order which is not tending towards a private
POV or symbolism, as this may cause conflicts as to issues of
colonization, religious crusades, private empire, and so on. -- such
that, while this situation exists as it does (it is what it is, in
the here and now, however a person may relate to it), this is also
tied into issues of private history and patriarchal dynamics in
addition to western cultural symbols that do not easily equate to a
shared 'universal' framework for development, if only via the issues
of aesthetics, yet more accurately to how this represents the culture
of economics and politics and society, based in shared values and
their exchange as mediated in relations of shared identity.

that is, the crosses as symbols are artifacts of a certain lineage of
western development of world ordering and this is seen in the present
moment, yet it does not necessarily mean it should or must extend
into the indefinite future. instead, it may be that some of what is
involved in this condition is part of why things are the way they
are, with wars over religion, while the machine seems to be the only
one who is benefitting.

this is an intriguing situation because it is a type of
archaeological-architectural crossroads as mediated in aesthetics,
art and architecture, feasibly, as representative of culture and
shared values and identities. to define this as it was, for those in
the west, in certain terms and frameworks, and then, the possibility
of am improvement and refinement of this core infrastructure, into a
more equitable and just design of society.

what will eventually occur, it is proposed, is that these 'poles' are
only vestigial, and while the 'crosses' may be the focus of this
questioning, that there is a certain inevitability to a certain
advance in this same infrastructure, that one day it will become
'wireless' via tapping into the new energy of Nikola Tesla, where
wireless power will be transmitted through the air, and the majority
of these poles will be residual. ruins. that may gradually if not at
once disappear, as part of this common ordering (parti) and then
require an upgrade as to what this shared ordering will be -- what
the next parti will be that occupies and delineates space, time, and
place. (for instance, maybe it is one pole per block, with sensors
for weather, sound, data transmission, which becomes a regular
cultural marker).

in any case, ultimately what is involved in looking at this imagine
of power delivery via infrastructure may have less and less to do
with wires and this skeletal structuring, and may become even more
detached, aetheric, 'informational' (virtual) and of the atmosphere
of mind and imagination than can now be seen. such that, just as
wired power delivery may evolve into wireless, so too, gasoline
engines may transform not into simply flex-fuel vehicles and instead
into electromagnetic levitation and propulsion (e.g. Starwars
Landspeeder) -- given the necessary breakthroughs and discoveries as
to the how the cosmos are 'more accurately' known to exist, and to
begin harnessing these dynamics in the next infrastructural upgrade.

so, a future without electrical poles (nor crosses on the poles) can
be imagined as a matter of course, in the realm of infrastructural
development -- yet what does this take away from the truth of the
faith, not only that may be believed to exist, yet which does exist
as a grounded understanding for those who privately recognize and
serve it...

it is proposed that the present condition is, as such, an enigma, in
that beneath this 'sea of crosses' lies what is a machinery of state,
the megamachine, which must be mediated. and these crosses can also
serve to mask this condition, or to equate this machinic-value with a
type of ideological religious belief -- yet it is not a belief in
'one being' -- it is instead a belief in this machinery -- at its
core, "nothingness".

that is, no belief. and that the present condition as such could be
seen as a complex testing of how people may mediate this dynamic,
between a machine of state, and issues of humanity and service to one
being. and that, it may then be that this 'religious dimensionality'
of the infrastructural then provides a _context, which then begins to
define or zone this _condition which exists, which is shared, and
must be mediated, by human beings, in order to co-exist on the planet
in harmony, as to this greater ordering in the cosmos.

this is the duel, then, the splitting into sides, the believers in
being and those who believe in nothing, and are themselves only
machines, in essence. and exist ungrounded as to the more accurate
nature of reality and the events that may transpire, as a result of
decision-making via clusters of people with freedom of will to locate
their self within this larger empirical condition - beyond that of
the private 'reality, inc' of the mass media, and into the cosmic
reality of metaphysical truth, as it is grounded in the world of
reason and faith.

the 'sea of crosses' then may only be a temporary condition -- it may
be a moment of waking up to what exists, and has existed, as a
subconscious relation, which becomes conscious, and is thus then
mediated by people as to its various issues, both publicly and
privately, as people relate these issues and situation to their own
self, finding balance or short-circuiting, and interact with others
in like and unlike dimensions, such that the patterns of how a person
relates to this situation then may also scale with many others, as to
shared values based in grounded beliefs, and how one's life aligns to
such a framework or ignores it. as such, these connections of self
with self and self with others, then, as they scale, become
environments of people who relate in certain ways to this 'sea of
crosses' -- and while there may be a lot who are 'religious' Â -- how
many base this religiosity in the truth versus opinion? how many are
grounded in their faith and the belief in a greater being (one being)
and what are people doing in their lives within these dimensions --
or, is it like the ubiquitous cross, and only symbolic if not even
superficial and a screen for another agenda?

maybe this 'sea of crosses' then exists only in relation to
Christians, in some sense, as if calling to account for those who may
'believe' in the ideology, versus those who may understand and uphold
the philosophy. this is what is great about religion, and also
beneficial about private zoning of shared metaphysics, and in
particular, the monotheistic religions as they relate as a shared
circuit -- in such a case, it is likely that the reasoning of this
symbolism can be evaluated by all religions as to the truth of its
condition, and that there can is a symbolic understanding that is
accessible to those who engage these ideas -- which oftentimes can
include Muslim and Jewish peoples as well as Christians as part of a
shared heritage. it is not to say this is necessarily viewed the
same, or exists as the same question as to issues of faith or belief,
yet there is a certain 'reality' as to the truth of the existence of
these crosses and their context, which can and must be mediated --
via reason, in some fundamental way.

in other words, this is an attempt to say that it is unlikely that a
person of monotheistic faith would simply condemn the potential
meaning of this 'sea of crosses' or necessarily view them only as
with hostile intent, if indeed there was greater substance to this
condition which must be mediated as to this 'shared being.'

(it is still in inadequate way of saying: it is this type of
investigation and archaeological mindset, curiosity if not
consciousness, which may help those in the 21st century relate to
their ancient roots, and connect the complex world of the middle-east
with that of the middle-west, via shared values -- and that while
these may have different relative perspectives, that there is also a
shared empirical condition as to this shared monotheistic culture --
which, if zoned effectively, can also balance other beliefs in a
shared metaphysic truth, throughout a common world civilization,
which then can become the basis for a shared world order. it is in
this aspect of 'philosophy' that this dynamics exist, it is proposed,
in that like science is also an issue of technical philosophy and
theology, religious philosophy, that these can begin functioning in
public and private zones, via shared values, to defining a shared
state, in terms of what is the basis for public and private
relations, as to rights and responsibilities, and to balancing the
overall circuit with the individual, as to this 'one being' in the
state, as it relates and serves 'life', versus the interests of
machine development.

in any case, the overall clarification was to seek to say, even
without these crosses, the truth of the 'faith' and the actuality of
belief, as it exists grounded in the world as to an accurate
appraisal of the situation, is an issue that has to do with an
individual being as they exist in the world. this is at the heart of
the issue of zoning, because 'private' zoning does not lessen the
public reality, it is only an issue of perspective and relation in a
more complex relation between humans on the planet, and how to govern
as to 'one being'.

the infrastructural symbology is secondary or tertiary if not
counterproductive to the daily existence of a person in relation to
this machine, as they mediate it based on squaring their emotions
with their thoughts and actions, in this world. that is, grounding
the self with the self, with others and with the environment.

the 'truth' and 'reality' of this situation, (say, true cross) may
indeed be mediated by the individual, as to what is going on in the
present, if and when confronted by a choice which splits along the
ideological lines of humanity versus machinery -- which side are you
on? -- and in that case, it may be there is a shift in the way people
relate to one another, in what terms, and via what values -- as to
how this state then functions. and, frankly, it needs to be said that
some people 'have no beliefs' yet through mass society can be easily
accommodated in existing in ways which may be 'ungrounded' as to a
moment of higher-accounting. and it is as such that in this 'sea of
crosses' may exist an indication of the 'reality' of such a higher-
accounting, that in the public sense of metaphysical truths, just
such a condition may be waiting in this charg'ed void, ready to
spring upon these, our mortal coils, with fierce and brutal clarity
as to the state of these affairs.
