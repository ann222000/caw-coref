This talks about him seeing an object that looks
similar to an Eskimo igloo.

...........................................................

For a moment the voice was still and then it said gently:
&quot;Among the countless other worlds in the cosmos, Orfeo, the
children of Earth are as babes, although many of them
believe they are close to the ultimate of knowledge. Among
the worlds of the universe are many types of s-iritual and
physical e-olutions. Each form of intelligent life adapts
itself to the physical conditions prevalent upon its home
planet. Most of these ev-lutions exist in more highly
attenuated forms of matter than upon Earth. But the
majority are rather similar to man in appearance. There is
a definite reason for this being so.
In reality, we are Earth's older brothers and thus we
will aid Earth's people insofar as they, through free will,
will permit us to do so.&quot;

As I listened to that kind, gentle voice I began to feel
a warm, glowing wave of love enfold me; so powerful that it
seemed as a tangible soft, golden light. For a wonderful
moment I felt infinitely greater, finer and stronger than I
knew myself to be. It was as though momentarily I had
transcended mortality and was somehow related to these
superior beings.

&quot;We'll contact you again, Orfeo,&quot; the voice said. &quot;But
for now, friend, it is goodnight.&quot;

The two shimmering green disks faded almost out; then I
heard a low hum as they flamed brilliantly into glowing
green fire and shot up into the sky in the direction taken
earlier by the larger red disk.
In an incredibly short time they too had vanished,
leaving me standing alone by my car.

Bewilderment, incredulity, shock and stark fear flooded
over me - sudden conviction that I had lost my mind and
gone raving mad. What I had witnessed, I felt, just
couldn't have happened.

I raised my numbed hand and it was trembling violently. I
saw by my watch that it was almost two o'clock in the
morning. I climbed shakily into my car and kicked the
starter. Panic was mounting in me.
I twisted the steering wheel, gunned the engine and made
a sharp, fast U turn to get back onto the road. The tires
screamed and the car lurched.

I wanted to get home quickly. I wanted to get back to the
world of sane reality. I wanted someone to assure me I
wasn't going mad.

I drove with only a single objective in my mind - to get
home! When finally I made the turn onto Glendale Boulevard
and saw the lights of my apartment I breathed a heavy sigh
of relief; no place had ever so good to me!

I left the car in the driveway and ran into the house. My
wife was waiting up, worried and anxious because I was so
late.

&quot;Orfeo, what's the matter? What's wrong? You're white as
a sheet!&quot;

I stood staring at her, unable to speak.

She came to me and grasped my hand. &quot;Orfeo, you're sick!
I'm going to call a doctor.&quot;

I put my arms around her. I wanted only to feel her close
to me and for the moment to try not to think of what I had
been through.

She pleaded with me to tell her what had happened.

&quot;Tomorrow - maybe tomorrow, Mae, I can tell you . . . .&quot;

Finally we got to bed, but it was almost dawn before I
drifted into a troubled half sleep.

Chapter 2

I TRAVEL IN A FLYING SAUCER

I spent nearly all day Saturday in bed. The shock of my
fantastic experience was so great that I found it
difficult to get back to actualities. I kept having the
feeling that the world I knew was a phantom world inhabited
only by shadows.

It was not until Sunday that I could bring myself to tell
my wife what had happened to me. I was afraid she would
think I had lost my mind. Thus it was with relief I heard
her say: &quot;If you say it happened like that, Orfeo, I
believe you. You've always told me the truth. But this
thing is so strange and frightening - and you looked so
deathly white when you came in.&quot;

I could only put my arms around her as I replied: &quot;It
scares me too, Mabel - I don't know what to think!&quot;

Sunday afternoon I took my twelve year old son Richard
and drove back to the spot on Forest Lawn Drive where I had
seen the disks. There in the loose dirt I found the deep
skid marks the tires of my car had made Friday night.
Richard looked at me curiously and asked what I was
looking for. I pointed to the skid marks and told him that
was the spot where I hadseen what could only have been a
flying saucer. Richard stared incredulously. &quot;But dad, I
thought you always laughed at people who believed in those
things.&quot;

&quot;You're right, son,&quot; I replied. &quot;But that was only
because I didn't know any better. Friday night I saw three
of the saucers from this very spot.&quot;

Richard's eyes widened with interest. Then he began
shooting questions at me so fast that I had to ask him to
slow down. But I was glad he did not doubt my word.

Seeing those skid marks where I had gunned my car in
panic to get away from the eerie spot assured me of the
reality of my experience.
I was convinced that I had been in contact with beings
from another world.

Monday night I went back to my swing-shift job at
L-ckheed. It felt good to be back at work again! The
friendly banter, laughter and jokes of my coworkers were
just what I needed.

Beyond my family I told no one of that first experience,
as I knew I would be ridiculed. In fact even at home very
little was said about the saucers or my experience, for
the subject invariably upset my wife and filled her with
such apprehension that even the boys refrained from talking
much about it.

But when I was alone I thought long and often about those
incredible beings from that other world. The voice had
promised: &quot;We'll contact you again, Orfeo.&quot; I wondered when
they would get in touch with me again and how? Had they
meant soon - or would it be months or even years? These and
hundreds of similar questions clamored in my mind.

I wondered if I was under constant observation by them.
If so, I thought that through t-lepathy I could signal them
to return. One night I went back to that lonely spot on
Forest Lawn Drive and tried to establish tel-pathic
communication. But it was useless! No glowing red disk
appeared - only the night and the empty skies that gave
back no answer.

Weeks passed and still no further sign from them. Doubts
began to trouble me. Time dulled the memory of that night
and I began to wonder if my experience had actually been
real after all.

Then early in July there began a fresh flood of
well-authenticated sightings of saucers in the skies over
Southern California. Local newspapers carried banner
headlines announcing FLYING SAUCERS OVEROS ANGELES! Some
people were convinced we had interplanetary visitors and
looked for mass landings at any moment.

Later in the month additional sensational sightings were
reported from many other States. It seemed the skies were
filled with the baffling mystery objects that defied all
natural laws and behaved more like phantoms than material
realities. As I avidly read each newaccount I became
convinced anew that I knew the s-cret of the flying
saucers. But I longed for more knowledge. I hoped and
p-ayed for another contact with those incredible beings I
had seen so briefly that Friday night.

July 23, 1952 I didn't go to work. I wasn't feeling well
and believed I was coming down with the flu. I was in bed
all day, but in the evening I felt a little better and
thought a walk in the fresh air would be good for me.

I walked down to the snack-bar at the Los Feliz Drive-In
theatre, several blocks from the eleven-unit
apartment-court where we live.
The small cafe has a warm, friendly atmosphere and it
gave my s-irits a big lift to listen to the small talk and
friendly ribbing. Because of the many recent newspaper
reports, the talk turned to flying saucers.

Ann, one of the waitresses, laughingly remarked that she
couldn't get enough sleep as her husband insisted upon
staying up most of the night watching the sky with
binoculars trying to get a glimpse of a saucer. This
brought on a round of flying saucer jokes and everyone
was laughing, including myself. The fact that I could laugh
indicates that I had pretty well gotten over the shock of
my experience.

When I'd finished my coffee I left the snack-bar and
started home. It was a little after ten o'clock. Beyond the
theatre is a lonely stretch of vacant lots. The place is
eerie and forbidding at night, for huge concrete buttresses
rise from it supporting the Hyperion Avenue Freeway Bridge
several hundred feet overhead. The bridge casts dense,
oblique shadows down below making it a shadowed no-man's
land.

As I crossed the vacant lots in the deep shadows of the
bridge a peculiar feeling came over me. Instantly I
remembered that sensation - the tingling in my arms and
legs! I looked nervously over-head but saw nothing. The
feeling became more intense and with it came the dulling
of consciousness I had noted on that other occasion.

Between me and the bridge I noticed a misty obstruction.
I couldn't make out what it was. It looked like an Eskimo
igloo - or the phantom of an igloo. It seemed like a
luminous shadow without substance. I stared hard at the
object. It was absolutely incredible - like a huge, misty
soap bubble squatting on the ground emitting a fuzzy, pale
glow.

This part tells about him going aboard an alien
spacecraft.

...........................................................
...........................................................

The object appeared to be about thirty feet high and
about equally wide at the base, so it wasn't a sphere. As I
watched, it seemed to gain substance and to darken
perceptibly on the outside. Then I noticed it had an
aperture, or entrance like the door to an igloo, and the
inside was brilliantly lighted.

I walked toward the thing. I had absolutely no sense of
fear; rather a pleasant feeling of well-being. At the
entrance I could see a large circular room inside.
Hesitating only an instant I stepped into the object.

I found myself in a circular, domed room about eighteen
feet in diameter. The interior was made of an ethereal
mother-of-pearl stuff, irridescent with exquisite colors
that gave off light. There was no sign of life; no sound.
There was a reclining chair directly across from the
entrance. It was made of that same translucent, shimmering
substance - a stuff so evanescent that it didn't appear to
be material reality as we know it.

No voice spoke, but I received the strong impression that
I was to sit in the chair. In fact, a force seemed to be
impelling me directly toward it. As I sat down I marveled
at the texture of the material.
Seated therein, I felt suspended in air, for the
substance of that chair molded itself to fit every surface
or movement of my body.

As I leaned back and relaxed, that feeling of peace and
well-being intensified. Then a movement drew my attention
toward the entrance. I saw the walls appeared to be
noiselessly moving to close the aperture to the outside. In
a few seconds the door had vanished, with no indication
that there had ever been an entrance.

The closing of that door cut me off entirely from the
outside world.
For an uncomfortable moment I felt utterly alone - lost
to my family and friends. But almost immediately a pleasant
warmth passed over me giving me once more that feeling of
peace and security. I breathed deeply and found the air
cool and fresh. Vaguely I wondered what was going to happen
next.

Then I thought I heard a humming sound. At first it was
almost inaudible, but it grew to a steady, lowpitched
rhythm that was more like a vibration than a hum.

Next I was aware that my body seemed to be sinking more
deeply into the soft substance of the chair. I felt as
though a gentle force was pushing against the entire
surface of my body. It was a peculiarly pleasant sensation
that put me into a kind of semi-dream state.

While the humming sound increased I noticed that the room
was darkening as though a heavy shadow was engulfing the
room in twilight. As the light diminshed I began to grow
apprehensive. I had the realization of how alone and
helpless I actually was. For a bad moment I was on the edge
of panic in the tightly sealed, darkening room.

Then ... I heard music! It seemed to be coming from the
walls. I couldn't believe my ears when I recognized the
melody as my favorite song, &quot;Fools Rush In&quot;. The panic
within me subsided for I realized how safe I was with them
- they who knew my every thought, dream and cherished hope!

Reassured, I settled back to enjoy the music. In a few
seconds the interior of the room began to grow light again.
Soon it was more brilliantly lighted than ever. It was at
that moment that I noticed a glittering piece of metal on
the floor of the craft. It was the shape and about the size
of a quarter. I reached down and picked it up. It was
different from any kind of metal I had ever seen, for it
seemed almost to be alive in my hand. It quivered and began
to glow almost like a live coal; yet it remained at the
same temperature as my body.
Now I noticed that the piece of metal was diminishing in
size. It was as though some mysterious kind of sublimation
or degeneration was taking place before my eyes. Could it
be that contact with my hand was causing the substance to
dissipate into the air? I placed it back upon the floor of
the craft. There it ceased to quiver and the odd glow was
no longer apparent.

I leaned back in the chair and noticed my soiled, faded
work clothes which I had worn when I went to the snack-bar.
The coarse fabric appeared crude and glaringly out of place
in the exquisite, shimmering mother-of-pearl room.

&quot;Where are they taking me?&quot; I wondered, as I half
listened to the music. For I was certain that the craft I
was in must be moving. Were they taking me to their world,
or was I going to spend eternity lost in space in that
pearly igloo?

While I was still pondering these questions I felt the
push against the surface of my body lessen, then cease
altogether. The music stopped playing and the humming
vibration in the floor died away too.
I was certain that whatever type of motive power was used
was housed somewhere below the floor as the faint vibratory
hum definitely came from there.

Then smoothly and noiselessly the chair made a quarter
turn toward the wall. Even as much as I trusted my unseen
friends I was a little frightened at this. Tensely I
waited, gripping the arms of the chair.
Directly in front of me a circular opening appeared in
the wall about six feet in diameter, but everything
appeared hazy through it.

As I stared, the lights inside darkened. Then either the
entire craft or the seat turned slightly more to the left
and the strange window widened about three more feet. I saw
a huge globe surrounded with a shimmering rainbow. I
trembled as I realized I was actually looking upon a planet
from somewhere out in space. The planet itself was of a
deep, twilight-blue intensity and the iridescent rainbow
surrounding it made it appear like a dream vision. I
couldn't see it all, for a portion at the bottom of the
sphere was cut off by the floor line.

Now I heard that voice I remembered so well. &quot;Orfeo, you
are looking upon Earth - your home! From here, over a
thousand miles away in space, it appears as the most
beautiful planet in the heavens and a haven of peace and
tranquility. But you and your Earthly brothers know the
true conditions there.&quot;

As I listened to the tender, gentle intonations of that
wonderful voice an overwhelming sense of sadness came over
me. I felt tears in my eyes - I who had not know the relief
of tears since I was a small boy. My heart was so full of
emotion that tears were the only possible expression. They
flowed unheeded down my cheeks. I was not ashamed for the
tears seemed somehow to cleanse and purify me and to break
down the hard, unfeeling, crystallized shell of The
Reasoner that I had come to pride myself upon being.

The voice said softly: &quot;Weep, Orfeo. Let tears unblind
your eyes. For at this moment we weep with you for Earth
and her Children. For all of its apparent beauty Earth is a
p-rgatorial world among the planets evolving intelligent
life. Hate, selfishness and cruelty rise from many parts of
it like a dark mist.&quot;

The words brought fresh tears to my eyes as I thought of
conditions on Earth and how they must appear to these
perfected, compassionate beings who had extra-dimensional
sight.

There was silence for a moment. Then I noticed that the
room was apparently revolving away from Earth. Gradually
the heavens came into view - an awesome, breathtaking sight
from that tiny craft. All space appeared intensely black
and the stars incredibly brilliant, set like jewels against
black velvet - large, small; single and clustered. I felt
lost in a strangely beautiful, ethereal world of cel-stial
wonder.

All was brooding silence, order and indescribable beauty.
A deep feeling of reverence possessed me. I had never been
an actively r-ligious man, but in that moment I knew G-d as
a tangible, immutable Force that reaches to the furthest
depths of Time and Eternity. And I felt assurance that the
beings in whose care I was at that moment were close to the
Infinite Power.

For a moment there was deep silence. Then as I wiped away
the tears I saw a fantastic object coming slowly into view
through the &quot;window&quot;.
It resembled a dirigible except that it was definitely
flattened at the bottom. It emerged gradually into view
from the right.

I studied it closely, wondering at its composition. It
did not appear to be metallic like an airplane, but was
definitely crystalline and gave the illusion of
transparency. Its light properties definitely suggested
perfect crystal alloyed throughout. I surmised it might be
some sort of crystal-metal-plastic combination. When the
entire ship was in view it appeared to be at least 1000
feet long and about 90 feet thick, but it could have been a
great deal larger for there was no way to judge how close I
was to it.
I stared fascinated at the half-eth-real &quot;ship&quot;, scarcely
conscious that I was again hearing music. But as my ears
caught a startling, unfamiliar, strain, I listened intently
to music such as I had never heard or could imagine. It is
beyond description, for it was not music as we know it, nor
was it played to our musical scale. It was strange,
haunting drifts of melody that brought visions of star
galaxies and planets spinning in notes of perfect harmony.

Here it is explained why he couldn't be granted perfect
health.

...........................................................
...........................................................

The voice spoke again: &quot;Brother of Earth, each entity of
your planet is d-vinely created and immortal. Upon your
world the mortal shadows of those entities are working out
their s-lvation from the plane of darkness. Every person
upon Earth and its adjoining planes of manifestation are
definitely arrayed upon either the positive side of
progression toward good, or on the negative side of
regression toward greater e-il. We know where you stand,
Orfeo; but are you going to be content to drift as you have
been?&quot;

&quot;No . . . . oh, no!&quot; I replied impulsively. &quot;I want to
work constructively. Only grant me strong physical health
and there isn't anything I shan't be able to accomplish.&quot;

The voice replied gently. &quot;That wish we cannot grant you,
Orfeo, as much as we might like to. It is only because your
physical body is weakened and your s-iritual perceptions
thereby keener that we have been able to contact you. Had
you been physically in robust health with your mortal body
and mind perfectly attuned to the sluggish lowered
vibrations of Earth, we could not have manifested to you.

&quot;Sickness, ill-health and all mortal afflictions are
transient and unreal. They, along with pain, sorrow,
suffering and conflict make up mankind's lessons in the
school of the world where wisdom and sp-ritual e-olution
are gained primarily through suffering. An explanation of
this terrible enigma will be given to you later. But
tonight we tell you that you can rise above the
inadequacies of your physical body, Orfeo, as may all other
Earthlings. Remember always that we love you and your
brothers of Earth. We will do everything within our power
for the children of Earth that they will permit us to do,
through free will.

With these words, the huge ship I was observing began
moving upward and toward the left. One large &quot;porthole&quot;
after another opened in rapid succession as the ship
ascended until what appeared to be three decks were visible
and I could catch fleeting glimpses of the interior of the
gigantic sky ship. The inside appeared to be of the same
luminous mother-of-pearl substance as the interior of the
craft I was in. But I saw nothing more, no sign of life,
no furnishings or equipment such as we on Earth know.

As I watched the ship I realized that the voice as well
as the ethereal music had actually originated in the great
sky ship. It came to me then that this must be a mother
ship and that beings in it had remote control over the
movements of the saucers that skimmed and skipped through
our atmosphere. It awed me to realize what a high degree of
intelligence and what expert hands were behind the saucer
phenomena. I felt ashamed of having pleaded for a healthy
body, who had already been granted so much.

As the craft moved further out into space I noticed what
appeared to be a rotor at each end of the ship. I say
rotor, but actually the things appeared to be vortices of
flame.

With my limited knowledge I judged these incredible disks
of fire to be tremendously powerful power plants whose
terrific energy could be diverted to almost any purpose.
The disks I had first seen were used as radio transmitters
and receivers; then as a huge three-dimensional television
screen on which, through some method of t-lepathic contact,
it was possible both to see and to hear. Now I saw those
same disks apparently propelling the vast sky ship. It was
my guess that just such a power plant had shot the very
craft I was in a thousand miles out into space in a mere
matter of minutes and without any discomfort to me. It was
clearly evident that all of the bewildering and
insurmountable problems of space travel that baffled our
engineers and scientists had been overcome by these people
to such an extent that the entire trip into outer space was
as simple as a ride in an elevator.

I wondered if they had discovered the secret of resisting
gravity with its counter-force; if not, then by what other
means had they conquered or neutralized gravity? I
remembered that Earth's scientists believed that a man in a
space ship would be absolutely weightless and apt to float
about. I lifted my hand and let it drop to the arm of the
chair. It behaved precisely as it would have on Earth.
There must be an artificial gravity induced in the floor
of the craft.

I wondered too how they had overcome the menace of lethal
cosmic rays, meteors, sky debris, etc. Surely my ship
carried no tons of lead shielding scientists declared
necessary for adequate protection from cosmic rays. Also,
I wondered in what way they had mastered the terrific
pressure and temperature changes so that I was never
conscious at any time of variations in either? And their
motive power; what was the fantastic se-ret of those green
fireballs?
Possibly they were vortices of magnetic power which
operated almost silently and with astounding efficiency.
What a wonder world their planet must be, I thought, as I
gazed in awe at the crystalline dream-ship passing from my
line of vision.
Slowly then the room turned back toward the left and the
Earth appeared once more with its shimmering rainbow halo.
Dimly I could make out the faint outlines of the Western
Hemisphere in varying shades of misty blue. Also I could
see faint puffs of light scattered here and there which I
judged to be the larger cities of the North American
continent.

Two flying saucers darted into view and sped downward
toward Earth. Just as abruptly they decelerated and hung
suspended in space as pinpoints of light. As I was
wondering about them I heard the voice say that one was
over Washington, D. C. and the other over Los Angeles. Los
Angeles - the word echoed in my consciousness as I gazed at
the faint brush of light that was a great sprawling city.
I tried to remember that Los Angeles was my home, but it
seemed only vaguely familiar; a place remembered somewhere
in Time.

&quot;Tonight, Orfeo,&quot; the voice continued, &quot;you have explored
a minute distance into the limitless highways of the
universe. Through your own efforts the road may later be
widened for you. Tonight you, an entity of Earth, have come
close to the Infinite Entities. For the present you are our
emissary, Orfeo, and you must act! Even though people of
Earth laugh derisively and mock you as a l-natic, tell them
about us!&quot;
&quot;I will .... I will ...&quot; I whispered haltingly knowing
that everything I said was heard by them even as all my
thoughts were known to them.

&quot;We know you will, Orfeo,&quot; the voice replied. &quot;Thus
tonight a special privilege has been yours. We love the
Children of Earth and it is our desire to help them as the
hour of crisis approaches. But only through  such harmless
ones as you can we work.

&quot;The aggressive men of Earth want our scientific
advancements. For these they would s-oot our crafts from
the skies - if they could. But additional scientific
knowledge we cannot give to Earth except as we are now
doing in a manner perfectly in accord and harmony with
cosmic law. Already man's material knowledge has far
outstripped the growth of brotherly love and spi-itual
understanding in his heart. Therein lies the present
danger. To add to the destructive phase of man's scientific
knowledge is not permitted. We are working now to turn
that knowledge to constructive purposes upon Earth. Also we
hope to give men a deeper knowledge and understanding of
their own true nature and a greater awareness of the
evol-tionary crisis facing them. At present we are working
along all constructive lines of human endeavor and
especially in the fields of medicine and healing. Surely
you cannot fail to see the tremendous advances which have
been made in this direction within the last few years. Even
greater 'discoveries' are at hand including success in the
fight against c-ncer. Thus shall we continue to work with
and through men.&quot;

I listened to the compassionate voice, trying to imprint
every word on my consciousness. But I have forgotten much
and these words are only a poor attempt to recall all that
I heard. The voice continued speaking:

&quot;We know your mind is filled with questions. One question
in particular troubles you and it concerns the entity the
world knows as Je--s C-rist. May we set your mind at rest.
In allegorical language Ch-ist is indeed the Son of G-d.
The star that burned over Bethlehem is a cosmic fact. It
announced the birth on your planet of an entity not of
Earth's evol-tion. He is L-rd of the Flame - an infinite
entity of the s-n. Out of compassion for mankind's
suffering He became flesh and b-ood and entered the h-ll
of ignorance, woe and ev-l. As the Su- S-irit who
sacrificed Himself for the children of woe he has become a
part of the overs-ul of mankind and the world sp-rit. In
this He differs from all other world teachers.

&quot;Each person upon Earth has a spir-tual, or unknown, self
which transcends the material world and consciousness and
dwells eternally out of the Time dimension in spirit-al
perfection within the unity of the overs-ul.

Here he talks to his friends about his experiences.

...........................................................
...........................................................

&quot;In the illusion of Time is written man's choice through
free will whereby he set in motion the cause of error which
inevitably resulted in effect, in which mankind entered
mortal consciousness or the living d-ath of his present
existence. Thus was he separated from his eternal and
perfect self. His one purpose upon Earth now is to attain
reunion with his i-mortal consciousness. When this is
accomplished he is resurrected from the kingdom of de-th
and becomes his real im-ortal self made in the image and
likeness of G-d. Your Teacher has told you, Go- is love,
and in these simple words may be found the s-crets of all
the mysteries of Earth and the worlds beyond.&quot;
Tears coursed down my cheeks. Under the s-iritual
scrutiny of that great, compassionate consciousness I felt
like a crawling worm - unclean, filled with error and s-n.
Yes, I say si-, but not in the ordinary sense men use that
word. Rather -in as s-n really is. And basically -in is
hypocricy, falsity, the living l-e! It is looking at your
fellow man with a friendly smile upon your face with
treacherous, malicious, or mocking thoughts in your heart.
Si- is any and all deviations from absolute truth, perfect
love, absolute honesty and righteous motives. Thus actual
si- has little to do with Earthly standards of -in.

As these realizations filled my consciousness I wanted to
fling myself down upon the floor and hide my head in shame
for humanity.
And of all men I at that moment felt the lowliest, the
least worthy to be where I was. I wondered how those great
beings could love such a one as I or any of mankind. We
with our b-oody w-rs, our intense hatreds, our cheap,
shoddy intolerances, our greed and avarice and our cruel
inhumanity to our fellowmen. I hid my head in my hands and
wept bitter tears for a creature so full of error and
hypocrisy and yet so puffed up with egotistical pride over
our little material knowledge.

At that moment, as in a dream, I heard the strains of the
&quot;L-rd's P-ayer&quot;, played as though by thousands of violins.
As I crouched in the chair fresh tears poured from my eyes.
My heart was filled with humility, contrition and with
gratitude - gratitude that these Great Ones had even
considered our miserable selfish existence.

Above the exquisite strains of melody, the voice said:
&quot;Beloved friend of Earth, we b-ptize you now in the true
light of the worlds eternal.&quot;

A blinding w-ite beam flashed from the dome of the craft.
Momentarily I seemed partially to lose consciousness.
Everything expanded into a great shimmering wh-te light. I
seemed to be projected beyond Time and Space and was
conscious only of light, Light, LIGHT! Orfeo, Earth, the
past were as nothing, a dark dream of a moment. And that
dream unfolded before my eyes in swift panorama. Every
event of my life upon Earth was crystal clear to me - and
then memory of all of my p-evious lives upon Earth
returned. IN THAT SUBLIME MOMENT I KNEW THE MYSTERY OF
LIFE! Also, I realized with a terrible certainty that we
are all each one of us TRAPPED IN ETERNITY and ALLOTTED
ONLY ONE BRIEF AWARENESS AT A TIME!

I am dying, I thought. I have been through this dea-h
before in other earthly lives. This is death! Only now I am
in ETERNITY, WITHOUT BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END. Then slowly
everything resolved into radiant light, peace and
indescribable beauty. Free of all falsity of mortality I
drifted in a timeless sea of bliss.

At last, as from a vivid dream, I regained consciousness.
Dazedly, I looked about the interior of the craft.
Everything was the same, but it seemed ten thousand years
had passed in what must have been only a few moments. I
was half conscious of a burning sensation on my left
side just below the heart, but I thought nothing of it
then.

E-hereal drifts of music were in the air. Far away, I
could feel, more than hear, a pulsing vibration beneath
the floor of the craft.
Also, I was again aware of the gentle push of my body
against the cushioned chair. I realized I was being taken
back to Earth.

In an incredibly short time the wall opened and I saw the
familiar surroundings. Yes, I knew I was home again. But I
also realized a little sadly that Earth could never again
really be my home. In the sp-ritual e-olution of mankind, I
had been expendable in this life.
Thus had I passed through dea-h and attained infinite
life.

As I got up from the comfortable chair, I reached down
and picked up the strange, shining bit of metal and carried
it in my hand as I left the craft. In a kind of daze I
walked away from the ship; then curiously turned to look at
it from the outside once more. But it was gone! I looked
up and there it was high in the sky, faintly visible
as a fuzzy luminous bubble. Then suddenly it was not there
at all; but high in the northeastern sky I saw a red,
glowing disk which changed to green and vanished.

I glanced down at the round bit of strange metal in my
hand. It was glowing and livid again and appeared almost to
be alive as it quivered in contact with my flesh. Also, it
was rapidly diminishing in size. By the time I had reached
home it had dissipated into nothingness.

As I was undressing to go to bed, I remembered again the
burning sensation I had felt on my left side while I was
undergoing the profound &quot;initiation&quot; in the saucer. I
glanced down and saw what appeared to be a circular &quot;burn&quot;
about the size of a quarter on my left side directly below
my heart. The outer rim of the circle was red, inflamed and
slightly raised as also was a small dot in the center of
the circle - the symbol of the hydrogen atom. I realized
they had impressed that mark upon my body to convince me
beyond all doubt of the reality of my experiences in the
cold light of the coming days.

CHAPTER 3

MY MEETING WITH NEPTUNE

Following the emotional shock of that profound and
bewildering trip in the saucer, I went about in a veritable
daze for weeks. I continued on the job at Lockheed and
resumed the routine of my daily affairs; but I was like an
automaton - a dweller in two worlds and at home in neither.
It is almost impossible to explain my state of mind. But
the great spir-tual il-umination I had received in the
saucer left me something of a stranger to my own planet,
Earth.

I longed to tell the world, to blazen out the truths of
my discoveries; yet I knew that for the greater part I must
forever remain silent. Among other glimpses of reality, I attained the
realization that TIME IS NONEXISTENT. What we call Time exists only
in the physical worlds and is an illusion of the senses. Also, I know
now that our concept of space is entirely erroneous. But who could I
convince of these and other truths - who would believe me?

But because THEY had requested that I tell Earthlings of my
experiences, I told many persons about my trip in the flying saucer.
Nearly everyone laughed and ridiculed me. I was the butt of numerous
jokes. Someone was always wise-cracking: &quot;Are your saucer pals going
to show up tonight, Orfeo?&quot; Or: &quot;Tell one of the saucers to land over
at the Drive-In theatre, Angie, and then we'll all believe it!&quot; Such
remarks invariably brought forth gales of laughter at my expense. But
I no longer cared - I KNEW, and that was enough!

As my story got around, several newspapers printed derisive accounts
of &quot;The Saucer Man&quot;. It cut deeply to see the embarrassment and
humiliation it all caused my two sons. They knew people were saying
their father was a &quot;screwball&quot;. They didn't want to go to school
because their companions laughed at them. I knew it all hurt Mabel
too. Mabel pleaded with me to forget my experiences. I tried to
explain to her why I had to tell about them, and we had some bitter
misunderstandings on the subject.

I wanted so much to do something constructive, but I didn't know how
to go about it. I began calling various m-litary and defense offices.
The personnel of several of the smaller ones laughed openly and
passed me off, I know, as a crackpot. But it was with tremendous
relief I found the really important offices referred me to men who
were genuinely interested. They questioned and crossquestioned me
concerning the information I gave them.

A little later I began giving weekly talks to small groups of
interested people about space visitors. At first these meetings were
held in private homes and then as the attendance increased we met in
the Los Feliz Club House.

In what little spare time I had I began writing down my experiences
and planned to publish them in a small newssheet, for I believed I
could reach more people that way.

But as the days and weeks passed following my fantastic trip in the
saucer and nothing more happened, I began to feel a little uncertain.
The constant ridicule and laughter created even more doubts. My
insistence upon the absolute truth of my experiences finally appeared
to be definitely alienating my friends and even my family. My story
was unbelieved upon Earth and the mysterious visitors were doing
nothing to aid me. I actually began to doubt my own sanity, to wonder
if the bizzare experiences had been an illusion or hallucination of
some sort. And yet an inner tribunal of Truth assured me that such
was not the case for WITH THEM I HAD SEEN AND KNOWN REALITY - and I
could never forget that.

Here he meets a spaceman who was speaking to him before
but he hadn't seen before, as of yet.

...........................................................
...........................................................

On the night of August 2nd I and Mabel were helping out
at the Los Feliz Drive-In theatre snack bar. About 11
o'clock I went outside for a breath of fresh air. Over the
hills to the west I noticed a fuzzy green light apparently
hanging suspended in the sky. I watched it for several
moments, then went inside and called Mabel and seven or
eight others to come out and see it. All of them saw the
mysterious light hanging motionless in the sky over the
hill. Unable to explain it, some of them declared it must
be a helicopter hovering in the air. Others thought it
might be a high street lamp of some sort.

But when after three or four minutes the &quot;street lamp&quot;
climbed slowly and silently into the h-avens and suddenly
vanished, no one had much to say. But for some perverse
reason none of them wanted to admit that it was actually a
flying saucer.

As they trouped back into the cafe laughing about &quot;Orfeo
and his flying saucers&quot;, a depressing wave of
discouragement passed over me.
It was useless - absolutely useless - to talk to anyone
about the saucers or my experiences. Feeling greatly
disheartened and vey much alone, I decided to leave and
walk home.

As I cut across the vacant lots the Hyperion Avenue
Freeway Bridge loomed huge and dark ahead of me. The sky
was overcast and the dense, oblique shadows from the vast
concrete structure were heavier and more eerie than usual.
Yet in the shadows of the dark archways of the bridge I had
come to feel a kind of warmth and welcome, a s-iritual
communion with a vastly greater and more kindly world. For
it was in the shadows of the huge bridge that I had come
upon the saucer which had carried me out of this world.

I was thinking of these things when I suddenly became
aware of someone approaching from out of the darkness. I
was startled for I'd never before met anyone taking the
short-cut beneath the bridge so late at night. I was about
to call out a word of greeting when it dawned upon me that
the stranger was coming from the dead end of the bridge. My
first thought was that someone was lying in wait for me,
possibly to rob me. But before I could become alarmed, I
heard the stranger call: &quot;Greetings, Orfeo!&quot;

My heart almost stopped beating, for immediately I
recognized the vibrant, beautiful voice of the being who
had spoken to me in the saucer.

I stopped in my tracks, utterly speechless, and stared at
the approaching figure. But then a wave of joy and
gratitude flooded over me, and I finally replied
falteringly: &quot;Greetings ... to you . . .&quot;

He laughed pleasantly. &quot;I know that in your mind you have
given me a name - I who have remained nameless to you,&quot; he
said gently. &quot;You may call me by that name, Orfeo - it is
as good as any other and has more inner significance to you
than any name I might give you.&quot;

&quot;Neptune . . .&quot; I spoke the name slowly and reverently.
For it was indeed the name I had given to this great and
mysterious being. Then I added: &quot;At last you have come to
give me strength and f-ith.&quot;

He was near enough then for me to see that he was several
inches taller than I and similar in outline to a well-built
man. But the shadows were so heavy that I couldn't make out
the details of his figure. But just to be in his presence
once more was to sense again a tremendous uplifting wave of
strength, harmony, joy and serenity.

&quot;Come, Orfeo,&quot; he said gently, continuing on past me. &quot;We
have many things to discuss tonight.&quot;

I followed him as he strode ahead of me through the dense
shadows. I could hear his solid footsteps upon the
gravelled path which convinced me beyond the shadow of a
doubt that he was no phantom or illusion.

He led me to a better lighted area near the bend of
Glendale Boulevard where it goes up and over the bridge. I
was actually trembling in anticipation of my first actual
look at the mysterious visitor from another world.

When he turned I saw his face, the same wonderful,
expressive countenance I had seen on the luminous screen. I
again noticed especially his extremely large, dark and
expressive eyes and nobility and beauty of his features
which actually seemed to radiate warmth and kindliness.

Then I noticed that he was wearing a kind of uniform,
bluish in color, perfectly tailored and tightly fitted to
the outlines of his body. But it was apparently without
seams, buttons, pockets, trimmings or design of any sort.
In fact it fitted so perfectly that it was almost like a
part of his body.

But as I studied him I became aware of an astonishing
phenomenon: I could see his uniform and figure clearly,
but it wavered occasionally, as though I were viewing it
through rippling water. And the color did not remain solid
and uniform, but varied and changed in spots, which
reminded me of an imperfectly tuned television set. Only
his face and hands remained immobile and stable as though
not partially obscured by a film of rippling water.
Headlights from approaching automobiles fell upon us from
time to time and I remember wondering what manner of being
my companion appeared to be to those in the passing cars.
Did they see him at all?  If so, did he appear as solid and
substantial as myself?

He moved forward again, motioning for me to follow him.
Without speaking he led me down the sharp concrete
declivity into the bed of the dry Los Angeles River. There
he sat down upon a large stone and motioned for me to do
likewise.

For a time he was silent and I was acutely conscious of a
tremendous vibrational field about him; a tangible
emanation of serenity, brotherly love, and ineffable joy.

At last he said: &quot;You sense and understand intuitively
many things I cannot say directly to you, Orfeo. You have
just fully realized that we are not like earthmen in that
we function in dimensions unknown to your world. Earth is a
three-dimensional world and because of this it is
preponderantly false. I may tell you that to the entities
of certain other worlds Earth is regarded as 'the accursed
planet', the 'home of the the reprobate, fallen ones'.
Others call your Earth 'the home of sorrows'. For Earth's
e-olution is ev-lution through pain, sorrow, s-n, suffering
and the illusion of physical d-ath. Believe me, all
evo-utions are not similar to Earth's, despite the present
beliefs of your scientists.&quot;
As I heard these strange words, my heart and mind cried
out: &quot;But why must it be so? Why should Earth's people know
pain, suffering and d-ath?&quot;

He looked up into the h-avens and in the soft light I saw
deep compassion in his face as he said slowly: &quot;The answer
to that question is one of the mysteries of the illusion of
Time. But I can tell you this: such conditions did not
always prevail among the entities who now inhabit Earth.
Once there was another planet in your solar system, the
fairest and most radiant of all the planets. That planet
was the original home of Earthlings. In their native home
they knew no pain, sorrow, suffering, sickness or de-th.
But in the glory and wonder of their world they grew proud
and arrogant. They made w-r among themselves and finally
turned against the Great Giver of Life.
Ultimately they destroyed their own planet which today
exists only as a sterile and barren ring of asteriods and
debris in the solar system. In order that those entities
might gain understanding, compassion and brotherly love
they were born into the animalistic, material evolu-ion of
a lesser planet, Earth. Suffering, sorrow, frustration and
dea-h became their teacher. Their symbol became the
Man-Beast. Each man must work out his own destiny and
salvation. In the illusion of Time and through repeated
births and de-ths each entity slowly and painfully e-olves
s-iritually toward its former glorified state of d-vinity.
Eventually all the entities of Earth will again attain
their lost heritage. They will have learned
understanding, compassion and true love for G-d and their
fellows.&quot;

I pondered his strange words thoughtfully, thinking as I
did so that what he had said explained many apparent
mysteries about man and his lot upon Earth. But soon my
attention was distracted once more as I saw the figure of
Neptune strangely &quot;waver&quot; again. Suddenly the question was
in my mind: &quot;Was he really there in the truest physical
sense, or was he an immaterial projection into the physical
world from another dimension? Did I see him in his true
form and ordinary state of being, or merely a projected
approximation of a man's appearance?&quot; These strange
thoughts frightened me a little and carried me into too
deep waters.

A reassuring smile lighted his face. &quot;Don't be alarmed,
Orfeo. The answer to the troublesome question in your mind
is both yes and no.
On Earth form, color, individuality and the material
aspect of things is all-important. In our world these
illusions are of practically no importance at all. Suffice
to say that for you I am an approximation of myself as I
really am. I can't make it any clearer in three-dimensional
terms.&quot;
