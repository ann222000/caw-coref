Its a quiet little deck, but I'm worried it doesn't push forward hard
enough

Deck: Godmother knows best
Author: John Best

Crypt:

4 x Teresita, the Godmother (7)
2 x Kazimir Savostin (7)
2 x Ingram Frizer (6)
1 x Christaneous Lionel (6)
1 x Kendrick (7)
2 x Beast, the leatherface of Detroit (7)

Av 6.75

Library (90)

Masters (18)

2 x Shakar
1 x Powerbase Baranquilla
4 x Blood Doll
1 x Shanty town hunting ground
1 x Nosferatu Kingdon
1 x Club Zombie
1 x KRCG news radio
1 x Vox Domini
1 x Cadet
1 x Secret horde
1 x The barrens
1 x Obfuscate
2 x Watchtower: four ride forth

Actions (6)

2 x Blooding
2 x Tattoo Signal
2 x Vermin channel

Action modifiers (18)

4 x Mask of 1000 faces
5 x Spying mission
4 x Faceless night
5 x Swallowed by the night

Combat (16)

6 x Thrown gate
3 x Taste of vitae
5 x Pushing the limit
2 x disarm

Allies / Retainers (10)

3 x Marijava Thuggee
1 x Gregory Winter
2 x courier
1 x vagabond mystic
3 x raven spy

Equipment (2)

2 x Leather jacket

Reactions (20)

3 x Guard dogs
3 x WWEF
2 x Cat's guidance
8 x Truth in ink
4 x Pack tactics

Blackhand tech is used for untaps, and bleed reduction, thugs are
there for multitude of small bleeds, and along with courier, to just
be irratating. Potence is there in case I get caught, and along with
shakar and beast, in case I need to move across table.

I'm thinking of dropping the mystic, and maybe KRCG for either more
strikes, or increased strength, or for a couple of armies of rats.

I don't know that Kazimir is that good of an idea--maybe swap him out
for a 5th Teresita (who is teh awsome) and a 3rd Ingram?

You are going to have a lot of trouble protecting this. Probably not
worth it.

Not a good card. Like, ever. Ok, Jay Krystoff seems to include it in a
lot of decks, and he does well, but I don't know if he ver actually
plays the card. If you want an expensive card that acts like a hunting
ground, use Weeping Stone (which always works in both capacities, not
just one or the other). If you want extra intercept, use Channel X or
something. Playng this card is just a gift to your predator.

1 Cadet isn't so good. You aren't going to have it when you need it

Secret Horde is really only good as funny Parity Shift tech.
Especially with 18 Master cards. Replace with another Blood Doll or a
Minion Tap or something.

Vermin Channel might work pretty well with the Spying Missions--maybe
get more Spying Missions in there for extra ousting momentum?

The Masks are a bit questionable--they are good for tricksie decks,
but not so much in a general sense. They'd be better off as more
Spying Missions or even some Lost in Crowds.

Reasonable, but not overwhelming--you might consider turning a couple
Thrown Gates into Stunt Bikes to help against people with Guns. Or
Breath of the Dargon. Or Ivory Bows.

Courier is a bit unecessary here--the Thugees are pretty good. The
Couriers are really only worth the effort if you are going to abuse
their discard ability. Vagabond Mystic is also probably unecesary.
Maybe turn all three of them into more Raven Spies?

The Pack Tactics should probably be Ministry (unconditional +2
intercept for 1 blod instead of conditional +2 intercept for 1 blood).
Wakes could be On the Qui just as well, but not really a necessary
swap.

Yeah, it is.

It isn't supposed to be rush combat, I've tried to make it a bit jack
of all trades, but suspect it's master of none at this point.

Basically, the deck has a midway point in play. Initially, the vamps
do everything, bleeding at a little bit of stealth, intercept, bleed
reduction etc. At the point at which the Thuggees etc start coming out
they take over the bleed, freeing up the vamps to have a more wide
role, bleeding, but more likely intercept/slapdown. The extra untaps
from the tattoo signals, and watchtower mean they have even more
freedom.

I'm concerned it doesn't pressure its prey enough, however. With 3
blackhand vamps and 3 thuggees that's a potential 6 bleed a turn, with
maybe a couple of  untaps for defence, but it never seems to turn the
potential into reality. I guess I should be satisfied that it never
draws any hate, but I'm trying to make it more &quot;competitive&quot;.

I'd suggest 4-8 Computer Hacking/Bloodwork/Fiendish Tongue. Constant
pressure of up to 6 bleed per turn is good for whittling down your
prey, but once they're in ousting range they'll get real defensive.
Some extra bleed for the lunge can help punch through that last pool.

Mask shows up in a lot my decks if I have any OBF stealth cards at

it because it can be, basically, +1 stealth for most actions, but can

You've only got three Thugs in the entire library, so the chances of
having three Thugs in play at once is quite small. Adding more Thugs
would seem to be the obvious solution.

Maybe--I'm yet to be impressed (and by &quot;yet&quot;, I mean &quot;over the last 12
years...&quot;) by Mask1K tricksiness. Yeah, it often is just +1 stealth, but
most of the time, that is all it is, and it could be +2 stealth instead.
I mean, yeah, once and a while, you go do something with a spud, he'll
get blocked, and, like, Beast will mask in or something, and you
surprisingly vaporize someone or something, but mostly, well, if it had
been a Lost in Crowds, your first action would have succeeded, and Beast
could go kill someone anyway.

Again, like, a couple is rarely going to hurt you, and once and a while
will impress your friends and amaze your enemies, but mostly, well, I'd
rather have a more utilitarian stealth card.

Courrier isn't really getting you any extra information. Am I missing
something? He makes someone discard a card off their deck when a bleed
gets through. So, at worst, he is 2 blood for a fragile, 1 card,
conditional Slaughterhouse. Which is also the bast case scenario, come
to think of it. I mean, yeah, ok, not horrible. But not a huge benefit,
and in a deck that is kinda all over the place already (which the one in
question was), probably best to take out the Courriers for something
more generally useful.

Meh. I mean, yeah, it never hurts to know what card is on the top of

First, you can talk about the relative worth of blood vs. pool and
minion action vs. master cards; steam tunnels is &quot;free&quot; in the blood/
pool sense, but it is going to cost you a precious master phase
action.  But the real distinction is that Steam Tunnels doesn't let
you burn a card you don't like.  If all courier did was let you peak
then, sure, probably not worth a minion action.  But I think we all
agree that Le Din Tho is pretty hot, and this is a similar sort of
thing.  And then, like somebody else said, there's the fact that
courier is a nerd who can bleed, and doesn't cost pool to get.

Oh, and then there's the fact that they stack.  That's when pairing
them up *with* the Steam Tunnels gets really hot: look at the top
three, tap couriers to pop as desired.  You don't seem to like the one
card slot cost of a single courier so you probably won't like this
either, but a 4 card module of 3 couriers, 1 steam tunnel, isn't a bad
little tool to avail yourself of, if you're playing !Nos anyway.

But the Courier is a &quot;generally good card&quot;, for the reasons given.

Damn, I'm off to chuck together a !Nos deck!

&gt;&gt; Meh. I mean, yeah, it never hurts to know what card is on the top of

&gt;&gt; but for free instead of 2 blood and an MPA instead of a recruit action.
&gt;&gt; And I'm not seeing that get that much play.

&gt; First, you can talk about the relative worth of blood vs. pool and
&gt; minion action vs. master cards; steam tunnels is &quot;free&quot; in the blood/
&gt; pool sense, but it is going to cost you a precious master phase
&gt; action.  But the real distinction is that Steam Tunnels doesn't let
&gt; you burn a card you don't like.  If all courier did was let you peak
&gt; then, sure, probably not worth a minion action.  But I think we all
&gt; agree that Le Din Tho is pretty hot, and this is a similar sort of
&gt; thing.  And then, like somebody else said, there's the fact that
&gt; courier is a nerd who can bleed, and doesn't cost pool to get.

&gt; Oh, and then there's the fact that they stack.  That's when pairing
&gt; them up *with* the Steam Tunnels gets really hot: look at the top
&gt; three, tap couriers to pop as desired.  You don't seem to like the one
&gt; card slot cost of a single courier so you probably won't like this
&gt; either, but a 4 card module of 3 couriers, 1 steam tunnel, isn't a bad
&gt; little tool to avail yourself of, if you're playing !Nos anyway.

&gt;&gt; I mean, again, yeah, it never hurts to have a bit of extra info. But
&gt;&gt; unless you are going to do something specific with it, it is unlikely to
&gt;&gt; be better than just, like, having a generally good card in your deck
&gt;&gt; instead of the Courier.

&gt; But the Courier is a &quot;generally good card&quot;, for the reasons given.

&gt; Damn, I'm off to chuck together a !Nos deck!

Nice analysis - I think I will add that micro-module to my Vermin

Still unconvinced. I mean, yeah, everything you say about the Courier is
true in an abstract sense, but as you need to be playing the !Nosferatu
to use them, you are saddled with the fact that you are playing the
!Nosferatu who generally have to make every action count to be
competitive. And recruiting a possibly useful Courier isn't so much
making every action count.

I have had reasonable success with Couriers in decks that were designed
to use Couriers (a &quot;get out 15 Couriers and deck your prey&quot; deck which
was entertaining and moderately effective; a ghouled Couriers bleed a
lot and try and survive with Thrown Gates deck that was entertaining and
moderately effective). But as a sideline, not seeing it so much be that
useful.

Heck--I'd probably rather use Tortured Confessions in most decks
instead...

Well I just built one this morning, right after I posted that.  After
just browsing the vampires, I went from the low end up, topping out at
2 Beasts and a Kendrick.  Their midcaps seem really good, I mean there
are at least 4 decent ones I'd be happy to hit the early game with.
That still leaves 4 or 5 chumps.  So, at least compared to the kinds
of decks I'm usually playing with, it felt comfortably actiony.

Sure--but what is the deck actually doing to oust folks? (I'm not
saying it can't--just wanna know what it does :-)

And is the Courier in there actually helping with that?

8 Fiendish Tongues, 6 Bum's Rush, Fame, 2 Laptops.  Hey, I'm not
saying it's Tier 1, but I also don't think the Courier is here or
there on that issue.  I mean, if I dropped the Couriers and made it 3
more copies of Hack, Grapple, or whatever, I doubt it would radically
improve the deck's competitiveness.

Well, Cicatriz' discard special (if I've got the right guy from
memory) isn't &quot;helping oust folks&quot; directly, but I would say it helps
the deck overall.  Likewise, when I pop a Blood Doll or Minion Tap, or
really any number of other things, I'd say it's helping the deck,
too.

Well thanks, glad you liked it.  But what really got me replying was
the &quot;module&quot; comment.  It just reminded me of a few years ago when
&quot;modules&quot; was sort of something that got kicked around.  I first
remember reading about them in Ethan's !Tor newsletters, and then I
started working on them from the Assamite angle (+1 Str/CEL modules,
long range combat modules, anit-weenie event modules, etc).  Of course
those all went *poof* with the Path of Blood, but it seemed like a

Presence forum has a &quot;killer combos and modules&quot; section.

http://presence.vekn.org/viewforum.php?f=20&amp;sid;=0e83c436d40cabb88dda3...

It's mostly devoted to clans with Presence, but I seem to see lots of
modules that are not presence based on there.

Yeah, see, this is where I see the deck getting killed--not much pool
gain, not much Rush (although Beast certainly helps), not enough combat
to reliably kill, like, Arika as soon as she hits the table. Kinda
toolboxy, not much solid defense. Which is what a lot of Nosferatu decks
look like due to their discipline spread, and in my really deep
experience with the Nosferatu, it usually just gets them killed.

I mean, maybe I'm just a bad player, but whenever I play decks like
this, I just get killed a lot. I do well with the Nosferatu, sure, but
usually only by being really extreme (extreme combat; extreme defense;
extreme politics). I find having decks that have some combat and some
bleed and some intercept and a few allies and some untap and a few blood
dolls to be, well, not real effective in the long run. But again, me.

Because that's what the deck came out to be.  I was aiming for 80, hit

I wouldn't try to take this deck to the NAC, dude.  But I'd plop it
down (and intend to) at one of my weekly games and feel like I had a
decent shot.  Metagames and all that.

(Although it did cross my mind that, with the Carrion Crows and Murder
of Crows, and decent access to 1 intercept and untap, it wouldn't do
too badly next to an Imbued deck).

Not sure why, but after looking over the decklist, Pentex(TM) Loves
You! jumped into my mind. It's pricey at 2 Pool, but it would set you
up nicely to punch bleeds if/when you get a Laptop out, have a few
Fiendish Tongues in your ash heap making your prey suspect more, and
the Tunnels/Courier combo has been wiping the flick off the top of the
deck. Bleeds for three induce more combat, too.
