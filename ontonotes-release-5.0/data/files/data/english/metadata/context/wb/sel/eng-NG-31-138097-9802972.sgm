Foot off the gas pedal

For a regime that has made much of seeking long-term solutions to the country's growing energy needs, the lack of urgency so patently on display on the
Iran gas pipeline front is shocking. It has been three years now since the Union Cabinet authorised the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to begin
negotiations with Islamabad and Tehran for the construction of a 2,700 km pipeline running from Iran's South Pars gas fields to India via Pakistan. In
the interve ning period, India's negotiators have done an admirable job of sorting through the enormous technical, financial, and even political complexities
the project will entail. What they have not been able to do is get the ghost of the Indo-U.S. nuclear agreement off their backs. The Bush administration
and many American legislators are strongly opposed to India entering into any long-term energy arrangements with Iran. On several occasions, attempts have
been made to link the smooth passage of the Indo-U.S. nuclear agreement with New Delhi accepting Washington's line on the Islamic Republic - and invariably
the United Progressive Alliance government has blinked. Despite this, major issues such as project structure and the gas pricing formula have more or less
been settled, leaving only the question of transit fees for Pakistan to be negotiated. Initially, it was reported that Minister for Petroleum and Natural
Gas Murli Deora would travel to Pakistan to resolve this question, following which the three countries would meet in Tehran in mid-February to finalise
the overall project. Now, however, a decision has been taken at the highest levels to defer this trip till after the Pakistani general election.

On the face of it, the logic of the latest deferment is unexceptional; but when one considers the fact that India has stayed away from all trilateral meetings
on the pipeline for nearly six months, it does seem that the Prime Minister's faint-hearted advisors are once again nervous about incurring the Bush administration's
wrath. For those set against the pipeline, delaying the project is a better way of killing it than abruptly terminating the talks. The irony is that a
country of India's size and clout should have the diplomatic skill to open the door to nuclear cooperation with the world even as it develops deeper energy
relations with Iran. Besides, every year of delay costs the nation's economy dearly since oil prices are rising relentlessly. It is nothing short of akratic
that the 'strategic autonomy' of external relations - a concept the Prime Minister has been speaking about - should be allowed to get eroded in this way
at a time when the 123 agreement looks virtually dead. The Prime Minister needs to change course and authorise his negotiators swiftly to finalise all
pending arrangements.

For transparent carbon trading

Global carbon trading has gained momentum. The Worldwatch Institute, drawing from various studies, places the total value of the trade in 2007 at $59.2
billion, an 80 per cent increase over 2006. As the 2012 deadline for reducing emission levels approaches, the volume of carbon trading will be enormous.
Asian countries are the biggest sellers and western countries the biggest buyers. A World Bank report on the 2007 carbon market shows that China has a
market share of 61 pe r cent and India 12 per cent. The Government of India, as a part of its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, set up in 2003 a National
Clean Development Mechanism Authority, which has been reviewing proposals for carbon credits. However, the final credits are issued by the Executive Board
of the Clean Development Mechanism at the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC). India has garnered 35 million of the 102 million
Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) issued up to January 2008.

This augurs well for the country and its entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, a few issues surface time and again to remind us how the system can be improved. The
pricing of CERs has become a major issue. Studies by groups such as the Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi and by the New Zealand government
on CER pricing have highlighted the lack of transparency. This hinders the just distribution of benefits and paves the way for manipulation. The data available
indicate that the price of CERs ranges from $11 to $22 and naturally such wide variation raises troubling questions. Arguments for lower prices emphasise
scale, risk, and delay in delivery of CERs as determining factors. However, the sellers who bear the burden of investment and delivery should be able to
reap the benefits of better prices where they exist. Information on prevailing prices should be easily and freely available. This becomes important in
the context of calls for including community projects in the carbon trade. Whether transparency can be imposed through a regulatory authority or by an
alternative method needs to be discussed and quickly settled. Reducing emissions at source is the best option but until that is achieved a regulated carbon
market is a necessity. For India, there is yet another issue. To their credit, private entrepreneurs predominate in the list of projects approved by UNFCCC.
Government projects and the public sector, which have not shown any serious interest in accumulating CERs, need to be prodded to follow their example.

Mumbai: The glory days of the Raj?

P. Sainath

Arresting Raj Thackeray might work well for both him and the Congress. But the larger canvas of Mumbai's problems is getting obscured.

&quot;When will Raj Thackeray be arrested?&quot; The filing of charges against the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader has revived the question. It might be the
wrong one but it did grab much media time some days ago. It then morphed into &quot;Why hasn't he been arrested?&quot; There were also reports that &quot;the government
has gathered the evidence&quot; and might strike at any time. And of course the television talk shows on who is an outsider - and the cosmopolitan character
of Mumbai, and the rest of it. All this followed some attacks on north Indians. Mostly on taxi drivers, who work alone and were helpless against MNS mobs.

The filing of charges has revived the 'arrest' story - which was otherwise losing ground to Munnabhai's &quot;tying the knot&quot; once again. Raj Thackeray has been
charged with provocation with intent to cause riots, dividing people on the basis of place of birth, etc., and the rest of it. The police have also barred
him from holding press conferences or public meetings till February 25. And there are police vans outside his house this moment. So when will he be arrested?

A more useful question might be: &quot;Why is Raj Thackeray trying so hard to get himself arrested? What are his objectives - and how are they working out?&quot;
Even a token arrest could greatly further his aims. (And by the way, help the Congress, too.) If it hasn't happened so far, it's not for want of his trying.

Faced with similar situations involving Bal Thackeray during the past 25 years, all Maharashtra governments have displayed the same weak-knee syndrome.
The present one has worked itself into a corner where, arrest or no arrest, the MNS leader gains where he wants to. If not arrested he gains in stature
with the Sena's core constituency, just as his uncle once did. If arrested, he might well refuse bail, placing the government in a fix. And sparking off
violence on the streets. Besides, the polls being not too far off adds to this heady logic.

On one count, Raj Thackeray has already scored. The main Shiv Sena is in a bind. Even as it mocks his 'antics,' it feels compelled to reiterate that it,
and not he, is the defender of the Marathi people of Mumbai. Uddhav Thackeray has warned that the new airport project had better hire Marathi people only,
or else .

Sena leaders worry that Raj might have touched a chord amongst their younger cadres. On the one hand, they need to broaden their base to play for bigger
stakes. On the other, they have to keep their existing one intact in a time of growing distress amongst the less privileged. Meanwhile, each new MNS move
adds to the pressure. Like not inviting English and Hindi channels to its press conference, but only Marathi ones. That's laced with a symbolism the Sena
knows and understands well.

Even more embarrassing, while the Sena cannot condemn the attacks on north Indians, its top leader came out in defence of one north Indian. Just the one.
To wit: Amitabh Bachchan. And if Raj is indeed arrested, the symbolism would be complete. In this phase, at least.

It is another matter entirely that the Raj-Uddhav rivalry unfolds as a small play on a big stage. But in the battle for the Sena's soul - if such exists
- it is an important drama. It also has vital sideshows. Raj might just about have gifted Mumbai's north Indian votes to the Congress. The BJP which had
a large chunk of those votes will be the loser. In turn, that would also put pressure on the Sena-BJP alliance, thus hurting the Sena in two ways. In short,
an arrest could work out well for both Raj and the Congress at these levels.

That Mumbai has changed is a cliché. Reading that change means more than just counting migrants. It also means, for instance, looking at what people are
migrating to and for. As Maharashtra moved from a manufacturing capital base to a speculative capital base in the 1980s and '90s, the world of its working
poor transformed. What we now have is a struggle for survival at the bottom. A contest of the less privileged within the unorganised sector. A pitting
of poor against poor or less well off - whether Marathi or Oriya migrant - in a battle for meagre resources. So it is, across the nation. And so it happens
locally, too. Except that Mumbai's scale is huge. Though it is not just Mumbai people go to. Many migrants now push towards smaller cities and towns as
well.

The numbers of industrial worker jobs in Mumbai declined steadily

Welcome to country

Yesterday, the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd stood up in the Federal Parliament in Canberra and, speaking in its name, made a moving national apology
to the indigenous peoples of Australia, &quot;the oldest continuing cultures in human history.&quot; He specifically apologised to the Stolen Generations, those
Aboriginal or First Australian children who, born of liaisons between white men - mainly - and Aboriginal women, were forcibly moved from their A boriginal
families to white-run state hostels, church institutions, and white family homes. This racist 'assimilation' lasted from 1910 to 1970. Most of the Stolen
Generation, including Torres Strait Islanders, were sexually and otherwise abused for years; were forced into unskilled drudgery; received little or no
education; and suffered severe permanent psychological damage. Unsurprisingly, government lawyers under Australia's previous regime resisted the Stolen
Generations' claims for compensation, contending that the children were removed for their own good. Mr. Rudd deserves commendation for this significant
act of moral justice and inclusive symbolism. His statement was preceded by an Ngambri ceremony welcoming Australia's elected representatives 'to country'
- a reminder that the very place where the Australian Parliament stands was stolen from its first inhabitants.

In contrast, Mr. Rudd's predecessor, John Howard, refused even to acknowledge the wrongs done to First Australians since European explorers and colonisers
landed on the Australian continent early in the 17th century. The crimes include genocide, the extermination of Tasmania's indigenous people. Since then,
the other Aborigines have been victims of brutal racism, neglect, and exploitation; there are huge discrepancies between the life expectancy, educational
achievement, health, and employment prospects of white Australians and those of First Australians. Even in supporting the apology, the opposition leader
Brendan Nelson provoked fury by saying that the present generation should not feel guilt for things done mainly with 'the best intentions.' Mr. Rudd, however,
calls for a future which embraces all Australians. The issues go far beyond that of compensation for the Stolen Generations, worthy though that cause be.
Australia as a nation will be immeasurably strengthened if it can demonstrate sustained political will and deliver justice and reconciliation to all First
Australians - by ending racial discrimination in education, health care, criminal justice, and every other area of public life.

Fighting terrorism

Over the past fortnight, India's intelligence and police services have demonstrated that they possess the commitment needed to combat transnational terror
networks. By dismantling a joint Harkat ul-Jihad-e-Islami-Students Islamic Movement of India cell planning attacks on tourists in Goa, and locating a Lashkar-e-Taiba
unit responsible for deadly strikes at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore and a Central Reserve Police Force camp in Rampur, they have shown
a sometimes despairing public that terrorism can be stopped in its tracks. Good policing, however, can only be a part of a successful response. Two other
challenges must be addressed - one external, the other internal. Much Indian doctrine has been predicated on the assumption that General Pervez Musharraf's
regime would, under pressure from the United States, deliver on its repeated promises to end terrorism directed at India. Yet the Lashkar and HuJI-SIMI
modules relied on personnel trained in Pakistan, and were funded by organisations based there. Since this fits into the well-established pattern of terrorist
modules operating against India, it is reasonable to infer that President Musharraf lacks either the resources or the resolve to deliver on his word. New
Delhi needs to deal with the problem carefully - without detriment to the process of détente.

Even more important are the internal political challenges India's counter-terrorism efforts need to overcome. The Lashkar cell responsible for the attacks
in Bangalore and Rampur, and the HuJI-SIMI module targeting Goa, were made up largely of young Indian nationals from urban areas, with some degree of education.
Indian Muslims overwhelmingly find the perverted Islam propagated by organisations like the Lashkar - the jihadist call for a war-without-end against Hindus
and the Indian state - repugnant to their traditions, values, spiritual beliefs, and common sense. In turn, some Islamist groups make no secret of their
belief that followers of popular Islam are apostates. Yet an ideological infrastructure has grown to capitalise on the resentments engendered by decades
of communal violence, hate politics, economic backwardness, and denial of opportunities. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's vision of empowering underprivileged
Muslims by providing them education and economic opportunities is entirely sound. He also knows that such developmental action is a necessary but insufficient
condition for forging a just society. If terrorism and the ideas that feed it are to be effectively combated, political parties and leaders, and civil
society organisations need to do much better than they have done so far to isolate and thwart communalism as a political mobilisation strategy.

Democracy in Pakistan and us

Harish Khare

It is time we disabused ourselves of the American prescriptive insistence that &quot;democracy&quot; ipso facto produces vibrant institutions and yields governmental
efficacy.

The world famous anchorman is in town. A Union Cabinet Minister throws a cosy lunch. Within minutes, it becomes clear that the famous anchorman has an agenda:
Pervez Musharraf simply cannot be relied upon to ensure a free and fair election in Pakistan. The anchorman is willing to pass on tidbits of disparaging
gossip peddled by Western diplomats about President Musharraf. Most of the Indian guests are only too eager to reinforce the visitor's prejudice and resent
a contrarian question whether there is a globally acceptable, one-size-fits-all model of &quot;free and fair&quot; election that can be demanded to be followed in
Pakistan.

On any given day, we in India prefer to feel superior vis-À-vis Pakistan in the matter of &quot;democracy.&quot; Perhaps there are very good reasons - including the
clinching evidence of ruling parties being voted out in 1977, 1980, 1989, 1991, 1996, 1998 and 2004 - for us to feel patronising towards Pakistan and its
botched-up experiments with democracy. But is it necessary for us in India to concede to Washington the role of the match referee in the democratic electoral
game the world over? Why do we seem so willing to overlook all the problems and aggravations caused not long ago by American quibbling about &quot;democracy&quot;
and &quot;human rights&quot; in Jammu and Kashmir?

There can be only two outcomes of the next week's election in Pakistan. Either the pro-Musharraf forces win or the Pakistan People's Party-led opposition
gains. In either scenario, the Americans would want to enlarge their military presence in Pakistan. After all, it does not require any great diplomatic
expertise to understand that the American carping over the &quot;free and fair&quot; election in Pakistan is part of Washington's strategic design: the Musharraf
regime must be kept on its toes, it should be continuously badgered into feeling that its legitimacy ultimately depends on American certificates of good
conduct, and, having been rendered so vulnerable, it should be pressured into letting the American/NATO forces have the run of the Pakistan-Afghan border
in pursuit of the Taliban militants. Hence, the recent spate of news stories as to how the Pakistani security forces are not zealous enough in cooperating
with the Western troops against the Osama bin laden legions, presumably sheltering in the vast inhospitable terrain.

The American-led discourse has already ordained that the only outcome that would meet the standards of &quot;free and fair&quot; election is the one in which the
PPP-led opposition &quot;wins.&quot; In such a post-Musharraf scenario, the &quot;winner&quot; would naturally feel to be under an obligation to work closely with Washington
to get rid of the &quot;militants.&quot; The so-called democratic forces in Pakistan have unquestioningly accepted the Western refrain that Islamabad could do more
to help the good Americans in their crusade against the designated enemies.

We in India, too, have unthinkingly given in to the current American notion that only a &quot;democratic&quot; Pakistan could help the West win the &quot;war on terror.&quot;
In absolute terms, it is a sound proposition that a democratic regime is better equipped in mobilising the populace against the militant/terrorist; also,
in absolute terms, it is a fair and reasonable stipulation that an army general cannot be and ought not to be a preferred alternative to democratic organisations
and civil society. However, it is somewhat naïve for us to put an extraordinary trust in the transformative power of the so-called democratic forces in
Pakistan.

To begin with, as a matter of historical record there is not much to choose between &quot;civilian governments&quot; and &quot;military regimes&quot; in Pakistan when it comes
to an amicable relationship with India. The generals have been as hostile to India as have been the &quot;democratic&quot; rulers. It was during Benzir Bhutto's
premiership that Pakistan openly took it upon itself to give &quot;moral&quot; support to the &quot;independence&quot; struggle in Kashmir, with all-round bloody consequences.
And, it was during Nawaz Sharif's innings that the Kargil misadventure was initiated. It must also be noted that it was the unbridled invocation of a hostile
(Islamic) nationalism by the presumably civilian regimes that fostered and then legitimised the Hindutva Right in India.

Of course, it is entirely natural that we in India should prefer a &quot;democratic&quot; Pakistan to a military-ruled one; yet is it necessary for us to be so totally
blind to the realities in

Upholding the rule of law

In arresting Raj Thackeray, the leader of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, whose incendiary and chauvinist politics has unleashed violence against ordinary
citizens on the streets of Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra, the ruling Congress-Nationalist Congress Party coalition has shown exemplary resolve
in enforcing the rule of law. The descent into an atavistic display of regional chauvinism was the outcome of a cynical attempt by the estranged nephew
of Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray to retain his ebbing political relevance. The State government proceeded carefully in the matter of effecting the arrests
of the MNS leader and the Samajwadi Party leader, Abu Azmi - to ensure that Mr. Thackeray's followers, already on a course of intimidatory and destructive
violence directed at terrified North Indian migrants, would not be allowed to disturb the peace further. By deploying large numbers of police on the streets
and rounding up most of the anti-social supporters of the MNS, the Maharashtra government led by Vilasrao Deshmukh signalled its determination not to allow
the retrograde forces of regional chauvinism to take the upper hand and overwhelm the decades of cosmopolitan and pluralist coexistence that has made Mumbai
one of the world's truly great cities. The government was clearly mindful of the sense of national outrage at the violation of one of the fundamental rights
of Indian citizens, implicit in Mr. Thackeray's subversive challenge. Article 19(1)(d) of the Constitution guarantees citizens of India the right &quot;to move
freely throughout the territory of India&quot; and Article 19(1)(e) &quot;to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India.&quot; Deputy Chief Minister R.R
Patil did well to assert, in the face of the challenge, that the rule of law would prevail and that &quot;you cannot change the law or the Constitution by burning
a rickshaw or stoning a bus.&quot;

A heartening aspect of this episode was that all major political parties hastened to distance themselves from this chauvinist binge. The BJP, which partners
the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, has been quick to denounce the MNS agitation as unconstitutional. Particularly commendable was the firm and statesmanlike
defence of the Constitution by Leader of the Opposition L.K Advani; he spoke up for the constitutional right of every citizen to live and work in any part
of India and denounced the MNS-instigated violence, pointing out that such action &quot;weakens our country's unity and is against the Constitution.&quot; The correct
responses of major political parties have taken the wind out of the sails of the clumsy attempt to bring back regional chauvinism as a strategy of political
mobilisation.

The force is with Obama

While the marathon race between Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton to win the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2008 presidential election continues
to be neck-and-neck in the delegate count, he has certainly gained momentum after the latest run of caucuses and primaries. At the end of the 22-State
battle of Super Tuesday, Ms Clinton had a lead of just fewer than 100 among those elected to participate in the party convention. Mr. Obama moved ahead
in the tal ly of pledged delegates by winning - with big margins - an unbroken series of eight nominating contests held after February 5. This gives him
a psychological advantage. There appears to be little chance that Ms Clinton will be able to regain the lead on February 19, when Democrats in Wisconsin
and Hawaii exercise their choice. The latest round of primaries, held on February 12, threw up some worrying trends for the Senator from New York. First,
the outcome marked a break from the emerging pattern in which primaries have mostly proved favourable to Ms Clinton while caucuses have largely given Mr.
Obama the advantage. Secondly, in Virginia and Maryland, Mr. Obama has won a sizable share of the votes of women and low-income whites, constituencies
that overwhelmingly backed her in earlier rounds.

In fact, for Ms Clinton it is uphill all the way from here. Her campaign is likely to become unviable if she does not win big in the Ohio and Texas primaries
on March 4. The configurations in these two large States are reported to be favourable and surveys of public opinion still give her the lead. However,
whatever happens on M-Day, she will be well short of the 2025 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. Her chances lie in staying close to Mr. Obama
in the competition for the support of pledged delegates up to the end of the nomination season, in the hope that most of the 796 super-delegates will eventually
swing towards her. According to guesstimates, fewer than half of the party bigwigs are committed to either side. Ms Clinton was thought to have an edge
among 'super-delegates' (who can vote as they please) but that can change under the pressure of who has more democratically pledged delegates. Mr. Obama
has put forward a strong and convincing argument that the Democratic establishment should follow grass-roots support. His charisma and message of change
are attracting big support, shattering traditional barriers, and his consistency on key issues certainly contrasts with his opponent's opportunism. The
Obama campaign is in full flow and, at this juncture, he has every chance of making history.

Operationalising the &quot;responsibility to protect&quot;

Ramesh Thakur

The Global Centre for R2P will be a catalyst for implementing the commitment of all countries to protect people around the world from genocide, crimes against
humanity, ethnic cleansing, and war crimes.

No idea has moved faster in the international normative arena than the &quot;responsibility to protect&quot; (R2P), the title of the 2001 report issued by the Canadian-sponsored
but independent international commission. When United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued his famous &quot;challenge of humanitarian intervention&quot; in
September 1999, he provoked such a furious backlash from so many countries that some wondered about his future in the U.N. Yet a mer e six years later,
the norm was endorsed by the world leaders gathered at the U.N. Mr. Annan called it one of his most precious achievements.

There is always a danger with revolutionary advances that commitments made at grand summits will suffer many a slip by the time action is required. Make
no mistake: R2P is not just a slogan but a call for action by the international community. Failure to act will make a mockery of the noble sentiments.

Recognising that the global endorsement of the norm in 2005 was but the prelude to translating it into timely action to prevent crises and stop atrocities,
a new Global Centre for R2P was launched on Thursday (February 14) at the U.N. headquarters in New York.

Consider this. In 2005, world leaders agreed that every country &quot;has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity&quot; and &quot;should peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities are manifestly failing to protect their populations,&quot; the
&quot;international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to help to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity.&quot; Yet some national diplomats insist, with straight faces, that &quot;the World Summit rejected R2P in 2005.&quot;

The first danger is thus a shamefaced edging back from the agreed norm of 2005, a form of buyer's remorse. We need continued advocacy and activism by civil
society and concerned governments to remain steadfast and hold all governments' feet to the fire of individual and collective responsibility to protect
at-risk populations. When Gareth Evans, co-chair of the R2P commission, gave a lecture last August in Colombo about R2P and what it meant for Sri Lanka,
he unleashed a storm of hostility around the theme that the &quot;so-called&quot; R2P &quot;is nothing but a licence for the white man to intervene in the affairs of
dark sovereign countries, whenever the white man thinks it fit to do so.&quot; Rather flatteringly, Mr. Evans' 2007 visit to the island armed with R2P was compared
to the coming of Columbus in 1492 and Vasco da Gama in 1498 with the Bible and the sword. One newspaper reported on &quot;crackpot ideas&quot; like R2P that have
been &quot;dismissed in academic and political circles as the latest 'neo-imperialist' tactic of the big powers to intervene in the affairs of small nations.&quot;

Many regimes which fear the searchlight of international attention being shone on their misdeeds will try to chip away at the norm until only a façade remains.
They must not be allowed to succeed. Better that they live with this fear than their people fear the death and disappearance squads. Of course, they could
remove the cause of such fear by working, by themselves or in concert with international friends, to remove the causes and prevent a crisis from arising.

A second, opposite danger of rollback lies with the aggressive humanitarian warriors who gave &quot;humanitarian intervention&quot; such a bad name in the first place.
Iraq is the best example of why we, the authors and promoters of R2P, should fear our &quot;friends&quot; as much as our opponents in this cause. The developing
countries' histories and their peoples' collective memories are only too full of past examples of trauma and suffering rooted in the white man's burden.
The weight of that historical baggage is simply too strong to sustain the continued use of the language of humanitarian intervention.

The addiction of some analysts to that language is puzzling and problematic. Puzzling, because our R2P report argued explicitly and forcefully about the
shortcomings of this terminology and the merits of a deliberate shift to the conceptual vocabulary of R2P. Many commentators simply ignore that, as if
the argument has not been made. If they disagree with the report, they should confront the issue and explain why.

The problematic element arises from

Uneven burden sharing

The decision to hike the retail prices of petrol and diesel by Rs.2 and Re.1 a litre respectively comes after six months of deliberations. The prices of
cooking fuels - LPG and kerosene - have been left untouched. The last revision in the prices of transportation fuels was in June 2006. At that time the
average price of the Indian crude basket was $67 a barrel, while the average for this year so far is $76.43. More ominously, global oil prices appear to
have se ttled at even higher levels in the recent past. After touching $100 a barrel in January, oil prices have eased marginally but still trade at around
$93. Global geopolitical factors, notably the prolonged strife in the oil producing regions of Nigeria, do not augur well for uninterrupted supplies. From
the outcome of its two recent meetings, the OPEC appears to be comfortable with the current prices. For the government, therefore, there are really no
options except to apportion the additional burden among the three parties directly affected - the consumer, the oil marketing companies, and the exchequer,
both at the Centre and in the States. Any decision on oil prices is therefore a compromise, unlikely to satisfy anyone. This time while consumers will
pay more, the government oil marketing companies expect to pare down their losses on retail trade by about Rs.850 crore over the rest of the year. A substantial
portion of their &quot;under recoveries&quot; - roughly the difference between the cost of production and selling price - will be met through the additional issue
of bonds. Oil bonds will be used to fund 57 per cent of the oil companies' losses, up from the present level of 47 per cent.

For now, the government has not given any tax concessions that could cushion the impact of the retail price hike. The petroleum sector contributes nearly
Rs.93,802 crore by way of indirect taxes to the Centre and Rs.62,121 crore to the States. The forthcoming budget is expected to give some clues, although
it is unlikely that the government will be able to forgo substantial tax revenues, given its high level of expenditure. Still the Centre could have demonstrated
its commitment to not casting too heavy a burden on the people by announcing some nominal tax cuts on petroleum products and by asking the States also
to match that gesture. Inflation, always lurking around the corner, is likely to become more potent as transportation costs go up. Being an off-budget
item, the bond route is open to criticism on many counts. It lends considerable opacity to public financial statements besides shifting the burden of redemption
to a future government. Like the new pricing formula, the methodology of implementing it will remain mired in controversy.

Building on a solid foundation

In initialling an agreement on cooperation in setting up additional nuclear power plants, India and Russia got around a glitch that had affected the long-standing
relationship. The two countries can now start drafting commercial contracts, and perhaps even undertake some preparatory work, for constructing two additional
reactors at Koodankulam. However, India may not be able to take further steps to operationalise the deal before it concludes negotiations with the Internat
ional Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. These negotiations being held under the terms of the 123 agreement with the United States could
break down. New Delhi has of course been bending over backwards in its efforts to stay on the right side of Washington. It was for this reason that India
refrained from signing the bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement even when it was pressed to do so by Russia's President Vladimir Putin during Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Moscow in November 2007. With the initialling of the bilateral agreement during Russian Prime Minister Victor Zubkov's
return visit earlier this week, Moscow has been provided some assurance that it will have the inside track when the scope for India-oriented nuclear commerce
is widened.

India and Russia were able to sort out differences over the utilisation of the rupee debt fund, placed at Rs.8,000 crore, during Dr. Singh's November visit.
In New Delhi, Mr. Zubkov announced that the newly launched titanium project in Orissa had been identified as a target for this fund. Given the depth of
the strategic relationship between the two countries, the lack of a substantial increase in bilateral trade is disappointing. Future prospects do not look
bright either, since the two countries think they can at best increase commerce between them from $3 billion to $10 billion by 2010. Whether expectations
will be exceeded after a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement is finalised is an open question. Mr. Zubkov has responded positively to the proposals
put forward by Petroleum Minister Murli Deora for cross-investments in the energy sector. India is particularly interested in acquiring a stake in the
Sakhalin III and other major petroleum projects in far-east Russia. India's commercial and industrial enterprises perhaps need to be reminded that there
can be destinations other than the West. The cultural shows to be organised during the current &quot;Year of Russia in India&quot; will, hopefully, serve this purpose.

Sleepwalking into a surveillance society?

Hasan Suroor

While it is acknowledged that surveillance is necessary in fighting terrorism and everyday crime, there is concern that the scale of it has gone out of
control in Britain.

The revelation that Scotland Yard bugged a senior Labour Party MP without government authorisation, apparently in breach of a 40-year-old practice against
spying on MPs, has re-ignited the debate on the British government's paranoia about security. Angry MPs are asking: Is Britain sleepwalking into a &quot;surveillance
society?&quot; Has it come to this that even MPs are regarded as a potential threat? And if we are not safe any more, how vulner able should the ordinary Briton
feel?

Tempers are running high in Westminster since The Sunday Times disclosed how the police covertly recorded a private conversation between the government
whip Sadiq Khan and his constituent Babar Ahmed who is facing extradition to America on terror charges. It happened during Mr. Khan's visits to the Woodhill
prison (Buckinghamshire) in 2005 and 2006 to meet Mr. Ahmed in his capacity as his local MP. Mr. Khan, a former human rights lawyer, one-time chairman
of Britain's leading rights group Liberty, has been an outspoken critic of the government's draconian anti-terror laws and was among a group of MPs who
wrote an open letter to Tony Blair in the aftermath of the Iraq invasion blaming his foreign policy for the rise in Islamist extremism.

Who authorised the bugging remains a mystery. The police have refused to comment but Mark Kearney, the police officer who bugged the Khan-Ahmed conversation,
has claimed that he came under &quot;significant pressure&quot; from the Scotland Yard to do so.

&quot;This request was very difficult. The MP concerned was Sadiq Khan, the member for Tooting. Mr. Khan is a prominent human rights lawyer. This concerned me
on the grounds that the recording may cross the barriers of legal privilege,&quot; he has been reported saying.

The government has denied any knowledge or involvement, and ordered an inquiry. Meanwhile, several other cases of alleged unauthorised bugging have come
to light, including one involving the Labour peer, Lord Ahmed, who claimed that he got to know that he was bugged after a Minister showed him a transcript
of a conversation he had with a Pakistani journalist in 2001.

Wilson doctrine

Under the 1966 &quot;Wilson doctrine,&quot; named after the former Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, there is a ban on tapping MPs' telephones or bugging their
conversations. The &quot;doctrine&quot; came about following an uproar over reports that intelligence agencies were spying on MPs for their suspected communist links.
Mr. Wilson assured MPs that henceforth there would be &quot;`no tapping of the telephones of Members of Parliament.&quot; He also promised that in the event of any
change in policy, the government would come before the House and make a statement.

&quot;If there was any development of a kind which required a change in the general policy [against tapping MPs' phones] I would, at such moment, as seemed compatible
with the security of the country, on my own initiative make a statement to the House about it,&quot; he declared.

Since then, successive governments have endorsed the &quot;Wilson doctrine;&quot; at least there were no reported cases of its breach until the Sadiq Khan incident.
In 2006, the Blair government toyed with the idea of lifting the ban as part of its new anti-terror package on the recommendation of the then Interception
of Communications Commissioner Sir Swinton Thomas who argued that in the new climate, MPs needed no special protection. His view was that if the threat
to national security justified bugging MPs, it should be allowed while protecting their dealings with their constituents.

Sir Swinton questioned the Wilson doctrine on the ground that it effectively put one set of citizens &quot;above the law&quot; which was against the fundamental spirit
of the Constitution. &quot;The doctrine means that MPs and peers can engage in serious crime or terrorism without running the risk of being investigated in
the same way as any other member of the public,&quot; he pointed out.

But his argument was drowned in a chorus of self-righteous protests from MPs who claimed that lifting the ban would undermine their freedom and compromise
the &quot;bond of confidentiality&quot; they shared with their constituents. They also feared that the information collected by intelligence agencies might be used
by the government for its own political ends.

Echoing their view, the combative Liberal Democrat MP, Norman Baker, said it was &quot;extremely important&quot; that MPs were able to operate without the suspicion
that what they said on the telephone was likely

Manoeuvring for advantage

With the Union Cabinet deciding to implement the recommendations of the Delimitation Commission on redefining Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies,
there is now a wholly avoidable uncertainty over the Assembly election in Karnataka, where the six-month-term of President's Rule is to end on May 28.
Once the notification on the delimitation is signed by the President, the general election will have to be held on the basis of the redefined constituencies,
which in turn will require the Election Commission to get the electoral rolls revised accordingly. Such an exercise is expected to take three or four months,
and will render the constitution of the new Assembly by May 28 virtually impossible. Only a few days earlier the draft electoral rolls for 208 of the 224
constituencies in Karnataka had been published. The whole process has to be gone through again in the event of the President notifying the delimited constituencies.
Karnataka cannot be equated with the five States - Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Nagaland and Jharkhand - where the delimitation exercise has been
deferred through amendments to the Delimitation Act. The delimitation was postponed in the four north-eastern States because of opposition to several rural
constituencies being converted to urban ones, and in Jharkhand because of opposition to the number of seats reserved for the Scheduled Tribes coming down.
As it would not be possible to exclude Karnataka alone from the delimitation exercise at this stage, the Centre should put off the Presidential notification
so as to enable the Election Commission to hold the election to the State Assembly without loss of time on the basis of the current voters' list prepared
as per the existing constituencies.

Any attempt to use the delimitation notification to delay the election in Karnataka cannot but be seen as politically motivated. The Congress-led United
Progressive Alliance government does not, understandably, sense any political advantage in an early election, but it must resist the temptation of using
the opportunity to delay the election process. Voters will see through such manipulative acts, and the Congress might have a political price to pay if
it opts for such delaying tactics. Moreover, any delay could lead to a constitutional minefield. Once the notification is signed by the President and the
Election Commission initiates the process of revision of rolls, Parliament will find itself forced to extend President's Rule in the State, as a failure
to do so will trigger a constitutional crisis. The Centre must therefore desist from such manoeuvres and hold the notification in abeyance so that the
election to the Karnataka Assembly is not delayed on a deliberately contrived technicality.

The return of realism?

Two high profile public issues, those of Emaar MGF and Wockhardt Hospitals, were withdrawn in quick succession earlier this month after they failed to enthuse
investors of all categories. Unprecedented in recent times, the development is attributable not just to market conditions but to an all round failure of
those charged with managing the issues. However, while the withdrawal of the two issues will radically alter the IPO market, it did not quite mark the
low point in r ecent primary history. That unenviable distinction belongs to the steep discount at which Reliance Power closed on the day it listed. Just
four weeks earlier, the company had set new records. Its public offer, the largest ever, was sold out in less than two minutes on the day its subscription
list opened, raking in a record Rs.11,560 crore. Over most of the next three weeks, even as the company hastened to complete the allotment, its share enjoyed
a huge premium in the so-called &quot;grey&quot; market. Far more than the cues from unofficial markets, it is the iconic status that the Reliance group, despite
the split, enjoys in the Indian stock markets that made many investors believe they could reap large gains on listing. That the Reliance Power stock not
only slipped below its listed price but, in the process, dragged the benchmark indices down rather sharply added to the woes of the investors.

Of the many lessons to be learnt, the most important one is that the investor sentiment should not be taken for granted. In a matter of three weeks, investors
who had so comprehensively supported a mega issue turned against it, with many of them voting with their feet as soon as its share price went into a discount
to the listed price. Two other IPOs, which were expected to do well, flopped. Almost certainly many of the public issues on offer would be withdrawn and
rescheduled. Secondly, there should be a return to the practice of fixing realistic prices on the offers and, equally significantly, relating them to the
business plans of the company. Both Emaar MGF and Wockhardt hospitals entered the capital market even though their projects were in the initial stages.
Reliance Power is basically implementing projects over the long-term. Thirdly, the timing of the public issue ought to receive greater attention. It is
naïve to think that the new issues market can be insulated from the secondary one. Stock markets are notorious for not learning the lessons from past slumps
but heeding them may well avert fiascos of the type witnessed recently.

India must return to Eurasian energy game

M.K. Bhadrakumar

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Central Asia is a difficult region, but with the right mix of political and financial capital, India could still make headway.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

If the great game over the energy resources of the Caspian Sea and Central Asia were to be compared to a five-act Shakespearean play, we might say Act III,
Scene I has just begun. On a Venice street, Shylock famously posits to Salarino the metaphorical relationship of intricate counter-balances: &quot;If you prick
us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?&quot;

The geopolitics of energy in the Central Asian steppes cannot have a better description. The interlocking trends are several. Russia remains the lead player
but the United States is aggressively striving to retake some of the territory it lost. Central Asian countries have become savvier in creating space for
themselves as energy exporters. Meanwhile, an ancient traveller has appeared on the Silk Road leading from Kashgar. China has raised its head above the
parapet. This holds the prospect of transforming the great game over energy into a &quot;multipolar&quot; affair in the spirit of our times.

Russia presses ahead

To be sure, the robustness and sense of direction in the Kremlin's energy diplomacy in recent years have inevitably come to be associated with President
Vladimir Putin's leadership. During the last two months, despite the Russian leader's watch of the Kremlin apparently ending, he continued to press ahead
with his string of successes. On November 27, 2007, Russia's Gazprom and Italy's Eni signed a deal on the South Stream project, a 900-km under the Black
Sea from Russia to Bulgaria. The 30 billion cubic metre capacity pipeline will strengthen Russia's position as Europe's main energy supplier and further
diminish the viability of U.S.-sponsored projects such as the Trans-Caspian Pipeline and the Nabucco gas pipeline project, envisaging the transportation
of Caspian oil and gas bypassing Russia.

On December 12, Russia agreed with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan on constructing a Caspian littoral pipeline for transporting Turkmen and Kazakh natural gas
to Russia. During the visit of Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis to Moscow in mid-December, Russian-Greek cooperation in South Stream was fleshed
out and an accord was initialled on the so-called Burgas-Alexandroupolis project, an oil pipeline almost parallel to South Stream.

On January 18, Russia and Bulgaria signed a multilateral agreement on South Stream, which could have potential branches reaching Greece, Italy, Serbia,
Hungary, Austria, Croatia, and Slovenia. A spectacular deal concluded in Moscow on January 25 envisages Gazprom's takeover of Serbia's entire energy sector,
shifting the locus of geopolitics of the Balkans. An American commentator warned: &quot;Moscow plans to use Serbia's territory as a gateway to break into Central
Europe.&quot;

Again, on January 25, 2008, Gazprom signed a deal with Austrian energy company OMV to jointly operate Europe's third largest energy trading hub at Baumgarten.
On the same day, Kyrgyz Prime Minister Igor Chudinov announced, while on a visit to Moscow, that Kyrgyzstan would be selling its national gas company to
Gazprom.

Washington is scrambling to react to Russia's strategic coup. A new office has been created in the State Department - Coordinator of Eurasian Energy Diplomacy.
A search is on for a special envoy on energy diplomacy. Washington seems to be reverting to its strategy of the early 1990s of gaining access to energy
reserves before working on transportation routes. The diplomatic focus will be on Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan.

The high profile visits in January by the former chairman of the U.S. senate foreign relations committee, Senator Richard Lugar (who remains a major force
in the foreign policy establishment), to Baku - two other Congressional delegations also visited Baku earlier in January - and by Admiral William Fallon,
head of the U.S. Central Command, to Tashkent underscored this. Clearly, there is a sense of urgency on the part of the George W. Bush administration for
achieving diplomatic results in the Caspian Basin during its remaining term in office.

Geopolitically, the revamped U.S. diplomacy will almost certainly speed up the integration of Georgia and Azerbaijan into the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.

Counting real tigers

The first attempt at estimating India's tiger population using statistically valid techniques shows that the numbers of the big cat are depressingly low.
The recently released report of the National Tiger Conservation Authority and Wildlife Institute of India, titled &quot;Status of Tigers, Co-predators and Prey
in India,&quot; estimates that there are 1,411 tigers in six landscape complexes. These are the Shivalik-Gangetic Plains; the Central Indian Landscape Comp
lex; the Eastern Ghats; the Western Ghats; the North-Eastern Hills and Brahmaputra Plains; and the Sunderbans. The estimate confirms the assessment that
tiger populations are far lower than past official counts. Rather than persist with the fiction of impressive absolute counts of the cats based mainly
on the pugmark method, the census adopted scientific sampling techniques such as mark-recapture and distance sampling of tigers. As a result, conservation
efforts can be founded on a more credible statistical base and future assessments may reflect gains or losses more accurately. The Tiger Conservation Authority
now needs to consolidate the effort by welcoming all independent scientific endeavours as part of the official sampling programme.

Realistic assessments of the state of the tiger will help Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the State governments launch a major effort to strengthen the
integrity of national parks and designated reserves. If long-term conservation is the goal, the creation of inviolate areas devoid of human presence is
vital. As a first step, Dr Singh identified last year the relocation of 270 villages in core areas of sanctuaries as a priority task. Where voluntary relocation
has succeeded, tiger numbers are healthier. A good example of voluntary and humane relocation is Nagarahole in the Western Ghats, where independent researchers
and the Karnataka government have worked together. Recent estimates suggest that these forests host the single largest population of tigers in the Nagarahole-Mudumalai-Bandipur-Wayanad
landscape unit. Other landscapes present a variety of challenges. The Tiger Conservation Authority must tackle armed insurgency in the Eastern Ghats and
parts of central India, widespread unsustainable resource extraction, and alarming levels of poaching of tigers and their prey. Resources are not a constraint
and, among other things, there is international support to save the last of the major wild tiger populations found anywhere. What the conservation agenda
needs most is unequivocal political commitment.

Closer financial integration

The landmark Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), which aims to remove the economic disincentives to the execution of cross-border non-cash transactions, has
come into force throughout the European Union's 27 member states, and four neighbouring countries. A natural progression from the adoption of the euro
common currency in 1999, the development represents an advance in the realisation of the EU single market. The fight against discrimination in charges
levied for domestic and international credit transfers assumed urgency when - ahead of the launch of euro coins and bank notes - the European Commission
found that a ?100 transfer attracted a 25 per cent commission. Following a subsequent regulation, cross-border credit transfers in euro denominations of
small value, withdrawals from cash machines, and payments using credit and debit cards are all charged the same fee as domestic transactions. But indeterminate
execution periods and unauthorised double-charging have remained sticking points, mainly owing to the coexistence of non-uniform national payment standards
and rules. SEPA, in its first phase, stipulates a maximum of three business days for the settlement of cross-border credit transfers of unlimited value.
Further, service providers are to ensure transparency for consumers by charging a separate fee. SEPA will extend to direct debits by late 2009 and eventually
replace all national means of payment by 2012. Once it is fully operational, corporations and consumers will be able to conduct domestic as well as cross-border
transactions in euros using a single bank account and retail businesses can process different card transactions through a single machine. These will considerably
boost the EU core principles of free movement of persons, services, and goods.

Largely a banking sector initiative, SEPA seems a far cry from the industry's scepticism of two decades ago over attempts to regulate international payment
procedures. The heavy investments required for the switch-over from national to pan-EU service providers have evoked a rather cautious response from smaller
banks and retailers. Demonstrating a more positive stance, about half of Europe's banking industry, which handles 80 per cent of the transactions, has
already signed up to the new initiative. The cost involved in operating the national and the common European systems in the transition period is a major
incentive for a speedy and comprehensive roll-out of the SEPA. But more than the billions of euros that it promises in savings, the formation of SEPA is
one of those measures that further reinforce the experience of the EU as a borderless reality for millions of ordinary citizens and international visitors.

Kashmir: The autumn of the jihad?

Praveen Swami

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Kashmir's Jamaat-e-Islami is beginning to undo its two decades-old hijacking by the jihadist agenda.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

BELOW the ice carpet in the Kashmir Valley, the first stirrings of the political life that will blossom this summer have begun. Last week, Sheikh Mohammad
Hassan, chief of the Jammu and Kashmir Jamaat-e-Islami, the political formation that gave birth to the Hizb ul-Mujahideen, announced that his organisation
would not participate in secessionist campaigns calling for a boycott of the Assembly elections scheduled for later this year.

Hassan's language was startling. &quot;Elections,&quot; he said, &quot;do not have any impact on the status of the Kashmir issue. If people cast their votes in the elections,
it does not mean that they have given up their freedom struggle or accepted India's domination of Jammu and Kashmir.&quot; &quot;I am at variance,&quot; he said, &quot;with
leaders and organisations who over-emphasise the election boycott campaign.&quot; Among these leaders is the Islamist patriarch Syed Ali Shah Geelani, of whose
hard line Tehrik-e-Hurriyat secessionist coalition the Jamaat is a part.

Coming just days after the Pakistan-based United Jihad Council announced that it would not kill election participants - 69 activists were shot dead in 1996,
and 99 in 2002 - the Jamaat declaration has been little reported, and even less understood. It could, however, prove critical to political life in the
State.

All this past year, the Jamaat has been seeking to return to its roots: organising rallies against moral corruption and Western cultural influences but
studiously avoiding polemic on the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir.

Ideologically affiliated to but institutionally distinct from its counterparts in India and Pakistan, the Jamaat was founded by Saaduddin Tarabali. A theologian
and school science teacher who was among Islamist ideologue Maulana Abdul Ala Maududi's associates, Saaduddin's central concern was freeing Islam in Jammu
and Kashmir of the syncretic folk practices he believed had corrupted the essence of the faith.

In a 1945 inaugural speech to the Jamaat cadre, Saaduddin railed against &quot;the sad state of Islam in this land today.&quot; &quot;Our state is such that leave alone
making an unbeliever a Muslim,&quot; he said, &quot;no true Muslim can be fully satisfied with us.&quot; Only after this was achieved, in Saaduddin's view, the party
of Islam would be able to place before the world &quot;a broad Islamic revolutionary programme.&quot;

For decades, under Saaduddin's watchful eye, the Jamaat participated in mainstream political life, endorsing candidates to the Jammu and Kashmir legislature
who swore allegiance to India's Constitution. Speaking for the emerging Muslim middle-class - the petty bourgeoisie, orchard owners and bureaucrats - the
Jamaat insisted that Indian rule in Jammu and Kashmir was contested, but stayed clear of violent movements intended to overthrow it. In the mid-1970s,
though, that began to change, with fateful consequences.

Radicalisation

Understanding the Jamaat-e-Islami's hijacking by the jihadist agenda needs engagement with the political climate of the period. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
wielded something resembling political omnipotence in Jammu and Kashmir during the period, a status acquired by the decisive military defeat of Pakistan
in the Bangladesh war. &quot;Her progress on the Dal Lake by boat was propelled by turbaned oarsmen,&quot; historian Victoria Schofield has recorded of Indira Gandhi's
October 1975 visit to Srinagar, &quot;in a manner reminiscent of the visits of Mughal emperors.&quot;

Indira Gandhi's visit followed the conclusion of a political deal with Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah. In essence, Abdullah was anointed sole spokesman for the
State, in return for unquestioning support both for the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Indian Union, and Congress' rule in New Delhi.

Abdullah's political enemies soon felt the lash. During the Emergency, his Hindu-communalist adversaries in Jammu and the Jamaat both faced proscription.
This had Sheikh Abdullah's enthusiastic support. In one speech, he had described the Islamist organisation's schools as &quot;the real source for spreading
communal poison.&quot;

In March 1977, though, Indira Gandhi withdrew the Emergency and called general elections. She was defeated. Now wearing the halo of political martyrdom,
the Jamaat sought to capitalise on the new situation. It allied itself with the Janata Party both at the national level, and in Jammu and Kashmir, where

Inspiring outcome

The people of Pakistan have done themselves proud by voting decisively against military rule as well as religious extremism in the general election of February

18. The vote was so overwhelmingly in favour of liberal-centrist democratic forces that the Pakistan People's Party and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz
Sharif) have together taken close to 60 per cent of the seats in the National Assembly. The PPP has swept its traditional stronghold of rural Sindh; in
the Seraiki belt of Punjab, it appears to be regaining the ground it lost over the last two decades. With an unanticipated second-placed finish in the
North West Frontier Province and seat gains in Balochistan, the PPP will be the single largest party in parliament. Benazir Bhutto's admirers within and
outside Pakistan will however be disappointed that the wave of sympathy set off by her assassination was not strong enough to give her party even 100 of
the 268 parliamentary seats for which elections were held. The Pakistan Muslim League (Qaid-e-Azam), the party that served as the civilian mask for President
Pervez Musharraf's dictatorial regime, has fared poorly but remains a force. In a clear rejection of anti-democratic politics, voters handed down humiliating
defeats to PML(Q)'s president and former Prime Minister, Chaudhary Shujat Hussain, and several former Ministers, including Khurshid Kasuri, Sheikh Rashid,
Sher Afghan Niazi, and Wasi Jafar. Upsets of this sort were registered across Punjab, a province in which the King's Party tried hard to consolidate its
position over the past five years; its notable wins, such as Faisal Saleh Hayat's victory over Begum Abida Hussein, are attributable to local factors.
The PML(N), on the other hand, has won decent electoral dividends for the uncompromising fight it put up against authoritarianism and constitutional manipulation
and fraud. It has demonstrated the strength of its roots in central and northern Punjab. This is a most creditable showing considering that the Musharraf
regime directed much of its ire at Mr. Sharif's party and attempted, along with the King's Party, to squeeze it in a pincer.

What is clear is that the people of Pakistan have voted for a stable coalition government of the PPP and PML(N) - with the premiership going to the single
largest party. Such an arrangement has political merit since it would consolidate the leading elective democratic forces in Pakistan's politics. The importance
of strengthening this base to mobilise the masses against army-based authoritarianism on the one side and religious extremism on the other cannot be overestimated.
There is also a good chance that the formation of a PPP-PML(N) coalition will not lead to a situation where parties representing extremist tendencies take
up much of the space left for the opposition. Parties with secular credentials have done well in urban Sindh and the NWFP. The Muttahida Quami Movement
has retained its hold over Karachi and Hyderabad while the Awami National Party has experienced a heartening revival in the NWFP. The rout of the Religious
Right in an election that was free and fair raises the question whether it could have ever gained such prominence without the support of the military establishment.
Encouragingly, there seems to be a connection between the spectacular fall of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal in the NWFP and a professional order recently
issued by the Chief of Army Staff, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. He directed military personnel to withdraw from the civilian administration and to refrain
from contacts with politicians. Together with nationalist, left-leaning politicians elected from Balochistan, the MQM and the ANP could offer a left-of-centre
opposition.

The key question is whether Pakistan's two leading parties can overcome their differences and tensions over the kind of intermediate political-constitutional
arrangements they want for Pakistan. Mr. Sharif's party has made it clear that it wants the restoration of the judiciary; the repeal of the 17th constitutional
amendment, which enabled General Musharraf to remain in power; and the removal of all restrictions on the media. It has also indicated, not in so many
words, that it wants President Musharraff to go, possibly through the threat of impeachment, which must now be reckoned to be on Pakistan's political agenda.
Will Asif Zardari and a PPP that has, under the influence of its western backers, shown a distinctive inclination to compromise with the Musharraf dispensation
agree to the PML(N)'s terms - which might mean embarking on a course of confrontation with a dictator who is down but still in place? Nobody wants confrontation
but the alternative scenario of the PPP turning to the PML(Q), the MQM, and the ANP to form a government will mean betraying the people's mandate.

Hearteningly, the results of the four provincial assembly elections reflect the same pattern as the parliamentary outcome. The PML(N) will be the single
largest party in Punjab and can legitimately claim the chief ministership, as part of a coalition arrangement with the PPP. There is no uncertainty at
all about who will rule Sindh; the PPP has won a clear majority of Assembly seats in this province where its ascendancy signals a welcome end to the era
of unstable coalitions. Quite different types of coalition arrangements, bringing the PPP and the PML(Q) together in Balochistan and the ANP, the PPP,
and the PML(N) together in the NWFP, seem unavoidable. With the people of Pakistan decisively and inspiringly repudiating the dictatorial actions of President
Musharraf, and the political forces that colluded with him, the most sensible course of action for him is to step down, thus helping his country and people
come out of their time of troubles.

Reforming the legal profession: some ideas

N.R. Madhava Menon

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

There cannot be meaningful reform of the judiciary without appropriate reform of the legal profession.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The Bar and the Bench are said to be the two wheels of the chariot of justice. They take the credit for achievements in the administration of justice. They
should also share the blame equally for the ills. Yet in public discourses on judicial reforms, the changes needed in the legal profession are seldom discussed
with the urgency they deserve, apparently under the impression that nothing can be done unless the profession itself wants to change. There seems to be
a fear psychosis in the judiciary and the political class when it comes to confronting the Bar which is largely responsible for the major ills of the system,
namely delay, cost and corruption. The Transparency International Report of 2007, while projecting the judiciary as the third most corrupt institution
in the country, concluded that 77 per cent of corruption in the judicial system has been lawyer-driven.

Several expert committee reports have argued that lawyers contribute significantly to the increase in litigation cost and delay. The government should immediately
set up a high power committee to review the Advocates Act and re-write it in the context of the changes needed (some of which were proposed long ago by
the Bar Council itself) for better and timely delivery of justice at affordable costs. There cannot be meaningful reform of the judiciary without appropriate
reform of the legal profession. And it is too much to expect the profession to reform itself although it has the power and authority to do so.

With unprecedented changes induced by technology and globalisation, all professions are forced to re-think their methods of management and delivery of services.
Accountability systems are being made more transparent and participatory with the object of controlling commercialisation and improving the quality of
services. Even the code of ethics and methods of disciplining erring members are being reworked across professions.

It is in this context that the Indian legal profession is to be looked at for seeking reforms. There is no clear understanding of the working of the profession
because very little data are available on several aspects of the profession and its functioning. The legal profession is said to be a million-strong, which
includes approximately 6 lakh to 7 lakh practising in the private sector as litigating lawyers, about a lakh or more working as in-house counsel in the
corporate sector, and an equal number involved in the public sector. While the organised profession (Bar Councils and Bar Associations) has little to do
with the latter two categories, it is effectively in control of the vast body of practising advocates who operate in the trial and appellate courts as
well as in tribunals and regulatory bodies. It is they who strike work, boycott courts, dabble in politics and corrupt the course of administration of
justice.

The problem with them are many, not all of their own making. The 80:20 phenomenon operates in the profession, whereby 20 per cent of the lawyers command
80 per cent of paying legal work. The system is like a pyramid where the bottom 40 per cent really has to struggle to make a living with no help from the
seniors or the powerful top 20 per cent who have a monopolistic control over available legal work, litigative as well as non-litigative. Added to the plight
of these people are their professional inadequacies, including poor legal education, communication and transaction skills and poor infrastructure support
to learn and develop themselves.

Because of their numerical strength and lack of appreciation for professional ethics, they are in the forefront of agitational politics and exploitative
practices. They decide who will go to the Bar Councils and how they manage the legislative, executive and judicial functions vis-À-vis the profession.
Resolutions are sometimes
