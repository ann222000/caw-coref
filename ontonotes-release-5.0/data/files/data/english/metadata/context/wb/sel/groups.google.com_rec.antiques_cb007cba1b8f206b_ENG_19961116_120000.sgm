On September 21, Eddie Murray hit a grand slam off Blue Jays reliever
Scott Brow, the 19th of his career, passing Willie McCovey for the No. 2
spot. It also gave him 76 RBIs for the season making him the first major
leaguer to drive in 75 runs over 20 consecutive seasons, surpassing Hank
Aaron.

Sorry to bother you, but how is the value of that ball estimated if it's
tightly documented, including video of catch and all newspaper clips with
pictures? Direct from fan who caught it? Hulp? Anybody know? This is a
foreign world to the avid fan who caught the ball (and I am not he).
