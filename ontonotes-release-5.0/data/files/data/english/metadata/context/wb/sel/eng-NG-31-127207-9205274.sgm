That's all you have to be doing, because they beat our team, the
Cowboys.  None of this talk about how if the injured guys on defense
had been there, or if Romo had of done better.....

or what @@@@@@@ ever!

Our team lost to a better team.  The sooner you can recognize that,
and find a way to reconcile it, the better off you will be.  Instead
of a bunch of whiney cheesers.

It's only a football game, guys and gals.  'Tis all it is, and
certainly not very important on the grand scale of things, when there
are so many other things in this world that mean so very much more
than football.

Look man, let it go already. It's a foregone conclusion that IF and I mean
IF the Pats stayed healthy your team though very good could play the Pats 16
games in a row and get whupped 16 games in a row. I aint just sayin that cos
I'm a Pats fan. I'm sayin it cos the Dallas Cowboys aren't even a sniff as
good as the Pats. No one is right now!

Now luck does factor in a little bit so maybe if ya played em 32 times in a
row you might squeak out a 3 point win somewhere but the Pats are the best
team in NFL history if the season ended tomorrow. It don't end tomorrow
though so we will see. I'm tellin ya they are just that good.

They are going to shatter lots more records this season IF they stay
reasonably healthy.

&quot;Our&quot; team, skippy?  I smell troll.

If the Cowboys were &quot;your team&quot;, then you would already know that only a few
(less than a half-dozen) fans were saying anything about injuries, or making
excuses.  Most everyone, myself included, were saying that the Pats were the
better team that day, for sure, and at this point in the season as well.

Run along. Pats fan.  Try harder next time.

In other words, it could happen.  Not likely, but it could happen
nonetheless.

As long as you're the one saying &quot;IF&quot;, then it's you that needs to let it
go.

I don't think most Cowboy fans suggest that the Patriots are not the better
team.

The Cowboys did play a little cruddy, but we also know we got beat by the
best. However, regardless of our crappy play, we still competed and kept the
score relatively close.

While I agree in general, you can admit the Patriots are clearly a rung
above where we are, and still bemoan the mistakes that cost you a chance
to compete for the win. You also don't have to slobberingly fawn over
the Patriots after the loss, as while they are better, they are beatable.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; or what @@@@@@@ ever!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Our team lost to a better team.  The sooner you can recognize that,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and find a way to reconcile it, the better off you will be.  Instead
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of a bunch of whiney cheesers.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It's only a football game, guys and gals.  'Tis all it is, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; certainly not very important on the grand scale of things, when there
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; are so many other things in this world that mean so very much more
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; than football.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I think we all said this and people with whom I have other
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; disagreements in this ng said this as well

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean that we cannot beat them however and I am hoping for a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rematch

&gt;&gt; &gt; Look man, let it go already. It's a foregone conclusion that IF and I
&gt;&gt; &gt; mean
&gt;&gt; &gt; IF the Pats stayed healthy your team though very good could play the
&gt;&gt; &gt; Pats
&gt;&gt; &gt; 16 games in a row and get whupped 16 games in a row. I aint just sayin
&gt;&gt; &gt; that cos I'm a Pats fan. I'm sayin it cos the Dallas Cowboys aren't
&gt;&gt; &gt; even a
&gt;&gt; &gt; sniff as good as the Pats. No one is right now!

&gt;&gt; &gt; Now luck does factor in a little bit so maybe if ya played em 32 times
&gt;&gt; &gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt; a row you might squeak out a 3 point win somewhere but the Pats are the
&gt;&gt; &gt; best team in NFL history if the season ended tomorrow. It don't end
&gt;&gt; &gt; tomorrow though so we will see. I'm tellin ya they are just that good.

&gt;&gt; &gt; They are going to shatter lots more records this season IF they stay
&gt;&gt; &gt; reasonably healthy.

&gt;&gt; In other words, it could happen.  Not likely, but it could happen
&gt;&gt; nonetheless.

&gt;&gt; As long as you're the one saying &quot;IF&quot;, then it's you that needs to let it
&gt;&gt; go.

&gt; Well, 'if' showed it was the biggest words in the English language,
&gt; Rodney, when YOU said the Cowboys would be the best team in football
&gt; IF they beat the Patriots.  How do you feel now, Rodney Parker.
">

If you do a simple Google search, you will see numerous posts where I
claimed the Patriots were , by far, the better team---WELL BEFORE THE GAME
WAS PLAYED.  My hope was that Dallas could catch lightning in a bottle.

Of course, you could easily prove me FOS if you could produce a link to
support the bullshit you claim I said.

Go ahead....I'm waiting...

Don't be a pussy...post your proof.

Didn't think so

&gt; Exactly! Most everyone in the Cowboys NG were saying that this was not a
&gt; loss to fret over and that the Patriots were indeed a fascinating team...

The Pats so far this year are in a class by themselves.
The Chairmen of the Board--to use an old expression coined for Mr Sinatra in
the 1950s when he was the best.
Any of you guys remember Sinatra? I mean when he could really sing? Just a
digression.

Sinatra was a great singer...too bad he was such a basket case that
the Army rejected him on a psych disability.
