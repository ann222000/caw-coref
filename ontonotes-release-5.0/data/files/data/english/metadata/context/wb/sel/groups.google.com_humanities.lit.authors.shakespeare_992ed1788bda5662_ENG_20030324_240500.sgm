The GRINDSTONE
Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens Part III - Chapter II

The people in possession of the house had let them in at the GATE,
and they had rushed in to work at the GRINDSTONE;
it had evidently been set up there for their purpose,
as in a convenient and retired spot.

But, such awful workers, and such awful work!

The GRINDSTONE had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two
men, whose faces, as their long hair Rapped back when the whirlings
of the GRINDSTONE brought their faces up, were more horrible and
cruel than the visages of the WILDEST SAVAGES in their most BARBAROUS
DISGUISE. False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them,
and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all
awry with howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly
excitement and want of sleep.

Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded,
and the irruption was repeated, and the GRINDSTONE whirled and
spluttered. &quot;What is it?&quot; cried Lucie, affrighted. &quot;Hush! The
soldiers' swords are sharpened there,&quot; said Mr. Lorry. &quot;The place
is national property now, and used as a kind of armoury, my love.&quot;

Here is an &quot;executive summary&quot; of Art's posts that I posted the last
time someone raised the very natural question of what Art is haplessly
trying to do:
---------------------------------------------------

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Hi,
&gt; Could someone spell out for me what Neuendorffer is up to?

"/>

The title you seek is not _The Complete Idiot's Guide to
Neuendorffer_, but rather _Guide to the Complete Idiot Neuendorffer_.
The latter has not yet been published, so I'll furnish a brief précis.

Jesting aside, there are indications that Art is very intelligent,
and that his posts are all an enormous leg-pull. Indeed, many appear to
be witty parodies of the lunacy of other readily identifiable
anti-Stratfordians. Thus when I refer to &quot;Art&quot; below, I usually mean
his trolling persona rather than Art himself.

Art professes to believe that the Shakespeare canon is the work of a
monstrous conspiracy of Templars, Freemasons, Rosicrucians, and Priory
of Sion adepts (for those not in the know concerning lunatic conspiracy
theories, a hilarious paperback pulp-history by Baigent, Leigh, and
Lincoln popularized the notion that Jesus and his consort Mary Magdalene
had a child, whose descendants, settling in Provence, eventually became
the Merovingian kings of France; the Priory of Sion is supposed to be a
shadowy global conspiracy, in existence at least since the destruction
of the Templars, actively engaging in machinations to restore this
Sacred Bloodline to the French throne!). Art believes (or professes to
believe) that I am an active member of the conspiracy in question, along
with virtually every writer of note who ever lived, from A. Conan Doyle
to Dr. Seuss, as well as many of the &quot;Stratfordians&quot; in this newsgroup.
(For all I know, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and the
Order of Odd Fellows may be involved as well.)

Art arrives at and tries haplessly to support these conclusions via
farcically inept nutcase numerology and crackpot cryptography.
Instances of both are too numerous to reproduce here, but one of the
funniest of the latter is Art's contention that &quot;weaved sleided silk&quot; is
an anagram of &quot;I kill Edwasd de Vese&quot; -- who &quot;Edwasd de Vese&quot; might be
or why the Masonic conspirators should be so inept at cryptography Art
does not explain.

Art is also farcically misinformed about and incompetent in virtually
every subject. Again, instances are far too numerous to recount, but a
couple of examples will suffice. Art opined that Anne Hathaway was
Shakespeare's mother! He actually asserted that the Augustan Age of
Virgil predated that of Herodotus! He identified Aleksandr Nevskii as
&quot;tsar,&quot; a title that would not be assumed by the Velikii Knyaz' of
Moscow for another several centuries. Art also assured us that the word
&quot;moniment&quot; appearing in tributes to Shakespeare from the early 1600s
meant &quot;laughingstock,&quot; a sense that the word would not acquire until
roughly the mid-nineteenth century, and only in Scots dialect, at that
(that sense does not appear at all in the OED, for example).

But Art's incompetence is by no means confined to history -- indeed,
Art has the intellectual breadth of a true Renaissance Idiot. For
example, in some of his forays into nutcase numerology, Art has called
attention to what he takes to be the mystical Masonic significance of
various numbers, among them the number 19 -- Art informed us that 19 was
remarkable because, among other reasons, it was both the sum of two
consecutive integers and the difference of their squares. To observe
that ALL odd integers share this property is apparently well beyond the
scope of Art's meager mathematical ability.

Art imbibes with eager credulity all sorts of idiotic rubbish that he
finds at farcically unreliable and even lunatic web sites. For example,
some of his information about Freemasonry was derived from a web site
that fulminated for pages about conspiracies of space aliens from so
many planetary systems that one would need a scorecard to keep track of
them all. His information about Mithraism was derived from a racist,
white supremacist web site. In short, Art has no understanding, however
rudimentary, of the concept of source reliability. (Of course, the very
fact that Art feels compelled to drag Mithraism into discussions of
Shakespeare is typical of his &quot;thought.&quot;)

Art is also abysmally incompetent in everyday informal reasoning.
For example, when a middle-aged Raytheon plant manager named Peter Gay
perished in the 9/11 attacks, Art IMMEDIATELY concluded that the victim
must be the distinguished Yale historian Peter Gay, despite the fact
that the latter is some two decades older than the former. Art
rationalized this tasteless blunder as follows: he recalled that the
historian Peter Gay was supported by the Mellon Foundation; he knew that
there was a Mellon Bank in Manhattan. Therefore, by Art's &quot;reasoning,&quot;
the historian must presumably have been flying to New York to collect
his monthly grant check -- IN PERSON -- at the Manhattan branch of the
Mellon Bank! I am not making this up -- Art wrote:

&quot;Gay is not a common name (nor even the Professor's actual name:
Frohlich) so when I discovered that P.G. worked in Manhattan
(&amp; was funded by the Mellon Bank) I thought it was a reasonable
chance that the Stratfordian had died. [I was certainly quite
curious if it was and figured that this would be the quickest way
to resolve the issue without clogging up the 'victim internet
search network'.]

(See the entire thread, particularly
&lt;
manities.lit.authors.*+author:neuendorffer&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=3BA3C28D .1D8DA873%40erols.com&amp;rnum=1&gt;.)

Note the sheer number of moronic missteps in this very short selection.
First, Art apparently believes that Gay is &quot;not a common name&quot; -- this
despite the fact that I have encountered at least three Peter Gays (and
numerous Fröhlichs) *in academics alone*. Second, note that Art refers
to the historian Peter Gay as &quot;the Stratfordian&quot; -- how he infers that
the Peter Gay who worked for Raytheon is not a &quot;Stratfordian&quot; Art does
not disclose. Third, note that Art, who was &quot;quite curious&quot; whether
&quot;the Stratfordian had died,&quot; could have answered his own question in
under ten seconds via an ordinary Google search -- but Art evidently
believes that Google actually pores through the entire world-wide web
*IN REAL TIME (!)* looking for occurrences of &quot;Peter Gay&quot; -- hence his
concern about &quot;clogging up the 'victim internet search network'&quot;!
Fourth, that Art's dissemination of a completely bogus rumor concerning
the tragic death of a scholar of international renown would surely clog
up the &quot;victim internet search network&quot; -- if such a thing existed
outside Art's febrile imagination -- does not appear to have occurred to
Art AT ALL! Fifth, note Art's apparent belief that the best way to
resolve the question was to announce, in an open forum read worldwide,
the supposed &quot;death&quot; of a prominent scholar! Finally, when asked
whether he still believed the victim to have been the celebrated
historian, Art tastelessly and cruelly replied, &quot;Sadly, no.&quot; Art
infers, using the same &quot;reasoning,&quot; that just as there could not
possibly be more than one Peter Gay on the entire planet, so there could
not possibly have been more than one Anne Hathaway.

&gt; I'm amazed

Art evidently has a lot of time on his hands. He has authored some
10,000 h.l.a.s. posts, many of them of monstrous proportions (some run
in excess of 40K), and he reposts the same hilarious Hermetic hogwash
over and over. Not only does he repeat the same material in many posts
over a period of years, but he even repeats himself idiotically within a
SINGLE POST. In fact, one particularly memorable (and moronic) crackpot
cryptogram he repeated verbatim FIVE TIMES within a SINGLE POST! One
supposes that this tiresome repetitiveness (bordering upon senile
dementia) is Art's parody of Richard Kennedy, who does the same thing -
but Art, unlike Kennedy, is too intelligent actually to be that senile.

Read them as parodic trolling. Art's sometimes self-deprecating
humor, his occasionally clever wordplay, and his claim that he studied
physics at MIT make it seem very unlikely that he is actually stupid
enough to believe any of the lunatic logorrhea he posts. Moreover, he
doesn't take himself as ponderously seriously as do Paul Crowley, Paul
Streitz, Richard Kennedy, Elizabeth Weir, and other truly delusional
anti-Stratfordians. I find the conclusion that Art is trolling nearly
inescapable.

That's very likely - if not &quot;I kill Edwasd de Vese,&quot; then probably
&quot;Agnes a gob&quot; or one of its many idiotic variants.

PARODIC TROLLING
ALLOTROPIC GRIND

allotropic: existing in two or more physical forms
----------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;The substance was the result of a secret process whereby gold and
platinum group metals were transformed into a white powder which the
Egyptians called MFKZT (pronounced muf-kutz). The powder, though derived
from heavy metals, had a negative weight (less than zero), and transmitted
the same weightlessness to its container. When ingested, the powder brought
heightened spiritual awareness to its user, and it supposedly could
transport itself or its user into a different time/space dimension,
called the Field of MFKZT, or the Plane of Shar-on. &gt;&gt;

CLEAVER wordplay
---------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;In 1579 a middle-aged lawyer called John STUBBS (c.1543-1591) was
sentenced to public mutilation at Westminster for having written a &quot;lewd
and seditious&quot; pamphlet against Queen Elizabeth's proposed marriage to
the French king's brother (&quot;The Discoverie of a Gaping Gulf Where into
England is Likely to be Swallowed by another French Marriage,&quot;). Copies
of the book were burned in the kitchen stove of Stationer's Hall. It
took the executioner three blows to CLEAVE his right hand by means of a
CLEAVER driven through the wrist by a mallet; before STUBBS fainted
he &quot;put off his hat with his left and said with a loud voice, 'God save
the Queen'&quot;. Camden, who witnessed this appalling scene, records that.
&quot;The multitude standing about was altogether silent, either out of horror of
this new and unwonted punishment, or else out of pity towards the man&quot;.
(STUBBS regained Elizabeth's favour in later years, and had a career
in parliament.)&gt;&gt;

July 16, 1557, Anne of CLEEVES, 4th wife of Henry VIII, dies at 41
