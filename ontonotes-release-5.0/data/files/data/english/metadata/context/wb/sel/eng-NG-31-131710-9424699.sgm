Michael Anthony Says He's 'Not Going To Whine About' Van Halen Reunion
Snub
'It would have been cool to get onstage with Dave again,' original
bassist tells MTV News.
By Chris Harris

You've got to hand it to Michael Anthony: The dude is all about taking
the high road.

While Anthony, Van Halen's original bassist, wasn't asked to
participate in the band's long-awaited reunion trek with inaugural
frontman David Lee Roth (see &quot;Van Halen Reunite With David Lee Roth --
Tour Kicks Off September 27&quot;), he doesn't seem all that miffed. Eddie
Van Halen's 16-year-old son, Wolfgang, will be taking over on bass
(see &quot;Michael Anthony Says He Wasn't Invited To Van Halen Reunion, But
Calls His Replacement 'A Great Kid' &quot;).

So is Anthony disappointed? You betcha - but he's not going to let it
ruin his fall.

&quot;It's not like it was totally unexpected,&quot; he told MTV News during a
recent interview, &quot;only because of the strain from the 2004 tour and
how everything's been since then.&quot; Anthony is referring to the band's
2004 reunion jaunt with Roth replacement Sammy Hagar, which grossed
almost $55 million before ending on a sour note (at the conclusion of
the run's final gig, guitarist Eddie Van Halen smashed one of his
guitars and quickly walked offstage).

&quot;That's the one thing that's really kind of sad,&quot; Anthony continued.
&quot;It would have been cool to get onstage with Dave again, but I'm not
going to whine about it, because that's the way it is. Why waste my
time trying to make a stink about it?&quot;

Instead, Anthony is going to be hitting the road with Hagar this fall
for a tour that kicks off in Biloxi, Mississippi, on October 19, and
runs through November 17 in Sioux City, Iowa. The tour will feature
Anthony's Mad Anthony Express, Los Tres Gusanos, the Other Half, and
Sammy and the Wabos.

&quot;I just want to go out and play for the fans,&quot; Anthony explained.
&quot;Sammy sold part of his tequila company and made a lot of money on
that, so he doesn't have to do anything if he doesn't want to. But
that's what it's all about - getting out there and playing. I'm not
doing the Van Halen tour, so Sammy asked me to come out with him
again.&quot;

He said everyone &quot;and their mother&quot; has been asking him why he's not
doing the VH reunion run, and he's not sure what to tell them. Anthony
dismissed rumors that his exclusion from the reunion tour had anything
to do with his partnering with Hagar in the Other Half.

&quot;I was touring with Sammy when Van Halen wasn't doing anything, and
people said that got under their skin, and they felt like I was
betraying them or whatever, which I really wasn't,&quot; Anthony explained.
&quot;I wasn't going to sit home and do nothing. My wife wanted my ass out
of the house. So when Sammy called and said, 'Hey, want to come out
and jam a song or two?' that's how it started. I don't know why I
wasn't asked to do the tour.&quot;

In fact, he admits he hasn't spoken to Eddie since 2004 and agrees
with many of the band's fans, who reject the notion that the
forthcoming Roth run is a bona fide reunion.

&quot;I know in the past there's been a lot of fighting and drama, but I'm
not into all of that, especially now,&quot; he said. &quot;And I'm not going to
sit there and whine about it and call these guys mother------s and the
whole bit. It is what it is, and if [Eddie] wants his kid to play with
him, fine. But they're really throwing him into the lion's den right
off the bat. This is going to be a tough enough tour for those three
guys, having not played for so long, and then throwing [Wolfgang] in
the mix? ... I hope he does OK. It's sad that the fans aren't going to
see the original lineup.&quot;

But Anthony was most upset by Van Halen's reported attempts last month
to erase him from the band's 35-year history. Fans lashed out at the
band after photos of Anthony on Van Halen's official Web site were
allegedly removed or replaced by an image of Wolfgang. The pictures
were restored within hours, soon after fans took notice and began
sounding off on various VH message boards.

&quot;When I went on the Web site, that was probably more upsetting than
anything else,&quot; he said. &quot;On the first album especially, they replaced
my picture with a picture of Wolfgang, and I was like, 'What's someone
trying to do here?' I am proud of Van Halen's history, be it good or
bad or whatever. I love everything about the band. I guess the fans
spoke out, because the next day, they changed it back. I really don't
know what to say to that. If that's the way they want to play it out,
then that's the way they'll play it out.&quot;

The tour, he said, is &quot;going to be interesting this year, because
earlier in the year, Sammy did this cruise down to Cabo San Lucas, and
he asked me if I wanted to play on the ship. I thought, 'Yeah, that'd
be cool to do,' but I didn't want to get up there and just play with
his band and do Hagar songs as I always do,&quot; Anthony said. &quot;So I
thought, 'I'll grab his guitarist Vic Johnson and his drummer David
[Lauser], and we'll learn some early Van Halen stuff,' and somebody
called it the Mad Anthony Express. We did a couple of shows and played
the really old stuff: 'D.O.A.,' 'Atomic Punk.' I lead-sang it, and it
was so much fun. So we did it again Father's Day weekend in Lake
Tahoe, and I put this thing together. We opened the show, and
everybody loved it so much, Sammy's going, 'Hey, we need to go out on
tour and open with the early stuff.' So here I go.&quot;

Anthony said the tour with Hagar will run for about a month. Then
there will be a brief break before the tour commences. They plan to
keep it going up through next summer. He also said there's a chance he
and Hagar will start working on music together and that it's possible
the duo might release a record some point down the line.

MA definitely seems like a cool guy -- it's kind of sad his only gig
is playing that awful Hagar music.

Micheal Anthony is an old sole that glows with the kindness and wisdom
of the Dali Lama. The gentleness of his nature is matched only by the
hotness of his sauce.

That being said, nobody really gives a shit he isn't around, as he is
a hack bass player famous for playing bass lines that make the guy
from U2 sound like Flea.

Oh I don't know if he'll be able to handle that. I mean, who could?!

I'm thinking they'll have Sheehan behind the curtain trying to bang

Has Anthony ever actually responded to Eddie's assertions that Anthony
contributed absolutely zero - creatively speaking - to the band? Has
Mike ever claimed to have written any of the riffs or melodies that
have been layed down on record? Has he ever said he was completely
shut out of that process by Eddie?

My sense was always that Eddie told him exactly what to play and when
to play it and wanted no input from Mike at all. That's why I found it
odd to see Eddie almost condemning Anthony for never having
contributed in the studio. It seems like Mike was always willing to
take orders as instructed and be the good, humble, loyal soldier,
private first class. But then he got slagged for never having been one
of the generals. If true, unfair.

However, if I can only see a VH line-up featuring three original
members and one new guy, I'd take Wolfgang on bass as that one new guy
over Sammy on vocals any f--kin' day. - John

I wonder if Wolfie is going to get a bass solo like Mike used to...
which wouldn't be beyond his ability considering that the only thing
Mike ever did was switch on special effects... somersault and run
around the stage... all while flogging a single string on his JD bass.

That's a good question. As far as I've ever read, no he didn't. Can
anyone post a link or interview transcript that says otherwise?

I also believe Mike was happy to play 'private, first class', as you
said, keeping his bass playing to a minimum of fuss and often playing
the root note beneath Ed's riffs and only playing anything of any real
significance during fills in live performances (Mike can indeed play
tasty fills when he wants to, live). Ed's bass performances on Sammy's
solo albums and on III are easily recognizable and a far cry from
Mike's style on the classic Roth era albums: there is quite a bit of
bass tapping and slides, much more than Mike does. It's pretty clear
that the person playing bass on those tracks thinks like a lead
player, which Mike clearly doesn't. Mike seemed content to play the
root notes under Ed's riffs and synch up with the drums as best as
possible, and that's it. Is that contributing nothing??? Well, it's a
sound that inspired millions of other configurations of rock bands in
the late 70's, 80's and even 90's, so who is to judge?

As for his signature vocals, I see Mike stepping up to the... ummm,
mic, in the studio and singing his lungs out to the lead vocals, and
then waiting for the thumbs up or down from Eddie and whoever was
producing on the other side of the glass. If they didn't like it,
they'd make him do it again, if it was to their liking, he's done for
the day and can go home.

Agreed. The Sam Halen tour is over and has been done many times. As
hard as it is to admit, there's a hierarchy in rock, and most times
bass players are at the bottom of the ladder. They're the most
forgettable and easily replaceable.

I hope not. Maybe some bass oriented jamming with Ed and Al instead. I
honestly can't believe that he's that advanced at his age that he can
whip out a solo that would better Mike Anthony's version (which often
was just noisemaking but had its moments of technical skill), which is
a version that Ed would probably never want to hear again.
