Broke the rear axle (unnoticed by me until a hadda flat- am assuming the
axle was still "solid" until the last time of levering the skewer) on my
rans stratus lwb recumbent. The original part I think). I was changinge the
tube after a second flat and mounted the wheel and noticed a severe wobble
(loose) in the wheel . Thought it might be a loose cup/cone. When taken
apart, the axle was broken through at the inner adege of the threaded
section-drive side (freewheel hub). Looks from the shine that the majority
of the break had been in place for a while. Over 2/3 of the circumferance
had the shine.  Are there any signs of impending failure other than the
drunken rider look? TIA Pat

Not to worry, the true test is to spin the axle and see whether either
end (usually the sprocket end) wobbles.  Axles don't bend, they break.
If it wobbles it is cracked.  If the ends rotate independently, it is
broken.  This can be done with a QR skewer in place.

What does recumbency have to do with broken axles?

Spell check!

The RANS Stratus [1] will put typically put 60-70% of the combined
bicycle/rider weight on the rear wheel. Unless the rider learns the
technique of pushing with both feet on the pedals to slide
himself/herself up the seat back just before traversing a bump, the
rear wheel on a LWB recumbent will also tend to be more heavily loaded
over bumps than one on a standard single diamond frame upright. All
else being equal, the rear axle on a LWB recumbent will see higher peak
stress than one on a single upright bicycle.

A proper spell checker should know that RANS is always in CAPITAL
LETTERS.

For riders who are anything other than fairly light, or
climb a lot, and use more than ~120mm rear spacing,
a freewheel hub is a warning sign of a broken axle.
They all get there eventually.

Which is why he wrote "chain tension" which is trying to bend the
axle, whereas "torque" tries to spin the wheel...

Not so-I am .1 offa ton, use C-Record freewheel rears exclusively at

there's no way to detect.  the axle fatigues, then breaks.  the chances
of detection in the cracked but pre-failure stage is slim to zero unless
you want to strip and spend a bunch of money testing.

best thing is to prevent failure completely by using a hub with
shimano-type outboard bearing, not inboard like freewheel designs, or
use a hub with an oversize axle like some of the boutiques.

that's not true.  i've bent a whole bunch of axles - not least of which

Yes, given that all else was equal.

All else meaning material, finish, heat treatment (if any), etcetera.

Chain tension bends the axle, especially when the drive side wheel bearing
is toward the middle of the axle.  Some hubs, like Campy and Hugi, have
beefed up axles to prevent this.  Others may not.  Shimano solved this
problem with their cassette hubs by moving the drive side wheel bearing
out to the end of the axle.  So broken axles with Shimano cassette hubs
are practically unheard of.

Anyway, lower gears =  more chain tension = more bending force on the
axle.

I used to think that from the old Suntour/Shimano days when I bent a few,
but now I'm not so sure.

I've been running 7-speed 135mm Phil freewheel hubs on our loaded tourers
since the mid-90's now, the first of which is still in service.
No signs of bending/breaking, despite X-country tour, a tour up theAK hiway
and numerous other tours over mixed paved/rough terrain.  This is with a
bike/rider/panniers/gear combo weighing in at over 270 lbs, sometimes over
300.

I think that the Phil axles are so over-built that the service life is very,
very long.  Now that I've said that, I'm sure one will break next summer in
the middle-of-nowhere! ;-]

I doubt it. As you note, the Phil axles are quite over-built. You'll have a
very difficult time destroying one, primarily due to the very large (and

From your post it seems you have a hub with a screw on freewheel. these
older hub types had the drive side bearings about where the freewheel
threads are so the axle is supported on bearings quite a long way inside the
drive side dropout. This has the effect of bending the axle over the drive
side bearing.

A modern cassette hub has the bearings much closer to the dropouts thus
making the axle actually unlikely to bend and break. As opposed to
inevitably destined to break even with a lightweight rider for a freewheel
hub.

This is one design inovation you can really thank Shimano for. No fashion or
marketing hype involved.

Actually, to the extent that QR compression has any effect on axle

subtracts from the tensile stress of bending which causes the fracture.

whoa there - that's a massively over-simplistic statement!  please do
/not/ make the jobstian mistake of assuming that increasing load =
increasing strength.

for statics, ok, it superimposes stress, but as above, that does /not/
increase strength.  the stress/strain graph for this kind of steel is
equal in both tension and compression.  for a bending beam, what you may
"gain" in "lack of tension" on the extension side, you're "losing" on
the "additional compression" side as you're bringing the material closer
and closer to compressive yield.  the beam will therefore yield at the
same external load.  [you can argue "increased strength" in materials
like pre-stressed concrete where one material has no tensile strength
but can be made to appear to have one by "borrowing" from the
compressive side of the graph with pre-load from the material that
/does/ have tensile strength.]

with a bike axle, the only "gain" is in fatigue where the compressive
pre-load can mitigate tensile [the commonest] fatigue initiation.

"increasing strength" statements need to be very carefully qualified.

Fine, but I doubt many folks will remove and test an axle at these
undefined intervals.  I for one, riding failure prone Campagnolo
Record hubs of old, note when the axle shows eccentricity (bent) on
the right end and replace it.  All the bent axles I have replaced were
cracked.  This is easily tested by blowing in one end while holding a
finger over the other end.  They all leak!  I have a large collection
of such axles separated and not from the past many years.

That not much strength is gained with a solid axle can be assessed by
the skewer not suffering failure when used for longer periods in a
broken axle.  There isn't much stress in that diameter for that bend
radius.

Sorry, I thought it was obvious that I was referring to fatigue.

To address the OP's claim -- assuming all axle failures are fatigue
failures, then I don't see how adding a compressive pre-load (in the
form of QR tension) can do anything other than lower the tensile
(critical) stress in a (bending) axle. I don't think it matters whether
the axle is perfectly straight to begin with. The net should be improved
(fatigue) strength.

As to a quantitative effect of QR compression on axle fatigue, I'm not
sure I have the abilities to analyze that, but the QR forces are rather
large typically, enough to elastically deform the axle -- it should have
an effect.
