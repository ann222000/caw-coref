News For the Week of Sep 30

Canada--Ontario doctors will have a comprehensive set of rules
governing all cosmetic surgery procedures in place within a year, the
president of the physicians' regulatory body has promised.

USA-- After racking up a state-record 26 malpractice judgments or
settlements over the course of eight years, the New York Department of
Health suspended Dr. Jacobs' license and initiated proceedings to
revoke it indefinitely. The famous boob doc, who performed
breast-augmentation procedures on Playboy and Cosmopolitan models,
drove a Porsche with the vanity plate &quot;BUNNYMAKR,&quot; and once held a
press conference surrounded by buxom women to celebrate the return of
silicone implants.

USA-- The Artistic Surgical Center was ordered to stop performing
surgeries because officials say it lacks a license for the procedures.
The center was performing breast enlargements, &quot;extreme makeovers&quot; and
other procedures even though the clinic was not licensed as a surgery
center.

China-- A recent survey by the Beijing-based Horizon Research
Consultancy Group has found that Chinese women want to change the
shape of their faces, while men want straighter noses. A Beijing-based
cosmetic surgeon surnamed Huang said women wanted to look more
Caucasian.

Venezuela -- President Hugo Chavez railed against a new trend in
beauty-conscious Venezuela, giving girls breast implants for their
15th birthday.

Runnin' Scared. No More Scars. A notorious boob doc is shut down with
finality. The lawsuits, however, are still ballooning

by Chris Thompson
September 25th, 2007

Last month, the Voice described swanky Upper East Side plastic surgeon
Brad Jacobs's fight to save his career (&quot;Plastic Surgeon to the
Scars,&quot; August 29).

After racking up a state-record 26 malpractice judgments or
settlements over the course of eight years, Jacobs was targeted by the
New York Department of Health, which suspended his license and
initiated proceedings to revoke it indefinitely. This was a body blow
to the famous boob doc, who performed breast-augmentation procedures
on Playboy and Cosmopolitan models, drove a Porsche with the vanity
plate &quot;BUNNYMAKR,&quot; and once held a press conference surrounded by
buxom women to celebrate the return of silicone implants. But even as
women claimed that he had butchered their bodies and performed surgery
while high on speed, a determined Jacobs appealed the decision and
vowed to see his good name restored.

&quot;We certainly are well on our way to presenting a picture of Dr.
Jacobs that is diametrically opposed to this handful of disgruntled
patients,&quot; said his lawyer, Michael Kelton, earlier this summer. &quot;The
case is going well—I will prevail!&quot; Jacobs added.

But it was not to be. On September 13, Jacobs surrendered his license
to practice medicine. A spokesman for the Department of Health
announced that Jacobs &quot;admits that he cannot successfully defend
against the charges&quot; of gross negligence, negligence and incompetence,
and moral unfitness. The man who led one of the most fabulous careers
in cosmetic surgery has retired to Long Island in disgrace.

&quot;Dr. Jacobs came to realize that he could not get a fair hearing from
the Department of Health,&quot; said Kelton in a prepared statement. &quot;Under
increasingly dire financial circumstances. . . . Dr. Jacobs made the
painful decision to end his nightmare and to begin the process of
moving on with his life.&quot;

Of the dozens of complaints against Jacobs, the case of Brittany
Hendricks was easily the most sensational. Hendricks, a former Las
Vegas stripper and crystal-meth addict, arrived in New York in 2004 to
get a nose job. According to a deposition she prepared during her
lawsuit, Jacobs set her up in an apartment near his office, where
Hendricks, Jacobs, and the doctor's girlfriend smoked crystal meth for
hours the night before the surgery. As theVoice reported last month,
Jacobs and his girlfriend allegedly had sex in front of Hendricks and,
when they couldn't get her to join in, allegedly asked her to
videotape them. According to Hendricks's deposition, Jacobs partied
till 4:30 in the morning, caught a few hours of sleep, and did a quick
hit of crystal meth before reporting to his office.

Later that day, Hendricks testified, Jacobs gave her a nose job that
ultimately mutilated her and left one nostril permanently detached
from her face. When she saw the work he had done, Hendricks went back
to Jacobs's apartment in despair, where Jacobs allegedly shot her full
of drugs and then had sex with her. Jacobs has denied all of
Hendricks's charges and called her &quot;a blithering drug addict.&quot; But
Hendricks's accusations were clearly the centerpiece of the state's
case.

Although Jacobs's career is over, the lawsuits are far from finished.
At least five patients still have malpractice cases pending against
him, including charges that he left a surgical sponge inside a woman's
breast, cut out healthy tissue during a lumpectomy but left the tumor
behind, and deliberately inserted implants that were too large,
seriously damaging the breasts of three women. Jacobs has denied the
latter charge, but acknowledged that he missed the tumor and left some
gauze in a patient's breast. Meanwhile, in response to theVoice's
initial story, Jacobs's then girlfriend (now his wife) recently sent a
letter to Hendricks and her lawyer, proclaiming her intent to sue for
&quot;libel, slander, and defamation of character.&quot;

Last December, Jacobs was riding so high that he wrote an open letter
to Britney Spears, offering free surgery to touch up her abdominal
muscles. &quot;My trained surgeon's eye uncovered all the enduring effects
of your recent C-section birthing experience,&quot; Jacobs wrote.
&quot;Therefore, as one of your devoted fans who happens to be a leading
plastic surgeon, I'd like to give you a holiday present—a tummy tuck
that will restore your midriff. . . . I'd like to give 'sexy' back to
you.&quot;

Clinic Ordered To Stop Surgeries

Thursday, Sep 27, 2007 - 08:30 AM Updated: 09:06 AM

The state Department Of Health has ordered a medical clinic to stop
performing surgeries because officials say it lacks a license for the
procedures.

Investigators say the Artistic Surgical Center was performing breast
enlargements, &quot;extreme makeovers&quot; and other procedures even though the
clinic was not licensed as a surgery center.

The clinic is run by Dr. Curtis Perry, who is licensed to practice
medicine. But under state law, a facility must be licensed as a
surgery center to perform most procedures that require sedation or
anesthesiology.

Perry is an ear, nose and throat doctor though his web site claims
he's certified to perform facial and plastic surgery. The Department
of Health says he's not a Board Certified plastic surgeon.

Health officials say the department began investigating after a woman
complained about postoperative complications.

The Department of Health has received 11 complaints against the
doctor, most had to do with him allegedly misrepresenting his
credentials.

NBC 10 called the Perry home but the woman who answered had no
comment.

Poll: Chinese women want to look more Caucasian

By Shan Juan (China Daily)

2007-09-25

Chinese women want to change the shape of their faces, while men want
straighter noses, a recent survey by the Beijing-based Horizon
Research Consultancy Group has found.

The survey polled nearly 1,600 people aged 18 and 55 from Shanghai,
Tianjin and Shenzhen. The results were given on the independent
polling company's website.

Almost 33 percent of women wanted to improve the contours of their
faces, the survey found. Eyelid surgery was second most popular at 29
percent. A face shaped like a goose egg and double eyelids were
favorite, it showed.

Fat removal from the stomach and waist ranked third, followed by
liposuction of the legs. Nose sculpting came last among the top five
most sought-after procedures for women.

A Beijing-based cosmetic surgeon surnamed Huang said women wanted to
look more Caucasian.

They particularly wanted to look leggy, busty and skinny, he said.

In comparison, men were less concerned about fat and only 7.5 percent
would consider liposuction, the survey said.

Nearly 45 percent of men said they wanted to straighten their noses to
give them a more masculine look.

Nearly 33 percent said they would consider double eyelid surgery,
followed by cosmetic improvement of the teeth and face shaping.

Many men did not want their partner to have breast implants, even
though women did it to please them, cosmetic surgeon Huang said.

There are about 1 million plastic surgery operations performed every
year in China, according to official estimates.

More women than men choose to go under the knife.

Chavez rails at teenage breast implants gift fad

Sep 24, 2007
By Saul Hudson

CARACAS (Reuters) - President Hugo Chavez railed against a new trend
in beauty-conscious Venezuela, giving girls breast implants for their
15th birthday.

&quot;Now some people think, 'My daughter's turning 15, let's give her
breast enlargements.' That's horrible. It's the ultimate
degeneration,&quot; Chavez said late on Sunday on his weekly TV show that
lasted a record eight hours.

Venezuela is well known for its beauty queens, who have regularly won
world crowns, and many women have plastic surgery in the oil-rich
country where there is widespread spending on consumer items that
would be considered luxuries elsewhere.

But Chavez, the anti-U.S., self-styled revolutionary who came to
office in 1999, is seeking to change those attitudes to create what he
calls the &quot;new man&quot; to build a socialist society in this South
American nation.

Chavez complained about the new fad of giving the plastic surgery
operation at 15 -- when Latin Americans celebrate a girl's
coming-of-age -- during a diatribe against what he says are
Western-imposed consumerist icons such as Barbie dolls.

While breast implants are advertised on TV and banks offer special
credit lines for such operations, if girls do get the enlargements
they are not expected to become sexually active afterward.

Venezuelans' have a habit of avid consumerism since the 1970s oil boom
in the OPEC nation. They have won the nickname of the &quot;Give-Me-Twos&quot;
in the tourist destination of Florida for buying double the amount of
typical consumers.

Breast implants cost thousands of dollars in Venezuela.Chavez's
answer? He has told his supporters to give away any extra goods they
do not need, urging them to leave out in town squares items such as
fans or refrigerators.

&quot;I am calling on your conscience, fathers of this country, mothers of
this country, they are our sons, they are our daughters,&quot; Chavez said.

Still, Chavez, who happily describes himself as ugly, may struggle to
change Venezuelans' mind-set to spending on plastic surgery.

In elevators, at huge, jam-packed shopping malls, women can be
overheard openly boasting about their recent, conspicuous operations.

New rules to police cosmetic surgery

Promise comes in wake of woman's death following liposuction surgery
at Toronto clinic

Sep 25, 2007 04:30 AM Joseph Hall

Health Reporter

Ontario doctors will have a comprehensive set of rules governing all
cosmetic surgery procedures in place within a year, the president of
the physicians' regulatory body has promised.

Admitting the rapidly expanding field has outpaced the medical
community's ability to properly regulate and monitor it, College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario president Dr. Jeffrey Turnbull said
new rules on all cosmetic procedures will be in place by next fall.

&quot;We're going to push that very, very quickly,&quot; Turnbull said
yesterday.

&quot;I would anticipate that you're going to have something sooner than a
year.&quot; Turnbull's promise comes in the wake of a Toronto real estate
agent's death last week following routine liposuction surgery.

Krista Stryland, 32, a popular and successful realtor, died after
undergoing the fat removal procedure Thursday at the Toronto Cosmetic
Clinic on Yonge St. just north of Finch Ave.

Clinic officials did not return requests for comment yesterday.

Dr. James Edwards, regional supervising coroner for Toronto East, said
his office is investigating the death but that it would be several
weeks before a decision is made on whether to call an inquest.

Edwards said an autopsy was conducted Friday on Stryland but that it
would still be weeks before a complete set of blood and tissue tests
could determine the cause of death.

Turnbull said the college, recognizing the need to move in the area,
began working on the issue in April, setting up a cosmetic surgery
task force with a broad mandate to forge new regulations and policing
procedures.

&quot;This is a very unfortunate reminder that we have to get going
faster,&quot; he said of Stryland's death.

Turnbull's pledge also comes almost 18 years after an Ontario inquest
jury recommended the college introduce programs regulating quality
assurance, training requirements and monitoring procedures for
cosmetic surgeons and their facilities.

The college responded to that 1989 inquest with the simple requirement
that doctors moving from other specialties into cosmetic surgery
notify the regulatory body of the shift.

&quot;Since that time, however, there has been a wide explosion of
different plastic surgical procedures, not only in the amount but the
nature,&quot; Turnbull said.

&quot;And the college is now trying to respond to that with enhanced
policies that allow us not only to regulate and watch what is
happening out there ... but to ensure that those individuals have the
necessary skills and competency to do it.&quot;

Currently, Turnbull said, the college does not even have a handle on
which doctors are performing what surgery and where they are doing it.
He said information on physician practices usually comes from
hospitals or OHIP billing records. Much of the cosmetic surgery
preformed in Ontario is done outside hospitals and the medicare
payment system.

&quot;Our first challenge is to gather that formal information as to what's
being done out there, who's doing it and what's their training,&quot; he
said.

&quot;I should be able to answer that question and we need that formal
data.&quot; Turnbull said the task force will also be outlining public
education programs and will set up monitoring procedures for both
doctors and their facilities.

&quot;Some of this may need legislative changes to allow us to do it,&quot; he
said.

Turnbull said cosmetic surgery today covers a wide range of
procedures, from simple botox injections to complex facial
reconstruction.

He said different levels of training should be required for each
procedure and that the type of facilities needed for each should be
spelled out in the new regulations.

In the meantime, anyone seeking to have liposuction or other cosmetic
surgery preformed in Canada must follow one cardinal rule, experts in
the field say.

&quot;Unfortunately it's `consumer beware,'&quot; said Dr. Don Lalonde,
immediate past-president of the Canadian Society of Plastic Surgeons.

The vast majority of doctors advertising themselves as cosmetic
surgeons in hospitals or clinics have undergone extensive and
recognized training in plastic surgery, Lalonde said.

But there are many doctors who are trained in other specialties – or
who are simply family doctors – who have hung up cosmetic surgery
shingles in the simple hope of creating a more lucrative practice, he
said.

Lalonde said his group believes that all cosmetic surgeons should have
a plastic surgery designation, which in
Canada takes at least five years of residency training after receiving
a medical degree.

Lalonde said fewer than one in 1,000 people undergoing liposuction
procedures will die of complications from the surgery, which uses
tubes inserted into fat deposits to suck out the unwanted tissue.

He said complications leading to injury or death usually involve
pulmonary embolisms – blood clots in the lungs – post-operative
staphylococcus infections or abdominal perforations.
