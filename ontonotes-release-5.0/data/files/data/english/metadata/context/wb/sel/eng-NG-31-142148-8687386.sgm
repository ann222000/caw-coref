When will the West awaken? Of course, I am not talking about your ordinary
citizen or soldier but about our Talking Heads and other gate-keeping
chatterers who simply refuse to &quot;get it.&quot;

Cambridge University Press not only recalls but has promised to pulp the
book that authoritatively documents one Saudi billionaire's funding of
terror; many anti-jihadic writers and all our leading mainstream media have
privately apologized to this same billionaire. Only Rachel Ehrenfeld has
refused to &quot;apologize&quot; for telling the truth and has counter-sued him in an
American court of law based on her First Amendment right to tell the truth.
(She was initially sued in London where she lost by default; she chose not
to appear in court).

At a recent conference in Los Angeles, sponsored by the American Freedom
Alliance, Daniel Pipes announced his intention to start a legal defense bail
fund for those who are sued by Islamists and their Western apologists for
telling the truth. Not a moment too soon--although, regrettably, perhaps too
late for Ehrenfeld. And, The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)
has begun a process of legal intimidation against my esteemed colleague,
Robert Spencer. Accordingly, David Horowitz has launched a legal defense
fund for Spencer. I have pledged money to this and advise us all to do the
same.

Before this war is over, we will each need legal defense funds. And that's
if we're lucky. Those in the Islamic East need bodyguards and air-lifts to
safety in the West. But there is a pattern emerging in the West which we
ignore at our own peril.

For example, a leading American publisher of law enforcement and
counter-terrorism titles cancelled Dr. Nancy Kobrin's book about Islamic
suicide terrorism. I wrote the Introduction for it and together Dr. Kobrin
and I &quot;went public.&quot; A number of other publishers emerged--but they quickly
disappeared too.

I have been trying to find a publisher for a book titled The Islamification
of America and guess what? No takers so far. I am ready to self-publish the
work.

This is a very special kind of Gulag. The internet provides us with the most
sophisticated and universal of platforms for such 21st-century &quot;samizdats.&quot;

We who write in the America are so far lucky. We are legally intimidated. We
are silenced on campuses due to the &quot;politically correct&quot; ideologies that
rule there. True, the American Jewish Committee recently paid for a full
page New York Times ad signed by American college presidents who oppose the
eternally-intended British boycott of Israeli academics and who bravely
suggest that they be boycotted too. Well and good.

But guess who did not sign? Harvard, Yale, Vassar, California State
University at Berkeley, Los Angeles, UCLA, San Francisco State, and of
course, Norman Finkelstein's old perch, De Paul in Chicago. (Maybe I'm
wrong, maybe they did sign in a Harry Potter kind of way in invisible ink).

But this is nothing compared to what Muslim intellectuals (and women and
human beings) must endure in the Islamic world today. If they are lucky,
they live in exile or in hiding and write under pseudonyms. A handful write
openly and travel with bodyguards.

I am just told that Taslima Nasrin was, yet again, attacked by one hundred
angry Muslim fanatics as she held a press conference in Hyderabad, India, to
launch her new book. Nasrin, a physician and a feminist author who was born
in Bangladesh, was once nearly lynched by a mighty mob there. She fled her
country and lived in exile in Sweden and in hiding. Now, she lives in India
where dozens of Muslim protesters, led by three lawmakers physically
attacked her and her co-panelists. They demanded that India extradite her to
Bangladesh (I guess for the kind of justice Bangladesh has meted out to that
other hero, parliamentarian Chadhury, who was imprisoned and tortured
because he wanted to visit Israel).

Her works have been banned in Bangladesh. She is being accused of being
&quot;anti-Islam.&quot;

Islamists are moving against us in the West very carefully and in legal
ways. In the overly revered &quot;Third World&quot; they speak in violence, their
speech IS violence.

I hope that Taslima Nasrin remains safe and in India. And that the sleeping
giant awakens before we have all been sued and censored into silence.

United States is the main fanacier of terror. No other terrorist has
come even close to killing a million people like George Bush has.

Liar. You are the main producer of lies on these newsgroups. That has been
demonstrated time and time again.

To date George W. Bush and his Jewish cohorts have slaughtered a million
Iraqis, another nearly four thousand Americans, and crippled about 50,000
Americans who will be on the dole for the rest of their lives.

If that is not a war criminal behavior I do not what a criminal is!

USA is also financing terror in many Latin American countries including
Cuba, Columbia, Venezuela. To say nothing about the terror being finaced by
CIA in Asia and Middle East
