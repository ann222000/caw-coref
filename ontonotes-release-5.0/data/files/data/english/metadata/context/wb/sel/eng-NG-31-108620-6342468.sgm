Though since asteroids are far more useful long term than just another
planet, perhaps Phobos is more interesting than Mars.

Besides which, for any serious settlement of Mars, Phobos will be
essential. Also, learning how to land on Phobos and extracting water
would be much more valuable than learning how to suck up Martian CO2.

So why is that "the real goal"?  Please explain.  No, it's not self-evident
that flags and footprints on Mars trump all other goals in space.

Actually, nobody knows that for sure -- their origin is a bit of a
mystery, and that's only the leading theory.  (The main difficulty with
that one is that it's not clear how a pair of captured asteroids end up in
low orbits that are almost perfectly circular and equatorial.)

There is also some possibility that there are ancient Mars rocks -- older
than anything now easily findable on Mars -- on their surfaces.

And there is a strong possibility that they have significant water
content, in which case their resources might be quite important to future
transportation to and from Mars.  (And elsewhere -- in energy terms, they
are closer to Earth orbit than the surface of the Moon is.)  Of course,
that's not relevant to a flags-and-footprints Mars mission... if that's
all you care about.

I'm hoping that they'll notice that it's about 6x cheaper to send an ion
drive over to get stuff from Phobos than from Earth if you want to mount
an expedition to Mars.

A chip off the old Phobos block would make a *great* rad-shield for
handling solar flares for a manned martian trip! Just maneuver it to
high earth orbit, turn it into sand bags and lag the outside of your
craft with it. Doesn't cost much delta-v, since most of the delta-v to
get to Mars is spent getting up from LEO.

Or if you don't want to do that, collecting Phobos rock on the way back
for the same purpose would work great too.

(And it would be even better if it turned out Phobos really does have
accessible ice...)

I think Phobos is going to be cooked out at the surface, but there
should be some accessible hydration. However, we are lucky to have a
pair of moons like Phobos and Deimos, and certainly they will be major
players in the eventual colonization of Ceres. Earth Moon Phobos Ceres.

It's not about science, it's about economics. Space is really empty, and
the biggest sources of useful materials for travelling between Earth and
Mars are Phobos and Deimos.

If you don't have a *good* source of materials other than Mars and
Earth, then the cost of the trip goes up many-fold.

Even for a flags and footprints mission or a permanent stay on Mars you
*do* care *very* much about trip costs, since that determines how many
people get to go to Mars and other factors such as radiation safety
during the trip.

As an example, a Mars cycler really needs lots of radiation shielding;
the only sensible location to get that is Phobos or Deimos. Most of the
mass of a Mars cycler would be radiation shielding. Mars cyclers enable
Martian colonisation and Phobos and Deimos in turn enable them.

Agree there, but there are asteroids which are nearer than Phobos and
Deimos.

However, P&amp;D have a few big advantages over other NEOs:

1. They are probably colder, meaning there is a greater chance of
finding water not too deep.
2. They are orbiting a "well". Whilst this makes them slightly harder
to reach, especially with ion engines, it opens up great possibilities
for tether based transportation systems.
3. If by some chance someone wants to drop into Mars, a return mission
can be accomplished using a mere 600m/s delta V of rocket propulsion.

I've run across mention of proposals suggesting the first manned base
for Mars work should be on Phobos.  Surface samples could be returned
to a bio lab on Phobos -- isolated to prevent forward- and back-
contamination, but much more easily serviced and operated.  (I guess
if you're really paranoid about contamination, you could put the
manned base on Deimos and the lab on Phobos.  You'd could have almost-
continuous line-of-sight communications between the two, couldn't
you?) The base would have access to resources on Phobos that might not
exist in quantity on the Martian surface, but perhaps also have access
to Martian materials to some extent, where they don't exist in useable
concentrations on Phobos.

It's all too easy to argue that you might as well plop the whole
mission down on Mars, if you're going to go all that distance anyway.
Yet, the same people who'd say that probably parrot the old chestnut
that LEO is halfway to anywhere in the solar system.  You have to
consider that the Mars surface-orbit obstacle is roughly on the order
of the Earth surface-orbit (easier in some ways, I suppose, but
logistically harder in others given that easy resupply from Earth is a
non-starter.)  It's not all about "to", there's also "from".

A lot of delta vee can be accomplished by Martian aerobraking +
exploitation of the Oberth effect. The diagram on the page you cited
seems to use these devices: the path includes a near Mars perigee.

This makes Phobos and Deimos two of the more attractive small objects.

No, doesn't have to be either.  Ice with a thick regolith blanket on top
can outgas very slowly in near-Mars conditions.  People have modeled this
(see the Phobos/Deimos paper in "Resources of Near-Earth Space", Lewis et
al); it seems to be possible for Phobos or Deimos to have primordial ice
in the interior, even billions of years after capture.

A related possibility is not bulk ice, but the sort of water-rich
carbonaceous gunk that made up the Tagish Lake meteorite.  Same low
density (it's quite porous and the bulk density is in the same ballpark as
Phobos), and it's 10-20% fairly-tightly-bound water.

Why in the world should that be the real goal?  I see no point in that
at all.  The real goal is developing space, and Phobos and Deimos are
huge, relatively easily-accessible caches of valuable resources.  Yes,
Mars has some resources too, but they're at the bottom of a substantial
gravity well, and most of the valuable ones are probably quite a bit
more diffuse.

First, I think your statement about little useful science from them is

If Phobos is around 5,000 cubic kilometers, that's maybe 500 cubic
kilometers of water.  Isn't that roughly on the order of the amount
hypothesized for all of the Moon in the best-case scenarios?

A 10-20% water composition seems highly unlikely on the face of it,
but carbonaceous chondrites have been found on Earth with that much
water.  And that's after they have not only been at least as close to
the sun as Earth is, and exposed to vacuum, for a very long time
(which would tend to volatilize any weakly-bound H2O), but also after
the heating of atmospheric entry -- heat that doesn't necessarily
penetrate very deeply.

A "live off the land" manned mission for Phobos might be considerably
easier than any for Mars.  I wonder if developing Phobos for purposes
of building up and replenishing an Earth-Mars cycler might, in the
long run, outperform any other approach to that problem.

Maybe drilling into Phobos wouldn't be necessary at first.  It appears
to be covered with ordinary regolith.  There might be lots of easily
scooped rocks in a range of sizes in that regolith layer, with as much
water content as the carbonaceous chondrites that land on Earth.
Water bearing rocks might not be very deep at all -- after all, these
carbonaceous chondrites we've found here on Earth still have water in
them after just being lonely rocks circling in raw sunlight for eons,
often within Earth orbit.  Could the surface of Phobos be a more
dessicating environment than that?

Phobos' ISRU potential for building up Aldrin Cyclers continues to
intrigue me.  Electrolysis of the conjectured water would give you
fuel and oxidizer.  (Forget about liquefying it -- since you're
already in microgravity and not in an atmosphere, inflatables might do
fine as fuel tanks, and you might cool the engines just by shutting
them off and gliding until it was safe to fire them again.)  Fiber-
reinforced ice made from this water might be used to flesh out a shell
for a bare-bones Aldrin cycler, creating a pressure vessel with lots
of radiation shielding.  With a light internal layer of insulation you
might have a rather toasty-warm space igloo cycler.  Spin it up and
you have gravity.  A thin outer layer of some IR reflective material
might reduce losses from sublimation to the point where external
maintenance of the shell is a relative non-issue.  Another outer-layer
concept: regolith + binder.  A few years back, I was told at a space
robotics conference that the binder for brick-making purposes could be
as little as 1% of the total mass of resulting substance.

The energy requirements for water-based ISRU on Phobos might be
relatively modest -- you'd be powdering rocks to get the water out,
but you wouldn't be melting out metals and refining them.  The main
challenges are probably in designing equipment so intelligent and
robust that you can just leave it to its resource extraction tasks on
Phobos for years at a stretch, with minimal monitoring and control
from Earth.  It's gotta be smarter than your average bear, and
probably a lot tougher, too.  (Probably very energy-efficient as well,
given how much weaker sunlight is out at Mars orbit.)

Perhaps sample return missions to Phobos, extended presence on the
Moon, and a few scale-model tests on NEAs will provide the right ISRU
learning laboratory for figuring out how to exploit Phobos for
eventual cycler-based manned Mars missions and more.  It might
naturally fall right out of doing only a little more than what people
are already seriously planning.

EXACTLY

For some people the "real goal" is to put some guy over
there even if it is OBVIOUS that we do not have any technology
to put humans in Mars now, or in 20 years.

Going to the moon (3 days trip, + some weeks staying there)
is NOTHING against going to mars, where we have to develop
a human rated transportation system that will work for:
8 months trip to there
16 months work there
8 months trip back.

This is 32 months, i.e. around 2.5 YEARS in no gravity or
in very low gravity. Note that NO HUMAN has been more
than 13-14 month (I do not remember the record but it is
in this range) in space. And the guy was seriouslly ILL after
that trip.

What happens after 2 years?

All human technology can do NOW is to put around
500 Kg in Mars.

To sustain several people for 16 MONTHS we would need
TONS and TONS of supplies!!!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;There's very little usefull science

&gt; Actually, nobody knows that for sure -- their origin is a bit of a
&gt; mystery, and that's only the leading theory.  (The main difficulty with
&gt; that one is that it's not clear how a pair of captured asteroids end up in
&gt; low orbits that are almost perfectly circular and equatorial.)

&gt; There is also some possibility that there are ancient Mars rocks -- older
&gt; than anything now easily findable on Mars -- on their surfaces.

&gt; And there is a strong possibility that they have significant water
&gt; content, in which case their resources might be quite important to future
&gt; transportation to and from Mars.  (And elsewhere -- in energy terms, they
&gt; are closer to Earth orbit than the surface of the Moon is.)  Of course,
&gt; that's not relevant to a flags-and-footprints Mars mission... if that's
&gt; all you care about.
">

This is a pipe dream. No humans will go to Mars within the next
30 years.

AND

WE DO NOT NEED TO GO THERE. The mars rovers have demonstrated that
we can send virtual beings controlled by us safely here, that can do
the SAME exploration that a human would do but for much longer periods.

The mars rovers are working now for more than 3 years and they go on and
on!!!

They need ZERO supplies! The get their energy from the sun, and even
if they were built for 3 months, they are STILL WORKING 3 years later.
Imagine how long we could drive robots designed for 3 years!

&gt; concept: regolith + binder.  A few years back, I was told at a space
&gt; robotics conference that the binder for brick-making purposes could be
&gt; as little as 1% of the total mass of resulting substance.

&gt; The energy requirements for water-based ISRU on Phobos might be
&gt; relatively modest -- you'd be powdering rocks to get the water out,
&gt; but you wouldn't be melting out metals and refining them.  The main
&gt; challenges are probably in designing equipment so intelligent and
&gt; robust that you can just leave it to its resource extraction tasks on
&gt; Phobos for years at a stretch, with minimal monitoring and control
&gt; from Earth.  It's gotta be smarter than your average bear, and
&gt; probably a lot tougher, too.  (Probably very energy-efficient as well,
&gt; given how much weaker sunlight is out at Mars orbit.)

&gt; Perhaps sample return missions to Phobos, extended presence on the
&gt; Moon, and a few scale-model tests on NEAs will provide the right ISRU
&gt; learning laboratory for figuring out how to exploit Phobos for
&gt; eventual cycler-based manned Mars missions and more.  It might
&gt; naturally fall right out of doing only a little more than what people
&gt; are already seriously planning.
">

The benefit of drilling into Phobos was to allow easy transfer between
up and down tethers. But that can wait till later.

Processing loose packed regolith under 0.001g is not something we have
experience of, but it might well be easier than zero g.

My assumption is that, rightly or wrongly, the moon will be developed
before Phobos. Hence missions of increasing capability would visit
Phobos.

1. A crew of about 16 in two rotating hab modules, protected each by
about 450 tons of lunar ice. At Phobos, they drive in two piles,
probably several tens of metres deep, and perhaps 400m apart. A beam
joins the two piles, along which mechanical diggers can scoop out
regolith. These will need a slightly modified scoop. They can scoop
over an area of 1 hectare, and drop the regolith where needed. It'll
take about 15 seconds to drop a bucket load.

Buckets get dropped either into a boiler, which heats the regolith to
extract water for electrolyis. Or into "builders merchants" rubble
bags. Except these would be about 4mx4mx2m and mass 64 tons when full.
The mission will bring about 10,000 of these, which would be filled up
over the following 2 years.

The crew will maintain the equipment, and use electrolyzed water as
fuel to make the occassional trip to Mars surface.

2. A much larger ship arrives. A mini-torus masses about 80,000 tons,
without the shield. It'll arrive with a crew of about 2,000, who would
shelter in "storm shelters" in the event of solar radiation. Once at
Mars, the pre-prepared sacks of regolith are inserted into the frame
of the shield. This space station has the resources to begin a proper
exploration and colonisation of Mars Space (not just Mars).

Probably no point though- the delta-v to return to Earth is low enough
that steam rockets have enough Isp. The mass fraction achievable with
water rockets is pretty high and this compensates to a large degree for
the lower Isp. Conversely the equipment necessary to generate enough
power to electrolyze water is rather high; and this equipment would need

Taxi delta-v from Aldrin cyclers to earth isn't too bad.

But from cycler to Mars is a different story. The 2 1/7 year period
orbit has an apohelion in the main belt. The cycler orbit crosses Mars'
orbit at a large angle. The taxi delta-v for Aldrin cycler to Mars is
much higher.

Also, to stay in synch with both earth and Mars, a cycler needs to
rotate its line of apsides on a regular basis. Some of this can be
accomplished with gravity assists from earth and Mars. But rocket burns
are still necessary to adjust the Aldrin cycler orbit. If the cycler is
quite massive, you'd want high ISP burns unless your rocket engines are
huge.

I think you can make the argument that Aldrin cyclers are very much a
second or third generation system. Simply throwing water/rock at the
problems (delivered to LEO from Phobos or Deimos) solves all the
radiation issues and propellant issues for hohmann transfers. Even
artificial gravity centrifuges don't cost as much when you aren't
launching propellant for them, so the trip becomes just tedious rather
than inherently life-threatening.

By the time you build an Aldrin cycler you may well have sufficient
equipment at Mars or in LEO to permit manufacturing of hydrogen from
off-earth resources, giving higher delta-v. It's just you probably don't
want to have to start out that way.

Googling on "chondrites" and "extract water" yields mostly handwaving
of the sort you can find plenty of here.  But maybe some paydirt (as
it were) as well:

http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/864Howe.pdf

After pitching a micro-wave based thruster for MAPPER, a self-
refueling asteroid hopper, Howe and Jackson have this to say about
extracting water:

"Water extraction and accumulation for refueling

"The added advantage of the microwave thruster is the potential
duality of the system.  In 1985, Dr. T. Meek of the Los Alamos
National Laboratory (LANL) demonstrated the ability to extract water
from simulated lunar soil using 2.45 GHz microwaves [12].  Microwaves
readily couple to the water trapped in soils.  According to Meek,
using conventional means to heat the soil would require 10,000 times
more energy than using the microwaves to selectively heat the water in
the soil. The results of Dr. Meek's work clearly demonstrated that
actual lunar soil was remarkably receptive to heating by the
microwaves as seen in Figure 17. Within 10 s, a 1 cm3 sample was
melted into a glasslike droplet. His studies also indicated that the
microwaves would penetrate to a depth of around 30 cm in the regolith
bearing a few per cent water - this result, however, is dependent upon
the water content of the soil and the mineralogical make-up. Thus, we
will examine the potential of reconfiguring the microwave thruster so
that the microwaves can be directly sent into the soil of a
carbonaceous chondrite (CC) asteroid."

"[12] Meek, T., et al., "Microwave Processing of Lunar Materials:
Potential Applications," Proceedings of Lunar Bases and Space
Activities of the 21st Century, W.W. Mendell editor, Lunar Planetary
Institute, 1985."

(Intriguingly, Howe and Jackson suggest that a MAPPER probe could be
as light at 100kg.  Hm ... isn't that in the ballpark for what you can
send to Mars orbit on a Dnepr?  Problem is, I suspect, that Dneprs
fail a lot, the proposed MAPPER hardware is powered by RTGs, and
hardening an RTG against all launch failure modes might add a lot to
the payload without adding much mission value.)

Anyway, getting the water out once you have regolith in hand doesn't
seem like the big problem.  Developing the materials processing gear
-- the "in hand" part -- does.

You might be able simulate almost 5 seconds of Phobos gravity in the
Bremen drop tower, using weak thrusters installed on the experiment
capsule, just to prove out some concepts at a small scale.  Yet more
scale-model development might be done with sounding rockets.

Doing serious development would seem to require a substantial
microgravity project -- a lotta dirt, in a slowly rotating centrifuge,
up there somewhere.  Maybe it means lifting a lot of Phobos regolith
simulant to orbit, from the Earth or the Moon -- or maybe from a
fairly massive sample return (crudely scooped, and even that might be
tricky) from a Phobos-like asteroid or from Phobos itself.  The space
logistics leverage gained from any such an investment might be
enormous compared to the investment, however.  (Or so I think.  But
who asks me?)

Presumably with some loss of efficiency.  I'm no big fan of trying to
get water out of lunar soil anyway -- it's very dry.  However, if
you're talking about some substance that's 10-20% water, shouldn't the
behavior be different?  I.e., you'd get bulk heating, but wouldn't you
get a lot more water release?  Maybe rather than fusing into something
like glass, as with lunar soil, it would popcorn somewhat, releasing
water vapor in the process?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Oh, and in case you didn't know, 2.45 GHz microwaves don't

Yes, you're right, it's dipole heating.  But whatever -- let's go back
to the question: can you use microwaving to get significant amounts of
water out of carbonaceous chondrites with relatively little energy
input compared to other methods?

The main industrial purpose for extracting water from rocks, AFAIK, is
in drying coal before burning it.  They don't use microwave heating to
do that, probably because it's both inefficient (more energy would go
into it than would be saved) and a combustion threat.  However, water
is not a precious substance on Earth.

Loose packed probably isn't too hard, just scoop it up.

If it's rock, that's a different thing- the difficulty is getting
yourself attached to start with. Maybe a shaped charge could pulverise a
section of the rock to enable you to get dug in/fixed to phobos to start
with; once you have purchase, chisels would be expected to work. Once
you're dug in or you have attached yourself to a dirty great big rock,
there's fewer issues, you're not going anywhere and you can chisel away
at the surface and break bits off.

I see no reason to assume that. Man needs to go where the assays say he
should go, not where some five-year plan says he should go. If phobos
has water in macroscopic quantities then we go there. If the moon has
water in macroscopic quantities we go there. Same for any other material
that seems to be useful in space.

Phobos is a cheap destination, ion drives and some RCS is all you need
to get from MEO to Phobos and back. The low surface gravity is a big
plus for transport. The only major downside is the greater distance; but
we've done remote operations on Mars before, so there is experience of that.

The bottom line is that humans are very resource-poor in space right
now. To expand mans reach we need to grab something to pull ourselves up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; readily couple to the water trapped in soils.  According to Meek,
&gt; &gt; &gt; using conventional means to heat the soil would require 10,000 times
&gt; &gt; &gt; more energy than using the microwaves to selectively heat the water in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the soil.

&gt; First, I didn't write that, the authors of the paper did.

&gt; &gt; This is absurd.  Microwaving lunar soil will not selectively
&gt; &gt; heat water.

&gt; No, but it will heat the water even as it heats other things in it.
&gt; Water is 10-20%, presumably, of Phobos.  What's the fraction of other
&gt; compounds subject to heating?  Is it significant?

&gt; &gt; Microwaves at that frequency will predominantly interact
&gt; &gt; with lunar soil by heating extremely small metal inclusions.

&gt; Is that better or worse for getting water out?  Also consider context:
&gt; whatever Meek said, he was talking about lunar soil, not Phobos
&gt; regolith, which is assumed to be water-rich for purposes of this
&gt; discussion.

&gt; &gt; What water there is in lunar soil is trapped in minerals, not
&gt; &gt; in macroscopic droplets, so any heat deposited into it would
&gt; &gt; cause bulk heating anyway.

&gt; Presumably with some loss of efficiency.  I'm no big fan of trying to
&gt; get water out of lunar soil anyway -- it's very dry.  However, if
&gt; you're talking about some substance that's 10-20% water, shouldn't the
&gt; behavior be different?  I.e., you'd get bulk heating, but wouldn't you
&gt; get a lot more water release?  Maybe rather than fusing into something
&gt; like glass, as with lunar soil, it would popcorn somewhat, releasing
&gt; water vapor in the process?

&gt; &gt; Oh, and in case you didn't know, 2.45 GHz microwaves don't
&gt; &gt; heat water by some resonance effect.

&gt; Yes, you're right, it's dipole heating.  But whatever -- let's go back
&gt; to the question: can you use microwaving to get significant amounts of
&gt; water out of carbonaceous chondrites with relatively little energy
&gt; input compared to other methods?

&gt; The main industrial purpose for extracting water from rocks, AFAIK, is
&gt; in drying coal before burning it.  They don't use microwave heating to
&gt; do that, probably because it's both inefficient (more energy would go
&gt; into it than would be saved) and a combustion threat.  However, water
&gt; is not a precious substance on Earth.

Oops -- it appears I was wrong about using microwave heating to dry
coal.  It's been done.  And it's touted as efficient.

http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=7004080

And some companies even see distilling as a win (water is actually
fairly precious in some Australian mining operations):

http://www.angloamerican.co.uk/static/reports/2006/rts/mc-research-de...
http://www.solve.csiro.au/1105/article13.htm

It appears that the issue of undesired combustion can be managed by
using low frequency microwaves.  (Not really an issue for getting
water from chondrites.)

Water content of coal varies, but overlaps the range for water-rich
chondrites.  If there's a big difference, it's probably that coal is
more permeable to water vapor.  There may be no alternative to finely
powdering chondritic regolith to get most of the water out.
(On the assumption that much of the water in regolith that's already a
fine powder has sublimated away.)

&gt; The transit time isn't a big deal, especially since it's not

&gt; The difficult question is whether Mars gravity is enough to keep

&gt; and artificial gravity isn't very practical on the surface.

&gt;&gt;All human technology can do NOW is to put around 500 Kg in Mars.

&gt; Uh, no.  You're confusing what can be done with off-the-shelf hardware
&gt; and what can be done with today's technology.  If you are willing to
&gt; use orbital assembly, there's no question that we've had the
&gt; technology for a manned Mars expedition for about 40 years now.

&gt;&gt;To sustain several people for 16 MONTHS we would need
&gt;&gt;TONS and TONS of supplies!!!

&gt; Circa half a ton per man-year, if you can recycle wash water
&gt; adequately and you don't need too many spare parts.  (The
&gt; dehumidification that you must do anyway can supply enough water for
&gt; drinking and food preparation, and you can electrolyze a bit of the
&gt; water for oxygen, but you *must* recycle the water used to wash
&gt; dishes, clothes, and people -- there's too much of it.)  This is
&gt; substantial, but not a huge barrier.

&gt; In fact, you can make a passably good argument that it's cheaper to
&gt; make the mission heavier, and accept the extra launch costs, than to
&gt; spend a lot of engineering man-years making it really light.  The one
&gt; &quot;lightening&quot; technology that probably *is* worth the trouble is
&gt; wash-water recycling.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And there is a strong possibility that they have significant water
&gt;&gt;&gt; content, in which case their resources might be quite important to
&gt;&gt;&gt; future transportation to and from Mars.  (And elsewhere -- in energy
&gt;&gt;&gt; terms, they are closer to Earth orbit than the surface of the Moon
&gt;&gt;&gt; is.)  Of course, that's not relevant to a flags-and-footprints Mars
&gt;&gt;&gt; mission... if that's all you care about.

&gt;&gt;This is a pipe dream. No humans will go to Mars within the next 30
&gt;&gt;years.

&gt; So?  The possible resources of Phobos and Deimos remain of interest no
&gt; matter what the detailed schedule is.

&gt;&gt;WE DO NOT NEED TO GO THERE. The mars rovers have demonstrated that
&gt;&gt;we can send virtual beings controlled by us safely here, that can do
&gt;&gt;the SAME exploration that a human would do but for much longer
&gt;&gt;periods.

&gt; No, they can do *some* of the same exploration that a human could, but
&gt; *stretched out* over much longer periods.  The total mileage on
&gt; Opportunity at the moment, after three Earth years, is roughly that of
&gt; the first day's rover activity on Apollo 15.  The people running the
&gt; rovers say it takes them a day to do what a human field geologist
&gt; could do in half a minute.  And that's for the things they can do at
&gt; all -- for example, no rover now *planned*, never mind launched, can
&gt; drill a core sample as deeply as the Apollo 15 astronauts did on their
&gt; second day. (Sure, you could build a rover which could -- although
&gt; it's not as easy as it looks -- but that's far from the only thing on
&gt; the list.)

We've had the technology, in theory, but as Elektron has shown us -
there's a huge gap between theoretically possible and practical
working hardware.

It's long been a concern of mine whether NASA can afford the Martian
equivalent of Apollo's 8 and 11, fiscally or politically.

I'd like to emphasize the importance of Mars' moons. They are easier
to get to than Earth's Moon, have plentiful resources and commanding
presence above Mars. They are our bridge into the future. Luna is like
Iceland, Mars and it's moons are like New York.

Well, if water is 10-20%, the "fraction of other compounds subject to
heating" would be 80-90%.  You, and Meek, were perhaps imagining there
was such a thing as a compound *not* subject to heating?

That's a fairly common misconception based on some common but completely
wrong descriptions of how microwave ovens work.  The reality is, there's
no Magic Microwave Resonance that selectively heats one compound instead
of another, and if there were, the heat would just be conducted instantly
between the two anyway.  *Everything* gets heated, to roughly the same
temperature, and you have to pay for all that heat even if you're only
interested in one part of the product.
