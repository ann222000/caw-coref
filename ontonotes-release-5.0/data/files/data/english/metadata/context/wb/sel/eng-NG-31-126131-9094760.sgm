Plenty.  Start with the Juilliard Quartet on Testament performing Op.

Yes to the Smetana, 132 at any rate the only one I know. Of course the
benchmark 1930's Busch. And the 1927 Capet Quartet if you can track
down their 131 and 132. The Hollywood Quartet of the 50's on
Testament. And the Vegh of the 70's.

Ditto for the Busch (but avoid the reverb-laden Pearl CD set), Capet
(Biddulph) and Hollywood (Testament) items.

I like the Yale Quartet on Vanguard. And it appears to have been
reissued very inexpensively now. These are very sharp, edgy and in-

If you're looking for sets of the Late Quartets only I'll second the
recommendations for the Yale and the Smetana. If you're ready to
splurge on a complete set get the 1960's Juilliard on French Sony or
the Prazak Quartet on Praga.

Only if you enjoy hearing Beethoven the way it is *not* supposed to be
played.

It's possible that someone has mentioned this in an article that I haven't
read yet, but for me, second place after the Guarneri has to be the
Budapest quartet.

Very funny.  I had the same reaction to both the Furt PIT 6 and the
Yale Quartet's late LvB!  And, for that matter, I just picked up a
cheap copy of the Levine Prokofiev 5th that was lauded by several in a
recent thread and found it a big, fat, beautiful bore.  Hey, ya buys
yer ticket and takes yer chances.

So for my worthless 2 cents, among recent releases of late Beethoven
Quartets, I'd recommend the Petersens on Capriccio...and the Hagens on
DG.

The Petersens and Hagens rate very highly among individual
recordings of the Late Quartets that have not yet been collected as a
set.  But it's not so easy to track them all down. However, now that
they have received three recommendations it can be assumed according
to Schultz that they are no good.  So presumably the Vermeer
recordings are the ones to get.

The Vermeer Op. 132 is a powerful mood-builder for me. Takes me awhile to
return to my livingroom after hearing it. They're somewhat over-the-top in
the slow movement though, so exposure must be carefully rationed.

There was a time in my purist youth when I swore by the Yale set.
Even now I love their performance of the slow movement of Op. 127 and
wouldn't dream of parting with it.  Nevertheless -- despite their
supreme technical security, their absolute command of Beethoven's
rhythms, their capacity for the tightest ensemble imaginable, and even
a certain kind of rich lean tonal beauty -- I find that their approach
isn't remotely distinctive enough, and their Grosse Fuge in particular
strikes me as insufficiently savage and too pretty by half.  To some
extent, I think the supremely gifted members of the Yale in its
different formations were all victims of the self-effacing non-
interventionist attitude before the score rife among some of the very
most musical American performers of their generation.  I'm thinking
particularly of certain folks who recorded a lot of contemporary music
for, say, Nonesuch during the same period.  If you compare the
slightly earlier Columbia recording of Carter's Double Concerto with
Rosen, Jacobs, Prausnitz, and the English Chamber Orchestra to the
straight-laced and straight-faced all-American Nonesuch recording with
Kalish, Jacobs, Weisberg, and the Contemporary Chamber Ensemble you'll
see exactly what I mean.

Speaking of recordings of the Grosse Fuge, one of the denizens of this
forum sent me a transfer from LP of an absolutely sensational
recording of Op. 130 with the Grosse Fuge and no replacement finale by
the Smetana Quartet, a 1965 recording different from the one released
on CD.  I can only say that it's fantastically savage.  Probably my
favorite recording of the piece.

I felt (in opposition to the opinion of many here, I think) that the
Yale recordings were surprisingly emotionally uninvolved.  I prefer the
more emotional performance of the Guarneri (the late-60's incarnation).

I like them, too. Also, no one has mentioned the Melos Quartet. They are
very driven at times, yet also have plenty of poetry. I marginally prefer
their Grosse Fugue--the Takacs' is a bit too fast and almost flippant for
my taste. The Melos also has great sound. Alas, it's out of print, but used
copies should be available.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So for my worthless 2 cents, among recent releases of late Beethoven
&gt;&gt;&gt; Quartets, I'd recommend the Petersens on Capriccio...and the Hagens on
&gt;&gt;&gt; DG.

&gt;&gt; Which prompts me to ask: Has anyone heard the Petersen Qrt. play badly?
&gt;&gt; They must be in the top 2 or 3 of every string quartet work I own that
&gt;&gt; includes their recording.
&gt;&gt; bl

&gt;I agree, and wonder when the Petersens are going to get around to the
&gt;Middle Quartets.
">

Two of them appear on a Berlin Classics CD which, I think, was recorded before
their Capriccio series.  Probably out of print, unfortunately.

I'm not sure how accurate it is, but here's a discography:

Agree, on both counts; plus Takacs and, in op. 131, the Orford Qt (for some
reason they sound much more involved there than elsewhere).  Oh, and if the
Hagen Qt ever show up nearby to perform Op. 130, don't miss it (unless they've
changed their conception of it); their account of the slow movement in the
performance I attended was breathtaking (and quite different from - including
much slower than - the performance on the CD).

I listened to their Op 131 this morning during my daily walk
in the (rainy) park. It is simply too refined, with too beautiful
a string tone (&quot;rich lean tonal beauty&quot;) and insufficient
anger. The individual short (2-3-4 note) motives are in some
places insufficiently well distinguished from one another;
how this is done is essential to interpretation of the late
Beethoven quartets (not to mention the next item my iPod in
its serene shuffleness decided to play: the Ives 2nd Piano Sonata,
where that is almost everything.)

It was obvious long before &quot;Hatto.&quot;  And the situation you describe
applies not only to discriminating among performances of music but to
almost everything in the universe of any interest.  It seems to the
scientist that the world works in a certain way:  he seeks the facts
to bolster that perception.

Subjectivity is now a debased and much misunderstood concept.  In
common parlance it's used to refer to something utterly arbitrary:  in
common parlance something is &quot;merely&quot; subjective.  But subjectivity
originally referred to a state, to the state characteristic of the
perceiving subject: there is no perception of reality apart from the
perception of perceiving subjects.

Subjectivity is not arbitrary:  it is a vantage, a point of view, a
particular angle.  The question is what is true from this or that
vantage.  The more that you can discover about the vantage, the more
facts that can be adduced to justify the view from a particular
vantage, the more we understand about the world.  (Nor, for the
record, do I believe in one currently fashionable viewpoint, that
everything is an arbitrary &quot;merely&quot; &quot;subjective&quot; construction.  I
don't believe that:  I only believe that our only evidence comes from
what human subjects discover and perceive.)

Bob, this is only a philosopher of science's gloss on what actually
happens, &quot;falsifiablity&quot; and all that. Scientists don't really set out
to disprove their own theses, although that happens often enough.
They set out to support and elaborate them.

The idea that there is a different stereo, analog SQ recording of Op 133
-- different from the one in the set Bob cites -- has been tossed around
here before, I believe. I think Tooter originated it. I'm not sure it's
correct. But I will check the recording cited by Bob against the
Crossroads LP. The latter quotes a timing of 15:40 vs. the former's
15:46 -- which could well make them the same.

Bob, the current Japanese issue COCO-70434, Op 130 and 133, includes the
same Op 133 you're talking about. I believe there is also a current
Supraphon issue, obviously out of Prague, of the late quartets -- and I
expect the Op 133 there is also the same.

A good suggestion, although I'd be equally likely to say the Vlach's 131
on Supraphon, available from Japan. And the Janacek Quartet's Op 135,
not available anywhere. And the Tatrai Quartet's Op 127, ditto....

If the original poster wants the 5 quartets in a box, the Smetana
Quartet's analog set would probably be my suggestion, although I'm not
in love with the Op 131. Yale would be an interesting alternative to the
two he has already. But then, so would the Juilliard complete set (the
analog one, from France).

All of the above, in fact, will supply very different takes from those
offered by the ABQ and the (later, I think this is) Guarneri.
