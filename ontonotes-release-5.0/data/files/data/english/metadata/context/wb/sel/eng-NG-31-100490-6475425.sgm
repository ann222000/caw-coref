Has anybody ever had a new pilot bearing that was too tight on the tranny
input shaft?  Or can it be too tight if it is installed?  It's in a '69 350.
Thanks for any help.

The most common cause of "too tight" is a burr on the input shaft or the
bushing.  Check to see if it is burred or if the shaft has a mushroomed end
front hitting something while out.  It is also easy to mushroom in the
bushing when installing if you don't use an installation tool (used input
shaft).

The second is alignment problems.  Since you probably have no choice, pull
the bellhousing, clutch, and pressure plate back off. See if the
transmission will fit in the hole this way. DO NOT let the transmission hang
from the input or bushing.  If it does, then you may have the bellhousing
out of whack.

If it won't, see if you can borrow another input shaft or transmission to
see if it fits.  In not, then the bushing is probably the wrong size and
needs to come back out.  I've known people to ream them, but they are
supposed to fit when you get them.
