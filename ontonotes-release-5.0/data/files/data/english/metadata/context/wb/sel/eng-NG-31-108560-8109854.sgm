How to clean up mains power?

We're having to reset our office network at least once a day. it locks up and
only a power cycle will get things going again.

We've replaced the router and the DSL modem. No joy. Firmware is up-to-date.
The neighboring office manager says that they are experiencing similar
issues. The building is old and will be bulldozed within a year (60's/70's
vintage wiring).

How can we confirm or eliminate the power as the culprit? Would like to take
steps to filter the mains power rather than measure it (ie, strip chart
recorder) because I'm certain that it's the culprit, and spending a few $$ on
cleaning up the power is $$ well spent, IMHO.

The current power strip powering the network devices -- DSL modem, Ethernet
network router/switch (no wireless) -- has integral surge protection but
nothing more.

All suggestions are welcome.

Since it's unclear what exactly the problem is, an uninterruptable power supply
(UPS) would be your best choice.
A *filter* won't stop problems due to mini-brownouts you see.

IMO, If you think you have power problems, you need to spend a few
bucks on professional advice before you spend bucks on hardware. Call
an electrician.

That being said, if all the core equipment, (DSL router, broadband
modem, WiFi access point, etc), is on a small UPS, you've eliminated
lots of possible power problems.  If you do this and you still have
problems, you have big problems or they are unrelated to power.

Have you tried cycling power one box at a time (usually
working from dowstream to upstream) to see if there's
one sensitive box and the network comes back up?

Otherwise, as others have said, UPS.  It is far better
than any filter and usually less expensive.

I can't imagine not having a UPS for such important equipment.  While
you are at it I'd get a high quality model like a Tripplite SU750XL.
This is a pure sine wave double conversion unit.  Maintains voltage
+/-2%, zero switchover time.  Probably can't get better isolation from
the power line, which sounds like what you need.  The downside it that
it has a loud fan.

Don't waste your time.  Call your electric company and ask them to
loan you a test set to monitor and log your power line.

The last place I worked was having excessive failures on the
production floor, and erratic computer problems all over the building. I
looked into one of the breaker boxes and told them what was wrong.  They
told me I didn't know what I was talking about, that the wiring was done
to code. So, they called in the industrial electricians who wired the
building. They walked around removing breaker box covers, scratching
their asses, then sticking the covers back on.

Their final report was, 'We don't see nothing wrong.'  Our problem
was found by the utility company, and proven by using the monitor. The
building was 25 years old, and used the then allowed two gauges smaller
neutral three phase system.  The harmonics caused by lots of switching
power supplies cause high currents in the neutral, which causes heating
and erratic equipment shutdowns.  The neutrals were supplemented with
larger neutrals, to make it equivalent to two gauges larger.  99 % of
our problems went away.

If you are using the system in an office and the network is critical it
would be advisable to use a U.P.S. to make sure everything is ok, even in
case of a blackout U could lose any unsaved data. The U.P.S's I have seen
here in aus come with an adaptor cable to automate a shutdown and save data
in the case of a power failure. There is also a feature in the software
supplied (or downloadable) to monitor the power supplied, I have heard of a
friend that did this out in the country to prove that his power was dropping
well below allowable limits and forced the company to install another
substation to keep him going.
Good luck with it.

As others have suggested, invest in a UPS.  Here is a web site that may
help:

Total up the power requirements for your core devices and you can estimate
the reserve power time based on the UPS size in VA.

There seems to be 2 kinds of UPSs: those that switches to battery backup if
power drops below a minimum voltage; and those that separate the load from
the supply (&quot;double conversion&quot; type). This latter type is, basically, a
battery charger running an inverter it's *always&quot; in baclup mode (c: .

It seems that the double-conversion type is truly the only kind that can
isolate equipment from &quot;bad&quot; power. All else relies on filtering and fast
switching from grid-supplied power to inverter power. (We pray in fast

Am I right in thinking that a double-conversion model is the best for our
needs (our problem being dirty power, not power-fail)?

There is a company called Best Power Technology that sells what they call
FERUPS which uses a Ferroresonant transformer to regulate the output
voltage and remove anything that is not 60HZ from the power.  It will
still switch to battery when the power fails completely and produces
a sine-wave output.

Somewhere close to your facility is using a lot of power
intermittently. Whenever they turn on or off a big piece of equipment,
they send the surge to every other users nearby. Since your building
will be torn down soon, a good UPS may be the best bet.

Mine does that now and then but it's caused by a connected computer that
went off line in the middle of doing some networking that didn't
complete. the Router never times out on it and hogs the BW to a point
where the router may just stop.
First indication is, things starting to move slowly through the
router with out any apparent activity giving reason for slow up to the
point where things may start timing out on you.

So many who recommend a UPS niether know how electricity works nor
realize that most all UPSes connect directly to AC mains via a relay.
These UPSes maintain  'dirty' electricity during extreme brownouts and
blackouts, do not clean electricity despite so many rumors otherwise,
and create power so dirty in battery backup mode as to even harm some
small electric motors.   Many only assume a $100 UPS contain double
conversion.  Then convert that speculation into fact.  You are
correct.  The only UPS that would 'clean' electricity is the $500+
version.

That $500 UPS may or may not solve the problem.  Far easier is to
first identify the problem.  Simplest, easiest, and a most informative
first step involves measuring voltages on AC receptacles with a
digital meter.  Measure each receptacle for router and for other
networked equipment.    Three voltages between each of three plug
holes should be measured while all items are powered.  Yes, there must
be an AC voltage even between neutral (largest) hole and safety ground
(round) hole contacts.   What are those numbers?

You don't define what is connected where.  Apparently router and DSL
modem share same power.  What else is on that power strip AND also on
other receptacles of same circuit?   If other network equipment is
powered from separate circuits, then voltage measurements between
those receptacle ground pins and receptacle neutrals should be
collected.  Easier by using a three wire extension cord.  Those
numbers will also provide significantly useful information.  For
example, numbers may expose a voltage problem that even the $500 UPS
will not solve.  Or it may expose a problem that will only create
other problems later.

One of few who offered useful suggests is Michael Terrel.  His
building was wired with what is called a shared neutral. Shared
neutrals are code legal but will create problems if neutral wire only
meets code when powering large or many reactive loads (fluorescents,
computers, etc)   'Shared neutral' wiring would be obvious by
inspecting how those feed wires enter the breaker box and from voltage
numbers.  Most circuits are not wired 'shared neutral'.  But then most
circuits don't create your problem.

Nothing is wrong with properly installed 1960/1970 wiring.  As long
as the circuits are three wire and not compromised by an ignorant
human, then that wiring is just as good as 2000 wiring.

However some have wired circuits using push-in or stab lock
connections.  That is sufficient for electric light circuits and very
bad for electronics.  By removing each cover plate, all wires should
be fully connected to screws on receptacle side.  If not, wires would
be connected in the back - that is bad.  Every wall receptacle from
router receptacle daisy chained to breaker box must have wires firmly
attached to those side screws.  Anyone connecting to or disconnecting
from a receptacle not using screws may cause electronics power
problems.

Not defined is even the router.  Some router power supply 'bricks'
have poor line filters.   To eliminate what a $500 UPS might also
accomplish, we put this line filter into a receptacle electric box
with a duplex receptacle, flexible power cord and plug:
http://www.schurterinc.com/products/usa/pemfilter.asp
http://www.schurterinc.com/products/usa/blockfilters1.asp
http://www.cor.com/PDF/Q.pdf
http://www.interpower.com/ic/p30-35list.asp
http://www.interpower.com/scripts/wsisa.dll/WService=ic/p35list2.p?on...
If the $500 UPS is going to accomplish anything, then these filters
will also create a noticeable reliability improvement.

Another useful test is temporarily install a 50 foot three wire
extension cord so that router and DSL modem get powered from same
receptacle as other computers or from a receptacle mounted on breaker
box..

Reasons for power problems or symptoms associated are easily to
located.   Long before spending big bucks on a UPS, far more sense to
first identify the problem.  If building wire is creating the problem,
well, it may also be the 'canary in a coal mine'.  Curing simple
symptoms with a $500 UPS may result in more serious problems later as
well as be uselessly expensive.  No, neither router nor DSL modem need
be on a UPS for reasons also electrically simple.

Power strip protector does zero to solve your problem as made
obvious by its numeric specs.  Even numbers on its packaging
demonstrated that it ignores any voltage below 330 volts.  Votlages
that would create your lockup would be far lower.  The protector acts
like it does not exist except when the rare much greater than 330 volt
transient happens maybe once every seven years.  But then your failing
router powered from that protector strip also demonstrates same.

Unless the OP owns the copmany he is working for or it's a home

too much.  As a technician, his job is to work with management people

A lifetime ago, I was hired to run a shiny new datacenter with the
biggest new computer made by Digital Equipment Corp (R.I.P.). That was
in the winter and it was in a first-class large building in Manhattan.
We didn't have a UPS and we knew there were other large computers in
the building in the same state. (I wasn't part of teh planning
process).

Everything was fine until May 1st. At about 7:15 the system crashed
and rebooted with a &quot;power fail&quot; message.  OK. Sh*t happens but it
proceeded to happen every day at about the same time.

We escalated the problem, step by step until I finally had a meeting
with the &quot;account rep&quot; for Con Edison, (the utility company for
non-New Yorkers.) Who knew that the power company had sales engineers?

He checked a few things and then declared that we were getting normal
commercial-grade power.  The deal was that in the summer they switched
in capacitors to compensate for the power factor for the air
conditioners that people would begin to use. This had been standard
practive for decades and the solution was our problem.

We wound up getting a ferroresonant constant voltage transformer so
large it had to be moved in with a forklift.

Why did the &quot;other mainframes&quot; not have problems?

Becuase they were IBM systems and all of them had motor-generator
units included in the price. they were even better than CVTs and not a
customer third-party option like all the other computer vedors.

&gt;&gt; ...
&gt;&gt;Am I right in thinking that a double-conversion model is the best for our
&gt;&gt;needs (our problem being dirty power, not power-fail)?
&gt;&gt;...
&gt;&gt;(Double-conversion models start near $500. Ouch!)

&gt;   So many who recommend a UPS niether know how electricity works nor
&gt; realize that most all UPSes connect directly to AC mains via a relay.
&gt; These UPSes maintain  'dirty' electricity during extreme brownouts and
&gt; blackouts, do not clean electricity despite so many rumors otherwise,
&gt; and create power so dirty in battery backup mode as to even harm some
&gt; small electric motors.   Many only assume a $100 UPS contain double
&gt; conversion.  Then convert that speculation into fact.  You are
&gt; correct.  The only UPS that would 'clean' electricity is the $500+
&gt; version.

&gt;   That $500 UPS may or may not solve the problem.  Far easier is to
&gt; first identify the problem.  Simplest, easiest, and a most informative
&gt; first step involves measuring voltages on AC receptacles with a
&gt; digital meter.  Measure each receptacle for router and for other
&gt; networked equipment.    Three voltages between each of three plug
&gt; holes should be measured while all items are powered.  Yes, there must
&gt; be an AC voltage even between neutral (largest) hole and safety ground
&gt; (round) hole contacts.   What are those numbers?

&gt;   You don't define what is connected where.  Apparently router and DSL
&gt; modem share same power.  What else is on that power strip AND also on
&gt; other receptacles of same circuit?   If other network equipment is
&gt; powered from separate circuits, then voltage measurements between
&gt; those receptacle ground pins and receptacle neutrals should be
&gt; collected.  Easier by using a three wire extension cord.  Those
&gt; numbers will also provide significantly useful information.  For
&gt; example, numbers may expose a voltage problem that even the $500 UPS
&gt; will not solve.  Or it may expose a problem that will only create
&gt; other problems later.

&gt;   One of few who offered useful suggests is Michael Terrel.  His
&gt; building was wired with what is called a shared neutral. Shared
&gt; neutrals are code legal but will create problems if neutral wire only
&gt; meets code when powering large or many reactive loads (fluorescents,
&gt; computers, etc)   'Shared neutral' wiring would be obvious by
&gt; inspecting how those feed wires enter the breaker box and from voltage
&gt; numbers.  Most circuits are not wired 'shared neutral'.  But then most
&gt; circuits don't create your problem.

&gt;   Nothing is wrong with properly installed 1960/1970 wiring.  As long
&gt; as the circuits are three wire and not compromised by an ignorant
&gt; human, then that wiring is just as good as 2000 wiring.

&gt;   However some have wired circuits using push-in or stab lock
&gt; connections.  That is sufficient for electric light circuits and very
&gt; bad for electronics.  By removing each cover plate, all wires should
&gt; be fully connected to screws on receptacle side.  If not, wires would
&gt; be connected in the back - that is bad.  Every wall receptacle from
&gt; router receptacle daisy chained to breaker box must have wires firmly
&gt; attached to those side screws.  Anyone connecting to or disconnecting
&gt; from a receptacle not using screws may cause electronics power
&gt; problems.

&gt;   Not defined is even the router.  Some router power supply 'bricks'
&gt; have poor line filters.   To eliminate what a $500 UPS might also
&gt; accomplish, we put this line filter into a receptacle electric box
&gt; with a duplex receptacle, flexible power cord and plug:
&gt; http://www.schurterinc.com/products/usa/pemfilter.asp
&gt; http://www.schurterinc.com/products/usa/blockfilters1.asp
&gt; http://www.cor.com/PDF/Q.pdf
&gt; http://www.interpower.com/ic/p30-35list.asp
&gt; http://www.interpower.com/scripts/wsisa.dll/WService=ic/p35list2.p?on...
&gt; If the $500 UPS is going to accomplish anything, then these filters
&gt; will also create a noticeable reliability improvement.

&gt;   Another useful test is temporarily install a 50 foot three wire
&gt; extension cord so that router and DSL modem get powered from same
&gt; receptacle as other computers or from a receptacle mounted on breaker
&gt; box..

&gt;   Reasons for power problems or symptoms associated are easily to
&gt; located.   Long before spending big bucks on a UPS, far more sense to
&gt; first identify the problem.  If building wire is creating the problem,
&gt; well, it may also be the 'canary in a coal mine'.  Curing simple
&gt; symptoms with a $500 UPS may result in more serious problems later as
&gt; well as be uselessly expensive.  No, neither router nor DSL modem need
&gt; be on a UPS for reasons also electrically simple.

&gt;   Power strip protector does zero to solve your problem as made
&gt; obvious by its numeric specs.  Even numbers on its packaging
&gt; demonstrated that it ignores any voltage below 330 volts.  Votlages
&gt; that would create your lockup would be far lower.  The protector acts
&gt; like it does not exist except when the rare much greater than 330 volt
&gt; transient happens maybe once every seven years.  But then your failing
&gt; router powered from that protector strip also demonstrates same.
">

strange, we just replaced a battery in a UPS used to power the PLC so to
prevent unstable voltage. It has a 120 watt inverter that runs all the
time and the 120 volts does nothing but keep the battery charged. It's
programmed to drop out if power does not recover with in 10 mins and
makes sure power remains on for at least 2 mins before it turns on
output to PLC.
It has corrected many problems since we experience service problems
in our location of operation commonly, more so lately than ever.

The last time we bought one of these it was only around  $85 and it's
a din rail mount with a side din rail battery mounted connected via a
module cable. The battery isn't inside the unit. If the battery goes
bad, it will shut down. the inverter does not use source supply to power
its output.

Because some problems (ie low voltage from defective wiring) were
solved, that means a UPS solves all problems?  I don't see where the
problem was first identified.  If that particular problem does not
reoccur, then that UPS solves all problems?

Meanwhile, did you look at the output of the $85 UPS?    Remember,
the OP is asking about cleaner power.  This 120 VAC UPS in battery
backup mode outputs two 200 volt square waves with a spike of up to
270 volts between those square waves.  Since the manufacturer is
promoting on spin, then this 'square wave' output is called a modified
sine wave.  Hardly clean power.  In fact, that modified sine wave
would be some of the dirtiest power seen by most appliances.   However
it is a modified sine wave.  Therefore many assume that UPS has
'cleaned' electricity.

So you know all UPSes output cleaner electricity?  Did you first get
numbers as I do?

But again, long before applying 'magic box' solutions, a smarter
solution starts by first identifying the failure.  In one case, had
they traced and solved reasons for strange electronics behavior, then
they would have found reasons for the resulting house explosion before
that explosion occurred.

Just because you 'feel' that UPS cleaned power does not mean it did
AND does not mean it solves all problems as implied by that
conclusion.  No residential power should be anywhere near so 'dirty'
as to cause electronics failure.

Provided is how the OP can identify problems before fixing them
(what responsible repairmen do), get numbers so that the better
informed can help,  AND maybe eliminate other future failures.  If a
$500 UPS is needed for robust electronics, then how many other
electronics also need $500 UPSes?  Furnace controls?  Smoke
detectors?  Less robust devices such as dimmer switches?   It makes
zero sense to cure symptoms with a $500 UPS only on speculation.
Makes far more sense to eliminate the problem with far less expensive
solutions.    That means identifying problems before fixing them.
Simple procedures provided without spending $500.

But again, that $85 retail UPS does not 'clean' electricity.  It
connects appliance directly to AC mains when not in battery backup
mode.  Its output may be so 'dirty' as to even harm some small
electric motors.

Why would AC power cause that failure?  One - those routers are
defective as designed.  Two - building AC electric has major problems
that require immediate attention.  The design of routers, computers,
etc should be so robust that building power should never cause such
failures.

For example, Michael Terrell's post demonstrates why electronics
were failing.  Neutral wires were undersized.  Fixing the reason for
electronics problem rather than curing symptoms with a $500 UPS also
eliminated what was potentially a building fire. Electronics design
should be so robust that no building AC power should cause problems.

A story from Datamation magazine.  One computer would crash
constantly.  The tech would run diagnostics all night - no failure.
But when the tech went for coffee, then diagnostics would crash every
time.  Got so bad that the tech would loudly announce he was going for
coffee, stomp out of the room, then sneak back to peek around a door
and watch the machine.  No failures.

Problem was traced to how the computer was grounded.  It was
grounded to the elevator because a human did not learn his job.
Everytime the tech took an elevator down for coffee, that elevator
would crash the computer.

There are no ghosts.  But there are many humans who cannot bother to
first learn even basic grounding; then want to cure problems with
magic boxes because they never learned even simple concepts of
grounding.

Con Ed capacitors should never cause problems for computers.  But
some early computers had marginal designs.  For example, specs for PCs
are quite blunt.  Power must be completely lost for 17 milliseconds
and computer must maintain output voltages.  Computers that put fewer
loads on their power supply can operate even longer without power.
UPSes that switch over to battery backup may interrupt power for up to
10 milliseconds.  If computer was upset by switching in reactive
loading, then computer would also crash when a UPS switched to battery
backup.

Described were some simple procedures to even identify bad
grounding.  Of course, if the only failing device is the router, well,
is that router design too marginal?  So we buy a $500 UPS to fix a $50
defective router?

We were in a huge industrial park, with a lot of heavy industrial
work going on. Even when almost nothing was on in the offices or on the
factory floor, the power was dirty.  It was cheaper, and better to
upgrade the 15 year old neutrals than add a couple thousand UPS to the
complex.  Also, prior the the upgrade, several critical systems had 25 A
240 VAC Variacs on the inputs to raise the line voltage.  We were able
to bypass them all, after the upgrade was complete.

The sad thing was that the newer method was already in use when the
complex was built, but the aged EE who designed the system thought
harmonics on neutrals were pure BS.

Could be voltage fluctuations either high or low, possibly there may be
spikes.
Try using a battery backup system like a UPS. Most of those will clean up
your power, and if there are mini outages, the UPS if sized correctly will
keep power to your equipment.

&gt; There seems to be 2 kinds of UPSs: those that switches to battery backup
&gt; if
&gt; power drops below a minimum voltage; and those that separate the load from
&gt; the supply (&quot;double conversion&quot; type). This latter type is, basically, a
&gt; battery charger running an inverter it's *always&quot; in baclup mode (c: .

&gt; It seems that the double-conversion type is truly the only kind that can
&gt; isolate equipment from &quot;bad&quot; power. All else relies on filtering and fast
&gt; switching from grid-supplied power to inverter power. (We pray in fast
&gt; relays!)

&gt; Am I right in thinking that a double-conversion model is the best for our
&gt; needs (our problem being dirty power, not power-fail)?

&gt; Sparky

&gt; (Double-conversion models start near $500. Ouch!)

Yes.
As for the 500, would it be cheaper than losing all your data.

In this particular situation, the building will be bulldozed in less than a
year. Building management is not about to have a major repair done on the
electric supply for the building in this time period.

So if, upon closer examination, it is determined that the problem is caused
by loads elsewhere in the building generating spikes, confounded by
inadequate wiring and/or imbalanced phases and overloaded neutrals, a $500
fix may indeed be our only choice.

Agree with the poster that pointed out that components such as routers should
be able to withstand larger power quality issues than they are currently
designed to withstand, if profit weren't the primary goal of the
manufacturer.

&gt; If I were you, I would first diagnose in  more detail what &quot;locks up&quot; means.

&gt; It could mean ethernet packets are not getting from one computer to another
&gt; (pinging each others IP no response).
&gt; It may mean DNS stopped working.
&gt; It may mean your DSL modem is not working, but otherwise the LAN is working.

&gt; This is easy to do and would narrow down the device that is causing problem.

So far I know (SFIK -- hey! A new acronym!) this:
The computers in this office utilize a medical records system whereby one of
the computers hosts a server application (which contains the data base), and
3 other computers run client applications which log into the server app and
access the patient data base.

Several times a day the client computers suddenly can no longer log into the
data base (their first indication that something is wrong) and also cannot
access any web sites.

As yet I have not been there when this happens, so cannot confirm ping
success or failure. They've learned to turn off the switch to the power strip
that supplies the routers and modem, and after a few seconds, all is well
with the world again. It's a bit much to ask them to unplug a particular
router's &quot;brick&quot; from the power strip, plug in again, and troubleshoot from
there. I'll have to spend a day there, sometime soon, to experience it
myself.

The next step, I think, is to ask the power utility (PG&amp;E) if they will lend
a power quality recorder.

&gt;&gt;Back in the 80s with low end mini-computers we saw these issues a lot. Many times we'd find things like coffee makers on timers on the same circuit breaker. Or a welder next door but sharing the same transformer. Other times if we could establish the WHEN we'd have the folks spread out for a few days to see what might be going on. The most interesting one was a trash compactor across the street that was run at about 3:45 PM each day which is when the systems would act up. Turned out they were pulling down too much power and affecting the entire block.

&gt;&gt;David

&gt; A lifetime ago, I was hired to run a shiny new datacenter with the
&gt; biggest new computer made by Digital Equipment Corp (R.I.P.). That was
&gt; in the winter and it was in a first-class large building in Manhattan.
&gt; We didn't have a UPS and we knew there were other large computers in
&gt; the building in the same state. (I wasn't part of teh planning
&gt; process).

&gt; Everything was fine until May 1st. At about 7:15 the system crashed
&gt; and rebooted with a &quot;power fail&quot; message.  OK. Sh*t happens but it
&gt; proceeded to happen every day at about the same time.

&gt; We escalated the problem, step by step until I finally had a meeting
&gt; with the &quot;account rep&quot; for Con Edison, (the utility company for
&gt; non-New Yorkers.) Who knew that the power company had sales engineers?

&gt; He checked a few things and then declared that we were getting normal
&gt; commercial-grade power.  The deal was that in the summer they switched
&gt; in capacitors to compensate for the power factor for the air
&gt; conditioners that people would begin to use. This had been standard
&gt; practive for decades and the solution was our problem.

&gt; We wound up getting a ferroresonant constant voltage transformer so
&gt; large it had to be moved in with a forklift.

&gt; Why did the &quot;other mainframes&quot; not have problems?

&gt; Becuase they were IBM systems and all of them had motor-generator
&gt; units included in the price. they were even better than CVTs and not a
&gt; customer third-party option like all the other computer vedors.
">

Actually they were optional if the customer had a 400Hz source.
I worked for a company where the entire datacenter was on a _large_
UPS that provided 400Hz power; none of our IBM mainframes ever had a
MG set.

Write a simple script that is also an icon on the desktop.  When
router locks, then each user clicks on that icon to collect and store
relevant information in a temporary file.

Some of the tasks that script must perform include
ping  192.168.1.1 &gt;&gt;tmpfile
ping 192.168.1.100 &gt;&gt;tmpfile
ipconfig /all &gt;&gt;tmpfile

When you arrive, view what computers talk to router, what computers
talk to each other, and even what computers still have IP leases.
There is still no reason to believe power created this problem.  If
so, then why is the router's power supply so deficient as to not
eliminate things that other power supplies (ie computers, modem, etc)
easily make irrelevant?

Like the temporary 50 foot power cord, meter measurement (numbers
then posted here so that other information you did not see in those
numbers can be identified), $10 line filter, etc.  So many simple
things to first learn where a problem is rather than just
automatically assume (for no reason) that it must be 'dirty' power and
that a $500 UPS must cure it.

You don't even have to be there when router locks up.  Voltages from
the meter could report defects even when router is working OK.  Again,
we first collect data before automatically speculating blame.  If
power is the problem, then why is only one appliance failing?  A
question that PG&amp;E will ask, be discouraged by an answer based only in
speculation, and then tend to be less cooperative.   To get useful
assistance from PG&amp;E, wild speculation (it must be a power problem)
with is not sufficient.  Why do you suspect power?  No post here
suggests that power is reason for the failure.

How do you know the problem is not expired IP leases?  Again, not
posted to be a solution.  Posted as but another example of the so many
existing reasons ignored because speculation blames AC electricity.

However, for someone less experienced, part swapping (or sequential

Entire protection circuit in a plug-in UPS is the same circuit inside
power strip protectors.  But again, where do they list each type of

why you do not cite spec numbers.

More embarrassing, a UPS protector circuit is often grossly
undersized even compared to power strips.  That too will be obvious
once those manufacturer spec numbers are provided.  So where is this
superior protection?

Meanwhile, any problem that might be causing the OPs router lock up
would also be completely ignored by MOVs.  Review numbers that are

that even manufacturer numbers do not say.  Why make claims without
first learning the technology?

UPS is to protect data from blackouts and brownouts.  Once saved to
disk, then data needs no such protection.  How robust is protection
inside computers?  So robust that some of the dirtiest electricity -
from a UPS in battery backup mode - still does not harm a computer.
What is a source of some 'dirtiest' electricity? Many who did not
first learn the numbers will automatically *assume* a UPS means
'cleaner' electricity.  What is a source of dirtiest electricity?  Did
you read those specs?   That is what a good business manager does -
learn the facts before making a recommendation.

Meanwhile, MOVs (the protection circuit inside a plug-in UPS) will
do nothing for the OP's router problem.

The $10 line filter.  But a $500 UPS only to perform diagnostic
testing?  A $500 UPS does not eliminate all possible electrical
problems - as was assumed.  So if the problem still exists, does that
prove it is not from AC mains?  No.  Circuits still exist to carry AC
electric anomalies completely around that UPS.

A UPS that outputs a sine wave does not define a double conversion
UPS.  That model (if I have properly recognized it) is simply a
standby supply with a cleaner output.  It still connects router
directly to AC mains when not in battery backup mode; does no
electricity 'cleaning'.  That UPS also would not provide useful
information on the OP's router lockup.

A better test.  Buy a cheapest UPS. Run router from that UPS in
battery backup mode.  Does that 'dirty' electricity cause router
lockup?  If not, then is router lockup due to AC electricity?  Another
diagnostic that is so much less expensive.

A real surge protection circuit has iron and copper and multiple metal
oxide varistors (MOV).  Weight counts, and the parts cost money.

Here's an illustration of a &quot;better&quot; powerstrip with small inductors,
caps, and MOV chips.

http://www.answers.com/topic/surge-suppression?cat=technology

Here is a much better surge protector that weighs about 3 pounds. The
heavy part is iron-core inductors.

http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=PR11T3V2

There is also &quot;whole house&quot; protection that an electrician can install
in the main panel.
http://www.smarthome.com/4860.html

IMO, anyone that doesn't put the server and core comm gear on a good
UPS is an idiot.

What we do at the desktops depends.

In large buildings where all the utility wire is below-ground, it
might be nothing.  In surburbia with above-ground power, I'd put a
whole-house protector in the panel and a &quot;better&quot; powerstrip under
each PC.

A breaker box 'whole house' protector ( www.smarthome.com ) has an
earthing wire.  Therefore it has an earth ground to shunt (connect,
divert, clamp) surges.  Nobody says that protector stops, blocks, or
absorbs surges.  But your post implies that myth.  How does a one inch
part inside a protector stop surges that could not be stopped by three
miles of sky?   No protector stops or absorbs destructive surges.
Otherwise even galvanic isolation inside all appliances would make all
surges irrelevant.

A surge that overwhelms the many appliance protection circuits
(galvanic isolation is only one and is also installed for human
safety) cannot be stopped and cannot be absorbed.  Destructive surge
seeks earth ground.  Either it is earthed via a wire (cable TV,
satellite dish) or is earthed via a protector (AC electric,
telephone).  The smarthome.com protector with a dedicated earthing
connection does earthing.

What doe MOVs do?  Well since we cannot make a wire connection to
earth, then MOVs make that wire connection only during surges.  How
good is that connection?  Increased joules is same as increased wire
gauge.  Joules do not define protection.  Joules is the ballpark
number for potector life epectancy.

Why do some protectors fail during a surge - as the indicator light
reports?  Those protectors are grossly undersized.  Grossly
undersizing gets the naive to recommend more ineffective protectors.
The effective 'whole house' protector is sufficiently sized (has
enough joules) as to earth direct lightning strikes.  A human never
even knows a surge existed when using minimally sufficient
protectors.  Sufficiently sized does not promote protectors among the
naive.  But that is what the effective protector does - conduct to
earth and remain functional.

Makes no difference whether incoming wire is overhead or
underground.  Every wire in every cable that enters the building must
connect to same earthing electrode - either directly or via a
protector.  This figure from an industry professional demonstrates
same principles for two structures.  Each structure has its own single
point earth ground.  Underground wire to the building also carries
surges:

Another industry professional also demonstrates why underground
wires entering a building without earthing can cause damage:

&gt; Lightning strikes somewhere across the street close to the below

MOVs are simply one type of connecting device to earth ground.
Others include 3mill carbons, avalanche diodes, gas discharge tubes,
etc.  In each case, the protector is only a connecting device - shunts
(clamps, connects, diverts, conducts) a surge to what the surge wants
- earth ground.

Never assume a protector is protection.  That is science based in
word association.  A 'protector' is a connecting device to
protection.  'Protection' (via a protector or just using a wire) is
earth ground.

Meanwhile, plug-in protector does not even have an earthing
connection.  Therefore its manufacturer avoids discussing earthing.
Primary objective of plug-in protectors - profits.  No wonder Monster
Cable sells a $100+ protector that is same as the $10 protector in the
grocery store.

Keep on believing that crock. A UPS is way better than a power strip.

Again that is not even close to being true.

not what you are saying above

That can be one function, another more important function for other people
is to keep the equipment running during blackouts and brownouts.

Unless you have a very cheap UPS, most power from a UPS during battery
operation is quite clean.

If true, then Dana would cite manufacturer spec sheets.  He would
post numbers that show how a UPS is better than a power strip.  He
does not and he cannot.  So he attacks - 'kill the messenger'.
Meanwhile, smarter consumers can view those numbers.  Let's review an
APC Back-UPS 300 spec sheet:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Surge Protection and Filtering
&gt; Surge energy rating 300 Joules
">

That's it. Nothing more.  Where is all this protection?   It does
not even cite the various electrical anomolies and numbers for that
protection.  It does not even claim to protect - only lists 300 joules
of MOVs? The entire protection system is 300 joules of MOVs an no
claims that those MOVs do anything?   Even grocery store power strip
protectors have more joules.

Why did Dana somehow know a UPS provides better protection?  He
knows because he feels.  The color glossy promotion sheet made some
ambiguous claim about protection.  That is often the only proof of
surge protection - some ambiguous statement without numbers.

Numbers demonstrate grossly undersized protection inside an APC
UPS.  IOW only enough joules to claim some surge protection.   That is
sufficient for Dana to make emphatic claims - to know like an expert.

Numbers say that surge protection is near zero.  Did they lie?  Of
course not.  It was not zero protection.  It was near zero
(ineffective) protection.  But sufficient for Dana to claim protection
better than power strips.  He could not bother to first read the
numbers?

Meanwhile, a typical UPS connects an appliance directly to AC mains
when not in battery backup mode.   UPS battery backup output may be
extremely 'dirty'.  Does 'dirtiest' electricity from a cheap UPS cause
the router to lock up?  A diagnostic test.
