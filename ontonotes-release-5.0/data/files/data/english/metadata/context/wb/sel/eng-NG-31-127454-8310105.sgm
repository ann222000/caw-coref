Whatever happened to him?  I don't want to spend half an hour
rereading to track him down.

Was left at the Burrow where we assume he was collected by Hermione
after the battle.

Nothing much.  He's only mentioned a couple of times, when he's in the
bedroom with Hermione.

Later, Ron wishes that Crookshanks was with them, so he could help
them immobilize the whomping willow.  But the cat is last seen around
page 95.
