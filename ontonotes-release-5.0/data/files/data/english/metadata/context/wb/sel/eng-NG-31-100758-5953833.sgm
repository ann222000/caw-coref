What kind of fish is "pescado cazón" and how long should it be cooked,
considering that this is meant to be soup?

If dried chiles de arból are used without soaking and de-seeding,
won't a bowl of Caldo de Pescado be extremely spicy?

Cazon is shark and we would pinch the meat into strings and fry in olive oil
for an hour then serve as a taco filling. Add some olives toward the end and
some diced tomato. It's great!

Wayne is being PC here, It is a dogfish here, just call it a Rock Salmon and
no one will care.  Firm flesh, mild taste, which is why the chiles.  Try
using it in caveach.   Have your local Salmon fishermen keep one of two for
next time he goes out instead of killing and tossing em overboard.
Europeans eat em

Local salmon fishermen?

Nobody has fished for salmon here since WW2. This county got its name
because
of all the reeds surrounding a huge lake that attracted migratory birds
and herds of elk and the Native Americans that lived a sedentary
lifestyle there on the lake shore.

The lake was fed by snowmelt from a high mountain range and several
rivers still flow
downwards toward the lake but those rivers are dammed for flood control
during the rainy season and irrigation during the dry months.

A 400 square mile forest grew along the banks of the rivers, but 99% of
it was cleared away to make room for Spanish style cattle ranching, and
then farming and orange groves.

The great river that flowed to the sea and attracted salmon spawning
has gone dry.

The huge lake is dry, but the birds keep migrating to it. A few elk are
left in an elk sanctuary. The center of the valley is now technically a
desert.

And riparian famers have used the fertile bottom land to plant crops
like cotton, which devastate the land further...

However, the government is going to make the farmers surrender the land
and the river will be restored, and the salmon should hopefully return.

But probably not in my lifetime.

I did not "snatch" the recipe off the internet, but it is possible that
whoever contributed the recipe to the local Spanish language newspaper
found it somewhere on the web. The newspaper usually mentions the
contributor's name though, so it's likely that the editors of "Nuestro
Cocina" are the copyright infringers.

However, posting some copyrighted material for the purpose of
discussion in a limited newsgroup is far from unethical.

Similar recipes on www.terra.com showed that Caldo de Pescado was made
with mako shark in Costa Rica, and claimed that shark was an
"aphrodisiac" [as if hot-blooded Latinos *need* love potions ;-) ] but
the recipe on that webpage specified sole or red snapper.

And, as to whether I will actually try to cook ANY recipe depends upon
the convenient availability of the ingredients. If a recipe calls for
penguin meat, I'm not going to book passage to Antarctica to acquire it.

But as has been explained ad nauseum it is proper to credit the Newspaper or

This is in reference to what?  Caldo de Pescado is fish soup in your
vernacular  isn't it?  Fairly easy to
understand that you could use most any fish for a recipe named Fish Soup so
you
could use your goldfish if you wanted.  Kinda like  Beef Stew or Chicken
soup?

YOU however  listed "pescado cazón cortado en trozos"  and YOU wanted
to know what that was, like the yellow potato and Bell Pepper.  Wayne gave
you  the general interpretation of Cazon as shark.    I further defined the
specific fish YOU asked about as a DOGFISH and I have already told you can
get in your waters but you chose to play a silly little misspelling game and
give another boring dissertation  That I think plays to  your hidden agenda.
This continuing habit of throwing superficial and diversionary BS fact into
your statements,  continuously injecting  subliminal elitism message of
Mexicans do not know how to eat Mexican Foods in furtherance of your Racist
attitude?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Ya think maybe that is the answer to why the evolutionary process of cooking
is different in various parts of a country or a region and why your endless
banter of Tacos and Tamales is stupidly childish. You eschewing the
commonality of man while pretending you are socially and racially superior
is pathetic

One can only hope you would go there if you continue to use such asinine
comments as this one.

Speaking of Continents!    What Continent are you in your  Head Busting Hank
persona talking about here?   "There's a whole friggin' CONTINENT over there
somewhere, it's for Latrinos.
Follow the smell. You'll find it."

Jack,  beating around a bush is never a solution, you have to say what you
mean and mean what you say.   It does not hurt my feelings at all  you
trying to tell me to knock it off and do understand I did read it the first
time.  I just ignored it out of respect but you need to  understand that
well intended and well meaning folks getting in the middle trying to play
Swiss do not help anything nor do I respect that position.  In my world it
is you either stand  for what you believe is right or you stand aside.
There is no little jackal going to get away with drinking with the herd in
the day and  then pissing  in the pool at night.

I am sure you will give sage advice here after some careful thought , just
understand where I stand and please refrain from diminishing my point about
this.
