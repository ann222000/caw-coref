try to ignore the problems associated with following comments made
inside a blog comment thinger that doesn't allow quoting nor nested

you're smart enough to read past those limitations, right?

i mean, for instance, being the software whiz that yo are, you can
make it past the html tag thingers, no?

so have at it.

put your creative juices on that gem.

Amen, bruthah. Amen.

How about this: Last night, while I was driving my trusty cart around at the
concert, I met a woman who is a ten-year surviver of cancer ... and she's
only 18 years old.

She has a t-shirt that says &quot;Anyone who says winning isn't everything never

Nah. At the time, we were sitting in our golf carts waiting for victims--I
mean passengers--to come along and hitch a ride. I just told her she had
more courage than anyone I'd ever met and I was proud to know her. In this
world we live in that's chock-full of &quot;Look at me! Whaah! Poor me! I'm so
helpless!&quot; slobs, people like her are truly an inspiration.

I just learned that a (very former) girl in my HS class committed
suicide. Seems she'd been in mental hospitals for two or three years.
Hit everyone kind of hard, because many of us had spent 13 years
growing up with her . . . Anyway, lots of discussion ensued, with some
wondering how someone could possibly do such a thing, others
describing their own experiences with depression, or treating
depressed patients, or with loved ones who had been depressed, or in
one case even a suicide attempt.

Interesting to learn what people go through, how miserable many of
them were in high school, how even those who seem to have nearly ideal
lives may be struggling inside. And it kind of puts your own problems
in perspective . . .

Okay.

Today I spent the day auditioning actresses. I wanted an American
actress that could give me the voice of either;

a) Californian Valley girl, or
b) Sultry Southern belle.

All of the actress auditioned were Americans living in England. All of
the had an accent slightly less suitable than, say, me.

Doesn't take you long to lose it, I guess.

Well, you know, there was the day me and Ray were in our foxholes on
the angled deck. Bombs falling to the left of us, bombs falling to the
right of us, and I'm allergic to fucking foxes and they were making me
sneeze and they were munching on the remains of Sylvia's parrot and
the feathers were everywhere which was making me sneeze worse.  So
anyway, I figured I needed some Kleenex, and for that, I needed to
leave my foxhole and go to the convenience store abaft the fo'c'sle.

Anyway, the deck was being ranked by machine gun fire and I was
dodging the bullets, and then all of a sudden, I let loose with a huge
sneeze -- a-CHOO! -- and I say Oh, Shit because I'm standing right on
top of a VC tunnel and next thing I know there's a grenade at my feet
and it goes off and fortunately I'm wearing a very big St.
Christopher's medal so all it does is sever my torso from my legs.

So this is very weird because my legs are running one direction and
I've been thrown in the other, and no matter what I say to them they
won't come back. Whereupon Ray emerges from his foxhole. And not only
does he brave the withering machine gun fire and the Russian Daisy
Cutterskis that are raining down on us, he grabs my torso in one hand
and my legs in the other and carries me straight to the infirmary,
where using recently-developed microsurgical techniques the doctors
sew me back together.

So you see, I owe Ray my life. They were going to award him the
Congressional Medal of Honor, but in those days they didn't give
medals to Jews, so in order to be fair, they didn't give one to Ray
either.

&gt;Today I spent the day auditioning actresses. I wanted an American

&gt;a) Californian Valley girl, or

&gt;All of the actress auditioned were Americans living in England. All of

How many Americans actually speak like that, though? One hears a lot
of Valley Girl because most films are made in LA, and Southern Belle
mostly, I suspect, through the efforts of dialogue coaches.

&gt;&gt;give it your best shot, so to speak.

&gt;&gt;  Mr. Raymond Haddad (the nice guy terrorist)

&gt;&gt;ignore my sarcasm.

&gt;&gt;just get on with it.

&gt;&gt;tell us a few delightful stories about what led you to your Miraculous

&gt;&gt;we want to like Ray.

&gt;&gt;we really do.

&gt;&gt;if it weren't for Ray himself, we probably *would* like him.

&gt;&gt;so help us out here, k?

&gt;&gt;tell us about the day that your Ray universe changed.

&gt;&gt;thanks in advance.

&gt;Well, you know, there was the day me and Ray were in our foxholes on
&gt;the angled deck. Bombs falling to the left of us, bombs falling to the
&gt;right of us, and I'm allergic to fucking foxes and they were making me
&gt;sneeze and they were munching on the remains of Sylvia's parrot and
&gt;the feathers were everywhere which was making me sneeze worse.  So
&gt;anyway, I figured I needed some Kleenex, and for that, I needed to
&gt;leave my foxhole and go to the convenience store abaft the fo'c'sle.

&gt;Anyway, the deck was being ranked by machine gun fire and I was
&gt;dodging the bullets, and then all of a sudden, I let loose with a huge
&gt;sneeze -- a-CHOO! -- and I say Oh, Shit because I'm standing right on

One of these actresses today was about four feet tall - made Sylvia
look like a giant.

I explained to her that when we mentioned the motion capture stuff on
the advert, she failed to point out that she was so tiny, and therefore
useless to us.

She then spoke to me in an almost inaudible squeaking. I've no idea
what she's &quot;acted&quot; in before, but I'm kinda thinking she didn't play an
adult.

Chef Bob:  &quot;And never mind smoking a chicken.
Can't keep 'em lit.&quot;

Miz Sylvia:  &quot;Yer using the wrong kinda paper.&quot;

Sir Throckey:  &quot;I suppose you think it's funny to mislead
people this way, Sylvia, but I have appointed
myself to be net nanny for the month, and I
say it's inappropriate.

&quot;Mr. Bob would be well advise to soak some
suet in brandy for a couple of hours and
scatter it around the barnyard. This will
get his  chickens good and lit. Then he
can go on with the old turkey baster full
of kerosene bit. &quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Amen, bruthah. Amen.

&gt;&gt;&gt;How about this: Last night, while I was driving my trusty cart around at
&gt;&gt;&gt;the concert, I met a woman who is a ten-year surviver of cancer ... and
&gt;&gt;&gt;she's only 18 years old.

&gt;&gt;&gt;She has a t-shirt that says &quot;Anyone who says winning isn't everything
&gt;&gt;&gt;never had cancer.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Kinda makes you think, eh?

&gt;&gt; Didja grab her and give her a big hug?  I woulda.  'Course I'm a dirty old
&gt;&gt; man, but that ain't why.

&gt;Nah. At the time, we were sitting in our golf carts waiting for victims--I
&gt;mean passengers--to come along and hitch a ride. I just told her she had
&gt;more courage than anyone I'd ever met and I was proud to know her. In this
&gt;world we live in that's chock-full of &quot;Look at me! Whaah! Poor me! I'm so
&gt;helpless!&quot; slobs, people like her are truly an inspiration.

Finding someone who can confront reality without crumbling is a good
thing.  Being one is something that might be worth aspiring to.  Or,
not.  Whimpering over hangnails can be, like, so comforting.
