Any recommendations on where to get the right fan? Also, the best
place to mount it? My monitor goes black after 20-30 minutes but comes
back if I leave the game off a while. Hoping a fan will remedy...

Thanks in advance, help is greatly appreciated :)

get a 110 volt fan. tap into the voltage 110VAC. mount it to the wood
platform that is under the neck of the monitor. point it so that it
blows on the neck and cage transistors.

The chassis-mounted deflection transistors are what fail most often, so I'd
suggest aiming at them instead.  This is what the Tempest-&gt;Major Havoc
conversion kit does.

A fan isn't going to fix your problem.  Could be a number of things,
but I'd start by looking to see if the spot killer light comes on when
the monitor goes black.  Assuming you're new to the hobby, I'd try and
find a local collector/tech and ply him with beer and/or money to give
you a hand.

The Tempest-&gt;MH conversion came with an intake fan that blew cool air

I agree with Rob. A properly running 6100 in a Tempest does not need a
cooling fan. I would suggest allowing it to fail and then determining the
cause of the problem instead of simply eliminating the symptom.

Thats what i said.....i said &quot;cage transistors&quot; same as
deflection.......

actually in mine, i have 3 fans.
1- blows on audio/reg pcb
1 blows at the neckboard/deflection xsistors
1 blows out above the back door

same hookup on my star wars, major havoc, space duel, gravitar,  and
all color vector games.

yes they do need this. why do you think star wars has a stock fan?
atari learned this AFTER tempest.
they also need a cold house and its best to run them (the backs of
the games) about 12 inches from the wall and with the back doors off
actually.

im speaking from major experience in color vectors and what makes the
games run longest. i even have some on location......that run well:)

Not trying to get into some kind of dork contest with you here but since when do
the deflection transistors, which are mounted on the monitor frame, get called
&quot;cage&quot; transistors?  When discussing WG6100 monitors, the &quot;cage&quot; is where the
HVT is located.  Again, not looking to split technical hairs here, but noting
why there was some misunderstanding about where you were talking about aiming
the fan.

Star Wars had an Amplifone monitor in it. WG 6100 should not need fans in
any game it originally came in.

I put a fan directed at the neck. It's run for several hours without
going out. It only gets played for a couple hours a week max so I am
going to consider it fixed for now. Thanks to everyone for the advice.

Thats not true and is partially why the monitors failed. When we fixed
6100's back in the day part of the repair was to add fans. They
usually lasted several times longer with fans added. Even 6400's
needed fans. Tell ya what, LV2000's or something like them would have
saved us LOTS of money on transistors. Back then the 3716's and 3792's
were in the $14 to $20 range EACH depending on where you bought them.

Just because the manufactures didn't add fans doesn't mean it didn't
need them. Pole Position CPU's could have used a cage with several
fans but Atari didn't add them until it was too late.
