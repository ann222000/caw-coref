Here's a 16 year old boy's diary entry.

Monday, November 11, 1918
315 Days Past 50 to Come

Got up at 6 and celebrated peace. Trimmed Olds with Peter and Toby
to help. Had parade in P.M. Made date with Anna for the dance
tonight, but she called up &amp; said she couldn't go on account of
the flu [epidemic]. Her mother interfered. Went down town for
a little while in evening.

"/> I love that! Ephemera(sp?) it's called isn't it? Whatever it is I feel like
I'm reading a historical novel, do you have anymore?
Last year I found a book that had been described as one of the first historical
biographies that gives an account of England's royalty yet written in such a
way you can lose yourself like one would in a novel. I'm saving it for my trip
across country. If anyone would like to know the name of the book let me know
okay?
Again thank you Mary for sharing that, if you have anymore of his diary I would
love to hear it.

"/> -----------------
Joan - Actually the word ephemera has been misapplied of late in the antique
&quot;industry.&quot; It has its roots in zoology, coming from a reference to a may
fly, an insect that lives for a day. Hence, ephemeral means short lived
and, as it applies to paper collecting, originally meant something that was
meant to be thrown away - short lived - campaign flyers, bill heads,
advertising, magazines, etc. It has grown to include anything and
everything made of paper. Perhaps common usage will corrupt the word so
that it encompasses all paper. Books, certainly diaries, are, however, not
ephemera as they are not by definition ephemeral.

I agree, however, with your sentiments. I really enjoyed her post and would
love to see more.

Can you imagine if that word were to become common usage? Considering I still
need to refer to your post just to keep reminding myself how it is spelled, the
person who seems a bit obsessive in correcting everyone's spelling, along with
a zillion others with that common affliction, could very well cause a
nationwide panic among them as they try to keep up with making sure we all
spell ephemera correctly.
As for the post I did ask Mary if she wouldn't mind sharing more, hopefully she
will.
And of course the dissertation of the word ephemera is as always informative
and interesting.
Good to have you back,
Joan
ps: Did you note my prediction came true? You are such the mediator, I bet
you settle all the arguments that crop up in your family! &lt;grin&gt;

"/> Maybe I can do that, but (blush) you'll have to tell me which car is
which. That year the family had an Olds and a Lozier. One was a
6-cylinder touring car and the other was an 8-cylinder roadster. One
was referred to as the &quot;big car&quot; (presumably the touring car).

If you can tell me which was the Olds, I will cull out the appropriate
entries.

Or would you like to hear it all?

Mary - The Olds is the Oldsmobile. Olds was actually Ransom E. Olds who
also &quot;fathered&quot; the REO, which bears his initials.

Hey Mary,
Have you thought about posting each day's diary entry to rec.antiques on
the corresponding day for a while? (Or part of each entry, or one every
few days.) That's asking a lot of you, but it would be great fun for the
rest of us!

"/> Transcribing these diaries is something I've been putting off for some
time now, although I have done his first trip to California (1913) and
an automobile trip to Yellowstone in the early 20's (oh, the
breakdowns).

Is there an easy way to concatenate text files, either with DOS or
Windows 3.xx? I've been unable to figure out how to do it with my
favorite word processing program (Word Express) and I really loathe
Microsoft Word, although the &quot;sections&quot; features could be used.

I'm thinking I could do a week or two at a whack and paste them
together for my (and family's) use.

"/> ______

Lozier never made an eight-cylinder car, so the Olds would have been
the roadster. The six-cylinder Lozier touring car would, indeed, have
been the larger of the two. And yup, I'd like to hear it all.

The kid would be 96 today, so I assume he's maybe no longer around.
But it's interesting to ponder what he'd think about his diary going
out on the electrons.

This is a case where my new voice-recognition software -- Dragon
Naturally Speaking -- would be the thing to have. You could just read
the diary into the microphone and the words would appear on the
screen. The technology has come a long way since first I saw it six
or seven years ago, and it really works well.

I do have to spend some more time with it, though, getting it to cope
with my pronunciation. I dictated some directions into e-mail the
other night so a friend could get to my house from New Jersey, and the
program went into convulsions over &quot;Verrazano Narrows Bridge.&quot; Dumb
damn box!
