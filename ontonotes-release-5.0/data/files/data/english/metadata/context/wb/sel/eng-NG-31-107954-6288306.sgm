a recent thread that turned into an argument over recumbents reminded
me of some ideas i've had for a long time.  in the interests of
stirring debate, i'm posting.

1) a recumbent forces the rider into a supine position, with the legs
elevated and spread (to pedal). to my way of thinking, the position
suggests feminine passivity to a lot of self-conscious
men--particularly relative to the more "masculine" prone position that
an upright bike places the rider in.  since the majority of adult bike
purchasers are men, and the vast majority of bike store personnel are
men, the effect of this association steers men who would consider a
recumbent to a regular bike.

a similar thing probably happens for step-throughs, by virtue of the
fact that most people think of them as "women's bike's."  the step
through is a practical choice for many purposes--particularly biking to
work in regular pants--but you rarely see a guy one.

2) i think a lot of guys wouldn't consider a recumbent since they're
worried about looking like geeks. practically no one rides them, so a
guy riding one draws attention, which most people--men or women--hate.
and most of them--actually all of them--are awkward looking, relative
to an upright bike.  usually the pedals are at the front of the frame,
often on a tube extending forward from the frame.  the drivetrain is a
couple of feet long, stretching in space from the pedals to the rear
hub.  steering is either by "chopper" handlebars or handlebars
positioned by the rider's pelvis.  the most attractive of a
funny-looking lot are the electras, which aren't marketed as
recumbents.

Dear Chris,

Here's a woman bike rider with her "handlebars positioned by the
rider's pelvis":

One reason that recumbents don't catch on is that kids are the primary
bicycle market, and kids can't fool around with a recumbent:

You haven't seen enough 'bents, you haven't read the minds of enough

You haven't looked at the folks riding around here.  True, the vast
majority of road bikes are both horizontal-top-tube designs *and*
ridden by men, but once you leave that category, it's far from
uncommon to see a guy on a drop-frame bike.  The biggest reason that
they don't is that most frop-frames are too small.  Try finding a
drop-frame in a 59cm size.  It's close to impossible.

In the case of the road bike riders, I don't think you can prove
psychological causation for them either; if you've ever ridden a
drop-frame roadie, you will know that the added flex in the frame and
complexity of cable routing (relative to the same model with a
conventional layout) is enough to cause problems.  On the other hand,
the popularity of compact-frame roadies, which feature a sloping top
tube, is increasing with good reason...for both sexes of rider.

And you haven't seen many 'bents from *my* point of view.  The most

You betcha.

The number one and two reasons why so few 'bents are sold are
extremely simple and obvious.

For the average bike buyer, they cost too much.

For the performance bike buyer, they aren't what that kind of rider is
looking to buy.

About that latter category, whether the buyers intend to actually
engage in competition or not, they want to *appear* that they
could...and anyone familiar with bike racing is aware that 'bents are
not permitted in the majority of types of competition.  Anyone who is
not familiar with bike racing stands a good chance of not having any
concept that 'bents exist as an option, and/or not wanting one because
it just Doesn't Look Like What Lance[1] Rides....and Everybody Knows
That Lance Rides The Good Stuff.

Salesmen tend to sell what the customers ask for.  If the customers
come in wanting road bikes, the salesman is likely to try to sell them
what they want from among the ones on the sales floor, possibly having
to order a different size of a model that's on hand.  If they come in
wanting 'bents, they'll most likely get shown a bunch of illustrations
in catalogs.  Which approach do you think is going to generate more
sales?

"Why aren't more 'bents sold?" is as much of a chicken-and-egg issue
as anything else.  Until 'bents become more visibly popular, there
aren't likely to be many people coming in to buy one...and until more
people come in to buy one, they aren't going to be in showrooms or on
the road in numbers sufficient to be perceived as popular.

The herd mentality is a much more powerful force in *this* regard than
in the manner that you posited.

[1]  We're talking the generic Lance here. the guy that the buyer
perceives as Mr Real Bike Rider, whoever it may be.  It could be
shaped by somebody at work, somebody they've seen on ESPN, or
whatever.

In my experience, it is women that are more conscious about riding a
recumbent than men are.

Beyond that, I tend to think it has to do with the fact that recumbents
aren't as economical to make or buy, because of the matter of
economy-of-scale. The segment of the population that could most benefit
from recumbents (people who don't ride at all because they think it's
uncomfortable) are also the people who are least likely to spend a lot
of money on a bicycle (because they don't expect it will be very
enjoyable, or useful).

As for what bike shops sell, when selecting bicycles to sell they
balance the criteria of dealer support and low prices, and from then on
they [mostly] just push what they have on their floor. A typical bike
shop would rather sell you a dozen different saddles than tell you where
else to go to buy a bike that doesn't hurt to ride.

Step-throughs aren't that much more convenient than a normal bike. They
do nothing to address the two main complaints of riding, which are
saddle pain and hand numbness.

This I somewhat agree with. In the USA, bicycles are typically seen as
more recreational than practical, and there is a tremendous amount of
peer pressure among upright riders to buy "racing" parts and bikes, if
they will ever need them or not, or even if they will be /comfortable/
on them or not. I have seen many times, even people who have extensive
problems with riding comfort on upright bikes will not consider anything
else, even though riding comfort is the main advantage of recumbents,
and most of these same people have never entered nor do they plan on
entering any sanctioned event that would require a UCI-legal bike.

Ummm,,,, Electras are NOT recumbents, not even close.
The Electras are a relaxed-geometry frame, most-likely built on a
regular production line (and limited by the geometry range that line
tooling can provide).

The recumbents that are truly aero tend to be clumsy to maneuver and
heavy. The recumbents that are aero and light tend to be really clumsy
and the position doesn't allow for easy looking around. The really aero
(fully faired) bikes are typically clumsy and heavy, plus they get wacky
in sidewinds.

Basically, the more aerodynamically efficient a recumbent gets, the less
likely it will be pleasant to ride around on normal roads. It also
becomes more fussy: without wanting to fall into the trap of defining
the major differences as the major advantages of a DF bike, anyone with
a modicum of skill can ride an upright bike up or down a curb, use body
weight to mitigate the effect of road obstacles (potholes, speed bumps,
etc.).

To really get the aero benefits of a recumbent, it needs to be long and low
to the ground. As a city dweller I need to be able to see over as
much traffic as possible, turn sharply to thread my way between cars and
other obstacles and hop on and off footpaths. A recumbent would be
suicidal in these conditions. I may be heading for the hills, but I don't
want to get hit on the way there.

And then there's group riding, which I do a lot. Unless everyone else
also rode a recumbent, I wouldn't be able to see much when not at
the front, which'd be dangerous again.

ISTM that the only kind of rider likely to avoid these problems is
one who lives and rides alone outside cities.

When I see step-throughs my first thoughts are "flexy and/or heavy",
not "that's a woman's bike". A second consideration would be "a bike
belonging to someone who favors ease of mount/dismount prior to snappy
response". (which quite incidentially often happens to be a woman)

I 've had two step-throughs, one was beater that I'd gotten for free.
It was unpleasantly flexy already from the start and eventually
cracked, although admittedly helped along by substantial amounts of
rust.  The other was a 10 speed road bike with a so-called mixte frame,
another freebie. I rode it because it was the one available, but flex
and weight was an issue and I retired it as soon as I'd gotten myself
another bike. The fork became a truing stand and the frame was cut up
for its tubes.

I'd gladly consider a step through, but until it can be given the
rigidity and weight of a diamond frame it will remain a second choice
for everything but sedate riding.

certainly not about to start worrying about the shape of my bike!
Well, maybe if it was strange enough to cause other riders/drivers to
lose concentration...

The main reason why I earlier didn't even try a 'bent was availability.
I must have been around 15 when I first saw one IRL. That was also the
first one in "practical" configuration, the pics I can remember prior
to that had all been full fairing race bikes, or pedal cars.

The reason why I still haven't tried one is again availability, backed
up by cost and storage space. Today I know where to get one, but w/o
any experience it's hard to know whether it'd be worth it. Today I also
quite probably have the fabricating skills and most of the parts needed
to build one. That would pretty much solve the cost issue, but then
again, it's not like I NEED to find another project either...

The general advantage of a recumbent is not that it is more aerodynamic,
but that it is more comfortable to ride. SOME types are more aerodynamic
than a conventional upright bicycle, while others aren't. Shockingly
enough, the slower types are sold on the basis of riding comfort /alone/.

Firstly--it is true that a recumbent is not as maneuverable as an
upright--but then for typical on-road riding, a lot of the
maneuverability an upright bike allows isn't really necessary.

Secondly, recumbents are a lot more specialized than upright bikes are;
the riding position that upright bikes use is essentially the same
across most-all uses. The variations in aerodynamics between recumbent
types (and even between different models within the same type) is much
wider.

...This does mean that some recumbent types are not generally suitable
for all types of riding. A lowracer would have very poor visibility in
congested urban traffic, for example--but then, most people experienced
with recumbents would agree that this would be a poor choice of bicycle
for city riding anyway. A lowracer is built for extended cruising at

Why?  When I've passed recumbent riders, I've been on my touring bike.
And among uprights, my touring bike is not "one of the faster types."

Some details might be interesting here.  As I said, just two guys I
ride with normally use recumbents.

For a century ride a few years ago, one of the guys had installed his
full fairing.  We ended up riding near each other for maybe ten miles
or so.  This included one section of rough, narrow road that was losing
altitude - overall average, maybe 2% or 3% downhill - but doing it in a
series of choppy rollers.  That is, short steep down, short steep up,
etc. as it made its way gradually down.  The next section was a state
highway with a long, straight, consistent downhill of maybe 3 or 4
percent?  (That's a guess.)

The choppy rollers went like this:  he'd pull way ahead on each steep
downhill;  I'd pass him again on each steep uphill.  We did that
several times, until we finally got to a point where the uphills
stopped competing with the steep downhills.  He then pulled away from
me.

When we hit the state highway, he was perhaps half a mile ahead of me.
At that point, I tucked down on my aero bar (yes, I have one on my
touring bike) and coasted.  IIRC, I was coasting between 20 and 25 mph.
I was pretty amazed that he was not pulling away from me, from what I
could tell.

I ended up finishing the century ahead of him, but he was complaining
of leg cramps.  Not that it was a race.  I was just riding my ride,
while interested in the performance of his bike.  FWIW, neither of us
is anything close to a racer.

Now, his full fairing is a homemade thing, and could certainly be
improved.  And there's always the possibility that he had some
unrecognized mechanical problem, like (say) a dragging brake.   But
overall, I didn't see any tremendous advantages to his big box.

I don't think I have an especially onerous commute, and yet the normal
route takes me off a small curb drop, at which point I do a very tight
right turn into the travel lane. It has a few places where I may climb a
curb in certain rare circumstances, and the ride onto my own lawn
involves a grass verge that has a nearly 45 degree slope about 50cm
high. I'd pay money to see a 'bent negotiate that!

My entry into my office involves a brief ride through a very narrow
passage, a walk through a few doors, and a short climb up a flight of
stairs to the bike rack.

I don't think of my route as especially unusual. If most people might
not have all of these details, they are likely to have other ones. I'm
sure a 'bent rider could accommodate all of these challenges, but it
would likely all add time or inconvenience.

Well, no.
Probably the two most common complaints upright riders have is of saddle
pain and numb hands, and recumbent riders generally don't wear padded
shorts or gloves ("recumbent" riding shorts are lycra, but they are made
specifically without padding). As far as long-distance riding goes, you

Is this true?  The perception is that a recumbent is lower and
therefore will not be seen as easily as an upright bike.  But with
upright bikes do car drivers just sort of notice them and then
immediately forget about them and run the bike over.  But with a
recumbent is it so unusual that the car driver will see them and
remember them.  The oddness and rarity of the recumbent makes it more
noticeable than the somewhat commonly seen upright bike.  Some
recumbent bikes have the pole and flag on them to overcome this
perceived lack of visibility.  Never seen a pole and flag on an upright
bike.

Interestingly, they were about as popular as foam hats, back when the
latter were first invented and marketed.  But they didn't stay as
popular.

Compared to foam hats, the flags were probably too easy to make in a
garage-sized shop.  No big corporation (like Bell Sports) could
dominate production.  No big corporation could splash full-page ads in
Buycycling Magazine to instill fear and corner the market.  No big
corporation could guarantee its sales by recruiting lobbyists to make
its product mandatory.  So the flags faded from popularity.

However, I have seen them occasionally on modern bikes.  Vermont
Bicycle Tours supplies them on all their rental bikes.

People presume that the more cyclists the more they are noticed and that
is the reason for the fewer crashes per cyclist. I don't buy that
explanation, at least not as the sole explanation. I think it is more
likely do to with urbanization/densification and bicyclist "education."
Increasing densification makes driving more miserable (slower due to
congestion and traffic lights, parking trouble) and cycling more
attractive. Slower travel reduces collisons. Regarding "education," more
cyclists means better behavior due to blinking lights at night (monkey
see monkey do), and more correct direction riding (Hey dumbass, get on
the right side of the road!)

From my observations of the local riding populace, it appears that
we're seeing an increase in the number of inexperienced and/or
somewhat clumsy riders who dismount ungracefully and/or unexpectedly
in a forward direction, and land on the top tube.  They only have to
do that once, or perhaps twice if they were lucky the first time,
before the attraction of a compact frame becomes a factor.

My experience is the main excuses for not riding much come down to
issues of confidence, skill (for lack of a better word; we're talking
clumsy or unpracticed riders), or perceived safety. None of these
non-riders (or not-much riders) generally spend enough time on any bike
for comfort to be a factor.

Of the ones who spend enough time on a bike to actually get
uncomfortable, I know of one that stopped because of comfort. He had
substantial mid-life spinal disc degeneration, and switched to running,
and is the guy I talked about who might get a 'bent. LWB, most likely.
I've pointed him at 'bents that I've come across.

There are plenty of mitigations for comfort issues with saddle pain and
numb hands. Getting the right saddle is important (once I found a cheap
one that fit me well, I gathered up every one I could find), but not
hard. I do multi-hour rides with ease.

I have no firsthand experience, but I suspect many 'bent riders go
through a similar process of finding a saddle that is just right.

As for numb hands, it's a matter of bar position mostly:

http://www.sheldonbrown.com/handsup.html

Sheldon's general article on cycling pain covers most of the details:

http://www.sheldonbrown.com/pain.html

I think the great mass of people who avoid cycling due to actual comfort
issues are few. Certainly, I know people who think dual-suspension (for
substantially paved riding) is the route to cycling nirvana, but as far
as I can tell, most of those riders are choosing their first bicycle as
a teen or adult, and few do so with the counsel of an experienced
cyclist.

Regarding Shermer's Neck, duly conceded: DF bikes are unsuitable for
rides in excess of 90 continuous hours. I am not aware of Shermer's Neck
as a major issue for PBP riders or tourists who stop at least once a day.

&gt; &gt; sure a 'bent rider could accommodate all of these challenges, but it
&gt; &gt; would likely all add time or inconvenience.

&gt; Well it's good to see you're keeping an open mind.

&gt; &gt; The issue with 'bents is exposed: the comfy ones are slow, the fast ones
&gt; &gt; are sketchy and specialized. I don't think the UCI is keeping them down.

&gt; The UCI isn't keeping them down; they don't make recumbents more
&gt; expensive. They're just afraid they'll win all the races.
">

How to say this diplomatically? The HPVs out there competing for HPV
speed records seem to me like an interesting pursuit of technology and
sport. But they're as specialized as the Thrust SSC.

Let's leave aside the tricky question of mass-start road races, and
consider only the obvious proving ground of TT events. As recumbents
become faster (lower, more faired), they also tend to be harder to ride.
More wind-sensitive, more fussy, worse outward vision, less stable, even
less comfortable. Many of the fastest HPVs are virtually unrideable for
more than a few minutes: in longer-duration events and races, these
bikes tend to undergo modifications ranging from extra ventilation to
expanded steering range to rider cooling systems.

I think the unintentionally hilarious apotheosis of this phenomenon was
the HPV land speed challenger a few years back that had only a video
camera for forward vision. The machine turned out to be unrideable, even
on the dead-straight land speed course.

Sure, bad design, bad rider, but still.

Let me be clear: in a libre TT formula, something that was recognizably
a recumbent would win every pro TT that wasn't a pure hillclimb.

But on the other hand, current TT bikes, which are not only surprisingly
aero compared to the less exotic recumbents, are just bikes with funny
handlebars. Anyone here could jump aboard a CSC team-spec Cervelo P3C
and ride it across town. The worst trouble might be the reach to the
shifters, and admittedly you wouldn't spend much time on the aero bars.
But it's just a plain old bike.

That the DF is a compromise is no surprise, but it's a really good
compromise for most riders. It combines agility, easy visibility (for
both seeing and being seen), very good performance in a wide range of
conditions, simplicity, and a compact design (even when it's not a
compact frame...). Recumbents have a lot to compete with.

The comfy ones are slow, the fast ones are sketchy,

To a certain extend what you observe depends on where you're located.
And you really need to look at what sells on the LOW end of the market,
because these are the toughest customers, most intolerant of
inconvenience. People who will pay $3000 for a road bike have already
committed themselves to riding, and have resolved themselves to the fact
that it's painful--either as a result of needing a competition-legal
bike, or (much more often) because they aren't aware of anything
drastically better.

At the low end of the US market there are four types of bikes commonly
available: road bikes, MTB's, hybrids and comfort bikes. Low-end road
bikes and MTBs are patterned directly after their upper-end racing
versions. Hybrids and comfort bikes are not. Hybrids were invented for
people who liked the MTB riding position better than road bikes, but who
didn't need the heavy-duty construction. Comfort bikes were patterned
after hybrids, but made changes such as riser handlebars and bigger and
lower seats.

Who drove the market in hybrids and comfort bikes? People who won't ride
because it is physically uncomfortable.

Why are "mitigations" even necessary? Because of a poor design.

If you had bought a recumbent bike, it would likely only have one seat
available, that one would work just fine for you and the vast majority
of the rest of humanity, and you still wouldn't need to wear padded
shorts or padded gloves to ride it. I don't even /own/ any padded shorts
or gloves anymore.

I also question how "painless" [any upright rider] thinks their ride is,
when they haven't tried anything better. There is an enormous difference
in comfort between recumbents and uprights and the longer the ride is,
the more dramatic that difference becomes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have no firsthand experience, but I suspect many 'bent riders go
&gt; through a similar process of finding a saddle that is just right.
">

No, not really. Most recumbents are only ever available with one type of
seat, often that seat cannot be changed (with many trikes it's even
integral with the frame) and there's only about four or five different
types total. People may have their preferences but it's very rare to see
someone (with no health conditions such as a back injury) claim that a
certain seat is practically unusable.

I don't know how much experience Sheldon has with recumbents. As far as
I've heard he was only driven to one due to declining health. Many of
the issues on his "page of pain" pretty much don't occur on a recumbent
at all and when they do occur, they are often far less severe than what
you'd experience on an upright bike.

This is a common perception however, that recumbents are only for people
who cannot tolerate an upright bike. I have had both kinds of bicycles,
and I've found that I enjoy riding a lot more when it hurts less.

Funny you should mention dual-suspension; the last upright bike I kept
was a Pro-Flex 856 MTB with slicks for street riding.

A lot of "experienced cyclists" don't know as much as they think they
do. Most bike shops don't have recumbents at all, and they'd rather sell
a person a dozen different seats than tell them where to go to get a
bicycle that doesn't hurt to ride.

The bicycles you are talking about are called "faired streamliners". To
allow them against conventional unfaired bicycles certainly wouldn't be
much of a contest--but many recumbents have lower drag, even without the
use of fairings. It would be enough for UCI to change the rules to say
"any vehicle propelled by human power, and without devices for
aerodynamic benefit alone". Team Bachetta seems to do pretty well
without fairings.

Sorry, but that's bullshit.  You're describing ordinary cycling as a
masochistic experience.  But my ordinary riding is NOT painful.  It's
not uncomfortable in the least.

The only discomfort I feel is if I'm overextending myself, as in riding
a 75 mile ride when I haven't yet gone beyond, say, 35 miles.  Maybe
that's easier on recumbent riders, but I know it's not perfectly
comfortable for them, either.  Read upthread about that recumbent rider
suffering leg cramps on a century ride.

You're also ignoring the fact that I've known several cyclists who took
up recumbents, then gave them up and went back to uprights.   They
obviously disagreed with your evaluations.

It's a fiction that many bikes are designed by copying racing bikes.

Try reading some of the history of bike design.  Jan Heine, of Bicycle
Quarterly magazine, has demonstrated pretty convincingly that the
Technical Trials of the 1930s caused touring bikes to lead racing bikes
in innovation.  The purpose of those Trials was to advance the design
of bikes for touring, and to do so, the Trials rewarded multiple gears,
fenders, lights, luggage capacity, and other items that meant nothing
to racers.  If recumbents really were so obviously superior, the crowd
promoting the Trials would certainly have endorsed them, whether or not
they were legal for racing.

If you look at a $300 road bike in any bike shop (today that is,,, not

the pro bikes are lighter and have mechanical parts that function
somewhat better, but if you squint a bit, you can't see a whole lot of
difference between them. The overall riding positions and frame
geometries are very close. With MTB's it's the same story as well,
between department-store examples and ones used at the top levels.

This is the surprising part about upright bikes--the expensive ones tend
to have the same comfort issues as the cheap ones.

&gt; So what is the definition of &quot;recumbutt&quot; again?

Some people do have this problem, one type of recumbent seat seems to be
prone to it. But most people do not, and even many that do (on that
page) say it's not severe enough to keep them from riding. Only that it
is not ideal. ----And I stand by my earlier assertion that most
recumbent companies do not offer /any/ choice of seats. The seat
attachments are not standardized.

...I do tend to get some mild recumbutt after 4-5 hours of continuous,
non-stop riding (that is, always on the bike pedaling, not stopping at
all). If I get off for a bit, I'm okay for another 4-5 hours. This is
casual riding, I've not ever entered a race. It generally takes much
longer on a recumbent to experience seat pain, and even at that--what
you do experience is far less severe than what you'll get from an
upright bike's saddle.

Here's a fun question--can anyone name /any/ upright bicycles that will
not accept standard seats? (-current or relatively-recent manufacture,
no antiques please-) If the manufacturer felt the seat was truly ideal,
then owners wouldn't need to change it, correct?
I know of only the RANS CF bikes (Fusion, Cruz, ect), and these are
"semi-recumbnets", made by a recumbent-bike company.
Are there any others?.....

I have often seen it asserted that on an upright bicycle, the saddle is
not supposed to support the entire weight of the riders torso--and that
the rider (if they are using proper form) is supposed to partially
support the weight of their torso with their arms and legs.

Now, I think this is a sad excuse for what is simply a poor bicycle
design. I know back when I had upright bikes I certainly didn't ride
like this, and I'd be willing to bet that the vast majority of other
bicycle riders don't either, judging from the huge number of saddle pain
complaints seen here and elsewhere. I'd certainly bet that no "casual"
riders do, and I would be willing to bet that /most/ of the time, most
competition riders don't either. Most people seem to do the same thing
that I did--they sit their full weight on the saddle until it hurts, and
then they scoot around or stand for a short time until some of the pain
recedes, and then they sit back down on the saddle until it hurts too
much again. I know I have seen photos of ultra-riders standing and
pedaling over flat terrain, just to get a break from the saddle pain (as
well as pedaling with one hand and then the other on the bars, to get a
break from numb hands--but anyway-)....

I would love to see where this has been measured: like, with actual
strain gauges on bike seatposts, especially among casual/commuter riders
(of ANY country in the world, anywhere would do). ...Or perhaps, someone
could do an informal study, by taking photos of Brooks "springer"
saddles--and we could visually gauge the amount of spring deflection,
and estimate how much of the rider's weight is being rested on the saddle.
Anyone in Denmark up for this game?
Lots of bicycles there in photos I see, lots of springer saddles too.
How many people in Denmark are riding around, levitating on their bicycles?
,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
But that's not the MAIN question I have.
What I want to know is, when was the "levitation" form of riding first
prescribed as a "solution" to saddle pain? I have seen a number of
very-old photographs of bicyclists, and every last one of them seemed to
be resting their full weight upon their saddles. At SOME point, bicycle
marketing seems to have switched from trying to find better seating
accommodations, to just admitting that upright saddles hurt to ride, and
telling the customer it's their fault.
When did this happen?

When I think of that assertion, I think of "sport" vs "utility" riding.

IMHO the assertion applies to the former, but not the latter.

The tradeoff seems to be thigh clearance vs butt accommodation.

If you don't think the arms are supporting a large part of the weight
of your torso on an upright bike, try this experiment...

1) Get into a typical riding position with your hands out on the brake
hoods and your arms slightly bent.
2) Take your hands off the brake hoods.
3) Notice that you can't hold that position for very long without
feeling the strain of keeping your torso in that position in your
abdominal muscles.

Just for grins, I did a quick Fogelesqe experiment.  I wedged a
bathroom scale under my headlight mount, and on top of the left brake
hood.  My 'cross bike is set up with the bars quite high (by my
standards, at least), and is a very typical riding position on a
drop-bar bike.

When assuming my normal riding posture, and putting similar weight on
both palms, I was seeing just under 30 pounds (13.5kg) of weight being
borne by my left arm.  Double that to 60 pounds (for both hands), and
consider that I weigh just over 150, and I think it's easy to see that
you DO carry a lot of the weight of your torso via your arms.

As for legs supporting weight - that's also quite true, but much more
so for those who ride faster.  Essentially, the harder you push on the
pedals, the more you unweight your saddle.  Those who ride at much
more pedestrian paces don't notice the benefit from pushing on the
pedals as much (obviously).

It's been my experience that almost anyone who is "in pain" on an
upright bike has a bike that simply doesn't fit very well, or is
trying to surpass their physical ability by riding too far.

Whereas recumbent riders just have to stop riding stand up and walk
around for a while to get some feeling back into their butts.  I hear
proportionately as many comfort complaints from recumbentists as from
bicyclists.  It's not any different than sitting in the same position
for an extended position- it becomes uncomfortable.

I can't do that experiment, as I have no more "normal" bicycles. The
closest I can come is a RANS Fusion (
http://www.ransbikes.com/Fusion06.htm ), and when on the bike my spine
is nearly vertical,,, so there's almost no hand pressure at all.

If you stood on the pedals the entire time you wouldn't get any saddle
pain either--but then what's the point of the seat? If it's not for
sitting on, why do all the seat companies bother with even putting
padding or spring suspension on them? It does not bear logical extension
that the LESS weight there is resting upon the saddle, the MORE picky
people would be about which saddle they use (-not to mention the padded
shorts--recumbent riders rest all their weight on the seat and they
don't need padded shorts,,, if you're resting less-than-all of your
torso's weight on your saddle, why would you need /more/ padding in the
shorts? ).

No, the only thing you advise here is that it's necessary to trade off
saddle pain for hand numbness--but those are the two most common
problems people have riding upright bikes. Customers at the low end will
not accept either of them--that's what's driving the US market for
"comfort" bikes.

Saddle pain and hand numbness may be a necessary part of the kinds of
bikes that /you/ ride, but it isn't a part of all of them.

---------------

On the other hand--I am starting to think that the mass bicycling use of
the Netherlands is not all it's cracked up to be. This page:
http://ruudvisser.wordpress.com/2006/12/
-notes from a government report that while the use of cycling is
enormous, the average daily distance covered is really rather small,
only about 10.5 miles. It's certainly a lot better than nothing, but
15.5 miles at casual paces over flat terrain really isn't all that much
exercise. My bet here is that a lot of these people rarely ride more
than twice the daily average distance, and so they aren't concerned
about absolute comfort.

Dear Mark,

Fogelesque?

Please, such tests are best left to professionals!

Where are your weights, your workbench, your rope, your 2x4, your
camera?

Where are your embarrassing mishaps?

First, I put an ancient but accurate bathroom scale on a counter top
and leaned on it.

Then I tried to insert some handlebars into the experiment, but the
drops hit the countertop, so I scooted the scale over to the corner of
the counter and got things to work that way.

Pleased with my success, I tried to improve things by moving the scale
to the corner of a handy metal railing around the steps leading down
to Fogel Labs.

Same result, except that I knocked the scale off the railing onto the
carpet, and the scale began to read 200 lbs with nothing on it.

A tap with a hammer fixed the scale, putting the housing back where
it's supposed to be.

Now for a better setup and a picture!

I couldn't think of any excuse for a rope, so I settled for a long 2x4
on my workbench, with one end of the 2x4 sticking out into thin air.

To hold the 2x4 down, I put 20 pounds of weights on the far end. (I
could have roped it down, but using the weights was quicker.)

Then I put the scale out on the end of the 2x4, laid the handlebars
across it, and leaned on them. Perfect!

Satisfied that my setup was as elegant as the Michelson-Morley
experiment (they settled for tons of mercury instead of reliable
2x4's), I rigged my camera with a timer delay (after wasting only ten
minutes looking for the manual) and took this picture:

http://i10.tinypic.com/35lay47.jpg

As you can see, a standard 195-lb Fogel leaning comfortably on the
drops produces only about 35 pounds of pressure on the handlebars.

Your much larger 60-lb estimated result for a mere 150-lb Hickey may
be due to different posture, scales, or setup.

You were on an actual bike, but had only one hand sorta-kinda in place
on top of a scale.

I was beautifully balanced on both drops, but with no bicycle in
sight.

Of course, outright fraud must always be considered--look at the title
of this thread!

Cheers,

Carl Fogel
