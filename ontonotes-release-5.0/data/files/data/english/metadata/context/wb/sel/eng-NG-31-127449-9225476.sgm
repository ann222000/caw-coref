Where poppies blow, or grow.  (Apparently it is still being disputed
which word is original/ correct.)

The other day I started reading a P.D. James novel, &quot;Murder Room.&quot; In
this book, Dagliesh (the detective charged with solving the murder)
visits a museum dedicated to the &quot;interwar years [of] 1919-1939.&quot;  The
museum has some manuscripts, newspapers and paintings from that era;
and at one point Dagliesh comes under the spell of a Paul Nash print
of Passchendaele.  The painting is described as depicting the
&quot;horrors, the futility and the pain, fixed in the bodies of those
unknown, ungainly dead.&quot;

[Side note:  there is a short but informative bio of Paul Nash here:]
http://tinyurl.com/33f7px

After he leaves, Dagliesh reflects on &quot;Those inter-war years in which
England, her memory seared by the horrors of Flanders and a generation
lost, had stumbled through near dishounour to confront and overcome a
greater danger, had been two decades of extraordinary social change
and diversity.

I believe I have parsed everything in the sentence except the phrase
&quot;stumbled through near dishounour.&quot;   Is James referring to
Chamberlain's failed policy of appeasement?

It may still be disputed, but apparently only because the &quot;grow&quot;ers
are unaware that their position has been refuted. Here is an image
of a signed, handwritten copy submitted to Punch magazine in 1915:

&lt; http://67.19.222.106/business/graphics/mccrae.jpg &gt;

So the word was originally &quot;blow&quot; (probably meaning &quot;bloom&quot;
in this case, which heads off one objection from the &quot;grow&quot; crowd,
viz. that the image of blowing poppies is not as evocative as the
still field depicted by the word &quot;grow.&quot; However, this does not
address two other objections: 1) the last line (or two) says &quot;We
shall not sleep though poppies grow in Flanders Fields&quot; so, for
reasons of concinnity, the first one should use &quot;grow&quot; as well, and
2) this parenthetical comment is ridiculously long. Well, as far as
the first objection, poetically it makes as much sense to vary the
word used as to keep it the same. And as far as the second, get your
own parenthetical comment) but eventually became &quot;grow&quot; in popular
memory.

The poem appears on the back of the Canadian $10 note (Now, worth
$10.15!) with the word &quot;blow&quot;. Since most people remembered the word
as &quot;grow,&quot; a rumor arose that the $10 note would soon be recalled.
(Yeah. Like people wouldn't just hang onto one as a collector's item
and sell it on eBay someday.) In fact, the Bank of Canada carefully
checked the wording and obtained a handwritten copy of McCrae's poem to
make sure they had it right.

Snopes recounts the legend in more detail here:

http://www.snopes.com/business/money/flanders.asp

I had thought there was also some controversy about whether the word
&quot;condemn&quot; or &quot;contemn&quot; was original. But I see that neither word was
used.... [rummages around] Ah. I was thinking of a different World
War I poem--&quot;Ode of Remembrance&quot; from Laurence Binyon's &quot;For the
Fallen.&quot;

She *is* probably referring to the near-dishonor of the failed
appeasment policy, with the particular reference to the statement made
by Churchill, “Britain and France had to choose between war and
dishonor.  They chose dishonor. They will have war.”

READING COMPREHENSION
by Opus T. Penguin

Reading comprehension is good. Reading comprehension is something we
should right essays about. I think that if we have reading we should
also have comprehension because what is the point of reading without
comprehension? Also if you have comprehension but do not have reading
then what exactly is the comprehension about?

As proof that we should have reading comprehension everybody knows
that dead people do not have any reading comprehension so maby if we
don't have reading comprehension we will end up like them. Or worse
then that, maby we will end up stupid and ugly and fat and mean like
my teacher who made me stay in from recess and right this stoopid
essay on reading comprehension. She isn't even going to read the
essay beyond maybe the first paragraph.

Oh, no, she'll just glance at this thing and pat me on the head and
say &quot;Don't do it again.&quot; Like I'm the one who's such a butthole. She
comments on the size of my nose, which I don't think she's aloud to
do and I could probably win a lawsuit against the school and get her
fire. But if I write a note to Binkley about how her butt is bigger
then some countries and you can't take a bus from one side to the
other without getting a transfer pass than suddenly I'm washing the
marker board for a month and writing &quot;It is not nice to make fun of
other people's physical characteristics&quot; a thousand times.

What really frosts me is when I give a genuine, interesting answer to
one of her questions. But oh no, its not the question she asked.
Yeah, that's really what this is about. I don't think so. I think the
thing is that she claimed there was still debate going on and I
pointed out that only losers and morons are still debating the
subject because the write answer is known and then Ms. Barbara looks
really stoopid in frunt of the hole class. Ha ha. To bad.

Anyway, I said she wouldn't read more then the first paragraph, but
that's probly not true. She'll probly read the last one as well, so
I'd better stop talking about this and get back to the incredibly
lame assignment that I have to do when I could be outside playing
Kick the Can. I'd like to play Kick the Can with Ms. Barbara's can.
But that's not much of a game. How could you miss?

In conclusion, I believe that if we do not have reading comprehension
than it will be impossible for the world to function. Governments and
economies would collapse and no one would be able to get anything
done. So it is very very very important to pay attention and
understand what the question is before you answer it.

Can I go play now?

I'd bet the confusion arose because both words are used in the poem.
According to the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations (who take some trouble to
get it right and I quote here from the 5th edition so people had lotsa
chances to change it if it was wrong) the first line is:

In Flanders fields the poppies blow

and the penultimate line is

We shall not sleep, though poppies grow

I think if we're talking about the nation with some historical

permanently mired in dishonour, but Britain more than made up for the
misstep with its conduct in WWII. For the nation, I think &quot;near
dishonour&quot; fits fairly well.

I haven't closely studied the history of the period. Does anyone know if
there was any sense at the time of, &quot;We have to buy some time so we can
make military preparations and get our allies lined up, because if we go

I don't have any evidence to the contrary. I am wondering, though,
whether the only way to prove that appeasement was wrong was to
implement it and observe the results. If they hadn't implemented it,
perhaps we'd be arguing forever about whether the horrors that ensued
could have been avoided. When they did implement it, it created a
milepost that told everyone else, with certainty, that the Nazis could
not be trusted to honour their agreements.

For that reason, I'm inclined to go somewhat easy on Chamberlain and the
gang. It's not like they were Nazi sympathizers, trying to pave the way
for the Third Reich. They were trying to find a way to avert what was
coming, and they got it wrong.

No. The 'appeasement' was seen a statesman-like way to avert war by some and
as a monumental piece of head-burying in the sand by others. But 'speak
softly and carry a big stick' wasn't invoked as it should have been and we
were woefully lacking in war materiel and trained personnel when the crunch
came. Part of the lack of preparedness was a feeling we should not give
Hitler any reason to think we were planning on a war.

Yes, that's what Snopes says it is.  Yes, it's a signed, handwritten copy.

But if it was the copy *originally submitted to Punch*, why would it be
annotated in the bottom corner with the title of the magazine and the
date of the publication?

Obviously this is a copy that McCrae wrote out for someone later.

Now check out the McCrae House museum web site.

The Snopes page refers to &quot;the copy of the poem on the web site of the
McCrae House museum&quot; &lt; http://www.museum.guelph.on.ca/mccraeflanders.htm &gt;,
but that link is dead.  I presume it is the page now found at

indeed quote only the &quot;blow&quot; version.

But now follow the &quot;back&quot; link at the bottom and then go down again to
the McCrae House home page at &lt; http://guelpharts.ca/mccraehouse/ &gt;.

And *there* you get the straight dope.  &quot;Grow&quot; was the version originally
*written*; &quot;blow&quot; was the version originally *published*, after Punch's
editor suggested making the change.  McCrae accepted it at the time but
afterwards went back and forth (he wasn't killed until 3 years later),
And thus the poem has been published both ways, and, yes, many of us

Perhaps. The smoking gun would be a different autograph by McCrae

&gt;&gt; No. *There* we get a different theory. At this point I don't feel

They may have honestly believed it would work, or talked themselves into
it. And by trying it, they proved -- whether they intended to or not --
that it doesn't work in that situation.

It's hard to extrapolate that into a general rule, however. Everyone can
agree in the abstract that sometimes you have to fight the bad guys, but
ahead of the event, it can be very difficult to pick between diplomacy
and brute force, or a combination of the two.

that you spelled it &quot;Dagliesh&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Is no-one going to mention the sizeable minority - especially among

Why me? No fair! It was, after all, an important element of the whole
so-called appeasement tendency, and would seem to fit P.D. James' &quot;stumbled

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Now, what about the sizeable minority who *still* approve of Hitler?
">

Well... in the sense that the dead can't fuck things up the way living
leaders can, I kind of approve of Hitler; IMO his corpse might make a better
leader of the UK than any of the last few Prime Ministers.

But that aside, today's sizeable Hitler-supporting minority is a lot less
sizeable than it was in the 30s (and doesn't, AFAIK, include the heir to the
throne).

If, on the other hand, we're talking about fascists in general rather than
Nazis in particular, their numbers - and their preponderance amongst the new
ruling classes - has probably now returned to early 30s levels.

So now Ms. Barbara is showing my essays to everyone and letting them

&gt; &gt; On review, I must disagree.  Dalgliesh is the correct spelling, at
&gt; &gt; least in the U.S. version.  I can scan copies if you need further

&gt; So you both spelled it wrong. If you go back and check, you'll note

Maybe that will teach me not to be so smug.
