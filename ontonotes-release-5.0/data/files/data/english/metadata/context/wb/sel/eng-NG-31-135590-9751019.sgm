I have started looking into scripts for screen size detect with the
intention of using them to pick from a number of CSS style sheets tailored
to the size.

Is there a good reason why this is not so commonly done? IE am I wasting my
time?

screen size != window size != window display size.

Also FF [fery futile].

Bad idea.  I once found a website I needed to get information from which
appeared totally blank.  Eventually looked at the source, and found that
the designer had selected (Javascript) different layouts and image sizes
for a range of different viewport sizes, and none matched my 1920x1620
screen.  Hence, a blank page.

Instead, google for &quot;fluid css layout&quot;.

Fluid CSS layout isn't a tool I would ditch, the reason I am looking to use
viewport detect for CSS in this circumstance is solely to select the
background image to be able to span the width of the screen without repeats
or borders when maximised, not affect content layout. Whether they have the
window maximised is not an issue here.

Could you not put a part in the script that says; if none of these
viewports, then = 'other style sheet'

I'm no scripter yet.

You can solve this issue with CSS alone... Google the
&quot;background-repeat&quot; CSS property.

Yes, you are wasting your time. Disable scripting and let us all know

If you attempt to script it, you are better off with a different
approach. Instead of a particular size, look for a particular range of
sizes. If the window is less than 800 pixels, give them an 800 pixel
background image. If the window is between say 800 and 1200 then give
them 1200. If the window is between 1200-1600, then give them 1600. If
larger than that, give them larger or let the 1600 stretch.

Then, size the window, get the page, and resize it. Nasty nasty affair
there.

Choose a background image that is tile-friendly, let it repeat, and be
done with it.

Well I've found codes on forums I was not aware of for;

background-repeat:stretch

W3c give background-size examples for body and div but I can't get anything

Anybody got a proven CSS method?

Just set your BG image to a width of 100% in your CSS. That should
work.

I'll rephrase; A non-script second best. I'm picky like that.

Mind you the second best- stretchy CSS still hasn't come out of the shadows
so non-script 3rd best it is; lost sides on small screens and borders on
large.

http://www.css3.info/preview/background-size/

It's CSS3. That page says it's currently supported by Opera 9.3, Safari
and Konqueror. (at the time it was written - there might be more now)

That's the general problem with many CSS3 features - they aren't
supported by all browsers yet.

First considered for selecting a 2nd style sheet with appropriately sized
background image based on viewport detect.
This method rather than CSS stretch to avoid rubbery pixelated jpeg
stretching by the browser as it will be a sharp focused photo.

Principle; Entire picture does not have to show on a shrunk window, just be
able to fill it when maximised, and prime central content visible when
window is at a 'typical' 75%.

After the above concept I just wondered briefly whether viewport detect -
meets - CSS was something done elsewhere.

There is one value which is too variable: that is the maximized

may spend the rest of your life by making pixel-exact pictures for
each possible situation :-) I would suggest to go for a small(?)
compromise by making right and bottom sides of your background
smoothly fading to some color. Based on the sample at http://www.websitefoundry.co.uk/
that could be some variation of orange. By setting the background-
color to the same color you will avoid white bars on screen in any
given case. So CSS could be:

&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
body {
/* Default image for the most expected situation.
What is &quot;most expected&quot; is of course up to you
to decide. The image is faded from the right
and from the bottom to the bgcolor:
*/
background-image: url(1024x740.jpg);
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: left top;
background-attachment: fixed; /* or not */
background-color: orange; /* or whatever else */

Now we have something even if JS is disabled. If it is not then you

var bgrImages = {
'1024' : '1024x740.jpg',
'1100' : 'X1xY1.jpg',
'1500' : 'X2xY2.jpg'

That is one perverse block of code you have there. Doesn't even come

window.screen and/or window.screen.availWidth have to do with the

feature testing for .style and .style.backgroundImage?

No it does not. It reports the physical width of a (possibly one of many)
screen minus the width of a possible vertical windows task bar (for windows
operating systems, that is). Similar for availHeight (with a possible
horizontal widows task bar). They most certainly do *not* take the browsers
border, menus and toolbars into account. This is why they are properties of
the screen object (the physical screen), rather than a mythical &quot;canvas&quot;

No, they don't. Let me give you the dimensions that they report to me:

window.screen.availHeight - 1022
window.screen.availWidth -  3260

Now, if I click the maximize button on IE, what dimensions are the
canvas area of my browser?

Hint #1: Width is nowhere near 3260 pixels wide.
Hint #2: Height is nowhere near 1022.
Hint #3: I have dual monitors.

How about doing some testing. Open a browser, maximise it, and then point it
to a page that alerts window.screen.availHeight and
window.screen.availWidth. Publish the resultant numbers here. Also publish
the size of your screen in pixels.

I don't have to read any &quot;producer's documentation&quot; whatever that is. I
simply note what the browser says, and it is *not* what you say.

Yes, you are right. I was too long on chromes I guess. Sorry to OP,
sorry to you for an excited style of the last posting, sorry to FAQ
maintainer. So the code at http://www.jibbering.com/faq/#FAQ4_9 is
useful if one needs to find out the current &quot;canvas&quot; dimensions.

Does it mean that there is no way to find the _maximum possible_
canvas dimensions for the current user?

The problem is:
User X loads your page with his browser taking only part of the
monitor. What will be the entire available canvas if the user maximize
the browser window?
AFAICT current JavaScript tools do not provide a solution for that.

As an esoteric mind game: a user with dual monitors carefully
stretching the window to the full extend from left to right instead of
just using &quot;Maximize&quot; option, so the browser takes both screens
instead of one. What would be that value in width and height? I don't
really care of such case from any practical point of view, but someone
has an insomnia... :-)

So I still would attribute your problem to
comp.infosystems. www.authoring.stylesheets rather than to clj

Maybe you may make a 400x600 (600x800, ...) central image with borders
having some repetitive pattern. Then you could use an image with such
pattern as background-image for body, and the image itself as
background-image for div aligned on the page vertically and
horizontally.

&quot;Convoluted code&quot;? I agree that the IE4 code could be removed. In fact,
the NN4 code could probably be removed as most versions of IE/NN that
fall into those categories that are used on the web support the &quot;in
modern browsers&quot; category with a few exceptions. Even as &quot;convoluted&quot; as
you call it, the code in the FAQ is over-simplified as it doesn't even
work - correctly - in some &quot;modern browsers&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Finding the canvas size is actually pretty simple in most scenarios if
&gt;&gt;&gt; you care to read section 4.9 of the group FAQ.

&gt;&gt;  The FAQ of this newsgroup has AFAICS no section 4.9.

&gt;Then you need to learn to read plain English and how to find an FAQ.

No; but you need to pay more attention to the exact meaning, if any, of
&quot;this&quot; in the current context, and to where your article is actually
going.

Jim : Have you a URL for the most recent unwa FAQ?

&gt; I have started looking into scripts for screen size detect with the
&gt; intention of using them to pick from a number of CSS style sheets tailored
&gt; to the size.

&gt; Is there a good reason why this is not so commonly done? IE am I wasting my
&gt; time?

I see further down this thread you have quite a specific thing you'd
like to do... but I'm going to ignore that!

Web developers are seldom as smart as they think they are.  Whenever
they try to do something clever that takes into account all variables,
they mess things up because there's some variable (if not more) that
they haven't thought of.

Potential problems with coding based on &quot;size&quot; include:
1.  the user might not have their browser maximised
2.  you don't know how much chrome the browser is using
3.  you don't know if the user is currently displaying optional
components such as Firefox's sidebar
4.  if the user is currently displaying optional components such as
Firefox's sidebar, you don't know how wide they've decided to have it
display
5.  you don't know what text size the user has selected as their
default
6.  you don't know if the user will change the size of their browser's
window *while visiting your site*
7.  if the user is currently displaying optional components such as
Firefox's sidebar, you don't know if they're going to change its width
*while visiting your site*
8.  you don't know if the user has JavaScript enabled
9.  scrollbars are different widths in different browsers on the same
system
10.  some users will have more than one screen
11.  opening pages in the background can change the height available
for your site in Firefox because another row is needed for the extra
tabs
12.  different platforms will affect the exact measurements of most of
the above items

I'm sure there are quite a few more that I've not thought of!
Unfortunately, you'd have to think of them all as well...
