Some time ago I seem to remember someone in this group asking about a
way of removing scorch marks from linen.  In the back of my wife's
favourite cookery book (published in 1927 by the Yorkshire Federation of
Women's Institutes) are some handy, non-cookery hints. Some hints are
still relevant today, others less so...
Scorch marks may be removed from linen by rubbing with a freshly cut
onion and afterwards soaking in cold water.
If a handful of common salt is added to rinsing water during frosty
weather, clothes hung in the garden will be kept from freezing until
they are dry.
One teaspoonful of methylated spirits added to rinsing water for
table cloths and other starched things does away with starch.
White paper should not be used for wrapping around articles that are
to be put away for the chloride of lime in it will destroy the colour of
the fabric. Yellow or blue paper is by far the best for that purpose.
Try baiting the mousetrap with a little chocolate nougat when the
mice ignore the usual bait. Or paint around mouse holes with oil of
peppermint and the mice will soon leave the place as they dislike it
intensely.
Rub the bars of the firegrate with a cut onion before using blacklead
and they will keep black much longer.
When packing your case for an holiday cut several pieces of cardboard
slightly smaller than the case; then fold each dress carefully, wrap in
tissue paper and tie on the cardboard. They can be lifted out easily and
are always straight.

Not so in our house.

Or these 'Merikan mice are bordering on retarded...

We have *12* cats and we *still* get mice!  Occasionally I will find one (or
a part of one - ick) in the middle of the living room floor.  One had been
seriously licked by the dog (and was getting the stare-of-death from 7
cats), but still alive.  That one (drenched in doggie-drool) was taken
outside, and apparently recovered!  I kept my eye on it for a while, and
after about an hour, it came out of it's drool-induced &quot;coma&quot; and toddled
off.  It was summer, so the drool dried fairly quickly!

I don't know whether Surrey is any good at actually catching mice as
we've not seen her in mouse-catching action. However, if any stray
beetle, spider or other creepy-crawlie is foolish enough to wander into
the house and make any slight movement whilst in Surrey's field of
vision then Surrey leaps into action. She chases and corners the poor
creature before playing with it for ages, often allowing it to escape
across the floor before casually strolling over and recapturing it,
until we cannot watch any more and have to put the creature out of its
misery. Surrey is also extremely fast on her feet as we've noticed when
she plays with one of the table tennis balls that someone bought her for
Christmas -  yes, Surrey is a very, very pampered pet!

We have at least a dozen outdoor cats, mostly calico - they just
appeared on the porch one day 3 years ago so we've taken to feeding
them.  Our poor little indoor kitty is beside herself as she runs from
window to window watching them.

Anyway, we used to have a dreadful vole problem.  The yard was
littered with mounds of earth and it was dangerous to go skipping out
in the lawn at night.  Leg breakers, those holes were.  Then one day
the cat army showed up.

Well, on to my point now.  I read that a well fed cat is a better
mouser than a hungry one because the hungry one will only hunt till it
is full, whereas the well fed cat will hunt for fun, so there is no
limit to their conquests.  So, we figure a big bag of catfood monthly
is a fair price for the mousing and vole removal service they
perform.  Also, no squirrels.  They even eat a fair share of
grasshoppers!

And some cats (she says, glaring at one of them) are very good
mouse-catchers, who will then let the mouse go so they can have the fun

And when GrandMeow and GrandPurr bought said cat a furry mousie toy for

I remember hearing a story on NPR about how mice and rats become
&quot;paralyzed&quot; in the presence of a cat. It's a brilliant story of
symbiosis in nature:

My sister's cat, the late great Mork, brought in a live snake for our Mom
one day. Mom is afraid of snakes. And other time, he brought in a live blue
jay and deposited at the feet of a former BF of mine.
And we swore that cat brought the live mice/voles/moles just for the

Dear Aunt Jenn,

You haven't been around me, have you?  I speak quite well and
constantly.  I love to talk on the phone.  And if people don't
understand, I have other ways of getting my point across ... I hung up
on Uncle Brian three times the other day because he went to Fisherman's
Wharf and didn't bring me any fish.  That'll teach him!

Love, Miss Kitty

Ours definitely has language skills - he may get a bit confused when we send
him for a specifically named object, and bring something similar - but if we
repeat it - he'll find the write thing.  And he whines really, really well.
Plus, he actually gives &quot;huggies&quot; - stands up on his hind legs and puts his
front legs on the shoulders, leans in, and whuffles.  Every so often when
we've left him alone all day, and come home, he'll be mooning around, and
come up, smiling, then stand up and put the paws on you - if you ask &quot;want a
hug?&quot; or &quot;huggies&quot; he goes for it.  Then he's happy.

It's the ear snuffling to check scent that has us a bit intriqued.

&gt;&gt; They don't have to speak.  My dog can get nearly anything he wants by
&gt;&gt; just
&gt;&gt; looking at me beseechingly and pointing in the right direction.  Or, if
&gt;&gt; it's
&gt;&gt; important enough and I'm ignoring the look, a little lick on the cheek
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; I'm toast.

&gt; Ours definitely has language skills - he may get a bit confused when we
&gt; send
&gt; him for a specifically named object, and bring something similar - but if
&gt; we
&gt; repeat it - he'll find the write thing.  And he whines really, really
&gt; well.

Puff give hugs too.  Of course, being about 10&quot; at the shoulder, he can't
possibly reach shoulders if a person is  standing, but he climbs up on a lap
and then does the hugs and kisses bit.

I've even seen him move his mouth as if he wants to say a word, especially
when he's really anxious to make me go somewhere or do something.  I really
believe that if they had the right kind of vocal cords animals would
definitely be able to speak.  I read somewhere that most adult dogs have the
vocabulary of a three year old.

Too cute.  I totally agree with you.  Puckster definitely makes some noises
that are not &quot;dog&quot; typical language - more guttural.  You can seem him
working on this, and making these non-bark,non-whine or whimper noises with
some variation - and looking at us &quot;Don't you understand?&quot; . No doubt all
the different doggie sounds have meanings - certainly we can tell the &quot;let
me out&quot; from &quot;want to play&quot; from &quot;who's there&quot; and &quot;YIPPEE - you're home&quot;
sounds.  Puckster seems to have a better vocab than some of my other dogs -
it's at least close to 200 words and gestures.  3 year old is likely about
right.  Who knows.

I think we as a whole often underestimate animals - or non-lovers of animals
can often tend to discount their communication &amp; emotional capacity.  I know
that the horses in the stable certainly communicated with each other, and
had different sounds and gestures for their people.  Watching the dogs and
horses &quot;talking&quot; - that was interesting.
