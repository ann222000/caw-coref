B&quot;H. When Cynicism Replaces Innocence

By Yosef Y. Jacobson

A Tale of Two Birds

As the flood waters recede, Noah opens the window of the ark and sends out the
raven, which &quot;kept going and returning until the waters dried from upon the
earth (1).&quot; It would seem as if the raven did its job admirably, and the story
should have ended right there. Instead, the text describes a drawn-out process
in which Noah sends out a dove three times to determine whether the waters had
subsided from the face of the ground.

The first time, the dove returns to the ark, as it could not find a place to
rest, because the earth is still engulfed in water. The second time the dove
returns with a plucked olive leaf, indicating that the water has receded
significantly. Seven days later, Noah sends the dove a third time. This time, it
does not return any more. At last, the dove encountered a space to dwell. The
earth was once again habitable.

Why the need to send two birds, a raven and a dove? And why did he first send
out the raven and only afterward the dove?

The raven has a long standing negative reputation. Because of its black plumage,
croaking call, and diet of carrion, the raven has long been considered an unkind
bird. Psalm (ch. 147) describes G-d's mercy in feeding all creatures, even &quot;the
raven's children who call out.&quot; Why are the raven's children singled out?
Because ravens do not care for their young as do other birds (2), which is one
of the reasons that the raven is singled out as a non kosher bird (3).

Modern Western culture has continued this trend. The famous Edgar Allan Poe poem
portrays the raven as a grim, spectral presence. One particular flock of ravens
has attained notoriety by taking up residence at the Tower of London, site of
many gruesome beheadings and royal murders. To this day, the Beefeater guards
warn visitors from getting too close, lest the ravens supplement their usual
diet of carrion with a tourist's finger or toe.

The dove, on the other extreme, is a symbol of tenderness, loyalty and kindness.
The image of the dove bearing an olive branch - originating in this week's Torah
portion (4) - resonates in the communal consciousness, even if the peace that it
represents seems to flee ever further. The Song of Songs compares time and time
again the beautiful bride to the dove. The rabbis praised the dove for its
extraordinary singular loyalty to its mate, unique in the animal kingdom (5).
Not only is the dove a kosher bird, but it is the one chosen by the Torah to be
offered in the Holy Temple as a sacred, divine offering, testifying to its
sublime potential.

In Kabbalistic and Chassidic terminology, the raven represents the attribute of
gevurah -- aggression, strength and sternness. The dove, in contrast, represents
the quality of chesed - kindness, tenderness and empathy (6).

Based on this contrast between the raven and the dove, we can appreciate the
deeper rhythms behind the Noah story.

Initially, Noah felt that the proper approach in a post-flood universe must be
that of the raven. It must be tough, rough and unkindly. After all, humanity
deteriorated because it was spoiled rotten and it thus grew arrogant and
depraved (7). Humanity received too much love, too much generosity, and this
allowed people to lose their priorities and to forfeit their moral compass. Now,
Noah assumed, we must start all over again, with the raven showing the way. The
&quot;new world order&quot; must be based on sternness, strength and discipline.
Aggression and strict judgment must prevail if we want to ensure that
civilization does not revert again to chaos.

This approach of Noah holds true in many of our own lives as well. People who
have experienced a &quot;flood,&quot; in one form or another, people who have felt the
turmoil and pain of life, often feel that the only way to build a new life for
themselves is by adopting the perspective and the attitude of the raven. They
develop a rough shell, a dense crust, an aggressive disposition. They become
tough, strong, and stern. Sometimes they become cynical and suspicious and their
hearts shut down. They devour, as they are scared to embrace.

Can we blame them? No. They are afraid to be abused again. They can't endure the
pain twice.

But soon Noah discovered that with a raven you can't rebuild a world. The raven
is good to remain in the peripheral; the raven &quot;kept going and returning until
the waters dried from upon the earth.&quot; The raven is important to give borders to
love, and created limits for vulnerability. The raven will hover over the new
world, protecting it from a kindness and a love that could turn destructive. But
who must to lead the way in settling the new world and rebuilding a shattered
civilization? Only the dove. The primary driving force in life must be love,
loyalty and compassion.

Each of us has disappointments on life. Some of them are caused by other people;
others are caused by G-d. Some people feel that they have been let down by those
who were supposed to care for them most. We can understand if they have
developed a &quot;raven&quot; attitude in order to protect themselves in the future; even
Noah himself did just that. Yet the human soul is capable of much more: of not
allowing the pain of life to deprive it from its greatest power - its ability to
love.

The Modern Flood

During the past six decades the Jewish people have been attempting to recover
from a flood that destroyed a third of our nation. One and a half million
children were sent to the gas chambers, but nobody uttered more than a pips.

Understandably, Jewish hearts were swelling with bitterness, mistrust and
profound pain. They could have easily turned into &quot;ravens,&quot; projecting hatred
and cynicism unto their children and grandchildren. But learning from Noah's
example, they replaced the raven with the dove. The survivors, for the most
part, built families and showered their children with love, confidence, and
hope. Sure, many children of survivors suffered (and suffer till today) from the
paralyzing silence that pervaded their homes. But we can all testify that most
of our parents and grandparents did they best they can to protect and nurture
their loved ones and give them an opportunity to celebrate life. Will we, the
recipients of that courageous choice, ever be able to thank them adequately?

Only if we, the second, third and fourth generations, continue being guided by
the dove, giving love, confidence and hope to the people around us (8).
