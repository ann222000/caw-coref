I'm planning to ride to either Las Vegas or Topaz Lake, this coming Friday.

I have comped reservations in Vegas, but I'm leaning towards Gardnerville
and the great roads of the High Sierras and Hope Valley.

I do not plan on riding through the desert in the heat of the day. If I go
to Vegas, I plan to ride at night. If I go to Topaz, I plan to go early in
the morning, from Los Angeles.

Friday to Monday, probably.

Anyone care to join me?

Benton (junction of 6 and 120) and camping at the hot springs with a large
group of &quot;friends of Bill&quot; headed east. $10 per head to camp, bring your own

It beats me, and it's sorta in my neighborhood. Nothing there but a small
casino and hotel, probably better odds of winning in a major casino but i'm
no gambler.
I think Thumper just likes riding up 395 'cause there arent many turns to
crash his Harleys on.

And I fantasize about riding the Appalachians and touring Kentucky and
Tennesee.

I live right where the Sierra Nevada foothills begin. On a clear day, I can
see the front range, but those clear days only happen when the mountain roads
are
closed due to snow.

Going to Sequoia or Yosemite is a once a year thing for me, when I think,
&quot;Gosh, the parks are so close, I have the free pass and I really should go
over there and mingle with the mob of tourists.&quot;

A century ago, John Muir used to *walk* from San Francisco to Yosemite valley.

His camping gear was a frying pan, a coffee pot, a sack of flour and a long
overcoat that he slept in.

As he crossed Pacheco pass he could look across the San Joaquin Valley and
see the snow capped peaks of the Sierras shining in the distance.

Now, with all the smog from diesel trucks and cars and the methane coming out
of dairy cow's asses, the Sierras cannot be seen at all. San Joaquin Valley
air is
red from the dust and the nitrous oxides, and it's worse than the air in Los
Angeles.

Last time I went up to Sequoia NP, which is about 50 miles away, I stopped at
a panoramic vista where the interpretive sign said I would have been able to
see the Coast Ranges 150 miles away if it wasn't for the smog.

The sign went on to say that the smog was killing the giant sequoia trees
that
John Muir fought to save...

But, people want the Wal*Mart knick knacks that the trucks haul from San
Pedro to Fresno, and, if they have to choose between the natural beauty of
California and a cheap pair of athletic shoes, you know what they are going
to choose.

&quot;grass is always greener&quot; syndrome is something we all find

Tons and tons of fun, but on an intellectual yet existential level.

Muir must have thought, &quot;Here am I, unafraid, in a world that God made for me
and for those who dare to explore its wonders.&quot;

In the dumbed down America of today, many people cannot appreciate the
the faith, genius, insatiable curiosity, and above all, *tenacity* of the
famous Scottish immigrants like the Muirs.

Everybody knows about the legendary Scottish tenacity. Once they have
something in their hand (or in their mind) they never let it go.

When I go to Yosemite valley and see the tourists' kids playing with a frisby
in the parking lot and see families who never attempt to hike the most easily
accessible trails, I realize that America has bred a new generation of idiots.

I listen to city kids yelling at each other just to hear the echo of their
own voice.
They have lived all their lives in such noise pollution that they have never
experienced the silence of a forest.

The city folk cannot name a song bird, they cannot tell granite from
sandstone, an oak tree from a pine, but they know the obscenities of all the
rappers and the batting statistics of their favorite baseball player.

A city person cannot stand to be isolated and alone with his own thoughts,
because he has no reference to his wilderness surroundings. He must run back
to the city, in fear of confronting his own self.

John Muir walked all over the Sierras, alone and confident in his own self
and his ability to survive.

There were a couple of times that Muir made mistakes, like the time he
climbed the wrong peak, thinking he was on Mt. Whitney, and almost froze to
death, and the time that he slid down the slick rock into a ravine in
Yosemite where he might have died, except he was able to scramble out.

Besides exploring Yosemite Valley and convincing Congress to save the valley
and preserve the giant sequoia trees from being logged for timber, Muir also
visited Alaska and saw the Muir Glacier and lobbied for protection of the
Alaskan wilderness.

Right at the Cal/Nevada State line on Hwy. 395. inutes away from the most
beautiful High Sierra passes and roads. Near the Carson Valley, which is
right below Lake Tahoe.

395 is a beautiful sweeping road, with spectacular vistas (once you get past

Not much, it's a small casino/hotel/gas station on 395.  It is close to
Monitor, Ebbetts, Sonora passes.  A large portion of the casino burned
down a while back; they were still rebuilding it the last time I waso

The local library has &quot;On Desert Trails&quot; in the reference collection, so I
sat there
in the normally locked room by myself and read it.

That's the book where Reuss claimed that he owned stock that was worth

Huh, that's a bummer. The casino website said that it had &quot;minor&quot; fire

&gt; Huh, that's a bummer. The casino website said that it had &quot;minor&quot; fire
&gt; damage and the remodel would be completed in the (last) spring. I guess
&gt; I'm not going to be staying there. (|:(

I just called Topaz Lodge. They say they're fine. All construction is
finished and they're open for business.
The Carson City HOG chapter is having several rides this weekend. After I
visit Stupendous man, I might join them.

Cool. Benton hot springs, campsite 8. I should get there about 4 PM Sat and
leaving Sunday at about 7AM.
Maybe you should ride with us to Colorado.

That sounds great, But, I won't be doing camping on this trip. Also, I have
to be back at the colliery by Tuesday. How long is your trip?

2 weeks and a bit over 2K miles. The funny part is it's the week before
Sturgis, so people always ask if that's the destination. &quot;Hell no, that's
for sheep!&quot;.

Can't you get some teenage Mormon hookers flown in to take the
sting out of your cancelled trip?

I'm still going to Vegas, in my truck, with the V-Rod and a load of stuff,
on the back.
Destination, Las Vegas Harley Davidson.

Perhaps I might find some teenage hookers there?
