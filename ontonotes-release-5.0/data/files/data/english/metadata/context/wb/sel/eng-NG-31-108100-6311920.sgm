I read your "In the Museum" tonight.  Very good tale, I must say. What's
an empanada though?

Thanks, Ben. An empanada is a pastry. Kind of like a turnover or fried
pie. It's crescent-shaped and has a filling. They make them with
fillings like pineapple and cream cheese, but my favorites are pumpkin,
especially the ones sold at Ornela's bakery in Rio Hondo.

What did you think of the rest of the book? I thought some of the
stories and poems were great.

Take some pie dough and roll it out to the size of a tortilla.  Spoon on
some filling; pineapple, cherry, apple, pumpkin (pick one)
fold the dough over to cover the filling and pinch the edges together.
Bake like you would a pie. (takes much shorter time)

As always, the result will be only as good as the ingredients.  :-)

A pumpkin empanada sound good.

I like all 3 stories that I have read (picked at random except for
yours). I did read your poem too and thought that was good but, to be
honest, I'm just not into poems much, if at all. I bought this book to
throw in the RV for rainy nights, so I don't want to spoil it by reading
it all in one sitting..  Thanks for suggesting the book. It's fun
reading type stuff.

Havent tasted one baked, we called them fried

Best made with dried fruit like apple and peach

A lady from OK used to make these at our frequent fish fries at Lake
Corpus.  She used tortillas, pie filling, secured them with toothpicks
and eased them into a deep fryer.  Ummmmnnnn!  Good.

The people on the upper level of the campground always got green with
envy when us "River Rats" had our fish fries.

When you come to visit, we'll take a ride to Rio Hondo and Ornela's
bakery. Great pastries at ridiculous prices. I am partial to the pumpkin
empanadas and the molasses pigs. There are plenty of bakeries around and
HEB has some good Mexican pastries as well, but this little bakery is
tops.  They also make little pineapple pies that a friend of mine swears
are the best he's ever eaten.

Welsh people settled in other places besides the UP. The Welsh miners
on the UP took pasties in their lunch buckets in Michigan just as their
ancestors had done to the mines in Wales.

I don't mean to be contrary but pasties (pastys) are originally
Cornish, whereas Welsh ones are 'oggies'. Because the UP miners were
Welsh and Cornish, there was some confusion and they called them (and

Well, both sets of miners (Cornish and Welsh) called them oggies. The
actual origin of oggie or oggy is a tad cloudy...

"The Oxford English Dictionary acknowledges the Cornish roots of the
word oggy, describing it as probably an alteration of the 18th Century
Cornish "hoggan" pastry. The entry then goes on to explain the word
possibly shares a root with the earlier Welsh word Chwiogen, dating
back to at least 1562, and meaning muffin or simnel-cake."

I guess you could be forgiven for calling either of them pasties or
oggies.

Who cares... let's eat.

&gt;&gt; Havent tasted one baked, we called them fried pies in west Texas,
&gt;&gt; Oklahoma, Louisiana and Mississippi.
&gt;&gt; Best made with dried fruit like apple and peach or Pear. Of course you
&gt;&gt; have to prepare the fruit once it had been dried.

&gt; A lady from OK used to make these at our frequent fish fries at Lake
&gt; Corpus.  She used tortillas, pie filling, secured them with toothpicks
&gt; and eased them into a deep fryer.  Ummmmnnnn!  Good.

&gt; The people on the upper level of the campground always got green with
&gt; envy when us &quot;River Rats&quot; had our fish fries.

The modern method of making these are to use
canned biscuit dough and roll them out flat,
fill, fold and seal the edges. The ones I have
seen were pan fried.

&gt; When you come to visit, we'll take a ride to Rio Hondo and Ornela's

Those gingerbread "pigs" are called "marranitos" (little pigs)

In that case you'll be absolutely astounded to know that fans of the
Welsh football (soccer) and rugby teams chant "Oggy, Oggy, Oggy... Oi
Oi Oi!" at their matches. It means, as you'd surmise, "pasty, pasty,
pasty... Oi Oi Oi!".

Nobody really knows why they do this... maybe they're hungry?

What does the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have to do with

Mom wasn't a yooper.  She is of Scottish/Irish heritage and was born in

you're correct. i've always thought they were Cornish pasties,
originally designed for a nutricious lunch for the miners in Cornwall,
England and then for the miners of the UP.  the Keweenaw Peninsula in
the western Upper Peninsula was once the most productive copper mining
area of the world.
