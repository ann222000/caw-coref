Continuous Samples for Sample Size?

I have some values I want to average, but some values are by nature
more influential for the property I am trying to measure. I decided to
weight these values by the parameter (length) which is directly
proportional to their influence. The weighting method is somewhat
complex. Instead having to explain what the formula I used is and why
I used it, it would be easier to weight the actual values by
multiplying each one by their respective length. This is akin to
increasing their sample size. For example, if one sample = 0.75 and it
has a length = 10, it would be easier to say that I counted this 0.75
value 10 times in the average, instead of using the value of 7.5,
which I then have to normalize and is harder to explain as a value.
The problem is that length is a continuous measure (ex. I have value
of 121.458 etc.). Is it absurd to say that I had 121.458 samples of
that value?

I can be more explicit if it would help.

By the way, I won't need to implement the sample sizes into standard
error or significance testing since I am not comparing the these
weighted values that will be averaged together (I will be comparing
these averages for separate variables).

Thanks,
Hos

It would be easier if you told us what you were measuring - or gave us a
similar practical example. It is much easier dealing with a real problem
than with an abstraction.

My application is really complex so let me give an imaginary example:

Say a town was voting for a mayor, where the worth of each person's
vote was directly proportional to their body weight (ex. 123.367
lbs.). Thus, some people's votes will be more influential to the
outcome. Of course, the way this will be tallied is by summing the
weight's of everyone who voted for one candidate and comparing the sum
of weight's of the people who voted for the other candidate.

But the problem is harder if I don't know the outcome, and I need to
take a sample of the population to make a prediction. In my sample, I
may find that 7 out of 10 people said they will vote for Candidate A,
but I cannot count each of those people as equal samples, because the
worth of their sample is directly proportional to their weight, and it
may be that heavier people tend to vote for the other candidate. In
this case, it seems to me that my sample size is not just the number
of people I sample but is also proportional to their weight, which is
not an integer value. And the question that arises is: Can sample size
be a non-integer value?

I know there are ways to avoid this issue, such as summing instead of
averaging, or averaging weights in my sample independent of the votes,
but doing so I think complicates the description of my statistical
analysis, and I believe it is easier and more direct to explain that
some samples are simply worth more and must be weighted as such, but I
first must prove that having a non-integer sample size is not absurd.

I hope this is clearer!

Thanks,
Kerry

In industry surveys where output or total employment is being measured and
each unit is the company or factory the &quot;vote&quot; or employment or turnover is
not the same for each unit - there is a great spread between companies only
employing one or two people to General Motors or Microsoft.

If you were doing a survey of the views of companies and asked the MD their
views you wouldn't group together General Motors with a mom and pop shop.

Clearly the views of one large company have much more effect than the views
of the owner of a local shop.

There's nothing wrong with using importance weights whose values
depend on the source of the data, as long as everyone concerned
agrees on the how important the various sources are.

The weights don't need to be integers, but they should be positive.
(Zero is OK; data values with zero weight are simply ignored.)
Also, only the relative values of the weights matter.
Multiplying all the weights by a constant won't change anything.

For data values x1,...,xn with corresponding weights w1,...,,wn
the weighted mean is  m = (sum w*xi)/(sum wi).

There is also a weighted variance:
v = (sum wi*(xi-m)^2)/(sum wi) = (sum wi*xi^2)/(sum wi) - m^2.

The effective sample size is  n' = (sum wi)^2/(sum wi^2),
which will usually not be an integer. In general, 1 &lt;= n' &lt;= n.
If all the weights are equal then n' = n.
To the extent that one weight dominates all the others, n' -&gt; 1.

Those who prefer to divide by n-1 instead of n when getting the
usual unweighted variance will probably want to use  v' = v*n'/(n'-1)
as the weighted variance.

Thank you, this is exactly what I was looking for and helps prove my
formulation is valid. In fact, I think the normalized (0 to 1) weight
value may be clearer in my case. Do you know of any references off-
hand that use a sample size weighted as you show for n'?

Thanks again,
Kerry

&gt; Thank you, this is exactly what I was looking for and helps prove my
&gt; formulation is valid. In fact, I think the normalized (0 to 1) weight
&gt; value may be clearer in my case. Do you know of any references off-
&gt; hand that use a sample size weighted as you show for n'?

&gt; Thanks again,

The short answer is No. The closest things to n' that I know of are
Soon's quasi-n in his binomial approximation to the compound binomial,
Simpson's reciprocal index of diversity in ecosystems, Box's adjusted
d.f. for non-sphericity in repeated measures analysis of variance,
and Satorra &amp; Bentler's adjusted d.f. for their adjusted chi-square
in structural equation modeling. What they all share is that they are
trying to measure the number of equally-weighted components that a
system has. Can someone else help out here with other examples?

I call n' the &quot;effective sample size&quot; because it behaves like
a sample size in the relations it has with other quantities.
If the data values are sampled from a population with mean M
and variance V then:
1. m is an unbiased estimate of M, but v is a biased estimate of V;
2. the sampling variance of m is V/n';
3. v' = v*n'/(n'-1) is an unbiased estimate of V;
4. v'/n' is an unbiased estimate of the sampling variance of m.

2, 3, &amp; 4 are just as in ordinary unweighted analyses,
but with n' replacing n.
