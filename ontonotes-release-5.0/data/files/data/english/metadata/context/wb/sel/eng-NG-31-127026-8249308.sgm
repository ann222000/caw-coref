Horror gripped the heart of a World War-I soldier, as he saw his lifelong
friend fall in battle. The soldier asked his Lieutenant if he could go out
to bring his fallen comrade back.

&quot;You can go,&quot; said the Lieutenant,&quot; but don't think it will be worth it.

Your friend is probably dead and you may throw your life away.&quot;

&quot;The Lieutenant's words didn't matter, and the soldier went anyway.

Miraculously, he managed to reach his friend, hoisted him onto his shoulder
and brought him back to their company's trench. The officer checked the
wounded soldier, then looked kindly at his friend.

&quot;I told you it wouldn't be worth it,&quot; he said. &quot;Your friend is dead and you
are mortally wounded.&quot;

&quot;It was worth it, Sir,&quot; said the soldier.

&quot;What do you mean by worth it?&quot; responded the Lieutenant. &quot;Your friend is
dead.&quot;

&quot;Yes Sir,&quot; the soldier answered,

&quot;but it was worth it because when I got to him, he was still alive and I had
the satisfaction of hearing him say....

&quot; Jim...I knew you'd come.&quot;

Many times in life, whether a thing is worth doing or not, really depends on
how u look at it.

Take up all your courage and do something your heart tells you to do so that
you may not  regret not doing it later in your
life...&lt; http://www.funlok.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task;=view&amp;id;=2180&amp;... &gt;
