I think so. There are no martial artists/fighters in the world that
cannot get better at fighting by training in boxing.

No matter what your background is, judo, bjj, wrestling, JJJ, karate,
TKD, mma, ... you can get better at fighting by adding some boxing
training.

Having been a boxer many moons ago, I could not agree more. Your hand speed
increases tremenbdously and you learn how to put a lot of power in your
punches. In close, your legs are not a lot good ( barring the use of knees
of course).

My vote still goes to boxing, but I see your point.

I did something that was called JJJ but really just was judo as a kid,
and was never explained any self defense aspect of it. Yes, we did a
lot of throwing randori, gripfighting, lots of newaza, but taking a
striking opponent down and choking them out was never covered in
class.

Even though I got into minor scraps in primary and high school (and
came out winning because of takedown/ground skills) I kept believing
that striking would be a superior fighting strategy and I did not
realize the self defense/fighting value of grappling until I saw the
first UFC on video years later (by which time I was into kick/thai
boxing).

I disagree.

It seems that boxing itself is not that spectacular a martial art,
rather the boxers, all professionals, are spectacular martial
artists.  This is not do to boxing, but rather the intensive training
regimens they put themselves through.

Regardless of what martial art you study, if you approach your
training with the no-nonsense attitude of a professional boxer, you
are bound to be tough.

As for how boxing compares to other martial arts, I would say its
emphasis on contact will give the boxer confidence (he or she will
KNOW their techniques work, or he or she will be seeing stars!).  The
fact that boxing techniques will be limited to punches can prove to be
a disadvantage, particularly if an adversay is skilled in muay thai,
le savate, or any martial art that places emphasis on non-punching
techniques and well as punching.

One kid I've been training boxing with lately (at work, yay) is the
state title holder.  He's 15yr old, and very small, his last fight was
at only &lt;48kg or something, but he's done serious training &amp; competed.
When I hold the mits for him - damn does he hit hard!  All way out of
proportion to his size, i would _not_ want to catch his hook to the
side of my jaw.  When I watch and hold the mits for other kids his
age, bigger/normal sized, though untrained, its a huge difference.
Maybe they'll manage one or two hard ones, but they're off balance,
clumsy, generally much weaker punches.  Its like night and day, quite
amazing to work with him.

I suspect boxers could all get significantly better at fighting by
adding most other martial arts, too.

It's a great way to train a subset of skills. The gaps in it are too
large, IMO, for it to be considered a complete MA in its own right;
the circumstances it trains for are too specific, the rules too far
developed. But I would recommend it as part of a balanced diet of
grappling, striking and weapons work.

A good boxer can enter a muay thai ring, or a savate ring, rush his
opponent from the start onwards and have a chance of winning. Top
kickboxers can lose against strong guys that just rush forward and
punch.

The opposite, a thaiboxer coming into a boxing fight and rushing the
boxer with punches will not work.

This is exactly what I meant by people underestimating boxing. Knowing
more techniques does not necessarily equal being a better fighter.

Most martial arts don't even come close to the conditioning of a
boxer, let alone the experience in having another guy come towards you
and trying to punch your head right off.

Sure, but the statement was not that they are the best martial art,
just the most underrated.

Boxers will become better when they add grappling or kicking, but most
grappling/kicking arts are rated much higher than boxing by the
general public.

That depends. A guy with the rudimentary boxing skills (and no
kickboxings skills at all) was able to take out one of the worlds best
thai boxers and savate champs, Ernesto Hoost.

Twice.

Just by rushing in and punching him.

You can't move while you kick.

Unless you do the TKD bounce.

Excellent, looking forward to it.

Do you think the fistwork of old-school pugilism is less suited to
self-defence than modern boxing, in that it's more static and has less
defence? Obviously I'm asking you because I want the
counterargument :P

Not at all.  The fist work is well suited to bare-fisted striking, as
opposed to modern boxing which heavily depends upon gloves and wraps. The
vertical fist used by classic pugilism actually minimizes chances of the
typical &quot;Boxers Fracture.&quot;  Further, the suggestion that it's &quot;more static
and has less defence&quot; is incorrect.  The arms tend to be held at a further
distance but &quot;more static&quot; is hardly accurate. They were moved about much
as modern MMA longer range Attitudes are today.  In fact, the &quot;Celebrated
Pugilist&quot; who penned _The Art and Practice of Boxing_ recommended that you
keep your fists in constant motion so that your opponent wouldn't know
when you were launching an attack.  Modern Martial Artists, such as the
well qualified Dog Brothers, have been using this tactic (iirc, they call
it the &quot;snaky stick&quot;).  Additionally, the &quot;less defence&quot; is, at best, a
misunderstanding.  Classic Pugilists used numerous defensive movements,
starting with strong footwork.  Their footwork was often based on
swordwork, Backsword/Broadsword, Rapier, and Smallsword, in fact, it was
often taught together and shows up together in a few period manuals.  What
would today be identified as both &quot;circular&quot; and &quot;triangular&quot; stepping
were used by Classic Pugilists.  Besides the outward and inward parries
and elbow defenses, there was even Jack Slack's (awesome name for a
boxer!) strange pointy elbow guard.  Carl Cestari has called it the
&quot;Dracula Guard&quot; because it was like a vampire wrapping his cloak around in
a B grade movie.  It is well designed for forcing your opponent to punch
your elbow (owwie owwie) and then riposte with a backfist or hammerfist
(aka &quot;Chopper&quot;).

When you mix in the classic pugilistic grappling methods along with this
you have a *very* strong unarmed fighting style to which one would only
need add ground grappling (which was also readily available and frequently
cross trained in - at least by amateurs and interested lay-folk).

I'm not writing anything that anyone else couldn't find, at least those
with access to antique manuals.  Fortunately, many of the manuals I'm
using are already available online for free.

Yes, but other martial arts that focus on bareknuckle fighting
(kyokushin, lethwei, some muay thai,...) use standard horizontal
punches to good effect as well. Win chun and BKB are afaik the main
ones promoting vertical punches.

You'll have to make your own decision, of course, but all the anatomical
data I've seen indicates that a vertical, or half-turned at most, fist is
biomechanically better suited.

I don't know. Biomechanically I agree that you should hit with the two
biggest knuckles, but that doesn't necessarily equate using a vertical
fist.

For a straight right/left it shouldn't matter as long as you hit with
the two top knuckles. You can do this with a horizontal as well as
with a vertical fist and still keep your bones all nicely lined up so
that no power is lost. Horizontal would give you more reach, and more
protection (rolling up your shoulder).

For a hook it depends imo on distancing.

Generally for a very short range punch you'd probably use a vertical
punch (thumb upwards), as is taught in modern day boxing. This way you
hit the opponent with the two top knuckles.

For a long range hook/swing you'd probably be best off using a
vertical fist, thumb down, so that you again hit with the two big
knuckles.
