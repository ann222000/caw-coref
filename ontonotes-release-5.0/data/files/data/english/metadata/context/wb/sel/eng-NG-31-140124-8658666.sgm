This &quot;insider info&quot; from the RFML:
**********
Hey all,

I went over a non-detailed description last week...
I'll try to break it down now...

McCown wasn't 100% yesterday... On any other team, he doesn't get the
start...
BUT.....
Lane wanted him to start... Why? Because Al wants Culpepper to start...

There is a rift right now between the 2...
It all comes down to this...

Al wanted to cut Moses, Lane didn't... Moses got cut...so, in response, Lane
cuts Whitted and Adkisson (Al's favorites)

Well, now it still continues... Since Lane is the coach, HE wants to run
this team and have the final say and wants it to be KNOWN that he is doing
so...
So, since Al wants Culpepper to start, Lane will do everything in the world
to start McCown... Lane also knows that if he was to start Culpepper and
win, he wouldn't be able to take him out in the next game and is very afraid
of that...

The saga continues!
********

If this has any trace of truth to it, JC must be going nuts knowing he wants
the same thing Al wants!  8^)

Most posters that claim to have an inside source in the Raiders organization
are either full of shit or are being mislead.  I just thought it was funny.
If there really is a rift between Al and &quot;Lance&quot;, Kiff better not push too
hard or he'll end up working for Shanahan for free and trying to recoup
monies owed to him.  Shanahan's advice to Kiffin:  &quot;Don't be seen  talking

Oooh, *nice* one!

&quot;Ugolino's story is all the more powerful because the speaker makes no
attempt to exonerate himself of the crime--political treachery--for which
he is condemned to eternal damnation. He instead wishes to defame his
enemy and elicit compassion from his audience by recounting the brutal
manner in which he and his children were killed.&quot;

Ya never know about them sources. The Raiders are known for their paranoia
concerning security. IIRC correctly, I goaded Shadow into breaking into
Raiders HQ at the last Alegate he attended. Got to hand it to him, I made
the suggestion but he took it upon himself to go undercover as an Aussie
Raiders fan. He pulled it off too, even though he had the WORST Aussie
accent I've ever heard.

I think Gruden wrestled control from Davis for a time actually.  The
indicators were there IMO.  But Davis's ego can only take that for so
long.  He eventually had enough of all the Gruden hype and let the guy
go.  Just like when Marcus Allen was benched.  Marcus became the
Raiders, and Al couldn't live with that.

As far as Kiffin and Davis, I'm sure they are still battling it out to
some degree.  Davis has to let Kiffin get his way on some of the small
stuff.  But make no mistake, when Al wants change, he gets change.
Gruden's control of the Raiders existed for a small time because Al let
it be that way.  But that only will last so long.

BTW, I'm completely confused about the McClown/Culpepper situation.
It's pretty hard to analyze the situation since it's so early in the
coach/owner relationship.  Whatever the case, McClown will eventually
lose the job because he truly does suck.  Hopefully sooner rather than
later.  Walters is a better QB, period.  And Culpepper clearly won the
starting job in preseason, regardless of whether or not I thought his
signing was appropriate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What Al says goes, period.
&gt;&gt;&gt; So you are giving all the credit during the hot three year
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gruden era to Al?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Glad we cleared that up.

&gt;&gt; I think Gruden wrestled control from Davis for a time
&gt;&gt; actually.  The indicators were there IMO.  But Davis's ego
&gt;&gt; can only take that for so long.  He eventually had enough of
&gt;&gt; all the Gruden hype and let the guy go.  Just like when
&gt;&gt; Marcus Allen was benched.  Marcus became the Raiders, and Al
&gt;&gt; couldn't live with that.

&gt; Shell benched Marcus, according to Shell.
">

Not according to Marcus. Do you just believe everything you want to
believe or do you attempt to apply some logic to the situation?  Do you
remember the pained look on Shell's face on the sidelines when Marcus
would ask him &quot;what the fuck?&quot;  Do you remember Al coming on MNF
football and telling the audience that he had something on Allen and he
would eventually reveal the horrors of Marcus's bad ways?  Uh, uh.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Shell benched Porter.
">

Uh, uh.  Big deal.  There's more to the story here.  Shell started shit
with Porter before camp even started.  Since Shell had no previous
relationship with Porter, who the hell set this in motion?  Why did
Shell single out Porter the FIRST time he made contact with the guy?
Eh?  Think it through.  I guess in your mind Al just lays back and let's
everything hang loose.  Al's history and continual behavior since the
80's tells me otherwise.  De-construct my opinions all day bro, but try
to present some sensible logic of your own, cause right now all I get
from you is that you're an Al apologist simply because you're a Raider
fan.  Unlike you my man, I'm a Raider fan because it's my home and where
I was raised not because I think the image and uniforms are super
coolio.  Dig?  I don't need Al to be an icon to be a fan.  I really gotz
no time for you wanna-beeezzz, feel me?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You believe that a young coach could wrest control from Al,

Al has made some blunders lately... the two most obvious is the Moss
experiment, and the Shell fiasco.  But there are very few owners that
haven't made a lot of mistakes in the inexact science called the NFL.

I'd guess every team has childish 20/20 hindsite fans that dwell on all
the negatives and ignore all the positives.

Just seems like the Raiders have more of them than any team... kinda

No one here that criticizes Al has ever not been in.  I can think
critically and root for my team rather than say we're going to dominate
and win this many games every year (like Gary) without having a fucking
clue as to what it takes to play the game.

&gt; &gt; Glad to see that after two very competitive games you are still in.
&gt; &gt; It's important to remember where reasonable expectations were at the

Hey, let's not talk football.  Who needs psychics when you can just
stare at a blank screen.

Doesn't take much to figure that out.  But Rock, you went from being
amused to getting very tired all in one week?  Tell ya what, I'll give
you a break for a couple of weeks.  But Gary just gives me too much
material to work with.  Like the guy or not, he's not the brightest bulb

Amused?

I remember comparing your little tiff to two girls in a catfight (and
pissing TQB off) if that is what you mean.  What bugs me personally
about it is that you two are consistently among the best reads in this
entire NG when it comes to X's and O's.

See, this is what happens without smiley faces.  I wan't pissed off,
TRoaR.  I was clucking my tongue and rolling my eyes at these two, but I
didn't really think what they were doing merited being compared to a cat
fight, which is usually uglier and more prolonged.

It seems I was wrong, and I owe you an apology.  They have met the &quot;fight
way too long about way too little&quot; minimum requirements for cattiness, and
they passed the &quot;unrelated snippiness&quot; quotient some time ago.

..which is why they should leave the cattiness to the likes of me and
stick to what they know.  Unless those X's and O's meant kisses and hugs,
that is.

This from someone that thinks our linebackers are a problem this year.

Sorry guys... he will prolly be fine once we start winning again.
