Does anyone here have a Wii?  Does anyone here have a Wii and Miis?  Does
anyone here have a Wii, Miis, and have them set to mingle?

.....and have their Wii on the internet?

If so, send me an e-mail with your console number, and I'll send you mine,
and we'll mingle our Miis!!

Mii's are your avatars on the Nintendo Wii.  They're used in some games
that support them, and if you allow them to mingle, they'll travel to other
systems registered with yours, which is what I need the console numbers
for.

The downside to them is that you're only allowed human avatars.....

For some reason this reminds me of the joke about the time the Ghostbusters
all needed take a leak but there was only one urinal available: all was ok
until they crossed the streams and blew up the building.

(Seeing the _Ghostbusters_ movie may be required to understand the above
joke.)

Perhaps, but the pronunciation of &quot;Mii&quot; is &quot;Me&quot;, therefore Miingle doesn't
have the same ring to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mii's are your avatars on the Nintendo Wii.  They're used in some games
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that support them, and if you allow them to mingle, they'll travel to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; systems registered with yours, which is what I need the console numbers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The downside to them is that you're only allowed human avatars.....
&gt;&gt;&gt; Some systems allow you to give them wings and/or tails.  Dunno about
&gt;&gt;&gt; Nintendo though.

&gt;&gt; No.  But if you're creative, you can make horns, or elf ears, or something

That brought me up a thought...

On the eight of december, year 2006, Wii was going to be released in Europe.
I was going to get it in the release day, as I loved to have a new Nintendo
console since I played Gamecube a lot. (And I have no idea why I'm not really
interested to Nintendo anymore.)

When I was travelling around the Internet, many other europeans were also very
excited about the Wii. And what did I assumes, a lot of people were going to
get it. Even I laid out plans, how, when, and where to get a Wii.

And I was right. When the Wiis got released, there was a massacre in many,
many stores. Even fights inside just about a single console, and risks of a
death... Many disappointments, and even the customer support in the day was
really horrible. However, I decided to invest several hundred kilometers
trying to find a console, and like I laid out, I found at least one. That was
the second last one of the shop, and the town I bought the console from wasn't
very active either.

Now I can't even imagine, how could I get a console as fast I could. I haven't
played it like a reasonable Nintendo fan would, so I think that was my last
excitement at gathering a new console.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe &quot;Miingle&quot; would be a better word for it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Wii'll Miingle&quot;? XD

&gt;&gt; In the console, it's called &quot;Mingle&quot;, so it doesn't really need a decision
&gt;&gt; because we could just use the official word.

&gt; I know, but Wii'll Miingle look good and fun XD

Of course it would, but there's a line on, should something look as &quot;official&quot;,
just because third-parties rating the console usually pay attention at
&quot;official&quot; tones when rating., or should something look as &quot;exciting&quot; for
users of the console.

No, see, you give me your code, I put it into my Wii.  I give you my

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think I saw the movie 3 years ago, and I can't remember anything
&gt;&gt;&gt; about it.
&gt;&gt; The part where Egon tells them not to cross the streams (of their
&gt;&gt; proton packs) or Something Bad(R) would happen.....
&gt; ...I can't seriously remember anything about it. Only the candy man
&gt; and the vacuum cleaner. Well that's anything, and that's all.

Vaccuum cleaner?  What movie are you talking about?  I don't recall a
vaccuum cleaner.....  And the &quot;candy man&quot; in the movie is the Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man.....

THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #10: SIMPLE    SIMPLE is an acronym
for Sheer Idiot's Monopurpose Programming Language Environment. This
language, developed at the Hanover College for Technological Misfits, was
designed to make it impossible to write code with errors in it. The
statements are, therefore, confined to BEGIN, END and STOP. No matter how
you arrange the statements, you can't make a syntax error. Programs written
in SIMPLE do nothing useful. Thus they achieve the results of programs
written in other languages without the tedious, frustrating process of
testing and debugging.         -- Herd Thinners
