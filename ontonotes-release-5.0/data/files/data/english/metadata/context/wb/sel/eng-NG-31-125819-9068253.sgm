Cyclists from the Camden area are highly likely to cycle. Indeed
touring cyclists are likely to cycle from a considerable distance
outside London, certainly further than the &quot;underground&quot; lines reach
out of London. If they do travel to London by train then they do not
need to send their vehicle 24 hours ahead, or pack it into a bike
bag.

Only a small proportion of cycling is a sport, just like only a
small proportion of motoring is a sport or only a small proportion
of flying is a sport. The fact that you try and categorise cycling
as a sport indicates that you know very little about it and it would
be wise to find out a little more about it before sounding off.

The cycle tourist who does this faces the prospect of a vehicle
which they have not maintained, which may thus be in indifferent
mechanical condition. It may not be possible to mount their luggage
on the vehicle, after they have dragged the luggage around two
stations and perhaps elsewhere. They are likely to have an unhappy

People have pointed out that it is possible to take a bike on a

Many of these potential customers would like to use the train for

them even more badly than aeroplane companies do (and that takes
some doing).

The vast majority of passengers on proper trains don't want to take

Those who want to get to London by train will be the ones travelling
from further afield. They have the ability to do so without all the
nonsense Eurostar have decided to force on anyone determined enough
to want to travel. When they arrive in London they can cycle to St
Pancras, cycling between most of the London terminals is far quicker
than any other means of transport, other than perhaps a criminally

Don't take it so personally - they take exactly the same attitude to
anyone with non-standard luggage. I went to Paris by Eurostar a few
years ago and wanted to take a musical instrument in a case with me
(as well as normal luggage). They wanted £30 or so for the carriage of
the guitar. I did without. And that was only a (smallish) instrument.
I expect they'd want £100 to take a bike.

I'm sure British Airways don't charge that much.

There is another group of customers for whom they seem to be taking

There was no charge for the service.

If other countries can cater for the &quot;niche market&quot;, we can too.

For example, Canada's West Coast Express commuter service has a 2-cycle bay
in every car and you only have to pay $1 extra (return) to use it.  No
pre-booking, no messing about, no trouble to other passengers.  See
www.pbase.com/iceblinker/image/87811488

Certainly those who use bikes for commuting and general transport, as well
as recreation, deserve better than what we have now, and it would be good
for the country (and the railways!) in general if fewer people used cars.
Making it much easier to take a bike on the train would encourage that to
quite a large extent.

It's sad indeed if railway enthusiasts can't see the bigger picture as well
as cyclists do.

Cycle luggage systems are not all interchangeable.

Both is needed. While bike parks at train stations are mainly useful
for commuters.

There are three ways to combine bike and train:

a) cycle to the station, park the bike there for the working day, and
go by train etc to work, and cycle home on return;

b) do the same with two bikes -- one being parked over night at the
other station, and cycle to work or school;

c) take the bike on the train and use the same bike on both ends.

The latter is important especially when the train ride is not
limited to a point-to-point commute, when one might come home from
another direction, etc.

You never know the quality of the bike for hire. It may not be
suitable for the size of the cyclist, not able to take the luggage,
lots of questions. Just like many people prefer to use their own car
instead of a hired one.

It also depends a lot on what kind of bike usage is planned. One
being just cycling around in the area of the vacation place, like I
did e.g. for a weekend on a North Sea island, another being a longer
trip over several hundred kilometers with a return by train from a
completely different place as where the bicycle trip started, like my
bike trip from Würzburg along the Main river to Aschaffenburg, or a
longer trip still in the planning stage down the Weser river from
Kassel to Hameln or even Bremen. It does not make sense if I would
have to bring a hired bike back to the starting point.

Having three or four fewer seated passenegers per car isn't ridiculous.  It

The Dutch do *bikes* well enough.  I currently have the pleasure of
riding one, and I wouldn't go back to anything I have ridden
previously.  Indeed, once it becomes too worn out to be maintainable,
I will almost certainly go over to Holland and bring back another one.

It is a real pity they are not on widespread UK sale, as, while
enjoying my own ride back from the station, I see quite a number of
people also doing so, heaving knobbly-tyred supermarket mountain bikes
around the place, hunched over far-too-low handlebars with nowhere to
put their luggage and failing battery-powered lights.

Bike hire is a dwindling option, it seems to me, as more and
more people have started to carry their bikes around by car.

And whenever I do hire a bike, it always seems to have
something wrong with it. Perhaps not always so bad as the one
on Sark which didn't have any working brakes, though....

I agree, but it is not only fit, it is about general maintenance, I
hired a bike last year to go mountain biking, and had to take it

From just one foot on a pedal I can find the handle bars, get my bum on

If the handle bars are just a bit to forwards, or backwards it is a lot

A decent bike that suits well is like part of your body.  You wouldn't want
to go for a walk with someone else's legs if it was possible to use your

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you are planning a cycling holiday, you may well do some forward
&gt;&gt;&gt; planning, You may even hire a bicycle at destination.

&gt; Bicycles are much more personal than cars in terms of fit and gearing.
&gt; Cycle luggage systems are not all interchangeable.

&gt; Hiring cycles is not a simple matter for anything more than a very basic
&gt; machine.
&gt; Some of us honed our bicycles and equipment to suit our personal needs
&gt; over decades; the benefit of this is lost on a hired machine.
">

Its very difficult to make cycle hire work out economically. The first
day of someone riding a bike will cause almost as much wear and tear as
the next week and will probably take an hour to check over and sort out.
A fair number of customers will wreak your bikes and then demand a
refund because they broke.

The three ways that seem to work are:

Sell it as part of a holiday, you can hide the costs as part of the
accommodation and guide/backup services, your customers will be using
the bikes for a while and you may be able to keep an eye on them,
hopefully they will be respectable people.

Hire bomb proof and low performance bike like the Paris scheme, get a
wacking great deposit and don't be afraid to keep it.

Hire out pre wreaked bikes on an as-seen basis.

There's no way you could hire out nice bike on short hire to strangers
as a reasonable rate.

A slight step up from the Paris set up would be to allow people to hire
bike time from a fleet, with a hefty deposit and be prepared to sack
customers if they abuse the bikes. This may work out as a club or co-op
operating from a station.

A bit like saying &quot;trains are trains&quot;.  They're not.

Car hire allows you quyite a bit of variation in what you get.  If
you've got a lot of gear you can get an estate, if you're travelling a
long way you can get a bit more refinement, if it's for round town you
can get something small, and so on.  But hire bikes are generally much
of a muchness.  I'm very happy to take a Dutch station hire bike if I'm
pottering round the local town (and have done so), but on a touring
holiday earlier this year we took our good touring bikes all the way
over on the ferry, because riding them for a week is a lot nicer than
riding a hire shop bike for a week.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If it's a niche market it isn't very big and is thus easy to cater to.
A bike isn't really much harder to deal with than a couple of large
suitcases.  What doesn't work, as you correctly pointed out with
scaling, is everyone wanting to take one.  But if everyone doesn't it
becomes a lot easier to manage.

In my very limited experience, the WCE doesn't load nearly as heavily as the

&gt;&gt;Perhaps you mean the &quot;sporting cyclist&quot;. A niche market.

&gt;I doubt it. A sporting cyclist would have a bike set up for sport,
&gt;either a track bike or one for road racing. Neither are any use for
&gt;riding on a holiday.

I'm happy to include those in the niche.

&gt;A bit like saying &quot;trains are trains&quot;.  They're not.

To most people they are. Trains are a relatively uncomfortable (compared
to a modern saloon car) way of getting from A to B. You make sacrifices
to travel by train. One of those is limiting your choices of cycle to
use at the far end.

That's one of the things that mitigates travel on *some* (not all)
trains. There are plenty without loos, and significant numbers of
standing passengers, for example.

My pet peeve is seat-back tables smaller than a sheet of A4, which are
no use at all for working on. And luggage racks that won't even take the
standard sized airline carry-on.

Fiver for a bag sounds a bit low for Ryanair[1]... ;-/

Self &amp; Spouse took bikes to Beziers by E* &amp; TGV in September. We would
gladly have paid the £20 each way to have them transported on the same
train as ourselves, but to do this you have to either (i) turn up at
Waterloo a day or two in advance and get them booked on your train  -
not an option if you live in Sheffield (ii) be prepared to wait up to 24
hrs for them  in Paris  - also not an option. We could have flown from
Eastmids to Carcassonne for roughly the same money, but wanted to do the
Green thing and I prefer travelling by train to flying anyway.

We have bike bags purchased from mikedyason.com. Getting them through
security at Waterloo was a major hassle, with Eurostar staff distinctly
unhelpful. Once on all was fine - even putting bikes together, cycling
across Paris to Gare du Lyon, re-packing bikes was perfectly doable in
an hour. Coming back, cycling along the canal on Sunday when the roads
are closed was a real pleasure. Changing trains at Lille is a better
option  - I tried hard to find a Lille connection from Beziers via the
varios web sites but to no avail. I was therefore less than happy when a
TGV to Lille came in at Beziers a few minutes before our one to Paris! I
still can't find any trace of this service on Rail Europe.

Unfortunately by the time you've put the bikes back in their bags all
the luggage space has been nabbed so you have to find space in the
corridor/buffet.

Before booking I checked with Rail. Europe as to whether you could book
bikes on the TGV, but was told you had to put them in bags. Inspecting
the train at Gare Du Lyon I discovered a compartment with hooks for
again about 6 bikes, seemingly unused.

On the return, there were no trolleys at Gare Du Nord, so we had to drag
the bags about 200 yards along the terminal - again zero assistance from
Eurostar. We could see trolleys on the platform waiting for arriving
passengers, but would they let us pop down and pick up a couple? When we
did get to the platform they asked us to put the bikes in the luggage
car - which was empty and has (I think) 6 hooks for bikes. That was fine
but when we got to Waterloo they couldn't be bothered to open the door
to the luggage car so I had to drag the bikes down the corridor to the
nearest available door. We put the bikes back together on the platform
and by the time we got to the exit there was no security, passport
control or anything - we just walked through.

So in sum, null points to Eurostar, &amp; only a few for SNCF  for
bike-friendliness I think. We would do it again but will re-think our
approach - bags with wheels on, or expensive folding bikes are options
we are looking at. Contrary to what many might think the UK is the best
country in Europe for carrying bikes on long-distance trains, as the
European Cyclists Federation Report shows -
http://www.ecf.com/files/2/12/13/070509_Bike_and_Train_EU.pdf

Seat 61 has some good advice about European bikes on trains -
