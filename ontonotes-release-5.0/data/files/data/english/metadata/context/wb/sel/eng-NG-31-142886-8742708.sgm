September 27th - St. Marcellus of Saint-Gall
(also known as Moengal)

Died c. 869-887. Although Saint Marcellus was born either in Scotland or
Ireland, he was a monk of Saint-Gall in Switzerland. It seems that he and
his
uncle, the learned Bishop Marcus, were among a group of pilgrims who stopped
at
Saint-Gall on their return to the islands. Instead of continuing on, they
placed
themselves under the direction of Abbot Grimwoald. Marcellus sent his horses
and
pack mules home, but kept the gold, vestments, and books for the abbey. The
8th-century &quot;Book of Gospels&quot; (manuscript 51), now housed in the Saint-Gall
Cathedral Library, may have been one of the books the bishop donated to the
monastery.

The young, brilliant Saint Marcellus was given charge of the cloister
schools.
He is known for having tutored Blessed Notker Balbulus (f.d. April 6), who
originated liturgical sequences, as well as other celebrated figures. During
this period, Saint-Gall's scribes supplied all of Germany with manuscript
books
of Gregorian chant, often illuminated.

The Irish with some merit claim him as the instigator of the cultural
eminence
of Saint Gall. The 11th-century German historian Ekkehard wrote: &quot;It is
delightful to recall how Saint-Gall began to increase and flourish under the
auspices of Moengal and his colleagues.&quot; In the 19th century, H. Zimmer
wrote:
&quot;In my opinion, there were very few men who in the middle of the 9th century
exerted such a beneficent influence upon the German mind in the cultivation
of
the higher arts and sciences as Moengal and his followers.&quot; The abbey
necrology
calls Marcellus &quot;the most learned and excellent man&quot; (Benedictines, D'Arcy,
Fitzpatrick 2, Gougaud, Henry, Montague, Tommasini).

Quote:
All the good of creatures consists in the fulfillment of the Divine Will.
And
this is never better attained than by the practice of obedience, in which is
found the annihilation of self-love and the true liberty of sons of God.
This
is the reason why souls truly good, experience such great joy and sweetness
in
obedience.
-St. Vincent de Paul

Bible Quote
36 God is wonderful in his saints: the God of Israel is he who will give
power
and strength to his people.
Blessed be God.   (Psalms 67:36)
