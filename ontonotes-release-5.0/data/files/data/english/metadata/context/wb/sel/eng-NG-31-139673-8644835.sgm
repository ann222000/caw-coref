When you walk into the computer room and smell burnt circuit board
it's never a good omen.  That's what I came in to find a couple of
days back.

I found the 64FX dead in the water.  It rebooted fine and I checked to
make sure every thing was backed up...It was except for the mail
files.

I left it copying those files and went to work out in the shop. When I
came back in I found the screen dark again and this time it would not
reboot. It wouldn't even bring up the BIOS flash screen. the start
button only brings on the lights and fans for a moment, then all goes
silent again. The PS indicator on the mo bo indicates all OK with it.

Soooo...that only leaves the CPU, or PS, or Video card, or
motherboard. The 8800 smells OK, and the PS *seems* to be OK, but I
have a new 64X2 6000 on order (cost a fraction of the FX62) plus a new
850 watt PS. If the old one turns out to be Ok it 'll make a good
spare for testing in these cases..

Parts should be here by mid week. Then I'll have a better idea as to
what's happening.  At least FSX is also on the X2 6000 in the shop as
are the drives out of the FX62 now. &lt;:-))

Oh, I'll have it back up and running  within a week or two, but right
now the decisions are going to be based on what's bad.  CPU? It' gets
replaced.  PS? It gets replaced, Motherboard? Then it looks like it'd
be a whole new system. The problem comes from building a new system
with DDR2 1333/PC10600  Memory.  Then it starts to get expensive.
&lt;:-)). I have lots of DDR2-800 but that would defeat the purpose of
the much faster FSB capabilities.  So, time will tell, but truth be
known I'd really like to upgrade this old single core system to a Quad
core rather than replacing one of the existing dual core.

A fan was shorting out (one that gets its power from a small 2-pin connector on
the MB), causing the same on-and-immediately-off problem you describe.
I disconnected the fan and the PC ran fine until I could get a replacement
installed...

Just a thought...

Plug in any handy piezoelectric PC speaker you have handy to the speaker
header on the mobo (usually bundled with the front connectors) and
listen for POST codes.

An on-and-off symptom is a short, and the PSU/mobo protecting itself
from a dangerous transient voltage. DO NOT PLUG IN THE NEW COMPONENTS
UNTIL YOU FIND THAT SHORT. You won't find anything and just end up
burning the new stuff ad nauseum until you get tired of spending money.

I'd recommend that you pull the whole mobo out and inspect every part
until bright lights, front and back. Roll out some newspaper or anything
that's both sheet-like and non-conductive (and doesn't hold static
charges, no plastic) and lay the mobo down on it. You can test your
components individually, starting with just the mobo/PSU together (find
a jumper or an appropriate length of wire; short the power button pins
briefly to get the PSU to start drawing current). You should end up with
a predictable pattern of POST codes. Repeat with each part until you
find the guilty culprit (or if the first situation doesn't work, you
know it's the PSU or the mobo).

A burning smell, in my experience, is usually the PSU giving up. You can
do some exploratory surgery on it, especially if you already intend to
replace it. Leave it out, unplugged and with the switch off for at least
24 hours, then carefully (and armed with an electrical screwdriver and a
properly applied grounding strap) open the case and have a look for any
parts that are obviously burned, scorched, burst, broken, or otherwise
kattywompus.

Hey...Turn me loose and I'll bet I can do permanent (and expensive)
damage even from the keyboard&lt;:-))  Lordy, I once dumped one of the
databases for a multi-billion dollar, multi-national corporation down
the toilet. Course I was able to get everything except a few hours
worth of it back out of the archives. OTOH there were a number of lab
people who had to re-enter a few hours worth of testing data (they
have a *lot* of labs) that were not at all happy.  OTOH after I moved
on up the food chain my replacement managed to do the same, but with
about 16 hours worth of testing that had to be re-entered.

I wore a pager from the day I hired in until the day I retired. They
paged  me on the flight line during the big fly-in at Oshkosh, and
then paged me over the flight-line PA system when I couldn't get to a
phone fast enough. They paged me where I was staying during the fly-in
and they even paged me while on vacation visiting my wife's folks in
Florida. It seems as if I forgot to take the pager with me when Joyce
and I flew the Deb out to visit my daughter in Colorado. it was right
there on the bed next to where we packed our luggage! Honest! &lt;:-))

However, it is posible to do damage from the keyboard that is not
recoverable. IE, permanently trash the BIOS, and hard drives so they
can't even be reformatted.  So, if you really want an excuse to
replace that old computer cuze it &quot;failed&quot; I can give you a few hints
&lt;snicker&gt;. Unfortunately education can be expensive.

Yanno, if you happen to get a new mobo with a faster FSB, you can give
the extra DDR2-800 memory to me.  That's what I use. ;)

Thanks, but unfortunately that was the first test I ran after taking
it apart. I removed all the HDs too.  A couple years ago I did have
that very problem. Unhook the fan and it'd run. Reconnect the fan and
it'd quit. Just one little case fan.

I've also had something as simple as a USB add on PCI card cause it.
Come to think of it, I've had two USB add on cards that shut down
systems. Fortunately they did no other damage.

I have two of these machines in full size Thermaltake, steel tower
cases and they are HEAVY! Strong enough to stand on too. I should put
wheels under them.
The FX 62 and the 64 X2 6000 are in identical cases with 800 Watt
power supplies. This one is in an Antec 180 black steel, mid-size
tower which I like better than the Thermaltake. OTOH the PS is in the
bottom and requires a bit of planning on power supply cable routing
and motherboard connector placement, particularly when you have one or
two *BIG* PCIe graphics cards. I'd like to get one of the new Antec
182SE mid size tower cases, but the darn things run $230 with no PS
and the cable routing from the PS can be a royal pain in the backside
at times. OTOH it is a Stainless Steel case with a mirror finish.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

The new cases with large, low RPM fans are quiet and have much more
efficient cooling than the old mid and small towers with lots of
small, high RPM fans. BTW the two ThermalTake cases have a 10&quot; (250mm)
fan in the side in addition to multiple 140 MM fans in the front and
back.

But talking of prices, check the price of DDR2 1333 memory. Top end,
DDR2 800 stuff is absolutely cheap at roughly one quarter of the
price!

If this thing had only waited a couple months to fail. By then the
Q6850 will probably be about half its current price. &lt;sigh&gt;

Grounding strap?
I hate to admit (and I'm serious), I normally work on these things in
my lap while sitting on the living room carpet.  Tain't zapped one
yet. OTOH I have an inc=grained habit of hanging onto the metal case
and staying grounded to something neutral.

Mo Bo looks OK and no smelly parts.
Video card is clean as well, but were it the video card I'd be getting
to the beep codes. As you've already said, there are really only two
things likely that can stop it that quick. OTOH Fans and CPU can cause
the MoBo to prevent the start.  OTOH a shorted HD motor can as well.
I've pulled the three main 500 Gig SATAs, but there are still 5 drives
a dual layer DVD/CD R/W drive, memory card reader, and floppy to pull.

All those drives are the reason for the full size tower cases. They
leave room between the drives for cooling.  BTW the Antec cases have 4
drives mounted in a carrier at the bottom with a filtered 140 mm fan
in front pushing air in and another pulling air out into the PS  which
has another 140 MM fan pushing air out the back. Then there are more
drives in another carrier above that deck which have a 140 mm fan
pushing &quot;filtered&quot; air through them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Absolutely nada so far, but even though I can't get my nose in there I
think the strongest smell is coming from partway up that stack of
drives.

Man, but I hate the thought of pulling all those drives. I think I'll
start where the smell is the strongest. That's another thing I like
about the Antec. The drives &quot;snap out&quot; by just squeezing a pair of
slides together. Squeeze, pull, and disconnect.  No screws to take out
or covers to remove.  I can then stick them into external enclosures
and test them without firing up the &quot;troubled&quot; system.

BTW, between 5 computers I have over 7 Terabytes of storage although a
good portion (11 drives) is external SATA and USB hooked up only
during backup and restore.

DDR2-800 runs at its rated 800mhz on a 1600mhz FSB (linked 1:1). The newest
desktop chipsets such as the P35 have a 1333 mhz bus (which can of coarse be
overclocked depending on the processor).

You would have to run a Q6600 2.4Ghz C2D quad at 3.6Ghz (9x multiplier) before
you would even reach 800mhz on your memory with it linked at 1:1. Anyway, the
point is you can have an extremely fast system using 800mhz memory and can
always upgrade the memory later.
