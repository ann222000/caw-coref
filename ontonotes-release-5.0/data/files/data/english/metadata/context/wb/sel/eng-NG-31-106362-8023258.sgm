I agree with Vickie, the kids are ready. Seriously though what kinds of
things are you wanting to know? Take a tour of the building so they have an
idea of where to go. They usually have orientations that they can attend
when school was in session. Not much you can do though until they actually
get into the school and figure things out for themselves.

The other thing to do is make sure they're reading a lot over the
summer. And check to see if there is required summer homework if you
don't know already.

Yea, that's good for an academic side of things, which is what the
poster probably was asking.

Socially this is going to be pretty tough.

I suggest sitting down and talking to them about some of the stuff
they might encounter.  Peer pressure, especially.  I don't think you
need to go into detail, just give them a heads up.  Let them know you
are proud of them and trust their judgement, so they should too.  If
something seems wrong to them with what the gang might be up to, then
tell them it is better to go with their instincts then over the bridge
with the rest of the gang.

Morals/principles/values - this is the time to reinforce them, in my
opinion.  :-)

I have written a book about this topic.  It's called Managing Middle
School Madness - Helping Parents and Teachers Understand the Wonder
Years(Available on Amazon.com) I have been looking around for
different parent ideas.  I'll add my own every day, starting with the
first chapter.  The book is just a collection of tip that I am more
than willing to share to get some discussion!

Chapter 1 - Dealing with the School
Tip # 1 - Above all, see yourself in a partnership with the school.
The following poem does a great job demonstrating the importance of
unity in the parent/school relationship:
Unity
By Ray A. Lingenfelter
I dreamed I stood in a studio
And watched two sculptors there.
The clay they used was a young child's mind
And they fashioned it with care.

One was a teacher -- the tools he used
Were books, music, and art.
The other, a parent, worked with a guiding hand,
And a gentle, loving heart.
Day after day, the teacher toiled with touch
That was careful, deft, and sure.
While the parent labored by his side
And polished and smoothed it o'er.

And when, at last, their task was done,
They were proud of what they had wrought.
For the things they had molded into the child
Could neither be sold or bought.

And each agreed they would have failed
If each had worked alone.
For behind the parent stood the school
And behind the teacher, the home.

Chapter 2 - Dealing with the Teacher
Chapter 3 - Dealing with other kids
Chapter 4 - What the Parent Can Do
Chapter 5 - Parents Helping Parents

There cannot be unity when the values of the parents and the school
differ too much.
Consider the following case from Lexington, Massachusetts, taken from

http://www.massresistance.org/docs/parker/montalvo.html

Family left Lexington school system over homosexuality in David
Parker's elementary school.
Another Estabrook Elementary School family's problems with the
homosexual agenda in school caused them to leave the school -- and the
town of Lexington in February, 2005.

The following speech was delivered by Gerry Wambolt at the David
Parker Rally on the Lexington Battle Green on September 6, 2005.

Hello. I'm Gerry Wambolt, a Lexington resident and parent. My family
and I have had personal struggles within the Lexington public schools
over parental rights and having our beliefs and views respected, but
today I would like to tell you about another family's struggles at
Lexington's Estabrook Elementary school. The Montalvo family could not
be present, so I'll tell you about a series of events which occurred
to them here in our community. Ultimately, this family found it
necessary to remove their children from the Lexington public schools,
and to move out of Lexington altogether, since their parental rights
and their values were not respected, and were in fact, attacked and
completely discounted.

In August 2004, the Montalvos moved to Lexington with very high
expectations for their children's education at Estabrook Elementary
school. They'd heard so many good things about the Lexington public
school system - as with so many of us this was a major reason they
chose to move to Lexington.

A few months into the school year their second grade son began a lunch
room discussion with other students about whether a man could marry
another man. As children will do, they began enthusiastically debating
the question. Soon a teacher and teacher's aide were asked for input.
The answer the adults gave was simply that two men could marry in this
state, and so those children who said a man could marry another man
were completely in the right. The children were not told that
Massachusetts is the only state in the nation where gay marriage is
legal. The children were not told that this is only the legal side of
the question, and that there may be other opinions on the topic that
may also be important. Instead, the teachers chose to validate one
belief system and to dismiss any other. The Montalvos feel the answer
the teachers gave to their child was not the whole truth. It was
completely biased towards one particular belief system. Since their
child held to another belief system, his own personal beliefs were
dismissed. Aren't our teachers supposed to be concerned for the
feelings and self-esteem of all of our children? Or is presenting
their side of an important social issue more important?

When the Montalvos heard about this incident, they told their
principal and the director of education that they were not satisfied
with how their child was treated. They also e-mailed the Lexington
school superintendent. He never responded to them.

The Montalvos began to worry about the way in which their children's
teachers were instructing their children about personal and social
issues which related to their personal values and beliefs.

A few months later they became aware of the diversity book directed at
kindergarten children that depicts gay-headed households. The father
told the schools he ABSOLUTELY did not want books normalizing gay-
headed relationships coming home with their kindergarten child. The
parents told the school they wanted to opt-out of the diversity book
bag, which the schools EXPRESSLY told them they could do. Furthermore,
the parents requested that the principal please respect their values
and morals and remove their children from any material or discussion,
whether oral or written, in the classroom pertaining to such subjects.
The book bag was sent home with their kindergarten son anyway, even
though the parents made these requests in writing to the Estabrook
principal.

Further discussions with the principal revealed that all children at
Estabrook have access to books about lesbian and gay-headed
relationships in each and every classroom, and that any teacher or
adult can read these books to children any time they wish, with no
thought of notifying their parents.

Instead of respecting the Montalvos values and beliefs, the principal
seemed to think the problem was the Montalvos, and suggested the
parents attend a workshop entitled, &quot;How and why to talk with your
children about diversity&quot; which was held at Diamond Middle School on
February 8th. It was advertised as an interactive workshop for
teachers and parents sponsored by the Estabrook anti-bias committee.
The workshop leader was a workshop leader trained by GLSEN, which
stands for Gay, Lesbian, Straight, Education Network. He didn't speak
about broad diversity. He didn't speak about respecting diverse
values. Instead he spoke about how to teach children to accept
homosexuality. His presentation included three suggestions for each
and every elementary classroom: 1) posters depicting homosexual
families on the walls, 2) more books to increase children's exposure
to homosexuality, and 3) teacher initiated discussions to guide
children in accepting homosexuality. Any reasonable person can only
conclude the school-sponsored workshop should have been named, &quot;How to
convince your children and students to accept homosexuality.&quot; Many of
the teachers and parents at this meeting were in favor of teaching
acceptance and normalization of homosexuality. When Mr. Montalvo
discussed his belief system and his legal rights to shield his own
children from these materials and discussions in the public schools, a
parent told him to leave and to place his children in a private or
religious school. One of the Estabrook staff members had to physically
restrain this parent as she was apparently preparing to physically
attack him - so much for tolerance and safety in the public schools!

The Montalvos were angry, frustrated and confused at how the Lexington
public schools feel they can make these decisions for parents,
regardless of their feelings. The Montalvos felt they had no choice
but to move out of Lexington in the middle of the school year. The
principal of their new school told them they have every right as
parents to make these decisions for their children, and that at this
new school, the teachers are too busy teaching academics and
traditional extra-curricular activities to teach about divisive social
issues.

The Montalvos were forced to conclude that Estabrook was not a safe
place to leave their children. Estabrook teachers and administrators
disregarded the views and beliefs of their students' parents and did
not respect parental rights. These education professionals have
forgotten that these children are only in their temporary care, and
that their parents come from different backgrounds and ways of life
which also must be respected.

The school administration feels they have the latitude to unilaterally
determine what is appropriate for your own children even against the
expressed wishes of the parents. They do not. The school
administration feels they have to right to dismiss and to attack views
and beliefs which they feel are unpopular or not the mainstream in
Lexington. They do not.

The school administration will continue to operate with happy
disregard for our wishes, and in blatant violation our parental
rights, until we let them know this is not acceptable, and that we
will not sit down and take it.

Please join us in letting your children's teachers and principals and
administrators know we take parental rights seriously. Please join us
in making Lexington public schools a place of respect and safety for
EVERYONE, and not just those with certain political views. Thank you.

Sorry everyone - I really don't care if you buy my book.  I was
planning on putting it on these pages.  I have never done a group
before and I didn't realize that it was a bad thing to do.  I will
never mention the book again unless asked.  I seriously want to get
input from other parents about what I have written.  I am just a
teacher and parent from Duluth, Minnesota - not a salesperson...

Again - Sorry.

The other thing that I thought of was along the lines of getting good sleep
like Vickie suggested, but to also make sure the kids eat a good breakfast.
I know many kids think they cannot eat in the  morning, but they can if they
tried. It helps their brains function and not get so sleepy during the day.
Also, I know many schools don't allow it, but if I could change one thing
with the school systems, it would be to allow the kids water bottles during
the day. Kids get dehydrated and then they get sleepy. They don't listen
well. If they could keep hydrated and had snacks throughout the day, it
would help the kids learn better.

&gt; This really turned me off to the book.  Is the whole book like this?
&gt;&gt; Unity
&gt;&gt; By Ray A. Lingenfelter
&gt;&gt; I dreamed I stood in a studio
&gt;&gt; And watched two sculptors there.
&gt;&gt; The clay they used was a young child's mind
&gt;&gt; And they fashioned it with care.

&gt;&gt; One was a teacher -- the tools he used
&gt;&gt; Were books, music, and art.
&gt;&gt; The other, a parent, worked with a guiding hand,
&gt;&gt; And a gentle, loving heart.
&gt;&gt; Day after day, the teacher toiled with touch
&gt;&gt; That was careful, deft, and sure.
&gt;&gt; While the parent labored by his side
&gt;&gt; And polished and smoothed it o'er.

&gt;&gt; And when, at last, their task was done,
&gt;&gt; They were proud of what they had wrought.
&gt;&gt; For the things they had molded into the child
&gt;&gt; Could neither be sold or bought.

&gt;&gt; And each agreed they would have failed
&gt;&gt; If each had worked alone.
&gt;&gt; For behind the parent stood the school
&gt;&gt; And behind the teacher, the home.

It would also help if schools started at 10:00 in the morning rather
than 8:00 and go two hours later, to coincide better with the kids' body
clocks. Some schools complain about there isn't enough daylight left for
sports in the PM, but they can have the athletes get up early and enjoy
the morning daylight. Or get lights for the fields.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Make sure they get enough sleep. Kids this age can stay up half the night
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; then sleep 'til past noon.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I have written a book about this topic.  It's called Managing Middle

&gt; &gt; &gt;Years(Available on Amazon.com) I have been looking around for

It's standard practice round here for children to have a water bottle to

&gt; The other thing to do is make sure they're reading a lot over the

Also, find out what kind of notebooks, binders, etc., the kids need. At
the end of July through the beginning of September, RiteAid, Walgreens,
Target, Staples, OfficeMax, etc., will be having sale on school
supplies. You can get a box of 12 crayons for like 10 cents, 100 sheets
of paper for 50 cents, binders, marble notebooks, etc., real cheap,
especially compared to the prices that they charge after the sales.

Watch the flyers for the stuff that you need.

This is also good for the stuff that you need for your house (e.g., a
marble notebook to track your expennses or binders to hold your tax info).

However, make sure the teacher doesn't insist on a certain brand... We
had a teacher here (german school system) who wanted those crayon
_blocks_ not the pens (because they're just so much better! And look how
they can use them to also build stuff. HAH). Yeah, 18 Euros later..... I
was not impressed.

One's school must allow it, as I 've seen kids with them.  I'm not
sure why its necessary or even desirable, OTOH.  Kids get drinks at
lunchtime, and have access to water fountains at other times if
they're thirsty.  Is hydration really that big an issue where you
live?

(We DO send water bottles to camp, BTW, since the kids are enaging in
physical activities all day, and not always close to a water
fountain.)

Only the newest elementary schools in our district (in suburban Philly)  are

&gt; One's school must allow it, as I 've seen kids with them.  I'm not
&gt; sure why its necessary or even desirable, OTOH.  Kids get drinks at
&gt; lunchtime, and have access to water fountains at other times if
&gt; they're thirsty.  Is hydration really that big an issue where you

Yes, I think it is important.  Adults and kids don't realize that by
the time they are thirsty they are already dehydrated.

I am fairly lenient with my kids consumption of things.  But not with
soda.  At lunch time kids usually have juice or soda.  Juice I am ok
with - soda no way.  If they have a bottle of water with them through
out the day, I don't think they will drink as much of the other stuff.

Your point?  No one needs the extra sugar (juice).

And I don't even want to get into what is in the soda.  (But I will a
little:-)
The caffeine for one and the carbonation combines with the sugar -
holy majoli - I don't want to think of the dentist bills!  The
quickest way to loose your teeth - drink soda.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In 4th and 5th at our elementary they let the kids keep water bottles

I certainly hope most adults don't think so, since its completely
untrue!  See, eg,
http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/20020711213420data_trunc_sys.shtml

As I said, I don't care if the kids have a water bottle, and One often
does.  But the whole hydration myth -- the need to have a bottle of
water at all times -- does drive me a bit batty.  I've no idea why it
drives me battier than other things, though; as myths go, I'll concede
that its a relatively harmless one.  ;-p

We allow a limited amount of soda.  We treat it like any other junk
food.  But I assure you, having a readily accessible bottle of water
isn't going to make my son turn down a cup of Coca Cola!

Water is the usual drink at One's school, BTW.  No soda is available

Ok - wasn't sure he meant an emphasis on the sugar part or the water

Even people with fairly strong teeth can have problems with tooth
decay due to soda.  But - lucky you!

Not up on the whole no sugar or caffeine free stuff.  But I tend to be
wary considering when I was pregnant my OBGYN said if you *HAVE* to
drink soda - stay away from the diet/caffeine free stuff.  So there
are probably some *yikes* things in there also.

Thank you thank you thank you - I couldn't find that.

When I tried to follow the drink-always and 8 oz. eight times business regarding
water, all I got was a whole lot of clear urine, and frequently.  And an awful
bloated feel and a gag reflex that started rebelling.  I decided I must be part
desert rat, and my kid must take after the desert rat side of the family  ;-),
and now after years we find out the truth and that silliness is starting (just
starting...) to Go Away.

It's one of those self-reinforcing pseudo-scientific trusisms that have get
circulated and re-circulated (and never passed out of the system soon enough
;-).

If thirst were an inadequate indicator of dehydration state, we'd be one
non-existant species.  If anything, it would be TOO sensitive (like our
famine-guarding hunger urges).

It drives ME batty  because:

1. It's touted as the cure-all for everything from jet lag to aging.  And often.
And I have to frequently flip on my anti-eye-rolling-reflex-inhibitor in order
to get along with people  ;-)

2. I get other parents and teachers going &quot;where's his water where's his water&quot;
and then spouting the myth that I know I'll never be able to dissuade them from.

3. You get folks thinking all their good manners about not lugging drinks around
every venue and drinking in front of whomever wherever 'has to' exempt water
because of this supposed biological urgency.

Next myth to go:  (I'd better run and hide after this one) - that not a single
square inch of skin shall be ever ever exposed to more than an incidental minute
of sunlight and the slightest tan color is a sure sign of Permanent Skin Damage
and Incipient CANCER.  (Yeah, I'm gonna hear a hue and cry over that one...)

Yep - nothing wrong with soda, even the sugary caffeiny-stuff - as a treat.  As

&gt; I certainly hope most adults don't think so, since its completely

&gt; As I said, I don't care if the kids have a water bottle, and One often

&gt; drives me battier than other things, though; as myths go, I'll concede
&gt; that its a relatively harmless one.  ;-p

&gt; &gt; I am fairly lenient with my kids consumption of things.  But not with
&gt; &gt; soda.  At lunch time kids usually have juice or soda.  Juice I am ok
&gt; &gt; with - soda no way.  If they have a bottle of water with them through
&gt; &gt; out the day, I don't think they will drink as much of the other stuff.

&gt; We allow a limited amount of soda.  We treat it like any other junk
&gt; food.  But I assure you, having a readily accessible bottle of water
&gt; isn't going to make my son turn down a cup of Coca Cola!

&gt; Water is the usual drink at One's school, BTW.  No soda is available
&gt; at lunch time.  On dairy days (3x/week), they serve milk or water; on
&gt; meat days, its juice or water (kosher school, milk not permitted with
&gt; meat).

Interesting.

The thing is, I highly doubt all kids are consuming 8 glasses of water
a day.  Some probably none.  The pros out way the cons in this case,
in my opinion.

Regulates body temperature
provides lube for joints
helps blood flow
regulates blood pressure
keeps body system functioning properly
keeps skin elastic
necessary in digestion and the removal of toxins

If people do not drink enough water on a semi-daily basis they have a
diminished ability to feel thirst.  That is when the dehydration can
set in.  I am not advocating drinking 8 glasses daily, just some and
do be able to have it when wanted/needed.  And if the middle-schoolers
are at school running hard at recess and studying during class-time,
by lunch they probably will grab whatever they can get and the choice
would probably be juice or soda if they haven't had anything to drink
all day.

But you say your kids would reach for that no matter how much water
they consume.  So this then doesn't pertain to you.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Your point?  No one needs the extra sugar (juice).

&gt; &gt;&gt; Um, I think that *is* the point.  It's a very common path to obesity and
&gt; &gt;&gt; associated problems.  Hydration having to be tied to a bunch of unecessary
&gt; &gt;&gt; rapidly-metabolized calories several times a day.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;And I don't even want to get into what is in the soda.  (But I will a

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;holy majoli - I don't want to think of the dentist bills!  The
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;quickest way to loose your teeth - drink soda.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Well, there's caffiene-free (and sugar-free for that matter).  Carbonation tooth
&gt; &gt;&gt;enamel and all that - depends greatly on the person (not an issue in my family,
&gt; &gt;&gt; the one place we did win the genetic lottery is in our teeth).

&gt; &gt;&gt; The thing is - why get everyone all spoiled on sweet and flavors with their
&gt; &gt;&gt;several-times-a-day hydration to begin with,  when good ol' water does the trick
&gt; &gt;&gt; without all the extra health-impacting baggage??

&gt; the end of July through the beginning of September, RiteAid, Walgreens,

&gt; Watch the flyers for the stuff that you need.

Orientation/Open house
Make a real effort to attend the orientation/open house with your
child. The school will probably go over lots of things that may not
seem like a big deal to you but are very scary to a child entering a
new school.
As a teacher of this age, I can't tell you how many times I have had
to console a young student because they couldn't get their locker open
and they were going to be late for class. They usually were not afraid
of the teacher because most will cut students a lot of slack the first
couple of weeks. They were afraid of entering a class late and having
all the other students looking at them. Make sure your child knows:

Their hourly schedule
Where their teachers' rooms are located
Their bus # and location at the end of the day
Where their lockers (regular and gym) are and how to work the
combination locks
Where the bathrooms are
Where the office is
A teacher they can go to for questions (usually their advisor in a
middle school)

&gt;Thank you thank you thank you - I couldn't find that.

&gt;When I tried to follow the drink-always and 8 oz. eight times business regarding

When my children were in school, they were not allowed to bring water
or anything to consume in the classroom and neither was the teacher
allowed to have anything.  And when *I* was in school, we were not
allowed to have a drink when we came in from recess because we might -
I don't know - colic or something.  We might be able to sneak a sip as
we went by, but if we tried anything else we were yelled at.  It
sounds like the pendulum has swung.

My problem is that when I feel thirsty there often is not place that I
can find water to drink.  I am frequently thirsty when driving, and I
don't want to stop and get a soft drink.  So I take water with me when
I am out and about.  (No problem at home of course).   I don't always
want it, but I like to have it if I do feel thirsty.

&gt;Next myth to go:  (I'd better run and hide after this one) - that not a single
&gt;square inch of skin shall be ever ever exposed to more than an incidental minute
&gt;of sunlight and the slightest tan color is a sure sign of Permanent Skin Damage
&gt;and Incipient CANCER.  (Yeah, I'm gonna hear a hue and cry over that one...)
">

As far as tan color - my skin is so fair (almost transparent) that a
tan color on me is like some people's normal un-tanned skin tone.   DH
has the kind of skin that just gets controlled red and never tans. And
two of my dd's have the same type skin.

I've had two melanomas removed, and dh has had a big one removed from
his forearm and a skin graft.  One of my daughters has also some
incipient stage one.  So while the hue and cry may be excessive, it is
probably better than letting kids get broiled several times a summer
as dh did.

My mom was very careful with us - we did not go out in the sun without
protection.  My skin damage (of which I have some) came from teaching
swimming on the side of a pool in Florida in the summer in a bathing
suit (after that happened, I wore long trousers and a T-shirt over my
bathing suit plus a big brimmed hat), and from a camping trip to the
OBX as a teenager where I got a sunburn on top of a peeling burn on my
shoulders.  That's not where my melanomas were however.  One is on my
shin and one is in the middle of my back.

In spite of all the lectures, my dd#2 who lives in FL is tan.  And so
are her kids.  Actually my arms are tan from the elbow down, and I can
see the damage to the skin on my hands although I've not gotten burned
in ages.

Middle school has traditionally been grades 6 to 8.

If it is 7th grade, then it is usually considered Junior High school.

I don't know why they are starting in grade 5 now.  I would not
consider that to be middle school, although we do have elementary
schools that have a lower (K-2) and upper (3-5) section.

I never based anything I said on 8 glasses of water.  Whoever those
scientists are need their head examined.  There is a reason - soda
does not satisfy thirst.  It has far more sodium in it.  And kids get
plenty of sodium in processed foods.  No you won't die from lack of
hydration, but it is not nearly as hydrating as a glass of water.

Hence, you tend to drink more soda - which leads to consuming the
*other* reasons not to drink it.

breathed out, just like the carbon dioxide that is made by cells in the
body. And if it is not breathed, it will be burped out or farted out.
Kids are good at that, too.

Not anymore.  I think that there is a &quot;middle school&quot;
concept now (the details of which I'm not entirely sure of).
At any rate, it has to do with how to organize, how to support
kids in those years, how to effectively educate them, etc.
Many schools that were formerly jr. high school are now calling
themselves &quot;middle schools&quot; after changing their philosophy
without changing what grades are involved.
So, while I think it *was* accurate to say that
middle schools were typically grades 6-8, now that's less
true and many middle schools are assorted combinations of
grades 5-9.  Ours is grades 7 and 8 (and used to be a jr.
high, but is now a middle school).  I think when they include
grade 5, it is often a facilities issue more than it is an
issue of what is thought to be most educationally appropriate.

Best wishes,
Ericka

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I think it is important.  Adults and kids don't realize that by

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I am fairly lenient with my kids consumption of things.  But not with

&gt; &gt; Your point?  No one needs the extra sugar (juice).

&gt; &gt; And I don't even want to get into what is in the soda.  (But I will a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, I know many schools don't allow it, but if I could change one thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the school systems, it would be to allow the kids water bottles

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the day. Kids get dehydrated and then they get sleepy. They don't listen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; well. If they could keep hydrated and had snacks throughout the day, it

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Deja mentioned the sleep thing, not I.:-)   It is important.  True too
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about breakfast.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In 4th and 5th at our elementary they let the kids keep water bottles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on their desks.  I think it is a great idea.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's standard practice round here for children to have a water bottle to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take round school with them. At #1's school the hm is very keen for them all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to have them. The government provides them with a fruit snack at break time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; One's school must allow it, as I 've seen kids with them.  I'm not
&gt;&gt;&gt; sure why its necessary or even desirable, OTOH.  Kids get drinks at
&gt;&gt;&gt; lunchtime, and have access to water fountains at other times if
&gt;&gt;&gt; they're thirsty.  Is hydration really that big an issue where you
&gt;&gt;&gt; live?
&gt;&gt;&gt; (We DO send water bottles to camp, BTW, since the kids are enaging in
&gt;&gt;&gt; physical activities all day, and not always close to a water
&gt;&gt;&gt; fountain.)

&gt; I certainly hope most adults don't think so, since its completely
&gt; untrue!  See, eg,

Not needing 8 glasses of water 8 times a day is not the same thing as
saying dehydration is a myth. The fact is that people do get dehydrated
when they are active, even before they know they are thirsty. Kids
especially.

It is best to drink before activity, like sports practice, setting off
on a hike or bike ride, and keep drinking until afterwards. Kids who are
in sports camps will often get dehydrated over a few days and not
realize it.

&gt;&gt; As I said, I don't care if the kids have a water bottle, and One often
&gt;&gt; does.  But the whole hydration myth -- the need to have a bottle of
&gt;&gt; water at all times -- does drive me a bit batty.  I've no idea why it
&gt;&gt; drives me battier than other things, though; as myths go, I'll concede
&gt;&gt; that its a relatively harmless one.  ;-p

&gt;&gt;&gt; I am fairly lenient with my kids consumption of things.  But not with
&gt;&gt;&gt; soda.  At lunch time kids usually have juice or soda.  Juice I am ok
&gt;&gt;&gt; with - soda no way.  If they have a bottle of water with them through
&gt;&gt;&gt; out the day, I don't think they will drink as much of the other stuff.
&gt;&gt; We allow a limited amount of soda.  We treat it like any other junk
&gt;&gt; food.  But I assure you, having a readily accessible bottle of water
&gt;&gt; isn't going to make my son turn down a cup of Coca Cola!

&gt;&gt; Water is the usual drink at One's school, BTW.  No soda is available
&gt;&gt; at lunch time.  On dairy days (3x/week), they serve milk or water; on
&gt;&gt; meat days, its juice or water (kosher school, milk not permitted with
&gt;&gt; meat).

&gt;&gt; Barbara- Hide quoted text -

&gt; Interesting.

&gt; The thing is, I highly doubt all kids are consuming 8 glasses of water
&gt; a day.  Some probably none.  The pros out way the cons in this case,
&gt; in my opinion.

Not true. It lets the body sweat, if needed, more, but that's not the
same thing as saying water regulates the body temp.

Not true. Kidneys, adrenal, heart, brain, etc., do this.

Which means?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well, true, but that doesn't mean extra water helps.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If people do not drink enough water on a semi-daily basis they have a
&gt; diminished ability to feel thirst.  That is when the dehydration can
&gt; set in.  I am not advocating drinking 8 glasses daily, just some and
&gt; do be able to have it when wanted/needed.  And if the middle-schoolers
&gt; are at school running hard at recess and studying during class-time,
&gt; by lunch they probably will grab whatever they can get and the choice
&gt; would probably be juice or soda if they haven't had anything to drink
&gt; all day.

&gt; But you say your kids would reach for that no matter how much water
&gt; they consume.  So this then doesn't pertain to you.

I agree. They should have access to water. The best way to determine
that they are drinking enough is that their urine is not too concentrated.

&gt; &gt; Orientation/Open house
&gt; &gt; Make a real effort to attend the orientation/open house with your
&gt; &gt; child. The school will probably go over lots of things that may not
&gt; &gt; seem like a big deal to you but are very scary to a child entering a
&gt; &gt; new school.
&gt; &gt; As a teacher of this age, I can't tell you how many times I have had
&gt; &gt; to console a young student because they couldn't get their locker open
&gt; &gt; and they were going to be late for class. They usually were not afraid
&gt; &gt; of the teacher because most will cut students a lot of slack the first
&gt; &gt; couple of weeks. They were afraid of entering a class late and having
&gt; &gt; all the other students looking at them. Make sure your child knows:

&gt; &gt; Their hourly schedule
&gt; &gt; Where their teachers' rooms are located
&gt; &gt; Their bus # and location at the end of the day
&gt; &gt; Where their lockers (regular and gym) are and how to work the
&gt; &gt; combination locks
&gt; &gt; Where the bathrooms are
&gt; &gt; Where the office is
&gt; &gt; A teacher they can go to for questions (usually their advisor in a
&gt; &gt; middle school)

&gt; &gt; Glen

&gt; What ages do you consider &quot;middle school&quot;? It varies from district to
&gt; district.
&gt; My niece, whose &quot;middle school&quot; starts in 5th grade, would probably have
&gt; benefitted from your above tips, but my sons entering MS in 7th grade would
&gt; have been mortified had I held their hands like that - and that was in a
&gt; school of 1200+ kids.- Hide quoted text -

Usually,it starts in 6th grade - it also depends on the child - some
REALLY need it while others can go with the flow.
