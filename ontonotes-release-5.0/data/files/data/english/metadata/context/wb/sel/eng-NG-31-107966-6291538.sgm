Hi there.

I cannot believe there are no more threads about this, I thought many
other people would have this problem, yet.. well whadaya know.

Anyway, for the last year or so my climbing skills deteriorated quite
badly because of one small thing - my damn toenail. On the left big
toe, to be precise. It seems the nail started "pushing to the sides"
more and more and while this doesn't bother me at least when I walk
around in normal shoes, putting on climbing shoes means a world of
hurt. Trying to push up with my toe is now a heroic feat accompanied
with an inevitable scream and cursing. Not once did I fall just because
I couldn't stand the pain anymore, it's like a blade cutting into your
toe and squirming around.

One friend said a pedicure helps. I went, it didn't do squat (ok well
the lady made my other nails look pretty and polished). I went to the
doctor, and she gave me an antiseptic solution in which I should soak
my feet daily. Again, tremendous help from this - one month later, the
nail is still cutting in, climbing still hurts like hell and I am
really getting angry.

I asked the doctor should I remove the nail, she said if I did that it
would mean no climbing for me for at least six months, and that my case
is too mild for a "major" surgery. In the mean time, the situation is
getting worse, now it hurts even when I try to climb in my training
shoes and boy am I starting to consider pulling the damn nail out by
myself, hurt as it might.

Anyway, did ANYONE had experience with this and how the hell did you
solve this? I think I've read somewhere on this group that some people
have removed part of the nail and killed the root - can someone tell me
how long does this take to heal?

This is nonsense. Make sure you get advice from a chiropodist not an
ordianry doctor or surgeon. I had a similar problem and I was refered to
a chiropodist (here in the UK). They recommended removing the sides of
my big toes by around 4mm on both edges. ( I still have these bits in a
jar at home!)

The procedure is to use a local anasthetic on the toe, a bit like a
dentist would use - means you can watch the action!!!

They then use a kind of blunt screwdriver to release the nail from the
nailbed and clippers to cut away the right amount of nail.

Crucially they DO NOT cut into the nail root with anything - what they
do is apply some kind of acid (I cant remember what this is called) for
a precise amount of time - around a minute or two, to 'kill' the nail
root. This stops the nail re-growing. It's only a tiny area as well, the
bit where the nail grows, not the whole length of the nail.

I was virtually pain free afterwards and could walk about with no
problem and drive myself home. The only issue is the site where they
apply the acid stuff weeps for a few days so you have to change the
dressing and keep it clean - but it doesn't 'hurt' too much at all.

I immediately felt the absence of low-level nail pain and was climbing
again in about a week or two.

The difference was amazing  - previously I was in a lot of pain in my
toes, especially on multi-pitch, now there is just the 'normal' soreness
from time to time and no real issues with big toenails.

The chiropodist related horror stories of how 'ordinary' surgeons even
now still insisiting on cutting the nail root away with scalpels to
prevent re-growth - with this technique I believe the recuperation time
is measured in months and is very painfull afterwards.

One of the four sides did start growing again after about 6 months and I
had to get one side done again.

Nails are funny trhings though apparently - one big toe now has a nice
flat toe-nail - the other has started to get ingrown again, so I might
get it removed completely in the future.

I had increasing nail problems over the years though nothing as bad as
you relate. My partner Burl also suffered various toe maladies.

So discussing our plight one night he said 2 things really helped him (
he had that spreading nail thing too):

let the nails grow longer so the entire nail is extended past the end
of the nail bed, all the way across.

AND

he used clippers and a knife to split the nail down the center for
maybe a centimeter

He said these two simple things solved most of his nail problems
permanently.

Now I don't have the spreading thing going on but was getting to the
point where I had frequent ingrown nails which I would dig out with
some degree of discomfort. I always kept my toenails short to prevent
them from cutting my toes when wearing climbing shoes all day. It
seemed counter-intuitive to me, to let the nails grow longer.

But I tried it.

World O difference for me. No more ingrown toenails, not even possible
now. I don't trim them back far enough for it to happen.

Hiking downhill for any length of time uised to wreck my toes, no more.
I don't get the nail-cut or squash in climbing shoes either. Whoda
thunk it?

Just some anecdotal evidence my good man. I wish your toe all the
best,. It sucks to get side lined by a Little Piggy.

Who needs toenails anyway?  I keep knocking mine off by hitting them
into the end of my climbing shoes or hiking boots.  Like you, it hurts
like hell.  But then they fall off and after that I'm ok.  I just tape
them up until they fall off.  Hell, it takes a year to go through this
whole process of knocking them off and growing them back on.  So, I'd
say just cut them things off there and tape them up.

good luck

Thanks, man, this is the answer I wanted to hear.

Having side of my nail removed and acid pured onto it seems like a
terrific solution (one sentence I thought I'd never write :) ). A week
or two healing process - also terrific, I would hate to lose an entire
climbing season because of a toenail bit.

The only trouble now is finding the right doctor (or chiropodist) who
could do that. Everyone I talked to until now only offered pulling the
nail out which would result in an open wound and at least six weeks of
healing process.  Well, I guess I should search around a little more,
at least now I'll know what to ask about more precisely. Btw, is there
more information about this on the web?

Anyway, thanks and cheers!

I had this done and it wasn't even a two-week healing process. It was
relatively painless. Now I have no more ingrown nails! Don't hesitate to
have it done.

Also, run, don't walk from the doctor that said that removing the nail
will stop your climbing for six months. I don't recommend removing the
nail if it's not necessary, but not having a nail is no big deal.
Because of a nail fungus I lose big toenails easily. One day of bashing
the front of my ski boots will do it. I have no big toenails right now.
I don't climb any worse than I ever did!

This is getting strange! I too had toenail fungus - in fact I had to get
this cleared up before they'd treat the ingrowing bits.

I'd had it for years and years with both big toes loosing attatchment to
the nail bed. The nails themselves were horribly thick and it was this
that was also causing some pain.

The tratment was around 6 months or so with 'Lamisil' in tablet form
which kills the nasty fungus living in the actual root. These bugs
cannnot be reached by ordinary external treatments. My doctor insisted
on having a sample of toenail tested to see if it was infected before
he'd prescrible the course of treatment - I think it's quite expensive.

All of my nails after the treatment looked much better and even started
regrowing properly. A lot of my mates I climb with I've noticed have the
same condition but seem reluctant to have it treated properly. The
fungus has reappeared once, so I had to have a second course of
treatment.

My doctor talked me out of it. Something about it not always being
effective and liver toxicity of the treatment. His opinion was that the
cure was worse than the disease. It doesn't really bother me much, other
than being unattractive, so I haven't gone for it.

I'm not sure about that last point, but such treatments are also
expensive... and may not work. Two alternatives:

1. &lt;cluedo&gt;In the bathroom, with the snub-nosed pliers&lt;/cluedo&gt;.
Not cool, but potentially entertaining for onlookers. (The new nail is very
nice, thanks).

2. Tea tree (melaleuca alternifolia) oil (active ingredient terpinen-4-ol).
Probably less cool. Certainly less entertaining.

This is an old wives tale and cutting the 'v' makes no significant change to
the side pressure.  If anything its more likely to cause damage to the nail
bed if you cut too far down or do it too often.  The process may seem to
help, but it is more likely that simply paying more attention to the
condition of the toe is the beneficial factor.

Yes, the treatment is bad for the liver.

Also, the problem is that once the fungus cracks your
genetic code, your immune system stops fighting it. When
that happens, treatment is usually ineffective or only
temporary. It's a PITA.

The most effective permanent treatment is supposed to be
just removing the toenail root as discussed elsewhere in
this thread.

My wife owns a spa, and often deals with these sorts of issues.  She agrees
completely with the problems associated with Lamisil, but recomends a
topical treatment called Vite 20.  It is applied twice a day, until the
fungus clears.  Of course, reoccurances can still happen.

She also recomends a natural remedy; oil of oregano is supposed to be great.
You take it orally as well as topically.  Great for funguses, and as a
general immune system booster.  Consult your local health-food store.

I've had a fungoid big toenail for some years now, and have tried every
supposed topical cure that I could find. Some worked a little, but only
temporarily.  Some didn't do anything.   I've now started taking
Lamasil, and the nail is definitely improving.

Your insurance company won't want to pay for it, as it's really
expensive (the receipt my pharmacy gave me showed something like $400
for a 30 day).  My doc had to wrestle with HealthNot... er... Net for
six months over it.  I had two liver function tests.  They finally
approved it, but it was a pain getting there.

Dingus,.

When my second toenails start to get long; they get very sharp corners on
the edge next to my big toe. In climbing shoes this edge cuts into my big
toes and can be fairly painful. My toenails grow straight out as they start
to get long. My wife's nails curl right around and down her toes on their
own. She can let here's get very long. I always thought this was the
difference.

Do your nails curl under or grow straight out?. Do I just need to put up
with the pain (if I can) till mine get really long? I'm thinking about this
cause I have had the beginnings of an ingrown toenail.

When I was  kid my father work as a camp doctor for a summer. Treatment may
be different today, but I watched him remove a couple of ingrown nails that
summer under local anesthetic. It was pretty painful for the patients.

I do wear socks in climbing shoes, and I do use bone cutters on my toenails.
I have not tried putting sock material between my toes because it would
bother me. Now having reflected on my own question for a day I think I can
answer it on my own. My toenails are very thick and very strong. No way they
're going to curl down in front of my toe if they were long. As a mater of
