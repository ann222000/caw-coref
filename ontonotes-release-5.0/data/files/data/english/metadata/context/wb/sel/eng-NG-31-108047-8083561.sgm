I think a good magic system would be one that claimed the inhernet power
of a true iconic commericial slogan made for the best incantations. Here
are come useful spells:

&quot;Plop plop fizz fizz&quot; gives instant relief from headache, indigestion,
and hangover, plus 1d6 of hit points restoration.

&quot;Calgon, take me away!&quot; teleports you out of any annoying or dangerous
situation, to a prepared location which allows and encourages complete
relaxation and healing.

&quot;Take it off, take it all off&quot; allows the mage to remove anything which
is getting in the way, such as clothes or a long scraggly beard.

&quot;I've fallen, and I can't get up!&quot; when directed at an opponent, causes
him to fall and have trouble getting up again.

&quot;How about a nice Hawaiian punch?&quot; does 1d8 damage.

&quot;Hey, Kool-Aid!&quot;

To this, you can add the magic potions.

Imperial Margarine confers royalty -- or at the very least, magically
creates crowns, which can be melted down and sold.

Ti-D-Bowl, when dropped into water, will summon a tiny helpful man in a
boat, who can carry messages or spy on one's enemies, provided you can
get him to stop singing.

Old Milwaukee Beer allows one to summon the Swedish Bikini Team.
Sadly, they arrive weaponless, but may make a good distraction.  And in
truly dire circumstances, they're food!

No, it calls Kool-Aid Man, who arrives (through a wall) to serve you
sugary beverages.  Handy for making holes in the nearest wall, for
distractions, and for hydration problems.

No good in deserts, unless you're near a wall...

Back when I was in high school, if you shouted &quot;Hey Kool-Aid&quot; and
rolled double-zeros on two D10s, that's exactlly what would happen.

The one time it worked, we were fighting evil skater-demons in a
frictionless ice rink.  Kool-Aid Man came crashing through the wall,
slipped on the &quot;ice&quot; and fell, spilling his sugary brains (and large
ice cubes) out.  The Kool-Aid froze, messing up the demons' skating
patterns and giving us enough traction to stand, and we were able to
fight our way out.

A while back I ran across some drawings of tiny Jello dragons
which were apparently tempting fate by prancing around the dessert table.
Very cute, though, and I admire the effort it's got to take to draw so
many complex shapes and then color and highlight them to look plausibly
gelatinous.

If the number of Elementals does keep up with the range of fresh
discovered and interesting chemical compounds, that means somewhere out
there would be such creatures as Bakelite, sucralose, and aspirin
elementals.  If they've switched over to just the actual elements, well,
think how gypped the francium and actinium elementals must feel.
