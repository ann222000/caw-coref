*SAVING THE CENTRAL AMERICA SQUIRREL MONKEY
**By Sue Waligora &lt;siouxwalig ... @yahoo.com&gt;*

*[image: sqrlmonkeys02]M*ost of us residing in Chiriqui are aware that we
share this land with monkeys. Some have been fortunate enough to see
cariblancas (white-faced capucchins) or mantled howlers in the wild. In the
case of howlers, they're most often heard long before they're seen.  But
there is another species of monkey that few Chiricanos are familiar with or
will ever have the opportunity to encounter: Saimiri oerstedii, the Central
American squirrel monkey.

These small, squirrel-sized primates can be recognized by their red-tinged
yellow fur, white face mask, black muzzle and black cap.  They are almost
exclusively tree-dwellers, often making spectacular jumps to get from one
tree to another rather than come down to the ground. They are extremely
active during the day, spending two-thirds to three-fourths of the day
foraging for food. Their typical diet consists of insects and small fruits.
Because the bulk of their day is spent in search of food, they are also very
illusive.

While squirrel monkeys are still relatively abundant and widespread in South
America, in Central America they have never been widespread and have been
restricted to the wet lowlands of Costa Rica and Panama since the earliest
historical records. There are two subspecies of Central American squirrel
monkeys: Saimiri oerstedii citrinellus, endemic to Costa Rica and Saimiri
oerstedii oerstedii, endemic to Panama.   More specifically, Chiriqui is the
only place in the entire world where you can find Saimiri oerstedii
oerstedii. Both species are highly threatened due to forest fragmentation
caused by agriculture and development as well as a thriving pet trade.

In fact, for more than a decade, wildlife biologists assumed that squirrel
monkeys were extinct in Panama as a result of massive deforestation.
However, in 1996, a small population of less than 25 individuals was
discovered in the Refugio De Vida Sylvestre La Barqueta. Since their
discovery, nothing else has been published regarding this or other possible
surviving populations.  Eight years later, in 2004, we discovered first-hand
that there was indeed a small population of squirrel monkeys living at the
Refuge.  Since then, we've endeavored to find other populations and learn
more about them in an attempt to save them from extinction.

While most published research focuses on the Costa Rican populations, we
know very little about our Panamanian populations.  Best estimates of
Saimiri oerstedii populations are based solely on habitat availability and
suggest that in all of Panama, less than 3,000 survive, making them the most
threatened monkey in Central America. So far, no conservation plan exists
for our Panamanian populations, and little research has been done, to date,
to form a basis for such a plan.  Despite their endangered status,
conservation efforts have been hampered for a number of reasons. One of the
lamentable features of squirrel monkey conservation efforts has been the
lack of detailed documentation of the surviving populations. The few surveys
reported thus far have either relied exclusively on interviews with local
inhabitants who have reported seeing them, or censuses focused on highly
restricted geographic areas.  While both methods do provide preliminary
analysis of species range in Panama, we need to employ methodologies that
provide more accurate information in order to make conservation possible.

Additionally, it has been argued that squirrel monkeys were probably
introduced into Central America  from South America by prehispanic Amerind
traders, diminishing the merit of conservation efforts.  After all, why
bother with an &quot;introduced&quot; species when many indigenous species are at
risk? Thanks to DNA testing, convincing evidence now exists that Saimiri
oerstedi was present in Central America prior to the arrival of humans and
is distinguished from the South American squirrel monkeys both on a genetic
level and social level.

Since the discovery of the Refugio troop of squirrel monkeys, more troops
are being discovered, most recently in Divala.  While most of Divala is
agricultural and largely devoid of contiguous forest, the monkeys seem to be
using treed areas around waterways as corridors for foraging.  Through the
use of satellite imagery and research speculating on the possibility of
other hypothetical populations, we hope to continue to find other troops.
Through a cooperative effort between CREA-Panama and SIT (School for
International Training) as part of a study abroad program, we currently have
a student, Sarah Seitel, studying the squirrel monkeys in Divala. She is
gathering valuable data regarding troop movements, diet, behavior, use of
particular tree species, etc., in order to give us a better understanding of
what these primates need to survive.

Concurrently, another student from the University of Chiriqui, Geminis
Vargas, has been studying a population of squirrel monkeys in San Carlos.
Can these individual, scattered populations somehow communicate and disperse
to provide enough genetic diversity for healthy populations? Are the monkeys
adapting to their restricted habitats with their limited food sources or are
we seeing them being edged closer to extinction?

We have much to learn before these questions can be answered. Long-term
research is necessary to monitor population trends and to focus on community
involvement with regard to conservation efforts. Our immediate goals are to
locate squirrel monkey troops in other fragmented forest areas and to
increase awareness in these local areas of the danger of extinction of these
unique primates; indeed, this is the first step.
