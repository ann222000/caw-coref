It was wonderful having everyone here. There just wasn't enough time to do
everything we would like to have done. Laura from St Clair Shores area came
on sunday and met others with Moebius for the first time. The articles
haven't come out in the news papers yet because they are interviewing Aubree
today. The Petoskey News Review is online if anyone wants to look it
up...the Charlevoix Courier I am not sure about. It was very sad when the
last of the guests left.... :-(

Take care.
Leslie

PS Vicki the guy from the Courier may be calling you for info..his name is
Benjamin...

Shortcake:

Will the News Review carry the article, or will it be the Courier? Please
let us know when the article's out.

Smiliecat and I toured Milwaukee a bit by car yesterday, picked up the
photos I took over the weekend (SC will be scanning some and sending them
out to you guys), then went to her cousin Doreen's house to visit and go
swimming.

SC's parents are coming over in about an hour. We'll talk a bit, then go
out to lunch. SC will whisk me to the airport shortly after lunch, as my
flight leaves at 2:50 pm.

I presume it's hot in Michigan; temps here have been pretty hot and humid.
Should feel right at home when I arrive in Houston! LOL

Hugs,

Kingfish and Smiliecat, aka Ro and Linda

It was a fun weekend for sure! I never knew why people were &quot;lake&quot;
people, but seeing how pretty Charlevoix is makes me understand why.
Such a picturesque area!
Yay! Thanks in advance for the pics - Linda. I really need to get a
camera. I hope any one else who gets a good shot will share theirs too!

Thanks again Leslie - and please tell Allan that he is a great host!
You guys planned a really fun vacation!
Can't wait to see y'all again soon!

There will be two seperate articles. The Petoskey News Review is online and
will be assessable to ya'll. The Courier is not online but I will see what I
can do. They are both owned by the same company but they do not share
info...or much else!! The pics used will only be of Aubree and myself due
to the need for signed releases. GEEESH getting back to work is so hard...I
wanna keep vacationing with ya'll!

UGH!! ad a good visit with mom last night. Roland I am sorry you didn't get
to see her and the home...next time maybe!!

Safe travels and sorry ya'll have to go back to the long distance thing!

Love ya'll

You guys sound like you had an awesome time in Charlevoix. Wish I
could have been there.
Maybe next time. I think living by the lakes would be beautiful -
especially seeing all the
boats out there. It's hot here but not as hot as usual since we've had
lots of rain. Now we
have the humidity too. I'm kind of getting a sense of what Ro's
weather might be like.
People must live there for the winters, right Ro? I mean Houston is
the 4th largest city
in the U.S. - something has to be attracting the people. I don't think
it's the summer weather though. Leslie, please let us all know when
that newspaper article comes out.
It sounds like you and Allan did an awesome job planning this get
together. It sounds
like you really made it fun. I have already requested the time off for
San Francisco. I am
looking forward to that. Just wanted to check in, have been busy with
a little project.
Nothing else new here. Take care everyone.

Hi Kevin - Sean had a great time playing volleyball with you, Ro and
Brian also! Taking him and a friend to dinner and a movie tonight -
he'll be 15 on Monday and will take his driver's permit test on Friday.
. . oh my. Scary to have a driving teen in the house! :)

Hi Vicki,
This summer has gone so incredibly fast!! Between moving, my two week
class, our Michigan gathering and Roland's visit, I can hardly believe it's
time to get ready for another school year. I am soooooo very not ready to
go back. I am trying desperately to convince myself that I can handle the
stress of holding down two jobs again. It should be easier this year since
I'm am living in the same house as my consumer. But whew, it seem undoable.
I'm sure I'll be fine, I just need to get into the proper mind set!!
Wish Sean a happy birthday for me. The teen driving thing sounds scary
to me too. Sometimes I'm glad I don't have kids.

Take care,
Love,
Linda aka
