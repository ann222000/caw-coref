A Shared Ceremony
Dedicated to All Young Lovers

Submitted by Colleen

The conch is blown announcing that something important is about to
happen. Strangers to the islands hear the sound but are unfamiliar
with the significance of what they hear. They are drawn to the sandy
shores by the sound even as they wonder why there is a crowd. That is
when, through a parting of the crowd, they see two people facing the
ocean. In front of them is a gentleman holding two leis over his arm
and in his hand is a book. At this point the strangers realize that
they have come upon a sunrise wedding ceremony. Only in Hawaii can you
witness the openness of such a ceremony, where anyone passing by is
welcome to share in the moment. As the visitors step closer they see
that the couple is not as young as they appeared from a distance. In
fact, the faces of this couple show the passing of many years. However
the love flowing between them is both young and old at the same time.
By quietly asking, the visitors discover that both the bride and groom
are in their 90's and the gathering crowd is all there to witness as
the couple renews their vows after 50 years of marriage.

Fifty years ago this couple embarked on a voyage that started from
this very same beach. Now they are back, inviting all their friends
and family to share as they recommit themselves to each other. The
visitors attempt to slip away without intruding further. Out of the
quiet they hear someone say 'wait'. Looking up they see that the bride
is holding out her hand to them - &quot;come closer&quot;. Trading suddenly shy
glances they step forward and are surprised when the woman leans in
and whispers &quot;shall we make this a double ceremony?&quot; They young couple
had never told each other how they felt. Tears come to their eyes,
their fingers touch, and they take a step closer. The pastor smiles
and begins the ceremony with &quot;we are gathered here to witness the love
and commitment between these two couples...&quot;

After the ceremony was over they young bride looked to the older bride
and was about to ask a question. Before the words left her mouth her
question was answered - &quot;we waited too long the first time and almost
lost each other&quot;. &quot;Love should never have to wait for just the right
moment&quot;.
