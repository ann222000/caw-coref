Not for anyone outside the USA. Most of the rest of the world writes
dates as day-month-year or year-month-day (possibly using different
separator characters and number of digits in each field).

To me, 11-4-7 looks like a serial number of some kind. If it was
11-4-2007 I'd at least recognise it was a date, but I wouldn't be able
to tell whether it meant 11th April or 4th November without some
context. Only days of the month after the 12th are unambiguous.

In contexts where the date might be ambiguous I prefer to use
year-month-day with a four digit year and two digit month and day, as
there is no chance it can be misinterpreted. It also sorts
alphabetically into the correct order, and it is the ISO standard for
writing dates.

For personal use I stick to the New Zealand convention, which is
day/month/year, but I prefer to use four digits for the year.

I agree. They are off topic.

Nor for anyone in the US who has sufficient experience dealing with people
from outside the US and recognizes that on Usenet people can post from
anywhere.

When I date things for myself, I've taken to using IS0 (YYYY-MM-DD)
format.  When I fill out some form in the US, I will do something like
&quot;Nov 5, 2007&quot; and in places like Britain &quot;5 Nov, 2005&quot; (A date to
remember.)

This way, I can pretty much conform to local conventions, but not write
ambiguous dates.

No it's not. Merkins weird dates. The _rest_ of the English-speaking world
reads 11-4-07 as 11 April 07. This kind of thing is a classic example of the
reason why I _always_ use either the actual month (4 Nov, 4 November, 4 Nov
2007, 4 November 2007) or a standard, international, convention (2007-11-04)
which is clear to all concerned.

You want bonfires, you should go to Lewes, where my wife's parents live.
We went there a couple of years ago for the parades.

Amazing they can still get away with it what with the Health and Safety
paranoia of our age. The various bonfire societies parade through the
town, all dressed up - and lots of live fireworks just happen to go off
as they pass. It's extremely noisy - but very well attended.

And the local council does the cleanup during the small hours. Next day,
you'd never know anything had happened the previous night.

I'm amazed that we're allowed to burn old Guy in effigy nowadays. I
mean, he was just promoting his own unique religious beliefs, after all.
Of course, for years after the event, Englishfolk used to burn the Pope
in effigy on November 5 too, which we'd be advised not to do today, I
guess.

In fact various of the bonfire societies down in Sussex burn lots of
effigies. There was a pic in the Times over the w/e showing one of them
had a 20ft one of Cherie Blair (aka Cruella de Ville). What better
choice, eh? Maggie got it too, in her day.

When I was a kid, however, although we knew that Guy had tried to blow
up the HofP, nothing was made of the religious angle - after all, people
don't blow things up for religious reasons, do they.

in 1605, or course, they were rather more concerned about it. That
concern, interestingly enough, was what led to the Bill of Rights only
84 years later.

It was a joke.  Like you in written communications I explicitly write
the month or possibly use YYYY-MM-DD to avoid the ambiguity.
