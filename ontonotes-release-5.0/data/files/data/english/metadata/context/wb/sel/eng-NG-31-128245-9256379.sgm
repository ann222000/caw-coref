Hamodia Interview with Rabbi Pesach Lerner
National Council of Young Israel Advocates For Jonathan Pollard
by  T. Silber - Hamodia -  September 5, 2007
[With thanks to Justice4JP]

Many people associate the National Council of Young Israel (NCYI) with
Jonathan Pollard. Rabbi Pesach Lerner, Executive Vice President of the
National Council of Young Israel, based in New York City but representing
shuls and communities throughout North America, has undertaken a campaign to
inform and educate the Jewish community in America and in Israel about the
plight of Jonathan Pollard, an American Jew who spied for Israel. Although
the normal punishment for spying for an ally is a 4-6 year prison term,
Jonathan Pollard was given a life sentence. Hamodia thanks Rabbi Lerner for
this important interview.

HOW DID YOU FIRST GET INVOLVED WITH POLLARD'S PLIGHT?

I joined the National Council of Young Israel in October 1991. In order to
service the needs of our 150 member shuls, I decided that it was important
for me to personally visit each of them, to introduce myself, and get to
know them and their needs.

I heard that the Young Israel of Manhattan, on Manhattan's Lower East Side,
was having a special program about Jonathan Pollard. I had heard the basic
story about the Pollard case and decided that this event would give me a
chance to visit the Young Israel branch and to learn more about the Pollard
cause.
I listened to the speaker and walked away with many questions. I began
researching the story of a Jew in prison because he spied for Israel, and
the more I researched, the more questions I had. I inquired of my rabbinic
mentors and they told me that if I felt there was an issue of a Jew in
trouble, of a mitzvah of pidyon shvuyim, then I should do what I could to
help.

In May 1993, I was invited to speak to a group of alumni of Yeshiva Chofetz
Chaim of Queens, NY, who were in the field of rabbanus. That talk gave birth
to the idea of using the plight of Jonathan Pollard, through which these
rabbanim could direct their discussion to the mitzvah of pidyon shvuyim,
concern for another Jew, etc. From that program, a kol korei, a declaration
in support of Jonathan Pollard, was signed by about 30 Roshei Yeshivah,
Chassidic Rebbes and Gedolei Yisrael.

That kol korei, and the discussions I had privately with many of the signers
on that document, gave me the halachic mandate and obligation to get more
involved, stay involved, and get others involved.

Since that time, many additional Gedolei Yisrael have stated publicly, and
to me privately, that the mitzvah of pidyon shvuyim demands that Klal
Yisrael to do everything we can to have Pollard released.

In addition, I have spoken to many individuals, in Washington, D.C., and in
Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, about the Pollard case. And the more questions I
ask, the more research I do, the more I am motivated to help Jonathan.

Yes, Jonathan committed a crime, he admits that. Jonathan is quite
remorseful for his actions. The issue here is the life sentence. A life
sentence has never been given to anyone spying for an ally, a friendly
country, except to Jonathan Pollard, a Jew caught spying for Israel. And,
today, there are so many others calling for his release.

According to James Woolsey, who reviewed the entire classified Pollard file
as former director of the CIA under President Clinton, Pollard has served a
long sentence and he favors releasing him. Woolsey said &quot;.now that he has
served 20 years of a prison sentence, my view is that a 20year sentence is
enough, and I think the close relationship between the United States and
Israel as fellow democracies is also a consideration.&quot;

In reference to Pollard's life sentence, Federal Judge Stephen Williams of
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia declared &quot;.the
government's breach of the plea agreement was a fundamental miscarriage of
justice.&quot;

Rudolph Giuliani, former Mayor of New York City and a former federal
prosecutor, has said that &quot;given comparative sentences, [Jonathan Pollard's]
sentence - this I happen to know because I have seen the documents - is way
beyond the sentences served by other people that have been convicted of the
same offense.&quot;

Dennis DeConcini, U.S. Senator (Arizona, retired) and former chairman of the
Senate Select Intelligence Committee (responsible for overseeing federal
intelligence activities) during the time Pollard was arrested, agrees that
Pollard should be released, and has written, &quot;I am convinced that Mr.
Pollard has expressed the appropriate remorse and served adequate time.&quot;

In a letter to the President, the Conference of Presidents of Major American
Jewish Organizations wrote, &quot;...while they represent a broad spectrum of
views, the fifty-four member organizations unanimously authorized us to
communicate this appeal that you grant clemency to Mr. Pollard ... Mr.
Pollard has paid for his crime.&quot;

WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM? HOW IS HE HOLDING UP?

I have visited Jonathan three times within the last month. First, with NY
Assemblyman Dov Hikind and Dr. Joseph Geliebter, whose foundation has been
sponsoring the ads asking the community to call the White House, daily, to
ask the president to release Pollard. Second, with a non-Jewish clergyman,
to encourage him to get involved. And most recently, with another important
individual, to introduce him to Jonathan Pollard.

Jonathan has numerous serious illnesses, and his medications often
counteract one another. He has issues of diabetes, and has a limited diet as
it is, because he is keeping kosher under difficult conditions. However,
under the circumstances, he is holding up well. Jonathan is a man of
unbelievable emunah and bitachon, faith and trust in G-d. He is not bitter
or angry. He is very bright and, to the best of his ability, upbeat.

Each time I visit him, either by myself or with others, I come away
impressed how, after 21 years in prison, many of those in a most difficult
situation, he can be so well adjusted, believing, and a pleasure to be
around. He is a very special person.

HOW OFTEN DOES HE HAVE VISITORS, PHONE CALLS?

Jonathan is allowed a limited number of visitors each month, and just 300
minutes of monthly phone time. His visitors are most often individuals
involved in his campaign, and individuals he wants to get involved in his
efforts to be freed. He does not have the koach or interest for social
visits. He uses all of his 300 monthly minutes, which works out to 10
minutes each day, to speak to his wife, Esther, who is currently in
Jerusalem, coordinating all international activities and initiatives for his
release.

ARE THERE ANY LEGAL VENUES LEFT?

No.

WHY HASN'T HE APPLIED FOR PAROLE?

The suggestion that Pollard is eligible for parole is correct, but the
implication that there is a possibility that he would receive parole is
totally incorrect. The law enforcement and intelligence agency officials who
have been given the opportunity to express themselves on the subject have
indicated that they would oppose parole. Immediately following sentencing,
the U.S. Attorney vowed that Mr. Pollard would &quot;never see the light of day.&quot;
Parole is a virtual impossibility under those circumstances.

Every legal expert the Pollard camp has spoken to - and there have been
many - told them that the parole board would reject Jonathan's request out
of hand. However, a greater risk in the rejection of a parole request could
be a 15-year &quot;set aside,&quot; which means that not only will parole be denied
but, also, the case cannot be revisited for another 15 years. That &quot;set
aside&quot; would be catastrophic for any clemency request to be made within that
time period. In short, a parole request is absolutely the wrong avenue to
follow.

WHO ARE HIS ATTORNEYS, AND ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THEIR WORK?

I wish to assure your readers that Jonathan's pro-bono Orthodox attorneys,
Eliot Lauer and Jacques Semmelman of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle
LLP, have done and continue to do everything that can be done, within the
legal field, to gain Jonathan's freedom. They are outstanding professionals,
stymied only by a judicial system that is strongly biased against Jonathan.

DOES JONATHAN APPRECIATE LETTERS?

I believe he does, but it is impossible for him to respond to them.
Therefore, when he receives them, he feels badly about not answering them.
[See *J4JP Clarification Re: Mail for Jonathan Pollard below.] Jonathan is
very bright, so the letters need to have serious content.

HAS THE PRESENT ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DONE ANYTHING ON HIS BEHALF?

Unfortunately, the answer is no.

DO LETTERS/PHONE CALLS TO PRESIDENT BUSH REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE?

We believe the phone calls and letters are being noticed. The Pollard
Call-In Campaign spearheaded by the National Council of Young Israel last
spring put Pollard on the agenda in the White House. His name now appears on
the list of issues that all the White House phone operators are given to
check off the number of calls instead of writing in the subject matter.

For the first time, the White House is responding, albeit with a form
letter, to everyone who writes to the president about Jonathan Pollard.
Recently, in early August, I met with individuals who work in the White
House, and they told me that the campaign has been noticed. It is important
that the president and his staff realize that Jonathan Pollard is important
to the Jewish community.

Currently, we are coordinating many activities behind the scenes with the
goal of finding the right person or persons to present directly to the
president the correct packet of information and documents that will
encourage him to free Pollard. The calls and letters to the White House are
very important.

ANY FINAL MESSAGE FOR OUR READERS?

The community must be mitpallel for Yehonatan ben Malka, call the White
House daily at 202-456-1111, ask their shul rabbis to discuss Jonathan,
educate themselves about the case, and educate their state and federal
officials about Pollard. We must do all of this until Pollard is released.

We must all continue to pray for the release of Yehonatan ben Malka, and
with G-d's help, we will soon merit to have our prayers answered. -30-

*Justice4JP Clarification RE: Mail for Jonathan Pollard

1) IN GOING MAIL FOR JONATHAN:
Jonathan Pollard derives great pleasure and comfort from the letters he
receives. It is recommended to write in English. Letters that arrive in
Hebrew are shown to him very briefly and then destroyed. Jonathan receives
all of his in-going mail, provided that it is correctly addressed, and that
the envelope does not contain anything but a letter. Jonathan's address is:
Jonathan Pollard #09185-016
c/o FCI Butner
P.O. Box 1000
Butner, NC
U.S.A  27509-1000

2) OUT GOING MAIL FROM JONATHAN:
Please be aware that Jonathan is not able to respond to letters he receives.
All of his out-going mail is sent to Washington for scrutiny. In theory, his
mail supposed to be reviewed for content in Washington and then forwarded on
to the addressee.  In practice, Jonathan's out-going mail is deliberately
lost, destroyed, or delayed by Washington for so long as to be irrelevant.
This only occurs with mail that Jonathan sends out.  As a rule, Jonathan
receives all of the mail that is sent to him. Please do write!
