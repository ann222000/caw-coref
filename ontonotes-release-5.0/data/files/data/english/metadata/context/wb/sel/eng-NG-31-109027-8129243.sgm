Outbreak Linked To Foot And Mouth Lab

August 04, 2007

The foot and mouth outbreak at a farm in Surrey may have been caused by a
leak from a nearby animal research laboratory.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)said the virus
is the same as one being used at Pirbright Laboratory, just a few miles from
the farm.

Defra could not say definitely if the laboratory was the source of the
disease, but immediately increased the size of the protection zones covering
farms in the area.

Experts said the strain was not one recently found in animals, but was
similar to ones used in diagnostic laboratories and vaccine production.

In a statement, Defra said: &quot;The present indications are that this strain is
a 01 BFS67-like virus, isolated in the 1967 foot and mouth disease outbreak
in Great Britain.&quot;

The strain is present at the Pirbright site's Institute of Animal Health and
was used in a vaccine batch manufactured last month, Defra said.

A Conservative Party spokesman said: &quot;If there is evidence that this
outbreak has come out of Pirbright Laboratory, a full inquiry into the
laboratory's bio-security must be carried out urgently and immediately.&quot;

Some 60 cattle at the infected farm, close to the village of Wanborough,near
Guildford, were culled and their bodies taken away for incineration.

Chief Veterinary Officer Debby Reynolds said a cull had also taken place on
an adjacent premises which had been identified as having &quot;dangerous contact&quot;
with the infected herd.

A UK-wide ban on the movement of all livestock is in place to stop the
spread of the disease.

Prime Minister Gordon Brown said authorities were doing everything they
could to contain it.

The UK has also imposed a voluntary export ban on all animals and animal
products.

The PM cut short a Dorset holiday to chair two meetings of the emergency
Cobra committee on the issue.

Speaking at 10 Downing Street afterwards, he said scientific investigations
to find the source of the outbreak were continuing &quot;with speed and with
great professionalism&quot;.

Mr Brown will chair a further meeting of Cobra - the fourth of the current
crisis - in the morning.

The Surrey premises have been under restrictions since late on Thursday
evening when symptoms were reported to the local animal health office.

The latest outbreak raised fears of another catastrophe like the one in
2001, which brought chaos to Britain and left farming and tourist industries
devastated.

It led to the slaughter of between 6.5 and 10 million animals, ruined many
farmers and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the country up
to £8.5bn.

Foot-And-Mouth Disease Found in UK

Saturday August 4, 2007
By Romina Spina, Associated Press Writer

Foot-And-Mouth Outbreak Prompts Britain to Ban Meat and Dairy Exports, Halt
Animal Movement

WANBOROUGH, England (AP) -- Britain raced to avert economic disaster
Saturday by halting meat and dairy exports and the movement of livestock
around the country after foot-and-mouth disease was found on a southern
English farm.

The strain of the highly infectious disease found was identical to one used
at a nearby government-funded laboratory that is researching vaccines for
the virus, Britain's environment agency said Saturday. Officials are still
investigating other possible sources, the country's chief veterinarian said.

Prime Minister Gordon Brown vowed to work &quot;night and day&quot; to avoid a repeat
of a 2001 outbreak, when millions of dead animals were burned on pyres,
swathes of the countryside were closed, rural tourism was badly hurt and
British meat was shut out of international markets.

&quot;Our first priority has been to act quickly and decisively,&quot; Brown said. &quot;I
can assure people ... we are doing everything in our power to look at the
scientific evidence and to get to the bottom of what has happened and then
to eradicate this disease.&quot;

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, or DEFRA, said
Britain had banned the export of live cattle, pigs, sheep and goats, as well
as carcasses, meat and milk.

The United States and Japan immediately banned British pigs and pork
products in response to the outbreak. British beef is already banned in both
countries because of mad-cow disease.

Wise.  No slouches in the United States and Japan.  Just ban all British
meat and meat products. -- DSH

The European Union was also likely to announce a ban on British livestock
imports in the 27-nation bloc when its executive body meets on Monday.

British authorities also imposed a nationwide ban on transporting cattle,
sheep, goats and pigs in response to the outbreak.

Foot-and-mouth disease causes fever and blister-like lesions on the mouths,
teats and hooves of affected animals. It can be deadly in livestock but is
harmless to humans.

Although many animals recover, the disease leaves them debilitated, causing
major losses in meat and milk production.

DEFRA said animals on a farm near Wanborough, about 30 miles southwest of
London, had tested positive for the disease, which affects livestock but not
humans.

The strain of the disease was the same as one used at the Institute for
Animal Health's Pirbright Laboratory, which is about four miles from the
affected farm.

Authorities have asked the lab to review its biosecurity procedures, the
government's chief veterinarian, Debby Reynolds said. Reynolds ordered a new
six-mile protection zone to be set up around the farm and the lab.

The strain detected in the outbreak is not one recently found in animals,
DEFRA said.

Indications the virus came from the lab suggest the problem could be
contained, said Andrew Biggs of the British Cattle Veterinary Association.

&quot;The proximity of this farm to Pirbright was too much of a coincidence,&quot; he
told British Broadcasting Corp. television. &quot;We know where it comes from
now, but there are still chances of it spreading. ... I don't think we can
let our guard down.&quot;

No one at the laboratory returned a phone message seeking comment Saturday.

Officials did not specify how many animals at the farm were infected, but
said all livestock on the farm were slaughtered and incinerated.

Scientists were trying to determine if vaccinations could be used to try to
halt the spread of the disease.

The government was criticized for not using vaccines to try to fight the
2001 epidemic. A report on that outbreak by a senior scientific body, the
Royal Society, concluded that vaccinations should be a major tool of first
resort in the event of future outbreaks.

Reynolds said it was too soon to determine how far the disease may have
spread.

Reynolds said there had been a small number of reports of signs of illness
among livestock on other farms in the country, but none had so far proved to
be foot-and-mouth disease.

Farmers near the infected site said they were hopeful quick action would
contain the disease.

I wasn't going to tell him!
But , in fairness; we won't know until later today (Monday) whether the
virus 'escaped' from the site itself nor whether from the UK laboratory or,
the USA-French owned company Merial's vaccine manufacturing plant, (both
within the confines of the site).
Perhaps, the Hawaiian plonker will instruct the world where he suggests  the
heads should be put on pikes .... Grosvenor Square?

Further farms tested for disease

More farms are being tested for foot-and-mouth disease after an outbreak at
a farm near Guildford.

Defra said other possible cases were being investigated after infected
cattle were culled at the Surrey farm.

A UK-wide ban on the movement of all livestock is in place, and farmers have
been asked to &quot;go the extra mile&quot; on biosecurity and vigilance.

Prime Minister Gordon Brown said experts were working &quot;night and day&quot; to
find the source of the disease.

A 3km protection zone has been put in place around the premises, close to
the village of Wanborough, to try to halt the spread of the disease which
wreaked havoc across the UK in 2001.

There is also a 10km surveillance zone where nearby animals are monitored,
as well as an 8km air exclusion zone around the site.

The UK's Chief Veterinary Officer Debby Reynolds told a press conference a
&quot;small number&quot; of further potential foot-and-mouth cases were being
investigated.

&quot;Some have been reported and found to be negative, others are still under
investigation,&quot; she said.

An assessment of biosecurity at the Institute for Animal Health in Pirbright
was also under way, she added.

The Pirbright institute, where research into foot-and-mouth is conducted, is
located not far from the Surrey farm.

Ms Reynolds said &quot;all possible sources&quot; of the disease were being
investigated.

&quot;It's important not to rule out any source in our inquiries,&quot; she said.

&quot;It is a big blow for it to be back in UK territory, but our objective is to
eradicate it and to learn the lessons learned after 2001, to use the lessons
learned for a speedy, systematic and scientific response,&quot; she said.

Defra also announced it would set up a national disease centre in London,
and a local one in Surrey as part of contingency plans.

Richard MacDonald, director general of the National Farmers' Union, said it
had been a &quot;devastating 24 hours for the livestock industry&quot;.

&quot;We are where we are now and we take that obviously hugely seriously and,
given all of that, our priority is to ensure that we get out of this
situation as quickly as possible and as effectively as possible.&quot;

Scientific analysis

The prime minister cancelled his holiday in Dorset to return to London for a
meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee. Later, Mr Brown
chaired his second Cobra meeting of the day.

FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE

Foot-and-mouth is a highly contagious viral disease which affects
cattle.

Symptoms include fever, lesions in the mouth and lameness.

The disease only crosses the species barrier from cattle to human with
very great difficulty.

The disease in humans is mild, short-lived and requires no medical
treatment

Mr Brown said: &quot;I want to do everything in our power immediately to get to
the scientific evidence, to look at the source of what has happened, to set
up a number of inquiries so that we can actually move very quickly, I mean
within hours and days, what has actually happened, and then to eradicate
this disease in Britain&quot;.

The infected farm in Surrey has been under restrictions since late on
Thursday when symptoms were reported.

Some 64 animals were culled at the farm on Saturday, after testing positive
for the disease.

Scientific analysis of the virus could be available late on Saturday, but it
may take longer depending on the exact strain of the disease involved.

Ms Reynolds has advised farmers across the UK to examine their animals
carefully and immediately report anything suspicious.

The outbreak in 2001 led to between 6.5 million and 10 million animals being
destroyed and cost as much as £8.5bn.

The Cabinet Office Minister, Ed Miliband, said there had been a co-ordinated
response to the outbreak.

A contingency plan had been in place since the 2001 outbreak, he said.

Britain has imposed a voluntary ban on exports of all animals with cloven
hooves, and animal products, Defra said.

And the European Commission said it would ban live animal exports from the
UK, excluding Northern Ireland, as well as meat and dairy products from the
area affected by the outbreak.

Conservative leader David Cameron, who has spoken with Mr Brown, said he
fully supported a ban on the movement of farm animals.

&quot;Livestock farmers face real difficulties with higher feed prices, the
dislocation caused by floods and TB in cattle. We must do everything
possible to make sure this is not a further blow to farming.&quot;

Brits, who have failed to have adequate inspections, regulation and

Americans.

Give them another week and they will figure out some off-the-wall way to
blame it all on President Bush.

The Brits should stop trying to spread Socialism and use their Government
for something useful and which it SHOULD be doing....

Like PREVENTING the outbreak, _ab initio_, and spread of Hoof &amp; Mouth
Disease and Mad Cow Disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or BSE).

PREEMPTIVE ACTION -- rather than just a Reactive Strategy.

Perhaps they will contain this recent outbreak...

I certainly HOPE so.

But I, and many other Americans and Japanese, will not be buying British
meat, of any sort, for a LONG time.

For goodness sake.

Don't tell them.

The price went down by half last time...

I'm still laughing about Egypt.

They were just about the first country last time to ban the import of
British beef,  and just about the last to raise the ban,  and FMD is endemic
there...

I'm right partial to Angus beef myself.
But it would be way too expensive to import the meat from Merry Old England.
We Americans, being partially of Scottish extraction ourselves, imported the
cattle and now raise our own.
Mind, a good Angus Porterhouse is still too expensive to eat except on rare
occasions.
But even Angus hamburger is soooo good!

Hilarious!

Pogue Surreyman tries to make us forget about the British penchant for Mad
Cow Disease.

He obviously posted without reading my post intelligently.

Par for the course with Pogue Surreyman.

Smart Consumers are not going to say &quot;FMD British meat is OK; it's just the
BSE British meat we need to worry about.&quot;

They'll just say don't import any British meat until the Brits clean up
their act -- and the consumers' governments will often follow suit.

Foot and mouth lab: 'Shocking security lapse'

By Nick Britten, Graeme Wilson and Graham Tibbetts

08/08/2007
The Telegraph

A major lapse in security at a Government research laboratory complex
was identified last night by an official report as the most likely cause of
the foot and mouth outbreak.

A Health and Safety Executive inquiry said there was a &quot;strong
possibility&quot; that the virus came from the Government-licensed Pirbright
complex in Surrey, which is just three miles from the two farms that have
been contaminated.

It is likely workers at the site - shared between the Institute for
Animal Health (IAH) and its commercial partner, Merial Animal Health - were
to blame for spreading the disease, the report said.

In a further twist, the HSE said that sabotage at the labs could not
be ruled out. Ironically, the Government has just asked Merial to produce
300,000 foot and mouth vaccines.

Politicians and farmers' leaders were last night asking how such a
fundamental breach could occur at a high-security laboratory complex where
highly contagious diseases were tested.

Peter Ainsworth, the Conservative environment spokesman, said: &quot;This
is truly shocking. It will be very bad news for the farming community, who
do so much to make sure they abide by the law.

&quot;This report is devastating in its conclusions and it will be deeply
troubling news for farmers, who are always being pushed to improve their
bio-security. Yet the labs that are meant to be preventing the disease turn
out to be the source of the outbreak.&quot;

Farmers were furious that their livelihoods were possibly being put at
risk by Government scientists.

Peter Kendall, the president of the National Farmers' Union, said:
&quot;This is soul-destroying for those farmers and their families within that
area. If this has come from a government agency or a private company those
people will be hurt, angry and upset.&quot;

The Merial facility at Pirbright is licensed and inspected by the
Government. Its most recent inspection was in February and, according to the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), everything was
found to be &quot;satisfactory&quot;.

Other developments yesterday included:

The two farmers whose herds have been infected with the disease
spoke of living through a &quot;nightmare&quot; and told of how their businesses had
been ruined.

Farmers spoke of their anger that footpaths within the protection
zone had not been closed sooner following the outbreak, allowing walkers to
potentially spread the disease for several days.

Others warned there would be &quot;hell to pay&quot; if it transpired that
moving the dead infected animals 80 miles across country for incineration
helped to spread the disease.

Supermarkets began reporting a shortage of meat caused by movement
restrictions.

The Daily Telegraph can also reveal that officials are
investigating a further possible 20 cases of foot and mouth, thought to be
close to the centre of the outbreak, where farmers have reported concerns
about their animals.

The HSE report could not say which facility at Pirbright was the
source of the outbreak. However, it gave the green light to the IAH to
continue operating as normal while saying further investigation was required
at Merial before any operations involving live pathogens could continue.

The vaccine company today insisted that rigorous tests have shown no
evidence of any breach of biosecurity procedures.

The report added several workers at the Pirbright site had been spoken
to during its inquiry.

As the investigators hunted the source of the leak, Defra officials
inspected a number of allotments, close to the farm where the outbreak first
occurred, on which Pirbright workers are believed to grow vegetables.

Farmers were last night concerned that the interim report failed to
nail down the exact cause.

Gordon Brown said, following the report's publication, that the work
goes on to &quot;isolate, to contain, control and eradicate the disease&quot;.

Laurence Matthews, who owns the field where the second outbreak
occurred, said communication between Defra and the farmers was &quot;very slow&quot;.
Mr Gunner, he said, was not contacted by Defra for nearly 48 hours after the
outbreak, despite his proximity to the original infected farm.
He added: &quot;The communication has been very slow to farmers and a lot of
farmers within the exclusion zones still, without going to the media or
going on to the website, find it very difficult to get information about
what to do.&quot;

Most of the tales of horrible food, awful living and brutal punishments
in Nelson's navy date from the Victorians, who found it easier to tell
tall tales about the Bad Old Days than to actually improve conditions
for the Andrew. (You can walk from HMS Warrior to HMS Victory in a few
minutes, and while Warrior is somewhat more spacious and has occasional
luxuries - a washing machine! - the crew are still slinging their
hammocks at eighteen inches per man and messing between the guns.)

But then, the &quot;Bloody Press&quot; abducting careless revellers out of taverns
at random makes better movies than the reality that the impress service
were only permitted and paid to pick up trained seamen: there was rarely
a shortage of landsmen, drawn by the promise of pay, prize money, meat
most days and a generous drink ration (though needing quite a lot of
training to go from waisters to ABs)

Life in the Navy then might have been harsh to modern eyes, but it was
almost luxurious compared to the lot of a farm labourer.

And if they didn't fancy their chances with the press they could get an
exemption reasonably easily.

All fishermen were exempt, as were the 'Sea fencibles'.

So if you took a job as a fisherman or did a morning's drill once every
month you were exempt.

There are a number of cases of Seas Fencibles being pressed,  all seem to
have been returned home reasonably quickly...

As a matter of passing interest,  the Black Boy pub in High Street in Hull
used to be the pub the press hung out at.

It's still a pretty rough area...

&gt; Foot and mouth lab: 'Shocking security lapse'

&gt; By Nick Britten, Graeme Wilson and Graham Tibbetts

&gt; 08/08/2007
&gt; The Telegraph

&gt;      A major lapse in security at a Government research laboratory complex
&gt; was identified last night by an official report as the most likely cause
of
&gt; the foot and mouth outbreak.

&gt;      A Health and Safety Executive inquiry said there was a &quot;strong
&gt; possibility&quot; that the virus came from the Government-licensed Pirbright
&gt; complex in Surrey, which is just three miles from the two farms that have
&gt; been contaminated.

&gt;       It is likely workers at the site - shared between the Institute for
&gt; Animal Health (IAH) and its commercial partner, Merial Animal Health -
were
&gt; to blame for spreading the disease, the report said.

&gt;      In a further twist, the HSE said that sabotage at the labs could not
&gt; be ruled out. Ironically, the Government has just asked Merial to produce
&gt; 300,000 foot and mouth vaccines.

&gt;       Politicians and farmers' leaders were last night asking how such a
&gt; fundamental breach could occur at a high-security laboratory complex where
&gt; highly contagious diseases were tested.

&gt;       Peter Ainsworth, the Conservative environment spokesman, said: &quot;This
&gt; is truly shocking. It will be very bad news for the farming community, who
&gt; do so much to make sure they abide by the law.

&gt;       &quot;This report is devastating in its conclusions and it will be deeply
&gt; troubling news for farmers, who are always being pushed to improve their
&gt; bio-security. Yet the labs that are meant to be preventing the disease
turn
&gt; out to be the source of the outbreak.&quot;

&gt;       Farmers were furious that their livelihoods were possibly being put
at
&gt; risk by Government scientists.

&gt;       Peter Kendall, the president of the National Farmers' Union, said:
&gt; &quot;This is soul-destroying for those farmers and their families within that
&gt; area. If this has come from a government agency or a private company those
&gt; people will be hurt, angry and upset.&quot;

&gt;      The Merial facility at Pirbright is licensed and inspected by the
&gt; Government. Its most recent inspection was in February and, according to
the
&gt; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), everything was
&gt; found to be &quot;satisfactory&quot;.

&gt;       Other developments yesterday included:

So what were the loss rates?

Bligh's Bounty and Cook's Endeavour didn't seem to suffer terribly high loss
rates.

I pick those two men because they were both spectacularly good sailors.

Bligh  was Cook's Sailing Master,  and before that,  of course,  Bligh was
his 'master's mate' when Cook was Sailing Master to the British fleet.

It was Cook and Bligh who navigated the St Lawrence so that Woolf could

&gt;&gt; Animal Health (IAH) and its commercial partner, Merial Animal Health -
&gt;&gt; were
&gt;&gt; to blame for spreading the disease, the report said.

&gt; All bio research in the UK is licensed.

&gt; Merial is a US owned,  US managed company doing work for the US government
&gt; that it is banned from doing in the USA.

Those dastardly Merks are at it again.
But have they determined that Merial is indeed the source of the infection?
It would be a shame if it all turned out to be a British problem and the
American poltroons were not at all involved.....
