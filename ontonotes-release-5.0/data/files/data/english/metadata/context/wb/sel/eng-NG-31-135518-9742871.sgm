&gt; Dear Professor Stein/Will,

&gt;  I unzipped and installed sage-2.8.15-ubuntu32bit-i686-Linux.tar.gz
&gt;  on my ubuntu linux system. The install went very smoothly.

&gt;  I am now enjoying learning about sage by working through the tutorial.

&gt;  Everything was working fine until I got to section 2.4.2, multivariate
&gt; polynomials.
&gt;  There, when I try the command

&gt;  B = I.groebner_basis(); B

&gt;  I get

&gt;  RuntimeError: Unable to start singular because the command 'Singular -t
&gt; --ticks-per-sec 1000' failed.

&gt;  I may be doing something wrong and this is a simple operator error, but I
&gt; don't know.
&gt;  Can you help me with this?

That's definitely not simple operator error.  Could you tell me how much
memory (RAM) your computer has, and also exactly what is output
if you type

sage: !Singular

and also

sage: !Singular -t --ticks-per-sec 1000

??

&gt; Okay, the command
&gt;  sage: !Singular
&gt;  tells me
&gt;  sh: Singular: not found

&gt;  Not sure how much RAM I have and the other sage: !Singular command
&gt;  also indicates that I don't have singular installed.

That's extremely strange, because Singular comes with Sage.  You should
not have to install it.  How did you decompress the sage tarball?  Did you
type

tar zxvf sage-2.8.15-ubuntu32bit-i686-Linux.tar.gz

Were there any error messages?

What is the md5sum for your download, and how big is it (it should be
about 229MB)?

sage@modular:~/incoming/bin/linux/32bit$ ls -lh
sage-2.8.15-ubuntu32bit-i686-Linux.tar.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 sage sage 229M 2007-12-05 20:24
sage-2.8.15-ubuntu32bit-i686-Linux.tar.gz

sage@modular:~/incoming/bin/linux/32bit$ md5sum
sage-2.8.15-ubuntu32bit-i686-Linux.tar.gz
d9f8d6da2a294834271beac289c01018  sage-2.8.15-ubuntu32bit-i686-Linux.tar.gz

Singular is definitely in the sage tarball:

sage@modular:~/incoming/bin/linux/32bit/sage-2.8.15-ubuntu32bit-i686-Linux$
ls -l local/bin/Singular
lrwxrwxrwx 1 sage sage 50 2007-12-09 14:26 local/bin/Singular -&gt;
/home/was/sage-2.8.15.rc0/local/bin/Singular-3-0-4
sage@modular:~/incoming/bin/linux/32bit/sage-2.8.15-ubuntu32bit-i686-Linux$
ls -l local/bin/Singular-3-0-4
-rwxr-xr-x 1 sage sage 10404521 2007-12-03 22:46 local/bin/Singular-3-0-4

&gt; Maybe this is it:

&gt;  richard@mth-rb:~/sage/sage-2.8.15-ubuntu32bit-i686-Linux/local/bin$ ls -la
&gt; Singular*
&gt;  lrwxrwxrwx 1 richard richard       50 2007-12-09 16:57 Singular -&gt;
&gt; /home/was/sage-2.8.15.rc0/local/bin/Singular-3-0-4
&gt;  -rwxr-xr-x 1 richard richard 10404521 2007-12-04 00:46 Singular-3-0-4

&gt;  The first is a broken symbolic link.

&gt;  There are a few other broken symbolic links in that directory to
&gt; /home/was/...
">

OK, that's definitely it, and it's undoubtedly the result of somebody
messing up in updating the Singular component of Sage.  I'll
make a new binary that fixes the problem and any other similar
ones and get back to you.  Thanks for reporting this.

This is in fact a *huge* problem because it means that Singular
won't work for the 3000 or so people who downloaded Sage
yesterday during the slashdot story.
