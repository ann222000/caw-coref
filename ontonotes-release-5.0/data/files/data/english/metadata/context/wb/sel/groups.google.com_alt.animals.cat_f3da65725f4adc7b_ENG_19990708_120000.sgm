I had my 8 month old silver persian spayed yesterday, and had planned on
declawing her as well until I read some posts here and followed some links.
I hadn't realized it was so cruel. The strange part about it is that my cat
doesn't really scratch anything. Yet I still felt it was 'normal' to have
her declawed. Just thought I'd let you guys/gals in on my day :)

"/> Thank you for choosing not to declaw your cat! I'm glad you took the time to
research instead of taking the easy way out and just getting it done.
&lt;applauds you&gt;

That is why, even though we get weary of them, I think declawing threads are
a good thing. We have countless new people visiting this and other
newsgroups everyday, and some are like sean where they are already thinking
of declawing their cats. If they read our bickering and maybe follow a few
links they can see for themselves why some of us are so adamantly against
declawing. From there they may choose not to declaw. To quote Martha
Stewart... &quot;It's a good thing.&quot;

"/> Both of my cats came altered because we got them at the Humane Society. The
older of the cats is frontal declawed because we saw a little of the
behavior coming through. We are lucky that we did because she paws at
everything now and if she would have had nails we would have had to replace
a lot of things. Yes, it isn't really right but sometimes it is necessary.
We are getting our new baby (3 month old male) frontal declawed also because
our apartment now calls for it. Maybe if we owned our own home and had a lot
of money we wouldn't.

"/> No, you would have had to take time to train her not to scratch your
furniture. Both of my cats have claws, both of them clawed at things they
shouldn't when they were younger. I trained them to scratch only the
scratching post and I haven't had to replace a single thing. No, I don't
have a shredded couch and scratched up chairs. All of my furniture looks as
good as the day I brought it home from the store. Well, with the exception
of that pesky wine stain I got on one of the cushions.

very rare for there to be a medical reason and it is almost never right to
declaw your cat. Putting the welfare of inanimate objects ahead of the
welfare of your cats is definitely *not* right.

home. My boyfriend and I live in an apartment, we both have student loans
which we are attempting to pay off. All of this adds up to two people who
neither own their own home, nor are they rich by any means. Guess what, we
have fully clawed cats! In fact, it costs less to train your cat than it
does to mutilate them. What this comes down to is not enough motivation to
actually go out and find other options. Sure it takes more work, but your
cats are worth it.

Hi.

I've got the same problem with my cat. It just puts its clows on any
piece of furniture. I've bought a special pad and an incence spray
but she not only ignores it but is afraid to come close. :( Last time
I changed apartment (I rent it) I had to pay about 100$ for the
spoiled furniture!!! Has anyone got any advice on training the
cat?

I had to reply because I have found that a water spray bottle works wonders.
We have a year old and she does not like it at all and knows that if she
does a particular act that we don't like, she gets it. The baby (a 4 month
old male) is learning little by little about the spray bottle. It takes
about 3 squirts to get him off the counter but it used to be 5. *smile*

Hiya Ilya!

If you cat scratches the furniture, try clipping it's claws. I clip my threes
claws once a week, they're used to it now, and make no real damage around the
house or on my arm/leg. A cat claw clipper costs about £5 ($8) and is so much
better for kitty than de-clawing. The only downside is that when Pebbles (a
nutty Bengal) tries to scale the curtains, she falls off halfway up.

Yours. Pont.
