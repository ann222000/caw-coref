*Shirdi Sai's Philosophy in the words of Saibanisaji*

* *

*In my opinion*

* *

Human desires are endless. It is like the thirst of a man who drinks salt
water; he gets no satisfaction and his thirst is only increased.

There are three kinds of people in the world.

The first are those who are like letters carved in rock; they easily give
way to anger and retain their angry thoughts for a long time.

The second are those who are like letters written in sand. They give way to
anger also, but their angry thoughts quickly pass away.

The third is those who are like letters written in running water; they do
not retain their passing thoughts; they let abuse and uncomfortable gossip
pass by unnoticed; their minds are always pure and undisturbed.----*

2*. SAI'S NEWS FROM THE TIME MACHINE*:

October 1, 1918: Baba asked a devotee by name Waze to read ' RamaVijay' (by
Shridhar Swami) and listened to it for 14 days.

October 8, 1918: A tiger met its death at the feet and presence of Sai Baba
and was emancipated.

October 15, Tuesday 1918: On Vijaya Dashmi, Saibaba left His mortal coil at
about 2:30 p.m. Few minutes before, He gave Rs.9/- as charity to Laxmibai
Shinde.

October 16, Wednesday 1918: Early morning Baba appeared to Das Ganu at
Pandharpur in dream and said &quot; The Dwarakamai has collapsed and all the
oilmen and grocers have troubled Me a lot. So I am leaving the place. Go
there quickly and cover My body copiously with flowers&quot;.

October 16, Wednesday 1918: Early morning Baba appeared to Laxman Mama in
dream and said,&quot; Get up quickly, Bapusaheb Jog thinks that I am dead and he
won't come, so you do My worship and Kakada Arati&quot;.

-----------------

3*. SAI IN DREAMS:*
http://www.ettitudemedia.com

These are the dream sequences and messages as received by SaiBaNiSaji From
our beloved GURU LORD SAINATH OF SHIRIDI. In Anticipation that this feature
will help in one's spiritual growth are hereby compiled from his personal
Diary and presented to SAIBANDHUS.

Translated and presented by RAGHU RAMAN SATULURY.

APRIL-1995:

*17-04-1995***

Yesterday, Sai appeared in the form of saint and shown me with results of
being lustful in life-

It is legitimate to eagerly wait for the monthly salary while working hard,
but not in good taste to step sideways to make more money.

It is perfectly right to look for sex in marriage but seeking sex outside
marriage amounts to sin.

Lust should be confined only to the legitimate partner.

*18-04-1995***

Yesterday, Sai has shown me few personalities leading the life of arrogance
and cautioned me not to toe their lines.

-A person ill-treating the parents blinded by his position in society.

-A rich one looking low and ignoring his kith and kin.

-Bridegroom's party subjecting the bride's side to humiliation.

-Disrespecting the teachers.

Shun the path of arrogance.

*19-04-1995***

Yesterday, Sai has shown me a leper. He was in his past life leading the
life of a jealous person as follows:

- He was rich and well to do person, but leading solitary life. On the other
hand there was a poor person, earned good name, fame and commanded respect
in society. This factor has lead to intolerance in the rich person who
suffered both mentally as well as physically. He died with that background
and is reborn in the next life to lead the life of a Leper. So avoid being
jealous.

Jealousy leads to intolerance and often wrecks the mind and health.

4. *QUINTESSENCE OF SRI SAIBABA'S PHILOSOPHY:
*(By Late Sri Bharam UmamaheswaraRao)

&quot;Shashi&quot;: shashi ... @yahoo.com&lt;http://f1mail.rediff.com/bn/compose.cgi?login=saibanisa&amp;session_ id=1K1KLKV1jMvA1H4yba7Qgvx521aU&amp;FormName=mail_to_individual&amp;email=shashi ... @yahoo.com&gt;

*30. Efficacy of Prayer and Worship ***

For the Gruhasta, the best way is the Bhakti Marga, the path of devotion to
God. The name of God is like the beaten track that leads a man, lost in the
woods, out of it. Let us adopt the Bhakti Marga and leave everything to God.
Let us sing His praises and lose ourselves in His glory and beauty. Let us
tell Him: &quot;Oh God. I am a mere blundering mortal. I do not know what is
right or wrong. No matter how I act, my actions are bound to be imperfect
because it is perforce incomplete, partial and fragmented. I surrender
myself to you. I know only one thing and that is that you know what is best
for me. You be my guide and take me unto You&quot;.

Sincere devotion to God is all that is needed. In fullness of time, God
gives us everything, taking care of us as a mother would take care of her
child. If the mind still wavers, we should recite Sri Sai's stotra and do
Japa and Nama Sankeertana and through Satsang steady our mind.

When we pray, we surrender ourselves whole and entirely to God's
dispensation. 'Thy will be Done', we tell Him. It is a willing confession of
our helplessness and seeking refuge in Him. We call it 'Saranagati'.

But the surrender to God doesn't obviate human effort. We must do our duty
even while we make this surrender. The fact of surrender merely means that
we should not think about fruits of our actions and leave them to God only.
Such dedicatory action is true prayer. God likes the person who does his
duty and not him who merely utter's God's name in prayer with his lips, and
without doing his duty. It is in this sense, that work is worship. The
technique of individual prayer is silence. It effects direct communion with
God.

*5.  SANATANA DHARMA &amp;SHRI SHIRDI SAIBABA.*

*October 15, Tuesday 1918: On Vijaya Dashmi, Saibaba left His mortal coil at
about 2:30 p.m. Few minutes before, He gave Rs.9/- as charity to Laxmibai
Shinde.*

The readers up till now heard the stories of Baba's life. Let them now hear
attentively Baba's Passing away. Baba got a slight attack of fever on 28th
September, 1918. The fever lasted for 2 or 3 days, but afterwards Baba gave
up his food and thereby He grew weaker and weaker. On the 17th day, i.e.,
Tuesday, the 15th October 1918, Baba left His mortal coil at about 2-30 p.m.
(Vide Professor G.G. Narke's letter, dated 5th November 1918, to Dadasaheb
Khaparde, published in Leelamagazine, Page 78, first year).

Two years before this, i.e., in 1916, Baba gave an indication of His Passing
away, but nobody understood it then. It was as follows: - On the
Vijayadashmi (Dasara) day Baba at once got into wild rage in the evening
when people were returning from 'Seemollanghan' (crossing the border or
limits of the village). Taking off His head-dress, kafni and langota etc.,
He tore them and threw them in the Dhuni before Him. Fed by this offering,
the fire in the Dhuni began to burn brighter and Baba shone still brighter.
He stood there stark naked and with His burning red eyes shouted - fellows,
now have a look and decide finally whether I am a Moslem or a Hindu.
Everybody was trembling with fear and none dared to approach Baba. After
some time Bhagoji Shinde, the leper devotee of Baba, went boldly near Him
and succeeded in tying a langota (waist-band) round His waist and said -
what is all this? Today is the Seemollanghan, i.e., Dasara
Holiday.Babastriking the ground with His satka said - is my
Seemollanghan (crossing the
border).Baba did not cool down till 11-00 p.m. and the people doubted
whether the chavadi procession would ever take place that night. After an
hour Baba resumed His normal condition and dressing Himself as usual
attended the chavadi procession as described before. By this incident Baba
gave a suggestion that Dasara was the proper time for Him to cross the
border of life, but none understood its meaning.

Dasara or Vijayadashami is regarded by all the Hindus as the most auspicious
time and it is befitting that Baba should choose this time for His crossing
the border-line. He was ailing some days before this, but He was ever
conscious internally. Just before the last movement He sat up erect without
anybody's aid, and looked better. People thought that the danger had passed
off and He was getting well. He knew that He was to pass away soon and
therefore, He wanted to give some money as charity to Laxmibai Shinde.

Being so watchful and conscious, Baba also took other precautions in His
last moment. In order that He should not be embroiled or entangled with love
and affection for His devotees, He ordered them all to clear off. Kakasaheb
Dixit, Bapusaheb Booty and others were in the Dwarakamayi anxiously waiting
upon Baba, but He asked them to go to the Wada and return after meals. They
could not leave Baba's presence, nor could they disobey Him. So with heavy
hearts and heavy feet they went to the Wada. They knew that Baba's case was
very serious and that they could not forget Him. They sat for meals, but
their mind was elsewhere, it was with Baba. Before they finished, news came
to them of Baba's leaving the mortal coil. Leaving their dishes, they ran to
the Dwarakamayi and found that Baba rested finally on Bayaji's lap. He did
not fall down on the ground nor did He lie on His bed, but sitting quietly
on His seat and doing charity with His own hand threw off the mortal coil.
Saints embody themselves and come into this world with a definite mission
and after that is fulfilled they pass away as quietly and easily as they
came.

6. DEVOTEES EXPERIENCES:

rajadhya ... @comcast.net

Sun, September 30, 2007 1:37 pm

In 1996 November, we got married and applied for our green card through my
husband's company. That time process was really slow. Suddenly our date
became current in 1998 and we were ready to apply, date moved back. We were
really disappointed but doing our regular puja and I used to pray to SaiBaba
and had faith that Baba will take care of it.

On 15th January, 1999 I got letter that current company lawyer won't be
handling our case anymore. I was shocked, it was Friday 5:30pm when Lawyer
Office was closed, my husband had gone to Colorado for his company work and
I didn't want to tell my husband about it when he is so faraway from home.
We used to check our date on regular basis and that week on Monday or
Tuesday we checked and our green card was not approved. Now Lawyer will not
proceed so everything was going wrong. But I had faith in SaiBaba took the
letter and started praying to Baba. After I finished my prayers I tried to
see Baba with my eyes closed and Baba told me to go and check date, I was
saying in my mind it wasn't current but since Baba said I took the phone and
called the number. I couldn't believe my ears our date was approved for
green card. So I had news for my husband one good and one bad.

My husband came home and I told him about it. He was shocked why Lawyer
terminated his case. He didn't want to ask his company so he decided to ask
the lawyer directly. But lawyer office was closed on Monday due to
President's day so we waited till Tuesday. Lawyer said company didn't want
him to do green card as company's owner thought my husband will find better
job once he gets his green card. But we told Lawyer our situation and long
wait. He agreed to help us with SaiBaba's grace and we went for our
interview on 20th of January and we got green card. This all was possible
just because of Saibaba's grace.

Peace to all. Om Shree Sainathayai namaha.**

Smt. Madhu Gopal Ravada, Saidarbar, Hyderabad.

Hello Children! I am Madhu aunty. Do you know Baba use to play with children
and used to tell stories to them? I felt children visiting Saidarbar should
be entertained with good stories. Now I want to tell the stories what heard
in my child hood.

*The Heron, Serpent and the Mongoose*

Once upon a time there lived a group of herons on a banyan tree. In the
hollow trunk of the tree dwelt a black serpent that ate the young herons
before they grew. Out of sorrow the heron, approached the crab.

.

The crab heard of the serpent and then thought to itself, &quot;The heron is also
the natural enemy of our race. So I need a scheme to get rid of all of
them&quot;. So he advised the heron to throw fish bits all the way from the house
of the mongoose to the tree where it lived.

.

The heron did as told and the mongoose following the trail of the fish came
and ate the serpent and at the same time crept up the tree and ate all the
herons too.

MORAL: *Don't listen to the advice of your natural enemy*.

*8*.   *SPIRITUAL GEMS FROM SAI SATCHARITRA*

swamym ... @yahoo.com

On 9/21/07

Sai Ram. We will now, with His grace, take up Chapter 25 of His Satcharitra.
Sai Ram.

SSS: Damu Anna Kasar of Ahmednagar - (1) Speculations - (2) Amra-Leela

* *

*Damu Anna *

The readers are aware that a mention of this gentleman was made in the 6th
Chapter, regarding the celebration of Rama-Navami festival in Shirdi. He
went to Shirdi about the year 1895, when the Rama-Navami Utsava-celebration
began and from that time he has been providing an ornamental flag for that
occasion every year. He also feeds the poor and the fakirs that come there
for the festival.

SSG: Sai Ram. He was indeed a lucky man to be able to go to Shirdi for so
many years and thus get developed spiritually. Sai Ram.

SSS: His Speculations: (1) Cotton

A Bombay friend of Damu Anna wrote to him, that they should do some
cotton-speculation business in partnership which would bring them about two
lacs of rupees as profit. (Damu Anna says in his statement made about the
year 1936 to Mr. B.V.Narasimha Swami that the proposal about speculating at
Bombay in cotton was from a broker who was not to be a partner, and that he
(Damu Anna) was to be the sole adventurer: - vide P.75 of the Devotees'
Experiences Part II). The broker wrote that the business was good and
involved no risks and that the opportunity should not be lost. Damu Anna was
oscillating in his mind.

SSG: Sai Ram. That he could not make up his mind was indeed due to the grace
of Baba. Otherwise, he would have gone ahead and lost a lot of money as we
shall see shortly. Sai Ram.

SSS: He could not at once determine to venture in the speculation. He
thought about this and as he was a devotee of Baba, he wrote a detailed
letter to Shama giving all the facts and requested him to consult Baba and
take His advice in the matter.

SSG: An excellent idea and Damu Anna was indeed fortunate and he showed an
important characteristic of a devotee, viz., Sraddha, faith, faith that the
Sadguru will guide us and show us the way. Sai Ram.

SSS: Shama got the letter next day and when he came with it at noon to the
Dwarakamayi and placed it before Baba. He asked Shama what the matter was,
and what the paper (letter) was about. He replied that Damu Anna of Nagar
wanted to consult Him about something. Then Baba said - &quot;What does he write,
and what does he plan? It seems that he wants to catch the sky and that he
is not content with what God has given him; read his letter&quot;. Shama than
said, &quot;The letter contains what you have just said now. Oh, Deva you sit
here calm and composed and agitate the devotees and when they get restless,
you draw them here, some in person and others through letters. If you know
the contents of the latter, why do you then press me to read it?&quot; Baba said
- &quot;Oh Shama, read it please. I speak at random and who believes Me.&quot;

9*. ARTICLES FROM SAI DEVOTEES:*

&quot;saikalaadla&quot; saikalaa ... @yahoo.com

Sun, 15 Jul 2007 02:50:18 -0000

Aum Sairam

A true disciple is one whose mind is always fixed on the feet of the Lord
wherever he is placed. A person can never be termed as a devotee if he is
wearing a saffron robe or counts beads constantly if his mind is attached to
materialistic things. The application of vibhuti on forehead or loud
repetition of God's name or keeping this scripture nearly is no sign of a
disciple.

When one comes in the refuge of the great Guru of the time, one learns about
the ways and means of combating the various obstacles at every step and is
thus saved from the onslaught of the mind. The path then becomes very simple
and the seeker forges ahead dauntlessly. The Guru then takes his devoted
seeker to the journey of the soul after initiating him. Devotee should have
some Sentiments within him.

Some of the sentiments or what we can term them as best qualities are

Acceptance – Faith - Complete Surrender - Constant Remembrance - Unbroken
Love and Devotion

However, to strengthen these five best qualities or sentiments Gurus out of
limitless mercy and grace has prescribed five rules, which are important for
every Devotee. Whosoever follows these five principles definitely evokes his
grace in abundance.

Five Rules are

Prayers and Worship - Selfless Services - True Association – Meditation -
Divine Vision

Only by devotion to guru can the mind be cleaned and purified and made to
only by devotion to Guru can the mind be cleaned and purified and made to
behold the radiance of the lord, who is perfectly pure and spotless. Blessed
is he who finds a perfect spiritual guru and receiving initiation from him,
follows his instructions with unquestioning faith. God appears with full
radiance in such a devoted soul, and enlightening his entire life and hereby
taking devotee to his life's destination salvation.

*13. EDITORIAL.*

Things impressed me from this magazine:

Sincere devotion to God is all that is needed. In fullness of time, God
gives us everything, taking care of us as a mother would take care of her
child

The fact of surrender merely means that we should not think about fruits of
