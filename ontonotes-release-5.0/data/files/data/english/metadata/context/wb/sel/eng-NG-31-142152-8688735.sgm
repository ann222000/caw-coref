The Portrait of an Olympic Host -- China trembles at the power of the blog

China trembles at the power of the blog

The official media were silent on child kidnappings – until a firestorm
of net postings forced them to report. It's one of several recent cases
where online activists have defeated Beijing's cybercops. By Catherine
Sampson

In Beijing, a pregnant woman, Zeng Jinyan, blogs almost daily about her
married life. This, however, is no tale of cosy domesticity. She posts
photographs of the cars used by the state security officers who follow
her and her husband every time they leave their house.

Last week, she described going for a walk in the park and chatting with
her husband about their unborn child. Then, in frustration, &quot;I looked
back at the state security officers whose keys were rattling at their
waists, and I said to them, 'Aren't you ashamed? Keep further away from
us!'&quot;

Zeng has blogged about how, on 18 May this year, she and her husband, Hu
Jia, were followed by plainclothes police to a routine 16-week pregnancy
check-up at the hospital. Then, on their way to the airport to fly to
Europe, they were detained by eight police officers and questioned for
four hours. Since then, they have been under constant state surveillance
and banned from travel. Zeng has blogged bitterly about her confinement
and the nature of a government that chooses to treat her and her unborn
child in this way.

Zeng and Hu are campaigners for the rights of people with HIV/Aids. They
are just two of a small but growing group of activists in China who are
beginning to use the power of the blog to reach a huge readership.

Xiao Qiang, editor of the US-based China Digital Times, an online
monitor of Chinese news and internet developments, points out that
&quot;censorship's most direct impact on blogging is that there is a lack of
'political bloggers' in the Chinese blogosphere&quot;. Pure politics is
simply too dangerous. The small number of campaigning bloggers are not
dissidents; they do not call for the overthrow of the Communist Party.
But they are at the forefront of debate on specific social issues.

The country's Communist leaders fear their power, but for all the
government's cyber-policing, the bloggers are proving almost impossible
to control. Last year, the official People's Daily reported that there
were more than 30 million bloggers in China, and that their numbers were
set to grow by a further 60 million in the next year.

Of course, many blogs fall by the wayside and, like bloggers everywhere,
many Chinese bloggers are more interested in film stars and sex than in
social activism. Portals use celebrity blogs to attract traffic, but the
lines between a politically sensitive blog and a useful
revenue-generator in a fiercely competitive portal market in China are
being blurred. What is clear is that in China, where free speech is
suppressed so vigorously, blogging has become a cyber civil society.

The phenomenon of activist blogging is &quot;unstoppable&quot;, says John Kennedy,
the Chinese language editor at Global Voices Online. &quot;In the absence of
a normally functioning legal system, the internet is where the engaged
public is coming to consensus on what the future of China is going to
look like.&quot;

The mainstream media remain under the control of the Propaganda
Department, the country's media police, which issues secret diktats
concerning what may and may not be covered. Most recently, The
Washington Post reported, food safety scandals, murder and riots have
been declared off limits.

Among many Chinese there is a thirst for debate, and for access to
information that has not been through the wringer of the Propaganda
Department. In several cases journalists themselves are embracing the
blog, and some newspapers are lifting articles and columns directly from
blogs to print in their pages.

In May, the journalist Lian Yue, in the tropical city of Xiamen, blogged
about the horrors he thought would be wreaked on his peaceful beachfront
city by a petrochemical plant the government was desperate to see built.
A few days later, someone sent an anonymous text message saying the
construction of the plant would be like dropping an atom bomb on Xiamen,
and SMS messages started to fly around the town. This launched the
biggest middle-class protests in China's modern history.

A media blackout was imposed on the demonstrations, but to the dismay of
the Propaganda Department the issue developed into a perfect storm of
blogs, SMS messages and internet bulletin-board postings. Several
bloggers from the independent collective Bullog attended the
demonstration and sent live SMS updates direct to a colleague who had
stayed at home at his computer, and he posted their updates minute by
minute. They soon attracted so many readers that Bullog's host server
was unable to keep up. Several people have been arrested for spreading
the word – the internet police have technological and administrative
methods to demolish a blogger's anonymity.

machine starts to crumble. Within society, bloggers like Lian Yue are
seen as more credible voices than propaganda officials.&quot;

In June this year, the internet once again deeply embarrassed the
Communist Party and set the agenda for national news. The parents of
kidnapped children in Henan posted a letter to an internet site begging
for help in finding their offspring, and it was instantly transmitted in
the form of blogs and SMS messages across China. Soon, the mainstream
media had no choice but to investigate the issue.

When the first television pictures were shown of battered and beaten
teenage boys being used as slave labour in brick kilns and mines, the
government itself launched an investigation. It was found that local
police and local officials were profiting from the trade in kidnapped
children. It was the sort of story that the mainstream media might well
have been ordered to hush up, but the firestorm of blogger reports
forced them to respond.

After the Xiamen protests, the government tried to ban anonymous
postings and to insist on real-name registration. Ever since the dawn of
the blog, the Propaganda Department has tried closing them, blocking
entire domains and imposing keyword filters that ban several hundred
sensitive words, only a small number of which are obscenities. The
keywords include the names of many of China's leaders, as well as
references to the Tiananmen massacre of 1989, and words relating to
Falun Gong, the religion that Beijing has branded a cult.

Posts containing these words are removed by censors employed by the host
site. Sometimes the blog itself is eliminated. But some filtering
systems are more efficient than others. Character splitting is one way
to evade the censors; because Chinese characters are made up of several
parts, these can be split apart on the page. This strategy fools an
automatic keyword filter, which sees only nonsense words, but is easily
digested by a reader who knows what is going on. Bloggers are also
working on systems that convert sensitive words into images, thereby
subverting the filters.

Last year Hao Wu, a well-known blogger, was arrested and detained for
140 days. His blog, Beijing or Bust, was mildly critical of the Chinese
government. He blogged about his plans to make a documentary about
Chinese Christians, and the obstacles he was encountering from religious
officials in Beijing.

After his release, he blogged about inviting his friends for a drink to
celebrate his freedom. &quot;I'm not one of those who fight to break the
shackles,&quot; he wrote. &quot;But I can dance. Dance with my shackles. Dance
with my bondage after the shackles.&quot;

Catherine Sampson's novel, The Pool of Unease, set in Beijing, is out
now (Macmillan, ?12.99). She blogs about her work and life in Beijing at
