The Five Great Istari (Wizards) of Middle Earth

tml

&lt;&lt;I was sorting through some of Tolkien's letters last night and found the
names of the five Istari or wizards of Middle-earth. There was a white, two
blue, a brown, and a grey wizard, whom supposedly &quot;arrived&quot; in Middle-earth
in that order. Only three are mentioned in The Lord of the Rings: The white,
the brown, and the grey. Two of their names you can guess, but here are all
of their names in order of their appearance in Middle-earth:

Saruman the White,
Alatar the Blue,
Pallando the Blue,
Radagast the Brown, and
Gandalf the Grey, who came last.

Saruman, Alatar, and Pallando traveled to the east, possibly to Mordor to
scout the power of Sauron. Saruman was the only one who made it back to the
east and settled at Isengard in the Tower of Orthanc. Tolkien doesn't say
exactly what happens to Alatar and Pallando, the two blue wizards. He said
they possibly fell to the dark powers and became servants of Sauron, they
could have been killed by Sauron, or that their task was simply to remain in
the east. Saruman was established as the &quot;chief&quot; wizard. Radagast the Brown,
who came fourth, abandoned his task. He disliked Elves, Humans, and Dwarves.
Radagast loved animals though, and he stayed with them and didn't associate
with 'higher-beings.' Saruman calls him &quot;Radagast the Simple,&quot;&quot;Radagast the
Bird-Tamer,&quot; and &quot;Radagast the Foolish.&quot; All of the five istariri (wizards)
purpose was to 'kindle' the hearts of Men and Elves to rival Sauron, but the
wizards were not to fight against Sauron directly. The wizards were sent
from Valinor, the 'undying' lands where elves go when they said into the
west. They were basically sent by the 'gods.' The Istari (wizards)
themselves were Maiar. Sauron was also a Maiar. I interpret them as 'angels'
; at least that's how we would look at it. Gandalf the Grey came last.
Tolkien says he is more 'aged' that the other four and leaned on a wooden
staff. When Gandalf arrives at the Grey Havens on the west shores of
Middle-earth, he was met by the master of the Grey Havens who was an elf
named Cirdan. Cirdan was the keeper of the Ring of Fire, or the Red Ring,
which was one of the three elvish rings of power called &quot;Naryu.&quot; Its power
was to kindle the hearts of the people's of Middle-earth. Though, all three
of the elvish ring's main purpose was to slow the decay of time. Cirdan gave
the Ring of Fire to Gandalf to help him in his 'labors.' Gandalf traveled
all over Middle-earth; he befriended elves, dwarves, men, and discovered the
Halflings (hobbits). Saruman discovered that Gandalf had the Red Ring and
began to envy and resent him. When Sauron started building up power again,
Elrond the Half-elf and Galadriel, the Lady of Lothlorien, created the White
Council. Saruman was placed as its head, though Elrond and Galadriel would
have preferred Gandalf. Saruman advised the council to wait and watch,
because he also sought for the One Ring, the Ring of Power. By this time,
Saruman was already being controlled by Sauron. In the Tower of Orthanc was
one of the seven seeing stones of Arnor, called the Palantir. The Palantir
could &quot;see&quot; into far away lands. Saruman reached into Mordor and was
captured by Sauron, who has the supreme Palantir that was taken from Minas
Ithil. So, Sauron could see everything Saruman saw, and he knew everything
Saruman knew, although Saruman wasn't loyal to neither the White Council nor
Sauron because he desired the Ring of Power himself. Saurman's treachery
wasn't revealed until he captured Gandalf at Isengard. All of the Istart
(wizards) failed, except Gandalf. That's why he was sent back to
Middle-earth as Gandalf the White, after he slayed the Balrog of Morgoth.
Gandalf finally overthrows Saruman, strips him of his color, and breaks his
staff. In the end, Gandalf sails back to Valinor with the other elvish
ring-bearers, who were Elrond and Galadriel, Frodo, and his uncle Bilbo.&gt;&gt;

King Henry V Act 4, Scene 7

FLUELLEN Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower.
What call you the town's name where Alexander the PIG was born!

FLUELLEN Why, I pray you, is not PIG great? the PIG,
or the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the
magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phrase
is a little variations.

Titus Andronicus Act 4, Scene 2

AARON The empress, the midwife, and yourself:
Two may keep counsel when the third's away:
Go to the empress, tell her this I said.

[He kills the nurse]

Weke, weke! so cries a PIG prepared to the spit.

Macbeth Act 4, Scene 1

The capon burns, the PIG falls from the spit,
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;

Act 2, Scene 1

DROMIO OF EPHESUS I mean not cuckold-mad;
But, sure, he is stark mad.
When I desired him to come home to dinner,
He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;
'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
'The PIG,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:
'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'

The Merchant of Venice Act 4, Scene 1

SHYLOCK Some men there are love not a gaping PIG;
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
Why he cannot abide a gaping PIG;
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
Must yield to such inevitable shame
As to offend, himself being offended;
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?

SAR(u)MAN

_The Sufi Basis of The Taming of The Shrew_ by Mather Walker

&lt;&lt;According to George Gurdjieff, who emerged from central Asia during
the early part of the 20th century with a system composed mostly of Sufi
knowledge, there exists, in a mountainous area, a few days journey from
Bokhara a very ancient Brotherhood (whose original existence goes
back to at least 2,500 B.C.) which possesses great knowledge,
particularly about man and his paraphysical potentialities.

The name of this brotherhood (Sarmoung or SARMAN) means BEE.

These are the people who collect the precious 'HONEY' of
traditional wisdom and preserve it for future generations.&gt;&gt;
