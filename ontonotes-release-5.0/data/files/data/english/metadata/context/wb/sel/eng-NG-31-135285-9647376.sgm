Howdy everyone, the topic for our next meeting is &quot;Coding
fundamentals for non-programmers&quot;. The idea behind this is not to
teach a programming language, rather it is to provide a foundation
for people who haven't programmed, or haven't had a formal education
in programming. Some questions that may well fit into the presentation:
- What are good and bad practices?
- What are some of the basic pitfalls that a new programmer should
avoid?
- What are the phases that a good programmer follows for a project?

If you are interested in this great opportunity to share your
experience with your peers by presenting on this topic, please drop
me an e-mail in the next couple of days.

Thanks!

We still need a presenter. I know we have some rocking programmers in
the group, who could share their knowledge. You don't have to be an
experienced speaker, just willing to talk. :)

I could do something here. There's a few holes that people picking up
programming just dont need to fall into. And some good habits that will
serve you well. Unless we have someone that's got real experience
specificaly with teaching at this level, it think this topic would be best
covered by 2 or 3 short intros by different people - approaching it from
different angles. Maybe one doing a fundamentals intro - variables,
conditionals, loops, functions/subroutines (nuts and bolts), someone doing
something on best practices / bad practices; the progamming &quot;lifecycle&quot; of
definition, pseudo-code - some tricks for stating the problem and managing
complexity (howto), QA/QC concepts; and maybe a whistle stop tour of some
progamming languages / environments - I'm thinking just a minute or 2 on
maybe: java, perl, ruby, c#, javascript - what they are used for, what
characterizes them. We could throw in the visual programming in Lego
Mindstorms to see the same concepts done in a different way
The goal of the session would be to demystify programming (you dont need a
CS degree to do it, in fact most programmers dont) and to spark an interest
and lay a foundation for further study.

I'd love to give a talk about RadiantCMS ( http://www.radiantcms.org/ ),
which I've used on a number of projects. Radiant is a great framework
for designers because it makes it relatively easy to create dynamic
content with a very little amount of code. I wrote a tutorial on
Radiant a while back ( http://www.artofmission.com/articles/2006/06/06/
radiant-cms/).

Some sites I've done in Radiant:
* http://studentlife.biola.edu
* http://www.hawkinscosmeticdentistry.com/home
* http://www.hkheneise.com
* http://www.haitihopefund.org
* http://www.ucnh.org/

Unfortunately, I can't come on the 15th my family will be celebrating
Adoption Day ( http://www.nationaladoptionday.org/ ). However, I'd love
to give this talk another time if there is interest.

Thanks,

Very cool Sam! I like the way you broke it down, though I think we
should reduce the amount of topics we cover in one night as there is
a lot in what you mentioned. Perhaps we can spend the first half of
the meeting covering language-agnostic fundamental intro - the nuts
and bolts that you mentioned, and the second half covering the
different types of languages (the whistle stop tour), providing
information on the differences between types (scripted versus
compiled) and a breakdown of the most popular languages.

Sam, would you be up for that? We can keep the meeting very
conversational as we have in the past, with the presentation
providing a discussion framework.

I think Quality Assurance/Quality Control /Testing Practices could be
a great follow up meeting down the road, and the Lego Mindstorms
would be a neat part of a Roundup meeting that isn't focused on tools
as much as sharing cool toys and distractions.

We will have a Roundup meeting in December, so everyone can share
their useful tips tricks and tools.

Very cool, thanks Ryan! I'll add you to the list of presenter
options. Perhaps we can do a meeting around a few different CMSes,
with each presenter talking about their CMS of choice, and why they
chose it. This might be a good meeting for January.

Just a reminder -- the November meeting is next Tuesday, Nov 13th at 7:00.

The meeting will be held at Texpresso again. (I called today to confirm the
reservation.) Texpresso is the coffee shop in the same parking lot as the
Alamo Drafthouse Village.

Ok sounds good. I'd like to recruit a co-presenter though. Preferably
someone with more server-side and/or desktop experience or just a different
style to keep it engaging.

Who actually requested this topic? Do we want a 101 kind of introduction to
programming basics - common syntax, etc. Or more general, higher level talk
about techniques, best practices and so on?

We could do both in a rapid fire kind of format - but that might get
confusing for anyone that isnt already somewhat familiar with this area.

Big +1 to QA/QC as a topic btw.

I don't recall who originally asked for this topic, or if I added to
the survey as I built it. It was one of the higher scoring topics
though. Let's aim for a101 intro presentation leading into a
discussion of techniques and best practices.

Is anyone up for co-presenting with Sam?

As someone in the target audience (i.e., a non-programmer) I would vote to
stay at a simpler beginner level. Programmers tend to forget how mystifying
and dense a lot of this appears to &quot;the rest of us.&quot;

What I would like to hear about (some of these points Sam mentioned
earlier):

- differentiators/strengths of different languages -- when should you
use Perl, for example, as opposed to something else?
- common elements -- what are the fundamental elements of each
language? (the equivalent to tags, selectors, and attributes if this were a
CSS intro)
- the programming process, or lifecycle -- steps and phases of a
programming project.

Would anyone else like to see something on authoring tools (e.g. Adobe's
Dreamweaver and Flash) that enable non-programmers to do simple programming
and how use of these tools can lead you to aquire skills to work directly
with things like PHP or Action Script? Could anyone please present on these
topics?

Ok, fundamentals it is.
There are lots of tools that write code for you while you make selections
and drop/drop stuff in a graphical user interface. I cant cover these
myself, but perhaps someone else can do a quick demo of a tool they use?
One of the goals for the talk will be to connect up the dots between these 2
paradigms. Programming isnt necessarily about writing code. Its about making
things happen. Often, to get the fine-grained control you need you end up
writing code, but many many tasks are doable, and sometime significantly
easier with a visual tool.
You'll quickly get out of your depth though if you start down this path with
no clue what you are doing.

those of us who will be out of town, will there be a slide show posted

I've just landed here by way of one of the Austin programming meetup
groups. Whew! Finding new groups all the time.

I'm a student at UT and a 1099 web developer, and i've been
considering offering something along the lines of an intro programming
&quot;demystification&quot; presentation/informal course for a while now. It
hurts to see how many web design people just haven't been introduced
to the very basics, which has had me thinking about it for a while.
Just a little bit makes such a difference!

This is late notice, but if you'd be interested i can run a very
general explanation up through your choice of languages. I know a lot
of you are likely interested in PHP for web development, and it would
be pretty easy for me to drag along the MacBook and work through some
basics on Apache/PHP 5 as an example language. If PHP's already got
coverage, i'd be happy to run through with another language. Java
might be good, or something higher like Ruby.

Alternately, i could do an overview of the different levels of
programming languages (Assembly vs. Low-level vs. Bytecode-compiled
vs. Interpreted), or a light introduction to programming paradigms
(functional, procedural, imperative, object oriented, etc.), or a wide-
berth explanation of how the input/output mechanism powers computers
from the bottom up.

I'm young, but i've been doing this a while.
Let me know... short notice is fine, but i'll want to cook something
up and run through it once or twice on my own.

I'm brand new to the group (landed here off a meetup link), a student,
and a 1099 web developer.

If you'd like, i can whip up something broad covering the types and
choices in programming languages (high v. low level, object-oriented
v. functional, etc.), and maybe provide a bigger, more integrated
picture of how the input/output and client/server models combine to
create an entire system (from OS X Automator down to the command line
tools). If you're more interested in how the theory actually plays out
in visible code, we can write a few simple one-offs in Java, Ruby,
python, PHP5, etcetera.

I'll need a little bit of of notice. I'd like to run through it once
or twice before taking it to a new group :-)

I've been thinking about offering something like this for a while.
It hurts to see how much web designers i've worked could get from just
a little bit of programming understanding!

Howdy Kyle, thanks for volunteering to help! Sam will be presenting
tonight, so I'll leave it up to him as to whether or not there will
be an opportunity for another presenter, but it may be a bit tight
for you two to coordinate in time as the meting is about seven hours
from now. :) Our meetings tend to be pretty conversational though, so
there should be ample opportunity to share your expertise and
experience.

This seems like a popular topic, so odds are good that we will have a
follow-up meeting as well, so it's great to have another resource
interested in contributing!

It should be a great meeting tonight, I look forward to seeing everyone!

Ooops. missed this thread - had gmail open all day bit didnt notice it
accumulating. Sorry Kyle, I wasnt deliberately blanking you.

As it turns out, we easily filled 2 hours with just the broad concepts,
without getting into anything language specific. So I think there's still
room for the kind of introduction you're proposing in another talk.
It might be interesting to take a task, and see it built out by different
people in different ways, and give people a way to compare apple with
apples.

I hadn't a full grasp of the format at the time.

and 2 dense hours, at that!

i thought your presentation handled the topic very well.
it's a very difficult challenge.
i remember getting started was a very odd combination of digging
concepts out of the language details and vice-versa.
it's hard to emulate that in any amount of time. best, i think, to

i've offered to do a bare-bones ruby intro, and met with approval.

I'm thinking what i can do is make a basic script in ruby with zero
expected previous knowledge, all the while doing side-by-sides with
hard-core functional languages like Lisp, Haskell, R, and Erlang, with
a final side-by-side comparison of the complete ruby script to
equivalent scripts in the other languages. By that point the new
programmers, too, should have enough grasp of the functional style to
at least make sense of the alternate language code.

that ought to give the new programmers the full tour they need without
leaving the seasoned programmers fallow (or at least those that
haven't been doing functional work).

Maybe it won't work.
In any case, that's a way off.

Again, thanks for your presentation!

I'd like an intro to ruby (seperate from an intro to ruby on rails). I know
a lot of perl folks have gone over to using ruby, and a presentation on its
syntax, idioms, strengths and weaknesses would be great. If we're going to
compare and contrast, I'd personally be more intersted in seeing the same
script in perl, php, javascript, java, vb/vbscript, python - as those are
more likely my alternatives in this day and age. (no I'm not expecting you
to write in all of these!)

Yes, it might be instructive for people new to programming, but also bear in
mind not every talk is for everyone. If there's interest in a deep-dive into
the technical stuff, we'll post the topic outline, and those not interested
will just skip it.

Like you say its a ways off. But lets put it on the list. In the meantime,
we sometimes do more informal get-togethers - meeting in a bar or cafe to
chat about stuff. We could do that too.

Thanks Kyle, for offering an intro to Ruby. I'm very interested too. I
agree with Sam that a comparison to mainstream languages  would be
most helpful. I'd think we could find a small set of languages that
are common to the audience to use for comparison-- out of Sam's list
my personal vote would be for any of these: Perl, PHP, Javascript, or
Java. Kyle, I am curious about your mention of R. The R I'm familiar
with is specific to statistical analysis ( http://www.r-project.org/ ).
Is there another more general purpose language named R?

&gt; &gt; &gt; different people in different ways, and give people a way to compare
&gt; &gt; &gt; apple with apples.

&gt; &gt; i've offered to do a bare-bones ruby intro, and met with approval.

&gt; &gt; I'm thinking what i can do is make a basic script in ruby with zero
&gt; &gt; expected previous knowledge, all the while doing side-by-sides with
&gt; &gt; hard-core functional languages like Lisp, Haskell, R, and Erlang, with
&gt; &gt; a final side-by-side comparison of the complete ruby script to
&gt; &gt; equivalent scripts in the other languages. By that point the new
&gt; &gt; programmers, too, should have enough grasp of the functional style to
&gt; &gt; at least make sense of the alternate language code.

&gt; &gt; that ought to give the new programmers the full tour they need without
&gt; &gt; leaving the seasoned programmers fallow (or at least those that
&gt; &gt; haven't been doing functional work).

&gt; &gt; Maybe it won't work.
&gt; &gt; In any case, that's a way off.

&gt; &gt; Again, thanks for your presentation!

I'm probably not the most fluent ruby developer at Refresh (i noticed
one of the guys is working in a rails shop), but Ruby seemed the
natural choice, both for ease of use and because some of the more
seasoned programmers could take the functional angle with it. A little
something for everyone.

...

Yes, statistical R.
I had a friend bother me once about R programming for some research he
was into.
Mostly what i've seen nowadays is Mathematica for computation, but i
dug deep enough to notice that for a special-purpose language, R does
lend itself to a &quot;functional&quot; style.

It was fresh in mind, so it ended up in the email. Probably not
something i'll ever run across again, but it was a fun diversion for a
few days.
