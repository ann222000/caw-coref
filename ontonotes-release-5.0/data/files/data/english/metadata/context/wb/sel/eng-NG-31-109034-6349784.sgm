Since the members of this group are enamoured  with the possibility of
Hitler and the Nazis getting atomic bombs ----

aren't we interested in the possibility of the Pope getting the A-Bomb
first?

Pope Pius 7 was browbeat and kidnapped by Napoleon 1 and so Holy Mother
Church grows determined that she  will protect her pontiff against such
threats from secular leaders. To the dismay of Pope and Curia, Pius 9
loses worldly control of central Italy and considers himself the
"prisoner of the Vatican."

One of Pius 9's successors gets interested in the extreme theories about
splitting the atom. The Popes lack of divisions in the real world
hampers the fear and respect that the Vatican needs to be a Real Power
in the 20th Century. The Super Bomb could substitute for those
non-existant divisions.  The Society of Jesus starts its nuclear
research program more than 2 decades before anybody else . , , , ,,

The Vatican flag changes to white background , upon which is the Papal
Tiara over crossed missles of gold.  With the Vatican the first nuclear
Power, where does the world proceed from that Point of Divergence?

Enrico Fermi, S.J.?

Without a wife, Fermi doesn't flee to America.  In OTL, Laura Capón
Fermi was Jewish, and after picking up his Nobel in Stockholm in 1938,
the couple split for the USA, to avoid Mussolini's new anti-Semitic
laws.  In the ATL he doesn't flee, except perhaps behind the Vatican
walls.

different things, too.  Now, a battle flag or uniform insignia for the

(Tongue kept firmly in cheek). A bomb making facility is too big to fit
into Vatican city: the Pope needs to have his plant on the soil of a
nation loyal to the Church, too small to have much in the way of
world-conquest ambitions of it's own, but not located where it would be
easy for a dictatorial power to invade and sieze the facilities.

"The Italian physicist Enrico Fermi received the Nobel Prize in 1938
for two aspects of his work: the slow neutron technique and the
"discovery" of "transuranium elements." These two aspects suffered
quite different fates. The slow neutron technique proved useful in
future work. However, the "transuranium elements" that he thought he
had detected were misinterpretations of his experimental results.
Instead of creating new elements, heavier than uranium, he was
splitting the uranium atom, thereby producing smaller, lighter
elements. Other physicists soon sorted out the mistake, leading to the
discovery of fission, the process used to make the atomic bomb (Weart
1983). Fermi accepted the reinterpretation of his results and went on
to contribute to further work leading to the use of fission in the
atomic bomb (Segre 1970)."

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was a Jesuit, and he was alive during WW2.
Although I don't think his scientific talents would be of much use in
a Vatican nuclear program ; paleontology, geology, and zoology wouldn't
be of much use in making a Bomb. Teillhard had studied and taught
physics, but he'd really be out of his league here.

(Was Mendel a Jesuit? Doesn't matter much if he was, as he'd died in
1884 )

ISTM priest-scientists are more common in the biological sciences
than in physics.

However, the membership of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences had
(and has) quite a few big names:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Academy_of_Sciences

Erwin Schrodinger lived in Italy in the late 30s, after fleeing Austria
after
the Anschluss and before moving to Ireland. He might have been of
use for a Vatican nuclear program,

You might want to look at

&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teilhard_de_Chardin &gt; and
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V._Coyne &gt;, both of whom were active
rather more recently than 1680. So far as I'm aware Coyne's still alive.

Your original question was, and I quote: "Using what talent? In the history
of the S.O.J. have there ever been any world-class priest scientists?" You
asked for scientists, I gave you scientists.

And some of 'em were chemists. I'm sure they knew how to make explosives.

Erwin Schrodinger was a fundamentally good man, but there are some
details in his personal life that would make it unlikely that the
Vatican would commission him as a member of a nuclear research project.

First,  Schrodinger was a polygamist. He had two wives and never
promised that he would eschew a third one,  Gossip had it that he was
"interviewing" for a third wife with the approval of the other two.

Second, he was a distinctly unorthodox Catholic, though I don't think he
ever repudiated the Church.  Some observers thought he was more of a
Hindu than a Catholic.

Pius 11 was a meddling manager, notorious  for encouraging "back-door
channels" so that dissidents could sneak behind their superiors and
report to the Pontiff direct. In practice, Pope Pius 11's managerial
style encouraged rivalry, backstabbing, intrigue, and paranoia. In such
an atmosphere there is a zero per cent chance that the Holy Father would
fail to learn that the atomic program was in the hands of a layman with
multiple wives. Pius monitored theological doctrines of Protestant
churches and got peeved about the "mistakes" he thought they made. What
do you think Pius would think of  Schrodinger's  Hindu assumption that
God is the aggregate of humanity?

In sum, Schrodinger is unlikely to be invited to a Vatican atomic
project.

On the other hand,  Mr &amp; Mrs &amp; Mrs Schrondinger might be very interested
in an offer from Utah Territory in the USA.  The "moralists" of the 47
states may prevent Utah from upgrading to a State because the Mormons
still have not denounced or stopped the practice of polygamy. But that
will not make much a a difference to the Schrondingers. They will have a
honored place at Brigham Young University.
