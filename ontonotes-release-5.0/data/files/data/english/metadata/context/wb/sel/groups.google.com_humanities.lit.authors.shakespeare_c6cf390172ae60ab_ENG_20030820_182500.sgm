Shakespeare for the ears
Expansive collection brings all his plays together on CD

Robert Hurwitt, Chronicle Theater Critic Sunday, August 17,

To Bard or not to Bard? That may not be the question most people
contemplate when choosing what to pop into the CD player while
heading for the mountains or the beach. But at least now it's an
option.

For the first time, all 38 of the plays written in whole or in
part by William Shakespeare are available on CD in a remarkable
new issue from a group calling itself the Audio Partners
Publishing Corp. &quot;The Complete Arkangel Shakespeare,&quot; produced by
Tom Treadwell and Bill Shepherd (Arkangel Productions) and
directed by Clive Brill, is not only the first attempt at
recording all of Shakespeare's plays in some four decades, it's
also the most comprehensive ever.

It's a huge project: 98 CDs containing the complete, unabridged
texts of 38 plays for a total listening time of almost 102 hours.
Brill, a former BBC director and producer who cast and directed
each recording, spent 4 1/2 years recording the scripts in London
with a company of 400 actors, most past or present members of the
Royal Shakespeare Company.

It's expensive, at $600 (with an unusual lifetime replacement
guarantee for lost or damaged CDs). It's also a very high-quality
product. The language, of course, is incomparable. The stature of
most of the titles included -- &quot;Hamlet, &quot;&quot;King Lear,&quot;&quot;Twelfth
Night,&quot;&quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; et al. -- speaks for itself,
as does the artistic excellence of many of the actors: Eileen
Atkins, Jennifer Ehle, Joseph Fiennes, Simon Russell Beale and
Amanda Root, not to mention Sir John Gielgud in what was possibly
his last performance.

&quot;I had a ball,&quot; Brill said over the phone from the south coast of
Turkey, where he was vacationing with his wife and children.
&quot;Four and a half years of doing what I consider the best work
ever written with pretty much most of the best actors we have
today. There was no madness in it, just complete wonderment that
I was ever given the chance. My only worry is that no one will
ever be able to offer me a better job.&quot;

The strengths of the recordings are immediately evident. The
voices are strong and the diction almost unfailingly clear. Based
on the many hours I spent with the set -- listening to a few full
plays and long or brief samples of many others -- Brill has
created crisply paced, intelligently rendered and often
dramatically compelling audio versions of the plays.

They aren't exciting new interpretations of the works, nor do
they record some of the great stage performances of recent years.
Brill's intent was quite different, to present the plays as
purely aural experiences. &quot;Most directors achieve their style or
their take on the play by making cuts,&quot; he said. &quot;I couldn't do
that. So one of our ways was to develop a different musical style
and a sound for every piece.&quot;

Composer Dominique Le Gendre draws on an eclectic range of styles
to create distinct ambient music and song settings. More
significant, often, is the use of sound effects. There are
obvious disadvantages to listening to a play that was written to
be staged, but Brill finds advantages as well. The slapstick
comedy and implied sight gags get lost, as do some of
Shakespeare's most potent visual effects (Brill makes a rare
compromise in &quot;Hamlet&quot; by having the stage directions for the
&quot;play's the thing&quot; dumb show read aloud, but not, alas, the &quot;Exit
pursued by a bear&quot; from &quot;The Winter's Tale&quot;).

Scenes that unduly strain the suspension of disbelief onstage,
however, come off better in this format. The shipboard storm that
opens &quot;The Tempest&quot; is vividly rendered in fierce gusts, waves,
straining ropes and desperate, wind-muffled voices. What the
great fencing bouts lack in drama here -- or comedy, in the case
of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; -- is made up for by the greater
verisimilitude of those hard-to-stage battle scenes.

Then there are the sound effects that add some delightful
dimensions. Messengers arrive on galloping horses. Prospero's
elves and Oberon and Titania's fairies speak in echo-enhanced
voices that magically shift locations.

The scratching of Bottom's coarse-haired ears evokes his ass'
head better than many a mask.

Sometimes Brill makes odd choices. Jamie Glover delivers Henry
V's &quot;Once more into the breach&quot; speech more as a thinking-through
soliloquy than inspired battlefield oration, creating a
distracting dissonance between style and content. Brill's similar
approach to &quot;Hamlet&quot; works better in Beale's beautifully phrased
performance, recorded before he'd been cast in his highly praised
National Theatre outing (&quot;He told me he used our tape to help
learn the lines,&quot; Brill noted).

&quot;Hamlet is one of those parts that in my view works best if it's
very intense and very closely miked, like one long soliloquy,&quot;
Brill said. &quot;When you see it onstage, I think some of the power
of the language is inevitably lost.&quot; One needn't agree with that
assessment to appreciate the particular beauties and tragic
intensity of this recording.

Not all the plays stand up as well. It isn't always clear who's
speaking in many of the large ensemble scenes and even some
featuring smaller groups. It helps to have a script on hand to
keep track. But the reverse is also true: Many a reader will find
Shakespeare's language more comprehensible and the verse easier
to navigate after listening to these recordings.

That can be a bit problematic for those using different editions
from the ones used here. There is no such thing as a definitive
text for many of the plays, any more than there is agreement on
how many Shakespeare wrote. The first &quot;complete&quot; collection --
the famed Folio -- included 36. &quot;Pericles&quot; gradually gained
acceptance to make 37. More recently, &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; has
been added as well, with the caveat that it was largely written
by John Fletcher. Parts of &quot;Henry VIII&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; are
probably by other authors, while Shakespeare is believed to have
been one of the several writers of &quot;Sir Thomas More.&quot;

&quot;I begged to include 'Edward III,' but wasn't allowed,&quot; Brill
said, referring to the current leading candidate to join the
canon. He did, however, get to include &quot;Kinsmen&quot; -- though not
&quot;Sir Thomas More&quot; (or Shakespeare's sonnets and other poems).

For those who wish to read along: The Arkangel project uses &quot;The
Complete Pelican Shakespeare&quot; except for &quot;Kinsmen&quot; (not included
in the Pelican), for which it uses the Oxford Shakespeare. But
Pelican published a new edition just last year, after the
recordings had been made, and some of the new texts -- &quot;Hamlet,&quot;
for example, and &quot;Macbeth,&quot;&quot;Othello&quot; and others -- differ from
those used by Brill. For many of the plays, the differences are
minor and reader-listeners can get by with any good edition.
Where there are huge discrepancies between texts -- as in
&quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot; -- the problem gets stickier.

Few of the plays are ever staged without cuts, which makes it a
rare pleasure to hear the complete texts (though the experience
can justify many of the most common excisions, even in the
relatively short &quot;Macbeth&quot;). On the other hand, Brill's use of
exotic accents for some characters -- David Harewood's Oberon and
Adjoa Andoh's Titania, for example, or Don Warrington's West
African Othello and David Threlfall's cockney Iago -- undermines
the music of some of the great verse. Warrington and Threlfall
more than make up for that with the seductive intensity and
inflamed intimacy of Othello's fall.

Few of the performances are poor, though some are disappointing.
David Troughton's Richard III seems obvious and only half thought
through. Jonathan Firth's Orsino in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; lacks
spontaneity and is no match for Niamh Cusack's and Amanda Root's
fresher Viola and Olivia (or Julian Glover's fatuous Malvolio).
Michael Feast's Julius Caesar is weak, though the dueling
orations of John Bowe's Brutus and Adrian Lester's Mark Antony
are delivered with exhilarating guile, force and immediacy.

Some of the performances are truly outstanding. Trevor Peacock is
a commanding, comfortably impetuous Lear whose descent into
soul-ravaged defeat is gripping and pitiful, beautifully
supported by Penny Downie and Samantha Bond as the evil Goneril
and Regan and Julia Ford's touching Cordelia. Joseph Fiennes
makes an engaging segue from Shakespeare to Romeo in love, his
scenes with Maria Miles' Juliet quivering with ecstatic
eroticism. Hugh Ross and Harriet Walker are chillingly urgent,
driven Macbeths, with a brilliant comic, favor-currying Porter
monologue by David Tennant (also a dynamic Mercutio and an
affecting Edgar in &quot;Lear&quot;).

Brill's &quot;Winter's Tale&quot; is a particular delight, with the vivid
Leontes and Hermione of Ciaran Hinds and Sinead Cusack and an
indelibly forceful Eileen Atkins as Paulina. It may, however, be
more remembered historically as the last recorded Shakespearean
performance by the great Gielgud, who plays the chorus, Time, in
a tired, measured voice -- noticeably more infirm than his
stately, measured speech as the narrator of &quot;Pericles.&quot;

&quot; 'Winter's Tale' was the last play we recorded,&quot; Brill said,
&quot;and he died two months later, though I'm told he squeezed in one
more television appearance in between. I did 'Pericles' halfway
through the cycle, and the change was extraordinary, everything
about him. We laid on this big lunch with 'Pericles,' and he held
forth at the end of the table, eating egg and cress sandwiches
and telling great anecdotes about his leading ladies. At
'Winter's Tale,' it took him 15 minutes to get from the door to
the studio. But like all great actors, when the green light came
on, he came alive.&quot;

In truth, Gielgud's performances here add little to his stature
as one of the 20th century's paramount Shakespeareans. But his
presence adds some luster to a remarkably ambitious and, on the
whole, impressively realized project.
