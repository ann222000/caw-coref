Avoiding Privatization of Resources : Prosperity for the Developing World

Before they go to their final reward, every economist of high standing says,
"Henry George had it right." Standing the test of time and the world's best
minds, his philosophy said, "As no one's labor produced land and it is a
gift of nature in which all are entitled to their share, it is social
wealth. Society should collect the landrent and each receives their fair
share of nature's wealth through that social income replacing all other
taxes and paying the operating costs of all levels of government, federal,
state, and local." - Dr. J.W. Smith

Land Monopolization: Land, and all that is on or under land, is nature's
wealth of which every citizen is entitled to their share. Under exclusive
title to land, a residue of aristocratic property rights, the landlord (a
clue to that aristocratic origin) captures the landrent. Just as under
aristocracy, no allowance is made for others' rights to their share of what
is obviously nature's wealth.

Before they go to their final reward, every economist of high standing says,
"Henry George had it right." Standing the test of time and the world's best
minds, his philosophy said, "As no one's labor produced land and it is a
gift of nature in which all are entitled to their share, it is social
wealth. Society should collect the landrent and each receives their fair
share of nature's wealth through that social income replacing all other
taxes and paying the operating costs of all levels of government, federal,
state, and local."

In the wealthier oil-producing nations, people do not pay taxes and are
likely allotted land rather than paying for it. But I guarantee you that the
rental value of land will develop right along with the development of your
economy. How much will you pay for a home on a nice sandy beach and how much
will you pay for that same home in a crowded suburb? How much will you pay
for a retail outlet in the center of a city which will earn you $10,000 a
day and how much will you pay for one on the edge of town which will earn
you $100 a day? How much will you pay for a farm with rich soil close to
markets and how much will you pay for one far from markets with poor soil?

That difference you are willing to pay represents the rental value of land
and those location and wealth values are there no matter what philosophy a
society is structured under. If you do not allot that land by rental value,
it will be allotted by corrupt political power. I say corrupt because having
such power to distribute the total wealth of a nation will corrupt virtually
anyone.

Corruption will not be the only costs. Without the rental costs of land
factored in, a countries' distribution mechanism will be highly arbitrary
and inefficient. With land distribution through political power, those
values are still there, massive funds will be paid under the table, their
will be battles between clans over turf similar to the mafia battles in
America.

Efficient land distribution through society colleting rental values sweeps
those struggles and inefficiencies aside. Each citizen owns the land their
home sits on and, through society spending landrent on governing and social
needs, receives their share of the wealth produced from all resources on or
under land (oil, iron ore, gold, timber, etc.). This achieves a country's
goal of full and equal rights for all.

As the most efficient can pay the highest resource (land) rent, the most
efficient farmers will own and operate the farms, the most efficient
businesspeople will own and operate businesses, and the most efficient
entrepreneurs will own and operate industries.

With each having rights to land for personal use and their share of the
wealth produced by nature on or under all land, those huge blocs of capital
capitalism is worshipped for vanish and reappear as equally-shared
use-values. Instead of earned wealth, they were at all times the capitalized
values of the wealth annually appropriated through private collection of
landrents or rental values collected within other monopolies (banking,
technology, communications) in which there is little tangible wealth
produced by labor but massive wealth appropriated through capitalizing
rental values.

Keep your eyes on those huge blocs of capital within capitalism which has
the world mesmerized. They are nothing more than the capitalized value of
wealth appropriated through exclusive titles to nature's resources and
technologies. Change those exclusive titles to Henry George's conditional
titles (society collect [capture] those rental values) and those huge blocs
of unearned wealth are instantly transposed into relatively equally-shared
use-values. Under those full and equal rights, economic efficiency increases
equal to the invention of money, the printing press, and electricity and
each need work only 2 to 3 days per week even as the average quality of life
rises rapidly.

Monopolization of Technology (patents): Technology is a part of nature
waiting to be discovered. Consider the costs to the consumer if fire, the
wheel, gears, levers, etc. were held under exclusive patent titles requiring
payment of royalties. Due to patents monopolizing technology, those
obviously high costs are added to the price of all consumer products today.
Pay inventors a capitalized value for their inventions, place that
technology in the public domain alongside of fire, wheels, gears, pulleys,
levers, and millions of other inventions already free to use, and the cost
of consumer products will drop by at least half (our research suggests 75%).
Patent profits are collected through the stock market and the above
suggested change in patent law would eliminate fully 85% of the gambling
casinos called stock markets. Remaining would be an efficient stock market,
similar to a bond market, buying and selling real values. It is the
elimination of that ethereal financial world and all finance capital funding
the real economy where those efficiency gains are claimed.

Communication Monopolies: Radio, TV, cell phone, and broadband spectrums are
a part of the wealth of nature which were discovered many decades ago. As we
speak, the American Congress is parceling out exclusive titles to choice
spectrums to cell phone companies. The $2 billion expected from that sale is
dwarfed by the hundreds of billions, even trillions, of dollars in savings
to the public if a reasonable share of those spectrums remained in the
public domain.

WiFi technology with 10 times the capacity for 10% the cost (meaning 1% the
cost per unit of capacity), is here today. That capacity can handle each
person's broadband connection, phone, TV, radio, and beamed movies, all for
possibly $20 a month as opposed to current costs of $70 to $95 a month for
just broadband and phone connection.

Under WiFi efficiency, phone and cable companies will disappear. TV and
Radio beamed over WiFi will reach consumers direct. With no need for
satellite stations, 90% of the TV and radio stations will have to produce
their own material. With the popular programs reaching their audience over
WiFi, most other stations will fail to draw a paying audience. Interest
groups, Georgists, environmentalists, peace groups, etc., with their own
built-in audience, will be able to pick up those stations for pennies on the
dollar. Stations worldwide can reach the American audience and American
stations can reach WiFi wired citizens worldwide.

Here is where those premium spectrums able to penetrate trees, walls, even
mountains, and currently being auctioned off to cell phone companies, are so
valuable. Those choice spectrums can not only be installed for half the cost
of lower capacity spectrums, they can simultaneously carry cell phone
traffic, broadband, radio, TV, and movies. This means those spectrum sales
are blatant plans to monopolize those valuable sectors of nature's wealth.
On top of the above savings, spectrums reserved for product or service
databases can replace advertising which is a major part of the several
hundred dollars per month per consumer the monopolized communications
industry currently collects.

If that monopolization can be avoided, again huge blocs of monopolized
wealth are transposed into equally-shared use-values. All wealth is
processed from resources. Most those resources are in the impoverished
world. Ally together, protect those resources through Henry George's
conditional titles (society collecting [capturing]rental values), negotiate
access to your resources for access to technology, and you will have
converted current patent monopolies into public domain resources, and you
can go on to develop a productive, wealthy, economy.

Money and Banking Monopolies: The Technology of money was discovered 5,000
years ago. The skills of banking were learned over the centuries since.
Outside of a little brick and mortar, there is nothing within an honest
banking system to own. Yet a banking license will develop a value of
hundreds of millions or even hundreds of billions of dollars. As there is
nothing within those values built by labor, there is nothing there to own, a
country's banking system should be socially owned. Just as resource rents,
banking profits should go to society. Just as resource rents pay governing
costs, banking profits should go towards other social needs (infrastructure,
communication, education) The huge blocs of unearned monopolized capital
have been converted to equally-shared use-values.

Secondary Monopolies: The monopolization of insurance, health care, law,
etc., are eliminated by full and equal rights such as some countries are now
guaranteeing their citizens. Again huge blocs of unearned monopolized
capital are transposed into equally-shared use-values.

Within the monopolized world, I will be challenged that those blocs of
capital are necessary to run an economy. Not so. Every bloc of capital that
disappeared had only been buying and selling values that had been
appropriated, by the mechanism of exclusive titles, from true producers.
Those false values are no longer there even as real values, meaning
use-values, increase.

Not only do values honestly earned through true production remain, any need
for finance capital can be covered by created money. By a central bank
recording the figures into a Treasury account and spending that money for
social needs or loaning it for productive uses necessary money is created.
However, this can only be done if a small nation is allied with other small
nations to form a trading bloc and this you must do. Currently the money
creation process is being used by imperial nations to buy your resources and
you must ally together to gain that right for yourself.

Worshiping the huge blocs of capital in the imperial centers is worshipping
the theft of one's own wealth. Applying Henry George's conditional titles to
nature's wealth throughout the developing world, ally as one trading bloc,
trade access to your resources for access to technology and training, create
your own regional trading currency, retain your cooperative trade structure,
and the currently impoverished world will become prosperous.

All through the 23 years putting this together, I understood that a
superefficient, individualized, capitalist, economy would strip the earth's
resources and there would be massive chaos. Evolution did not design the
human animal for an individualized life. We are designed for communitarian
living but to use those words within the capitalist world is to be instantly
ostracized. Only in the forthcoming editions have I figured out how to
address the necessity of a communitarian society such as a few third world
countries are establishing. Only a communitarian structure can guide the
energies and need for identity of the human animal into peaceful channels.

Our research concludes that the elimination of four primary monopolies are
crucial, banking, land, technology (patents), and communications. The
elimination of each is equally important. When they are eliminated, all
secondary monopolies stand exposed and will quickly disappear.
