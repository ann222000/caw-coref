I didn't like the LT, so I defer on this one, obviously he brings some size,
but is he a solid cover guy? (which is going to be important, because you
figure if they're running some kind of Philly D, the CB's are going to be
out on an island at times)

Maybe the Hardest position to come in and play as a rookie besides QB, Don't
expect immediate results, just hope he turns out better down the road then
the 2 Wills and Webster so far. The Giants must think they have some
sleepers at LT and LB, unless they plan on picking up scraps from the other
teams tables in preseason.

I think he needs some weight. I am 6'1" and 198. Aaron appears a bit thin to
me.

Could he possibly be any worse than McQuarters? And I'm not prepared to
give up on Webster just yet.

I think they addressed their biggest area of need, though the argument for
LB is a good one also.
The kid comes from a big time program.
At 6'0 he's got better size than some of the other CB's they were looking
at.
I could envision a gradual phase in with him replacing Madison/McQuarters as
the year progressed. Learning from Madison has got to be worth something

You can never have enough DB's today when you play Nickle and Dime almost as
much as your base D. But if you do not think LT and protecting Eli was not a
"Bigger area of need" than a CB or even LB I don't know what to tell you.
Lets see what the rest of the day has to offer. I hope you don't subscribe
to the  Run -of -the-mill LG Dave Deihl becoming a good LT theory.

If you're gonna play an aggressive, blitzing defense solid if not shut down
corners are essential. My considered opinion is that the G's weren't
aggressive on D last year and it hurt them.
Not sure if I totally subscribe to Diehl as the LT, you can ,make a case
that the running game definitely lulled following Luke's injury, but by the
end of the year it had returned if not improved. You can make the case that
Diehl is a + as a tackle in the running game, but a concern as a pass
blocker. I don't have all last years game son tape, which I'll do this year,
but I don't remember Eli getting blind-sided a lot once Luke went out.
Still, point taken. If Staley turns into a stud he would've been a good
pick, guess G's staff had the CB graded higher.
