We all know the primary use of a speed-detecting radar signal used by
law enforcement. The signal is bounced off vehicles in order to
measure their speed. I believe, however, that here are, a few other
(intended?, unintended? bug? feature?) by-products of such signals.

- When I drive near any mall, the signal to detect customers and open
the store doors automatically triggers a false positive in my radar
detector.

- When an ambulance is running, there is also a detectable signal
going on.

- In some toll booths the signal is also present, even though there
are no cops or anything related nearby (there is no need for the speed-
measuring aspect).

Therefore, I speculate that perhaps there is an intended use by the
radar designers. When the ambulances are running in emergency mode,
the signal is a way to tell drivers to move away, to slow down, etc.
BUT (and this is the key issue) the ambulance has no way to detect the
speed of anybody.  Some friends of mine claim -with no evidence
whatsoever- that ambulances have a signal to turn on green lights
along their route and this signal "happens" (just by sheer
coincidence) to be in the same band as the speed-detecting radar
signals.

Frankly, I find that very hard to believe. The mall door are perhaps a
coincidence (are they, really?), but the design of a remote street
light changer (with all the dangers that an unexpected asynchronous
light change implies) which by error just happens to be the same
frequency!? Come on!

I claim that the whole thing is planned: I remember reading in the
Boston news that a guy fell asleep and crashed into a toll booth,
killing the attendant. Don't know the details, but such sad accidents
could be prevented by having a radar detector triggering (NOT
measuring I insist) to turn on the beeper in the sleeping guys' car.

Any comments, informed guesses?

There's only so much RF spectrum to go around, that's all.

Your radar detector just picks up a signal, ANY signal, on a specific
frequency.   But it doesn't analyze that signal to see if it's a radar
signal, or toll booth, or mall doors.

It's like IR.  IR is a specific frequency, but you can operate your
TV, VCR, cable box, etc without interfering w/ each other.  But if you
put an IR detector among any of those devices, it would go off.

Well, traffic engineers know quite a bit about radar, its attendant
transportation and non-transportation uses, and emergency vehicle
pre-emption (EVP).

Modern EVP systems use an encrypted signal sent via a modulated 14.035
Hz wave.  If it seems low frequency, it is.  Most systems send the
signal out whenever the front strobe lights of the vehicle are
flashing (and it is obviously invisible, with visible light being
several orders of magnitude higher in frequency).

You'll occasionally see peace officers detaining a motorist, the whole
time leaving their forward strobes activated and tying up traffic in
all directions but their own (which is usually already tied up behind
them).  I had a conversation with the Cook County Sheriff's Department
one morning a few years ago after they repeatedly destroyed the
operation of a busy suburban intersection over several days.  They
would pull over speeding motorists and direct them onto a side street
for an entertainment venue that had zero traffic in the AM peak.  The
motorist and the sheriffs patrol vehicle would end up facing back out.
Because of the EVP call, the traffic signal was held in green for the
EVP max-out (about two minutes), then recalled immediately after
returning to serve the other movements.  This left the main arterials
(the cross road and the oncoming arterial) with about six seconds of
green per cycle - and no arrows for the left turns, either, since the
detector loops "tuned out" after a few of those incidents and were not
vacated to "reset" until after the AM peak had diminished.

Obviously, the only real "fix" for a problem like this, from a traffic
signal control standpoint, is to not serve an incoming EVP call until
the previous call is terminated, if the call is from the same unit.
This requires that the EVP module recognize the difference between a
fire truck and an ambulance, so that vehicles in a procession but
separated are not denied calls on the basis of the passage of a
previous vehicle.  There are pitfalls to this practice (all units must
have unique ID's), but it's probably easier than asking the cops to
turn off their forward strobes (although some agencies are very good
about strobe light and traffic advisor management, most are ignorant
of good practices).

Wouldn't a simpler explaination be that its an unlicensed spectrum which
is well suited to use for radar?

Door sensors use radar to detect people, I don't know about ambulances but
I can think of a couple of reasons they might want to be able to detect
obsticals, at the airport near here we have little cameras setup to record
number plates as cars are leaving, your toll booths could have a similar
system in place connected to a motion sensor.

I can't see the benefit of installing hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of radar gear just for the benefit of the minority who have radar
detectors. Especially when the people with the radar detectors obviously
haven't been told about it so their first instinct is to look for cameras
drawing attention away from ambulances, toll booths, etc.

Sorry, but the gizmos that turn the lights green for emergency
vehicles are OPTICAL, not RADIO. The firetrucks have what amounts to a
strobe light mounted on their roofs; it pulses light in a specific
pattern, and a photodetector mounted on the light pole overrides the
signal and turns it green in the direction of the strobe light.

None of it has anything whtsoever to do with RADAR.

I should have explained (I thought it was obvious) that when a nearby
ambulance is in emergency mode, my radar detector goes crazy. As the
ambulance goes away, the beeping of my RD slows down.

I find rather doubtful that my RD has an optical strobe light
detector. When it boots up, it clearly displays: X-Band, K-Band and
Laser. All 3 are electromagnetic radiations, but they are very far
from the strobe used by ambulances and the infrared used by street
light preempting devices.

A reader in another newsgroup confirmed my suspicion: the emergency
vehicles indeed carry a low level radar transmitter *only* whose
specific purpose is to turn on your RD, and cannot measure (or care)
about your speed. It is the high tech way of saying "out of my way!".
That device is cheap enough, specially when balanced against human
lives and property they save, Michael Heydon.

Now I understand your point. Are you saying that what is detected is
the low frequency (as it can be counted by a human being) rate, as
opposed to a certain modulated frequency, like the ones used to
distinguish a VCR remote control from a TV remote control?

What about day vs. night, obstacles, fog, etc?

If I can afford a *precise* infrared remote control made by Sony
($9.95 at Radio Shack) the police and fire departments in a life
critical jobs, certainly can.

Aha! My suspicions were correct. The strobe-light detector seemed too
crude, susceptible to errors, easy to counterfeit. Plus, you want the
street-light preempting functionality to be independent of the strobe,
visible light.

I got this from another NG (sometimes it pays to cross post):

signal out whenever the front strobe lights of the vehicle are
flashing (and it is obviously invisible, with visible light being
several orders of magnitude higher in frequency).

You'll occasionally see peace officers detaining a motorist, the whole
time leaving their forward strobes activated and tying up traffic in
all directions but their own (which is usually already tied up behind
them).  I had a conversation with the Cook County Sheriff's Department
one morning a few years ago after they repeatedly destroyed the
operation of a busy suburban intersection over several days.  They
would pull over speeding motorists and direct them onto a side street
for an entertainment venue that had zero traffic in the AM peak.  The
motorist and the sheriffs patrol vehicle would end up facing back out.
Because of the EVP call, the traffic signal was held in green for the
EVP max-out (about two minutes), then recalled immediately after
returning to serve the other movements.  This left the main arterials
(the cross road and the oncoming arterial) with about six seconds of
green per cycle - and no arrows for the left turns, either, since the
detector loops "tuned out" after a few of those incidents and were not
vacated to "reset" until after the AM peak had diminished.

Obviously, the only real "fix" for a problem like this, from a traffic
signal control standpoint, is to not serve an incoming EVP call until
the previous call is terminated, if the call is from the same unit.

This requires that the EVP module recognize the difference between a
fire truck and an ambulance, so that vehicles in a procession but
separated are not denied calls on the basis of the passage of a
previous vehicle.  There are pitfalls to this practice (all units must
have unique ID's), but it's probably easier than asking the cops to
turn off their forward strobes (although some agencies are very good
about strobe light and traffic advisor management, most are ignorant
of good practices).

&gt;&gt; &gt; We all know the primary use of a speed-detecting radar signal used
&gt;&gt; &gt; by law enforcement. The signal is bounced off vehicles in order to
&gt;&gt; &gt; measure their speed. I believe, however, that here are, a few other
&gt;&gt; &gt; (intended?, unintended? bug? feature?) by-products of such signals.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  - When I drive near any mall, the signal to detect customers and
&gt;&gt; &gt;  open
&gt;&gt; &gt; the store doors automatically triggers a false positive in my radar
&gt;&gt; &gt; detector.

&gt;&gt; Those door openers are radar tranceivers just like in a radar
&gt;&gt; gun,same operating band,too. Gunn oscillators.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  - When an ambulance is running, there is also a detectable signal
&gt;&gt; &gt; going on.

&gt;&gt; Ambulances have a low power xmtr installed so that cars with RDs
&gt;&gt; would be alerted to their approach.IIRC,the Road Rangers(emergency
&gt;&gt; breakdown service) also have them.They don't measure speed,just send
&gt;&gt; a signal.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  - In some toll booths the signal is also present, even though
&gt;&gt; &gt;  there
&gt;&gt; &gt; are no cops or anything related nearby (there is no need for the
&gt;&gt; &gt; speed- measuring aspect).

&gt;&gt; such toll booths often have speed measuring cameras to give you a
&gt;&gt; ticket for exceeding the toll plaza SL.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Therefore, I speculate that perhaps there is an intended use by the
&gt;&gt; &gt; radar designers. When the ambulances are running in emergency mode,
&gt;&gt; &gt; the signal is a way to tell drivers to move away, to slow down,
&gt;&gt; &gt; etc. BUT (and this is the key issue) the ambulance has no way to
&gt;&gt; &gt; detect the speed of anybody.

&gt;&gt; No. all the RD responds to is a radar signal in the appropriate
&gt;&gt; band,it could be a door opener,a &quot;code practice oscillator&quot;(an item
&gt;&gt; sold for sloths to set off speeders RDs,now illegal.The signal need
&gt;&gt; not be &quot;measuring speed.)

&gt;&gt; &gt;  Some friends of mine claim -with no evidence
&gt;&gt; &gt; whatsoever- that ambulances have a signal to turn on green lights
&gt;&gt; &gt; along their route and this signal &quot;happens&quot; (just by sheer
&gt;&gt; &gt; coincidence) to be in the same band as the speed-detecting radar
&gt;&gt; &gt; signals.

&gt;&gt; No,that light changing is done by IR flashing of the emergency lights
&gt;&gt; on the ambulance or police cruiser. Gated apt. complexes have them
&gt;&gt; too,so fire and EMT vehicles can enter without knowing the gate code
&gt;&gt; or needing a key. Mine does,so does the complex next door.
&gt;&gt; (Google &quot;MIRT&quot;)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Frankly, I find that very hard to believe. The mall door are
&gt;&gt; &gt; perhaps a coincidence (are they, really?), but the design of a
&gt;&gt; &gt; remote street light changer (with all the dangers that an
&gt;&gt; &gt; unexpected asynchronous light change implies) which by error just
&gt;&gt; &gt; happens to be the same frequency!? Come on!

&gt;&gt; The door openers operate by monitoring the reflected signal
&gt;&gt; level;once it reaches some level,the door is opened.There are
&gt;&gt; handheld LED devices sold online that change traffic signals from a
&gt;&gt; distance;it's now a Federal crime to possess them in a motor
&gt;&gt; vehicle,and most states also have their own laws on that.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I claim that the whole thing is planned:

&gt;&gt; You are wrong.

&gt; No, you are the one who wrongly interpreted what I wrote, Jim.

&gt; I still claim that there is a plan. There are authorities -such as the

Except there are certain LOW power apps that are less regulated.
Like door openers.They DO operate on the same band as speed radars,which
have a fairly wide band to xmit in.The DETECTORS,however do not

signal level.

&gt; There's only so much RF spectrum to go around, that's all.

&gt; Your radar detector just picks up a signal, ANY signal, on a specific
&gt; frequency.   But it doesn't analyze that signal to see if it's a radar
&gt; signal, or toll booth, or mall doors.

&gt; It's like IR.  IR is a specific frequency, but you can operate your
&gt; TV, VCR, cable box, etc without interfering w/ each other.  But if you
&gt; put an IR detector among any of those devices, it would go off.
">

Larry:

Sony can make a TV remote control that transmits exactly between 2.45
67 and 2.4568 Gigahertz (the frequencies are made up). They can
obviously make a receiver (inside the TV) which can detect precisely
that range.

The company that make the IR detector could build a detector of TV
(but not VCR or DVD) if they wanted to. However they choose to make an
IR detector with a 2.0 to 3.0 GHz range. Electronics Engineers can
manufacture a transmitter or a receiver with as narrow or wide range
as they want. The remote controls are supposed to have a narrow band.
The IR detector is supposed to have a wide band. The FCC is very
strict about devices interfering with each other, and they better be
or else nothing wireless would work at all.

They are NOT "encrypted",they just use a similar repetition rate to trigger

next to the signal.

IMO,this is disinformation.

(besides,"modulating" a VLF 14.5 hz signal would take a LONG TIME. A lot
longer than it takes for emergency vehicle to change a traffic light.)

X band radar is on a "license free" allocation near 10.5 ghz.  Door
openers, microwave car detectors,  are in a "license free" allocation
at 10.5 ghz.   A while back it was decided to add a signaling protocol
to some radar detectors  for emergencies and certain roadway warning
signs at you guessed it, 10.5 ghz.

Does that answer your observation questions?

&gt; I should have explained (I thought it was obvious) that when a nearby

&gt; Laser. All 3 are electromagnetic radiations, but they are very far
&gt; from the strobe used by ambulances and the infrared used by street
&gt; light preempting devices.

&gt; A reader in another newsgroup confirmed my suspicion: the emergency
&gt; vehicles indeed carry a low level radar transmitter *only* whose
&gt; specific purpose is to turn on your RD, and cannot measure (or care)
&gt; about your speed. It is the high tech way of saying &quot;out of my way!&quot;.
&gt; That device is cheap enough, specially when balanced against human
&gt; lives and property they save, Michael Heydon.

That could be, as an attention-getting device - after all, when your
radar detector sounds, you wake up and get back to the task of driving
the car responsibly, right?

So I can see that it's marginally feasible, but whatever radar jammer
they're running doesn't have anything to do with changing the signals.

It's a strobe with a flash rate of 14.035 flashes per second.

And if they catch you using one, they'll throw you in the clink.

Thanks for your answers, Steve. Let me see if I understood you
correctly. You say that a signaling protocol was added with the
specific use of sending a "this is an emergency, get out of the way"
signal to properly equipped RDs. If that's the case, shouldn't the
display show something like "emergency vehicle coming"? I really have
bumped into many ambulances in emergency mode, but IIRC the display
and beeping sound is the same than for a regular police patrol car.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We all know the primary use of a speed-detecting radar signal
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used by law enforcement. The signal is bounced off vehicles in
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; order to measure their speed. I believe, however, that here
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are, a few other (intended?, unintended? bug? feature?)
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by-products of such signals.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  - When I drive near any mall, the signal to detect customers
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  and open
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the store doors automatically triggers a false positive in my
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; radar detector.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Those door openers are radar tranceivers just like in a radar
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; gun,same operating band,too. Gunn oscillators.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  - When an ambulance is running, there is also a detectable
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  signal
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going on.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ambulances have a low power xmtr installed so that cars with RDs
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; would be alerted to their approach.IIRC,the Road
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rangers(emergency breakdown service) also have them.They don't
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; measure speed,just send a signal.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  - In some toll booths the signal is also present, even though
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  there
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are no cops or anything related nearby (there is no need for
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the speed- measuring aspect).

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; such toll booths often have speed measuring cameras to give you a
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ticket for exceeding the toll plaza SL.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, I speculate that perhaps there is an intended use by
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the radar designers. When the ambulances are running in
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emergency mode, the signal is a way to tell drivers to move
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away, to slow down, etc. BUT (and this is the key issue) the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ambulance has no way to detect the speed of anybody.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; No. all the RD responds to is a radar signal in the appropriate
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; band,it could be a door opener,a &quot;code practice oscillator&quot;(an
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; item sold for sloths to set off speeders RDs,now illegal.The
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; signal need not be &quot;measuring speed.)

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Some friends of mine claim -with no evidence
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whatsoever- that ambulances have a signal to turn on green
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lights along their route and this signal &quot;happens&quot; (just by
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sheer coincidence) to be in the same band as the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speed-detecting radar signals.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; No,that light changing is done by IR flashing of the emergency
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; lights on the ambulance or police cruiser. Gated apt. complexes
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have them too,so fire and EMT vehicles can enter without knowing
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the gate code or needing a key. Mine does,so does the complex
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; next door. (Google &quot;MIRT&quot;)

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frankly, I find that very hard to believe. The mall door are
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps a coincidence (are they, really?), but the design of a
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remote street light changer (with all the dangers that an
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unexpected asynchronous light change implies) which by error
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just happens to be the same frequency!? Come on!

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The door openers operate by monitoring the reflected signal
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; level;once it reaches some level,the door is opened.There are
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; handheld LED devices sold online that change traffic signals from
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a distance;it's now a Federal crime to possess them in a motor
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; vehicle,and most states also have their own laws on that.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I claim that the whole thing is planned:

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You are wrong.

&gt;&gt; &gt; No, you are the one who wrongly interpreted what I wrote, Jim.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I still claim that there is a plan. There are authorities -such as
&gt;&gt; &gt; the FCC- which assign frequencies and make thorough studies to make
&gt;&gt; &gt; sure that a signal does not affect some other application. That's
&gt;&gt; &gt; what I am talking about.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The fact that the emergency vehicles carry a device which triggers
&gt;&gt; &gt; RDs is a planned feature. The fabrication of those devices is
&gt;&gt; &gt; planned. It is not like my buddies claimed that it was just an
&gt;&gt; &gt; accidental (i.e. not planned) feature. The issues at hand are not
&gt;&gt; &gt; like the Captain Crunch whistle which happened to emit a 2600 Hz
&gt;&gt; &gt; tone that allowed toll free calls: that was NOT planned by AT&amp;T or
&gt;&gt; &gt; the whistle manufacturer.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Having said that, I claim ignorance on the mall doors. But an
&gt;&gt; &gt; ambulance or toll booth triggering my RD is not a random act of
&gt;&gt; &gt; nature: i.e.: it was planned.

&gt;&gt; There's only so much RF spectrum to go around, that's all.

&gt;&gt; Your radar detector just picks up a signal, ANY signal, on a specific
&gt;&gt; frequency.   But it doesn't analyze that signal to see if it's a
&gt;&gt; radar signal, or toll booth, or mall doors.

&gt;&gt; It's like IR.  IR is a specific frequency, but you can operate your
&gt;&gt; TV, VCR, cable box, etc without interfering w/ each other.  But if
&gt;&gt; you put an IR detector among any of those devices, it would go off.

&gt; Larry:

&gt; Sony can make a TV remote control that transmits exactly between 2.45
&gt; 67 and 2.4568 Gigahertz (the frequencies are made up). They can
&gt; obviously make a receiver (inside the TV) which can detect precisely
&gt; that range.
">

Actually,some wireless phones use that 2.4 Ghz band,and some wireless video
xmitters. "Regulation" of that freq. band is pretty loose.
It's also the freq of microwave ovens;2450Mhz.(approximate freq.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The company that make the IR detector could build a detector of TV
&gt; (but not VCR or DVD) if they wanted to. However they choose to make an
&gt; IR detector with a 2.0 to 3.0 GHz range. Electronics Engineers can
&gt; manufacture a transmitter or a receiver with as narrow or wide range
&gt; as they want. The remote controls are supposed to have a narrow band.
&gt; The IR detector is supposed to have a wide band. The FCC is very
&gt; strict about devices interfering with each other, and they better be
&gt; or else nothing wireless would work at all.

&gt; -Ramon
">

Uh,IR TV remotes use a pulse code to eliminate interference between IR
devices. Buy a universal remote,and you enter a code that tells the circuit
to use the right pulse code for the model you select,they all come with a
list of codes for different brands of TV/VCR/cable box.
"IR" is a pretty wide band,about 870nm to 12,000nm wavelength.

Ramon,I believe you don't know much about this subject.
Did you Google "MIRT" to find out about it?

Following my previous post a little bit more:
Since many motor vehicles are so soundproof that drivers often do not hear a
train or siren approaching or see warning lights immediately, Cobra offers
the Safety Alert(R) Traffic Warning system to help prevent possible
accidents. When the XT-1000 Transmitter is installed on a train or such
emergency vehicle as a police car or ambulance, it transmits special warning
signals that can be detected up to one mile away by Traffic Warning
Detectors. Detectors, installed in motor vehicles, warn drivers of upcoming
hazards with one of three alerts: train (at an unguarded crossing),
emergency vehicle, and road hazard.

And I don't work for Cobra.. Ha.

I don't believe it's that common in gated apt. complexes.  I remember
about 3 years ago letting a cop into the complex as I was exitting.  The
complex is still relatively new - it was built around 2002, give or take
a year.

At any rate, those "gates" in front of apt. complexes are the most
useless things ever invented.  They are not "security" gates - they are
"limited access" gates.  They do NOT provide security, nor will any
well-trained leasing office agent tell you they provide any sort of
security.

As anyone who has ever tried it knows, it is trivial to follow someone
else into an apt. complex.  Quite a few times, I have entered the exit
gate while being stuck behind some clueless twit trying to call their
friend to let them in.

&gt;&gt; Now I understand your point. Are you saying that what is detected is
&gt;&gt; the low frequency (as it can be counted by a human being) rate, as
&gt;&gt; opposed to a certain modulated frequency, like the ones used to
&gt;&gt; distinguish a VCR remote control from a TV remote control?

&gt;&gt; What about day vs. night, obstacles, fog, etc?

&gt;&gt; If I can afford a *precise* infrared remote control made by Sony
&gt;&gt; ($9.95 at Radio Shack) the police and fire departments in a life
&gt;&gt; critical jobs, certainly can.

&gt;&gt; -Ramon

&gt; Aha! My suspicions were correct. The strobe-light detector seemed too
&gt; crude, susceptible to errors, easy to counterfeit. Plus, you want the
&gt; street-light preempting functionality to be independent of the strobe,
&gt; visible light.

&gt; I got this from another NG (sometimes it pays to cross post):

&gt;&gt; Not the one you chose.  A better choice would be rec.autos.driving.

&gt; Well, traffic engineers know quite a bit about radar, its attendant
&gt; transportation and non-transportation uses, and emergency vehicle
&gt; pre-emption (EVP).

&gt; Modern EVP systems use an encrypted signal sent via a modulated 14.035
&gt; Hz wave.  If it seems low frequency, it is.  Most systems send the
&gt; signal out whenever the front strobe lights of the vehicle are
&gt; flashing (and it is obviously invisible, with visible light being
&gt; several orders of magnitude higher in frequency).

&gt; You'll occasionally see peace officers detaining a motorist, the whole
&gt; time leaving their forward strobes activated and tying up traffic in
&gt; all directions but their own (which is usually already tied up behind
&gt; them).  I had a conversation with the Cook County Sheriff's Department
&gt; one morning a few years ago after they repeatedly destroyed the
&gt; operation of a busy suburban intersection over several days.  They
&gt; would pull over speeding motorists and direct them onto a side street
&gt; for an entertainment venue that had zero traffic in the AM peak.  The
&gt; motorist and the sheriffs patrol vehicle would end up facing back out.
&gt; Because of the EVP call, the traffic signal was held in green for the
&gt; EVP max-out (about two minutes), then recalled immediately after
&gt; returning to serve the other movements.  This left the main arterials
&gt; (the cross road and the oncoming arterial) with about six seconds of
&gt; green per cycle - and no arrows for the left turns, either, since the
&gt; detector loops &quot;tuned out&quot; after a few of those incidents and were not
&gt; vacated to &quot;reset&quot; until after the AM peak had diminished.

&gt; Obviously, the only real &quot;fix&quot; for a problem like this, from a traffic
&gt; signal control standpoint, is to not serve an incoming EVP call until
&gt; the previous call is terminated, if the call is from the same unit.

&gt; This requires that the EVP module recognize the difference between a
&gt; fire truck and an ambulance, so that vehicles in a procession but
&gt; separated are not denied calls on the basis of the passage of a
&gt; previous vehicle.  There are pitfalls to this practice (all units must
&gt; have unique ID's), but it's probably easier than asking the cops to
&gt; turn off their forward strobes (although some agencies are very good
&gt; about strobe light and traffic advisor management, most are ignorant
&gt; of good practices).

Offhand i would say that there are some possibly seriously wrong assertions
here.

1.  In most jurisdictions law enforcement is not allowed to use preemption
just to pull over someone for a traffic violation.  Certainly not in
California.

2.  The red and blue strobes are not at the right frequency.

3.  What encrypted signal?  Peruse the device specifications.  Want a link?

Are you sure that's RADAR? Isn't it PIR, or maybe SONAR?

I think that whole "Ambulances Have Radar Warnings" thing is a load
of crock, thank you very much.

No, that auto flusher is passive IR.  See "Carl and Jerry; the wolf

&gt;I should have explained (I thought it was obvious) that when a nearby
&gt;ambulance is in emergency mode, my radar detector goes crazy. As the
&gt;ambulance goes away, the beeping of my RD slows down.

&gt;I find rather doubtful that my RD has an optical strobe light
&gt;detector. When it boots up, it clearly displays: X-Band, K-Band and
&gt;Laser. All 3 are electromagnetic radiations, but they are very far
&gt;from the strobe used by ambulances and the infrared used by street
&gt;light preempting devices.

&gt;A reader in another newsgroup confirmed my suspicion: the emergency
&gt;vehicles indeed carry a low level radar transmitter *only* whose
&gt;specific purpose is to turn on your RD, and cannot measure (or care)
&gt;about your speed.
">

That's correct.  The same radar transmitters are also used on arrow
board warning signs.  Some are designed to measure and display your
speed, other just send the signal to make your detector go off to
hopefully get your attention so you'll see the sign.

It is the high tech way of saying "out of my way!".

I would assume you could do so if you bought or built such a
