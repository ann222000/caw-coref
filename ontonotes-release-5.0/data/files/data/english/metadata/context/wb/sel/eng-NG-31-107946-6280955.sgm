I recently went on a flight with a retired flight instructor (retired
more than 25 years ago). On take-off, we made it 3/4 down the runway
and had not lifted off. He pulled back on the yoke, we went up and then
back down hard enough to make the wheels "chirp" but not enough to jar
your teeth. Another 50 or so feet we began to slowly climb out. The
fast approaching buildings scared the crap out of me. I have never done
a take-off without using flaps.

Once in the air, it was clear he knew what he was doing. After the
flight, I asked why he did not use flaps for take-off. He said he likes
to get up to rotation speed as quickly as possible and was not
concerned on such a long runway ("Gulp, we used every inch!").

I'm a pilot with less than 100 hours. He wants to go again and take me
and another guy that weighs 200+ lbs. I'm thinking there is no way we
can go without flaps. Should I be concerned?

Does the POH for your airplane recommend that you use flaps for take off?

I don't have the book for the 172 in front of me, but isn't the only
time flaps are recommended during take off is when you are using the
soft-field technique?

What size engine in your 172?  How much weight were you carrying?  A 172
with a 180 HP engine carrying 500 lbs of passengers should have been
able to get off without flaps without a problem.  I fly out of a 2500 ft
strip and use flaps when I'm flying a arrow but not when I'm flying a
t-41 ( 172 /210HP  ).  What does your POH say about short field
distances?  That should be your first stop when looking for info  on
performance.

There is no way I would go back up with that flight instructor until I
learned what happened, and why you needed that much runway!  Flaps or
no flaps, you should have had plenty of room for a normal takeoff.
It almost sounds like the plane wasn't producing full power!

Funny you meantion that. I made the comment to him that the aircraft
did not sound too good. He agreed that at a certain RPM, it would

I don't use (or teach) flaps in the 172 for normal takeoffs. Its not
necessary. Sounds like the pilot held the plane on the runway longer
than it wanted. Bad form, but not necessarily dangerous. I often fly
with these old guys giving BFRs. Some have odd habits but if they are
not dangerous I don't try to reteach 50 years of experience.

I would not fly with him again.  That runway is plenty long, but the
density altitude may be off.  What was the airspeed when he rotated?
You should have been off long before that.  Skip the next flight, or at
the very least do a performance calculation.

No need for flaps for takeoff.

His "non-chalant" attitude is what bothers me, and should bother you.

Even if he doesn't kill you, you want to get far away, so none of his
attitude rubs off on you.  For sure, I would not get in a plane with 200
more pounds, that barely made it the last time.

He seems competent and knowledgable, but I too am concerned about his
"past years".

I did go back and looked at the map for the airport and now
(embarrassingly) realized that we did not start at the beginning of the
runway - we started about 1/4 way down. This would explain why we made
it so close to the end of the runway as we did not use the full length.
Still, I think we used too much runway for the rollout.

When I took my flight lessons, we (almost?) always used flaps for
take-off. The field was somewhere around 4000' long with no obstacles
to overcome. Was I taught wrong? I guess at this point, I'd rather
question and be wrong than not question and be dead. I don't have a POH
for the Cessna 172 but I plan to go to the FBO and take a look.

It depends on the airplane. Does that particular POH call for flaps?

Old, young...Doesn't really matter. I seem to find the occasional
instructor who does things "differently".  One of the problems I run
into when it comes to the biennial flight review if finding one that
is proficient in Bonanzas and Debonairs. That was what I really liked
about the Airsafety Foundations Bo specific proficiency training.

The last CFI only wanted to do imminent stalls and I went along with
it, but next time we are going to do full stalls. If it's the same
instructor I teach him what to expect and then we'll do them. I feel
quite confident about doing stalls in the Deb or any other phase of
flight, but I expect to go through about everything and be critiqued.
I may be proficient, but there is always room for improvement and
possibly a better way here or there, or maybe even a bad habit
creeping in. Nah, that'd never happen.

You should have 75 percent of rotation speed by the half-way point on the
runway. If you do not, abort. But this begs the flaps question, which can
only be answered by the POH.

Yes.  Even if he prefers to take off without flaps (which is entirely doable
in many aircraft, although I cannot speak specifically for the C172), the fact
that he came back down onto the runway after the first attempt at rotation
implies that he doesn't know how to do it, which is a very bad sign
irrespective of his other skills, whatever they might be.  In other words,
it's the botched take-off that should be a source of concern, not the choice
to take off without flaps (unless flaps are mandatory for the aircraft, as
they would be in most jet airliners).

That would be Very Bad Sign Number 2.  One does not merely observe that an

It is up to you whether you want to fly with him. He is willing to fly
an airplane which you note in another post that he admitted had engine
problems -- "at a certain RPM, it will hiccup."

It is astounding how many pilots are killed flying in airplanes that
they know there is something wrong with them.

And, too, he did not use all the runway on a relatively short runway. I
would say that, overall, his judgment is suspect. I guy can be
perfectly competent from the standpoint of being able to fly an
airplane, but have terrible judgment. In fact, great flying ability and
terrible judgment often seem to go together.

I would not fly with him again.

Aircraft specific POH is the ONLY valid authority for correct operation.

My Cessna 172 POH (section 4 normal procedures) says,
normal takeoffs flaps 0-10 deg.
10 deg reduces TO distance ~5%
Flaps &gt; 10 deg ---- NOT APPROVED ---- for takeoff.

Flaps 10 deg suggested for short, soft and rough.

I did once take off in C172 from ~4000' DA with full fuel, 1/2 load and
flaps 20 deg, there was no noticeable difference in the TO or expected climb
rate, I did not notice my error until I went to reduce the flaps which I had
thought I had set at 10 deg.  I did need to reduce them slowly and the climb
rate improved as I did so.

This error of procedure was caused by my failure to properly use the
pre-takeoff checklist and increased my awareness of the importance of proper
checklist procedure.  It was a simple land and taxi back for takeoff
exercise at an unfamiliar 5000' paved airport.

I like to practice specialty takeoffs but otherwise, IMHO there is little
reason to use any flaps for a normal or lightly loaded takeoff in a C172.

Happy landings,

Wow, that is weird. The POH specifies 0-10 degrees of flaps for normal
take-offs, and 10 degrees for short field take offs.
A 4000-foot runway in florida is not even close to being a short-field
take-off for a C172 with 2 people.
I don't see any reason whatsoever to use any flaps in a normal
takeoff. I have never used flaps for take off except while

practicing soft field or short field landings.
I usually rotate at 55 knots and it takes about 1000 or 1500 feet at
the very most to get that speed.
If you have trouble taking off in a C172, with 2 people, in florida,
in a 3600 ft runway, you might consider opening the
cowling and checking the engine. Somebody might have stolen one of the
cylinders :)
Seriously speaking, if proper airspeeds were used for rotation and
climbout, that 172 has a serious performance deficiency.
Can it be that the CFI used a higher than normal rotation speed, and a
speed higher that Vy for his climb, for the
purpose of.... I don't know, being cool, buzz the buildings, having
fun, scaring you, or something among those lines?
Did you notice which speeds he used?

That's a strange story. I think the runway is easily long enough for a
no flap take of at max TOW for a 172 Cessna to clear a 50' obstruction.
If he really wanted to get to take off speed with no flaps (55 knots) as
quickly as possible he should have used the short field technique of
running the engine up to full power while on the brakes. What is more
stange is your observation that the wheels chirped -the wheels should
have been spinning when you touched down during take off so there should
have been no chirp -unless the brakes were partly on... Is it possible
that that was why the take off was so slow? Also, after 100 hours,
hasn't your training course already covered take off distance
calculations etc?

On most of the 172's while 10 degrees of flaps gets you off the ground
quicker, they hurt you in the climb so you won't get over that 100'
obstacle any easier.  This is why the later 172's dropped the suggestion
to use ten degrees.   If you've got one of the earlier ones with the
johnson bar flap control, you can actually with practice start the
roll with no flaps, drop the flaps to break ground and then pull
them back up for the climb.

Soft field on the other hand, you WANT to break ground as soon as
possible so use the flaps all the time.

The fact that he lifted off and dropped in means something else
was wrong.  He rotated too early.   This will impact the distance
to clear an obstacle more than whether flaps were used or not.
That's the problem with the POH.   It assumes the aircraft is
in good condition and the pilot is PROFICIENT.

Always allow a little extra for rusty aircraft and old pilots
(or is it the other way around?).

Just to expand on the issue of condition of rusty old aircraft--even though
many others here are far more qualified--since the issue of pilot technique
is already addressed:
1)    The finish has more effect on lift and drag than many people might
suppose.
2)    The angle of incidence of the wings on a 172 are easily adjustable
during an annual--both as one of the methods of roll trimming and to
optomize the aircraft for special purposes.
3)    100LL was not the primary fuel for the early 172s.  Theoretically,
from my automotive experience, the timing could be adjusted, but that would
require an STC which may exist, or may not.
4)    The internal timing of the magnetos tends to gradually retard.  In a
perfect world, they would be adjusted at annual--but they may have been or
may not.
5)    The fixed pitch metal prop can be repitched over a narrow range--but
more than enough to drastically effect the performance envelope.  (The limit
is a lifetime limit, so many repitched props can not be returned to their
original pitch--there was a recent article in the AOPA magazine which
described the cumulative limit.)
6)    Accuracy of the "empty" weight.

All of those are in addition to the obvious for all aircraft, such as
density altitude--in which humidity plays an increasing role with increasing
temperatures.

Yes it did. Somewhere in this big thread is a post I made: I revisited
the map of the runway and realized he did not start at the very end. He
started about a 1/4 way down. As for the brakes, I have no idea what he

OK so you are saying you used 3/4 x 3600 and you were not at MTOW. Still
should have been more than enough. If you don't have the POH then you
can find plenty of refs. for the takeoff perf. for the C172. I fly a
172R and with full fuel and 1 heavy passenger I don't think I've used
half of a 3600' strip (typically 100' altitude 20oC). Just another
thought, you were taking off into the wind -right ? ;)

Thinking about it more, I wonder if it's possible he had (over)rotated
too early  thereby creating excess drag on takeoff this would have
extended the distance -but by how much I'm not sure. In my limited
experience, the 172 seems to fly itself off the ground really easily
with just a bit of back pressure (at 55 knots) with no flaps. As I
understand it, to do a big bunny hop on takeoff there was either a big
gust or he had over rotated to the backside of the power curve or tried
to force her out of ground effect early. Over and early rotation use a
lot more runway and can even lead to a stall on takeoff -sort of like
what you described. I would not fly with a pilot who did that!

I can think of a lot of possibilities, but they are pure conjecture at
this point.

1.      It's possible that plane had a prop optimized for cruise which
can make for a pretty anemic take off.
2.      It's indeed possible his feet had slipped up so his toes were
on the brakes.
3.      A brake(s) may have been dragging.  It's been mentioned but
the tires should not have chirped when it set back down unless the
brakes were dragging (it doesn't take much), or his toes were on the
brake pedals, or the plane was not aligned with the direction of
travel. (again it doesn't take much)
4.      Soft tires, but that should have shown up on the preflight.
5.      Engine developing full power at take off?  You normally are
not going to be able to redline the RPM with the typical fixed pitch
prop but should know what it should turn on a static run up.
6.      Over rotation as has already been mentioned.  In my Deb with a
soft field TO it's full up elevator until the nose strut begines to
extend which is usually nor more than a plane length or two. Ease off
on the back pressure a bit but still hold the strut extended.  It'll
lift into ground effect where you immediately have to ease off on the
back pressure enough to keep flying otherwise it'll settle onto the
runway and still be there at the other end.
7.      Gust of wind?  That usually would drop the plane back on the
runway at this early stage, but not necessiarily.
8.      Short field TO is controls neutral to allow rapid acelleration
to near rotation where back pressure is applied.
9.      There are probably more reasons that I've missed than listed
but these are what comes to mind.
