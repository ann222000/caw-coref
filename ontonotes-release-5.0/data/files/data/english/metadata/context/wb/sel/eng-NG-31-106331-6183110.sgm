"Cosmic Consciousness"
"Omnipresent Intelligence"
"Universal spiritual energy".
"Quantum thought-bubbles spread across probability fields."

I could make this stuff up all day.  It's a blend of physics and
fantasy, of science and spirituality.

The people who generate these terms typically are not the ones that
deal with them in day-to-day experience.  For instance, you will rarely
see someone using the term "cosmic consciousness" that studies either
the cosmos or consciousness.

They also love to use the words "energy", "fields", "frequencies",
"infinite", etc.  For example, "Spiritual energy frequencies".

I'm not saying that there are no such thing as "spiritual energy
frequencies", but they never pan out to be anything more than people
trying to conflate one idea with another.  Yet these terminologies are
frequently popular.

Possible reasons:

1. To lend a degree of credence to other unsubstantiated claims.  For
instance, "spiritual energy force" sounds more respectable than
"ghost".

2.  Holistic thinking, in itself, can lead to a pleasant feelings of
"oneness", as one forces oneself to begin to drop the standard way of
looking at the world, for a more integrated one.

To think about something like the enormity of the universe and all it's
stars, or the complexity of a flower and all it's interacting cells,
can provoke a feeling of awe.  One is "overwhelmed" with the
information presented.  To try and use the limited capacity of the
human mind to grasp terms like "infinity" or "eternal", involves a kind
of shutting down, or fuzzing out, of typical cortical functions of the
brain.  We reach the end of our intellectual tether, so to speak.

The same is true of incomprehensible information.  It can also lead to
a pleasant feeling or confusion.  "What is the sound of one hand
clapping?"  "Who were you before you were born?"

However, none of this suggests something supernatural, or outside our
current understanding, just people working to provide meaning to these
types of experiences.

Thoughts?

I think you're right, in the main; though i think your poetic licence
might be a little unfair. I suggest perhaps a blend of reason and
imagination.

I think that (1) is amusingly insightful, and (2) is unintentionally
complimentary.

Metaphor may often appear incomprehensible in the absence of
associative context; understandably perhaps, as they are not logical
constructs; they can be an effective tool in reconstructing "frames",
though.

I hear you say "Bootstrapping Imagination is a good thing.". I agree.

Or.

3.  When we humans try to describe, or place attributes on that which
is indescribable and whos attributes, are as numerous as there are
atoms.  Then we are forced to take the artistic way of description.

When we read a book, we get more than the sum total of the words, or
the meaning of the words.  We 'read between the lines'  A good authour
is one that can communicate an idea without using the actual words that
denote the idea.  Via metaphor, poetic imagery, and any number of wordy
tricks.

When talking about the infinite, the all, we have to speak in these
terms, or whittle on until our death, by which time we still would not
be finished. How else can we express the infinite with an infinte
amount of time in which to do it?

It is very telling that some people pick up on the meaning, and gain
understanding, while  some people ask why the poetic language?

Thinking about it after the fact, I didn't explain No. 2 all that well.
I presupped a lot.  Let me explain a bit, but I don't think I will do
it justice to the concept here.............

Our consciousness is likely a "functional correlation" between brain
function (physical structure) and mind function (thought structure).
For the sake of simplicity, let's use the triune brain model:

a.  Brain stem = physical
b.  Mid-brain = emotional
c.  Cortex (all) = thinking

I understand that this is waaay too simplified, but....  You can
imagine that there is an ongoing conflict between these areas to have
their experience rise into consciousness.  This can be done
unconsciously (someone steps on your toe and brings your left foot into
consciousness) or conscious (I ask you to "pay attention" to your left
foot).

Now imagine that you alter the process of the cortex (drugs,
meditation, fever, etc.) and you have an "altered state of
consciousness".  You could see that this will create a certain state
that may be considered, if the conditions are right, "spiritual".

My statement was that certain words, semantics themselves, act as
incantations, in a way, to get one to think in ways that cause a
"fuzzing out", or defocussing, of typical cortical function.  For
example, to think about "infinite space" might cause a kind of
right-brain "spacial overload" and to think about "eternity" might
generate a left-brain "temporal overload", causing what may be likened
to a "spiritual" or "mystical" experience as consciousness swings
toward a new balance of functions coming into consciousness.

This experience is talked about by scientists who are involved with the
"super large", "super small", and "super complex".

For instance, various esoteric religious activities involve shutting
down focused linear thought (reducing or defocussing cortical activity)
through activities like meditation, prayer, dance, etc.

This would be "imaginative" in that you would consciously will yourself
into a certain state of awareness.

Personally, I see these altered states of consciousness as great, but
the issue I have is that they are used as "religious concepts" to push
unfounded ideas.

Lee, you wrote, "It is very telling that some people pick up on the
meaning, and gain understanding, while  some people ask why the poetic
language?"

I think about it as using your mind like the lens of a camera.  You can
"tighten in" and "widen out" in your thinking.  That is, like you said,
if you have the ability to "get it".  Some don't.  Some like to use the
wide-angle exclusively and some the macro lens.

For those that use the 'wide angle', they fall prey to poorly defined
terminology because it sounds like, or supports a more holistic world
view.  They lack the focus to tighten in a bit and see what is being
described.

For those the 'macro lens', they are not able to understand the world
in a poetic, holistic, sense.  Overly rational, if you like.

In trying to answer fundamental questions about our existence or the

I think these emotional appeals are incredibly unhelpful; even

[Ian]: "In trying to answer fundamental questions about our existence
or the nature of the universe, please describe how a "poetic" approach
has any merit over a strictly rational one." :)

If you are looking at "our existence" you will typically need to take a
much different approach than if you were to look at the "nature of the
universe".

"Our existence", especially when you look at it in the context of human
experience, involves some "wishy-washy" things that can't be pointed to
directly, but need to be alluded to.  You have to look at how the brain
has a lot of built-in "ups" and "extras" beyond reason that have been
developed over time (emotion, hope, faith, creativity, pattern
development, etc.) And these provide us, in entirety, with what we
could call the "human experience".  The merit of understanding this is
the you are able to see how we operate as not only thinkers, but human
thinkers.

On the other hand, in trying to study the "nature of the universe", we
have tried to develop methods for stripping out the "wishy-washy",
typically dealt with via the scientific method.  It's aim is to try,
the best we can, to remove the human element from the research.

In terms of which has more "merit", it depends on what you are looking
for.  For instance, I like having "hope".  This, however, does not mean
that what have hope for will come true.  Or, that if I was in place of
looking for solid information about the world, that I should or would
include my hopes in that decision.  Or that I would let me hopes blind
me from trying to find reality.

[Ian]: "I think these emotional appeals are incredibly unhelpful; even
outright deceptive, anti-progressive, and dangerous."

They can be, as I mentioned, in the wrong context.  What I'm
suggesting, I suppose, is the process of looking at something at a
variety of levels, in both rational and 'emotional' ways, WITHOUT
falling prey to the unhelpful, deceptive, or anti-progressive aspects
of either.  A middle way.

To further illustrate, Sam Harris brings up the figurative paradox of
the "scientist who can build a hydrogen bomb and also think that he
will get 72 virgins when he gets to heaven".  What is more dangerous:
The scientist who can't think about the larger implications of his
scientific work (death of millions)?  Or the believer who would not be
able to rationally see how the promise of 72 virgins is a crock?

[Chris]:  I don't even suggest that there would be neurochemical
change, per se.  That is, assuming that this change happened via
thought only and not through other factors.  There would be an activity
change, of course, in the same way that a fMRI would show changes from
someone thinking about a spacial problem compared to something thinking
about a math problem.   But I could see how this would lead to eventual
neurochemical change over time.

But at the risk of belaboring my point in this thread....

As an example, in some yoga meditations, there are instructions to
"visualize various color lights flowing through the body that are
soothing".   There are no lights, of course, and the same process could
be achieved by saying something like, "I want you to focus on the
quantum energy waves coming from the universe that are flowing through
your body."

It's a means to the same ends, namely reducing physical, emotional, and
intellectual reactions to the world by getting your brain busy on
something distracting and reducing arousal of the system.... However,
in the second case, you get a lot of people talking about "quantum
energy waves" as if they are reality.

The people who generate these terms typically are not the ones that

They also love to use the words "energy", "fields", "frequencies",

I'm not saying that there are no such thing as "spiritual energy

trying to conflate one idea with another. Yet these terminologies are
frequently popular.

(Pottsie)
I don't know about the last term (Quantum thought-bubbles spread across probablility fields), but as far as the first three terms go, they are perfectly acceptable terms.

First off, let me say that I am not familiar with the language of calculus......nor am I familiar with Swahili, but I do know that they are both languages that communicate ideas.  The word and numbers are symbols of those ideas.  Languages change all the time.  To prove this, all one has to do is to read a few of the speeches written in the 17th and 18th centuries.  They spoke at times in terms which we today view as archaic.....and, indeed, they are.

"Cosmic Consciousness" refers to the concept of "One Mind"......ie the mind that you use is the same mind that I use.  It also refers to the fact that Mind is Infinite.....which is why the first statement is seen to be true.

"Mind" is not Matter......nor does It come from Matter.  IMHO.  It is the opposite pole of Matter, as Up is to Down, as In is to Out, as Here is to There.  We use the term "Physical Universe" to denote either "All of the Matter in our Universe"....or Galaxy, or Cosmos.....whatever we happen to be discussing.  If one sees Mind as Infinite, why is it so strange that a term would arise which would denote this idea?

"Omnipresent Intelligence".......same thing.  If one sees Mind (Intelligence) as Infinite......this would be a term that ALSO expresses the same idea.

Same with "Universal Spiritual Energy".......Thoughts are energy.  When one thinks, all sorts of electo chemical happenings are going on in the brain.  And Spirit is simply another word for Mind.  The only thing different that THIS term expresses that was absent in the first two is the concept of potential or power.  Does anyone on this list believe that Ideas or Thoughts do not constitute Power or Potential?

I believe that it was Newton who developed Calculus....I may be wrong, I am not a Mathematician, but essentially Calculus is a language.  At one time it wasn't, and after Newton it was!  Sort of like "Let there be light!"  I wonder how many people didn't, and still don't, understand that language.  I certainly don't.

But.......that doesn't make it any less true or valuable.

(Chris)

Possible reasons:

1. To lend a degree of credence to other unsubstantiated claims. For
instance, "spiritual energy force" sounds more respectable than
"ghost".

2. Holistic thinking, in itself, can lead to a pleasant feelings of
"oneness", as one forces oneself to begin to drop the standard way of
looking at the world, for a more integrated one.

To think about something like the enormity of the universe and all it's
stars, or the complexity of a flower and all it's interacting cells,
can provoke a feeling of awe. One is "overwhelmed" with the
information presented. To try and use the limited capacity of the
human mind to grasp terms like "infinity" or "eternal", involves a kind
of shutting down, or fuzzing out, of typical cortical functions of the
brain. We reach the end of our intellectual tether, so to speak.

The same is true of incomprehensible information. It can also lead to
a pleasant feeling or confusion. "What is the sound of one hand
clapping?" "Who were you before you were born?"

(Pottsie)

These are Zen Koans.....designed SPECIFICALLY to shut down the intellectual mind.  Simply because it is the Intellectual Mind (Left Brain), which creates all the "noise" that prevents the Subjective Mind from realizing that it is INDEED part of the One Mind.

Zen, in recognizing the Infinite quality of Mind, and the fact that it cannot be understood by the Intellect, calls it "No-Mind"......which confounds Westerners even more because they.....with their Intellectual Minds think that Zen advocates losing ones Mind altogether.  And in one respect, it does.....while in another.....it doesn't!   ;)

It is the same on this list.  People, at times will accuse me of not knowing what I'm talking about.

If Sanity is defined as seeing the Truth.......and the Truth is is that I'm crazy....If I recognize the Truth of my insanity.....I must be Sane.

Paul Simon hums in the background...."Still crazy after all these years."

(Chris)
However, none of this suggests something supernatural, or outside our
current understanding, just people working to provide meaning to these
types of experiences.

(Pottsie)

I, for one, do not claim supernatural status for the Divine.

Poetry, like Mythology, is an expanded system of symbolism.  Symbolism is a method of communication which explains things.....namely the irrational.

The Universe is made up of polarities.  Up vs Down,  Inner vs Outer, Dark vs Light, Good vs Evil, Love vs Hate, etc etc.  It is also made up of the Rational vs the Irrational.

A rational approach is simply not the proper approach to explain the irrational.

I find in poetry alot of metaphysical realism. I.e. if the poetry is good in this respect.
The question of precisely what constitutes meaning in metaphor and symbolism is a complicated one. If Jung is to be believed, symbols are heavy-duty loaded with meaning. If linguistic philo. is to be believed non-linguistic symbols are archaisms.
I think it funny that someone would literally think the cosmos made up of polarities, etc. That way of thinking is just a function of our symmetry. -jb

&lt;Ian&gt; I think they have physical origins... as oppose to some hidden

&lt;reply&gt; What is a physical origen? How can any origen be physical?
Physics is an analyisis of the motion of things. How can the movement
of things cause them to be?

What is a "hidden non-physical precursor"? If you are talking about
your experience which is certainly "non-physical" or "meta-physical"
then it is right in front of you. You just need to wake up and look!
... so it is certainly not "hidden". It is out of experience that
science can even be done.

The existence of experience can never be based on an analysis of its
properties.

Hey Chriscrosdale(can I just use CD?)

I belive that this is my very first reply to you on a personal level?

Yes I understand what you say, but to take the anology further.  the
camera has both modes, is it better then to make full use of the
camera, or just use the bits that you are comfatable with?

We are all capable of appreciating art, as we are all capable of

Umm Ian,

Do you actuaaly realise where you are going with this?

Your stance is that religous thought is dangerous, because it will
impead mankinds progress.

Yet here you tell us that you understand that religous thought perhaps
comes from the genes.  Then one can logicaly infere from these two
statements that you would be in favour of genetic manipulation to
change the way in which some humans think.

In other words Ian, we can logicaly infere that you are in favour of
eugenics.

Now I don't belive that you are, and it is one hell of a charge to
level at somebody, so I feel that you must be given a chance to tell me
to fuck right off.  But you can see what I mean surly?

I can see it, but my mechanism is obviously not eugenics: It's
Darwinian evolution through natural selection.

We'll naturally discard the irrational genes as our species continues
to evolve. It's a gradual and incremental process, but our history
offers incontrovertible evidence for it: As our intelligence and
knowledge has expanded over the past, say, ten thousand years, our
superstitions have diminished and our societies have become more
intricate and the mysteries have been explained.

Some of us, however, have already evolved. And some of us will be left
behind. ;)

America has an undeniably high concentration of very superstitious

of evolution. A lot of it is cultural exposure, and, as you know,
borders and oceans are no longer the barriers they once were.

For what it's worth, I think if there is a country that is culturally
more advanced in a meaningful way it isn't Britain (which has an

The Book of Genesis is not divine.......and does NOT explain Evolution.  It explains (in symbolic terms) Involution.  A fact that the Creationists as well as the Evolutionists overlook.

So you would have madmen helping madmen? :)

(Pottsie)
Being "Mad" has nothing whatsoever to do with the irrational.  Every scientific discovery began with a hunch.........an idea.  The "popped" into the head of the Scientist seemingly from nowhere.  (Do NOT try to tell me that the Mental was cause by the Physical, unless you are going to offer proof.  The fundamental characteristic of the Physical is Form.  Form cannot produce that which is formless........it is a Universal Law.  Cats do NOT produce dogs.  Like begets Like.)

Actually, this is the entire crux of the problem when it comes to the part of the Scientific Community which fails to acknowledge the Reality of the Mental/Spiritual realm.  They see everything in terms of the Physical.  They look at only one side of the coin.  They think that the view INSIDE the house is the only view there is.  All they have to do is to realize that the Universe is Bigger than even THEY imagine.........walk OUTSIDE your house and you will see that the view is completely different.......and guess what?    the view from the inside isn't threatened at all!   ;)

BTW......The Fundamentalists are just as wrong.  They refuse to look INSIDE the house!  They are screaming for the Evolutionists to come outside, while the Evolutionists are screaming back at them that the view OUTSIDE the house isn't real!

[Pottsie]:  "...I don't know about the last term (Quantum
thought-bubbles spread across probablility fields), but as far as the
first three terms go ("Cosmic Consciousness", "Omnipresent
Intelligence", "Universal spiritual energy"), they are perfectly
acceptable terms....  "Cosmic Consciousness" refers to the concept of
"One Mind"......ie the mind that you use is the same mind that I use.
It also refers to the fact that Mind is Infinite.....which is why the
first statement is seen to be true..."

[Chris]:  I get the idea of what it "means".  I've been around long
enough and read a lot of the same books that you are mentioning to have
a good idea of what you are talking about....  However, similarly, we
could both talk about unicorns, fairies, and the like, and we would
also both have a pretty good idea of what we are referring to, as these
are "accepted terms" for "things".  However, "cosmic consciousness", as
well as "fairy", is a "made up" term that refers to an abstract concept
of something that likely holds no validity.  And that's my point.  It
is used primarily as a "poetic concept" that has no grounding in our
current understanding of the world.  It does have emotional purpose for
those that use it and those that get satisfaction out of using it;
yet, it is used mostly for the mind-state that it generates and it is
not based in reality (those things that can be independantly verified
to exist outside of our minds).

[Pottsie]:  "Mind" is not Matter......nor does It come from Matter.
IMHO.  It is the opposite pole of Matter, as Up is to Down, as In is
to Out, as Here is to There.  We use the term "Physical Universe" to
denote either "All of the Matter in our Universe"....or Galaxy, or
Cosmos.....whatever we happen to be discussing.  If one sees Mind as
Infinite, why is it so strange that a term would arise which would
denote this idea?"

[Chris}:  I agree that mind is NOT matter.  But how can you say it
doesn't come from matter?  What example of mind do you have that
doesn't come from matter?  It is the result, byproduct, or projection,
of matter; specifically, those things that we understand "make" minds,
namely brains.  You would have to show how "mind" (as we understand it)
is possible WITHOUT matter.  You would have to explain HOW mind is
generated, HOW it is "infinite", HOW it could maintain such a strong
correlation to brain function, HOW the cosmos itself could be shown to
have any sort of "consciousness" or "intelligence" as we know it, HOW
our minds could be shown to be linked in some significant way, etc.,
etc.,......

You tend to use "mind" in similiar way to "spirit" and assume that it
is okay to do so.  If what you are talking about is closer to the
traditional definition of "spirit" or "soul", then why not use "cosmic
spirit".  My arguement is that scientific terms have been coopted by
"scientific mysticism" to lend some credence and redefine some old
terms so that people who desperately want to believe in the mystical
can do it without feeling they are stooping to religion.

[Pottsie]: "...It is the Intellectual Mind (Left Brain), which creates
all the "noise" that prevents the Subjective Mind from realizing that
it is INDEED part of the One Mind...."

[Chris]:  Indeed?  Just because you feel a sense of "oneness" when you
are not in a state of "subjective mind" does not mean that you are part
of "one mind", it only means that you are not seeing yourself as
divided from the world, that you have shut down the part of your brain
(mind generator) that mentally divides the world into bits and pieces,
including seeing yourself as seperate from it.  This state of mind may
offer a personal oceanic experience, and may be quite emotionally
profound, but this does NOT mean that your mental state is not
localized to you only.  You are only temperarily shutting off 'higher'
(advanced) brain functions--those functions that we work so hard to
develop from the time we are born to late adolescence.

(We can talk about how those "higher" brain function have problems of
their own, but that is a whole different subject.)

[Pottsie]:  "...People, at times will accuse me of not knowing what I'm
talking about....If Sanity is defined as seeing the Truth.......and the
Truth is that I'm crazy....If I recognize the Truth of my
insanity.....I must be Sane....."

[Chris]:  People may accuse you of not knowing what your talking about
because you do not offer any in-between steps in your explaination.
Maybe you should start slow and begin to explain. slowly and
methodically, how you see "mind" and what you have in terms of
reasoning as to why it is "infinite", part of a universal "one mind",
etc.   If you honestly start in this process, and don't take mental
short cuts, you will probably find that you are, at some point, merely
professing an unreasoned belief in the supernatural.

Best,
Chris

[Lee]:  "....Yes I understand what you say, but to take the anology

use of the camera, or just use the bits that you are comfatable with?
We are all capable of appreciating art, as we are all capable of
engaging in logical debates.  Then should we only do one of these
things?..."

[Chris]:  Hi Lee.  I think we should use ALL of these frames of
reference.  I love art, poetry, symbolism, mythology, and the personal
emotional relationships that I have in my life.  I have had "wide
angle" experiences both through meditation and psychoactive drugs, and
have thoroughly enjoyed both.  I also enjoy logic and reasoning and
have always found myself to be more of the "thinking" personality.
However, I think neither is "better" and that each should inform the
other.

Personally, I find myself being much more of a strict materialist as
that has been the best route and don't personally see a need, or
desire, to factor in the supernatural to explain our
experience--although I can see how people could do that and it would
work for them.

I admire your "linear" optimism.

Could you possibly explain why we haven't "discarded" our brain stem
and mid-brain over the same period (which is a remarkably brief
evolutionary period, by the way) as our cortical mantles have
mushroomed?

More interestingly perhaps, is one a necessary precursor to the other,

(Pottsie)
Chris, there is not a word or term that is NOT "made up"......the tell tale sign of a "good" word or concept is whether or not it recieves a wide acceptance within a particular group.  New words are coined everyday.....some have staying power and others fade.  The 3 terms you have pointed out have been around for twenty or so years.

Secondly, as far as the idea of "current understanding of the world" goes.....one of the purposes of discussions of this sort is to "further" the idea of how the Universe operates.

For 2000 years, Aristotle's idea that the Earth was the center of the Universe held sway.  Then somewhere around the first half of the 16th Century Copernicus postulated that the Planets orbited the Sun.  BUT.......it wasn't until a 100 years later that Newton PROVED it!

I do not impugn "current thought", but neither do I set it up on a pedestal.

[Old Pottsie]: "Mind" is not Matter......nor does It come from Matter.
IMHO. It is the opposite pole of Matter, as Up is to Down, as In is
to Out, as Here is to There. We use the term "Physical Universe" to
denote either "All of the Matter in our Universe"....or Galaxy, or
Cosmos.....whatever we happen to be discussing. If one sees Mind as
Infinite, why is it so strange that a term would arise which would
denote this idea?"

[Chris}: I agree that mind is NOT matter. But how can you say it
doesn't come from matter?

(Pottsie)
Nope, I won't get get sucked into trying to prove a negative.  Show me some emperical evidence that it does.  =)

(Chris)
What example of mind do you have that
doesn't come from matter?

(Pottsie)
As I have stated before.........The Non-physical and the Physical are opposites.  Like Up and Down are the extremes of Direction.  Hot and Cold are the extremes of Temperature.   Mind(Non-physical) and Matter(physical) are the extremes of Reality.

(Chris)
It is the result, byproduct, or projection,
of matter; specifically, those things that we understand "make" minds,
namely brains. You would have to show how "mind" (as we understand it)
is possible WITHOUT matter.

(Pottsie)
Mind is NOT possible without Matter.   Just like Up is not possible without Down.  That does NOT mean that Up is a product of Down.

(Chris)
You would have to explain HOW mind is
generated,

(Pottsie)
Mind is NOT generated........it simply IS.  Is Energy created?  (I think that is what you mean by "generated")

(Chris)
HOW it is "infinite",

(Pottsie)
I think I already did....but here goes again.  The fundamental characteristic of Matter is Form.  One has to have Space to have Matter.  Not so with Mind.  There is NO idea of Form with Mind.  The fundamental characteristic of Mind is Thought.   Which implies NO extention in time OR space.

Same way with energy.......does energy imply Space?   Nope.  But does Thought imply energy?  Yep.   Is energy infinite?  If it is not confined to time and space it is.

(Chris)
HOW it could maintain such a strong
correlation to brain function,

(Pottsie)
Because energy is POTENTIAL.......as Mind is.  What is potential  must manifest.    Just like the minute you create Up.........there is the potential for Down.   The minute UP manifests........so does the Down.

The minute the Mind manifests so does Matter.  Matter is nothing more than the Physical Manifestation of Mind.  That does NOT mean that Mind creates Matter.

(Chris)
HOW the cosmos itself could be shown to
have any sort of "consciousness" or "intelligence" as we know it,

(Pottsie)
The Cosmos is energy.......period.  Energy is the SUBSTANCE of the Cosmos, correct?   It is the Ground or the Basis of the Cosmos.

NO ONE has yet explained what energy is........in total!  However, we DO state that The Universe (Cosmos) at some time went BANG!

I understand......although I may be wrong, since I am not a physicist, that BEFORE the Big Bang was nothing but potential.  This, under the most current hypothesis that I am aware of, is expressed as "Parallel Universes".  These parallel Universes are essentially every possibility that exists.......ie  In one Universe I am a Brit and Lee is a Yank!  =)

Now, if this is true, what it means is that these parallel universes are ideas.  Thoughts.  And if THIS is true, the the Big Bang is..........The appearance in the physical Universe of Ideas.......or Mind Expressed.    The releasing of Potential into Actuality.   The releasing of Mind into Matter.

If THAT is the case, then every time an electrical impulse is produced in the brain........it is essentially a Mini-Big Bang.  It doesn't mean that Matter produces Mind....It would mean that Mind and Matter are created simultaneously.........at the speed of light (squared?)  I don't know.  I deal in theory.....and leave others to prove or disprove it.

(Chris)
HOW our minds could be shown to be linked in some significant way, etc.,etc.,......

(Pottsie)

IF.......before the Big Bang there are only ideas, potential and energy.......defined as Mind.  Then there is only one.......because "potential" is floating around in the "ether"......it is NOT yet in actuality.  And if it is not yet in actuality.......It is not in Time and Space.  If it is not in Time and Space.......It has no form.  If it has no form......it is everywhere and no where.......It is Infinite......and Infinite is a Unity.

(Chris)
You tend to use "mind" in similiar way to "spirit" and assume that it
is okay to do so.

(Pottsie)
You are the first to see that.  And it IS ok......because it is so.

Let me give you an example.

When we say a person is "depressed", what is it that is depressed?  We can say his "mood".....but what is THAT?  We can say his emotions......but what is THAT.

What it is is his "thoughts".........and they are negative.  To be depressed is to "think negatively"

We also say the person has "low spirits"  If he is happy, we say his spirit is light.  His mood is UP.  In other words, his thoughts are positive.

The word "Spirit" gets a bad rap because it also means "Ghost" etc.  But we also use the term "Team Spirit" or Community Spirit......which conveys a sense of belonging.........a sense of Oneness.  One Mind.  One Spirit.  Unity.

(Chris)
If what you are talking about is closer to the
traditional definition of "spirit" or "soul", then why not use "cosmic
spirit". My arguement is that scientific terms have been coopted by
"scientific mysticism" to lend some credence and redefine some old
terms so that people who desperately want to believe in the mystical
can do it without feeling they are stooping to religion.

(Pottsie)
"Science" is not a term that is the exclusive domaine of the people in white coats in laboratories.  "Science" means knowing.......The term Omniscience was around long before Descartes.  What we label "Science" is really the misnomer..........it is really a METHOD.   And nothing else in the pure sense.  We say "Science will prove so and so.", but we really should be saying "The Scientific Method of Investigation will prove so and so."

I could level the same charge at "Science".  The idea is to communicate.  NOT to place words in this camp and that camp.

"Science's" job is NOT to come up with the hypotheses.......it is to prove or disprove the hypotheses of imagination......WHERE EVER they come from!

[Old Pottsie]: "...It is the Intellectual Mind (Left Brain), which creates
all the "noise" that prevents the Subjective Mind from realizing that
it is INDEED part of the One Mind...."

[Chris]: Indeed?

(Pottsie)
Yep.....indeed.  The Subjective Mind is that part of the Mind that controls your heart beat and heals the cut on your finger.  You do NOT intellectualize any of those tasks.

The Intellectual Mind does NOT control those functions, AND is amenable to suggestion from "other" minds......as hypnosis has proven.   In hypnosis........the Intellectual Mind is "put to sleep" so that the operator has "access" to the Subjective Mind.  But just because we have a Subjective Mind and a Conscious Mind, does NOT mean we have TWO separate minds.  We "have" only one Mind.......because, again, Mind is not limited by time and space.  If it is not limited by time and space, then it is not limited to my body.  How far "out" does it go?  It doesn't GO anywhere.......there is

like calling you a dope, at this point, but I'm refraining).

Science enabled the computer, etc.  Think about it.

NOT the conversation.  For THIS conversation to occur, I had to be
here.  I am more than a product of science, Ian.  You may not be, but
many of the rest of us are.

But even if I bought your "reasoning," could you explain how this
conversation is "helpful"?  In what way is it helpful - to anyone?
It's not helpful to me, it's frustrating.  So if you use "this
conversation" as your example, then I claim it's plainly an example of
something FRUSTRATING.

Not helpful.

Prove me wrong.  (Hopefully you'll notice you can't - which is my
point).

&gt; I've noticed that you like to muddy the waters. Which has what affect?
&gt; It makes things appear deeper than they really are.

Ah - you just don't like hard questions, Ian.  Lots of talk about mud.
You sound so much like a 3rd C BC follower of Apollo, you aren't even
aware of it.

And yeah, I'm a girl, we're unclean - we're muddy - etc., etc.  What
poetry there is in your disclaimers!

Neither are you.  Your "science" in this instance isn't, either.  You
are aware, of course, that dirt and water form the basis of the food
chain?

Clear water is sterile, Ian.

&gt; Personally, I find myself being much more of a strict materialist as

&gt; desire, to factor in the supernatural to explain our

Ahhh then we are in perfect understanding.  I am like you, but I find
my my 'ohhh mystical' bent helps me greatly.

I too realise that we all have the freedom to be who we are , or neeed
be, and I have no problems whatso ever with the non religous.

Hello all,

Very interesting discussion, with many interesting points.  I would
like to respond to the comments (by Ian most directly, but implied by
others) regarding the validity of "poetic" language, and its place in
the evolution of thought and science.

I am of a scientific nature as a rule.  I like facts.  They are fun and
easy.

However, the problem is, we have none.  Maybe some border cases, "I
think therefore I am," etc... but I think it is a pretty widely
accepted philosophical argument that any "fact" makes certain
assumptions that can be negated.  Science is our attempt at creating a
set of assumptions that is strongly supported by the evidence at hand.
However, evidence is constantly flying in the face of science, forcing
us to "change the facts" or make exceptions.  The scientific method is
an excellent way of converging on the truth.  Sometimes, however, we
just end up chasing truth's shadow.  This is because when it becomes
apparant we are on the wrong track, the good ol' SM provides us no
clear way to integrate this new information into our worldview.

The widely overlooked mystery of the SM is steps 1+ 2... observe the
world, form a hypothesis.  Scientists seem to do this automatically.
In fact, this is a step that almost EVERYONE intuitively understands.
This is not particularly shocking I suppose; after all, half of our
cortex seems to be devoted to this type of processing.  And guess
what... it ain't the logical, rational, linguistic left!

One theory on the subject proposes that our left brain is the "micro"
lens, while our left brain is our "macro" lens.  For example:  (hope
this doesn't get garbled)

L    L
L    L
LLLL
L    L
L    L

What letter is displayed above?  Hard to say.  I bet your vision
actually does one of those optical illusionn type things, where it
flops from seeing an H to seeing a set of L's.

Even if it doesn't... remove the objectivity, science to the rescue!
In experiments done with split-brain patients whose hemispheric
connections have been severed (a treatment for severe epilepsy), we get
very interesting results.  If displayed to the left half of the brain,
the subject responses are definitively "L".  Right half, definitivly
"H".

This is just one experiment, there are others that support the theory
that the right brain see's a big picture, while the left brain sees
things in pieces.  The "little pieces" approach is certainly dominant
in human thought.  (Evidence: most people are right handed.  We are
cross wired, so that means left brain.)  It is a very useful approach
for logic (A-&gt;B  and A,  therefore B), and most types of communication,
among many other things.

Our right brain, however, is the silent partner that we turn to when we
are stuck, or that keeps poking us when something just doesn't fit.  It
speaks in metaphor and generalizations and all those other things our
left brain hates because it cannot retrace the steps of how it was
derived.  (Actually, the right brain doesn't usually speak much at
all... but it seems to communicate nonetheless)  And we cannot ignore
it.  It is a valuable guide in this human experience, and those that
undermine its strength or neglect its development often suffer as a
result.

I, for one, love astrology.  I see statistical anomolies in how many of
my friends correlate to the description of their signs.  It stimulates
my right brain to no end, and drives my left brain to start digging
holes to find a rational explanation.  But really, all I have are
hunches.  A vague uneasiness with the so-called facts.   And many, many
hypothesese to work with.

Encourage your right brain.  Play (and enjoy!) music.  Read (and try to
understand!) poetry.  My favorite is the game of Go.  Try rationalizing
a Go players mind!  The right brain is a vital part of the scientific
method, and of any happy human life.

May you find peace in your quest and your questions,
Brendon
