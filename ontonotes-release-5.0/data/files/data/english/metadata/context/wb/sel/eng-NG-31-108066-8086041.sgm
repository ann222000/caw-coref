Get ready for mass confusion. I rec'd the following today from Alex at
OrchidWiz. I can post this as originally rec'd if you like. I converted it
to plain text for this ng, so the links are not showing. Aren't orchid
people insane enough on our own without the Taxos piling on?

OrchidWiz Alert: Name Changes

We would like to bring to your attention a recent change in genus names in
the International Register of Orchid Hybrids maintained by the RHS. The
change stems from the separation of Rhyncholaelia from Brassavola;
Guarianthe from Cattleya; the change from Brazilian Laelias to Sophronites;
and the separation of Schomburgkia into Myrmecophila and Laelia.

The changes to Laeliinae species caused a massive domino effect throughout
hybrid nomenclature, impacting many thousands of crosses. The transformation
is drastic and inescapable. To give you some examples of popular hybrids
affected:

Brassolaeliocattleya Goldenzelle in now Rhynchosophrocattleya Goldenzelle
(click link to see)
Sophrolaeliocattleya Hazel Boyd is now Guarisophleya Hazel Boyd
Cattleytonia Why Not is now Guaritonia Why Not
Laeliocattleya Trick or Treat is now Sophranthe Trick or Treat
Cattleya Chocolate Drop is now Cattlianthe Chocolate Drop
Brassocattleya Maikai is now Brassanthe Maikai
Brassolaeliocattleya Momilani Rainbow is now Thwaitesara Momilani Rainbow
Brassolaelia Morning Glory is now Brassonitis Morning Glory
Brassolaeliocattleya Golden Tang is now Marriottara Golden Tang
Epilaeliocattleya Don Herman is now Epicatanthe Don Herman
Otaara Jane Fumiye is now Peetersara Jane Fumiye
The new nomenclature in effect obsoletes all currently-published orchid
databases. OrchidWiz has already incorporated the changes into Encyclopedia
4.01 (the September update) which will start shipping in the next few days.
The new version will include thousands of new registrations as well as the
June AQ. Please note all existing awards, contributed photos and other
historical data will remain under the old names which will be &quot;aliased&quot;
(linked) to the new names.

If you subscribe to the Annual Maintenance Plan you will be receiving the
update in the mail within a week or two. From now on we are holding all new
orders of 4.0 (or upgrades to 4.0) until the new software ships.

We thank you for your patience on this matter. If you have questions,
comments or concerns, please contact a ... @orchidwiz.com.

I thought something like this was going to happen once Tennis mentioned
Otaara was now Petersara. Â I just looked at the RHS hybrid lists and can't
see any mention of these changes other than the formation of a group to look
into registration changes. (Joyce Stewart, Tom Sheehan etc) So I guess these
are going to happen.

This seems both premature and ill-informed; usually the RHS is slow to
change and certain of the necessity. Very few, if anyone, accepts the
idea that was proposed by two authors of one article that the brazilian
laelias should be sophronitis. Far more people, including taxonomists,
think they should either stay laelia, or more often, should be included
in cattleya.

And from what I understand, even if the changes from soph/laelia go thru
there will be further splitting into smaller subdivisions.... so WTF?

Plus, even if you do accept the new taxonomy (I can see some merits in
it), that doesn't mean we need to go all nuts and change the names for
registration. Â There are horticultural names and scientific names, we've
been keeping track of that in orchids since day 10 or so. Â Did anybody
change the name of all the Rhyncholaelia digbyana crosses right away?
No, and we were just fine. Â That is just one example.

I find this whole name change thing to be ill conceived at best, and a
terrible idea at worst. Â Or perhaps best and worst at the same time.

This is how I see it. . . . . . There is this group of
people=taxonomists=folks that sit around
with nothing to do but clump &amp; split. I want to know why do they have to
change the names?
It has taken me ten years to get used to the different genera &amp; all the
hybrid crosses &amp; names that I have.
I personally think they are egotists &amp; want their naming on the
books!!!!
Now I am not going to change my tags, maybe add another coloured one to show
new names.

I am so tired, so very tired. Â I just can't keep up anymore. Â There is no
easy solution.

I would keep an eye on the official RHS database record to track changes.
They are the single authority and all other compilations are drawn from the
RHS data. Â Its a shame that searching a tag name in these databases will
just get more confusing than it already is.

For what it's worth, I would like to see some new fields in all these
databases that cross reference old names with new names. Â That would add
value to the product for sure. Â It is a certain bet that the RHS will not do
this; they will publish it once in the corrigenda and assume everybody knows
how to research. Â Just changing the names in the databases to reflect
current thinking without any cross reference to old names is caca. Â We might
as well just start making up our own hybrid grex names like they already do
in some orchid exporting countries...

I wonder how this will affect show registration. Earlier this year, some of
our people put in some very long hours programming registration software for
our show.

Note to everyone: Â Don't make any changes yet. Â This is not cast in stone,
or not as cast in stone as the RHS may want you to think. Â I understand
there will be some papers given at the WOC in Miami lumping instead of
splitting. And ,as Rob says, the taxonomic names may differ from registrered
hybrid names. Â So the Fat Lady hasn't sung yet.

&gt;&gt; OrchidWiz Alert: Name Changes

&gt;&gt; We would like to bring to your attention a recent change in genus names
&gt;&gt; in the International Register of Orchid Hybrids maintained by the RHS.
&gt;&gt; The change stems from the separation of Rhyncholaelia from Brassavola;
&gt;&gt; Guarianthe from Cattleya; the change from Brazilian Laelias to
&gt;&gt; Sophronites; and the separation of Schomburgkia into Myrmecophila and
&gt;&gt; Laelia.

&gt;&gt; The changes to Laeliinae species caused a massive domino effect
&gt;&gt; throughout hybrid nomenclature, impacting many thousands of crosses. The
&gt;&gt; transformation is drastic and inescapable. To give you some examples of
&gt;&gt; popular hybrids affected:

&gt;&gt; Brassolaeliocattleya Goldenzelle in now Rhynchosophrocattleya Goldenzelle
&gt;&gt; (click link to see)
&gt;&gt; Sophrolaeliocattleya Hazel Boyd is now Guarisophleya Hazel Boyd
&gt;&gt; Cattleytonia Why Not is now Guaritonia Why Not
&gt;&gt; Laeliocattleya Trick or Treat is now Sophranthe Trick or Treat
&gt;&gt; Cattleya Chocolate Drop is now Cattlianthe Chocolate Drop
&gt;&gt; Brassocattleya Maikai is now Brassanthe Maikai
&gt;&gt; Brassolaeliocattleya Momilani Rainbow is now Thwaitesara Momilani Rainbow
&gt;&gt; Brassolaelia Morning Glory is now Brassonitis Morning Glory
&gt;&gt; Brassolaeliocattleya Golden Tang is now Marriottara Golden Tang
&gt;&gt; Epilaeliocattleya Don Herman is now Epicatanthe Don Herman
&gt;&gt; Otaara Jane Fumiye is now Peetersara Jane Fumiye
&gt;&gt; The new nomenclature in effect obsoletes all currently-published orchid
&gt;&gt; databases. OrchidWiz has already incorporated the changes into
&gt;&gt; Encyclopedia 4.01 (the September update) which will start shipping in the
&gt;&gt; next few days. The new version will include thousands of new
&gt;&gt; registrations as well as the June AQ. Please note all existing awards,
&gt;&gt; contributed photos and other historical data will remain under the old
&gt;&gt; names which will be &quot;aliased&quot; (linked) to the new names.

&gt;&gt; If you subscribe to the Annual Maintenance Plan you will be receiving the
&gt;&gt; update in the mail within a week or two. From now on we are holding all
&gt;&gt; new orders of 4.0 (or upgrades to 4.0) until the new software ships.

&gt;&gt; We thank you for your patience on this matter. If you have questions,
&gt;&gt; comments or concerns, please contact a ... @orchidwiz.com.

Here's my question: Â Orchid Wiz keeps track of synonyms. Â That's good. Â It
most likely does this for species names, i.e. the Latin binomial of
naturally occurring plants....the ones that seem to change names every few
years as taxonomists fiddle. Â BUT does it keep track of the changes to
nothogenera; i.e. the names of artificial genera like Slc and Potinara?
....that would be EXCELLENT. Â Changes to nothogenera used to be nonexistent
but it's like the taxonomists have suddenly gotten a hold of them....

if you look up Ctna Why not will the program tell you it is an obsolete
synonym of Guaritonia Why Not or will it just present you with the new name
and leave you to post a question on a newsgroup about how your plant does
not show up in the database and urgent help is needed....

For my own part, I don't think I can memorize a whole new list of
nothogenera and their natural genus combinations. Â &quot;Just call it an orchid,
OKAY? Â And if you need more, call it Fred. and if you need to be specific,
call it O. Fred 'Red' and don't ask why... Â And BTW, don't water it every 7
days....water it when it needs it and don't ask how you can tell!!!!&quot;

Golly it's hot.

AFAIK, OW's next update (4.1) will keep track of the nothogenera changes.
That was the subject of Alex's last email, the one Diana cited at the start
of this thread. Â I have been given to understand that the AOS asked the RHS
not to proceed with these changes until the Far Lady had Sung at Miami's
WOC, but the RHS declined. Since they control the hybrid registration data
(ever since they took it over from the Sanders family) the RHS can do what
they want. You may want to ask the judges at Washington, danny may want to
ask the judges in Atlanta, SuE may want to ask the chair in Denver about
this in order to get their take on these changes. Â Our center will be
talking about these changes at our next meeting, but I don't know if that
means our next 'business meeting' (in November) or our next scheduled
judging (in Sept).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We would like to bring to your attention a recent change in genus names
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the International Register of Orchid Hybrids maintained by the RHS.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The change stems from the separation of Rhyncholaelia from Brassavola;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sophrolaeliocattleya Hazel Boyd is now Guarisophleya Hazel Boyd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cattleytonia Why Not is now Guaritonia Why Not

Ahhh. Â The list of name changes that accompanied that email blinded me to
everything else it said. Â Especially since I saw so many I own and would
need to
make a note of in my databases and on tags. Â I nearly blacked out, I'm
sure....I did get real dizzy.
Forgive me for not actually reading the message.

I think I will just wait and see.

In general, it will be decades before all the old tags all over the world
get sifted out of circulation.

&gt; AFAIK, OW's next update (4.1) will keep track of the nothogenera changes.

&gt; the RHS not to proceed with these changes until the Far Lady had Sung at

&gt; the RHS can do what they want. You may want to ask the judges at

&gt;&gt; Here's my question: Â Orchid Wiz keeps track of synonyms. Â That's good.
&gt;&gt; It most likely does this for species names, i.e. the Latin binomial of
&gt;&gt; naturally occurring plants....the ones that seem to change names every
&gt;&gt; few years as taxonomists fiddle. Â BUT does it keep track of the changes
&gt;&gt; to nothogenera; i.e. the names of artificial genera like Slc and
&gt;&gt; Potinara? ....that would be EXCELLENT. Â Changes to nothogenera used to be
&gt;&gt; nonexistent but it's like the taxonomists have suddenly gotten a hold of
&gt;&gt; them....

&gt;&gt; if you look up Ctna Why not will the program tell you it is an obsolete
&gt;&gt; synonym of Guaritonia Why Not or will it just present you with the new
&gt;&gt; name and leave you to post a question on a newsgroup about how your plant
&gt;&gt; does not show up in the database and urgent help is needed....

&gt;&gt; For my own part, I don't think I can memorize a whole new list of
&gt;&gt; nothogenera and their natural genus combinations. Â &quot;Just call it an
&gt;&gt; orchid, OKAY? Â And if you need more, call it Fred. and if you need to be
&gt;&gt; specific, call it O. Fred 'Red' and don't ask why... Â And BTW, don't
&gt;&gt; water it every 7 days....water it when it needs it and don't ask how you
&gt;&gt; can tell!!!!&quot;

I heard a while back that there is going to be a meeting at the WOC to
discuss orchid naming, and that major changes would be held off until then.
Obviously the changes are happening anyway. Â Asking the local judges may or
may not get you any useful information, I think there are just a few people
really knowledgeable about what's currently going on. Â If your center will
be discussing the changes maybe Ron will be visiting from AOS, he's in the
middle of the whole mess and knows more than most about what's going on.

The renaming of species is fairly common in the plant world, it probably
just doesn't affect as many of us amateur horticulturists when a moss or
tree changes names. Â There isn't any other group with horticultural names
like orchids. Â One future possibility would be to drop the nothogenera
entirely and just name the hybrids by breeding group, that would stop all
the name changing. Â Every hybrid in the Cattleya alliance would just be
called a Cattleya (or some other single name). Â Something that could happen
in a few years, or not. Â I'm not sure there's really much point in having
the nothogenera anyway. Â Even grex names are questionable if you make it
several times with different parental clones. Â Registration by parent clonal
names would be most accurate, anything else is a bit iffy once you get past
the primary hybrid stage.

In the RHS database you don't need to specify a genus (they changed that a
few years back), and probably shouldn't anymore. Â Just put in the grex name
and then look at what genera come back, and then you may have to click on a
few of the new ones to figure out which used to be a Cattleya :-)

about the names anyway -- many immediately discard the nametags like the
price tags on clothing, I can tell because I find them littering the parking
lot. Â Of the other 10%, more than half still refer to digbyana as a
Brassavola and what used to be the Encyclias as Epidendrums, so I seriously
doubt they'll come looking for any Guari-whatevers. Â The remaining 3 or 4

I think Kenni and Danny are right. Â I think the RHS has been pushing to make
&quot;Cattlya&quot; a generic name for many years now and we hobbyists have freaked
that the hybrid registration pages would be lost. Â Rather like the AKC or
Horse breeders dropping their pedigree lines. Â (I think the orchid hybrid
registry goes back farther than breeding lines, but I may be wrong...) Â The
*increasing* advent of non-registered hybrids such as Den Emma White also
clouds the hybrid registry. Â True non registered hybrids were used in
hybridization programs in the past, but not at the rate the Thais and Taiwan
breeders crank them out today.

And Kenni is right that anyone who is interested will just have to do the
research themselves. Â The preponderance of hobbyists just can't be bothered,
what with the complexities of modern life. Hmmm..... pay your taxes, keep
the kids off drugs, watch the presidential debates and figure out if your
orchid is a guarthanthe whatever.... the orchid would fall pretty far off my
radar, just ahead of the presidential debates, LOL!

As for me I'm ignoring it. Â And lighting a candle for Alex Maxiamano (sp)
who has to pay attention.....

Yes its enough, or has been in my experience. Â In our 100F days it keeps the
GH at a little higher than ideal temps, about 86-7 or so at the bench

Our temps here have been in the mid-to-upper 90's recently (hard to
believe our winters can reach 0 degrees and occasionally even below that
- who the heck designed this place to be both dangerously hot AND
dangerously cold? And why did ANYONE ever settle here?) and the new GH
is running a bit warmer than I'd like, at 82-84 or so; one swamp cooler
isn't enough and I think I need two. But for now, I can only get it down
to said 82-84 by hosing down the gravel in the afternoon (before I tried
that it was in fact in the lower 90's), but it does help a great deal.
And of course the role of the 50% shadecloth shouldn't be ignored as a
cooling tool.

Many, many thanks are due to all the folk who said I should have a
gravel floor and not poured concrete as I wanted. It REALLY helps cool -
the temp drops anywhere from 6-10 degrees after I hose it down. And
STAYS there!

Of course we're having a double cooling crisis this summer - the house's
central air went out and no-one will even come out to do an estimate on
replacing the compressor because they're booked through fall already. I
would normally just tough it out, but then there are OUR little
parasites, the dogs, to consider, who would not survive 95+ in the house
while we're at work even with the windows open (Shar-Pei don't handle
heat well) so we're making do with two window units which keep the main
floor livable for now.

&gt;&gt; OrchidWiz Alert: Name Changes

&gt;&gt; We would like to bring to your attention a recent change in genus names
&gt;&gt; in the International Register of Orchid Hybrids maintained by the RHS.
&gt;&gt; The change stems from the separation of Rhyncholaelia from Brassavola;
&gt;&gt; Guarianthe from Cattleya; the change from Brazilian Laelias to
&gt;&gt; Sophronites; and the separation of Schomburgkia into Myrmecophila and
&gt;&gt; Laelia.

&gt;&gt; The changes to Laeliinae species caused a massive domino effect
&gt;&gt; throughout hybrid nomenclature, impacting many thousands of crosses. The
&gt;&gt; transformation is drastic and inescapable. To give you some examples of
&gt;&gt; popular hybrids affected:

&gt;&gt; Brassolaeliocattleya Goldenzelle in now Rhynchosophrocattleya Goldenzelle
&gt;&gt; (click link to see)
&gt;&gt; Sophrolaeliocattleya Hazel Boyd is now Guarisophleya Hazel Boyd
&gt;&gt; Cattleytonia Why Not is now Guaritonia Why Not
&gt;&gt; Laeliocattleya Trick or Treat is now Sophranthe Trick or Treat
&gt;&gt; Cattleya Chocolate Drop is now Cattlianthe Chocolate Drop
&gt;&gt; Brassocattleya Maikai is now Brassanthe Maikai
&gt;&gt; Brassolaeliocattleya Momilani Rainbow is now Thwaitesara Momilani Rainbow
&gt;&gt; Brassolaelia Morning Glory is now Brassonitis Morning Glory
&gt;&gt; Brassolaeliocattleya Golden Tang is now Marriottara Golden Tang
&gt;&gt; Epilaeliocattleya Don Herman is now Epicatanthe Don Herman
&gt;&gt; Otaara Jane Fumiye is now Peetersara Jane Fumiye
&gt;&gt; The new nomenclature in effect obsoletes all currently-published orchid
&gt;&gt; databases. OrchidWiz has already incorporated the changes into
&gt;&gt; Encyclopedia 4.01 (the September update) which will start shipping in the
&gt;&gt; next few days. The new version will include thousands of new
&gt;&gt; registrations as well as the June AQ. Please note all existing awards,
&gt;&gt; contributed photos and other historical data will remain under the old
&gt;&gt; names which will be &quot;aliased&quot; (linked) to the new names.

IMHO, they are effectively &quot;lost&quot; now, because they will be so difficult to
use -- esp. for planning purposes (breeding new hybrids). Â I predict an
overall decrease in the number of new hybrids made -- dabblers, who have
made some really nice ones, will decide it's too much trouble -- and of
those still produced, a great increase in &quot;trade names&quot; like that Den. Emma
White. Â It isn't only Taiwan and Thailand who have begun to rebel, I see
more and more US nurseries selling unregistered hybrids, with and without
awards.

Other problems with the whole mess come up in the interaction between AOS
and RHS, and then what how Helga (if WildCatt is still around) and Alex
handle it. Â For example, the award on my Smbcna. (currently Ctph, last I
looked) Garnet Glory 'HCC/AOS' got dropped out of WildCatt for a couple of
years because, while RHS decided that it was a Ctph, AOS continued to list
the award as having been given to an Smbcna (or at least that's why Helga
told me it was left out, when I inquired). Â Alex did a better job (at least
from my point of view), but his product was not yet in wide circulation.
Others may seek awards for the personal satisfaction, but personally, if I'm
going to spend half a day dragging a plant to judging and then pay for the
award, I WANT the publicity -- to help me sell those 2000 clones ...

BTW to Diana: Â Apologies, I know you like your tags accurate (although what
constitutes &quot;accurate&quot; seems to be somewhat debatable at the moment ...),
but not even for _you_ am I going to relabel 15 or 20 thousand plants!

May I ask why changing names is such a big deal? after all, the people
who create new hybrids are supposed to do their research anyway.
Changing names wont mean hybridization becomes suddenly more difficult.
The plants are the same. I think it is very unlikely that commercial
growers and serious hobbyists suddenly will stop hybridization just
because the name of the crosses is different.

And as for the nurseries selling unregistered hybrids. it's nothing new
or a big deal after all. Those plants are marketed for mass consumption
as decorative plants. Many growers don't care about AOS awards or RHS
registration, they just want to produce as many blooming plants as they
can for valentine's, mother's day, etc. And most consumers don't care
about tags either, nor should they be required. Again I fail to see how
these changes will make any difference.

Louis, so if it wasn't such a big deal and any serious person would do their
research anyway then why change them in the first place? Â Just to make the
names align with &quot;current&quot; thought? Â We are seeing great changes in
'current' thought and there's as yet no agreement on what 'current' thought
is ... Â so what's the rush?

And as for unregistered hybrids, the trouble is they don't stay in the mass
market, they sneak into hybridizing efforts. Â  There are plenty of 'unknown'
parentage in the hybrid registry, and it makes for interesting discussions
about whether a plant truly is what it purports to be. Â But rememeber it
limits the ability for someone to remake a cross with better parentage as
breeding lines improve if they are dealing with 'unknowns'.

Louis: Â Obviously, new hybrids will continue to be made, but some percentage
of the folks who have been doing it till now are going to decide it's just
too much trouble. Â K's point about attempted re-makes is quite valid (take a
look at the &quot;family tree&quot; of Blc. Goldenzelle, for example, and then picture
it after all the name changes ...). Â But I think more would-be hybridizers
would rather make a *new* cross (so they can name it, or in the case of a
commercial grower, so that they can have an &quot;exclusive,&quot; etc.). Â Trying to
determine that one's proposed cross does not already exist, under some name
or another, is going to be a LOT more difficult. Â Kenni

Hi Diana,

Let me through in my two cents.

It must be time for money grant among the PHD's. Every time it happens we
get these kind of change. Now I like change, but I tend to measure change in
terms of 'VALUE ADD'. As far as I can see, the only value add is to the book
and data base suppliers so they can sell more books.
I Â really get upset at these 'academic make work projects' and the resulting
trouble they cause.

Roy

&gt; OrchidWiz Alert: Name Changes

&gt; We would like to bring to your attention a recent change in genus names in
&gt; the International Register of Orchid Hybrids maintained by the RHS. The
&gt; change stems from the separation of Rhyncholaelia from Brassavola;
&gt; Guarianthe from Cattleya; the change from Brazilian Laelias to
Sophronites;
&gt; and the separation of Schomburgkia into Myrmecophila and Laelia.

&gt; The changes to Laeliinae species caused a massive domino effect throughout
&gt; hybrid nomenclature, impacting many thousands of crosses. The
transformation
&gt; is drastic and inescapable. To give you some examples of popular hybrids
&gt; affected:

&gt; Brassolaeliocattleya Goldenzelle in now Rhynchosophrocattleya Goldenzelle
&gt; (click link to see)
&gt; Sophrolaeliocattleya Hazel Boyd is now Guarisophleya Hazel Boyd
&gt; Cattleytonia Why Not is now Guaritonia Why Not
&gt; Laeliocattleya Trick or Treat is now Sophranthe Trick or Treat
&gt; Cattleya Chocolate Drop is now Cattlianthe Chocolate Drop
&gt; Brassocattleya Maikai is now Brassanthe Maikai
&gt; Brassolaeliocattleya Momilani Rainbow is now Thwaitesara Momilani Rainbow
&gt; Brassolaelia Morning Glory is now Brassonitis Morning Glory
&gt; Brassolaeliocattleya Golden Tang is now Marriottara Golden Tang
&gt; Epilaeliocattleya Don Herman is now Epicatanthe Don Herman
&gt; Otaara Jane Fumiye is now Peetersara Jane Fumiye
&gt; The new nomenclature in effect obsoletes all currently-published orchid
&gt; databases. OrchidWiz has already incorporated the changes into
Encyclopedia
&gt; 4.01 (the September update) which will start shipping in the next few
days.
&gt; The new version will include thousands of new registrations as well as the
&gt; June AQ. Please note all existing awards, contributed photos and other
&gt; historical data will remain under the old names which will be &quot;aliased&quot;
&gt; (linked) to the new names.

&gt; If you subscribe to the Annual Maintenance Plan you will be receiving the
&gt; update in the mail within a week or two. From now on we are holding all
new
&gt; orders of 4.0 (or upgrades to 4.0) until the new software ships.

&gt; We thank you for your patience on this matter. If you have questions,
&gt; comments or concerns, please contact a ... @orchidwiz.com.

&gt; Best wishes,

&gt; - The team at OrchidWiz

competitors, OTOH ... Kenni

Alex, given his druthers, I suspect would rather not have this extra work.

Ordinarily I'd be compassionate but as I grow Australian orchids I
have an insatiable desire to chuckle in a 'Let's see how you like it!'
kind of way :-)
