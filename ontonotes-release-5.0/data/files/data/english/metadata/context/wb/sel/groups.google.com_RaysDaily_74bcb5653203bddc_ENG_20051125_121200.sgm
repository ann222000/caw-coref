Friday

November 25, 2005

Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing
before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet;
and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it
requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping
into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off--then, I
account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.

Herman Melville

I don't know what a hypo is, but I do know what a damp, drizzly November is,
so like Captain Ahab I am off to sea. No whales for us though, we will be
sailing on the Mariner of the Seas to a few Caribbean Islands leaving this
weekend. I know it is rough duty but someone has to do it. If you look real
close in the picture above you may see me lounging on my balcony on deck
nine. We will be sailing with our favorite cruise agent and about one
hundred of her customers. For us it will be special because we will be
joined by my recovered Brother-in-law, my sister-in-law and eight other old
friends.

OK, I didn't mean to rub it in; I just wanted to explain why the presses
that generate the daily are being shut down for a week. As most of you know
we cruise often, we like it because it is reasonable, relatively hassle
free, and always relaxing, at least for me. I am up very early each morning
reading and drinking coffee on the top deck or in the concierge lounge. I am
known to nap once or twice during the day and it has been reported that I am
often seen in the ships casino, I don't deny it. Since I am not allowed to
drink anymore I have to find other ways to give the cruise line my money. I
have cut down on my dining, instead of eating six or more times each day, I
have cut back to four or five, it seems to work, I only gained one pound on
my last cruise.

Of course we will see a few shows, including the Mariner's great Ice Skating
show. As always I'll go ashore and leave my wife in the shops as I drift
about, not swimming, just visiting, and I am sure stopping by one of the
local casinos. I don't buy much, usually only some ship memento, but I do
always bring back memories of new friends. Many of you I met years ago when
we cruised together and some of us sailed together as recently as a few
months ago.

So my friends, fond farewell, enjoy your week, and even though you won't be
with me, I wish you were, you can still think &quot;warm&quot;. See you when I get
back.

I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in
what direction we are moving: To reach the port of heaven, we must sail
sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it - but we must sail, and not
drift, nor lie at anchor.

&quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Hello! Mr. Michaels?&quot;

&quot;Speaking.&quot;

&quot;How are you today?&quot;

&quot;OK so far...&quot;

&quot;My name is Debbie from Pointless Industries, and I'm calling to offer you a
fabulous new offer that we are offering....&quot;

&quot;Who is this really?&quot;

&quot;My name is Debbie from---&quot;

&quot;How did you get this number?&quot;

&quot;Well.. you are on our list of preferred---&quot;

&lt;urgent whisper&gt;&quot;Listen to me, and listen good! You tell Hugo and his goons
I lived up to my end of the deal! I cut up the bodies like he said, I
ditched the car like he said, now I'm out of it, understand? You tell him he
bothers me or my family again and I take everything I know to the Man, and
don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about!&quot;

&lt;hang up&gt;

Martin, a trendy dresser, fancied himself quite a lady-killer, and was
delighted to find a note pinned inside a new shirt. It contained a girl's
name and address, and asked the recipient to send a photograph. &quot;How
romantic,&quot; he thought to himself, very taken with the idea of this mystery
woman so eager to meet him, and promptly mailed off a note and a photo.

Heart aflutter, he opened her response. It read, &quot;Thanks for writing. I was
just curious to see what kind of guy would buy such a goofy shirt.&quot;

A grandmother was pushing her little grandchild around Walmart in a buggy.
Each time she put something in the basket she said &quot;And here's something for
you Diploma&quot; and &quot;there's something for you Diploma&quot;. And this carried on.

Eventually a bewildered shopper who'd heard all this finally asked &quot;Why do
you keep calling your grandchild Diploma?&quot;

Replied the grandmother, &quot;I sent my daughter to college and this is all she
came back with!&quot;

Thank you for holding. This call may be monitored for quality purposes.

Of course, if we really cared about quality we'd hire more people to answer
the phone.

Bernie and Faye, a wealthy couple, are coming up to their 50th wedding
anniversary and Faye has been thinking for some months about how they should
celebrate. Then she comes to a decision.

&quot;Bernie,&quot; she says, &quot;I'm going to book us a wonderful 6 weeks cruise. I know
you don't like ships because you got sea sick last time, but trust me, this
one will be perfect for us. It's called 'Bubbeh of the Sea,' an intimate
seven-star luxury liner with everything kosher we could ever want to eat
made available. Let's give it a go.&quot;

Bernie certainly isn't pleased with Faye's decision, but who is he to argue
- he could never win. So he says, &quot;OK dear.&quot;

On the day of the cruise, Bernie and Faye drive up to the dock in their
Bugatti Veyron 16.4. Captain Cohen is on the bridge as they pass by and
calls in the purser. &quot;Find out who they are and invite them to dine at my
table tonight.&quot;

Later, the purser knocks on the door of the Royal State Room. When Faye
answers the door, the purser says, &quot;Compliments of Captain Cohen, madam. He
would very much like you both to dine with him this evening.&quot;

Bernie comes to the door and says, &quot;Who is it Faye, is there a problem?&quot;

&quot;This man says that Captain Cohen wants us to eat with him this evening,&quot;
replies Faye.

&quot;I told you we shouldn't have come,&quot; says Bernie, &quot;seven-star or no
seven-star, we have only been on this boat half-an-hour and already we have
to eat with the crew.&quot;

She said: &quot;Stop asking me for more details. I already told you more than I
heard.&quot;

A cowboy rode into town and stopped at the saloon for a drink.
Unfortunately, the locals always had a habit of picking on newcomers. When
he left the bar some time later, he realized that his horse had been stolen.

The cowboy rushed back into the bar, handily flipped his gun into the air,
caught it above his head without even looking, and then fired a shot into
the ceiling. &quot;Who stole my horse!&quot; he yelled with surprising forcefulness.

No one answered.

&quot;I'm gonna have another beer and if my horse ain't back outside by the time
I'm finished, I'm gonna do what I did back in Texas. And let me tell you, I
don't wanna have to do what I did back in Texas!&quot;

Some of the locals looked at each other and shifted restlessly.

The cowboy had another beer, then walked outside to find his horse was back
. So, he saddled up and prepared to ride out of town. The bartender wandered
out of the bar and said, &quot;Say partner, what happened in Texas anyway?&quot;

The cowboy turned back and replied, &quot;I had to walk home!&quot;

&quot;Don't be dismayed at good-byes. A farewell is necessary before you can meet
again.

And meeting again after a moment or lifetime is certain for those who are
friends.&quot;
