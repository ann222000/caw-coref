Yup.
One show I watched predicted that eventually the melting of polar ice
would push the gulf stream further south until it disappeared. That in
turn would bring the jet stream further south in North America causing
a mini ice age, aided by similar disruptions in the Pacific.
It's been unstable for a few years now anyway.
Normally it hits between Winnipeg and Grand Forks which is why North
Dakota and Minnesota as a whole get more snow and warmer temperatures
than Manitoba and NW Ontario as well as the extreme northern parts of
ND and MN.
The recent weather which caused it to be as cold in M-SP and brought
snow to Texas is caused when the jet stream is sucked down to Nebraska
and Kansas. The south side of the Jet stream is where the warmer moist
air hits the cold front and dumps the snow.
In Winnipeg, we usually only get snow when a large system from the
south pushes the stream north.

Surprise! I *know* that! It's called humor -- come on in. ;-)

The fact that the earth naturally cycles from ice age to temperate age
and back again pretty much makes global warming a prima facie reality
in my opinion. So, just so long as you're not gonna rattle off some
nonsense like "It's being caused by humans," you'll get no argument

Aw, c'mon, Tim. You're not going to be the last person to admit it,
are you? Even the Pres's own guys now realize humans have had a major
part in it. The evidence is in.

Corrollaries do not automatically signify cause and effect. I'm still
not buying. I'm more apt to believe this theory:

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/07/18/wsun1...

"Global warming has finally been explained: the Earth is getting hotter
because the Sun is burning more brightly than at any time during the
past 1,000 years, according to new research. A study by Swiss and
German scientists suggests that increasing radiation from the sun is
responsible for recent global climate changes. Dr Sami Solanki, the
director of the renowned Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research
in Gottingen, Germany, who led the research, said: 'The Sun has been at
its strongest over the past 60 years and may now be affecting global
temperatures.'"

It's important to keep in mind that Human Contribution Theory is just
that -- a theory. We should take all of it with the grain of salt it
deserves, and certainly shouldn't be basing environmental law around
it. That's a very dangerous social policy.

Well, the last time we had significant snow (meaning it actually stuck)
was three years ago. It happens, but is a rarity. It's even worse today
after having snowed all night. I'll try to post a little more video
before dark.

C'mon, Turby. You're smarter than this. The sky is not falling, so
don't be a Chicken Little.

"As they review the bizarre and unpredictable weather patterns of the
past several years, a growing number of scientists are beginning to
suspect that many seemingly contradictory meteorological fluctuations
are actually part of a global climatic upheaval ... The trend shows no
indication of reversing. Climatological Cassandras are becoming
increasingly apprehensive, for the weather aberrations they are
studying may be the harbinger of another ice age." -- Time Magazine,
1974

"Brace Yourself for Another Ice Age" -- D. Collingan, Science Digest,
February 1975

"Once the freeze starts, it will be too late." -- Science Digest,
February 1973

"According to George Kukla of Columbia University, satellite photos
indicated a sudden, large increase in Northern Hemisphere snow cover in
the winter of 1971-72. And a study released last month by two NOAA
scientists notes that the amount of sunshine reaching the ground in the
continental U.S. diminished by 1.3 percent between 1964 and 1972.
Climatologists are pessimistic that political leaders will take any
positive action to compensate for the climatic change, or even to allay
its effects." -- Newsweek, April 1975

Politicians and governments are using the fear and ignorance
surrounding Human Contribution Theory for nothing other than amassing
more power and money. Twenty-five years from now, we'll be laughing at
what we believed was happening, just like the "Ice Age" nonsense of the
'70s and 80's.

The primary difference between a scientific fact and a scientific
theory is that  a theory breaks down or becomes ambiguous at a certain
point: Human Contribution Theory, Evolutionary Theory, Unified Field
Theory, M Theory -- the list goes on. That's not say that certain
aspects of them aren't correct and useful, but to simply leave them
as-is, accepted and unquestioned, is an irresponsible policy. Why does
no one argue against the regular questioning and refinement of, say,
String Theory for example -- yet so many are willing to lovingly accept
Human Contribution Theory as gospel? The answer: Politics and Social
Engineering.

Like I said before, a theory is a theory. When we stop skepticizing an
unproven theory simply because of its social significance, science is
bastardized.

Carefu here, or you'll soon be arguing my assertions for me. General
and Specific Relativity only work to a certain point. There beyond,
they either fail or cannot be physically proven. Einstein literally

theories. He didn't succeed.

the oil cartels' decision to invade Iraq. Everyone knows that

Now while I agree with your sentiment I have to ask, what exactly does
crap, read pollution, have to do with the theory of global warming.

Equating air pollution with global warming is one of the latest urban
myths. A myth the global warming advocates fail to correct.

CO2 is produced naturally in our environment and not considered air
pollution. I mean, hell, trees produce copious quantities of CO2.

And guess how one of the other greenhouse gases, methane, is produced?
Let's ban beans, especially the spicy kind.

In fact just a few weeks back I read a report gas from cattle is the
major contributor of greenhouse gas in Canada. Stop cows from farting
and Canada can meet our Kyoto targets.

This whole topic is the latest flavour of the month for the
environmentalists.

Is it a problem? Possibly.

Should we be conscious of the problem and do what is reasonable to
reduce the production of greenhouse gas? Sure.

But should we turn our entire economy and way of life upside down in a
lame and fruitless attempt to meet our outrageous Kyoto targets? Of
course not.

Kyoto is a flawed process that has done more to defeat the global
warming cause in Canada than all the bad gas produced by cattle.

Well, that non-existent empirical evidence you're talking about has got

I don't care what politicians say. I'm not going to be around, and I

politicians do, they screw it up, one way or the other. I figure we're
past the point of no return, anyway, and even if they decide to do
_something_, it won't work. But I see the overwhelming number of pure
scientists who are not advocating action, just reporting data, saying
that humans are a major cause.

As for past follies, the science of climatology is lightyears ahead of
where it was 30 years ago.

In any case, I figure as Bob Weir said, I may be going to hell in a
bucket, but I'm sure enjoying the ride.

To be fair, my statement was as misleading as many of the pro global
warming theorists have made. Predominately photosynthesis does convert
C02 and water into oxygen using light as an energy source. However if
my high school biology was correct in the absence of light the process
will release CO2.

That's how I understand it. And yes, most trees spend a considerable
fraction of their lives producing CO2. Most trees must respirate
constantly in addition to photosynthesis (which is seasonal in most
climates, anyway). The byproduct is CO2.

Also, I've been told that the older and closer to death a tree gets,
the more CO2 it produces.

Yep. And the prevalent point of view in the '70s and early '80s was
