1. A few weeks ago, a representative from a *major* long distance
carrier used a blatant lie to trick me into making a recorded statement
on the telephone that could be construed as authorizing a switch to
their service. Basically, the representative told me (*told*, not
*implied*!) that their records showed that they had been our
longstanding long distance provider, but that another company had tried
to switch us without our authorization. He asked me to confirm, for
their records, that I intended to &quot;stay&quot; with their service, so that
they could block the switch. Since I do not normally handle our
telephone bills, I took his statement at face value and gave them the
statement they wanted (characteristically, as we later found out, it was
taken by a different operator who hadn't made the initial
misrepresentation to me). After hanging up, my wife informed me that
they had *never* been our long distance provider, and that she had
already had to fend off several similar ploys from the same company in
previous weeks.

2. I *immediately* contacted our current local phone service, explained
the situation, and told them that I definitely did *not* want to switch
to the other carrier. The representative told me they could definitely
block the switch if I just provided her with either my birth date or the
last four digits of my social security number to confirm that I was who
I said I was (which I did). We assumed at that point that the matter was
settled.

3. The following month, we received a phone bill that included long
distance charges from the carrier mentioned in 1. It included something
like $140 for a 1.5 hour call overseas --- approximately TEN times the
rate we normally pay!!

4. We immediately contacted the long distance carrier in question and
protested the exorbitant charge, and protested the fact that we had been
switched in the first place based on a blatant misrepresentation. In
addition to the manner in which we had been switched in the first place,
we had never been advised of any unusual rates that would apply to
overseas calls. After *several hours* of arguing in vain with one
representative after another, we finally spoke with someone who agreed
to reduce the charge to what we normally would have paid with our
&quot;normal&quot; carrier. She even gave us a confirmation number!

5. This morning (just a couple of weeks later), we received a call from
a collection agency concerning the $140 charge. He claimed to be
unimpressed by our story or by the confirmation number cited above.

6. We called the carrier again, and they claimed to have no record of
any discussions of the type described under 4. They claimed to only
have our original recorded statement authorizing the switch (see 1.).
We told them that if that was the case, then we would have no choice but
to record all future conversations with them. The representative
claimed that would be illegal. We said it wouldn't be if we informed
them, and if they didn't like it, they could hang up and all future
exchanges with us would have to be in writing.

That's where it stands, as of today. We are at wit's end. This morning,
after talking to the long distance company again, my wife was in tears
from anger and frustration.

The above story only gives the highlights. We have been lied to, and
sometimes even verbally abused, again and again whenever we spoke to
company representatives, and it now appears to be *beyond our ability*
to permanently regain control of who our long distance carrier is, let
alone whether we have to pay that exorbitant bill. We can't even trust
our own local phone service to block a change, even when they assure us
that they *will* block the change. And we are absolutely appalled that
what we had previously thought of as a reputable, well-known long
distance company would resort to these kinds of tactics in the first place.

Now, of course, we are also concerned about what they will do to our
credit report if we refuse to pay the charge.

Our instinct is to contact the FTC and file a formal complaint. But we
are deterred by two things: (1) our inability to document *in detail*
many of the conversations that took place (it never occurred to us that
the company would intentionally, and repeatedly, disregard our wishes,
or misrepresent their own actions), and (2) our sense that regulatory
oversight of large corporations is not exactly a high priority in
Washington right now.

Complicating matters is the fact that the company passed us around to
many different representatives on the phone in a way that seemed to us
to be deliberately calculated to destroy any continuity in (or
reconstructable record of) the discussion or handling of our case, and
to give each representative &quot;plausible deniability&quot; regarding what
transpired in the previous conversation. Much of the time we have spent
on the phone has consisted of repeating, for the umpteenth time, the
details of what we had just told a previous representative!

The second instinct is to try to find other customers with similar
stories and see whether some kind of punitive civil action could be
initiated against companies that engage in this kind of behavior.
Unfortunately, we certainly don't have the resources to take on a huge
corporation on our own, so we're hoping there is an agency or firm
(public or private) with both the ability and the desire to expose and
punish these kinds of consumer abuses.

The third instinct is to try to embarrass the company in some kind of
public forum; e.g., by sicing the press on them. But we realize that
the likelihood of our particular case, taken in isolation, arousing the
interest of a 60 Minutes-type show is zilch. What would be needed is a
gaggle of victims with nearly identical stories, combined with some
interest on the part of the press in going after a big name corporation.
Fat chance.

Hoping that someone here can see an effective avenue that we're not
seeing. If we roll over on this one, where will it end?

Why don't you name the major long distance company?

I hate all long-distance phone companies. The whole industry is a scam. A
long time ago, I switched to Qwest long distance. But they sucked, so I
switched to another long distance company. Months after the switch, I
noticed I was receiving $15 charges from Qwest every month (it was one of
those programs where they charge you a minimum amount if you don't charge up
a high enough bill each month). I called Qwest to tell them to remove me
immediately and reimburse my charges. They said they couldn't remove me, I
needed to contact my local phone company to remove me. So I called
Ameritech, but they said I needed to contact Qwest to be removed. And the
runaround continued on while I was charged $15 each month.

The only solution is to avoid all long-distance companies period. Either use
a calling card, or use a cell phone.

I wish you the best luck in resolving your situation. You are definitely not
alone.

Grant,

I believe you. It looks like you were scammed, and slammed. The whole
system has been deregulated. Even major carriers are apparently doing
this stuff. A major carrier (Sprint) did similar to me last year.

The scam varies, but with the same idea... lies, confusion whatever
it takes to induce a consent. After that the new carrier basically
crams anything they can get away with onto your bill.
The agreement to reduce the bill followed by flat refusal or denial
also appears part of the game.
You thought they were in the telecom biz?? Such Naievity!

People who have international calls appear especially targeted, since
the default rates are $3-6 min, and the scam can yield a fair
amount of money for the carrier... $300 - $3000 per.
After all, a $30 scam is hardly worth doing, right?

If you roll, it doesn't end. Its impractical to sue them, its probably

impractical for them to sue you. If you don't owe the charge, perhaps
you shouldn't pay it. They might slam your credit and refuse to do
business with you in future.

The dispute resolution procedure you encountered is more fraud. They
agree to reduce the charges, to delay and wear you down, then deny
it.They make sure its your word against their records.
Its pretty outrageous.

The most important thing to remember is.... don't be too upset, its
part of the world. There are scamsters and criminals in the world,
even in high corporate offices. Especially in the telecom industry.
So the wife should stop crying, its not her or your fault.

Its probably not productive to call them again. Their dispute
resolution is more scam. Pay them, sue them, or deny the charge
in writing and wait for them to sue you.

Whatever you choose, you might consider refering the matter to the
FBI re wire fraud. See if they have any interest in the matter.
Send them this post and the particulars. Let folks here know what
happens. Don't tell the carrier.

Good luck.

"/> Oh yea? I don't think so.
You apparently sell cellular services?

For example:
The minutes over plan are 45+cents/min. I had Sprint tell a friend
that they couldn't even provide the minutes used for the first month
or so AFTER ANY CHANGE IN PLAN! and won't waive overplan charges.

So what plan did you say you had? 1200 minutes? Liar, you had the 300
minute plan. You used 1200 minutes. That will be 900 minutes at $0.45
for a total of $49.95 plus $405 plus taxes etc..... total $465.28
which appeared on your Visa which you provided us for billing.
They've already been paid!

You can complain to customer dispute resolution.
Ask Grant about how that works. He just went through it.

Look at the terms you signed. If you sue them you will
have to go to Delaware, or if in Delaware you have to go to Utah
and ARBITRATE. No court, no jury, no punitive damages,
no nothing but heartbreak and expense because the carrier
owns the specified arbitrator. Those BS terms are the
first sign they aren't planning to deal with you honestly.
Don't deal with crooks.
That's what I say.

"/> After a similar situation being slammed and crammed by MCI WorldCom,
Least Cost Routing, LCR, I contacted the Federal Communication
Commission (FCC). Their website is  www.fcc.gov  and contains their
telephone number.

They (FCC) were very helpful in providing regulations, forms, and
returning my call and explaining the action I needed to take. I wrote
the FCC with my formal complaint and requested the difference between
my original long distance fees and the &quot;new&quot; provider's charge be
credited to my local telephone service account. You will need to
provide the same explanation you provided below in your post with
copies in the change of provider and charges (I did) to get the matter
resolved. It took about 6 weeks, but the $+\- 80.00 was credited to
my account.

After you get the long distance provider you want to keep, you can
also formerly request your long distance provider record a &quot;pic-loc&quot;.
After this is done you must formally contact your long distance
provider to terminate service, rather than having any b.s. company
telling them you authorized the change. This also stops a lot of the
telemarketing calls.

&gt; representative after another, we finally spoke with someone who agreed
&gt; to reduce the charge to what we normally would have paid with our
&gt;&quot;normal&quot; carrier. She even gave us a confirmation number!

&gt; 5. This morning (just a couple of weeks later), we received a call from
&gt; a collection agency concerning the $140 charge. He claimed to be
&gt; unimpressed by our story or by the confirmation number cited above.

&gt; 6. We called the carrier again, and they claimed to have no record of
&gt; any discussions of the type described under 4. They claimed to only
&gt; have our original recorded statement authorizing the switch (see 1.).
&gt; We told them that if that was the case, then we would have no choice but
&gt; to record all future conversations with them. The representative
&gt; claimed that would be illegal. We said it wouldn't be if we informed
&gt; them, and if they didn't like it, they could hang up and all future
&gt; exchanges with us would have to be in writing.

&gt; That's where it stands, as of today. We are at wit's end. This morning,
&gt; after talking to the long distance company again, my wife was in tears
&gt; from anger and frustration.

&gt; The above story only gives the highlights. We have been lied to, and
&gt; sometimes even verbally abused, again and again whenever we spoke to
&gt; company representatives, and it now appears to be *beyond our ability*
&gt; to permanently regain control of who our long distance carrier is, let
&gt; alone whether we have to pay that exorbitant bill. We can't even trust
&gt; our own local phone service to block a change, even when they assure us
&gt; that they *will* block the change. And we are absolutely appalled that
&gt; what we had previously thought of as a reputable, well-known long
&gt; distance company would resort to these kinds of tactics in the first place.

&gt; Now, of course, we are also concerned about what they will do to our
&gt; credit report if we refuse to pay the charge.

&gt; Our instinct is to contact the FTC and file a formal complaint. But we
&gt; are deterred by two things: (1) our inability to document *in detail*
&gt; many of the conversations that took place (it never occurred to us that
&gt; the company would intentionally, and repeatedly, disregard our wishes,
&gt; or misrepresent their own actions), and (2) our sense that regulatory
&gt; oversight of large corporations is not exactly a high priority in
&gt; Washington right now.

&gt; Complicating matters is the fact that the company passed us around to
&gt; many different representatives on the phone in a way that seemed to us
&gt; to be deliberately calculated to destroy any continuity in (or
&gt; reconstructable record of) the discussion or handling of our case, and
&gt; to give each representative &quot;plausible deniability&quot; regarding what
&gt; transpired in the previous conversation. Much of the time we have spent
&gt; on the phone has consisted of repeating, for the umpteenth time, the
&gt; details of what we had just told a previous representative!

&gt; The second instinct is to try to find other customers with similar
&gt; stories and see whether some kind of punitive civil action could be
&gt; initiated against companies that engage in this kind of behavior.
&gt; Unfortunately, we certainly don't have the resources to take on a huge
&gt; corporation on our own, so we're hoping there is an agency or firm
&gt; (public or private) with both the ability and the desire to expose and
&gt; punish these kinds of consumer abuses.

&gt; The third instinct is to try to embarrass the company in some kind of
&gt; public forum; e.g., by sicing the press on them. But we realize that
&gt; the likelihood of our particular case, taken in isolation, arousing the
&gt; interest of a 60 Minutes-type show is zilch. What would be needed is a
&gt; gaggle of victims with nearly identical stories, combined with some
&gt; interest on the part of the press in going after a big name corporation.
&gt; Fat chance.

&gt; Hoping that someone here can see an effective avenue that we're not

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; 1. A few weeks ago, a representative from a *major* long distance
&gt; carrier used a blatant lie to trick me into making a recorded statement
&gt; on the telephone that could be construed as authorizing a switch to
&gt; their service. Basically, the representative told me (*told*, not
&gt; *implied*!) that their records showed that they had been our
&gt; longstanding long distance provider, but that another company had tried
&gt; to switch us without our authorization. He asked me to confirm, for
&gt; their records, that I intended to &quot;stay&quot; with their service, so that
&gt; they could block the switch. Since I do not normally handle our
&gt; telephone bills, I took his statement at face value and gave them the
&gt; statement they wanted (characteristically, as we later found out, it was
&gt; taken by a different operator who hadn't made the initial
&gt; misrepresentation to me). After hanging up, my wife informed me that
&gt; they had *never* been our long distance provider, and that she had
&gt; already had to fend off several similar ploys from the same company in
&gt; previous weeks.

&gt; 2. I *immediately* contacted our current local phone service, explained
&gt; the situation, and told them that I definitely did *not* want to switch
&gt; to the other carrier. The representative told me they could definitely
&gt; block the switch if I just provided her with either my birth date or the
&gt; last four digits of my social security number to confirm that I was who
&gt; I said I was (which I did). We assumed at that point that the matter was
&gt; settled.

&gt; 3. The following month, we received a phone bill that included long
&gt; distance charges from the carrier mentioned in 1. It included something
&gt; like $140 for a 1.5 hour call overseas --- approximately TEN times the
&gt; rate we normally pay!!

&gt; 4. We immediately contacted the long distance carrier in question and
&gt; protested the exorbitant charge, and protested the fact that we had been
&gt; switched in the first place based on a blatant misrepresentation. In
&gt; addition to the manner in which we had been switched in the first place,
&gt; we had never been advised of any unusual rates that would apply to
&gt; overseas calls. After *several hours* of arguing in vain with one

"/> You need to contact the utility commissioner in the state where you're
located. Each state calls it by a different name. In California it's
called &quot;Public Utility Commission&quot;, and here in Nebraska it's called
&quot;Nebraska Public Service Commission&quot;. You can find the name of the state
regulating office in the &quot;Consumer Information&quot; section of your local phone
directory.

Several years ago I had problems with a couple of long distance carriers in
California and the Public Utility Commissioner there investigated my
problems and cleared my billing errors/disputes. It was a long and
frustrating battle, but it was finally cleared up.

These long distance carriers are absolutely ruthless. I'm sure they've only
gotten worse since I had my problems with them.

Good luck,

Once again a series of stupid ignorant assinine replies to solving
a simple situation.

First, the FCC has a special division for incidents like this.
CALL THEM.

Second, your state PUC IS NOT the place to call for an issue against a
long distance company.

Third, you may need an attorney to get the credit collection company
off your back. As the FCC if they can help here. If not, then find the
attorney, but make sure it's one who knows Utility Law and Contract
Law. Not a damn ambulance chaser like we all see on Television.

Fourth, put yourself on the National and State Do Not Call Lists.

Fifth, have the meanest nastiest person you know kick you in the ass
for being stupid. This issue has been all over the media for years.
Next time a solicitor calls you for ANY reason, handg up the phone.

You did not say where (which state) you lived but in Texas this is codified
under the Civil statue as a Deceptive Trade Practice. Might check if your
state has a similar law.

Regardless I'd file a complaint (FTC, FCC and what ever state agency you
might have) and dispute the charges with the collection agency in hard copy.

might check into  www.onesuite.com  (prepaid long distance which also
provides a calling card option) depending on where you are the rate is
$0.029 or $0.025 per min.

I don't have any interest in this group. FWIW they have a referral program
where both parties get something on the order of $0.50 spiff to their
accounts. I'm not posting the referral code to avoid even the appearance of
spam.

May I suggest the first thing you do when a phone solicitor calls you, is to
say
&quot;please hold&quot; and PUT the phone down. Let them wait on hold waisting their
time.. until you here the hang up sound on the phone... then hang it up.
Also, you can get several good ANTI-tele-marketing scripts at
http://www.jerkz.com .
If you want a low cost, high quality, HONEST international long distance
provider, go to:  http://ld.net/?9111 . My mom has used them 6 years to call
my brother in Brazil and uncle in Sweden... has nothing but GOOD things to
say about this company. You couldn't pay her to switch!

Charlotte, NC and there is a local access number, I get the 2.5 cent/minute

pays the 2.9 cent rate.

BTW, their international call rates are dirt cheap as well. I seem to recall
that it was 11 cents per minute to call China (for example). I'm too lazy to
look it up now but that's what I remember. It's all on their website.

I started my account with a $10 prepayment. From what I've been able to gather,
you have 6 months to spend it.

Just do what I do-I have no long distance at home! If I need to make a long
distance call I just make it on my cell phone with my nationwide free
minutes. Four years ago AT&amp;T started charging me $20.00 a month minimum fee
plus taxes because I did not sign up for any of their billing plans. They
also charged me $ .70 a minute one month for 2 long distance calls I made.
I complained first, but their response was they wanted me to sing up for a
billing plan. Since I make only one or two long distance calls a month I
not only told them no, but cancelled my long distance on my land line. Four
years later, I don't miss anything, and have about an extra $1,000 in my
pocket.

Remember, I was informed by the caller that he was representing my
*existing* long distance carrier and that he was trying to prevent a
slammer from switching me without my authorization. In short, by
responding to his request, I mistakenly believed I was preventing,
rather than facilitating, precisely the kind of thing that the media has
been talking about. Clever.

My stupidity, in this case, was not realizing that my current long
distance carrier was in fact a different company than the one the caller
said he was representing. But since I have not handled our phone bills
in several years (my wife does that), it is - perhaps - an
understandable mistake.

Calling cards won't do anything for cellular minutes if that's
what you're thinking.

It's easy enough to analyze your calling pattern and determine
whether you're likely to go over your included minutes. If
necessary, your carrier will probably let you switch to a plan
with more minutes.

Also, keep an eye out for unlimited plans. There are a few
carriers offering unlimited calling (day or night) for a
pretty low price. I know a few people in the sticks who have
unlimited plans in the $50/month range and I recently saw one
of the major carriers doing it for $99/month.

"/> Well, I wouldn't go that far. I'm just cautious. There are certainly
cases where large corporations have abused their asymmetric access to
legal resources to make life difficult for private citizens with valid
complaints. I'm not saying it's likely in this case, but why tempt
fate? Once we've worked out exactly what we can document and what we
can't with 100% certainty, I'll be happy to go public with the details
as well as supplying that information to an appropriate authority.

On the other hand, you have a valid point. Our &quot;free&quot; country is
increasingly one which is more of a &quot;corporocracy&quot; than a democracy. An
ever shrinking number of large corporations control the news media and
the vast majority of radio stations in the U.S.; corporations have the
ear of the president on everything from environmental policy to energy
policy; corporations directly or indirectly fund the bulk of many
political campaigns, in return for political favors. And of course its
a few favored corporations that will get contracts from the U.S. to go
in and &quot;rebuild&quot; Iraq. &lt;sigh&gt;

&gt;hmmm, the charger cord works as a power cord and there's cig lighter

&gt;Is that the doorbell? Wonder if you land line reaches all the way to

"/> Hmmmm - some of us are clever enough to have a solution for each

My cordless 900 mhz phone reaches all the way to the front door, and
down the block if necessary. The battery usually lasts a couple of
weeks on standby - a couple of hours of talk time shouldn't be a
problem. If I get stuck on a long distance call, I can relax, knowing
that it's only costing me 2.9 cents per minute (or less).

I only use the cell phone when I'm away from home.

Yes, they can. As long as cell phone customers pay to receive
calls, the phones are off-limits to telemarketers. Most of the
national telemarketing companies are run by people smart enough
to purge cellular prefixes from their databases. I had my first
telemarketing call on my current cell phone just this weekend.
The guy hung up fast when I told him he'd called a cell phone.

I've been cellular only since 1999 and I can still count all of
the telemarketing calls I've received without taking off my
shoes. :)

You are the victim of what is now called 'slamming' in most states.
What this LD carrier did to you was against the law and violates FCC
regulations. Instead of contacting a lawyer, contact your local
District Attorney or your state's Attorney General's office for
assistance and you may find out that your state may have a
class-action lawsuit already started against them.

My guess is the LD company you are speaking of is either Sprint or
MCI, both of them are the largest culprits of 'slamming'.
