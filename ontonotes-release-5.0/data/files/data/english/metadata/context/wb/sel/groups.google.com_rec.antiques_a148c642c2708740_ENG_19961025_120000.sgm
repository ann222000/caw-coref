I understand that there is an auction scheduled for this Saturday,
October 26th, in the Harrisonburg, VA, area. The auctioneer is Charlie
Whetzel. I spoke to him three weeks ago, and he told me to contact him
for directions. I have been unable to reach him by phone. Can anyone
in cyberville tell me how to contact him or get info about this event?
Thanks.
