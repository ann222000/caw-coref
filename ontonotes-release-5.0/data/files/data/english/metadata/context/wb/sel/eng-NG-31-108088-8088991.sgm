and other stories of poorly maintained bikes:
saw a Honda rider pull into a parking lot with a 70's vintage CB350... rusty
pipes &lt;missing some of the baffles&gt;, at first I though the pipes were
smoking from the oil the bike was burning.. but NO it was the chain
smoking... I said &quot;you might want to oil that chain&quot;.. he just looked at me
with that divide by zero look and went inside...

The *CHAIN* was smoking?

I think we have a winner.

A guy I knew (now a financial expert married to a celebrity -- yeah, Brian,
I mean YOU!) had a decent bike with the entire rear end covered with red
dust.  I wouldn't ferry his new computer home for him until he walked across
the street to buy a can of chain lube.  Talk about divide by zero...

I *hate* bottom posting when the body of text being replied to is
longer than a page. I often delete 'em without bothering to scroll for
an hour to read the reply.

That said, I *prefer* bottom posting if the original context can be
trimmed and the corresponding reply both fit on a single page (or
close to it). Am I the exception, or does anyone else prefer it this
way also? I hate to change, but I guess I could if most people prefer
100% bottom posting?

Just do what seems right.

Do you want a standard or a procedure? If the procedure is &quot;bottom
post only&quot; then there's going to be times when the post will be
ignored by someone like you. And it could be lower case john with
something that could change your life, but you've just deleted it into
cyberspace :)

If the standard is &quot;do what makes the post most readable&quot; then there
are going to be times top posting makes sense (shudder) and times when
bottom posting makes sense, and times when snipping 90% of the post
makes sense.

Sorry, I'm still in manager mode for some reason...
