The Mariachi

The sound of the mariachi impregnates to the soul of a Mexican with all the range of feelings and emotions that a human being can feel in some moment. The letter of the songs interpreted by a mariachi resound in the mind to become images that evoke the memories or the hopes of a man or a woman, that perhaps in love, refuse to die without feeling how the vibrating love runs thru its veins, as by the loved one, its family, its ground and for its country. Nothing is more representative of what exists in the interior of a Mexican, that the Mariachi.

• Origin:

The most accepted theory is the one that distinguishes that the word “mariachi” was born among the coca tribe in Cocula, Jalisco in the XVI century. The coca tribe had exceptional skills to interpret the music and to imitate the sounds of the nature.
When the Spanish friars arrive to the region, they realized of the ability that the locals had to reproduce sounds and to interpret music with instruments created by them. When the friars saw this they decided to use the music as efficient tool to evangelize. It is mentioned that friar Miguel de Bolonia transform old melodies dedicated to Aztec ancient deities in praises to the Mother of Jesus, as well as to Saint Miguel Arcangel, emphasizing that the music was one of the languages that God used to communicate with his children.
With the conquest the coca tribe transformed their native rhythms adopting the Spanish instruments as the guitar and the violin. Displaying for the creation of new instruments, it is said that the native Justo Rodriguez Nixen invented the vihuela with a shell of armadillo, as the guitarron (large guitar) with cords of animal guts, both instruments have been updated and with out them the mariachi will be lack of its characteristic sound, full of life and color.

It is also mentioned that during the evangelism process the natives of the coca tribe started to worship “Maria del Rio” (River Mary), whose image was discover while some peasants plowed the land. Such event awoke the Virgin devotion creating her a praise that in one of its paragraphs it reads “Maria ce son”, that according to some studies means “The song of Mary”, that by been pronounce seemed that they were saying “Maria Shi” or “Maria She”, and that by saying it fast sounded as “mariachi”. According to this study the word “mariachi” comes from a religious song and not by the French word “marriage”, as other investigators mention.
Until the beginning of the XXth century, the mariachi music remained in the rural area, until in 1905 the mariachi begin to be considered as a picturesque group, worthy to appear on special places and events. Some stories describe that a group dressed as field man used to, attended to sing during a birthday of the president at the time, Porfirio Diaz.

On 1907, Porfirio Diaz used again the mariachi music to cheer a celebration offered in honor to the American State Secretary, Eliu Root. It is mention that in this occasion the mariachi of Guadalajara interpreted sounds and songs (sones y jarabes), while the charros in company of tapatias with regional wardrobes, danced at the sound of the music. It is also said that this was the first time that a mariachi dressed the charro attire.

• In the History

Although the mariachi is associated with the state of Jalisco, the tradition extended very fast to the neighboring states of Michoacán, Colima, Nayarit y Zacatecas.

In the important cities, groups of mariachi began to integrate and played at their main plazas, as well as in serenatas that congregated the whole town. The Plaza of Armas and the Agua Azul Park in Guadalajara were places that reached a great popularity because of the mariachi presentations.

Among the most famous styles is found the ones from Cocula, Tecalitlan and Sierra del Tigre. The first reference of recording music of mariachi music was in 1906. On 1925, the mariachi of Coco Andrade took part in the first wireless transmission in Mexico.
On 1930 some mariachis incorporated the trumpet to the string instruments, giving with this a touch of great resonance and color to their interpretations. On 1949 the singer Pedro Infante recorded the first song with a mariachi with two trumpets, invasion that originated a great commotion and success.
Uno de los mariachis más famosos en el mundo es el Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán, fundado por Silvestre Vargas, quien a todos los integrantes les enseño a leer la música, aspecto que represento todo un avance ya que hasta entonces los músicos de mariachi eran de oído o líricos. Muchos músicos de mariachi en la actualidad son verdaderos estudiosos que inclusive interpretan magistralmente la música clásica.
One of the most famous mariachis in the world is the Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan, founded by Silvestre Vargas, who taught all the members to read the music, aspect that represented a whole advance for by that time the mariachi musicians were of hearing or lyrics. Many mariachi musicians at present are true students who inclusively interpret classical music in a brilliant way.

• At Present:

The life of a Mexican would not be complete without listening to the music interpreted by the mariachi. Excuses or reasons never lack for the mariachi to approach and interpret the songs that according to the moment identifies the one listening with his life and mainly, with his mood.
At present a single place in all Mexico does not exist where the mariachi is not listened. For something has become the most representative of our essence. It is through musicians and their instruments, the wardrobe, the letter of the songs, the rhythms and the sounds that mariachi gives to us, that we can feel and discover the beautiful part of our culture, that through time has become combining to represent the “real acceptation” that through the mixture of races and cultures can achieve a key point where the result tells us that all has been good and will continue well and will be marvelous for all.

In all the destinies of our country exist infinity of opportunities as Mexican celebrations, weddings, bars, cantinas, restaurants, plazas and various events to see and listen to mariachi in action, traditionally accompanied by good tequila. To visit Mexico without listening to the mariachi would be like visiting Paris without stopping to contemplate the Eiffel Tower.
And as the mariachi sings to its mother land:

"México lindo y querido
si muero lejos de ti
que digan que estoy dormido
y que me traigan aquí".
“que digan que estoy dormido
y que me traigan aquí".

(Mexico beautiful and loved
if I die far from you
let them say I’m slept
and let them bring me here)
(let them say I’m slept
and let them bring me here)

This way I say goodbye singing, this way I say goodbye crying, happy of the heart… Viva Mexico! Viva the Mariachi from Mexico!
