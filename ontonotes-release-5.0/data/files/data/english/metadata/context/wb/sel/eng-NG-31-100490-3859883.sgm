Man, the more I read about the Z06, the better it gets!  I'm wondering
how can Cheverolet improve on it?  Like what's the next model gonna be
like?

Here's the things I can think of, I'm probably way off base, but I like
to dream:

1. Mid-engine Corvette
2. Carbon Fiber body frame
3. Sequential Manual Gearbox
4. Supercharged
5. Carbon fiber driveshaft

How can they make this car any lighter than it is?  Perhaps swapping
out aluminum parts for magnesium?

What do you think guys?  How can they impvoe on this car?

So, all you have to do is buy a C5, a Porsche, and this kit, and put a
years labor into it to get a homemade streetable car that drives like a
C5 and looks sorta like a cross between a C6, a GT40, and an NSX?

Interesting thoughts. If I may throw in an engineer's perspective:

My personal guess is the Corvette will stay with the traditional front

think the C6's engine is far enough aft to qualify as a front-mid engine
layout.

Maybe if 500 hp isn't enough... but bet they can get more than that out

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 5. Carbon fiber driveshaft

I thnk the Corvette's drive shaft is already pretty light. One of the
advantages of the aft gearbox is that the driveshaft needs to transmit
much less torque, thus is much thinner and lighter. Only payback is
higher RPM of the shaft....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Ummmm... magnesium is lighter than aluminum but not as strong for its
weight. And although it casts well and can can be machined it doesn't
form very easily in other production processes. I think in most cases a
good aluminum alloy is stronger for its weight than a magnesium alloy,
and also likely more cost-effective. Magnesium's also more vulnerable to
corrosion than aluminum.

Very much Viper-ese.

But if you look at the whole Chevrolet line-up, or all of GM's for that
matter, you see that GM Design has lost the ability to think for themselves
and are copying a lot of look from elsewhere.  Most of it isn't a good look
they are copying.

Bill Mitchell must be turning about 6500 rpm in his grave over some of this
stuff.

GM Design was usually fresh and occasionally radical.  There were often
copying of traits of others in parts, but so does everyone else.  But the
overall design never copied.

The press accused the '63 Sting Ray of copying the Jaguar XKE, but it really
was derived from the '59 Stingray.  The XKE was a natural progression from
the XK-D and D-Type.

The '68 Corvette coupe was often described as copying Ferrari's roof line
and fender line, however, the '68 Corvette was based on the '65 Mako Shark.
Ferrari probably copied that and simply executed the design faster than
Chevy.

Camaro, while it copied the basic Pony Car design, copied no one with that
front end that looked almost like one wide grill.

But today, Chevy is using Toyota Corollas and their trucks look like
abortions from mixed Japanese truck unions.

The Impala, once a fresh look that lead the way, with over 800,000 Impalas
alone produced each year in the '60s (not counting the same bodyline in Bel
Air, Biscayne, and so on), is relegated to a Toyota Camry clone.

And I wonder why I can't find a car I want to buy new.  And GM wonders why
they have to tighten their belt on their expenses because they are having
trouble selling cars.

I wouldn't look for the situation to change.  For the last 15 years, GM
styling has been "focus grouped" to death.  Good example of this was the
Olds Aurora.  Solid, well-integrated design--attractive car with a
marvelous amount of utility as it came out of the styling salon and hit
the exhibition turntable.  The underlying platform was well matched to
the design (but not "universal" enough to support two or three other
"badge" cars.)  The executive board then crammed that design through
focus groups to "guarantee" its financial future and broaden its
"badgeability."  Result, a vanilla offering where head clearance and
sill height ruined the excellent lines from the salon.

When the executive committee looks at fresh designs, they tend to recall
financial disasters like the Chrysler Airflow, the Tucker, the Kaiser
Darin, the Studebaker, and the Edsel (I don't vouch for its jukebox
freshness but did persuade my Dad to take me crosstown to an Edsel
dealer for opening night.)  Result, we get things like the Packard
Patrician, Olds Aurora, the Buicks, Mercury etc.  With the current
financial situation at GM, the paranoia and paralysis will probably
continue.  Possibly right into bankruptcy.

One thing that Corvette has going for it in this "extrusion" process is
that GM has a goal of taking the car global.  Its focus groups will
therefore include some Euro, Latin, Asian and Islandia thinking.  Taken
in context by good designers who can still keep the design integrated
rather than a "horse designed by a committee" it might survive and
prosper in the marketplace.

Sorry to say this but if it doesn't prosper it's gone.

Good driving over the holidays--please stay safe and be back here in
January.  I'll cover 2000 miles in the next week--much of it in
"Stabilitrac" country with the 'vettes home in the garage.

C'ya and I'll be wavin' in January.

Youre right ! I actually hated the new corvette design, especially the
open headlights. (trying too hard to be ferrari ?) The flip headlamps
have been to me a defining element of the corvette since the stingrays.
Hard to see one without the flip lamps.

But I recently drove the C6 and it does perform like a corvette. Got me
from 0-60 in about 5 seconds. (yes, my driving is terrible!) So it
redeems itself in performance. The  look still screams japanese
wannabe. (don't know why) but thats ok.. i guess

A fair point!

Yeah. But part of this is engineering - both cars are designed for the
same purpose in solving the same challenges (low drag and minimum
surface area in a front-engine sports car) and with a given state of the
art there's usually one optimum solution to a problem. If two
organizations use similar processes optimizing their work they'll likely
converge to similar designs. The closer you move towards the state of
the art's optimum solution the less latitude there is. Thus they have
similar layouts, a similar shape, similarly placed openings, etc.

By the same principle American and Japanese fighter designs began to
converge at the end of WW II, the Space Shuttle looks a lot like Buran
(the Soviet shuttleski), and Concorde looks a lot like the TU-144.

While I'm inclined to agree with "Tom in Missouri" that the front end
of the C6 Vette has some styling cues similar to the Viper, you have
remember who had what first. Vette had the front end and hood treatment
before Viper, but Viper had the headlights first. The sides of both
have some similarities, the most prominent being the cooling ducts at
the rear of the front fenders. Having said that, I think the Vette's
ducts look better. The rear end is quite distinct between the two and I
personally like the Vette better. In fact, the Vette kicks serious
Viper ass!

Now, getting on to lab~rat's comments,  lab~rat must be too young to
know where Chrysler got the retro design for the PT Cruiser. Check out
these three links and you'll see that the PT Cruiser had its origins in
the Chevy Sedan Delivery, which I believe was made in this design from
1947 to 1952. Here are three links for you youngsters:

http://www.hotrodscustomstuff.com/holdrite.html

http://www.calcruisingauctions.com/auction/XcAPViewItem.asp?ID=5899

http://www.classictrucksweb.com/features/0405cl_urban/index.html

So I'd suggest to you that GM's HHR is not a ripoff of the PT Cruiser,
but a reclamation of a style GM created in the 40's!!! Now as far as
the Mustang and Ranchero are concerned, I have no idea what lab~rat is
referring to. The Mustang was certainly the first so-called pony-car,
but my recollection is that Ford (John De Lorean) created it because
Ford had no competitor for the Corvette and Ford wanted a low-cost
alternative for sportscar lovers.
My recollection of the Ranchero is that it was created in 1957 and ran
until the late 70's ('79?). Assuming that lab~rat is comparing the
Ranchero to the El Camino, I believe the El Camino ran from1959 until
1987. The El Camino may have been (and probably was) created to compete
against the Ranchero, but the cars looked nothing alike in 1959. IMHO
the Ranchero was a much nicer looking vehicle in '59. So there you have
it, polite, sincere and accurate recollections from someone who was
there.

Let's change De Lorean (a GM guy through and through) to Lee Iacocca
(father of the Mustang in the mid-60s -- before he went on to fame at
Chrysler.)  The Mustang grew into a pony-car but started out as a
compact small personal car, with rather chintzy interior trim.  At that
time Chevrolet was dressing up their rear engined Corvair, transforming
it from an economy sedan into a sporty turbocharged coupe and
convertible.  The Mustang commitment started as an anemic 6.  A four was
considered.  The 289 arrived on the scene and the rest is history.

Classically, in the Ford product line, the Thunderbird was positioned
against the Corvette as an upscale personal automobile.  Two distinctly
different cars but they each had their own devotees.

I think the Ranchero - El Camino comparison is valid.  Trivia:  The El
Camino served as a flower car for many upscale funeral directors in the 60s.

PJ, that's the problem with old age - I get some of the names right,
some of the time! &lt;lol&gt; You are indeed correct - it was Lee Iacocca who
pushed development of the Mustang.  Launched at the 1964 World's Fair
in New York, the Mustang immediately became known as Ford's new "pony
car". Here's an informative link:

http://home.comcast.net/~gt69registry/history.html

As you pointed out PJ, the base Mustang engine was a 170 cubic inch
inline 6 cylinder and the optional V8 was the 260 cubic incher that
went on to become the 289 cubic inch engine in May of 1964.

While you are right that "the Thunderbird was positioned against the
Corvette", the T-Bird was only considered to be a sports car in its
1955-1957 2 seater years. In 1958 it became a personal luxury 4 seater,
although it certainly competed against Corvette and took away a lot of
business from them.

John De Lorean was of course most well known for developing the Pontiac
GTO option in the redesigned Tempest for 1964. Some would argue that
the GTO was the first factory muscle car.

I'm happy to say that they were before my time too, but I remember
seeing one or two hotrodded. We used to call them "Bun Wagons" because
of their popularity with local grocers.

I can't disagree with you there lab~rat. Chrysler took an old GM design
as the pattern for their retro vehicle and probably sold more PT
Cruisers than GM sold the original Sedan Delivery.  Now that the PT
Cruiser has dominated this market segment, the light belatedly came on
at GM. Sad really.

1. They already make a convertible.
and
2. Aluminum doesn't like being flexed so they aren't going to cut the
top off the Z06.

Yeah, I don't know what I was somking.  Perhaps if the manufacturing

When do you think SMG will happen?  I heard the infinitely variable

I read somewhere, they bore the cylinders so large that the walls
between the cylinders are very thin.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; 5. Carbon fiber driveshaft
&gt; I thnk the Corvette's drive shaft is already pretty light. One of the

&gt; higher RPM of the shaft....

Wow, that's cool.  I didn't read about the gearbox being in the back.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Ummmm... magnesium is lighter than aluminum but not as strong for its
&gt; weight. And although it casts well and can can be machined it doesn't
&gt; form very easily in other production processes. I think in most cases a
&gt; good aluminum alloy is stronger for its weight than a magnesium alloy,
&gt; and also likely more cost-effective. Magnesium's also more vulnerable to
&gt; corrosion than aluminum.
">

There's probably an alloy waiting to be found with magnesium to make it
a viable, lighter alternative?  Here's what I found on the web:

Specific Weight:
Auminum: 2.55-2.80
Magnesium: 1.73

Young's Modulus:
Aluminum 69
Magnesium 45

So taking 2.55 for aluminum, and 1.73 for Mg, Magnesium is about 67%
lighter, yet 65% weaker.  So, you'd save yourself maybe 2% in weight
savings when you thicken the magnesium beams to match aluminum
strength?  Perhaps that's not right since volume, hence weight goes up
by a cube, and strength goes up the the square (cross sectional area.)

There has to be some alloy out there.

As far as rust goes, the new Pagoni Zonda F uses magnesium rims instead
of aluminum rims for weight savings.  Maybe owners of a Zonda don't
care about rust and having to replace their rims every 6 months?  I
doubt it.  There has to be room for some kind of magnesium application
in a vette.  Right?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yeah, for the cost, it's awesome.  Maybe they can work on the interior
some.  Perhaps they will make a environmentally friendlier Vette by
introducing displacement on demand, a 'new' engine technology GM is
developing.  Which would be cool: imagine a vette that also does 32mpg
highway cruising.

I'm told the current LS-2 engine casting is fitted for DOD, it's just
not in use. And my C6 gives 28.3 mpg at 75 mph cruise, 30.5 at 70, and
33+ at 65. For comparison my old '67 VW Bug gives 33-35 at 60 and 28 at
70. I think the Corvette's fuel figures are fabulous for a
high-performance car, especially one that performs without having to be
driven like you're mad at it.

Really?  I've read it does 26mpg, I think on edmonds.  If it does
better than that, that's pretty cool.  My 2004 BMW 6 is quoted at doing
26mpg too, but in reality it does much less, like 19mpg, no matter how
much I try to feather the gas.  It's 4.5L displacement is less than a
Vette, but the Vette gets better mileage!  Wow.  (That and the fact
that my BMW is a slug compared to the Vette.)

I think the C6R weighs in at 2,425 with the '05 Z06 steel frame and
