&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working...like I told him before McDonald's is always hiring...his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; child still has to eat and live whether he has a job or not!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My father raised 3 kids on one blue collar salary with no handout
from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyone, so what's your problem?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Your dad should be commended! But my circumstances are not yours or
&gt; &gt; &gt; your dads.FYI, I am not looking for a handout, for ten years I left
&gt; &gt; &gt; him alone, figured he would do the right thing. When he could, (which
&gt; &gt; &gt; he can), I figured he would help support his child, we created
&gt; &gt; &gt; together. &quot;His child,we created together&quot; key phrase!

&gt; &gt; Key phrase, but FALSE phrase. It was YOU, and you ALONE (by your SOLE
&gt; &gt; choice) who created your child. Your phrase is like saying because I
handed
&gt; &gt; you a packet of yeast, &quot;we&quot; created a loaf of bread..........

&gt; &gt; &gt; He never did,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and willfully unemployed himself as well as fled from state to state
&gt; &gt; &gt; to avoid his obligations and responsibilities to his child. My current
&gt; &gt; &gt; husband worked two jobs, killing himself, and I are ready for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; violin...with removal of my thyroid other glands failed to their
joworked
&gt; &gt; full time too
&gt; &gt; &gt; so that we could eat, live, and my child could be well educated today,
&gt; &gt; &gt; not ten, fifteen, twenty years ago (the cost of living is much
&gt; &gt; &gt; different now). And we did what we had to do, because life wasn't fair
&gt; &gt; &gt; my child should not have to suffer, and we did whatever we had to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; to make sure he has what TWO parents should give him. I was diagnosed
&gt; &gt; &gt; with thyroid cancer, so with that I had to undergo a radical
&gt; &gt; &gt; thyroidectomy, and radiation. Let me know when your b,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and so on...so  I am on meds the rest of my life, and hope to find out
&gt; &gt; &gt; if I am cancer free soon. With my health issues my husband had to
&gt; &gt; &gt; leave his second job, to help run the household and take care of me,
&gt; &gt; &gt; therefore financially we hurt because HE takes care of all his
&gt; &gt; &gt; children including two others from a previous marriage. So legally my
&gt; &gt; &gt; husband is obligated to care for them first before we even eat! Health
&gt; &gt; &gt; wise I shouldn't be working the hours I do, but I know my obligations
&gt; &gt; &gt; and responsibilities, and even continue my education where I graduate
&gt; &gt; &gt; in May with my bachelors in Criminal Justice,YEAH!!! and if my health
&gt; &gt; &gt; allows hopefully to law school in September of 08. Anyway, #1. My
&gt; &gt; &gt; husband is not my son's father and he is not legally obligated to care
&gt; &gt; &gt; for him. #2. Why is the bilogical father any less responsible than I
&gt; &gt; &gt; am?

&gt; &gt; Because it was YOU, not him who made the sole choice to bear your child.
It
&gt; &gt; is ILLEGAL for him to make such choice. (see above)

&gt; &gt; &gt; #3. Why am I looking for a handout when everyone is doing their
&gt; &gt; &gt; job, but the absent bilogical father? #4. How is my son going to feel
&gt; &gt; &gt; when I tell him, I knew where your father was I just didn't care
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough to fight for you, because I don't want to bother with it?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Because we dont' need? We might not need it today...but my child
&gt; &gt; &gt; might, when he needs a new pair of size 15 shoes, and I cannot buy
&gt; &gt; &gt; them because I have to buy my medicine or pay for my doctor's visit.
&gt; &gt; &gt; My child might need the money when he needs new school supplies and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have to be in the hospital. My child might need it when he is hungry
&gt; &gt; &gt; at school and I need gas in my car. I am sorry your dad had to do it
&gt; &gt; &gt; by himself, or chose to, but why do I have a problem if I am willing
&gt; &gt; &gt; to get up and fight for what is legally obligated to my son?!? He
&gt; &gt; &gt; deserves that, at the very least...We all have choices about our
&gt; &gt; &gt; lives, I choose to not be a martyr and make sure the biological father
&gt; &gt; &gt; is held responsible for his actions or inactions.

&gt; &gt; Responsible for &quot;inactions&quot;. Don't you just LOVE it! What the heck is
THAT
&gt; &gt; supposed to mean?

Because of your SOLE choice. No dissapointment at all. It is illegal for him
to force you into parenthood. So, unless he or someone else committed such
crime, the only option left is that you became a parent SOLELY by your own
choice.

&gt; Responsible for &quot;inactions&quot;. Don't you just LOVE it! What the heck is

&gt; It means that after searching high and low for the NCP for 10 years,
&gt; and finding him in prison for domestic violence, (&quot;my duty as the CP,&quot;
&gt; right?) that he was told once again where his child lives,( in the
&gt; same place for 14 years) and his child's phone number (the same for 14
&gt; years) that he needed to be a part of his child's life...because the
&gt; child at least deserved that. He decided to do nothing, not call him,
&gt; write him, wish him happy birthday...nothing! So inaction means
&gt; absence of action, and that is how I have applied it here.

&quot;Responsibility&quot; is tied to action by every facet of the definition. It is
impossible to be responsible for that which does not exist (inaction).

Idiot-she said she left it alone for 10 years-not that she has been
trying to collct for 10 years. Point is, nobody forced him to spill
his seed to make a child, and there is a court order for support, he
needs to pay it.  She didn't ask simple minded people to come down on
her, she asked for advice on how to collect her child support. You do
seem to have a lot of things deadbeat, non-custodial parents like to
hear, so go to one of thier blogs and sgree with them. I'm sure you'll

Newsflash: Only men have the live organisim that creates the child.
The woman carries the egg, which is not alive, and it will be purged
from the body if not fertilized by sperm. So, in fact, men DO make
children, because they produce the sperm that causes the splitting of
the single cell to create the embryo that later becomes a fetus, then
a human being.

Who the hell are you to take ownership of an internet newsgroup?!?

Last I checked this was a group dedicated to the discussion
of child support issues, thus the name.  You are the one
who just came off looking totally ignorant by attempting to
stifle disucussion of a point of view just because it doesn't

hiring...his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; child still has to eat and live whether he has a job or not!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My father raised 3 kids on one blue collar salary with no
handout
&gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyone, so what's your problem?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your dad should be commended! But my circumstances are not yours
or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your dads.FYI, I am not looking for a handout, for ten years I
left
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him alone, figured he would do the right thing. When he could,
(which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he can), I figured he would help support his child, we created
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together. &quot;His child,we created together&quot; key phrase!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Key phrase, but FALSE phrase. It was YOU, and you ALONE (by your
SOLE
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; choice) who created your child. Your phrase is like saying because I
&gt; &gt; handed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you a packet of yeast, &quot;we&quot; created a loaf of bread..........

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He never did,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and willfully unemployed himself as well as fled from state to
state
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to avoid his obligations and responsibilities to his child. My
current
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; husband worked two jobs, killing himself, and I are ready for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violin...with removal of my thyroid other glands failed to their
&gt; &gt; joworked
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; full time too
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so that we could eat, live, and my child could be well educated
today,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not ten, fifteen, twenty years ago (the cost of living is much
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different now). And we did what we had to do, because life wasn't
fair
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my child should not have to suffer, and we did whatever we had to
do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to make sure he has what TWO parents should give him. I was
diagnosed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with thyroid cancer, so with that I had to undergo a radical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thyroidectomy, and radiation. Let me know when your b,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and so on...so  I am on meds the rest of my life, and hope to find
out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if I am cancer free soon. With my health issues my husband had to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leave his second job, to help run the household and take care of
me,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; therefore financially we hurt because HE takes care of all his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; children including two others from a previous marriage. So legally
my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; husband is obligated to care for them first before we even eat!
Health
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wise I shouldn't be working the hours I do, but I know my
obligations
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and responsibilities, and even continue my education where I
graduate
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in May with my bachelors in Criminal Justice,YEAH!!! and if my
health
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allows hopefully to law school in September of 08. Anyway, #1. My
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; husband is not my son's father and he is not legally obligated to
care
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for him. #2. Why is the bilogical father any less responsible than
I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; am?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because it was YOU, not him who made the sole choice to bear your
child.
&gt; &gt; It
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is ILLEGAL for him to make such choice. (see above)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #3. Why am I looking for a handout when everyone is doing their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; job, but the absent bilogical father? #4. How is my son going to
feel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when I tell him, I knew where your father was I just didn't care
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough to fight for you, because I don't want to bother with it?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because we dont' need? We might not need it today...but my child
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might, when he needs a new pair of size 15 shoes, and I cannot buy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them because I have to buy my medicine or pay for my doctor's
visit.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My child might need the money when he needs new school supplies
and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to be in the hospital. My child might need it when he is
hungry
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at school and I need gas in my car. I am sorry your dad had to do
it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by himself, or chose to, but why do I have a problem if I am
willing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get up and fight for what is legally obligated to my son?!? He
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deserves that, at the very least...We all have choices about our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lives, I choose to not be a martyr and make sure the biological
father
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is held responsible for his actions or inactions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Responsible for &quot;inactions&quot;. Don't you just LOVE it! What the heck

&gt; &gt; &gt; that matter now..the child is here,living and breathing?

&gt; &gt; Because of your SOLE choice. No dissapointment at all. It is illegal for
him
&gt; &gt; to force you into parenthood. So, unless he or someone else committed
such
&gt; &gt; crime, the only option left is that you became a parent SOLELY by your
own
&gt; &gt; choice.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Responsible for &quot;inactions&quot;. Don't you just LOVE it! What the heck is
&gt; &gt; &gt; THAT
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supposed to mean?

&gt; &gt; &gt; It means that after searching high and low for the NCP for 10 years,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and finding him in prison for domestic violence, (&quot;my duty as the CP,&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; right?) that he was told once again where his child lives,( in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; same place for 14 years) and his child's phone number (the same for 14
&gt; &gt; &gt; years) that he needed to be a part of his child's life...because the
&gt; &gt; &gt; child at least deserved that. He decided to do nothing, not call him,
&gt; &gt; &gt; write him, wish him happy birthday...nothing! So inaction means
&gt; &gt; &gt; absence of action, and that is how I have applied it here.

&gt; &gt; &quot;Responsibility&quot; is tied to action by every facet of the definition. It
is
&gt; &gt; impossible to be responsible for that which does not exist (inaction).

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you
&gt; &gt; &gt; are much more angry than I am.

&gt; &gt; When it comes to people getting ripped off, I'm sure I am.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't understand your defense of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; scumbag

&gt; &gt; That's because you lack a fundamental understanding of the concept of
&gt; &gt; responsibilities being inherently bundled with RIGHTS.

&gt; &gt; &gt; except that I have what I have needed to do, and will keep
&gt; &gt; &gt; doing it. He needs to let his step-father adopt him and let him have
&gt; &gt; &gt; the real father he deserves.- Hide quoted text -

That's right comrade, take away all adult choices that any citizen has!

Lets get back to the good old days of baking the Jews in the oven because we
don't like the way they operate or owning blacks and other less than human
persons because we feel they are not our equals.

It was all legal and enforced by courts of law, makes it all right, correct?

Ok, and I was called the rightous bitch? Your &quot;ass&quot; umptions need to
be clarifed. I am not whimpering over a man &quot;I&quot; left 12 1/2 years ago
for abuse. I am happily married and have been for 12 years, as my
husband and I support our children as well as my efforts to hold the
deadbeat accountable. I have a great job as does he. I submitted my
original post as a request from anyone who had insight as to holding
the NCP accountable, and his aiding and abetting ex-wife. I never once
stated my child was unfed, or not taken care of. Again, sitting at
home on my laurels, collecting from the state would put everyone's
judgements in a better postion to persecute my actions. Lets know the
whole story, before assuming what we &quot;think&quot; we know.

And yet, Paula, when several people politely suggested that pursuing a man
who obivously had not intention of paying as viforously as the OP is might
be just a frustrating waste of precious time that can never be regained,
laneasparge said:  &quot;You do
seem to have a lot of things deadbeat, non-custodial parents like to

here who have different opinions than she does about child support should
not e posting here.  If we are to have a discussion, should not all
viewpoints be open for discussion?  Which means that there will be
differences of opinion--right?

How do you feel about women who have kids by multiple men and cannot afford
to care for any of them because she stays home to &quot;care&quot; for the children?
Should she, also, be fixed like a stray dog?  Or does she have the right to
expexct each man to pay full cost for his child, because she does not work?

The baby whelpers who birth for dollars and have no concept of how to use
birth control should be sterilized after the second out-of-wedlock child is
born.  The problem is government welfare and CS policies encourage more and
more pregnancies to reward women for failing to manage their own sexuality
and provide no incentives to reduce child births to overcome low self-esteem

I find it interesting to observe the OP claims she freely slept with the
child's father, got pregnant, and then decided to have &quot;his&quot; baby.  Yet she
didn't want to marry him because he is a loser.  Women like that are totally
whacked and have their priorities all messed up.  They want the money for
screwing some guy they hardly knew and once they get pregnant they want to
characterize the father as a bad boy without taking any responsibility for
their own lack of judgment about who they had sex with.  What kind of
message is she, and others like her, sending to the children they pop out?

In short, your argument is that women are whores and men must pay for sex.

This has really irked me lately (as you can probably tell :). They come in
here whining and wailing about
what a horrible abusing deadbeat they're going after for the &quot;benefit of the
children&quot; and expect nothing but
pity for their plight as if none of it is their fault when they themselves
are the most at blame for procreating
with said horrible abusing deadbeat. Victims? Hardly. One would think they'd
be at least somewhat ashamed
for chosing such a father for their children. I know if I'd chosen such a
loser to parent my children, I certainly
wouldn't blast it all over the internet (and I would owe those kids a huge
apology).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My father raised 3 kids on one blue collar salary with no
&gt; handout
&gt; &gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyone, so what's your problem?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your dad should be commended! But my circumstances are not yours
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your dads.FYI, I am not looking for a handout, for ten years I
&gt; left
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him alone, figured he would do the right thing. When he could,
&gt; (which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he can), I figured he would help support his child, we created
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together. &quot;His child,we created together&quot; key phrase!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Key phrase, but FALSE phrase. It was YOU, and you ALONE (by your
&gt; SOLE
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; choice) who created your child. Your phrase is like saying because I
&gt; &gt; &gt; handed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you a packet of yeast, &quot;we&quot; created a loaf of bread..........

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He never did,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and willfully unemployed himself as well as fled from state to
&gt; state
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to avoid his obligations and responsibilities to his child. My
&gt; current
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; husband worked two jobs, killing himself, and I are ready for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violin...with removal of my thyroid other glands failed to their
&gt; &gt; &gt; joworked
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; full time too
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so that we could eat, live, and my child could be well educated
&gt; today,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not ten, fifteen, twenty years ago (the cost of living is much
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different now). And we did what we had to do, because life wasn't
&gt; fair
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my child should not have to suffer, and we did whatever we had to
&gt; do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to make sure he has what TWO parents should give him. I was
&gt; diagnosed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with thyroid cancer, so with that I had to undergo a radical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thyroidectomy, and radiation. Let me know when your b,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and so on...so  I am on meds the rest of my life, and hope to find
&gt; out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if I am cancer free soon. With my health issues my husband had to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leave his second job, to help run the household and take care of
&gt; me,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; therefore financially we hurt because HE takes care of all his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; children including two others from a previous marriage. So legally
&gt; my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; husband is obligated to care for them first before we even eat!
&gt; Health
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wise I shouldn't be working the hours I do, but I know my
&gt; obligations
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and responsibilities, and even continue my education where I
&gt; graduate
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in May with my bachelors in Criminal Justice,YEAH!!! and if my
&gt; health
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allows hopefully to law school in September of 08. Anyway, #1. My
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; husband is not my son's father and he is not legally obligated to
&gt; care
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for him. #2. Why is the bilogical father any less responsible than
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; am?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because it was YOU, not him who made the sole choice to bear your
&gt; child.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is ILLEGAL for him to make such choice. (see above)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #3. Why am I looking for a handout when everyone is doing their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; job, but the absent bilogical father? #4. How is my son going to
&gt; feel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when I tell him, I knew where your father was I just didn't care
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough to fight for you, because I don't want to bother with it?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because we dont' need? We might not need it today...but my child
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might, when he needs a new pair of size 15 shoes, and I cannot buy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them because I have to buy my medicine or pay for my doctor's
&gt; visit.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My child might need the money when he needs new school supplies

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to be in the hospital. My child might need it when he is

&gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by himself, or chose to, but why do I have a problem if I am
&gt; willing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get up and fight for what is legally obligated to my son?!? He
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deserves that, at the very least...We all have choices about our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lives, I choose to not be a martyr and make sure the biological
&gt; father
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is held responsible for his actions or inactions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Responsible for &quot;inactions&quot;. Don't you just LOVE it! What the heck
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; THAT

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Key phrase, but FALSE phrase. It was YOU, and you ALONE (by your SOLE
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; choice) who created your child. Your phrase is like saying because I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you a packet of yeast, &quot;we&quot; created a loaf of bread..........

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry to disappoint you on this one...I did not supply the sperm, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inject it. So &quot;we created this child.&quot; He and I chose to create this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; child, and I chose to nurture and bear him. Ok, and why does any of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that matter now..the child is here,living and breathing?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Because of your SOLE choice. No dissapointment at all. It is illegal for
&gt; him
&gt; &gt; &gt; to force you into parenthood. So, unless he or someone else committed
&gt; such
&gt; &gt; &gt; crime, the only option left is that you became a parent SOLELY by your
&gt; own
&gt; &gt; &gt; choice.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Responsible for &quot;inactions&quot;. Don't you just LOVE it! What the heck is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; THAT
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supposed to mean?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It means that after searching high and low for the NCP for 10 years,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and finding him in prison for domestic violence, (&quot;my duty as the CP,&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right?) that he was told once again where his child lives,( in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same place for 14 years) and his child's phone number (the same for 14
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years) that he needed to be a part of his child's life...because the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; child at least deserved that. He decided to do nothing, not call him,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; write him, wish him happy birthday...nothing! So inaction means
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; absence of action, and that is how I have applied it here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Responsibility&quot; is tied to action by every facet of the definition. It
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; impossible to be responsible for that which does not exist (inaction).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are much more angry than I am.

&gt; &gt; &gt; When it comes to people getting ripped off, I'm sure I am.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't understand your defense of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scumbag

&gt; &gt; &gt; That's because you lack a fundamental understanding of the concept of
&gt; &gt; &gt; responsibilities being inherently bundled with RIGHTS.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that I have what I have needed to do, and will keep
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing it. He needs to let his step-father adopt him and let him have

&gt; New word or favorite word?

&gt; &gt; she said she left it alone for 10 years-not that she has been
&gt; &gt; trying to collct for 10 years. Point is, nobody forced him to spill
&gt; &gt; his seed to make a child,

&gt; So, if I understand you correctly, such child exists at the moment of
&gt; conception.....  correct?

&gt; &gt; and there is a court order for support, he
&gt; &gt; needs to pay it.

&gt; &quot;Need&quot; is a matter of opinon.

&gt; &gt; She didn't ask simple minded people to come down on
&gt; &gt; her, she asked for advice on how to collect her child support. You do
&gt; &gt; seem to have a lot of things deadbeat, non-custodial parents like to

Go back and read it again, genius, and I won't tell you how stupid
your first question is. The fetus is not considered a child or human
being until it reaches 20 weeks in the womb. That state legislator's
drafted those laws in their states, and what their expectancy is
regarding this matter of a human life. No state wants its laws to set
its occupants back in the 1950's, but at the same time, some states
want to maintain a dignity in the values we should be holding in our
own homes. For example, In New York a fetus is not considered a human
being until it is completely expelled from the womb and/or takes a
breath.
In this case, in her state, D.N.A, and a court order states it is that
man's responsibility to financially support his child. It doesn't
matter what you think, or what I think.
In this particular case, a judge has decided he has a financial
obligation, and how much it is. If the non-custodial parent would do
the right thing then a judge would never had the need to be involved.

You talk about it being the sole choice of the mother, and the father
has no rights, but that is untrue. The man has a right to put on a
condom, or he can get a vasectomy, hell; he can just say no to
unprotected sex. Since you're so fond of a woman killing life within
her womb, then surely, you are open to a man who has the sole choice
to have a vasectomy. Let him have a doctor do a little snip, snip.
Since you want to ask stupid questions that a 5 year old would no the
answer to:
Yes, &quot;said&quot; child would exist at the time of conception, because for
conception to be, the single cell must split, thus, life. In the eyes
of God, yes it does exist. In the eyes of the courts,

It takes more than yeast to make a loaf of bread, but if you're going
to make it, you might as well eat it. If you make a child, you might
as well take care of it. If you didn't want bread with your meal,
perhaps you should not have given the yeast to the baker. What did you
think was going to happen when you gave the yeast to the baker? What
did the deadbeat think was going to happen when he spilled seed in

&gt; The baby whelpers who birth for dollars and have no concept of how to use
&gt; birth control should be sterilized after the second out-of-wedlock child is
&gt; born.  The problem is government welfare and CS policies encourage more and

Tell that to ALL of the deadbeat male parents. Why can't they get
clipped? Have you ever seen the side effects that birth control can
cause, including ovarian cancer, and breast cancer? I had a friend
pass from breast cancer, caused by seasonal birth control. She was 28
years old, and a mother of 2. Now the non-custodial parnt has the two
boys, still doesn't work (Adel worked her fingers to the bone, crawled
up the steps at night after working an 18 hour day to provide for her
kids), and that deadbeat collects social security, and welfare. The SS
money belongs to the kids, and they don't see it. I feed them every
evening, along with my own son, whom I support (because deadbeat Dave
has decided to make 4 more kids with 4 other women in the past 4
years). If the deadbeats were held responsible, snipped for being un-
responsible, women wouldn't need birth control, Bob.

&gt; In short, your argument is that women are whores and men must pay for sex.

&gt; Do you ever notice how immoral and corrupt your anti-choice position is?

&gt; Tell that to ALL of the deadbeat male parents. Why can't they get

&gt; cause, including ovarian cancer, and breast cancer? I had a friend
&gt; pass from breast cancer, caused by seasonal birth control. She was 28

&gt; boys, still doesn't work (Adel worked her fingers to the bone, crawled
&gt; up the steps at night after working an 18 hour day to provide for her

&gt; years). If the deadbeats were held responsible, snipped for being un-

So it is ok with you that women have multiple children by multiple men?
Because it is the man's responsibility to make sure that women can have sex
whenever they want to and not get pregnant?  Whatever happened to PERSONAL
responsibility?  Or is that just for men?

You've missed the obvious.  Parental responsibility cuts both ways and has
nothing to do with birth control.  Birth control, or lack of it, is a
pre-conception responsibility.  CS and rearing children is a post-conception
responsibility.  Equating the two is something only femwits do to advance
their male bashing agenda.

Fathers are regularly held responsible for their children by the CS system.
It is the mothers who are given a free pass for being irresponsible.
Mothers are given money for birthing out-of-wedlock children.  Mothers are
given custody of children they claim were created unilaterally by the
fathers.  Mothers are allowed to spend CS and public assistance without any
accounting of how they use the money.   Mothers are given artificial tax
benefits even though it is the father's contribution that earns them the tax
breaks, or the father's financial contribution is ignored to give them the
tax breaks.

&gt; &gt; There's a number of red flags that should alert a man to these types,
&gt; &gt; unfortunately it's too late by the time they get home from the bar.
&gt; &gt; There's a lot of young men out there that need to be educated about this

&gt; &gt; less are having families! :-)

&gt; I find it interesting to observe the OP claims she freely slept with the
&gt; child's father, got pregnant, and then decided to have &quot;his&quot; baby.  Yet she
&gt; didn't want to marry him because he is a loser.  Women like that are totally
&gt; whacked and have their priorities all messed up.  They want the money for
&gt; screwing some guy they hardly knew and once they get pregnant they want to
&gt; characterize the father as a bad boy without taking any responsibility for
&gt; their own lack of judgment about who they had sex with.  What kind of

&gt; This has really irked me lately (as you can probably tell :). They come in
&gt; here whining and wailing about
&gt; what a horrible abusing deadbeat they're going after for the &quot;benefit of the
&gt; children&quot; and expect nothing but
&gt; pity for their plight as if none of it is their fault when they themselves
&gt; are the most at blame for procreating
&gt; with said horrible abusing deadbeat. Victims? Hardly. One would think they'd
&gt; be at least somewhat ashamed
&gt; for chosing such a father for their children. I know if I'd chosen such a
&gt; loser to parent my children, I certainly
&gt; wouldn't blast it all over the internet (and I would owe those kids a huge
&gt; apology).
">

Let me call the waaambulance for you then, since all I have been doing
is crying....Very amusing. Your incessant &quot;ass&quot;umptions of who I am,
what I should be doing, and how I should feel are very close-minded.
Assumptions and sterotypes are a projection of an individual's fears
onto others, regardless of the reality of others. At which point am I
obligated to give you the entire sorted history of my life so that
your assumptions and advice make sense. Until that is done you can put
me, who I am and where I am going into your little box of nonsensical
judgments and assumptions.  Understand that my choices are my
consequences and I have chosen to accept them. My original post was
not about my past, and your clarifications about who you &quot;think&quot; I am,
but rather I was hoping for intelligibale responses to my requests.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That is an excellent idea!

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How do you feel about women who have kids by multiple men and cannot
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; afford to care for any of them because she stays home to &quot;care&quot; for the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; children? Should she, also, be fixed like a stray dog?  Or does she
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the right to expexct each man to pay full cost for his child, because
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; she
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; does not work?

&gt; &gt;&gt; The baby whelpers who birth for dollars and have no concept of how to use
&gt; &gt;&gt; birth control should be sterilized after the second out-of-wedlock child
&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt; &gt;&gt; born.  The problem is government welfare and CS policies encourage more
&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; more pregnancies to reward women for failing to manage their own
&gt; &gt;&gt; sexuality
&gt; &gt;&gt; and provide no incentives to reduce child births to overcome low
&gt; &gt;&gt; self-esteem
&gt; &gt;&gt; issues.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; Tell that to ALL of the deadbeat male parents. Why can't they get
&gt; &gt; clipped? Have you ever seen the side effects that birth control can
&gt; &gt; cause, including ovarian cancer, and breast cancer? I had a friend
&gt; &gt; pass from breast cancer, caused by seasonal birth control. She was 28
&gt; &gt; years old, and a mother of 2. Now the non-custodial parnt has the two
&gt; &gt; boys, still doesn't work (Adel worked her fingers to the bone, crawled
&gt; &gt; up the steps at night after working an 18 hour day to provide for her
&gt; &gt; kids), and that deadbeat collects social security, and welfare. The SS
&gt; &gt; money belongs to the kids, and they don't see it. I feed them every
&gt; &gt; evening, along with my own son, whom I support (because deadbeat Dave
&gt; &gt; has decided to make 4 more kids with 4 other women in the past 4
&gt; &gt; years). If the deadbeats were held responsible, snipped for being un-
&gt; &gt; responsible, women wouldn't need birth control, Bob.

&gt; You've missed the obvious.  Parental responsibility cuts both ways and has
&gt; nothing to do with birth control.  Birth control, or lack of it, is a
&gt; pre-conception responsibility.  CS and rearing children is a post-conception
&gt; responsibility.  Equating the two is something only femwits do to advance
&gt; their male bashing agenda.

&gt; Fathers are regularly held responsible for their children by the CS system.
&gt; It is the mothers who are given a free pass for being irresponsible.
&gt; Mothers are given money for birthing out-of-wedlock children.  Mothers are
&gt; given custody of children they claim were created unilaterally by the
&gt; fathers.  Mothers are allowed to spend CS and public assistance without any
&gt; accounting of how they use the money.   Mothers are given artificial tax
&gt; benefits even though it is the father's contribution that earns them the tax
&gt; breaks, or the father's financial contribution is ignored to give them the
&gt; tax breaks.- Hide quoted text -

I was being very sarcastic, if a particular &quot;Jane Doe&quot; cannot find it
in herrself to do whatever she needs to do to take of her children,
like working, creating a future for them how can we expect the fathers
to be responsible? Who sets that example? But I do not know each
individual mothers situation or dynamic so I cannot make judgments on
every mother that has children by different men and stays at home, the
same as every father who does not take care of his off-spring. I can
make some intelligable judgments on my situation and dynamic only.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *father's* rights group in nature. If you can't deal with it, take
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; your
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; babble elsewhere!
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Next time, lurk before you open your mouth in a newsgroup and come off
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; looking totally
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ignorant.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Who the hell are you to take ownership of an internet newsgroup?!?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Last I checked this was a group dedicated to the discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of child support issues, thus the name.  You are the one
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; who just came off looking totally ignorant by attempting to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stifle disucussion of a point of view just because it doesn't
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; match your own.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Apparently, you have a reading problem. See, he was the one spouting off
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; because we didn't agree
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with him and he told us to go elsewhere. Let me break it down for you. He
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; said.&quot;Idiot...
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  You do seem to have a lot of things deadbeat, non-custodial parents like
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hear, so go
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   to one of thier blogs and sgree with them. I'm sure you'll
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   make many friends there.&quot; Now, don't you feel foolish as well?  Perhaps
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  should  just do a little research of usenet conventions and come back
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; when
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you're all grown up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Why should my comments, that everyone has a right to
&gt; &gt; &gt; their opinion and to post it here, make me feel foolish?

&gt; &gt; ==
&gt; &gt; Umm, you were defending the one who did so. Look up there ^
&gt; &gt; ==

&gt; &gt; &gt; What usenet convention is it that you think I don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; understand, Gini?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Resorting to name calling ... just who here is it who is
&gt; &gt; &gt; bahving in an immature manner?  Not I said the fly.

&gt; &gt; ==
&gt; &gt; Umm, you were defending the one who did so. Look up there^
&gt; &gt; Don't get out much, do you? :-)

&gt; You're slippin', Gini ... 'cause that doesn't even make sense.- Hide quoted text -
