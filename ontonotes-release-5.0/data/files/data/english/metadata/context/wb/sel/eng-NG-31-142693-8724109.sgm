I've heard it many times, &quot;The War in Iraq is both unconstitutional
and Illegal.&quot; ...

indeed Illegal :

Invasion right but 'illegal', says US hawk

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the Wikipedia &quot;War Powers Clause&quot;:
">

&quot;In 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution, which
requires the president to obtain either a declaration of war or a
resolution authorizing the use of force from Congress within 60 days
of initiating hostilities. Its constitutionality has never settled.&quot;
and
&quot;Since World War II, Congress has formally authorized all the
major military engagements that the US has undertaken. (Vietnam,
Lebanon, Panama, Persian Gulf War, Afghanistan, and Iraq.)&quot;

In the last article from above (Invasion right but 'illegal', says US
hawk), it says &quot;The White House has maintained that the invasion was
justified under the UN charter, which guarantees the right of each
state to self-defence, including pre-emptive self-defence.&quot;

To suggest that we had to invade Iraq in self-defense is is complete
nonesense.  Iraq posed NO threat to us.  We bombed Iraq with impunity
all through the 1990's.  Iraq has no industrial complex - they
couldn't even manufacture an alluminum tube.  Any and all weapons they
had, they had to purchase (and much of it was purchased from US.)
Even if they DID have something objectionable, they had NO WAY to
deliver it - ergo, they did not pose any threat to us.  It becomes
painfully obvious when you look at the history of the planned Iraq
invasion, which started YEARS before the 9/11 window of opportunity -
there was simply no way to justify (in any believable way; it's still
not justified) the invasion before that.

My understanding: The idea of going into Iraq started in the late
90's, before Bush was even in office.  Bush campaigned in 2000 on a
non-interventionist foreigh policy, saying &quot;no nation building&quot;.  The
media displayed white house documents that showed Bush, IMMEDIATELY on
getting into office (Day 1!), moved towards the plan of invading Iraq
and, ultimately, nation building.  His attitude was &quot;find me a way to
do it.&quot;  They also showed maps of the oil fields, and how those were
going to be &quot;managed&quot;.  It wasn't until 9/11 that Bush had the
opportunity to sell the idea to the American people (and Congress) and
move forward with their long-developed plans.

Now Iran is next on the list

The funding for the war is coming from borrowed money to the tune of
10 billion dollars a month [ How US is deferring war costs :
http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0116/p01s01-usfp.html ] because &quot;The
political side assumes it's suicidal to raise taxes to pay for a war
that a majority in opinion polls say was a mistake.&quot;  [

]
&quot;In Europe we often see Americans' fear of the state and aversion
to taxation with some perplexity. However in a state such as the US,
which only provides for the most basic levels of public service, the
majority of the government's activities are necessarily occupied by
defence. Americans know this and for them, like the British liberals
of the eighteenth century, low taxation is seen as a means of keeping
a violent state in check, making sure that if wars have to be fought
then approval has to be sought from the purse of the public. However
now it seems as though the large capacities of governments to run such
deficits has long since made this check on government power obsolete.
Now the power to dictate policy to the government lies not in its
constituency but in the hands of its financierfor the US Government
trying to pay for a war in Iraq, its financiers are in Beijing.&quot;

It was Benjamin Franklin who one said &quot;It would be thought a hard
Government that should tax its People one tenth Part of their Time, to
be employed in its Service.&quot;  Where are we now?  Add up ALL your taxes
and compare it to the 10% that Franklin would attribute to a &quot;hard
Government&quot;.  Government has become too large.  The people have come
to realize that they can spend money from the public purse via voting
for the candidates that offers them the most benefits or entitlements.

Our federal government has certainly showed that they can get away
with murder, ignore international law, and ignore the will of the
people.  It is corrupt.  Why are all Iraqi farmers now required to
destroy all their crop seeds and required to PURCHASE all their new
seeds from US distributors like Monsanto.  What the hell does that
have to do with anything we're doing in Iraq?  Well, President Bush
has links to Monsanto.. so it's OK to force a monopoly on the iraqi
food supply.  Not just that, it's all GM (genetically modified), which
has not been properly researched, but that's a whole other story.

So what are the American people going to do about it?  Ultimately,
nothing.  I think most are too apathetic to become organized, let
alone object in any significant way.  Too many ignore politics,
thinking it will just work itself out on it's own.  Not their
problem.  I've got a game to watch on TV ...

Don't expect the media to alert us or report the truth.  They're
already owned, and do not have our interests in mind.

REVOLUTION?  I think not.  I seriously think it's too much work for
the average citizen.  Most don't beleive there is anything to revolt
against.  And unless it directly and severely hits them in the wallet,
they don't want to be bothered.  Too many are all too willing to lose
liberties for perceived safety, and will end up losing both.

How about the recent Fall GOP debates.  Sean Hannity dismissed, live
as it was happening, the landslide victory for Ron Paul in the text-
messaging voting.  Where's are the results to be found?  You won't
find it on the FoxNews.com website.  You'll find the last one, from
earlier in the year, but not the Ron Paul victory.

Their &quot;latest&quot; poll is from Aug 24, with &quot;New Yorkers Clinton,

How interesting...  and painfully obvious...
