I just made these donuts. Boy are they ever good. I used one can and
it made 8 donuts and 8 holes. I just did the sugar/cinnamon. These
are just delicious and the best donuts I've had it ages. I suppose
it's because they are fresh and warm. Very easy to do except for the
little bit of mess the fat creates. You have to keep turning them so
they don't soak up the oil and get heavy and make sure your fat is up
to temp.

Canned Biscuit Dough Donuts And Holes

Serves 16
Recipe By: Paula Deen

Peanut oil -- for frying
1 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 cups ugar

Icings:
2 cup confectioners' sugar -- divided
5 tablespoons milk -- divided
1 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 cup cocoa powder
2 can large buttermilk biscuits
Colored sprinkles
Chocolate sprinkles

Heat 2 inches peanut oil in a large pot or Dutch oven to 350 degrees F.
In a shallow bowl, stir together the ground cinnamon and sugar and
set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together 1  cup  of confectioners'
sugar, 2  tablespoons  of milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, set
aside. This is the vanilla icing. In another bowl, whisk together 1
cup  of confectioners' sugar, 1/4  cup  of cocoa powder and 3
tablespoons  of milk and set aside. This is the chocolate icing.

Lay out the biscuits on a cutting board and with a 1 1/2-inch round
cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out a hole from the middle of each
biscuit. Fry them in the oil until golden and then flip with tongs to
fry the other side. You can even fry the donut holes. Drain on paper
towels and then toss in the cinnamon-sugar or ice and decorate with
sprinkles, as desired.
