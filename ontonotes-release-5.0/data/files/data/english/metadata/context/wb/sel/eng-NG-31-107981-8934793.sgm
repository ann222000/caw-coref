CRASH PHYSICS:

Bugs vs. windshields............... speed only changes the size of the
splat.

no BODIES,
no LUGGAGE,
no SEATS
no PLANE PARTS\
no BUILDING parts.....

Only complete fools continue to believe planes were used on the towers on
9/11.

LOL, nope, just a person who isn't insane, or drug addled/addicted.

So, I am with my own people, the sane ones.

You don't qualify to be part of our group, and probably haven't
qualified for a long time.. sorry. So sad.

I'm in jail? Whoa!! It looks just like one of my bedrooms. There's a big
TV on the wall, and there's my radio stuff and there's my dogs. Maybe
I'm not in jail after all!

I saw the coverage on all the major news channels, where you pleaded guilty to murder and all kinds of mayhem and stuff.

Cnn, Fox, MSNBC, they all covered it

Look if they gave you an internet connection in jail, why not a dog.  Who am i to decide what prisoners get.  I have never been
there.  Maybe you have gone blind with age and now have a leader dog.  Or maybe it's one of those head nodding water sipping tako
bell dogs that you put in the back of a car and they let you keep it on your shelf.

You have TWO incredible Tako Bell talking, drinking nodding dogs.

I'd call that double lucky.

They're worth lots of $$ and you can probably auction them off on ebay for lots of cash.
