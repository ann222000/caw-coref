Why is Corrections in such a mess?

Some broad background:

Once upon a time the Prison Service operated as one big family, keeping each
other in line, supporting each other, real espirit de corps - it can be
likened to the military, everybody knew their job, knew their place.

It all started with the dividing up of the Department of Justice, when the
divisions (Courts, Prisons, Probation, Commercial Affairs etc) were split
away into their own entities.

Corrections, (prisons and probation), then implemented a corporate mode of
operating, as opposed to a heirarchical government / military style.
Management and government said prisons needed a culture change.....   This
effectively smashed the esprit de corps and created all sorts of
accountabilities and bonus schemes, resulting in less cooperation between
institutions as an example of the damage done.  At the same time many
managers were employed from outside  to bring in 'corporate mentality'.  The
whole restructuring took its toll.  Many experienced and long serving
personnel were passed over for the new positions or / and quit  (they were
considered dinosaurs by the new management).

At one stage head office (which was renamed to a 'corporate' National
Office) had very few experienced personnel or field experienced staff.  In
some cases the new 'advisors' had no experience of prisons let alone any
knowledge of the industry.  In one instance an advisor was asked about an
issue and the reply was not quite as expected and was asked how long have
you been with corrections, the reply was two months........... the response
to that was have you ever been into a prison, No, what the hell would you
know about prisons then?

Part of the restructuring was to remove middle managers, and inexperienced
junior officers could find themselves running a unit of 60 inmates. So no
one was properly in a position to be in charge under the manager. The
managers in some instances had 30 officers reporting to them plus around 60
inmates.  The managers couldn't manage.

Corrections has reintroduced a ranking structure, unfortunately a
considerable number of remaining experienced officer are no longer
interested in promotion or taking responsibility, or merely passed over.

Add to that and the massive growth thus increased numbers of inexperienced
officers to deal with increasingly shrewed / street wise / regulation /
legislation / bush lawyer / manipulative / druggy types inmates - it is easy
to see why most of the problem falls squarely on management. Plus the
increase in gender equalization of the personnel.  These days there are so
many female officers it is not uncommon for there to be no male officers on
duty to conduct searches of male inmates.  The numbers of female officers
who have become sexually / emotionally involved with inmates is kept pretty
hush hush.

Kim Workman who keeps commenting in the media was once the CEO of the Prison
Service who implemented much of the management change of culture in prisons.
So his commentary is slanted for a start.

Another important factor in the change was the move toward case management
system and becoming more of a friend to inmates, all part of trying to
reduce reoffending. Role conflict!!!

Many of the new officers are not necessarily appropriate persons for such
work - in some cases officers have relatives in prison (eg when the new
Napier prison was opened many of the officers were related to the inmates -
'blood is thicker than water'?).

That reminds me of the bean counter bozo in a senior management job in
Rotorua Hospital who wanted a caesarian operation postponed to the following
month when there would be more money in the till!  I believe that he
finished up 'managing' in an Auckland rubbish company.

Obviously you have some first hand experience of the way in which the system
'works'.

Is it really in a mess? This keeps being said, but the people saying it
sappear to have very unrealistic expectations of a department charged with
dealing with the nastiest, least trustworthy peopl in NZ.

How did what start? The non-specific "mess"? You're being very vaque.

How do you know there is less co-operation between the institutions?

The new management was right. When you change policy direction (because
policy isn't working and rates of recividism are rising steadily and
therefore needs needs changing) then you can really only promote the people
committed to implementing the change. No surprises there.

Fair comment. This happens all the time in any area of private or public
enterprise. Mistakes are made. They are corrected when recognised....if
they can be corrected.

This certainly isn't the case now, if it ever was.

That's because the pay increment isn't worth the hassle. A basic CO can make
more than $50K / annum with some overtime, while an SCO gets $56,000.....so
why take on the extra hassle and risk?

It doesn't take long for a corrections officer with any clues to get up to
speed.

I've not seen that.....but it may happen somewhere, sometime. However,
rosters are composed to see that this isn't the case. Perhaps if staff take
timer off sick it may happen......or the unit is locked down because it
can't function as it should.

It is a rare thing. No one is being unduly secretive.

So you dismiss the commentary of someone who knows what they are talking
about in favour of your own vague, non-specific insinuations and
innuendos.... Nice....

You clearly have no idea what sentence management and behaviour modeling is
is about. You've never heard of "friendly - not friends".

Yes, this is true, particularly among Maori. But you're grossly wrong in
saying that law-abiding Maori or other family member will destroy his own
life and work to help out a loser in that family.

If anything, these people provide powerful role models for the black sheep
in their own family to get himself sorted out.

Your post is full of the usual crap I read in the papers and hear on
talkback.

Have you ever worked in a prison? When and for how long? Which prison?

There are incompetent boobsd in any profession.......

or is one of the old school who presided over rising rates of
recidivism.....
