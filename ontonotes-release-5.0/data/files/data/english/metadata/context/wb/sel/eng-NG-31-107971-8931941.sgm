I've been studying  alot of the toned coins on Ebay.Some are &quot;artificially
toned&quot;.It looks like Food dye baked in or something.
But,if you see enough of these you get a good idea what is natural toning. I
see these bring premium prices.
What I want to know is about some of the wilder colors.How does this
happen?Some are very old coins,some are newer.Even only a few years old.
Pretty amazing.

Not a coin, but I have a .925 silver teaspoon (from 1841) I use in the
kitchen.

Occasionally if left for a while that can turn a mirad of colours, mostly
often a deep blue + purple.
all thats used to clean is normal washing up liquid in warm water, and left
to dry by its self.

I'll have to get a modern valueless good silver coin and give it some
scrubbing, see what happens.

The coins in a 40% silver 3-coin BU Bicentennial set I recently
purchased have rainbow toning on the edge. It's rather pretty, just
too bad none of it is on the obverse/reverse of the coins. Also have a
1962 proof quarter with a small spot of bluish/rainbow toning on the
reverse, more distractive than pretty. I wonder if a spot of toning
can be forced to spread over the entire coin?

Generally the toned coins I have are either grayish or have a golden
color. The gold color can look nice under the right lighting.

The .9999 silver coins can tone fast and easy.  Here is an ASE that was
wrapped in tissue paper about 4-5 years ago;

http://showcase.netins.net/web/billsdqandcoins/tonedSE.JPG

The colors will continue to change and I will continue to monitor the
progress.  When the coin mellows to look like this;

I will put the coin in an intercept shield holder to impede any further
toning.

flat and not touching. after only 4 months, there is some very real toning
that looks natural. i wonder is this would be considered natural or at?

If you look closely on some you can see where liquid has dripped or
pooled.It seems there's two guys on ebay selling weirdly artificially toned
coins and they use different methods .The first guy's method seems cruder/
more crude?.

I don't have good answers to match your good questions.  However, some who
proclaim artificial toning are just putting forth their best guess and they
could be wrong.  Further, I have read that some AT can be so natural looking
that it fools those with great expertise.  So, there will be toned coins
that you and I will not question the naturalness of the toning and there
will be toned coins that you and I reject as AT, without a second thought,
and then there will be those coins that we mistakenly accept as natural or
mistakenly reject as artificial.  Coin collecting sure ain't cut and dried.

I always said you can find out anything on the net.Geez.
Great stuff.I love the &quot;smell the coin&quot; part. So,you pays your money and
takes your chances.
Mostly,what I look for is the tranpancy and slight surface scratching on
silver.But that doesn't work all that well on alot of coins. I'm probaly
wrong half the time,though.

Anymore, it's not if the coin is AT or NT, it's if the coin meets the
definition of &quot;Market Acceptable&quot;. In practice, that means go ahead
and submit your nicest toners even if you're not sure. Roll the dice!

I've an Indian cent that began life in an ANACS 64BN slab, went to an
NGC 65RB slab, rejected by PCGS for questionable toning, then rejected
by NGC for the same reason. It was then submitted to PCGS via a major
dealer in Indian cents and came back 66RB.

Bruce (If you accept the toning, then 66 is a fair grade)

So, maybe it is a combination of kleenex and local environment that causes
the toning.  I wrapped a whole set of ASEs, each in its own kleenex, and
checked last week only to see no change.  Give it two more years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;artificially
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; toned&quot;.It looks like Food dye baked in or something.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But,if you see enough of these you get a good idea what is natural

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; old.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pretty amazing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The .9999 silver coins can tone fast and easy.  Here is an ASE that was
&gt;&gt;&gt; wrapped in tissue paper about 4-5 years ago;

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://showcase.netins.net/web/billsdqandcoins/tonedSE.JPG

&gt;&gt;Funny, I wrapped one in a kleenex and stored it in a small manila envelope
&gt;&gt;in June 2004.  I just checked it and it looks as shiny white as it did the
&gt;&gt;day I put it in there.  Maybe the toning all happens in the last 1-2
&gt;&gt;years,
&gt;&gt;but not if you watch.  I can't wait!

&gt;&gt;Bruce

&gt; canvas works quickly. just be very gentle.
">

I got an old canvas $10 One Cent moneybag and will transfer the ASE there
for a year or two.  See what happens.  Some of the best aging effects I've
encountered have been with individual silver coins from 1965-67 SMS sets.  I
have kept them in 2x2's for at least 30 years and today they have an amazing
warm glowing depth appearance to them -- not really a toning--  but unlike
any of the other BU silver coins I have kept in 2x2's for the same period.
There must be something &quot;special&quot; about the coins from those sets to make
them age that way, but I don't know what it is.

you know it's tempting, artificially toning because toning is
beautiful, even the old dark gothic looking toning, which I love too
because it's about age.  isn't the whole point of collecting coins the
history each coin shows you?  I look at our old coins and I feel an
enormous responsibility to them not to interfere with their ongoing
history, which makes any coins I have with gunk on them a problem to
me.  I'd like to see the gunk removed but not any toning or any of the
other aging characteristics.  I LIKE old.

Throw a bag over my head and beat me with a stick if I ever blithely
shove our coins into ovens or potatoes or jars of vaseline to make
them colorful.

Yes, they may be toning.. it is after all a build-up of a AgS layer to a
thickness where is refracts light differently than the surrounding
surface. Besides the H2S (or Cl) source you usually need moisture. Heat
can also accelerate the process by driving the H2S out of the source,
but it usually happens too fast and becomes easily detectable. IAW, if
you're in a dry climate tone your coins in the bathroom ;)

I would never tone an old cone, but I might try it on a some new Eagle
sometime. Even if I messed up, the coins would still be worth melt.

I wonder if you should lightly clean the coins with soap and water
before trying any of the toning methods? If there are oils or other
contaminants on the surface I would think it could effect the toning
and might result in an uneven surface?

I just read somewhere a collector or dealer who dips her coins in
denatured or distilled alcohol before slabbing because she believes
there are elements/oils on coins that continue to chemically react
after they've been slabbed, possibly causing damage.  Doing so she
removes any contaminants in this process.

Leave it up to a Star Trek geek to spell store wrong.

Gee, and I spelled it wrong twice.  Exactly the same way.

Almost like I didn't want to give people a clickable link to what
was obviously an advertising ploy.

And, I noticed you didn't deny you're connected with the company,
despite referring to the company in the third person.

Scott is not amused...

Man, you are really sharp there Sherlock. You may not be amused, but
you sure are amusing. I built the site for my friend who owns the
store. Third person would be appropriate considering that fact. You
should find something better to do with your lonely self, other than
harassing strangers on the net. I'm sure if you were to try real hard
you might actually be able to get a life. Just keep trying my little
star trek geek, you will reach maturity someday, you poor pathetic
thing.
