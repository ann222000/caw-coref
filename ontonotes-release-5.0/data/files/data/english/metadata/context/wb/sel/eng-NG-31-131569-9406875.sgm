The car thief ripped the side compartment of the car next to the
steering wheel.  The ignition was fired with the use of a pin and he
was well off to pawn the car until the man who owned the car threw a
football into the windshield and jagged pieces of glass flew
everywhere even into the eyes of the burgular as they popped though he
was hardly phased by it as though he were only struck by a pebble.  He
continued on and the resident blocked the way yet the car thief ran
into him as the man flew over the roof of the car from impact and
landed bruised and torn on the road.  The later accounts of the car
thief were as such.  He took drugs to remedy his uneventful life.  He
took them also to quell a major depression that came if he were not to
take it.  And he dreamed of strange things while stoned.  He even
wrote of it and drew the images on paper.  One scene involved the
feeling of him being so big that nothing on Earth could satisfy his
needs..so he ate houses like they were ants.  He saw a picture of his
ex-girlfriend distorted and reconfigured.  A robot who wanted to make
love to him appeared and as he had the inner sensation of actually
having sex with the robot made him wish it were more than just metal
and circuits.  He saw jugglers in the distance from a psychopathic
circus show going around town.  He watched as one of the clowns
inserted a needle into the belly of a voodoo doll.  There came fresh
drops of the blood from the doll and Jason the car thief could feel
the needle.. So he wanted out of these dreams.. as he dreamt more and
more the dreams would take more horrifying shapes to no end.  As such
he tried to pull himself out from dreams but the drugs were too
strong.  Later on, he woke up in a villa filled with poor people.  He
looked for his wallet but it was stripped from him.  As he took his
drugs to replace his appetite for real living he felt great but the
prize just wasn't there.. but he would easily live his life
pointlessly as the drugs worked.  The illusions themselves had great
meaning.. and they probably sufficed as something predicatory to
existance.. for instance, he could work at a car dealership, but he
was into theft of cars.  And he refused as such to live life.. but
take a dream and make it real, people would say.  The dream of
happiness came in the villa as he had nothing but one week's supply of
food as he was dying in a fantasy..
