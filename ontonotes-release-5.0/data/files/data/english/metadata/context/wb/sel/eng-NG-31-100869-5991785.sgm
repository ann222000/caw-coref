Subject: What Happens When You Pass On.  Part 4.    Jan. 13, 2007.

We will now continue our discussion from the book, The
Beginners Guide For The Recently Deceased.

Let's take a look at some of the main differences be-
tween where your are and where you've come from.

Vive la
difference

The most obvious difference between the
astral and the physical world is the light.
It's because the light is so special here that
this world was given the name astral, which
means "starry."
Everywhere you look there's an irides-
cense that surrounds and permeates
everything.  So much so that if I told you
everthing here was made of mother-of-
pearl, you might even believe me. Astral
matter not only baths in this light, it also
generates it.  Astral matter is "self-lumin-
nous."  It's also transparent to the light
from the sun, so we live in a world with no shadows,
not even the vast one caused by the rotation of Earth.
One of the reasons that time feels different here is the
absence of day and night as we knew them - a pattern
that regulated our physical lives.
You may have noticed that your vision is free of the
distortion of perspective - objects no longer reduce in
size as their distance from you increases.  Nor do ob-
jects at different distances appear to move differently
from the point of view of a moving observer - a phe-
nomena known as parallax.  Some of you may have also
realized that you're now able to see objects from all
sides simultaneously.  It's confusing at first, sometimes
to the point where familiar objects are unrecognizable,
but it doesn't take long to get used to it.  The combined
effect of these things is that our vision is extraordinar-
ily enhanced.
There are also entirely new colors - colors that can't
be described with reference to any physical ones.  The
astral world is world of color - those of you who like
to paint will find a far greater palette to create with. All
colors appear more delicate, more radiant and alive -
and they communicate more.  Here, colors reveal quali-
ties, and all qualities find expression in color.  Your
charater is openly expressed in the colors of your as-
tral body.  The motives behind your each and every
thought are as obvious as hand gestures and as read-
able as color-coded flags.  Likeewise, music can now be
seen as well as heard, expressing itself in form accord-
ing to its style, and color according to its emotional
content.
