Tantra: The quest for the ecstatic mind

by Kathleen Kesson

This essay is one of a collection of original writings on spirituality and
education edited by John P. Miller and Yoshiharu Nakagawa, published by the
Foundation for Educational Renewal in January 2002.

In 1968, George Leonard, an education writer and consultant, wrote a book
entitled Education and Ecstasy. Capturing the spirit of the decade, it wove
together ideas from the human potential movement, the counterculture, brain
research, new technologies, and psychedelic experimentation to attempt to
seed new thinking about educational possibilities. Leonard’s book was widely
read by a mass audience. Like many of us at the time, Leonard was confident
that the various revolutions taking place in consciousness, social patterns,
and politics were about to usher in a new era of freedom, experimentation,
and, well, ecstasy. We would, he hoped, soon take advantage of innovative
new technologies to individualize instruction. We would take seriously the
current brain research that insisted that pleasure (yes pleasure!) was at
the heart of meaningful learning, and we would affirm that the aim of human
life was the fulfillment of latent human capacities, including the
capacities for joy, freedom, inquiry, and relationship.

Well, it is the year 2001, over 30 years after the publication of this
interesting book, and there is today little talk of pleasure or ecstasy, or
even joy in the world of educational discourse. Now, the more familiar words
are assessment, standards, zero tolerance, and accountability—the words of
the corporate boardroom, not the human potential movement. In such a
climate, it is perhaps absurd to attempt to resuscitate interest in the
ecstatic possibilities of the human mind. But the quest for ecstasy—the
search for meaning, pleasure, and lasting joy—is much older than the 60’s
cultural revolution. It is an important current in all of human history, and
we can only hope that our contemporary obsession with the standardization
and mechanization of learning may eventually give way to an engagement with
more enduring human values, including that state of aesthetic fulfillment
spoken of by sages throughout time, and widely misunderstood—the state of
ecstasy, or bliss (ananda, in Sanskrit). It is this transformation to a
state of blissful enlightenment that provides the foundation of Tantric
spiritual practice. Understanding the mental model and the spiritual science
underlying this practice may help orient us towards more expansive
educational possibilities, should we ever tire of the corporate social
engineering that characterizes the present era of education.

There are other reasons why it is vital for educators to understand various
forms of spirituality and spiritual practice, even such esoteric traditions
as Tantra. Let me share a personal story. I recently returned from a trip to
India. On the leg of the flight between Kuwait and London, I sat between a
woman from Mumbai, India and a woman from Karachi, Pakistan. The woman from
Pakistan shared with us a handwritten piece of inspirational writing from
her Muslim tradition, which we agreed had universal appeal. The woman from
India, a Hindu, unpacked a gift she had received on her trip, and showed us
the lovely, beaded statue of the legendary god Krishna that her nephew had
given her for her birthday. An animated conversation ensued among us that
covered the topics of idol worship, the names of God, deities, gender
issues, and Pakistan/Indian hostilities. All of us were comfortable
discussing our various beliefs and seeking the common threads in our
understandings of these topics. The woman from India talked about her son
who had become a computer programmer and wanted nothing more than to settle
in America. I talked about my son, who is an aspiring Sanskrit scholar,
married to a Parsi woman from Mumbai, and who wants nothing more than to
stay in India. The woman from Pakistan, a geography teacher, was extremely
interested in strategies to enliven her geography classes, which sparked a
spirited discussion about the project method, experiential learning, John
Dewey, and Howard Gardner’s multiple intelligences theory. We chuckled at
the ironies in all of this. And thus, global connections are made in this
increasingly smaller world. In this era of globalization, easy international
transportation, electronic communication, and immigration, it is crucial
that we come to understand both our cultural differences and the
similarities that promise to link us together in peaceful coexistence.

Religious difference is the one territory largely ignored by theorists of
multicultural education. Perhaps this is because of great nervousness having
to do with anything "spiritual" in the context of public education. And yet
it is religious differences that lie at the root of many of the most
devastating international conflicts, as well as those closer to home. In
order to learn to live together in an increasingly pluralistic world, we
must come to understand each other, and this understanding must begin with
knowledge.

In addition to increasing our intercultural understanding, there are yet
other reasons to study worldviews that are vastly different from our
taken-for-granted ways of thinking. Tantra embodies a philosophy of mind and
consciousness that challenges some of the most fundamental assumptions upon
which we base our western theories of teaching and learning. Its theories
are derived from centuries of introspective practice, providing us with a
wealth of historic, contemplative insight. Understanding such significant
conceptual differences may help us think in fresh ways about our taken for
granted assumptions, which could foster important new questions and insights
about the aims and purposes, as well as the methods, of education. And
finally, Tantra embodies a value system worth examining in this era of
materialism, greed, and egocentricity writ large. Contemporary Tantrics are
attempting to put their philosophical principles as well as their values
into practice in education. I believe that we all have something to learn
from this effort.

The Spiritual Science of Tantra

What combination of cultural circumstance and internal psychological dynamic
is it that causes some of us to be attracted to the "Other", that which is
quite foreign to everything in our culture of birth? Why are some people
content to carry on the cultural and spiritual traditions of their
foremothers and fathers, and others only satisfied to forge less familiar
paths? In my case, it was likely a convergence of factors. I was born in a
neighborhood bordering the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, a port city
known for its liberality and cultural pluralism, to parents of mixed
European heritage. One of my earliest memories, reinforced by family
photographs and my mother’s narratives, is of regular excursions in my
stroller to the Japanese Tea Gardens in that park. Another vivid memory is
of the Chinese New Year’s Parade on Grant Avenue—I recall being very small
and very lost there, while above me a dragon’s head dipped and swayed and
firecrackers boomed. One might think such an early trauma would have left me
terrified of all things "Oriental" (a common term signifying Asian back
then), yet my fascination only grew. Mother and I went to Chinatown
regularly, for lunch and shopping, and on one of these excursions I
purchased a golden Buddha. Returning home, I set it up in my room, and
proudly announced to my mother that I believed in reincarnation. I was a
young adolescent at the time, so perhaps my announcement was designed for
shock value. I think not however, for the attraction continued to grow and
deepen. Fortunately I had parents who, rather than being shocked at my
declaration, encouraged me to explore whatever interested me spiritually,
which probably resulted in my later pursuing an undergraduate minor in
comparative religion and philosophy.

When I left home to take up professional studies in dance and theater, one
of the first books I bought myself was a handbook on Hatha Yoga. Laboring in
the privacy of my own small Hollywood apartment, I worked to perfect the
physical yoga postures. I approached them much as I approached my dance
studies, with determination and the goal of technical perfection! In that
book, there was some mention made of meditation, and this sounded like a
good thing, so I tried to teach myself how to do it. There is some
conventional wisdom in the world of spiritual practice that when the student
is ready, the teacher, or the teachings, will appear. That did seem to be
the operative principle in my case. In 1965, I was working as a dancer on a
movie set at Allied Arts Studio in Hollywood. I can’t even remember what
movie it was now, 35 years later, but I distinctly remember the book that
many of the leading actors were reading during the filming. It was The
Autobiography of a Yogi, by Paramahansa Yogananda (1946). I was intrigued.
The actors invited me out to lunch, and we went next door to the first
vegetarian restaurant I had ever experienced, which happened to be
associated with the Self-Realization Fellowship (the LA center of
Yogananda’s teachings). I was hooked; I bought the book, began to eat
soybeans and yogurt and drink herbal tea, and immersed myself in what would
become a lifetime of exploration of the various spiritual traditions of the
"East."

At the core of many of these traditions is Tantra, perhaps the most ancient
set of spiritual practices still in existence on the planet. There are
scholarly debates about Tantra’s origins as well as its relationship to the
Vedic School of Indian philosophy, which is historically important in
Hinduism. The history of this tradition is hard to pin down due to the oral
nature of transmission that has carried its teachings forth for centuries.
Its Indian roots are in the indigenous nature worship that predated the
Aryan invasions (approximately 1500 BCE) of that subcontinent. It both
shaped and was shaped by the scriptures known as the Vedas, composed in
India by the invading Aryans. Its many branches include "cults", such as
Shaeva, Kaula, and Shakta cults, as well as profound influences upon major
religious traditions, including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism. It is at
the heart of what we know in the west as "Yoga", due in large part to the
work of Patanjali around 100 CE to systematize the beliefs and principles
into a practice. The system articulated by Patanjali came to be called
Astanga Yoga, the "Eight-Fold Path." Although Tantra is much larger, in both
the historical and philosophical sense, than Yoga, the terms can be, to some
extent, used interchangeably. According to Zimmer (1951), yoga means "the
yoking of empirical consciousness to transcendental consciousness" (p. 580).

Tantra is a culturally specific spiritual practice, and thus connected with
particular myths, legends, creation stories, deities, and forms of ritual
and worship. Tantra and Yoga permeate Hindu mythology, such as in the epic
poem, The Mahabharata, and one of its most important narratives, the
Bhagavad-Gita. Despite its mythopoeic elements, Tantra is not itself a
religion, but a "spiritual science", a set of practices that includes
physical culture, mental development, and spiritual devotion. Although
Tantra has a mystical and a philosophical dimension, virtually all writings
about it stress the experiential nature of the practice, which requires no
adherence to belief or dogma.

The most appropriate analogy for this for this internal process in the
modern world is probably psychoanalysis. Bharati (1965) uses the phrase
"psycho-experimental-speculative" to convey the essentially exploratory
nature of the practice. In this context, gods and goddesses, deities and
demons have no ontological or existential status to the Tantric, rather they
serve as archetypes: "necessary anthropomorphic ways of finding out ‘what is
inside the mind’" (p. 20). Axioms, principles and guidelines are tentatively
held speculative constructs, to be amended on the basis of experimental
data.

Below, I provide a necessarily abbreviated overview of the main concepts and
assumptions underlying Tantra, then highlight one particular form of
education—Neo-humanist education—that is making the effort to implement this
philosophy.

Fundamental concepts

For ease of communication, what follows is an attempt to articulate some of
the fundamental concepts of Tantra in the context of Western philosophical
categories. I do this with some hesitation in this "post-ontological,
post-epistemological" academic atmosphere. (For an exploration of the
relationship between contemplative traditions and philosophical
postmodernism, see Kesson, 2000.) For the purposes of this paper, however,
rather than problematize the categories, I will lay out the ontological,
epistemological, psychological, and axiological principles that seem most
germane to my understanding of this very complex system.

Ontology. When we study ontology, we study the nature of being. According to
Tantra, human being is a multidimensional condition. At the level of the
conscious mind, there is a sense of separation. But within every human
resides the "âtman", variously defined as soul, mind, spirit, or self
(Müller, 1962). Through contemplative practice, one realizes the essential
unity of the âtman with the higher Self, variously called the Divine, the
Supreme, the Absolute. In this tradition, this highest Self is the last
point to be reached by philosophical speculation, and the goal is overcoming
the limitations imposed by the individual ego. The working assumption here
is that there is a "higher" form of existence, attained when the ego-bound
mind is freed of illusion. This notion of a supreme state, variously called
nirvana (Buddhism), satori (Zen), or samadhi (Tantra), represents humanity’s
longing for something larger and more significant than the limited self.
Tantra supposes that the individual mind (or unit mind) can transcend its
limitations to understand itself as part of the ocean of limitless
consciousness. Tantric practice is a system of atunement in which the
individual mind comes into resonance with the universal mind.

Psychology. More properly phrased, in this context, biopsychology, Tantra
proposes a model of the psyche that encompasses the entire human body, which
is composed of both material and subtle energies as well as "energy fields"
outside the body. Unlike western models of the mind, which locate mental
functions entirely in the brain, Tantra assumes a more interpenetrating
body-mind system, a continuum of increasing subtlety as one moves
conceptually from the dense material body to the more ethereal mental
functions. To understand this comprehensive psychosomatic system, one must
suspend deeply engrained, dualistic models of body and mind.

Perhaps the most elusive concept to people not practiced in this tradition
is the notion of kundalini (kula kundalini literally means "coiled
serpentine force"). The kundalini is a psycho/spiritual force that lies
dormant at the base of the spine until "awakened"—most commonly by the
invocation of a mantra (a special sound vibration that when repeated, either
audibly or internally, fosters a resonance between the practitioner and the
sought after state of cosmic consciousness), or through other psycho-somatic
processes such as chanting, breath control (pranayama), visualization
(either internally or on an external object), or concentration. The awakened
kundalini moves upward through a system of seven chakras along the shushuma
nadi, a psychic energy channel in the spine. Chakras are "the points of
contact between the individual on the one hand, and non-physical energies
and beings on the other—psychic energy centres (sic) which are associated
with particular areas of the body, but are not part of the body" (King,
1986, p. 55). Various Tantric texts allude to innumerable other energy
centers in the body, "all of them interconnected by subtle energy channels,
the psychic equivalents of nerves, arteries, and veins, which are called
nadis" (p. 56). For our purposes, the main point of interest is that the
various chakras are thought to control different aspects of human life
(speech, digestion, emotions, mental activity, etc.) culminating with the
seventh and highest chakra at the top of the head, which is the seat of pure
blissful consciousness, Sat Chit Ananda. According to Tantra, physical,
mental, and spiritual health depends on the proper balance and functioning
of the energy of the chakras. The entire system, which includes physical
exercises, meditation, vegetarian diet, and breathing techniques, is
oriented towards creating such a balance, a state of well-being that is
conducive to the realization of the higher, or limitless Self.

While the chakras may have no "objective" (physical) existence, they are a
useful heuristic device. That they are "real" at some level of experience is
suggested by the Tantric theory of the Sanskrit language, which is that the
phonemes in that language are based upon the vibrational sound frequencies
of the various "petals" of the chakras. Sanskrit is, according to this
theory, a language of the body, and the many chants and mantras based upon
these sounds do not merely correspond to arbitrarily assigned meanings, but
have psychosomatic effects as well. Other traditional explanations of the
origins of Sanskrit differ on this point.

While Tantra recognizes, with western psychology, the conscious and the
subconscious layers of the mind, it further elaborates the dimensionality of
the mind by positing mental realms termed the "superconscious", where the
capacities for intuition, discrimination (defined as the ability to
transcend illusion), and union with the infinite abide. Western psychology
pays little attention to these categories of the superconscious. One
important exception to this neglect is the field of transpersonal
psychology, which is perhaps best articulated in the work of the prolific,
interdisciplinary scholar, Ken Wilber.

Epistemology. Epistemology is a category of speculation applied to efforts
to understand how it is we can know anything at all. Ironically, in
contemplative practice, it seems more important to explore the process of
unknowing - that is, how we free ourselves of limited, conditioned
responses. Some of the epistemological processes utilized to enable the mind
to deconstruct its normal awareness are embodied in Tantric meditative
techniques: bhuta shuddi (withdrawal of the mind from the external world);
asana shuddi (process of withdrawing the mind from its conditioned
identification with the body); citta shuddi (suspension of thoughts);
dharana (focused concentration on a single point of awareness); and dhyana
(unification of individual consciousness with cosmic consciousness, a
blissful state of non-duality).

Many eastern philosophies disavow all objective knowledge as illusory, which
has in some historical cases led to cultural passivity. While Tantra is
certainly an introspective practice, its essential dynamism is best
represented by a yantra (image for contemplation) used by Ananda Marga, a
contemporary Tantric group, which includes two interlocking triangles, one
pointing upwards and one pointing downwards. These are said to symbolize the
necessity for "objective" adjustment (action in the world) to complement the
"subjective approach" of contemplative practice. Tantra’s longevity may in
part be due to its empirical method (it is an experiential, experimental
approach to the development of consciousness). Unlike western science,
however, there is an emphasis on following all thought to its source,
introspectively. This practice highlights the nature of all thought as
dependent upon other thought. When the jinána yogi (one who seeks self
realization through the path of knowledge) proceeds along this
epistemological line, he or she inevitably reaches a point where both
reflection and refraction end. That is, the mind of the inquirer reaches a
point where it fails to comprehend that plate on which the processes of
reflection and refraction operate. The point where the mind loses its
capacity to analyse (sic) or compare further is the supreme point. (Sarkar,
1998, p. 180).

Tantric practice thus embodies both a dynamic theory of knowledge and a keen
sense of its limits, or the point where intellectuality gives way to
intuition.

Axiology. Morality is said to be the base of Tantric practice. In historical
times, it is said that when disciples approached a guru (spiritual teacher)
seeking enlightenment, they would often be instructed to develop a moral
approach to life before given further teachings. Unlike the conventional
morality in some religions, in which the precepts are rigid and connected to
fixed structures of reward and punishment, the moral framework in Tantric
Yoga is a set of guidelines oriented towards creating mental harmony. They
include principles of relating to society (Yama) and principles for personal
integration (Niyama). The principles of Yama include: Ahimsa, action
performed without the intention to harm anyone or anything by thought, word,
or deed; Satya, a spirit of truthfulness, in which all thought, speech and
action is guided by a feeling of benevolence; Asteya, trustworthiness,
non-stealing, the spirit of not taking that which belongs to another;
Aparigraha, an ecological and psychological principle that asks that we
minimize our needs, and only use what is necessary for individual
preservation; and Bramacarya, a state of mind in which one sees everyone as
an expression of the Divine.

The principles of Niyama include Shaoca, the cultivation of a strong healthy
body through proper exercise, diet and asanas (yoga postures), as well as
attention to destructive mental habits such as greed, jealousy, fear, shame,
etc.; Santosa, cultivation of a state of mental ease, contentment; Tapah,
the practice of foregoing personal pleasures for the joy of serving others,
an expression of our essential "oneness"; Svadhyaya, the effort to penetrate
beyond dogma and ritualism to the truth in scriptures; and Ishvara
Pranidhana, the mental effort, through meditation, towards union with cosmic
consciousness.

All of these principles have been interpreted in various ways, and a more
complex examination of the subtleties and differences of interpretation are
well beyond the scope of this introductory paper. What is important is to
understand that the pedagogical principles that emerge from these values
play an important role in the educational design of Tantric schools.

Misconceptions and Distortions of Tantra

In the western mind, Tantra is most often associated with "spiritual
sexuality", and sometimes with magical practices and the occult. It is not
difficult to understand how these conceptions came about. Ideas in Tantric
texts, according to Eliade (in Bharati, 1965), are frequently couched in
secret, obscure language, with double meanings, sometimes expressed in
erotic terminology. This has two intentions: first, to camouflage the
teachings from non-initiates, and second, to "project the Yogi into the
‘paradoxical situation’ indispensable for his (sic) spiritual training" (p.
173). Many of the primal symbols of Tantra are overtly sexual in content. In
India, one can still visit temples dedicated to Shiva and observe
contemporary Shiva worshippers making offerings at an altar at which the
primary symbol is a phallus (lingam) emerging from a vagina (yoni). In
Tantric lore, the act of creation between people, as represented in the
sexual act, parallels the cosmic act of creation, in which pure
consciousness (often represented by Shiva) interfaces with active, dynamic
forces in time and space (often represented by his consort, Shakti). Lama
Yeshe (1987) suggests that the images of male and female deities in erotic
embraces, rather than signifying degeneration (a charge that has been
directed towards Tantra), is a symbolic portrayal of the inner unification
of our own male and female energies. On a deeper level, their embrace
symbolizes the aim of the very highest Tantric practices: generation of a
most subtle and blissful state of mind that, by its very nature, is
supremely suited to penetrate ultimate reality and free us from all delusion
and suffering (p. 31-32).

Ecstatic bliss, brought about by the "sense of freedom from the
impoverishment brought about by ego-centeredness" is, according to Guenther
(1972), a "peak experience of pure aesthetic perception and enjoyment" (p.
37). For most of us, sexuality is as close as we ever get to a peak
experience (Maslow, the western psychologist who developed the theory of the
"peak experience" describes it as "the experience of awe, mystery, wonder,
or of perfect completion" [1975, p. 312]). Is it any wonder that early Yogis
used symbols derived from such fundamental human experience to describe what
is, essentially, indescribable? In truth, while it is the erotocentric
passages in Tantric texts that have made Tantra famous, these passages
represent only a small fraction of the literature.

Because esoteric texts are widely available now, as opposed to a former time
in which the teachings were transmitted orally by spiritual teachers who
oversaw the moral and ethical development of their disciples, interpreters
have made of the teachings what they will; thus a body of both sexual and
occult practices has sprung up around Tantra, which according to some
contemporary Tantrics, are but pale reflections of the genuine enlightenment
tradition. The theme of ecstasy, says Bharati (1965), "has been victimized
in recent times by fraudulent esotericism of the sort that is rampant in the
western world (p. 285). While it is beyond the scope of this paper to
develop an elaborate critique of these practices, let the reader be
cautioned that especially in the west, practitioners have sometimes been
guilty of appropriating those elements of the practice which suit their
inclinations, without attention to the much broader and deeper spiritual
tradition from which they have been extracted.

Herein, of course, lies one of the great dilemmas of this era of cultural
pluralism, exchange, and synthesis: to what extent can we adopt aspects of
"foreign" traditions to meet our own spiritual needs without being guilty of
cultural appropriation? And, without neutralizing, trivializing, or
distorting the original intent(s) of the tradition? It is an ethical dilemma
with which I have personally wrestled. Lama Yeshe reminds us that it is
"very important to be able to differentiate clearly between the essence of
Tantra and the cultural forms in which it is currently (and historically)
wrapped (1987, p. 27). Tantra, he notes, is far deeper than language or
custom might suggest. It is also important to remember that Tantra is
nomadic, traveling as it has from India to China, Tibet, Japan (Zen) and
more recently to the "Western" world. In transit, the essence remains, while
forms change. And that essence, Lama Yeshe reminds us, is a teaching that
embodies a way of breaking free from all the conditioning that limits our
understanding of who we are and what we can become. In this sense, it is a
truly universal spiritual practice.

Educating the Ecstatic Mind

Neo-humanist education has evolved from the teachings of Prabhat Ranjan
Sarkar, a Tantric guru of the 20th century with a worldwide following. The
fundamental principles were originally laid out in a little book entitled
The Liberation of Intellect: Neo-Humanism (1982). Neo-humanism is defined
as:

The love and respect for all people, extended to include all living beings,
animate and inanimate. Neo-humanist education is the concerned effort to
develop the highest human potential of every child. This translates into an
emphasis on the whole child—physical, mental and spiritual—infusing children
with love so that they grow into people who care to improve the world in
which they live.

(Nivedita &amp; Bardwell, 1999, p. 147)

In contrast to a dominant western view of education (increasingly adopted by
"modernizing" nations the world over), which understands the individual as
fundamentally alone in the universe and in competition with others for
resources and status, this educational philosophy promotes a vision of
humanity as "intimately linked with the fabric of the universe" (Bussey,
2000, p. 10). This fundamental concept of interconnectedness, derived
directly from Tantric philosophy, is at the heart of their pedagogy. Also at
the heart of the philosophy are concepts familiar to educators acquainted
with the experiential, constructivist educational models of John Dewey and
other "progressive" educators: continuity, interaction, engagement, and
integration. Knowledge, in Tantra, is obtained through personal encounter,
through concrete involvement with and through an understanding of the
relationship of one thing to another as well as of the fundamental unity of
things. This happens in an integrated way, through feeling, acting,
thinking, which is the ‘Way’ as a process of unification. The result, the
unity of knowledge, is then not a constructed intellectual scheme, but a
personal acquisition, a living state of mind which can be recognized and
known, but which defies all conceptual statements (Guenther, 1972, p.
100-101).

Interestingly, according to Tantric scholar Guenther, in Buddhism, Tantra
means both "integration" and "continuity." We can hear shades of Dewey in
the words Guenther uses to describe the form of learning fundamental to
Tantra:

The world of man (sic) is not some solipsism (subjectivism at its peak) nor
is it the sum total of all the objects that can be found in the world; the
world of man is his horizon of meaning without which there can neither be a
world nor an understanding of it so that man can live. This horizon of
meaning is not something fixed once and forever, but it expands as man
grows, and growth is the actuality of man’s lived experience (p. 3).

The human problem is one of knowledge and that knowledge is not merely a
record of the past but a reshaping of the present directed toward
fulfillments in the emerging future (p. 3).

We can begin to glean from these descriptions an idea of the inherent
dynamism of Tantra, and of its concerns with human growth and development
and with lived experience. Its gaze is not otherworldly, but rather focused
on concrete human experience, understood introspectively. This synthesis of
the core ideas of Tantra raises a number of important questions for
educators to consider: What sorts of educational experiences are
integrative, involving body, emotions, mind - the full spectrum of human
being? What sort of pedagogy might illuminate the ways in which the mind
gets "stuck" in habitual thinking patterns, and how might we help students
become reflective about those patterns? What sorts of educational
experiences evoke shifts in perspective that lead to greater freedom, joy,
sensitivity, compassion and purpose? What do we have to learn about the
nature of deeply aesthetic experience, in which subject and object fuse in
pure pleasure and appreciation?

Since I first wrote about Neo-humanist education for the Holistic Education
Review (Kesson, 1988), schools in this Tantric tradition have continued to
proliferate all over the world (there are over 1000 schools in over 50
countries in both the "developed" and the "developing" world). Recently,
practitioners in Neo-humanist schools contributed short narratives of their
practice for a lovely, illustrated collection entitled Neo-Humanist
Education (Ananda Rama, 2000). I was asked to review these papers and write
a brief introduction, and was pleased to see that this tradition, from
humble beginnings, is beginning to make a significant contribution to the
emerging literature on spiritual pedagogy.

The core values listed earlier in this paper, under "Axiology" serve as a
referent for educational decisions in this approach and further expand on
the basic commitments noted above. Based on my study of this system, a few
principles stand out as fundamental. First, Neo-humanist education confers a
much needed sense of value on the profession of teaching. The work of
teachers is thought to be one of the most important roles in society, and
the work they do is thought to be far more than that of a technician.
Morality, ethics, and the development of pro-social behavior is of great
importance in this system, and it is believed that "adult’s loving behavior
and good role modeling are the most effective ways of helping children
develop their morality" (Nivedita &amp; Bardwell, 1999, p. 151). Therefore, the
qualifications of a teacher must include "personal integrity, strength of
character, righteousness, a feeling for social service, unselfishness, an
inspiring personality, and leadership ability" (Jacobson, 2000, p. 20). It
goes without saying that teachers should be deeply engaged with their own
spiritual practice, for it is felt that working with children demands
mindful self-analysis.

Teachers, above all else, must exemplify the notion of bramacarya, a state
of mind in which everyone is perceived as an expression of the Divine.
Teachers are encouraged to see the child in all of his or her potential
fullness, as opposed to a "deficit model" in which students are perceived as
incomplete, and in need of fixing. This fundamental shift in perception
gives rise to a host of pedagogical commitments. Teachers act as
facilitators, "encouraging and guiding the children to bring out what is
within themselves" (Jacobson &amp; Volpe, 2000, p. 21). Academic experiences
encourage the creative self-expression of each child. And at the spiritual
level, the validity of spiritual experience is affirmed through myth, story,
play and the opportunity for reflection within the context of the overall
life and rhythm of the class. Bussey (2000) reminds us that spirituality is
not a doctrine, but a "living sense of one’s connectedness within a greater
whole" (p. 29).

This sense of interconnectedness finds concrete expression in the
Neo-humanist commitment to fostering a "sense of place." On the material
level, students practice aparigraha as they participate in organic
agriculture, recycling, composting, land and water management, forestry, and
wildlife care. At a more conceptual level, this move towards sustainability
"must be created in local communities by people who have been stirred by a
profound sense of wonder at the beauty and mystery of the world around them,
who have experienced ecstasy in nature" (Ananda Mitra, 2000, p. 53). The
capacity for "wonder at the beauty and mystery of the world" is essentially
an aesthetic capacity, and Neo-humanist schools understand art and the
creative process as central to the full development of human being.
Painting, music, dance, sculpture, music, and theater are at the core of the
curriculum in these schools, not at the periphery, and these art forms are
fully integrated into all subjects, for it is art that expands the
inventive, intuitive, and imaginative powers of the superconscious mind.

A key element of the Neo-humanist vision is the belief that educational
institutions are of great importance in the transformation of our world from
its current conditions of war, poverty, environmental degradation,
materialism, racism, and a host of other destructive "isms" to a world of
mutual respect, peace, and justice that is free from dogma, superstition,
and exploitation. To this end, Neo-humanist educators value the multitude of
cultural expressions that make up the whole of humanity, fostering
indigenous language, arts, and other cultural expressions in their schools.
Multicultural education, in this context, is about "transcending the text of
nationalism and creating a new type of globalism: (a) recognition of the
differences that are part of the post-modern thrust but not its conclusion;
a climax neither in capitalist homogeneity nor post-modern nihilism but in
life-embracing unity" (Inayatullah, 2000, p. 72). One of the currents that
Neo-humanist schools find themselves swimming against is what is termed
"pseudo-culture", the homogenous (mostly American) music, films, and
television shows that are designed not to uplift the human spirit, but to
gain short term profits for their makers. These products are finding their
way into every corner of the world, and eroding local cultural expressions
and sentiments. This raging current of cultural products is countered in
Neo-humanist schools by working to develop local art and craft forms, by
media literacy and the development of a critical social/political awareness,
and by fostering the creative transmission of cherished local values to
future generations (through plays, murals, literature, and other forms of
expression).

Neo-humanist schools are understood as communities in the broadest sense,
with the welfare of all of the groups—parents, teachers, staff, and
students—in mind. For example, schools in poverty- stricken areas of the
world often have adult education, nutritional programs, and agricultural
projects connected to them. Students in Neo-humanist schools are encouraged
to direct their efforts outwards to the community in self-selected service
projects, exemplifying the commitment to tapah. Service to people, plants,
animals and the earth itself helps to develop feelings of selflessness, and
a sense that one is "involved in the web of life as a contributor and not
only a taker" (Ananda Rama, 2000, p. 63).

Children in these schools are exposed to the basic Yoga practices embodied
in Tantric philosophy. Students’ all around growth and development is
fostered through eating wholesome vegetarian foods, the practice of asanas
(physical postures that balance and strengthen the body), guided imagery,
and ample opportunities for silent reflection and introspection. One
powerful practice, sustained even into the higher grades, is the "morning
circle", a collective activity in which the child has an opportunity to
transcend their own personal struggles to feel themselves an integral part
of the whole. Morning circle may include singing, dancing, chanting,
contemplation, or discussion, but whatever the content, the aim is that
students "contribute to the collective intelligence and wisdom (and) at the
same time they are supported by the powerful synergetic flow" (Merz, 2000,
p. 30). Above all, joy and pleasure in learning is fostered in an atmosphere
free from rewards and punishments, from externally mandated standards of
learning, and from the unproductive stress of high stakes tests. Unlike
state schools (in almost any modern, industrialized country), which
increasingly are required to "cover the curriculum", whether or not the
curriculum connects to anything of relevance to the students, Neo-humanist
schools have the luxury of cultivating the more subtle human characteristics
and interests: emotion, intuition, insight, imagination, aesthetics,
reflection, service, and spiritual development. This educational philosophy
and practice provides a stark contrast to the kind of education that
dominates the planet right now, one geared toward high test scores,
decontextualized knowledge, nationalism, and narrow vocationalism.

Conclusion

George Leonard was convinced, back in the 1960’s, that new global conditions
such as the incredible destructive power of new technologies, population
increases, and the compression of time and space called for entirely new
responses, indeed for a new kind of human being. This sort of human would
not be driven by "narrow competition, eager acquisition, and aggression" but
would "spend his (or her) life in the joyful pursuit of learning." The chief
ingredient in the form of education necessary to bring about this new human
being would be "‘ecstasy’: joy, ananda, the ultimate delight" (1968, p.
230). In the last chapter of his book, he acknowledged the fear that we have
about this secret ingredient, and attempted to convince the skeptical reader
that ecstasy is not necessarily opposed to reason, order, or morality. In
fact, he suggests, "ecstasy is education’s most powerful ally. It is
reinforcer for and substance of the moment of learning" (p. 232). "To
affirm, to follow ecstasy in learning, is to move more easily toward an
education, a society that would free the enormous potential of man (sic)"
(p. 234).

Although the Cold War, which was at its height in the 1960’s, is over now,
the times are, if anything, more complex, and every bit as treacherous.
Population is steadily increasing, environmental destruction escalates, wars
and rumors of war abound, consumerism and commercialism have seemingly
conquered the hearts and minds of everyone, and the gap between the rich and
poor persists. The need for a "new kind of human" is as compelling as ever.
Perhaps we have something to learn from the planet’s most ancient tradition
about how to nurture the capacities that will help us develop a peaceful,
healthy, and happy society, a society in which learning is engaged in for
sheer and utter pleasure, and for the genuine welfare of humanity. This is
truly a revolutionary idea—perhaps one whose time has come.
