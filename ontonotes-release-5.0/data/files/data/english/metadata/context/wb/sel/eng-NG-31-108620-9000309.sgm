The following article talks about gravity waves cause by mountains on
Venus.  Absurd!  What are they talking about?  It also talks about
landing, not on the hot hard ground, but on cool soft dense Venus air.
Brilliant!  The expected life of satellite, instead of 12 hours or less,
would be 12 days or more.

Riddle of the day
gravity wave is to ? as landing on air is to ??

Up, Up and Away -- To Venus
Jet Propulsion Laboratory
August 27, 2007

Scientists hope to learn more about climate changes here on Earth by
studying Venus. A prototype balloon could eventually study the planets
surface and examine its atmosphere and the bizarre winds and chemistry
within it. A team of JPL, ILC Dover and NASA Wallops Flight Facility
engineers designed, fabricated and tested the balloon.

Slightly smaller than Earth, Venus is often regarded as Earth's sister
planet. Both have similar densities, chemical compositions and gravities.
However, its atmosphere is nearly 100 times thicker than Earth's, which
causes blazing temperatures at the surface. By flying in the cool skies
above Venus, the balloons would avoid that environment.

&quot;The surface is hot enough to melt lead, which is why we can't study it
for long from a lander,&quot; said Kevin Baines, JPL principal investigator for
a proposed mission to Venus. &quot;Without extreme and costly refrigeration
methods, a lander would cook at those temperatures in just a few hours,
but a balloon can stay in a benign environment, studying the planet for
days, weeks or even months.&quot;

The spherical balloon, 18 feet in diameter, is about the size of an
inflatable children's jumper. Its aluminum coating reflects sunlight to
protect the balloon from becoming too hot as it flies in Venus upper
atmosphere. Its outer transparent layer of the balloon is made of
polytetrafluorethylene, also known as Teflon, the non-stick material found
in cookware and on clothing. The material is highly resistant to the
sulfuric acid found in clouds surrounding Venus. The sun shines through
the Teflon and reflects off the aluminum, and that keeps the balloon from
overheating, said Jeff Hall, JPL's lead balloon engineer.

The balloon's second layer has a mylar film similar to those shiny helium
balloons found in a grocery store. The mylar is used to prevent gas from
leaking out. The next layer is made of a Vectran fabric that provides the
strength to keep the balloon from bursting due to internal pressure. The
innermost layer has a polyurethane coating that enables all sections of
the balloon to be glued together.

More details about the design, fabrication and testing of the balloon are
reported in a paper published in the journal Advances in Space Research..

The proposed mission would have two balloons, one at a tropical latitude,
the other at a polar latitude. Each helium-filled balloon would fly about
56 kilometers (about 35 miles) above Venus' oven-hot surface, in
temperatures about the same as a spring afternoon in Los Angeles. It would
take about four days for the helium superpressure balloons to fly
completely around the planet. After the balloons are launched from Earth,
they would arrive on the night side of Venus.

&quot;The winds at that altitude are very strong, more than 320 kilometers per
hour (about 200 miles an hour), and will blow the balloons around the
planet,&quot; Hall said. &quot;Engineers would not have control of where the
balloons travel. Once the balloon starts flying, it is totally dependent
on the winds.&quot;

Each balloon would have quite a roller coaster ride, moving up and down
about a half a mile in altitude as they ride gravity waves generated by
Venus mountainous terrain.

&quot;This was one of the surprises of the Vega balloon mission the Soviet
Union flew more than two decades ago,&quot; Baines said. &quot;Enormous gravity
waves appear to rise up more than 30 miles into the upper atmosphere,
causing unexpected depositions of energy generated at the surface and
producing strong vertical movements of air. We want to ride these waves,
measuring their effect on Venus' bizarre high-speed winds.&quot;

Scientists believe the Venus balloons could also help us learn more about
climate changes here on Earth. Venus is a place where global warming has
gone amuck, Hall said. Its about the same size as our planet, but the
surface is about 900 degrees Fahrenheit, and we want to find out why.

Scientific instruments aboard the balloons would analyze the composition
of Venus' atmosphere. The pressure cooker atmosphere around Venus quickly
changes and is filled with specific gases, such as helium and neon, which
do not interact chemically with other materials, allowing researchers to
trace the formation of Venus over time. Noble gases can help scientists
determine the geological history of the planet, which could lead to
answers about current climate changes.

&quot;Those gases will tell us if Venus and Earth were twin planets.
Indications from previous missions suggest that Venus and Earth were quite
similar at the beginning,&quot; Baines said.

Various studies indicate Venus once had oceans of water much like those on
Earth, but now the planet is dry. According to Baines, Venus began as an
oasis with conditions favorable for life in its first billion years.
&quot;Venus now has an extreme climate. It changed from being wet and wild, to
dry and dead, and it seems to have happened in the last three billion
years. We'd like to find out how this global transformation happened.&quot;

The current explanation for the dry atmosphere and extremely hot surface
temperature is that Venus does not have a magnetic field to provide
protection from solar winds. Those winds smash into the top of the
atmosphere and drag off hydrogen that is needed for water.

A payload weighing more than 40 kilograms (about 90 pounds) would fly with
each balloon to help transmit data back to Earth. Included in this payload
would be a flight computer, radio transmitter and 9 kilograms (20 pounds)
of electric batteries to power the equipment. Also included is a suite of
science instruments:

o A gas chromatograph mass spectrometer to measure the amounts of gases on
Venus and to sniff for volcanic smoke.

o An atmospheric structure instrument would measure the pressures and
temperatures of the atmosphere and the vertical winds as the balloons bob
up and down. This instrument also includes a nephelometer instrument to
measure the size and density of cloud particles through light reflections.

o A lightning detector to measure the power and frequency of nearby
lightning strikes in the atmosphere.

o A microphone to record any nearby sounds in the atmosphere, including
thunder.

Ground-based radio telescopes using an interferometric technique would be
used to measure how each balloon moves around the atmosphere. &quot;We'd be
able to tell its velocity within one inch per second of movement over an
hour,&quot; Baines said. The telescopes would also use the Doppler effect to
complete a set of 3-D measurements of each balloon's movements.

The company that built the airbags for the Mars Exploration Rover mission,
ILC Dover, Frederica, Del., also helped design and build the balloons. The
balloons are folded into small packages to fit inside the launch rocket
that also include high pressure helium tanks and valves. Once the balloons
reach the planet, the heavy tanks would drop away so the balloon could
float away.

The balloon mission would likely end one of two ways: it might run out of
battery power, when the balloons would be unable to communicate with
ground controllers, or if a balloon develops a leak, it would eventually
lose altitude and overheat the payload until it stops working. Hall and
his team of engineers in JPLs Aerobot laboratory have tested the prototype
and determined it can float for up to 12 days without leaking any helium
gas. A 12-day flight would be long enough to allow the balloons to
circumnavigate the planet three times.

It's called atmosphere and terrain below, that which just so happen to
include the likes of S8 vents, and otherwise because that planetology
of Venus is so newish and alive is also why it's such a proto-Earth
like robust atmosphere.

Good grief, what another pathetic infomercial spewed old joke, with
our warm and fuzzy NASA in full infomercial media damage-control, once
again via hype diverting us away from the truth by simply pretending
at their doing a Venus mission, and with such old file copy tactics
none the less.  However, unlike our moon, at least Venus is
technically doable from the toasty surface on up into those icy cool
though acidic nighttime clouds.

&quot;Enormous gravity waves&quot; ???
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_wave
&quot;In fluid dynamics, gravity waves are waves generated in a fluid
medium or at the interface between two mediums (e.g. the atmosphere or
ocean) which has the restoring force of gravity or buoyancy.&quot;

But otherwise, there's no kidding folks, because of the newish
planetology with all that CO2 as saturated with S8, being so much
hotter near that grothermally active surface, is clearly why there's
such a terrific vertical thermal differential and subsequent velocity,
as well as downright nifty buoyancy to that robust atmosphere.

Instead of going with that silly balloon, a composite rigid airship
would be far better and longer lasting, as well as capable of cruising
extensively to within a few km of that toasty deck.

&quot;It's about the same size as our planet, but the surface is about 900
degrees Fahrenheit, and we want to find out why.&quot;

Much like good old proto-Earth, in places it's clearly much hotter
than in other places.
(think: newish planetology)
(think: much less old than Earth)
Think outside the mainstream status quo box, because there's
sufficient proof of intelligent other life existing/coexisting on
Venus.  There's also insufficient proof that either Venus or Earth fit
within the popular mold of our solar system, and quite possibly either
of us were not originally associated within this solar system because,
it's becoming better understood that rogue planets do exist,
especially those of good volume and mass as having Earth like moons
that survived the demise of their original sun.

BTW, the extremely mountainous terrain of Venus suggest that it once
upon a time had a fairly substantial moon, perhaps exactly like that
moon of ours, as perhaps being the primary reason as to why Venus
remained so extra geothermal from the inside out.  These days, Venus
is cooling off at roughly 20.5 w/m2 (in spite of that insulative
atmosphere, it's losing an impressive 256 fold greater thermal energy
than what Earth is losing).

http://ees.elsevier.com/jasr/
&quot;Advances in Space Research is the Official Journal of the Committee
on Space Research (COSPAR), a Scientific Committee of the
International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU)&quot; is nothing but
another insider journal dump, of self promoting e-published hype at
taxpayers expense, on just about anything you'd care to find.  Peer
reviewed, my ass, as only that which doesn't rock thy good ship
LOLLIPOP is allowed to stick.  Their peer review simply means
revisionism of any kind is forbidden, and nothing gets interconnected,
meaning that each research topic has to be a *stand alone* or all
inclusive item without ties or links to other research (aka: no dot
connecting allowed).

Excellent technical tutoring followed by a plane and simple description
lacking in balcony baloney.  However, they already knew that, that Venus
ballooning is a roller coaster ride.

Now go you sneak up on a pin wheel spider web and blow on his web at the
center where he is, just as if your were a gust of wind.  There he is,
bouncing back and forth at the several body widths stretch of his web
with such rapidity, no human could comparatively stand.  However these
guys have evolved and adapted to such jerky work conditions.

Will JPL be able to package their satellite brains and sensors as well?

They're NOT talking about gravity waves in the sense of those
predicted by the General Theory of Relativity.

Instead, they're using a meteorological term, having to do with
oscillating modes of the atmosphere as a whole or something like that.

To be enormously picky, since Venus rotates and the mountains
contribute to its multipole mass distribution, the mountains actually
*do* help generate GTR gravity waves. Very, very, very, very, very
weak ones of course. And not what the original article was talking
about, as already pointed out.

...which, I think, are usually referred to as _gravitational_ waves to help

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there in them thar robust and acidic clouds.  Therefore, why not a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; composite rigid airship and cruise extensively and efficiently well
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; below them thar acidic clouds?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Let's get married at Venus Hotel where we and the guests can over look
&gt; &gt; &gt; Venus during the ceremony.  Afterwards for our honey moon, we'll ride the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Air Venus roller coaster, none better in all the solar system.

&gt; &gt; Other than the getting married part, you're on.

&gt; Bring your own and we'll make it the fearful foursome.

&gt; &gt; How about we first get POOF City at VL2 up and running, as our cool
&gt; &gt; outpost/gateway safe home away from home? - Brad Guth

&gt; Will Poof be a sovereign nation?

You bet, sovereign as hell.  If China or Russia helps in establishing
VL2 POOF City, guess what?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; BTW, what do you call citizens of Luna City?
">

Lunatics

Of course, since the moon is somewhat salty and having that relatively
low density core, almost anything is possible.  Could be a little
hollow in places and populated with a swarm of those pesky Muslim
Lunatics.
