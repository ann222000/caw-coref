I bought a mosin negant carbine during one of the first clinton gun
scares . It has outside barrel erosion and i dont want to fire it to
much . Numrich arms hase a barrel for about 40$ and id like to learn
more about gunsmithing by changin the barrel. How do i get the old
barrel off? Does it have an interferance fit or is it silversoldered
tight? Is it just screwed on?

The barrel screws into the receiver, but it is more complicated job
than you might think.

You will need at least two tools: an action wrench and a barrel vise.
The barrel vise (or its insert ring) must be made specifically to fit
the taper of the Mosin barrel.  The action wrench can be the same
wrench that you would use on a Mauser or Springfield.  You will also
need powdered rosin for gripping the barrel in the vise.

Do not use a pipe wrench on the barrel.  Do not insert a screwdriver
or bar through the rails on the receiver.  If you try either of these
things, you wil likely wreck the gun.

Also, do not assume that you can simply screw the new barrel into the
old receiver.  You will need to check the head space, and for that job
you will need a depth micrometer.  If the headspace is deficient, you
will have to ream the chamber.  If it is excessive, you will have to
relieve the shoulder and perhaps the bolt face.  Unless the head space
is exact, you will need a chambering reamer, a lathe, or both.

Furthermore, the chances that the threads on your new barrel will be
timed correctly for your receiver are very slim.  If you need to
retime the barrel, then you'll probably need both a lathe and a
chambering reamer.

And when you are done, you'll still be stuck with a Mosin.

Unless you've already got the equipment and know-how, it ain't worth
it.

I can see the problem with the receiver rails, but the barrel?

A set of headspace gauges alone will set the O.P. back almost the cost
of another gun.  Action wrench and barrel vise can be made given
tooling and welding equipment, there's plans in some of the classic
gunsmithing books, no substitute for a lathe, though.  Look for a
better example and save the current one for spare parts.  Big 5
normally sells them for $80 or so around here on sale.  And when all
is said and done, the O.P'll still only have a Moisin-Nagant...  The
cheap ammo is going fast for those, too, about 60 cents per round at
this last show.
