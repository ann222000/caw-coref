*Introducing the Hardy Heron*

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; *August 29th, 2007*

&gt; I am delighted to have the pleasure of announcing the *Hardy Heron* (*Ubuntu
&gt; 8.04*), the next version of Ubuntu that will succeed Gutsy Gibbon (Ubuntu
&gt; 7.10, due for release in October 2007). Not only will the Ubuntu community
&gt; continue to do what it does best, produce an easy-to-use, reliable, free
&gt; software platform, but* this release will proudly wear the badge of Long
&gt; Term Support (LTS)* and be supported with security updates for five years
&gt; on the server and three years on the desktop. We look forward to releasing
&gt; the Hardy Heron in April 2008.

&gt; With the opening of each new release cycle of Ubuntu, we have more and
&gt; more opportunity at our fingertips. Not only are our friends in the upstream
&gt; world constantly innovating and extending their applications and software,
&gt; but the Ubuntu community continues to see incredible growth in its diverse
&gt; range of areas such as packaging, development, documentation, quality
&gt; assurance, translations, LoCo teams and more. Each new release gives us all
&gt; an opportunity to shine, irrespective of which bricks in the project we are
&gt; laying, and this is at the heart of our belief - working together to produce
&gt; an Operating System that will empower its users and shape the IT industry,
&gt; putting free software at the corner-stone of our direction.

&gt; Most people only ever see the end-user view of Ubuntu, running it on their
&gt; desktops, servers and mobile devices around the world. For these users,
&gt; Ubuntu provides a simple, convenient means to do what they want to do
&gt; easily, effectively and without unnecessary complexity. For many of us
&gt; though, we want to open up the hood and understand how the system works and
&gt; how to extend and grow it. Thousands of us get out of bed every day, united
&gt; behind Ubuntu, ready to make a difference, working together to make our
&gt; vision happen.

&gt; Importantly, our ethos of collaboration and freedom extends to the
&gt; development process as well as the end product. As such, the Ubuntu
&gt; development process is a very open, transparent one, and anyone is welcome
&gt; to get involved. It works like this:

&gt;    - Everyone is welcome to think of and develop ideas for features
&gt;    that could be present in the Hardy Heron release. These ideas are written as
&gt;    specifications (detailed documents outlining how the idea would work and be
&gt;    implemented). You are welcome to add your specifications to
&gt; https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu .
&gt;    - In October 2007, we will hold the Ubuntu Developer Summit in
&gt;    Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA and generate a schedule of sessions to discuss
&gt;    these specifications. The sessions provide a means for interested parties to
&gt;    help scope out the proposed feature and determine methods and plans to
&gt;    implement it. The Ubuntu Developer Summit is a semi-virtual event in which
&gt;    those who cannot attend can dial in with VoIP and use IRC and collaborative
&gt;    editing with Gobby to take part in the summit.

&gt; Everyone is welcome to participate, everyone is welcome to get involved,
&gt; and everyone is welcome to help shape the form of the Hardy Heron. Let's
&gt; work together to shake things up, make things happen and make the most
&gt; compelling Ubuntu release yet. Start your engines…
