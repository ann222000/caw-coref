&quot;Chris Woolard, head of finance, economics and strategy of the BBC Trust
unit, said: &quot;It is a consumer issue. The BBC could launch a four hour
overnight service straight away and people will go out and buy an HD box.
The danger is that following switchover the technology will become redundant
in a digital box depending on where when digital switchover happens where
you live,&quot;&quot;

But it's perfectly fine for the BBC to promote DAB and for the BBC
Controller in charge of DAB to go on Radio 4 Feedback and lie that DAB
&quot;isn't in danger of becoming obsolete technology&quot; when in fact it most
definitely bloody is going to be made obsolete!

This Nanny bloody State. What a pathetic country we live in. You can't have
HD because you can't be trusted to have a brain bigger than the size of a
pea because you can't manage your own finances and you won't be able to
figure out whether you can afford more than one HD box.

I HATE ALL BROADCASTERS! They are the most idiotic bunch of clueless fools
you could ever home to come across.

The BBC web site spins it differently...

BBC backs HD television service

The BBC Trust has given its provisional backing to the establishment
of a high definition television (HDTV) channel. After a series of
assessments, the body concluded a BBC HDTV channel would offer &quot;high
public value&quot; and cause minimal adverse impact on the market.

However, the channel may be delayed on Freeview to save audiences from
having to buy two new set-top boxes.

The Trust will now consult the public on the proposals before
publishing its final conclusions on 21 November. An HD service has
been proposed for satellite, cable, Freeview and the internet.

Freeview trial
The channel's schedule is expected to draw on programmes from across
the BBC's stations and will not be a replication of BBC One. A trial
version is already running on satellite and cable, and should be
provided on a continuing basis when a service licence is granted, the
trust proposed.

A four-hour service could launch &quot;almost immediately&quot; on Freeview, but
the trust said it is to consult the public on this. Viewers would need
to buy a new set-top box to receive the channel - but, because of
proposed changes in the way Freeview is broadcast, they may have to
upgrade their equipment again when the full, nine-hour service becomes
available.

Proposals about the delivery of a full schedule on Freeview will be
reviewed early next year. The service will be assessed during the
public consultation period, which has already started and will run
until 23 October. The BBC began trialling HDTV last year with the
broadcast of Planet Earth and Bleak House in the format.

A trial of the system using Freeview boxes in November 2006 was deemed
&quot;a success&quot; by four major broadcasters. Channel 4 recently announced
that its output would be made available in HD to users with a
compatible TV set and Sky HD box.

But only programmes which are recorded in HD will be broadcast using
the format.

...snip...

There is also the interesting discussion as to which is better:

1. Delay and then everyone will have SD Freeview and there will be lots of
boxes that need to be replaced when HD starts

2. Go-for-it and then although existing users won't get HD, new users might
actually buy HD-ready Freeview boxes.

The suspicious git in me says &quot;HD boxes will be more expensive and there
will be wailing and nashing of teeth during DSO when people realise they
have to buy a 100UKP HD-ready box (say) and not a 30UKP SD box&quot;. Â But when
HD is offered as an &quot;upgrade&quot; later, people will get conned into spending
the 100UKP anyway.

or as I read it

3. The technical specification for the HD delivery will change in a couple
of years so people buying an HD box now would be forced to buy a new one in
2 years time.

And an HD set-top box would NOT be obsolete come digital switchover, because
it would be just the same as any other MPEG-2-only set-top box, so it won't
be able to receive HD channels, but it will be able to receive the SD
channels. So unless they're going to label ALL Freeview boxes in the shops
as being &quot;obsolete after 2012&quot; then they're talking out of their arses.

When I saw the professions of the people on the BBC Trust I knew they'd
screw up all technical stuff, because there are ZERO technical people on the
BBC Trust, and they're ALL bloody media luvvies and lawyers and other people
who think they understand technical issues (oh, we're so clever, we can
understand anything the geeks can do), but the people who decided to adopt
DAB were also the exact same kind of non-technical know-nothings, and they
just thought it would be fine to launch a digital radio system that was
designed in the mid sodding 80s and everything would just be hunky dory. And
now look where that is. Clueless idiots.

They'll be referring to DVB-T2, which as a standard hasn't been completed
yet but it's going to be used to enable HD on DTT. And the HD DTT boxes you
can buy today just support MPEG-4 video.

Have they not heard of sticky things called labels? You normally put them on
boxes to tell people something or other, like BUY ONE GET ONE FREE. I used
to work at a supermarket many years ago, and that label normally gets
noticed, so why the fk they can't put a label on an HD DTT set-top box
saying that it won't be able to receive HD after DSO God only knows.

It's five years until digital switchover will be completed. It's ridiculous.

If they're going to broadcast HD to regions that have switched over then
that would be different, but they've not said that, and Ofcom has said that
we're not going to get it until 2012, so I think they're just Nannying us
all again.

And the Internet!!!!! Only yesterday I was saying that we'd get BBC HD via
the Internet by the end of the decade, and I got a whole host of people
telling me how fking wrong I was and that superfast broadband will take
50-100 years to become widespread. Luddite fools.

Meanwhile in 1964 things could have been a whole lot worse if we had
listened to the so called experts back then!

&quot;The Sub-Group had before it considerable evidence of trials and experiments
undertaken by Administrations and by members of the European Broadcasting
Union and by the Radio industry. These results covered all aspects of a
public colour television service-the design of studio equipment-magnetic
tape recorders-radio transmitters-problems of propagation-and receivers. The
delegates also had the opportunity to participate in a number of
demonstrations of the three systems. N.T.S.C., SECAM and PAL. &quot;

&quot;The view of United Kingdom experts, as endorsed by the Television Advisory
Committee, is that, taking all factors into account, the N.T.S.C. system is
better than the other two systems. The United Kingdom delegation at the CCIR
meeting, therefore, pressed for its adoption. However, the majority of the
European Administrations represented at the meeting felt they needed time
for further study of the problem.&quot;

&quot; The future policy to be adopted in this country will now be reviewed in
the light of these discussions; the Television Advisory Committee, on which
the broadcasting authorities, the radio industry and Government Departments
are represented, are to meet in March to formulate their advice to the
Postmaster General.&quot;

doesnt that really depend on your pov, since the NTSC adoptees are
streets ahead on the HD takeup front, and this whole debate probably
wouldnt even be happening had some sensible soul said back then hey
lets adopt the same standard, as the technology we'd be using could
then be universal.

but no we'd far rather we had to contend with all that PAL speed up
nonsense, and our half written non-adopted standards that render the
technology useless in a few years, thats a much more a British
solution.

So what are you trying to say then? Let the execs make the decisions
regarding technology adoption? We've got DAB due to that. So justify that
minuscule blunder.

Also, how do you know that the engineers preferring NTSC hadn't been told to
prefer that by their bosses? I've seen a few BBC &quot;engineers&quot; who sold out
over DAB (and got their promotions in return) and said how good it was,
despite the fact that it is the most incompetently designed piece of shit of
a system imaginable.

Another example of what you laughably seem to prefer is that the UK is the
only country I'm aware of using 2K mode DVB-T. And we chose to go ahead with
2K despite 8K chips coming out just a few months later. Care to justify that
little governmental fuckup? No SFNs for the UK, oh no, not with 2K. Just all
the joys of impulsive interference and a 7 microseconds guard interval that
means reception screws up when there's multipaths that are delayed longer
than 7 microseconds relative to the first multipath (not far in terms of
time of flight).

The broadcasting engineers seem to make bad enough decisions as it is half
the time, without you wanting to bypass them altogether and allow the
technically incompetent executives to make all the decisions instead!!! Get
a grip.

Did you miss the point of my a post? because what I was pointing out was
that if the powers that be at that time had gone along with the wishes of
the then 'experts' at the GPO, we could well have been saddled with a NTSC
405 line system on VHF.. Â In which case why do you feel that that would have
been a better system to adopt rather than the PAL 625 line alternative
chosen by the rest of Europe?

I have to say that I've done a reasonable amount of work over the years for
Americans resident in this country, I've also had friends who have lived and
worked in the states and have to say that the general consensus always

superior to what they've been used to watching in the U.S.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is also the interesting discussion as to which is better:

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Delay and then everyone will have SD Freeview and there will be
&gt;&gt;&gt; lots of boxes that need to be replaced when HD starts

&gt;&gt; or as I read it

&gt;&gt; 3. The technical specification for the HD delivery will change in a
&gt;&gt; couple of years so people buying an HD box now would be forced to buy
&gt;&gt; a new one in 2 years time.

&gt;They'll be referring to DVB-T2, which as a standard hasn't been completed
&gt;yet but it's going to be used to enable HD on DTT. And the HD DTT boxes you
&gt;can buy today just support MPEG-4 video.

&gt;Have they not heard of sticky things called labels? You normally put them on
&gt;boxes to tell people something or other, like BUY ONE GET ONE FREE. I used
&gt;to work at a supermarket many years ago, and that label normally gets

The so-called &quot;PAL speed up problem&quot; is nothing to do with PAL. It is
simply an incompatibility between the frame rates of cinema films and

I expect that a 24 fps TV system would suffer from interference from the
50Hz mains, at least it would have in those days.

Nowadays it would be easy to repeat a frame every 24 frames of film, or do a
more complicated interpolation.

It could even be done mechanically with a conventional film-to-video
machine - after all, the Yanks must repeat every fourth frame to convert
from 24 to 30 fps.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/broadcastnowArticle.aspx?intStoryID=171339

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Chris Woolard, head of finance, economics and strategy of the BBC
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Trust unit, said: &quot;It is a consumer issue. The BBC could launch a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; four hour overnight service straight away and people will go out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and buy an HD box. The danger is that following switchover the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; technology will become redundant in a digital box depending on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where when digital switchover happens where you live,&quot;&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And an HD set-top box would NOT be obsolete come digital
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; switchover, because it would be just the same as any other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MPEG-2-only set-top box, so it won't be able to receive HD
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; channels, but it will be able to receive the SD channels. So
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unless they're going to label ALL Freeview boxes in the shops as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being &quot;obsolete after 2012&quot; then they're talking out of their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arses. When I saw the professions of the people on the BBC Trust I knew
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they'd screw up all technical stuff, because there are ZERO
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; technical people on the BBC Trust, and they're ALL bloody media
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; luvvies and lawyers and other people who think they understand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; technical issues (oh, we're so clever, we can understand anything
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the geeks can do), but the people who decided to adopt DAB were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also the exact same kind of non-technical know-nothings, and they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just thought it would be fine to launch a digital radio system
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that was designed in the mid sodding 80s and everything would just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be hunky dory. And now look where that is. Clueless idiots.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Meanwhile in 1964 things could have been a whole lot worse if we had
&gt;&gt;&gt; listened to the so called experts back then!

&gt;&gt; So what are you trying to say then? Let the execs make the decisions
&gt;&gt; regarding technology adoption? We've got DAB due to that. So justify
&gt;&gt; that minuscule blunder.

&gt;&gt; Also, how do you know that the engineers preferring NTSC hadn't been
&gt;&gt; told to prefer that by their bosses? I've seen a few BBC &quot;engineers&quot;
&gt;&gt; who sold out over DAB (and got their promotions in return) and said
&gt;&gt; how good it was, despite the fact that it is the most incompetently
&gt;&gt; designed piece of shit of a system imaginable.

&gt;&gt; Another example of what you laughably seem to prefer is that the UK
&gt;&gt; is the only country I'm aware of using 2K mode DVB-T. And we chose
&gt;&gt; to go ahead with 2K despite 8K chips coming out just a few months

Yes, I knew that you were making the point that the experts were proposing

that I knew what you meant.

I don't think it would look very good at all compared with 625-line
PAL on a 1980s or later TV.

Nominally 503x377 line resolution, but ...

&quot;The subcarrier frequency was 2.6578125 MHz (525/2 times line
frequency) with an &quot;I&quot; signal bandwidth of 500 kHz and a &quot;Q&quot; signal
bandwidth of 300 kHz.&quot;

(quoting wikipedia 405-line article, but I think it's copied from a
more authoritative source)

So without comb filters and the like, that's a ~2MHz useable luma
bandwidth. So if modern PAL composite TV with crude colour decoding is
equivalent to about 426x576, you're looking at about 320x377 for 405-
line colour.

That's like the little videos you get from mobile phones and still

(all calculations very approximate, but good enough to show the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The Sub-Group had before it considerable evidence of trials and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experiments undertaken by Administrations and by members of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; European Broadcasting Union and by the Radio industry. These

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; receivers. The delegates also had the opportunity to participate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a number of demonstrations of the three systems. N.T.S.C.,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SECAM and PAL. &quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesnt that really depend on your pov, since the NTSC adoptees are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; streets ahead on the HD takeup front, and this whole debate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probably wouldnt even be happening had some sensible soul said
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back then hey lets adopt the same standard, as the technology we'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be using could then be universal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but no we'd far rather we had to contend with all that PAL speed up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nonsense, and our half written non-adopted standards that render
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the technology useless in a few years, thats a much more a British
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solution.

&gt;&gt;&gt; NTSC adoptees are probably streets ahead on the HD takeup front
&gt;&gt;&gt; because NTSC is so awful.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Many many Â 625 PAL viewers are quite happy with their picture, so
&gt;&gt;&gt; the incentive to invest in HD is minimal.

&gt;&gt; http://media.guardian.co.uk/mediaguardian/story/0,,2175441,00.html

&gt;&gt; &quot;And despite the limited number of high-def services available today
&gt;&gt; (between them Sky and Virgin count around 450,000 HD subscribers),
&gt;&gt; analysts at the market research group GfK estimate that more than 5m
&gt;&gt; high-def television sets are already in British homes.&quot;

&gt; Almost everyone buying a decent widescreen TV is buying an HD TV, but
&gt; by your cite over 4,550,000 of these HD TVs aren't being used as HD
&gt; TVs but as widescreen 625 line satellite, Freeview or DVD receivers.
">

450,000 subscribers to HD in the first 15 months or so of operation is
absolutely phenomenal when you consider that people have to pay Â£300 for the
Sky HD receiver and a Â£10 per month subscription.

New technologies typically start off with low sales (they have to start from
zero sales, obviously) and then the sales curve accelerates over time until
the product reaches the mainstream and ownership is high and so on. 450,000
subscribers in the first 15 or so months is amazing - nearly 2% of all
households have it already.

I reckon that if HDTV is broadcast on Freeview then HDTV could actually beat
DVD, which is the current fastest-selling consumer electronics product of
all time. So if you don't think that is impressive, then nothing would
impress you. If there was capacity to launch the BBC HD channel for the same
9 hours or whatever it'll be on satellite and cable, I've absolutely no
doubt it would go on to beat DVD, but as it's only a 4-hour service late at
night there is a bit of doubt, but I still think a lot of people will buy HD
DTT boxes - assuming the BBC Trust doesn't go ahead with its laughable
suggestion to delay BBC HD on Freeview until 2012 and provide a free nappy
with each TV Licence.

I disagree with you Steve - with your comments in this post, and
others you've made in this thread. Clearly a different approach is
being used for this compared with the DAB debacle, and that is to be
welcomed.

It would be all too easy for the BBC to repeat the mistake of DAB with
HD on DTT. They are quite desperate to launch HD on DTT - it's their
favourite platform, after all. They could close their eyes, and jump
in with whatever technology is available to them immediately, suitable
or not - rather like they did with DAB.

However, they're going into this with their eyes open this time. HD on
DTT, given the SD muxes currently viewed in ~8 million homes, is not
trivial to implement. OfCom have been making some optimistic(!)
proposals recently, while the BBC, ITV, and CH4 clearly anticipate
considerable consumer (advertiser?) demand for HD in the coming year.

The BBC trust has been 100% honest and open about this one. They have
also (cleverly, in my view) put the ball back into OfCom's court.

In the meantime, BBC HD on DSat is going ahead, free-to-air. ITV have
announced the same for next year. CH4 have announced FTV HD before the
end of this year! None of them are crippling or delaying the DSat
service because of the problems on DTT.

This is all good news.

It's not great news for Freeview, but how often have people on here
stated that to get the best free-to-air content does, or will, mean
getting a dish (sometimes in addition to Freeview or the internet)?

Digital radio - get DSat, not DAB (where the quality is lower)
BBCi streams - get DSat, not DTT (where most streams are missing)
HD - get DSat, not DTT (where you'll have to wait for a reduced
service / wait longer for a full service)

There's no comment on whether the FTA HD services on DSat will be DVB-
S or DVB-S2. If they stay DVB-S, then the cost of trying a crude HD
PVR is very low: dish, PC card, transcode to &quot;easier&quot; format if
necessary to watch stream on older hardware.

I agree that it is very important that they put a massive sticker on the box
or on point-of-sale material in shops or on online retailers' web pages
saying that any HD DTT boxes won't be able to receive HD post-DSO, but I'm
just completely against them nannying us in the way that they're proposing,
because they're basically saying that we can't be trusted to make an
informed decision about whether we want to buy an HD DTT box in full
knowledge that it won't be able to receive HD post-DSO.

They're basically stopping people from watching HD on Freeview just because
some people are thick, and they shouldn't do that. I'm tired of the
ultra-conservative decisions the broadcasteres and the regulators take.

My reference to DAB was about the fact that non-upgradeable DAB radios being
sold in the shops today is analogous to HD DTT boxes being sold, because
come the day when DAB+ stations are launched (and I believe that'll be
within 3 years from now) non-upgradeable DAB radios won't be able to receive
these stations. The only difference is that MP2 stations on DAB probably
won't be withdrawn for a few years after that, but people like James
Cridland have mentioned that some stations might be withdrawn to allow DAB+
stations to launch, and if that does happen then HD DTT boxes being sold
today and non-upgradeable DAB radios being sold today are directly
analogous, because in both cases channels that are currently receivable on
these receivers won't be receivable in the future.

But if they make it clear that HD DTT boxes won't be able to receive HD
post-DSO then I don't see what the problem is. HD should definitely change
to using DVB-T2 post-DSO, because that looks like the only way we're going
to get a range of channels. It's fair for them to consider the situation,
but if they go ahead and delay launching the BBC HD channel for five years
that will be Nanny Stating it to the max, IMO.

These HD DTT boxes would still be able to receive SD MPEG-2 channels, so the
vast majority of them would simply be reduced to being used on 2nd sets, so
it's not as if they're going to be completely obsolete either.

I think there are HD DTT boxes available - I think France is already
broadcasting HD on DTT, so there must be receivers available to buy. The HD
DTT trials were successful, so I think the technology bit is done and dusted

What has Ofcom been saying? Did you watch that webcast I gave a link to in
another thread? I felt everything Philip Rutnam said about spectrum and so
on was perfectly reasonable, although I'm not sure how many multiplexes it's
planned will use DVB-T2 and whether DVB-T2 signals are backwardly compatible
or not - i.e. whether you can broadcast a DVB-T2 multiplex which includes SD
channels that are still receivable on non-HD boxes. How many multiplexes
will use DVB-T2 is pretty crucial to the amount of extra capacity on
Freeview, and if it's only 1 or 2 muxes then Ofcom probably is being
optimistic and they'll probably be squeezing the SD channel bit rates to
achieve what they're claiming can be achieved - i.e. 4 HD channels
universally available.

HD on satellite is good news, but they shouldn't stop people from watching

The FTA HD satellite receivers support DVB-S2 anyway, such as this one:

http://www.hisat.com/proddetail.php?prod=RECHDCI2000

And I think the BBC HD channel is already using DVB-S2. I might be wrong,
but I think some PC cards support DVB-S2 as well.

Anyway, one thing that's not been discussed on this thread is that the BBC
HD channel will also be available via the Internet, which is IMO the best
possible news in terms of the future audio quality of the BBC's digital
radio stations, because if they're going to provide an 8-10 Mbps live HD
stream then I'd love to hear their justification for not providing 192 kbps
AAC streams for all of their music radio stations!

Why convert at all? Many of the problems with moving picture systems only occur
when trying to convert from one to another. Nowadays it would be possible to
make TV sets that could easily cope with transmitted frame rates that were
different for different programmes. Modern computer monitors do it without any
problems, and my TV set and DVD player can show either 525/60 or 625/50
material without my having to do anything. There would of course be an immense
logistical problem implementing something like this on a service already in use
with millions of existing TV sets, but we managed to change from 405 to 625
lines over about 20 years, so it's not impossible. A 48Hz frame rate would
hardly require any modification to existing European TV sets, and many might be
able to handle it with no modification at all.

Digital switchover is *5 years* away from being completed, so I would need a
much stronger argument than &quot;oh, it's a bit confusing&quot; to convince me that
people shouldn't be allowed to watch HDTV just because some people can't
read labels.

Also, *none* of the HD DTT boxes would actually be completely obsolete,
because they'd be able to receive SD channels without any problems
whatsoever. *IF* HD DTT boxes would be made completely obsolete post-DSO
then that would be a different matter altogether, but that's not the case.

I could wish that there was legislation to require that analogue-only
equipment had labels warning that an STB would be required come the
Switchover, but it seems that the government is resistant to this.
Apparently, warning-label legislation is notoriously expensive,
difficult to compose and difficult to police.

And it would be difficult to persuade retailers to stock relatively
expensive HD PVRs with a label on them saying that they'll stop
receiving HD in a few years time. Â Retailers know that most people

&gt;&gt; They should put a label on HD DTT boxes and let the consumers decide.

&gt; I could wish that there was legislation to require that analogue-only

Actually, you provide a good example for why it's not such a big deal,
because they've been selling video and DVD recorders that don't have a
digital tuner inside them without sticking labels on, so why do you want to
stop selling HD DTT boxes assuming they do have a label on them?

At the end of the day I think they should have some respect for the public
and assume that the vast majority of people don't need to be nannied. I'm
not disputing that some people would fall through the safety net, but it's
not a good enough reason to penalise the vast majority just because of a few
idiots that can't read a label.

Believe me, if it's between stocking a product that says a bit of it won't
work post-DSO and not being able to sell *any* HD DTT boxes until 2012, I
*know* what Dixons et al would say, and it ain't &quot;sorry, we don't want to
make any profit, thanks&quot; - and they get to sell a whole load of extra boxes

The only interesting bit is only on for 15 minutes or so, which is about
spectrum. It starts about 35 minutes in with a balding bloke speaking. The
last hour is boring, and the only thing they said about radio of any
interest was that &quot;DAB+ is clearly a potential evolution of the platform in
due course. Really it's analogous to the kind of thing we were talking about
earlier in relation to DTT.&quot; and that they repeated that there will be
reviews for considering when to set the switch off date for FM and AM in
2012 and 2009 respectively. I didn't watch the first half hour which is
about Ofcom's public service broadcasting review, so if you're not
interested in that there's only about 15 minutes or so plus the Q&amp;A after
that to watch of any interest.

Agreed. But even though I completely agree that Freeview isn't good enough
to carry HD, I still think people who've got it should be allowed to watch

satellite and the Internet will be the number of channels available in HD,
IMO, because Freeview will always be limited whereas you could envisage that
there would be loads of HD channels on Freesat and on the net.

Yeah, ITV1 and C4 HD won't make it onto Freeview until post-DSO. But it's 5
years of not being able to watch HD at all if the BBC Trust didn't allow the

people cannot get satellite. Then again, you could say that they could watch
HD via the Internet, so I suppose thinking about it that way it's not quite

I'm pretty certain that's not what they've said - in fact, this is a

So, they're not saying they want to delay until DSO, but merely until
there is dual mode equipment, if that's in 2009. So that's 2 years,
not five.

But definitely worth responding to the question about this on their
web site, if you feel strongly.

That improves things a bit. But I'm still in favour of it launching
immediately, because I don't see why we should have to wait 2 years for it.
And saying that DVB-T2 receivers should be available by the end of 2009 has
a high risk involved that that will actually be stuck to, because they only
issued a call for technologies for DVB-T2 in April:

http://www.dvb.org/news_events/news/dvbt2_commercial_requirem/index.xml

So the specification itself is nowhere near being finished, then it's got to
go through ETSI, then they've got to design the chips and design the
receivers, then it's got to be trialed - all in 2 years? I doubt that. It
took WorldDAB a year to add AAC+ and RS coding to an existing specification,
whereas DVB-T2 sounds like it's a pretty major overhaul of the system to
squeeze every last drop out of it. I was told in November last year by
someone that works for the leading DAB chipset design company that the vast
majority of receivers in the shops would support DAB+ by the end of this
year. So far there's 2 clock radios and a tuner out of about 300 DAB
products.

At the end of the day, you're going to have a working Freeview receiver once
the DVB-T2 kit comes out, and you can use that for a second set or sell it
or whatever. You're talking about spending an extra Â£30 say for about 2 or
probably more years' of being able to watch HD, which is not going to break
the bank.

The document also clears up a few other things, such as that DVB-T and
DVB-T2 cannot be mixed on the same multiplex, and that it's envisaged that
there will be a single HD multiplex, so that fixes the bit rate level for
the 4 HD channels that Ofcom is proposing could be broadcast nationwide - 24
Mbps for 64-QAM multiplied by 1.3 for the 30% DVB-T2 increase in capacity,
divided by 4 = 7.8 Mbps, so some people won't be happy at that bit rate
level, unless they manage to increase the capacity by more than the 30% DVB
have suggested. That's going to be a squeeze considering that they're using
16 - 20 Mbps for HD at the moment, or they'd better improve the H.264 codecs
pretty sharpish...

Here's some quotes from Ofcom's webcast:

http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/asx/briefing190907.asx

&quot;Better use of this 256 MHz will allow HD services to be carried on the DTT
platform at switchover.&quot;

&quot;Essentially, that 256 MHz will become a lot more usable at switchover&quot;

&quot;There will be a major increase in the capacity of the DTT platform at
switchover&quot;

&quot;And our analysis has shown that we think that *come the completion of
switchover in 2012* there should be the capacity to carry 4 HD services
across the entire country, universal availability with no reduction in the
number of other services or any need for extra spectrum.&quot;

So if you buy an HD DTT box now, you'd get 5 years of use out of it before
it became a standard Freeview receiver, so the BBC Trust document is wrong,
because they're making out that people will have to buy another HD box in a
couple of years' time once DVB-T2 comes out, which is incorrect - or at best
what they're saying is ambiguous.

Now, what implications has this for the License Fee structure?

I've been informed that HD-TV is so high-quality that early
shows had to be canned because the brush-strokes used during
make-up were so obvious they stood out like mortar plastered
on with a trowel. So the BBC has now developed a new approach
to make-up, which presumably cost money, which comes from
those who pay the license fee.

So this means I'm going to have to buy a subscription package
in order to appreciate such leaps in beauty technique?

I doubt it. It means what it says. And until there is a real
standard for effective auto rescanning with persistent custom
channel name retention the idea that people are going to be
going and buying any kind of box, setting it up, and will then
be able to just leave it alone is laughable and comes from
straight from planet Aerial.

Any movement on whether and when a full BBCi service will be
available in tandem with their digital terrestrial freeview
radio station provision? A generic screen that gets called
up by BBCi, when BBCi is being called up, without interfering
with the audio-in feed is all that would be required SFAICT.

But yes, it sounds daft on the face of it. By &quot;redundant&quot; do
they mean that some areas will switch over to only HD signals
and people will then be buying HD sets with digital tuners in?

So how are the people who buy an HD TV for cable/satellite at
this point and hook it up to an HD Freeview box going to lose
out? To me &quot;redundant&quot; means you will simply no longer need
the box and can keep it in the attic for use with an old set
and SCART VCR in the event your brand spanking new HD telly
breaks dow, gets robbed, or is damaged in a flood.

Or does redundant mean you'll still need to use it but just
on less favourable contractual terms than previously?

PS - am really looking forward to amateur porno in HD resolution.

&gt; 405 NTSC looked good, I saw the last of the demo broadcasts on my first
&gt; day at TVC. Â The idea of adding colour to the existing service had its
&gt; merits.
">

For me, a big advantage of launching 405 line NTSC colour would have been
that I could have grown up with colour television instead of black and
white. ITV were keen to launch colour as soon as it had taken off in the US,
and would have done if they had been granted permission.

If they had done so, BBC tv would have had to follow suit, and we might
never have changed to 625 lines at all. But this could have had some big
advantages. With no duplication of transmitter networks, and channels of
only 5 MHz bandwidth instead of 8 MHz, there would have been far more space
available for extra channels on UHF, enough for 4 more analogue channels in
addition to BBC2 and Channel 4, without even thinking about the additional
space that was eventually found for five analogue. Sky Channel might have
launched on terrestrial in 1986 instead of having to use satellite
distribution.

The only real drawback of 405 lines was visibility of line structure, and to
combat this we might have become pioneers in &quot;line doubling&quot; long before the
era of the &quot;100 Hz TV&quot; (which also uses a form of line doubling). From the
late 1980's, British sets could Â have been displaying 810 lines instead of
405.

Had we stuck with 405 colour we could have adopted comb filter decoders,
using the &quot;PAL&quot; delay line to increase the luminance bandwidth instead of
it's normal function. We would also have had the highest resolution VHS
recordings anywhere in the world, as the limited bandwidth of VHS provides
50% sharper horizontal resolution on 405 compared with the 525 or 625 line
systems it is normally used with.

In today's era of undercutting bitrates, a digital 405 line system would, in
some cases, provide a better trade off between vertical and horizontal
resolution on low bitrate channels.

An interesting speculation, but I'm not sure. My understanding is that
Television Centre was being planned in the 1950s at around the same time
as the experimental colour transmissions, and it was always planned to
have two presentation suites so that it could handle two national
channels. I think the decision was taken at an early stage that the second
channel would be 625/50 in order to be compatible with Europe.

When my family got its first 625 TV set, the most pleasant thing I
remember about it was the disappearance of the horrible high pitched
screeching noise tha talways happened with 405. Now it was much higher
pitched, and although still audible, not nearly so annoying. Even if we
had stuck with 405 lines, the invention of flat panel displays would
eventually have got rid of the noise, but several generations would have
had to endure it first.

The decision to use 625/50 for BBC2 was not taken until July 1962,
following the report of the Pilkington Committee.

However, if you heard it for long enough, as I did at tv centre, your brain
developed a 'knotch filter' and you stopped hearing it. Â Once 405 stopped
being used your hearing returned to normal, as I discovered when having to
deal with some archive material ;-)

&gt;&gt; We are talking about HD here, so it should be much better quality.

&gt; Yeah, like DAB and Freeview!

&gt; I won't hold my breath.

The resolution of standard-definition TV is usually 720x576, so there's
414,720 pixels that make up a picture. The format they're using in the UK
for HD uses 1440x1080, so the number of pixels that make up a picture is
1,555,200, which equates to 3.75 times as many pixels. So HD *should be* a
lot sharper than SD.

Whether they squeeze the bit rates to such an extent that there's loads of
artefacts remains to be seen, but at the moment they *are* using
sufficiently high bit rate levels:

http://www.digitalradiotech.co.uk/uk_satellite_bit_rates.php

So hopefully they'll continue using sufficient bit rate levels - if you use
Freeview, basically you need to keep your fingers very tightly crossed that
the video codec developers manage to improve performance *a lot* compared to
what it's like at the moment, because we're probably looking at bit rate
levels of the order of 8 Mbps being used for HD on Freeview. It is possible
that they will improve the performance of H.264 a lot relative to today,
because it's a brand new codec, but whether they can double its performance
is a bit questionable.

If you want free-to-air HD at good quality you'd be better off getting
Freesat, because there's nothing like the pressure on bit rates that there
is on Freeview.

I don't believe that, since make-up artists would have to allow for big
close-ups, where any coarse brush-strokes would be obvious even in SD.

Actors/actresses should be more worried by what make-up cannot hide.

Well, I'll agree with that, but I wouldn't waste Freeview's limited capacity
on HD.

If you can afford to spend a grand on an HD telly and entertainment system
then you can fork out for a Sky box.

That said, does HD make Robin Hood any better written? Does HD make Torchwood
any less gay? Does HD make Not Going Out any less unfunny?

This country's got too many people who can barely figure out how to work their
SD equipment and end up with 14:9 analogue pictures stretched across a 16:9 WS
TV. Plus, even if HD does get a foothold the broadcasters will reduce the
bandwidth so that it's no better than SD used to be on Sky before they started
to ruin it last time. Oh, and then they'll sell us Ultra-HD.

I doubt Joe Chav is going to buy into HD for films and games and notice the
difference even if they do, so they've lost the bulk of their market there.
And by the time the country is ready for HD, perhaps in another 10 years time,
then it'll have long since stopped being viable.
