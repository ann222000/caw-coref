Closure on an earlier topic discussed in this newsgroup.

2 or 3 weeks back I posted about several puzzling toll calls appearing on my
line. No one was in the house when most of them were made, and I inquired
about what might have caused them. Several of you suggested plausible
scenarios.

The local phone people were useless, and in a change of policy refused to
removed the charges (10 calls, total less than $2.00).

Through a contact at my state's public utilities commission, I was provided
the name of a high-level person at the phone company headquarters. I sent a
detailed letter to that person, who assigned the matter to an associate to
handle. Yesterday I received a letter from that person; relevant portion
reads:

&quot;Preliminary research indicates possible crossed wires, and (phone company)
installation and repair has been notified of the problem. A technician will
be dispatched to correct the problem, so there is no future occurrence. ...
A credit ... will appear on (your next) statement.&quot;

Thanks, guys, for your assistance. I used some of your technical insight in
my letter to the phone company, and it appears to have had the desired
effect.
