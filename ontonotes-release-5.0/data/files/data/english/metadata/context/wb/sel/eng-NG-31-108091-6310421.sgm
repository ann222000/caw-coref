Clutch not disengaging?

Hi all, i have posted on some forums but to no avail. Whilst out
riding recently something happened to my clutch, i thought it was
the cable at first but soon found it didnt cut out and i managed to
get it home. Have since been trying to solve the problem but am
really stuck.

It's a 125 with a short pushrod and clutch operating arm and cable
on the right side of the bike. The cable is fine. The clutch just
doesn't seem to disengage. If i start the bike up i can change up
and down through the gears without using the clutch. When in gear
the rear wheel will spin. Using the clutch lever does nothing at
all!! The wheel will continue to spin, the engine will not
disengage, and with the clutch fully out and no throttle the engine
does not cut out like it usually would. Any idea's?

As i said the cable is fine, i have tried it without the cable
connected and just manually operating the clutch arm, with the same
results. I thought the pushrod might have slipped out, and also i
tried reading on the net to learn how the clutch works to try and
fix it, but i'm stuck.

I drained the oil, took off the crankcase, loosened the thrust plate
and seperated the clutch plates, covering each one in fresh oil,
then reassembled and checked the pushrod was seated properly but the
results are the same.

I found that if i start up and put in first (rear wheel turning)
then put the rear brake on and pull the clutch in, as i let it out
it operates normally!!! I can feel the bite point again and if i let
it out too far it cuts out! As it should! But ONLY with the rear
brake in! Without it the engine just keeps going and the wheel keeps
spinning and the clutch does nothing at all!!!

So...any clutch experts out there??? Any help at all would be
greatly appreciated! Many thanks.

Did you mic the steel plates and check them for warping? I'm no expert
(and it's hard to know which 125cc bike we're supposed to be familiar
with...), but it seems that warped plates might prevent the clutch from
disengaging when the lever is pulled.

When you do this, does the clutch seem to disengage fully, or only
partially?

Oh yeah, tell us what bike you've got; it'll help us to help you.

That sounds...not entirely unexpected.  Multi-plate wet clutches as used in
motorcycles are known to have some coupling even when disengaged simply due
to the viscosity of oil in the slim spaces between the plates.

So you can easily use the rear brake to stop the wheel while in gear, clutch
in, without stalling the engine?  That's normal.  Then the wheel starts
turning when you let off the brake, still on the clutch?  Also normal.
Another test: with the engine stopped and in gear, wheels on the ground,
pull the clutch in and see if you can roll it back and forth across the
floor.  If so, you're golden.

When using the rear brake it doesn't really seem to disengage fully
but is just being helped by the rear brake.

I just been out and tested it, with the bike in 1st and pulling the
clutch in i can move it, but with a little bit of initial
resistance.

Yes the bike is a cheap chinese copy :( A Sukida SK125, with a honda
cg125 engine and a suzuki gn125 body. It's only for learning and is
all i could afford at the mo :(

So is it normal that with the bike on the centrestand and in gear it
won't cut out? And that the wheel is spinning easily, and i can
change up and down through the gears easily and the rear wheel speed
will change with it? Should it not disengage still at least a lttle
if the clutch is pulled in?? Does it only cut out if there is
resistance? i.e. the rear brake or the wheel on the ground??

I think after taking it apart and freeing the plates a little, and
dowsing them in new oil, new oil in the engine overnight etc, that
maybe the plates are moving a little more freely, and it's working,
but i still feel it is not disengaging as much as it could? Does
that sound right?

Many thanks everyone!

Rear wheels will spin with the biemi neutral. It's caused by oil drag.
I'm not sure if this is what you mean. But you should be able to stop
the wheel with your hand.

Let's get some more information:
Did you buy the bike new?
Did the clutch _ever_ work as expected? That is, was there ever a time
when pulling in the clutch lever fully disengaged the clutch, without
any 'help' from the rear brake?

If your answers are (respectively) 'yes' and 'no' then you've clearly
got a defective bike, and warranty support (should it exist) might be
your best option.

If your answers are (respectively) 'no' and 'no' or even 'no' and 'yes'
then something has failed, and the clutch steels and springs are an
obvious place to look.

If the steels have bluish spots, or spots that seem more worn than
others, then they are likely warped. Placing each steel disk onto a
piece of plate glass (which is a reasonable approximation to a precision
flat surface) and checking for gaps is another means of checking them.

The clutch springs should be a particular length (specified in the
factory service manual for your bike, or the Honda cg125 manual) when
measured outside of the clutch.

If you're going to pull the clutch apart again anyway, checking the
steel plates and the spring length is a minimal investment in time and
effort, and would go a long way towards narrowing down the potential
causes of the problem. I don't know how likely TOG's conclusion is (he's
pretty good at this stuff), but I hope it's just some warped steel disks
and/or springs. Good luck!

"Cut out" is a term that refers to an electrical problem where the
engine stops firing intermittently.

Maybe you have seen old movies where witnesses were standing around
watching an airplane crash, and the airplane's engine went "buzz-
silence-buzz-buzz-silence-silence-buzz-silence" and then the airplane
crashed just out of sight and there was a big fire ball and smoke
rising into the air.

Instead of "cut out", you should use "stall" to describe what happens
when the motorcycle is in gear and the rear wheel is in contact with
the ground and the engine stops.

Well, I was thinking that with oil drag, there's never a problem, but if
it genuinely is stuck in gear, yes, you're quite right.

Thanks for all your help everyone. It seems to be somewhat better now. I think
in the end it was a combination of the pushrod slipping out which caused the
initial problem (rubbish design on this engine i'd say) followed by it drawing my
attention to the fact that the clutch is not great But after everyone pointed out
that the wheel spins normally etc, i realised it was going again and working ok,
also think that draining the oil and giving it better stuff has helped a little (the oil
that went in was a nice golden colour, the stuff that came out was a crap dark
grey lol).

Yes once i'd put it back together and made sure the pushrod seated properly,
and had nice new oil, it's better. Still doesn't seem like the smoothest operating
or best clutch in the world though! It doesn't have a ball bearing on the
pushrod! And i can't push it in to seperate the plates manually, and i can't quite
grasp how it works!

The oil has three jobs: lubricating the rubbing parts, carrying heat
away from the rubbing parts, and carrying dirt, metal particles and
carbon away. The clutch runs in an oil bath and has fiber friction
plates that wear and add debris to the oil. So the oil will always
change from a nice clear golden color to a darker color in a few
hundred miles.

Some wag once remarked that a motorcycle clutch is a device that is
never fully engaged, nor fully disengaged. Over a period of use, it
only gets worse...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It doesn't have a ball bearing on the pushrod!
">

A pushrod with a rounded end is almost as good as a hardened steel
ball, but the round end will eventually wear flat and heat of friction
can cause the end of the rod to weld to the clutch pusher momentarily.

You don't need to have the clutch rod pushing against the clutch
pusher all the time while you're riding. That's why you always want to
have some free play in the clutch cable. About a millimeter will do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And i can't push it in to seperate the plates manually, and i can't quite
&gt; grasp how it works!
">

Oh, no kidding? Can you push on the rod manually with 60 to 90 pounds
of force?

The clutch pressure plate rotates with the clutch basket, it is bolted
to the clutch basket.The bolts squeeze on several springs.

Pay attention now.

There are 4, 5, or 6 springs in the clutch pressure plate that squeeze
the clutch plates together. Perhaps each spring has a rate of about 30
pounds per inch of compression, but they are *preloaded* about half an
inch by the bolts that pass through the pressure plate and screw into
the clutch basket.

So, each spring is pushing against the pressure plate with about 15
pounds of force.
If you have 4 springs, that's 60 pounds of force, if you have 5
springs, it's 75 pounds of force clamping the clutch plates together.

When you pull the clutch lever, this force is multiplied by a 10 to 1
lever ratio which counteracts the preload on the clutch springs,
allowing the plates to slip.

What else is in the clutch assembly?

Half a dozen fiber clutch plates have square tabs that engage slots in
the rotating clutch basket. The primary gear on the crankshaft engages
the large gear on the clutch basket, making it spin. The primary gear
arrangement multiplies the torque output from the crankshaft by about
a two to one ratio.

Half a dozen metal plates have teeth that engage grooves in the clutch
center hub that is bolted to the transmission mainshaft. They will
cause the transmission mainshaft to turn and the gears on the
mainshaft engages the gears on the countershaft and that turns the
countershaft sprocket that pulls the drive chain around and your rear
wheel turns.

The transmission further multiplies the torque output of the engine,
and multiple gears allow you to select the best torque output you need
to handle slow traffic, hills, or open highway cruising. The sprockets
further multiply the engine torque to provide thrust at the rear wheel
to overcome wind resistance and allow you to climb grades.

There are bearings on the mainshaft and countershaft, but there are no
bearings inside the gears on those shafts. They are lubricated by
transmission oil and oil has viscous drag.

That's why the rear wheel mysteriously spins, even when the
transmission is in neutral
