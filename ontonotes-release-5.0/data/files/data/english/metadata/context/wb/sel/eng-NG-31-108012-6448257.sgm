After stocking up on $1.29 point cut corned beef brisket, I found
another store that had them on sale for $.99/lb.  So now I got enough
till next year.

Slow cooked the fat part is sooooooooo good tasting.  It's even worth
killing myself a little by eating it.  With the extra high salt and
fat I wonder how many minutes of my life I'm giving up to eat a
serving.

I know, it is hard to resist, I may eat some, then try to trim the
rest. The salt is bad too but it makes things taste good. I try to not
salt my food, and occasionally give myself a little treat, and have
have some.

'Zactly.  Boiled corned beef fat is disguting, in fact any boiled meat
fat is disgusting.  Before boiling corned beef I trim most of the
external fat.  And rendering out more fat is one of the reasons I oven
roast the boiled corned beef, and to crisp what little external fat

I should have said I trim *most* of the external fat prior to boiling corned
beef (or crock-potting it with liquid, which is essentially the same thing
except it takes a lot longer!).  I also like to finish it off in the oven
for the reasons you cited.  The rest of the external fat is trimmed before I
ever slice and serve the corned beef.  Eating that blubbery stuff is just
gross, IMHO.

To add to this, salt is not necessarily bad for all people with high blood
pressure, it varies case by case.  Reducing salt intake is usually
recommended as a means of finding if it is the contributing cause, but there
are other reasons for HBP, some of which are hereditary vs. dietary, or are
stress-related.  I'm one of those people who has HBP "just because".  It
doesn't run in my family, and reducing salt had no affect.

Considering that the calories per serving of just the corned beef is 820
calories, 61% of which is from fat, I wouldn't worry about that little extra
fat you're eating.   I'll bet you're eating more than a 4 ounce serving as
well, so most likely at least doubling those figures.  One serving also has
3629mg of salt.

Hope you have a good cardiologist.

what are you doing that your corned beef has 3693mg of salt?
if you make boiled corned beef &amp; cabbage, you discard the
cooking liquid &amp; most of the salt. a serving of good Irish
boiled corned beef &amp; cabbage has 419mg of salt.

You can also soak the corned beef in a large pot of water, changing it every
few hours, which will considerable reduce the sodium. Think of it as reverse
brining.

Then stick in the oven at 250F until done.

typhus is carried by fleas, body lice or mites/chiggers,

what that has to do with corned beef or becoming vegan is

Eating high calorie foods doesn't make someone fat or sickly. Not
eating a well balanced diet overall, and not getting enough exercise
is what makes people obese and sick. Veganism CLEARLY does not
guarantee good health, as most vegans I know have been some of the
sickest people I've known too. Humans are omnivores. It is beneficial
to the survival of our species that we have been omnivores.

Its a simple fact you cannot gain weight unless you consume more
calories than you burn everyday, Most adult women need around 2000,
most adult men need 2500 or so. It will vary based on body type and
your current weight of course. After these calories any additional
calories you eat will contribute to your growing thighs, hips,
buttocks, stomach , etc .... It does not matter if these calories come
from roast beef or tofu.

Salt as many have correctly stated is NOT bad for the average person.
Some people do react poorly to salt and it does increase THEIR blood
pressure, but that is not the case for the average person. If you are
one of those people who react to salt poorly well of course don't eat
gobs of it.

I can't believe how many people who are ignorant of basic nutrition
come in here and make claims as if they were truth. If you are a
vegan, great more meat for all the rest of us. But don't think for a
second that it is making you any more fit than anyone else.

Yet, there are lots of people out there who don't exercise and who eats
lots of high sugar, high fat food and don't gain weight while others who
watch their weight carefully and get lots of exercise occasionally splurge
and suck on extra eight like a sponge.

And it is also a fact that some people naturally absorb more nutrition from
their food and have a lower metabolism while others with a higher
metabolism can burn it off doing damned little.

Once again...... varies from person to person. My father in law ate a lot

Yes it does!! - if they fail to burn the calories off by means of exercise -
which an increasing number of people, particularly young people, do not do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Not
&gt; eating a well balanced diet overall, and not getting enough exercise
&gt; is what makes people obese and sick. Veganism CLEARLY does not
&gt; guarantee good health, as most vegans I know have been some of the
&gt; sickest people I've known too.
">

Obesity is recognised in the UK, Europe and the US as one of the most
serious health problems of the 21st. century.

You are correct that Veganism does not guarantee good health. Indeed, a
small number of people have suffered vitamin and amino-acid deficiencies
because they took up Veganism without the necessary nutritional knowledge. A
Vitamin B12 supplement of 250 آµg per day is vital, otherwise Sub-acute
Degeneration of the Spinal Cord may result.

But I didn't become Vegan to stay healthy. That's just a fortunate
by-product. I just couldn't tolerate and will never tolerate the way food
animals were/are treated and want no responsibility for it. And, BTW, I
haven't only been Vegan for 45 years. I have also been studying the
relationship between diet and health for 45 years.

I have had a few health problems over the last seven years or so: Renal
stones, DVT leading PE (without flying anywhere nice!), AF - now cured by
means of Catheter Ablation Therapy, and I fell and ruptured my spleen - but
the one thing I definitely do not have is Coronary Heart Disease.

I suffered some chest pain last year and had a Nuclear Perfusion Scan done
which showed my coronary arteries are 100% functional and the pain was put
down to Oesophageal Spasm (cramp of the gullet). The same spray, GTN, eases
it though. The docs said that with my family history, they were quite
surprised it wasn't coronary heart disease.

True. I did not say otherwise. If we were naturally vegetarian, we'd
probably have evolved with four stomachs and appendices ten times the size
of rabbits'! But we are sentient and can therefore make choices based upon
what we believe to be right and proper. I have no problem at all with your
choices in this respect being different to mine.

&gt; Its a simple fact you cannot gain weight unless you consume more
&gt; calories than you burn everyday, Most adult women need around 2000,
&gt; most adult men need 2500 or so. It will vary based on body type and
&gt; your current weight of course. After these calories any additional
&gt; calories you eat will contribute to your growing thighs, hips,
&gt; buttocks, stomach , etc .... It does not matter if these calories come
&gt; from roast beef or tofu.
">

I don't care for tofu, but I believe it contains very few calories, being
mainly fermented bean protein. Everything white and sloppy is not fat.

I am overweight however, having as the doctor calls it, an 'apple belly'!
:o)  which, he informs me, I must lose on pain of contracting Diabetes - and
am getting it down by reducing my food intake generally and walking many
miles quite vigorously several times a week.

I do not like gymnasia. They are expensive, sometimes horrendously so, they
stink, remind me too much of school and are often populated by muscle-bound
over-competitive sport-heads who love to take the mickey out of older
members and as I live in a flat/apartment, the noise from exercise machines
would disturb my neighbours.

Having just turned 60 and having a free old farts' travel pass is useful now
because I can travel free to the outskirts of London for a bit of country
walking and to the more distant parks and gardens such as Richmond, Kew and
Wimbledon Common. I have just discovered that I can get a train direct to
Wimbledon from Kings Cross, just down the road to me. I am fortunate,
however, in living within walking distance of Regents Park and Parliament
Hill Fields/Hampstead Heath and the West End of London. All pleasant places
for a few miles' walk.

&gt; Salt as many have correctly stated is NOT bad for the average person.

I didn't actually mention salt, but anyway, at least here in the UK, medical
opinion is almost universal in its condemnation of excessive salt in the
diet because of its effects on blood pressure.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Some people do react poorly to salt and it does increase THEIR blood

&gt; I can't believe how many people who are ignorant of basic nutrition
&gt; come in here and make claims as if they were truth. If you are a
&gt; vegan, great more meat for all the rest of us.
">

And good luck to you. And 'ignorant of basic nutrition' eh?? Well - have you
realised your mistake yet?  ;o)

When I mention my own dietary preferences, I am in no way trying to tell
anyone else what they should eat. I get the impression that you might have
thought that this is what I am trying to do.

This is a mistake many who follow a normal omnivorous diet make. On the
other hand, if I mention I am Vegan (capital V please - it is a proper noun)
a far larger number of people make the point that they don't eat very much
red meat themselves, usually preferring poultry and fish, and I, without any
bias at all, tell them they are correct in this and also point out that oily
fish is particularly good for health, and we often end up having a friendly,
pleasant conversation about Vegetarianism and Veganism and diet in general
and often end up swapping recipes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But don't think for a second that it is making you any more fit than
">

anyone else.

OK. I won't. Instead, I will continue to think that thought every day of my
life, as I have been doing for many years now, based on forty-five years'
worth of research and expert knowledge.

This is borne out by medical opinion in general at least here in the UK, and
is proved beyond any doubt by the vast improvements in public health that
resulted from a government-sponsored dietary campaign in Finland many years
ago, where the traditional diet was so unhealthy that teenagers were dying
of coronaries and aborted foetuses were showing coronary arteries already
beginning to fur up with cholesterol, and is further proved by the
deterioration in health in Italians when they move from southern to northern
Italy and in Chinese and Japanese people when they move to the West.

(Source: A lecture I attended by a professor who had toured the world
researching the effects of diet upon health. He showed slides of sections of
the foetus' arteries. The sclerosis was all too obvious. Very sad.)

My father died suddenly at 51 from a massive coronary. He was a postman and
deliveries were all done on foot in those days, so he was pretty fit. He
wasn't overweight but did smoke and really did like fat. He used to devour
with relish the fat that my mother and I cut off our meat. My mother died
from the same cause at 63 - quite young for a woman, and as I said, nearly
all of my many aunts and uncles died from stroke or coronary heart disease.

I am now 60, and as I said, I have just had a scan carried out which has
shown my coronary arteries are 100% clear of narrowing or obstruction.

QED.

No longer true. Please try to keep up.

An excerpt:

Is there scientific documentation that we do not need to drink "8 x 8"?
There is highly suggestive evidence, says Valtin. First is the voluminous
scientific literature on the efficacy of the osmoregulatory system that
maintains water balance through the antidiuretic hormone and thirst. Second,
published surveys document that the mean daily fluid intake of thousands of
presumably healthy humans is less than the roughly two quarts prescribed by
8 x 8. Valtin argues that, in view of this evidence, the burden of proof
that everyone needs 8 x 8 should fall on those who persist in advocating the
high fluid intake without, apparently, citing any scientific support.

Finally, strong evidence now indicates that not all of the prescribed fluid
need be in the form of water. Careful peer-reviewed experiments have shown
that caffeinated drinks should indeed count toward the daily fluid intake in
the vast majority of persons. To a lesser extent, the same probably can be
said for dilute alcoholic beverages, such as beer, if taken in moderation.

"Thus, I have found no scientific proof that absolutely every person must
'drink at least eight glasses of water a day'," says Valtin. While there is
some evidence that the risk of certain diseases can be lowered by high water
intake, the quantities needed for this beneficial effect may be less than 8
x 8, and the recommendation can be limited to those particularly susceptible
to the diseases in question.
