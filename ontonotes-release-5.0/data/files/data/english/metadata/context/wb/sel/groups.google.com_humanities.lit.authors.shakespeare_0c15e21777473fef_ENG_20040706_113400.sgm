&lt;&lt;In Ginzberg's Legends of the Jews, archangels are said
to be &quot;comptrollers&quot; of the Sun, Moon and five planets.

MARS' archangel is named &quot;SAMUEL&quot;
VENUS' archangel is named &quot;ANIEL.&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;[Alice] took down a JAR from one of the shelves as she passed;

it was labelled &quot;ORANGE MARMALADE&quot;

but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like
to drop the JAR for fear of killing somebody, so managed
to put it into one of the cupBOARds as she fell past it.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------
Q: When is a BOAR not a BOAR?
A: When it's a JARL
-------------------------------------------------------
JARL, Noun 1. A chief; an EARL; in English history,
one of the leaders in the Danish and Norse invasions.

&quot;JARL&quot; is a name that signifies or is derived from:
&quot;a nobleman&quot;, &quot;an EARL&quot;.

JARL, noun. [Icel., nobleman, chief.]

JARL is the Scandinavian language cognate of EARL.

In Norse mythology, JARL was the son of Rig and Modir. Rig taught JARL
runes and other magic, as well as the language of the birds. JARL then
gathered some men and captured some land, then married Erna, with
whom he had eleven sons, the ancestors of the warriors in Norse society.

An EARL as a member of the British peerage ranks below
a Marquess and above a Viscount. A British EARL
equates in rank to a continental Count.
The wife of an EARL bears the rank of Countess.

Etymology

The word &quot;EARL&quot; derives from Middle English &quot;erl&quot; meaning warrior,
nobleman, equivalent to the JARL in Old Norse. It remains unclear
whether there exists connection by etymology to the Anglo-Saxon
term &quot;Ealdorman&quot; which translates literally as &quot;Elder&quot;, &quot;Senior&quot;,
and refers to a chief counselor of the realm. That term survives
in modern English as &quot;Alderman&quot;, a councilman or representative
in local government or a local church governing body.

&gt; 3. Oxfordians like to pretend that William Shakespeare was an

&gt; Shakespeare was quite a figure in the town of Stratford, who held
&gt; several offices such as ALDERMAN and later high bailiff. William
&gt; Shakespeare makes several references to ALDERMEN in his plays. In
&gt;&quot;ROMEO AND JULIET,&quot; Mercutio describes Queen Mab as
&gt; follows:
&gt;&quot;She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
&gt; In shape no bigger than an agate stone
&gt; On the forefinger of an ALDERMAN.&quot;

&lt;&lt;&quot;Makes [exactly those two] references to ALDERMEN&quot;. In fact, these
references are devastating evidence *against* Shakspere. Clearly
Shakespeare's *only* picture of ALDERMEN is a derisive one of
ring-wearers. We see Shakespeare has contempt for ALDERMEN-
completely at odds with your attempts to portray Shakspere
and Shakespeare as in love with their fathers.

And as you point out-- JS's highest office was &quot;high bailiff&quot;.
If Shakspere mentions &quot;ALDERMAN&quot; in homage to dad,
then certainly also &quot;high bailiff&quot;? In fact, there is only one &quot;bailiff&quot;--

AUTOLYCUS. Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well; he hath
been since an ape-bearer; then a process-server, a bailiff; then
he compass'd a motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
wife within a mile where my land and living lies; and, having
flown over many knavish professions, he settled only in rogue.
Some call him Autolycus. [--WT]

an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of ALDERMAN John Hooper.

What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and
Bloom? In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back
of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before
the mirror the matrimonial gift of ALDERMAN John Hooper with a clear

- the corporation, ALDERMEN, and livery.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;A guild obtains its charter from the monarch, but
its grant of livery since 1560 comes from the Court of ALDERMEN,
who have to be satisfied that &quot;....a number of men of good repute

guild have joined together for a time sufficiently long to justify
the belief that they will continue to gold together and are not

dated 18th June 1584, we have the following matterord Burghley,
referring to the Theatre and the Curtain: &quot;Upon Sondaie,
my Lord sent two ALDERMEN to the court, for the suppressing and
pulling downe of the theatre and curten, for all the Lords agreed
thereunto, saving my Lord Chamberlayn and Mr. Vice-Chamberlayn; but we
obtayned a letter to suppresse them all. Upon the same night I sent for
the Queen's players, and my Lord of Arundell his players, for they all
well nighe obeyed the Lords letters. The chiefest of her Highnes'
players advised me to send for the owner of the theatre, who was a
stubborne fellow, and to bynd him. I dyd so. He sent me word that he was
my Lord of Hunsdon's man, and he would not come to me, but he would in
the morning ride to my Lord. Then I sent the under-sheriff for hym, and
he brought him to me, and at his coming he showted me out very justice.
And in the end, I showed hym my Lord his master's hand, and then he was
more quiet. But to die for it he wold not be bound. And then I mynding
to send hym to prison, he made sute that he might be bounde to appeare
at the oier and determiner, the which is to-morrowe, where he said that
he was sure the court would not bynd hym, being a counsellor's man. And
so I have graunted his request, where he is sure to be bounde, or else
is lyke to do worse.&quot; The &quot;stubborne fellow&quot; was, without doubt, none
other than the high-spirited and pugnacious James Burbage.&gt;&gt;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;EARLs originally functioned essentially as royal governors.
The English kings found it dangerous to give additional power
to already powerful aristocrats, and so gradually sheriffs
assumed the governing role. The details of this transition remain
obscure, since EARLs in more peripheral areas (such as the
Scottish and Welsh marches and Cornwall) retained some
viceregal powers long after other EARLs had lost them.
The loosening of central authority during the Anarchy also
complicates any smooth description of the changeover.

A loose connection between EARLs and shires remained for a long time
after authority had moved over to the sheriffs. An official defining
characteristic of an EARL consisted of the receipt of the &quot;third penny&quot;
of the revenues of justice of a shire. Thus EVERy EARL had an
association with some shire, and very often a new creation of
an EARLdom would take place in favor of the county where
the new EARL already had large estates and local influence.

Also, due to the this association of EARLs and shires, the medieval
practice could remain somewhat loose regarding the precise name used
no confusion could arise by calling someone EARL of a shire,
EARL of the county town of the shire, or EARL of some other
prominent place in the shire; these all implied the same.
Thus we find the &quot;EARL of Shrewsbury&quot; (Shropshire),
&quot;EARL of Arundel&quot; or &quot;EARL of Chichester&quot; (Sussex),
&quot;EARL of Winchester&quot; (Hampshire), etc.
In a few cases the EARL was traditionally addressed by
his family name, e.g. the &quot;EARL Warenne&quot; (in this case the practice may
have arisen because these EARLs had little or no property in Surrey,
their official county).

As this last case illustrates, an EARL did not always have an intimate
association with &quot;his&quot; county. Another example comes from
the EARLs of Oxford, whose property largely lay in Essex.
They became EARLs of Oxford because EARLs of Essex
and of the other nearby shires already existed.

Eventually the connection between an EARL and a shire disappeared, so
that in the present day a number of EARLdoms take their names from
towns, mountains, or simply
surnames. Nevertheless, some consider that the EARLdoms named for
counties (or county towns) retain more prestige.

Forms of Address

An EARL has the title EARL of X when the title originates from a
placename, or EARL X when the title comes from a surname. In either
case, the EARL is referred to as Lord X, and his wife as Lady X.
Countesses who hold EARLdoms in their own right also
use Lady X, but their husbands do not receive any titles.

The eldest son of an EARL generally bears the courtesy title
of Viscount or Lord; one refers to a younger son of an EARL
as the Honourable [Forename] [Surname] and to
a daughter as Lady [Forename] [Surname].&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Susan de Vere as an actor: Ogburn, p. 740, reproduces a drawing of
her as Thomyris in The Masque of Queens. She is also known to have
played in at least The Masque of Beauty and The Masque of Blackness.

Alan Nelson notes a curious reference to her, which he interprets
as referring to Oxford's &quot;public reputation as a deadbeat dad&quot;:

...in 1605, after Oxford's death in 1604, she married Philip Herbert
EARL of Montgomery, in consequence of which she became the subject of
a poem by Nathaniel Baxter. The following poem which alludes to
Susan's want of an adequate dowry was recorded by John Manningham
of the Middle Temple during the year 1602-3, when she was
about 15 and Oxford was still alive:

LA[DY] SUSAN VERE

NOTHING's your lott, that's more then can be told
For NOTHING is more precious then gold

(From The Diary of John Manningham of the Middle Temple 1602-1603, ed.
Robert Parker Sorlien (Hanover, NH: University Press of New England,
1976), p. 182, quoted in Nelson, &quot;Oxford the Deadbeat Dad,&quot;
)

Possibly; but one cannot become the subject of a poem in 1602-3
&quot;in consequence of&quot; a marriage in 1605.

Lear: Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.

Cordelia NOTHING, my lord.

Lear NOTHING?

Cordelia NOTHING.

Lear NOTHING will come of NOTHING. Speak again.

a gate to the Underworld, would then be embedded.

this stone would be removed to permit the MANES
to pass through. The object of the cult rendered to them was
to appease their anger. Originally they were offered blood sacrifices,
and it is probable that the first gladiatorial combats were instituted
in their honour.&gt;&gt; -- Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology

&lt;&lt;Even in modern times, scholars of popular fiction are familiar with
the notorious Order of THE ASSASSINS OF ALAMUT, a medieval islamic sect,
ruled by the legendary OLD MAN of the MOUNTAIN. The name &quot;ASSASSINS&quot;
derives from the word &quot;ASSASS,&quot; meaning &quot;GUARDIANs&quot; or &quot;Protectors&quot;, for
the ASSASSins were in reality the Islamic Soldier-Monks in charge of the
protection of the Holy Land. &quot;ASSASSeen in Arabic signifies 'GUARDIANs',
and some commentators consider this to be the true origin of the word:
'GUARDIANs of the secrets'.&quot; - Arkon Daraul, Secret Societies.

The ASSASSins were the keepers of much occult knowledge, inherited
from Israel, Babylon, Egypt, and other far more ancient sources.
They knew the secrets of the gnostic and of the kabbala.
The longer-than-normal lifespan of their leader, Hasan ben SABA,
the OLD MAN of the MOUNTAIN, is one clue

[OLD MAN is a translation for `PIR': a Persian ` SHEIKH']

another is their motto, the alchemical saying: NOTHING IS TRUE...

Interestingly, in Les Habits Noirs, Paul F val revealed that the word
&quot;NOTHING,&quot; translated in 30 languages, carved on two ivory disks,
was the ultimate secret locked inside the &quot;Scapulaire de la Merci&quot;
(Scapulary of Mercy), a pendant worn at all times
by Colonel Bozzo, the fearsome leader of the gang.&gt;&gt;

&quot;Are you alive, or not? Is there NOTHING in your head?&quot;
