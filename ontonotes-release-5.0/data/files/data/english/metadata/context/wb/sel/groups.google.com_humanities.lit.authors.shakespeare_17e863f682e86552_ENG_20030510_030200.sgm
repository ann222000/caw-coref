On his website regarding the inscription on Shakespeare's monument
( ), and more particularly, in his
Appendix I ( ), Peter Farey tells us
that the capitalization of certain words in the inscription is inconsistent,
and gives us his reasons for believing why this is so.

While Peter and I agree that the capitalization, if such it is, is
inconsistent, we disagree vehemently as to the reason why. For the most
part, where I think Peter went wrong in his thinking was in his reliance on
the statistics he derived from a 67,000 line sample of Elizabethan verse. I
don't believe that Peter properly adjusted his sample to take into account
the known variations in the application of the capitalization rules of the
era, so his statistics are grossly misleading. In particular, they have
grossly misled *him*.

First, we should probably ask ourselves if there *were* any capitalization
rules of that era. Luckily, there happens to be a clearly expressed rule in
what I believe was the very first book of English grammar that was ever
printed.

In his &quot;An Execration upon Vulcan,&quot; Ben Jonson tells us that the fire that
swept his study late in his life took with it &quot;a grammar&quot; that he had been
working on that would &quot;teach some that their nurses could not do, the purity
of Language.&quot; Fortunately for us, either Ben had been mistaken, or he
decided to reconstruct his grammar after the flames had died down, for in
the 1640 folio of Jonson's &quot;Works,&quot; printed 3 years after his death,
appeared a piece entitled &quot;The English Grammar.&quot;

In Chapter II of this short work, entitled &quot;Of Letters and their Powers,&quot; he
wrote:

&quot;In our language we use these twenty and four letters, A. B. C. D. E. F. G.
H. I. K. L. M. N. O. P. Q. R. S. T. V. W. X. Y. Z. a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h.
i. k. l. m. n. o. p. q. r. s. t. v. w. x. y. z. The great letters serve to
begin sentences, with us, to lead proper names, and express numbers. The
less make the fabric of speech.&quot;

Pretty straight forward. Letters at the beginning of sentences, beginning
proper nouns, and expressing numbers (presumably Roman numerals) are all
capitalized (i.e., are &quot;great&quot;). The rest are all lower case (i.e. &quot;less&quot;).
So where does the room for variation come in?

I'm not much of a grammarian, so I'd appreciate it if anyone wishes to step
in here and give me some help, but from what I've seen there seems to be two
possibilities:

1) There was a variation in understanding as to what kinds of nouns
constituted &quot;proper nouns&quot;; or

2) Some people just capitalized all nouns, despite what old Ben thought
about it.

Personally, I suspect that #1 is the most likely. Although there is plenty
of variation, it appears to me that there was a tendency in the writings
I've seen to consider nouns that referred to a specific thing as a &quot;proper
noun&quot;, at least for purposes of capitalization, even if the thing did not
have a specific name (such as &quot;George&quot;). For example, a reference to *that*
Tomb in particular might be capitalized, whereas a reference to just any
tombs in general would not be.

But regardless of whether 1 or 2 are correct (or neither), there is a
demonstrable continuum in the practice of capitalizing nouns. Those who
practiced Jonson's rule in a very strict sense, such as Jonson himself,
would only capitalize nouns that we would consider to be &quot;proper nouns.&quot;
Such as &quot;George,&quot; or &quot;Eaton,&quot; or &quot;Devil.&quot; They would also capitalize the
personifications of certain things, such as when &quot;Art&quot; and &quot;Nature&quot; are
being personified in a sentence, as Jonson does in Act IV, Scene I, of &quot;The
Alchemist&quot;:

&quot;And, thou shalt ha' thy wardrobe,
Richer than Nature's, still, to thy self,
And vary oftener, for thy pride, than she:
Or Art, her wise, and almost-equal servant.&quot;

For the sake of labelling, I'll refer to those who followed Jonson's rule of
capitalization by applying it only to what we would consider a proper noun,
or a personification, as &quot;pedantic capitalizers&quot; (though this rather
unfairly perpetuates the stereotype of Jonson as a pedantic writer).

For the sake of contrast, we can refer to those people who had a broader
view of what constitued a proper noun as &quot;liberal capitalizers.&quot; A liberal
capitalizer might print Jonson's lines from &quot;The Alchemist&quot; like this:

And thou shalt ha' thy Wardrobe
Richer than Nature's, still to change thy self,
And vary oftener, for thy Pride, than she,
Or Art, her wise and almost-equal Servant.

&quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Art&quot; are being personified, so they are capitalized in both
versions. But the liberal capitalizer would also capitalize &quot;Wardrobe,&quot;
&quot;Pride,&quot; and &quot;Servant&quot; because they are nouns that are each referring to a
specific thing (i.e., &quot;thy&quot; Wardrobe, &quot;thy&quot; Pride, and &quot;Nature's&quot; Servant),
as opposed to things in general.

As I mentioned, there appears to be a continuum, stretching from the extreme
&quot;liberal capitalizers&quot; on one side, to the extreme &quot;pedantic capitalizers&quot;
on the other. Which may be one reason why there are variations in the nouns
chosen for capitalization.

Also, there are a couple of reasons why there may be inconsistencies within
any given text. As Peter Groves pointed out to us back in November of 2002,
there are usually plenty of compositor errors in the texts that were printed
at that time, especially in longer works. An inconsistency may simply be a
compositor's error.

In addition, you might have any number of compositors working on any one
book as it was being printed. Presumably you could have a liberal
capitalizer working next to a pedantic capitalizer, in which case the
capitalization would depend on who was casting the type for the page or
section of text you happen to be looking at.

To give an example of what I'm talking about, here's a post of the second
poem from Jonson's &quot;Epigrams&quot;:

The image on the left is from the 1616 edition of Jonson's &quot;Works.&quot; It is
well known that Jonson personally shepherded this edition of his works
through the printing process, including the correction of spelling and
punctuation errors in the galley proofs. The use of capitalization here is
a perfect example of what I'm referring to as &quot;pedantic capitalization.&quot;
Note that other than at the beginning of lines, the only word capitalized is
&quot;Epigrammes&quot;, and that's because Jonson is referring to the title of his
book, a proper noun.

The image on the right is from the 1692 reprint of Jonson's &quot;Works.&quot; Here
we appear to have the hand of a &quot;liberal capitalizer.&quot; Not only is
&quot;Epigrams&quot; capitalized, but so is Book, Title, Thing, Ink, Wit, Mad-men,
Stones, Malice, Temper, Men, Covetous, Self-Fame, Shame, Phrase, World[']s,
Laughter, Gaze, Honesty, and Praise. All of them except &quot;Covetous&quot; are
nouns, and all are referring to what is arguably a specific thing, such as
the World's &quot;Laughter&quot; (as opposed to &quot;laughter&quot; in general), &quot;a&quot; petulant
&quot;Thing&quot;, and the specific &quot;Ink&quot; that is being hurled by the petulant Thing.
And even Covetous, though not normally considered a noun, is being used here
as a specific attribute of the Book (or more properly, the converse, since
the Book is &quot;not&quot; Covetous), which could, I suppose, make it a &quot;thing&quot;.

So if my understanding of how capitalization was applied is correct, then
Peter's statistics are virtually meaningless without knowing more about the
works from which his sample was derived.

For example, Peter gives us his statistics regarding the word &quot;art&quot;, which
is not capitalized in the monument's inscription. Peter tells us that the
word &quot;art&quot; appeared 75 times in his sample of 67,000 lines (presumably &quot;art&quot;
was being used as a noun in these 75 cases, not as a verb). Of those 75
times, 10 had an initial capital not explained either by being at the start
of a line of verse or by following a full stop. From this, Peter concludes
that it isn't unusual to see the word &quot;art&quot; without an initial capital in
the inscription, so our attention is not being drawn to that word by his
imagined &quot;riddle maker.&quot;

But what Peter doesn't tell us is which of those works from which he derived
his sample were printed by &quot;pedantic capitalizers&quot; and which were by
&quot;liberal capitalizers.&quot;

To illustrate what I mean, let's go back to Jonson's &quot;The Alchemist.&quot; As I
mentioned before, the printing of the 1616 edition of this work was
personally supervised by Ben Jonson. Luckily for our purposes, a photocopy
of the 1616 edition of Jonson's works has been posted on the Furness
Library's website. &quot;The Alchemist&quot; begins at:

(note, this URL is probably too long to survive as a viable link--you'll
probably need to cut and paste it to your browser's address line). From my
count, the word &quot;art&quot; is used as a noun at least 22 times in this play. It
shows up on pages 605, 613*, 615, 618, 620, 626, 627*, 635, 639, 649, 650*,
651, 652, 653, 657*, 662, and 671. It show up twice on pages marked with an
(*). Except for pages 635 and 651, each time it shows up the &quot;a&quot; is not
capitalized. Page 651 is where the lines quoted above may be found, so the
&quot;A&quot; in Art is capitalized there because it is a personification. Most
likely, the capitalization of &quot;Art&quot; on page 635 is just one that Jonson
missed.

If Peter was drawing his statistics from the 1616 edition of &quot;The
Alchemist&quot;, they would support his conclusion that the non-capitalization of
&quot;art&quot; was not unusual. It is only capitalized twice out of 22 times.

However, his statistics would have been drastically different if he had
drawn his sample from the 1692 printing of &quot;The Alchemist.&quot; In the 1692
version, the initial &quot;A&quot; in &quot;Art&quot; is capitalized in 100% of its appearances;
22 out of 22 times. The 1692 version, painstakingly transcribed, can be
accessed at this link:

I agree with just about everything Clark says against Peter's conclusion that
capitalizations and non-capitalizations of particular words should be taken as
clues that a secret message is intended. Two additional unnew comments:

(1) Some of the words Peter finds to be clues seem less meaningful as clues than
some that could have been but were not used as clues. This alone causes me to
drop Peter's theory about capitalization and non-capitialization.

(2) How is capitalization used in the Latin inscription. Why wasn't the muddy
message Peter finds in the English helped out by something in the Latin?

&gt;of capitalization so literally that he'll only capitalize the initial

&gt;capitalize a word that begins a line of verse unless it also begins a
&gt;sentence), as well as words that we would consider proper nouns and
&gt;personifications (as Jonson has done in the 1616 folio).

&gt;Early one morning, &quot;Fred&quot; begins the job and completes the following portion

&gt;&quot;Stay Passenger, why goest thov by so--&quot;

&gt;By this time, &quot;Fred&quot; feels nature calling, so he heads out back while

Actually, at this point Fred turned around and whacked Barney with a

Barney: Oww! What was that for, mate?
Fred: 'Sblood, Barney, I'm supposed to carve DECK THIS TOMBE now, and

Barney: Umm, uhh...I've got it! Change THIS to YS, that'll save lots
of room.
Fred: Looks sort of stupid since you spelled out THIS on the line
above.
Barney: Can't be helped. Anyway, the stone's going to Stratford and
I hear there's not a literate soul in the whole town.

(A few minutes later...)

Fred: Any more bright ideas, Barney? TOMBE is still a tight fit.
Barney: Easy, just make the T extra tall and you can nestle the O
underneath its arm.
Fred: That works swell! The next pint of sack is on me, friend. But
philosophically speaking, it is right to capitalize TOMBE?
Barney: Well...a tomb contains a body, and a body is a former person,
argal a tomb is a personal and proper noun.

&gt;Pure fantasy, of course, but it explains all of the inconsistencies, whereas

Nowhere in either of these articles is there any trace of
the word 'inconsistent', and the only time when it would
have any relevance at all would be in the fact that whereas
'Tombe' has an initial capital, 'monument' does not. You
appear once again to be tilting at the wrong windmill.

Well, let's sort that one out straight away. My 'sample'
consisted of just under 57,000 (not 67,000) lines of rhymed
verse dated from the 30 or so years preceding 1616, which
purported to show the original text, and which I was able to
find on the internet at the time I was doing these counts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't believe that Peter properly adjusted his sample to

&gt; *him*.

"/>

Since I didn't 'adjust' it at all, you are right to say that
I didn't adjust it 'properly'. You don't adjust samples, Clark.
You may need to stratify or weight them occasionally, but only
if you know there to be an otherwise unavoidable reason that
your sample will not fairly represent the whole. Since on this
occasion the sample *was* the whole lot available to me, and I
had no reason to suspect that it was unrepresentative, I left
it untampered with in any way.

It was therefore as near as I could get to a completely random
sample of the way rhymed verse was actually being printed at
that time, and with which one might reasonably expect an
educated reader to have been familiar.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; First, we should probably ask ourselves if there *were* any
&gt; capitalization rules of that era. Luckily, there happens to
&gt; be a clearly expressed rule in what I believe was the very
&gt; first book of English grammar that was ever printed.

&gt; In his &quot;An Execration upon Vulcan,&quot; Ben Jonson tells us that
&gt; the fire that swept his study late in his life took with it
&gt;&quot;a grammar&quot; that he had been working on that would &quot;teach some
&gt; that their nurses could not do, the purity of Language.&quot;
&gt; Fortunately for us, either Ben had been mistaken, or he
&gt; decided to reconstruct his grammar after the flames had died
&gt; down, for in the 1640 folio of Jonson's &quot;Works,&quot; printed 3
&gt; years after his death, appeared a piece entitled &quot;The English
&gt; Grammar.&quot;

&gt; In Chapter II of this short work, entitled &quot;Of Letters and
&gt; their Powers,&quot; he wrote:

&gt;&quot;In our language we use these twenty and four letters, A. B.
&gt; C. D. E. F. G. H. I. K. L. M. N. O. P. Q. R. S. T. V. W. X.
&gt; Y. Z. a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h. i. k. l. m. n. o. p. q. r. s.
&gt; t. v. w. x. y. z. The great letters serve to begin sentences,
&gt; with us, to lead proper names, and express numbers. The
&gt; less make the fabric of speech.&quot;

&gt; Pretty straight forward. Letters at the beginning of sentences,
&gt; beginning proper nouns,

He said &quot;proper names&quot;, which may or may not be significant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and expressing numbers (presumably
&gt; Roman numerals) are all capitalized (i.e., are &quot;great&quot;).
&gt; The rest are all lower case (i.e. &quot;less&quot;).
&gt; So where does the room for variation come in?

"/>

Was there any earlier attempt to present such rules? You think
not, in which case the variation was the current state that
Jonson was trying to improve.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm not much of a grammarian, so I'd appreciate it if anyone
&gt; wishes to step in here and give me some help, but from what
&gt; I've seen there seems to be two possibilities:

&gt; of nouns constituted &quot;proper nouns&quot;; or

&gt; 2) Some people just capitalized all nouns, despite what old

Well, in 1616 it seems unlikely that anyone except Jonson
would have known what he thought about it. (Which raises an
interesting thought that I'll come back to later).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Personally, I suspect that #1 is the most likely.

"/>

That rather depends upon whether there was any concept of
'proper names' before this work of Jonson's came out. If you
mean that there was no generally accepted rule as to which
nouns should be capitalized, however, I would agree. It's
tautological.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Although there is plenty of variation, it appears to me
&gt; that there was a tendency in the writings I've seen to
&gt; consider nouns that referred to a specific thing as a
&gt;&quot;proper noun&quot;, at least for purposes of capitalization,
&gt; even if the thing did not have a specific name (such as
&gt;&quot;George&quot;). For example, a reference to *that* Tomb in
&gt; particular might be capitalized, whereas a reference to
&gt; just any tombs in general would not be.

Funnily enough, this was an idea I too was following up at
one time, but it seemed to break down in practice.

It doesn't *matter*. That's the whole point of a random sample.
It will cover a range of 'capitalizer' types roughly equivalent
to the range you will find in any other random sample you may

I don't know about you guys. Surely, you've spent enough time at HLAS to
understand that no one who wrote anything between 1550 and 1650 in England did
so without trying to tell us who the True Author was. And that there is NEVER a
mundane reason for anything. If not for that, though, BB's explanation of the
tall T makes all kinds of sense.

Extension of dialogue:

Fred, later, suddenly wacking Barney: You idiot! You didn't capitalize &quot;Name,&quot;
which is the most important word in this inscription! Now that &quot;Tombe&quot; is
capitalized everybody trying to solve the riddle will get confused!

Barney: That's okay. We don't want anyone to solve it until the 20th century,
when things have calmed down a bit. Otherwise I would have capitalized all of
the first three letters of &quot;whose&quot;--and added a question mark.

I'm no longer able to keep up with this discussion, but am going to throw an
observation in, anyway. It seems to me that Clark is saying Peter is wrong
because his statistical analysis wrongly considers two diverse populations to be
one. I don't know the technical term for this error, but it is the reason many
statistical studies are wrong, and ALL statistical studies too suspect to use
for more than suggesting areas that might merit better analysis. In any event,
I (not surprisingly) agree with Clark.

Peter,

I'll respond to your post in more depth later. But first, a couple of
clarifications; the first being one that I need from you, the other about my

Where? If you've given a convincing explanation, it hasn't showed up on my

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 'He' - As neither would show it, so UNUSUAL

"/>

Sorry, Peter. I may not have been clear here. I didn't include &quot;He&quot; in my
list of what a liberal capitalizer would have capitalized because I chose to
address it in my remarks on Heywood's poem. I haven't seen enough examples
to know whether or not &quot;He&quot; might be capitalized by a liberal capitalizer.
Though I do note that in the 1692 version of *Poetaster* it's often
capitalized after a semi-colon
( ) which isn't something
that we'd do now.

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You are on record as saying that you &quot;believe that the
&gt; inscription was most likely written by Ben Jonson&quot;, and this
&gt; is something on which we can agree.

"/>

Actually, I'm not so sure that Ben wrote it. The original reason I thought
that perhaps he did was because the &quot;Stay passenger...read&quot; bit was similar
to what he used in the 1628 epitaph for Lord La-Ware. But I've been reading
a lot of Jonson lately, and nothing else that I've read so far sounds like
the monument inscription.

Also, I'm *now* on record as saying that the construction of the clause that
begins with &quot;Sieh&quot; is pretty much an exact parallel to Ford's construction
of the clause that begins with &quot;Since&quot; in his epitaph on Jonson. That
doesn't mean that I now think that Ford wrote the inscription, but it does
mean that I no longer find my original reason for ascribing it to Jonson to
be compelling.

It goes with the territory for you not to be convinced by my
argument, of course. I have, however, explained why 'sith'
would at that time have been taken to be a conjunction rather
than an adverb. The capitalization of 'Sieh' would in those
circumstances have been unusual. The use of sith as an adverb
(and thus the capitalization) would have also been most unusual.
You will refuse to accept that, of course, but you can hardly
expect me to accept an argument of yours that is based upon
that refusal.

I, on the other hand, believe that I have. In my sample, the
word 'he' (or 'hee') appeared 6,211 times. Eliminating those
which either start a line of verse or a sentence, there are
*5,268* left. Other than the five which appear in Heywood's
poem, *not one* of them has an initial capital.

As you said, you haven't seen enough examples. And 1692

Without thinking it over at great length, I think there was one carver going
from a written text; he got all the words right except &quot;sith,&quot; and the
punctuation as the text had it, or maybe he had screwball ideas about commas,
and he capitalized more or less randomly, believing capitalization didn't
matter. I feel his greatest need was to make the lines fit on the monument. So

His &quot;acknowledged&quot; poems include a large number of epitaphs and epigrams.
His &quot;Works&quot; have been expanded by subsequent editors to include practically
anything signed &quot;B.I.&quot; or said to be by Jonson (including an epitaph or
two). None of the collections, to my knowledge, include the inscription

"/>

No, this is what I dispute. If you're relying on what the OED said, I
believe that you've misinterpreted the reference. The complete OED gives 10
examples of the word &quot;sith&quot; being used to express &quot;time&quot; in the years
between 1520 to 1670. It gives only 3 examples of it being used to express
&quot;cause&quot; during this time period. If we go by the OED, the MOST common use
of the word &quot;sith&quot; during this time period would be to express &quot;time.&quot;

If you're relying on how YOU think the reader of the time would have
understood the usage, then you've given no evidence to support your claim.
My position is that the context of the usage *requires* that the reader take
it as an adverb. Let me give you a demonstration of what I mean.

Imagine that the answer to a question is &quot;She'd read the report.&quot; How would
we pronounce the word &quot;read&quot; in this sentence? The answer, of course, is
that it depends on the context.

If the question was &quot;Did Sheila read the report before going into the
meeting?&quot; The pronunciation would be &quot;red&quot;. &quot;She had read the report.&quot;

If the question was &quot;What would Sheila do if I gave her this report?&quot; The
pronunciation would be &quot;reed&quot;. &quot;She would read the report.&quot;

The proper pronunciation depends upon the context. But see what happens
when we're given the context to begin with:

&quot;Tom looked at Mel nervously. Sheila's performance in the meeting had
almost guaranteed that they would not receive the funding that their
division so desperately needed. 'Did she even read the report before the
meeting started?' He asked Mel.
'She'd read it,' Mel replied, 'she just didn't understand it.'&quot;

In this example, we'd know that the &quot;read&quot; in &quot;She'd read it&quot; was pronounced
&quot;red&quot; without even thinking about it. The context demands that it be
pronounced that way.

Similarly, it's my position that when the contemporary reader saw the word
&quot;Sith&quot; capitalized following a colon, he or she would know that the word was
being used as an adverb. The context would demand it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ...The capitalization of 'Sieh' would in those
&gt; circumstances have been unusual. The use of sith as an adverb
&gt; (and thus the capitalization) would have also been most unusual...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You will refuse to accept that, of course, but you can hardly

My refusal would be based on the fact that you've either misinterpreted the

&gt;&gt;&gt; 'He' - As neither would show it, so UNUSUAL

&gt;&gt; Sorry, Peter. I may not have been clear here. I didn't
&gt;&gt; include &quot;He&quot; in my list of what a liberal capitalizer would
&gt;&gt; have capitalized because I chose to address it in my remarks
&gt;&gt; on Heywood's poem. I haven't seen enough examples to know
&gt;&gt; whether or not &quot;He&quot; might be capitalized by a liberal
&gt;&gt; capitalizer.

&gt; I, on the other hand, believe that I have. In my sample, the
&gt; word 'he' (or 'hee') appeared 6,211 times. Eliminating those
&gt; which either start a line of verse or a sentence, there are
&gt; *5,268* left. Other than the five which appear in Heywood's
&gt; poem, *not one* of them has an initial capital.

&gt;&gt; Though I do note that in the 1692 version of *Poetaster*
&gt;&gt; it's often capitalized after a semi-colon
&gt;&gt; ( http://www.hollowaypages.com/jonson1692poetaster.htm )
&gt;&gt; which isn't something that we'd do now.

&gt; As you said, you haven't seen enough examples. And 1692
&gt; is a bit late, you know. Terry even took me to task for
&gt; searching the First Folio for examples, as it had not
&gt; been published when the monument was designed.

"/>

No disrespect intended to Terry, but his limitation here seems to be of the
same type that Foster originally made in his misattribution of &quot;A Funeral
Elegy&quot; by W.S. The year 1616 had no relevance to the development and use of
the English language as it was going on at the time. Regardless of whether
a particular usage is contained in one of the (very) few remaining
publications from the period prior to 1616, if it occurs in a publication of
1623 (or 1637, as in the case of Ford's epitaph) there's no logical reason
to suppose that it didn't occur prior to that. Absence of evidence is not
evidence of absence, as they say.

And yes, I do acknowledge that 1692 is a bit late. However, the reasons
that I chose it as my example are:

1) The extremes in &quot;liberal capitalization&quot; that it uses are known to have
existed in Shakespeare's time (as witnessed by Heywood's liberal use of
initial capitals in his elegy);
2) Since it is a reprint of a text published in 1616 that was supervised by
a &quot;pedantic capitalizer&quot;, it gives an excellent opportunity for comparison;
and
3) It's a text that is readily available to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; You are on record as saying that you &quot;believe that the
&gt;&gt;&gt; inscription was most likely written by Ben Jonson&quot;, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; this is something on which we can agree.

&gt;&gt; Actually, I'm not so sure that Ben wrote it.

&gt; I had a sneaky feeling that this might be the case.

"/>

I hate to tell you this, but my change of opinion has a lot more to do with
my recent transcription of every extant play that Jonson wrote than it does
to this particular discussion. I blush to admit that when I originally
stated with so much confidence that I felt Jonson was the most likely
author, I had read only about 3 of his plays and probably less than a dozen
of his poems. In hindsight, it was a shockingly ignorant observation to
make.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The original reason I thought that perhaps he did was
&gt;&gt; because the &quot;Stay passenger...read&quot; bit was similar to what
&gt;&gt; he used in the 1628 epitaph for Lord La-Ware. But I've
&gt;&gt; been reading a lot of Jonson lately, and nothing else that
&gt;&gt; I've read so far sounds like the monument inscription.

&gt; No, and I bet his use of initial capitals differs from it
&gt; too.

"/>

This bit doesn't matter. As I said, we have evidence that Jonson carefully
shepherded the publication of his 1616 folio through the printing process.
In publications where he had little or no active involvement, the
capitalization appears to have been done at the whim of the printer. Even
if Jonson had written the inscription, unless he had been standing over Fred
and Barney as they chipped it out on the monument (as your theory requires),
there's little reason to suppose that they would have followed the
capitalization in the original manuscript.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Also, I'm *now* on record as saying that the construction
&gt;&gt; of the clause that begins with &quot;Sieh&quot; is pretty much an
&gt;&gt; exact parallel to Ford's construction of the clause that
&gt;&gt; begins with &quot;Since&quot; in his epitaph on Jonson. That doesn't
&gt;&gt; mean that I now think that Ford wrote the inscription, but
&gt;&gt; it does mean that I no longer find my original reason for
&gt;&gt; ascribing it to Jonson to be compelling.

&gt; My own view on this had rather more to do with his apparent
&gt; enthusiasm for Shakespeare, his prominent role in the First
&gt; Folio, and his alleged visit to Stratford just before
&gt; Shakespeare's death.

"/>

Countering this, I'd suggest, is the fact that Jonson wasn't bashful about
claiming authorship for anything that he had written, and nothing that he
left behind even suggested that he had ever claimed credit for the
inscription.

He included epitaphs that he had written for others in his &quot;Epigrams&quot;
published in 1616 (such as the one on his son, and the one on his daughter).
The other poems that he left behind, including later epitaphs (such as the
one to Lord La-Ware and the one to Philip Gray), were published in the
collection &quot;Underwoods&quot; shortly after his death.

If he had included a copy of the monument's epitaph in his papers, or if any
of his survivors knew that he had written it, it would most likely have
appeared in &quot;Underwoods.&quot; Later editions of Jonson's works, such as the
Gifford edition of 1816, added Jonson's Shakespeare poems from F1 to the
collection of his works, as well as manuscript poems that had turned up in
the intervening years (some of doubtful attribution, according to later
editors). From what I've seen, nobody has ever included the epitaph from
the monument among Jonson's works.

You're right. Perhaps I've given you too much credit. On the other
hand, this may just be another example of your own inconsistent
thinking (see below).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; While Peter and I agree that the capitalization, if such it
&gt;&gt; is, is inconsistent, we disagree vehemently as to the reason
&gt;&gt; why. For the most part, where I think Peter went wrong in
&gt;&gt; his thinking was in his reliance on the statistics he derived
&gt;&gt; from a 67,000 line sample of Elizabethan verse.

&gt; Well, let's sort that one out straight away. My 'sample'
&gt; consisted of just under 57,000 (not 67,000) lines of rhymed
&gt; verse dated from the 30 or so years preceding 1616, which
&gt; purported to show the original text, and which I was able to
&gt; find on the internet at the time I was doing these counts.

"/>

I got the 67,000 lines from your statement on 11/1/02:
&lt;quote&gt;
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In a sample of 57 thousand lines of verse from that
&gt;&gt; period, now supplemented by the complete First Folio,
&gt;&gt; (another 10 thousand at least) *not one* of the 826
&gt;&gt; occasions when the words 'sith', 'sithence' or 'since'
&gt;&gt; are used can be shown to match the way in which the
&gt;&gt; word 'sith' (if that is what was intended) is given
&gt;&gt; on the monument.

"/>

&lt;/quote&gt;

57,000 + &quot;at least&quot; 10,000 = &quot;at least&quot; 67,000. At least it does as
we're taught arithmetic in US grammar schools.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I don't believe that Peter properly adjusted his sample to
&gt;&gt; take into account the known variations in the application of
&gt;&gt; the capitalization rules of the era, so his statistics are
&gt;&gt; grossly misleading. In particular, they have grossly misled
&gt;&gt; *him*.

&gt; Since I didn't 'adjust' it at all, you are right to say that
&gt; I didn't adjust it 'properly'. You don't adjust samples, Clark.
&gt; You may need to stratify or weight them occasionally, but only
&gt; if you know there to be an otherwise unavoidable reason that
&gt; your sample will not fairly represent the whole. Since on this
&gt; occasion the sample *was* the whole lot available to me, and I
&gt; had no reason to suspect that it was unrepresentative, I left
&gt; it untampered with in any way.

"/>

Your sample does not fairly represent the whole, because neither
&quot;pedantic capitalization&quot; or &quot;liberal capitalization&quot; would have been
thought unusual at the time. Your statistics suggest that &quot;liberal
capitalization&quot; would have been thought highly unusual. But there's
no evidence that people made fun of Heywood because of his liberal
capitalization in his elegy. Nor did anyone remark on the &quot;unusual&quot;
capitalization in F1, which is midway between the extremes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It was therefore as near as I could get to a completely random
&gt; sample of the way rhymed verse was actually being printed at
&gt; that time, and with which one might reasonably expect an
&gt; educated reader to have been familiar.

"/>

No, a reasonably educated reader could be expected to be familiar with
both styles of punctuation. Your statistics do not show that to be
true, therefore your statistics are flawed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; First, we should probably ask ourselves if there *were* any
&gt;&gt; capitalization rules of that era. Luckily, there happens to
&gt;&gt; be a clearly expressed rule in what I believe was the very
&gt;&gt; first book of English grammar that was ever printed.

&gt;&gt; In his &quot;An Execration upon Vulcan,&quot; Ben Jonson tells us that
&gt;&gt; the fire that swept his study late in his life took with it
&gt;&gt;&quot;a grammar&quot; that he had been working on that would &quot;teach some
&gt;&gt; that their nurses could not do, the purity of Language.&quot;
&gt;&gt; Fortunately for us, either Ben had been mistaken, or he
&gt;&gt; decided to reconstruct his grammar after the flames had died
&gt;&gt; down, for in the 1640 folio of Jonson's &quot;Works,&quot; printed 3
&gt;&gt; years after his death, appeared a piece entitled &quot;The English
&gt;&gt; Grammar.&quot;

&gt;&gt; In Chapter II of this short work, entitled &quot;Of Letters and
&gt;&gt; their Powers,&quot; he wrote:

&gt;&gt;&quot;In our language we use these twenty and four letters, A. B.
&gt;&gt; C. D. E. F. G. H. I. K. L. M. N. O. P. Q. R. S. T. V. W. X.
&gt;&gt; Y. Z. a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h. i. k. l. m. n. o. p. q. r. s.
&gt;&gt; t. v. w. x. y. z. The great letters serve to begin sentences,
&gt;&gt; with us, to lead proper names, and express numbers. The
&gt;&gt; less make the fabric of speech.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Pretty straight forward. Letters at the beginning of sentences,
&gt;&gt; beginning proper nouns,

&gt; He said &quot;proper names&quot;, which may or may not be significant.

"/>

Perhaps. Except that &quot;proper names&quot; and &quot;proper nouns&quot; are used
synonymusly in the OED, and were apparently used interchangeably in
the examples given by the OED:

c1290 S. Eng. Leg. I. 462/18 Heo was icleoped in *propre name* ‘þe
Maudeleyne'.
c1440 Promp. Parv. 70/1 Charlys, *propyr name*, Carolus.
1551 T. Wilson Logike (1580) 4 b, In this Proposition Cato is the
*Nowne proper*, whiche belongeth to one manne onely.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; and expressing numbers (presumably
&gt;&gt; Roman numerals) are all capitalized (i.e., are &quot;great&quot;).
&gt;&gt; The rest are all lower case (i.e. &quot;less&quot;).
&gt;&gt; So where does the room for variation come in?

&gt; Was there any earlier attempt to present such rules? You think
&gt; not, in which case the variation was the current state that
&gt; Jonson was trying to improve.

"/>

Apparently it was the first attempt at a published grammar, but no, it
wasn't that Jonson was trying to improve the current usage. It looks
like you may have been misled here by the quote that I gave from
Jonson's &quot;Execration.&quot; On the title page to &quot;The English Grammar&quot;, as
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
published, Jonson wrote: &quot;Made by Ben Jonson for the benefit of all

"/>

Strangers, out of his observation of the English Language now spoken,
and in use.&quot; In fact, there is a Latin parallel text for the first
few chapters of the &quot;Grammar&quot; because he had intended it to be used by
educated foreigners who wanted to learn English.

Also, note that on the bit about the use of letters he wrote &quot;The
great letters serve to begin sentences, *with us*...&quot; He was telling
the &quot;strangers&quot; what the current usage was, not what he wished it to
be.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I'm not much of a grammarian, so I'd appreciate it if anyone
&gt;&gt; wishes to step in here and give me some help, but from what
&gt;&gt; I've seen there seems to be two possibilities:

&gt;&gt; 1) There was a variation in understanding as to what kinds
&gt;&gt; of nouns constituted &quot;proper nouns&quot;; or

&gt;&gt; 2) Some people just capitalized all nouns, despite what old
&gt;&gt; Ben thought about it.

&gt; Well, in 1616 it seems unlikely that anyone except Jonson
&gt; would have known what he thought about it. (Which raises an
&gt; interesting thought that I'll come back to later).

&gt;&gt; Personally, I suspect that #1 is the most likely.

&gt; That rather depends upon whether there was any concept of
&gt; 'proper names' before this work of Jonson's came out. If you
&gt; mean that there was no generally accepted rule as to which
&gt; nouns should be capitalized, however, I would agree. It's
&gt; tautological.

"/>

As demonstrated by the OED, there was a concept of &quot;proper names&quot;
prior to Jonson. I'm just not sure that everybody defined it the same
way (and Jonson didn't bother to give a definition in his Grammar).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Although there is plenty of variation, it appears to me
&gt;&gt; that there was a tendency in the writings I've seen to
&gt;&gt; consider nouns that referred to a specific thing as a
&gt;&gt;&quot;proper noun&quot;, at least for purposes of capitalization,
&gt;&gt; even if the thing did not have a specific name (such as
&gt;&gt;&quot;George&quot;). For example, a reference to *that* Tomb in
&gt;&gt; particular might be capitalized, whereas a reference to
&gt;&gt; just any tombs in general would not be.

&gt; Funnily enough, this was an idea I too was following up at
&gt; one time, but it seemed to break down in practice.

"/>

Yes, as I said, there's plenty of variation. But is the variation due
to compositors errors, or something else?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; So if my understanding of how capitalization was applied is
&gt;&gt; correct, then Peter's statistics are virtually meaningless
&gt;&gt; without knowing more about the works from which his sample was
&gt;&gt; derived.

&gt; If your understanding of how capitalization was applied is
&gt; correc, my statistics take account of it, by examining what the
&gt; overall *practice* was at the time we are talking about.

"/>

Again, no. Your statistics show the usage in an extremely limited
sample of text (if you're estimate for the line content of F1 is
correct, your 57,000-line sample represents less than 6 books of F1
size). And as I believe Terry has already mentioned, what you were
able to find isn't even a truly random sample. The texts selected for
uploading to the Internet were ones that have interest and relevance
to 21st century man. There's no reason to think someone from the 17th
century would agree that those same texts were representative of the
texts that interested them.

For example, I imagine that most of the people of the time were
familiar with the Bible. Take a look at the title page on the right
from this 1615 Bible that I found on eBay:

Notice how the words Meeter, Notes, Sung, Churches, Morning, Evening,
Sermons, Houses, Songs, Ballads, etc. are capitalized. Since everyone
who was literate presumably had a Bible, how unusual would such usage
have appeared?

I have given evidence to support the claim that easily the
most common usage of the word 'sith' was as a conjunction.

&quot;Looking at my 67,000 line sample, for example, I find the
word 'sith' used 205 times. Of these, there are a couple
I really can't be sure about, 185 are fairly clearly
conjunctions, whereas only 18 are adverbs. This may
not seem too bad, but all except *one* of the latter is
from Edmund Spenser, and 14 of them in the deliberately
archaic *The Faerie Queene*.

(My original sample - the one in my paper - was of about
57,000 lines of rhymed verse. Occasionally since then I
augment it with the whole of the First Folio, as here.
I've no idea where the 67,000 came from).

Yes, I understood the point you were trying to make. What
you totally ignore, however, is that it was virtually
unheard of to start a sentence with 'sith' as an adverb.
Neither in my 57,000 line sample of rhymed verse, nor in
the First Folio (what, another 100,000 lines or so?) does
it *ever* happen.

826 times either 'sith', 'sithence' or 'since' occurs,
and *not once* is 'sith' used as an adverb at the start
of a sentence. In fact, the *only* case that I am aware
of is the single example you quote from the OED, below,
from some 80 years earlier: &quot;Syth our fyrst acquyntance...&quot;

&gt; I really can't be sure about, 185 are fairly clearly
&gt; conjunctions, whereas only 18 are adverbs. This may
&gt; not seem too bad, but all except *one* of the latter is
&gt; from Edmund Spenser, and 14 of them in the deliberately
&gt; archaic *The Faerie Queene*.

"/>

Peter, I believe that we long ago agreed that the use of the word &quot;sith&quot; in
the inscription was unusual to the degree that the word was rapidly going
out of vogue at the time. However, I have no reason to believe that a
reader of the time wouldn't have known that &quot;sith&quot; meant the same thing as
&quot;since&quot;, in both of its usages, so what possible difference could it make as
to how many times you were able to find the word &quot;sith&quot; as a capitalized
adverb? If the reader was familiar with the word &quot;Since&quot; being a
capitalized adverb, he or she would have made the mental adjustment and gone
on.

Before you tell me how many capitalized &quot;Since&quot;s you found, I'd point out
that regardless of your statistics, the usage doesn't appear to have been
all that uncommon. Check out the Project Gutenberg Etext of The Holy Bible,
Douay-Rheims Version, 1609-1610 edition, at:

&quot;Since&quot; is used several times as an adverb expressing time in this version,
and starts a sentence, quotation, or follows a colon 6 times, 4 of which are
capitalized.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (My original sample - the one in my paper - was of about
&gt; 57,000 lines of rhymed verse. Occasionally since then I
&gt; augment it with the whole of the First Folio, as here.
&gt; I've no idea where the 67,000 came from).

"/>

I posted a quote from you regarding the 67,000 count in my other response.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; My position is that the context of the usage *requires*
&gt;&gt; that the reader take it as an adverb.

&gt;&lt;example snipped&gt;

&gt;&gt; Similarly, it's my position that when the contemporary
&gt;&gt; reader saw the word &quot;Sith&quot; capitalized following a colon,
&gt;&gt; he or she would know that the word was being used as an
&gt;&gt; adverb. The context would demand it.

&gt; Yes, I understood the point you were trying to make. What
&gt; you totally ignore, however, is that it was virtually
&gt; unheard of to start a sentence with 'sith' as an adverb.
&gt; Neither in my 57,000 line sample of rhymed verse, nor in
&gt; the First Folio (what, another 100,000 lines or so?) does
&gt; it *ever* happen.

"/>

In November 02, you said F1 had 10,000 or so lines. If F1 has 100,000 or so
lines, then your sample size represents less than 2/3 of F1! And you think
that's a statistically valid sample? If you're a professional statistician,
I'd suggest that you might want to find another line of work.

Again, I maintain that a reader of the time would know that &quot;sith&quot; and
&quot;since&quot; were equivalent, and would make the mental adjustment without even
noticing it. As I mentioned above, &quot;since&quot; starts a sentence as an adverb
at least 6 times in the 1609/1610 Bible posted at Project Gutenberg.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 826 times either 'sith', 'sithence' or 'since' occurs,
&gt; and *not once* is 'sith' used as an adverb at the start
&gt; of a sentence. In fact, the *only* case that I am aware
&gt; of is the single example you quote from the OED, below,
&gt; from some 80 years earlier: &quot;Syth our fyrst acquyntance...&quot;

&gt; Even if grammatically correct, therefore, it is clear that
&gt; for anyone *seeking* unusual initial capitals, this one
&gt; would have stood out like a statistician on HLAS.

"/>

Peter, your fixation on the capitalization of &quot;sith&quot; is truly baffling. If
someone were attempting to draw attention to the word, what more is
necessary than the obvious misspelling? As far as I can see, your
insistence that the capitalization be considered &quot;unusual&quot; is because it
fits your theory that the odd capitalization practices are the *sole* clue
that a riddle exists. But other than your desire that this be true, what
rule is there that says that a riddle maker must leave only one sort of
clue?

There is no &quot;riddle&quot;, of course, but your fixation on the capitalization
issue is bordering on monomania.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'He' - As neither would show it, so UNUSUAL

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, Peter. I may not have been clear here. I didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; include &quot;He&quot; in my list of what a liberal capitalizer would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have capitalized because I chose to address it in my remarks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on Heywood's poem. I haven't seen enough examples to know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whether or not &quot;He&quot; might be capitalized by a liberal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; capitalizer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I, on the other hand, believe that I have. In my sample, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; word 'he' (or 'hee') appeared 6,211 times. Eliminating those
&gt;&gt;&gt; which either start a line of verse or a sentence, there are
&gt;&gt;&gt; *5,268* left. Other than the five which appear in Heywood's
&gt;&gt;&gt; poem, *not one* of them has an initial capital.

&gt; Your silence in response to this is noted. Not once in
&gt; *five thousand two hundred and sixty-eight* examples?
&gt; If that doesn't make it unusual, what the hell would?

"/>

My silence here is because I chose to address this in my other post, which
you may have seen by now. &quot;Olympus Habet&quot;, you know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, I'm not so sure that Ben wrote it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I had a sneaky feeling that this might be the case.

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, and I bet his use of initial capitals differs
&gt;&gt;&gt; from it too.

&gt;&gt; This bit doesn't matter.

&gt; I know. It was just my little joke. I was originally making
&gt; a point based upon your stated opinion as to who was the
&gt; most likely author of the poem on the monument. If you no
&gt; longer think that, there's no point in discussing it further.

"/>

I don't know that it *wasn't* written by Jonson, I'm just no longer sure. I
would note that he doesn't use the word &quot;sith&quot; even once in any of his
plays. I haven't read (let alone transcribed) all of his poetry yet, so
I'll be watching for it as my project progresses. If it doesn't show up at
all in his surviving works, the outlook for his authorship of the
inscription will sink even further in my opinion.

&gt;&gt; Well, let's sort that one out straight away. My 'sample'

&gt;&gt; purported to show the original text, and which I was able to
&gt;&gt; find on the internet at the time I was doing these counts.

&gt; I got the 67,000 lines from your statement on 11/1/02:
&gt;&lt;quote&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; In a sample of 57 thousand lines of verse from that

&gt;&gt;&gt; word 'sith' (if that is what was intended) is given
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the monument.
&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;

&gt; 57,000 + &quot;at least&quot; 10,000 = &quot;at least&quot; 67,000. At least
&gt; it does as we're taught arithmetic in US grammar schools.

Ah, I see. That was a typo, of course. The FF is nearer 100

&gt;&gt;&gt; *him*.

&gt;&gt; Since I didn't 'adjust' it at all, you are right to say that

&gt;&gt; You may need to stratify or weight them occasionally, but only

&gt;&gt; your sample will not fairly represent the whole. Since on this
&gt;&gt; occasion the sample *was* the whole lot available to me, and I
&gt;&gt; had no reason to suspect that it was unrepresentative, I left
&gt;&gt; it untampered with in any way.

&gt; Your sample does not fairly represent the whole, because neither
&gt;&quot;pedantic capitalization&quot; or &quot;liberal capitalization&quot; would have
&gt; been thought unusual at the time.

"/>

Who said either of them *would* have been thought unusual?
That *neither* of them would have been thought so is, of course,
the whole point, and right at the heart of my argument!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your statistics suggest that &quot;liberal
&gt; capitalization&quot; would have been thought highly unusual.

"/>

Do they? I wasn't aware of it.

Look again, for example, at some of the the sample's 'people'
nouns as listed in my Appendix:

Man, Paramour, Lover, Sutor, Bridegrome, Infant, Orphane,
Parent, Father, Syre, Grandsyre, Knight, Squire, Page, Lord,
Maister, Hero, Traitor, Giant, Dwarf, Victor, Champion,
Courtier, Patron, Archdeacon, Curate, Novice, Psalmist,
Chorister, Palmer, Pilgrim, Poet, Author, Painter, Minstrel,
Architect, Apprentice, Merchant, Souldier, Archer, Clerke,
Fisher, Shepheard, Porter, Vassall, Begger, Carle, Spectator
and Looker-on.

You may indeed like to add on a few not listed there:

Powers, Iustice, Foxe, Grandams, Enchanter, Ladies, Altars,
Queene, Firmament, Briton, Northside, Pine, Rose, Cedar,
Elme, Poplar, Oake, Aspine, Cypresse, Laurell, Firre, Willow,
Nimph, Ape, Thunders, Cittie, Beasts, Fast, Fortune, Sun.
Beautie, Giantess, West, Castell, Monster, Lions, and Dame.

Would you describe them as being more 'pedantic' or more
'liberal' in their capitalization?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; No, a reasonably educated reader could be expected to be

&gt; Your statistics do not show that to be true, therefore your

&gt;&gt;&gt; Pretty straight forward. Letters at the beginning of sentences,

&gt; Perhaps. Except that &quot;proper names&quot; and &quot;proper nouns&quot; are used
&gt; synonymusly in the OED, and were apparently used interchangeably in
&gt; the examples given by the OED:

&gt; c1290 S. Eng. Leg. I. 462/18 Heo was icleoped in *propre name* 'þe
&gt; Maudeleyne'.
&gt; c1440 Promp. Parv. 70/1 Charlys, *propyr name*, Carolus.
&gt; 1551 T. Wilson Logike (1580) 4 b, In this Proposition Cato is the

"/>

Fair enough. I wasn't arguing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; and expressing numbers (presumably
&gt;&gt;&gt; Roman numerals) are all capitalized (i.e., are &quot;great&quot;).
&gt;&gt;&gt; The rest are all lower case (i.e. &quot;less&quot;).
&gt;&gt;&gt; So where does the room for variation come in?

&gt;&gt; Was there any earlier attempt to present such rules? You think
&gt;&gt; not, in which case the variation was the current state that
&gt;&gt; Jonson was trying to improve.

&gt; Apparently it was the first attempt at a published grammar, but no, it
&gt; wasn't that Jonson was trying to improve the current usage. It looks
&gt; like you may have been misled here by the quote that I gave from
&gt; Jonson's &quot;Execration.&quot; On the title page to &quot;The English Grammar&quot;, as
&gt; published, Jonson wrote: &quot;Made by Ben Jonson for the benefit of all
&gt; Strangers, out of his observation of the English Language now spoken,
&gt; and in use.&quot; In fact, there is a Latin parallel text for the first
&gt; few chapters of the &quot;Grammar&quot; because he had intended it to be used by
&gt; educated foreigners who wanted to learn English.

&gt; Also, note that on the bit about the use of letters he wrote &quot;The
&gt; great letters serve to begin sentences, *with us*...&quot; He was telling
&gt; the &quot;strangers&quot; what the current usage was, not what he wished it to
&gt; be.

"/>

That's interesting - thanks. Also interesting, therefore, is
that *his* view of what the current usage 'with us' was, erred
markedly (according to you) on the 'pedantic' side. Clearly not
as in touch with what was really going on then as you are!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not much of a grammarian, so I'd appreciate it if anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt; wishes to step in here and give me some help, but from what
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've seen there seems to be two possibilities:

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) There was a variation in understanding as to what kinds
&gt;&gt;&gt; of nouns constituted &quot;proper nouns&quot;; or

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Some people just capitalized all nouns, despite what old
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ben thought about it.

&gt;&gt; Well, in 1616 it seems unlikely that anyone except Jonson
&gt;&gt; would have known what he thought about it. (Which raises an
&gt;&gt; interesting thought that I'll come back to later).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally, I suspect that #1 is the most likely.

&gt;&gt; That rather depends upon whether there was any concept of
&gt;&gt; 'proper names' before this work of Jonson's came out. If you
&gt;&gt; mean that there was no generally accepted rule as to which
&gt;&gt; nouns should be capitalized, however, I would agree. It's
&gt;&gt; tautological.

&gt; As demonstrated by the OED, there was a concept of &quot;proper names&quot;
&gt; prior to Jonson. I'm just not sure that everybody defined it the same
&gt; way (and Jonson didn't bother to give a definition in his Grammar).

"/>

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If your understanding of how capitalization was applied is
&gt;&gt; correct, my statistics take account of it, by examining what the
&gt;&gt; overall *practice* was at the time we are talking about.

&gt; Again, no. Your statistics show the usage in an extremely limited
&gt; sample of text (if you're estimate for the line content of F1 is
&gt; correct, your 57,000-line sample represents less than 6 books of F1
&gt; size).

"/>

No Clark, it is in fact equivalent to less than a half of one
First Folio. But this is hilarious! As perfect an example of
prejudice as one could ever hope to find. A 'sample' of such a
size would have been *huge*. That you you found it inadequate
has everything to say about your total ignorance of statistical
inference, and nothing at all about finding the truth, should
you ever be interested in discovering what that might be.

In fact, why don't you explain to us (in statistical terms)
just why you say that such a sample size (some 600,000 lines!)
would have been inadequate?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And as I believe Terry has already mentioned, what you were
&gt; able to find isn't even a truly random sample.

"/>

Of course it wasn't, and it didn't need Terry to tell any of
us that. Should anyone wonder, it is called a 'presenting
sample', But in the absence of any other easily analysed
'original text' available to me, it was the best around. And in
the absence of any apparent reason why it should not have been
used, clearly acceptable. To prove that it is *not* a fair
representation of the overall population, however, you will
have to take a 'truly' random (not as easy as you might think)
sample of rhymed verse from the period, and show statistically
where mine failed to represent it. Good luck!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;from the Shakespeare monument.

&gt; I believe Jonson would have printed the inscription had it been his.
Final
&gt; question: have scholars attributed any unsigned poems to Jonson?

"/>

Jonson's first folio, the one that he personally supervised, was printed in
1616. It may have gone to press prior to Shakespeare's death, for all I
know. Jonson was at least somewhat involved in the publication of a few
quartos that were printed after 1616, but the next full collection of his
work was the two-volume second folio of 1640, published 3 years after his
death. Jonson had prepared and printed some of his later plays for the
second folio several years in advance (as evidenced by the dates on the
title pages), and the pieces that had been published in quarto form were
also added to the collection, but a considerable chunk of the second folio
was from papers that Jonson had left behind.

Oddly enough, a small number of poems that are generally believed to have
been by John Donne were included in the second folio, most likely because
Jonson had manuscript copies of them in his possession and they had been
gathered up along with the rest of his papers by his &quot;literary executors&quot;
(one of the poems had previously been published under Donne's name).

It is quite possible that Jonson had written an epitaph or two that were
missed by his literary executors when his loose material was assembled for
the second folio. In fact, later editions of his work include an unsigned
epitaph that appears on the monument to Michael Drayton in Westminster
Abbey. There is general agreement that Jonson was the author. It's short,
so I'll give it here:

Epitaph on Michael Drayton

Do, pious marble, let thy readers know
What they, and what their children owe
To Drayton's name; whose sacred dust
We recommend unto thy trust.
Protect his memory, and preserve his story,
Remain a lasting monument of his glory.--
And when thy ruins shall disclaim
To be the treasurer of his name;
His name, that cannot die, shall be
An everlasting monument to thee.

Although this epitaph follows the more-or-less standard format of the genre,
and has a couple of ideas that may be superficially in common with the
inscription on Shakespeare's monument, it seems to me to be much more
gracefully written than the one to Shakespeare. You have a poet's ear, what
do you think?

Since Peter has decided to call this discussion to a premature end, I'll
respect his wishes and refrain from refuting the many points I disagree with
in his final post on the subject. However, since Peter feels it necessary to
lecture to us on the proper way to use statistics, I do not think it would
be fair to any who have followed this thread to let his most glaring error
pass without comment.

In his &quot;Appendix I&quot;, Peter gives us the breakdown of his 57,000 line
&quot;random&quot; sample of Elizabethan verse. But one can't help but notice that
46,546 of those lines, or about 82% of the total, come from the pen of one
man. Edmund Spenser. Of the remaining 8 authors on Peter's list, 6 are
represented by works of less than 1500 lines. 2 are represented by works of
less than 400 lines.

Of Spenser's total lines, 33,885 (about 73% of his lines) are from the
&quot;Faerie Queen.&quot; The &quot;Faerie Queen&quot; was published in two books in 1596, each
of which were printed for William Ponsonby.

Peter's &quot;random&quot; sample of verse is, in fact, mostly the work of one man and
one printer (or, at most, two printers, in the event Ponsonby farmed the two
volumes out to separate printers).

The statistics that he places so much reliance on are not from a &quot;random&quot;
sample of verse. At best, they overwhelmingly represent Spenser's
capitalization habits--or perhaps the capitalization habits of the
compositors from Ponsonby's print shop(s).

Perhaps Peter would care to suck on that for awhile. In the mean time, I'll
practice how to whistle.

Unorganized comments:

1. It isn't obvious that statistics derived from printed books are
applicable to tombs and monuments. I would guess that the
bookprinting trade was heavily concentrated in London, Oxford and
Cambridge, so I would expect their capitalization practice to be
influenced (toward standardization) by their neighbor-competitors.
Would the same be true of monument engravers? (Does anyone know where
Shakespeare's monument was made? Can the stone be traced to a
particular region?)

2. While Jonson mentions capitalization of nouns only, a casual
review shows that adjectives could also be capped. Browne's
Urne-Burial (1658) has many examples and few regularities: &quot;the
Sepulchrall Cells of Pismires&quot; is a nice phrase, though &quot;sepulchral&quot;
is not capitalized on nearby pages.

(I had to look it up: a pismire is an ant)

Adjectives like &quot;Noblest&quot; and &quot;Majestick&quot; are sometimes capitalized--I
suspect due to association with their noun forms.

On the first page of &quot;The Tempest&quot; I find &quot;for an Acre of barren
ground: Long heath, Brown firrs, any thing&quot;

3. The Tempest example also illustrates a modest tendency for
capitals to follow colons or even semicolons. Urne-Burial is awash
with them. This may have influenced the engraver's decision to
capitalize Sieh.

4. Glancing at the Riverside Shakespeare's transcript of Sir Thomas
More, one sees that the scribe, whoever he was, omits capitals from
the first word of almost every line, though he's clearly writing
verse. (One capitalized word in the middle of a line is a verb!). He
probably expected that if the play went to print, the printer would
take care of the typography. This warns us against assuming that the
monument-maker received a clean manuscript.

One speech in More is brought to a dramatic conclusion with a pair of
rhymed couplets. The preceding lines have lacked opening capitals for
a long stretch. Couplet line #1 also misses a capital, but lines
#2-#3-#4 have them. Cf. the monument.

(Back to &quot;sieh&quot; for a moment--the sample alphabet on pg. 1697 of
Riverside also shows how close a secretary-hand &quot;t&quot; can be to an &quot;e&quot;).

5. Peter overstates the ubiquity of the &quot;rhymed verse was expected to
have initial capitals&quot; rule. His raw figure is that it applies to
96.72% of his sample lines; he then argues that the median figure of
99.85% is more meaningful. That sounds impressive, but...his sample
comprises 33 whole works, and it is obvious that printers imposed
standards of typography on whole works for aesthetic reasons.

2 of the 33 works depart from the &quot;all initial capitals&quot; model.
That's more than 6.06%! In fact, 7 of the 31 other works are
individual books of the Faerie Queen (and being unusually long, their
line counts are skewing Peter's percentages). If we allow only one
entry for Faerie Queen, the ratio is 2 out of 27, or 7.40%.

6. If QUICK is a clue, why isn't its synonym LIVING a clue?

7. Just for fun: I was looking at the First Folio title page,
wondering whether to cite &quot;Published according to the True Originall
Copies&quot; as examples of adjective-capitals. My eye fell on the facing
page, containing B.I.'s poem &quot;To the Reader&quot;. Check it out!

This Figure, that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakespeare cut;
Wherein the Graver had a strife
with Nature, to out-doo the life:

Line 004 on Page 001, and someone has already screwed up the
capitalization!

&gt;Do, pious marble, let thy readers know
&gt;What they, and what their children owe
&gt;To Drayton's name; whose sacred dust

&gt;Protect his memory, and preserve his story,
&gt;Remain a lasting monument of his glory.--
&gt;And when thy ruins shall disclaim

&gt;His name, that cannot die, shall be
&gt;An everlasting monument to thee.

&gt;Although this epitaph follows the more-or-less standard format of the genre,
&gt;and has a couple of ideas that may be superficially in common with the
&gt;inscription on Shakespeare's monument, it seems to me to be much more
&gt;gracefully written than the one to Shakespeare. You have a poet's ear, what
&gt;do you think?

"/>

--Clark

Not sure about the ear, but I agree with you about the poem to Drayton. It's
much smoother than the one to Shakespeare. On the other hand, the latter seems
to me to be straining to say more, and to say it uncommonly, so if I didn't know
who wrote either, I might claim that the poet who made the poem to Shakespeare
was probably a better poet. Interesting that the Drayton piece does not mention
that Drayton was a writer. WHY NOT!!!!???

QUICK refers to the Marlowe sharing the tombe (or something) with Shakespeare;
LIVING is not so direct a clue. I still feel NAME is the word that most
warrants capitalization as a clue, but several other words warrant it as much or
more than the ones Peter thinks the most important clues.

He'd probably say he was only denigrating your opinion, not YOU! Emily posters
seem to think that belittling an opponents' thought processes is not belittling
the opponents--though I recognize the difference between an insane person and a
person with one or more insane ideas.

By the way, I expect to add your interpretation of &quot;sieh&quot; to my discussion in my
Shakespeare authorship book of the inscription as the &quot;Holloway Solution.&quot; I'm
not asking permission to do this, but will do it whatever you say! Unless you

On the subject of the Stratford monument, Peter, given the strange opening,
&quot;STAY PASSENGER WHY GOEST THOU BY SO FAST&quot;, I know this proves nothing - but
it is perhaps quite worthy of note....

Of the other main contenders for the authorship, I wonder if any such lines
have been written of them? Anything sounding akin to the above? Of Francis
Bacon, in the Manes Verulamiani (1626) or book of elegies upon his death,
Elegy 23 by an anonymous writer goes:

&quot;Think you, foolish traveller, that the leader of the choir of the Muses and
of Phoebus is interred in cold marble? Away, you are deceived.&quot;

Here we have the notion of a traveller (thereby passing by) a tomb. Yet
within this tomb, in terms of mortal remains at least, is the &quot;*leader* of
the choir of the Muses&quot;! Why would Bacon be considered the leader of poets?
Anyway, there's the same notion of catching someone's attention as they pass
by the tomb.

In the same book of elegies, Thomas Vincent wrote:

&quot;Some there are though dead live in marble, and trust all their duration to
long lasting columns; others shine in bronze, or are beheld in yellow gold,
and deceiving themselves think they deceive the fates. Another division of
men surviving in a numerous offspring, like Niobe irreverent, despise the
mighty gods; but your fame adheres not to sculptured columns, nor is read on
the tomb, 'Stay, traveller, your steps'... &quot;

In Stratford: &quot;STAY PASSENGER WHY GOEST THOU BY SO FAST&quot;. Of Bacon (but
*not* on *his* tomb): 'Stay,
traveller, your steps', and &quot;Think you, foolish traveller&quot;. Perhaps it was
common to capture people's attention is such a manner. But I'm not aware of
it. Sure, it proves nothing, but is worth pointing out, I feel.

Wondering if there are any other examples of the time on the theme of &quot;Wait,
traveller/passenger, don't pass by so quickly, or without taking a deeper
look...&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, let's sort that one out straight away. My 'sample'
&gt;&gt;&gt; consisted of just under 57,000 (not 67,000) lines of rhymed
&gt;&gt;&gt; verse dated from the 30 or so years preceding 1616, which
&gt;&gt;&gt; purported to show the original text, and which I was able to
&gt;&gt;&gt; find on the internet at the time I was doing these counts.

&gt;&gt; I got the 67,000 lines from your statement on 11/1/02:
&gt;&gt;&lt;quote&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In a sample of 57 thousand lines of verse from that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; period, now supplemented by the complete First Folio,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (another 10 thousand at least) *not one* of the 826
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; occasions when the words 'sith', 'sithence' or 'since'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are used can be shown to match the way in which the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; word 'sith' (if that is what was intended) is given
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the monument.
&gt;&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;

&gt;&gt; 57,000 + &quot;at least&quot; 10,000 = &quot;at least&quot; 67,000. At least
&gt;&gt; it does as we're taught arithmetic in US grammar schools.

&gt; Ah, I see. That was a typo, of course. The FF is nearer 100
&gt; thousand lines, as any US grammar school student having been
&gt; taught arithmetic would presumably realize.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't believe that Peter properly adjusted his sample to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take into account the known variations in the application of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the capitalization rules of the era, so his statistics are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grossly misleading. In particular, they have grossly misled
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *him*.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Since I didn't 'adjust' it at all, you are right to say that
&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn't adjust it 'properly'. You don't adjust samples, Clark.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You may need to stratify or weight them occasionally, but only
&gt;&gt;&gt; if you know there to be an otherwise unavoidable reason that
&gt;&gt;&gt; your sample will not fairly represent the whole. Since on this
&gt;&gt;&gt; occasion the sample *was* the whole lot available to me, and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; had no reason to suspect that it was unrepresentative, I left
&gt;&gt;&gt; it untampered with in any way.

&gt;&gt; Your sample does not fairly represent the whole, because neither
&gt;&gt;&quot;pedantic capitalization&quot; or &quot;liberal capitalization&quot; would have
&gt;&gt; been thought unusual at the time.

&gt; Who said either of them *would* have been thought unusual?
&gt; That *neither* of them would have been thought so is, of course,
&gt; the whole point, and right at the heart of my argument!

&gt;&gt; Your statistics suggest that &quot;liberal
&gt;&gt; capitalization&quot; would have been thought highly unusual.

&gt; Do they? I wasn't aware of it.

&gt; Look again, for example, at some of the the sample's 'people'
&gt; nouns as listed in my Appendix:

&gt; Man, Paramour, Lover, Sutor, Bridegrome, Infant, Orphane,
&gt; Parent, Father, Syre, Grandsyre, Knight, Squire, Page, Lord,
&gt; Maister, Hero, Traitor, Giant, Dwarf, Victor, Champion,
&gt; Courtier, Patron, Archdeacon, Curate, Novice, Psalmist,
&gt; Chorister, Palmer, Pilgrim, Poet, Author, Painter, Minstrel,
&gt; Architect, Apprentice, Merchant, Souldier, Archer, Clerke,
&gt; Fisher, Shepheard, Porter, Vassall, Begger, Carle, Spectator
&gt; and Looker-on.

&gt; You may indeed like to add on a few not listed there:

&gt; Powers, Iustice, Foxe, Grandams, Enchanter, Ladies, Altars,
&gt; Queene, Firmament, Briton, Northside, Pine, Rose, Cedar,
&gt; Elme, Poplar, Oake, Aspine, Cypresse, Laurell, Firre, Willow,
&gt; Nimph, Ape, Thunders, Cittie, Beasts, Fast, Fortune, Sun.
&gt; Beautie, Giantess, West, Castell, Monster, Lions, and Dame.

&gt; Would you describe them as being more 'pedantic' or more
&gt; 'liberal' in their capitalization?

&gt;&gt; But there's no evidence that people made fun of Heywood
&gt;&gt; because of his liberal capitalization in his elegy.

&gt; What has that got to do with anything? I have never for
&gt; a moment suggested that liberal capitalization was either
&gt; unusual or humorous.

&gt;&gt; Nor did anyone remark on the &quot;unusual&quot; capitalization
&gt;&gt; in F1, which is midway between the extremes.

&gt; Tell Bob Grumman that will you? He seems to think that there
&gt; is no such position. In his world people are either 5ft or 6ft
&gt; tall, and I don't exist.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It was therefore as near as I could get to a completely random
&gt;&gt;&gt; sample of the way rhymed verse was actually being printed at
&gt;&gt;&gt; that time, and with which one might reasonably expect an
&gt;&gt;&gt; educated reader to have been familiar.

&gt;&gt; No, a reasonably educated reader could be expected to be
&gt;&gt; familiar with both styles of punctuation [capitalization?].
&gt;&gt; Your statistics do not show that to be true, therefore your
&gt;&gt; statistics are flawed.

&gt; See those two lists I gave, above, and perhaps try a slightly
&gt; less biased comment?

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pretty straight forward. Letters at the beginning of sentences,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beginning proper nouns,

&gt;&gt;&gt; He said &quot;proper names&quot;, which may or may not be significant.

&gt;&gt; Perhaps. Except that &quot;proper names&quot; and &quot;proper nouns&quot; are used
&gt;&gt; synonymusly in the OED, and were apparently used interchangeably in
&gt;&gt; the examples given by the OED:

&gt;&gt; c1290 S. Eng. Leg. I. 462/18 Heo was icleoped in *propre name* 'þe
&gt;&gt; Maudeleyne'.
&gt;&gt; c1440 Promp. Parv. 70/1 Charlys, *propyr name*, Carolus.
&gt;&gt; 1551 T. Wilson Logike (1580) 4 b, In this Proposition Cato is the
&gt;&gt; *Nowne proper*, whiche belongeth to one manne onely.

&gt; Fair enough. I wasn't arguing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and expressing numbers (presumably
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Roman numerals) are all capitalized (i.e., are &quot;great&quot;).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The rest are all lower case (i.e. &quot;less&quot;).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So where does the room for variation come in?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Was there any earlier attempt to present such rules? You think
&gt;&gt;&gt; not, in which case the variation was the current state that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson was trying to improve.

&gt;&gt; Apparently it was the first attempt at a published grammar, but no, it
&gt;&gt; wasn't that Jonson was trying to improve the current usage. It looks
&gt;&gt; like you may have been misled here by the quote that I gave from
&gt;&gt; Jonson's &quot;Execration.&quot; On the title page to &quot;The English Grammar&quot;, as
&gt;&gt; published, Jonson wrote: &quot;Made by Ben Jonson for the benefit of all
&gt;&gt; Strangers, out of his observation of the English Language now spoken,
&gt;&gt; and in use.&quot; In fact, there is a Latin parallel text for the first
&gt;&gt; few chapters of the &quot;Grammar&quot; because he had intended it to be used by
&gt;&gt; educated foreigners who wanted to learn English.

&gt;&gt; Also, note that on the bit about the use of letters he wrote &quot;The
&gt;&gt; great letters serve to begin sentences, *with us*...&quot; He was telling
&gt;&gt; the &quot;strangers&quot; what the current usage was, not what he wished it to
&gt;&gt; be.

&gt; That's interesting - thanks. Also interesting, therefore, is
&gt; that *his* view of what the current usage 'with us' was, erred
&gt; markedly (according to you) on the 'pedantic' side. Clearly not
&gt; as in touch with what was really going on then as you are!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not much of a grammarian, so I'd appreciate it if anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wishes to step in here and give me some help, but from what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've seen there seems to be two possibilities:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) There was a variation in understanding as to what kinds
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of nouns constituted &quot;proper nouns&quot;; or

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Some people just capitalized all nouns, despite what old
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ben thought about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, in 1616 it seems unlikely that anyone except Jonson
&gt;&gt;&gt; would have known what he thought about it. (Which raises an
&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting thought that I'll come back to later).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally, I suspect that #1 is the most likely.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That rather depends upon whether there was any concept of
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'proper names' before this work of Jonson's came out. If you
&gt;&gt;&gt; mean that there was no generally accepted rule as to which
&gt;&gt;&gt; nouns should be capitalized, however, I would agree. It's
&gt;&gt;&gt; tautological.

&gt;&gt; As demonstrated by the OED, there was a concept of &quot;proper names&quot;
&gt;&gt; prior to Jonson. I'm just not sure that everybody defined it the same
&gt;&gt; way (and Jonson didn't bother to give a definition in his Grammar).
