One more thing.  Since we know that Robert Peck (later) of Beccles was an adult by 1537, his purported father Henry *could not be* the son of Richard Peck, Esq of Wakefield by his wife Alice Middleton.

The reason now is chronological.  Henry would have to be older than Richard's heir John Peck who inherited Wakefield and married Joan Anne.

So now, if we seek to maintain the connection at all, we need to put Henry back another generation, that is as a younger son of Richard Peck of Wakefield, by his wife Joan Harrington.

Bill you still have it in your head that Visitations are &quot;factual&quot;.  They are not.  They are evidence just like anything else.  They have no higher value, than any other evidence.  In fact, on generations several times removed *from the contributor* they have much *less* value than other evidence.  How many people can accurately remember the names of all their great-grand-aunts ?  Not many.

You need to understand that many times, visitations are merely writen down from what one person tells another, *not* from searches in documents, or verification of the points.

Sometimes other evidence, upholds the visitation pedigree, sometimes it does not.

By the way, the fact that he is making a deposition in 1537 tells us that he was an adult by that time.

If his purported father Henry  died *in* 1525, that could neatly explain why Robert moved to Beccles.  I.E. that he was now either poorer, or richer, after his father's death, so he was either driven out, or bought himself a nicer place.

Which again goes back to my point that you need to follow what properties were owned by Henry his purported father, and how they were disposed.

Indeed.

I will raise the ante.  Assuming (a big assumption) that these two or three generations in the
16th century TOLD THE TRUTH and dealt with English customs (or laws: I will let you, and
gen-medieval experts rule!) correctly, then that would be the case.  But what if: Robert Peck
of Beccles were the illegitimate or legitimate son of John Peck of Wakefield by an earlier wife
and confirms the British Museum pedigree of Pecks?

Custom would dictate that the *Visitations* were part true and part lie.  But, then is the
British Museum pedigree of Peck really a forgery, or maybe does it speak more to the truth?
After all, it comes from the College of Heralds, was signed, dated, etc.?

I agree with your reasoning but I am unsure that the Visitations, both of them cited by the
authors of the 1930s NEHGSR articles, or the British Museum pedigree of Peck should be
dismissed or accepted, one, two or three?  The motive to lie in the former was as applicable
as the motive to lie in the latter, or the final pedigree much maligned.

It makes more sense to me to investigate anew from 2007 on such an able forum as this
the totality of the question:

Who were the ancestors of Robert Peck of Beccles, who it now appears was NOT born in
Beccles as we have been led to believe by all previous pronouncements.

The pedigree printed by S. Allyn Peck should be assumed to be a complete
fabrication by a known nineteenth-century forger, made to impress a
naive American client, until proved otherwise.  This is a known MO.  The
attestation and signature of the herald are most likely forged.

The Visitation pedigrees are much more modest in their claims.  The one
which makes more extravagant claims, and which only surfaced at the
hands of a known forger, for a naive American client, is the one much
more seriously in doubt.  That is not to say Visitation pedigrees are
entirely accurate.  But for the most part, Visitation pedigrees are
authentic manuscripts of the period they purport to date from, and (for
the most part) they represent good faith efforts by specific informants
to recount their ancestries to some reasonably scrupulous scribe.

If you are serious, pay someone good (I recommend Chris Phillips) to
examine the physical context and provenance of the pedigree now in the
British Library, pay for good photographic copies, and attempt to make a
case based on external and internal evidence both that the pedigree
really is a genuine seventeenth-century manuscript (which I doubt), and
that the information it contains is true (though we already know it to
be false with regard to the pedigree's account of the children of John,
son of Richard Peck of Wakefield, Yorks.).  Given the obvious strikes
against it, the burden of proof rests very clearly on anyone attempting
to claim either hypothesis.

Thanks much, Will.  Believe it or not: we are in TOTAL agreement on your paragraph below.
My knowledge of language has me saying once again: communications, spoken and written,
of as misunderstood as understood.  I have sent a few citations of my background: I hope
it shows you I do not say the following in a light tone: WE ARE IN TOTAL AGREEMENT.

In other words: dealing just with the *Visitations* as such.  I KNOW that.  Let me give you
a case in point: in American and Canadian record keeping, I found a death record of my
great-grandmother and the informant was her descendant and my great-grandmother's
maternal line had been erased, and only a LAST or surname entered.  For four decades I
accepted that maternal line.  So, you can imagine my chagrin when this year upon looking
at Canadian census records of the 1800s I found two back-to-back census records with
a DIFFERENT LAST or surname entered.  What had transpired was that the MOTHER of my
great-grandmother had become widowed in her later age, and REMARRIED and ASSUMED
the LAST or surname of the STEP-father of her children.  My great-grandmother and/or
her informant gave the STEP-father's LAST or surname as the name of the FATHER.  It
turns out that the real FATHER was the LAST or surname BEFORE she became widowed.
TWO CENSUS RECORDS proved the error and OTHER records comfirmed this NEW knowledge
of the maternal line.

Now: back to *Visitations* as such.  They are, to me, no different than census records:
as good and as true and certain as the STATEMENTS of the INFORMANTS to the Visitation
recorder.  So: I am ABSOLUTELY in agreement with your thoughts, except that you must
now accept that we ARE ON THE SAME PAGE as to *Visitations.*  As to how I wish to relate
all this to the crux of the matter of WHO were the ancestors of Rboert Peck of Beccles is
forthcoming.  In other words: we must look at all the evidence, as you say, and I accept
that two different *Visitations* and a Peck pedigree in the British Museum library and
all other evidence must be brought to the fore, including wills, Chancery and Church
records, and anything else that might have a decisive impact on conculsions.  It is my
opinion that the authors of the 1930s serialized articles in NEHGSR were biased, did not
draw always correct opinions, that there is probably additional information now available
which they did not have access to.  In the final analysis: indeed, we may NOT be able
to be more conclusive than we are now.  But now, according to Uah, according to rootsweb
ancestral files, and familiy trees all over the net and in books, there are ALLEGATIONS
many but few have evidence to support them.

I will march forward, as best I can, and really do appreciate your help.

Bill

Indeed.

Or: try this scenario: if his purported father John...!  I am, truthfully, investigating ALL
avenues
at this point, and no longer accept what the authors of the infamous 1930s NEHGSR wrote
as *WRIT* but will investigate further.  I no longer blindly accept that John Leeke was his
grandfather: he may have been his uncle!  For instance, records indicate that two daughters
of John Leek married two uncles of Robert Peck of Beccles.  So: I must be open to all new
disclosures of facts in the pedigree, and normal behaviour of the times in terms of law,
church, property, marriages, divorce, whatever.

So: I assume you believe that the fact he made a deposition, under English law of the times,
means he was of the age of majority?  And that would be, what?  21?

The authors concluded along similar line, that because John Leeke named him an executor
of his estate in a will drawn in 1529 that he was of the age of majority in 1529?  Do you
agree with their conclusion?

As a case in point: I have read in the records that marriages were arranged with children
of two different families while the children, a boy and a girl, were 7 years of age.  If age
did not matter in the case of marriage, why should it have mattered in all other cases:
depositions, wills, church, et al.?  It hardly seems a fair conclusion that such a marriage
between 7 year olds could be consummated?  Thus, participants before the law were
making documents based on future time, agreed?

Care to address this medieval-law question?

---------------------------------
Which is why, I believe a more accurate approach is: first quote EXACTLY what the primary document states, no additions, no brackets.

Then translate it.
Then add comments.

That way we can all see exactly what is said, and what isn't.  So if the will of John Leeke only mentions that Robert Peck is his heir with no explanation of WHY then that should be made apparent.

If he made a deposition, then yes he was in his majority.
If he was left as an executor, then maybe yes maybe no.  We've had cases mentioned here where it can be shown that an executor was not in their majority when so-named.

The question, in my mind is, were they allowed to *actually* execute while a minor (under the law) ?  Or was this method, basically a way of *delaying* execution *until* a person gained their majority ?

I'm not sure.  It does sound however a bit suspicious, like the testator were trying to do something a tad squirrelly.

Marriage was governed by canon law at this time, distinct from
common-law customs of minimum age for court appearances (which may have
been equivalent in ecclesiastical and civil courts in England).  And age
did matter with marriage: seven years was the minimum for solemnizing a
marriage, though such marriages would not be consummated until puberty.

Indeed.  I think you might be right  on all accounts.  It is curious that the brother and son of
that
brother of Alice Middleton, and William Thwaites, of the related families, was the ONE who did in
fact
make marriage arrangements for Pecks after the death of Alice's husband Richard.  Remember that
Alice apparently died soon after 1491 and clearly before Richard her widow died in 1516 he had
remarried the sister of his son's wife (I am NOT making this up!).  It is hard keeping those
Anne's
sister straight :)

Certainly, we are not done yet on discoveries in that area of the inheritance of the Middletons
into the
Peck line, nor the Annes, as it appears the Pecks at that time and place, even in Wakefield, were
not as
flush in the  pocket as the Middletons who clearly had a few Sirs and Ladies in their ranks over
several
generations.  I do not know that much about the Anne families, as of yet.

As to the properties to analyze: I am in a wait-and-see mode.  Bear with me, Will.  I think it is
premature
at this point inasmuch as there is much fodder yet in the authors transcripts, et al., in the
serialization
articles in the 1930s in the NEHGSR.  Also: it may turn out that John is the father of Robert Peck
of Beccles,
and the British Museum pedigree of Pecks might NOT ALL be suspect.  After all, it clearly predates
the 1930s
folderol, accomplished by none other than the same gents responsible for the Visitations.  No
doubt the
Visitations are subject to scrutiny, and I now assert, so does the pedigree of Pecks deserve more
scrutiny,
at least as to how it &quot;confounds or clarifies&quot;(to quote yourself!) the pedigree segment under
scrutiny.  Keep
in mind that the British Museum pedigree rest on the Tonge's Visitation of 1530 and the 1563-64,
encompassing this vital segment of the Peck pedigree.  Also, note that Bill Arnold did not propose
this
Peck pedigree, but it was SANCTIONED by the College of Heralds in 1620!

I am more and more inclined to wonder deeply about &quot;neve&quot; as it was used by John Leeke in his
will?
I am surprised no Latin scholar has chimed in?  Where are they?  If we accept the original
interpretation
of the authors of the Latin &quot;neve&quot; of John Leeke's in his will, then it would mean that Robert
Peck of
Beccles was his nephew, and that is HUGE inasmuch as it clarifies the British Museum pedigree,
because
he would then be a son of John Peck and his two of his sibling brothers accordingly had married
daughters
of Leeke/Leake/Leyke/L(no e)ake.

Will, remember: we are on the same page.  Words have a tendency not to say what we think
they say.

What I mean is precisely what the words say: accordingly to British Lore, there are these
documents called Visitations and Pedigrees, in various archives, Museums, and published
in various books, and they were sanctioned by College of Heralds, and other officialdom.
In some cases they are proven to be right, when compared with other evidence.  In other
cases they are proven to be wrong, when compared with other evidence.

In the case of the Pedigree of Peck, published as a foldout sheet in the back of Ira. B. Peck's
1868 book *Genealogical History of the Descendants of Jospeh Peck* and also before that
published by the College of Heralds and in the British Museum, with the same vital information
about the Peck segment under discussion here and now, although some additional two
generations were added for the Ira Peck book, subsequent to Robert Peck of Beccles.

Therefore, because this Peck segment predates the work of the authors of the 1930s
serialization articles in NEHGSR and is evidence, to be tested, just as Tonge's 1530 Visitation
and Flower's 1563-64 Visitation, it is my considered opinion it, too, needs to be revisited.
After all, IT is where all this folderol began.  I am guessing that some members of gen-medieval
believe Bill Arnold invented this proposed Peck segment: when in fact it is at LDS in Utah,
also on the net at World Connect at rootsweb and only zillions of family trees all over the
web.  It is high time it is put to the post-1930s and INTERNET TEST of the same standards
of gen-medieval toughness.

&gt;  I no longer blindly accept that John Leeke was his

&gt; disclosures of facts in the pedigree, and normal behaviour of the times in terms of law,
&gt; church, property, marriages, divorce, whatever.

&gt; So: I assume you believe that the fact he made a deposition, under English law of the times,
&gt; means he was of the age of majority?  And that would be, what?  21?

&gt; The authors concluded along similar line, that because John Leeke named him an executor
&gt; of his estate in a will drawn in 1529 that he was of the age of majority in 1529?  Do you
&gt; agree with their conclusion? &gt;&gt;

&gt; ---------------------------------
&gt; Which is why, I believe a more accurate approach is: first quote EXACTLY what the primary
&gt; document states, no additions, no brackets.

&gt; Then translate it.
&gt; Then add comments.

&gt; That way we can all see exactly what is said, and what isn't.  So if the will of John Leeke only
&gt; mentions that Robert Peck is his heir with no explanation of WHY then that should be made
&gt; apparent.

&gt; If he made a deposition, then yes he was in his majority.
&gt; If he was left as an executor, then maybe yes maybe no.  We've had cases mentioned here where it
&gt; can be shown that an executor was not in their majority when so-named.

&gt; The question, in my mind is, were they allowed to *actually* execute while a minor (under the
&gt; law) ?  Or was this method, basically a way of *delaying* execution *until* a person gained
&gt; their majority ?

&gt; I'm not sure.  It does sound however a bit suspicious, like the testator were trying to do
&gt; something a tad squirrelly.

When one says 'forged pedigree' there are two possible meanings.  The
first is that the pedigree contains made-up information, presenting a
genealogy that the author knows to be false or that the author knows is
without evidentiary basis.  The second meaning is the one more commonly
said of other types of document: that the physical document was written
by someone other than its purported writer, usually at a time later than
it purports to have been made.  In the case of the document printed in
facsimile by S. Allyn Peck in five plates opposite NEHGR (1936):371, the
first meaning is certainly true.  The second meaning is quite likely
also true.  The alternative is that is an authentic 17th-century forged
pedigree, at some point inspected and signed by a herald.  I rather
suspect it is a much later document, by Somerby himself, for specific
reasons:

1. Horatio Gates Somerby, who sent a description and the information
from this pedigree to Ira Peck in the 1850s, is known to have concocted
genealogical information for American clients.  Check the archives of
this group for discussions and citations of his works.  He was not
unique in doing this.  There is a good study of another such
genealogical forger of the following generation: Robert C. Anderson, &quot;We
Wuz Robbed: The modus operandi of Gustave Anjou,&quot; and Gordon L.
Remington, &quot;Gustave, We Hardly Knew Ye: A Portrait of Herr Anjou as a
Jungberg,&quot; published together in _Genealogical Journal 19.1-2 (1991),
47-58, and 59-70.

2. The pedigree itself contains a string, typical of eighteenth-and
nineteenth-century invented genealogies, of many generations of
armigerous Pecks, purporting to date from the twelfth to fourteenth
centuries, who probably did not exist.  This is more typical of later
concoctions than of early 17th-century ones, I believe, since it seeks
to create a pedigree similar in look and feel to those published in
antiquarian works of the late 17th and 18th centuries.

3. The pedigree purports to demonstrate the armigerous ancestry of the
Pecks of Suffolk of the early 17th century, and purports to bear a
herald's sanction, similar to the style of attestation found on some
visitation pedigree manuscripts.  However, compiled indexes of authentic
visitation materials, such as that developed by Cecil Humphery-Smith and
available online at www.achievements.co.uk , lists no visitation material
for any Suffolk Pecks.  If such a pedigree was actually inspected and
signed by a herald, why is there no corresponding pedigree in any
17th-century Suffolk visitation MSS?

To test these allegations it is vital to inspect the rest of the MS and
see the physical context of this pedigree.

It is not unexpected that someone's response, after having a cherished
line shown to be invalid, would be to belligerently but unsystematically
impugn everything in sight.  It is more worthwhile to use the episode to
develop criticial skills.  In this case, I have done nothing but make an
allegation and suggest how it might be investigated.  I have stated my
suspicions and supported them.  Somerby's Peck pedigree, that's OK.  I
am writing for others, and for myself, because I think it is an
interesting case.

Hi Bill and others.

I am a Peck descendant and the descent, if proven, would be
interesting, however:

1.  If the pedigree is authentic it is not &quot;proof&quot; but merely one
piece of evidence which could be analyzed with other  evidence.
2.  It would need to be examined by an expert like Chris Phillips to
be authenticated.
3.  Nat is correct that many of the pedigrees that Horatio Gates
Somerby provided clients have later been proven to be false using
wills, deeds and other written evidences.  This is well documented in
the genealogical literature.  Some easily accessible commentary can be
seen on the internet at: http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~wdwrth/Billings/Issues.html ,
http://caldwellgenealogy.com/anjou.html , and http://www.progenealogists.com/preed.htm .

Re: remarks of Doug Smith, below:

Much thanks, Doug.  And very glad to have a Peck aboard,
as, yes, if this little *hitch* in the proposed pedigree is validated,
it will, indeed, be interesante!  Even Douglas Richardson will take
note!  One leading genealogist told me that if Mr. S. Allyn Peck who
compiled the articles in NEHGSR in the 1930s knew what we know
now, he would have dug deeper and if he had validated it, he would
have published it rather than be praised for trashing it.  Someone
said his series of articles was &quot;dull and boring&quot; with which I totally
disagree.  This is genealogy.  I admit that Mr. S. Allyn Peck was,
as one scholar termed him, &quot;circumlocutory&quot; in thought and expression.
And his vetting board and he seemed to have wanted to trash the
pedigree rather than resolve the question of WHO were the ancestors
of Robert Peck of Beccles.

Now: here is some more *cache* to this story.  We MUST ignore
the naysayers.  There are enough of them to go around.  At least we
must challenge their ad hominem attacks upon us Pecks, and require
them to offer PROOF of their allegations.  GEN-MEDIEVAL is a newsgroup
list of scholarship of messages, not a forum of attackers of the messengers!
They should be held to the same high standard of PROOF they demand
of others.

With all due respect to Nat Turner, as, indeed, I DO know WHO he is:
and perhaps, with a little googling, he will KNOW who I am: humble
Peck descendant, but not a *yeoman* as some have classified our
ancestors.  So: Nat Turner owes us some *homework* if he wishes
to opine :)  Remember he said he had not followed our THREAD but joined
after another alleged Peck descendant violated a private email, and
he, Nat, posted it against ethical standards of privacy.  I believe Nat
Turner owes me an apology.

I KNOW he is a busy man, as so is Douglas Richardson, but then
so is Gary Boyd Roberts, and as I wrote, and will repeat in case you
missed it in the archives: at least Gary Boyd Roberts was enough of
a gentleman to give me the time of the day, a full hour and a half
and assisted this gen-medieval naif.  Now: I am NOT a genealogy
naif, not by any stretch of imagination, but a former journalist,
college professor of English, scholar, author, et al.  And Doug:
this story is NOT done yet.  There are, as Will Jhonson and John
Higgins have alluded to: avenues of proof to validate the proposed
pedigree or invalidate it.  Perhaps, you, Doug, have access and
understand the English system better than I.  Join in, as you wish.

According to *my sources* the Pedigree of Peck PREDATES the
alleged perpetrator of an alleged fraudulent pedigree in the
British Museum allegedly created by the College of Heralds in
1620.  Mr. Somerby (1805-1872) could NOT possibly be held
responsible for something created almost two centuries before
his birth, now could he?  So: I do believe those who are dragging
the GOOD name of Mr. Somerby into this as the perpetrator of
a fraud owe us a DETAILED explanation of his crime.  I am not
aware of it.  I do not know how he could have from the 19th
century created a document which resides in the British Museum
Library and supposedly was created in 1620 by the College of
Heralds.  Someone has to explain this one to me, and in the
meantime, take note of our famous genealogist:

Horatio Gates Somerby

http://famousamericans.net/horatiogatessomerby/

SOMERBY, Horatio Gates, genealogist, born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, 24 December, 1805; died
in London, England, 14 November, 1872. His ancestor, Anthony, came from England to Newbury,
Massachusetts, in 1639. He received a public-school education in his native town, studied art in
Boston, and had a studio in Troy, New York, for several years, but in 1832 returned to Boston,
where he was a fancy painter and japanner. After 1845 he resided chiefly in London as a
professional genealogist, and was the first American to devote himself exclusively to such work.
He became very skilful, and many families in this country availed themselves of his services in
tracing their English ancestry. Mr. Somerby was on confidential terms with George Peabody, and
became secretary to the board of trustees of the Peabody fund. He was a member of the New England
historic-genealogical society, to whose publications he contributed valuable papers, and a large
quantity of his unpublished material is in possession of the Massachusetts historical society,
with which he had been connected since 1859. He was the originator of systematic research for the
purpose of connecting New England families with their ancestors in Great Britain.--His brother,
Frederic Thomas, author, born in Newburyport, 4 January, 1814; died in Worcester, Massachusetts,
18 January, 1871, was educated in his native place, and became an ornamental painter. He was for
many years a correspondent of the Boston &quot; Post&quot; and the &quot;Spirit of the Times,&quot; and published,
under the name of &quot;Cymon,&quot; &quot;Hits and Dashes, or a Medley of Sketches and Scraps touching People
and Things&quot; (Boston, 1852). [Edited Appletons Encyclopedia, Copyright © 2001 VirtualologyTM]

Now: the PLATES of the British Museum Pedigree of Peck are in the 1936 NEHGSR, *tipped in* to be
exact, and they are,
unfortunately NOT online at the website, but ARE in the CDROM of the Register and they are in the
hardbound version:
of which I have a copy.  I have DONE MY HOMEWORK, and been in communication with THE BRITISH
LIBRARY: and the
Pedigree of Peck is listed under: Shelfmark: *Additional Manuscripts, 5524, folios 158 to 160.*
Mr. Ira B. Peck, who
authored the MASTERPIECE of Pecks in 1868 referred to it as folio 152.  In any event: the
CORRECTION is noted.

To be CLEAR: I DO NOT KNOW if the original manuscript in the British Museum has a KNOWN
*Provenance* but that
most assuredly will solve the problem of WHEN if not WHO delivered IT to the archives, where it
now resides.  Mr. Ira B.
Peck offered his explanation which I am willing to share with you all.  But I do NOT believe any
commentators, so far,
have a clue of its *PROVENANCE* and until they address that question, it is best NOT to malign
anyone, certainly NOT
Mr. Somerby.  I believe SOME are going to be surprised when the TRUTH comes out.  I too am looking
for truth and
certainty here, irrespective of naysayers.

More anon.

&gt; Hi Bill and others.

&gt; I am a Peck descendant and the descent, if proven, would be
&gt; interesting, however:

&gt; 1.  If the pedigree is authentic it is not &quot;proof&quot; but merely one
&gt; piece of evidence which could be analyzed with other  evidence.
&gt; 2.  It would need to be examined by an expert like Chris Phillips to
&gt; be authenticated.
&gt; 3.  Nat is correct that many of the pedigrees that Horatio Gates
&gt; Somerby provided clients have later been proven to be false using
&gt; wills, deeds and other written evidences.  This is well documented in
&gt; the genealogical literature.  Some easily accessible commentary can be

Excuse me, gen-medieval members:

But can someone explain what is going on here, with SOMEONE
using the handle &quot;D. Spencer Hines&quot; is CHANNELING emails to us
from SOMEONE using the handle &quot;Nathaniel Taylor&quot; at another
list?  Am I mistaken, or is it the SAME person?

Oh, I get it: you're spoofing us, aren't you?  The &quot;Nat Turner&quot; touch

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Re: remarks of Doug Smith, below:

&gt; Much thanks, Doug.  And very glad to have a Peck aboard,
&gt; as, yes, if this little *hitch* in the proposed pedigree is validated,
&gt; it will, indeed, be interesante!  Even Douglas Richardson will take
&gt; note!  One leading genealogist told me that if Mr. S. Allyn Peck who
&gt; compiled the articles in NEHGSR in the 1930s knew what we know
&gt; now, he would have dug deeper and if he had validated it, he would
&gt; have published it rather than be praised for trashing it.  Someone
&gt; said his series of articles was &quot;dull and boring&quot; with which I totally
&gt; disagree.  This is genealogy.  I admit that Mr. S. Allyn Peck was,
&gt; as one scholar termed him, &quot;circumlocutory&quot; in thought and expression.
&gt; And his vetting board and he seemed to have wanted to trash the
&gt; pedigree rather than resolve the question of WHO were the ancestors
&gt; of Robert Peck of Beccles.

&gt; Now: here is some more *cache* to this story.  We MUST ignore
&gt; the naysayers.  There are enough of them to go around.  At least we
&gt; must challenge their ad hominem attacks upon us Pecks, and require
&gt; them to offer PROOF of their allegations.  GEN-MEDIEVAL is a newsgroup
&gt; list of scholarship of messages, not a forum of attackers of the messengers!
&gt; They should be held to the same high standard of PROOF they demand
&gt; of others.

&gt; With all due respect to Nat Turner, as, indeed, I DO know WHO he is:
&gt; and perhaps, with a little googling, he will KNOW who I am: humble
&gt; Peck descendant, but not a *yeoman* as some have classified our
&gt; ancestors.  So: Nat Turner owes us some *homework* if he wishes
&gt; to opine :)  Remember he said he had not followed our THREAD but joined
&gt; after another alleged Peck descendant violated a private email, and
&gt; he, Nat, posted it against ethical standards of privacy.  I believe Nat
&gt; Turner owes me an apology.

&gt; I KNOW he is a busy man, as so is Douglas Richardson, but then
&gt; so is Gary Boyd Roberts, and as I wrote, and will repeat in case you
&gt; missed it in the archives: at least Gary Boyd Roberts was enough of
&gt; a gentleman to give me the time of the day, a full hour and a half
&gt; and assisted this gen-medieval naif.  Now: I am NOT a genealogy
&gt; naif, not by any stretch of imagination, but a former journalist,
&gt; college professor of English, scholar, author, et al.  And Doug:
&gt; this story is NOT done yet.  There are, as Will Jhonson and John
&gt; Higgins have alluded to: avenues of proof to validate the proposed
&gt; pedigree or invalidate it.  Perhaps, you, Doug, have access and
&gt; understand the English system better than I.  Join in, as you wish.

&gt; According to *my sources* the Pedigree of Peck PREDATES the
&gt; alleged perpetrator of an alleged fraudulent pedigree in the
&gt; British Museum allegedly created by the College of Heralds in
&gt; 1620.  Mr. Somerby (1805-1872) could NOT possibly be held
&gt; responsible for something created almost two centuries before
&gt; his birth, now could he?  So: I do believe those who are dragging
&gt; the GOOD name of Mr. Somerby into this as the perpetrator of
&gt; a fraud owe us a DETAILED explanation of his crime.  I am not
&gt; aware of it.  I do not know how he could have from the 19th
&gt; century created a document which resides in the British Museum
&gt; Library and supposedly was created in 1620 by the College of
&gt; Heralds.  Someone has to explain this one to me, and in the
&gt; meantime, take note of our famous genealogist:

&gt; Horatio Gates Somerby

&gt; http://famousamericans.net/horatiogatessomerby/

&gt; SOMERBY, Horatio Gates, genealogist, born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, 24 December, 1805; died
&gt; in London, England, 14 November, 1872. His ancestor, Anthony, came from England to Newbury,
&gt; Massachusetts, in 1639. He received a public-school education in his native town, studied art in
&gt; Boston, and had a studio in Troy, New York, for several years, but in 1832 returned to Boston,
&gt; where he was a fancy painter and japanner. After 1845 he resided chiefly in London as a
&gt; professional genealogist, and was the first American to devote himself exclusively to such work.
&gt; He became very skilful, and many families in this country availed themselves of his services in
&gt; tracing their English ancestry. Mr. Somerby was on confidential terms with George Peabody, and
&gt; became secretary to the board of trustees of the Peabody fund. He was a member of the New England
&gt; historic-genealogical society, to whose publications he contributed valuable papers, and a large
&gt; quantity of his unpublished material is in possession of the Massachusetts historical society,
&gt; with which he had been connected since 1859. He was the originator of systematic research for the
&gt; purpose of connecting New England families with their ancestors in Great Britain.--His brother,
&gt; Frederic Thomas, author, born in Newburyport, 4 January, 1814; died in Worcester, Massachusetts,
&gt; 18 January, 1871, was educated in his native place, and became an ornamental painter. He was for
&gt; many years a correspondent of the Boston &quot; Post&quot; and the &quot;Spirit of the Times,&quot; and published,
&gt; under the name of &quot;Cymon,&quot; &quot;Hits and Dashes, or a Medley of Sketches and Scraps touching People
&gt; and Things&quot; (Boston, 1852). [Edited Appletons Encyclopedia, Copyright © 2001 VirtualologyTM]

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;quite possibly made the document&quot; and &quot;up from scratch&quot; are hardly
&gt;&gt; &gt; worthy of a response, but this is THE PECK THREAD and it MUST BE
&gt;&gt; &gt; CHALLENGED as MADE UP FROM SCRATCH as a response.

&gt;&gt; Hi Bill and others.

&gt;&gt; I am a Peck descendant and the descent, if proven, would be
&gt;&gt; interesting, however:

&gt;&gt; 1.  If the pedigree is authentic it is not &quot;proof&quot; but merely one
&gt;&gt; piece of evidence which could be analyzed with other  evidence.
&gt;&gt; 2.  It would need to be examined by an expert like Chris Phillips to
&gt;&gt; be authenticated.
&gt;&gt; 3.  Nat is correct that many of the pedigrees that Horatio Gates
&gt;&gt; Somerby provided clients have later been proven to be false using
&gt;&gt; wills, deeds and other written evidences.  This is well documented in
&gt;&gt; the genealogical literature.  Some easily accessible commentary can be
&gt;&gt; seen on the internet at:
&gt;&gt; http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~wdwrth/Billings/Issues.html ,

I think what is happening is that someone is reading messages on (and
posting messages to) the soc.genealogy.medieval newsgroup, which is not
a mailing list but which is gated with the GEN-MEDIEVAL mailing list.

Nat TAYLOR simply responded to material that had appeared in the

This 'group' exists in several different internet media.  There is a
mailing list called GEN-MEDIEVAL and a newsgroup called
soc.genealogy.medieval.  The mailing list is operated by a server at
RootsWeb.com that, in addition to sending out the mailings also
functions as a gateway between the two, passing all messages from GEN-
MED to soc.gen.med, and vice versa. Further, the privately run Google
Groups server harvests posts off of soc.gen.med and puts them on a web
page, to which people can contribute directly (with the posts passed
back to soc.gen.med) or through a mailing list gated to the web page.
Because of the nature of the propagation of the various media and
gateways, you can sometimes receive a response before you see the post
to which it is responding, and sometimes (fortunately less so than in
the past), some posts never make it all the way.  All of the posts are
submitted to the same collective 'group', whether they appear to come
from Google Groups, soc.gen.med or GEN-MED.

Oh, and Nat Taylor and D. Spencer Hines are presumed not to be the
same person, although I am unaware if this presumption has ever been
confirmed by the witnessing of the two of them together.

Monsieur Hines,

yawn.

As to your challenge, this is NOT medieval England, and you are not riding
a horse and you do not carry a lance at the ready.  Bill Arnold accepts no
burder of proof because Bill Arnold is NOT on trial and there is NO King
to order me around, least of all by a nonce like you.  Look it up!  As in

Do not try to figure out why!

Ira B. Peck published his *A Genealogical History of the Descendants
of Joseph Peck* in Boston in 1868.  In Jan 1870 W.H.W. offered a
mini-critique in *Book-Notices* of NEHGSR, page 96: See full citation at:

http: www.newenglandancestors.org/nehgsr/disk2/1870/870A096.gif

Ira. B. Peck responded in April 1870, pages 187-88, and said, in part,
among other things:

&quot;In relation to the pedigree, I stated that it could be found in the British
Museum...[dated] 20th Nov. 1620.&quot;  The three gentlemen named are
other than Mr. Somerby.  Then Mr. Ira Peck, writes, in part: &quot;It is in the
library of the British Museum...and was evidently prepared at much
expense for Nicholas Peck, the elder brother of Robert and Joseph,
who possessed, after his mother's decease, the most of his father's and
uncle's estates.&quot;

Nicholas Peck was the grandson of Robert Peck of Beccles, the Elder.
Nicholas Peck was b.15 Feb 1576, and his brother Robert was Rector
at Hingam (1580-1658) and his brother Joseph, b. 30 Apr 1587 was
gateway ancestor to America.  The Reverend Robert went back to his
church in England and died there, as did Nicholas, b.1576, who never
left England.

Thus: the PLOT thickens!  If Ira. B. Peck TOLD THE WORLD in 1870 that
his distant relative Nicholas,b.1576, had commissioned the Peck Pedigree
in the British Museum Library, then IF THAT IS TRUE AND CERTAIN then
the British Museum Library scholars ought to know the true provenance
of the plates (there are four).  No one can make CALCULATED STATEMENTS
ABOUT THE PECK PEDIGREE and its TRUTH and CERTAINTY until the
PROVENANCE issue is decided.  I can speculate, but as a descendant

Bill I think you can see that that is a bit of silly argument.

Ira Peck in the 19th century could have no idea of the truth of when the
older pedigree was prepared.  So what he said on that topic isn't  germane.

Unless, now, we are maligning Ira Peck, as well?

Understand, according to his commentary, he wrote to thousands of
recipients all over the world: he was a Peck: if there was a family tradition,
or something for him to hang his hat on to make that *outrageous statement*
then I can take it with a grain of salt: it still must be dealt with in terms of
PROVENANCE.  I have dealt with primary documents in research for decades,

The burden of proof works unequally.  In modern genealogy, it is the
duty of the proponent of any genealogy to prove it.  If legitimate
doubts are aired, the proponent of a genealogy needs to address those
doubts.  Critics of a genealogy do not need to prove a different
genealogy, or to prove the genealogy impossible.  In logical terms, the
converse of proof is doubt, not disproof.

That being said, I am interested in pursuing the question I raised,
about whether the pedigree printed in facsimile by S. Allyn Peck is
actually a (physical) forgery by Somerby.  I do not presume to know for

been downsampled for the on-line version (e.g., the heraldic line
drawings for the Roll of Arms).  I would appreciate it if someone who
has the CD-ROM version could make these five plates available in pdf

website.  For convenience's sake, I here repost a link to the plates

in order to allow these email-preferring genealogists to still

Mr. Peck was not in a position to judge the authenticity of the Peck
pedigree communicated to him by Somerby.  Ira Peck is only 'maligned' to
the point that (as Will notes above) he cannot vouch to us for the
pedigree.  He may have been duped.  He took Somerby at his word--and
needed to defend it because even to contemporaries in 1870 (especially
someone as sound as William H. Whitmore [WHW], who wrote the notice in
NEHGR) it looked a tad suspicious.

The irony is that, suspicious as Whitmore was, he declared he would be
satisfied if Somerby vouched for it--and of course Somerby had!

I made a pdf of the 1870 exchange between Whitmore and Peck, available
at:

http://www.nltaylor.net/temp/Peck_NEHGR_1870.pdf

For what it's worth, Ira Peck's _Peck Genealogy_ is available at

&gt; Please note that this sketch was written for _Appleton's Cyclopedia of
&gt; American Biography_, published from 1887 to 1889--rather before Mr.
&gt; Somerby's genealogical career was significantly reassessed in the light
&gt; of modern scholarship in the field.
">

For a modern assessment, see Paul C. Reed, &quot;Two Somerby Frauds, or
'Placing the Flesh on the Wrong Bones',&quot; TAG 74 (1999), 15-30.

Paul concludes (p. 30):

&quot;Henry Swan Dana's account of the Billings Family ... (1889), calls ...
Somerby 'a distinguished American genealogist ... living in London'.
The distinguishing aspect of Somerby's career must now be his fraud.&quot;

Au  Contraire.

Unless, now, we are maligning Ira Peck, as  well?

-------------
To say someone mispoke does not malign them.  If so, then we are all
maligned, you, I, every person can mispeak.  If he was relying on someone  else to
tell him thus-and-so and he repeated it (without citation), we've all  done that.

We however, are in the position today, to say, well... perhaps he repeated
this verbatim from some other source without citation, however, we know that he
could not have known the truth of the matter first-hand.

I know you can see that.  Ira Peck was not present in the 16th  century, all
he can say, or should have is, it *appears* to be, it *seems* to  be,
*evidently*.  He cannot know what occurred as a fact.

Recte:

Arnold is a would-be con artist.

He thinks if he just keeps playing dumb, belligerent and firing blanks then
people will feel sorry for him, want to &quot;educate&quot; him in _How To Do
Genealogy Properly_ and do his genealogical work for him.

TAF: &quot;I was simply (admittedly elliptically) drawing attention to the irony
of saying you know who someone is, while using the name of the leader
of a pre-Civil War leader of revolting slaves.&quot;

BA: You might term it a *faux pas* but I would rather called it my subconscious
speaking to me, and you all: you see I was born in St. Petersburg, Florida,
and my paternal ancestors go back to north Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and South
Carolina, and a tad into North Carolina, with a few RS thrown in for good measure:
it is my maternal lines which come
from the northern United States: and I had ancestors in both sides of the War
Between the States, including a few *Blue Turncoats* [no pun intended :)]
and for my M.F.A. thesis at UMass-Amherst I wrote a novel about a infamous
historical incident in west central Florida, in the 19-teens, albeit writing during
the turbulent days of Martin Luther King's marches, and it all turns on my awareness
of Nat Turner!
