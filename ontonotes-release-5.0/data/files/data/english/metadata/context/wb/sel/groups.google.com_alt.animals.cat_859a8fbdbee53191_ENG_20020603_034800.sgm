I have a cat that looks thin when looking from above or from behind her, but
when looking from the side she looks really fat. Almost like a pregnant
woman carrying all out the front.

This worries me because she does not eat much. She will be two in August
and is desexed. I know that desexed cats have problems withtheir weight but
this was beginning before then. The vet had to cut out chunks of fat in
order to be able to desex her.

She eats more dry food then moist and if I give her a fresh kidney, she'll
eat less than 1/2 of it. That is how little she eats.

Any ideas as to what it may be?? She is a domestic short hair and can get
quite active at times - especially at night when she plays with the kitten.
They run around the house like madmen.

"/> Cats are all different. It might be a good idea to take her to the vets
to get her weighed accurately, and to check for any underlying health
problems. If she is overweight the cure is the same as for humans - eat
fewer calories, take more exercise.

And she really ate a lot. Now she discovered that she loves dry food and: 1.
eats significantly less and 2. grows fat.

Overweight cats have a tendency to develop diabetes. Please cut her food
back. If you are free feeding; then start feeding her twice a day. I am a
vet tech of 17 years, as well as a small animal dietician so if you need
advise on types of food, etc.. then just write to my email address.
Please don't feed her raw meat. There are sooo many things she can pick up
from it. i.e. toxoplasmosis, parasites, etc... If you want to feed her
meat then use chicken or lamb and cook it well. I lived in Australia for a
year and I know it is common practice there, but that doesn't mean it's the
right thing to do.
As for the canned food, it is 78% water by volume, and the rest is grease
so as a treat fine, but not as the main source of nourishment. I am
mentioning these things because I read the other answers to this post.
Write back if you'd like to go further with this.
Ciao, Denise

Great Idea but if I cut her food back she would be getting Jack all. She is
free fed at night only because she is outside during the day but the dry
food lasts so long that I know she is barely eating anything - mind you the
dry food is available to the other cat and the two jackie x dogs and I am
barely needing to buy any. So as you can see I cannot cut her food back.
But I can understand your concern as I am an animal tech and this has even
baffled the vet who saw her, and my course instructors.

When you say she is outside during the day, is she just roaming or in a
pen?? If she is free to wander she may have found some well meaning soul
who is feeding her. ( Ive found that people who have never had a cat, being
ignorant of their ways, assume because the cat crosses theyre garden on a
regular basis it must be lost or stray).

Ive also had experience of a neighbour (some years ago) who deliberately set
out to coax one of ours away with rich food. He put on weight and kept
being sick. As fast as we cut his food down she upped hers. I didnt realise
immediately but started to suspect someone must be feeding him when he was
bringing up completely undigested food ( sorry to the squeamish) which didnt
look like what we were giving him ( by this time a vets diet food). So I
kept an eye on him for a few days to see where he was going ( not an easy
task) and caught her giving him what looked like cheap, greasy corned beef.
Needless to say a row ensued!!

Its also possible for her to be going in through someone elses cat flap and
helping herself.

I hope its something as simple as above and not a health prob.
