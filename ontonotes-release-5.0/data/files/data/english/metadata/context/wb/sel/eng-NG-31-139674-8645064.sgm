So there we were in the final of the Cambria Cup, Wales' national
mixed pivot aggregate k/o.  Normal sort of stuff: final arranged two to
three months after the last allowed date, both teams growling about the
other team's unreasonableness over dates, the new NTO [National
Tournament Organiser] growling that this will never happen again [that's
what his predecessor said when he took over: that's what *his*
predecessor said when she took over!], and then ...........

At a few days notice we lose our female.  Not sure what her problem
is, but that is none of my business - now what?

NTO checks rules, growls at everyone impartially, everyone wants to
play match, substitute permitted, cannot find one, surely we can, it's a
bank holiday [public holiday], surely someone is free.

So my wife gets to play.  I don't do anything stupid like tell her it
is a national final, of course.

I have been told to bring stationery and possibly bidding boxes [once
told yes, once told no] so I do: score-cards, blank convention cards,
books of Laws and Regulations, lots of bidding boxes.

These matches between North and South Wales teams always used to be
tricky because where do you play?  But we have solved that: we have
found a small hotel in Ludlow which modestly claims to be the
best-looking inn in the world and has two small meeting rooms on either
side of the front door - perfect!

So, there we are.  We have four, they have five [two females!],
everyone is there, we have the stationery, we shall use the hotel's
tables, we toss, and ............

Where are the boards?

&quot;You were bringing the boards.&quot;
&quot;No, you agreed to.&quot;
&quot;You said you would bring the stationery.&quot;
&quot;Yes, and we did: but not the boards.&quot;

A few phone calls get no answers.  Checks in local books, on the
internet by phone and with the hotel produce no bridge club in Ludlow.
Now what?

My wife is getting bored.  &quot;All you need are a few packs of cards and
some envelopes,&quot; she says.

So we have just played a 48-board national final with eight packs of
cards and 32 envelopes, one for each player on each of eight boards. You
write North, South, East or West and the board number on each envelope:
then for each subsequent stanza you amend the board number on the
envelope by adding eight.

Sadly, we lost.  1400 lost in the second stanza: we lost by slightly
less than that.  But it was an experience!
