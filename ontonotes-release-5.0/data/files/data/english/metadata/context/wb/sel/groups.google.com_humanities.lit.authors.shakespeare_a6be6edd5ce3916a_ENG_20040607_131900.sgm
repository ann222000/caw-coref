During my visit to Baltimore in April, there was a discussion among myself,
Lynne Kositsky, Roger Stritmatter, and Terry Ross about the greatest poem in
English. It might make an interesting thread if HLAS posters were to list
their nominations.

I'll start it off. My nomination is Walt Whitman's &quot;When Lilacs Last in the
Dooryard Bloom'd&quot;

I cannot talk about the greatest. I can only speak of my favourite. I
probably mentioned it in Baltimore: &quot;Dover Beach&quot; by Arnold.

I am also pretty nuts about &quot;Donal Og&quot; as translated by Lady Gregory. It
tears my heart out. But then everyone around here says that Oxfordians are
incurable romantics.

Yes, you did mention it. I thought it better you bring it up than I quote
our private conversation. So is it Arnold's stunning conclusion that grabs
you, with the ignorant armies clashing by night?

If we are allowed a second choice, I would pick Donne's &quot;Death be not

I doubt that &quot;greatest poem in English&quot; really has any meaning, but the
one I keep coming back to is Charles Williams' &quot;Bors to Elayne: On the
King's Coins&quot;.

This is quite an interesting anthology. So far we have Frost's &quot;Mending

Long poem: Faerie Queene by Spenser

Short poem:

Futility by Wilfred Owen

Move him into the sun -
Gently its touch awoke him once,
At home, whispering of fields unsown.
Always it woke him, even in France,
Until this morning and this snow.
If anything might rouse him now
The kind old sun will know.

Think how it wakes the seeds -
Woke, once, the clays of a cold star.
Are limbs so dear-achieved, are sides
Full-nerved, - still warm, - too hard to stir?
Was it for this the clay grew tall?
- O what made fatuous sunbeams toil
To break earth's sleep at all?

Oh dear, people are naming all my favourite poets, and I shall have to

poems, including Dylan Thomas's &quot;Fern Hill.&quot;

A friend used to live in Northampton, Mass, and we spent hours hiking in the

Too bad this one doesn't qualify as a poem. Or does it?

But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so brigh
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!

it.

I hope you don't imagine this line is about anything as banal as Time,
Lynne. Just imagine for a moment what Magister Crowley could do with it.

Actually I had a Crowley acolyte in one of my first-year classes a few weeks
ago. We were looking at the passage in &lt;Antony and Cleopatra&gt; where
Enobarbus describes their first meeting:

The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne
Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold ...

She (the student) offered a novel (indeed, ground-breaking) Crowleyite
&quot;exegesis&quot; of the second half of the second line. I have to admit I laughed
out loud, which is a definite no-no, but I was taken completely by surprise.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll start it off. My nomination is Walt Whitman's &quot;When Lilacs Last
&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dooryard Bloom'd&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Gerard Manley Hopkins: &quot;The Wreck of the Deutschland&quot;

&gt;&gt; Oh, jeez, Buff, I love that too, although I haven't looked at it for too
&gt;&gt; many years to count. &quot;I am soft sift in an hourglass.&quot; I still remember
&gt; it.

&gt; I hope you don't imagine this line is about anything as banal as Time,
&gt; Lynne. Just imagine for a moment what Magister Crowley could do with it.

&gt; Actually I had a Crowley acolyte in one of my first-year classes a few
weeks
&gt; ago. We were looking at the passage in &lt;Antony and Cleopatra&gt; where
&gt; Enobarbus describes their first meeting:

&gt; The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne
&gt; Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold ...

&gt; She (the student) offered a novel (indeed, ground-breaking) Crowleyite
&gt;&quot;exegesis&quot; of the second half of the second line. I have to admit I
laughed
&gt; out loud, which is a definite no-no, but I was taken completely by
surprise.

Dr. Groves, what would your choice be for &quot;Greatest poem in English&quot;? You
are a fan of Pope, I understand; would it be &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;?

poem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in English. It might make an interesting thread if HLAS posters were

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Neil Brennen

&gt;&gt;&gt; Long poem: Faerie Queene by Spenser

&gt;&gt;&gt; Short poem:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Futility by Wilfred Owen

&gt;&gt;&gt; Move him into the sun -
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gently its touch awoke him once,
&gt;&gt;&gt; At home, whispering of fields unsown.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Always it woke him, even in France,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Until this morning and this snow.
&gt;&gt;&gt; If anything might rouse him now
&gt;&gt;&gt; The kind old sun will know.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Think how it wakes the seeds -
&gt;&gt;&gt; Woke, once, the clays of a cold star.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are limbs so dear-achieved, are sides
&gt;&gt;&gt; Full-nerved, - still warm, - too hard to stir?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Was it for this the clay grew tall?
&gt;&gt;&gt; - O what made fatuous sunbeams toil
&gt;&gt;&gt; To break earth's sleep at all?

&gt;&gt; Well, I think I now know why I'm on hlas. Our authorship ideas might
&gt;&gt; diverge, but our tastes certainly agree. I adore Owen too. My favourite,
I
&gt;&gt; believe, begins: &quot;It seemed that out of battle I escaped down some
profound
&gt;&gt; long tunnel...&quot;&quot;Strange Meeting?&quot;

&gt;&gt; Lynne

&gt; Too bad this one doesn't qualify as a poem. Or does it?

&gt; http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/romeo_2_2.html

&gt; But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
&gt; It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
&gt; Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
&gt; Who is already sick and pale with grief,
&gt; That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
&gt; Be not her maid, since she is envious;
&gt; Her vestal livery is but sick and green
&gt; And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
&gt; It is my lady, O, it is my love!
&gt; O, that she knew she were!
&gt; She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
&gt; Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
&gt; I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
&gt; Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
&gt; Having some business, do entreat her eyes
&gt; To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
&gt; What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
&gt; The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
&gt; As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
&gt; Would through the airy region stream so brigh
&gt; That birds would sing and think it were not night.
&gt; See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
&gt; O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
&gt; That I might touch that cheek!

It's definitely an anthology piece.

The poem can be found at &lt;&gt;; it
starts:

SOMETHING there is that doesn't love a wall,
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.

Ooh, er...so do I. And if I had the poem with me now I could remember it
even better. But something like &quot;I am soft-sift in an hourglass at the wall,
fast... but something something...it crowds and it combs to the fall&quot;.

I recorded Paul Schofield's reading off BBC Radio 3 in 1975, using a hefty
old Ferrograph open-reel tape-recorder. I've still got the tape, but the
Ferrograph alas....So I haven't actually played it for years.

His &quot;Vergissmeinnicht&quot; has always been a favourite of mine (he was a young
tank officer in North Africa when he wrote it):

Vergissmeinnicht

Three weeks gone and the combatants gone
returning over the nightmare ground
we found the place again, and found
the soldier sprawling in the sun.

The frowning barrel of his gun
overshadowing. As we came on
that day, he hit my tank with one
like the entry of a demon.

Look. Here in the gunpit, spoil:
the dishonoured picture of his girl
who has put: &quot;Steffi. Vergissmeinnicht&quot;. [i.e. forget-me-not&quot;]
in a copybook gothic script.

We see him almost with content,
abased, and seeming to have paid
and mocked at by his own equipment
that's hard and good when he's decayed.

But she would weep to see today
how on his skin the swart flies move;
the dust upon the paper eye
and the burst stomach like a cave.

For here the lover and killer are mingled
who had one body and one heart.
And death who had the soldier singled
has done the lover mortal hurt.

&gt; Actually I had a Crowley acolyte in one of my first-year classes a few weeks
&gt; ago. We were looking at the passage in &lt;Antony and Cleopatra&gt; where
&gt; Enobarbus describes their first meeting:

&gt; The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne
&gt; Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold ...

&gt; She (the student) offered a novel (indeed, ground-breaking) Crowleyite
&gt;&quot;exegesis&quot; of the second half of the second line. I have to admit I laughed
&gt; out loud, which is a definite no-no, but I was taken completely by surprise.

"/>

That student has a better feeling for Shakespeare
than you do. Get her to take the class in future.

There is nothing particularly novel in such an
interpretation of that passage. Read the whole
of it sometime, with a bit less innocence. And
see Rubenstein, (1984):

AC. ii.ii.200: 'the poop was beaten gold ... The winds were love sick . . . the oars
were silver,/ Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made/ The water which
they beat to follow faster,/ As amorous of their strokes . . . pretty dimpled boys ,
. . With divers-colour'd fans. whose wind did seem/To glow the delicate cheeks
which they did cool'.
It is difficult but helpful if one can overcome a reluctance to see bawdiness in
this erotic poetry. Cleopatra the beautiful and alluring is also Cleopatra, 'triple-
turn'd whore'; and the speaker is Enobarbus, whose views on women in general
and Cleopatra (the 'Egyptian dish') in particular. are most cynical (i.ii). Kittredge
(p. 1372) speaks of the seeming inconsistency of gorgeous poetry' coming from
Enobarbus. who, he says, by l. 230 has descended' to his usual tone. But that
has been Enobarbus's level throughout.
These lines contain an implicit pun on flutes or flageolets/ flagellates (beats or
strikes). esp. as a sexual perversion. In the context of 'beaten'. 'beat'. 'stroke' and
'strokes', all to the tune of flutes, the love-sick WINDS (coital embraces) and
WINDS (farts - Partridge) that are evoked (the winds from the sea and the fans)
are those of the area most frequently BEATEN and stroked (strike: fuck - Colman;
Partidge), the arse - or, as Enobarbus says. 'the poop. Cf. Etherege The Man of
Mode. iii.iii: 'That's one of the walking flageolets who haunt the Mall o' nights, said
Belinda, of one who had said of her. 'I like the oily buttock'.
Note the COLOUR/culare (arse-gut - Florio) FANS/fins (musical ends; buttocks)
of these pretty dimpled boys (see VARY); and the wind that came from them and
did COOL/ cul (arse) the CHEEKS or buttocks (see POOP)
(Rubenstein, page 103)

AC, ii.ii.197. One is reluctant to see the pun on disease in this, Sh's third and last
use of 'poop', but it is there and it serves a purpose. Acknowledging Cleopatra's
dissipation and disease even while praising her beauty is what one ought expect
from the cynical Enobarbus (FLUTE), who concludes his speech, 'vilest things/
Become themselves in her; that the holy priests/ Bless her when she is riggish
[rig: a strumpet]' -just as Enobarbus does: 'The barge she sat in like a burnish'd
throne,/ Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold;/ Purple the sails, and so
perfumed that/The winds were love-sick with them'.
Many of the puns in 1H4 above are repeated: she sat in a barge that like a burnish'd
throne burn'd, burning with VD (OED) - suggestive of a fire-ship (sufferer from
VD - OED; a tainted whore - F&amp;H); her purple sails evoke 'Dives that lived in
purple ... in his robes, burning, burning'. The sails are perfumed (L perfumis, smoke)
with smoke - from the burning fire (sexual heat and disease - C); the wind is
love-sick or venereally sick (Venus: goddess of love; venereal: exciting sexual desire)
like the men in Tim, iv.iii.207, who hug their 'diseased perfumes' or whores.
'A strange invisible perfume hits the sense [/ scents; the cense or incense used for
fumigation of diseases]/ Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast/ Her people out upon
her'. This is an awkward way to say only that the city emptied out to see her. but
Sh is punning: (1) a 'casting' bottle was used to sprinkle perfume, as in Marston,
Antonio and Mellida, iii.ii; (2) the city cast or vomited, CAST (ejected waste) on her.
'Cast urine' is diagnose disease; and she whom Enobarbus said custom
(whoring- C; P) could not stale (a whore; urine) is like the wappen'd' (sexually
stale - C; fucked - F&amp;H) widow in Tim, iv.iii.40: 'She, whom the spital-house and
ulcerous sores/Would cast the gorge at'. Both sick women elicit vomiting: that
wappen'd, lit. beaten, widow with her beaten poop; and Cleopatra whosat on her
poop of beaten GOLD (excrement; a whore), sat on her burning or venereally
diseased THRONE (toilet).
Cleopatra, 'triple-turned whore' (Iv.xii.13) is a symbol of ravage and disease, as is
borne out also in her other name, 'serpent of old Nile' (I.v.25). 'El mal serpentina':
1493, syphilis (Richard Burton, p. 89); 'serpent' and 'serpigo' (VD - P) both stem
from Latin serpere, to creep. Cleopatra, serpent of old Nile, is like that serpent of
Gen 3:1-5, and, like him, she brings about another downfall of man, of Antony.
It is fitting that she dies, symbolically, from her own disease, the bite of a serpent
that she calls a 'worm' (WORM: syphilis; moral decay). See LEPROSY: THRONE;
SURE.

Sorry. I recognize that the idea of one poem as Greatest Poem in English is
absurd, but it got everyone talking about poetry. This may be the only
rancor-free thread in HLAS history. Also, I've gotten a couple of good
suggestions for future reading.

I'll

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; nominate Kipling's &quot;Recessional&quot;, not because I really believe that it
&gt; should be called the greatest poem in the English language but because
&gt; it is the one that I would most like every English speaker to know by
&gt; heart.

"/>

So far the list includes:

Milton - Paradise Lost
Spencer - Farie Queen
Whitman - When Lilacs Last...
Arnold - Dover Beach
Kipling - Recessional
Cummings - Buffalo Bill
Frost - Mending Wall
Williams - Bors to Elayne
Macniece - Bagpipe Music
Nash - Reflections on Ice-Breaking
Owen - Strange Meeting
Owen - Anthem for Doomed Youth
Owen - Futility
Donne - Death Be Not Proud
Anon. - Donal Og (Translation by Lady Gregory)
Anon. - Old Mother Hubbard
Hopkins - The Wreck of the Deutschland
Hopkins - Pied Beauty
Hopkins - The Windhover
Shakespeare - What Light Through Yonder Window (Excerpt from Romeo and
Juliet)
And a poem by Douglas that I can't find the title of.

I've cheated a little and included other poems that were mentioned in the
thread; also, one of the poems is a translation (Donal Og) and one an
excerpt from a verse play. It's interesting that none of Shakespeare's
poetry, aside from the Romeo and Juliet excerpt, has been nominated.

&gt; Oh dear, people are naming all my favourite
&gt; poets, and I shall have to reread. I have
&gt;&quot;Mending Wall&quot; up on my own wall, together
&gt; with a few other poems, including Dylan
&gt; Thomas's &quot;Fern Hill.&quot;

&gt; A friend used to live in Northampton, Mass,
&gt; and we spent hours hiking in the Holyoke range,
&gt; where Frost must have walked before writing
&gt;&quot;Two Paths Diverged,&quot; etc. It was a kind of
&gt; magic to walk where he walked before.

"/>

&quot;Mending Wall&quot; was written in England, in fact,
about 4 miles from where I am right now, and -
with World War I looming - at a good time to
ask whether &quot;good fences make good neighbours&quot;!

I'm with Peter G. and Tom V. on the supremacy
of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; for the *greatest*, but my
*favourites* tend to be those that I like
performing most. By now, we have delivered
over one and a half thousand different items
at our monthly poetry readings, so quite a
few to choose from!

I think my favourite poem from &quot;our&quot; period
would be Marlowe's erotic and amusing trans-
lation of Ovid's *Amores*, Book 1, Elegy 5:

&quot;In summer's heat, and mid-time of the day,
To rest my limbs, upon a bed I lay&quot;

As for more modern one's, my taste is pretty
conservative, and I'd include things like:

Robert Browning, &quot;My Last Duchess&quot;
Hilaire Belloc, &quot;Tarantella&quot;
Leigh Hunt, &quot;Jenny Kissed Me&quot;
John Keats, &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;
Rudyard Kipling, &quot;Lichtenberg&quot;
D H Lawrence, &quot;Mountain Lion&quot;,
John Gillespie Magee, &quot;High Flight&quot;
Henry Reed, &quot;Naming of Parts&quot;
Shelley, &quot;Ozymandias&quot;, and
Tennyson, &quot;The Lady of Shallott&quot;

I also love Paul Durcan's &quot;A Cold Wind Blew
in from Lake Geneva&quot;, and just about anything
by Roger McGough.

Paul, nobody (I trust) doubts that the passage is highly erotic, and deals
with the sexual charisma of power (there's a kind of masochism in the
reference to &quot;The water which they beat ... amorous of their strokes&quot;) but
I need to tell you that most people don't find shit particularly sexy; I
realise that you and your fantasy Oxford may be exceptions to this rule.
Your efforts to impose a scatological reading are not, however, supported by
the OED, which records the first such use of &quot;poop&quot; from almost 150 years
later: &quot;c1744 in Oxf. Dict. Nursery Rhymes (1951) 372 Little Robin red
breast, Sitting on a pole, Niddle, Noddle, Went his head, And Poop went his
Hole&quot;
It's true that colloquial usage always predates the literary record, but 150
years is a long time, and --- given the (general) irrelevance (for most
people) of turds and farts to sexual desire --- I think we can rule out a
pun in the A&amp;C passage.

I know this is a Shakespeare forum, but am wondering if we could discuss

Hopefully the authorship question could rest during those times, as we all

&gt; Sorry. I recognize that the idea of one poem as Greatest Poem in English
is
&gt; absurd, but it got everyone talking about poetry. This may be the only
&gt; rancor-free thread in HLAS history. Also, I've gotten a couple of good
&gt; suggestions for future reading.

&gt; I'll
&gt;&gt; nominate Kipling's &quot;Recessional&quot;, not because I really believe that it
&gt;&gt; should be called the greatest poem in the English language but because
&gt;&gt; it is the one that I would most like every English speaker to know by
&gt;&gt; heart.

&gt; So far the list includes:

&gt; Milton - Paradise Lost
&gt; Spencer - Farie Queen
&gt; Whitman - When Lilacs Last...
&gt; Arnold - Dover Beach
&gt; Kipling - Recessional
&gt; Cummings - Buffalo Bill
&gt; Frost - Mending Wall
&gt; Williams - Bors to Elayne
&gt; Macniece - Bagpipe Music
&gt; Nash - Reflections on Ice-Breaking
&gt; Owen - Strange Meeting
&gt; Owen - Anthem for Doomed Youth
&gt; Owen - Futility
&gt; Donne - Death Be Not Proud
&gt; Anon. - Donal Og (Translation by Lady Gregory)

I thought these were to be English language poems.

I can't read it in the original to make the comparison, Tom (perhaps Phil

translation is a very free one, particlarly as the original dates back so
many hundreds of years. In any case, I didn't name it as my favourite, just
as a poem I'm madly in love with. Nobody else seems to understand why. :(

There are just a few poems that I have trouble
reciting in public for fear of choking up. This
is one of them. If you are the romantic you say
you are, beware!

&lt;quote&gt;

MOUNTAIN LION
D.H. Lawrence

Climbing through the January snow, into the Lobo Canyon
Dark grow the spruce-trees, blue is the balsam, water
sounds still unfrozen, and the trail is still evident.

Men!
Two men!
Men! The only animal in the world to fear!

They hesitate.
We hesitate.
They have a gun.
We have no gun.

Then we all advance, to meet.

Two Mexicans, strangers, emerging our of the dark
and snow and inwardness of the Lobo valley.
What are they doing here on this vanishing trail?

What is he carrying?
Something yellow.
A deer?

&quot;Qué tiene, amigo?&quot;
&quot;Leon -&quot;

He smiles foolishly as if he were caught doing wrong.
And we smile, foolishly, as if we didn't know.
He is quite gentle and dark-faced.

It is a mountain lion,
A long, long, slim cat, yellow like a lioness.
Dead.

He trapped her this morning, he says, smiling
foolishly.

Lift up her face,
Her round, bright face, bright as frost.
Her round, fine-fashioned head, with two dead ears;
And stripes in the brilliant frost of her face, sharp,
fine dark rays,
Dark, keen, fine rays in the brilliant frost of her
face.
Beautiful dead eyes.

&quot;Hermoso es!&quot;

They go out towards the open;
We go on into the gloom of Lobo.
And above the trees I found her lair,
A hole in the blood-orange brilliant rocks that stick
up, a little cave.
And bones, and twigs, and a perilous ascent.

So, she will never leap up that way again, with the
yellow flash of a mountain lion's long shoot!
And her bright striped frost-face will never watch
any more, out of the shadow of the cave in the
blood-orange rock,
Above the trees of the Lobo dark valley-mouth!

Instead, I look out.
And out to the dim of the desert, like a dream, never
real;
To the snow of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the
ice of the mountains of Picoris,
And near across at the opposite steep of snow, green
trees motionless standing in snow, like a Christmas
toy.

And I think in this empty world there was room for me
and a mountain lion.
And I think in the world beyond, how easily we might
spare a million or two humans
And never miss them.
Yet what a gap in the world, the missing white frost-
face of that slim yellow mountain lion!

Whitman's poetry is uneven in quality, but &quot;When Lilacs...&quot; is superb. It
more than makes up for his lesser poetry.

As for Whitman being more popular in the US than the rest of the world, I
would agree. Whitman's subject is the United States, after all. A decade ago
I knew a woman who was applying for US citizenship, and she was due to give
a speech for her citizenship class. I suggested she read Whitman, and she
based her speech on &quot;I hear America singing&quot;. It reminded her why she loved
my country. And hearing her talk about Whitman reminded me of why I love my
country.

he?

&gt;&gt; That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
&gt;&gt; And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
&gt;&gt; And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.

&gt; While we are quoting pop culture, one of Stephen King's novellas has a scene
&gt; in which the protagonist recites &quot;Mending Wall&quot; as a distraction to his
&gt; predicament. Sorry, I don't recall which novella.

"/>

I read &quot;Carrie,&quot; after having seen the movie, and didn't like it as
much as the movie. Then I read &quot;Christine.&quot; (Both borrowed from the
library.) The copy of &quot;Christine&quot; was not permitted to be in my
bedroom after dark, and when on the living room table had to be face
down so that the cover illustration (the staring headlights) could not
be seen. I think that was the last King I've read, and that was at
least twenty years ago, though my mother not long ago gave me a couple
of his recent books, which I still haven't read. The last book she'd
lent me, though, was some hideously depressing novel about life in a
Philadelphia ghetto, where a mother loses her teenage son to the gangs
and drug dealers, she goes to a priest, whose church is being closed,
he gets beat up, the kid gets beat up, the priest gets out of the
hospital and gets beat up again, and then the two of them are both
finally beaten to death and the mother (named Ofelia, as it happens)
&quot;gets&quot; to start a new life. The kid is an incredibly talented artist,
it turns out, much too sensitive to have been born into that
neighborhood. He just can't take his mother's grief over having lost
her husband, so he leaves home to start a career and a new life.

Lynne (whose favourite poems in this department are unintentionally funny
and by William McGonagall).

P.S. Have I before posted his rather long and excruciating poem about
Shakespeare? It makes me glad to be an Oxfordian.

Here 'tis:

An Address to Shakespeare
Immortal! William Shakespeare, there's none can you excel,
You have drawn out your characters remarkably well,
Which is delightful for to see enacted upon the stage
For instance, the love-sick Romeo, or Othello, in a rage;
His writings are a treasure, which the world cannot repay,
He was the greatest poet of the past or of the present day
Also the greatest dramatist, and is worthy of the name,
I'm afraid the world shall never look upon his like again.
His tragedy of Hamlet is moral and sublime,
And for purity of language, nothing can be more fine
For instance, to hear the fair Ophelia making her moan,
At her father's grave, sad and alone....
In his beautiful play, &quot;As You Like It,&quot; one passage is very fine,
Just for instance in fhe forest of Arden, the language is sublime,
Where Orlando speaks of his Rosilind, most lovely and divine,
And no other poet I am sure has written anything more fine;
His language is spoken in the Church and by the Advocate at the bar,
Here and there and everywhere throughout the world afar;
His writings abound with gospel truths, moral and sublime,
And I'm sure in my opinion they are surpassing fine;
In his beautiful tragedy of Othello, one passage is very fine,
Just for instance where Cassio looses his lieutenancy
... By drinking too much wine;
And in grief he exclaims, &quot;Oh! that men should put an
Enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains.&quot;
In his great tragedy of Richard the III, one passage is very fine
Where the Duchess of York invokes the aid of the Divine
For to protect her innocent babes from the murderer's uplifted hand,
And smite him powerless, and save her babes, I'm sure 'tis really grand.
Immortal! Bard of Avon, your writings are divine,
And will live in the memories of your admirers until the end of time;
Your plays are read in family circles with wonder and delight,
While seated around the fireside on a cold winter's night.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Enobarbus describes their first meeting:

&gt;&gt;&gt; The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne
&gt;&gt;&gt; Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold ...

&gt;&gt; There is nothing particularly novel in such an

_point_ of the poet putting in all the
eroticism and masochism you claim to see --
with your perverted imagination? This is
a plain description of a glorious celebration
on a wonderful day.

How many millions have read or heard that
scene and enjoyed its glory so clearly and
beautifully delineated by our Great Bard,
without the remotest thought any of the
filthy muck you read into it? Do you
seriously claim that the audiences at the
Globe -- and at the court of Queen Elizabeth,
with her and and all her courtiers in the
audience -- would have understood what
you claim is in that speech? Or that, if they
had for one second thought it was present,
not objected to Master Shakespeare and the
theatre company in the strongest possible
terms? He would never have been allowed
to appear at court again. And most of those
thought responsible in the company would
have been dismissed.

Your whole theory is ludicrous,

Sexy? Are we supposed to be amused by
finding that kind of material in our national
works? It is to be noted that it is only
'found' by those who go over the text word
by word, finding 'meanings' which are not
at all apparent to ordinary decent theatre-
goers. Even if people did go to the theatre
with such thoughts in their mind, they
would scarcely ever notice any of these so-
called meanings, given the speed of action
in the play. They would not even have
enough time to nudge the ribs of any like-
minded neighbours for a quickly shared
snigger. And, may I say, that although I
have attended numerous performances of
this play, not once have I seen any
untoward behaviour by any of the
audience. In fact, I would go so far as to
say that it is quite unheard of.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

What rule?

Until you have the beginnings of some
theory as to what ANY of all this disgusting
filth is doing an historical play about the
classical world -- written for the edification
and instruction of the minds of our young
people -- then you are in no position to
legislate as to what kind of filth you think
should be in such works, as against the kind
you'd prefer to keep out.

I like a lot of the poems already
included,

but I would like to add

the poems of Byron, Brooke,
Francis Thompson,
Thomas Gray,
Keats, Shelley,
Edward Thomas,
R. S. Thomas,
Yeats,

(etc.!)

and translations of

Pushkin

and

Basho!

and more Hopkins...

(from an earlier posting)

...up above, what wind-walks! what lovely behaviour
Of silk-sack clouds! has wilder, wilful-wavier
Meal-drift moulded ever and melted across across skies?
* * * * * *
The glass-blue days are those
When every colour glows,
Each shape and shadow shows.
Blue be it: this blue heaven
The seven or seven times seven
Hued sunbeam will transmit
Perfect, not alter it.
Or if there does some soft,
On things aloof, aloft,
Bloom breathe, that one breath more
Earth is the fairer for...
* * * * * *
But what's to see in stormy weather,
When grey showers gather and gusts are cool? -
Why raindrop-roundels looped together
That lace the face of Penmaen Pool.

That even in weariest wintry hour
Of New Year's month or surly Yule
Furred snows, charged tuft above tuft, tower
From darksome darksome Penmaen Pool.
* * * * * *

...or night, still higher,
With belled fire and the moth-soft Milky Way,
What by your measure is the heaven of desire,
The treasure never eyesight got, nor was ever guessed what for the hearing?
* * * * * *
Only the breathing temple and fleet
Life, this wildworth blown so sweet...
* * * * * *
That a starlight-wender of ours would say
The marvellous Milk was Walsingham Way
And one - but let be, let be;
More, more than was will yet be. -

&gt;&gt; I have just read Neil's favourite poem, &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard
&gt;&gt; Bloom'd.&quot; I don't know Whitman very well at all,

&gt; Lynne! For shame! He's one of the Fellowship's Hall of Skeptics!

&gt; not having grown up or
&gt;&gt; lived in the States, where he is popular. I was really moved by the poem,
&gt;&gt; especially because lilacs are emblematic for me too. I could explain that
&gt; at
&gt;&gt; a later time.

&gt; Whitman's poetry is uneven in quality, but &quot;When Lilacs...&quot; is superb. It
&gt; more than makes up for his lesser poetry.

&gt; As for Whitman being more popular in the US than the rest of the world, I
&gt; would agree. Whitman's subject is the United States, after all. A decade ago
&gt; I knew a woman who was applying for US citizenship, and she was due to give
&gt; a speech for her citizenship class. I suggested she read Whitman, and she
&gt; based her speech on &quot;I hear America singing&quot;. It reminded her why she loved
&gt; my country. And hearing her talk about Whitman reminded me of why I love my
&gt; country.

There's always:
I sing the body electric,
The armies of those I love engirth me, and I engirth them.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all of my days,
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

The theme is so Shakespearean. It's distinctively Elizabethan, and the more
I read it the more I like it. (Read it quickly and out loud -- it flows
beautifully.) It is very densely packed, and full of complex imagery. The
author shows a willingness to break rules. In this case it's addressed to a
dominating and rather fear-inspiring woman -- although
the author is not afraid to say what he thinks about her in the poem. If it
is Oxford's (as I am now fairly sure) the only likely candidate would be
Elizabeth, and that would have been the reason for excluding it from the
Canon.

When I was 16 years old, I was passionately devoted to the work of Walt
Whitman.
Even a 16-year-old, of course, with any discernment, discerns that Whitman's
poetry is uneven; some of it is just downright godawful. But I especially
loved &quot;When lilacs...&quot;. I would often seek solitude and read it aloud to
myself,
over and over and over again.

When I grew to man's estate, I began to find all of Whitman utterly unreadable,
and I simply cannot read him to this day. I sometimes wonder whether I would
find
his poetry appealing now had I not loved it then.

I don't have it in front of me, so I'm paraphrasing from memory, but in his
&quot;Devil's Dictionary&quot;, Ambrose Bierce defined the word &quot;incompossibles&quot; as,
roughly,
things that cannot possibly coexist, and gave as an example Walt Whitman's
poetry and God's mercy to man--a sentiment that I have come to appreciate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;A good idea. I still find it odd that no one mentioned Shakespeare as a

I think that Shakespeare's sonnets, taken as a whole, constitute the finest
lyric poetry in English. But they are not a unitary work, and it would be
difficult indeed to pick one of them and say that this single lyric is the
finest in the language (as if one could meaningfully say such a thing about
any single lyric).

But allow me to add to the growing list of people's favorites a few of my own.

&quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot; and &quot;Is My Team Plowing&quot;, by A.E. Housman. I suppose Housman
has suffered something of a critical eclipse, but his best is very good indeed.
These are my favorites.

&quot;Channel Firing&quot; by Thomas Hardy. Hardy is the only writer in English I can
think of who was both a great novelist and a great poet, and this is fittingly
his most famous poem. The last lines are, to me, among the most beautifully
modulated
words in English:

Again the guns disturbed the hour,
Roaring their readiness to avenge,
As far inland as Stourton Tower,
And Camelot, and starlit Stonehenge.

&quot;September 1, 1939&quot; by W.H. Auden. Read it and weep. A model of a poet's
&quot;engagement&quot; in the world. &quot;All I have is a voice / to undo the folded lie....&quot;

&quot;Felix Randall&quot; by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Others have mentioned other poems
by Hopkins; this is a particular favorite of mine. Orwell wrote a lovely piece
about it.

&quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; by Coleridge. I'm kind of surprised no one
else has proposed this. An astonishing piece of work.

&quot;The City of Dreadful Night&quot; by James Thomson. This is the 19th-century poet
of that name, not the 18th-century poet of &quot;The Seasons&quot; and &quot;The Castle of
Indolence&quot;. Not very well known nowadays, but &quot;The City of Dreadful Night&quot;,
while
certainly a deeply flawed work, is one of the most powerful things I've ever
read.
Unlike the other poems I've proposed, this one is perhaps unknown to many who
read
the present lines; here is an online copy:

&quot;Dover Beach&quot; by Matthew Arnold. Others have proposed it, and I second that
emotion.
Many years ago, when I was first exposed to computers (this was before PCs), I
was
learning the text editor of the system I worked on, and used &quot;Dover Beach&quot; as
practice
text. So I typed in the last stanza, only to find the next day that someone on
this
multi-user system had altered it. It read as follows:

Ah, love, let us be true
To one another! for the world, which seems
To lie before us like a land of dreams,
So various, so beautiful, so new,
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;
And we are here as on a darkling plain
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,
Where ignorant armies clash by night,
And where every little breeze
Seems to whisper Louise
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

This of course leads one to remember the immortal Spike Milligan's immortal
parody
of the immortal John Masefield's immortal &quot;Sea Fever&quot;:

I must go down to the sea again,
to the lonely sea and the sky,
I left my vest and socks there:
I wonder if they're dry?

But perhaps I digress. Forgive the long excursus from a habitual lurker.

Bierce is wonderfully quotable, but he hates everyone. Some of his poetry is
amusing as a product of a second-rate misanthropic W. S. Gilbert. His parody
of the Star Spangled Banner and his translation of the Dies Ire (one line he
renders as &quot;cats from every bag escaping&quot;) come to mind, as does the poem

One of my reasons for not quoting any Housman is that I think my judgement
is warped by over-familiarity with the song settings by Vaughan-Williams,
George Butterworth, etc. That &quot;plies the saplings double&quot; line is
inseparable now from V-W's ghostly string tremolandos. I might be inclined
to think the line worth more than its due. But since you've picked it out, I
have to agree.

as Lord Burghley, was the Queen's principal adviser and a master of
intrigue who controlled an elaborate network of spies. In Hamlet, the
character Polonius is unquestionably a caricature of Burghley. His
position as advisor to the King, his physical appearance, his crafty
use of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to try to ascertain the cause
of Hamlet's ANTIC disposition, and his employment of Reynaldo

One of the poems signed &quot;E.O.&quot; in The Paradise of
Dainty Devices is clearly a song, as indicated by
the presence of a refrain. The lyrics read as follows:

A Croune of BAYS shall that man WEARe,
That triumphs over me:
For blacke and Tawnie WILL I WEARe,
Whiche mournyng colours be.
The more I folowed on, the more she fled awaie,
As Daphne did full long agone, Apollo's wishfull praie.
The more my plaints resounde, the lesse she pities me,
The more I saught the lesse I founde, that myne she ment to be.
Melpomeney, alas with dolefull tunes helpe than,
And syng bis wo worthe on me, forsaken man;
Then Daphne's baies shal that man WEARe, that triumphs over me,
For Blacke and Taunie WILL I WEARe, which mournyng colours be.
Droune me you tricklyng teares, you wailefull wights of woe,
Come help these hands to rent my heares, my rufull happs to showe:
On whom the scorchyng flames of love, doeth feede you se,
Ah, a lalalantida my deare dame, hath thus tormented me.
Wherefore you Muses nine, with dolefull tunes helpe than,
And syng Bis wo worthe on me forsaken man;
Then Daphne's Baies shall that man WEARe, that triumps over me,
For Blacke and Taunie WILL I WEARe, which mourning colours be.
An Ancre's life to leade, with NAILES to scratche my grave,
Where earthly Wormes on me shall fede, is all the joyes I crave;
And hide my self from shame, sith that myne eyes doe see,
Ah, a alantida my deare dame, hath thus tormented me.
And all that present be, with dolefull tunes helpe than:
And syng Bis woe worthe on me, forsaken man. Finis. E.O.

says...
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;During my visit to Baltimore in April, there was a discussion among myself,
&gt;Lynne Kositsky, Roger Stritmatter, and Terry Ross about the greatest poem in
&gt;English. It might make an interesting thread if HLAS posters were to list
&gt;their nominations.

&gt;I'll start it off. My nomination is Walt Whitman's &quot;When Lilacs Last in the
&gt;Dooryard Bloom'd&quot;

&gt;Neil Brennen

"/>

Haven't been around for a while, but this thread looked interesting, so I went
back to the intro post. First off, I'd want a definition of &quot;greatest poem.&quot;
One major problem for me is the difference between a highly effective poem that
is &quot;only&quot; the best of its kind, and a less effective, even failed, poem that is
the first of a kind with great potential. I think, for instance, of Pound's
CANTOS; although some of them are very effective, the poem as a whole is, I
think, a failure--but it may still be the greatest poem in English because of
all its done for poetry. (No, I don't think it is.)

Jim is right in the huge problem is judging a long poem against a short one, but
your nomination implies you mean short lyrics. (And I think you mean &quot;most
effective&quot; as opposed necessarily to &quot;greatest.&quot;) Even so, it's hard to compare
a mid-length lyric like &quot;Tintern Abbey&quot; with a shorter one like one of
Shakespeare's sonnets, or either with &quot;lighght.&quot;

A third large problem usually ignored is that no one is familiar enough with the
full range of poetry in English to nominate anything. Of course, some of us
assume we're being asked for the greatest poem in English we know of rather than
simply the greatest poem in English, but I fear most people take it for granted
that they know all the candidates.

I think it's a good question (granted my assumptions about size and
effectiveness), anyway--and probably answerable. That is, I do believe there is
one best short lyric in English. On the other hand, I doubt that there is one
that's more than half-a-molecule better than whatever's second. I'd nominate
ten or twenty by Yeats, ten or twenty by Stevens, most of Keats's odes, several
by Cummings and Roethke and Larkin and Hardy, a few by Frost, some by Pound
(particularly if one is allowed to count some of his Cantos a stand-alone
poems), one or two by WC Williams, possibly as many as a hundred by people no
one at HLAS has ever heard of (unless I've mentioned them here), nothing by
Whitman or Shakespeare or TS Eliot or Blake or Dickinson of Browning. Some by
Wordsworth and Shelley and Swinburne. One, each, by twenty or thirty poets like
Marvell. I'm sure I've forgotten a bunch, and been unfair to others.

Note: a poet can succeed at the highest level without every writing a single
super poem--for instance, take the accomplishment of Ted Hughes's &quot;Crow.&quot; I
don't think any individual poem in that collection is in the running for best
poem in English, but the group as a whole is major, in my opinion.

&gt;&gt; For sheer variety, range and sublimity (there's an old-fashioned word) it
&gt;&gt; has to be &lt;Paradise Lost&gt;: there's really no competition (much as I love
&gt;&gt;&lt;The Faerie Queene&gt;.

&gt;&gt; Peter G.

&gt;That was my first thought, but then I realized that FQ is the one I really
&gt;read. Kind of like Ulysses and Huckleberry Finn. Which one would you choose

&gt;TR

"/>

I guess I have to be the one to spoil everything and say I don't think much of
Paradise Lost: the &quot;story&quot; of an invincible deity who invents an eternal hell
for those not willing to be his slaves. True, some fine poetry in it, in
places, and entertaining when we're with Satan and forgetting the deus ex
machina. I'll also admit I can't remember it too well, not having read it for a
long time. It's a lot better than the Divine Comedy, though! Anybody's
translation of the Odyssey is better than it, but I'm no fan of the Iliad or the
Aeneid.

I like both the Faery Queen and the Prelude better than it, and consider the
Cantos a greater poem (though very bad it spots), but I can't think of many good
long poems in English.

Oh, I've decided to officially nominate Aram Saroyan's &quot;lighght&quot; for best poem
in English--not because I really think it is, though I consider it a worthy
contender, but to get something recent into Neil's anthology (it's &quot;only&quot; thirty
years old) and something unconventional (though I guess the Cummings still is,
too).

&gt;&quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot; and &quot;Is My Team Plowing&quot;, by A.E. Housman. I suppose Housman
&gt;has suffered something of a critical eclipse, but his best is very good indeed.
&gt;These are my favorites.

"/>

...
Two that occur to me:

Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough
And stands about the woodland wide
Wearing white for Easter-tide.

(Liturgically correct, I undertand - Housman described himself as a
high-church atheist. The next stanza is less memorable: I have
forgotten it, except as an exercise in versified simple arithmetic,
the answer being that he can expect to live another fifty years. But
the last one rises again, almost to the level of the first.)

And since, to look at things in bloom
Fifty springs is little room,
About the woodland I will go
To see the cherry, hung with snow.

Then there is a longer one that begins very well:

High the vanes of Shrewsbury gleam
Islanded in Severn's stream
And bridges from the steepled crest
Cross the water, east and west.

The flag of morn, in conqueror's state,
Enters at the English gate;
The vanquished eve, as night prevails,
Bleeds upon the road to Wales.

(The rest is not equal to this. Looking at the plan of Shrewsbury in
Lord Burghley's atlas, I realised this poem was most likely based on
that and not on an actual view of the city.)

Having all my books under dust-sheets at the moment, I am limited to
poets who are easy to remember. Which may make it topical to remark
that Shakespeare's Sonnets are definitely hard to memorise. Every word
is vital and few are obvious.

On the stroke of midnight pass
Like vibrations of a bell
And fashionable madmen raise
Their pedantic boring cry:
Every farthing of the cost.
All the dreaded cards foretell.
Shall be paid, but from this night
Not a whisper, not a thought.
Not a kiss nor look be lost.

Beauty, midnight, vision dies:
Let the winds of dawn that blow
Softly round your dreaming head
Such a day of welcome show
Eye and knocking heart may bless,
Find our mortal world enough;
Noons of dryness find you fed
By the involuntary powers,
Nights of insult let you pass
Watched by every human love.

O long-silent Sybil,
you of the winged dreams,
Speak out from your temple of light
as the serious constellations
with Greek names
still stare down on us
as a lighthouse moves its megaphone
over the sea
Speak out and shine upon us
the sea-light of Greece
the diamond light of Greece

Far-seeing Sybil, forever hidden,
Come out of your cave at last
And speak to us in the poet's voice
the voice of the fourth person singular
the voice of the inscrutable future
the voice of the people mixed
with a wild soft laughter--
And give us new dreams to dream,
Give us new myths to live by!

The Woodspurge
by Dante Gabriel Rossetti

My eyes, wide open, had the run
Of some ten weeds to fix upon;
Among those few, out of the sun,
The woodspurge flowered, three cups in one.

From perfect grief there need not be
Wisdom or even memory:
One thing then learnt remains to me, -
The woodspurge has a cup of three.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot; and &quot;Is My Team Plowing&quot;, by A.E. Housman. I suppose
&gt;&gt;&gt;Housman
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has suffered something of a critical eclipse, but his best is very good
&gt;&gt;&gt;indeed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These are my favorites.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Odd that you should pick those. Many people of the post-WW1 generation
&gt;&gt;&gt;experienced the same phenomenon as you describe in relation to Whitman -
&gt;&gt;&gt;adulation followed a few years later by revulsion. Orwell was one,
&gt;quoting
&gt;&gt;&gt;and reading Housman at school, but later saying &quot;It just jingles&quot;.

&gt;&gt; But as I recall, Orwell tempered his rejection of Housman, saying
&gt;something
&gt;&gt; like &quot;Is My Team Plowing&quot; is so fine as never likely to be long out of
&gt;favor. I
&gt;&gt; don't have the text handy, so I could have this wrong.

&gt;&gt; But how could anyone think that &quot;The gale, it plies the saplings double&quot;
&gt;is
&gt;&gt; mere jingling?

&gt;That whole poem is a favourite of mine. As I recall, his judgement of
&gt;Housman is a little more nuanced than this.

"/>

That is my recollection as well. I wish I had the essay handy. I seem to
recall considerable residual affection for Housman's poetry.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Felix Randall&quot; by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Others have mentioned other
&gt;&gt;&gt;poems
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by Hopkins; this is a particular favorite of mine. Orwell wrote a
&gt;lovely
&gt;&gt;&gt;piece
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Amazing I never came across the piece. I think I've read just about all
&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;Orwell's journalism, but missed this one. Do you happen to know what
&gt;&gt;&gt;collection it appears in?

&gt;&gt; It's certainly in the 4-volume &quot;Collected Essays, Journalism, and Letters&quot;
&gt;&gt; somewhere. Again, I don't have it by me. My library is in one place and
&gt;&gt; I'm in another. I think it was in one of the &quot;As I Please&quot; pieces, but I
&gt;&gt; could be wrong.

&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt; H.

&gt;He speaks of it in &lt;Homage to Catalonia&gt; as a poem he used to recite to
&gt;himself on sentry-duty. It's a wonderful poem. I'm reminded of someone (I
&gt;can't remember who) who remarked that Milton was the only poet who could
&gt;stand up to trench-bombardmant in the First World War.

"/>

After I realized that I had misspelled the title of Hopkins's poem (it should
be &quot;Felix Randal&quot;), I was able to find the reference on the web. The Orwell
essay is called &quot;The Meaning of a Poem&quot;, and it is in volume 2 of the CEJL.
I don't know that it's in any other collection. I now seem to recall that it
was actually originally a radio talk, perhaps one of Orwell's broadcasts to
India. Or perhaps not.

&gt;&gt; During my visit to Baltimore in April, there was a discussion among
myself,
&gt;&gt; Lynne Kositsky, Roger Stritmatter, and Terry Ross about the greatest
poem in
&gt;&gt; English. It might make an interesting thread if HLAS posters were to
list
&gt;&gt; their nominations.

&gt;&gt; I'll start it off. My nomination is Walt Whitman's &quot;When Lilacs Last in
the
&gt;&gt; Dooryard Bloom'd&quot;

&gt;&gt; Neil Brennen

&gt; My view is that every great poet writes at least one great poem, and I
&gt; can't say one is better than the other. Some of Shakespeare's sonnets,
&gt; Milton's &quot;Lycidas&quot;, Keats' Odes, Marvell's &quot;To His Coy Mistress&quot;, Eliot's
&gt;&quot;Four Quartets&quot; and many others by them and others are equal to me.

&gt; I can't put Spenser's Faerie Queene or Milton's &quot;Paradise&quot; poems into
&gt; the category of poems because they are dramatic works with a large
&gt; cast of characters

"/>

Adam, Eve, God (and Christ) and half a dozen angels and devils? It's not
exactly &lt;War and Peace&gt;. In any case, even genuine &quot;dramatic works with a
large cast of characters&quot; can be poems --a classic example would be Hardy's
&lt;The Dynasts&gt;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and are essentially novels written in verse. But it's
&gt; easier to judge (and brag about) quantity rather than quality....

And what is this supposed to mean, Tin-Ears? Have you even read Milton and
Spenser?

&gt;One of my reasons for not quoting any Housman is that I think my judgement
&gt;is warped by over-familiarity with the song settings by Vaughan-Williams,

&gt;inseparable now from V-W's ghostly string tremolandos. I might be inclined
&gt;to think the line worth more than its due. But since you've picked it out, I
&gt;have to agree.

"/>

I suppose my judgment is likewise warped. I first read Housman at the age
when Housman is supposed to resonate especially, that is, about 17 or so,
and his poems didn't really make much of an impression. Then ten or twelve
years later, I heard Ralph Vaughan Williams's setting of six of the Shropshire
Lad poems and was utterly transported by it. It is among my favorite pieces
of music. And it led me to go back and read the poems again. Reading them
as a grown-up person, I was greatly moved and deeply impressed by the simple
brilliance of the writing. But I can't separate my response to Housman's
&quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot; from my response to the RVW setting of it either. I hope you've
heard the Ian Partridge recording of the piano quintet version. I've been
carrying it around inside my head for a long time.

I've heard this (from &quot;Before and After Summer&quot;, right?), and in fact I think
I might have a recording of it somewhere. But though I love some of Finzi's
music, this never came to define Hardy's poem to me.

Yes. I've heard the orchestral version many times, but I've always thought
the piano quintet version much more powerful. It's more up-close and
personal. But I think Butterworth's setting of &quot;Is my Team Ploughing?&quot; is
superior to V-W's.

That's the one. Couldn't remember the name of the collection. I recorded it
off the radio in the early 1980s, but accidentally wiped it a couple of
years ago.

For my money the best setting of any poem of that period by a contemporary
composer is John Ireland's setting of Masefield's Sea Fever.

I've just Googled for it:-
'The Meaning of a Poem.' Listener. 12 June 1941. (broadcast on the BBC

Almost certainly a broadcast to India. I think that was his only audience
when he worked for the BBC. They preserved no tapes, unfortunately. So we
have no record of his voice.

The two Housman poems that I can't really separate from RVW's settings

Edge&quot; and &quot;Clun&quot;. I can read &quot;Is My Team Plowing&quot; without hearing

To bring this back to something like Shakespeare, there are many
wonderful settings of Shakespeare lyrics by English composers. Among
my favorites are Peter Warlock's and Gerald Finzi's settings of
&quot;It Was a Lover and His Lass&quot;. Not to mention the early 17th century
setting of the same lyric; I forget the composer.

And then there's Schubert's &quot;An Sylvia&quot;, which I suppose transcends
any composition by any mere Englishman.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Again, I don't know it. The few things of Ireland's that I do know
I love deeply. His setting of Hardy's poem &quot;Her Song&quot; is gorgeous.
And again, can you recommend a good recording?

Let me nominate a great setting of a modern English poem by a
contemporary composer: &quot;King David&quot;, text by Walter de la Mare,
setting by Herbert Howells. I don't suppose anyone takes de la
Mare very seriously as a poet nowadays, but this is the sort of
poem that has things in it that make me wish I had written it.

King David lifted his sad eyes
Into the dark-boughed tree
'Tell me, thou little bird that singest,
Who taught my grief to thee?'

Janet Baker nailed this as she nailed so much of the modern
English art-song repertoire.

&gt; To bring this back to something like Shakespeare, there are many
&gt; wonderful settings of Shakespeare lyrics by English composers. Among
&gt; my favorites are Peter Warlock's and Gerald Finzi's settings of
&gt;&quot;It Was a Lover and His Lass&quot;.

I hope they make up for Sir Arthur Sullivan's setting of the Hecate songs in
Macbeth.

Not to mention the early 17th century

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; setting of the same lyric; I forget the composer.

&gt; And then there's Schubert's &quot;An Sylvia&quot;, which I suppose transcends
&gt; any composition by any mere Englishman.

&gt;&gt;For my money the best setting of any poem of that period by a
contemporary
&gt;&gt;composer is John Ireland's setting of Masefield's Sea Fever.

&gt; Again, I don't know it. The few things of Ireland's that I do know
&gt; I love deeply. His setting of Hardy's poem &quot;Her Song&quot; is gorgeous.
&gt; And again, can you recommend a good recording?

&gt; Let me nominate a great setting of a modern English poem by a
&gt; contemporary composer: &quot;King David&quot;, text by Walter de la Mare,
&gt; setting by Herbert Howells. I don't suppose anyone takes de la
&gt; Mare very seriously as a poet nowadays, but this is the sort of
&gt; poem that has things in it that make me wish I had written it.

&gt; King David lifted his sad eyes
&gt; Into the dark-boughed tree
&gt; 'Tell me, thou little bird that singest,
&gt; Who taught my grief to thee?'

&gt; Janet Baker nailed this as she nailed so much of the modern
&gt; English art-song repertoire.

&gt; Housman

&gt; indeed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These are my favorites.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Odd that you should pick those. Many people of the post-WW1 generation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;experienced the same phenomenon as you describe in relation to Whitman -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;adulation followed a few years later by revulsion. Orwell was one,
&gt; quoting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and reading Housman at school, but later saying &quot;It just jingles&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But as I recall, Orwell tempered his rejection of Housman, saying
&gt; something
&gt;&gt;&gt; like &quot;Is My Team Plowing&quot; is so fine as never likely to be long out of
&gt; favor. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't have the text handy, so I could have this wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But how could anyone think that &quot;The gale, it plies the saplings double&quot;
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; mere jingling?

&gt;&gt;That whole poem is a favourite of mine. As I recall, his judgement of
&gt;&gt;Housman is a little more nuanced than this.

&gt; That is my recollection as well. I wish I had the essay handy. I seem to

You're thinking of several pages in Orwell's long essay &quot;Inside the
Whale&quot; (1940). His discussion of Housman (BTW, he says &quot;It just
tinkles&quot; - better, I think than &quot;It just jingles&quot;) is devoted to the
question of why the poet &quot;appealed so deeply to the people [he means
boys, having in the preceding paragraph doubted that girls found much
in his work] who were young in 1920&quot;, arguing that the reason was a
combination of nostalgia for the countryside, attention to matters
that interest adolescent males and &quot;his blasphemous, antinomian,
'cynical' strain&quot;. He concludes the section with what I regard as one
of his poorer judgements: &quot;But at bottom it is always a writer's
tendency, his 'purpose', his 'message', that makes him liked or
disliked. The proof of this is the extreme difficulty of seeing any
literary merit in a book that seriously damages your deepest beliefs.&quot;

It goes without saying (but maybe I should have said it anyway) that
Orwell's practice didn't follow his profession in this respect, as his
essay on Kipling shows. The profession is, however, very typical of

&gt; especially because lilacs are emblematic for me too. I could explain that at

The English writer Havelock Ellis (best known as a &quot;sexologist,&quot;
probably) said of Whitman that he, with Emerson and Thoreau, (and
excluding &quot;imaginative writers&quot;) was one of the truly great American
writers: &quot;he has been placed while yet alive by the side of the
world's greatest moral teachers, beside Jesus and Socrates ... And
his biographer records briefly his conviction that this man was
'perhaps the most advanced nature the world has yet produced.'&quot; Of
&quot;When Lilacs last in the Dooryard bloomed,&quot; Ellis writes, &quot;never has
the loveliness of death been sung in a more sane and virile song than
[this] solemn death carol ... ,&quot; referring to the lines:
Dark mother, always gliding near with soft feet,
Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?
Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,
I bring thee a song, that when thou must indeed come, come
unfalteringly.
...
Over the tree-tops I float thee a song,
Over the rising and sinking wave, over the myriad fields and the
prairies wide,
Over the dense-packed cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,
I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee, O Death.

According to &lt;&gt;, &quot;The New Spirit&quot; was
published in 1890, but I can't find any texts on the web. The copy I
have was published in the U.S. in 1935 and probably was technically in
conformance with copyright laws at that time.

Max Nordau's &quot;Degeneration&quot; was published in England in 1895, but
Nordau gives only three pages to Whitman, in the course of discussing
Maeterlinck, whom he calls, &quot;a servile imitator of crazy Walt Whitman,
and carries his absurdities still further.&quot; It looks like Whitman
might have been better known in France than in England. I don't
remember whether Shaw's attack on Nordau gave any consideration to
Whitman or not. It seems to me not his style.

Incidentally, Nordau notes that Maeterlinck was trying to be
&quot;Shakespearean,&quot; having associated &quot;Shakespeare&quot; with Germanic
Romanticism, and ridicules this notion, as well as the literary
effect.

&gt;&gt; Edge&quot; and &quot;Clun&quot;. I can read &quot;Is My Team Plowing&quot; without hearing
&gt;&gt; RVW's music. Will Butterworth hijack the poem?

&gt;&gt;&gt;For my money the best setting of any poem of that period by a
&gt; contemporary
&gt;&gt;&gt;composer is John Ireland's setting of Masefield's Sea Fever.

&gt;&gt; Again, I don't know it.

&gt; The best recording of all these was by John Shirley-Quirk on Saga, a
cheapo
&gt; label. It was re-issued a few years ago on CD and might still be
available.
&gt; I couldn't find my copy this a.m. to give you further info.

&gt; However, how can you treat seriously such immortal lines as &quot;The goal
stands
&gt; up, the keeper stands up to keep the goal&quot;?

Another thought, since his poetry is mentioned often in this thread:
Whitman's poetry was used by Vaughan-Williams' in his Sea Symphony.

At the time when Orwell wrote, the idea that the value of literature
depended on its ideological message was a leftist commonplace. That
hasn't been the case always and everywhere, of course.

The Ibsen/Shaw principle, of course. But I rather fancy the theory (a
non-artistic, and to some degree an inartistic one) is not so much
leftist as activist. In an age of comfortable capitalism, the Left
will, perforce, be the one putting everything into The Cause. For a
contemporary counterexample, look at the recent news stories about the
Broadway shows that the Republican Party is and is not buying tickets to
for the upcoming convention in NYC.

In any case, in the above passage, Orwell isn't speaking of the &quot;value
of literature&quot;; he is quite clearly speaking instead of literary
popularity, and of the power of non-literary prejudice to influence what
ought to be a specifically literary judgment.

C. S. Lewis, as I said, would demur; he expressly says that his
enjoyment of Dante was none the greater and his enjoyment of Lucretius
none the less for his conversion from atheism to Christianity. But
Lewis was not Everyman.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You're thinking of several pages in Orwell's long essay &quot;Inside the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Whale&quot; (1940). His discussion of Housman (BTW, he says &quot;It just
&gt;&gt;&gt; tinkles&quot; - better, I think than &quot;It just jingles&quot;) is devoted to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; question of why the poet &quot;appealed so deeply to the people [he means
&gt;&gt;&gt; boys, having in the preceding paragraph doubted that girls found much
&gt;&gt;&gt; in his work] who were young in 1920&quot;, arguing that the reason was a
&gt;&gt;&gt; combination of nostalgia for the countryside, attention to matters
&gt;&gt;&gt; that interest adolescent males and &quot;his blasphemous, antinomian,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'cynical' strain&quot;. He concludes the section with what I regard as one
&gt;&gt;&gt; of his poorer judgements: &quot;But at bottom it is always a writer's
&gt;&gt;&gt; tendency, his 'purpose', his 'message', that makes him liked or
&gt;&gt;&gt; disliked. The proof of this is the extreme difficulty of seeing any
&gt;&gt;&gt; literary merit in a book that seriously damages your deepest beliefs.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Those sentences are reminders of why and how Orwell was a man of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Left rather than the Right.

&gt;&gt; Ooh, that's a bit provocative. I don't know whether it's true that those
on
&gt;&gt; the Left read in a more blinkered way than those on the Right. But I
don't
&gt;&gt; think it applied to Orwell, even though he appears to be implying that
it
&gt;&gt; did. It was an age of ideologies, and Orwell was allergic to them all,
&gt;&gt; whatever claims he might have made for himself as a &quot;socialist&quot;. I think
he
&gt;&gt; was just anti-authoritarian. But he accorded praise where it was
deserved.
&gt;&gt; If anything, he was more indulgent towards the literature of the Right.
He
&gt;&gt; was quite dismissive of the poetry of W.H. Auden early on, bracketing
him
&gt;&gt; with other crypto-communist writers he called the &quot;pansy Left&quot;, but
later
&gt;&gt; revised his opinion. Offhand I can't think of any writers on the other
end
&gt;&gt; of the spectrum that he underrated because he disliked their politics.

&gt; It goes without saying (but maybe I should have said it anyway) that
&gt; Orwell's practice didn't follow his profession in this respect, as his
&gt; essay on Kipling shows. The profession is, however, very typical of
&gt; the Left mindset of the &quot;low, dishonest decade&quot;.

"/>

What he said has some relation to politics, but only because political
beliefs are part of what makes up someone's vision of how the world is or
ought to be. Religion, for example, is at least as powerful a component of
that vision as politics. I also think you're mistaking what Orwell said for
a personal credo, whereas it was in fact merely an observation about a very
human tendency to withold praise from otherwise well-written books, if those
books promote beliefs we do not ourselves share. It's an observation that
holds good in any period of history, and involves beliefs that might not
necessarily be political. Witness the tendency of Stratfordians to dismiss
Oxfordian books as &quot;poorly written&quot;, and vice versa.

There were certainly some on the Left in the 'thirties who took the view
that only Leftist books could be accorded literary merit, but Orwell was not
one of them. He was merely doing what it was his habit to do, which was to
bring to our attention some disreputable aspect of human behaviour, and
promptly include himself amongst the guilty ones.

&gt;&gt;That whole poem is a favourite of mine. As I recall, his judgement of
&gt;&gt;Housman is a little more nuanced than this.

&gt; That is my recollection as well. I wish I had the essay handy. I seem to
&gt; recall considerable residual affection for Housman's poetry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Felix Randall&quot; by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Others have mentioned other
&gt; poems
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by Hopkins; this is a particular favorite of mine. Orwell wrote a
&gt; lovely
&gt; piece
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Amazing I never came across the piece. I think I've read just about all
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Orwell's journalism, but missed this one. Do you happen to know what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;collection it appears in?

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's certainly in the 4-volume &quot;Collected Essays, Journalism, and Letters&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; somewhere. Again, I don't have it by me. My library is in one place and
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm in another. I think it was in one of the &quot;As I Please&quot; pieces, but I
&gt;&gt;&gt; could be wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt;&gt; H.

&gt;&gt;He speaks of it in &lt;Homage to Catalonia&gt; as a poem he used to recite to
&gt;&gt;himself on sentry-duty. It's a wonderful poem. I'm reminded of someone (I
&gt;&gt;can't remember who) who remarked that Milton was the only poet who could
&gt;&gt;stand up to trench-bombardmant in the First World War.

&gt; After I realized that I had misspelled the title of Hopkins's poem (it should
&gt; be &quot;Felix Randal&quot;), I was able to find the reference on the web. The Orwell
&gt; essay is called &quot;The Meaning of a Poem&quot;, and it is in volume 2 of the CEJL.
&gt; I don't know that it's in any other collection. I now seem to recall that it
&gt; was actually originally a radio talk, perhaps one of Orwell's broadcasts to
&gt; India. Or perhaps not.

&gt; H.

There is a group at MSN which seems to have the essay,

I'm ashamed to say I've never heard this. But after what you've said, I
think I'll give it a try.

It's also everyone's tendency, including mine, to forget about Elgar when
talking about the masters of English song. I think his enormous reputation
as a symphonic composer has overshadowed everything else. But Elgar's songs
are some of the best. I doubt that it's still available, but a collection of
his, just called &quot;Elgar Songs&quot;, recorded by Brian Rayner Cook/Roger
Vignoles, has been much loved and much played by me for many years.

An interesting page...

It Was a Lover and his Lass

A late 16th Century English Lute Ayre by Thomas Morley

This song is sung in Shakespeare's &quot;As you like it&quot; which was first
performed in 1599 or 1600. &quot;As you like it&quot; is set in a &quot;once upon a
time&quot; era, and so modern Elizabethan clothing would not be appropriate
for a singer in this play.

Primary Sources There is no extant written manuscript, however, an
original printed book from 1600 is held by the British Museum.

Secondary Sources A facsimile of the original held by the British
Museum was released in 1970 by The Scholar Press Limited, edited by F.
W. Sternfeld.

Primary sources of material related to the performance practice of the
work

The performance practice of the lute is fairly easy to establish,
there are many instruments extant from the late renaissance and there
is a significant body of writing on and for the lute.

Dowland says in the introduction to his book of lute ayres, &quot;…I
purpose shortly my selfe to set forth the choicest of all my Lessons
in print, and also an introduction for fingering, with other books of
Songs, whereof this is the first…&quot; T

he human voice is an elusive creature, and before the treatises of the
classical period, most decisions about the proper performance practice
of songs must be speculative and instinctive.

While there is no definitive work which describes the performance
practice of English Lute Ayres, contemporary writers in France,
Germany, and Italy did write about vocal qualities.

&quot;Because of the agreement - or lack of disagreement - in the various
instructions and their fairly wide geographical distribution, they can
probably be taken as a general European view of singing in the late
Renaissance.&quot;(McGee[1], 55)

McGee further gives a summary of the writings of three authors,
Hermann Finck (1556, Wittenberg), Giovanni Maffei (1562, Naples), and
Conrad von Zabern(1474, Heidelberg).

These points, which are highly indicative of a vocal style which is
obviously practical for performing renaissance vocal music are:

&quot;1. Sing with the mouth open only as wide as in casual conversation.
Do not open it wide or close the teeth.

2. Place the singing tone in the front of the mouth. Avoid singing
from the back of the throat or through the nose.

3. Use a moderate tone. Do not force the voice.

4. Sing with a steady tone that does not change in pitch, volume, or
intensity.

5. Rapid notes should receive clear articulation. Passages with text
should receive clean articulation with the tongue, and untexted
passages should be articulated clearly in the throat However, Finck
warned against sounding like a goat.

6. Avoid excessive body motion while singing.&quot; However, this seems to
be a major point of contention between critics

Additional points given by these writers are to lighten the voice as
it rises, pronouncing vowels clearly, avoiding aspirated vowels, and
singing without vibrato (Conrad, to choral singers)

Historical materials related to the Historical and Cultural context of
the first performances of the work The venue of this work is the
private home. It is very much a genre meant for a small intimate group
to sing for each other.

This style is hinted at in Moreley's A plaine and easie guide to
Musick but it's hardly discussed.

In Small Proportions: A Poetics of the English Ayre, 1596–1622. By
Daniel Fischlin. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998. Fischlin
is a lutenist.

P. 250 Robert Spencer said, &quot;Elizabethan comment on singing itself is
sparse, but even that tells us something. That writers equated
learning to sing only with learning to sight-read, indicates how
little attention was paid to voice production.&quot;

P. 250 little evidence exists regarding lute accompaniment

P. 250 suggests Tune thy Musicke to thy Hart, which is in OU

P. 250 suggests Performance:: Revealing the Orpheus within

P. 251-2 Tofts suggests, &quot;First, consider the passions of the poem.
Note the dominant affection and determine how the main parts of the
text relate to this central passion. Then study individual sentences
to discover the specific affections embodied in them.

At the same time, observe the figurative language with which sentences
have been decorated and decide which words require emphasis. Do not
overlook the punctuation, for it is the vehicle through which the
structure of the discourse is articulated, and the observance of it
enables listeners to comprehend the thoughts and emotions of the texts
easily. At this point the study of the structure of the text should be
complete.&quot;

P. 252: Fischlin quotes Thomas Campion's sarcastic description of the
old style of theatrical declamation, which Fischlin suggests indicates
a contrary performance practice for the ayre. &quot;But there are some, who
to appeare the more deepe and singular in their judgement, will admit
no Musicke but that which is long, intricate, bated with fuge, chaind
with syncopation, and where the nature of everie word is precisely
exprest in the Note, like the old exploided action in Comedies, when
if they did pronounce Memini, they would point to the hinder part of
their heads, if Video, put their finger in their eye. But such
childish observing of words is altogether ridiculous, and we ought to
maintaine as well in Notes, as in action, a manly carriage, gracing no
word, but that which is eminent, and emphaiticall. By far the most
difficult issue of performance practice is vocal style, followed by
the style of accompaniment. The notation and text are easily read.

It is generally accepted that the appropriate voice for late 16th
century English song is free from vibrato and excess air (a very
&quot;silver&quot; sound as compared to &quot;white&quot;) with a very focused tone.

&gt;&gt; label. It was re-issued a few years ago on CD and might still be
&gt; available.
&gt;&gt; I couldn't find my copy this a.m. to give you further info.

&gt;&gt; However, how can you treat seriously such immortal lines as &quot;The goal
&gt; stands
&gt;&gt; up, the keeper stands up to keep the goal&quot;?

&gt; Another thought, since his poetry is mentioned often in this thread:
&gt; Whitman's poetry was used by Vaughan-Williams' in his Sea Symphony.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're thinking of several pages in Orwell's long essay &quot;Inside the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whale&quot; (1940). His discussion of Housman (BTW, he says &quot;It just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tinkles&quot; - better, I think than &quot;It just jingles&quot;) is devoted to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; question of why the poet &quot;appealed so deeply to the people [he means
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; boys, having in the preceding paragraph doubted that girls found
much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in his work] who were young in 1920&quot;, arguing that the reason was a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; combination of nostalgia for the countryside, attention to matters
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that interest adolescent males and &quot;his blasphemous, antinomian,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'cynical' strain&quot;. He concludes the section with what I regard as
one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of his poorer judgements: &quot;But at bottom it is always a writer's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tendency, his 'purpose', his 'message', that makes him liked or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disliked. The proof of this is the extreme difficulty of seeing any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; literary merit in a book that seriously damages your deepest
beliefs.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those sentences are reminders of why and how Orwell was a man of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Left rather than the Right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ooh, that's a bit provocative. I don't know whether it's true that
those
&gt; on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Left read in a more blinkered way than those on the Right. But I
&gt; don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; think it applied to Orwell, even though he appears to be implying that
&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt; did. It was an age of ideologies, and Orwell was allergic to them
all,
&gt;&gt;&gt; whatever claims he might have made for himself as a &quot;socialist&quot;. I
think
&gt; he
&gt;&gt;&gt; was just anti-authoritarian. But he accorded praise where it was
&gt; deserved.
&gt;&gt;&gt; If anything, he was more indulgent towards the literature of the
Right.
&gt; He
&gt;&gt;&gt; was quite dismissive of the poetry of W.H. Auden early on, bracketing
&gt; him
&gt;&gt;&gt; with other crypto-communist writers he called the &quot;pansy Left&quot;, but
&gt; later
&gt;&gt;&gt; revised his opinion. Offhand I can't think of any writers on the other
&gt; end
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the spectrum that he underrated because he disliked their politics.

&gt;&gt; It goes without saying (but maybe I should have said it anyway) that
&gt;&gt; Orwell's practice didn't follow his profession in this respect, as his
&gt;&gt; essay on Kipling shows. The profession is, however, very typical of
&gt;&gt; the Left mindset of the &quot;low, dishonest decade&quot;.

Yes, I agree. But I put my judgement down to what Orwell was talking about.
I found her case so poor (in places you could only laugh out loud) that I
thought I must have allowed that judgement to spill over into one about the
quality of the writing. But since you've said it, I'll say it too. It wasn't
well written. But I don't agree with your last sentence. Joseph Sobran's
book was equally silly, but it was better written. I thought Ogburn's was
too. In places Ogburn was quite good, especially where Oxford could be kept
out of the picture, such as his narrative of the defeat of the Armada. At
any rate, he was never less than competent. Price's book was variable, but
parts of it were almost childishly clumsy.

Star of England is by the Ogburns senior; it is not the more famous text by

intricate and somewhat overwrought language.

I was waiting for that, Tom: The Mouse writes fantasy, but the whole whole
topic is fantasy anyway. Ha Ha. I've certainly contributed (lightly) to some
articles in our newsletter and papers given at conferences, have given my
own paper at a mainstream conference (on &quot;Shakespeare and the Jews&quot;), helped
write a response to you and Dave that will (sigh) one day go up on our site,
though much of the language in that is Roger's (he's better at arm wrestling
than I), and am writing a novel for adults on Emilia Bassano which will
mention Oxford--in fact it does on the first page. &quot;Oxfordian writers,&quot; I
maintain, can include fiction as well as non-fiction writers. Sometimes
novelists have a greater impact on the subject than their non-fiction
counterpoints. This is true for Stratfordian/Traditionalist novelists also.
Our books, whether for children or adults, are certainly better distributed
than most scholarly tomes, have a larger readership, and are far more
accessible.

Besides, didn't you see the ;)? I was joking.

Pardon me, but Kositsky also ridicules the protagonist (or at least, the
protagonist ridicules herself--look at the passage on Willow and Burbage as
Juliet and Romeo, performing in front of the Queen). The love interest, John
Pike, is not ridiculed, but is made ridiculously romantic, in Willow's eyes
at least. Oxford isn't ridiculed (not much, anyhow), but he certainly comes
out as a rather cold, nasty, condescending character. The novel is supposed
to be a farce.

If you're referring to _Yevgenii Onegin_, there are popular verse
translations by Babette Deutsch, Walter Arndt, Charles Johnston, and
James Falen, and even Douglas Hofstadter, among others. Nabokov
ridiculed the existing verse translations into English, and Nabokov's
own famously idiosyncratic translation and brilliant commentary has much
to offer; however, the fidelity to nuance upon which Nabokov insisted
precluded a translation retaining the verse and meter of the original,
and despite its many felicities and the care Nabokov lavished upon it,
Nabokov's translation does not really permit a reader with no Russian to
glimpse Pushkin's sprightly and sparkling virtuosity.

I would enthusiastically recommend Jim Falen's superb translation,
which in my opinion is by far the best of the English verse translations
available. Nabokov's commentary is fascinating, and reading it
concurrently is very rewarding; however, this is a work notorious for
frustrating translators and hence is best read in Russian.

John W. Kennedy wrote:
&gt; Tom Veal wrote:
&gt;&gt; At the time when Orwell wrote, the idea that the value of
literature
&gt;&gt; depended on its ideological message was a leftist commonplace. That
&gt;&gt; hasn't been the case always and everywhere, of course.

&gt; The Ibsen/Shaw principle, of course. But I rather fancy the theory (a
&gt; non-artistic, and to some degree an inartistic one) is not so much
&gt; leftist as activist. In an age of comfortable capitalism, the Left
&gt; will, perforce, be the one putting everything into The Cause. For a
&gt; contemporary counterexample, look at the recent news stories about the
&gt; Broadway shows that the Republican Party is and is not buying tickets to
&gt; for the upcoming convention in NYC.

&gt; In any case, in the above passage, Orwell isn't speaking of the &quot;value
&gt; of literature&quot;; he is quite clearly speaking instead of literary
&gt; popularity, and of the power of non-literary prejudice to influence what
&gt; ought to be a specifically literary judgment.

&gt; C. S. Lewis, as I said, would demur; he expressly says that his
&gt; enjoyment of Dante was none the greater and his enjoyment of Lucretius
&gt; none the less for his conversion from atheism to Christianity. But
&gt; Lewis was not Everyman.

"/>

To be fair, the leftist theory forms part of an effort to ensure that
leftist views are represented in literature. Generally, art comes
from the more comfortable classes. For example, Terry Eagleton, a
noted Marxist, has written in favor of working-class people's being
helped to learn to write literature, so that we will know the way the
other half lives and thinks.

I thought that Orwell's position on this topic was largely connected
with the fact that his own writing had an avowedly political purpose.

What I remember of Orwell's opinions on writers popular among the
English masses, is that although the writers often had Fascist
sympathies and displayed these sympathies clearly in their writing,
and although these same writers were very popular, this did not mean
that the English people were inherently Fascist -- only that there
were other qualities in the writing that appealed to them, as readers.
Orwell insisted that the way the English enjoyed these writers proved
that they could not be Fascists.

You make it sound very black-and-white. Certainly Orwell was willing

believe they wrote badly because they were rightly ashamed to say
clearly what they thought. I also think that with regard to writing
(and perhaps other areas, as well), he would not have said that he was
one of those guilty of the writing sins he catalogued for the
instruction of his readers.

Orwell often wrote for leftists who would not have been interested in
right-wing books. Naturally, he would write about what his readers
might think about reading, and criticize the ways he expected they
might go wrong, rather than bothering with what they would end up
ignoring anyway.

Orwell was uninterested in writing for leftists. The fact that he appealed
very directly to a much wider readership, encompassing all parts of the
political spectrum, is attested by the popularity of his books, both at the
time and today. To write only what he thought would please an
idelologically-motivated readership would be in his view, literary
prostitution.
If he'd wanted to please leftists, he would never have written &quot;Homage to

It is. And it is a good novel. You are a great writer, Lynne. But you play
favorites among your dramatis personae in A Question of Will, and the
author's dislike for some historical personages stick out. And that appears
to include most of the Elizabethans. But I will say your Shakespeare, while
a nasty piece of work, is at least a human being, which is more than most
Oxfordian writing imagines him to be.

&gt; Whether that is true or not, Orwell's observation was meant to include all
&gt; kinds of beliefs, many of which he was not interested in himself. Religion
&gt; was one of those.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I also think you're mistaking what Orwell said for
&gt;&gt;&gt; a personal credo, whereas it was in fact merely an observation about a
&gt; very
&gt;&gt;&gt; human tendency to withold praise from otherwise well-written books, if
&gt; those
&gt;&gt;&gt; books promote beliefs we do not ourselves share. It's an observation
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; holds good in any period of history, and involves beliefs that might
not
&gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily be political.

&gt;&gt; True, but I think in Orwell's case they were in fact political.

&gt; They might have been, but his observation was meant to cover all kinds of
&gt; beliefs. He didn't have to hold those beliefs himself in order to observe
&gt; their force.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Witness the tendency of Stratfordians to dismiss
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxfordian books as &quot;poorly written&quot;, and vice versa.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There were certainly some on the Left in the 'thirties who took the
view
&gt;&gt;&gt; that only Leftist books could be accorded literary merit, but Orwell
was
&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt; one of them. He was merely doing what it was his habit to do, which
was
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; bring to our attention some disreputable aspect of human behaviour,
and
&gt;&gt;&gt; promptly include himself amongst the guilty ones.

&gt;&gt; You make it sound very black-and-white. Certainly Orwell was willing
&gt;&gt; to criticize socialist writers if they wrote badly, and I think he did
&gt;&gt; believe they wrote badly because they were rightly ashamed to say
&gt;&gt; clearly what they thought.

&gt; I don't quite see what that has to do with his observation, which was
about
&gt; readers, not writers.

&gt;&gt; Orwell often wrote for leftists who would not have been interested in
&gt;&gt; right-wing books. Naturally, he would write about what his readers
&gt;&gt; might think about reading, and criticize the ways he expected they
&gt;&gt; might go wrong, rather than bothering with what they would end up
&gt;&gt; ignoring anyway.

&gt; Orwell was uninterested in writing for leftists. The fact that he appealed
&gt; very directly to a much wider readership, encompassing all parts of the
&gt; political spectrum, is attested by the popularity of his books, both at
the
&gt; time and today. To write only what he thought would please an
&gt; idelologically-motivated readership would be in his view, literary
&gt; prostitution.
&gt; If he'd wanted to please leftists, he would never have written &quot;Homage to
&gt; Catalonia&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A Question of Will manages to be amusing as fiction, despite the low

&gt;&gt;&gt; the author has for most of her characters. She ridicules eVERyone in
the

&gt;&gt; example,
&gt;&gt;&gt; it's hard to imagine Oxford willing writing for the buffoons that fill

&gt;&gt; Pardon me, but Kositsky also ridicules the protagonist (or at least, the

&gt;&gt; Juliet and Romeo, performing in front of the Queen).

&gt; Don't you find there's a difference between Perrin ridiculing herself and

It's a COMEDY, Neil, bordering on FARCE, because I thought that a better
take for kids, and because Shakespeare wrote so many comedies. One must
suspend disbelief. The book I'm writing now is not a comedy, although so
comedic in places that my husband gasped with laughter when I read him the
first bit. Tudor characters, however, come out very well. You can see the
first couple of chapters soon if you don't faint at the naughty words or
imagine I'm the modern protag, who has to parallel Emilia Bassano, a
courtesan. That being said, there are details in my protag's life which
parallel mine. The lost child theme, for example.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The love interest, John
&gt;&gt; Pike, is not ridiculed, but is made ridiculously romantic, in Willow's
&gt; eyes
&gt;&gt; at least.

&gt; I seem to recall Willow is in love with John Pike. I can't imagine the
&gt; feelings of young women in love aren't less silly than that of young men
in
&gt; love. Having been a young man in love once, I would know. :-)

&gt; Oxford isn't ridiculed (not much, anyhow), but he certainly comes
&gt;&gt; out as a rather cold, nasty, condescending character.

&gt; No, that's your Shakespeare, Lynne. You portray him as nasty and weak. You
&gt; invest Oxford with more nobility than you give to Queen Elizabeth!

"/>

No, Oxford is cold and condescending. Willow is terrified of him. I found it
a better way to write him because that way he didn't have to talk much.
After all, in my book he's more or less accepted to be the bard, and which
of us is clever enough to put immortal words into the mouth of the greatest
writer of all time? IMO, that's where most novels about Oxford or
Shakespeare fail dismally. Elizabeth, like Bridget de Vere, is bawdy and
dotty. Shakespeare is often drunk because he spends too much time with Ben,
drinking at the tavern, no doubt, of universal knowledge.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The novel is supposed

&gt; It is. And it is a good novel. You are a great writer, Lynne. But you play

&gt; author's dislike for some historical personages stick out.

No, this is Willow, not I. I actually adore the idea of Burbage. No ye not,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually I had a Crowley acolyte in one of my first-year classes a few
&gt; weeks
&gt;&gt;&gt; ago. We were looking at the passage in &lt;Antony and Cleopatra&gt; where
&gt;&gt;&gt; Enobarbus describes their first meeting:

&gt;&gt;&gt; The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne
&gt;&gt;&gt; Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold ...

&gt;&gt;&gt; She (the student) offered a novel (indeed, ground-breaking) Crowleyite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;exegesis&quot; of the second half of the second line. I have to admit I
&gt; laughed
&gt;&gt;&gt; out loud, which is a definite no-no, but I was taken completely by
&gt; surprise.
&gt;&gt; That student has a better feeling for Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; than you do. Get her to take the class in future.

&gt;&gt; There is nothing particularly novel in such an
&gt;&gt; interpretation of that passage. Read the whole
&gt;&gt; of it sometime, with a bit less innocence. And
&gt;&gt; see Rubenstein, (1984):
&gt; Paul, nobody (I trust) doubts that the passage is highly erotic, and deals
&gt; with the sexual charisma of power (there's a kind of masochism in the
&gt; reference to &quot;The water which they beat ... amorous of their strokes&quot;) but
&gt; I need to tell you that most people don't find shit particularly sexy; I
&gt; realise that you and your fantasy Oxford may be exceptions to this rule.

Oddly enough, there may be at least one other conspicuous
anti-Stratfordian exception to the rule as well:

&lt;&gt;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your efforts to impose a scatological reading are not, however, supported by
&gt; the OED, which records the first such use of &quot;poop&quot; from almost 150 years

&gt; breast, Sitting on a pole, Niddle, Noddle, Went his head, And Poop went his
&gt; Hole&quot;
&gt; It's true that colloquial usage always predates the literary record, but 150
&gt; years is a long time, and --- given the (general) irrelevance (for most
&gt; people) of turds and farts to sexual desire --- I think we can rule out a
&gt; pun in the A&amp;C passage.

I suspect that Mr. Crowley will have no reasonable rejoinder to your
consultation of the OED.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It goes without saying (but maybe I should have said it anyway)
&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Orwell's practice didn't follow his profession in this respect, as
&gt;&gt;&gt; his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; essay on Kipling shows. The profession is, however, very typical of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Left mindset of the &quot;low, dishonest decade&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What he said has some relation to politics, but only because
political
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beliefs are part of what makes up someone's vision of how the world
is
&gt;&gt; or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ought to be. Religion, for example, is at least as powerful a
&gt; component
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that vision as politics.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that always true?

&gt;&gt; No. Maybe I should have said &quot;can be as powerful&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Anyway, Orwell didn't have a religion. Do you
&gt;&gt;&gt; count non-religion as a variety of religion, or do the non-religious
&gt;&gt;&gt; have an analogous set of non-religious differentiations? I don't know
&gt;&gt;&gt; that Orwell even had a metaphysics. So far as I am aware, it really
&gt;&gt;&gt; is all politics for him.

&gt;&gt; Whether that is true or not, Orwell's observation was meant to include
all
&gt;&gt; kinds of beliefs, many of which he was not interested in himself.
Religion
&gt;&gt; was one of those.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I also think you're mistaking what Orwell said for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a personal credo, whereas it was in fact merely an observation about
a
&gt;&gt; very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; human tendency to withold praise from otherwise well-written books,
if
&gt;&gt; those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books promote beliefs we do not ourselves share. It's an observation
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; holds good in any period of history, and involves beliefs that might
&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily be political.

&gt;&gt;&gt; True, but I think in Orwell's case they were in fact political.

&gt;&gt; They might have been, but his observation was meant to cover all kinds
of
&gt;&gt; beliefs. He didn't have to hold those beliefs himself in order to
observe
&gt;&gt; their force.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Witness the tendency of Stratfordians to dismiss
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxfordian books as &quot;poorly written&quot;, and vice versa.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There were certainly some on the Left in the 'thirties who took the
&gt; view
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that only Leftist books could be accorded literary merit, but Orwell
&gt; was
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one of them. He was merely doing what it was his habit to do, which
&gt; was
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bring to our attention some disreputable aspect of human behaviour,
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; promptly include himself amongst the guilty ones.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You make it sound very black-and-white. Certainly Orwell was willing
&gt;&gt;&gt; to criticize socialist writers if they wrote badly, and I think he did
&gt;&gt;&gt; believe they wrote badly because they were rightly ashamed to say
&gt;&gt;&gt; clearly what they thought.

&gt;&gt; I don't quite see what that has to do with his observation, which was
&gt; about
&gt;&gt; readers, not writers.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Orwell often wrote for leftists who would not have been interested in
&gt;&gt;&gt; right-wing books. Naturally, he would write about what his readers
&gt;&gt;&gt; might think about reading, and criticize the ways he expected they
&gt;&gt;&gt; might go wrong, rather than bothering with what they would end up
&gt;&gt;&gt; ignoring anyway.

&gt;&gt; Orwell was uninterested in writing for leftists. The fact that he
appealed
&gt;&gt; very directly to a much wider readership, encompassing all parts of the
&gt;&gt; political spectrum, is attested by the popularity of his books, both at
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; time and today. To write only what he thought would please an
&gt;&gt; idelologically-motivated readership would be in his view, literary
&gt;&gt; prostitution.
&gt;&gt; If he'd wanted to please leftists, he would never have written &quot;Homage
to
&gt;&gt; Catalonia&quot;.

&gt; Or Animal Farm.

Thank you, yes. And &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. But I thought it would aid
concision if I cited just the first such work - I mean the first book he
published after he became &quot;politically aware&quot;, which would make pissing off
the Left a conscious act. Before that, with &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;, he was
a political naif, and didn't know how either the Left or Right would react
to the book. He had been commissioned to write it largely on the strength
of &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot;, an unpolitical book, but one that
identified him as a shrewd social commentator. It was the experience of
Spain that gave him political nous, and &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; was written in
the full knowledge that it would make him persona non grata with Communists.
That's why I singled it out.

Fair enough.

know
&gt;&gt; that Orwell even had a metaphysics. So far as I am aware, it
really
&gt;&gt; is all politics for him.

&gt; Whether that is true or not, Orwell's observation was meant to include all

Well, I don't think it was &quot;all politics&quot; for Orwell in the
postmodern-type sense where morality is also &quot;just politics&quot; -- where
there isn't any true morality but powerful groups just impose rules on
the less powerful. I think Orwell believed there was a true morality.
He also believed, I think, that ideologies, including organized
religion, existed for the purpose of disguising power-relations as
true moralities. So of course he would be anti-ideological.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I didn't mean that Orwell held others' beliefs to be all political; I
meant that Orwell's own beliefs were all political. I don't think he
ever saw a reason to have any non-political beliefs. By this, I mean
that he didn't see a need for non-political (metaphysical or
religious) grounding of his political beliefs, or of anyone's
political beliefs. He seems to have had a fairly simple and
straightforward view of morality and of what kind of government is
most moral.

You had said that Orwell's habitual method was to describe some error
that many people, including himself, commit -- to make himself an
example of bad thinking or bad writing or simply of badness. I think
that Orwell's &quot;habitual method,&quot; if he had one, was more like taking
something he knew, and finding where others acted as if they didn't
know it (or where they acted as if they did), in order to show his
readers the difference, and to persuade them that they ought to know
it, as well. The distinction, in my opinion, has largely to do with
whether he thought the problem could be fixed or not. It sounded like
you were saying Orwell accepted those &quot;disreputable aspects&quot; could not
be changed, and then identified himself as a representative of the
disreputable.

I disagree. Orwell was writing for people who were engaged in the
same project he was engaged in, or who potentially might become
engaged in that project -- which was to transform Europe in a leftward
direction, without falling into the traps illustrated by the Soviet
Union, as Orwell saw it. His motivation wasn't to please, but to
instruct. He wasn't naive enough to believe that people who disagreed
with him on a really fundamental level would spend much time reading
what he wrote.

If you compare &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Animal Farm&quot; to Orwell's first novel, you
can see that he did not want to &quot;please.&quot; Those later novels make one
think that Orwell was a journalist but no literary man, but &quot;Burmese
Days&quot; is entirely the sappy romantic first novel by a sensitive young
man compelled to work in a bureaucracy.

As you said, his motivation was not to please - which is what I said. The
Left end of the spectrum is itself a spectrum. There were plenty of people
on the Left with whom he could make common cause. But there were plenty with
whom he couldn't. The point is that he did not trim his writing in such a
way as to tell people what they thought they wanted to hear. When, during
the war, even quite conservative people were unwilling to criticise Stalin
or the Communist Party, Orwell did so freely. This made him unpopular with
many on the Left.

I've said all that in the hope that it answers your point. Because to tell
you the truth, I'm not sure what your point is, or what it is in my post
that you disagree with.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But I think Butterworth's setting of &quot;Is my Team Ploughing?&quot; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;superior to V-W's.

&gt;&gt; I'm not familiar with it. Can you point me toward a good recording?

&gt;The only recording I have is a radio recording of a song recital. But there
&gt;is a promising looking collection, sung by Antony Rolfe Johnson, including
&gt;settings of A Shropshire Lad by both Butterworth and C.W. Orr. There are
&gt;also several songs by John Ireland, including The Land of Lost Content,
&gt;which is wonderful. Take a look, and see what there is:-
&gt;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005S85Q/202-6653999-2652648

"/>

This looks interesting. I suppose I'll have to buy a copy. I see that there
is a credit for Alan Bates as &quot;speaker&quot;, which doesn't sound very promising.
I'd rather not have a speaker, even if Alan Bates was awfully good as an
actor in certain things.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; To bring this back to something like Shakespeare, there are many
&gt;&gt; wonderful settings of Shakespeare lyrics by English composers. Among
&gt;&gt; my favorites are Peter Warlock's and Gerald Finzi's settings of
&gt;&gt;&quot;It Was a Lover and His Lass&quot;. Not to mention the early 17th century
&gt;&gt; setting of the same lyric; I forget the composer.

&gt;Thomas Morley, I think.

"/>

You're quite right. I like to sing that one in the springtime.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;For my money the best setting of any poem of that period by a
&gt;contemporary
&gt;&gt;&gt;composer is John Ireland's setting of Masefield's Sea Fever.

&gt;&gt; Again, I don't know it. The few things of Ireland's that I do know
&gt;&gt; I love deeply. His setting of Hardy's poem &quot;Her Song&quot; is gorgeous.
&gt;&gt; And again, can you recommend a good recording?

&gt;Well, the problem is that recordings go in and out of the catalogue too
&gt;rapidly, but I searched for this one, and came across a collection that I'm
&gt;really tempted to get myself. Sea Fever is on it, and the lovely Songs of a
&gt;Wayfarer cycle.
&gt;http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/details/67261.asp

"/>

Having had a look at this, I'm going to have to buy it. This is going to
break me. Sixty-nine songs, and John Mark Ainsley...I see he's got an
&quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot; out, also on Hyperion. This is getting expensive.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Let me nominate a great setting of a modern English poem by a
&gt;&gt; contemporary composer: &quot;King David&quot;, text by Walter de la Mare,
&gt;&gt; setting by Herbert Howells. I don't suppose anyone takes de la
&gt;&gt; Mare very seriously as a poet nowadays, but this is the sort of
&gt;&gt; poem that has things in it that make me wish I had written it.

&gt;&gt; King David lifted his sad eyes
&gt;&gt; Into the dark-boughed tree
&gt;&gt; 'Tell me, thou little bird that singest,
&gt;&gt; Who taught my grief to thee?'

&gt;&gt; Janet Baker nailed this as she nailed so much of the modern
&gt;&gt; English art-song repertoire.

&gt;I'm ashamed to say I've never heard this. But after what you've said, I
&gt;think I'll give it a try.

"/>

I'm so glad we've had this exchange. I don't often meet people with
an enthusiasm for English art-song. There's a wonderful recording
that Janet Baker did with Martin Isepp on the piano called &quot;An Anthology
of English Song&quot;, which includes &quot;King David&quot;, but I think it's out of
print currently. It was quite early in Baker's career, the early 60's I
think. She's listed as a contralto, a designation she carried only briefly,
I believe.

I can't find any evidence that this recording is currently available,
although it certainly has been issued on CD (I have it on CD and LP).
The CD I have is Saga EC 3340-2, if that helps any.
I found a perceptive review of it here:

The sound quality of the recording is not very good, I'm afraid.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;It's also everyone's tendency, including mine, to forget about Elgar when
&gt;talking about the masters of English song. I think his enormous reputation
&gt;as a symphonic composer has overshadowed everything else. But Elgar's songs
&gt;are some of the best. I doubt that it's still available, but a collection of
&gt;his, just called &quot;Elgar Songs&quot;, recorded by Brian Rayner Cook/Roger
&gt;Vignoles, has been much loved and much played by me for many years.

I'll look out for it.

&gt; Left end of the spectrum is itself a spectrum. There were plenty of people
&gt; on the Left with whom he could make common cause. But there were plenty with
&gt; whom he couldn't. The point is that he did not trim his writing in such a
&gt; way as to tell people what they thought they wanted to hear. When, during
&gt; the war, even quite conservative people were unwilling to criticise Stalin
&gt; or the Communist Party, Orwell did so freely. This made him unpopular with
&gt; many on the Left.

Right. He said what he believed was the truth. He knew that not
everybody agreed with him about what he believed to be true, or about
what he believed to be the correct political action to take. He
accepted that one had to take sides, and say what one believed (as
well as fighting for what one believed in), even if it marked one as
being on one side, rather than another. He disagreed with those who
&quot;took their marching orders from the Kremlin.&quot; This did make him
unpopular with some -- with those who are now, rightly, I believe, on
the &quot;losing&quot; side -- with those who stuck with Communism, defined as
what the Kremlin says it is, long after most Western Communists and
socialists had given up on it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I've said all that in the hope that it answers your point. Because to tell
&gt; you the truth, I'm not sure what your point is, or what it is in my post
&gt; that you disagree with.

"/>

Okay, let me step back for a minute. Tom Veal had said of Orwell that
his practice did not match his profession, and that this was typical
of this decade, for the Left in particular. The example Mr. Veal drew
this generalization from was a statement by Orwell about understanding
and liking writers with whom we have some kind of fundamental
disagreement.

Then, you implied that you believe there's a strong enough argument to
the effect that &quot;those on the Left read in a more blinkered way than
those on the Right,&quot; appearing to imply that the point in question was
this: Did Orwell read his contemporaries in an irrational way, being
by nature unable to abide authority, and thus (probably unconsciously)
mixing an automatic negative (and probably unconscious) reaction to
authoritative statements, with what ought to have been disinterested
and rational criticism?

It is possible, I suppose, that our disagreement has to do with words
somewhat more basic than what it seems is being discussed.

&gt; You'll have to amplify the question. I don't know if it's literal or
&gt; rhetorical.

Maybe you could fine-tune a bit, instead? If I amplify too much, I'll
bleed into the next thread over.

No that wasn't what was typical of the decade, according to Tom Veal. He was
talking of the belief on the Left that books could only be accorded literary
merit if they espoused Leftist ideas. That belief was what he thought was
typical of the decade. He took Orwell's remark as an indication that Orwell
shared that belief, whereas I took it merely as an observation by Orwell
about the way people behave.

His way of reading his contemporaries was no doubt tempered by his own
conditioning, as is yours or mine. His recognition of that fact is implicit
in the observation he made:-

&quot;But at bottom it is always a writer's tendency, his 'purpose', his
'message', that makes him liked or disliked. The proof of this is the
extreme difficulty of seeing any literary merit in a book that seriously
damages your deepest beliefs.&quot;

He didn't add, &quot;I myself am free from this tendency&quot;. We can take it he was
talking of himself as much as anyone else. But in fact Orwell's wide range
of reading indicates that he was able to read with a relatively open mind.

A FISH Street location was chosen for the Great Fire of London Monument
just 202 feet from the site in Pudding Lane where the fire is said to have
broken out; Wren's column was made 202 feet in height, to match this
distance.
--------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;The Great Fire of London took place in 1666. The fire started in the early
hours of 2 September, reputedly in a small bakery in Pudding Lane. It spread
quickly and burned for five days. It destroyed most of the city, including
thousands of houses and 89 churches, leaving nearly 65,000 people homeless.

The Monument

Plans for a memorial to commemorate the Great Fire were first drawn up in
1670. This monument was planned as a tall pillar, which would provide an
impressive view over the city and would be clearly seen from London Bridge.
A location was chosen on Fish Street, just 202 feet from the site in Pudding
Lane where the fire is said to have broken out. The final plan seems to have
been a collaboration between Hooke and Wren. It took the form of a simple
Doric column of Portland stone, with a viewing balcony on top. It took six
years to build, from 1671 to 1677. The ornament for the top was the subject
of much discussion. Wren originally planned a phoenix, but later felt that
the spreading wings would be dangerous in high winds. He then favoured a
statue of King Charles II. The final choice was the alternative preferred by
the King, a simple copper urn with gilt flames.

The column is 202 feet in height, to match its distance from the reputed
origin of the fire. Inside, it has a cantilevered stone staircase around a
central well. 311 steps lead to a viewing platform 160 feet (50m) above
ground level. The steps continue inside the pillar above the platform, and
finally there is a vertical ladder through the flaming urn to a trapdoor
at the very top of the Monument.

The Cellar Workroom

The dual purpose of The Monument, forgotten since the days of Wren and
Hooke, was first recognised in recent times by the historian Lisa Jardine1.
The Monument was designed as the setting for a series of physical
experiments which needed heights. There is a cellar laboratory directly
below the ground floor, designed by Hooke and Wren.

A Zenith Telescope

Hooke was already interested in the idea of a zenith telescope, which would
make exact measurements of a selected fixed star. He hoped to discover
evidence of the Earth's annual motion about the Sun. The design of The
Monument allowed it to be used in this way: the cellar laboratory could be
used by the experimenter, while the hollow shaft could be opened to the
night sky by a hinged trapdoor in the urn at the top. Unfortunately, this
type of building was not stable enough to give the required accuracy of
measurements, so Hooke was unable to use the Monument as he had planned.

Hooke's Other Experiments

The steps were carefully placed so that each stair-riser was exactly six
inches high. This meant that the niches at regular intervals could be used
for experiments on pressure, whereas the vertical shaft could be used
for experiments with pendulums. Hooke noted a number of experiments
at the 'Fish Street pillar', especially in the development of
a wheel barometer, to measure very slight changes in pressure.

Visiting the Monument

The Monument is maintained by the Corporation of London. From 10am to 6pm
daily, visitors can climb the 311 steps to the observation platform, 160
feet (50m) above ground level. This gallery originally had a simple railing,
and was the scene of a number of suicides. After a maidservant threw herself
over in 1842, the gallery was fully enclosed. The view of the City of London
is still impressive. There is no access for the public to the underground
laboratory or the steps and ladder above the platform.

As a monument to the Great Fire, the pillar is now an historical curiosity.
It is still a good viewpoint, but no longer dominates the surrounding area.
In the 21st Century, perhaps it should be recognised as a monument to the
scientific as well as the architectural achievements of [H]ooke &amp; [W]ren.&gt;&gt;

Am I to understand that you checked my interpretation of what Mr. Veal
said with Mr. Veal, before getting back to me? If so, I guess it's
unimaginable that you misunderstood what he was telling you, or that
you inadvertently misrepresented the situation to him.

But that's implausible, so it must be that either you or I, or both of
