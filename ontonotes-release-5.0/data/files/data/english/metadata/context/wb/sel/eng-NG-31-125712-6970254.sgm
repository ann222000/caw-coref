I am currently 'evaluating' this :

Xilisoft DVD Ripper Platinum is all-in-one DVD rip software with powerful and integrative functions,
which can rip a DVD to popular video and audio formats such as DVD to DivX, MPEG, WMV, MP3 with
ease.. So easy to use and faster than ever before, just few clicks to rip a DVD!

It includes features of DVD Ripper and DVD Audio Ripper. No DVD rip software supports so
comprehensive video and audio formats, i.e., rip DVD to all popular video formats such as DVD to
DivX, AVI, MPEG, WMV, RM, MOV, MP4, 3GP, 3G2, ASF, rip DVD to audio formats including MP3, WAV, WMA,
AAC, AC3, M4A, MP2, OGG with the fastest speed.

It comes with a multiple keygen, use the ' DVD Ripper Platinum 4 ' option.
