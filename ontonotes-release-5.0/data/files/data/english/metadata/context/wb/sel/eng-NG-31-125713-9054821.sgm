Arrived earlier this evening and there was 1, yes 1 aircraft on stand
- a Britishjet aircraft.  Why oh why do we need to be greeted with
such an empty looking airport?

I also noticed another Heathrow-transfer passenger in the main
terminal - presumably enroute to CDG - one Mr. Alastair McCoist -
another passenger having to transfer LHR to get to CDG!  He obviously
couln't bear the thought of the 'M8 slog' ;-) - roll on late October
and the intoruction of the much needed CDG service!

There were lots of Europeans and other nationalities on my flight from
LHR.  Also a point to note whilst in the lounge on my southbound
flight - I was sat next to 3 passengers - overheard 2 of them say they
were off to MUC and another off to FRA.  Via where?  LHR of course!

International, indeed :-(

Indeed, an appaling state of for what was once on the UK's main
international airprots.

I arrived into GLA two nights ago, I left an extremly busy Stansted
and arrived into GLA with just an FCA 757 on the Intl stand, plus the
usal BA/BD/EZY aircraft on the other piers.

Roll on any new routes we can bloody get and its getting worse day by
day, just about every day there is an announcment in the UK of new
routes, they just NEVER seem to be from GLA.

Oh yea, I was also at International arrivals the other week and there
was an Asian woman there meeting family from a flight from Italy, she
asked the woman at the desk at International arrivals &quot;When will the
flight from Italy land&quot; she was told &quot;you are in the wrong area, you
need to go upstares to domestic arrivals as they are coming in via
London, you cant fly to Italy from here&quot; how embarising!!!!!!

Think you guys are being a bit negative, when I flew out last Thursday
morning to Barcelona we got stuck in the rush hour when taking off
delaying take off by around 15 mins. There were also 4 aircraft in the
queue behind us. Think you'll find the stands filling up later as all
the based aircraft arrive home. However i do agree we could do with a
few more Euro routes.

The lady from Italy might have been coming in via Amsterdam and KLM so
she may have been given the wrong info.

I believe Ally McCoist lives around Houston, we'll he used to, only a
5 minute drive to Glasgow Airport. It would certainly be a pain in the
arse to go through to Edinburgh for a short flight to a relatively
local airport such as Paris.

I normally go via AMS. Connections are excellent. I get my KLM miles
and I can have a beer on the way home. As we have an office in the
Netherlands I often have to pick up bits and pieces en-route.

Hi Crawford,
The international tag works well for places such as BRS.It seems to me
that a city the size of Glasgow should have an international
airport,and be able to serve decent destinations like BRS.I know we've
all done the 'catchment area' thing to death here.I remember reading a
few years back of a comparison between GLA and CPH(I think).Similar
sized city in a similar sized country(population).CPH employed
something like 10 times the workforce of GLA and served 5 times the
destinations.Even allowing for the SAS tie-in,that's pretty shocking
figures.

Comparison is difficult though because we have three international
airports (according to poular opinion) in close proximity.  Much the
same could be said for DUB or OSL as for CPH. Perhaps if central
Scotland had just one airport it would start to mach these others?

I had the same thoughts tonight - a Central Scotland Airport would be
putting through nigh on 20 million passengers a year - but that
topic's been discussed to death before.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Crawford

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Crawford,
&gt; &gt; &gt; The international tag works well for places such as BRS.It seems to me
&gt; &gt; &gt; that a city the size of Glasgow should have an international
&gt; &gt; &gt; airport,and be able to serve decent destinations like BRS.I know we've
&gt; &gt; &gt; all done the 'catchment area' thing to death here.I remember reading a
&gt; &gt; &gt; few years back of a comparison between GLA and CPH(I think).Similar
&gt; &gt; &gt; sized city in a similar sized country(population).CPH employed
&gt; &gt; &gt; something like 10 times the workforce of GLA and served 5 times the
&gt; &gt; &gt; destinations.Even allowing for the SAS tie-in,that's pretty shocking
&gt; &gt; &gt; figures.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bill

&gt; &gt; Comparison is difficult though because we have three international
&gt; &gt; airports (according to poular opinion) in close proximity.

&gt; According to &quot;popular opinion&quot;? Are you suggesting for a minute that it isn't
&gt; the reality? The longest journey between any of the three is 71 miles (EDI -
&gt; PIK) and can be done in well under 1 1/2 hours by car. EDI - GLA is 49 miles
&gt; and can be done in well under an hour 90 % of the time. GLA to PIK is a breeze
&gt; since the M77 extension opened and can be done in 35 minutes. `According to
&gt; popular opinion` should be deleted and changed to `in very close proximity`.

According to *you* &quot; 'according to popular opinion' should be deleted
and changed to &quot;in very close proximity&quot;' or are you suggesting no
other opinion should be heard?

Often driving between the airports is easy - but it would appear that
more than one person on these groups has a reason for using their
nearest airport rather than the one that offers direct flights.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Arrived earlier this evening and there was 1, yes 1 aircraft on stand
&gt;- a Britishjet aircraft.  Why oh why do we need to be greeted with
&gt;such an empty looking airport?

&gt;I also noticed another Heathrow-transfer passenger in the main
&gt;terminal - presumably enroute to CDG - one Mr. Alastair McCoist -
&gt;another passenger having to transfer LHR to get to CDG!  He obviously
&gt;couln't bear the thought of the 'M8 slog' ;-) - roll on late October
&gt;and the intoruction of the much needed CDG service!

&gt;There were lots of Europeans and other nationalities on my flight from
&gt;LHR.  Also a point to note whilst in the lounge on my southbound
&gt;flight - I was sat next to 3 passengers - overheard 2 of them say they
&gt;were off to MUC and another off to FRA.  Via where?  LHR of course!

&gt;International, indeed :-(
">

I don't think the number of aircraft on stands is a great indicator of
airport success. I'd strongly suggest visiting the airport at 11pm or
arriving on the late flight from LGW (gets in around 11). Every single
stand full, with an aircraft on each, apart from the international pier,
which will have probably 4 stands occupied. There are times during the
day when many airports have no aircraft, and a good thing too, as they
need to fly to earn money.

As has been discussed before, many of us are constrained to fly with the
airline of our company's choice, not our own, and have little discretion
to use other services. I have managed to educate the London based travel
unit my own company a little, but whenever a new agent arrives on the
team booking reverts to London routings.

Hi
Well I am routing via LHR for my trip to Minneapolis. For the class of
travel I am in BA were the best price compared to everyone else.
Direct US flights from Glasgow just put the price out of the window. I
dont want to travel across to the USA in a normal economy seat, would
rather have WT+ (most of the time) or Club World (if I am on holiday
travel).

With all other flights I try and use direct as much as possible but
some places just dont have direct from GLA so its use EDI, PIK
(depending on timinings) or route via another Hub from GLA.

I find it a nonsense that people object to you not using certain
services. I start all my trips from GLA, should it matter whether I
use a direct service or route through AMS or LHR?
I'll use whatever is conveniant for me whether it be governed by price
or schedule.
