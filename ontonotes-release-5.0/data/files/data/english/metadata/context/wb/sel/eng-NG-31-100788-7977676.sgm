Microsoft is to pull out of the videogame industry in 2008 or 2009.

Xbox 360 production to end in early to mid late 2008.

R&amp;D on the next-generation of  Xbox (3rd-gen) halted

all first party Microsoft Game Studios will work on Games for Windows
after 2008.

third party support for Xbox 360 to last until 2009, maybe 2010.

but otherwise it's over, according to Microsoft's latest financial
report.

Microsoft was doing okay against PS3, but it was the unexpected
success of the Nintendo Wii that forced the computer OS &amp; software
giant to decide, enough is enough.

lol.

More spin... or maybe this is just a joke. For anyone seriously
interested, the financial report can be found here:
http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2007/jul07/07-19Q4FY07ERPR.m...

Aside from the comment about the $1 billion in loss over the next
three years for XBox 360 repairs, there is no mention of the console
being canceled or a pull out of the market. You'll also note that none
of the media has picked up on this &quot;news&quot;. It's either a joke or bad
information.

Here's a quote form the release.

&quot;...This fiscal year marked the general availability of Microsoft's
flagship products, Windows Vista® and the 2007 Microsoft Office
system. Revenue growth was primarily driven by solid customer
acceptance of these products, as well as increasing sales of existing
products such as SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, and Xbox
360™ consoles.

&quot;Our results this quarter cap off an extremely strong fiscal year for
the company,&quot; said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer at
Microsoft.  &quot;We have healthy core businesses and are strategically
investing in growth opportunities, which will build on our success and
contribute to continued double-digit revenue and earnings growth in
fiscal year 2008.&quot;

only an idiot like you would think the above was anything more than a
joke.

The 360 is doing pretty well overall, compared to PS3, dispite all the
problems
with 360 hardware which Microsoft is addressing with the $1billion
worth of warranties and the upcoming 'Falcon' motherboard/chip
revision.

MS has said their in it for the long haul. they said in 2000 that the
Xbox brand was a 20 year project.  they'll produce Xbox as long as
Sony produces Playstations or longer.

the tide has turned this year with both 360 and Wii well ahead of
PS3.    the Playstation brand has never been in this much trouble
before. not even close.

It is a well publicized fact that the Xbox Gaming Division has NEVER
turned a profit to date.

With the Red Ring-o-Death fiasco costing the shareholders a writedown
of $1.1 Billion, and add the $50 million for two episodes on GTA IV,
the shareholders have said enough to this poorly executed pissing
contest/spending spree.

Failure rates for the Wii &amp; PS3 are less than 1%...Xbox 360 is
33%...Sayonara 360!

It's also fact that the only company profiting off the current gen of
consoles is Nintendo.

$1 billion is a lot, but that number was a figure given to investors
as to how much Microsoft will be paying out in the long term for the
damages. Long term being years. It's worth noting too that if
Microsoft were planning to take profit hit on an upcoming XBox 360 it
wouldn't be unheard of for them to over estimate repair cost in order
to padd the budget a bit. They would not disclose publicly (even to
investors) a price cut.

Microsoft has never stated that there is a 33% failure rate. If you
can find a source where Microsoft admits to this please provide it
because just last week they were refusing to put a percentage on the
issue. They stated that the issue &quot;may effect&quot; all consoles, not that
it will and they have never admitted to 33% or any percentage or even
hinted at such.

The best I can track down the 33% rumor is that comes from a retail
group report, which is a reliable source, but the question is if the
problem is only effecting 30% that means 70% of all 360 customers are
not having the issue. The $1-billion dollar spending spree Microsoft
justified to investors may very well target other things as well, or
it could really be set aside for the red rings issue.

The $50 million for the GTA exclusives is a lot, but it's actually $25
million per EXCLUSIVE chapter for the XBox 360 and by exclusive we
don't mean like Unreal Tournament exclusive for PS3 where the XBox 360
version is just waiting to be released. This is the cost  today to get
gaming exclusives on you console, it's payment for revenue the company
could have made had they released on other consoles and considering
that two of the previous GTA games (III and San Andreas) are ranked by
critics to be some  the best video games made http://www.metacritic.com/games/ps2/scores/
I don't think Microsoft could have picked a better series and the
price seems about right.

You mis-spelled &quot;myth&quot;. The Xbox division was profitable in one
quarter, the quarter Halo 2 came out. It will happen again when Halo 3
comes out.

http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=6521

Xbox division posts a profit as Microsoft reports record quarter
Rob Fahey 15:16 28/01/2005

Microsoft's console reports first profitable quarter as installed base
nears 20 million

Second quarter financial results from software giant Microsoft have
seen the Home and Entertainment Division, which is responsible for the
Xbox, posting a profit for the first time as sales rocketed.

The division announced a profit of $84 million on sales of $1.41
billion for the three months ended December 31st, reversing a loss of
$397 million on sales of $1.27 billion in the same period last year.

Although it still remains unlikely that the Xbox will ever break even
overall, given the scale of losses in its life to date, achieving a
profitable quarter is a huge milestone for Microsoft and reflects both
the huge success of Halo 2, which has racked up $300 million in
revenue since its launch, and the strong hardware sales of the
platform during the holiday season.

Microsoft's figures reveal that 19.9 million Xboxes have now been
sold, with the lion's share - some 13.2 million - of those in North
America, where the platform has improved its year-on-year market share
in for the past 14 months consecutively.

Europe lags far behind with five million consoles sold, while the Asia-
Pacific region manages just 1.7 million consoles, giving a clear
indication of where Microsoft's games strategy has been a success -
and where there is still much to be done to shift Sony and even
Nintendo from their market positions.

Interestingly, the Xbox worldwide figure isn't that far ahead of
Nintendo's GameCube figures, which were announced earlier this week
and showed total shipments of about 18.8 million units, and with the
Xbox achieving a 7.7 attach rate in North America (believed to be
lower elsewhere) compared to the Cube's global attach rate of over 8,
software sales across the two platforms in this generation have
probably been broadly similar.

Microsoft's achievement in terms of bringing in a profitable quarter
for its console was lauded by outgoing CFO John Connors, who commented
that &quot;Home and Entertainment has really turned the corner in all
respects - Halo 2 and Xbox Live have been remarkable, exceeding our
expectations.&quot;

&quot;More Xbox consoles were sold during the critical holiday season in
the United States than any of our competitors' consoles,&quot; he
continued. &quot;Demand was so great that we nearly made our full-fiscal-
year console target six months ahead of schedule.&quot;

In terms of future projections, Microsoft expects to hit 21 to 22
million installed units of the Xbox by the end of its financial year
in June, with Xbox Live subscription numbers of 1.6 to 1.8 million
users in the same timescale - an estimate which has been raised from
the original target of 1.5 million.

&gt; &gt;&gt; lol.

&gt; &gt;&gt; [/Sony fanboys, MS haters and Bligs dream]

&gt; &gt; Of fuck off airhole you fucking classless twat.

&gt; &gt; not one fucking link to back up your claims.

&gt; Here's a link for airhead
&gt; http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/halo3/news.html?sid=6175367
">

Which says nothing that Microsoft haven't said themselves.

And you missed the bit:

But while Microsoft's game-industry efforts proved costly, they were
more than made up for by the company's other businesses. Despite the
$1.06 billion 360 warranty charge, the company saw a $3.04 billion net
income on $13.37 billion in revenue during its fourth fiscal quarter,
11 percent higher than the same period in 2006. For the full fiscal
year, the company saw $14.7 billion of net income on revenues of $51.12
billion, a 15 percent increase over the prior fiscal year.

So they can well afford the 360 to lose money hand over fist.

No they haven't. Despite the losses in the Xbox division, Microsofts

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a well publicized fact that the Xbox Gaming Division has NEVER
&gt;&gt;&gt; turned a profit to date.

&gt;&gt;&gt; With the Red Ring-o-Death fiasco costing the shareholders a writedown
&gt;&gt;&gt; of $1.1 Billion, and add the $50 million for two episodes on GTA IV,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the shareholders have said enough to this poorly executed pissing

&gt;&gt;&gt; Failure rates for the Wii &amp; PS3 are less than 1%...Xbox 360 is
&gt;&gt;&gt; 33%...Sayonara 360!

&gt;&gt; It's also fact that the only company profiting off the current gen of

IF TRUE, this is GREAT!!! The best news in years! Oh, I only wish it were

It's what they were saying about Apple too ten years ago! Everyone said
Apple is as good as dead!  Well, a few million iPods, IMacs and Iphones
later it has proven that rumors of Apple's imminent demise was premature, to
say the least.  Depending on how it plays its cards, Sony too could still
pull PS3 out of the nosedive, and I think it will eventually succeed. If it
differentiates itself from the Wii and Xbox crowd, and places itself as a
premier, quality product for more mature and discerning audiences, providing
a superior videogaming experience, it could still come out doing very well.
But if it tries to compete directly with Nintendo and Xbox, it must lose!
Because M$oft is for the dumbed down masses. THere's a growing adult gaming
audience that wants something better than the same old sh*t. And will pay,
if it can get it.

ripping off what Apple and others had  created years before, while selling
the dumb suckers a bill of goods! Bill &quot;of goods&quot; Gates's single
contribution to the computer industry was in proving that in America, a
sucker is born every single minute, non stop. So there is no way MSoft can
go broke, unfortunately, since there is no way the American public can ever
be &quot;smarted up&quot; after so many decades of having been studiously and
purposely dumbed down.

Bill Gates has a golden cow to milk called the American public that never
stops giving. Despite the fact that Apple (and others) had consistently
developed far superior OS's since the late 1970s, Gates has managed to
continuously pull the wool over the public's eyes with his buggy, crashy,
and horribly virus-infested OS's , and who have accepted whatever toxin he
has foisted upon them, not to mention his snake oil &quot;cures&quot; to supposedly
fix the very ailments his products created in the first place! And now, he
continues in the same tradition with his Xflop360 hardware while his
infantile backers continue to cover his ass despite producing one of the
most defective pieces of consumer electronics in the history of the
industry!  The suckers keep biting nonetheless! What a crew! Now mind you,
the first Xbox wasn't too bad. It lasted me a WHOLE 20 months, which for a
Bill Gates product is quite incredible! Until it went belly up two months
ago (I've been using the PS2 ever since), I was almost ready to believe that
MSoft had had a miraculous conversion! But, the tiger don't change its
stripes that easily. The Xflop360 has restored Bill Gates's bad name, and my
lack of faith in him :) He sucks. He always sucked. And always will. Which
is why he will remain the richest man in America for the forseeble future.
Until a miracle happens and SAT scores somehow go up 100 points on average!
And you know that ain' gonna happen :)

&gt; &gt;&gt; It is a well publicized fact that the Xbox Gaming Division has NEVER
&gt; &gt;&gt; turned a profit to date.

&gt; &gt;&gt; With the Red Ring-o-Death fiasco costing the shareholders a writedown

&gt; &gt;&gt; the shareholders have said enough to this poorly executed pissing

&gt; &gt;&gt; Failure rates for the Wii &amp; PS3 are less than 1%...Xbox 360 is
&gt; &gt;&gt; 33%...Sayonara 360!

&gt; &gt;&gt; WV

&gt; &gt; It's also fact that the only company profiting off the current gen of
&gt; &gt; consoles is Nintendo.

&gt; Please tell us what makes the Wii a current gen console.&lt;

Because it has a stupid new controller that flies out of kid's hands and

I define a &quot;current generation&quot; console by several factors. I think
the two most defining are the release date of the console combined
with the market space in which it competes, Wii is certainly competing
for market share with PS3 and XBox 360, and both Sony and Microsoft
have acknowledged this. The media has also categorized the Wii as
current generation console based on it's unique User Interface and the
fact that, while it's graphics processor may be less capable than the
XBox 360 and PS3, the Wii is more capable than the original XBox, the
Gamecube and the PS2 (consoles that collectively define &quot;last
generation&quot;).

&gt; &gt; only an idiot like you would think the above was anything more than a
&gt; &gt; joke.

&gt; &gt; The 360 is doing pretty well overall, compared to PS3, dispite all the
&gt; &gt; problems
&gt; &gt; with 360 hardware which Microsoft is addressing with the $1billion
&gt; &gt; worth of warranties and the upcoming 'Falcon' motherboard/chip
&gt; &gt; revision.

&gt; &gt; MS has said their in it for the long haul. they said in 2000 that the
&gt; &gt; Xbox brand was a 20 year project.  they'll produce Xbox as long as
&gt; &gt; Sony produces Playstations or longer.

&gt; &gt; the tide has turned this year with both 360 and Wii well ahead of
&gt; &gt; PS3.    the Playstation brand has never been in this much trouble
&gt; &gt; before. not even close.&lt;

&gt; It's what they were saying about Apple too ten years ago! Everyone said
&gt; Apple is as good as dead!  Well, a few million iPods, IMacs and Iphones
&gt; later it has proven that rumors of Apple's imminent demise was premature, to
&gt; say the least.  Depending on how it plays its cards, Sony too could still
&gt; pull PS3 out of the nosedive, and I think it will eventually succeed. If it
&gt; differentiates itself from the Wii and Xbox crowd, and places itself as a
&gt; premier, quality product for more mature and discerning audiences, providing
&gt; a superior videogaming experience, it could still come out doing very well.
&gt; But if it tries to compete directly with Nintendo and Xbox, it must lose!
&gt; Because M$oft is for the dumbed down masses. THere's a growing adult gaming
&gt; audience that wants something better than the same old sh*t. And will pay,
&gt; if it can get it.
">

Apple survived because they were able to acquire a loyal fanbase of
users who were willing to dish out thousands of dollars for computers
that were the equivalents of PCs going for only hundreds of dollars.

Predictions of Apple's demise stemmed from the fact that they pretty
much just made computers back then. Nobody could have predicted the
success of the iPod.

It's an apples to oranges comparison with Sony, however. Sony was in
the electronics business way before it joined the video game industry.
AirRaid was talking about the Playstation brand, not Sony the company.
It's entirely possible for a gaming brand to go the way of the dodo
and it's not unreasonable for someone to predict that's the destiny of
the Playstation brand.

However, it's not likely an accurate prediction and it's definitely
not one that will be good for the industry.

More capable than the Xbox? I don't know about that necessarily...
it's basically just a slightly upgraded Game Cube with a new control

this is utter crap
microsoft doesnt care about makeing money in the slightest
microsoft see this as a long term game
they will keep plugging until they knock sony out of the games business

have you ever known microsoft to give up at anything?

and for all you sony fanboys

if this did happen your games would be back upto £50 a game in no time
not the current £30 for almost all games and £20 even for some

&gt; &gt; It's what they were saying about Apple too ten years ago! Everyone said

premature, to

still

it
&gt; &gt; differentiates itself from the Wii and Xbox crowd, and places itself as
a
&gt; &gt; premier, quality product for more mature and discerning audiences,
providing
&gt; &gt; a superior videogaming experience, it could still come out doing very
well.
&gt; &gt; But if it tries to compete directly with Nintendo and Xbox, it must
lose!
&gt; &gt; Because M$oft is for the dumbed down masses. THere's a growing adult
gaming
&gt; &gt; audience that wants something better than the same old sh*t. And will
pay,
&gt; &gt; if it can get it.

&gt; Apple survived because they were able to acquire a loyal fanbase of

Mac got a small but unshakeable fan base of people who have to do SERIOUS
work on their
computers and have no time for the inconveniences and unreliability of junk
made for the masses. And yes, they were more than willing to pay two or
three times more for one, which is cheap compared to the downtime and other
costly hassles that invariably comes with the althernative. And those Macs
do give Apple a much higher profitability per machine that made it possible
for Apple to get into other product lines. And if Sony does the same with
the PS3, it may have a small user base, but it will be utterly destroyed if
it tries to go head to head with
Nintendo or Xbox.

If the Playstation brand tries to compete with Nintendo and Microsoft, it
most likely will go down.  I think it should follow the Apple strategy of
being cutting edge even if it means being more expensive. It should go
upscale and go after a smaller but more discerning market that would be
willing to pay more for superior graphics, and a more mature gaming
experience.

They didn't knock Apple's Mac out. The few who want or need a superior

I don't care if a game costs $100 if that game can deliver 50 hours of a
really good gaming experience. Or even if renting that game cost me twice as
much as renting a usual Xbox or Wii game. Otherwise, I might as well hold on
to my old PS2 and Xbox (though the latter no longer works, and serves as a
DVD player now). The &quot;last gen&quot; consoles are good enough if all I want is
more of the same.

So? Leave the cheaper consoles to the masses. Not everyone can drive a

Just great. He's even worse than Gates. The best possible thing that could

Doubtful.  The game industry relies on getting as much hardware into the
market as possible to keep software sales high - that's where the money is
made.  There's nothing to be accomplished by keeping console prices at
their original levels for so long.

SERIOUS work? Seriously?

ROTFLMAO

Dude, I used to be a diehard Mac person so you can't pull the wool
over my eyes.

The only thing Macs were good for back in the day, during the time
period I speak of, was graphic design. For a long time, Macs had a
HUGE advantage over PCs in that department. However, PCs have been not
only equal but far superior to Macintoshes in term of graphical power
for at least the past decade.

Macintoshes were crap next to PCs when it came to real serious work
like programming. Whether they were equals in terms of simple software
like word processing or spreadsheets is irrelevant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; three times more for one, which is cheap compared to the downtime and other
&gt; costly hassles that invariably comes with the althernative. And those Macs
">

I won't argue that Macintoshes had a higher reliability rate but in
all honesty I knew very few people who really had bad problems with
PCs although such problems were well documented.

Even when I ran into the blue screen of death, I just had to reboot.
Not a big deal unless it happened over and over again.

And Macs weren't without their problems. I've experienced quite a few
system crashing errors in the past.

Eventually I switched to PC because I was doing computer programming
and the Macintosh just sucked balls in that department. I wasn't doing
graphic design at the time and I didn't have thousands of dollars to
blow on what amounts to a neat little electronic toy.

LOL... Rolls Royce? The Macintosh is just prettier and a bit easier to
use, especially with certain applications like music and video
production applications where you can do what you need to in one or
two clicks (as opposed to going through a minute of set-up on the PC).

The Macintosh is kind of like the Ipod... and heck, the PS3... a
&quot;sexier&quot; device that costs more than the competition but is limited by
the software/content. Macintosh has a limited library of software just
like the PS3... at least when compared to the competition. By
comparison, you can only use your Ipod to listen to music you either
rip yourself or buy from the Itunes store and you can only listen to
AAC files, a horridly inferior compression scheme when compared to
MP3.

Like the Ipod to its competitors, the Macintosh is technically
inferior to PCs. It is nowhere near as powerful and costs an arm and a
leg above a PC. The Ipod similarly is technically inferior to nearly
every competitor and won only because of the visual design and a brute
force killer marketing campaign by Apple to make everyone believe they
had to have one.

That's an interesting strategy but is flawed in that the PS3's gaming
experience is no more mature than the Xbox 360's and the PS3 is not
technically able to pump out superior graphics to the Xbox 360.

The PS3 has a technically superior processor to the Xbox 360 but is
bottlenecked in its graphical bandwidth. If both systems were pushed
to their fullest, the Xbox 360 would have noticeably superior
graphics. At this point in time, every game that has been produced for
both the Xbox 360 and the PS3 looks noticeably better on the Xbox 360
despite the fact that the development teams had a year's extra time to
get out all the kinks and really push the graphical envelope.

In any case, following Apple's lead with the Macintosh would mean
making a technically inferior machine that just looks better and has a
snazzy user interface which really doesn't work with a system that's
meant to simply play games (and watch movies, depending on who you
listen to).
