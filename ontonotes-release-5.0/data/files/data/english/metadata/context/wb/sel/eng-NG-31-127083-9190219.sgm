Please remember that everyone is different.  Several people replied to
the earlier post about setting quits dates with the information that
it hadn't worked for them.  I never did it that way, but it probably
wouldn't have worked for me either.  But, I'm sure that it *has*
worked for many people, too, with or without Chantix.
Don't be discouraged.  Please!!!

Sue is right.  Everyone *is* different.  I have always found that
setting a quit date has been a good tool for me to get started on the
quit.  I've never been able to wake up in the morning and just tell
myself that 'today's the day for smobriety' and just do it.  That
doesn't mean that I have not set a date, gotten to it and then
chickened out that day.  Still, I have found setting one was the best
way, for me.  Just remember it's not about setting a quit date but
quitting and staying quit.  That is what really matters!
