I would log to serve a different logo.jpg per folder. I was hoping
that I could drop a logo.jpg in the folder and have acquisition
magically find the one 'correct' logo. But that doesn't work.

Is there a 'simple' way to have plone look in the 'context' (or
current folder) for the logo.jpg to serve?

For Plone 2.5 and below use CSS:

.section-somefolder #portal-logo {
background: url(alt-logo.jpg) no-repeat;
border: 0;
margin: 0.75em 0em 0.75em 1.5em;
padding: 0;

Not sure how to do it in Plone 3.

David,
We just tried to do this ourselves.  It turns out we had to take this line
out of logo.pt:

tal:replace=&quot;structure view/logo_tag&quot;

Logo.pt can be found in the zmi at
your_plone_site/portal_view_customizations. Once we
took that line out we were able to put the logo.pt in any folder like
you are used to.

I am also going to assume you may want that as a navigation root and
point you to a wiki page:
https://weblion.psu.edu/trac/weblion/wiki/MakeAsubfolderAnavigationRoot

You may also want to consider using the structure tag for that logo now.. i.e.
&lt;img src=&quot;logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;
tal:replace=&quot;structure context/logo.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Then if you add your image to the folder.. Then click the properties
tag for it and add a title it will be in the img tag and it will
acquire the img height and width.

Cheers,
Rob
