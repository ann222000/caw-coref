We are certainly living amid the perils of the last days, and, while we may
intellectually accept the theory of the truth, it will be of no saving value
to us unless the prayer of Christ avails in our behalf, "Sanctify them
through Thy truth: Thy word is truth." The meaning of that prayer is, Make
them holy through the knowledge of the Word. "The light (Christ) shineth in
darkness (the world), and the darkness comprehended it not." Instead of
welcoming that which scatters the darkness, many comprehended it not and
received it not.
Ministers are sent, as was John, to bear witness of that Light. The
office of the messenger sent of God is not to draw the sympathies of the
people to himself, but to direct the affections and sympathies away from
himself, to center them upon Christ. The burden of his message should be,

"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world."
Christ "was in the world, and the world was made by Him"; but the world had
sunk to such terrible depths of unbelief that when its own Creator came to
it, it knew Him not. "He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.
But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of
God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood
nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." This
grace is not inherited.  I wish that all would see that the very same spirit
which refused to accept Christ, the Light that would dispel the moral
darkness, is far from being extinct in this age of the world. There are
those in our day who are no more ready to recognize and acknowledge light
than were the people when the prophets and the apostles came with messages
from God, and many rejected the message and despised the messenger. Let us
beware that this spirit is not entertained by any one of us.

He who was seen by John in the vision, in the midst of the golden
candlesticks, represents Himself as walking among them, going from church to
church, from congregation to congregation and from soul to soul. Here is
unwearied vigilance. While the undershepherds may be asleep, or engrossed
with matters of small importance, He that keepeth Israel doth not slumber
nor sleep. He is the true Watchman. The presence and sustaining grace of
Christ are the secret of all light and life. We are kept by the power of
God, through faith, and that not of ourselves; it is the gift of God. {1888
1019.2}

The Lord Jesus Christ gave the message to John to be written, to come
down through the ages to the end of the world. Words of commendation are
spoken to the church of Ephesus. The "Well done" is pronounced on the good
and faithful servant. But the message does not close here. The Saviour says,
"Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first
love." This has been brought in clear lines before me again and again, and I
have presented it to the people with pen and voice.

Does this striking message mean nothing to us? Is it in no sense applicable?
Why are not such solemn warnings contemplated? Why do not all, with
watchfulness and humility and confession, manifest that repentance that
needeth not to be repented of? Why do so many pass on without taking heed?

Is love abiding in the church? Is it not almost extinct? With many,
their first love for Jesus has cooled. Brethren do not love brethren. The
love of many has waxed cold. The True Witness represents all who have left
their first love as fallen. Did He not know their peril? "Remember therefore
from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I
will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his
place, except thou repent."

Shall these heart-searching truths continue to be passed by with
indifference by the churches? The loss of the first love has opened the door
to a great amount of selfishness, evil surmising, evil speaking, envy,
jealousy, hard-heartedness. This is the fruit borne when the fervor of the
first love has grown cold. There has been but little restraint upon the
tongue, for prayer has been neglected. A Pharisaical righteousness has been
cherished; there is a deadness of spirituality; and a lack of spiritual
eyesight is the result.

The only hope for our churches today is to repent and do their first
work. The name of Jesus does not kindle the heart with love. A mechanical,
formal orthodoxy has taken the place of deep, fervent charity and tenderness
to one another. Will any give heed to the solemn admonition, "Turn ye, turn
ye; for why will ye die?" Fall upon the Rock, and be broken; then let the
Lord Jesus prepare you, to mold and fashion you, as a vessel unto honor.
Well may the people fear and tremble under these words: "Except thou repent,
I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his
place." What then? "If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how
great is that darkness!"

The Spirit will not always strive with the heart that is filled with
perversity. The infinite, forbearing One, who paid the price of His own
blood to save His people, is addressing them. Who will hearken to His
warning? Have the churches that claim to believe the truth for these last
days been fruit-bearing trees of righteousness? Why are they not bearing
much fruit to the glory of God? Why are they not abiding in Christ, and
going on from strength to strength, from character to character?

The word of the Lord to His people is, "Be strong in the Lord, and in
the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able
to stand against the wiles of the devil." Why are the people thus addressed
degenerating into weakness and inefficiency, not having the love of Christ
burning upon the altar of their hearts, and therefore unable to kindle love
in the hearts of others?

God's people have evidence piled upon evidence; they have truth
powerful and convincing. Shall it be kept in the outer court, so that it
does not sanctify the soul? Shall the candle that once burned brightly,
sending its light amid the moral darkness of error, gradually go out, until
it is quenched in darkness?

How was it with Ephesus? she knew not the time of her visitation. She
did not heed the solemn admonitions of God. She did not maintain a vital
connection with Christ, and grievous wolves entered in, and spared not the
flock. That church, once beloved of God, that might have sent her bright
rays amid the moral darkness to enlighten many souls, permitted her light to
go out.

One of the greatest sins that is now extinguishing spiritual light is
want of love for Jesus and one another. "To him that overcometh will I give
to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God."
See the longing, yearning love of Jesus who presents to His people the
attractions of the eternal life, that they may catch the glory of the future
world, and regain their first love. It is not the fashion now to repent. It
is regarded by some as altogether too humiliating a work, altogether too
old-fashioned.

Could any description be more sharp and clear than John has given us.
These things are written for us; they are applicable to the churches of
Seventh-day Adventists. Some may say, "I do not hate my brother; I am not so
bad as that." But how little they understand their own hearts. They may
think they have a zeal for God in their feelings against their brother, if
his ideas seem in any way to conflict with theirs; feelings are brought to
the surface that have no kinship with love. They show no disposition to
harmonize with him. They would as lief be at swords' point with their
brother as not. And yet he may be bearing a message from God to the
people --just the light they need for this time.

Why do not brethren of like precious faith consider that in every age,
when the Lord has sent a special message to the people, all the powers of
the confederacy of evil have set at work to prevent the word of truth from
coming to those who should receive it?  If Satan can impress the mind and
stir up the passions of those who claim to believe the truth, and thus lead
them to unite with the forces of evil, he is well pleased. If once he can
get them to commit themselves on the wrong side, he has laid his plans to
lead them on a long journey. Through his deceptive wiles he will cause them
to act upon the same principles he adopted in his disaffection in heaven.
They take step after step in the false way, until there seems to be no other
course for them except to go on, believing they are right in their
bitterness of feeling toward their brethren. Will the Lord's messenger bear
the pressure brought against him? If so, it is because God bids him stand in
his strength and vindicate the truth that he is sent of God.

When men listen to the Lord's message, but through temptation allow
prejudice to bar the mind and heart against the reception of truth, the
enemy has power to present the most precious things in a distorted light.
Looking through the medium of prejudice and passion, they feel too indignant
to search the Scriptures in a Christlike spirit, but repudiate the whole
matter because points are presented that are not in accordance with their
own ideas.

When a new view is presented, the question is often asked, "Who are its
advocates? What is the position of influence of the one who would teach us
who have been students of the Bible for many years?" God will send His words
of warning by whom He will send. And the question to be settled is not what
person is it who brings the message; this does not in any way affect the
word spoken. "By their fruits ye shall know them."  Truth is often preached
by one who has not experienced its power; but it is truth nevertheless, and
is blessed to those who, drawn by the
