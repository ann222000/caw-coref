&quot;The real light is, not without darkness covering, but never covered
completely.The real hero is, not without foul sentiments, but never
conquered.&quot;

----FuLei
With my limited knowledge of english, i translated it into english.

What i'm going to say here, is about Lust.

It's certain that each of people have lust. especially male.

&quot;You shall not commit adultery.But i say to you that everyone who
looks at a woman with lust has already commited adultery with her in
his heart.&quot;(Matthew)

My question:
Is Lust good or not?

Shall we forbid it?

The most Lust you are, the more confused you will be, isn't it?

Have you ever watched the movie&lt;Human Trafficing&gt;

Girls, especially below the age of 18. always get hurt due to OUR
SINS.

I'm now a student, not knowing why, i believe god and in his words.
with him by, i feel stronger to fight against myself against my lust.

Ok. what about others ? can we make a real difference in our world?

Lust is one basic urge that overtakes us from time to time. While it
lasts, it certainly clouds our perspective and highly attenuates our
capacity for clear sight and judgement. On the other hand, it can
become the starting point for a long journey ... towards our freedom
from it. And, towards that destination, all manner of paths are not
only possible but admissible too.

Freedom from lust is not incumbent upon destruction of lust. That
freedom is attained through acquiring more and more power over our own
self, while the self is sucked into and is covered with the viscous
power of lust. The power I speak of is derived through undiluted
awareness of our self --- before, during and after the overpowering
presence of lust.

The long intense haul against lust usually starts with the clear
realisation that lust skews up our perspective and our capacity for
judgement. When the value or the full import of that realisation dawns
upon us, the journey would have begun in right earnest.

However, there is nothing heathenish about lust, unless one indulges
in regretful actions, actions painful to others, while being under its
sway.

The cause against lust by Christians is false and stupid.
Lust is an emotion that comes unbidden, its appearance cannot be
controlled anymore than any other type of hunger. How you act apon
that lust is different, but you cannot command lust to come or go.
If you accept that we are all created by god, then lust comes from
god. All desires come from god.
But if it is a crime to &quot;look at a woman&quot; then it is wholly the fault
of god.
If it is a crime to give into lust then it is the fault of god that he
did not preparee me with sufficient will to reject my lust.
Thi swhole question is just one of a multitude of contradiction that
exist inside the Christian doctrines.

Yeah I totaly agree with Chaz on this one.

Lust itself is not(I belive) controlable, it is how we handle such
feelings that are important.

If you go out from the perspective that god is the one who created you
remember, god created you to decide over the good things and the bad
things in live and everyone has a breaking point a moment when the
dark side takes over, you decide every day to go for the good things
to love instead of to hate.
To be in the position to dicide over good and bad and choose the good,
to ignore the lust to step over the moment of doubt and paine makes
you a good person.

Because it is the act you choose for that decides who you are. Not the
things in live you choose to ignore. Now god gave you lust so you can
choose for the good there aint no good without the bad. So from my
point of view lust is a good thing a thing that makes you able to
choose for the good. Ask yourself what is live without problems to
conquer mountains to climb. Well.... A pretty boring place.

To be fair, I think that belief stemmed from an Essene viewpoint
and this quote, in my opinon, serves as strong evidence of Essene
doctrine in Jesus' teachings.  The Essenes were trying to be in
complete control of all aspects of themselves.  Thus their celibacy,
which I don't think Jesus embraced, although this conflict between
Jesus' philosophy and his personal life has led to one of the biggest
questions regarding him.  It would be very Essene to demand that one
be in complete control over oneself to this extent because, in their
view, if you imagined something, you have placed it before God's eyes
and He has seen it.  The Essene's kabbalistic teachings would have led
them to believe that there are certain levels of 'reality' like the
physical, dreams, waking thoughts (imaginings) and formulated plans
(like a blueprint--a perfectly formed image in great detail, yet there
is no actual tangible form).  Thus, if we imagine something, we give
it a certain amount of reality and, with lust, it would create a
certain level of reality to the adulterous act and make us guilty of
commiting adultery.  Therefore the quote was based on a more mystical
Essene understanding of the universe.

As with any instinct, desire, impulse, it's how we react to them
that's important.  Although I would say that lust is controlable, it
is to the betterment and continuance of the species that we, from time
to time, indulge ourselves.  But, of course, that could never be
interpreted to mean the allowance of rape or any sexual assault.
Completely uncontrolled lust is responsible for a great deal of woe in
today's world.

Hello, Matthijs!

I was wondering what you meant by the words 'good' and 'bad' in your
text.....

1)One might develop tastes during life and think that beer is good and
champagne is bad; that rock sounds good and jazz sounds bad; that sleeping
late is good and waking up early is bad....

2)One the other hand, one might think that being honest is right and being
dishonest is wrong; that forgiving is right and hating is wrong, things like
that.

If what you meant is more toward what is exemplified in the paragraph
numbered as 2), would you say that every person is born already with the
concepts of what is wrong and what is right ready in their minds? Would you
say that everyone needs to learn these concepts after being born?

Valtermar

I think you need to look at Genesis to get the Christian view.
Basically an angel (Lucifer) was jealous of God and wanted to be like
him so he started a revolution and was banished from heaven to hell.
An agent of Lucifer in the form of a snake tempted Eve to eat fruit
from the tree of knowledge. God had forbidden them to eat from it. She
then convinced Adam to join her. It was only after &quot;eating the
forbidden fruit of knowledge&quot; in order to &quot;be like god&quot; that they &quot;saw
that they were naked&quot; and felt the shame of sex and felt the need to
cover themselves. This is called the &quot;original sin&quot; and for it God
through Adam and Eve out of eden - an even referred to as &quot;the fall&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From then on they had to work and children were to be born in pain.
">

Generations latter Mary, who is frequently pictured stepping on the
head of a serpent, has Jesus through a virgin birth - he is the son of
God. Jesus is heralded as the Mesiah who is born without original sin
(in fact Mary herself was conceived without original sin - a fact that
is referred to as &quot;Immaculate Conception&quot;). Jesus voluntarily takes on
the burden of sin - including original sin - and dies on the cross in
order to atone for all of the sin of mankind. He is heralded as the
&quot;new Adam&quot; who allows mankind to reattain the innocence they once had
in the garden of eden.

I think that (symbolically of course) Jesus provides a way for the
kundalini to re-flow in western culture. He allows for the coital life
and the highest level shakras to communicate in the innocence, bliss
and light of their true nature of union with God free from even the
knowledge of lust and reveling in innocence.

The shame of lust is therefore, from a Christian perspective, a result
of the &quot;fall&quot; of man from eden and presumably the reuniting which
Jesus came to create, frees man from it. A careful reading will show
that the &quot;immaculate&quot; of the &quot;immaculate conception&quot; is a freedom, not
from sex, but from a loss of innocence about sex. It is a freedom from
even being able to see it as dirty.

Sex then becomes integrated into the mystic traditions and are
integral to all mystic union with God.

See for example the modern &quot;beat&quot; saints like Allen Ginsberg who moved
back and forth between union and sex like a fish.

It is really only when men (and women) try to achieve power over each
other that they attain a state of knowledge that is sufficient for
them to see the shame of being naked. They reject insight and use sex
instead to attain power. They are afraid of how they feel. They then,
as some members of all primate communities do, attack and dominate
everyone around them insisting that they behave as told or face
violence. It is this fundamentalist urge, primitive in its origin,
that results in the shame necessary to suppress sex in the way that so
many have in western tradition. Generation after generation those
whose consciousness is low attack the free expression of innocent sex.
They are the ones truly capable of lust. They cut off the lower
chakras and separate them from the upper denaturing union making it
dry, sterile and unproductive (not to mention not much fun). For in
them it is dirty and wrong because of the shame that originates in
their ignorance and fear. This perception of sex as dirty contradicts
their urge to do it, so the conflict is set up that results in these
fundamentalist preachers first condemning sex and then practicing it
in its most limiting, furtive and hiding sense-full of shame and
guilt. It is tragic.

I am not sure who I pity more - the fundamentalist preacher who
condemns sex and then sees a prostitute or the fundamentalist preacher
who condemns sex and then doesn't see a prostitute but rather controls
and disciplines his urges terminating in all lack of genuine feeling.
Admittedly the first is a hypocrite but at least a human one. I have a
lot of sympathy for them.

Who knows, maybe as our culture becomes more and more liberal and our
consciousness raises higher and higher the shame of lust will be
replaced by the shared light of being and we will really start to have
fun? Sex is not just natural its integral. Its the future.

It is the power over your self, to keep it free of all obfuscating
effects including lust, so that you are able to see clearly everything
and all aspects to a situation.

For instance, in lust you get more and more coiled up in yourself, on
what you want and desire here and now to the exclusion of all else. In
such a situation, to remember to be aware of the other person's need
too, and beyond, would signify a degree of freedom from the blinding
effects of lust.

It means that it not lust on the driving seat, but you. Then you have
the opportunity to choose your action, and its consequences, with
understanding. Then, if you so choose, you may guide the power of lust
to more harmonious fulfillment for yourself ( and the other person, if
involved ) or set about transmuting that manifest heightened emotional
energy to that consciousness which is free of lust. The choice would
be yours ---   the pleasure or the knowledge ---  depending upon how
you prioritise for yourself at that instant.

Even a baby will struggle against someone's attempt to smother it. It
has not experienced death in this life, but it is given the value that
life must be preserved. That is the innate starting point of its long

&gt; Hello, Matthijs!

&gt; I was wondering what you meant by the words 'good' and 'bad' in your
&gt; text.....

&gt; 1)One might develop tastes during life and think that beer is good and
&gt; champagne is bad; that rock sounds good and jazz sounds bad; that sleeping
&gt; late is good and waking up early is bad....

&gt; 2)One the other hand, one might think that being honest is right and being
&gt; dishonest is wrong; that forgiving is right and hating is wrong, things like
&gt; that.

&gt; If what you meant is more toward what is exemplified in the paragraph
&gt; numbered as 2), would you say that every person is born already with the
&gt; concepts of what is wrong and what is right ready in their minds? Would you
&gt; say that everyone needs to learn these concepts after being born?

&gt; If you go out from the perspective that god is the one who created you
&gt; remember, god created you to decide over the good things and the bad
&gt; things in live and everyone has a breaking point a moment when the
&gt; dark side takes over, you decide every day to go for the good things
&gt; to love instead of to hate.
&gt; To be in the position to dicide over good and bad and choose the good,
&gt; to ignore the lust to step over the moment of doubt and paine makes
&gt; you a good person.

&gt; Because it is the act you choose for that decides who you are. Not the
&gt; things in live you choose to ignore. Now god gave you lust so you can
&gt; choose for the good there aint no good without the bad. So from my
&gt; point of view lust is a good thing a thing that makes you able to
&gt; choose for the good. Ask yourself what is live without problems to
&gt; conquer mountains to climb. Well.... A pretty boring place.

it may seem that lust cannot be controlled, but i doubt thats true. go
cultures with arranged marriages i'd imagine that lust isn't taught as
acceptable. its one thing to look at somebody as attractive and then
move on, and entirely another to look at them and start obsessing or
playing fantasy scenarios or even grossly acting on it.

Quite wrong I'm afraid Erica,

Take Indian culture with it's history of arranged marriges, adultery
is an unspoken but massive problem amongst Indian men.

Lust I think transends culture, which is after all a purly human
thing, whilst lust we can say we share with our animal cusons.  No I
do not belive that it is controlable as such, but I do think that we
can learn to not act on it.

Remarkable! I'm delighted to hear  B'reishit(Genesis) is admittedly a
source of some worthwhile cogitation.
Oh, okay, I admit I'm responding out of  a lust to appear intelligent
and witty. I conceive of ends (whether concrete, physical: eg--a
Porsche; emotional/physical--sexual love; emotional--empathy,etc, at
ends of various continua/ums? For each individual, in each person's
different circumstance, those points will fall someplace along the +/-
of approval. Therefore, if I am attracted to a woman whom I have
absolutely no right to touch, and I want her sexually, but do nothing
toward that end; is this LUST?  Perhaps, if it turns into a
dysfunctional utilization of my time; or, conceivably another
transgression along some other continuum (eg-religious).  So, lust is
relative, and could be incestous.
Anyway, I'm lusting for some coffee, so with apologies to Lee, et al,
See you latte

&gt; I think you need to look at Genesis to get the Christian view.
&gt; Basically an angel (Lucifer) was jealous of God and wanted to be like
&gt; him so he started a revolution and was banished from heaven to hell.
&gt; An agent of Lucifer in the form of a snake tempted Eve to eat fruit
&gt; from the tree of knowledge. God had forbidden them to eat from it. She
&gt; then convinced Adam to join her. It was only after &quot;eating the
&gt; forbidden fruit of knowledge&quot; in order to &quot;be like god&quot; that they &quot;saw
&gt; that they were naked&quot; and felt the shame of sex and felt the need to
&gt; cover themselves. This is called the &quot;original sin&quot; and for it God
&gt; through Adam and Eve out of eden - an even referred to as &quot;the fall&quot;.

&gt; &gt;From then on they had to work and children were to be born in pain.

&gt; Generations latter Mary, who is frequently pictured stepping on the
&gt; head of a serpent, has Jesus through a virgin birth - he is the son of
&gt; God. Jesus is heralded as the Mesiah who is born without original sin
&gt; (in fact Mary herself was conceived without original sin - a fact that
&gt; is referred to as &quot;Immaculate Conception&quot;). Jesus voluntarily takes on
&gt; the burden of sin - including original sin - and dies on the cross in
&gt; order to atone for all of the sin of mankind. He is heralded as the
&gt; &quot;new Adam&quot; who allows mankind to reattain the innocence they once had
&gt; in the garden of eden.

&gt; I think that (symbolically of course) Jesus provides a way for the
&gt; kundalini to re-flow in western culture. He allows for the coital life
&gt; and the highest level shakras to communicate in the innocence, bliss
&gt; and light of their true nature of union with God free from even the
&gt; knowledge of lust and reveling in innocence.

&gt; The shame of lust is therefore, from a Christian perspective, a result
&gt; of the &quot;fall&quot; of man from eden and presumably the reuniting which
&gt; Jesus came to create, frees man from it. A careful reading will show
&gt; that the &quot;immaculate&quot; of the &quot;immaculate conception&quot; is a freedom, not
&gt; from sex, but from a loss of innocence about sex. It is a freedom from
&gt; even being able to see it as dirty.

&gt; Sex then becomes integrated into the mystic traditions and are
&gt; integral to all mystic union with God.

&gt; See for example the modern &quot;beat&quot; saints like Allen Ginsberg who moved
&gt; back and forth between union and sex like a fish.

&gt; It is really only when men (and women) try to achieve power over each
&gt; other that they attain a state of knowledge that is sufficient for
&gt; them to see the shame of being naked. They reject insight and use sex
&gt; instead to attain power. They are afraid of how they feel. They then,
&gt; as some members of all primate communities do, attack and dominate
&gt; everyone around them insisting that they behave as told or face
&gt; violence. It is this fundamentalist urge, primitive in its origin,
&gt; that results in the shame necessary to suppress sex in the way that so
&gt; many have in western tradition. Generation after generation those
&gt; whose consciousness is low attack the free expression of innocent sex.
&gt; They are the ones truly capable of lust. They cut off the lower
&gt; chakras and separate them from the upper denaturing union making it
&gt; dry, sterile and unproductive (not to mention not much fun). For in
&gt; them it is dirty and wrong because of the shame that originates in
&gt; their ignorance and fear. This perception of sex as dirty contradicts
&gt; their urge to do it, so the conflict is set up that results in these
&gt; fundamentalist preachers first condemning sex and then practicing it
&gt; in its most limiting, furtive and hiding sense-full of shame and
&gt; guilt. It is tragic.

&gt; I am not sure who I pity more - the fundamentalist preacher who
&gt; condemns sex and then sees a prostitute or the fundamentalist preacher
&gt; who condemns sex and then doesn't see a prostitute but rather controls
&gt; and disciplines his urges terminating in all lack of genuine feeling.
&gt; Admittedly the first is a hypocrite but at least a human one. I have a
&gt; lot of sympathy for them.

&gt; Who knows, maybe as our culture becomes more and more liberal and our
&gt; consciousness raises higher and higher the shame of lust will be
&gt; replaced by the shared light of being and we will really start to have
&gt; fun? Sex is not just natural its integral. Its the future.

their lives are threatened.

Personal experience tells us how great is the discomfort when we are not

interprets signals sent to it informing that the supply of air is being
compromised. It is an interpretation made according to a fixed programming.
It drives the individual to act in order to correct the situation.

The outcome of such a traumatic experience in the life of a baby, given that
it survives, will possibly be that  it will be preserved in memory as  an
acquired programming, with potential to influence future behavior of this
person when facing situations where this memory might be called upon as
means for interpreting the event..

I guess that when you wrote 'is given the value that life must be
preserved', you were referring to the outcome of this feeling of discomfort
and the desire to breath.
I take it from your reference to &quot;the innate starting point&quot;. Is that right?

If that is so, can you imagine a way of expressing in words the concept of
right of wrong that might be acquired in such a circumstance?

No, it is ' a priori ' ! Even the suffocation has to be interpreted.
And, since the baby has not experienced suffocation before, on what
basis will it interpret the suffocation as signalling a danger to its
life ? The value of self - preservation exists before anything the
baby has experienced in this life.

A suggestion : get off your ' hard - ' and ' soft - ' wired concepts,
if you may. It limits the reality to your concepts. What should be
happening is that your concepts must reach out to the reality, and
equal it. It is the reality that must be the starting point, not the
concept. What is the reality ? Especially look for the exceptions not
covered by the concepts.

I do hope you're just putting that out as 'a brief overview' of
Christian thought.  I say this mainly because the 'fact' of Mary's
immaculate conception was invented in the late 19th century--i.e., you
won't find any scriptural reference to support this 'fact'.  That,
and, of course, sin didn't have the same meaning 2000 years ago as it

Exactly.  So it can't be shamful (when not coupled with an act of

&gt; agree that human beings tend to react in order to protect themselves when
&gt; their lives are threatened.

&gt; Personal experience tells us how great is the discomfort when we are not
&gt; able to breath. I think that this discomfort is generated when the brain
&gt; interprets signals sent to it informing that the supply of air is being
&gt; compromised. It is an interpretation made according to a fixed
&gt; programming.
&gt; It drives the individual to act in order to correct the situation.

&gt; The outcome of such a traumatic experience in the life of a baby, given
&gt; that
&gt; it survives, will possibly be that  it will be preserved in memory as  an
&gt; acquired programming, with potential to influence future behavior of this
&gt; person when facing situations where this memory might be called upon as
&gt; means for interpreting the event..

&gt; I guess that when you wrote 'is given the value that life must be
&gt; preserved', you were referring to the outcome of this feeling of
&gt; discomfort
&gt; and the desire to breath.
&gt; I take it from your reference to &quot;the innate starting point&quot;. Is that
&gt; right?

&gt; If that is so, can you imagine a way of expressing in words the concept of
&gt; right of wrong that might be acquired in such a circumstance?

&gt; Would you care to elaborate giving more examples of concepts of wrongness
&gt; and rightness that might arise as a result of fixed programming being
&gt; activated?

&gt; Have a nice Thursday.

for every action there is an equal *and opposite* reaction...
this is as true for the human mind as it is for heavenly bodies...
absolutely resisting such an inherent urge leads to absolute compulsion...
seek the middle path of moderation

&gt; It's certain that each of people have lust. especially male.

&gt; &quot;You shall not commit adultery.But i say to you that everyone who

&gt; My question:
&gt; Is Lust good or not?

&gt; Shall we forbid it?

&gt; The most Lust you are, the more confused you will be, isn't it?

&gt; Have you ever watched the movie&lt;Human Trafficing&gt;

&gt; Girls, especially below the age of 18. always get hurt due to OUR

&gt; I'm now a student, not knowing why, i believe god and in his words.

REALITY

In a previous message, posted on September 16, with the title &quot;Interpreter&quot;,
we reviewed other messages posted earlier with the same title, and we
stressed the importance we think beliefs play in our lives, influencing our
behaviors. A mention was made about the way the beliefs we acquire influence
the way we see the world. In this message we return to this issue, that is,
the influence that our beliefs play in shaping the way reality is perceived
by us.

We start by asking a question.

Is there a difference between the world itself and the way we perceive it?

That is a question that might sound strange to a lot of people. So many will
say: &quot;Of course the world is the way we perceive it! How could it be
different? We perceive it to be this way because it IS this way!&quot;

Before we go ahead and discuss this subject, let us first question what we
mean by &quot;world&quot;.

One needs a word to use to reference something one has in mind. In this
case, the word &quot;world&quot; seems best suited for that. Still, since the word can
be taken as meaning different things, it is better if one defines the
meaning one is attributing to it before starting.

The world is composed by all the things we perceive out there, outside our
own body, together with all the attributes we think they have. The world is
also composed by those things we do not perceive directly, but that we, for
some reason, assume to exist. Our body, since it inserted in the world and
has the same attributes we perceive outside ourselves, is also considered to
be part of the world.

So, out there, out of our &quot;skin&quot;, our senses can perceive so many things.

Visual inputs tell us about forms, shapes, colors, different degrees of
illumination, distances.

Auditory inputs tell us about so many different kinds of sounds, many of
them linked to things visually perceived.

Tactile  inputs tell us about attributes of surface such as being rough or
smooth, for instance.

There are also these inputs that give us the sense of hotness  or coldness,
lightness and heaviness, wetness and dryness.

Together, in the perception of these things, comes the feelings we develop
toward them. Feelings of like and dislike, for instance. There are also the
values we attribute to them such as being good or bad, ugly or beautiful,
old or new, comfortable or uncomfortable, fashionable or unfashionable,
balanced or unbalanced, right or wrong, important or unimportant, and so on.

Besides those things we can perceive through our own senses, there are those
things we can't sense directly but we can get information from using manmade
sensing devices. Examples of such devices are voltmeters, X-ray appliances,
spectrophotometers, etc.

There are those things about the world we have not experienced ourselves but
that is part of the way we think the world is, or was, because we were told.
So, we learned about the way the world was in ancient times, or even in some
recent times before we were born, things that have changed, things that have
happened. Also, we learn about the existence of atoms and electrons, about
certain physical forces, about the way things work.

There are so many things about the world that we have learned indirectly,
through others.

As a result, inside our mind, we picture the world as being in a certain
way, as things having certain meanings, certain characteristics, certain
attributes.

We perceive the Earth as being round, the sky as being blue. We also
perceive a given person to be attractive, a football player as being one of
the best, a candidate for the government as being the best suited for the
position, a friend as being supportive, a piece of cake as being delicious,
a piece of music as being splendid. All these thinks are considered as being
part of the world we perceive, according to the concept adopted here.

Having explained what we mean by the word &quot;world&quot;, let us repeat the
question presented at the very beginning of this text.

Is there a difference between the world itself and the way we perceive it?

I think we should recognize the existence of two different things:

1) the world itself; and
2) the way we perceive it.

Making parallels, it is like having a person and a photo of the person; or
having a territory and a map of the territory.

The expression &quot;the map is not the territory&quot;, proposed by Alfred Korzybski,
is well known and taken as meaning that our models of reality are not the
same as reality itself. It is about this concept, this distinction we are
writing here.

So, we conceive that there is a world out there, outside our &quot;skin&quot;, that is
the origin our perceptions, the things we sense - some people will not
concede even that point - and there is the model of this world we build
inside our minds.

The idea is, thus, that

&lt;&lt;what we perceive of the world out there is an interpretation of what we
sense.&gt;&gt;

Going back to the first question again. Is there a difference?

We can't know for sure, but we have an idea when we ask: do everybody agree
about the way the world is? If you know about disagreements, then you have
your answer.

If there is disagreement, how can one decide which one is right, which one
is wrong? That is a hard question to answer. You most probably can't.

Anyway, if your own ideas disagree with that of others, you will tend to
think that you are right and the others are wrong. That is a quite expected
outcome.

If we accept the idea that what we perceive of the world is an
interpretation of what we sense, then what is it we use to interpret what we
sense?

Answers to this question - the way I answer them, anyway - can be found in
the previous messages sent with the title &quot;Interpreter&quot;. Our body has two
different kinds our resources to use for making interpretations, classified
according to their origin: the fixed ones and the acquired ones.

The fixed ones are those we are born with, are dictated by our genetic code,
and are traits we share with our fellow humans which have the same genetic
code. The acquired ones are those we learn and are stored in our memories.

The ideas we learn and accept as being true or possible true are resources
we use for making interpretations of what we sense. These ideas have a
strong influence on the way we perceive the world. To refer to these ideas,
I use the word &quot;belief&quot;.

Metaphorically, &quot;beliefs&quot; represent the filters, the lenses through which we
&quot;see&quot; the world.

At this point I would like to present another parallel that I think can help
the reader to understand the ideas I am trying to communicate.

In the center of an immense round shaped saloon there was a huge and well
illuminated white sphere. The sphere was the only thing illuminated, all the
rest being in the dark. Around this saloon there were four well placed
balconies from which a person could look at the sphere. The balconies were
shielded from the environment in the saloon by means of a very transparent
glass. Four persons were placed around the saloon, one in each balcony and
asked to observe the sphere for a short period of time. After that, they
were grouped in a closed room and asked about the color of the sphere. The
first to answer said the sphere was blue, the second said the sphere was
red, the third said it was green and the fourth said it was yellow.
Nonetheless, one entering the saloon could clearly see that it was white.
How could that possibly be?

The answer is that the balconies were shielded by glasses of different
colors, blue, red, green and yellow. So, naturally, each person saw the same
white sphere as being of a different color, the color matching that of the
glass that acted as filter.

Metaphorically speaking, our beliefs act as &quot;filters&quot;, making us &quot;see&quot; the
world as being of different &quot;colors&quot;.

By explaining to the reader these ideas, these concepts about interpreter
and interpretations, fixed and acquired programming, I am lending to the
reader the &quot;lenses&quot; I am using, the &quot;filters&quot; that make it possible for me
to &quot;see&quot; the world in a certain way.

It might be that the reader has learned similar concepts and uses similar
lenses to perceive the world, so that our perceptions of it are similar.

Or it might be that the reader has very different concepts about how things
are, and the perceptions are thus very different as well.

Even if the reader does not agree about the truth of these ideas, their
presentation might make it possible to understand the points of view taken.

The Cathars could be held to believe that the body is the devil and
that creation is a mistake.  The aim in life is to bring it to an end
an return to nothingness as quietly and asa soon as possible.  This
makes lust absolutely bad and to be accommodated by sex without
procreation.  There's a book on this by Theodore Rozak called
&quot;Flicker&quot; which once satisfied my lust for a long laugh.  I currently
have a lust for justice and to see the crooked bastards in the Greater
Manchester Police face it.  Sexual lust does not have to take active
form beyond the individual.  Thus wanking is a mortal sin for some,
interestingly enough in the very church with so many problem priests
prepared to involve more than the Palm Sisters.  Lust isn't the
problem.

&gt; &gt; I think you need to look at Genesis to get the Christian view.
&gt; &gt; Basically an angel (Lucifer) was jealous of God and wanted to be like
&gt; &gt; him so he started a revolution and was banished from heaven to hell.
&gt; &gt; An agent of Lucifer in the form of a snake tempted Eve to eat fruit
&gt; &gt; from the tree of knowledge. God had forbidden them to eat from it. She
&gt; &gt; then convinced Adam to join her. It was only after &quot;eating the
&gt; &gt; forbidden fruit of knowledge&quot; in order to &quot;be like god&quot; that they &quot;saw
&gt; &gt; that they were naked&quot; and felt the shame of sex and felt the need to
&gt; &gt; cover themselves. This is called the &quot;original sin&quot; and for it God
&gt; &gt; through Adam and Eve out of eden - an even referred to as &quot;the fall&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt;From then on they had to work and children were to be born in pain.

&gt; &gt; Generations latter Mary, who is frequently pictured stepping on the
&gt; &gt; head of a serpent, has Jesus through a virgin birth - he is the son of
&gt; &gt; God. Jesus is heralded as the Mesiah who is born without original sin
&gt; &gt; (in fact Mary herself was conceived without original sin - a fact that
&gt; &gt; is referred to as &quot;Immaculate Conception&quot;). Jesus voluntarily takes on
&gt; &gt; the burden of sin - including original sin - and dies on the cross in
&gt; &gt; order to atone for all of the sin of mankind. He is heralded as the
&gt; &gt; &quot;new Adam&quot; who allows mankind to reattain the innocence they once had
&gt; &gt; in the garden of eden.

&gt; I do hope you're just putting that out as 'a brief overview' of
&gt; Christian thought.  I say this mainly because the 'fact' of Mary's
&gt; immaculate conception was invented in the late 19th century--i.e., you
&gt; won't find any scriptural reference to support this 'fact'.  That,
&gt; and, of course, sin didn't have the same meaning 2000 years ago as it
&gt; does today.

&gt; &gt; I think that (symbolically of course) Jesus provides a way for the
&gt; &gt; kundalini to re-flow in western culture.

&gt; Why was kundalini flow earlier prevented in Western culture that it
&gt; required Jesus?  And how did Eastern cultures avoid it, as they've
&gt; never required a Jesus to re-kindle internal energy flow?

&gt; &gt;He allows for the coital life
&gt; &gt; and the highest level shakras to communicate in the innocence, bliss
&gt; &gt; and light of their true nature of union with God free from even the
&gt; &gt; knowledge of lust and reveling in innocence.

&gt; &gt; The shame of lust is therefore, from a Christian perspective, a result
&gt; &gt; of the &quot;fall&quot; of man from eden and presumably the reuniting which
&gt; &gt; Jesus came to create, frees man from it. A careful reading will show
&gt; &gt; that the &quot;immaculate&quot; of the &quot;immaculate conception&quot; is a freedom, not
&gt; &gt; from sex, but from a loss of innocence about sex. It is a freedom from
&gt; &gt; even being able to see it as dirty.

&gt; Care to explain how Mary's parents, both guilty of Original Sin, were
&gt; unable to pass it on?

&gt; &gt; Sex then becomes integrated into the mystic traditions and are
&gt; &gt; integral to all mystic union with God.

&gt; &gt; See for example the modern &quot;beat&quot; saints like Allen Ginsberg who moved
&gt; &gt; back and forth between union and sex like a fish.

&gt; &gt; It is really only when men (and women) try to achieve power over each
&gt; &gt; other that they attain a state of knowledge that is sufficient for
&gt; &gt; them to see the shame of being naked.

&gt; Why is being naked shameful?  That's how God created us.  How can
&gt; there be shame inherent in God's nature?

&gt; &gt;They reject insight and use sex
&gt; &gt; instead to attain power. They are afraid of how they feel.

&gt; Then it's an internal problem and they should address it.

&gt; &gt;They then,
&gt; &gt; as some members of all primate communities do, attack and dominate
&gt; &gt; everyone around them insisting that they behave as told or face
&gt; &gt; violence. It is this fundamentalist urge, primitive in its origin,
&gt; &gt; that results in the shame necessary to suppress sex in the way that so
&gt; &gt; many have in western tradition.

&gt; Shame is necessary?  Necessary to suppressing sex?  Right, so if we're
&gt; really good at shame, we'll all die off in a generation: problem
&gt; sorted.

&gt; &gt;Generation after generation those
&gt; &gt; whose consciousness is low attack the free expression of innocent sex.

&gt; Innocent sex?  Is that possible now, because of Jesus?

&gt; &gt; They are the ones truly capable of lust. They cut off the lower
&gt; &gt; chakras and separate them from the upper denaturing union making it
&gt; &gt; dry, sterile and unproductive (not to mention not much fun). For in
&gt; &gt; them it is dirty and wrong because of the shame that originates in
&gt; &gt; their ignorance and fear.

&gt; Now you're talking: shame originates in ignorance and fear and,
&gt; therefore it would  NOT be the fruit of the tree of knowledge as
&gt; ignorance is not the fruit of knowledge.

&gt; &gt;This perception of sex as dirty contradicts
&gt; &gt; their urge to do it, so the conflict is set up that results in these
&gt; &gt; fundamentalist preachers first condemning sex and then practicing it
&gt; &gt; in its most limiting, furtive and hiding sense-full of shame and
&gt; &gt; guilt. It is tragic.

&gt; Ahhh, the problems of a celibate clergy.  Religion should NEVER stand
&gt; in the way of human nature because, when it does, you end up with
&gt; people cracking under the pressure and assaulting one another.

&gt; &gt; I am not sure who I pity more - the fundamentalist preacher who
&gt; &gt; condemns sex and then sees a prostitute or the fundamentalist preacher
&gt; &gt; who condemns sex and then doesn't see a prostitute but rather controls
&gt; &gt; and disciplines his urges terminating in all lack of genuine feeling.
&gt; &gt; Admittedly the first is a hypocrite but at least a human one. I have a
&gt; &gt; lot of sympathy for them.

&gt; Remember, 'prostitution is bad' is a cultural thing; there was a time
&gt; when every man was supposed to 'worship at the Temple of Venus' as a
&gt; religious duty--now the only Temples of Venus are in Nevada--and NOT
&gt; at Caesar's Palace, either. ;-)

&gt; &gt; Who knows, maybe as our culture becomes more and more liberal and our
&gt; &gt; consciousness raises higher and higher the shame of lust will be
&gt; &gt; replaced by the shared light of being and we will really start to have
&gt; &gt; fun? Sex is not just natural its integral. Its the future.

&gt; Exactly.  So it can't be shamful (when not coupled with an act of
&gt; aggression like rape/assault/involvement of a minor) and anyone who
&gt; says it is, is flying in the face of human nature and God's creation
&gt; as He created it.

Strooth!  The problem there is a celibate clergy.  Of course, celibacy
should be available as a choice, as it is for the laity, but to force
it goes against human nature and, therefore, isn't terribly

&gt; &gt; &gt; dry, sterile and unproductive (not to mention not much fun). For in
&gt; &gt; &gt; them it is dirty and wrong because of the shame that originates in
&gt; &gt; &gt; their ignorance and fear.

&gt; &gt; Now you're talking: shame originates in ignorance and fear and,
&gt; &gt; therefore it would  NOT be the fruit of the tree of knowledge as
&gt; &gt; ignorance is not the fruit of knowledge.

&gt; &gt; &gt;This perception of sex as dirty contradicts
&gt; &gt; &gt; their urge to do it, so the conflict is set up that results in these
&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamentalist preachers first condemning sex and then practicing it
&gt; &gt; &gt; in its most limiting, furtive and hiding sense-full of shame and
&gt; &gt; &gt; guilt. It is tragic.

&gt; &gt; Ahhh, the problems of a celibate clergy.  Religion should NEVER stand
&gt; &gt; in the way of human nature because, when it does, you end up with
&gt; &gt; people cracking under the pressure and assaulting one another.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure who I pity more - the fundamentalist preacher who
&gt; &gt; &gt; condemns sex and then sees a prostitute or the fundamentalist preacher
&gt; &gt; &gt; who condemns sex and then doesn't see a prostitute but rather controls
&gt; &gt; &gt; and disciplines his urges terminating in all lack of genuine feeling.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Admittedly the first is a hypocrite but at least a human one. I have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; lot of sympathy for them.

&gt; &gt; Remember, 'prostitution is bad' is a cultural thing; there was a time
&gt; &gt; when every man was supposed to 'worship at the Temple of Venus' as a
&gt; &gt; religious duty--now the only Temples of Venus are in Nevada--and NOT
&gt; &gt; at Caesar's Palace, either. ;-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Who knows, maybe as our culture becomes more and more liberal and our
&gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness raises higher and higher the shame of lust will be
&gt; &gt; &gt; replaced by the shared light of being and we will really start to have
&gt; &gt; &gt; fun? Sex is not just natural its integral. Its the future.

&gt; &gt; Exactly.  So it can't be shamful (when not coupled with an act of
&gt; &gt; aggression like rape/assault/involvement of a minor) and anyone who
&gt; &gt; says it is, is flying in the face of human nature and God's creation
&gt; &gt; as He created it.

&lt; I think we should recognize the existence of two different things:

1) the world itself; and
2) the way we perceive it. &gt;

What would the ' world itself ' mean to you when you cannot perceive
it ? You may call it Anything, Nothing, Allthing ... and so on ...
even, God ...

The nature of our spiritual journey ( and, every person is along such
a journey, whether he is aware of it or not ) is to start with what we
perceive of the world ( including ourself ) and evolve to that unity
of what the world is in itself.

So, one starts with the perception ...

&gt; REALITY

&gt; In a previous message, posted on September 16, with the title &quot;Interpreter&quot;,
&gt; we reviewed other messages posted earlier with the same title, and we
&gt; stressed the importance we think beliefs play in our lives, influencing our
&gt; behaviors. A mention was made about the way the beliefs we acquire influence
&gt; the way we see the world. In this message we return to this issue, that is,
&gt; the influence that our beliefs play in shaping the way reality is perceived
&gt; by us.

&gt; We start by asking a question.

&gt; Is there a difference between the world itself and the way we perceive it?

&gt; That is a question that might sound strange to a lot of people. So many will
&gt; say: &quot;Of course the world is the way we perceive it! How could it be
&gt; different? We perceive it to be this way because it IS this way!&quot;

&gt; Before we go ahead and discuss this subject, let us first question what we
&gt; mean by &quot;world&quot;.

&gt; One needs a word to use to reference something one has in mind. In this
&gt; case, the word &quot;world&quot; seems best suited for that. Still, since the word can
&gt; be taken as meaning different things, it is better if one defines the
&gt; meaning one is attributing to it before starting.

&gt; The world is composed by all the things we perceive out there, outside our
&gt; own body, together with all the attributes we think they have. The world is
&gt; also composed by those things we do not perceive directly, but that we, for
&gt; some reason, assume to exist. Our body, since it inserted in the world and
&gt; has the same attributes we perceive outside ourselves, is also considered to
&gt; be part of the world.

&gt; So, out there, out of our &quot;skin&quot;, our senses can perceive so many things.

&gt; Visual inputs tell us about forms, shapes, colors, different degrees of
&gt; illumination, distances.

&gt; Auditory inputs tell us about so many different kinds of sounds, many of
&gt; them linked to things visually perceived.

&gt; Tactile  inputs tell us about attributes of surface such as being rough or
&gt; smooth, for instance.

&gt; There are also these inputs that give us the sense of hotness  or coldness,
&gt; lightness and heaviness, wetness and dryness.

&gt; Together, in the perception of these things, comes the feelings we develop
&gt; toward them. Feelings of like and dislike, for instance. There are also the
&gt; values we attribute to them such as being good or bad, ugly or beautiful,
&gt; old or new, comfortable or uncomfortable, fashionable or unfashionable,
&gt; balanced or unbalanced, right or wrong, important or unimportant, and so on.

&gt; Besides those things we can perceive through our own senses, there are those
&gt; things we can't sense directly but we can get information from using manmade
&gt; sensing devices. Examples of such devices are voltmeters, X-ray appliances,
&gt; spectrophotometers, etc.

&gt; There are those things about the world we have not experienced ourselves but
&gt; that is part of the way we think the world is, or was, because we were told.
&gt; So, we learned about the way the world was in ancient times, or even in some
&gt; recent times before we were born, things that have changed, things that have
&gt; happened. Also, we learn about the existence of atoms and electrons, about
&gt; certain physical forces, about the way things work.

&gt; There are so many things about the world that we have learned indirectly,
&gt; through others.

&gt; As a result, inside our mind, we picture the world as being in a certain
&gt; way, as things having certain meanings, certain characteristics, certain
&gt; attributes.

&gt; We perceive the Earth as being round, the sky as being blue. We also
&gt; perceive a given person to be attractive, a football player as being one of
&gt; the best, a candidate for the government as being the best suited for the
&gt; position, a friend as being supportive, a piece of cake as being delicious,
&gt; a piece of music as being splendid. All these thinks are considered as being
&gt; part of the world we perceive, according to the concept adopted here.

&gt; Having explained what we mean by the word &quot;world&quot;, let us repeat the
&gt; question presented at the very beginning of this text.

&gt; Is there a difference between the world itself and the way we perceive it?

&gt; I think we should recognize the existence of two different things:

&gt; 1) the world itself; and
&gt; 2) the way we perceive it.

&gt; Making parallels, it is like having a person and a photo of the person; or
&gt; having a territory and a map of the territory.

&gt; The expression &quot;the map is not the territory&quot;, proposed by Alfred Korzybski,
&gt; is well known and taken as meaning that our models of reality are not the
&gt; same as reality itself. It is about this concept, this distinction we are
&gt; writing here.

&gt; So, we conceive that there is a world out there, outside our &quot;skin&quot;, that is
&gt; the origin our perceptions, the things we sense - some people will not
&gt; concede even that point - and there is the model of this world we build
&gt; inside our minds.

&gt; The idea is, thus, that

&gt; &lt;&lt;what we perceive of the world out there is an interpretation of what we
&gt; sense.&gt;&gt;

&gt; Going back to the first question again. Is there a difference?

&gt; We can't know for sure, but we have an idea when we ask: do everybody agree
&gt; about the way the world is? If you know about disagreements, then you have
&gt; your answer.

&gt; If there is disagreement, how can one decide which one is right, which one
&gt; is wrong? That is a hard question to answer. You most probably can't.

&gt; Anyway, if your own ideas disagree with that of others, you will tend to
&gt; think that you are right and the others are wrong. That is a quite expected
&gt; outcome.

&gt; If we accept the idea that what we perceive of the world is an
&gt; interpretation of what we sense, then what is it we use to interpret what we
&gt; sense?

&gt; Answers to this question - the way I answer them, anyway - can be found in
&gt; the previous messages sent with the title &quot;Interpreter&quot;. Our body has two
&gt; different kinds our resources to use for making interpretations, classified
&gt; according to their origin: the fixed ones and the acquired ones.

&gt; The fixed ones are those we are born with, are dictated by our genetic code,
&gt; and are traits we share with our fellow humans which have the same genetic
&gt; code. The acquired ones are those we learn and are stored in our memories.

&gt; The ideas we learn and accept as being true or possible true are resources
&gt; we use for making interpretations of what we sense. These ideas have a
&gt; strong influence on the way we perceive the world. To refer to these ideas,
&gt; I use the word &quot;belief&quot;.

&gt; Metaphorically, &quot;beliefs&quot; represent the filters, the lenses through which we
&gt; &quot;see&quot; the world.

&gt; At this point I would like to present another parallel that I think can help
&gt; the reader to understand the ideas I am trying to communicate.

&gt; In the center of an immense round shaped saloon there was a huge and well
&gt; illuminated white sphere. The sphere was the only thing illuminated, all the
&gt; rest being in the dark. Around this saloon there were four well placed
&gt; balconies from which a person could look at the sphere. The balconies were
&gt; shielded from the environment in the saloon by means of a very transparent
&gt; glass. Four persons were placed around the saloon, one in each balcony and
&gt; asked to observe the sphere for a short period of time. After that, they
&gt; were grouped in a closed room and asked about the color of the sphere. The
&gt; first to answer said the sphere was blue, the second said the sphere was
&gt; red, the third said it was green and the fourth said it was yellow.
&gt; Nonetheless, one entering the saloon could clearly see that it was white.
&gt; How could that possibly be?

&gt; The answer is that the balconies were shielded by glasses of different
&gt; colors, blue, red, green and yellow. So, naturally, each person saw the same
&gt; white sphere as being of a different color, the color matching that of the
&gt; glass that acted as filter.

&gt; Metaphorically speaking, our beliefs act as &quot;filters&quot;, making us &quot;see&quot; the
&gt; world as being of different &quot;colors&quot;.

&gt; By explaining to the reader these ideas, these concepts about interpreter
&gt; and interpretations, fixed and acquired programming, I am lending to the
&gt; reader the &quot;lenses&quot; I am using, the &quot;filters&quot; that make it possible for me
&gt; to &quot;see&quot; the world in a certain way.

&gt; It might be that the reader has learned similar concepts and uses similar
&gt; lenses to perceive the world, so that our perceptions of it are similar.

&gt; Or it might be that the reader has very different concepts about how things
&gt; are, and the perceptions are thus very different as well.

&gt; Even if the reader does not agree about the truth of these ideas, their
&gt; presentation might make it possible to understand the points of view taken.

In other words, start with something you have.  We experience the
perceptions not the world itself.  And our senses, whichever ones we
wish to contemplate, all have their tolerances or ranges of
efficiency.  For example, we sense that a table top is smooth, yet,
when we look at it through an electron microscope, we see that there
are many hills and valleys that are quite imperceptible to us.

I am not suggesting intensifying our involvement with the details. It
can become limiting, even pitiful beyond a point.

It is to evolve along two dimensions : one, integrating the world or
non - self or the ' body ' view, arising out of our experience and
perception of it, to the bigger picture ending on the self; and, two,
differentiating the witness view of one's self while we are
experiencing or perceiving.

All of the above would be laborious and preparatory to attaining the
all - integrating quantum vision, beyond the body - rooted
identity ... into the identity with Being Infinite. This one is the
Herculean task. One has to gain the agility of awareness through which
one is not overtaken by the any experience whatsoever. For instance,
the breath overtakes us. Sex, too. Hunger, Dreams, ...  and Deep
Sleep.

Am I suggesting that therefore one should try to live without breath,
hunger, sex, dreams, deep sleep ... ? No. What I am suggesting is that
one should be able to witness it, to remain unmodified or
unconditioned by the ' fruits ' or effects of the experience or
perception, whatever it is.

I confess that the journey is arduous, long and, if you permit,
impossible. Despite that, my experience is that if one is focussed
enough, and keeps at it long enough, unmindful of the destructive
effects in the interim, because we are called upon to give up our
possession - rooted identity, desire -  and  pleasure - rooted
identity, thought -  and  knowledge - rooted identity ...   because
they are all finite and transient ...   then, in a manner of speaking,
the Being Infinite itself comes to choose to invite you to realise
that unity.

Of course, the path is not for everybody. Everybody wants to realise
and enjoy the ' fruits ' of life. Who wants to concern himself with
death ? Some of the writers and artists did in the past. Don't see
that happening in these times. I recall Albert Camus with an
overwhelming feeling of regard, in this context.

Perhaps, I wouldn't have shared this much with the Group at large. I
wouldn't have a reason to do that. But, you drew it out of me. You are
a freind, Pat. And that's always a blessing.

&gt; &gt; even, God ...

&gt; &gt; The nature of our spiritual journey ( and, every person is along such
&gt; &gt; a journey, whether he is aware of it or not ) is to start with what we
&gt; &gt; perceive of the world ( including ourself ) and evolve to that unity
&gt; &gt; of what the world is in itself.

&gt; &gt; So, one starts with the perception ...

&gt;   In other words, start with something you have.  We experience the
&gt; perceptions not the world itself.  And our senses, whichever ones we
&gt; wish to contemplate, all have their tolerances or ranges of
&gt; efficiency.  For example, we sense that a table top is smooth, yet,
&gt; when we look at it through an electron microscope, we see that there
&gt; are many hills and valleys that are quite imperceptible to us.

&gt; &gt; &gt; REALITY

&gt; &gt; &gt; In a previous message, posted on September 16, with the title &quot;Interpreter&quot;,
&gt; &gt; &gt; we reviewed other messages posted earlier with the same title, and we
&gt; &gt; &gt; stressed the importance we think beliefs play in our lives, influencing our
&gt; &gt; &gt; behaviors. A mention was made about the way the beliefs we acquire influence
&gt; &gt; &gt; the way we see the world. In this message we return to this issue, that is,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the influence that our beliefs play in shaping the way reality is perceived
&gt; &gt; &gt; by us.

&gt; &gt; &gt; We start by asking a question.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there a difference between the world itself and the way we perceive it?

&gt; &gt; &gt; That is a question that might sound strange to a lot of people. So many will
&gt; &gt; &gt; say: &quot;Of course the world is the way we perceive it! How could it be
&gt; &gt; &gt; different? We perceive it to be this way because it IS this way!&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Before we go ahead and discuss this subject, let us first question what we
&gt; &gt; &gt; mean by &quot;world&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; One needs a word to use to reference something one has in mind. In this
&gt; &gt; &gt; case, the word &quot;world&quot; seems best suited for that. Still, since the word can
&gt; &gt; &gt; be taken as meaning different things, it is better if one defines the
&gt; &gt; &gt; meaning one is attributing to it before starting.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The world is composed by all the things we perceive out there, outside our
&gt; &gt; &gt; own body, together with all the attributes we think they have. The world is
&gt; &gt; &gt; also composed by those things we do not perceive directly, but that we, for
&gt; &gt; &gt; some reason, assume to exist. Our body, since it inserted in the world and
&gt; &gt; &gt; has the same attributes we perceive outside ourselves, is also considered to
&gt; &gt; &gt; be part of the world.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, out there, out of our &quot;skin&quot;, our senses can perceive so many things.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Visual inputs tell us about forms, shapes, colors, different degrees of
&gt; &gt; &gt; illumination, distances.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Auditory inputs tell us about so many different kinds of sounds, many of
&gt; &gt; &gt; them linked to things visually perceived.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Tactile  inputs tell us about attributes of surface such as being rough or
&gt; &gt; &gt; smooth, for instance.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There are also these inputs that give us the sense of hotness  or coldness,
&gt; &gt; &gt; lightness and heaviness, wetness and dryness.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Together, in the perception of these things, comes the feelings we develop
&gt; &gt; &gt; toward them. Feelings of like and dislike, for instance. There are also the
&gt; &gt; &gt; values we attribute to them such as being good or bad, ugly or beautiful,
&gt; &gt; &gt; old or new, comfortable or uncomfortable, fashionable or unfashionable,
&gt; &gt; &gt; balanced or unbalanced, right or wrong, important or unimportant, and so on.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides those things we can perceive through our own senses, there are those
&gt; &gt; &gt; things we can't sense directly but we can get information from using manmade
&gt; &gt; &gt; sensing devices. Examples of such devices are voltmeters, X-ray appliances,
&gt; &gt; &gt; spectrophotometers, etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There are those things about the world we have not experienced ourselves but
&gt; &gt; &gt; that is part of the way we think the world is, or was, because we were told.
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, we learned about the way the world was in ancient times, or even in some
&gt; &gt; &gt; recent times before we were born, things that have changed, things that have
&gt; &gt; &gt; happened. Also, we learn about the existence of atoms and electrons, about
&gt; &gt; &gt; certain physical forces, about the way things work.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There are so many things about the world that we have learned indirectly,
&gt; &gt; &gt; through others.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As a result, inside our mind, we picture the world as being in a certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; way, as things having certain meanings, certain characteristics, certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; attributes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; We perceive the Earth as being round, the sky as being blue. We also
&gt; &gt; &gt; perceive a given person to be attractive, a football player as being one of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the best, a candidate for the government as being the best suited for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; position, a friend as being supportive, a piece of cake as being delicious,
&gt; &gt; &gt; a piece of music as being splendid. All these thinks are considered as being
&gt; &gt; &gt; part of the world we perceive, according to the concept adopted here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Having explained what we mean by the word &quot;world&quot;, let us repeat the
&gt; &gt; &gt; question presented at the very beginning of this text.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there a difference between the world itself and the way we perceive it?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think we should recognize the existence of two different things:

&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) the world itself; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) the way we perceive it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Making parallels, it is like having a person and a photo of the person; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; having a territory and a map of the territory.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The expression &quot;the map is not the territory&quot;, proposed by Alfred Korzybski,
&gt; &gt; &gt; is well known and taken as meaning that our models of reality are not the
&gt; &gt; &gt; same as reality itself. It is about this concept, this distinction we are
&gt; &gt; &gt; writing here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, we conceive that there is a world out there, outside our &quot;skin&quot;, that is
&gt; &gt; &gt; the origin our perceptions, the things we sense - some people will not
&gt; &gt; &gt; concede even that point - and there is the model of this world we build
&gt; &gt; &gt; inside our minds.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The idea is, thus, that

&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;what we perceive of the world out there is an interpretation of what we
&gt; &gt; &gt; sense.&gt;&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Going back to the first question again. Is there a difference?

&gt; &gt; &gt; We can't know for sure, but we have an idea when we ask: do everybody agree
&gt; &gt; &gt; about the way the world is? If you know about disagreements, then you have
&gt; &gt; &gt; your answer.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If there is disagreement, how can one decide which one is right, which one
&gt; &gt; &gt; is wrong? That is a hard question to answer. You most probably can't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, if your own ideas disagree with that of others, you will tend to
&gt; &gt; &gt; think that you are right and the others are wrong. That is a quite expected
&gt; &gt; &gt; outcome.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If we accept the idea that what we perceive of the world is an
&gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation of what we sense, then what is it we use to interpret what we
&gt; &gt; &gt; sense?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Answers to this question - the way I answer them, anyway - can be found in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the previous messages sent with the title &quot;Interpreter&quot;. Our body has two
&gt; &gt; &gt; different kinds our resources to use for making interpretations, classified
&gt; &gt; &gt; according to their origin: the fixed ones and the acquired ones.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The fixed ones are those we are born with, are dictated by our genetic code,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and are traits we share with our fellow humans which have the same genetic

&gt; I am not suggesting intensifying our involvement with the details. It
&gt; can become limiting, even pitiful beyond a point.

&gt; It is to evolve along two dimensions : one, integrating the world or
&gt; non - self or the ' body ' view, arising out of our experience and
&gt; perception of it, to the bigger picture ending on the self; and, two,
&gt; differentiating the witness view of one's self while we are
&gt; experiencing or perceiving.

&gt; All of the above would be laborious and preparatory to attaining the
&gt; all - integrating quantum vision, beyond the body - rooted
&gt; identity ... into the identity with Being Infinite. This one is the
&gt; Herculean task. One has to gain the agility of awareness through which
&gt; one is not overtaken by the any experience whatsoever. For instance,
&gt; the breath overtakes us. Sex, too. Hunger, Dreams, ...  and Deep
&gt; Sleep.

&gt; Am I suggesting that therefore one should try to live without breath,
&gt; hunger, sex, dreams, deep sleep ... ? No. What I am suggesting is that
&gt; one should be able to witness it, to remain unmodified or
&gt; unconditioned by the ' fruits ' or effects of the experience or
&gt; perception, whatever it is.

&gt; I confess that the journey is arduous, long and, if you permit,
&gt; impossible. Despite that, my experience is that if one is focussed
&gt; enough, and keeps at it long enough, unmindful of the destructive
&gt; effects in the interim, because we are called upon to give up our
&gt; possession - rooted identity, desire -  and  pleasure - rooted
&gt; identity, thought -  and  knowledge - rooted identity ...   because
&gt; they are all finite and transient ...   then, in a manner of speaking,
&gt; the Being Infinite itself comes to choose to invite you to realise
&gt; that unity.

&gt; Of course, the path is not for everybody. Everybody wants to realise
&gt; and enjoy the ' fruits ' of life. Who wants to concern himself with
&gt; death ? Some of the writers and artists did in the past. Don't see
&gt; that happening in these times. I recall Albert Camus with an
&gt; overwhelming feeling of regard, in this context.

&gt; Perhaps, I wouldn't have shared this much with the Group at large. I
&gt; wouldn't have a reason to do that. But, you drew it out of me. You are
&gt; a freind, Pat. And that's always a blessing.

Cheers, mate!!  Always a pleasure to be of service.  And the
'drawing out' is reciprocal.  In reading what you wrote, it allowed
me, for a fleeting moment, to enjoy a bit of the bliss that comes from
only witnessing.  Is there a Sanskrit term for that, that is the
blissful freedom felt when one is only witnessing?  If not, I'd like
to suggest &quot;atmananda&quot;.  But, then, as I just wrote that, I was
wondering if I hadn't been witnessing myself witnessing.  And that
knowledge makes me want to change the word to &quot;atmajnananada&quot;.  Of
course, I may be overcomplicating things and perhaps ananda is
ananda.  Or, was it that bliss that shatters through the perceptions
and destroys, for a moment, the worldly image of ourselves we keep?
If so, then it could only have been Vamadevananda! ;-)
