Hi,

Just to let people know that I've now put up some webpages on Jim Sugden's
original Class A solid state power amps. You can find these via a new link
on the AudioMisc page (URL in my sig below).  :-)

I will add more pages on JES as and when I get a chance. Next to be added
will be pages on the Hi Fi News 'home constructor' version of the
amplifiers, and pages on the A41/A51 and their control (pre) amps.

Hope people find the pages of interest.

Slainte,

Jim

Definitely, thanks for those. Have to say that the biasing methods
have a very fragile look to them; Sugden definitely had a bee in his
bonnet about how an amplifier should work. Unfortunately for him it
wasn't long after all this that people started to suss how to make a
class B amp without the huge distortion rise at low level.

I'm a little surprised he didn't get as far as a long-tail pair for
the input. The technique was well enough known by then. Perhaps a
component count issue? Transistors cost a fortune back then; I can
remember my 30/- OC71.

Long sold now, but I posted these a while back:

http://patchoulian.googlepages.com/sugdenc51andp51

I've probably got some more photos, should you ever need them.

FWIW they were pretty good, and serviced/repaired by Sugden in 2004.

Well, it was the mid 1960s and the transistors available at the time were
poor (perhaps a better term would be 'rubbish' compared with nowdays), as
well as people not yet having really learned how to use bipolars in ways
we'd now regard as 'obvious' for giving best results. The bias
stabilisation diodes were a neat trick. These days we'd probable use
something more like a rubber zener, but I don't know when that first came
into use.

I've been told that the need to carefully match the diodes and resistors
into matched sets in boxes was a real PITA. Kept one 'girl' &lt;sic&gt; working
full time just on that.

Indeed. By about the mid 1970s the early problems had essentially been
sussed. The available power transistors were also much better. As a result
topologies like the 'triples' and the linearised versions of class AB were
in use. JES themselves slowly moved away from Class A into what was either
AB or more like 'high bias' than Class A. In fairness, though, in the days
when a BD121 was the state of the art it would be dubious if these more
familiar arrangements would have worked OK. And although we nowdays take
them as if they appeared in the year dot, they actually had to be invented.

When I get a chance to do the relevant pages, you should find the 'series
3' and later had arrangements that would be more familiar these days. TBH
the thing that makes my hair[1] stand on end with the early JES designs is
the a.c. coupling from one stage to another inside the feedback loop. Alas,
I don't have a circuit for the Si 402 so can only suspect it was similar to
the A21/A41 at present. I can't even determine yet if any were ever sold.
Hence my assumption at present that the Richard Allan amp was the first
Class A SS power amp to go on sale for domestic HiFi.

I found it quite interesting how the designs did evolve as he experimented
and learned. The change was quite rapid during the first couple of years.

I have been told that both Hacker radio and Uncle Clive argued about who
was first. But I've not found any contemporary documents on that as yet.
Found more well-known items by JLH, Williamson, etc, though.

Slainte,

Jim

You sent me PDF copies of the documents IIRC. However I'd welcome any good

Audio kindly sent to me. This includes things like Jim Sugden's original

** Only if they actually  ENJOY reading tedious, pseudo technical drivel.

Your page on the A21 is particularly loaded with fallacies and nonsense.

Gullible readers are being expected to believe that 1968 was some kind of
&quot;dark ages&quot; in SS amplifier history, that the available silicon transistors
were of highly inferior quality and designers were all still struggling with
the evil bogey of crossover distortion.

And that class A operation was the answer.

WHAT   BOLLOCKS  !!

Eg:

Quad released their famous 303 model way back in 1967  !!

In 1969 it won a Design Council Award.

The 303 delivered 45 watts per channel into 8 ohms loads.

It was short circuit safe.

It used all silicon transistors and exhibited no sign of crossover
distortion.

The power devices used were rugged planar types,  RCA 38494s and 40411s.

THD measured at the 1 watt level was circa 0.003% and less than 0.03 % at
rated power  -  ten times less at both levels than Sugden's woeful A21.

The 303 used regulated PSU and drove the &quot;difficult&quot; ESL57 with ease.

It ran cool with very low idle current in the output devices.

Compared to the Quad 303,   Sugden's A21 was a pile of junk.

It is  * NO *  surprise that a credible magazine like Wireless World failed
to mention its appearance at some 1968 audio fair.

Since it was clearly an embarrassment  !!
---------------------------------------------

BTW:

This French page has some good pics of the insides of a Quad 303.

http://cf.geocities.com/quadfranco/appareils/serie33/amp303.html

Here is a schematic of the 1970 version.

Yes thats the better one with the diode-less biasing arrangement. We

I'd suggest you actually listen to one - especially into a pair of ELS 57s.
It sounds a deal cleaner than a 303 - although obviously slightly down on

All from a failing ;-) memory as it was a long time ago.

A pal was a great ELS fan - but wasn't happy with the 303 as a replacement
for his Quad II amps. And experimented with what I think was a borrowed
A21. And liked the sound. Actually bought the later 25 watt one (A42?)
which he stuck with for a long long time - despite trying the 405 etc.
And demonstrated the various combinations with which I agreed with on his
conclusions.

You either have a poor or a very selective memory, Jimbo - or you
perhaps were wise enough not to read all the posts from a former
subscriber here (the Roseate One) who frequently made the claim (as he
slid further into what appeared to be an AV/can't be arsed with 'audio'
vegetative state) that all amplifiers did more or less sound the same
with the preconditions that they were 'good', solid state and cost 300
UKP or more.

Just that some/many may be

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's a different thing entirely - my view was always that the 'all
good amps sound the same' claim always depended on the other kit with
which they were/are being used. Interesting though, that the maggies
seem to lack no evidence to support their views that 'this amp' sounds
like this and 'that amp' sounds different on different material &amp;c. ??

No point in asking me that one, Iain. I can think of plenty amps that
don't sound 'the same'. Especially SET ones - hence their attraction to
those who aren't interested in an accurate sound but want something
'better'.

I also didn't agree with Allison's comment about the 303 never needing
adjustment.

No, it was clearly stated on more than one occasion that 'all ss
amplifiers sound the same' by the poster (obliquely) referred to above.
When I queried this, I was told 'all *good* ss amplifiers sound the
same'. When I further queried what constituted a 'good' amplifier, I was
told 'anything 300 quid or over' - or words very much to that effect.

(Actually, FWIW, I have no problem with that argument - AFAIAC they do.

Possibly, but I have seen the phrase 'Straw Man' misapplied to so many
arguments that I no longer take any notice of it.

From the Whacky Wiki:

&quot;A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation
of an opponent's position. To &quot;set up a straw man&quot; or &quot;set up a straw
man argument&quot; is to create a position that is easy to refute , then
attribute that position to the opponent. A straw man argument can be a
successful rhetorical technique (that is, it may succeed in persuading
people) but it is in fact a misleading fallacy, because the opponent's
actual argument has not been refuted.&quot;

Does not apply here with the 'all ss amps sound the same' claim - that
was stated quite clearly by at least one poster who was very Rosy and
not at all Straw...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; My recollection is that a more common claim was something like &quot;all
&gt;&gt; &lt;qualifiers&gt; amplifiers sound the same (or indistinguishable) under
&gt;&gt; &lt;specified&gt; conditions of use.&quot;. Many people have said, this, from PJW
&gt;&gt; onwards. Alas, it then seems to be routinely changed to remove all
&gt;&gt; the specifics/qualifiers by someone else who dislikes what was said
&gt;&gt; and who wants to argue.

&gt;&gt; I think this is the a version of the 'Straw Man' debate technique. :-)

&gt; Possibly, but I have seen the phrase 'Straw Man' misapplied to so many
&gt; arguments that I no longer take any notice of it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; From the Whacky Wiki:

&gt; &quot;A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of
&gt; an opponent's position. To &quot;set up a straw man&quot; or &quot;set up a straw man
&gt; argument&quot; is to create a position that is easy to refute , then attribute
&gt; that position to the opponent. A straw man argument can be a successful
&gt; rhetorical technique (that is, it may succeed in persuading people) but it
&gt; is in fact a misleading fallacy, because the opponent's actual argument
&gt; has not been refuted.&quot;

&gt; Does not apply here with the 'all ss amps sound the same' claim

I'm afraid I must shoulder some of the blame. It's my contention that
they don't sound the same - far from it.

A couple of people had the patience to explain that most SS amplifiers
built nowadays simply do sound the same to all intents and purposes given:

* a reasonable set of operating parameters, principally relating to
speakers;
* a certain specification, which most off the shelf integrated
amplifiers meet.

Serge (and you) guided me through the whole thing, but I became lost at
a crucial point of measurement (you measure the electrical
specification, I wanted to measure the sound; you said they were the
same thing; I said they might not), and left it at that. I can't get to
grips with google's newsgroup search, but here's a bit of the thread,
from Serge's contribution:

&quot;Price of the amplifier isn't important. It is well recognised, at least
amongst audio professionals, that the ear's ability to hear differences has
a lower threshold. If an amplifier's performance is below that threshold,
then all differences between such amplifiers is not audible.&quot;

&gt; I think this is the a version of the 'Straw Man' debate technique. :-)

&gt; say if they'd have objected to what I wrote. But if you can give specifics
&gt; I can check.  :-)

Jim.  Could your lapse of memory be a parallel of your not remembering
the very same poster claiming that all vinyl rolled of at 12kHz?
I was amazed that you said nothing.

But in the great scheme of things it is not important.  Only
horticulture is important, and even that is not very important:-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Interesting observations. Thanks Dave. But how can that be reconciled
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the all amplifiers sound the same argument?  :-)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've not tried the A21 in any version, nor can I recall anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claiming that, &quot;All amplifiers sound the same&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You either have a poor or a very selective memory, Jimbo - or you
&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps were wise enough not to read all the posts from a former
&gt;&gt;&gt; subscriber here (the Roseate One) who frequently made the claim (as he
&gt;&gt;&gt; slid further into what appeared to be an AV/can't be arsed with 'audio'
&gt;&gt;&gt; vegetative state) that all amplifiers did more or less sound the same
&gt;&gt;&gt; with the preconditions that they were 'good', solid state and cost 300
&gt;&gt;&gt; UKP or more.

&gt;&gt; Well, perhaps it was sometimes claimed by one poster in a message that
&gt;&gt; *someone else* had said &quot;All amplifiers sound the same&quot;.

&gt;&gt; But I can't recall anyone making such a statement with no qualifiers. If
&gt;&gt; you can, perhaps you can post the details of who, when, etc. - i.e. give
&gt;&gt; the date, time, title, etc, of the posting, and the full wording.

&gt; I'm afraid I must shoulder some of the blame. It's my contention that they
&gt; don't sound the same - far from it.

&gt; A couple of people had the patience to explain that most SS amplifiers
&gt; built nowadays simply do sound the same to all intents and purposes given:

&gt; * a reasonable set of operating parameters, principally relating to
&gt; speakers;
&gt; * a certain specification, which most off the shelf integrated amplifiers
&gt; meet.

&gt; Serge (and you) guided me through the whole thing, but I became lost at a
&gt; crucial point of measurement (you measure the electrical specification, I
&gt; wanted to measure the sound; you said they were the same thing; I said
&gt; they might not), and left it at that. I can't get to grips with google's
&gt; newsgroup search, but here's a bit of the thread, from Serge's
&gt; contribution:

&gt; &quot;Price of the amplifier isn't important. It is well recognised, at least
&gt; amongst audio professionals, that the ear's ability to hear differences
&gt; has
&gt; a lower threshold. If an amplifier's performance is below that threshold,
&gt; then all differences between such amplifiers is not audible.&quot;

&gt; http://groups.google.co.uk/group/uk.rec.audio/browse_thread/thread/11...
">

It's a timely reminder that whatever the measured differencs between
equipment, if even the worse of them measures below the threshold of hearing
for that particular parameter (e.g. THD &lt;0.1%, frequency response +- 0.5dB
20-20kHz, 1kHz level matching to 0.5dB etc etc) then no matter how much
better one device is over another, they will both sound the same.

Two amplifiers with no qualification could well sound different into any
particular loudspeaker load, but if then you carry out the measurements,
there is always a measureable reason for the difference. As has been
previously suggested, the Sugden's higher output impedance could well result
in an altered frequency response into an ESL load compared with the 303.
It's that altered frequency response that's audible, not any intrinsic
difference between amplifiers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *someone else* had said &quot;All amplifiers sound the same&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it was clearly stated on more than one occasion that 'all ss
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amplifiers sound the same' by the poster (obliquely) referred to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; above.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If it happened so many times, then it should be easy to come up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with a quote from google.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I just did a search, and even after going back 10 years, I find no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such claims except as debating topics as opposed to actual claims.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When I queried this, I was told 'all *good* ss amplifiers sound
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the same'. When I further queried what constituted a 'good'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amplifier, I was told 'anything 300 quid or over' - or words very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much to that effect.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Prove it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, you prove it - start here:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://groups.google.co.uk/group/uk.rec.audio/search?q=amps+sound+the...

&gt;&gt;&gt; Been there, done that. Things are as I said, above.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You know Keith, you're one arrogant POS if you think that you're the
&gt;&gt;&gt; only person around here who can come up with relevant retrievals
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Google.

&gt;&gt; Not half as arrogant as you, if you think that just because I lead
&gt;&gt; you to something by the nose that I consider *anybody* else here
&gt;&gt; needs leading similarly....

&gt; Sorry Keith, but that ponderous  run-on is just too convoluted for my
&gt; limited mind to extract a unique sensible meaning from.
">

No need to apologise, if you need it simplified just say so - try this:

It is even more arrogant of you to presume that just because I give
*you* a link I would need to for anyone else...

Does that help?

I am not sure what 'blame' you are taking onto yourself. What you write
above is consistent with what I was saying. i.e. That you may have
initially thought someone was claiming that &quot;All amplifiers sound the
same&quot;, but it was then pointed out that the statements were qualified along
the lines I have indicated.

I've not checked, but I am not sure I would have said that they were the
&quot;same thing&quot;.

I may have pointed out that the amplifier deals with input and output
voltage (and current) patterns. i.e. electronic signal patterns. Not sound.

From which it follows that if two amplifier give the same electrical output
from the same input, then they should be indistinguishable in terms of what
emerges from the speakers.

(An exception being if one amp nechanically 'buzzes' or 'hums' so giving
an audible unwanted sound.)

IIRC One of the points being discussed was that you can use the electrical
signal levels at the loudspeaker inputs to check that the two amps are
being used to give similar sound volume levels with a given speaker.

You need to do this when trying to compare because if one system plays a
bit louder than the other, then they may sound 'different' for that reason
even when the amps are otherwise identical. Much easer to check the levels
are the same at the loudspeaker input than by trying to measure the sound
pressure level in the room.

Of course, if you keep changing the speaker, or its location, then this
will cause the results to change regardless of choice of amplifier.
Ditto for listening position in the room, etc. This illstrates one of the
various problems that afflict those who try to judge by sound in an
uncontrolled comparison. There are simply too many factors that can
affect that results which have nothing to do with the amplifier.

Slainte,

Jim

I don't think it is quite a simple as the old A21 having a higher output
impedance.

The complications are that the A21 has a different size output cap, and no
output series inductor. Also note where the A21 (original) has the feedback
from the *output* side of the coupling capacitor. As with the old Armstrong
600 amp, taking the feedback from that side has a significant effect on the
output impedance at low frequency, as well as on the LF distortion to some
extent. (The 600 could actually have a *negative* output impedance in an LF
band due to this and its dual feedback arrangement. Although this varied in
production as I altered some of the component values, etc.)

FWIW I'd expect the A21 to tend to have a *lower* output impedance at LF
and HF than the 303 - although this depends on the open loop gain to some
extent so I can't be sure. I don't have sufficiently detailed info on the
A21 as yet, but hope to soon.  :-)

Slainte,

Jim

&gt; &gt; Indeed. A point that has been made countless times in the past. And so
&gt; &gt; far as I recall, not contested by anyone who made the qualified claim
&gt; &gt; I give above. Since I can't recall anyone making the unqualified
&gt; &gt; claim, I can't say if they'd have objected to what I wrote. But if you
&gt; &gt; can give specifics I can check.  :-)

&gt; Jim.  Could your lapse of memory be a parallel of your not remembering
&gt; the very same poster claiming that all vinyl rolled of at 12kHz? I was
&gt; amazed that you said nothing.
">

Maybe. Afraid I can't recall that, either. I am aware that the max possible
level tends to fall at HF, but the details will depend on how the disc was
cut and is replayed.

That said, I am currently getting some interesting results from analysing
the details of the modulation patterns on some LPs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But in the great scheme of things it is not important.  Only

At present I am mainly trying to keep up with basics like watering,
weeding, etc. Not been any decent rain here for some time.

However the good news is that I am in the process of getting a large batch
of 1950s and 1960s HFN mags. These should put a dent in the time I have for
gardening once they arrive!  Thousands of pages of new reference info.  ;-&gt;

BTW Judging by the webstats, the Sugden pages are proving very popular.
This encourages me to add more info when I can.
