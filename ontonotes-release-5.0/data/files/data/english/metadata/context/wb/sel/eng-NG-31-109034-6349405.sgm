WI the tariff issue escalated to secession of South Carolina in the
1830s?

Would South Carolina have any allies? My understanding is that anti-
tariff sentiments were pretty strong in Virginia and Georgia as well,
but not in places like Tennessee.

So, would we see South Carolina seceding with no allies, or the
tidewater confederacy of Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas, or would
we have more of the south-central states join in secession as well?

I see Jackson being utterly determined to crush secession.

On foreign attitudes- I imagine Jackson would be considered a brute.
Since Jackson is likely able to suppress secession without any desire
or need for emancipation, the federals won't get any international
sympathy on that score. Some northern abolitionists will be pacifist.
At the same time, I don't see any foreign country thinking the
secessionists have a chance or seeing it in their interests to
intervene on their side.

In OTL's civil war, many saw the war as a test of republican
government, with reactionaries hoping the US would fail, and radicals
hoping it would succeed. In the ATL, would this still be the case, or
would the suppression of the 1830s secession be taken as simply
signifying a republic can be just as bloodthirsty as a monarchy.

I would take Jackson at his word on capital punishment for
secessionist leaders.

How will things shake out for the remainder of the 19th century with
regard to the political influence of the various sections, the slavery/
abolition issue and future US expansion.

One additional issue, might Carolinian or other secessionist refugees
move to the Texas republic or take part in its independence struggle?

Most of the South was anti-tariff (though Tennessee less so than other
states and Louisiana in favor of protecting sugar) but there is a big
difference between supporting lower tariffs (which Jackson himself did)
and supporting either nullification or secession.  See
http://www.datasync.com/~jtaylor/Nullif.htm on the situation in
Mississippi where

"This part of the governor's message, and the resolutions from the States
of Maine, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania on the same subject, were
referred to a select committee of the house of representatives of which
Adam L. Bingaman, an influential Whig, of Natchez, was chairman. This
committee, in its report, declared their belief that the sentiments of the
majority of the people of the States towards a protective tariff were
still in accord with those expressed by the general assembly in 1829. But
the committee expressed themselves as opposed to nullification and as
regarding it as a heresy fatal to the existence of the Union, and
expressed the opinion that the State of South Carolina had acted with a
reckless precipitancy. The committee deplored the alarming crisis in
national affairs and regretted it the more as proceeding from the
unwarrantable attitude assumed by a sister of the South whose best
interests were identical with those of their own State. In the spirit of
members of the same family, they invoked the people of South Carolina to
pause and hearken attentively 'to the paternal, yet ominous warning of the
Executive of the Union' and conjured them to await patiently the gradual
progress of public opinion, and to rely, with patriotic confidence, on the
ultimate decision of congress.

"The committee also proclaimed that Mississippi owed a duty to the Union
above all minor considerations and that she prized the Union less than
liberty alone; and asserted that they were heartily in accord with the
general political sentiments of the president of the United States as
expressed in his recent proclamation, and that they stood firmly resolved,
'at whatever sacrifice of feeling, in all events, and at every hazard to
sustain him in enforcing the paramount laws of the land and preserving the
integrity of the Union--that Union, whose value we wilt never stop to
calculate--holding it, as our fathers held it, precious above all price.'

"The committee reported for adoption three resolutions. The first
condemned secession by declaring 'that, in the language of the father of
his country, we will indignantly frown upon the first dawning of every
attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to
enfeeble the ties which link together its various parts' The doctrine of
nullification was condemned in the second resolution as 'contrary to the
letter and spirit of the Constitution, and in direct conflict with the
welfare, safety and independence of every State in the Union.' 'To no one
of them,' it was added, 'would its consequences be more deeply disastrous,
more ruinous, than to the State of Mississippi.' In the last resolution,
the legislature declared that, 'We will, with heart and hand, sustain the
president of the United States in the full exercise of his legitimate
powers, to restore peace and harmony to our distracted country, and to
maintain, unsullied and unimpaired, the honor, the independence and
integrity of the Union.' These resolutions passed the house by a vote of
30 to 3 and were in due time passed by the senate and transmitted to the
other States. .

"The replies of the other co-States to the call of South Carolina for a
convention were as little reasuring as that of Mississippi. All condemned
the course of South Carolina, and a large majority also expressed their
approval of the proclamation of the president. But Georgia and Alabama
joined with South Carolina in recommending a general convention of all the
States..."

Naturally, this view was not unanimously held in Mississippi--there was a
Sates Rights party led by Quitman but it is clear from the election
results that it was in the minority.  The Democratic Party of Mississippi
unequivocally denied the rights of both nullification and secession.  It
resolved that

"The doctrines of nullification, as declared in South Carolina, and
industriously attempted to be propagated in this and other States, are
repugnant to the vital principles of our political system, equally absurd
in theory and dangerous in practice; the extension, adoption and
enforcement of which must inevitably terminate in anarchy or civil war;
* * * that the constitutional right of secession from the Union, on the
part of a single State, as asserted by the nullifying leaders in South
Carolina, is utterly unsanctioned by the federal constitution, which was
framed to 'establish,' and not to destroy the Union of the States; and
that no secession can in fact take place without a subversion of the Union
established, and which will not virtually amount in the effects and
consequences, to a civil revolution."

Question: did 1820s Mississippi (and the other Southern states)
have the "Upper South Paradox"? During the OTL American Civil
War, Virginia and North Carolina were opposed to secession over
Abe Lincoln's election -- but they could not abide the "wicked
suppression of out sister Southern states," and seceded over that.
If Jackson actually sends in the troops and there's real fighting,
would the Mississippi legislature change its mind and feel that
the tariff wasn't worth a fight, but South Carolina was?

For that matter, if Clay can't come up with a compromise, how
likely is South Carolina to back down? When they see no other
Southern state helps them, do they give in? Or do they gamble
that Mississippi will have a change of heart once there's real
shooting?

There are a few differences.  First of all, by 1861, most Upper
Southerners believed in the right of secession, though believing that
South Carolina was rash in exercising it.  As noted, in the 1830's
Mississippi categorically rejected any such right.  Second, in 1833 the
White House was occupied by a slaveholder (and Indian-remover) who had
gotten the overwhelming majority of Southern votes in 1832; in 1861 it was
occupied by a man who had gotten no votes at all in ten Southern states.
Third, slavery was a much more emotional and unifying issue in the South
than the tariff. [1] Of course these three differences are not unrelated--
a decade of slavery controversy culminating in the rise of the Republican
party to power evidently convinced many Southerners of the acceptability
of secession (even if they did not yet desire it for their own state) who
had not been so convinced as late as 1850.

It does seem to me likely that *some* sort of compromise will be reached
to give the South Carolinians at least a fig leaf for abandoning
nullification.  If that does not happen, though, I can see South
Carolinians taking the gamble you speak of (though Calhoun, who sincerely
seems to have favored nullification as a way of avoiding secession, not of
accomplishing it, will probably urge caution).  And they will not be
wholly wrong:  they will get *some* support from the rest of the South
(especially since many of the Southerners who denounced South Carolina in
1833 did so on the assumption that a compromise on the tariff was
possible, and a display of extreme stubbornness by Northern protectionists
might in some cases change their minds) but much, much less than in 1861.

In OTL, the compromise reached in 1833 was quite satisfactory even to some
protectionists because the bulk of the reductions would not take effect
for many years.  And indeed when on July 1, 1842 the rates finally went
down to the 20% target, it turned out that this "final" figure didn't even
last out the year!  A Whig majority raised the rates again that year [2],
and President Tyler signed the bill (one of the few pieces of the Whig
economic program Tyler *didn't* veto--the federal govermnment needed
revenue too badly for him to do so in this instance).  So in the end,
Henry Clay, "the Great Compromiser" turned out not even to have
compromised that much.

[1] The South Carolinian nullifiers did argue that nullification was a
bulwark against abolition as well as the tariff, that the same doctrines
that allowed a protective tariff would allow the federal government to
take action against slavery, etc.  See
http://groups.google.com/group/soc.history.what-if/msg/5e43a9e075f51671
for quotes to this effect. But this argument does not seem to have won
much acceptnce outside South Carolina.

[2] There were some defections from Southern Whigs, but they were made up
for by the solid support of Pennsylvania Democrats.

Long before 1860, the Upper South was riddled with
noisy secessionists. They were a minority, but...
the slaveholding elite in those states was as bound
to slavery as in the Deep South. Once the shooting
started - once Deep South secession was apparently
irrevocable - the Upper South would declare secession
too.

In January 1861, the VA legislature resolved that if
"the present differences are not satisfactorily
resolved, Virginia would join her sister slaveholding
states."  IOW, unless the slavery issues are settled
such that the Deep South states rescind secession,
Virginia is going out too.

Many Upper Southerners had the delusion that faced
with actual secession, the Republicans would cave
in and agree to all the South's demands on slavery,
which of course were absolutely just and
constitutional, and that the Deep South would
accept this surrender and rescind secession.

This ignored the fact that Republicans, especially
Lincoln "meant what they said, and said what they
meant", and the fact that the Deep South states
were now controlled by men who had been preaching
secession for years, and had no intent of giving
it up under any circumstances.

The subsequent ranting about "coercion" was mostly
a shuck to cover the fact that they were declaring
secession over slavery. Most Upper Southerners were
uncomfortable with the open advocacy of slavery
found in the Deep South.

What interest would Virginia have in staying in a
Union with only 8 slave states, where the Presidency
and Congress were controlled by antislavery forces?

The VA secession convention voted 90-45 against
secession when first convened; the final vote was
88-55 in favor. So only 43 of about 155 members
changed their votes. The majority of voters for
secession were not affected by "coercion".
