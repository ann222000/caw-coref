If memory serves, I believe the reverse-the-curse World Series win was
also a Superbowl win year for my beloven New England Patriots.

It'd be nice to have the trifecta, so to speak, with the Bruins &amp; Celts
bringing some some shiney metal object.

Yeah; that'll be happening!

On a side note, I got a preview of the World Series four months in advance.
Boston beat the Rockies 2-1 when I went to Fenway in June.

And, just to be a real prick, when there's 1 minute left in the game and
we're ahead by 20-something points, rather than take a knee, we'll
g'head and ram another TD down their throats.

Wear snowshoes if you go to Coors Field.   Snowed last night.   If
Breckenridge
had that much snow I'd be hopping a plane to go skiing now.

Da Sawx better win those first two at Fenway. The Patriots are quite
comfortable playing in the snow in January. But these baseball players
aren't called the boys of summer for nuttin'. They all reside in the
south during the winter months. Manny Ramirez ain't shovellin' no
driveways, dig?

If it ever dropped below 40 at the Fens Manny would probably duck into
the monster, take a piss in a styrofoam cup and wait till spring.

On a side note, I drove my son &amp; his friend to a concert at a place
called Avalon Ballroom, right across the street from Fenway. This was
about two weeks after they won the series in 04. They had dug up the
field and were putting in a new drainage system, so there were huge
piles of sand, big trenches &amp; pipes sticking up out of the ground
everywhere. All the side entrances were wide open and one of the
security guys let me walk in and take a quick look, that was my first
and only time in Fenway Park. The amazing thing is how small that place
actually is. It looks huge on TV but it's amazingly small.

I was there once in 1978 before they built that big box behind the plate
and added the upper seating. It was like a friggin' minor league park
back then.

and that's the other amazing thing is that every year they find some new
place to put more seats. The ones that amazed me were the new seats on
top of the green monster. I mean the green monster is a brick wall and
nothing else. The green monster seats are basically a couple sections of
standard bleechers perched on top of the brick wall and hanging out over
the sidewalk on Landsdowne St with a few structural arms leaning out and
holding the whole deal up. Personally, you won't catch me up there. Now
the seat I would love to have is the one owned by Dennis Drinkwater,
president of Giant Glass, a major sponsor of the Sawx. For his
sponsorship, he gets a prime seat right behind home plate. This whole
season, I think he's missed maybe a half dozen games. Every night you
turn on the game and there he is.
