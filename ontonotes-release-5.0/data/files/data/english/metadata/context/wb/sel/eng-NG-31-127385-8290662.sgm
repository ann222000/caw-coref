Dr. Nigel Calder, co-author with physicist Henrik Svensmark of the 2007 book
&quot;The Chilling Stars: A New Theory on Climate Change,&quot; explained in July 2007:
(LINK)

&quot;In reality, global temperatures have stopped rising.  Data for both the surface
and the lower air show no warming since 1999.  That makes no sense by the
hypothesis of global warming driven mainly by CO2, because the amount of CO2 in
the air has gone on increasing.  But the fact that the Sun is beginning to
neglect its climatic duty - of battling away the cosmic rays that come from 'the
chilling stars' - fits beautifully with this apparent end of global warming.&quot;

Of course, the El Nino effect was at its peak in 1998, making this a

This is striclty a regional phenomenon and would have little effect on global
temps.

Looking at the graph there are only two short bursts of warming, 1910-1940 and
1975-1998.
The rest of the graph shows global cooling.

Only just.
One anomalous year in a 10 year plateauing which is, in fact a slight cooling.
A precursor to the coming majort cooling trend.

Hey Fran, I have the utmost confidence that you can keep this a secret, so here
goes ...

Now it's the 1930s that are heating

By Andrew Bolt

Thursday, August 09, 2007 at 10:02am

Oops. It turns out that 1998 wasn't the hottest year on record for the US, after
all.

Global warming must be working backwards, because NASA's Goddard Institute for
Space Studies, having fixed some calculating errors, has discovered that the
hottest year was in fact 1934.

That's not all, as Steve McIntyre explains:

Four of the top 10 are now from the 1930s: 1934, 1931, 1938 and 1939, while only
3 of the top 10 are from the last 10 years (1998, 2006, 1999). Several years
(2000, 2002, 2003, 2004) fell well down the leaderboard, behind even 1900.

The new leader-board of the hottest recorded years in the US:

1934

1998

1921

2006

1931

1999

1953

1990

1938

1939

These figures apply only to the US, and the corrections - says McIntyre - do
&quot;not make any real difference to the world rankings&quot;, which generally put 1998
as the world's hottest year since records were kept.

But two things should be noted.

First, that the most basic calculations behind the global warming hysteria can
be screwed up, and stay undetected for years.

Second, that NASA quietly changed these figures without any of the press
releases and alarmist reports that usually follow the discovery of some data
that will feed the fear.

Global Land Temperatures Warmest Ever in January, April

GENEVA, Switzerland, August 8, 2007 (ENS) - Global land surface
temperatures for January and April will likely be ranked as the
warmest since recordkeeping began in 1880, the United Nations World
Meteorological Organization reported Tuesday.

&quot;Weather and climate are marked by record extremes in many regions
across the world since January 2007,&quot; the WMO said.

...

Global temperatures were 1.89°Celsius (3.4°Fahrenheit) warmer than
average for January and 1.37°C (2.46°F) warmer than average for
April.

...

Among the latest extremes, the WMO cited four monsoon depressions,
double the normal number, which caused heavy floods in India, Pakistan
and Bangladesh, killing more than 500 people, displacing over 10
million others and destroying vast areas of croplands, livestock and
property.

A series of huge swells with waves more than 20 feet high swamped 68
islands in the Indian Ocean island nation of Maldives in May.

The first cyclone ever documented in the Arabian Sea struck Oman and
Iran in early June.

Other extremes included a powerful storm system in much of northern
Europe in January; and in England and Wales the period from May to
July was the wettest since recordkeeping began in 1766.

Elsewhere in Europe, extreme record-breaking heat waves hit
southeastern Europe in June and July; and a heat wave swept across
western and central Russia in May, breaking several records.

...

In the southern hemisphere, an unusually cold southern winter brought
winds, blizzards and rare snowfall to various parts of South America
in July.

In June, South Africa experienced its first major snowfall since
1981.

In the northern hemisphere, by contrast, many European countries had
their warmest January on record.

The Netherlands reported the highest temperature since measurements
were first taken in 1706, averaging about 7.1°C (44.78°F).

This temperature is 2.8°C (5°F) above the 1961-1990 average.

In Germany, the temperatures in January soared even higher, averaging
4.6°C (8.2°F) above the 1961-1990 average.

An increase in intense tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic
since about 1970 has also been observed.

# Ecological disaster looms, as The Human Plague chomps away at its life
support.  Latest news is that the Yangtse River dolphin is now extinct.  Who
cares?  Doesn't affect you and me, or does it?  Make enough species extinct,
and soon enough it will be our turn.
According to TV last night, the Phillip Island's fairy penguins have been
electronically tagged and tracked at sea - they come around into Port
Phillip Bay to feed.  So what?  Just that if the deep channel dredging goes
ahead, the sand stirred up may obscure the penguins' vision, with unforeseen
consequences.  Maybe decimation of the species....?
Yeah, by 2050 AD, Homo Sapiens may be extinct, and only urgent action can
avoid such fate.  Or is it already too late?
Beijing Olympics anyone?  Take your smog mask!

Global Land Temperatures Warmest Ever in January, April

Yes, but if you look at the rest of the year,  they are nowhere near being all
time records
One anomalous month does not a trend make!

2007.04      1.10       .88
2007.12       .80       .63
2007.21       .73       .59

2007.46       .67       .54
2007.54       .57       .49
Actually it looks very much like a cooling trend!
Keep pulling with your agenda baby!

BTW, why does the record start in 1997?
I would be interested to see it for earlier years.

In a 1996 report by the UN on global warming, two statements were deleted from
the final draft. Here they are:
1. &quot;None of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can
attribute  the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases.&quot;
2. &quot;No study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change
to man-made causes&quot;

thaw Pronunciation (thô)
v. thawed, thaw·ing, thaws
v.intr.
1. To change from a frozen solid to a liquid by gradual warming.
2. To lose stiffness, numbness, or impermeability by being warmed.

does not the second definition fit the possible outcome?

#  Purely my estimate.  If they can't see to catch pilchards or whatever,
then many may die of starvation.  The survivors would be those who can feed
solely, or mainly, on oceanic stock.
Just goes to show that in the chain-of-events, we can't altogether
predict the consequences of our environmental impact.
Meanwhile, human society tends to be dominated by the more ignorant -
bosses, unionists, and religionists.  Science tends to be complicated,
tentative, and sceptical; which makes it look hesitant and weak.  By the
time all the facts are in, we're dead.

You should be so lucky to know what I know about the

You are the typical leftist, mean, bitter, and pessimistic,
only you are more deceptive than most.

Those gullible people that you jerks are leading into
confusion and frustration will soon see what your game is.

The very fact that you associate any adversity to the Al

reveals your political agenda.

If opposition to leftists has to be called &quot;right wing&quot;,
then there are a lot of &quot;right wingers&quot;, because the percentage of

Aircraft Document Decline Of Arctic Ice Cover

Aircraft Document Decline Of Arctic Ice Cover
Science Daily - Central Europe is not the only place where the past,
warm
winter has caused record temperatures. Unusually mild temperatures
also
prevented ice formation in the Arctic, specifically in the region
around
Spitsbergen.

Thin ice cover at Storfjord, Spitsbergen, in March 2007. (Credit:
Christoph Lüpkes, Alfred Wegener Institute)Ads by GoogleAdvertise on

This is the conclusion drawn by scientists of the Alfred Wegener
Institute
for Polar and Marine Research and the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).
Both
institutes are members of the Helmholtz Association of German research
centres. They aim to span the Helmholtz-network to observe
environmental
changes. Measurement activities of the recent expedition were part of
the
project ICESAR, and accomplished in collaboration with the European
Space
Agency (ESA).

Arctic sea ice plays an important role in climate change. The decline
of
average sea ice cover, observed over the past years, means that sea
ice
reflects progressively less solar energy back into space, causing
temperatures in the Arctic to rise further. Usually, large areas of
Spitsbergen are surrounded by ice at the end of the winter, and the
fjords
are frozen. &quot;This year, our aircraft had to fly all the way to the
limits
of their range in order to collect sufficient data above the sea ice&quot;,
explains Dr Jörg Hartmann, climate scientist at the Alfred Wegener
Institute. The recently published UN climate report highlights warming
of
the Arctic as one of the four key issues in relation to global climate
change.

The goals of ICESAR include improvements of sea ice observations
facilitated by satellite radar, as well as better predictions for
weather
and climate models. The research campaign provided data for the
technical
alignment of ESA satellite Sentinel 1, because one of its radar
systems
will take up observation of Arctic ice cover in 2011. The research
aircraft Polar 2, operated by the Alfred Wegener Institute, is
equipped
with various meteorological instruments and camera systems. During a
recording flight, Polar 2 travels at low altitude while,
simultaneously,
another research aircraft of the DLR covers the same trajectory three
kilometres higher, surveying the ice with an imaging radar system. The
data collected by this method will provide the basis for a procedure
using
satellite images for ice data assembly.

ICESCAR represents a campaign within the context of the International
Polar Year and is funded by the ESA.

I took it as trying to focus on words and completely losing sight of
what actually __happens__.

There's a nice parable of sorts on this subject in &quot;The Beat of a
Different Drum,&quot; by Jagdish Mehra.  It's a biography on Richard
Feynman and one of the better on any scientist I've read.  It includes
a great deal of the equations and their discussions and that adds so
much excellent value to the book for me.  But the parable is from
Feynman's recollection of his boyhood with his father.  It runs
something like this:

---

In the summer the Feynmans would take their vacations in the Catskill
mountains.  There would be a large group of people there, but the
fathers would all go back to New York to work during the week and only
come back again over the weekend.  'On weekends, when my father came,'
recalled Richard, 'he would take me for walks in the woods.  When the
other mothers saw this, they thought it was wonderful and that the
other fathers should take their sons for walks.  They tried to work on
them but they did not get anywhere, at first.  They wanted my father
to take all the kids, but he didn't want to because he had a special
relationship with me.  So it ended up that the other fathers had to
take their children for walks the next weekend.

'The next Monday, when the fathers were back at work, we kids were
playing in a field.  One kid said to me, &quot;See that bird?  What kind of
bird is that?&quot;  I said, &quot;I haven't the slightest idea what kind of
bird it is.&quot;  He says, &quot;It's a brown-throated thrush.  Your father
does not teach you anything!&quot;

'But it was the opposite.  He had already taught me: &quot;See that bird?
It's a Spencer's warbler.&quot;  (I knew he didn't know the real name.)
&quot;well, in Italian it's Chutto Lapittida.  In Portuguese, it is Bom da
Peida.  In Chinese, it's Chung-long-tah, and in Japanese it is Katano
Tekeda.  You can know the name of that bird in all the languages in
the world, but when you are finished, you'll know absolutely nothing
whatever about the world.  You'll know about the humans in different
places, and what they call the bird.  So let's look at the bird and
see what it is doing -- that's what counts.&quot;  I learned very early
from my father the difference between knowing the name of something
and knowing something.'

Feynman explained, 'My father understood that knowledge was different
from the names of things.  The names of things are only a convention
that human beings use to discuss things, and of course that is
important.  But when he would tell me about looking at the birds, it
was not just to look at them but to see what they were doing.  As an
example, he said, &quot;Look, see the birds walking around there.  They
seem to be pecking their feathers all the time.  Why do you think they
do that?&quot;  And I said, &quot;Well, I don't know.&quot;  I was a kid of ten or
eleven.  I said, &quot;Maybe their feathers get ruffled when they are
flying.&quot;  I made an attempt at an explanation.  He then said, &quot;If that
were the case, they would peck more when they just landed after they
flew.  And after they got straightened out, walking around, they
wouldn't peck so much.  So let's see, watch those that land and then
see how long they go on pecking and whether or not they peck in their
feathers at the same rate.&quot;  After a while we discovered that indeed
they did.  So it was not due to a need to straighten out their
feathers just after flying.  You see, he had made a little experiment,
learning how to observe and discuss.'

The point is that what counts is what is actually going on, not the
names we use for things.  Getting lost in some wrangling over the word
'thaw' and who may win some debate about the definition helps no one
to understand methane clathrate and the response to temperature of
trapped (not frozen) CH4 within the H2O ice ring.

Philosophy is written in this grand book - I mean the universe -
which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be
understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and
interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in
the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles,
circles, and other geometric figures, without which it is humanly
impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one
is wandering about in a dark labyrinth.  [Galileo, in The Assayer]
