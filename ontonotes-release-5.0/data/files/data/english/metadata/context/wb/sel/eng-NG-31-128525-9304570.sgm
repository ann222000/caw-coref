&gt; November 14, 2006 -- THE searing question of whether Heather Mills McCartney
&gt; was once a high-priced hooker for wealthy Arab clients has been put to the
&gt; very man who is accused of hiring her in the first place - and he's not
&gt; denying it.

&gt; Earlier this year, London's News of the World claimed that Mills, embroiled
&gt; in a nasty split from Paul McCartney, once worked as a prostitute for rich
&gt; and powerful clients including reputed arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi - an
&gt; allegation she has denied while admitting she did meet Khashoggi at a party.

&gt; Now, celebrity interviewer Daphne Barak has landed a sit-down with Khashoggi
&gt; in which she asks whether he employed Mills for sex acts. &quot;Was Heather Mills
&gt; paid for sex - or wasn't she?&quot; Barak asks on a short teaser clip from the
&gt; interview available on her Web site, daphnebarak.com, which has been viewed
&gt; by Page Six and will be released next week.

&gt; &quot;Who cares?&quot; answers Khashoggi, who then giggles and gives Barak a sort of
&gt; &quot;high-five&quot; handshake.

&gt; According to Britain's Mail on Sunday, Khashoggi, who is shown in the
&gt; interview tape admiring photos of the scantily clad former model, goes on to
&gt; say: &quot;How does she know names, places, if she wasn't one of the girls? Maybe
&gt; if she says she came to my party, she came.&quot;

&gt; The Khashoggi interview comes on the heels of a report that McCartney - who
&gt; was promoting his new CD in Times Square yesterday - has offered Mills a
&gt; settlement worth nearly $190 million, if she agrees to grant him custody of
&gt; their 3-year-daughter, Beatrice.

&gt; Meanwhile, McCartney's supporters say one of Mills' charges against the
&gt; ex-Beatle is disturbingly similar to what happened to her mother. As The
&gt; Post previously reported, Mills says in her divorce petition that McCartney
&gt; shoved her into a bathtub in May 2003 - a charge McCartney denies. Now her
&gt; stepdad tells London's Daily Mail that Mills' mom once told him her own
&gt; ex-husband had pushed her into a bath. &quot;Heather is simply a very confused
&gt; woman for whom reality and fantasy have become blurred,&quot; Charles Stapley
&gt; said.
">

The just one more whore amongst many in the USA....they are all out
for money.
190,000  geez how much money that fucker got? I mean when does it
become pointless  lol

So her Mom told this story she had been pushed
into a bathtub and decades later her mind
regurgitated the scenario to accuse Paul?

She has claimed she has been suicidal.
This would likely DOOM her chances to get child custody right?

I'm confused about how the coin toss to decide which parent
got visitation for Christmas was abusive.
Doesn't that show there is no favoritism whatsoever?
Don't sports referees sometimes do a coin toss for
exactly the same reason, to show no bias?

If it was deciding a CASE, it would be horrible, but
since it was deciding equally between two parents
about visitation, and since visits after that would
presumeably alternate for Christmas, isn't this
coin toss an OK thing?

The pants thing should have been the issue.
If the Judge knew the woman had a history of
self harm then the woman should not get
custody of kids regardless of what's in her pants.

Yes, you are right, the coin toss was fair. Its because
the judge was fair to a *man* that the WomenFirster Bigot is
complaining about it.

Heather Mills is Paul McCartney's ex-wife.  They got together when
Paul was grieving for Linda, and he said she was all supportive of him
and helped him get over her.  I'll bet she was and I'll bet she did.
The marriage lasted about 18 months.  And now she wants her money.
Well, HIS money.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, she is.  She's a whore.  She's a monster.  She's the side of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; female sex that everyone should see.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But I'm curious about what's on those tapes -- specifically, whether
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there's anything on them that would shed light on who exactly &quot;Paul
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; McCartney&quot; really is.

&gt; &gt;&gt; huh??

&gt; &gt; &lt;mimicking&gt; &quot;huh??&quot;

&gt; Paul died back in the 60's. The person you see today is his brother
&gt; Michael.

I just want that person fingerprinted and swabbed, that's all.

I mean, in my heart of hearts, I know that that stuff is too crazy to
be believed, but I want him fingerprinted and swabbed, just to put the
matter to rest.

Heather branded on her forehead with a scarlet &quot;B&quot; and - uh - her
husband fingerprinted and swabbed would be the perfect ending as far
as I am concerned.

My husband and I have been married for 3 years now, and I have seen a trend
with his ex. While my husband was deployed overseas I offered his ex child
support for there son. There was no legal paperwork at the time for any child
support. When my husband and his ex split she ran with the kid, at the time
my husband was only 19 and to be honest, wasn't ready to be a father. Not
that is an excuse at all. Well for 2 years I have been sending her a check
every month, and now she has decided to go through the courts. She denies my
husband phone calls even visitation until the money is put on her card. She
has been married to her current husband for 12 years and my step son is 13.
He calls his step father daddy and my husband by his first name. The childs
mother uses my husband as an excuse for everything that goes wrong in the
childs life. Why hes does bad in school, why he has an attitude problem, I
mean the list goes on. My husband has thought about giving up his rights that
way his son can hopefully have a better life. Is this something that he
should do? Not to mention the distance between them. I know it sounds like a
cop out, but we have our family and she keeps making trouble for us. We want
to have his son in our lives, but she has made it clear that she doesn't want

That's too bad.  It says a lot to the kid.  Anyway, it's all very nice
what you want but what does he want?  It doesn't seem like his child
means that much if he hasn't even consulted an attorney to protect his
parental rights.  Does he have *any* opinion on the matter?  You were
the one sending support money and you are the one pushing for this
family scenario.  What is your husband contributing to this?

First.....

1.  this is between him and his ex .... you should really not make it
your battle - even if you are being nice.

2.  this NEEDS to be between him and his ex and the courts.

3.  Regardless of all of what you have said, the end truth is, your
husband has a biologicial child - that he is and should be financially
responsible for, how much?  and how far back? That is and should be up
to the courts.

Nothing is written in stone here, and everyone is making up things as
they go - which probably slant to their own interests and in the end -
this should be about the child, not about what the mom wants and not
about what the dad wants.

The child deserves to have a relationship with his father, and the mom
should not stand in his way and if she has an issue with this, she
again, need to take it up with the court system. And again, this is
not about what the mother wants..... it is about what is just and
right.

This is a child, one that will grow and mature and really need to know
his biologicial dad and again, has a right to know him.

So she gives you problems, use the court system - she will if she gets
a chance.  Document everything, every check - use it to your
advantage.  Which should be to show that support that was never
ordered - was paid.

I would also suggest you not continue to feel bitter about this child
because all of the drama it has caused to your life.

Talk to your spouse but when you do, think - really think about what
it is you are trying to and for what reasons.

The chance to make a differnence in a childs life does not come around
often and you both can be a positive that this kid needs.

be well

................

Look at this Mr Sanjay post I put up again.

Read &amp; find all info about Illegal Uliana &amp; what she plan &amp;
what she do. This is true case de veras not some story.

.................

To Whom it May Concern:

Please be advised that Uliana Abramova, recently dismissed from Scores
NY West Side, is in flagrant violation of her Non-Immigrant J-1 Visa.
She is presently based in New York City, and it is likely that she
will at some point seek employment at your New York City location. It
has come to our attention that Abramova has attempted to prevent
widespread knowledge of her illegal status She has attempted to coerce
several American men into marriage, in order to derive immigration
benefits. Abramova has in fact made serious threats against the wife
of one of the men she seduced, the father of a four year old child.
Please see the original email she sent to this poor woman, directly
following this email.

I must state unequivocally that all of the statements contained herein
are factual and verifiable. It is also true that the removal from the
USA of Uliana Abramova would not normally be a matter of such urgency,
except that she is a person who enjoys creating mischief and havoc.
She is therefore a liability to anyone who may employ her, and a
public nuisance in general.

Abramova effects an innocent, naive demeanor but is predatory,
unpredictable and dangerous. She is a Russian national and speaks with
an accent, is 5'5&quot; tall, with an extremely slight build and thin wispy
hair dyed red or blond. She has altered her appearance considerably in
the past few years (several surgeries to eliminate a bulbous nose),
and may continue to do so.

Our documentation indicates that Abramova came to the USA with the
definite intention of violating the conditions of her temporary, Non-
Immigrant, nonrenewable J-1 Visa. Entry into the USA was granted to
her under the stipulation that she work as a camp counselor at CCUSA
from 5/06 until 10/06. Abramova never showed up to work at the camp
and she also remained in the USA past the term of her temporary visa,
10/06. She is therefore both in violation of her visa and in overstay.

The word is lately that Abramova has been admitted to university,
possibly one of those in the CUNY system. She has accomplished this by
failing to disclose her illegal status. This will not stand. She is
going to be deported. Abramova is not legally allowed to work or live
or do anything anywhere in the USA. She in fact was recently refused a
student visa on the basis of her intentional violation of the J-1
Visa.

Contact has been made with ICE and with the Compliance Unit,
Department of State. Representative Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan
Congressional District 8 has offered to be of assistance, and the
process of having her removed from the USA is well under way.

Please be good enough to take this information seriously. It should
serve as a warning to avoid employing or associating with persons of
this description. I will not post the relevant law here, but suffice
it to say that anyone who employs Abramova or otherwise acts in any
manner than enables her to stay in the USA is guilty of &quot;harboring,&quot;
an offense punishable by 5 years in jail.

If you consider posting this warning on the internet to be excessively
inflammatory, please be good enough to advise your colleagues of this
matter privately. Thus informed, they can act according to their own
best judgement.

Sincerely yours,
Sanjay Karam, Esq.

From: love4all_hatred4none

=(1)= The people who accept the Promised Messiah in Islam also accept
conditions of Bai'at (allegiance). One among these requires a bond of
brotherhood and love and servitude to the Promised Messiah. This love
has no comparison anywhere else in the world. This condition cannot be
fulfilled without acquiring the blessings of Allah Almighty.... People
from all over the world who have accepted him express their firm
loyalty to the institution of his Caliphate (Khilafat), even if it
means abandoning their family ties.
************************************************************
=(2)=  God Himself had informed the Promised Messiah repeatedly that
He would grant him a high status and will fill the hearts of many with
his love and will spread his community to all corners of the world...
When a person pledges to accept him (the Imam of the time), his/her
love for the Promised Messiah and his Khilafat increases due to the
blessings of Allah. This will be rewarded by promised blessings by
Allah.
*************************************************************
=(3)= Promised Messiah has done such an excellent moral-training
(tarbiyyat) through his teachings that this love is inculcated in the
hearts of generation after generation. When God informed the Promised
Messiah about his imminent demise, he wrote in his book The Will:
....God Almighty shows two Manifestations so that two false joys of the
opponents be put to an end, it is not possible now that God should
relinquish His old-established way. So do not be grieved on what I
have said to you; and nor your hearts should be distressed. For it is
essential for you to see the second Manifestation, too, and its coming
is better for you because it is everlasting the continuity of which
will not end till the Day of Judgement. And that second Manifestation
cannot come unless I depart. But when I depart, then God will send
this second Manifestation for you which shall always remain with you....
********************************************************************
=(4)=When the Companions of the Promised Messiah, whose hearts were
inundated with love for him (for the sake of Allah) above all other
worldly ties, came to know of this, their concern must be immense, but
the Promised Messiah comforted them by reminding them that God will
not abandon them and they did not need to worry. These comforting
words formed the basis for these people to demonstrate and continue
this bond of love towards the second Manifestation that took place of
the mission started by the Promised Messiah because that was to be
eternal. This is how the Promised Messiah kindled this fire of love
for Khilafat among his companions by stating the importance and
significance of Khilafat, which is indeed a reward from Allah. The
companions of the Promised Messiah understood this advice and entered
into a bond of sincere obedience to the system of Khilafat, which is
the foundation of strength and unity and progress.
*********************************************************
=(5)=The fulfillment of this covenant of God made with the Promised
Messiah is being witnessed... His jamaat/community was formed as a
result of the prophecy of the Holy Prophetsaw for the latter days and
is confirmation of the fact that indeed the Promised Messiah is the
Reformer of the latter days and Khilafat is indeed a truthful
institution. This Khilafat was established in order to bring every
person into the fold of Islam i.e. to establish Unity of God and to
inculcate the love for the Holy Prophetsaw and the Promised Messiah in
the hearts of the adherents. This love is being witnessed today world
wide as proves the divine promise.... Today, the message of the Promised
Messiah is being broadcasted to people of all races and all colors and
people are accepting his message and entering into this bond of love
with him.
*********************************************************
=(6)= The holy Caliph of holy  Promised Messiah also thanked and
prayed for all those who showed love and bond when they heard about
his recent surgery. He said: It is this two-way love that will be the
foundation of firm establishment of eternal Khilafat. May God keep
this tree evergreen. This bond can only form as a result of our own
prayers in the service of Allah. May Allah enable all of us to occupy
ourselves in such prayers.  Ameen....

You realize that this is the woman you chose to make children with and
make the best of it.  If she is destructive or dangerous, fight for
custody.  If not, make nice so you can see your kids.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some reason I'm really rethinking my being nice to her again.  I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; always feel crappy/get duped in the end.  Total ramble sorry...

&gt; &gt;&gt; That's okay.  Its what this joint is for.
&gt; &gt;&gt; IMHO... Its entirely normal to get angry, blame others and decline
&gt; &gt;&gt; to acknowledge any role in this tragic mess, but with time+distance,
&gt; &gt;&gt; many of us look back with hindsight and accept we made choices,
&gt; &gt;&gt; starting with our selection of a spouse, that led almost inexorably to
&gt; &gt;&gt; the results we now face.  Nothing can ever justify what she did, but
&gt; &gt;&gt; could you have been a better person?  Well, now's your chance.

&gt; &gt; When you're dealing with a selfish narcissist or a con artist,
&gt; &gt; the old joke about how &quot;no good deed goes unpunished&quot;
&gt; &gt; seems to apply.

&gt; &gt; Rog's advice about being a better person is good, although
&gt; &gt; an ex who is a toxic narcissistic con artist will see
&gt; &gt; every bit of niceness as an opportunity to attempt
&gt; &gt; guilt trips, manipulation or worse.

&gt; &gt; If you didn't have kids together I'd recommend
&gt; &gt; completely cutting off absolutely all contact.

&gt; &gt; As it is the con artist knows she has you by the tail
&gt; &gt; and will abuse that situation.

&gt; &gt; If you are in a &quot;one party&quot; state for telephone recording
&gt; &gt; I would advise you to record all phone calls
&gt; &gt; between you and this con artist.

&gt; &gt; Over time you will be able to document her
&gt; &gt; attempts at giving you a guilt trip or conning you.
&gt; &gt; If you can prove this manipulative crap you might
&gt; &gt; be able to get the court to order her into some
&gt; &gt; kind of psychotherapy or at least a psych eval
&gt; &gt; to look this over regarding custody.

&gt; &gt; Have you tried &quot;I'm not calling for you to try
&gt; &gt; to give me some guilt trip or for you to try to
&gt; &gt; con me out of more money.  I'm calling
&gt; &gt; about the kids, not you.&quot;

&gt; &gt; If this woman is so manipulative, have you
&gt; &gt; wondered what effect this will have on the kids?
&gt; &gt; Won't her &quot;con artist&quot; or manipulative side
&gt; &gt; make the kids a little psychologically &quot;bent&quot;?- Hide quoted text -

I understand your advice to 'make nice' but why should he?

Why should he do anything for the benefit of being a parent to the
kids?

Because trust me, just when you figure out where the line is, she will
move it.

It is your right to see the kids - and I think in this, 'she' should
need to adjust or you should go see your lawyer.

This is not about him or her and what they had and where it went, it
is now about him being a father - having a 'court given right' to see
his kids, and her having a 'court appointed responsibility' to those
kids...

We keep seeing how men have to adhere to one end of the stick - so why
should not the women that are the custodial parent? (and vica versa).

&gt;Judge James M. Shull removed from bench

&gt;By TOM CAMPBELL
&gt;TIMES-DISPATCH STAFF WRITER  (Richmond, VA)

&gt;A judge who made a woman pull down her pants in court and decided a
&gt;child-visitation dispute with a coin toss was removed from the bench
&gt;yesterday.

&gt;The Virginia Supreme Court, acting on a complaint forwarded from the
&gt;state Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission, ordered the removal of
&gt;Judge James Michael Shull of the Wise County Juvenile and Domestic
&gt;Relations Court.
">

&lt;snip&gt;

I read a follow-up message on Glenn Sacks' website in which Glenn says
that this judge may have been &quot;railroaded&quot; because he, in reality was
coming down on trhe side of a father in a custody case where the
mother was a certified nutcase who claimed injuries due to the
father's alleged abuse.

The question was whether the alleged injuries (on the mother's leg)
were self-inflicted or not.  The article said that when the judge
questioned the mother about this, she actually *offered* to show the
judge the &quot;wounds&quot; and pulled down the top of her trousers to
demonstrate.  It was reported that the judge indeed felt that the
wounds were self-inflicted; and, if I recall correctly, the judge
ruled in favor of the father.

Best,

If you have the time, try to watch some of the TV cooking
shows. Not the fancy chefs cooking stuff with ingredients
you never heard of, but the ones that give good basic
cooking advice while being entertaining. I don't know who
you get over there, but cooks like Jamie Oliver or Nigella
Lawson (both English) come to mind here.

Here is a starter for you for breakfasts.

Instant scrambled egg:

Crack one egg into a mug. Add a slurp of milk. Stir briskly
with a fork for a few seconds, add seasoning to taste and
some chopped herbs if you want to be fancy.

Zap in the microwave on High for one minute. You may need to
experiment for the time - different microwaves have
different powers. If it's still runny, stir and zap for
another 20 seconds. If it's set like a rock, use 45 seconds
next time.

Stir with a fork, eat direct from the mug. Or spoon it onto
a plate if you want to be fancy.

If you're hungrier use two eggs, a bigger mug, and a little
more time.

Bon Appetit:-)

Heck, there are times, situations, etc. when vegans, and vegetarians, find
that they have to come up with a way to get more protein in - either that or
restrict their level of activity!

Of course, often there's commentary here that seems to reflect that none of
us ever tried low-fat, meatless or nearly meatless, as a WOE (Way of
Eating)! I know I did. It was a very very restrictive diet including a
cutback in portion size. Initially, I lost weight, but I couldn't keep it
off. And, it did nothing to improve my lipids &amp; may even have made them
worse in the long-term. Plus, it was depressing, and I was hungry for much
longer than last year when I cut back on carbs while increasing healthy meat
&amp; healthy fat. I should add that for me eating low-fat, nearly meatless &amp;
very restricted was pre-diabetes diagnosis by around 5 years.

I'll add to the chorus. Ring them now and ask for copies of

When you get them, file them. Very useful to compare your

You could use any oil, such as olive, to saute the mushrooms
and omit the dollop of cream at serving. Pre-diagnosis I
used to use potato as a thickener; you could experiment with
things like guar gum or similar.

One ingredient I found essential for cooking mushrooms to my
taste is nutmeg. Enhanced flavour, no sweetness.

&gt; played properly in an open air setting beside a church with
&gt; great bells and howitzers at the appropriate moments. I
&gt; heard it that way thirty years ago at Duntroon and I've
&gt; never forgotten the experience.

&gt; I can probably ask for the howitzers at my funeral, but the
&gt; church bells may be a problem for a non-believer:-)

&gt; For example:

If my faith allowed music to be played, which it doesnt, I would want I
made It Through the Rain by Barry Manilow.  It is a song of survival and
suits me perfectly.

Kate, that is some story about the kidlet. At least it had a happy
ending for both of you.  The stress must have been overwhelming.

I beat you on the colic.  My daughter had it until she was seven months
old and could sit up by herself and expel the gas.  It was god awful.

LOL

he had colic right thru his first year

i had him on my shoulder, holding his feet, rocking him back and forth to
keep him from screaming

every so often (like when i cooked dinner) i would put him in the swing, and
let him swing until dinner was cooked, and i had my meal

he did go onto 'regular' foods when he was 6 months old...... starting with
pumpkin from the tin..... and meat that i processed in a food processor with
lots of 'au jus' with it to make it easy for him to swallow

he still doesn't like meat he has to chew

sigh........ blew that one

Linking Doctors' Pay to Performance Has Little Effect on Diabetes
Outcomes

Linking doctors' pay to how well they follow treatment guidelines can
improve quality of care but not health outcomes, according to a study
of 1,666 poor, uninsured patients with diabetes (see also Diabetes).

Medicare and large health insurers have been experimenting with pay-
for-performance (PFP) plans that pay doctors more based on how well
they follow accepted treatment guidelines.

The researchers looked at changes in how doctors practiced at the
ACCESS Community Health Network in Chicago after it started paying for
performance. Under the new system, physicians received a base salary
plus bonus payments for specific tests and procedures they ordered.

*THE BAGGY YELLOW SHIRT*
The baggy yellow shirt had long sleeves, four extra-large pockets
trimmed in
black thread and snaps up the front.  It was faded from years of
wear, but
still in decent shape.
I found it in 1963 when I was home from college on Christmas break,
rummaging
through bags of clothes Mom intended to give away.
&quot;You're not taking that old thing, are you?&quot; Mom said when
she saw me packing
the yellow shirt.  &quot;I wore that when I was pregnant with your
brother in
1954!&quot;
&quot;It's just the thing to wear over my clothes during art class,
Mom.
Thanks!&quot;  I slipped it into my suitcase before she could
object.
The yellow shirt became a part of my college wardrobe.  I loved
it.
After graduation, I wore the shirt the day I moved into my new apartment
and on
Saturday mornings when I cleaned.
The next year, I married.  When I became pregnant, I wore the
yellow
shirt during big-belly days.  I missed Mom and the rest of my family,
since
we were in Colorado and they were in Illinois.
But that shirt helped.  I smiled, remembering that Mother had worn
it
when she was pregnant, 15 years earlier.
That Christmas, mindful of the warm feelings the shirt had given me, I

patched one elbow, wrapped it in holiday paper and sent it to Mom.
When
Mom wrote to thank me for her &quot;real&quot; gifts, she said the yellow
shirt was
lovely.  She never mentioned it again.
The next year, my husband, daughter and I stopped at Mom and Dad's to
pick up
some furniture.
Days later, when we uncrated the kitchen table, I noticed something
yellow
taped to its bottom.  The shirt!

And so the pattern was set.
On our next visit home, I secretly placed the shirt under Mom and Dad's

mattress.  I don't know how long it took for her to find it, but
almost two
years passed before I discovered it under the base of our living-room
floor
lamp.  The yellow shirt was just what I needed now while refinishing

furniture.  The walnut stains added character.
In 1975, my husband and I divorced. With my three children, I prepared
to
move back to Illinois.  As I packed, a deep depression overtook
me.  I
wondered if I could make it on my own.  I wondered if I would find a
job.
I paged through the Bible, looking for comfort.
In Ephesians, I read, &quot;So use every piece of God's armor to resist
the enemy
whenever he attacks, and when it is all over, you will be standing
up.&quot;
I tried to picture myself wearing God's armor, but all I saw was me
wearing
the stained yellow shirt.  Slowly, it dawned on me.  Wasn't my
mother's love a piece of God's armor?  My courage was renewed.
Unpacking in our new home, I knew I had to get the shirt back to
Mother.
The next time I visited her, I tucked it in her bottom dresser
drawer.
Meanwhile, I found a good job at a radio station.  A year later I

discovered the yellow shirt hidden in a rag bag in my cleaning
closet.
Something new had been added.  Embroidered in bright green across the

breast pocket were the words &quot;I BELONG TO PAT.&quot;
Not to be outdone, I got out my own embroidery materials and added an
apostrophe and seven more letters.  Now the shirt proudly
proclaimed,
&quot;BELONG TO PAT'S MOTHER.&quot; But I didn't stop there.
I zig-zagged all the frayed seams, then had a friend mail the shirt in
a
fancy box to Mom from Arlington, VA.  We enclosed an official looking

letter from &quot;The Institute for the Destitute,&quot; announcing that
she was the
recipient of an award for good deeds.  I would have given anything to
see
Mom's face when she opened the box.  But, of course, she never
mentioned
it.
Two years later, in 1978, I remarried.  The day of our wedding,
Harold
and I put our car in a friend's garage to avoid practical jokers.
After
the wedding, while my husband drove us to our honeymoon suite, I reached
for a
pillow in the car to rest my head. It felt lumpy.  I unzipped the
case and
found, wrapped in wedding paper, the yellow shirt. Inside a pocket was a
note:
&quot;Read John 14:27-29.  I love you both, Mother.&quot;
That night I paged through the Bible in a hotel room and found the
verses: &quot;I
am leaving you with a gift: peace of mind and heart.  And the peace I
give
isn't fragile like the peace the world gives.  So don't be troubled
or
afraid. Remember what I told you: I am going away, but I will come back to
you
again.  If you really love me, you will be very happy for me, for now
I can
go to the Father, who is greater than I am.  I have told you these
things
before they happen so that when they do, you will believe in
me.&quot;
The shirt was Mother's final gift.  She had known for three months
that
she had terminal Lou Gehrig's disease.  Mother died the following
year at
age 57.
I was tempted to send the yellow shirt with her to her grave.  But
I'm
glad I didn't, because it is a vivid reminder of the love-filled game she
and I
played for 16 years.
Besides, my older daughter is in college now, majoring in art.
And
every art student needs a baggy yellow shirt with big pockets to wear to
art
class.

Nicky, by 1 year he was 100%

the pediatrician said 'it's a miracle' because they had NO idea why it
started, and they
weren't really sure why it stopped either

but he's not been ill with a cold or a tummy bug since he was 2 years old

2 1/2 years old......

i'm thrilled for the kidlet

My grocery has a gluten-free aisle, so I wandered over to look today.
All the brands with quinoa had corn also and were pretty darned carby;
