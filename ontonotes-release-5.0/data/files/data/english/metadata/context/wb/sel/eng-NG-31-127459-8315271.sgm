Today's Learning:

Daf Yomi (Yerushalmi): Yoma 2

Begin a new cycle of Mishnah Berurah
on Tuesday, 30 Av / August 14
Learn three paragraphs every day.

Our parashah opens, &quot;See, I put before you today a blessing and a
curse.
The blessing: when you hearken to the commandments of Hashem, your G-d, that
I
command you today.  And the curse: if you do not hearken to the commandments
of
Hashem, your G-d . . .&quot;  We read similarly in Parashat Nitzavim (30:15),
&quot;See,
I have placed before you today the life and the good, and the death and the
evil.&quot;  The midrash Yalkut Shimoni comments: &quot;Lest a Jew say, `Since Hashem
has
placed two paths before me, a way of life and a way of death, I may choose
whichever I wish,' therefore the Torah says (30:19), `You shall choose
life'.&quot;

R' Yitzchak Eliyahu Landau z&quot;l (1781-1876; Vilna) explains: In man's
mundane affairs, if one person (call him &quot;Reuven&quot;) instructs another person
(&quot;Shimon&quot;) to do something for Shimon's own benefit, Reuven will not punish
Shimon for failing to do that thing.  The only loss that Shimon will suffer
because of his failure is that he will not obtain the promised benefit.  One
might think, therefore, that when Hashem gives us a choice between good and
bad
and between life and death, He does not care which we choose.  If we perform
the mitzvot we will be rewarded, but if we don't perform the mitzvot, we
will
not be punished.  Or, so one might think.

Says the Torah: &quot;You shall choose life.&quot;  The reason Hashem created the
world was to share His Goodness, and if we do not choose life, we frustrate
His
very goal in creating us.  Therefore, we are commanded to choose life, and
we
will be held accountable if we do not.  (Patsheggen Ha'ketav: Divrei
Chachamim)

********

&quot;If there shall be a destitute person among you, any of your
brethren in any of your cities, in the Land that Hashem, your G-d, gives
you,
you shall not harden your heart or close your hand against your destitute
brother. . .  You shall surely give him, and let your heart not feel bad
when
you give him. . .&quot;  (15:7, 10)

R' Aharon Lewin (rabbi of Rzeszow, Poland; killed in the Holocaust)
writes
the following regarding this mitzvah:

The Gemara (Berachot 10b) teaches: &quot;If one has a Torah scholar as a
guest
in his house and allows the scholar to benefit from his (the host's)
property,
it is as if he (the host) offered a Tamid offering in the Bet Hamikdash.&quot;
What, asks R' Lewin, is the purpose of the words, &quot;in his house&quot;?  He
explains:

We learn in Pirkei Avot (Ch.1): &quot;Let your home be wide open and let the
poor be members of your household.&quot;  This is a message to the many people
who
give charity generously but who never allow the poor into their homes.
Rather,
all collectors and beggars are required to stand in the front hall and
receive
their donations there.  Even if they are given food, they are made to eat it
standing at the door or even outside of the house.  This is not proper;
rather,
says the Mishnah, let your home be wide open and let the poor be members of
your household.

But what about the carpet and the couch?  What if the poor track mud or
snow into the house?  R' Lewin writes that King Shlomo already answered
these
questions.  We read (Mishlei 31:20-21-in the description of the Eishet
Chayil /
&quot;Woman of Valor&quot;), &quot;She spreads out her palm to the poor and extends her
hand
to the destitute.  She fears not snow for her household, [though] her entire
house is clothed [i.e., upholstered] in scarlet wool.&quot;

If this is how one must treat an ordinary charity collector, how much
more
so a Torah scholar!  This is what the Gemara means when it says, &quot;If one has
a
Torah scholar as a guest in his house . . . ,&quot; not merely at the door.

The importance of the attitude with which one gives charity is taught
in
our verses.  One must not only give, one must not feel bad when he gives.
To
the contrary, one must speak gently to the beggar and console him over his
troubles and embarrassment.  (Ha'drash Ve'ha'iyun)

From the same work . . .

There are two attitudes that can lead one to give tzedakah / charity.
One
can feel sorry for the downtrodden pauper and give him charity as an
expression
of mercy.  Such charity certainly is a worthy deed, but it is not the
highest
form of tzedakah.  The highest form of charity is to give because it is a
good
deed; it is G-d's Will and His commandment to us.

R' Lewin notes that R' Yosef Albo z&quot;l (author of Sefer Ha'ikkarim;
1380-
1444) uses the above idea to explain the verse (Yeshayah 32:17): &quot;The
product
[literally, `deed'] of charity shall be peace; and the effect [literally,
`service'] of charity -- quiet and security forever.&quot;  The deed of giving
charity, no matter why it is done, brings peace to the one who does it.
However, the service of tzedakah, giving charity because it is a form of
service to G-d, is far greater.  Such tzedakah brings the doer quiet and
security forever.

R' Lewin continues (citing his grandfather, R' Yitzchak Shmelkes z&quot;l):
One
advantage of giving tzedakah because it is a mitzvah rather than because one
feels pity is that the feeling of pity wears off eventually.  Moreover, when
we
see that poverty is widespread, we become insensitive to it.  Not so if one
gives charity to fulfill the Will of G-d.  That Will is unchanging, and so
one's charity will be unending.  This is the teaching of our verse: &quot;Give
him,
you shall give him.&quot;  Say Chazal: You shall give to a pauper repeatedly,
even a
hundred times.  How can you train yourself to do this?  &quot;Let your heart not
feel bad when you give him&quot; - don't give because you feel bad, but because
G-d
commanded it.

********

&quot;Beware lest there be a lawless thought in your heart, saying,
`The
seventh year approaches, the sabbatical year,' and you will look
malevolently
upon your destitute brother and refuse to give him - then he may appeal
against
you to Hashem, and it will be a sin upon you.&quot;  (Devarim 15:9)

This verse warns us not to refuse to make loans although the shemittah
/
sabbatical year is approaching.  (Because loans must be forgiven in the
shemittah year, people may refuse to lend money close to the shemittah
year.)

R' Shaul Yisraeli z&quot;l (1909-1995; Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivat Merkaz
Harav)
writes:

&quot;Imagine!  The Torah warns elsewhere against trickery and deceit, on
withholding wages from laborers and so on.  The Torah commands us to conduct
business faithfully, and to use honest measures and weights.  In the face of
all these laws, a man works and toils until he has saved a certain amount.

&quot;This money which a person has saved notwithstanding all these
commandments is his money which he earned honestly and through hard work,
and
now the Torah comes along and obligates him to lend it, and without interest
or
benefit.  The Jew does this willingly and does not demand any return on his
money; only one thought beats in his heart, there is only one thing that he
wishes to guarantee - that he will get his money back.  And that single
thought, the Torah refers to as `lawlessness.'  The Torah demands that he
make
loans knowing that he may never be repaid.

&quot;One who goes in the Torah's way and observes this commandment will
effect
a revolution in his thinking about his membership in a community.  Through
the
quiet observance of this mitzvah, one will solve many of the hardest social
problems that have worried man from time immemorial.&quot;  (Ma'amar
&quot;Ha'Shemittah
Be'mahalach Ha'dorot&quot;)

Shemittah

[This coming year - 5768 - will be a shemittah / sabbatical year,
when certain agricultural activities are prohibited in Eretz Yisrael.
Beginning this week, approximately 30 days before the shemittah begins, we
will
be devoting a portion of each issue to legal and philosophical aspects of
the
sabbatical year.  The following laws are taken from Chapter 1 of Sefer
Ha'shemittah, by R' Yechiel Michel Tikochinski z&quot;l (1872-1956), a prominent
halachic authority in Yerushalayim, probably best known outside of Israel
for
his work Gesher Ha'chaim on the laws of mourning.]

1. [Early halachic sources proposed a number of different methods for
calculating when the shemittah year will occur.]  The universally accepted
method today is to divide the years since creation by seven (e.g., 5768 / 7
=
824).  Poskim / halachic authorities now agree that we should not even
consider
this as a matter of doubt, but rather as a definite calculation. [Ed. note:
In
a future issue, we will discuss the implications of treating the calculation
as
a matter of doubt.]

2.  In the time of the Bet Hamikdash, certain activities in the fields
were prohibited by halachah le'Moshe mi'Sinai / oral tradition received by
Moshe at Mount Sinai beginning thirty days before the shemittah
[corresponding
to this coming Tuesday].  In certain fields, work was prohibited from the
preceding Shavuot or even the preceding Pesach.  Today, when we have no Bet
Hamikdash, working the fields is permitted until Rosh Hashanah, except that
planting and grafting must be completed 44 days before the shemittah.  This
rule was instituted so that one who sees young plants will not suspect their
owner of having planted them during the shemittah.

More &quot;Ma'aseh Rav&quot; from the Diaries

In addition to the historical interest of Eleh Masei, subtitled
&quot;A
Journal of the Journey of the Rabbis, Members of the Committee to Raise the
Crown of Judaism in Our Holy Land, Who Toured All the Settlements of Shomron
[Samaria] and Galil [Galilee] in the Winter of 5674 [1914],&quot; the work from
which we have been presenting excerpts this past year is significant as a
source of reliable information about the halachic practices of some of the
leading Torah figures of early 20th-century Eretz Yisrael, especially R'
Avraham Yitzchak Hakohen Kook z&quot;l, later Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi of the Holy
Land, and R' Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, z&quot;l, later Chief Rabbi of the Eidah
Ha'chareidit in Yerushalayim.  Such halachic rulings, derived not from the
express rulings of Torah scholars, but rather from their actions, are
referred
to as Ma'aseh Rav / actions of the rabbi.  We presented some examples two
weeks
ago, and below are some additional ones.

In the town of Yavnael, they ate the melaveh malkah with great fanfare.
R' Kook commented that it was worthwhile to have made the long journey just
to
see the care that R' Sonnenfeld took to have the melaveh malkah immediately
after havdalah.  [Ed. note: Poskim rule that at the very latest, the meal
should be eaten before midnight.]

In Poriah, the rabbis kashered pottery vessels that had been used only
as
a kli sheni (literally, &quot;second vessel&quot; - i.e., never directly on a heat
source) by immersing them three times in boiling water.  [Ed. note: Poskim
rule
that kashering such pottery vessels is permitted only in extenuating
circumstances.  Presumably, the rabbis understood that they would not
persuade
the villagers to keep kosher if they were told to throw away their pots.]

In Magdiel, the rabbis insisted that the community change its name,
which
early commentaries say was connected with the Roman Empire.

In Zichron Yaakov, they visited the rabbi in his home.  [Ed. note: The
Gemara teaches that one who enters a town should visit the local Torah
scholar
in his home, but the Shulchan Aruch does not cite this law.]

Shabbat Shalom

&quot;Hamaayan is prepared by laymen and published weekly for the
edification and enjoyment of the reader who is lacking the time or
ability to study the weekly parashah on his own.  Hamaayan's goal is
to acquaint the reader with a broad spectrum of traditional Torah
commentary -- classical, recent and &quot;obscure&quot; -- as well as with
aspects of Jewish history and thought.

The editors hope these brief 'snippets' will engender further study
and discussion of Torah topics (&quot;lehagdil Torah u'leha'adirah&quot;), and
your letters are appreciated.  Unfortunately, they lack the time to
respond to lengthy questions.&quot;
