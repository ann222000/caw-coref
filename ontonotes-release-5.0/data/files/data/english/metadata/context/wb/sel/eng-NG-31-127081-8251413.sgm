NG,

Elsewhere I saw info concerning a Joseph Frazer given in the 1881 Lancashire
census as being born in Cheltenham (no county given) in about 1875.

Freebmd gives a Joseph Frazer's birth as being registered in Salford Lancs
in the Sept. qtr of 1874. There is no registration of a birth of a Joseph
Frazer in Cheltenham between 1870 and 1880 according to freebmd.

Less than three miles from Salford is Cheetham.

What is your opinion please of the possibility that the actual birth took
place in Cheetham LAN  and not Cheltenham GLS?

Were enumeration sheets written up after the census returns or were they
taken around by the enumerator?

From the evidence you present, it looks likely that he was born in
Lancashire rather then Gloucestershire. Have you seen the actual inage of
the 1881 census return - or only a transcription? Could it have been
mis-transcribed?

It's very clearly 'Cheltenham' with no county on the 1881 image - you
will need to get the birth certificate to see if the parents are
Alexander and Sarah.

However:
In 1891, he is enumerated as FRASER b in Salford
RG12; Piece: 3224; Folio 123; Page 56
3 Eldon St, Salford
Alexander Fraser        52  Engineer &amp; Oiler
Sarah Fraser    41
Joseph Fraser   17  Pattern Card Maker (appr.)
Hugh Fraser     14  Iron Turner ??O21/8??
Emily Fraser    12
Sarah E Fraser  7
Annie Fraser    3
Martin J Bonnon         18 adopted son pawnbroker's apprentice

If you would like the images, give me a valid email address.

It's certainly possible.
Have you been able to find the family in 1891 census to see what
his birthplace is on that?

The only way you're going to be sure is to get the birth certificate.

It could have been either.  There's also the possibilities that the
family moved from one place to the other so &quot;adopted&quot; their new home
town as their original one, the mother might have &quot;gone home&quot; to have
her child for some reason.

As has been said often before: the household schedules were delivered
to the residences by the enumerator, the householder (or someone on
his/her behalf) completed said schedule then the enumerator collected
them completing any that hadn't otherwise been done.  Those household
schedules were then written up into the enumerator's books which is
what we see when we view a census page.  It means that the enumerator
may not have been able to read the householder's (or proxy's) writing
or he may not have been able to read his own if it was scribbled down
quickly.

or, more realistically, ask GRO to check before issuing the certificate.

For comparison (FWIW), I got a cert the other day for a child who'd
been given as 1m on the 1851 Chelsea census and born in Battersea,
Surrey. According to his cert, if accurate, he was then actually only
a week old so they probably knew where he'd been born. But he was
later registered as having been born in Chelsea.

Not a big distance but it seems possible that the claimed place of
birth for registration purposes was for convenience - just say he was
born locally and save hassle. I wonder how often that happened among
the less literate.

First, check the G.R.O. indexes between 1870 and 1880 to see if there was a
birth near Cheltenham.

No, I checked that, and it is definitely Cheltenham. No county is given.

Census returns are full of errors like this.
Each household filled in a sheet, possibly with guidance from the
enumerator (especially if they were illiterate - the enumerator would
write down what he heard).

The enumerator filled in the return we see from these sheets, doing his
best with the rotten writing, etc.

One of my relations was entered in the 1901 census as being born in
Buxton, Derbyshire. She was really born in South Lambeth, London, and no
doubt entered on the household form as born in Brixton.

I would say that your guess of Cheetham is probably sound.

Alas, I cannot (in a fairly superficial search) find your Frazer family
in 1891 or 1901, which would have helped...
