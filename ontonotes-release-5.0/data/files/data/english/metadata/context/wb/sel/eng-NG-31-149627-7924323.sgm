------------------------------

*Toxic World:*

*We are living in the Toxic World which is drastically effecting our health.
Chemicals and toxins accumulate in fat tissue. The more chemicals and
toxins, the more fat the body manufactures. Toxic chemicals, which have been
used to fatten up animals for meat production by reducing their ability to
use their own existing fat stores, also contribute to weight gain in humans.
*

*Make-up and body care products have been linked to allergic reactions,
birth defects, and even cancer. It is a medically recognized fact that our
body absorbs significant amounts of what we put on our skin. With Certified
Organic food rapidly becoming the nutrition of choice by the health
conscious amongst us, why would you accept any less for your skin?. The
absence of government oversight for this $35 billion industry leads to
companies routinely marketing products with ingredients that are poorly
studied, not studied at all, or worse, known to pose potentially serious
health risks.*
------------------------------

*Why People are FAT?*

*Allah has created ever human in different shape and sizes. Every single
human can never be a super model. It is OK if some is bulky, thin, short,
tall etc. All can have different shapes and sizes. All can have different
desires as well. Some one may like dangerous rides, BUT other may get stroke
or heart attack, so you need to think how other may feel and you need to
HELP them instead of TORTURE them.*

*The MAJOR thing, from what we need to be careful is the FAT. Even a thin
person can get stroke or heart attack, due to fat. First we need to find the
roots of all the cause of fat and many other diseases, why we are getting
sick?*

*We need to realize that we are living in the Toxic World, and each and
every item may contain Toxics chemicals. Try to avoid highly Toxic items to
eat or drink or put on your skin, if you can. General theory is that if any
thing you cannot eat then don't put on your skin. Yes there are many cases,
where you don't have choices other than using medicine. You are what you eat
or drink fits in many cases. By following the guide lines in Avoiding
Following Foods / Drinks etc. and Recommended Foods or Drinks etc. may help
reduce the fat.*
------------------------------

*Some Useful Spices etc.:*

*Allah has created nothing without any reason. Regarding Spices, many are
very useful. Use of Black Pepper, Cinnamon, Clove, Garlic, Ginger and
Kalonji (Black Seeds), etc in Curry is very useful and may protect us from
many diseases like cold, cough and flue. Dates, Figs, Honey, Lemon, Olive
Oil, Pomegranate, Apple Cider Vinegar and Water Melon etc have other
benefits. Before mentioning about the Medical Uses of Honey and Apple Cider
Vinegar, here I would like to mention few things about Natural Cure and
Primary causes of the illnesses.*
------------------------------

*Medical Uses of Honey*

* http://www.crescentlife.com/dietnutrition/honey.htm*

More than 1,400 years ago Allah and His messenger (peace be upon him) told
us that honey can heal a variety of medical problems.

*Honey is a healing for the mankind:*

&quot;And the Lord inspired the bee, saying: Take your habitations in the
mountains and in the trees and in what they erect. Then, eat of all fruits
and follow the ways of your Lord made easy (for you)'. There comes forth
from their bellies a drink of varying color wherein is healing for men.
Verily in this is indeed a sign for people who think.&quot; (Quraan 16:68-69)

For common cough &amp; cold, take a tablespoon of honey and mixed it with little
black pepper power and salt and eat it.

Traditional uses of honey have included honey mixed with lemon for sore
throats and it has also been used for stomach pains and problems, as well as
certain eye conditions.

*Modern research shows that honey:*

blocks the growth of oral bacteria

coats the throat and reduces throat irritation

is effective when used in the treatment of gastric or peptic stomach ulcers

is effective in the treatment of various wounds and infections because of
its antimicrobial (antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal) properties.

is also considered an antioxidant. This means it allows the blood to
circulate better and provide more oxygen to areas of the body such as the
brain.

can also be used externally to promote healing when applied to wounds, even
postoperative wounds

has also been effective in its use to treat burns

contains a variety of sugars and minerals and has been shown to be low in
calories and useful as a sweetener for diabetics, people with heart disease
or those who are overweight.

Researchers are not absolutely sure why honey heals but they are learning
new things about honey everyday.

&quot;Honey is considered the food of foods, the drink of drinks and the drug of
drugs. It is used for creating appetite, strengthening the stomach and
eliminating phlegm, as a meat preservative, hair conditioner, eye salve, and
mouthwash. The best honey is that produced in the spring, the second best is
that of summer, and the least quality is produced in winter.&quot;

The Book of Sufi Healing. Shaykh Moinuddin Chishti

*Treatment of Burns and Skin Ulcers:*

A study in 1991 by Dr Subrahmanyam compared the results of topical
application of honey to burns with conventional Burn treatment, (silver
sulfadiazine). The following results were noted and reproduced by Julie
McCarthy, a postgraduate student at the University of Guelph. &quot;Burn patients
of a variety of ages were divided into two treatment groups. The burns of
patients in group I were cleaned with a saline solution and pure, undiluted,
unprocessed honey was applied daily. Burns of group 2 were cleaned and
covered with gauze that was soaked in 5% silver sulfadiazine, which was
changed daily. Results showed that within 7 days 91 % of the infected wounds
treated with honey were free from infection, compared to less than 7% of the
silver sulfadiazine treated burns. Within 15 days, 87% of honey treated
wounds were healed compared to less than 10% of wounds in group 2. &quot;
Furthermore, Efem (1988) showed that the various types of wounds and skin
ulcers which did not respond to conventional methods of treatment such as
antibiotics and medicated dressings, responded to treatment with honey.
These included:

Fournier's Gangrene Burn wounds Tropical ulcers Bed sores Diabetic ulcers
The anti-bacterial activity of honey is based partly on its osmotic effects
in that the bacteria that cause infection are unable to survive in honey
because they become dehydrated. In addition, it was noted that the presence
of hydrogen peroxide generated by the enzymatic activity of glucose oxidase
in dilute honey contributes to the anti-bacterial activity. As hydrogen
peroxide decomposes, it generates highly reactive free radicals that react
and kill bacteria.

*The Treatment of Gastroenteritis and Stomach Ulcers using Honey:*

Research by Haffejee and Moose (1985) found that honey treatment shortened
the duration of diarrhea in patients with bacterial gastroenteritis, in that
patients treated with honey had a mean recovery of 58 hours compared with 93
hours for control patients. In addition, research conducted here in New
Zealand by Somal et al (1994) at Waikato has shown that Manuka Honey
successfully inhibits Helicobacter pylori the organism responsible for upper
gastro-intestinal dyspepsia of stomach ulcers. However, it should be noted
that research is ongoing in this field, and although the initial results are
promising, full clinical trials are yet to be completed. As well as its
other therapeutic properties, the presence of potassium, sodium calcium and
magnesium means that honey is capable of neutralizing acid in the body and
thus maintaining the acid-alkaline balance.

*NOTE - Nothing here is to be taken as medical advice. Always ask your
doctor before attempting to diagnose yourself or deciding upon medication to
alleviate any symptoms. Use Diluted Apple Cider Vinegar unless it is
mentioned for other type. Stay away from soft drinks and chocolates. Any
time you take any vinegar internally, be sure to rinse your mouth with plain
water.*

*Warnings: Do not use any Vinegar on Empty Stomach, since it is like an acid
and may cause other problems.*
------------------------------

*Apple Cider Vinegar has many benefits of it. Many Sahabas used to keep at
their homes. **(Tirmidhi: Chapter 25 – Hadeeth – 001 – 143)*

To prevent from Common Flue Virus it will be nice to include Apple Cider
Vinegar, in your meal, a homemade salads.

*Simple Homemade Salads Ingredients to prevent from Common Flue:*

- Onion Rings – one large size or few small size onions for the entire
family
- Lemon juice – one tablespoon
- Apple Cider Vinegar – one tablespoon

Apple Cider Vinegar is the *key* to get prevent from flues. It is also very
helpful for sore throat. You may need to take a tablespoon of Apple Cider
Vinegar to do gargle type for a minute and then drink it for twice a day.
You may use it like an *spray* to the affected area in the throat for four
times a day to avoid taking access of any vinegar.

*Warnings: Do not use any Vinegar on Empty Stomach, since it is like an acid
and may cause other problems.*
------------------------------

*Public Experiences:*

**

1. A reader says; My best use for Apple Cider Vinegar is to use 1
tablespoon Apple Cider Vinegar to an 8 ounce glass of warm water for a
*sore throat*. Gargle every hour and swallow after gargling, with two
mouthfuls. I got this from a Vermont Folk Medicine book by
D.C.Jarvismany years ago. If started at the first hint of a sore
throat, it always
works, usually within a night's sleep. I don't mind the taste, but some
children might.
2. Use for a *throat soother*. Take equal amounts of honey and cider
vinegar, stir or shake until dissolved. Take a tablespoon at a time to cut
mucous in the throat.
3. This reader writes: My grandmother swears by Apple Cider Vinegar as
an *antiseptic* for abrasions, to reduce itch from poison ivy or
mosquito bites, and even to help rehydrate sunburned skin.
4. This reader says - I hate to wear gloves when gardening (except, of
course when working with roses, blackberries or thistles) and once in a
while I get a nick or scratch. Since I shoveled most of it INTO my garden, I
know what my hands are in, and I'm 120 yards downhill from the bathroom sink
and the *disinfectant*! My trusty spray bottle of full strength *Apple
Cider Vinegar* to the rescue. Stings for a second or two until the
endorphins kick in, but I don't have to stop what I'm doing and make a
special trip back up hill. I've NEVER had an infection in a scratch since I
discovered this trick.
5. Another reader wrote: I am *allergic to crabs*. However, I love
them. I have found that when I dip my crabmeat in Apple Cider Vinegar, I
don't get an allergic reaction. This may not work for everyone, but it works
for me.
6. 1 tsp cider vinegar with one tsp honey taken three times daily
helps with *arthritis*. It dissolves the crystal deposits of uric acid
that form between joints (and also in muscles as with muscular rheumatism).
Also dissolves osteophytes (bony spurs) over long periods.
7. Apple Cider Vinegar in drinking water is very effective in
eliminating the *low-grade fevers* that are present in Chronic Fatigue
sufferers. It also helps eliminate the 'thrush' coating in the mouth, which
is sometimes caused by antibiotic use. Mix four tablespoons of apple cider
vinegar to a gallon of drinking water. Drink up to one gallon each day.
8. From another reader: After years of suffering from *athlete's foot*,
consulting doctors, and spending hundreds of dollars on so called cures
(some prescription, some over the counter), I read in one of the magazines
in which I subscribe to try soaking in Apple Cider Vinegar. Something was
said about it changing skin ph so that the fungus could not grow. I soaked
three evenings in a row. Now, no more *fungus* and that have been
several months ago.
9. Medicine for *toe nail fungus* can be very costly, but you can use
one part Apple Cider Vinegar to one part warm water and soak your feet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Another reader writes: My daughter had toe nail fungus, causing the nail to
">

grow up instead of out, like it should. I started putting a few drops of
Apple Cider Vinegar on it several times a day. To my amazement, her nail is
almost normal again! Try this one, for those who have the above problem, it
really works!

1. Use 2 cups of cider vinegar in the tub to soak *sore muscles* and
add potassium to muscles.
2. And this one: A nurse told me molds grow in humidifiers used in
sick rooms. After a couple of days' use, she rinsed out a humidifier, then
refilled it, adding maybe 1/4 cup Apple Cider Vinegar. She would run this
for a couple of minutes in the bathroom, with the door closed and the window
open, to kill the *molds*. Then she'd rinse it, run it again with just
clear water, rinse that, and declare it fit for service again. She was also
adamant about not just pouring more water in to refill, but rinsed the
reservoir out each time to retard growth of nasty stuff she didn't want
spraying all around the sick room.
3. Quite often *muscle cramps*, or 'charlie horse', are caused by too
low a level of potassium. I take a tsp. of Apple Cider Vinegar when
suffering from a muscle cramp to quickly bring my potassium level back up
and relieve the cramp.
4. When making soup stock (as all good frugal-ites do), squirt in a
tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar, to help *leach* (extract) all the
calcium from the bones being used. There's no Apple Cider Vinegar taste, and
most of us can certainly use the additional calcium.
5. It's never failed me yet: Mix two tablespoons of apple cider
vinegar with one cup of honey and store this mixture in an air-tight
container. Anytime you have *trouble drifting off*, take two teaspoons
of this mixture and you'll drift off in less than a half hour. And you won't
be groggy in the morning like over-the-counter sleep aids.
6. A teaspoon of Apple Cider Vinegar relieves *hiccups* more
effectively than anything else, including lemon juice or sugar...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Another reader writes: I've found that gargling with cider vinegar will stop
">

the most horrible case of hiccups!

1. I find mixing 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon honey
in 8 oz of warm water and drinking before I go to bed has helped eliminate
those *awful night leg cramps*
2. When the weather changes and the *sinus* start running I get that
nagging *cough*, I simply take 2 tablespoons of any kind of Apple
Cider Vinegar and that nasty cough stops.
3. I have a history of having problems with *boils* and bear the *
scars* of them. They are quite painful and at times have had to have
them lanced. A few people in my family told me about Apple Cider Vinegar
tea. One tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar, one tablespoon honey mixed in a
cup of hot water at least twice a day has dissolved more than one of my
boils. Not only the Apple Cider Vinegar tea but also, the recommended daily
amount of water. *Stay away from sodas and chocolate*, as they seem to
aggravate the infected area even more. If the boil does come to a head where
it is going to open continue to drink the Apple Cider Vinegar tea and the
water. Use hot packs on the boil for 15-20 minutes three times a day. Doing
this has more than once saved an unwanted visit to the doctor. What is also
important is not to squeeze a boil. I hope this will help someone out there.

4. Soak (rinsed and dried) egg shells in Apple Cider Vinegar until
they dissolve. Dilute with water, and drink your (very easy to assimilate)
*calcium supplement*. Oyster shells can also be dissolved in Apple
Cider Vinegar until dissolved, then drunk, for a calcium supplement. [Pearls
may be dissolved also, but this is not very frugal ;-) ]
5. When *taking calcium-magnesium tablets/or powder*, wash it down
with something acidic (like Apple Cider Vinegar diluted in water), so that
it will dissolve the cal-mag, so that your body can assimilate it.

*Any time you take vinegar internally, be sure to rinse your mouth with
plain water. Acid remaining on teeth will eventually (over time), dissolve
your teeth, as it does with calcium deposits around the sink. [I never
thought of my teeth as calcium deposits, but, hmmm, I guess they are...like
my bones...]*

1. We use 1/2 tsp white distilled Apple Cider Vinegar to 1 tbsp
rubbing alcohol to prevent swimmers ear.
2. Strange as it sounds, Apple Cider Vinegar soothes the *itching and
burning of hemorrhoids*. Just take a cotton ball and dab the affected
area with full strength apple cider vinegar! Caution: some people find the
full strength solution stings. If this happens to you, just dilute the Apple
Cider Vinegar half and half with water.
3. *Sunburn Remedy*:
- At bedtime, cover sunburns with a towel soaked in water and
Apple Cider Vinegar and try to persuade the victim to sleep this way.
Younger ones, of course, will have a struggle with this,
especially because
of the smell!
- Put Apple Cider Vinegar in a spray bottle and spray on
sunburn. It soothes for quite a length of time. Just like store bought
stuff.
- A reader wrote this: I used this on my son when his legs were
sunburned. I used half and half, which were half water and half
Apple Cider
Vinegar. I saturated tea towels in it and layer them on his legs
and he said
it didn't smell too good but it sure took out the burning. You
must do this
several times but it works and then it gives you a nice tan.
- Apple Cider Vinegar will take the sting out of a sunburn -
just soak a paper towel and apply to burn. Smells bad but, hey,
if you're in
pain, who cares?
- To relieve swelling and fluid from too much sun, mix a paste
of baking soda and apple cider vinegar and apply. This reader
says it will
draw out the fluid.

1. Apple Cider Vinegar is extremely effective on *yeast infections*.
When I get an infection, I pour about 1 cup of Apple Cider Vinegar in my
douche bottle and finish filling with warm water. I douche twice daily and
in about 2 days my infection is gone. The Apple Cider Vinegar smell leaves
in about an hour.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Another reader writes: I have found that the Apple Cider Vinegar bath also
">

cures yeast infections, not only mine but also my infant daughter. My
midwife suggested the Apple Cider Vinegar bath while I was pregnant and it
cured it and hasn't come back since. Twice daily and in about two days it's
gone.

1. I nurse my daughter who has *extremely sensitive skin*. It seems
that every time I turn around, I have eaten something that breaks her out. I
started giving her Apple Cider Vinegar baths. I run her bath water and pour
about a cup of apple cider vinegar in. It has been weeks now and her skin is
smoother than it has ever been.
2. Put 1/2 cup into a pan to *soak your feet* in before a pedicure. It
softens your skin.
3. I have seen many posts about using Apple Cider Vinegar on a
sunburn. When I *burn* myself when cooking I splash some Apple Cider
Vinegar on a bit of paper towel and put it on the burn. It stops hurting
immediately and if you keep it on, you will not develop a blister.
4. We use Apple Cider Vinegar on *wasp/yellowjacket stings*. Just soak
a cotton ball in cider vinegar and hold to the sore spot (can tape it on
with bandage tape). Within a few minutes the *pain stops*. It would
work on bee stings too, only you'd probably need to get the stinger out.
5. I have been dealing with a problem of symptoms of *irritable bowel
syndrome*. If I sip water with apple cider vinegar during the day,
those symptoms disappear. It works for me and would certainly be worth a try
for those who experience this distressing problem.
6. My great grandmother swore by Apple Cider Vinegar for almost
everything. Two uses that I have tried and had great success with.

For a *stiff neck*, take a half Apple Cider Vinegar half warm water solution
and soak a rag in it, then wring the rag out and wrap it around your neck.
Put a layer of plastic wrap (to keep your sheets dry) and finish up with a
towel (be careful not to strangle yourself). Leave this on over night and in
the morning you will not believe the difference.

For *bruises and swelling* follow the directions above, but use cold water.
You can hold the &quot;compress&quot; in place with an ace bandage. leave on for at
least an hour, but the longer you leave it the better the results. I have
personally used this long after ice was effective for reducing the swelling
and it works like a miracle.

1. I suffer from *migraines* and take Imitrex for them. When I don't
have any on hand I use Apple Cider Vinegar and it always helps me. May not
be the cause for everyone though. I take a wash cloth and put water and
Apple Cider Vinegar on it and put it over my forehead. Seems to work great
for me. If you suffer from migraines it is worth a try.

An old fashioned remedy for any *headache* was to soak brown paper with
cider vinegar and apply it to the forehead. Possibly something about
breathing the fumes helps in some cases, anyway.

1. Being a scuba diver for many years I swear by Apple Cider Vinegar
to remove the *sting of a jellyfish*.
2. Soak a cotton ball or piece of paper towel in Apple Cider Vinegar,
place it on the *aching tooth*... bite down - in moments the toothache
is temporarily gone, *giving you time to get to a dentist*.
3. Many elderly people with *high cholesterol* have tried this drink
with much success.
Recipe:
- 2 cups of grape juice
- 1 cup of apple juice
- 1/4 cup of Apple Cider Vinegar

Mix together and take 2 ounces before your largest meal everyday; only 2
ounces is needed for results.

1. Taking a little bit of Apple Cider Vinegar with or just before
meals isolates the *fat in food* and it passes through your system. I
learned this a diet clinic. it works really great.
2. A couple of years ago I was suffering from a very *stubborn
infection* in both of my ears. My ear doctor tried several
antibiotics, but to no avail. Cultures of the infection showed strong
resistance to most antibiotics, including Cipro. Eventually they had me on a
regimen of intravenous injections (which I had to do myself 3 times a day),
and a nurse would periodically come to my home and change the vein into
which I would inject the antibiotic. This was all very nerve wracking.

That didn't seem to be making much progress, but my doctor learned of an ear
specialist who apparently had a regimen that seemed effective in solving
tough ear infections. Ironically, the night before I went to see this
doctor, my dear old mother-in-law tried to convince me to try using a Apple
Cider Vinegar ear wash. Seems she had a book on &quot;miracle&quot; uses for Apple
Cider Vinegar. Can you guess what the Phoenix doctor's special regimen was?
Apple Cider Vinegar and water! Use any Apple Cider Vinegar, white is fine,
and mix in equal amounts with water. Warm slightly so you don't screw up
your equilibrium by putting cold water in your ear. Be sure not to make it
too warm. Get an ear flush bulb and flush the affected ear 2 -3 times with
the mixture twice a day.

In a few days my infection was history!

1. For those *very painful &quot;Charlie Horses&quot; and muscle cramps*, use
half Apple Cider Vinegar and half water, on a wet towel. Heat in microwave
20 seconds and place on pained area. It works great.
2. I am 49 years old and have suffered with very severe
*headaches*since I was a young girl. I have tried many medications and
remedies, but
this simple and inexpensive thing can relieve the pain, sometimes within
minutes. I usually lie down and rest, or try to nap, after doing this, but
it's surprising how fast and effectively it works: Bring a small saucepan of
water to a boil. Remove from heat and add 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar. Make
a &quot;tent&quot; with a bath towel over your head and breathe in the vapors, deeply
and slowly. (If it makes you cough, cut back on the Apple Cider Vinegar.) A
few minutes of doing this will cure most headaches as well as pills or
shots.
3. I have *psoriasis and my skin is very dry*. After I have showered,
I sprit all over with a spray bottle filled with 3 parts cider vinegar and 1
part water and rinse again. There is no soap residue left on my skin and I
don't feel itchy. I think it helps body odor, also.
4. I put a capful of Apple Cider Vinegar in a glass of water when I am
having *indigestion* problems. It gets rid of the gassy, bloating,
diarrhea problems. It seems to help balance the acid needed for digestion.
5. Just one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water at
meals can change your life completely. How? Apple cider vinegar contains
acedic acid, which stimulates the production of *stomach acid*. The
more stomach acid the better as it breaks down your food into smaller
molecules. The smaller the molecules the more efficiently your intestines
and liver can absorb the nutrients it needs. In the old days the stomach
would be producing acid all day long so it would be ready for meal time. But
these days when the body is stressed the stomach stops producing acid so at
meal time there's not enough acid to digest the food. This creates all kinds
of problems; indigestion, gastic reflux, IBS, bad breath, diverticulus,
fatty liver, lactose intolerance, allergies, fatigue, you name it. But just
a little bit of apple cider vinegar gets the stomach working again.
6. I thought I had *broken my ankle*. It was so bad I had to crawl on
my knee and my leg and foot were one! My grandmother told me to soak a brown
paper bag in Apple Cider Vinegar and wrap it around my foot all night.
Incredible results. The swelling had gone down two thirds and in three full
days I was walking on it again. I just knew I had to go to the doctor!
7. I have suffered for 9 years with *chronic sinus and ear and throat
infections*. I've had dozens of antibiotic treatments and corrective
surgery. One day I drank a tablespoonful of white distilled Apple Cider
Vinegar and noticed that I felt some level of relief, so I took this one
step further. I took 12 ounces of distilled water and one tablespoon of
distilled Apple Cider Vinegar and used it to rinse my sinuses. This was
painful I admit, but was desperate after nine years and I was getting
nowhere with my physicians. I did this for two weeks twice a day. Now after
10 years of pain and suffering I can tell you that I am cured . Anyone who
wishes to try what I have done please be cautious as the solution stings the
nose a little bit, but the pain quickly passes. While rinsing your sinuses
you must have your head down the water will pass through your mouth. Never
do this with your head upright as you could drown if water enters your
lungs. Please talk to your physician before doing this. I was already
familiar with salt water rinsing before substituting salt for Apple Cider
Vinegar.
8. One of our managers at the steel mill where I work as the Safety
Supervisor had told me that for years he had been using a Apple Cider
Vinegar soaked cloth for quick relief and *disinfections of lime or
alkali burns*. In the steel making furnace facilities, lime is a very
commonly used product and employees are regularly getting minor skin burns
from exposure to the lime dust. Apple Cider Vinegar's natural acidic
properties help neutralize the pH of the skin when an alkali material causes
a caustic burn.
9. When I got my belly button pierced a year ago, the artist told me
that if it got infected to warm up some Apple Cider Vinegar and soak my
belly button in it. A few months later, I actually did get a little
infection and after soaking my belly in Apple Cider Vinegar, the infection
left. I only had to soak it about three times!
10. I recently got my *nose pierced*. I was running out of the bottle
antiseptic medicine the piercing saloon gave me. I started to use Apple
Cider Vinegar to clean the piercing and the ring in it. I only used it after
I ran out of the bottle and used after about a month and a half of my
piercing. I still use it for daily cleaning. It works great. I don't think
people should replace the antiseptic stuff, but using Apple Cider Vinegar in
a pinch or for daily cleaning, or spot infections could help them out. I
thought it was infected at one point and I went to the school Dr. She said
it wasn't and that using Apple Cider Vinegar to clean the piercing really
couldn't hurt me and it might have helped. Remember any person who gets
pierced should follow the instructions of a qualified piercer or their
doctor.
11. Our son had a *wart* starting to grow near the cuticle of his
finger and it was actually starting to go under his nail. After putting
apple cider vinegar on a band-aid and wrapping it on the finger for about
one week, the wart was gone and never grew back. Place a new apple cider
vinegar band-aid on the wart each night.
12. My mother drinks this Apple Cider Vinegar recipe every day and
does not have *high cholesterol*. My aunt had very high cholesterol
and tried a prescription drug for it. The drug caused some liver problems
and she had to stop taking it. Then she tried this recipe and lowered her
cholesterol by 40 points. We don't think the juices do anything special,
they just make the Apple Cider Vinegar palatable.
13. If you douse your *cold sore* repeatedly with Apple Cider Vinegar
it will dry up the cold sore and eventually prevent further outbreaks.
14. One of our managers at the steel mill where I work as the Safety
Supervisor had told me that for years he had been using a Apple Cider
