Can someone please tell me just what the smell is that
seems to accompany almost all very old pianos?
My old Square Grand only has a faint tinge of it - which
saddens me a bit, since I quite like it. Seems all the old
pianos I grew up with in England always had it.

Hi Liz,

Could be a combination of things , moldy worn felt hammers &amp; hide glue
coupled with 100 years of lemon oil on 60 sq.ft. of piano surface ;~)))

Mike is correct about old felt, glue and polish, it creates quite a musty
smell...it's probably very dusty inside also. Many times there are rat nests /
droppings under the keys and I have found rat poison in many old pianos also. A
thorough dis-assembly and cleaning by a professional can go a long way to eliminate
the odor. I've always liked squares, what brand is yours? If you post the name and
serial number I'll look it up and tell you when it was manufactured.

"/> Mike thank you for your kind offers.
Actually I wish mine &quot;did&quot; have that smell that I remember. I had had
mine completely apart and must do it again soon since some keys don't
work again. My Pastor came over - he's the only one who would tackle
this old lady, and fixed all the non working keys it had when I got
it. He showed me how to fix them, and he tuned it. He was the only
person I could find who actually knew how. While he was here we took
it completely apart and cleaned it out. Grease, grease more grease and
cat hair. Inside and out. Glorious bright gold wood and metal inside.
When I got it - from my daughter for Christmas two years ago now, it
was so dirty we thought it was black, but is now, thanks to Murphys
Oil Soap, and many scourers, a beautiful bright shiny mahogany piano.
It was made by Joseph Zech in San Francisco and is the exact copy of
one Steinway made. Before cleaning and finding the name, I didn't know
who had made it. Looked like it had spent it's life in a night club
judgingby the rings on it everywhere and that dreadful grease. Anyway,
I wrote to Steinway when I found the number and name and they kindly
sent me the year made - 1879 and a little about the history of Joseph
Zech. If I remember correctly mine was made in the first year he made
pianos. I have since seen the identical Steinway. Zech apparently
copied the case and improved the inner workings. It's too bad mine had
seen some rough times, but I had wanted one all my life - and we
finally got it at auction for just $200. All the keys are ivory of
course in are intact still. Just about 4 with some edge chips. The
pedals are almost worn completely through so it's seen some use in
early life.
She is now loved and played every single day. She has a piano scarf,
and piano baby, a pretty GWTW lamp, and appropriate family photos.
Sometimes I think she puffs up with pride dressed as she is.
I'm puffed up with pride just looking at her. I waited 60 years after
all!
Liz

The information that I have available to me (Pierce Piano Atlas) shows the following

There is no mention of a Joseph Zech and the last dated entry is 1870. It sounds like
you really love your antique square grand.

"/> Well that's what happens when you get old and addled - can't remember
anything properly. &lt;G&gt; And of course I meant to say &quot;Jacob&quot; who
indeed did build my piano and it was in 1860. This of course - after
hunting up the letter I received from Steinway. they confirmed what
you suggested from your book. They also said in the early days that
case types were frequently passed between companies, hence my finding
the identical one to mine made by Steinway.
And yes I do love my piano even tho it has seen some hard times and is
in nowhere near the shape of others I have seen before and since.
There is quite a lot about these square grands on the internet. Some
are incredibly beautiful, but of course find little favour with
pianists usually. And I can understand why. Mine, even when tuned very
well, is hard to play and the notes don't always sound when one hits
the keys in a certain way.
But for me she's perfect.

We have several customers who maintain their squares on a regular basis, in most
cases these are family heirlooms. I wish there were more people like you who love
squares because the materials and craftsmanship in them just do not exist today. I've
seen countless examples turned into tables, desks and even workbenches because the
dealers who had them could not find buyers for them. I guess people would rather put
their money into beanie babies and furniture made from sawdust.

I've had piano techs tell me that the squares are a real bear to work with and the cost
exceeds their value, any comments?

"/> You are correct Mike.
I had a terrible time finding someone who knew 1. that they are tuned
differently from other pianos, and 2. who would come out and work on
it at all. There are very few around who know about these instruments.

The only reason I was able to get this fellow is because he's a pastor
and a good friend of my son in law, who is also a pastor and he tunes
most of the Church pianos in this area of the State. So it was as a
favour only. It took him two full days all day to get it in order. Now
as more notes don't work I am planning to repair them myself after the
holidays if he will take it apart for me and afterwards tune it again.
However, since I believe this might not have been played for 50 -100
years, and was full of all kinds of stuff and filth, I can't complain.
At least it &quot;does&quot; play.
It also took 6 guys to get it off the truck. They sent four who were
unable to lift it, so waited for two more to come up here from the
valley. Then &quot;I&quot; had to tell them how to get it into the house since
they had no idea even tho they do this for a living. And I even have a
large front door. One wonders what they would do if faced with taking
it upstairs.
I have actually had people ask me if I am waiting to turn it into a
desk!
But in spite of all it took to get her here, I do wonder sometimes
what tales this old girl could tell. I imagine she has seen some wild
times in San Francisco in her younger days.
Of course I suppose many of us saw some wild times in our younger
days! Some wilder than others. &lt;G&gt;

Liz, you need to be asked to show a pic?&lt;G&gt; It is beautiful.
When you use the term &quot;square&quot; does that only mean the shape of the
piano or
is there something else that is &quot;square&quot;
which would be different from other pianos? I had one that was squared
but very simple looking not at all like yours.
Would this also have been called a &quot;square&quot; piano?

Hi Mike,

I've always been fascinated by all types of pianos, organs, and all manner of
mechanical oddities, so square grands are not difficult for me to
tune/service/rebuild. However, special tools and knowledge are required and most
tuner/techs prefer to spend their time with modern pianos. It's hard to say about
value, if you base it strictly on the retail market...it's true that squares don't
have a large following and they can be very hard to sell. On the other hand, if you
love old world handcraftsmanship as I do and our friend Liz no doubt does...then you
invest what is necessary to revive a bit of history and forget about what some
kill-joy says about value. The true value of anything is what it's worth to you, and
to me...historic pianos are priceless...they will never again be duplicated.

Ohhh! Liz...your piano is lovely, thanks for the wonderful photo. And the stool is
very nice, sometimes they can be harder to find than the pianos. It's a real pleasure
to see a square grand that is truly loved, if only there were more collectors like
you to rescue them.

"/> Thank you Maryann.
Just after getting the piano I spent days going through the internet
and finding everything I could about these things. I discovered they
are supposed to have something called a &quot;Piano Baby&quot;.
Hmm. A quick trip to ebay made it evident my piano and I would be
waiting some time for one. Then as luck would have it, just about
three days later, I was wandering around our local swap meet, and
found this one sticking out of a &quot;box lot&quot; of stuff. Very dirty she
was too. A quick $5 changed hands and she had her new home.
She seems to be made well and is nice porcelain, but has no marks at
all. Not a ceramics class product either. Umm - now I shall gather
ire from all parts, (ducking) - I painted her myself since she was
plain white with no colouring at all.
Here's a closeup. A little grainy but I just haven't learned how to
not get pics like that yet.

standards. A quick &quot;search&quot; of Square Grand Piano on the browser will
bring forth some incredibly beautiful ones with fabulously carved
legs. This design was apparently the cause of ladies with tubby legs
being said to have &quot;Piano legs&quot;.

&gt;&gt;I love your piano baby. Can you tell us about her? (Your piano is

&gt;&gt;Maryann

&gt;Thank you Maryann.
&gt;Just after getting the piano I spent days going through the internet
&gt;and finding everything I could about these things. I discovered they
&gt;are supposed to have something called a &quot;Piano Baby&quot;.
&gt;Hmm. A quick trip to ebay made it evident my piano and I would be
&gt;waiting some time for one. Then as luck would have it, just about
&gt;three days later, I was wandering around our local swap meet, and
&gt;found this one sticking out of a &quot;box lot&quot; of stuff. Very dirty she
&gt;was too. A quick $5 changed hands and she had her new home.
&gt;She seems to be made well and is nice porcelain, but has no marks at
&gt;all. Not a ceramics class product either. Umm - now I shall gather
&gt;ire from all parts, (ducking) - I painted her myself since she was
&gt;plain white with no colouring at all.
&gt;Here's a closeup. A little grainy but I just haven't learned how to
&gt;not get pics like that yet.

Hi, Elizabeth. I just wanted to let you know that your &quot;baby&quot; has a
brother, and the two kids are one of my fondest auction buys. Neither
of mine have any marks, either. They are, I think, made of chalk, and
are sort of ivory with a faint wash of burnt sienna. Recently, at
another auction (do I do anything else?) this pair turned up again in
two smaller sizes. I was tempted to buy them, but I decided to let my
wee siblings continue to think they are unique in the world. The
little boy is holding an apple, and I have them sitting on the hearth
of the bedroom fireplace. Here they are:

"/> How sweet Marshall - and thanks for the peep. Your little girl is
slightly different from mine. Mine is not filled in under the knees
and is also not chalk. Definitely some kind of fairly nice porcelain.
Mine was plain white with no colour at all on the body. That's why at
first I thought she might have been a ceramics class project, but I
think she was made by a company. She has a nice &quot;ring&quot; to her if
tapped. Since my house if pretty much all of a Victorian bent, I
painted her to match all my burgundy stuff. I shall keep a lookout for
a brother for her however, now that I have seen yours. Although my
piano doesn't exactly &quot;need&quot; any more dressing up. &lt;G&gt;

Yep. Shot from the same angle, it's easy to see the difference,
although the dress and the pose are so much alike that it's hard to
think it a coincidence. Take a look:

Anyway, your dolly is quite lovely in her burgundy dress, and slimmer
than my tot, too. In fact, Brother here is yammering something or
other about giving her his apple. There are times when I just don't
know what to do with him.

&gt; Liz, you need to be asked to show a pic?&lt;G&gt; It is beautiful.
&gt; When you use the term &quot;square&quot; does that only mean the shape of the
&gt;piano or
&gt;is there something else that is &quot;square&quot;
&gt;which would be different from other pianos? I had one that was squared
&gt;but very simple looking not at all like yours.
&gt;Would this also have been called a &quot;square&quot; piano?
&gt; Doris
&gt; (finally suckered someone in to taking it off my hands)

"/> Doris,
While they are called &quot;square&quot; they are actually oblong. I took this
pic for you this morning from upstairs so you can see what they look
like. They are sort of like a grand piano with the back curvy end
chopped off. And of course they also have a smaller keyboard but I
can't remember how many notes they are short.
They were really just a &quot;fashionable&quot; item to have in the Victorian
era, and because of tuning problems and fashion changing, lost
admirers as time went on. Also, you cannot accompany singers on these
easily so I'm told, and I cannot remember why right now, but some
musical person like pianoguy will know I'm sure.
My poor picture is grainy again. Im sorry but think you can get the
idea of how it looks.
While on my hunt for info on these I came across some very unusual
pianos on the internet. Some absolutely incredible. One I remember was
for sale and was an &quot;Upright Grand&quot; The most extraordinary looking
instrument and gorgeous.
Anyway, here's a pic from above for you...

They are very alike to be sure. That must have been a popular pose.

and his name is Butler.

OK Liz...You suggested I do a search...and I did, I came up with a really
interesting site. I think you'll enjoy it!
Here is the Home Page...

Here are a few other parts of the site I found interesting...

This picture reminded me of your piano...the legs...

&gt;Maura

"/> Yes. He's a Fawn Dane. 8 1/2 years old and has done movies and
commercials all his life. He still is on-call when needed and often is
used as a stand-in for much younger dogs who don't move as well as he.
He's also in very excellent shape for his age. Average lifespan for
them is 7 1/2 so he's already beaten the odds so far. I also have
three more boys here, but he's the only one with a job!
But when I play the piano they all line up dutifully and pretend to
enjoy it!
