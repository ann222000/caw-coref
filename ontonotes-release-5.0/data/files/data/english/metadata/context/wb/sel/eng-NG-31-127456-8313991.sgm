It suddenly occured to me the other day that I've never filked
an Eric Bogle song. Naturally, I decided to do something about
it immediately:

Rincewind's Waltzing Matilda.
TTO And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda by Eric Bogle

Now when I was a young man, I left the UU,
And I fled from all things that were frightening.
I found myself locked up, at a time or two,
And prison never involved songwriting.
But in a cell in FourEcks, a songster said &quot;Son,
&quot;Did you notice the tree your back rested upon?
&quot;I need the details, if this song's to be done.&quot;
And he kept asking me more and more.

And this guy wrote Waltzing Matilda,
Well, the Discworld version of that song,
And they sold souvenirs, while I broke down in tears,
'Cos I'm due to be hanged at the dawn.

How well I remember how happy I was,
When I levered the door off its hinges.
The Luggage rejoined me but looked odd because,
It was covered with frills and with fringes.
The watchmen were waiting, they'd primed themselves well,
My escape made a better tale for them to tell,
I was probably safer locked up in that cell,
And I wished I was back in Morporkia.

And this guy wrote Waltzing Matilda,
And he showed the first draft to a friend.
His friend read the screed, and they both agreed,
That I should have died at the end.

As I fled through the streets hoping I would survive,
I'd a rep that I wouldn't expect t'hear.
I thought my main poblem was staying alive,
Not becoming a hero of Ecksia.
So I raced with a road gang, and sheared a few sheep,
Invented Peach Nellie, extracted some yeast,
I'd deny it all if it might get me peace,
But sometimes there's no use in trying.

And that guy wrote Waltzing Matilda,
And the tune got picked up by a band,
Through the brewery door, of one thing I was sure,
It's never time for a Last Stand.

With a magic bullroarer I started the rain,
And around me the water rose higher.
Of course, up till now, they'd not needed a drain,
So I stayed in the tower to be dryer.
With the strange currents gone, we can head back to Ankh,
And those whose ancestors were from ships that sank,
Some of them came too, dragging bags 'cross the planks,
To start a new life in Morporkia.

And this guy hummed Waltzing Matilda,
As he made his way onto the quay.
I was ready to drop, so I asked him to stop,
No more Waltzing Matilda for me.

And now even though I feel safe in UU,
And hope adventure will ignore me,
I recall past exploits and realise it's true,
I'm a fall-guy in somebody's story.
So I always move quickly and try to be gone,
A reluctant hero, always called upon,
And some people ask &quot;What are you running from?&quot;
But I don't stop to answer the question.

And that guy wrote Waltzing Matilda,
And the Ecksians answer the call.
I know that it's based on the trials I faced,
But I don't understand it at all.

*

(Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda,
Who knows what a jumbuck is, anyway?
And the wizzard still asks, did he really have his billy
boiling?
Who knows what Ecksian words really say?)

Not really, beyond the website address. In fact, I've been an
absentee for so long, I'm starting to think &quot;Official&quot; may be
pushing it. (I doubt anyone who remembers me is still there.)

I had a vague recollection that in my day, non-Uni folk could
join, but checking the website, it says not. You could, I
suppose, turn up at a pub-meet anyway.

I think I may have actually gone to one, ages ago.

A pub meet'd suit me fine :)

That's an awful rendition of it and this one's not much better but the
tempo's closer to the EB ersion

Original lyrics and a midi file that plays in the background.

Or redraw her to look like Nanny Ogg, perhaps (nope, been
done)...

It was written, of course, with all due respect[1]. I believe
Mr Bogle appreciates a good parody (although what that's got
to do with my stuff I'm not quite sure). I actually got the
idea when I stumbled upon a folk music messageboard in which
he expressed his fondness for the one linked to below:

http://sniff.numachi.com/pages/tiBANDPLY2.html

[1]In fact, when I write a filk there's a good chance of it
being (as in this case) based on one of my favoritest songs
ever, because when you're as tone-deaf as I am, you have to
*really* listen to something, repeatedly, before you have any
grasp of the tune at all.
