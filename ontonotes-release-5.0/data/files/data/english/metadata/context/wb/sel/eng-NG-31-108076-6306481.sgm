Sure, why not?
Actually both Phil and Josh have terrific stand-up.But when fighting
opponants you think you are better than all around, it is BY FAR safer
to ground them then finish them.
MMA gloves are hard, and it takes one punch or shin to the face and
you lose from bleeding when you chose to fight standing.

Nice armbar.

I didn't think he'd get out of that choke, but apparently your didn't
didn't even lose any energy while being guillotined.

The choke was nothing.Josh had an arm in and the guys didn't control
his hips.
Yes you can guillotine with the arm in, but you gotta get your guard
alot higher.If he can pyramid his ass up dont waste your strength, you
are only weakening and prolly giving up mount.Besides Josh ios a wizz
at submission.i want the other guy trying to tap him.Its like Lidell
wants guys trying to punch him and Hughes wants guys shooting on
him.You are in their comfort zone.

That's pretty convincing.

But it looked too easy, you know?  Tackle and mount.  What
was the opponent's error, technically?  Bad posture, too upright?

Yup. Trying to crank a guillotine when you're mounted or almost mounted (as Josh
was moving into) is just a waste of energy...it ain't gonna happen.

Thanks for the clips, Bill....and btw...who was that ugly dude with the beanie in
Josh's corner? ;&gt;)
