WHY:      It is 12:11 am and I am tired.

Question:   Why did you waste all the effort being nasty?

If you don't know the answer, just don't answer.

Better yet: Why am I wasting all this time?

I keep trying to make OpenVMS work and be a viable

alternative to a mainframe platform. When people like

yourself waste so much time and energy being negative

and nasty, it really makes life unpleasant.

Important:  Do I really want to submit my customers to dealing

with this kind of attitude?

Especially if I get into a position where

I cannot support them and they need support

from someone else?

Those are even better questions.

I'm going to bed.

And yes, this is formatted in HTML. I'm too tired to try and format it

in plain text, and don't particularly feel like being polite to you right
now.

Go get a better e-mail client or newsreader.

-Paul

Beware of login messages and ssh - they can mess up scp and rsync
connection. I am not saying you can't use them - just make sure they are
only displayed on interactive sessions.

I didn't find providing a google link to a thread discussing what it is
that you've queried about nasty.

If you want to know about nasty, being that you are a relative newcomer
to comp.os.vms, I suggest you research one Carl J. Lydick.  While c.o.v.
sometimes gets hostile and vituperations fill the threads, it is nothing
at all like the when Carl would chime in with his castigatory vitrolic

Yes.  I didn't say that he did not offer anything to the group but he

;)

I haven't talked with Ehud in ages.  I still remember an interesting
dinner with Ehud at a DECUS event in New Orleans.  He certainly had a
way with words!

That's because I was WAY too tired last night and for some reason got
perturbed at the first line.
It is quite frustrating to have to put a presentation together when you are
too tired to be working.

My apologies to everyone.

Everyone has their bad day(s); I've had a bad lifetime.

I've been under incredible stress and strain for, at least, the past 2
years which I thought was unbearable but that was trumped in the past
month.  I've been acerbic more than my fair share of late but if you'd

If that message for SSH is different from that for normal logins,

Yes, Carl would often be helpful, even if you pissed him off big time
with an &quot;inadequately put question&quot; but followed up with a post that
met his specs.

OTOH, Carl sometimes didn't meet his own standards. He posted stuff he
didn't check (a BIG Lydick no no), posted stuff when he didn't know
what he was talking about (BACKUP/FAST for e.g.), and was informed by
one respondent about the existence of the STOP command by posting the
HELP STOP output when someone asked how to stop dead in the middle of
a nested DCL procedure. So he really ought not have been so nasty.

I remember that Carl was pissed when Ehud stopped posting (allegedly
in frustration with too many bad posts) and even named a prime
suspect!

For the record, I've been both helped and scolded by him.

Now there is a name I haven't seen in a dog's age although I still often
wonder what became of him.

One of the last times I saw Ehud in person was at one of the last national
DECUS events -- TGV was still a company then.

I heard he sold a domain name (wallstreet.com) for a significant amount of
money and is now living on easy street... figuratively.  A google search
of Ehud Gavron and wallstreet.com shoudl turn up some articles.

Yeah, Carl and I used to get into some good discussions but I always kept
him civil in our discussions.  I just had a way to do it.  But I always
thought Ehud would go big someday ....

So it's true!  That's why I don't see him on this newsgroup any more.
I believe I owe Ehud a bottle of Anchor Steam beer.  I had looked forward
to having it with him and having a good discussion of obfuscated VMS DCL
coding at the same time....

It's apparently up for sale again, only 10 days to go to the deadline.
