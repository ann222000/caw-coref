Katharine McPhee - &quot;Stuff&quot; Magazine (August 2007)

Former American Idol contestant Katharine McPhee takes the August 2007
cover of Stuff Magazine. Interview highlights via Us Weekly are below:

On dating older men (her boyfriend, Broadway actor Nick Cokas, is 42):
&quot;When I turned 21, I thought it was a good age to explore. You're no
longer a teenager, so it's OK [to date older guys]. I gravitated
toward them, and I love them. They're just wiser, and they're less
about themselves and more about you.&quot;

On her new album cover: &quot;People made a big deal out of that. They
said, 'She's a slut, blah, blah, blah.' But I'm really not showing
that much skin. It's all suggested.&quot;

On being popular with the fellas:&quot;I was prematurely developed. As a
freshman I looked like a junior; I had boobs. Some of the older kids
saw me in the yearbook and said I was cute.&quot;

On settling down: &quot;Oh yeah. I want to have, like, 15 babies. I've
always wanted to be pregnant. One year for Halloween, I decided to be
pregnant, so I got this nun costume, and I put a big belly under it. I
showed my parents and said I want to go to school as a pregnant nun.
My dad sat me down and said, &quot;Katharine, you can't!&quot;

Below are some promos for Kat's upcoming music video &quot;Love Story,&quot; out
Friday.

Don't have a problem with it - as you go with your strengths - but I'm
guessing the gloves are off as far as TPTB taking wild Sex-Kitten
swings.

The &quot;pregnant nun&quot; thing?  What ev', Kath. What ev'.

I looked up Nick Cokas' &quot;Broadway&quot; career on IBDB.

Once Upon a Mattress  [Revival, Musical, Comedy]
Performer: Nick Cokas [Ensemble];
Performer: Nick Cokas [Other Player];
Understudy: Nick Cokas [Sir Harry] - Replacement Dec 19, 1996 - Jun 1,
1997

Blood Brothers  [Original, Musical]
Performer: Nick Cokas [Ensemble] - Replacement Apr 25, 1993

He's a Broadway actor the way McPhee is a recording artist.

I think a lot of what McPhee has between her ears is empty space, just
my humble opinion on this issue.  :-)

I hope we can all be good neighbors online!

I realize what Stuff magazine is and what kind of interviews they have,
but even disregarding this one, in all of Katharine's interviews that I
have read to date, she exhibits all the depth of an onion skin. Now, mind
you, I appreciate shallowness as much as anyone, but even I get tired of
it eventually if there isn't a little bit of depth in there somewhere.
