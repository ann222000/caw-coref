Residents can get refund, new housing while agency tests for
formaldehyde-

By Alex Johnson-

MSNBC-
Updated: 6:32 p.m. CT Aug 7, 2007-
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has done an about-face and
will immediately stop using, buying and selling disaster-relief
trailers because they could be contaminated with formaldehyde.
The order, which went into effect July 31, is an interim measure while
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department
of Homeland Security's Office of Health Affairs test the air quality
in the estimated 120,000 travel trailers FEMA provided to victims of
hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005.
The agency most recently sent about 40 of the trailers to Miami,
Okla., where residents were forced out of their homes because of
flooding.

CDC workers began collecting samples last week from FEMA trailers in
Louisiana and Mississippi, where more than 56,000 trailers are still
occupied. Residents will be offered assistance finding new housing
anywhere in the country, FEMA said in an internal memo, while buyers
of surplus FEMA trailers will be offered full refunds.
&quot;Nothing is as important to FEMA and the Department of Homeland
Security as ensuring that disaster victims have a safe and healthy
place to reside during their recovery,&quot; the agency said in a
statement.

Formaldehyde is the airborne form of a chemical used in a wide variety
of products, including composite wood and plywood panels in the travel
trailers FEMA purchased after Katrina. It is considered a human
carcinogen, or cancer-causing substance, by the International Agency
for Research on Cancer and a probable human carcinogen by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
MSNBC.com disclosed in July 2006 that many of the trailers harbored
potentially harmful levels of formaldehyde, but testimony last month
before a House subcommittee revealed that FEMA was aware of the
problem several months earlier, after many of its own employees came
forward with concerns.
As recently as late last month, FEMA said it would continue using the
trailers, but congressional leaders were outraged after documents
revealed that FEMA lawyers had advised the agency to downplay the
concerns to &quot;prevent ownership of the problem&quot; and limit exposing the
agency to liability issues.

Summer heat aggravates exposure
The congressional hearing was convened last month after Sen. Mary
Landrieu, D-La., and Rep. Bobby Jindal, D-La., blasted FEMA for its
seeming disregard of occupants' complaints.
&quot;This takes the cake,&quot; Landrieu told NBC affiliate KPLC-TV of Lake
Charles. &quot;Now people living in the trailers have to worry if their
children are breathing fumes that could cause cancer or some other
disease.&quot;
Many residents say that when they have complained about the risk, FEMA
advised them to leave the windows open. But &quot;the heat makes the
formaldehyde very noticeable, and even though we've been here as long
as we have, we still notice it,&quot; said Nancy Sonnier, whose family has
been living in one of the trailers in Vinton, La., since their home
was destroyed by Hurricane Rita.
&quot;My husband and I both have some health problems that we hadn't had
prior to the storm, and when they first started I really chalked it up
to the stress,&quot; Sonnier told KPLC, describing respiratory, sinus and
intestinal problems, along with skin rashes, insomnia and headaches -
all potential signs of formaldehyde poisoning.
&quot;I usually spend my time outside,&quot; said 7-year-old Mason Sonnier,
&quot;because of that stuff that my grandma talks about.&quot;

Wouldn't work, Marv. FEMA would forget to designate someone to go back

So all the rainwater that poured in through the open windows would get
into the paneling and cause a serious mold and rot problem. Then they'd
have to deal with that.

So the manufacturer gets first to sell the trailers, then they are kept
out of the market.  He can sell more.  Neat.  Yeah, I know, it is
supposed to hurt.

In that train of thought, I read a great piece today in Sports Illustrated
online.  It was about a distance runner from Ethiopia - his name is Haile
Gebrselassie - and he is probably the best runner in the world today at
longer distances.  Anyway, here is a quote from the story with &quot;Geb&quot; talking
about what he does with his winnings when he sends that money home to
Ethiopia:

&quot;I tell them, if you want to work, I will find you work. I will give you a
job with a good wage and I will take care of you. But a man cannot improve
himself with free gifts, only with opportunity. When you find a child who
wants to learn but cannot find a good school, or a man who wants to work and
to better himself but he cannot find a job to help his family, that is where
I must help. Work builds confidence.&quot;

For the full story, which is quite a nice piece about a man who is very
inspiring, here is the link.

I kept my post short because I've gone over my opinion of government
assistance in the past and thought I might be able to avoid a rehash this
time.  Since I was wrong, here's what I was trying to say.

FEMA (and the government in general) should get completely out of the
disaster relief business. (Most disasters that is, the Feds still have a
responsibility in the case of an attack.)  That is to say, the government
should not underwrite disaster insurance (including floods), they should not
provide housing, clothing, food, or any other financial assistance to
disaster &quot;victims.&quot;  They can provide physical aide in finding the sick,
injured and dead.  They can rebuild the infrastructure.  They can provide
military assistance for security purposes.  Otherwise, they do not have any
constitutional authority to provide any aide.

Assistance to disaster victims should come from family, friends, service
groups, community groups, volunteers, and donations - not the government.
People should provide their own insurance, and if they fail to get that
insurance, they become personally responsible for the financial (and other)
losses.  It is possible that a &quot;tough love&quot; approach like that would
convince people to stop building in disaster prone areas - especially along
the Gulf Coast where they are flooded out on a regular basis.

BTW, speaking of Gulf Coast disasters, remember the warnings earlier in the
year about how bad the hurricane season would be this year?  They got it
wrong again, just like last year.  But, If I was them, I would keep
forecasting disaster - even if it takes years before disaster strikes,
everyone will forget all the times they were wrong and talk about the one
time they were right.

The job of business (aka &quot;markets&quot;) is not to &quot;operate in a manner that is
best for the individual.&quot;  It is to make a profit.  The glues and resins
they use now must be cheaper, or they would switch just for the money.

If you want them to change their business practices, convince them that
there is a market for it - even if it costs the consumer a little more.

That's just not true. Flood insurance is available and cheap if you
don't live in an area which is prone to flood. IMHO, one of the first
tests one should apply before buying a house is to price &quot;all perils&quot;
insurance. If you can't get flood insurance, any reasonably intelligent
person should know enough not to buy the house. Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh!!!

Why the hell should my taxes pay to help people who are dumb enough to
buy a house in a flood plane? And then help them again, and again, and
again, and again?

Will Sill doesn't need flood insurance, and my taxes will never pay to
bail him out after a flood.

As the government must provide the roadways upon which we driver our
RVs, FEMA must provide housing.

Even at their very worst, even at their most incompetent, government
provides services no one else will provide.  Government does things
other people don't want to do.  No one wants to fix the hole in your
road for the price you are willing to pay.  No one wants to support a
sewer system to take away your waste.  No one wants to fight your house
fire.  Government steps in and provides these services itself or through
an agency in support of government.  Saying you wish the government
would get out of emergency housing assistance is like saying you wish
the government would get out of roadway repair.  While the service can
happen, it can happen only at prices that are far more costly than that
which you now pay.

FEMA cannot get out of assisting people with housing.  A
disaster-affected person cannot get the same resources for the same
money.  It would be as if the government gave you your small percentage
of the cost of the road repair out in front of your house and ordered
you to provide that service yourself.

It would work so much more efficiently if people would get off their
rears and help but that's the nature of the beast.  We don't want to
help.  FEMA should do it.  That is a government job.

Even at their very worst, even at their most incompetent, FEMA provides
services and there isn't anyone else who will.

The second issue is that by definition a disaster is a disaster because
government does not have the resources to resolve the problem.  The City
of New Orleans could not handle a hurricane.  Suggesting they can is
illogical.  The State of Louisiana cannot handle a hurricane.
Suggesting they can is illogical.  All  their resources are used up.
They have no more.  Now add untold quantities of federal aid.  While the
aid is necessary, you add it to an area that does not have the resources
to manage it.  Things go bad.

Even at their very worst, even at their most incompetent, New Orleans
and the State of Louisiana provided services and there isn't anyone else
who will.

Tempered against the nature of the disaster, it is hard to attach blame.
We can sit and suppose but every supposition runs headlong into our
own inability to provide a solution.

&gt; Which private company is going to provide housing at a price that

&gt; The real answer is probably to require all homeowners to have

&gt; federally subsidized as no private insurers will write flood policies
&gt; at prices anyone can afford due to the high number of flood claims.

&gt; The problem with FEMA is not that they provide housing, but that they
&gt; waste a LOT of money.  How many trailers never got used for Katrina
&gt; and Rita?
">

Interesting that you put it that way, why should the government even provide
housing after a disaster, especially when they refuse to pay for it
themselves (via increased homeowners insurance) and want freebies from the
rest of us? Hell, the residents are so used to living off freebies from
everyone else in the country (MY taxes are going to provide them flood
insurance, cuz they choose to live in an area that may be underwater)....
Homeless people live all over, and you can even live in the slabs cheap..
Why do they have to be in a flood area, other than they get freebies the
rest of us pay for. I say, Mandate the private insurance companies to
provide flood insurance, and if the costs are extremely high, and if it
would cost them too much in homeowners insurance, let em move... Why should
those of us that live in NON flood prone areas have to subsidize those that
do? Then the folks can bitch about the private companies, rather than the
government.

I was going to say &quot;Name one&quot; but you went on to name roads, sewage, and
fire services.  You are aware that in times past all roads were built and
maintained locally aren't you?  However, in my original post, I accepted
infrastructure as an appropriate government service.  (I did that mostly
because there are too many people like you who think the government MUST
provide roads, not because I believe it couldn't be done without them.)
Finally, as far as roads are concerned, my opinion is that they do not
constitute a federally mandated service, but there is nothing stopping
states and municipalities from building and maintaining them.

I have lived in places with private sewer systems - paid for with the local
water bill (also provided by a private company).  You simply paid the
monthly bill to a private company, rather than to the government.  Now, what
makes you think that sewer  and water ever have to be provided by the
government?

And as to fire service, have you ever heard of volunteer fire departments?
Even more importantly, there are private fire services.  My nephew currently
works for Rural Metro Fire Department in Maricopa County AZ.  It is a
private company, subscription based, that provides fire service  (ambulance
too) for hundreds of thousands of people in AZ (I think they also have
departments in Texas and possibly Florida, but don't care enough to look it
up for you.)  And unless things have changed in recent years, they provide
service to Scottsdale AZ, a city that chose to contract with Rural Metro,
rather than start its own fire department.  And if you check, you will find
out that Scottsdale is a very ritzy town, and could afford the best fire
department there is if it provided more than Rural metro does.

And he (your disaster affected person) should not have waited until there
was a disaster victim to start seeking those resources.  he should have
gotten insurance, stockpiled some food and water, and made arrangements for
his own care BEFORE the disaster struck.  As I said elsewhere, if you cannot
afford the insurance, you cannot afford to live there.  If you cannot get
insurance, either move or suffer the consequences on your own, don't ask the

The city of New Orleans could not handle the problem because they chose to
be unprepared.  They built below sea level and encouraged more people to
move into an area that was incapable of being defended from a disaster.
They had crooked politicians who skimmed money from various projects rather
than having the levees built to maximum potential.  They had rotten law
enforcement who let crime get so bad that people feared leaving their homes
during a flood, for fear that nothing would be left when they returned.
They had an incompetent mayor and crooked politicians at all levels - New
Orleans was a man made disaster and expecting the government to fix it is
illogical and stupid.

The #1 reason businesses resisted both of these is money.  Bars and

&gt; I've even suggested that they leave my road alone, and &quot;maintain&quot; twice

Damn troublemaker.  The manual says roads will be maintained equally;
traffic count has nothing to do with it.  Get rid of those Bolshevik
tendencies to do things differently than they've always been done.  If
the rules were good enough for your daddy, they're good enough for you.

&gt; I'm just thankful that common sense won out and that, in the

&gt; else's smoke has generally come to supercede the smoker's &quot;right&quot; to
&gt; smoke.

Then common sense also says that a person who doesn't want to smell
someone's cologne, perfume or after shave should have the right to have
those who indulge in various scents banned from the premises.

Don't I have the right to breathe unpolluted air while dining?  I demand
a law that all diners be sniffed and turned away if they stink of perfumes.

So if safety measures and regulations are a good thing, we should have
more of them, right?

1.  No one not in perfect health can drive.

2.  No one may smoke.  Period.

3.  No one will wear perfumes, cologne or after shave to protect those
with allergies.

4. The speed limit will henceforth be 20 MPH.

5.  All automobiles will use heavy materials and not weigh less than
5,000 lbs.

6.  Use of highways will be limited to alternate days to avoid heavy
traffic.  License plates beginning with even numbers can drive on even
days of the month and those with odd numbers on odd days.

7.  No cell phones allowed in cars.  Period.

8.  Good looking wimmen must wear veils and canvas bags during daylight
hours.

9.  All hunting must be done with blank cartridges.

10.  Passenger-carrying aircraft must have a minimum of 4 wings and 10
engines, carry parachutes and life vests.

When you have those safety measures in place, call and I'll have more
that need implementing.  We don't want people risking their lives
unnecessarily.
