Now that the Google Summer of Code is presumably over,
I am curious to know what new software has been written
for Plan 9 and Inferno.  Could someone post a list of the
projects that happened, with one-line of summary,
one-line of status, and a pointer to the code?

Thanks.

the inferno plugin for firefox is started, nothing that could be used.
The student ceased working time ago although he promised to get back to work
again in october. No code to try out yet.

it didn't improve.  it is bad. meanwhile, you can explore from http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code-2007-p9/
(Downloads and Links, esp the blog) to get some idea.  one project is missing from Downloads, i see.
briefly, the inferno-related ones are being incorporated into the distribution,
sometimes causing big changes.
(one includes plan 9 components to be submitted as patches.)

possibly students or mentors can comment on the precise status of others.

many of the projects were arguably too big for a summer or just too hard
(qemu's implementation in particular is rather shall we say challenging), BUT
strangely, many of those were completed, and some of the simpler, more
manageable  ones failed (and some of those were surprising).

i'd say more but this is too tedious at the moment.
traceroute suggests roadworks in DFW area, severe delays possible.

Inferno on Nintendo DS :-)

http://homepage.mac.com/leimy2k/movies/inferno-ds.MP4

Needs some attention, the SPI and IPC for the ARM7/ARM9 CPUs to get touch
screen working etc could be at fault according to Noah.  I've had very
little time to look, but the code still builds to the state in the video :-)

inferno/plan9 on cell :-(

Too big a project, too little time from me, and me not putting enough
pressure on the student.
Should probably have gone straight to inferno instead of trying to
get the Cell mmu up.

The MMU is coming up now, but there's a pile more distance to go.
I'm not sure when I'll next have time to look at; I'm having to come
up on a radically different piece of hardware in the next few months,
so it's likely to fall off my hobby queue.

I confess to being impressed by the Plan 9 port to OLPC. I did the
first BIOS for this machine and I kind of appreciate the difficulties
-- which start with no VESA mode. I'm going to download it and try it
out. I think it's a nice job, esp. in one summer.

Congrats to ameya.

thanks

The port is nowhere even near complete, it barely boots, there is
still a *lot* left to do, unfortunately my inexperience with the
workings of gsoc combined with having to take care of administration
work meant I'm afraid I didn't do a very good job mentoring this
project, I still hope that we can keep working on it and that we have
learned to do better next year.

Best wishes

One addendum, the touch screen works under an emulator. However the
IPC data structure that I borrowed(stole) from the libnds code fails
to update on real hardware. The devkitpro(arm gcc toolchain for the
ds) code loves to use all sorts of gcc optimization and weirdness so
this isn't too strange looking back. Charles gave me some very good
advice on how to set it up with interrupts and I'll try to set things
up that way once I get my current responsibilities out of the way.

I have just posted to my blog on gsoc.cat-v.org an update on the final
status of my project, as well as some thoughts on how GSoC went for me.

I know this is late, but I was away until the weekend. I hope it is of
interest to someone.
