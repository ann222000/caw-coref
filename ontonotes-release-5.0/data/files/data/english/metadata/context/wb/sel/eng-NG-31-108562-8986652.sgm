The November 2007 issue of Australian PC Authority has an article on
&quot;band aid&quot; fixes for PC problems.

Sounds more like a Degaussing problem to me with &quot;Large discolored
patches. The Shaking image is likely due to a transient 60 cycle field
from a nearby Fan or a transformer. Hitting the side of the case will
always solve the problem. If you hit it hard enough! Just protect
yourself from  the flying glass.

I'd suspect that the phosphors would be randomly scattered, probably
at the bottom of the glass, in which case the monitor would need to be
returned to the factory so that they could be glued back on.

There is a sort of cosmic synchronicity on this newsgroup whereby the posts
that are meant to be funny are often taken seriously and many plonkingly
serious posts are inadvertently hilarious.

Actually it was due to a large Blower-Fan  motor in the Lab next door, I
would guess that the fields would vary with the load on the fan.

I now look in the labs, above, below, behind and beside the Monitors in
question. The real solution is a LCD monitor, That is the only solution
in a room with Huge magnets for Mass Spectrometers and NMR work !!

I first saw the transformer effect working on a Commodore Pet computer,
It took a few minutes to solve until  I realized why the problem would
go away when I propped open the cabinet to see if I could see the problem.
