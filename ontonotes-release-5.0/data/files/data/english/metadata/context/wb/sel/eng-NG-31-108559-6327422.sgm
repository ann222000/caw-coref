Hello Group?

I am looking for the components, tuning fork, frequency of 502.5,
532.5......802.5hz range for maritime radio beacons. If anyone share a
information about, who makes, where can I order..., I will be
appreciated very much.

Thanks,
HWLEE

Musical tuning forks may get you close for some of the frequencies. They
should be available in frequencies 440Hz * 2^(n/12) where n is a whole
number (positive, zero, or negtive -- within reason).

For example:

A is 440.00Hz
A# is 466.16Hz
B is 493.88Hz
C is 523.25Hz
C# is 554.37Hz
and so on.

However, I'm having a hard time finding chromatic sets (separated by the
12th root of 2 ratios) that are anything wider than from 261.6Hz to 523.3Hz.
Here's a link:

You could probably trim them to get the exact frequency you wanted, but I'm
not sure how well this would work.

Are you sure you really want tuning forks ?

What kind of radio beacons are in the 500Hz range?

I think the poster is missing the "K" for KHz.

Whether or not he actually needs tuning forks, at least up there they'd
be of reasonable size.

Just curious.  Is there some reason you don't use an oscilloscope to
determine the frequency rather than a tuning fork??

Whether you mean Hz or kHz, wouldn't you be better off using DSP or some
other signal processing method that's more compact (and precise) than a
bunch of tuning forks?

What, exactly, are you trying to do?

That's interesting.  I was reading "tuning fork" as in a frequency determining
device. Don't some clocks (as in for reading time) use things referred to
as "tuning forks" instead of crystals for keeping accurate time?

Those frequencies look like old pager or tone squelch fregencies.
Motorola, Bramco and Ledex made the "reeds", which were mecahnicaly
tuned, frequency selective relays.  A simpler system was used for RC
control, years ago.

Can't help you there, I know nothing about fancy clocks.  I only have
the cheap ones that either use the 60 cycle method or a crystal oscillator.

The Bulova Accutron used a tiny metal tuning fork with coils, in an
oscillator.

You might be thinking of "tuning fork" crystals, were the
crystal itself is in the shape of a tuning fork - that's how they
can fit a 32.768KHz crystal into a can about the size of a tic-tac.

There are such things as tunable tuning forks. I have seen them
demonstrated. Moveable weights on the tines change the frequency. Here
is one example, although an expensive one:

Well, I guess if you need a machine to "align your brain waves", money is
no object. ;-)
