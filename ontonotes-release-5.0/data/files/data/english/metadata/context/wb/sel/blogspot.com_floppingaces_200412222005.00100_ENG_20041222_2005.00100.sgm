The Mosul Bombing  &  The Media
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>Found a really great blog from Cassandra at Villainous Company about
the horrible bombing and this eyewitness account from a Chaplain at the
base Regardless of what some may say, these are not stupid people. Any
attack with casualties will naturally mean that eventually a very large
number of care givers will be concentrated in one location. They took
full advantage of that. In the middle of the mayhem the first mortar
round hit about 100 to 200 meters away. Everyone started shouting to get
the wounded into the hospital which is solid concrete and much safer
than being in the open. Soon, the next mortar hit quite a bit closer
than the first as they "walked" their rounds toward their intended
target...us. Everyone began to rush toward the building. I stood at the
door shoving as many people inside as I could. Just before heading in
myself, the last one hit directly on top of the hospital. I was standing
next to the building so was shielded from any flying shrapnel. In fact,
the building, being built as a bunker took the hit with little effect.
However, I couldn't have been more than 10 to 15 meters from the point
of impact and brother did I feel the shock. That'll wake you up! I
rushed inside to find doctors and nurses draped over patients, others on
the floor or under something. I ducked low and quickly moved as far
inside as I could. You really need to read the whole blog, it's quite
powerful and moving. Cassandra adds: want everyone reading this to stop
and think about this for just one second. Let it sink in. Someone was
sitting out there coolly targeting, not combatants, but a hospital.
We've heard a lot of weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth about Abu
Gharaib and Guantanamo Bay. About the Geneva Convention, which doesn't
even cover non-signatories. About the International Torture Convention
which, though ratified by Congress in 1994, was also limited by
Congress' deliberate refusal to implement a critical provision of the
convention prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment" -- a fact the media steadfastly refuses to report. Yet here
we have "insurgents" deliberately and cold-bloodedly targeting our
wounded and medical personnel, and our media are....silent. Where is the
lurid, Abu-Gharaib-style tabloid coverage? Why isn't this front-page
news? It never will be front page news with MSM we have. If it doesn't
involve evil americans then its not news. The terrorists are really
"insurgents" to them, give me a effin break. From covering up Saddam's
crimes, to refusing to report the reams of good news from Iraq and
Afghanistan, to forging documents to try and sway an election, to
misquoting the administration time and time again, the media have gone
out of their way to slant the public perception of current events. It
needs to stop. Which side are you on? Ours? Or theirs? We'll be waiting
for your answer. They have always been on the side of the anti-american
since the 60's, will it ever turn back? I can't see it happening. Not
with the liberal jackass professors that permeate our college campuses
teaching the next generation. It will be up to us to make sure this kind
of stuff does not go unnoticed....we need to keep this kind of
information in the public eye. That is our mission. Belmont Club has a
good post on this plus a link to Mark Glaser who stated the following:
For way too long, it has been the mainstream media (MSM) that's played
God with the American public, telling everyone what's news and what's
not, what to play up and what to downplay. But 2004 was the year the
power started shifting, that the Little People, if you will, started to
tell the gods of media what the public really wanted. Amen!</P>
