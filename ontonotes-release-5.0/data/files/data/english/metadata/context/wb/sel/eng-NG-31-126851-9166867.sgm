Attorney-General set to scupper plans to make gay hate a crime

Richard Ford and Frances Gibb

Government plans to criminalise the stirring up of hatred against gays
and lesbians are in disarray because of a Cabinet split over the need
for such a law.

The split – between Baroness Scotland of Asthal, the Attorney-General,
and Jack Straw, the Justice Secretary – are likely to scupper plans
for a new offence.

Baroness Scotland has privately expressed concern about the
controversial legislation proposed by Mr Straw, The Times has learnt.

Mr Straw announced the plans last month with the backing of Harriet
Harman, the Equalities Secretary. He had said that he would bring
forward an amendment to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill this
month to extend the law that already protects religious and racial
groups, carrying up to seven years in jail.

He had also said that he would listen to views about whether the
incitement offence should be extended further to cover hatred against
disabled and transgendered people.

But Baroness Scotland, who is also determined to crack down on the
problem of homophobic behaviour, believes that there are sufficient
laws on the statute book to deal with the issue.

She also has concerns about the difficulities of getting the proposal
through the House of Lords, which gave a rough ride to measures on
incitement to religious hatred and substantially watered them down.

She is understood to have told colleagues that she wants to see more
successful prosecutions in this area, but is unconvinced that a new
law is the way to do it and would prefer to focus on existing
procedures.

It is the second time in recent weeks that ministers' plans have
failed to win the support of Baroness Scotland, the country's senior
law officer.

Last week The Times reported that she believed the case had not been
made for extending the time that terror suspects can be held before
charge.

Mr Straw's plan was to mirror the offence of incitement to religious
hatred. The amendment would cover hatred and invective directed at
people on the basis of their sexuality. Ministers insist that it would
not prohibit criticism of gay and bisexual people but protect them
from incitement to hatred because of their sexual orientation.

But, despite strong backing from bodies such as Stonewall, the
campaigning group for gay rights, the proposals have caused
controversy and been condemned as a threat to freedom of speech,
including from some prominent homosexuals.

Matthew Parris, the Times columnist, wrote that &quot;some groups may be so
weak and fragile as to need the law's protection from hateful speech.
I'd like to think that we gays are no longer among them.&quot;

In a letter to The Times this month, Rowan Atkinson, the actor,
criticised the plans, saying that society was &quot;working things out&quot;
without the need for any &quot;legislative interference&quot;. He was concerned
about the &quot;extendable&quot; nature of the legislation not just to the
disabled and transsexuals but to anyone else who could claim that they
could not help the way they are. &quot;Men, for example. Or women. Or
people with big ears.&quot;

There were warnings that the move could mean that vicars would face a
threat of jail for preaching from the Bible; others said that gay
rights were being given priority over Christian values and would be
used to silence those with strong Christian beliefs.

Most police forces now record hate crimes and the Crown Prosecution
Service already deals with hate crime by scrutinising cases for a
racial, religious, homophobic or transphobic element. Special &quot;hate
crime panels&quot; are to be introduced after the success of a hate crime
scrutiny panel in West Yorkshire, which two weeks ago won an award for
its work.

The panel, which includes members of the &quot;hate crime partnerships&quot; in
the area such as Stop Hate UK and Bradford Hate Crime Alliance, has
seen a rise in the prosecution of hate crimes in the area and a fall
in the failure rate.

Courts in England and Wales already have the power to impose tougher
sentences for offences that are motivated or aggravated by a victim's
sexual orientation.

Freedom of speech v hate crime

&quot; One can't help thinking, with legislation of this nature, that the
point at which it becomes politically possible for it to be enacted,
is precisely the point when it becomes unnecessary. The ease which
some people move from finding something offensive to wishing to
declare it criminal – and are then able to find factions within
government to aid their ambitions – is truly depressing&quot;

Rowan Atkinson

&quot;Some groups may be so weak and fragile as to need the law's
protection from hateful speech. I'd like to think we gays are no
longer among them&quot;

Matthew Parris

&quot;We will soon be in the bizarre position whereby two recent pieces of
legislation designed to prevent 'hate crimes' taking place actually
contradict one another. A Muslim who espouses one of its fundamental
tenets – that homosexuality is wicked and a sin – might find himself
banged up by the Old Bill for inciting homophobic hatred. And if I
were then to say what I believe – that, partly because of its attitude
towards gay people, Islam is a vindictive, bigoted and repressive
ideology – then I might be banged up, too. This is surely ludicrous&quot;

Rod Liddle

&quot;If someone is reading the Bible and calls homosexuality an
abomination is that going to be incitement?&quot;

Massoud Shadjareh of the Islamic Human Rights Commission

&quot;In a democratic society people must be free to express their beliefs
without fear of censure from the state. A homophobic hatred law would
be used by those with an axe to grind against Christians to silence
them.&quot;
