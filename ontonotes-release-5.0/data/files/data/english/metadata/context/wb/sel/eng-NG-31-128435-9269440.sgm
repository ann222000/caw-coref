Dear Current  and Potential Kucinich Supporters:
Dennis Kucinich is by far the strongest and  best qualified candidate with
the best platform who has ever run for president.  He knows what needs to be
done and has the character, courage, integrity,  intelligence, experience and
drive to get it done. Kucinich is for the people,  does not take corporate money
and is not beholden to corporate executives or  lobbyists. He has plans to end
the war in Iraq, provide health care for  everyone, “put America to work”,
replace Bush and Cheney, etc.
If you are not convinced of this, please review  the attached comparison of
presidential candidates’ positions on key issues and  review Kucinich records
and proposed approaches at www.dennis4president.com and _ www.vafordennisk.org._
( http://www.vafordennisk.org./ )
If you are from  Virginia, please:
1. Obtain  signatures on the attached petition to place Kucinich on the
Ballot for the  February 12, 2008, Virginia Presidential Primary and encourage
others to obtain  signatures. (Please see the instructions below for gathering
signatures on  petitions and forwarding the petitions on.)
2. Volunteer to  help build a statewide team/network/organization of Dennis
supporters and become  a Kucinich coordinator for your neighborhood, precinct,
district, town and/or  city by sending an email with your name, email address,
mail  address with Zip code, phone numbers and the area that you would like
be the  coordinator in to _D ... @aol.com,_ (mailto:D ... @aol.com,) ,
_vafordenn ... @gmail.com,_ (mailto:vafordenn ... @gmail.com,)  and
_nmaynard22 ... @comcast.net_ (mailto:nmaynard22 ... @comcast.net)  and when you have time  please complete

If you are not  from Virginia, please find the coordinator for your state or

help  them.
