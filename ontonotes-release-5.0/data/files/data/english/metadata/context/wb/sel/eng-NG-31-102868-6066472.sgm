This is one of my favourite birds and I never get tired watching it. It's
usual behaviour seems to be to choose an overhanging branch or ledge in a
bank a few feet above the water, and a quick dash into it when it spots some
interesting snack under the water surface.

On Sunday, however, I saw another act from this little fellow's bag o'
tricks. On this day, it chose branches that were 10 feet or more above the
water's surface and some distance away from what eventually turned out to be
its attack areas. Then it would pick a spot and in a manner more associated
with its bigger cousin (Pied Kingfisher), it would hover and plop into the
water in an attempt to grab a snack. My shots do not do justice to what I
saw, and as I stood there with my mouth open, occasionally pretending to be
a bush or an Indian Robin to sneak in a photo or two, it had me thrilled for
over half an hour, after which, having grabbed some breakfast, it decided to
change its haunts.

A question for experts: how do hovering kingfishers pick their attack
points? With a pied kingfisher perched on a high wire, they would be able to
see into the water till some fair distance away from the bank. But if they
are sitting lower down, even a couple of feet away from the bank the water
seems too reflective to see into. Do they pick their spots purely by
sighting fish (perhaps by getting their eyes to function as polarizers), or
based on bubbles/ripples, or with ability to see outside the visible
spectrum (I have read the kestrels have this last ability)? Or is it just
based on seeing movement under water by choosing a suitable spot.

The file-count crosses delhibirdpix's limits, but most of them are tiny
files with measly crops, just to demonstrate this behaviour.
