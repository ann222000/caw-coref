Tighter Border Delays Re-entry by U.S. Citizens

By JULIA PRESTON
The New York Times

EL PASO — United States border agents have stepped up scrutiny of Americans
returning home from Mexico, slowing commerce and creating delays at border
crossings not seen since the months after the Sept. 11 attacks.

The increased enforcement is in part a dress rehearsal for new rules,
scheduled to take effect in January, that will require Americans to show a
passport or other proof of citizenship to enter the United States. The
requirements were approved by Congress as part of antiterrorism legislation
in 2004.

Border officials said agents along the southern border were asking more
returning United States citizens to show a photo identity document. At the
same time, agents are increasing the frequency of what they call queries,
where they check a traveler’s information against law enforcement,
immigration and antiterror databases.

The new policy is a big shift after decades when Americans arrived at land
border crossings, declared they were citizens and were waved on through.
Since the authorities began ramping up enforcement in August, wait times at
border stations in Texas have often stretched to two hours or more,
discouraging visitors and shoppers and upsetting local business.

The delays could remain a fact of life across the southern border for the
next few years, border officials said, at least until new security
technology and expanded entry stations are installed and until Americans get
used to being checked and questioned like foreigners. Last year 234 million
travelers entered the United States through land border crossings from
Mexico.

W. Ralph Basham, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, the
agency that manages the borders, said longer waits had resulted from added
security measures at border stations that in many cases were aging, outmoded
and facing surging traffic. Saying the new document checks were a “security
imperative,” Mr. Basham called on border cities, which own many of the
crossing bridges, to invest in expanding the entry points.

In the meantime, Mr. Basham said, “A safer border is well worth the wait.”

BINGO! -- DSH

Wait times of up to three hours have also been reported over the past few
months at crossings from eastern Canada. Senator Bernard Sanders,
independent of Vermont, who held a series of town meetings with border
officials about the lines, said low staffing at border stations was the
primary cause there.

The longer lines along the Mexico border have been especially unsettling
here in El Paso, a humming border city long comfortable in its marriage to
Ciudad Juárez, the bigger and rowdier Mexican metropolis on the other bank
of the Rio Grande. Lines of cars and pedestrians at sunrise on the four
border bridges here are a routine for tens of thousands of people, including
many United States citizens, coming from Mexico on their way to school, work
and shopping.

“International bridge wait times continue to escalate, causing frustration
and concern in my district and across the nation,” wrote El Paso’s
congressman, Representative Silvestre Reyes, a Democrat, in a letter this
month to the House Committee on Homeland Security in which he called for a
hearing on the matter.

One crosser who said she had struggled with the lines was Wilda Laboy, a
37-year-old American citizen who works in Juárez but is studying for her
high school equivalency in El Paso.

“I arrive late, and they don’t let me in,” said Ms. Laboy as she waited to
be checked through the Paso del Norte bridge crossing here. “I miss
classes.”

Many families that straddle the border are feeling the strain. Border trade
groups say the long lines caught them by surprise and are disrupting
economic ties vital to both sides of the border.

“We are Americans who live at the border, with our economy and livelihood
that depend on moving efficiently back and forth,” said Maria Luisa O’Connell,
president of the Border Trade Alliance, which represents businesses all
along the border with Mexico. “Now suddenly we have measures that make it
less efficient but don’t make us any safer.”

Richard Cortez, the mayor of McAllen, another Texas border town that saw
long lines this summer, said the waits had slowed some of the 45,000 trailer
trucks that passed the border there each month.

“There’s a misconception that border communities care only about ourselves
and our own local businesses,” Mr. Cortez said by telephone. “Our border
crossings affect trade across the United States.”

Of $332 billion in trade last year between the United States and Mexico,
this country’s third-largest trading partner, more than 80 percent of it
moved across the border by truck.

Starting Jan. 31, American citizens returning home by land will have to
present either a passport, or a citizenship document like a birth
certificate together with a government-issued identity card with a
photograph. The requirement is the next phase of the Western Hemisphere
Travel Initiative, which Congress adopted in a 2004 bill that enacted
recommendations of the commission that examined the Sept. 11 attacks. It is
intended to improve antiterror intelligence by gathering a record of
everyone entering the United States.

So far the new inspections are not systematic enough to yield measurable
results.

The passport requirement has been in effect since January for most citizens
returning to the United States by air, and it had a rocky debut because many
Americans without passports rushed to apply for one. Passport processing
backlogs overwhelmed the State Department, which was forced to relax the
requirement during the months of June, July, August and September. That
experience has created anxiety among many people who cross at land stations
as they anticipate the next phase.

Also in August, border officials said, the Department of Homeland Security
issued a directive designed to unify inspection procedures for all the
border agencies under its umbrella. It set an eventual goal, with no fixed
deadline, for agents to conduct a database query for every person crossing
the border.

As a result, queries by agents of both American and foreign border crossers
increased. At many older border stations, including El Paso, agents have to
enter some queries manually, taking minutes that quickly mount up to hours
when thousands of cars and people are waiting in line.

Luis Garcia, the El Paso field director for Customs and Border Protection,
said the new policy demanded a change of culture.

“These two communities are very interlinked, not only by trade and commerce,
but by family, religion, education,” Mr. Garcia said, standing at the base
of the Paso del Norte border bridge as pedestrians streamed by, heading for
downtown El Paso. “When a person leaves El Paso to go to Juárez, it’s like
going across the street. They don’t consider it leaving the country,” he
said.

On an average day, some 21,000 pedestrians cross from Juárez on the Paso del
Norte bridge, one of El Paso’s four entryways. Mr. Garcia installed a canopy
over the walkway, and water fountains and overhead mist-makers at the
checkpoint to cool weary walkers on sweltering days.

As the lines into El Paso swelled in mid-August, Mr. Garcia said, he issued
a memorandum directing his agents to gauge vehicle lines in deciding how
many travelers to query. If lines were over an hour, agents should run a
query only for the driver, unless something about the vehicle aroused their
suspicions.

But Mr. Garcia said he did not have great flexibility to speed the lines.
“One thing I can tell you up front, as director in El Paso, I will not
compromise security for facilitation,” he said.

Border groups say they support tougher security measures but want the border
authorities to back them up with increased staff levels and technology to
avoid slowing commerce.

Funds for the Border Patrol, which scouts the border between entry points
for illegal immigrants, increased by 70 percent since 2005 to $3 billion. By
contrast, financing for border station agents, who processed nearly 300
million travelers entering the country legally by land last year, rose by 30
percent since 2005, to $2.1 billion.

For the past few years, I have found the US border guards

I saw a re-run of the Robocop II movie
recently, which was about the decline of
Detroit (and the USA generally) and how the
whole of the USA was going &quot;private&quot; to save
it from Junkies, Muzzies, Crims, wetbacks,
the Euro, blacks - and Democrats.

This marvellous little must-see movie
proposed a solution in the form of a *super
robot*, the Robocop II of the title who was
to replace Robocop I - an outdated model
which had been imbued with outdated conceps
of justice, fair-play, the &quot;American Way&quot;,
and with just one six-shooter.

The new model possesed a neck-snapping set of
pincers on one arm and a high-speed gatling
gun on the other, together with a
rocket-propelled grade launcher on its right
shoulder; and it could leap tall buildings
with &quot;just one bound!&quot;

Appropriately it had been programmed with
ethno-recognition software, and  the brain of
a junkie-psychopath thereby eliminating any
caution or introspection.

It's *just* the thing for all the muzzies
trying to get into America to invade it -
like they did to Europe recently.

Yes - I can't deny that's true. Since the US dollar went down the toilet I
notice that the Euros have been buying up Florida and the West Coast
wholesale. That's not really 'tourism' though - more carpet-bagging really.
I can only go by the experience of many people I know who now choose to fly
to London via KL or Hong Kong in order to avoid like the plague the trained
gorillas and interminable queues at 'security' in LA.
It wouldn't be so bad if it was in any way effective or achieved anything,
but from the accounts I've heard the whole 'system' seems to be designed
merely to piss people off and to look as if they are doing 'something'
rather than actually catch any would-be plane hijackers.

Nonsense!

Such security measures are obviously quite necessary around harbors and
harbours.

We are AT WAR.

Global Islamofascist Jihadist Terrorists want to kill us -- they have cells
in North America, composed of native-born citizens who speak Good English
and who don't look like terrorists.

Further, an artificial leg could be one of the easiest ways of getting
explosives and/or weapons onto an aircraft.

Not in the slightest. As the trained gorilla explained; &quot;We are not allowed
to use judgment&quot;.
It's all so ridiculous whichever way you look at it.
If it's just to keep Cheney's &quot;climate of fear&quot; going to justify further
attacks on oil-rich countries and remove hard won freedoms it's disgusting,
and if there really *is* a 'worldwide terrorist threat' then the terrorists
are winning easily thanks to our own government's stupidity.
Bin Laden and Co must be laughing their ***** off at the years of
self-induced mayhem and shows of cowardice they sparked with so little
effort.

Blitz. Our parents would be ashamed of us.

This decline of the dollar as compared to the Euro has other salient
benefits.

It brings more European tourists to the United States so they can see
America The Beautiful and learn better how to respect and love us.

_Au contraire_, it keeps many Americans at HOME, seeing America The
Beautiful, learning to respect and love their own Nation and its citizens --
rather than hanging out abroad with Johnny Foreigners ---- AND spending
their hard-earned dollars at HOME, to the benefit of the American Economy.

Further, the decline of the dollar makes our exports cheaper to Johnny
Foreigners -- thereby helping to improve our Balance of Trade and forcing us
to be more self-sufficient with Good Old Yankee Ingenuity.

AND it tends to make Americans more NATIONALISTIC -- always useful in a
Wartime Environment.

Good Show All 'Round.

Dick Cheney, Yale '63, probably planned it this way and pulled all the
strings to make it happen.

The problem is that George's speech impediment makes it impossible to
tell wether he is talking about &quot;Terrorists&quot; or &quot;Tourists&quot;

The lyrics of an anti-apartheid song from 1987:

WEEPING
by Bright Blue

I knew a man who lived in fear
it was huge it was angry
it was drawing near
Behind his house a secret place
was the shadow of the demon
he could never face.

He built a wall of steel and flame
and men with guns to keep it tame
Then standing back he made it plain
that the nightmare would never ever rise again
But the fear and the fire and the guns remain.

It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow
He tells the world that it's sleeping
But as the night came round I heard
it slowly sound
it wasn't roaring it was weeping
it wasn't roaring it was weeping.

And then one day the neighbours came
they were curious to know about the smoke and flame
They stood around outside the wall
but of course there was nothing to be heard at all
&quot;My friends&quot;, he said, &quot;we've reached our goal
the threat is under firm control
As long as peace and order reign
I'll be damned if I can see a reason to explain
Why the fear and the fire and the guns remain&quot;.

It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow
He tells the world that it's sleeping
But as the night came round I heard
it slowly sound
it wasn't roaring it was weeping
it wasn't roaring it was weeping.

It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow
He tells the world that it's sleeping
But as the night came round I heard
it slowly sound
it wasn't roaring it was weeping
it wasn't roaring it was weeping.

Composed by: Heymann/ Fox/ Cohen/ Cohen

Recorded and released by Bright Blue in 1987. One of South Africa's
greatest songs... includes instrumental references to 'Nkosi Sikelel'
iAfrica'.

FBI Warns Again Of Shoe Bomb Danger

Scanners Paying Even More Attention To Routine Objects

NEW YORK (CBS News) -- The joint FBI-Homeland Security bulletin,
obtained by CBS News today, bluntly warns that terrorists are still
working to use &quot;modified footwear as a concealment method for
explosive devices,&quot; CBS News correspondent Bob Orr reports.

The alert follows the discovery of bomb detonators - expertly hidden
in the hollowed-out soles of this pair of shoes - found aboard a
European bus last month.

Intelligence officials say the shoes were not being worn at the time,
but instead were being used, as the document says, &quot;to smuggle
electric blasting caps across international borders for use in a
terrorist attack.&quot;

&quot;The terrorists have an interest in explosive devices. They are trying
to figure out the best way to push them, to move them through the
system,&quot; said CBS News counterterrorism analyst Paul Kurtz.

Shoes have been used by terrorists before.

Three months after 9/11, al Qaeda operative Richard Reid tried to blow
up an American Airlines jet with a shoe bomb similar to the one shown
in this test.

Now at U.S. airports, scanners X-ray all passengers' shoes and carry
on bags, searching for explosives.

Still, experts worry that a team of terrorists could beat security by
carrying unassembled parts of a bomb past a checkpoint.

&quot;Where one person will carry component A, the next person will carry
component B, and they will meet together past the safety point, past
the checkpoint and reassemble,&quot; explained Mike White, the director of
training for Michael Stapleton Associates and a former head of the
NYPD bomb squad.

Officials say there is no specific intelligence that terrorists are
preparing new attacks against America.

But, the threat remains high - and the bulletin warns law enforcement
officials not to assume that routine objects, like shoes, are always
what they appear to be.

I wasn't travelling to or from the USA.

I see that tourists to the USA now need an address where they'll spend the

I wonder if they could have the shitheads swallow condoms with explosive in

&gt; FBI Warns Again Of Shoe Bomb Danger

&gt; Scanners Paying Even More Attention To Routine Objects

&gt; NEW YORK (CBS News) -- The joint FBI-Homeland Security bulletin,
&gt; obtained by CBS News today, bluntly warns that terrorists are still
&gt; working to use &quot;modified footwear as a concealment method for
&gt; explosive devices,&quot; CBS News correspondent Bob Orr reports.

&gt; The alert follows the discovery of bomb detonators - expertly hidden
&gt; in the hollowed-out soles of this pair of shoes - found aboard a
&gt; European bus last month.

&gt; Intelligence officials say the shoes were not being worn at the time,
&gt; but instead were being used, as the document says, &quot;to smuggle
&gt; electric blasting caps across international borders for use in a
&gt; terrorist attack.&quot;

&gt; &quot;The terrorists have an interest in explosive devices. They are trying
&gt; to figure out the best way to push them, to move them through the
&gt; system,&quot; said CBS News counterterrorism analyst Paul Kurtz.

&gt; Shoes have been used by terrorists before.

&gt; Three months after 9/11, al Qaeda operative Richard Reid tried to blow
&gt; up an American Airlines jet with a shoe bomb similar to the one shown
&gt; in this test.

&gt; Now at U.S. airports, scanners X-ray all passengers' shoes and carry
&gt; on bags, searching for explosives.

&gt; Still, experts worry that a team of terrorists could beat security by
&gt; carrying unassembled parts of a bomb past a checkpoint.

&gt; &quot;Where one person will carry component A, the next person will carry
&gt; component B, and they will meet together past the safety point, past
&gt; the checkpoint and reassemble,&quot; explained Mike White, the director of
&gt; training for Michael Stapleton Associates and a former head of the
&gt; NYPD bomb squad.

&gt; Officials say there is no specific intelligence that terrorists are
&gt; preparing new attacks against America.

&gt; But, the threat remains high - and the bulletin warns law enforcement
&gt; officials not to assume that routine objects, like shoes, are always
&gt; what they appear to be.

We have sense and can certainly figure out a few more.

He should never be allowed to carry matches onboard a commercial airline
flight and all his pens should be thoroughly vetted for incendiary devices

I've sent off a cable to Homeland Security recommending they do a complete

Yes, Victoria, there ARE secrets, technologies and techniques we know about

NOT going to broadcast them.

We're NOT going to TELL you and we're NOT going to SHOOT you -- so Pogue
Black's wheedling and goading is not going to elicit any of that classified

And, yes, Victoria, having people take off their shoes at airports is a very

for reasons that Pogue Gans, Pogue Black and other little pogues and

Pogue Gans is displaying his congenital academic naïveté yet again.

There were very good reasons, political, diplomatic and military for not
broadcasting the fact we were bombing bad guys in Cambodia, bad guys who
were killing our troops and transporting weapons to them.

The Israelis have not broadcasted the details of their airstrike into Syria
in early September either -- and they also have very good political,
diplomatic and military reasons for doing so.

These reasons have NOTHING to do with an allegedly EVIL GOVERNMENT, AFRAID
OF ITS OWN PEOPLE -- as Pogue Gans would have it.

Pogue Gans is a typical brain-washed product of the &quot;Liberal&quot; eyewash and
insipid, naïve, simplistic &quot;Liberal&quot; Worldview of the 1960's who is confused
by matters far beyond his ken -- but just can't resist prattling, babbling
and burbling about them.

He's a Hysterical CHEMIST -- not a Grand Strategist.

It IS, however, a Gross Embarrassment and a Great Inconvenience to Gans.

Why?...

Because he is large and fat, not particularly well-coordinated and he finds
it very awkward to take off his shoes, put them in the basket, retrieve them
on the conveyor belt and then put his shoes back on while standing up and
hanging onto his carry-on baggage.

THAT'S why he's objecting and saying the Government Is Evil and cannot be

criteria attached to it, there will never, ever be a time when we're not
at 'war'.
Please learn to use the term as per its original application.
