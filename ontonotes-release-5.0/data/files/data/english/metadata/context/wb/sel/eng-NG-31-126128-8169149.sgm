tape bob dylan (everybody else just either one or a couple, maybe a
few more, that's it) (but i ripped up like tons of my tapes in the
hospital, i told you about that, but i had already bought the CDs, so
i think i sorta knew that in the back of my mind, i was mad at bob
dylan for making me come out there, and thinking that he wanted to
stop smoking, and mad at myself for thinking that he was going to come
and get me, the great bob dylan, so i ripped up my tapes and threw
them away) (oops)

&gt; Phew. I don't think I understand *your* question.

&gt; Jeez, it seems pretty simple...you own some number of (non-bootleg)
&gt; albums by a given artist. [X] of them are CDs, [Y] of them are LPs
&gt; and [Z] of them are cassettes. Maybe you even have some other freaky
&gt; formats, like reel-to-reel, eight-track, whatever.

&gt; For which artists does X = 0? And of those artists, which handful of
&gt; them account for the most albums in your collection?

&gt; (Sigh. This thread is not going very well, is it?)

&gt; Going back to my original list for illustration (?!?)...

&gt; The Moody Blues: seven LPs
&gt; Jandek: six LPs
&gt; Jean-Michel Jarre: four LPs, two cassettes
&gt; Eugene Chadbourne: three LPs, three cassettes
&gt; Phil Manzanera, Richard Harris: five LPs
&gt; Joni Mitchell, Devo, Herb Alpert, Cat Stevens, Magazine, the Roches,
&gt; Todd Rundgren, Wild Man Fischer: four LPs
&gt; Richard &amp; Linda Thompson: three LPs, one cassette
&gt; Alice Cooper: two LPs, two cassettes

&gt; And if I happen to buy a CD by any of these artists someday, they
&gt; would drop off the list (for instance, Stevie Wonder, T. Rex and Tom
&gt; Verlaine formerly would have been prominent on this list, but I
&gt; finally bought one of their CDs in recent times).

I take it all back. I just read Poisoned Rose's explanation of the
original question, and I see I misinterpretted it. There are very few
artists in my vinyl collection who aren't also represented in my CD
collection. I have CDs of all the above except for Randy Newman and
Richard Harris. Others for whom I have no CDs are Charles Aznavour,
The Big Bopper and Herman's Hermits. Randy Newman is the only artist I
have more than one vinyl of from the group of artists  not represented
in my CD collection. Now that's just sad. :-(

If I understand your question - that it's LPs that you don't have CDs
of (regardless of whether or not CDs of those albums exist) - mine is
(I think)

22 LPs : Dylan
10 LPs : Gene Clark
7 LPs : Tom Petty
6 LPs : Beck
6 LPs : Beach Boys
5 LPs : Johnny Cash

If you mean artists on LP that I have no CDs of at all it's

5 LPs : Meat Puppets
5 LPs : Gene Vincent
5 Lps : White Stripes

This is a really interesting question.  Let's start another thread -
how many LPs by artists who only release CDs but not before the
decline in sales of cassettes before or ending in the year 2008
(except those on mini disc or reel to reel), discluding anything in
itunes but including everything you bought that came in a brown paper
bag, have between 6 and 12 letters in their name or are over 6ft
without heels?

Impossible for me to answer.
When I love an artist, I get it on CD as well.
(and on mp3 too, these days....I'm rearraging most of my discotheque in mp3)
So I've got only a few artists with Lps *only* and mainly it's juts one LP
...if it's two, I must get them on binary code!
If you mean the artist I've got more LPs of, it's surely Dylan.
Apart form Dylan, it's the Beatles and its branches.
(I had them ALL in LPs before the advent of CDs)

Sounds like you're asking about both vestigial LPs (artists we
followed until CDs came along and didn't bother to upgrade the format)
or LPs of artists that we like but that have never been reissued on
CD.

OK, so without respect to all the relic vinyl (Dylan, etc.) that I
have since replaced with CDs, here's a short list (minimum 2 units) of
platters and tapes I've still kept for some reason:

Von Karajan's Beethoven Cycle (9 LPs)
Glenn Gould (2 LPs)
Walter Klien (1 LP, 1 cassette)
Murray Perahia (2 LPs)
Johnny Horton (2 LPs)
Ink Spots (2 LPs)
Lord Buckley (1 LP, 1 cassette)
Elephants Memory (2 LPs, 1 cassette)
Peoples' Victory Music and Orchestra (2 LPs)
The Fugs (2 LPS)
Matching Moles (1 LP, 1 casette)
The Nice (2 cassettes)
Alice Cooper (2 cassettes)
Harvey Mandel (2 LPS)
The Police (2 cassettes)
ELO (1 LP, 1 cassette)
Robert Plant (2 cassettes)
Loose Caboose (2 cassettes)
Firesign Theater (3 LPs, 2 cassettes)
National Lampoon (2 LPs)
J. Douglas Edwards (3 LPs)
Westminster Classics (3 LPs)

Fortunately, I have been able to upgrade my vintage blues and folk LPs
to CD over the past year, taking a huge chuck out of this list.

less each year that I haven't had a turntable.

Let's see: I did get two early Larry Wild Man Fischer albums, a Stan
Musial Baseball Song LP, a signed copy of Bernstein conducting Ludwig
van's 7th and the two aforementioned Firesign Theater LPs. Not so much
since.

But, to this day, if I came across a good listenable vinyl copy of Red
Detachment of Women LP on Everest Records (as performed for Pres.
Richard Nixon on his visit to China), I'd grab it, same as I would the
classic 45, Gilligans/ Stairway by Little Roger and the Goosebumps on
Splash records. Both have been banned in their respective countries.
Lost my copies along the way...

Why not ask your question this way?

Out of the artists you have on vinyl but not on cds,
who do you have the most of?

&gt; I've asked this in another forum or two...it's especially
&gt; interesting to ask on Usenet, where the population is much older
&gt; than the norm and full of pre-CD-age collectors.

&gt; The question is: Which artists do you own the most albums by, where
&gt; *none of them are on CD*? Oh, and mp3s don't count. ;)
">

Got tons of vinyl... thousands and thousands in the family...  All
genres...  Got entire discographies of people I don't even like that
much, just as a matter of course!...  It is a blessing (valuable
content-enjoyment-wise and monetarily, a lot of it, if it's rare and
in near-mint condition) and a curse (unwieldy, needs storage space,
can only listen to one record at a time (as suggested), can't fit
inside an ipod-)...  In the age of $1 albums at thriftstores, it's now
more easy than ever to assemble  a massive collection for little
cost... (kinda like the mp3-age has made it possible for people to
amass whole discographies with no legwork or scouring record
stores)...

Beatles, Dylan, Stones, Miles Davis, Coltrane - more than 20 albums
each, easily... bootlegs or not...

10 albums or more:  Zep, U2, Sioux, Pistols, Floyd, Cure, Who,
Velvets, Kinks, Iggy, Bowie... etc., etc.

Too many to mention or listen to...

CD's aren't bad, but I have less overall sentimental attachement to a
CD release than an LP, probably cause the CD content and artwork are
easily reproducable/copied if parted with...

MP3's are the tits for easy access, ain't they?...  Rapidshare, any
one?...  But as far as still collecting stuff, it mostly just the $1
Lps and the freeish Mp3s for me these days...  For bootlegs and out of
prints, it's mostly flac via dime...  Hey, I'm in my thirties... gotta
save up this info for retirement!...

Beatles - only have two CDs by them... the rest are bootlegs...
Probably 30 or more Beatles boots...  Stones, don't have any official
CDs... but over 40 bootlegs...  Dylan, over 60 CDs boots, approx...
Over 30 boots each for Miles and Coltrane and about 20 or more boots
CD each for the rest of the above... and lots of other artists...  But
some of it, the boots, is like someone's digital photo archive; just
cause you have it on a hard-drive, in flac or some compressed file,
doesn't mean it'll be burned to CD and listening to...  In that regard
it's easier to directly download something, even a bootleg, in mp3
form listen to it on iTunes, y'know?...

I don't really visit CD stores anymore, and if I was going to buy a CD
it would be on Ebay or off Amazon or an Amazon affiliated store...  (I
know really real is a big supporter of local indie music shops, but
the CDs I buy are used)...

I tend not to buy CDs of things I already have on vinyl... so therein
lies the reason why I have no official Dylan CDs...  That's not true:
I have the RAH Bootleg Series thing on CD and vinyl...

I got TOOM and L&amp;T on vinyl as well...  I did have the Bootleg Series
I and then the NDHome thing on CD, but I sold them...  Right now the
most official CDs I seem to have are by the Yardbirds, but that's
cause their LPs were out of print during the 80s, at least in the
US...

Of course, that doesn't mean I actually listen to all of the above
with any regularity, I'm just planning on living a long time,
really...  It's like money in the bank; it's just nice to have for
that rainy day...

I think that's why at a certain point, people of a certain generation
just declare that 'New' contemporary music is no longer worthy of
pursuing or listening to, because keeping up with the ongoing history
of recorded sound (while trying to discover all the unheard music of
hte past) is a hopelessly joyous pursuit... but hopeless
nonetheless...

That is surely in line with PR's interest in unique indicators, by all
indications...  So to answer the specific question non-specifically:
there are at least 20 artists that I've got more than 10 albums of but
do not have CDs of (if you don't count bootlegs)...  As to who those
artists are in relation to the importance of who they might be, I can
remember only that the Ventures are one of them...

I think there needs to be, also, a distinction (in PR's line of query)
between something that one bought, and something that was given; ie.,
the 2 Beatles CDs I have, someone else bought those and didn't want
them... they just ended up in my collection...  They're not really
mine...  So I'd have the Beatles be in the all LP/no CD ledger column,
all things being what they are...  And I don't think I've ever even
seen an official store-bought Stones CD... but I hear they exist...

This has got to be the best answer to Poisoned Rose's question. I
suggest that he reward you with the 17th album (in vinyl) beginnning
with the letter C (for crazytimes) that he purchased on an overcast
day -- whether or not he has this same album on compact disc and/or
cassette.

Well you didn't give them away.  Alice Cooper is a vinyl relic.  Who
bothered to duplicate their old Alice albums on CD?  Yet millions have done
that with the Beatles, Stones, Dylan, Hendrix and Clapton.

The question is interesting but perhaps out of date, as mp3s have taken over
much of the CD market.
