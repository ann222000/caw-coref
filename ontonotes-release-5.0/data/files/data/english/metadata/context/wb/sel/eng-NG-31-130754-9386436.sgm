*********************** ARTICLE START ***********************
Most people miss the point when they discover routines, thinking they are merely pickup lines in order to get a woman into the bedroom. This could not be further from the truth.

In case you do not know what a routine is, it can be anything from a conversation starter with a women, to fun games to play, or stories to tell to get a girl laughing, having fun and getting you both having a good time. They are generally small canned pieces of text that you say when talking and often make up the bulk of the initial conversation, they can then be discarded once your talking and having a fun time together.

Most guys hear about them and immediately think they are designed to seduce the girl, to get her horny and wanting to be dragged back to your man cave... If they were made to do this then the best guys with women in the world would constantly be using them, but they don't. Routines serve 2 purposes, very different purposes to be being used as seduction tools.

The first purpose they address is that of helping beginners who don't know a thing about talking to women, actually drum up a conversation and get some experience with girls. They allow a guy who comes from a background of being a geek/engineer/business guy/whatever who has little to no women at his college/workplace to talk to random girls and not immediately be thought of as a loser. They work great in this instance because he can finally improve on his social skills without immediately being blown out or wasting lots of money buying drinks for girls so he can talk to them (not that you'd ever buy a drink for a female stranger anyway). The only real problem here is he has to realize that these routines are a crutch and not him, they allow him to walk but once he has begun walking he must practice without them or he will never learn proper social confidence, instead retreating to lines he is familiar with to mask his social inadequacies. Once someone is good talking to people using routine (and that person doesn't even need to be really good, just comfortable talking), they should slowly use less and less routines until they don't use any at all and their inner self and personality can just shine through.

The second purpose of routines is slightly related to the first. It is simply a way of getting past that awkward first 10 minutes of conversation with a stranger that could potentially be your soul mate, or be nothing like you at all. Even if that person is your soul mate and you have thousands of things in common, those initial 10 minutes of conversation are still often going to be dreaded by both parties and full of awkward silences if you are not a very naturally social person and/or don't have all that much to say. I've heard this time and time again from girls I've just met to some of my best friends who aren't very social, when I ask them why they are so shy around new people they say something like &quot;I'm great and talkative around friends, its just hard to talk to new people and stir up a conversation&quot;. This is a problem that nearly everyone has and is 90% of the time due to you not knowing what to say because you know nothing about the other person. These routines are designed to get both parties to open up to a conversation and get to know each other and are so neutral that it doesn't matter what you are into, you can probably relate to whats being said. From there you can talk about similar things, events and so on and keep going, going into detail about each others lives.

Finally the best thing about routines is this: Generally after using a routing 10-15 times it becomes ingrained in yourself and you no longer need to remember it word for word, it sort of just spews out of your mouth at the girl. This is a great stage to be at when using routines because once you have made it to this level (which honestly isn't hard, just do 10-15 sets with your set of routines and you'll pretty much know them all perfectly) you can begin to use your subconscious mind to spit out the routine, and with your conscious mind you can focus on things such as your body language, your tonality, where your hand are moving, kino etc. This allows you to focus on other parts of your approach instead of having to constantly think about what your going to say next. This puts yourself in the league far ahead of the normal guys as while they are constantly struggling to think of what to say next their body language, tonality and so on is giving off the wrong vibe completely. Over the next 20-30 sets you can then adjust yourself to give off better hand gestures with your routines, have better eye contact and be more alpha in your body language and you'll see quite clearly the girls responding far more positively to you than when you first started out in the field. Then all these body language aspects of your game will also become unconscious along with your routines and when this happens (which does happen very quickly if you focus on it and keep on going) you'll see enormous changes in your game and without even consciously being aware of what you're doing girls will start to like you and enjoy being around you more.

So use routines and have fun with them, they are there to help you out, not to be used as evidence that men are dirty scoundrels attempting to get women into bed as quickly as possible. If you really want to be a better man, use them and improve yourself until your at a level where you can just talk and have fun with women immediately and your game will multiply exponentially, putting yourself above 90% of men within a very short timeframe.
