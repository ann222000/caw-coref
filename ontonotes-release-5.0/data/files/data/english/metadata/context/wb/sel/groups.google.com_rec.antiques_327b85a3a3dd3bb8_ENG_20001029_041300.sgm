For those of us who were never quite sure what benefit the buyer's premium
bestowed upon us, here's eB*y's helpful information (given to justify
adding 10% to their &quot;Great Collections&quot; auctions):

&quot;Most traditional auction houses charge a buyerâ€™s premium of 10 to
20 percent of the sales price to cover their costs for services that are
essential for successful auctioning of high-end fine art, antiques, and
other unique collectibles. More specifically, auctioneers collect a premium
to pay for value-added services such as authenticity guarantee, provenance
research, sales previews, and property storage.&quot; (end quote)

At one time it was thought that these were just normal costs of running an
auction business, until Christie's and Sotheby's collaborated in
introducing the buyer's premium a few years ago.

Reminds me of the scam perpetrated by new-car dealers in the US. You'll
often see a line on the window sticker of popular models (along with all
the usual add-ons like air conditioning, roof racks, etc.):
ADM - $500.00 or
ADP - $600.00
The unwary car buyer doesn't find out until it's too late that these
cryptic acronynms stand for Added Dealer Margin and Added Dealer Profit.

"/> A few years ago Bill?? ... perhaps in the US or maybe for you time has
flown pass rather fast and unnoticed. However, I've been paying 'buyer's
premium' for at least the last 15-20 years on items bought at Christie's
and Sotheby's in the UK. I think the last **major** auction house in the
UK not to charge a buyer's premium was &quot;Lots Road&quot; before they were
bought over by Bonhams around about the mid 1980s.

I also think it's incorrect of you to state that ... &quot;Christie's and
Sotheby's collaborated in introducing the buyer's premium a few years
ago.&quot; In the UK **all** the major auction houses charge more or less the
same rate on the buyer's premium, and this has been the case for many
years.

For the dealer there shouldn't really be any big deal with a buyer's
premium, for after all, it's a business expense just like any other
business expense .... hammer price plus auctioneer's fee.

And let's not forget the buyer's premium just like the 'seller's
premium' can be flexible, negotiable, just depends on who you are, how
much business you conduct and the type of goods put up for sale.

"/> Ronnie: I fear you're correct - and the older I get, the faster it flies!
I checked some of my back catalogs, and Sotheby's in London were charging
10% at least as far back as the early 80s.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Sotheby's collaborated in introducing the buyer's premium a few years

"/> Looking at my Sotheby's NY catalogs, there was no premium in the late 70s,
but they were certainly charging 10% by the mid 80s. However, before S &amp; C
introduced it (I believe simultaneously) at their New York salesrooms, the
buyer's premium was unknown in the USA. It took a while to filter down to
the next level, and percentages vary from the 15% charged by the larger
houses, down to 10% and 12% charged even by the country auctions in many
areas. There are still a few holdouts on the East coast who don't charge a
premium; I don't know the situation at the smaller houses in other areas.

As you say, it's just another condition of business for the buyer; for the
seller (in theory at least) it should result in a reduced commission being
charged on goods sold, since the buyer makes up the difference. In
practise, I think a lot of auction houses are taking the full commission on
both ends.

"/> Actually, Great Collections is not adding a buyer's premium, at least not in
the conventional sense. The amount entered as a bid will include the
permium, as will the high bid amount displayed. IOW, if I enter $1100 as my
bid amount, and win at that amount, I'll be paying $1000 for the item and
$100 buyer's premium. If I bid $1100 at an auction with a conventional 10%
buyer's premium, I'll end up writing a check for $1210.

Here's the language from the announcement: &quot;To keep the buying process on
the eB*y Great Collections site straightforward, we will do all the
calculations on your behalf. The price that you will see and bid on our site
after the introduction of Buyer's Premium will always be the Total Price --
that is, the bid price PLUS the buyer's premium. In other words, it will
always be the final price that you will actually pay if you win the
auction.&quot;

It took me a while to figure out why yaBe is doing this.
Since the numbers
bidders are seeing and entering all include the buyer's premium, rather than
yaBe tacking it on at the end, there's no psychological inducement for
buyers to bid higher than they would in a non-premium auction.

Then the light bulb clicked on.

The buyer's premium has has *nothing* to do with increasing selling prices,
or boosting yaBe's income per transaction (except for its Butterfields
subsidiary, as I'll explain in a moment).

It has everything to do with helping the GC sellers who sell on consignment
scam their consignors.

Old system:

GC Seller accepts item on consignment for 25% commission. Item sells for
$1100. Consignor gets $825.00

New system:

GC Seller accepts item on consignment for 25% commission. Item sells for
$1000 plus $100 buyer's premium, total $1100. GC Seller reports the selling
price to consignor as $1000; consignor gets $750.00

Now, I don't have a great problem with a buyer's premium at a decent RL
auction house. They have real bricks-and-mortar expenses to cover. OTOH,
the costs involved in taking a few pics and writing up a listing are
miniscule in comparison to the costs of running a RL auction. IMO, there's
no way an auction company should be able to justify this scam to its
consignors.

But it is the consignors, not the buyers, who are getting screwed by the GC
buyer's premium. AFAICT, it's not going to affect the bidding process one
iota. (Except for the obligatory two weeks of nonfunctional functionalities
while it is implemented.)

The good news is, since only a few sellers on generic yaBe sell on
consignment, I don't think we'll see a buyer's premium outside of GC.
There's no point to it there.

Ronnie,

Auctionhouses here in the US all charge a buyers premium. And if they don't,
its because there is such an enormous % taken from the consignor.

In the US it is usually 15-20% - if you see 10% you breathe a sigh of relief.

People complaining about buyers premiums crack me up. I'd love to see them run
an auctionhouse without it. Where do they think these guys get their money
from?

Its the same for people who get annoyed at dealers for marking up their
merchandise. Oh, I forget, we should all sell things for what we paid for them
- and or sometimes less.

Unreal.

"/> Exactly Reyne, and this was going to be my follow-up point to, Bill. I
think these same people fail to realize that the auctioneer is acting as
an agent. Even with 15% taken both ways, less the auctioneer's
overheads, less the cost of the auction hosting and less the cost of the
rest, that is still much less than most dealer's profit margins.

So what do these folk want? - 0% buyer's premium and 30%-40% seller's
premium. At that rate of going the friggin' auction houses wouldn't get
any consignments to sell in the first place, the main houses would be
devoid of any goods. The auctioneer is a go-between and as such both
parties, seller and buyer, should foot the auction's fees.

I think folk need to get real, the days of 0% buyer's premium is over,
long gone. Plain as the nose on ones face, IMO, any auction house not
charging buyer's premium are probably punting their own stuff, and
probably punting crap at that.

Ronnie,

Absolutely. They would have to be selling their own merchandise.

What consignor do you know would pay 30%?

There is one auctionhouse I know that deals with nothing but estate attorneys.
They charge the estate 30% and no buyers premium. The estate attorneys could
care less. They are just getting the stuff out of the house so they can wrap up
the estate. Otherwise, yes - no one in their right mind would pay 30%.

Yea, we should all work for free.

different rules.
I just don't get it.
BTW, I normally pay 10-15 percent buyer's premium. I factor it in (what a
math wizz) every time I hold up that bidding number. As you say, *someone*
has to pay the fees for the service...why should the heirs of the estate be the

"/> Yea, at the weekly and local auction rooms in my neck of the woods the
buyer's premium varies between 10%-15% (seller's rate the same) and of course
with the **fess** attracting a furter 17.5% VAT. The main city houses all
charge the SAME rate 12 1/2% buyer's premium and the same for the seller.

MY GOD!!! collusion or wot!! QUICK!!!! call in the Sweeney Todd.

Although, having said that, if the seller is trade, then the (seller) fees
will be negotiable, even Christie's and Sotheby's, most times, depending on
the sale type, give a special &quot;trade seller's fee&quot; for bona fide trade and to
their regular consignors.

When I **sell** at the local auctions (in my area) I'm usually charged
between 8%-10% and at one auction house in particular they charge me 6% with
their normal Joe Public fees being 10% both ways. IMO, the fee is a business
EXPENSE just like another service fee, so it's no big deal.

At one local sale room I pay a reduced buyer's premium, because I have a
special working relationship with that auction house. This is normal in my
area and quite a number of dealers would pay and be charged special rates and
fees. After all, it's a trade oriented business, with Joe Public merely being
the end user.

I am sure that the likes of Paul Getta doesn't pay Christie's and Sotheby's
(or any of the other international players) the full publicized premiums, but
has a special deal with special rates.

As to my &quot;seller's fee&quot; usually charged by Christie's, (don't often use
Sotheby's) that's my business :) but it's lower than their normal quoted and
publicized rates, depending on the sale type. I would be surprised that the
same arrangements between trade and Christie's (and other **professional**
auction houses) didn't already exist in the USA.

They do. Up until recently I only paid Christies 6% and Phillips 5% but that
had to do with the total $ a year I gave them. Anyone could have the same nego
power. However, a few months ago they changed things to 6% to everyone. I
guess that happened with the impending investigation.

Their buyers premium however went from 15% to 18%

I disagree with the whole buyers premium thing, however I believe the
true reason behind the buyer's premium is to spread the profit for the
auction house to include both the buyer and the seller. IE the seller
is going to get more money and thus (one would assume) more sellers
are willing to use auction houses to liquidate their stuff.

&gt; For those of us who were never quite sure what benefit the buyer's premium
&gt; bestowed upon us, here's eB*y's helpful information (given to justify
&gt; adding 10% to their &quot;Great Collections&quot; auctions):

&gt;&quot;Most traditional auction houses charge a buyer's premium of 10 to
&gt; 20 percent of the sales price to cover their costs for services that are
&gt; essential for successful auctioning of high-end fine art, antiques, and
&gt; other unique collectibles. More specifically, auctioneers collect a premium
&gt; to pay for value-added services such as authenticity guarantee, provenance
&gt; research, sales previews, and property storage.&quot; (end quote)

&gt; At one time it was thought that these were just normal costs of running an
&gt; auction business, until Christie's and Sotheby's collaborated in
&gt; introducing the buyer's premium a few years ago.

&gt; Reminds me of the scam perpetrated by new-car dealers in the US. You'll
&gt; often see a line on the window sticker of popular models (along with all
&gt; the usual add-ons like air conditioning, roof racks, etc.):
&gt; ADM - $500.00 or
&gt; ADP - $600.00
&gt; The unwary car buyer doesn't find out until it's too late that these
&gt; cryptic acronynms stand for Added Dealer Margin and Added Dealer Profit.

BTW, not all these houses with no buyer's premium sell just crap --
one local to me sold a FLW chair for over $17,000 this summer.

&gt;They do. Up until recently I only paid Christies 6% and Phillips 5% but that
&gt;had to do with the total $ a year I gave them. Anyone could have the same nego
&gt;power. However, a few months ago they changed things to 6% to everyone. I
&gt;guess that happened with the impending investigation.

&gt;Their buyers premium however went from 15% to 18%

"/> Hi Reyne, the situation here with Christie's at the moment (unless it has
changed radically within the last two weeks, better NOT! as the buggers
currently owe me money) ... buyers premium 15% ... seller's commission rate
normal auction type (antiques/collectibles/fine art) 10% Joe Public .. the
trade commission (seller's fees) and regular consignors is still 6% - that's
on lots making over 500UKP. Which, I think, now includes insurance. Insurance
used to be 1% of the hammer price.

The 500UKP limited is in fact rather meaningless (although they do quote a
rate for lots making below 500UKP - higher of course) as Christie's (and
Sotheby's) will NOT accept any lots from the provinces via the local reps to
the London sale rooms in the first place, unless the lot is ensured to make
over 500UKP. At least in this &quot;Province&quot; closer to London may be different.

If it's worth less that 500 then I just use my local auction outlets, or in
the case of Joe Public, lots worth under (estimated) 500UKP the Christie's
local rep just pans out these lots on the behalf of Joe P to the local
auctions within that particular province (local area) ... of course, in such
a case Christie's get a payback from the local auction house, just like any
other dealer would get his/her introductory fee for doing the same thing.

And what kind of merchandise is this auctionhouse selling? Household contents
I suspect?

The reason behind not charging a buyers premium is because more than likely
they are hocking their own wares. They probably run ads in the paper
advertising for buying whole house contents etc. This is what they do with the
drek.

I cannot imagine that they are not charging the consignor quite the bundle if
they are not charging buyers premium.

I tell ya what. Why don't you call them and say you have some things you want
to consign, and let us know what the sellers commission % is.

IOW, the auction house can now tell sellers that they are only paying 20%
instead of 25% comission, without mentioning that the selling price (net of
buyer's premium) will also be lower.

In the real world (not GC), I'm sure many bidders don't figure the premium
into their bids, so it does in fact increase their spending. Whether any of
the increase trickles back to the consignor is debatable.

Over here we have 2 seperate sales

Christies Rockefeller Center which has a house minimum of 10K (meaning nothing
is supposed to go into their sales with less than a $10,000 minimum)

Christies East - $2,000 minimum

Sellers are charged
6% commission
Insurance
Buy back premium if it doesnt sell
Photography ($400 for a 1/4 page)

It does get expensive, however they do tend to get good money for most things.

Sothebys is the same, except they dont have 2 different locations for the 2
sales. Its just Sothebys, and Sothebys Arcade.

The chair was part of a sale where everything that night was from one

well-advertised and sold to a phone bidder, they would never have
gotten that kind of money locally.

started clapping. I asked my husband the same question. He was like &quot;$40,000 is
alot to some people&quot; - um well yea it is - so are you saying people clap when
they see expensive crap sell? Egad!

But yes most times the pre-sale estimates at the Rockefeller Plaza are scary
and the results even more mind boggling. Never been but someday I'll get there
for the craic, even just to shout and applaud.

Hey Reyne, sometimes at our local sales up goes a rip roaring laughter in

Ronnie,

Usually they only take consignments less then 10K if

a) they are coming with a group of important things

b) they relate to an important thing in a sale

c) one owner sale

Let me know if you come over for a sale. We can sit in the back and clap
together.

Actually, its rare that you see anyone clapping at a NY sale.

They know better!

and the phone bidder would come in at the last second. It went on for too long

"/> Reyne,

I can recall only one time people have clapped at an auction I've been to,
although granted I haven't been to hundreds and hundreds. It was over a sheet
of tin that was shaped and lithographed as a figure of a black boy. One arm was
hinged and the hand had an attachment for a garden hose. The idea was that you
could stand it in your yard and attach a hose, and it would look like the
little black boy was watering your grass. Sold for one thousand dollars even
after LOTS of spirited bidding. Afterwards everyone clapped but me, I was too
busy keeping my jaw from dropping to the floor. I would have required about a
thousand bucks before I would be willing to take such a horrible thing home,
let along display it there. No accounting for taste.

&gt;And what kind of merchandise is this auctionhouse selling? Household contents
&gt;I suspect?
&gt;The reason behind not charging a buyers premium is because more than likely
&gt;they are hocking their own wares. They probably run ads in the paper
&gt;advertising for buying whole house contents etc. This is what they do with the
&gt;drek.

"/> This is definitely not a high end auction house. However, they do
have some real gems mingled in with the dross now and then. They do
seem to draw quite a few dealers from the Charleston area who seem to
know their stuff. I go mostly for the glass and have found a few
really nice pieces. One buy turned out to be a tragedy--I bid on and
won a milk glass Lincoln platter-pictured in Belknap's &quot;Milk Glass&quot;
for just a few dollars and someone dropped it and broke it before they
gave it to me. I know this is not in the same ballpark as a Steuben or
Tiffany but it neverless the loss broke my heart along with the
platter. They felt so bad about this that they. of course, didn't
charge me for it but have given me several pieces of fairly nice milk
glass since.

&gt;&gt;BTW, not all these houses with no buyer's premium sell just crap --
&gt;&gt;one local to me sold a FLW chair for over $17,000 this summer.

&gt;I'd have bought that myself even WITH auction fees.

"/> Ronnie, I'm curious. Now that you've seen a picture of the chair (I'd
bet it's not quite what you had in mind) do you still think it was
such a good deal? Before you answer, let me describe the condition a
little better. It has surface rust all over, the leather seat pad is
torn on one corner, and one leg had a weld seam that may be an early
repair. Say you did get it, would you clean the rust off (it couldn't
possibly be patina, could it?) or sell it as is?
