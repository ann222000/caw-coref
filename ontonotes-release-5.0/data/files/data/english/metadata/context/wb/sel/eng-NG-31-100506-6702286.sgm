Preventing rust on rotors - help needed....

2002 Monte Carlo  with 4 wheel disc brakes.... I keep the car outside covered by a car
cover.    It gets used every 3 or 4 months for special trips,  but stays idle most of the
time...sorta like a spare backup vehicle when the daily driver is in for maintenance or
repair.

Is there any way to minimize  rust from forming on the rotors??   I know a little rust
is normal but these are rusting pretty badly and screwing up the pads.....   Seems
that I have to disassemble and clean the brake parts before using the car.

Is there a way to prevent this from happening ???    It's not worthwhile taking the
car out every week and then have to clean the road garbage off the paint coat and
windows..... depending upon time of year,  the roads are wet...snowy,  dirty or full of
tar, bugs and insects.

What other options are available ?   Shoot brake parts cleaner on the rotors and
pads and wipe them off before using car ??

Help !!!

Have you tried putting grease on the rotors?  ;)

What am I missing here??  Grease on the rotors (even WD40)  will saturate and ruin
the pads..will it not ??    Rotors and pads are fully assembled on car.

Take the rotors off and store them where it is dry.

Just remember.... other people are reading this thread also....so if a whole bunch of
cars go sliding past stop signs in your neighborhood... you have no one to blame
but yourself !!!

Peter  (Well at least the rotor's don't rust anymore).

Sounds like a royal pita,  but    I can get them back on and adjusted in less than an
hour......so yeah..... this might be workable if other options are not available.

I know dealers have the same problem with cars sitting on their lots for a few months...
how do they manage the problem ??

Hi Peter...

Just in case - it was clearly a joke - the winking smiley
face at the end of the line indicated it.

(and for what little it's worth, it wouldn't stop either)

I'm not a mechanic, just an old retired electrical guy who
does about 1000 km's a year, and I have the same problem....
can't think of any way to prevent flash rusting.

Take care.

Ken

When I worked at the Chevy and Ford dealerships, we did not worry
about it.  Some times the pads would rust to the rotors and there
would be a noticeble jerk when starting out.
But the rust never seemed to hurt anything.

Don't worry about it, the first time you brake, it will shear the rust off.

I've had my Impala rotors show rust overnight after a rainstorm.  The brakes
were grabby first stop or two, but then they were ok.  Simply drive the car
more, or store it inside.

It's quite normal for today's rotors to rust quickly if not used regularly
Pete.  This is not unique to GM.  It poses no problem and won't hurt the
pads - not sure why you're saying that the rust is screwing up the pads.
Your best bet is going to be running the car every week or two.

An explanation

Bought the car new in 2002   drove it home from the dealership.
Used it for  the summer and put it away (under car cover) for
several  months during the winter. At this point it became a spare car
and when I drove it again there was noticeable pulsation....grabbing and
high spot when braking.     This diminished over time but never
went away.     I was seldom using the car so it didn't matter
much.    I pulled the rotors this week and they are in pretty sad
shape ....  the original pad rust outline was still visible  (along with a
current rust outline).  As a backup car to the daily beater it has
less than 40K miles        I'm retired so ...no commute,
no stop and go,  no taxiing kids around to school events.   The
daily beater doesn't get all that much use either.

Braking didn't clean the rotors...they were too badly rusted.

Time to look at options before throwing a new set of
rotors and pads at the car....  (history repeating itself).

Option #1

Paul suggested keeping the
rotors off the car.  This will work during periods of
extended storage...(like over the wintertime)...it doesn't
take much to throw them back on as long as the caliper
is supported properly.

Option #2

Run the car more frequently...  This is actually more of
a problem because it's parked off to the side in a space
that's difficult to manuveur out of.  There are birds and
trees all over the place.   Remove the car cover and it
will soon get filthy  with bird droppings, sap,  branches and
leaves.

Any other options are much appreciated !!

Thanks !!

Peter

Where I have seen this to be a significant problem is in areas that salt or
salt/sand the
roads a lot in winter weather.  Otherwise the fresh water surface rusting
doesnt seem to
be too bad.

Hosing down the rotors with fresh water prior to storage to remove the salt
might help.

When I store a care outside for an extended time, I park it on a tarp then
pull that tarp up the sides and hold in place with bungee cords. This will
minimalism the ground moisture that the care is exposed to. Then I'll drape
another tarp down and hold in place with bungees. Do this when the car is
dry. Any moisture trapped inside can damage the paint.  You may want to put
a "Dri-Z-Air" canister in or even an electric heater to help control the
moisture.

You may want to get one of those cheap canvas car sheds (not cover) that you
see all over the place. This will eliminate the problems of trapped moisture
damaging the paint. But still park it on a tarp. My '93 Grand Prix is stored
this way and hasn't been driven in at least four weeks and the rotors are
still nice and shinny. We have a lot of rain and morning fog and
condensation.

Since it is not driven much, I'd get one of those battery chargers that
maintain the charge so that the battery remains healthy.

There is another way IF you want to bother with it. Bag the car in a car
bag and use a vacuum to suck out the air, no air = no rust.

Also replace the brake pads with a good ceramic and they won't rust
into scrap either.

Unfortunately the car bag is for indoor use only, I think if the OP
could store the vehicle indoors to begin with, this problem would most
likely be reduced or eliminated.

I have a story along these lines I'd like to share.

A co-worker of mine was at a local factory doing some work. A bunch of oil
had leaked from a machine all over the floor. One of the maintenance guys
was asking for advice on how to go about cleaning it up quickly. My coworker
jokingly said, "I'd pour naptha on it and light it on fire."

The guy did it and nearly burned the building down.
