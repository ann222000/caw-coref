1)  Bush nixes jail time for convicted perjurer
Rocky Mount Telegram

&quot;President Bush spared former White House aide I. Lewis 'Scooter' Libby from
a 2 1/2-year prison term in the CIA leak investigation Monday, delivering a
political thunderbolt in the highly charged criminal case. Bush said the
sentence was just too harsh. Bush's move came just five hours after a
federal appeals panel ruled that Libby could not delay his prison term.&quot;

2)  Pressed for money, McCain cuts campaign staff
New York Times

&quot;The presidential campaign of Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican
who once seemed poised to be his party's nominee, plunged into political and
financial uncertainty today as a fund-raising collapse forced it to dismiss
dozens of workers and aides said there were signs of his campaign
hemorrhaging support among Republicans across the country. ... Department
heads in Mr. McCain's campaigns spent today calling into lower-level staff
to inform them of their dismissals with two weeks notice. Mr. McCain's
advisers said they were cutting back on consultants, with those in the
fund-raising area losing their guaranteed monthly retainers. The moves
amounted to a drastic scaling back of what once had been a gold-plated
campaign.&quot; (07/03/07)

Evansville Courier &amp; Press

&quot;At least three physicians were identified Monday among suspects arrested in
Britain's failed car bomb attacks, and authorities announced three new
arrests -- including a doctor in Australia -- as the investigation spread
overseas. British media reports said at least five of the detainees in
Britain were physicians. British police confirmed a Palestinian doctor and
Iraqi physician were among those held, while Australian officials said an
Indian doctor working there had been detained in the case.&quot; (07/03/07)

Reuters

&quot;U.S. forces killed at least 23 insurgents suspected of having links with al
Qaeda during a fierce battle in Iraq's western Anbar province over the
weekend, the military said on Tuesday. The military said U.S. and Iraqi
forces, backed by war planes and helicopters, confronted a large group of
militants as they were preparing to launch a series of suicide bomb attacks
in the Anbar capital Ramadi, 110 km (68 miles) west of Baghdad.&quot; (07/03/07)

5)  Japan: Defense Minister resigns over WWII remarks
RIA Novosti [Russia]

&quot;Japanese Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma announced his resignation Tuesday
amid criticism over statements he made suggesting U.S. nuclear bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II were inevitable. The
minister told a news conference in Tokyo that he had met with Japan's Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and the premier had accepted his resignation. ... In his
comments made over the weekend, Kyuma, from Nagasaki, said the bombing
caused great suffering in the city, but he did not resent the U.S. nuclear
attacks because they prevented the Soviet Union from occupying the island of
Hokkaido. The statement came under fierce criticism from public
organizations representing survivors of the atomic bombings, opposition
lawmakers, and even several Cabinet members. Kyuma's comments seriously
weakened the position of the ruling Liberal-Democratic Party less than a
month before July 29 elections for the upper house of parliament.&quot;

6)  Family sues over delayed execution
USA Today

&quot;The mother of a condemned inmate whose execution took an hour longer than
is typical sued the head of Ohio's prisons on Monday. It took almost 90
minutes to carry out the execution of Joseph Clark in May 2006. The lawsuit,
filed in a Cincinnati federal court, said the execution amounted to
unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment. Executions last about 20
minutes on average.&quot; (07/02/07)

MSNBC

&quot;The U.S. military accused Iran on Monday of a direct role in a
sophisticated militant attack that killed five American troops in Iraq,
portraying Tehran as waging a proxy war through Shiite extremists. The
claims over the January attack marked a sharp escalation in U.S. accusations
that Iran has been arming and financing Iraqi militants, and for the first
time linked the Iranian effort to its ally, Lebanon's Shiite Hezbollah
militia.&quot; (07/02/07)

&quot;The ATF no longer routinely checks addresses of some buyers at gun shows

investigations that appear to have been warranted, the 56-page report by

&quot;A suspected al-Qaida suicide bomber plowed his car Monday into a group of
Spanish tourists visiting a temple linked to the ancient Queen of Sheba,
killing seven Spaniards and two Yemenis in a part of Yemen known for its
lawlessness. The attack came less than two weeks after the U.S. Embassy
warned Americans to avoid the area, which until recent years was rarely
visited by tourists because of frequent kidnappings of foreigners.&quot;

14) CA: Land theft duel flares in Assembly
Salinas Californian

&quot;The debate over how much to restrict government's use of its eminent domain
powers to obtain private property for shopping malls and other developments
resumes this week in the state Assembly. The Judiciary Committee will
consider rival constitutional amendments on Tuesday, one by Assemblyman
Hector De La Torre, D-South Gate, and the other by Assemblywoman Mimi
Walters, R-Mission Viejo. The Walters legislation would, with a couple of
exceptions, allow government agencies to use eminent domain to buy private
property only for public projects. The exemptions cover property for use by
utilities and for redevelopment projects to promote economic development
near closed military bases in San Bernardino County. De La Torre's proposal
would ban use of eminent domain proceedings to acquire owner-occupied homes
for private developments. It also would prohibit using eminent domain to
transfer property owned by small businesses -- those with no more than 25
full-time employees -- to other private owners unless it was part of a
comprehensive program to eliminate blight.&quot; (07/02/07)

15) CA: Anguished tales of property taken by state
San Francisco Chronicle

&quot;Years ago, Carla Ruff stored her grandmother's jewelry and a file of
personal documents in a safe-deposit box at her bank in San Francisco's Noe
Valley, thinking they would always be there when she wanted them. Not so.
Without giving her notice or acting on evidence that she'd forgotten about
her cache, the bank's staff, under the auspice of the state, determined the
contents of her box to be unclaimed property. ... The paperwork was shredded
and thrown away. Her jewelry was auctioned off on eBay -- for a fraction of
its $80,000 value. Ruff said she didn't know what had happened until January
2006, when an illness in the family sent her to the Bank of America branch
looking for the deed to her house. Weeks later, the bank manager told Ruff
that her property had been seized by the state under a law that requires the
government to take control of lost or abandoned assets.&quot; (07/02/07)

16) NH: Bedrock state listing to left?
Boston Globe

&quot;Granite Staters have spent the last half-century reveling in their
reputation as the keepers of Yankee libertarianism, the rock-ribbed
neighbors to the north who loathe taxes, Democrats, big government, and --
well, anything else that reminds them of Massachusetts. But now, Democrats
are running both houses of the state Legislature, the corner office, and the
Executive Council for the first time since the 19th century. This spring,
New Hampshire became the fourth state to adopt same-sex civil unions. The
House passed legislation, later killed in the Senate, that would have
enacted a mandatory seat belt law in the last state to lack one. And, the
other day, the Legislature adopted a budget that will increase spending by
17 percent over two years, along with a 28-cent cigarette tax increase to
help pay for it.&quot; [editor's note: Did the Free Staters choose too quickly,

Guillen, a dancer at a Salem club called Cheetah's, who gave a lap dance to
an undercover officer in 2005. Salem residents hoping to limit Salem strip
club activity called the ruling a setback. They said they hope to get a

government regulation of strip clubs.&quot; [editor's note: A constitutional

18) AZ: Migrant bill awaits governor

&quot;It sounds simple enough. But the fate of a proposal to enact new penalties
for employers of undocumented workers hangs in the balance. So, too, do
uncounted businesses on both sides of the debate and the more than a
quarter-million workers who make up the state's underground labor pool.
Named simply House Bill 2779, the measure is perhaps the most significant
bill of the recently adjourned legislative session, and it delves into the
state's biggest issue: illegal immigration. Guessing Napolitano's decision
has become the biggest parlor game in Arizona politics. The deadline for
that decision is today.&quot; (07/02/07)

19) Schools grapple with how to integrate
Christian Science Monitor

&quot;At the crossroads of education and civil rights, a new signpost has been
planted by the US Supreme Court, leaving school districts that have been
striving for integration wondering which way to proceed. Last week's ruling
struck down two districts' voluntary desegregation plans because they relied
too heavily on students' race in school assignments. A separate opinion by
Justice Anthony Kennedy left room for some consideration of racial
demographics, but a number of observers believe it would be more practical
for districts to shift toward balancing school populations on the basis of
factors such as income level. ... But whatever strategy districts try, they
could still face opposition from those who say the time has come to stop
'social engineering' and to strengthen neighborhood schools.&quot; (07/02/07)

&quot;The attempted London car bombings were meant to be detonated by calls to

police to trace those behind the failed attacks last Friday, the London

to set off blasts when they were called, but the devices failed to detonate

6400 block of Melody Lane, near Northwest Highway and Skillman Street, when
a man police identified as Mr. Myers approached him, according to a police
report. Mr. Myers put a handgun in Mr. Kerboua's face and demanded money,
police said. Thinking it was a joke, Mr. Kerboua pushed the gun away, but
Mr. Myers pointed it at his face again. Mr. Kerboua opened his back door and
handed Mr. Myers a cup containing $242.50. Mr. Myers then pointed the gun at
Mr. Kerboua's stomach and told him, 'I'm going to shoot you, [expletive],'
according to the police report. Mr. Kerboua then drew a .38-caliber Smith &amp;
Wesson handgun from his front pocket and shot Mr. Myers in the throat. Mr.
Myers fell to the ground but kept his handgun pointed at Mr. Kerboua, who
then fired two more times into Mr. Myers' shoulder, police said.
Investigators released Mr. Kerboua, who has a concealed handgun permit,
after concluding that he had shot in self-defense.&quot; (07/01/07)

because I don't have grass growing.' They said, 'You're in here for that?&quot;

otherwise.&quot; (07/02/07)

25) TX: Marriage law backers say it's way to improve society
My San Antonio

&quot;Marriage and family counselor Tim Louis believes a new law rewarding
couples for taking prenuptial classes -- and penalizing those who don't --
has gotten an unfair rap from critics. The law, House Bill 2685 by Rep.
Warren Chisum, a conservative Republican from the Panhandle, prompted
derisive comments from opponents who called it the worst sort of government
intrusion. It calls for couples who take an eight-hour 'successful marriage'
course approved by the state to get a free marriage license, with those who
don't paying a doubled fee of $60. The bill might be the most obvious
example of government 'nanny state' efforts to affect behavior, which
traditionally have been associated with liberal Democrats. Other such laws,
passed by the majority-Republican Legislature and signed by Republican Gov.
Rick Perry, take aim at such 'deadly sins' as gluttony and sloth. &quot;

26) Counting our blessings on Liberty Day
The Price of Liberty
by Nathan A. Barton

&quot;Traditionally, the 4th of July is celebrated as 'Independence Day' because
the Declaration of Independence was formally dated that day. However, as
historians, especially libertarian historians, are wont to point out, the
2nd of July, 1776, was the day that the Continental Congress actually voted
to declare independence, and the last of the signers did not get to append
their signatures to the formal copy until some months later. Many people
celebrate the 2nd, then, with actual firing of salutes and other weapons,
rather than with the traditional fireworks of two days later. I chose to
call the 2nd of July, then, 'Liberty Day.'&quot; (07/02/07)

27) A farewell to culture wars
National Review
by Brink Lindsey

&quot;As the country underwent dizzying and wrenching changes, conservatives
defended much that was precious and useful from misguided assault. At the
same time, though, they clung to specific practices and ways of thinking
that were wrongheaded or at least outdated. How, in the future, can
conservatives do a better job of distinguishing between baby and bathwater?
Let me lay my own cards on the table. I consider myself a libertarian, not a
conservative. Yet for all my adult life until quite recently, I was a
conservative sympathizer. In other words, although my own views differed
from those of the mainstream Right in numerous and important respects, I
nonetheless thought that conservative political success was, on balance, a
good thing for the country. I no longer think that.&quot; (06/25/07)

&quot;Libertarians are dreamers. This is both a blessing and a curse. But I'm

thought that as cynical as libertarians seem to be, and as intelligent as
most libertarians are, they would, collectively, be incapable of such Jiminy
Cricket naivete. The reason Ron Paul must be invited to run on the
Libertarian party ticket is because it is now time for the libertarian

31) The end of the journey
The New Republic
by Sam Tanenhaus

&quot;&quot;Peace' seems to be breaking out in many regions of the world,' Francis
Fukuyama exulted in The End of History, the signature manifesto of the
moment, published in the summer of 1989, six months before the Berlin Wall
came down. In those euphoric days it was still possible to think, with
Fukuyama, that 'the developed world,' having writhed through a century-long
'paroxysm of ideological violence, as liberalism contended first with the
remnants of absolutism, then bolshevism and fascism, and finally an updated
Marxism that threatened to lead to the ultimate apocalypse of nuclear war,'
had suddenly achieved 'an unabashed victory of economic and political
liberalism.' It did not take long for the gyre to wobble back onto its
dependably blood-soaked course, pushed along by fresh gusts of ideological
violence and absolutism. Yet for a brief period it really did seem that
history, if it had not actually ended, had at least paused, particularly for
people born in the 1950s.&quot; (07/02/07)

32) Integration defeats quotas
Human Events
by Steve Chapman

&quot;On Thursday, the Supreme Court struck down the use of race in assigning
public school students in Seattle and Louisville. In the aftermath, there
was considerable debate about the abstract legal principles being contested.
But at bottom, the case was about whether it's permissible to close the
schoolhouse door on a child because of his race. Most of us would say no.&quot;

34) We are meant to be here
Salon
by Steve Paulson

&quot;Forget science fiction. If you want to hear some really crazy ideas about
the universe, just listen to our leading theoretical physicists. Wish you
could travel back in time? You can, according to some interpretations of
quantum mechanics. Could there be an infinite number of parallel worlds?
Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Weinberg considers this a real
possibility. Even the big bang, which for decades has been the standard
explanation for how the universe started, is getting a second look. Now,
many cosmologists speculate that we live in a 'multiverse,' with big bangs
exploding all over the cosmos, each creating its own bubble universe with
its own laws of physics. And lucky for us, our bubble turned out to be
life-friendly. But if you really want to start an argument, ask a room full
of physicists this question: Are the laws of physics fine-tuned to support
life?&quot; (07/02/07)

35) Thrown to the lions
The American Spectator
by Doug Bandow

&quot;Someone in the U.S. government finally has noticed the plight of Iraqi
Christians. A congressional appropriations subcommittee has voted to spend
$10 million to aid displaced religious minorities within Iraq. That mostly
means Christians. Although Islam long has been in the ascendancy in Iraq,
the so-called Assyrians, who speak a neo-Aramaic language, represent a
distinct religious minority, generally grouped in the Chaldean, Apostolic
Catholic, and Syriac Orthodox churches. The Assyrians predate the rise of
Islam, representing a 7,000 year-old civilization. They have survived
numerous episodes of war and catastrophe. Today, however, the Iraqi
Christian community faces possible extermination.&quot; (07/02/07)

36) Normative versus positive statements
Rebirth of Reason
by Tibor R. Machan

&quot;Professor Walter Williams is a very good economists but not so good at
moral philosophy, as is demonstrated by his recent column (titled in my
local paper, 'Don't Confuse what is with what should be.') In this piece he
lays out what can fairly be said is now a widely discredited theory about
whether moral judgments, like those in the various sciences, are subject to
proof. He states that 'Normative, or subjective statements deal with what's
good or bad, or what ought to be or should be' and adds, that 'there are no
facts whatsoever to which we can appeal to settle any disagreement.' He goes
on: 'One person's opinion on [a normative] matter is just as good as
another's.' It is true enough that this is one theory that has been
influential especially in modern philosophy, ever since David Hume is said
to have defended it (although there is doubt about that too), but it is by
no means the only one. A reason for this is that the theory is
self-defeating -- it implies that normative statements should not be taken
as seriously as scientific ones, yet that statement is itself a normative
statement.&quot; (07/02/07)

38) Marriage, trademarked
Slate
by Kenji Yoshino

&quot;Conservatives have long made the argument that gay marriages will
negatively affect straight marriages. In a 1996 congressional debate, Rep.
Henry Hyde said the very idea of same-sex marriage 'demeaned' his marriage.
As if anticipating the more personal question of which of his three
marriages would be most demeaned, Hyde jumped up a level of abstraction: 'It
demeans the institution.' He is far from alone in this belief. Many of the
44 states that define marriage as between one man and one woman denominate
these statutory or constitutional provisions as 'Defense of Marriage' Acts.
The name cleverly treats same-sex marriage as an assault on marriage rather
than as a more inclusive form of that institution. This objection is
importantly distinct from practical objections to same-sex marriage -- like
the contention that marriage is about procreation. What is being defended is
not the purpose of the institution, but its honor. Elizabeth Edwards is
understandably puzzled by this formulation.&quot; (07/02/07)

40) Diplomatic non-sequiturs
Unqualified Offerings
by Thoreau

&quot;What the ambassador doesn't get is that it doesn't matter what you think of
the people that you victimize. What matters is that you've found a way to
rationalize victimizing them. Once you do that, you cross the line from
human to monster. And yes, I'm aware that all (or at least most) of the
people in that mosque are probably not direct victims of US foreign policy.
(Some may be refugees, and the list of indirect victims is obviously quite
large, but we'll leave that aside for now.) The fact remains that they
appear to have some empathy for people who are victims of war, torture,
sponsorship of dictators, and various other acts. They look at the victims
of these acts and they say 'Damn! That's horrible! What the hell kind of
jerk does this?' But the ambassador looks at them and comes up with some
sort of reason why these victims are acceptable collateral damage, and so
it's all good.&quot; (07/01/07)

43) Our militarized police departments
Reason
by Radley Balko

&quot;Militarization is a broad term that refers to using military-style weapons,
tactics, training, uniforms, and even heavy equipment by civilian police
departments. It's a troubling trend because the military has a very
different and distinct role than our domestic peace officers. The military's
job is to annihilate a foreign enemy. The police are supposed to protect us
while upholding our constitutional rights. It's dangerous to conflate the
two. But that's exactly what we're doing.&quot; (07/02/07)

48) Kissing up to K Street
In These Times
by David Sirota

&quot;In 1903, journalist William Riordan published a series of interviews with
George Washington Plunkitt, who was probably the most famous leader of New
York's Tammany Hall (other than Boss Tweed himself). During a discussion of
Lincoln Steffens' then-new book The Shame of the Cities, Plunkitt told
Riordan that Steffens 'can't see no difference between honest graft and
dishonest graft and consequent, he gets things all mixed up.' The same thing
could be said for our Congress. 'Honest graft,' said Plunkitt, is when 'the
politician looks after his own interests, the organization's interests and
the people's interests all at the same time.' Dishonest graft, by contrast,
is engaged in by 'looters' who 'go in for themselves alone without
considering their organization or the people.'&quot; [editor's note: The saddest

flattering headlines, generous air time, a book contract or the
old-fashioned black jack that never misses: campaign cash. ... The ambitious
can't resist his blandishments, nor his power to get or keep them in office
where they can return his favors. Mae West would be green with envy at his

almost concluded that Ann had disappeared, at least from my radar screen,
and if that meant less interest in my answering her outlandish charges, it
was a small price to pay. No such luck. The occasion for Ann's return to
white-hot prominence is strictly commercial. Her paperback edition of
Godless, the book that made headlines by ridiculing 9/11 widows ('I've never
seen women enjoying their husbands' deaths so much'), is just out, and Ann
needs to make news to make sales. That required a new target, and she found
one in John Edwards. If Elizabeth Edwards helped Ann's cause (and her
husband's) by taking Ann on, it's the media mavens who really deserve the
blame here, for providing the forums for Ann to ply her shameful wares.&quot;

infiltrating American organizations, conspiring with Mafia groups, spying on
journalists -- perhaps even murder. Last week, the latest paroxysm of

boosting rehabilitation efforts or easing the system's overcrowding may have
been his primary concern, the $3,300 check his campaign received a week
later from the California Correctional Peace Officers Association (CCPOA)

its usual arch-nemesis, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, to craft
a bill that would close a loophole in the 1993 Brady law that let Seung-Hui
Cho, the Virginia Tech shooter, purchase weapons even though he had earlier
been deemed mentally ill. While the NRA says its participation made the
measure less draconian and even gained back some ground lost in earlier
gun-control battles, the Gun Owners of America and even a loud chorus of NRA
backers are blasting the group for heresy.&quot; (07/01/07)

&quot;It is widely believed that capitalism, to the extent that it is still
allowed to function, is responsible for our problem of racial
discrimination. Blacks, Hispanics, and other ethnic groups are seen to be
'under-utilized' by business, and therefore many people conclude that the
cause must be that businessmen are guilty of racial discrimination. Having
arrived at this conclusion, the solution is simple and obvious: Merely
compel businesses to hire more individuals from these groups. Mandate
'affirmative action' programs, 'goals' or quotas in hiring and promotion,
enforce these with a federal bureaucracy and the courts, and everything will
be fair and equal. A closer examination will show, however, that racial
discrimination, far from being caused by capitalism, is in fact the result
of governmental interferences with capitalism.&quot; (written 02/81; posted

voting evil per se? My answer is no. The State is a Moloch that surrounds
us, and it would be grotesque and literally impossible to function if we
refused it our 'sanction' across the board. ... if the State, for reasons of
its own, allows us a periodic choice between two or more masters, I don't
believe we are aggressors if we participate in order to vote ourselves more
kindly masters or to vote in people who will abolish or repeal the
oppression. In fact, I think that we owe it to our own liberty to use such
opportunities to advance the cause.&quot; That's Murray N. Rothbard, from Konkin
on Libertarian Strategy, a reply to Samuel Edward Konkin III's New
Libertarian Manifesto. Discuss. And as a side note, those who prefer
dead-tree editions can find the manifesto and Rothbard's reply (as well as
replies from LeFevre and &quot;Filthy Pierre&quot;) in a fine trade paperback edition,
cheap, at www.kopubco.com/nlm_trade.html .

73) Survey: Libertarian Perspective of 2008 Presidential race
LibertarianLists.Com

&quot;The purpose of this online survey is to determine how libertarians intend
to vote in the 2008 presidential elections. It also asks issue-specific
questions and pertinent demographic background (i.e. voter registration
status and political party affiliation). It should take the typical user
between 5 and 15 minutes to compete. This survey is designed to be
distributed to a large number (between 10,000 and 30,000) of respondents.&quot;
