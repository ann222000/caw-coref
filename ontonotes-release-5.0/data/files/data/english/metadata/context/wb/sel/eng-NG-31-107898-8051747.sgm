Until I get a bigger room, I can't imagine much improvement over the
latest version of the Quad 63 at about $10k.

The amp list makes the ARC Reference series look like a bargain. Isn't
there a kit version of the Audio Note?

What are you doing for the back wave on the Quads?
I've got a good sized room with them at a good distance off the rear
wall
(though other speakers behind em) and I found a rear wave diffuser
to be a nice image enhancer.

I don't know...if I went for a new amp it'd either be tube based
or something with digital room correction.   I'm torn between
opposite ends of the spectrum...

They're about a quarter of the way into the room and I haven't noticed
any reflected sound or a lack of clarity. I might have a natural

The local shop has Lyngdorff/TaCT stuff, probably a step above the

I'm still happy with the NAD integrated amp section I use. An upgrade
would be a luxury or for fun.

I made some from Home Depot shelves and legs.  About a foot
tall.  Puts my ears dead center with the chair reclined.
Those speakers have a very symmetrical sweetspot,
being off vertically is same as horizontal IME.
I heard some DeVore speakers at Marcs awhile back and they
were extraordinary in their ability to put an image in space.
I would have liked to hear them with a sub as they had a 40ish
hz port and I didn't get the impression they filled the low mid
bass.  Still they gave a very realistic impression.

Here's an opportunity :). Stereo Design
has used Meridian DSP6000
(they've got 4 on consignment sale).
http://www.stereodesign.com/used/usedlist.htm
and the 6000C.  That should be one hell of a
surround/stereo system.  Totals only a tad
over 20K.  No amp required. :)

Thanks, but I found a pair overhere.

I bolted 2 pairs of MG1i together, thereby creating a surface of
nearly 4 sq. meters in total.
I already use them as a subwoofer with my pair of MG1C , I can
guarantee you that they deliver bass enough.
No kick in the stomach as some cone subs can, but just right for me.

You'd be right.  There are three or four different set of speakers
that retail around the $10,000 mark that are not significantly
bettered by the super-speakers.  The current Quad ESLs are among them.

&gt;&gt; Until I get a bigger room, I can't imagine much improvement over the
&gt;&gt; latest version of the Quad 63 at about $10k.

&gt; You'd be right.  There are three or four different set of speakers

&gt; bettered by the super-speakers.  The current Quad ESLs are among them.

I believe that, but, since none of us really knows, I have a feeling that
the point of diminishing returns may be much lower. Maybe there is no
correlation between speakers and price, above a fairly modest point. It
seems to me that to make an impeccable speaker, one needs only the
following:

1. Good quality drivers
2. A good lab
3. Good ears
4. A good theory to back up the design.

The Quads, as simulated point sources, have all of the above. But, suppose a
multidriver  Linkwitz Reilly has a good theory behind it?  Take some rigid
composite drivers, not expensive these days, throw them in a box, and,
voila! one has a Polk LSi, which won some magazine's (Sensible Sound)
speaker_of_the_year award.

So many speakers, even expensive ones, are missing one of the four.

Well, first of all, the really expensive speaker systems tend to be
much more sensitive to things like room set-up and associated
equipment.  If you can't hook them up to very fine equipment,
amplifiers especially, you'll never hear the difference.  A $50,000
pair of speakers will not sound that much better than a $10,000 pair
if you're hooking it all up to a $2000 integrated amplifier.  So that
would be your #5...having the room and the associated equipment to
relay those differences.

The $10,000 price point does seem to be the sweet spot for great
speakers.  You have the latest Quad ESLs, the Harbeth Monitor 40s, the
Martin-Logan Summits, the Zu Audio Definitions, the Penaudio
Serenades, and a few others that are all the speaker you'll ever need.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; They're about a quarter of the way into the room and I haven't noticed
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; any reflected sound or a lack of clarity.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Nor did I until I tried one. First I just used pillows propped up as simple
&gt; &gt;&gt; test after having read a writeup on the sally. Its easy to try.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Nothing near as dramatic as stands, but I found it a plus.

&gt; &gt; I'll throw a comforter over the cds as an experiment.

&gt; &gt; I've tried stands, well, milk crates, and the speakers are now on the
&gt; &gt; ground. I have the &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; stands somewhere, but lack the
&gt; &gt; screws necessary for a secure fit. My listening position is relatively
&gt; &gt; close to the ground.

&gt;  I made some from Home Depot shelves and legs.  About a foot
&gt; tall.  Puts my ears dead center with the chair reclined.
&gt; Those speakers have a very symmetrical sweetspot,
&gt; being off vertically is same as horizontal IME.
&gt; I heard some DeVore speakers at Marcs awhile back and they
&gt; were extraordinary in their ability to put an image in space.
&gt; I would have liked to hear them with a sub as they had a 40ish
&gt; hz port and I didn't get the impression they filled the low mid
&gt; bass.  Still they gave a very realistic impression.
">

I'm using much better amplification right now.  You heard the Gibbon
Super 8s with that Exposure 3010S integrated, and then with Chinese
300B monoblocks and a McIntosh C220 preamp that had not been broken in
yet.

Right now, I'm using both a Nagra PSA and a McIntosh 275, with a
ModWright 36.5 line stage, and the Gibbons are very seamless through
the bass.

Quite simply not true -- it is all about intelligent design. A well
designed and well applied LM3886 chip-amp [~$3.00 ea] used in
conjunction with appropriately designed loudspeaker can sound
extremely realistic. What really counts is the understanding of what
fools the brain into believing what it hears is &quot;real&quot; -- as in giving
the brain enough psychoacoustic clues to understand that what it is
hearing comes from a live sonic event [the raison d'etre of high-end
audio]

There is a simple and empirical way to prove this -- find someone who
owns a Siegfried Linkwitz designed PLUTO(+) loudspeaker, which you can
build for less than $1,000.00 USD [ http://www.linkwitzlab.com/Pluto/
intro.htm], and spend an hour listening to it.

WARNING*** the above experience has been known to radically alter
audiophile perceptions, causing a severe paradigm shift, resulting in
the chronic of use $100K(+) boat anchors.

I enjoyed the Exposure 3010S I had for review for a couple of months,
but then it started wearing out its welcome by sounding thin and
harsh, especially compared to some of the more expensive tube amps I
had on hand.  Still, it was an excellent piece for $2100 (and $500
extra for the phono stage, which was actually pretty nice).  I think I
preferred the Valve Audio Exclame 100, a hybrid integrated from South
Africa which retailed for $1700.  I don't think either of them sounded
piss poor, but when I plugged some more expensive separates back into
my system, the differences were not subtle.

There are some integrateds in the $3000 to $5000 range that are quite
superb, such as the Naim SuperNAIT, the Valve Audio Predator, the
Unison Unico SE modded by Underwood and the Sugden A21SE.

I can't verify what was in the Predator I listened to, since I'm not
the one who reviewed it.  I spent a few months with its little
brother, the Exclame 100, which had Telefunken 6922s in it.  While it
was certainly less warm than the Yamamoto Sound Craft gear I used as a
reference at the time, I still thought it had a nice smooth sound, and
very deep bass.  It was also quite dynamic. For me, the Predator just
had more of everything, as was extremely dynamic as well.

of even the most expensive (or more rationally the highest-performing)

Well, while &quot;really expensive&quot; speaker systems tend to be
sensitive to things like associated equipment (usually, this
means amps that balk at killer-grade loads), the laws of
acoustics should not make it any more difficult to get them
properly sited in a good room than a pair of budget speakers

Research that Floyd Toole did a while back showed that in
many cases ultra-expensive speakers often performed
considerably worse than some rather low-priced versions.

A high price may be a sign that the manufacturer is pulling
a con, rather than a sign that superior sound is going to be
delivered.

I recently auditioned (review coming up in the future) a
$350 pair of satellite speakers working with a decent
subwoofer that held their own with a $5500 pair in my middle
system.

&gt; I enjoyed the Exposure 3010S I had for review for a couple of months,

&gt; extra for the phono stage, which was actually pretty nice).  I think I

&gt; Africa which retailed for $1700.  I don't think either of them sounded
&gt; piss poor, but when I plugged some more expensive separates back into
&gt; my system, the differences were not subtle.

&gt; There are some integrateds in the $3000 to $5000 range that are quite

There is simply no difference to speak of between a stereo power
amplifier and a line-stage integrated amp, other than 1) a volume
control (which some pure power amps have anyway-several Mc's-and which
even on some five-figure pieces is no more than a $20 ganged taper
pot) and 2) more than one set of input jacks and a selector, again,
usually a cheap rotary switch.

The best preamp is no preamp, provided the source is reasonable in
level and impedance. The only source that one can think of that might
reasonably not be is a phono cartridge, though some tape machines
might qualify as well. Not professional ones, and with Studers,
Scullys and Ampexes of the 351/450/AG440 class going for peanuts no
sane person would fool with any other kind.

I was recently able to pull the preamp out of the chain in an all-
analog system, since the phono preamp had variable outs. It made a
huge difference in the sound.  So I'd agree...partially.

I used to know this girl who would get really pissed off at me and not
talk to me for weeks.  So I'd tell her that her hair looked nice, or
that I really liked her dress, and I'd get free dinners from her for a

mix him up with Howard, who literally forgets who he is talking to

So what are you, sixty now? Sixty-one?

Personally, I'm glad you don't spend as much time on this group
anymore, although it probably just means you've found another forum.
But the clock is ticking.

And as far as it not being about money...sorry, but giant-killers
simply do not exist in audio.  People like to think they do, but they
don't.  The good stuff costs a lot of money.  Have-nots such as
yourself want to think that good sound is within financial reach. But
all they wind up with is good-enough sound.

When and if you're ever exposed to the good stuff, you'll change your
tune.  You may not admit it in public, but you will.
