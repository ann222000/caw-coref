Our MINI has been overheating, and I have isolated the problem to the
electric cooling fan.  I've ordered the new part from a MINI dealer, but
just got around to checking the service manual for the replacement
procedure.  According to the TIS, you have to remove the front bumper, A/C
condenser and radiator to get to the fan assembly.  Has anyone done this?
Do you  =really=  have to dis-assemble the entire front of the car just to
get to the fan?  It appears to be so "close" that it almost seems impossible
to have to remove so many parts to remove it.

The car is a US spec. model.

Appreciate any input I can get.

Thanks!

Shame.
If you had the REAL Mini the job would have been easy, like most jobs on the
REAL Mini. That's the penalty for being lumbered with the FAKE Mini.

Actually Tim, you are in the right news group. This is
alt.autos.mini......seeing as your question was about the current
production mini. Which is by far more popular and better made than the
"old" style. So no need to apologize. Plus ryan shaw is just a blow hole.

Well, not a great believer in racing on the road, but on the couple of
occasions when one of the fake's has appeared to want to get involved
I have left it for dead. Something to do with lack of driver ability
and the difficulty something so fat has in getting through gaps in
traffic, probably. After all, my Rover Cooper is bog standard apart
from KNN filter, lcb and a single-box, big bore exhaust. Actually,
come to think of it, it blows off most things on the road most of the
time.  Amazing how some prat who has been tailgating you can be
hundreds of yards behind after one roundabout. I routinely find the
Mini to be just as quick point to point in mixed driving as my Subaru
Impreza Turbo....and usually more fun.

It is wider but as far as cornering have you ever driven a real classic mini
cooper S or owned one? admittedly the new Bini is quieter &amp; smother &amp; faster
on a motorway or straight road but I doubt you or anyone else in a bmw Bini
could follow me &amp; keep up with me on a hairpin, bend or corner, as far as
being jealous its just your small mind, yes even its smaller than my car, if
I wanted a bmw bini I would go and buy one, one last point to note, this
newsgroup is for discussing things that relate to the original mini so try &amp;
keep quiet unless you can contribute something positive.

I don't tend to get involved in this sort of slanging match.  Big waste of
time talking to a troll but...

A London bus has a much wider stance than your BMW therefore better
cornering.

I don't have my Mini now, but I would love to have seen a Bini try to
outcorner it at any speed.

Just for the record, the simpleton missive from the previous poster is not
representative of all classic owners.

Most of my friends have both a Mini and a BINI.

I am into classics myself but not because the BINI is a bad car. It is an
impressive car and a very good one. It will also thrash a classis to an inch
of it's life on a race track. Only clueless twits will defend a car as if
they are defending  there national flag.

It's just a freaking car, get a grip.

I understand what you are saying but..

I had an SCCA prepared Trans Am a few years back that I used as occasional
commuter car.

I didn't (read couldn't) afford to drive aggressively on the street. I am
sure there are many riceboy Honda Civic and Accord drivers that are going
home thinking they abused me on the street.

Perhaps the others were not racing you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; car on a race track, nor am I trying to deffend the national flag, at
&gt;&gt;&gt; least not today :-)

Sorry guys, I was just goofing with ya. But, yeah, if that London bus
was only 3 feet tall, it probably would corner fantastic.
And if this newsgroup is for classic mini's "only", then why isn't it
called alt.autos.classicmini ?

Well some ones got to love them I guess....

The real thing will be 40 years on...will they still be basicaly the same
and will people still love them...

The juries out on that one LOL

Personaly I don't have room in the garage for one, and if I did have room
for a a hot hatch it would be a Renault Clio RS185 or the Megane RS225, both
have more pwer, better handling and better looks, and cost a damm site less
to boot LOL...but then thats only my personel opinion

&gt;&gt; Strange how these BMW fans turn out to be such arrogant idiots when they

&gt; I'm a big fan of all cars mate - don't see the point of twats who

&gt; The world would be a lot nicer place without people like you and Ryan.

Because it has existed since long before the new so-called Mini and
will continue to do so long after that temporary aberration has been
forgotten. There is only on Mini and we don't need reminding that all
of them are classics. If you want to talk about the other thing there
is alt.autos.newmini. I'm told it's mostly full of whines and whinges
about unreliability, atrocious build quality, catching fire and
recalls, but then I can't say for sure because I've never bothered to

If you never visited the new Mini site how do you know what they whine
about? I know you adored the new Mini and you are a closet new Mini lover -
lol.

In any case, I bet we have more issue and whines about our old Minis: rusty
a pillars, synchronizing twin carbs, Lucas electronics, etc

Fascinating. First saw BMW's attempt in mock-up five years ago. Wasn't
terribly impressed. Didn't particularly like the phoney retro styling
cues. Was very disappointed that BMW had rejected the Rover design

One doesn't expect perfect reliability from a classic car - it is,
after all, a 45-year-old design - however, we don't whine about it.
Steel quality and finish has varied over the years, as with all
marques, burt there is little excuse for the later cars rusting
prematurely..... other than demoralisation caused by BMW's appallingly
bad management of the Rover Group. Synchronising carbs has never been
a problem for anyone with half a brain, but very few of us bother to
run twin carbs on a Mini when one large one works just as well, if not
better. Lucas electrics have never been much of a problem and have
been unfairly demonised over the years - mostly by ignorant Americans
who don't understand or maintain their cars.

You really ought to find out a little bit more about your subject

I polish my cars (classic &amp; fat mini) once once a month (give or take).

No hatred. It's just another euro-hatch like there are already dozens on
the market at this time. It is really nothing special, and discussion of
the BMW Mini in this forum is just as relevant as discussion of the Fiat
Punto or the Renault Clio.

This forum is for discussion of the real Mini (not "Classic Mini", which
is the name that BMW used to rebaptize the original). The BMW has
absolutely no part in common with the Mini. The discussion of aircon
options, 17" alloys and chili packs is just as uninteresting to Mini
enthusiasts as discussion of 10" wheels, rust prevention and carb
needles is to BMW (or VW or Ford) owners.

Please take discussion of the New BMW Mini to where it belongs. ie: not
here.

I consider myself an enthusiast and I am interested in these things.

Since I am not a forum Nazi and Man shall not live by bread alone then yes
you can discuss bathroom DIY tips. Perfectly okay with me. However if that
runs you into an hypochondriac episode you might want to filter out
offending post/posters and key names such as OsiTech.Net, MINI, BINI, BMW,
NEW

Just a suggestion.

I'll see you chaps on Sunday off to try me luck in Vegas. If I win I promise
to buy you Guys rounds of beers and a few MINIs to use as shooting target -
lol.

Sorry, but that simply isn't true. This forum was created for
discussion of real Minis. There is an alternative forum for the
discussion of the badge-engineered abomination, which does not compare
favourably with the real thing in any respect. Those of us who
appreciate real Minis already have a life. Those fashion victims and
poseurs who have been conned by the marketers into buying the other
thing thinking it is a Mini are the ones with lifestyle problems.

Hey Mark,

Don't bother, you can't change these people, they're brainwashed and
blinkered. If they wish to remain in their own little social clique, then
let it be so. IMO I haven't seen this level of hatred since the days of the
nazis or the kkk. You can only try so hard to help these people, but when
their hatred for fellow human beings is so deeply rooted I think they are
best left to their own devices.

The only thing Nazi I can see is the new piece BMW piece of ****, BMW is
owned by a German company that used to make engines for a company that
supplied them  to Adolf  Hitler's war machine who's Luftwaffe used to drop
bombs on us, get you facts right :-) original British mini although produced
by a failing company gave British workers jobs, now even BMW does things on
the cheap, the new Nazi cars engine is actually a Chrysler design, produced
in South America in factories that employ child slave labour, the engines
are than shipped to be put in the cars here, Rover was bought by BMW just
for the name Mini , you should get your facts right, no Nazis here, just
patriots,

Hi,

To be honest - I don't really understand why you would do that.  No
bigotry - really.  It's not even that I mind, they do have the same
name, I just don't see why an ng where only, say, half the posts are
likely even to be *relevant* to the car I drive is interesting.  There's
an ng for the new mini - anyone wanting to discuss that I would whole
heartedly recommend go there, in the same way as if I start to invite my
friends to discuss sill replacements, A-Panel rust and syncing dual SUs
I'd suggest they come here.  It's not segregation, it's just going where
you're most likely to find common interest.  It's like thinking
alt.autos.fwd would make a damn fine ng for discussing my car cos it's
front wheel drive.  If that was the case we might as well stick with
alt.autos and all post in there :-)  I think you'll agree it would be
dreadful, irrelevant and I'd probably unsubscribe - not because I mind
that some people like 205s and others like Abarths, just because there's
too much in there I don't care about.  It works both ways - the
problems/questions/fantasies just aren't the same.  There's overlap,
sure, I certainly can understand someone having a wild time in their
lovingly prepared Escort Mexico, it's just not that interesting to me.

I like rock music, and while occasionally I find rock fans in the trendy
nightclubs of my home Paris, I certainly don't think that's the best
place to discuss rock music.  Sure it's all music, modern R&amp;B, blues
and rock 'n' roll all share something in common I don't expect Elvis
tribute bands, blues acts and AC/DC cover bands to wind up in the same
places, even though I like all.

Sorry for the noise - had to get it out of my system :-)

Have fun, drive hard, drive well, get home safely.

Kind regards,

Phil a.k.a SpyderMan

Reminds me of the time many years ago when I was a DJ, I did a gig which was
extensively advertised as A Rock and Roll Disco. Some dimwit turned up and
asked me if I had any soul! Much the same as the dimwits who post about

I wasn't talking about the cars, I was talking about the bigots like you who
think its cool to hate people for what they drive.

Persecution for being different .... ring any bells Adolf ?

"South America in factories that employ child slave labour" .... what do you
have to back that claim up ?

Seriously, I'm intrigued.

PS - When I was at school (aged 14 - 16) my evening job (5pm - 10pm) was
working at Barrats Engineering.

What did I do there - I worked on a press making the rear Mini Chrome
ashtrays for Rover at Cowley (also child labour!!).

Nobody hates anybody here. We are just insulted that BMW called their
fat, ugly car a Mini, which is an insult to one of the greatest pieces
of design ever and THE car of the 20th century. We also feel sorry for
the fashion victims who have been suckered into buying it thinking it
has anything to do with the Mini. These people deserve our sympathy
and understanding.....but that doesn't mean we want to read about
their problems here..

There is little doubt that BMW's prime purpose in acquiring the Rover
Group from its then parent British Aerospace was to get their hands on
Land Rover technology and the Mini brand. They made llittle or no
effort to invest in Rover as a whole and actually restricted the
marketing of those Rover models - in particular the excellent 75 -
which they saw as being in competition with BMW. Effectively, they
cherry-picked what they wanted and ran the company into the ground.
They certainly don't come out of the whole exercise with any credit,
but then not many people do.

Even then, I doubt if anybody here would have minded if they had
produced a worthwhile and innovative successor to the Mini, but they
didn't. Instead of producing a brilliantly packaged small car with a
Tardis-like interior they came up with a fat, conventional hatchback
and then cut it short by the simple expedient of removing the boot
space and rear legroom. Then they tacked on a few naff retro styling
cues and called in a Mini. Can you really not see why that upsets
people?

&gt;&gt;by BMW. That means this forum is acceptable for anyone with any Mini

&gt; Hey Mark,

&gt; Don't bother, you can't change these people, they're brainwashed and
&gt; blinkered. If they wish to remain in their own little social clique, then
&gt; let it be so. IMO I haven't seen this level of hatred since the days of the
&gt; nazis or the kkk. You can only try so hard to help these people, but when
&gt; their hatred for fellow human beings is so deeply rooted I think they are
&gt; best left to their own devices.

I don't hate people. But I do hate ignorant behaviours. Like posting in
the wrong newsgroup.

No, persecution for being too dumb to post in the correct newsgroup.

Have you noticed how persecuted you get when you drive on the wrong side
of the road?

Ahhh....

In that case lets keep it going a little longer.

Surely an Mornington Crescent will overrule a Godwin ?

Pleased for you.  Every time someone comes out with a new car that isn't
quite up to scratch, it does help sales of the previous model that was.

Well - that's IYHO.  I don't like people who cross post, or spam ngs

&gt; Hi,

&gt; To be honest - I don't really understand why you would do that.  No
&gt; bigotry - really.  It's not even that I mind, they do have the same
&gt; name, I just don't see why an ng where only, say, half the posts are
&gt; likely even to be *relevant* to the car I drive is interesting.  There's

&gt; an ng for the new mini - anyone wanting to discuss that I would whole
&gt; heartedly recommend go there, in the same way as if I start to invite my

&gt; friends to discuss sill replacements, A-Panel rust and syncing dual SUs
&gt; I'd suggest they come here.  It's not segregation, it's just going where

&gt; you're most likely to find common interest.  It's like thinking
&gt; alt.autos.fwd would make a damn fine ng for discussing my car cos it's
&gt; front wheel drive.  If that was the case we might as well stick with
&gt; alt.autos and all post in there :-)  I think you'll agree it would be
&gt; dreadful, irrelevant and I'd probably unsubscribe - not because I mind
&gt; that some people like 205s and others like Abarths, just because there's

&gt; too much in there I don't care about.  It works both ways - the
&gt; problems/questions/fantasies just aren't the same.  There's overlap,
&gt; sure, I certainly can understand someone having a wild time in their
&gt; lovingly prepared Escort Mexico, it's just not that interesting to me.

&gt; I like rock music, and while occasionally I find rock fans in the trendy

&gt; nightclubs of my home Paris, I certainly don't think that's the best
&gt; place to discuss rock music.  Sure it's all music, modern R&amp;B, blues
&gt; and rock 'n' roll all share something in common I don't expect Elvis
&gt; tribute bands, blues acts and AC/DC cover bands to wind up in the same
&gt; places, even though I like all.

&gt; Sorry for the noise - had to get it out of my system :-)

&gt; Have fun, drive hard, drive well, get home safely.
