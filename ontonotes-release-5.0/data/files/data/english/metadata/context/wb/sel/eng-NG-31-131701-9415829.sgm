Henry Ford was one of the great pioneers of 20th century American
industry. Ford, more than perhaps any other man, is responsible for
the America of affordable automobiles. He was a great innovator and he
was known for acts of philanthropy. So what did Henry Ford do to
deserve the number eight spot on this list?

It began in 1918, when Henry Ford purchased a small weekly newspaper
called The Dearborn Independent and turned it into a platform for the
political views of himself and his friends. Unfortunately for
everyone, those views centered largely around Jews and how horrible
Jews were and how Jews were Jewing up the Jeworld Jewith their
Jewiness.

From 1920 to 1927 The Dearborn Independent produced dozens of articles
about the menace of Jewry and reprinted pretty much every horrible
screed and forged document relating to the evilness of Jews. Ford
would later deny he had any knowledge of the contents of The Dearborn
Independent, even though he was quoted in respectable (and less
Jew-hating) newspapers as making comments about the infamously fake
evil Jew document Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. It is a
document which, by the way, Ford's presses just happened to print as
part of an anti-Jew anthology of fun entitled The International Jew,
The World's Foremost Problem.

My teacher told me in 1st grade that you can't judge someone based on
the company they keep, but Henry Ford had a particular companion so
horrible it's hard to ignore him. If you've been paying attention to
the content and the dates of the preceding paragraphs you might be
able to guess the name of this companion. Take a second and make a
guess. Got it?

That's right, it was...Hitler.

Ford and Hitler were reportedly great admirers of one another, to the
extent that Ford regularly sent Hitler lavish birthday gifts and
Hitler returned the favor by bestowing the highest honor a foreigner
could receive from Germany for Ford's 75th birthday. Did I mention
that the honor was a medal covered with swastikas?

Hitler admired Ford so much that he mentioned him in Mein Kampf and
hung a picture of him on the wall of his office. Hitler even credited
Ford as his inspiration for the concept of the Volkswagen.

There's keeping bad company and then there's being best friends
forever with the most hated man of the 20th century. I hope my 1st
grade teacher could see the difference, otherwise she might disagree
that Henry Ford deserves the number eight spot on the list.

So what? 90% of the world's population hate Jews! For a very good reason.
BTW, have you ever met a Jewish bricklayer?

an earlier poster said 90 percent of the world hates jews. wrong: the
small, pea-brained minority who hate jews believe that they comprise
90 percent of the world's population. that's a common misperception of
the bigoted -- another is the opposite claim, that &quot;it's just me
against the world.&quot; both are delusional and pathetic. as to henry
ford: who gives a fuck if it's true or not? i'm jewish. my last two
cars have been a ford and a volkswagen, and i can make no connection
between those vehicles and the political leanings of their founders.
(i will say that the ford was a pretty good car and the VW's a goddamn
lemon.) if i had to limit my purchases to items made by companies who
had never employed an anti-semite or some other type of bigot, i'd be
dressed like adam in the garden of eden. what's the point of your
screed impugning henry ford? so we can sit here and seethe about a
dead man? or so that we can revel in the possibility that an american
icon was despicable? not sure what you're getting at, but are you
aware that you posted this on a guitar newsgroup, where are are, as i
write, trying to sort out the identiry of the nuclear warrior -- a
force for peace and human understanding if there ever was one? take
your bullshit back to the donut shop, pin-dick. there's guitars to
discuss.
