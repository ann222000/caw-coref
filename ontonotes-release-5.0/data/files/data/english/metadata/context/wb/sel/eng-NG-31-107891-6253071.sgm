Recently, at a local dance, I was speaking with a woman when a man asked her
to dance.  She said, "No, I don't like this song!," and the man slithered
off.  I said, "You're not going to dance?"  She said, "No, I don't like that
song!"  I said, "Are you going to find him and ask him to dance later?"  She
said, "No, he'll come and ask me again."

Thirty minutes later I was speaking with a well known, talented dancer I
know who was visiting from out of town  He said, "I'm really surprised with
the women around here--three women have turned me down already and the night
is just beginning."

Later in the evening, after he had many enjoyable dances, I asked him if the
other women at the dance had redeemed those with poor manners.  He said,
"They're on my permanent 'Don't dance!' list.

What has happened to the dictum, "It's only three minutes, so dance!"?

Sometimes it seems women are reading a lot more into a request for a
dance than just that.  We're not asking you if you will have our
child.   It's just a dance.  They have no idea how vulnerable most
guys feel when they request a dance.  The only acceptable excuse is
fatigue.  Most guys will be aware of the fact that you have just
finished a quick stop followed by a ch cha followed by a triple swing.
But like you said it would be nice if they sought him out later for a
dance when they have reuperated.  I make it a point during and evening
to ask a few women who aren't getting out on the floor to dance.  On
the other hand most men are quite delighted whenever we are asked.

I will occasionally turn down dances but when I do so, I give a reason
and indicate a willingness to dance with the person later.  Not liking
the song is a perfectly good reason, IMO.  However, I will go to the
effort to seek out the person for a dance later.  I'm not always
successful in finding them before one of us leaves for the night.

People who turn down dance invitations without giving a reason and
indicating their willingness to dance with me later or under different
circumstances go on MY "don't ask" list.  They'll have to ask ME for
any future dance.

I despise the behavior of those who will give phony excuses when they
actually do not want to dance with a particular person.  Just say "No,
thank you."  Most of us know this means.  "Please take this refusal
personally.  I don't want to dance with YOU."

The above remarks are stated in the context of venues where dancers go
to dance with dancers, NOT in the context of a purely public night
club setting.

It sounds like it may have been a normal routine for him and her -- she said
no, he came and asked again later. If that's the case, no harm done. If she
just assumed he would, and he didn't, I guess she's sol. :-)

I don't know the fellow, but that sounds awful close to a bruised ego that
should get itself a thicker skin. So they said "no". Big deal. Get over it.
Allow that they are allowed to say "no" and ask again. This assumes what
hasn't been said, namely that they weren't overtly rude (no, ya big jerk!),
didn't say no to him and then go ask somoene else to dance, etc. It isn't
rude for a woman to simply say "no", so in the absence of any more
information I disagree with your judgement that they had "poor manners".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Never heard of it. Though prior to my daughter's first high school dance
they had a teacher explain to all the girls that it was "rude' to say "no"
to a boy. The boys had fragile egos and might be wounded for life if a girl
didn't want to dance with them. She asked me my opinion and I told her that
any system that requires a young woman to never say no to a young man is an
insult to her nad her peers wasn't going to cause those boys to grow up
respectful or listening to women. I told her to dance with who she wanted
and politely refuse who she didn't want. I think I did the right thing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Me too. I think it's the only way to deal with it. No-one should feel they
have to dance -- I mean it's not like it's a job or a punishment! I don't
agree with any 'rule' that says a person _must_ dnace or that it's rude to
say "no". It's always OK to refuse a dance. That said, offering an
explanation for why and committing to a dance later should suffice for all
but the most easily brusied of egos. I hand't really thought about it but
not liking a song is a fine reason to refuse.

I NEVER say "No!" Many is the time I'd like to but I don't. This
evening I was asked "Do you . . ?" and responded "Very poorly. If you
can't find someone else, I will". When I saw her dancing the number
by herself, I joined her apologizing for my lack of skill. Had she
simply asked me to dance, I would have answered "I will, but I'm not
very good at it. You'd probably be happier with someone else".

When I'm turned down, all I hear is "No!" The words used to say "No!"
are irrelevant. The end result is we don't dance because the asked
said "No!" As you suggest, when the refusal is covered by asking me
later, all's forgiven and forgotten.

My "don't ask" list is numerically based as I don't hear the words
used to say "No!" I do not have a "don't dance" list because I'll
dance with anyone who'll dance with me. Not long ago, one on my
"don't ask" list gave me a big smile that appeared, and proved, to be
an invitation to dance during which we had a very nice conversation.

Well, Ike, I'm not entirely surprised that you don't get what this father
was helping his daughter learn, that her word and wants was as valid as any
males, and that just because an adult told her there was a 'rule' that
required her as a female to accede to the wishes of a male regardless of her
personal desires, she whould (politely) express her own perosnal desires and
require others to respect them. She wasn't there for the benefit of the
young men. She was there to dance with whomever she wanted to -- and thus
not dance with whomever she didn't want to.

My daughter learned that her word and wishes are worthy of respect, that
noble and honourable young men will honour and respect her. Ignoble ones
won't.

Now addressing your trauma that you still haven't got over...
The eyes of the world are not on you. I don't even think you can imagine
that they are. It's like the first job interview or the first communion or
the first time you read something you've written to the class. You either do
it or you don't. And the world goes on. And you learn something. Some learn
that not everything they want to happen will. Finally, you're much older. Me
much matruer and deal with it.

First of all, Larry, I just want to say that it's good to see you out
again even if you're not dancing yet. :^)))

Secondly, the paranoid in me has to wonder if you're talking about me
since we were talking last week at Hacienda, LOL...???

Third, I feel this topic has pretty much been exhausted in RAD in the
past, and yet here it is again... But since you brought it up I thought
I'd play devil's advocate on the subject.

An invitation to dance is NOT, IMO, a sacred right or obligation.

I feel I respect and honor invitations to dance whenever and as often
as possible. If I say no, there is a reason, which I may or may not be
able to communicate. I try to make it up to the asker but if I don't
for whatever reason, or if I can't give them the reason at the time, I
expect them to be adults about it and understand. If they can't, well,
that's too bad and if I'm crossed off of someone's list, that's their
loss.

But honestly, lately I have been questioning the validity of always
saying yes.

There are a few people out there who, for whatever reasons, I really
dislike dancing with, I find it distasteful, plain and simple. Either I
dislike them personally or there is something about them that just
bothers me. And yet, if they ask me, and they do, I say yes and spend
the next 3 minutes trying to make the best of it, wondering why the
he** I said yes and cursing my good nature for accepting. Am I giving
them the best dance possible? Probably not, but why should I want to do
anything that might encourage them to ask me again?  Besides, for
whatever reason, their dancing doesn't inspire partnership, creativity,
give and take, musicality, or anything of the kind. Or worse, there is
something about THEM, an indefinable yuck factor, that comes into play.
IOW, I don't enjoy myself at all and I can't possibly think that they
enjoy the dance, either. And yet they still ask. And according to you,
Ike and others, I'm supposed to dance with them every time they ask.
Really??? Why???

Remember, devil's advocate - that' means going to the extreme, keep
that in mind when you respond. Besides, the above is JMO as of today.
Tomorrow may be different.

I don't think there is any validity to "always" having to say yes.
One persons misery ought not be anothers joy.
There are many reasons why it may be okay to say no to an invitation to
dance. I do think we owe what we do (partner dancing) a good dose of
deference to others and good manners and "no" should be in an extreme
minority, but that doesn't mean that there aren't reasonable and legitimate
situations for denying said invitations.

I agree, Trish, am glad you played devil's advocate. Here is my take on
this:

Personally, I rarely turn down a dance. I am fairly energetic and enjoy
most songs and most dance partners. But if there is someone I really
don't want to dance with (usually because he gets his sweat on me or
yanks my arm out of the socket) I can usually avoid being asked by
busying myself in conversation with someone else or going to the bar to
get a drink or something.  But there is nothing wrong with saying, "No
thank you."  You are not obligated to do anything you are uncomfortable
with.

Between work, household chores, exercise, paying bills, and trying to
maintain family relationships and friendships, not to mention driving
back and forth between work, home and dancing, there are so few
precious minutes left in the day, that why should you repeatedly spend
time dancing with someone whose company you know you don't enjoy? If we
compared dance invitations to sales pitches for products we often don't
want or can't afford, I don't think people would say that you are
obligated to buy every product that someone is trying to sell you.
(Yes, I work in marketing.)

When I am turned down for a dance (which definitely happens to women as
well, contrary to what some of the male posters here have hinted at), I
assume that either the man was tired (I have several friends with
injuries or diseases that require them to rest between dances), does
not enjoy the song, is afraid to dance with a tall woman, wants to
catch up with his friends in attendance, was hoping to dance with a
superior dancer (sometimes that superior dancer is you, Trish), or is
intimidated because he perceives my level of dancing to be above his. I
even have some male friends who have quite honestly admitted that they
are trying to save more of their dancing time for the single women in
attendance with the hopes of meeting someone to date (in other words,
"if I know you have a husband or boyfriend, you aren't high on my
list").

If the same person turns me down more than once and never asks me for a
dance, I do get the point, and I don't ask again, figuring that the
answer will be the same. If I am turned down by several men at the same
dance, I try to determine if there is anything I am doing (unhappy
facial expression, unwelcoming body language, inappropriate clothing,
excessive sweat, etc.) that may be dissuading them.  Sometimes, I make
a mental note that I need to work on particular aspects of my dancing
to improve my dance desirability. And at some dances, I decide it is
not worth my effort to attend again if it is obvious that the people
there tend to dance primarily with the people in their own social or
competitive circle.

I guess my point is that no one is owed anything in life or in dancing.
It is all a rather intricate social game. People have all different
reasons for dancing and different qualities they are looking for in a
dance. If someone can't take the heat, they should get out of the
kitchen! If a man is wondering why he gets turned down or is not being
invited to dance, he can go through an analysis of what kind of
image/energy he is giving off, and the various possibilities about why
the lady doesn't want to dance.  To always assume it is because she is
rude, is just...well, rude.

Oh, but I hardly believe that someone should always accept a dance
invitation.  In the cases you mentioned, for example, why isn't it
appropriate to say, "No thank you!"?  In contrast, I mentioned that a
visitor, who happened to be well groomed, polite, and an excellent dancer,
was turned down by three different women in a short time period at the
beginning of a dance, which is a quite different circumstance.  I believed
they were rude because they likely had no basis for judging him as you had
judged the men you had previous experience with, and they gave no indication
as to why they turned him down or that they would look for him later.

Why waste even 3 minutes?  Unless one has either volunteered,
or is employed as a dance host/hostess at the local dance, there
is little reason to dance any dance unless one wants to dance.
This "dictum" actually drives some dancers away from attending
dances, or to leave early, because they feel obligated if they're
present.

There are times when I would rather sit and talk, or watch
the dancing, or rest my knee, or enjoy my drink, or wait for
decent music or the floor to be less crowded, or only dance
with a few people to whom I owe some dances, etc.  And there
are nights when I'd prefer to dance every and any dance with
anybody, beginners included. One should not assume the latter
is always the case for everybody present.  I don't.

Then there is the definition of "dance" itself.  At some
places, it's obvious that over 50% of the people can dance
pretty well, so the odds, given a random request, are good.
In other settings, someone might well have the opinion that,
on average, most of the unknown people can't dance (given some
narrow definition of "dance") so many do not accept a random
requester until after they've seen them prove themselves out
on the dance floor with some other partner.  In some Argentine
Tango settings, asking someone to dance before they've seen
you and make willing eye contact is considered an indication
of cluelessness or worse.

IMHO. YMMV.

If you don't want to dance with someone, or to some music, it's much
better to be honest about that than to pretend you are enjoying
yourself.  There's quite a fair chance the other person will figure out

And that reminds me of another habit, more, rule,dictum, whatever. That of
interrupting a conversation -- especially one that is clearly private and
earnest -- to ask one of the people to dance. It usually comes iwth a "I
have a divine right to ask" attitude and sometimes -- I think in
anticipation of the obvious -- "I'ts not rude. We're all here to dance."
Well, you know what, people come to dances for other reasons. Some come to
socialise and spend valuable and needed time with friends, to talk about the
difficulty they are having with chemo, or to catch up on a shared joy. I
think it is totally rude to interrupt all but an obviously casual
conversation by asking someone to dance.

The general rule when dancing is if it is a friend that I have danced
with her many times I'll take it as a legitimate excuse and ask her
later again.

If on the other hand I have never asked the lady before and it's the
first time she goes on my permanent no dance list. I mean permanent this
means I will NEVER ask her again. I have talked to other male dancers
about this and they agree.

What surprises me is that on more than one occasion some ladies have
come back to me and asked me why I did not ask them again.

Also to the ladies. I do not choose a lady to dance randomly, if you
refuse to dance with me I will tell my friends (the good dancers at the
social gathering). The chances are that you will not be asked again. I
have seen many ladies not dancing once at a social gathering getting
more upset as the evening goes on simply because their refused the first
man that asks them to dance.

Refusing a man asking you to dance is very delicate matter. It involves
very good social skills. If you refuse for a good reason being not
wanting to dance is fine but then you must act appropriately. If you
refuse to dance with me and say yes to another person a minute later
that is a indication that you do not wish to dance with me and I will
ignore you for the rest of the evening.

Again remember refusing a man that asks you to dance influences your
enjoyment of the evening and have a larger impact as just one dance that
you are sitting out. It influences every single dance that I would have
asked you to dance, I will think twice if I would like you to dance again.

I must be offended if I have asked you the first time and the second
time you say no. This is fine chances are that you did not like dancing
with me and would not like to continue dancing with me all is fair.

But refusing the first time is BAD. BAD manner, BAD form and will kill
your evening.

I have had incident where I have asked a lady to dance and she would not
simply because she was embarrassed and felt she could not keep up. This
is not a legitimate excuse. I can and do dance most social dances
considerably under my best. So I should be able to dance with you.

I think this is "it" for me relating to this post.  I try never to say
no to someone who asks me to dance that I have never seen before or
never danced with before.  If I am so tired I cannot dance, I say "not
this one but if you will wait for me to catch my breath (get a drink of
water or whatever I am sitting it out to accomplish), let's do the next
one".  I put a definite time for the dance, not trust I can actually
find the person later.  I so remember, and still experience, going to
new places and not so new places and not dancing very much because
either I am not known at the place I have gone to or am not "one of the
sweet young things that might say yes to a date later".

That said, for everyone else, I see no reason to say yes if I mean no.
For whatever reason.  There are a few guys I refuse to dance with as
they either have hurt me before with overly rough leads, or engage in
inappropriate holding/groping/whatever you might wish to call it.  And
other times when I just wish to sit one out.  If I have danced with
someone before in this instance, I figure they will likely ask again
(and I will try to remember not to say no a second time).

I routinely ask guys to dance, and sometimes they say yes and sometimes
no and I just move on to the next person.    If someone does refuse me
more than once though, I probably won't ask them again.  I don't worry
too much about it.  There are usually plenty of others to ask.

Everyone has the right to say no.

IMO the practice of courtesy carries an implication that one desires
to minimize the risk of giving offense. the reality is that nowadays,
some people just don't care if they give offense. one has always been
free to act as courteously or discourteously as they wish. it's
usually been the threat of being penalized in some way that motivates
courteous behavior in certain circumstances.

how this seems to play out is  that the consequences of discourteous
behavior are inversely proportional to one's popularity and their
standing in relation in the society involved; in the dance world, the
more sought after one is as a partner (for whatever reason) the
greater the likekihood that boorish behavior on their part will not
affect how they are pursued for dances. and sometimes it's just not
fair.

to those who believe in turning the other cheek, that is, continuing
to act courteously towards the offender,that's fine, but the bible
never says to do it more than once (thank you sir! may i have
another?);  i personally wouldn't fault anyone for choosing to protect
themselves from being subjected to offensive  behavior or discomfort
on a continual basis. if someone's been rude to you or caused you
discomfort, why go back for more? if they're offended - they'll stop
asking you to dance - which is what you'd prefer anyway.

and there are folks i prefer not to dance with - it sometimes requires
some deft maneuvering to avoid eye contact without appearing to do so
deliberately while frantically trying to locate someone nearby to ask
to dance before they can reach you. and there are some songs i prefer
to sit out - but in those cases i always respond by suggesting
something like "how about the next ______ instead? please come remind
me if i forget."

There are always valid reasons to turn down an individual. I have

as they ought. One in this forum recently said here that she doesn't
want to dance with me yet I cannot remember her having ever refused

&gt; give and take, musicality, or anything of the kind. Or worse,
&gt; there is something about THEM, an indefinable yuck factor, that
&gt; comes into play. IOW, I don't enjoy myself at all and I can't
&gt; possibly think that they enjoy the dance, either. And yet they

&gt; they ask. Really??? Why???

To dance "a minute later" or to the same number? Big difference. For
me, accepting a dance with another to the same number, that's "don't
ask". A minute later to a different number? I probably don't notice.

This is ridiculous! If you issue a permant, lifetime, "ban" on being asked
because of a a "no, thank you" where there is no rudeness -- well, except
for the "any no is a rude one" of the terminally fragile ego -- you are
being a Prima Donna, a spoiled brat, a jerk, and demonstrating _your_
rudness. I find it hard to believe that you're an adult.

I can only presume that you think yourself a good dancer. But being a dancer
is much more htan steps and patterns. It's also social skills and grace. And

i agree that no one should feel obiligated to submit to a situation
that causes discomfort - but where does one draw the line that defines
discomfort? actual pain? potential humiliation for being seen with
someone socially undesirable? B.O.? the fact that the other person
can't keep a steady beat to save their lives?

in my perspective, an invitation and acceptance to dance has always
carried an implicit agreement that each person will be the best
partner possible for the other.* if* each person has that mindset,
then they shouldn't be offended should the other person offer
feedback, before, during or after the dance such as
- btw, i have a sore _______, i'd prefer to avoid ________ ;
- you know, it feels uncomfortable for me when you _____________;

if they heed your input, fine - if anything, they're probably grateful
to you for being willing to point that out. if they choose to be
offended, that implies to me that their concern for my welfare is
sufficiently low that i would free to refuse subsequent overtures
until that person demonstrated some sort of change of heart.

i see no conflict - as long as both people are trying to be good
partners &amp; trying to avoid giving offense (which IMO includes
discomort while dancing), the "traditional" rules of etiquette apply.
when one  person demonstrates a different perspective, then a
different set of rules apply which can (and probably should) include a
formal statement of:

"you know, not only is it not fun to dance (or whatever) with you, i
actually have found it to be unpleasant. as long as you continue to
_____________(and you probably need to be specific and explicit as to
what actually causes the discomfort), i prefer not to dance with you."

if that offends them - what have you lost? someone you'd prefer not to
dance with now longer dances with you. and if enough people were that
direct, they would *hopefully* be motivated to change.

but i do acknowledge that factors off the floor can influence the
choices one has on the floor. as i said before, sometimes, it's just
not fair.

"political correctness" and the Golden Rule are pretty
much orthogonal.  U.S. States which are regarded as less
"politically correct" sometimes rank higher in charitable giving
statistics.  And, though correlation is not causation, it does
seem as if general interest in partner dancing is somewhat
inversely related to societies "PC" index over the past half
century or so.  If anything, the social dance population is
more diverse, so any expected social obligations to dance
are unlikely to be uniform behaviors.  Deal with it.

IMHO. YMMV.

<POSTDATE> 2006-10-24T18:33:00 </POSTDATE>
At our local dance venue, OCWCSDC at Top Cats where I am a regular and
the Club is family, I try never to refuse a WCS dance when asked by
anyone, be they newbie to the dance or first-time at the
Club.......except there is one leader I try to physically avoid so that
I won't have to dance with him.

At an event, it can be different.........at a recent out-of-town event,
for my own safety and well-being and after a few dangerous dances, I
made a decision not to accept invitations from leaders I did not know
or had never seen before until I had a chance to watch them on the
floor.....sometimes I said "No, thank you, I am resting" and if he
seemed particularly shy, courteous, or vulnerable, I would add, "but
please ask me again."

Having said that, three leaders over the long weekend refused when I
asked them to dance:

First:  Dancer was a local from my Club.......he was sitting behind me
munching a cookie/snack when I asked him. We have always had nice
dances together. He indicated he wanted to finish his
cookie/snack.......next song he was out on the floor dancing, but not
with me. He does this often, and I only ask him latenight when there
are too few good leaders out there.

Second:  Dancer was from another country with whom I have had several
pleasant dances over the years -- he was sitting behind me resting his
leg on a chair. It was latenight, and I asked him to dance........ he
was worried about his knee because it was in a brace and bothering
him..........next song he was on the floor dancing with a young lady
from his own country. I thought his refusal could have been because he
was not comfortable dancing with me when he could not do his best, but
when dancing with a friend from his home city, he did not have to be
concerned. However, for a while I will be reluctant to ask him to
dance.

Third: Dancer was from another country further away........he was part
of a delightful group sitting near me, and most of them had already
asked me to dance. Wishing not to exclude him and to be hospitable, I
asked him to dance......he said he needed a "toilet break" and would be
right back to have the dance. He returned quickly to dance to the next
song, but not with me. When he showed up at our Club following weekend,
the heck with hospitality.....I did not bother with him.

All three men returned to the floor, right in front of where I was
sitting, to dance with followers who just happned to be young, pretty
AND good dancers.......and that's the way it is sometimes. Who can
blame them.........my leaders are all men who are younger :),
attractive AND good dancers, too :). I don't feel the refusals were
because I am not a good dancer or that they don't like me.........it's
just all part of life.

The men did not come back to me to reclaim the dance.......I don't do
that often either when I refuse.

My hurt feelings from refusals are my problem to deal with; and if I so
desire,  I have the power to control the situation by asking or not
asking again, whatever works.

That said, the "No's" are not easy to give or to receive.......but they
can contribute to one's growth..........particularly if that "one" is
not used to being refused anything :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; IMO the practice of courtesy carries an implication that one desires
&gt;&gt;&gt; to minimize the risk of giving offense. the reality is that nowadays,
&gt;&gt;&gt; some people just don't care if they give offense.

&gt;&gt;To be fair, there are some -- and there are some in this thread -- who
&gt;&gt;just
&gt;&gt;don't care if they take offence. In fact, they seem to seek out
&gt;&gt;offences.IMHO it's often about power and control. The offence-taker (where
&gt;&gt;none is actually given) seeks victimhood and control. I think this &quot;she
&gt;&gt;cannot say 'no' to me without social censure&quot; is about control and
&gt;&gt;conformity. Think about it. In what other world is there a &quot;rule&quot; that
&gt;&gt;requires a woman to not say &quot;no&quot; to a man or suffer negative consequences?

&gt; i agree that no one should feel obiligated to submit to a situation
&gt; that causes discomfort - but where does one draw the line that defines
&gt; discomfort?

The recipient of the potential discomfort can draw the line. Who else is in
a position to know?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; actual pain? potential humiliation for being seen with

All of the above and "I don't want to dance right now".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Isn't it better to have a &quot;rule&quot; that says, &quot;You're an adult. Please

But the problem is that some insist that those "traditional rules of
etiquette" require a woman to assent to a man's request for a dance. If she
fails to do so -- and without hesitation for some -- she is the one being
"rude". that's nonsense and sexist.

Here's a close as possible a conversation:
"Hi. Would you like to dance?"
"No, Not right now."
"Do you mind if I asked you later?"
"No. that'd be fine. Thank you."
)The lady was flustered (I hadn't noticed)  and felt a bit embarrassed
because she had broken something or torn something or done something to some
item of her clothing. Once she solved the problem, she was fine and happy to
dance.)

Some have clearly stated that the second response is unnecessary. Her
initial response brands the woman as "rude" and deserving only their
contempt and scorn. Well, in my "rule book" they are "rude".

My reply wasn't to Barry as such. More of a conversation. And it is a sexist
issue because the vast majority of times this issue is discussed it's about
a "rule" that requires women to say "yes" to a man and not vice versa. So
far the issue has been about "women who say "no" and are considered rude for
doing so" so I see no reason to not just say "women" and be done with it.
Unless any women want to complain about men who say "no" and are thus
considered rude. Anyone?

I recounted an actual event that's probably happened zillions of
times. Perhaps you're the physical ideal for fifteen year old girls
who would be thrilled were you to ask them to dance. Such people have
perhaps not had the experience related. Not everyone fits that
description, though, and have had that experience; you know, the guy
with big ears or nose; the one who's too short or too fat; the one
whose clothes don't quite fit; the one who fifteen year old girls
reject for countless reasons fifteen year old boys cannot fathom.

Those beautiful boys in the eyes of those young girls, had they a bit
of empathy, might understand that not everyone is regarded with the
same favor as they. They, too, might not ever say "No!" to an
invitation to dance.

I believe each of us is. I believe that we have a duty, for lack of a

gets to dance at the dance they've gone to to dance. That means
noticing if some people are sitting too (however you might interpret
that) long and asking those people to dance.

No, I don't think you should ask all of them on one evening nor do I
think you should ask only them on any evening. I've always made it a
point to ask the obviously venue-minorities, i.e., exceptional
persons such as the very tall/short/fat/thin/old/young/beautiful/ugly
or people apparently of races or ancestries uncommon at the venue.

The first time I ever did so was the first time I noticed that
gorgeous girls have the same problem as ugly ones: they don't get
asked to dance (well, not when they're fifteen). I remember well
crossing the gymnasium floor to ask a very pretty girl who hadn't
danced for quite a while. She turned me down in an unnecessarily
cruel way that aroused pity in me. It's always been my hope that she
immediately realized how hurtful her words could have been and never
repeated the act that, fortunately for me, only shocked but did not hurt.

NO “NO!”
Or: Never Say “No!” a.k.a. The 'Vegas Story
Lightly edited from the November 22, 1994 original

Crossing Boulder Dam, recorded Big Band music was on the radio. The
announcer claimed that people were dancing at the Las Vegas
restaurant from which the broadcast emanated. When he gave the
address (Hey! I know where that is!) and announced the cheap dinner
special, there we went!
I had correctly speculated that the allegation of dancing was a
lie because the music wasn't suitable. Too bad because the floor was
large and looked very good.
After ordering, I asked the waiter “Who's the best dancer here?”
He pointed to a li'l ol' lady who turned me down.
After a while, a gorgeous woman came in. ‘AhHa!’, said I to me,
‘there's a dancer!’ I went to her escort to ask his permission to ask
her to dance. In my peripheral vision, I could see her vigorously
shaking her head and mouthing “No!” so he abided by her wish. Didn't
dance on that floor at all although I later heard that it's excellent.

Cuppla hours later, walked into a bar to ask the bouncer “Is this the
place?” He assured me it was. “Well,” said I, “do you mind if I
confirm that before paying the cover?” “Not at all.”
The downbeat was at Nine sharp. Indeed, it was the place! The
music and dancing were terrific!
After a bit of listening and watching, I sought a partner. I can't
tell you how many turned me down but almost enough to discourage me
into considering leaving in tears of anger and frustration before a
lovely, kind, pity-taking woman accepted my proffer'd hand. Many
curious eyes followed us to the floor with an absent-minded
“WhoHe/WhatDo?” glaze. When they saw . . . well, I wasn't turned down
again.

From that bar, we went as a group to another where 'Vegas-favorite
Jay Orlando was playing. Around one o'clock, the head-shaking woman
from the restaurant appeared. I caught the initial shock and surprise
on her face when she saw me. She watched me intently giving the
distinct impression that she wanted to dance with me. But I gave her
a look that, I hope, said, “[Go copulate with yourself, Female Dawg!]
Y'wanna dance with me you can crawl across the floor t'beg!” She
didn't. We didn't. A mutual loss.

I thought this thread was actually about the "never say no" dictum that
applies to both women and men. The posters here are mostly men so it may
appear sexist to you, but that old dictum applies to everyone.
I'm not saying I completely agree with it but it's been around since I
started dancing.

I always try to make sure I ask new ladies to dance and take the opportunity
to introduce myself and tell them about the dance opportunities in the area.
After the dance I introduce them to friends inthe hope that they'll form new
friendships and find themselves more comfortable the next time they return.
I also mentally note the locaitonof those ladies who rarely or never get a
dance and ask them at some point in the evening. I think it's polite and
'right' to do so. But that's a separate issue from regarding women who say
"no" as rude.

&gt;&gt; My reply wasn't to Barry as such. More of a conversation. And it is a
&gt;&gt; sexist issue because the vast majority of times this issue is discussed
&gt;&gt; it's about a &quot;rule&quot; that requires women to say &quot;yes&quot; to a man and not
&gt;&gt; vice versa. So far the issue has been about &quot;women who say &quot;no&quot; and are
&gt;&gt; considered rude for doing so&quot; so I see no reason to not just say &quot;women&quot;
&gt;&gt; and be done with it. Unless any women want to complain about men who say
&gt;&gt; &quot;no&quot; and are thus considered rude. Anyone?
&gt; I thought this thread was actually about the &quot;never say no&quot; dictum that
&gt; applies to both women and men.

Well, I suppose it's considered a "gender-neutral" rule, but whenever I hear
it discussed it's always in the context of men complaining that women don't
say "yes" whenever they ask. So it seems to me that the actual experience is
not gender-neutral. I would like to hear any women who can offer their
perspective and experiences on men who say "no". Do you consider them rude
automatically? To you keep a mental numerical list of their infractions? Do
you get all wounded and huffy regardless of why they said "no"? Please, do
tell.

There's an old thread here where a woman I turned down, posted a
question to RAD to see what people thought of my reason.

For the record, she came to me at a crowded convention well into a
song, just a few minutes before a major Jack and Jill final in which I
was not competing.  Because of the circumstances, I indicated I would
rather not take up space on such a crowded floor, when my friends were
trying to find room to warm up for a competition.  I don't expect but
really appreciate such consideration.  I compete better when I've had
time to prepare my mind AND body.

Actually, I really dislike being asked to dance in the middle of a
song, at such a convention, when I'm likely to have to run a gauntlet
of many other couples in order to find a space to squeeze in.  Often
I'll suggest we dance the next one instead but this was a specific
circumstance.

The point is that it's been discussed before.  You're probably seeing
it as a male problem because regardless of what is "fine" men still do
most of the asking, so statistically it would be men who are
experiencing most of the turn downs.

&gt; But honestly, lately I have been questioning the validity of always

&gt; There are a few people out there who, for whatever reasons, I really

&gt; dislike them personally or there is something about them that just
&gt; bothers me. And yet, if they ask me, and they do, I say yes and spend
&gt; the next 3 minutes trying to make the best of it, wondering why the

&gt; them the best dance possible? Probably not, but why should I want to do
&gt; anything that might encourage them to ask me again?  Besides, for
&gt; whatever reason, their dancing doesn't inspire partnership, creativity,
&gt; give and take, musicality, or anything of the kind. Or worse, there is
&gt; something about THEM, an indefinable yuck factor, that comes into play.
&gt; IOW, I don't enjoy myself at all and I can't possibly think that they
&gt; enjoy the dance, either. And yet they still ask. And according to you,
&gt; Ike and others, I'm supposed to dance with them every time they ask.
&gt; Really??? Why???

&gt; Remember, devil's advocate - that' means going to the extreme, keep
&gt; that in mind when you respond. Besides, the above is JMO as of today.
&gt; Tomorrow may be different.

Perhaps they should run some dances, or have some dance system,
that offers dancers feedback.  Like the "How am I Driving" 800 numbers
one can use to leave (anonymous) evaluations of truck or other
professional drivers.  Each dancer is given and wears an ID number as
in a comp and anybody is allowed to fill out a (anonymous) feedback
form for that dancer.  The form might have check-off ratings for
technique, spontaneity, timing, gentleness of connection, sociability,
pleasantness, BO, yuck factor, pervert factor, etc., to clue dancers in
on what they can work on.  Or it may even say "you're hot and I'd like
to go out with you."

Social decorum makes it easy to compliment but a sin to critique,
so some other channel of commenting (other than instructors making
general comments in classes) may be ultimately beneficial for all.
Of course, this doesn't overcome that indescribable yuck factor.

And the organizer must be diligent in getting the suggestion forms
to the associated dancer (presumably without peeking).

That attempt at marginalizing won't hold water. We were talking about a

Hi Peter,

Miki and I (both women) have already shared some of our experiences in
this thread. But since you missed those, here is my perspective.

I don't think it is really any different for women than for men.  We
ask people to dance.  Some of them say yes.  A few say no.  Sometimes
it is for a good reason (tired, injured, tempo too fast, etc.)
Sometimes it is not for such a good reason, but these reasons are never
stated out loud (I think I am a better dancer than you, that other
woman has larger breasts, you are not in the in-crowd around here).
Sometimes a good reason is given but it is a lie (I'd rather they be
honest, especially when they promise the next dance without intending
to dance it with me, usually causing me to miss out on the opportunity
to dance with someone else).

Sometimes it sucks to be turned down, especially if it happens several
times in the same evening.  I always evaluate myself to see if there
are things I can do to have a better acceptance rate.  But ultimately,
life is messy. I am not willing to do some of the things that could put
me into the "in-crowd" in some dance scenes, so I accept the
consequences,or choose which dances I go to more carefully.

I can't make others behave how I would like them to.  All I can control
is my own attitude. I feel good about myself as long as I live up to my
own standards.  That includes trying my best during every dance,
smiling and thanking my partners, being kind to those who are kind to
me and being polite to those who are not nice to me, showering and
brushing my teeth before going out, etc. That also includes
appreciating nearly every partner for something, whether it be his
dancing, his looks, his jokes, his conversational skills, his manners,
or just the fact that he wants to dance with me.

Dancing is just like everything else in life.  Sometimes things go my
way, sometimes they don't.  People create cliques and societal rules.
I like some people.  I don't like others.  Some like me, some don't.
There are some that I like, but don't agree with. (Wouldn't life be
boring if we all agreed all the time?)

We love dancing, so it is worth doing even if it is hard to have a
thick skin on some nights.  Because the next night might be magical and
inspiring.

Christine Elowitt

P.S. Yes, Peter, sometimes I do keep a mental list of infractions.  I
was blessed (as well as cursed) with an excellent memory and a keen eye
for detail.  It is almost impossible for me not to remember who I
danced with and who turned me down how many times, and who they danced
with immediately afterward, as well as who sees me frequently but never
asks me to dance. I also remember lots of other things that most people
don't, like a playground I went to when I was under two-years-old, my
ex-boyfriend's phone number, how many school buses I passed on the way
to work, etc.  And yes, sometimes it hurts my feelings to get turned
down, and I am grateful when someone (like Ike) notices that and asks
me to dance. I am only human, after all!

It's interesting that one is expected to give a reason only
when turning down a dance.  Wouldn't it be interesting if
we were expected to give the honest reasons for accepting
an invitation to dance?  Here are some potential ones:

- Yes, my dance teacher told me I had to accept.

dance partners who expect me to meet this obligation.
- Yes, you're less creepy than the person who was chatting
me up, thanks for rescuing me. ***
- Yes, but I'll bite your head off for interrupting me just
as I was about to get somebody's phone number (glare)!
- Yes; with you it might not be dancing, but I need more
exercise.
- Yes (pant, pant...), but why didn't you let me get to the
water fountain where I was obviously heading?
- Yes, I need a dance dummy so that I can practice this new
step pattern, syncopation, arm styling, or whatever on.
- Yes, but I'd rather that that person over there would have
asked instead. Can we dance over there so I'll be seen?
- Yes, I like the song, and you're better than sitting it out.
- Yes, I don't want to dance to this song, but I owe you
one and this may be our only chance.  ***
- Yes, we haven't danced yet and I like to dance with a
variety of partners.
- Yes, you're new and I like to make people feel accepted.
- Yes, but you're too good.  I hope I don't dance too badly
for you or step on your toes.  ***
- Yes, I don't care about the dancing, but I would like to
spend 3 minutes looking into your dreamy [color] eyes.
- Whoa baby, 3 minutes near your body!  I hope I remember
to move my feet.
- Yes, I'm looking forward to a enjoyable dance with you.
- Yes, and why didn't you ask me sooner? !  ***

Others?

Bravo, well said!

I have had and still get my share of refusals and I dish my share out

Christine, your little friends are wrong. They have been
affected by the skepticism of a sceptical age. They do
not believe except what they see. They think that
nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their
little minds. All minds, Christine, whether they be
men's or children's, are little. In this great universe
of ours, man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect
as compared with the boundless world about him, as
measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the
whole of truth and knowledge.

Yes, Christine, there is a Dancing Clause.

It exists as certainly as love and generosity and
devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give
to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how
dreary would be the world if there were no Dancing
Clause!  It would be as dreary as if there were no
Christines. There would be no childlike faith then, no
poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We
should have no enjoyment, except in sense and
sight. The external light with which childhood fills
the world would be extinguished.

&gt; Hi Peter,

&gt; Miki and I (both women) have already shared some of our experiences in

">

Thank you for your persepctive, Christine. You seem to be a normal peosn who
deals with the normal give and take of human relaitonships properly, with a
sense of your own self and not self-importance. :-)

For the record, I've been told "no" with and without explanation, with
dishonest explanations, and with honest explanations. I have found that
maybe dancing in non-sudio clubs and bars makes for thicker skin. At my
favourite bar, it was only after a time that I could ask certain ladies to
dance and reasonably anticipate a "yes". First you had to establish yourself
as a safe person, and then as a good dancer. You also have to be very sure
give the right signals in a bar -- otheewsir you cna find yourself in aheap
of trouble! I suppose because there is no "rule" enforcing compliance
regardless of your signal. I remember one night dancing with these three
friends, very pretty ladies, and a young man I knew (an excellent dancer)
asked me how come they danced with me. I said, "Maybe it's because when I
ask them to dance they know that's all I'm asking them to do." :-) He was a
good sport, and knew what I meant. He changed his signals and approach and
now -- years later -- I see that he rarely sits. He is considered a
"gentleman" and a good dancer. I'd like to think that my firendly suggesiton
helped him earn that reputation.

My concern is not with those who object to a woman saying "no", only with
those who judge such a woman as "rude" or insist that there should be social
censure because they did so.

&gt;&gt; Hi Peter,

&gt;&gt; Miki and I (both women) have already shared some of our experiences in
&gt;&gt; this thread. But since you missed those, here is my perspective.

&gt;Thank you for your persepctive, Christine. You seem to be a normal peosn who
&gt;deals with the normal give and take of human relaitonships properly, with a
&gt;sense of your own self and not self-importance. :-)

&gt;For the record, I've been told &quot;no&quot; with and without explanation, with
&gt;dishonest explanations, and with honest explanations. I have found that
&gt;maybe dancing in non-sudio clubs and bars makes for thicker skin. At my
&gt;favourite bar, it was only after a time that I could ask certain ladies to
&gt;dance and reasonably anticipate a &quot;yes&quot;. First you had to establish yourself
&gt;as a safe person, and then as a good dancer. You also have to be very sure
&gt;give the right signals in a bar -- otheewsir you cna find yourself in aheap
&gt;of trouble! I suppose because there is no &quot;rule&quot; enforcing compliance
&gt;regardless of your signal. I remember one night dancing with these three
&gt;friends, very pretty ladies, and a young man I knew (an excellent dancer)
&gt;asked me how come they danced with me. I said, &quot;Maybe it's because when I
&gt;ask them to dance they know that's all I'm asking them to do.&quot; :-) He was a
&gt;good sport, and knew what I meant. He changed his signals and approach and
&gt;now -- years later -- I see that he rarely sits. He is considered a
&gt;&quot;gentleman&quot; and a good dancer. I'd like to think that my firendly suggesiton
&gt;helped him earn that reputation.

It's been years since I've danced regularly in a public bar, unless a
specific "dance" community of which I was a part, constituted the vast
majority of patrons for a specific night.  However, I did start in the
hay day of C/W dancing in the early 90's.  I would spend 5 or 6 nights
a week at the local Honky Tonk.  On one occasion, about a year after I
started dancing regularly, I came back to my table after a couple
dances and making the rounds visiting some friends.  Seated at my
table were 6 female dance friends, two pairs of women and two who came
without their usual sidekicks.  They had been talking while I was gone
and said they had a question for me.

The question was something along the order of "Why do you have so many
women friends sitting with you?"  I answered simply, "Because I don't
hit on them."  They all knew this to be true, so they understood
completely.  It's not that I wasn't getting my share of romance, it's
just that I made many dance friends.  I kept the romance separate. One
New Years Eve at that establishment, there were six women at the table
having breakfast with me an other friends.  At one time or another I
had met (at the same honky tonk) and dated three of those women.
There were three others in the establishment that night I had also
dated.

Dance friends are dance friends.  Romance is romance.  For some years,
I traveled a lot on business, so I would find out the local
establishment frequented by the "dancers" and show up.  I quickly
learned how to take time to scope out the people and territory so that
as a stranger, I could mix in and dance without being turned down.  I
miss that.  Heck, I just miss dancing.  I haven't done any since
Easter.
