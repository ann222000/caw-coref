Wood on Mountjoys and Strat Man
</HEADLINE>

I finally located the page where Wood restates the observation of
Munschmann-Wentersdorf on the issue of the Mountjoy's exemption from Anglican
services with the implication that his exemption might explain how someone like
the Strat man who came from a family with a strong inclination towards
Catholicism might have benefitted from this exemption as their boarder. The
page is 271. If he was a good Anglican and his living with them was just a
coincidence, we should see some trail of evidence in the London context of
association with a parish there but instead nothing, nothing like Condell or
Hemmings or almost all the others in the LCM and King's Men.

Very very strange for a man of that stature and fame if the Strat man was
the royal court dramatist from the mid-1590s to perhaps 1610-1614. It does not
add up like so much else with this fellow unless he was a prosperous and clever
secret Catholic living a double life and having some fun at that. For
Oxfordians, the idea that he as a secret Catholic was some front man or play
broker or physical surrogate for Oxford is a joke...especially the broker part
when the LCM/KM already had a lock on the Bard's dramas from 1594 onward.

Well, it really doesn't matter much WHAT Oxfordians think
now that Wood's has rejuvenated the Stratford movement
and made it palatable once more.

P.S. Probably about 1/3 of Oxfordians believe that Oxford was Catholic.

Why don't they read history? Oxford became catholic and then renounced it.
1/3 of Oxfordians make some degree of sense. What a statistic! Why aren't

Shakespeare was also the only one of the troupe/s living apart from his
family, and as the world knows he remained loyal to his own
home parish Holy Trinity in Stratford HOWEVER Marchette
Chute says in &quot;Shakespeare of London&quot; that when he first
joined Lord Chamberlain's Men, he lived in St. Helen's parish
on the east side of town. It extended the length of Bishopsgate
Street, the great thoroughfare which ran under different names
from London Bridge to Shoreditch with three different inns
that were used as theatres....
&quot;A parish church like the one in
Southwark had a system of passing out metal tokens to each
member of the parish, which he had to deliver up to the
communion table on Sunday or face severe consequences;
for if any adult male taxpayer did not go to church regularly,
his politics were immediately suspect. All collection of taxes
was handled through the unit of the parish, and Shakespeare
went on the lists of St. Helen's for the subsidy that had been
voted by Parliament in 1593. There were seventy-three
taxable residents in his parish when the second assessment
was made in 1596, and the value of Shakespeare's goods
was rated at five pounds. This does not sound like much for
a successful actor, but the most prosperous resident in St. Helen's
was given an .evaluation of only three hundred pounds, and in
St. Leonard's parish both Richard and Cuthbert Burbage were
rated as having fewer possessions than Shakespeare. It was the
policy of the government to keep the property evaluation low
but the tax rate high, and when another subsidy was voted
by Parliament in 1597 Shakespeare was taxed thirteen shillings
and fourpence on his goods, a rate of about thirteen per cent.
The two tax collectors in Shakespeare's ward were a skinner
named Thomas Symons and a draper who bore the delightful
name of Ferdinando Clutterbook. Their problem was not an
easy one in a shifting population like London's, and about a
fifth of the tax collections in St. Helen's could not be made.
Shakespeare already owed five shillings on the last installment
of the previous subsidy because he was among those who were
either dead or &quot;departed and gone out of the said ward,&quot; and
the petty collectors of Bishopsgate ward naturally discovered
they could not collect the new tax from him either. ... By 1599
it was decided that Shakespeare was within the the tax jurisdiction
of the Sherriff of Surrey and instructions were sent to the sherriff
to make the collection. Then it was finally discovered that
Shakespeare's residence was in the Liberty of the Clink, which
was not under the jurisdiction of the sherriff, but of the Bishop
of WInchester, who evidently included Shakespeare's back taxes
in a lump sum that the Bishop accounted for in 1600, since
nothing more was heard of the matter.&quot;
-Marchette Chute, 1949

The Mountjoys lived on Silver Street in St. Olave's parish.
We cannot doubt that Shakespeare paid his taxes in Stratford
and never faced any legalities of any kind. He was a visitor
in London--that is no reason to pay twice the homage. He
had friends in high places. As patronized royal servants, I
would think that Lord Chamberlain's Men and the King's
Men received the inside track treatment on such details and
that they had learned the ropes.

Condell and Heminges lived in St Mary Aldermanbury
and were staunch parishioners. John and Rebecca Heminges
raised fourteen children; Henry and Elizabeth Condell
raised nine children.

You are going to have to spell out your crypto crock of crap
so we know your position. You touted Wood as the cure-all
for Stratfordianism but it has just blown up in your face.

You always show a smug, gloating knowledge of absolutely
nothing, Pete.

Why answer your disingenuous queries? You obnoxiously ignore
the historical record and screech like some harpie on crack.
All of your posts lack one key element: your own position.

In 250 words or less or more, what in hell do you want
everyone to know about Shakespeare and his faith? We
know that Marlowe, Jonson, and Oxford converted to
catholicism and back. What about it?

*Some variant* of the &quot;Prince Tudor&quot; scenario?

That covers a lot of territory!

I'd say somewhere between a half and two thirds.

Like the Catholic Oxford this is simply an educated guess based upon
Oxfordian literature &amp; Oxfordians on Phaeton, HLAS &amp; the Shakespeare
Fellowship Forum. There could well be a silent majority of Oxfordians out
there for which my experience is a poor sampling.

I would question your conclusion, Art, on the grounds of a probable
selection effect. The Shakespeare Fellowship is largely populated by
nutcases (Terry Ross is a noteworthy exception). Indeed, Dave Kathman
accurately characterized it as &quot;...the wack-job splinter group which
broke off from the Shakespeare-Oxford Society over a variety of issues,
but mainly the Prince Tudor 'theory' -- those in the Fellowship
(including Roger Stritmatter and, I believe, Dan Wright) are sympathetic
to the Prince Tudor idea and think it deserves to be investigated more,
while those remaining in the SOS think it's idiocy which makes
Oxfordians look bad.&quot; Surely the aforementioned &quot;silent majority,&quot;
whether silent or not, is not to be found at the Shakespeare Fellowship!
Indeed, the Shakespeare Fellowship is one of the funniest examples of an
online forum that I've seen. For example, a while back Ken Kaplan
posted (unattributed) some of Sobran's drivel at both h.l.a.s. and the
Shakespeare Fellowship; it took less than a minute for several h.la.s.
readers, myself among them, independently to identify the writing as
Sobran's and even to furnish a URL for the essay. However, Sobran's
inane article was met with enthusiasm at the Shakespeare Fellowship
forum, with &quot;Bassanio&quot; himself (who must surely be Dr. Stritmatter, at
least on stylistic grounds) inquiring whether it might be possible to
interest the author in the Shakespeare Fellowship! In short, the
Shakespeare Fellowship is what h.l.a.s. might be if there were no
&quot;Stratfordians&quot; (i.e., sane skeptics).

Now, to what address should I send your postcard when I arrive at the
Rex Deus meeting site?

It is. I never looked at it until today, but the stuff they post
straight-facedly
is hilarious. Somebody posted this, for instance, related to the recent
threads here about &quot;sieh&quot; in the monument inscription:

&quot;Note the word &quot;SIEH&quot;: most people glide by this and simply say &quot;sith&quot; or
&quot;since&quot; - but that is plainly not the word used, and it is difficult to believe
it is a mistake. An analysis of the verse as a cryptogram by David Roper
proposes that the spelling of &quot;sieh&quot; indicates a German command form
of the verb &quot;to see&quot; in use in the Low Countries (or Flanders, I forget which
exactly) and that is indicates the Flemish architect of the Vere family crypt
at Westminster Abbey as the possible resting place of the Shake-speare
manuscripts (go see &quot;all that he hath writt&quot;).&quot;

Nuff said?

See my demolition of Monsarrat's RES paper!

The Droeshout portrait is not unusual at all!

consider it reconsidered.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Like the Catholic Oxford this is simply an educated guess based upon

&gt;&gt; I would question your conclusion, Art, on the grounds of a

&gt;&gt; Indeed, Dave Kathman
&gt;&gt; accurately characterized it as &quot;...the wack-job splinter group which
&gt;&gt; broke off from the Shakespeare-Oxford Society over a variety of issues,
&gt;&gt; but mainly the Prince Tudor 'theory' -- those in the Fellowship
&gt;&gt; (including Roger Stritmatter and, I believe, Dan Wright) are sympathetic
&gt;&gt; to the Prince Tudor idea and think it deserves to be investigated more,
&gt;&gt; while those remaining in the SOS think it's idiocy which makes
&gt;&gt; Oxfordians look bad.&quot;

I was only referring to the public boards, Art -- there's enough
insanity there as it is.

No, insane, and largely unchecked by the intrusion of sanity. I

January 17 St. Anthony's Day.

&lt;&lt;On this day in the age of Queen Elizabeth,
a sick pig would be led to the DUNG-HEAP
and was not allowed to be slaughtered.&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;January 17th seems to be a &quot;red-letter&quot; day for the PoS. The
reason why seems to be that it is the saints' day for three &quot;PoS&quot;
saints: Sulpicius of Bourges, Anthony the Hermit, and Roseline de
Villeneuve. Sulpicius, who Saint-Sulpice is named after, was the
hagiogapher of St. Martin of Tours, a saint who one guidebook says &quot;is
frequently associated with places of sacred toponymical significance,&quot;
as well as pagan tree-cults. St. Anthony is invoked to help heal people
suffering from St. Anthony's Fire, a syndrome caused by consuming ergot
(which contains LSD); in the Middle Ages, Crusaders brought his body
back to the Dauphin region of France. Roseline de Villeneuve was a
Carthusian nun, associated with a &quot;rose miracle,&quot; who was so saintly
that her body remained incorrupt after her death. King Louis is said to
have checked if she was still alive, by putting a needle through her eye.

Marie de Negre (d'Ables, d'Hautpoul) is also said to have died on
January 17th, 1781, the date on her tombstone. Nicholas Flamel was said
to have achieved the Great Work of alchemy on Jan 17th, 1381. It is also
claimed that Sigisbert &quot;IV&quot;, the son of Dagobert II, arrived in RlC on
January 17th, 681 CE. The &quot;priory documents&quot; claim that a new class of
&quot;Brethren,&quot; the &quot;Children of St. Vincent&quot; or &quot;Free Brothers&quot;, were
created on January 17th, 1681, in Blois. As you will also see, this
group has a fascination with 81s and reversals. Pierre Plantard claims
he became grand master in 1981, and in 1891 Sauniere wrote in his diary
&quot;excavated a tomb. It rained.&quot; Later he would carve 'MISSION 1891&quot;
on a pillar.

&lt;&lt;At his advice, on the afternoon of the fourth we set off together,
with the intention of crossing the hills and spending the night at
the HAMLET of ROSENLAUI. We had strict injunctions, however,
on no account to pass the falls of REICHENBACH,&gt;&gt;

Reichenbach =&gt; Realm Brook
Rosenlaue =&gt; Rose landslide
Rosenlauf =&gt; Rose run

&lt;&lt;For all my efforts two more had passed before I found myself at the
fall of Reichenbach once more. There was Holmes's Alpine-stock still
leaning against the rock by which I had left him. But there was no sign
of him, and it was in vain that I shouted. My only answer was my own
voice reverberating in a rolling echo from the cliffs around me. It was
the sight of that Alpine-stock which turned me cold and sick. He had not
gone to Rosenlaui, then. He had remained on that three-foot path, with
sheer wall on one side and sheer drop on the other, until his enemy
had overtaken him.&gt;&gt;

Mrs. Henry Pott: _Francis Bacon &amp; his Secret Society_ (1891):

The Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung was set up in 1890 and the first
meeting of the Association was organised in HALLE in September 1891.
Despite the bitter antagonism between Cantor and Kronecker, Cantor
invited Kronecker to address this first meeting as a sign of respect for
one of the senior and most eminent figures in German mathematics.
However, Kronecker never addressed the meeting, since his wife was
seriously injured in a climbing accident in the summer and died on
AUGUST 23, 1891. Kronecker only outlived his wife by a few months,
and died in December 1891.&gt;&gt;

Sir James Matthew (Baronet) Barrie's melodramatic novel,
THE LITTLE MINISTER (1891), became a huge success,
and was filmed later three times.

EIDOLONS.
I MET a SEER,
Passing the hues and objects of the world,
The fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,
To glean eidolons.
Put in thy chants said he,
No more the puzzling hour nor day, nor segments, parts, put in,
Put first before the rest as light for all and entrance-song of all,
That of eidolons.

THE STRATFORD-ON-AVON BIRTHPLACE By Roderick L. Eagle

&lt;&lt;&quot; Washington Irving was a visitor to the &quot;Birthplace&quot; in 1815.
He saw &quot;a small and mean looking edifice of wood and plaster.&quot;
The rooms he found to be &quot;squalid.&quot; More spurious &quot;relics&quot;
had been added, even &quot;the sword with which he played Hamlet&quot;,
though the part was really played by Richard Burbage. The lantern
with which Friar Laurence discovered the dead Romeo was also shown.

&quot; No wonder Mr. Joseph Skipsey, who was custodian from July 1889,
to October 1891, resigned his position because of the several
frauds to which he found himself committed.&quot;

[Henry James, who wrote the terrific story called &quot;The Birthplace&quot;,
must have based it on the story of Skipsey.--sc]&gt;&gt;

Russian composer Serge Prokofiev was born April 23, 1891.

&lt;&lt;Mikhail Alexandrovich Chekhov, nephew of playwright Anton Chekhov, was
born in Russia in 1891 and by the age of 21 was already a noted actor in
his homeland. By 1923, he was a director at the Moscow Art Theatre, but
his innovative methods eventually led the Communists to label him &quot;alien
and reactionary&quot; and a &quot;sick artist.&quot; Michael Chekhov emigrated to
Germany and then England, establishing a well-respected method of
training actors. In 1939, as war was breaking out, he moved his Chekhov
Theatre Studio from England to the old Ridgefield School for Boys on
North Salem Road. While here, Mr. Chekhov made his first appearance
in an English-speaking role on the public stage - a Russian War Relief
dramatic program on the stage of the old high school (the soon-to-be
Ridgefield Playhouse), performing in each of the three short plays
presented. By 1945 he was in Hollywood, where he taught and acted
in films - his portrayal of the psychoanalyst in Alfred Hitchcock's
Spellbound won him an Academy Award nomination. Among his
students were Marilyn Monroe, Jack Palance, Anthony Quinn,
Yul Brynner, Gregory Peck, and Akim Tamiroff. He died in 1955,
but his school lives on as the Chekhov Theatre Ensemble in N.Y.C.&gt;&gt;

Herman Melville was born on August 1, 1819 and

Helene Petrovna Blavatsky (1831-1891)

Barnum, Phineas Taylor (1810-1891)

P.T. Barnum was the most famous American showman of all time. He began
his career in 1835 when he purchased a very old hymn-singing slave
named Joice HETH and exhibited her as the 161 year old nurse of George
Washington. As an additional attraction, he added the preserved body of
a FeeJee Mermaid--in reality the top half of a monkey sewn to the tail
of a fish. By 1841, Barnum had earned enough to open the American
Museum in New York City where his attractions included General Tom Thumb
and--for a short time--Jenny Lind in addition to a host of animals and
sideshow attractions. In 1871, he took his &quot;circus&quot; on the road and,
ten years later, merged his operation with James A. Bailey's.
After taking his &quot;Barnum and Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth&quot;
on a triumphant tour of London during the winter of 1889-1890,
Barnum returned to New York City.
