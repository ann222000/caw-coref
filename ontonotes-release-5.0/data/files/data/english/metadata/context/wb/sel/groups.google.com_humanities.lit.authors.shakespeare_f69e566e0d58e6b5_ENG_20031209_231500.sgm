No matter who was the true author...and without prejudging who that
person might have been...there is little doubt that given that the writer was
Jonson with his old ties (often strained over the years) to Lady Pembroke's
literary circle at Wilton House on the much more widely known Avon river in
Wiltshire...many would-be buyers of the First Folio in 1623-1624 would have
speculated or wondered if the famous mother of the &quot;Incomparable Paire&quot; to whom
the folio was dedicated...was behind the &quot;Shakespeare name&quot;. Also her portrait
in the National Gallery has swans in her lace collar as shown in John Michell's
book on the authorship debate. If there was fraud and deception, dropping a
hint in the First Folio that the author might have been a woman could have been
done with the hope or calculation that this would put a damper on any further
probing by inquisitive individuals and/or deflect attention from a male author
or authors.

Leave it to Dickson to come up with the silliest misinterpretation of
&quot;swan of Avon.&quot;

Jonson's point was not about ornithology, not about banishment, not about
the poet's being a woman, not about the poet's being the property of the
monarch, but about poetic greatness. Swans were sacred to Apollo and it
had long been traditional to call a great poet a swan.&quot; Ian Donaldson in
his edition of Jonson's *Poems* provides some context: &quot;Homer had been
known as the swan of Meander, Virgil as the swan of Mantua, and Pindar as
the Dircean swan&quot; (p.310n). That Homer, Virgil, and Pindar were called
swans does not mean that they were thought to be women or that they were
returning from banishment. Why &quot;of Avon&quot;? For the same reason Horace
called Pindar the &quot;Dircean swan&quot; -- a tribute to the home waters of the
poet.

Jonson also called Hugh Holland a &quot;swan&quot; (a &quot;black swan&quot; at that), and
referred to those poets who contributed commendatory verses to Holland's
Pancharis* as &quot;other swans.&quot; Jonson's point was not that Holland and the
other poets were returning from banishment or were the personal property
of the monarch or were women. Holland himself, by the way, wrote one of
the commendatory poems in the First Folio.

For an image about the traditional association of swans and poets, see
Alciato's emblem book, a version of which is online. Here is his emblem
184 with the original Latin text:

And here is the emblem with an English translation:

The English version reads as follows:

The insignia of the poets

There are some who bear family shields with the bird of Jupiter [i.e.,
the eagle]; there some whose signs bear a serpent or a lion. But let
these dreadful creatures flee the tablets of the poets, and let the
graceful swan sustain the learned family tree. The swan is sacred to
Phoebus and brought up in our region: once a king, it has kept its
ancient titles until now.

Geoffrey Whitney's *Choice of Emblems* (1586) included a version of
Alciato's emblem:

Insignia poetarum

The Martiall Captaines ofte, do marche into the fielde,
With Egles, or with Griphins fierce, or Dragons, in theire shielde.
But Phoebus sacred birde, let Poettes moste commende.
Who, as it were by skill devine, with songe forshowes his ende.
And as his tune delightes: for rarenes of the same.
So they with sweetenes of theire verse, shoulde winne a lasting name.
And as his colour white: Sincerenes doth declare.
So Poettes must bee cleane, and pure, and must of crime beware.
For which respectes the Swanne, should in theire Ensigne stande.
No forren fowle, and once suppos'de kinge of LIGURIA Lande.

Note that Whitney says nothing about swans as signs of a poet's banishment
(let alone of a poet's having been stabbed in the eye) or being a woman or
being the personal property of the monarch.

I disagree. There is a very good reason for thinking that Ben
Jonson had Lady Pembroke in mind in some way when he wrote
those lines. Despite what I said earlier about Wilton *House*
not being on the Avon but on the Nadder, it does in fact seem
quite likely - as Elizabeth has suggested - that the Avon did
nevertheless run through the Wilton *estate* at that time.

In particular, I now find that considerable support for this is
offered by Samuel Daniel in Sonnet 48 of his &quot;To Delia&quot; (1592),
which is apparently assumed to be addressed to Lady Pembroke.
(see   -
note 1)

None other fame myne vnambitious Muse,
Affected euer but t'eternize thee:
All other honours doe my hopes refuse,
Which meaner priz'd and momentarie bee.
For God forbid I should my papers blot,
With mercynary lines, with seruile pen:
Praising vertues in them that haue them not,
Basely attending on the hopes of men.
No no my verse respects nor Thames nor Theaters,
Nor seekes it to be knowne vnto the Great:
But *Auon* rich in fame, though poore in waters,
Shall have my song, where *Delia* hath her seate.
*Auon* shall be my Thames, and she my Song;
Ile sound her name the Ryuer all along.

Given the connections between the Pembrokes and the First
Folio (and Jonson), and the juxtaposition of Avon and Thames
in Daniel's sonnet 48, I find it inconceivable either that
Jonson was unaware of it, or that he did not have it in the
back of his mind in some way when penning his elegy to
Shakespeare.

It also surprises me that this sonnet has apparently never
been quoted on HLAS in this context before, even though Jim
did post the whole thing, on another topic, in March 2002.

I think we may assume that Thomas Watson and Christopher
Marlowe were well acquainted with each other, both of
them having been imprisoned in Newgate for the killing
of William Bradley in an affray involving both of them
in 1589.

When the posthumous publication of Watson's *Amintae
Gaudia* had a Latin dedication on his behalf written by
a poet 'C.M.', therefore, we may assume, as most people
do, that this dedication was by Christopher Marlowe.

The dedication is addressed: *Illustrissimae Heroinae
Omnibus et Animi et Corporis Dotibus Ornatissimae,
Mariae Penbrokiae Comitissae*, which Pendry and Maxwell
translate as &quot;To the most illustrious lady, endowed with
all gifts both of mind and of body, Mary, Countess of
Pembroke&quot;.

The dedication opens: *Laurigera stirpe prognata Delia,
Sidnaei vatis Apollinei genuina soror*, of which their
translation is: &quot;Delia, sprung from a laurel-crowned
race, true sister of Sidney, the bard of Apollo&quot;.

This, presumably, is the same Delia as referred to in:

But *Auon* rich in fame, though poore in waters,
Shall have my song, where *Delia* hath her seate.
*Auon* shall be my Thames, and she my Song;
Ile sound her name the Ryuer all along.

Terry has reminded us that &quot;Swans were sacred to Apollo
and it had long been traditional to call a great poet a
swan.&quot;

It would therefore seem quite possible for the phrase
&quot;Swan of Avon&quot; not only to refer to the Countess herself,
but to any 'great' poet having lived and worked under her
protection at Wilton House before 1623. One is therefore
reminded of the alleged 1603 letter written by the
Countess to her son, the Earl, claiming that &quot;We have
the man Shakespeare with us&quot;.

The reference to Delia is obviously to Samuel Daniel, Lady Pembroke's most
famous protege, and author in 1592 of a collection of sonnets entitled Delia
and dedicated to her. Though her Wilton House is not right on the banks of the
Avon it is on a tributary and close enough for persons to make this connection.
Again Jonson's Sweet Swan of Avon in a dedication poem in the First Folio
dedicated to her two sons...and not anyone close to the Stratford man...has the
practical effect of turning attention in her direction..no matter what the
truth was.
That was my point in an earlier email message.

Gary, don't let the local Marlites and Oxites (for whom the convention of
referring to poets as swans is news) lead you astray. Shakespeare was
called the swan of Avon because Stratford, his home town, is on the Avon.
Pindar was the &quot;Dircean swan&quot; to Horace, and Jonson in his ode for Hugh
Holland refers to &quot;The clear Dircean fount / Where Pindar swam&quot; -- again,
a reference to waters near the poet's birthplace. Digges in the First
Folio refers to Shakespeare's &quot;Stratford monument,&quot; so if there were
readers who were unsure which Avon town Shakespeare hailed from, Digges
provides further confirmation.

It is surprising that Peter Farey wastes his energies on his latest
misconstruals. Part of his Marlite view is that people were SUPPOSED to
think William Shakespeare wrote the works of Shakespeare. Thus the
reference to Shakespeare as the &quot;swan of Avon&quot; should only confirm Peter
in his jolly &quot;Aha! That's just what they WANT us to think!&quot; For Peter,
ALL evidence that Shakespeare wrote the works of Shakespeare confirms that
he did not, and this attitude he calls &quot;logic.&quot;

To be consistent (but why should an antistratfordian be consistent?) Peter
should fight every temptation to read evidence in a Marlite way, because
it works against his underlying &quot;aha!&quot; move. If any contemporary had left
the slightest indication that Marlowe and not Shakespeare had written
*Venus and Adonis* or *Hamlet* then Peter's view that people were supposed
to think Shakespeare had written the works is in trouble.

I'm not sure whether the bracketed bit refers to me or not,
but although not news to me it was something I had forgotten.
Once I started reading Terry's post I recognized it straight
away as an extract, with minor alteration, from an essay on
his and Dave's web-site.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

As Terry knows full well, I claim that the Stratford monument
is to the memory of *author* of the works presented as Shakes-
peare's, and that the monument tells us that this 'persona'
included Christopher Marlowe in some way. Digges's poem speaks
of the time when this Stratford monument will be &quot;dissolved&quot;
- in other words when its hidden message will be worked out.

Don't be naughty, Terry. All evidence that Shakespeare wrote
the works of Shakespeare of course supports the case for his
having done so.

The question for me, however, is whether that evidence is
sufficient to debunk any theory that he did *not* do so. In
this case, and arising from my consideration of other pieces
of evidence such as the monument, I see a strong probability
that Jonson and Digges are playing games with us, appearing
to say one thing whilst actually meaning another.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Anti-Stratfordian argument, such as it is, must necessarily
fall into four types.

1) Offering arguments for one's candidate(s)

2) Countering arguments against one's candidate(s)

3) Offering arguments against Shakespeare

4) Countering arguments for Shakespeare.

In my case, I would say the main argument *for* Marlowe
is what I claim to be the hidden message in the Stratford
monument. The main example of (2) for me would be (of
course) the argument that his death was probably faked.
As far as (3) is concerned, I recognize the highly sub-
jective nature of my views, so tend to avoid the tactic.
What we are covering here is an example of item (4).

Jonson's reference to &quot;Swan of Avon&quot; (and Digges's to
the &quot;Stratford Monument&quot;) are given as evidence - and I
do not deny that they are good evidence - for Shakespeare
of Stratford having written the works. But do they prove
it?

Now, I find it difficult to believe that Jonson would want
to write an out-and-out lie if it could be avoided, but I
do think that he would have been prepared to write something
which:

a) Appeared to say one thing, but in fact said another

b) Played with words and meanings in a (to him) amusing way

c) Had a real meaning which could be denied if necessary.

My question therefore goes like this: IF Marlowe survived
and played a major part in writing these plays, would it
be *possible* for Jonson's words to be interpreted in a
way that allowed for that interpretation? And given what
I say the monument (and Digges) are saying, and what we
now understand about the way in which &quot;Swan of Avon&quot;,
can be interpreted, I am now simply claiming that it is
quite possible for him to have had such a hidden meaning
in mind. Before this discussion, I was not so sure.

If this is addressed to me (and it's by no means obvious)
you appear to have read only the second of my two posts

you read the first, as it supports what you said, and

fooleries. In &quot;An Execration upon Vulcan,&quot; he wrote:

Had I compil'd from Amadis de Gaule,
Th' Esplandians, Arthur's, Palmerins, and all
The learned Library of Don Quixote;
And so some goodlier Monster had begot,
Or spun out Riddles, and weav'd fifty Tomes
Of Logogriphes, and curious Palindromes,

Or Eteostichs, or those finer Flams
Of Eggs, and Halberds, Cradles, and a Hearse,
A pair of Scisars, and a Comb in Verse;
Acrostichs, and Telestichs, on jump Names,
Thou then hadst had some colour for thy Flames,
On such my serious Follies; But, thou'lt say,
There were some Pieces of as base allay,
And as false stamp there; parcels of a Play,
Fitter to see the Fire-light, than the day;

Jonson admitted to writing plays, but he complained to Vulcan that his work
had not included such trifles as riddles, acrostics, or anagrams.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My question therefore goes like this: IF Marlowe survived
&gt; and played a major part in writing these plays, would it

&gt; I say the monument (and Digges) are saying, and what we
&gt; now understand about the way in which &quot;Swan of Avon&quot;,
&gt; can be interpreted, I am now simply claiming that it is

The one thing in common with virtually all anti-Strat theories is that
Jonson was a party to the &quot;conspiracy.&quot; Unfortunately for the anti-Strats,
Jonson had a bad habit of remaining true to his art, a trait that landed in
him in prison more than once. Participation in such a conspiracy could
hardly have been in his nature. Especially where it would have involved
cover for a rival that he obviously considered an inferior. Even though
they may have been friends, Jonson couldn't avoid telling William Drummond
in 1619 that Shakespeare had lacked artistic talent.

The statement to Drummond works against the anti-Strats both ways. If
Jonson had known that Shakespeare was more or less a &quot;front&quot; for another
writer, and was actually referring to the true author when he mentioned
&quot;Shakespeare&quot; to Drummond, why would he have participated in a conspiracy to
hide the true author's identity when he had such a low opinion of the
author's artistic talent? And if he was merely being dismissive of the
Stratfordian Shakespeare because he knew the true author to be some one
else, how could he have expected Drummond to understand that by dismissing
the Stratfordian he wasn't actually being disrespectful of the talent of the
true author?

&gt; It is surprising that Peter Farey wastes his energies on his latest
&gt; misconstruals. Part of his Marlite view is that people were SUPPOSED to
&gt; think William Shakespeare wrote the works of Shakespeare.

"/>

After years (and probably decades) of 'countering'
anti-Strat arguments, Terry has finally (but only
barely) grasped one of the most basic tenets of
anti-Stratfordianism.

OK, ok, Strats are S L O W . . . but this slow?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thus the
&gt; reference to Shakespeare as the &quot;swan of Avon&quot; should only confirm Peter
&gt; in his jolly &quot;Aha! That's just what they WANT us to think!&quot;

"/>

And he is truly shocked by it! He finds it
staggering that ANYONE should think like
that -- or should WANT to think like that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For Peter,
&gt; ALL evidence that Shakespeare wrote the works of Shakespeare confirms that
&gt; he did not, and this attitude he calls &quot;logic.&quot;

"/>

I have several times asked here why Terry in
his voluminous anti-anti-Stratfordian writing
never attempted to deal with the basic anti-
Stratfordian position. I assumed that it was
deviousness on his part -- that he could not
deal with it, so he avoided doing so.

I extend my most humble apologies to Terry.
I now realise that any imputation of
'deviousness' was wholly misplaced.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; To be consistent (but why should an antistratfordian be consistent?) Peter
&gt; should fight every temptation to read evidence in a Marlite way, because
&gt; it works against his underlying &quot;aha!&quot; move. If any contemporary had left
&gt; the slightest indication that Marlowe and not Shakespeare had written
&gt; *Venus and Adonis* or *Hamlet* then Peter's view that people were supposed
&gt; to think Shakespeare had written the works is in trouble.

"/>

That's the problem with conspiracies, Terry.
IF LBJ (or the Mafia, etc.) had really been
responsible for Kennedy's assassination,
then we can't actually take their words on
the matter as the unvarnished truth. That's
why historians _hate_ conspiracies. If they
are substantially successful, they screw up
the record. That's one reason why it's also a
lot easier to avoid ALL conspiracy theories.
But the problem is: conspiracies have been
known to have happened at various points
in human history -- especially 'conspiracies'
created by governments. So -- much as we
would wish it -- they can't all automatically
be ruled out.

We have to look at the whole picture and
see whether or not it makes sense. A theory
that proposes that the greatest writer in the
language had illiterate parents and illiterate
children does not start off with much
credibility. When it then turns out that
not a scrap of 'his' manuscript survives,
other than six truly appalling signatures,
and that no one ever seems to have met
him . . . and so on and on and on . . . then
not much of the case remains.

Jonson was not a 'party to the conspiracy.'

Jonson knew who wrote the plays and he edited the
First Folio but there was never a conspiracy. If
you will consult Franklin William's work on dedications
and commendatory letters printed between 1560 and 1642
you will find many hundreds of members of the gentry
and aristocracy who wrote but did not put their own names
on their works. Franklin went through 35,000 books over a
fifteen year period and whittled it down to about 15,000 entries,
a great number of them unsigned or written behind initials
(often standing for Greek or Latin writers), pseuds, masks
and what have you.

The stigma of print was real for members of a certain class
but not for members of the lower classes. As far as I know
'Shakespeare' is one of the very rare members of the lower
classes who published any poetry in that era.

Class was defined by what one did and the lower classes didn't
presume to be poets. It's really quite unthinkable and Taylor
was only tolerated because he was a little derranged. You'll
note that Taylor never got much in the way of patronage.

that much, and as Yamada states, Jonson and Chapman essentially
cooked up a complaint against the author of the Shakespeare works
for not adhereing to the Greek rules of drama, for being 'too Roman,'
as in Plautus and Terrence but 'not Roman enough' as in Cicero (who
also laid down some precepts for drama) and as in Seneca who
exaggerated the rules of Greek tragedy.

Jonson is not talking about the Latin language because clearly,
whoever wrote the Shakespeare works knew Ovid inside and out
and was not relying on Golding.

'Small Latin' and 'less Greek' refers to 'Shakespeare' violating
the classical rules of drama but on the literal level he's
reminding the actor that he had 'little Latin' and probably no
Greek. Jonson says he 'would' honor Shakespeare by calling in
the great classical dramatists but he narrowly avoids doing it.

Perhaps you'd better read the poem again. Jonson is saying that Vulcan

Sorry, Ms. Weir, but you've gone off the rails on this one. The &quot;monster&quot;
is not a &quot;genius.&quot; The &quot;monster&quot; would be a *work* to rival what Jonson
would have written if he had &quot;compil'd from Amadis de Gaule, / Th'

Drummond recorded two mentions of Bacon by Jonson. Both times Jonson spoke
of Bacon in the present tense, because Bacon was still alive in 1619. He
spoke of Shakespeare in the past tense, because Shakespeare had died by
then. See how it works?

William Drummond reported that in 1619 Ben Jonson had
told him 'That Shakspeer wanted arte.'

In 1623, however, the following lines of Ben Jonson's
were published in the First Folio:

Yet must I not giue Nature all: Thy Art,
My gentle Shakespeare, must enioy a part.
For though the Poets matter, Nature be,
His Art doth giue the fashion. And, that he,
Who casts to write a liuing line, must sweat,

Vpon the Muses anuile : turne the same,

Or for the lawrell, he may gaine a scorne,
For a good Poet's made, as well as borne.
And such wert thou. Looke how the fathers face
Liues in his issue, euen so, the race
Of Shakespeares minde, and manners brightly shines
In his well torned, and true filed lines :

As I said: We have to look at the whole
picture and see whether or not it makes sense.
Coming to conclusions solely on the basis of
the numbers of 'signatures' is not a good idea.

While Marlowe is a far better candidate than
the Stratman (he had a literate father, he went
to Cambridge, he travelled overseas, and his
name was known to the Privy Council) he still
comes far too short. No reasonable account

&gt;&gt; Anti-Stratfordian argument, such as it is, must necessarily
&gt;&gt; fall into four types.

&gt;&gt; 1) Offering arguments for one's candidate(s)

&gt;&gt; 2) Countering arguments against one's candidate(s)

&gt;&gt; 3) Offering arguments against Shakespeare

&gt;&gt; 4) Countering arguments for Shakespeare.

&gt;&gt; In my case, I would say the main argument *for* Marlowe
&gt;&gt; is what I claim to be the hidden message in the Stratford
&gt;&gt; monument. The main example of (2) for me would be (of
&gt;&gt; course) the argument that his death was probably faked.
&gt;&gt; As far as (3) is concerned, I recognize the highly sub-
&gt;&gt; jective nature of my views, so tend to avoid the tactic.
&gt;&gt; What we are covering here is an example of item (4).

&gt;&gt; Jonson's reference to &quot;Swan of Avon&quot; (and Digges's to
&gt;&gt; the &quot;Stratford Monument&quot;) are given as evidence - and I
&gt;&gt; do not deny that they are good evidence - for Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; of Stratford having written the works. But do they prove
&gt;&gt; it?

&gt;&gt; Now, I find it difficult to believe that Jonson would want
&gt;&gt; to write an out-and-out lie if it could be avoided, but I
&gt;&gt; do think that he would have been prepared to write something
&gt;&gt; which:

&gt;&gt; a) Appeared to say one thing, but in fact said another

&gt;&gt; b) Played with words and meanings in a (to him) amusing way

&gt;&gt; c) Had a real meaning which could be denied if necessary.
&gt; Of course, such &quot;games&quot; are just the sort of things Jonson
&gt; derided as base fooleries. In &quot;An Execration upon Vulcan,&quot;
&gt; he wrote:

&gt; Had I compil'd from Amadis de Gaule,
&gt; Th' Esplandians, Arthur's, Palmerins, and all
&gt; The learned Library of Don Quixote;
&gt; And so some goodlier Monster had begot,
&gt; Or spun out Riddles, and weav'd fifty Tomes
&gt; Of Logogriphes, and curious Palindromes,
&gt; Or pomp'd for those hard Trifles Anagrams,
&gt; Or Eteostichs, or those finer Flams
&gt; Of Eggs, and Halberds, Cradles, and a Hearse,
&gt; A pair of Scisars, and a Comb in Verse;
&gt; Acrostichs, and Telestichs, on jump Names,
&gt; Thou then hadst had some colour for thy Flames,
&gt; On such my serious Follies; But, thou'lt say,
&gt; There were some Pieces of as base allay,
&gt; And as false stamp there; parcels of a Play,
&gt; Fitter to see the Fire-light, than the day;

&gt; Jonson admitted to writing plays, but he complained to
&gt; Vulcan that his work had not included such trifles as riddles,
&gt; acrostics, or anagrams.

"/>

Jonson obviously assumed that Vulcan had a short memory! If
not, his &quot;On Margaret Ratcliffe&quot; (d.1599) may well have
caused the conflagration. Check the first letters of each
line?

Marble, weep, for thou dost cover
A dead beauty underneath thee,
Rich as nature could bequeath thee:
Grant then no rude hand remove her.
All the gazers on the skies
Read not in fair heaven's story,
Expresser truth or truer glory
Than they might in her bright eyes.
Rare as wonder was her wit;
And like Nectar ever flowing:
Till time, strong by her bestowing,
Conquered hath both life and it.
Life, whose grief was out of fashion
In these times. Few have so rued
Fate in a brother. To conclude,
For wit, feature, and true passion
Earth, thou hast not such another.

Sure, Jonson also told his mate Drummond that &quot;He scorned
anagrams&quot; (l.445) but this didn't stop him a bit later
concluding a poem to Mrs Alice Sutcliffe:

I said, Who'd supped so deep
Of this sweet chalice
Must Celia be:
The anagram of Alice.

No, Clark. I think what the 'Vulcan' extract contains is
more probably an attack on people, not poetry. I mean,
why would Jonson attack

from Amadis de Gaule,
Th' Esplandians, Arthur's, Palmerins, and all
The learned Library of Don Quixote;

having done translations himself? Isn't it more likely
that he was tilting at Antony Munday, who had indeed
done some of *these* translations, and whom Jonson had
(apparently) already attacked in *The Case is Altered*?

Similarly, with all of these &quot;courtly trifles&quot;, isn't he
perhaps having a go at Puttenham who, in his *The Art of
English Poesy* (which predated Jonson's own work on the
same subject) seemed to favour just this sort of thing?

And, even if not, what we are talking about here is not
any of the word games listed in his poem, but a possible
hidden meaning for the poem as a whole. Quite different.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; My question therefore goes like this: IF Marlowe survived

I had not forgotten this piece (in fact, I've posted it at:
). But, as you say, it
was written at least 15 years prior to Jonson's penning of his Execration.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I don't believe I've seen the poem to Ms. Sutcliffe, so I can't comment on
whether or not it follows the penning of the Execration (the date of
composition of which hasn't been established at any rate, AFAIK, though
presumably it was sometime during or after 1623), and you haven't quoted
enough of the piece for me to see how Jonson is using this in context.

Besides, I didn't say that Jonson didn't understand anagrams, I merely
quoted him as dismissing them as trifles and saying that he was not guilty
of penning them. Since Jonson had penned verses to &quot;Celia&quot; in both &quot;The
Forest&quot; and &quot;Underwoods,&quot; as well as making her a character in Volpone, it
doesn't suprise me much that he'd deviate from his rule to make his (rather
obvious) observation here.

Do you see this as an attack on translations? I took it as an attack on
excessively bombastic and outdated chivalric romances. For instance, note
that Jonson is not complaining about a translation of Don Quixote, he is
referring to Don Quixote's library of chivalric romances (which was the
motivation for the foolish knight's delusions). Hence the charactarization
of such things as being &quot;monsters.&quot;

Oh, he's definitely tilting against The Art of English Poesy, since his
reference to &quot;Of Eggs, and Halberds, Cradles, and a Hearse&quot; is a rather neat
paraphrase of a line from Puttenham's work. But even so, it looks to me
that he's genuinely deriding these fooleries (despite his earlier &quot;slip&quot;
with Ms. Ratcliffe).

If such a &quot;hidden meaning&quot; exists (and you know that I disagree with you
that one does), it would, ipso facto, be an example of Renaissance &quot;trick

As early as 1614 Jonson had publicly chastised himself for hyperbole in
penning commendatory verse. See &quot;An Epistle to Master John Selden&quot;
( ), where Jonson
wrote:

&quot;Though I confess (as every Muse hath err'd,
And mine not least) I have too oft preferr'd
Men past their terms, and prais'd some Names too much...&quot;

And although Jonson goes on to inform Master Selden that:

&quot;Since being deceiv'd, I turn a sharper Eye
Upon my self, and ask to whom? and why?
And what I write? and vex it many days
Before Men get a Verse; much less a Praise:
So that my Reader is assur'd, I now
Mean what I speak, and still will keep that Vow...&quot;

the continued examples of extravagant commendatory verse that gushes forth
is ample evidence that he was unable to keep his vow.

Yeah, I've seen this argument before on HLAS, but I don't recall what
evidence has been given to support the contention. But it hardly matters
for the purposes of my proposition.

The point is that Jonson had strong critical views on what constituted the
proper way to write drama (a rather central point of the so-called &quot;War of
the Theaters&quot;, wouldn't you say?). And although I have no doubt that he
personally loved Shakespeare (this side of idolatry), Shakespeare's plays do
not abide well with Jonson's critical theories. Jonson makes this point in
the prologue to &quot;Every Man in His Humor,&quot; the induction of &quot;Bartholomew
Fair,&quot; the induction of &quot;The Staple of News,&quot; his comments in &quot;Discoveries,&quot;
and in his poke at &quot;Pericles&quot; in his &quot;Ode to Himself&quot; (appended to &quot;The New
Inn&quot; on my Jonson website).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The statement to Drummond works against the anti-Strats
&gt;&gt; both ways. If Jonson had known that Shakespeare was more
&gt;&gt; or less a &quot;front&quot; for another writer, and was actually

&gt; before getting into that one, shall we?

"/>

Again, the point is that Jonson appears to have honestly believed that
Shakespeare's plays were inferior to his own because Shakespeare didn't
abide by Jonson's critical theory of drama. So I believe that the dilemma
I've outlined remains for anti-Strats.

&gt;&gt; Jonson wrote that just after his papers were burned in
&gt;&gt; a fire. He lost a couple of play scripts and all his
&gt;&gt; books and it was a real setback for him financially.

&gt;&gt; Jonson is telling Vulcan, the Roman god of fire, that
&gt;&gt; because there's a greater genius writing than Jonson
&gt;&gt; (a genius was defined as a 'prodigy' or 'monster,'
&gt;&gt; something 'abnormal' in that era) Vulcan will just dismiss
&gt;&gt; his fire because Jonson's works were, by comparison,
&gt;&gt; 'base alloy,' the latter possilbly a reference to Jonson's
&gt;&gt; constant plagiarizing of the classics.

&gt; Perhaps you'd better read the poem again.

&gt;&gt; it was developed, sometimes bawdily, by bored scribes in

&gt; Sorry, Ms. Weir, but you've gone off the rails on this one. The &quot;monster&quot;

The 1913 Webster's shows:

\Prod&quot;i*gy\, n.; pl. {Prodigies}. [ L. prodigium; pro
before + (perh.) a word appearing in adagium adage: cf. F.
prodige. Cf. {Adage}. ]
1. Something extraordinary, or out of the usual course of
nature, from which omens are drawn; a portent; as,
eclipses and meteors were anciently deemed prodigies.
So many terrors, voices, prodigies, May warn thee,
as a sure foregoing sign. --Milton.
2. Anything so extraordinary as to excite wonder or
astonishment; a marvel; as, a PRODIGY OF LEARNING.
3. A production out of ordinary course of nature; an abnormal
development; a MONSTER. --B. JONSON.
Syn: Wonder; miracle; portent; marvel; MONSTER.

My point was that the superstitious Elizabethans viewed genius
as something abnormal unlike the more sophisticated French
who celebrated Bacon's genius when he was a sixteen year-old
at the Court of Henry IV. The English Renaissance was a hundred
years behind Italy's when the Sidneys began a literary project
that would make the English literary Renaissance surpass them
all in only thirty years. Of course the Sidneys had their genius
cousin Francis writing on their behalf. Bacon is the only genius
the English Renaissance produced.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The one thing in common with virtually all anti-Strat theories is that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson was a party to the &quot;conspiracy.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Jonson was not a 'party to the conspiracy.'

&gt;&gt; Jonson knew who wrote the plays and he edited the
&gt;&gt; First Folio but there was never a conspiracy. If
&gt;&gt; you will consult Franklin William's work on dedications
&gt;&gt; and commendatory letters printed between 1560 and 1642
&gt;&gt; you will find many hundreds of members of the gentry
&gt;&gt; and aristocracy who wrote but did not put their own names
&gt;&gt; on their works. Franklin went through 35,000 books over a
&gt;&gt; fifteen year period and whittled it down to about 15,000 entries,
&gt;&gt; a great number of them unsigned or written behind initials
&gt;&gt; (often standing for Greek or Latin writers), pseuds, masks
&gt;&gt; and what have you.

&gt;&gt; The stigma of print was real for members of a certain class
&gt;&gt; but not for members of the lower classes. As far as I know
&gt;&gt; 'Shakespeare' is one of the very rare members of the lower
&gt;&gt; classes who published any poetry in that era.

&gt; Such as Jonson? Jonson was of the same class as Shakespeare. Or perhaps
&gt; you've heard of Marlowe, another in Shakespeare's class?

"/>

Jonson's rank was higher than the Stratford tradesman and
Marlowe's was higher than either. Any man with an MA from the
universities was a member of the 'lower aristocracy,' a priviledge
that was a holdover from the Roman Catholic university era when
all MAs took holy orders. They were 'gentry,' or 'gentlemen.' The
'worshippe's' in Groatsworth are university MA's or more
likely lawyers (with university MA's) who have come 'round
to straighten out Greene about 'Shakespeare.' That indicates that
they were looking out for their peer Francis Bacon. No 'worshippes'
would bother interceding on behalf of a rankless actor.

Furthermore--I'll have to post on this--the Strat presumption that
the Stratford tradesman was 'gentry' is balderdash. One's class was
determined by what one did for a living.

Jonson had a coat of arms (not purchased) but was a brick layer.
His occupation kept Jonson in the yeoman class until he received
his honorary MA's although as Camden's protege, a classical
scholar and extraordinary wit, Jonson was allowed into the
literary circles before he was given his MA's.

Gabriel Harvey's family was authentic gentry and the three
Harvey brothers all matriculated Cambridge but their father
decided to invest in a rope-making business as a sideline--
bad idea--and Nashe used that fact to destroy Harvey socially.
Harvey was a doctor of philosophy at two universities but
Nashe reduced him to the rank of a de facto yeoman. Harvey
was forced to leave his position at Cambridge.

The Stratford tradesman's sources of income were malting
(and presumably profits on illegally hoarded malt),
tithe-collecting which in Warwickshire made him a commodity
trader since tithes were collected in hay and corn; usery,
theatre shares and pandering.

He was poised to drive cottagers off a 107 acre property he
bought with proceeds from the above in order to invest in the
highly profitable sheep farming business when Quiney and Sturley
(the good guys) successfully petitioned Chief Justice Coke who
sided with the Stratford Corporation against Combes and *his*
protege the sell-out Shakspere. The grateful Stratford Corporation
gave Coke a giant wheel of cheese.

The Blackfriars deed and the fact that the Puritan Parliament
confiscated Susanna Hall's bawdy house indicates that taken
together, the Stratford tradesman's 'means' exclude him from being
counted as 'gentry.' The profits from the bawdy house and theatre
shares allowed him to 'live like gentry' and his tithe-shares gave
him an opportunity to deface fine medieval architecture by putting
his crude tombs on the altar platform but he was never gentry.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Class was defined by what one did and the lower classes didn't
&gt;&gt; presume to be poets. It's really quite unthinkable and Taylor
&gt;&gt; was only tolerated because he was a little derranged. You'll
&gt;&gt; note that Taylor never got much in the way of patronage.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunately for the anti-Strats,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson had a bad habit of remaining true to his art, a trait that landed
&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt; him in prison more than once. Participation in such a conspiracy could
&gt;&gt;&gt; hardly have been in his nature.

&gt;&gt; Correct. There was no conspiracy.

Pardon this lengthy reply, John, but not everyone has immediate access to
the OED. I've appended the OED entry for &quot;art&quot; when used as a noun,
excluding the combining forms that appear later on. As you may note, every
definition of the word &quot;art&quot; has examples that either bracket Jonson's use
of the word in 1619, or are at least contemporaneous, with the exception of
meaning numbers 2. b., 6 and 9. b. (and perhaps 12, depending upon how
generous you wish to be), none of which pertain to the written word.

Now, just what grounds are you relying upon to maintain that Jonson most
assuredly meant &quot;craft&quot; when he spoke to Drummond in 1619?

Jonson elsewhere uses &quot;art&quot; to mean things other than &quot;artistic talent&quot;,
and I'm not sure that there is any other example of his that shows
him using &quot;art&quot; in that sense. Here are two from his plays:

Catiline 3.1
Reports? Do you believe them Catullus,
Why, he does make, and breed them for the people;
To endear his service to them. Do you not taste
An art, that is so common? Popular men,
They must create strange Monsters, and then quell them;
To make their arts seem something. Would you have
Such an Herculean Actor in the Scene,
And not his Hydra? They must sweat no less
To fit their properties, then to express their parts.

Every Man In His Humour 1.4

Aye, did you ever see it acted? Is't not well penned?

Well penned: I would fain see all the Poets of our time
pen such another play as that was; They will prate and swagger, and
keep a stir of art and devices, when (as I am a gentleman) read 'em,
they are the most shallow pitiful barren fellows that live upon the face of the

earth again.
=====================

Given that elsewhere Jonson lavishly praises Shakespeare's ability,
I think you have to interpret &quot;art&quot; in this case to mean &quot;sophistication&quot;,
and by that I mean a particular kind of sophistication, the kind that
Jonson admired (knowledge of the the unities, classical allusions etc).
I think such things would be classified in the modern dictionaries
as:

8.a. arts. Artful devices, stratagems, and tricks.
b. Artful contrivance; cunning
(American Heritage)

See my demolition of Monsarrat's RES paper!

The Droeshout portrait is not unusual at all!

Thanks, but in my response to Peter's response to my original post, I also
said:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yeah, I've seen this argument before on HLAS, but I don't recall what
&gt; evidence has been given to support the contention. But it hardly matters
&gt; for the purposes of my proposition.

&gt; The point is that Jonson had strong critical views on what constituted the
&gt; proper way to write drama (a rather central point of the so-called &quot;War of
&gt; the Theaters&quot;, wouldn't you say?). And although I have no doubt that he
&gt; personally loved Shakespeare (this side of idolatry), Shakespeare's plays
do
&gt; not abide well with Jonson's critical theories. Jonson makes this point
in
&gt; the prologue to &quot;Every Man in His Humor,&quot; the induction of &quot;Bartholomew
&gt; Fair,&quot; the induction of &quot;The Staple of News,&quot; his comments in
&quot;Discoveries,&quot;
&gt; and in his poke at &quot;Pericles&quot; in his &quot;Ode to Himself&quot; (appended to &quot;The
New
&gt; Inn&quot; on my Jonson website).

"/>

and

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Again, the point is that Jonson appears to have honestly believed that
&gt; Shakespeare's plays were inferior to his own because Shakespeare didn't
&gt; abide by Jonson's critical theory of drama. So I believe that the dilemma
&gt; I've outlined remains for anti-Strats.

"/>

Whether it was lack of artistic talent, or merely lack of craft, the
Drummond conundrum for anti-Strats is that Jonson cast Shakespeare in an
inferior light, not just in the quote I've noted, but also where he knocked
the shipwreck on the &quot;coast&quot; of Bohemia in The Winter's Tale. So, why would
he have done that if he was actively participating in a plot to conceal the
identity of the anti-Strat's &quot;true author&quot;?

Seems simple enough to me. Every sense of the word &quot;art&quot; listed in the OED
was in use circa 1619, except for a few that do not pertain to art in
literature.

I agree that he does not have 6 in mind. But what does meaning 6 have to do
with artistic talent in literature? Meaning 6 applies to the visual arts.
Neither the definition nor any of the examples given under sense 6 make any
mention of literature.

Actually, it sounds as if you're agreeing with me. Sense 5 applies to art
in literature, and it doesn't mean mere craft (which would seem to be
covered best by 2.a.). Sense 5 implies esthetic perfection, something that
requires talent, not mere craft.

&gt;&gt; My essential point is that Jonson certainly does _not_ have
&gt;&gt; meaning 6 (or any of categories II or III) in mind, which
&gt;&gt; is what Lewis would call the &quot;dangerous sense&quot; of &quot;art&quot;,
&gt;&gt; and, more particularly, that he even more certainly does
&gt;&gt; not mean &quot;talent&quot;. Sense 5 is where I should put it.

&gt; I agree that he does not have 6 in mind. But what does
&gt; meaning 6 have to do with artistic talent in literature?
&gt; Meaning 6 applies to the visual arts. Neither the definition
&gt; nor any of the examples given under sense 6 make any mention
&gt; of literature.

&gt; Actually, it sounds as if you're agreeing with me. Sense 5
&gt; applies to art in literature, and it doesn't mean mere craft
&gt; (which would seem to be covered best by 2.a.). Sense 5
&gt; implies esthetic perfection, something that requires talent,
&gt; not mere craft.

"/>

In his poem &quot;To the memory of my beloued...&quot;, Jonson wrote:

Yet must I not giue Nature all : Thy Art,
My gentle Shakespeare, must enioy a part.
For though the Poets matter, Nature be,
His Art doth giue the fashion. And, that he,
Who casts to write a liuing line, must sweat,
(Such as thine are) and strike the second heat
Vpon the Muses anuile : turne the same,
(And himselfe with it) that he thinkes to frame ;
Or for the lawrell, he may gaine a scorne,
For a good Poet's made, as well as borne.
And such wert thou. Looke how the fathers face
Liues in his issue, euen so, the race
Of Shakespeares minde, and manners brightly shines
In his well torned, and true filed lines :
In each of which, he seemes to shake a Lance,
As branish't at the eyes of Ignorance.

'Art' as used here is mainly:

2.a. Human skill as an agent, human workmanship.
Opposed to nature.

although there may also be, as JWK suggested, something of:

5. The application of skill to subjects of taste, as poetry,
music, dancing, the drama, oratory, literary composition,
and the like;

The last two lines, however, do seem to add something
more like:

3.a. The learning of the schools; or
b. gen. Scholarship, learning, science.

What is clear, however, is that Jonson is praising Shakes-
peare for having 'Art'. Yet Drummond reports him as saying
&quot;That Shakspeer wanted arte.&quot;

Presumably this might mean either

* That Jonson (or Drummond) was using a different
meaning on that occasion,

* That Jonson was simply applying definition 3 to the
man from Stratford, regardless of what his 'lines'
might suggest,

* That Drummond misunderstood what Jonson had said,

* That Jonson was in full flow, and just said it for
effect, or

* That this was what he really thought, and that he was
therefore over-praising him in the First Folio.

Whichever of these (or others) might explain it, however,
it really gives me no problem as far as my own views are
concerned.

Hmmm. I'm sure you'll correct me, but it seems to me that your views
require Jonson to be an active participant in
the-not-as-dead-as-everyone-thought Marlowe's use of Shakespeare as a
&quot;front&quot; (and, if I remember correctly, occasional assist as minor
co-author). Yet we find evidence not only in what Jonson said to Drummond,
but in his own plays, poems, and personal notes that he found serious flaws
with the writing of Shakespeare's plays (despite his personal affection for
the man).

Where Jonson did have unqualified praise for Shakespeare was in the
commendatory verse in the First Folio. But Jonson had unqualified praise
for *everybody* when he wrote commendatory verse. To give some examples,
there are his epigrams for:
Camden:
Donne:   and

Beaumont:
Edward Allen:
Edmonds:   and

Filmer:
Ferrabosco:   and

Sylvester:
and his epistle to Selden:

and his sonnet to Mary Worth:

Further, you've seemed to imply, on occasion, that perhaps Jonson had
written your supposed riddle. Yet we find in one of his comments to
Drummond and in his Execration Upon Vulcan that he shunned such things.

In addition, Jonson gives us further reason to doubt your views. Although
you may not fall into this category, there are some Marlovians who
apparently have some sort of James Bondian fantasies about Marlowe as a
super-secret agent working for Her Majesty's Government. But if he engaged
in such activities at all, there's no reason to think him to have been any
more than a simple informer and counterfeiter.

Yet Jonson had little reason to involve himself with such a person. His
time in prison was due to the allegations and slanders of informers (see
Jonson's letter from prison in 1605 to the Earl of Suffolk, where he
complained that &quot;It hath euer bene my destenye to be misreported, and
condemn'd on the first tale&quot; and his letter to the Earl of Salisbury, where
he said &quot;My noble Lord, they deale not charitably, Who are too witty in
another mans Workes, and utter, some times, theyre owne malicious Meanings,
under o[u]r Wordes.&quot;)

In particular, Jonson made it very clear that he had no use for one of the
very men who had been involved in Marlowe's murder. In epigram CI,
&quot;Inviting a Friend to Supper&quot;
( ), Jonson promised his
friend that:

&quot;Of this we will sup free, but moderately,
And we will have no Pooly', or Parrot by;
Nor shall our Cups make any guilty Men:&quot;

&quot;Pooly&quot; was, of course, Robert Poley, and &quot;Parrot&quot; was another known
informer, Henry Parrot.

And getting back to Drummond, one might wonder why Jonson had voiced no
opinion about Marlowe in sections XI and XII of Drummond's notes, where he
spoke of poets he had known. Most likely, it's because Marlowe was killed
in 1593, and Jonson is not known to have been involved in the theater until
1597 (and hadn't returned from service in Holland until 1592). Jonson had
nothing to say about Marlowe because he had never met him.

It seems to me that your views are significantly impacted by Jonson's
testimony:

1) Jonson thought Shakespeare's work to be inferior to his own, so he had
little cause to lie about it and engage in a plot to keep some hidden
author's work before the public;
2) Jonson denied engaging in Renaissance &quot;trick writing,&quot; which means that
if he had written the epitaph on Shakespeare's monument, there's no reason
to think he would have made it into a riddle;
3) Jonson had personal reason to despise informers, which means that he most
likely would have had little personal regard for Marlowe;
4) Jonson left written evidence that he distrusted Robert Poley. If Poley
had been involved in some sort of plot to keep Marlowe alive, as you
suggest, and Jonson was an active participant in this plot, wouldn't Jonson
have had a better opinion of Poley (and perhaps even had invited him to
supper with his friend)?
5) According to Drummond, Jonson conveyed no recollections of Marlowe, which
most likely means that he never knew the man.

Perhaps you should give Jonson a bit more thought.

I know of no reason for believing Jonson to have had any
connection with this matter other than his role in the
publication of the First Folio. I don't even know if he
knew anything at all about it before this.

Even if he did, however, I see no reason why his opinion of
Shakespeare's plays should have any more - or even as much -
bearing upon his readiness to help than it did upon his
writing the panegyric in the FF.

I have as you say &quot;seemed to imply, on occasion, that perhaps

Despite his words on this subject, however, I do not think it

word puzzles whose sole *raison d'etre* is to *be* a puzzle.
These are trifles. foolish toys, with nothing else to say.
But whether his views would extend to not playing with words

What are you talking about? I have never claimed that

Marlowe). Charles Nicholl, incidentally, claims that Jonson
himself was involved in espionage - The Reckoning (2002)
p.202 - but gives no source for this.

Yes, I am familiar with it. As a matter of fact, I gave
it at our monthly poetry reading only last April. Poley was
better known, I think, for his role as an informer in the
Babington plot, but it seems quite likely that 'Pooly and
Parrot' were the &quot;two damned villains&quot; who had been placed
&quot;to take advantage of him&quot; when he was in prison. Anyway,
there is no reason to think that Jonson knew anything at
all about Poley's connection with the Deptford incident.

As I see things, of course, it is quite possible for the
&quot;grave sir&quot; Jonson is inviting to supper to be Marlowe
himself - hence the promised discretion.

Stick to the point, please, Clark. We are talking about the
poem actually attributed to Jonson in the First Folio. And
there is no &quot;trick writing&quot; of the sort you refer to in that.
All that I would claim is that what he may appear to be
saying is not always what he actually means. For example,
not the river Avon in Warwickshire, but in Wiltshire.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; writing of Shakespeare's plays (despite his personal affection
&gt;&gt; for the man).

&gt; I know of no reason for believing Jonson to have had any
&gt; connection with this matter other than his role in the
&gt; publication of the First Folio. I don't even know if he
&gt; knew anything at all about it before this.

"/>

Surely you're not serious. Jonson had a professional (and most likely
personal) relationship with Shakespeare as actor as early as 1598, when
Shakespeare appeared in Jonson's *Every Man in His Humour* (I can think of
at least two reasons for thinking that Jonson knew Shakespeare personally as
well: 1) the tradition that Shakespeare used his influence to get Jonson's
early plays produced, and 2) Jonson's device of portraying himself as the
anxious author backstage during the performance of his plays--not to mention
his much later claim to have witnessed the negligent performance of The New
Inn, which is proof that he attended the performances of at least some of
his plays). There's evidence that he knew Shakespeare as author by at least
1602, when there's reference to an authorship duel, of sorts, between
Shakespeare and Jonson in *The Return from Paranassus, pt. II*.

Do you seriously think that Jonson knew Shakespeare as actor an author, yet
didn't know until the publication of F1 in 1623 that he hadn't really
written his works?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Even if he did, however, I see no reason why his opinion of
&gt; Shakespeare's plays should have any more - or even as much -
&gt; bearing upon his readiness to help than it did upon his
&gt; writing the panegyric in the FF.

"/>

My premise is that Jonson tossed off panegyrics pretty much at will (no pun
intended), but that his strict adherence to his own personal artistic creed
(or critical theory of drama, if you will) would not have permitted him to
participate in a blatant cover-up of the magnitude you suggest merely to
afford a disgraced and exiled playwright that he considered artistically
inferior an opportunity to have his plays performed before the groundlings
in London. I've given a few reasons for why I think this premise is true,
and am prepared to discuss it further if you can summon the interest.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Where Jonson did have unqualified praise for Shakespeare was
&gt;&gt; in the commendatory verse in the First Folio. But Jonson had

&gt;&lt;snip of examples&gt;

"/>

You've snipped them, but do you acknowledge my point that Jonson was a soft
touch when it came to writing commendatory verse?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Further, you've seemed to imply, on occasion, that perhaps
&gt;&gt; Jonson had written your supposed riddle. Yet we find in
&gt;&gt; one of his comments to Drummond and in his Execration Upon
&gt;&gt; Vulcan that he shunned such things.

&gt; I have as you say &quot;seemed to imply, on occasion, that perhaps
&gt; Jonson had written&quot; it. I haven't a clue whether he did or not.
&gt; Despite his words on this subject, however, I do not think it
&gt; impossible. It seems to me that his antipathy is directed at
&gt; word puzzles whose sole *raison d'etre* is to *be* a puzzle.
&gt; These are trifles. foolish toys, with nothing else to say.
&gt; But whether his views would extend to not playing with words
&gt; as a means of concealing a hidden meaning in a poem in this
&gt; sort of context is far from certain.

"/>

Do you have any evidence that he ever did such a thing in any of his other
works? Not just trifling puzzles, such as Ratcliffe and Celia/Alice, or
plays on words, such as the opening line to his epigram on his first son,
but real hidden meanings that have since been discovered?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In addition, Jonson gives us further reason to doubt your
&gt;&gt; views. Although you may not fall into this category, there
&gt;&gt; are some Marlovians who apparently have some sort of James
&gt;&gt; Bondian fantasies about Marlowe as a super-secret agent
&gt;&gt; working for Her Majesty's Government.

&gt; So argue with them, not me.

&gt;&gt; But if he engaged in such activities at all, there's no
&gt;&gt; reason to think him to have been any more than a simple
&gt;&gt; informer and counterfeiter.

&gt; And there is no reason to think that Jonson had any idea at
&gt; all about *any* role Marlowe played for the Privy Coucil.

"/>

Well, not if Marlowe died in 1593 there isn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Yet Jonson had little reason to involve himself with such
&gt;&gt; a person.

&gt; What are you talking about? I have never claimed that
&gt; Jonson had anything to do with Christopher Marlowe (*qua*
&gt; Marlowe). Charles Nicholl, incidentally, claims that Jonson
&gt; himself was involved in espionage - The Reckoning (2002)
&gt; p.202 - but gives no source for this.

"/>

I had seen that, but it appears to be something of an exaggeration. Jonson
had been a guest at a Catholic dinner party in October 1605. Some of the
other guests were later implicated in the Gunpowder Plot. Some have
inferred from this that Jonson was at the party as either a co-plotter or as
a spy, but there is no evidence that he was either. He was a publicly
avowed Catholic, and had a number of Catholic friends.

What *is* known is that after the Gunpowder Plot was uncovered, Robert Cecil
asked Jonson (presumably because of his Catholic connections) to act as his
agent to contact a priest who had &quot;offered to do good service to the state.&quot;
Jonson tried to reach the priest through the chaplain of the Venetian
ambassador, but the priest could (or would) not be found. Apparently Jonson
tried to contact a few other Catholics-of-interest on Cecil's behalf, and
was similarly unsuccessful.

Despite what Nicholl says, I wouldn't call Jonson's activities for Cecil
&quot;espionage,&quot; nor would I class Jonson as an &quot;informer.&quot; As I mentioned,
Jonson had appealed to Cecil (the Earl of Salisbury) for release from prison
earlier in 1605, and could hardly have refused Cecil's request to act as a
go-between. Further, Jonson's activities on Cecil's behalf were apparently
all above board.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; His time in prison was due to the allegations and slanders
&gt;&gt; of informers (see Jonson's letter from prison in 1605 to
&gt;&gt; the Earl of Suffolk, where he complained that &quot;It hath euer
&gt;&gt; bene my destenye to be misreported, and condemn'd on the
&gt;&gt; first tale&quot; and his letter to the Earl of Salisbury, where
&gt;&gt; he said &quot;My noble Lord, they deale not charitably, Who are
&gt;&gt; too witty in another mans Workes, and utter, some times,
&gt;&gt; theyre owne malicious Meanings, under o[u]r Wordes.&quot;)

&gt;&gt; In particular, Jonson made it very clear that he had no use
&gt;&gt; for one of the very men who had been involved in Marlowe's
&gt;&gt; murder. In epigram CI, &quot;Inviting a Friend to Supper&quot;
&gt;&gt; ( http://hollowaypages.com/jonson1692epigrams.htm#CI ),
&gt;&gt; Jonson promised his friend that:

&gt;&gt;&quot;Of this we will sup free, but moderately,
&gt;&gt; And we will have no Pooly', or Parrot by;
&gt;&gt; Nor shall our Cups make any guilty Men:&quot;

&gt;&gt;&quot;Pooly&quot; was, of course, Robert Poley, and &quot;Parrot&quot; was
&gt;&gt; another known informer, Henry Parrot.

&gt; Yes, I am familiar with it. As a matter of fact, I gave
&gt; it at our monthly poetry reading only last April. Poley was
&gt; better known, I think, for his role as an informer in the
&gt; Babington plot, but it seems quite likely that 'Pooly and
&gt; Parrot' were the &quot;two damned villains&quot; who had been placed
&gt;&quot;to take advantage of him&quot; when he was in prison. Anyway,
&gt; there is no reason to think that Jonson knew anything at
&gt; all about Poley's connection with the Deptford incident.

"/>

There's no reason to think he didn't. Although some of the details were
exaggerated, the circumstances of Marlowe's killing were obviously fairly
well known, and Poley's role as at least a witness was a matter of public
record. There's no reason to believe that theater folk wouldn't have known
who was present at the time of the killing. For example, the fact that
Jonson himself had been convicted of murder for killing an actor was common
knowledge, even though Jonson didn't make a practice of publicizing the
fact.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As I see things, of course, it is quite possible for the
&gt;&quot;grave sir&quot; Jonson is inviting to supper to be Marlowe
&gt; himself - hence the promised discretion.

"/>

I know you're kidding me here. Under your theory, Poley was instrumental in
the subterfuge that was necessary for Kit to avoid the gallows. Poley could
hardly have ordered Marlowe's banishment, so under your theory his actions
in Deptford were solely for Marlowe's benefit; essential for the
preservation of his life. If Marlowe was to have been Jonson's guest, I'd
expect Poley to be seated at the head of the table.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And getting back to Drummond, one might wonder why Jonson
&gt;&gt; had voiced no opinion about Marlowe in sections XI and
&gt;&gt; XII of Drummond's notes, where he spoke of poets he had
&gt;&gt; known. Most likely, it's because Marlowe was killed in
&gt;&gt; 1593, and Jonson is not known to have been involved in
&gt;&gt; the theater until 1597 (and hadn't returned from service
&gt;&gt; in Holland until 1592). Jonson had nothing to say about
&gt;&gt; Marlowe because he had never met him.

&gt; Not as Marlowe, anyway. I don't know where you got the
&gt; idea that he had.

"/>

Perhaps because I don't think that Jonson was quite the ignoramus you
apparently believe him to have been.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It seems to me that your views are significantly impacted
&gt;&gt; by Jonson's testimony:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmmm. I'm sure you'll correct me, but it seems to me that

I am quite serious. By &quot;it&quot; in that last sentence, I of course
mean what you refer to as &quot;the-not-as-dead-as-everyone-thought
Marlowe's use of Shakespeare as a &quot;front&quot;&quot;. It is possible,
for example, for Jonson to have known full well that Shake-
speare had someone else doing most of the writing for him,
without having a clue as to who that someone was.

Don't change the argument, Clark. I said he might not have

that Shakespeare hadn't really written his works.

As we have been discussing only recently on the &quot;Req for
Rec&quot; thread, the First Folio was intended for *reading*, not
performing. More important for my scenario, though, and a
point that you don't seem to have realized, is that it was
*not* good news for Marlowe. This publication effectively
put the lid on any chance he may have had of getting any
public recognition of his role in it during the lifetime of
anyone who was around at that time. IF he disliked Marlowe
as much as you insist, this could have been quite appealing
to Jonson.

&gt;&gt; Jonson knew who wrote the plays and he edited the
&gt;&gt; First Folio but there was never a conspiracy.

&gt; Jonson spoke of the author in the past tense because
&gt; the author was dead.

Jonson was a satirist writing ironically about a dead poser
and a defunct pseudonym. The actor/play broker was dead
and the author had written his last.

&gt; Sir Francis Bacon was alive and

Why would Bacon purchase the (despised) printed book
when he had the unblotted manscripts?

Best,
