I'm sure most of you know the story...The Persians were trying to
impose their rule over the world, and tiny, poor Greece had not
submitted yet. So the Persians invaded, and Greece decided to fight,
and the Spartans, the best warriors in the land were asked to lead the
armies. The Spartans however, feared sending their army far from home,
because of their slave class ( the helots), and other politics going
on, so the Spartan king Leonidas went north anyway with his bodyguard
of 300, to stop the supposedly million man army of Perisan king Xerxes
at a small mountain pass called Thermopylae, the Gates of Fire. He
held for three days until a traitor revealed a path around the pass,
which they used to surround the Spartans ( the other Greek allies
having retreated) and kill them to a man.

Great stuff...

Frank Miller wrote the comic the movie is based off, and if you don't
know Frank Miller, he's the guy who basically ressurrected Batman back
in the 80's from being a lame comic to being at the forefront of the
comic Renaissance of the late 80's-90's. If you saw Batman Begins,
almost all of the material from it is from his Batman Year One series.
He also wrote Sin City, and the last two Robocop movies ( which were
drastically altered with rewrites).

Visually, the film is incredible, having been filmed and then having
the back scenery etc drawn in. This gives the movie a surreal look
which really works. The tones of greys and browns lets the red and
gold of the Spartans stand out, as well as the black and silvers of
the Persian Immortals.

The performances are strong, with Gerard Butler as an excellent
Leonidas. He is able to deliver his lines with a dryness and a matter
of factness that shows the Leonidas was confident without being
reckless, and knew the quality of men he lead, without being arrogant.
David Wenham (Faramir from LOTR) and Vincent Regan (Troy) and the rest
of the Spartans also follow this mode...they know they are good, and
they are confident, and they prove it. The battle sequences are
excellent, showing the skill of the Spartans both in a phalanx and in
individual combats.

I think the only weakness of the film is the subplot back in Sparta,
where the Queen tries to rally the Spartans to send their army to the
north to rally to Leonidas. I think the resolution of it was fast, and
almost seemed thrown in as an afterthought.

I also must warn you that this is more a dramatic movie with action,
then an action movie with some drama. This means that the conclusion
may not be as climatic as it might have been had the story been a work
of fiction, but I am reminded strongly of the ending of Braveheart,
with the Spartan Dilios leading the charge of the Spartan army at
Platea being like the charge of the Scots at Bannockburn...

Overall, the movie rocks. I will probably see it again in the theatres
and will be sure to pick it up on DvD when it first comes out.

postscript: What I think will be amusing is the interpetation that
will be given to the film in light of today's political stage. I have
heard that in Europe people walked out on the film because they were
outraged by the "message", while some people have likened George Bush
to both Leonidas and Xerxes. I don't believe you can make an issue of
the story with today's world....you could do the same with Lord of the
Rings and many other tales.

One thing that really bothered me in the trailers was the...
inhuman... look of some of what I assume were the Persians.  I wonder
if this is what the Europeans were being bothered by?

The visual style and the look of those... people... really put off my
wife, so she isn't going to want to see it which means I probably
won't see it.

I'm kind of torn, as this is one of the best war stories in history
(and I've often wondered why it hasn't been handled before in film),
but the take on it looks like it's probably going to spoil my
suspension of disbelief.

I'm sure the history channel's rip-off of it will be good though,
being more accurate and believable.  (Yes I know there's no
announcement of this, but they always seem to do a historical show to
cash in on any popular movie).

They did the story excellent justice, and I saved $9.50 US plus popcorn

Unfortunate that some would attach a political/social message. It's a
dramatic treatement of historical events, and should be taken as such.
As for Bush...Leonides is supposed to be a hero, right? Now, if this
was a film starring Bozo the Clown... ;) (no offense to Bozo or his

A friend who saw it (and loved it, but said it's *bloody*) indicated that

I watched it last night. Other than a very similar visual style (probably

I figured that 300's politics track closely to those of Heinlein: honour (of
men and women), duty (of ditto), the state as equivalent to society, and the
soldier as the rightful primary caste of the state. Mind you, Heinlein owed
much of his politics to his study of the classics. Full circle.

300 doesn't follow the politics of any party in any modern democracy I know
of; not since Theodore Roosevelt anyway. There are individuals in both
parties who might understand 300; Jim Webb and John McCain come to mind in
the Senate.

I had some major problems with this movie.

-Two of the evil emissaries of the Great King were subSaharan African.
Cambyses, a few decades prior, had been thrown right OUT of Nubia and lost
his life soon after (murder? madness?). Those emissaries gave the movie too
much of a "white power" expression. If the Great King's messengers had to be
exotic, then they should have been high-caste Indian or Central Asian; if
the movie required Africans, then they should have been sneaking gold to the
anti-Persian Greeks.

-The Spartan regime was whitewashed far too much. Steven "Gates of Fire"
Pressfield was able to show warts-n-all; what can't Miller and Snyder?

-The Spartan allies were almost ignored. By now I've grown wearily used to
stories about the "300" which ignore the other 700 Thespians. But editing
Themistocles and all his Athenians out of the Battle of Artemision - which
is a storm in the movie - was just stupid. What if we had a battle and
nobody showed up, indeed. Again, Pressfield was able to keep the focus on
the 300 while giving the others credit where it was due.

-That trope about the Spartans (rather than Athenians and Ionians) fighting
for "reason" against Eastern obscurantism was anachronistic enough the first
time it came up. It became an absolute joke after the Persians brought in
some sparkly firecrackers to launch against the Spartan shields, and the
narrator described it as "sorcery". When they release this movie in China
they are going to fit those scenes with a laugh track.

The movie was pretty to look at, and I suppose we have to start somewhere if
we are to educate our generation in why Thermopylae, and the ancient Greeks
in general, matter to us. But it could have been done so much better.

">

Slightly suspect, because this information is something I'm remembering
from seminary 12 years ago affiliated with a church whose founder
mispronounced "El Niño" in such a way as to make it rhyme with "El
Minnow", but...

You can probably include Iraq in the 'propaganda.' Persia included a
significant portion of Iraq. The majority of Iraq and a small part of
Iran was known as Media. Persia was to Media what Mercedes was to Benz.
Babylon was the capital of the combined empire and it was located at
roughly the location of modern Baghdad.

Greece was always sensitive about getting their arse handed to them by
the Persians. It took them over 100 years to get even and then it took a
Macedonian to conquer them and his son to drag them into battle to get
even. It didn't take long for the whole thing to fall apart after the
ambitious young leader died. The stigma of defeat remains while the
accomplishments are robbed by the fact that world conquest is no longer
fashionable. It's nice to be remembered for inventing democracy and a
few good foods.

I think it's a stretch to cast the US as the Spartans and the traitors
as our NATO allies. The US wasn't exactly dragged kicking and screaming
into an invasion and our elite troops are comprised of our slave caste.
If you doubt it then compare the number of recruiters per capita in
Scottsdale, AZ to the number in the west valley. (I was going to use
Beverly Hills and Compton, but that would have resulted in an
unnecessary tangent.)

There might be a slightly better case for casting the US as invaders and
middle eastern allies as traitors, but I doubt even Michael Moore would
bother with such a flimsy indictment of Bush's foreign policy. A remake
of "Lawrence of Arabia" could do a much more thorough job of it.

It's a historical drama, but it's being sold as an action film. It would
probably be a mistake to read much more into it than that. The special
effects aren't going to hold Europeans the way they do with Americans,
though in other areas they are more sensitive to what happens behind the
camera. If the plot was thin or the direction was poor then the graphic
novel backdrop would have been viewed as a flimsy gimic rather than as a
true innovation.

&gt; Slave caste?

Wage slaves and the working poor, many of which are descendants of
slaves of the regular variety. It's a common contention among civil
rights advocates that military recruiting focuses disproportionately on
minorities and the lower class.

My reasoning is that those who would want to make that comparison would
not enjoy the places where the analogy fails. I am not interested in
another flame thread at this point.

If you think this film, and the History Channel documentary, are not
tied to the current "political climate", you haven't been keeping
track of Hollywood's record of muslim bashing.

Believe what you will, but the "liberal" movie industry is firmly in
tow with our president's perversion of the "war on terror".

Inquisitive people should wonder why.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The History channel documentary, if you watched it at all, you

Yes, I watched parts of the documentary, and I do not remember any
continuing reference to the movie as opposed to the facts.  Even if
the movie was mentioned at the beginning, that negates your argument.

As for anything else in your "reply" worth rebuttal...well...lol.

Your point is well taken, but Hollywood sets what we consider "in".

Re the History Channel, I saw many anti-Saddam spots leading up to the
Iraq war.  What about the recent "Iran: the next Iraq?" documentary
(which left me with a feeling of being brainwashed).  What about the
dozens of Hitler pieces.  Face it, Hollywood supports everything
Israeli, and that means more terrorist and Nazi productions.

Iran has had the Persian persona as a shield against bigotry.  They're

1) The word "deserved" is an opinion statement, not a statement of fact.
It's my opinion that Bush *Senior* was 10 years too late. I see
preventing genocide and protecting the national sovereignty of other
nations as the only moral reasons to wage war. I doubt the national
sovereignty of Kuwait was anything other than the pretense under which a
Texas family with strong Saudi ties contrived to elevate oil prices. I
have many opinions, some of which are more defensible than others.

2) I find the History Channel to be topical and balanced. History lends
itself well to objective treatment. Source material and events presented
in good faith are not inherently "anti-" or "pro-" anything. Critical
thinking should be the responsibility of the viewer. That is my opinion.

3) What is your source? I'll be interested in viewing the commentaries
when the DVD comes out. I don't doubt that it's just an action flick
without any additional agenda. That's the way it's being sold, at least.
The fact that it has a historical basis makes comparisons inevitable,
whether those comparisons are appropriate or intentional... or not.

4) Ad hominem attacks are unbecoming.

No, they don't.

If they did, the words "Ishtar" and "Cutthroat Island" would not
strike fear into the hearts of producers everywhere.

The public sets what it considers "in". And they're notoriously
fickle and hard to predict. Star Wars was expected to be at best a
very moderate success; instead it changed the face of cinema. There
are a number of other examples.

Hollywood is a very conservative business arena -- not in the
political, but in the practical, sense. They go with what's ALREADY
proven, with what they've done before, and with whatever is already
hot. Every once in a while they let someone take a little chance. If
that chance fails, NO ONE takes chances for quite a while. If it
succeeds, that success has a hundred imitators.

Since we're on a RPG group, connected with SF/F, a very apropos way
to see this is to notice that there is not ONE SINGLE FILM  that I can
think of which has shown a significant fantasy or SF concept that
wasn't done -- and generally done to death -- in print ten, twenty, or
even forty years earlier. There are new IMAGES, of course, and some
neat changes of presentation, but the basic IDEAS that make it in
Hollywood are ones that have already been proven.

Hollywood does not set anything; it FOLLOWS.

*WE* support the Israelis ("we" being the USA) as a general rule,
since 1) we helped set up their government years ago, 2)They've been a
(generally) reliable ally since that time, 3)They haven't tried to
bomb us, take our journalists hostage, or otherwise make themselves
obvious targets.

For Hollywood, this means that the Israelis are just about the only
reliably established sympathetic presence in the Middle East.

Insofar as "300", you are just completely missing the point. There
**ISN'T** any political element here. This is a much more primal,
elemental story, one that resonates especially well with Americans,
whose culture still derives to a great extent from British traditions
(despite all the multicultural imports).

This is a simple story of one tiny group of warriors taking on an
entire army, and Damn Near Beating Them All. This is Rourke's Drift.
This is the Charge of the Light Brigade. The fact that many components
are drawn from actual history just make it that much better. Note, I
haven't seen the film yet, and probably won't until it comes out on
DVD. However, the basic story is well-known and the appeal is a very
simple one that hasn't a single political bone in its body. If the
film were MODERN DAY, and the opponents were EEeeevil Muslim Hordes
and the good guys a small group of American or Israeli SOF, yeah, you
might have a political element. But insofar as the sides are
concerned, that's just plain history.

Now, it may have been MADE now because they're hoping to cash in on
some of the pro-war sentiment, but if so the timing is a bit off; the
pro-war movement has been dwindling noticeably for the past couple  years.

Or are you just a anti-Jew loon/troll? (note: I'm neither Jewish nor
Christian nor Muslim, nor do I care which one someone else is)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Taste vary, I suppose. The visual look of the ads is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; reason I won't be bothering with it in the theater. Looks too
&gt;&gt;&gt; comic-booky to me. The rest of your review inclines me to
&gt;&gt;&gt; catch it on DVD, so long as somebody else buys it.

&gt; That's why I will probably like it. The comic book look, not

Either is a perfectly good reason. Both would be even better. Cake

I don't see anything with which to replace peer review, but it has its
problems, like the occasional cadre of backstabbers who reject papers from the
competition.  Plus, it's fair to wonder how much researchers (and therefore
reviewers) are influenced by their funders' outlook.

I've always been partial to Thera (old name).  It's kind of neat to stand at
the top of the cliff and look way, way out to see the remains of the other
side of the caldera.

Then there's Orson Scott Card's intriguing fiction in Pastwatch where
Atlantis' flooding was "really" caused the breaking of a land bridge in the
south end of the red sea at the end of the last ice age.

Largely speaking, they aren't. The current funding model overly
promotes consensus and can't handle high risk or unknown goals well, but
it doesn't seem to produce anything objectively false until the PR guys
get their hands on it.
The news stories that purport to educate the masses on scientific
