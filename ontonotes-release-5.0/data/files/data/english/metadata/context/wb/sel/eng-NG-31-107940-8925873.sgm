Why doesn't Bose have MP3/cellphone hookup in their headsets?

Seems very strange to me that a company most noted for their consumer
audio products would make a headset that doesn't have a plug to allow
your to hook in your iPod/MP3 player or cellphone.

I bought a pair of the Bose X and just assumed that would be there...
what a disappointment.

Oh, and as a relatively new IFR pilot you should see some utility in the

either buy the headset or not. If it does not suit your needs then choose
something else -  whets the problem? If you bought the wrong thing more fool
you. It is not difficult to find out what the headset does or does not. The
Bose site has all the info as well as the operating manual for the headset.

Also, Bose aims their products at the &quot;pros&quot; who are usually engaged in CRM
during flight, not entertainment.

Also, Bose being more expensive, it's more typically used by people what
have MP3 and cell phone capable audio panels. If they added capability to
attach toys, first they would have redundancy that was wasted on their
target market. Secondly, there would be that many more people whining that
Bose was even MORE expensive.

There are an awful lot of Bose ads in the &quot;hobby flyer&quot; magazines that seem to
counter your statement. Also, I have not yet seen a Bose in any airline

You seem to be opposed to the idea of listening to music in-flight. That's ok,

We use Bose in the KC-135 all the time. It is an option versus the non ANR

Bose win hands down.

You won't find Bose in many cockpits in which the engines/props are a
significant distance behind the pilot. Those (jet jockeys and the like)
don't need a lot of noise reduction like piston poppers and turboprops do.

Yeah, but Thomas would say that the KC-135 is not an airliner, or that

We use our lightspeed music/cell input all the time.  It is truly
wonderful to be able to make a call as soon as you land, simply by
dialing the phone and listening/talking through your headset.  The
clarity is remarkable, and the convenience is hard to beat.

I've been watching this thread with amazement since it began.  I can't
believe there are people out there who are defending Bose for selling
a headset -- for $1000! -- without including this most basic
feature.   IMHO it's like selling a GPS with a black-and-white screen
nowadays.  Sure, it works, but why would anyone want to do without
color?

It appears to be by the connectors, but I've never used it with music,
only for cell phone clearance pickups.   I don't fly with music.  My
wife, who has actually listened to music with it, likes it, but can't
remember if it's stereo (she doesn't really know what that stereo
means vs. &quot;not&quot; stereo).

I think Sporty's has a generous return policy.  &lt;G&gt;

I guess their stupid marketing people have missed something on their way to

Its quite simple. if you want a Bose buy a Bose. If you want something to
plug everything else into buy something else.

I don't see what the problem is. Bose is clear what they offer.

We have one moron buying a headset without checking out whether it would do
what he wanted and we end up with the second most stupid thread for weeks.

The first most stupid thread is on bicycles.

Actually, I paid ~ $900 overall for mine, which also included a 30
day, guilt and game-free test period.  During my 30 day test, I got to
use the set lots, in all kinds of conditions.  Also during the same
test, I loaned them out, which resulted in a second sale for Bose.

I sold the &quot;freebie come-on&quot; I got with mine for $62 on eBay, and I
calculated the 0% financing opportunity cost and free shipping to be ~
$35-40.

FWIW, the $100 interface gets much more use plugged into my old $400+
headset, for my wife to listen to calming music, than it the two or
three phone calls a year I make with it.  Even if my Bose X had an
aux. interface, I'd still need the extra $100 unit for her.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;No, not a shame, ridiculous.
">

I think the reason for a lack of an input is that the Bose X is a
slightly older design, released before the current models with the aux
input.  If the input is as big a deal as some make it out to be, sales
would drop off enough for Bose to add the feature.  Since they haven't
bothered, I can only imagine that the missing feature hasn't been a
big deal.

My headset replaced a top of the line set from another well-known
headset maker.  Many flying hours later, I'd buy the Bose again.  I
don't really care who else uses what I use, and hope they buy what
best suits them and fly safe and happy!

Right.  Bose sells more headsets on the consumer market in a week than
they sell Xs to pilots in a year.

THAT is the real reason they cost a grand, and they haven't updated
the design to include modern features.  They've run the numbers and
realized that it just isn't worth it.

(BTW: I feel the same when I pay almost $500 for a Lightspeed ANR
headset that I *know* is worth $100.  But, hey, at least I've got a
cell phone jack...)

I have a Bose X, Lightspeed Thirty 3G, a Clarity Aloft (in ear) and a Telex
Stratus in the 310.  All but the Bose have aux input....but the Bose is
&quot;MINE&quot;!  I'd buy a second Bose but the wife likes the Lightspeed.  For me
the Bose is the best (comfort &amp; what's filtered out), with the Clarity Aloft
my second choice (and it's not even ANR).  I borrowed a Bose from a friend
and new it didnt have an aux input.....but bought one anyway.  To be honest
I will try a Zulu later and hope I like it better than the Bose.

Yep, that's penciled into my plans for SNF '08 or OSH '08.  The Zulu
appears to have addressed the issues that people have with the
Lightspeed 3G line (basically a cosmetic thing about the ear-cups
being too big) by essentially copying the sleeker Bose design, while
retaining all the great things Lightspeed always includes.

I can't remember, does the Bose X have a built-in bass &amp; treble
control?
