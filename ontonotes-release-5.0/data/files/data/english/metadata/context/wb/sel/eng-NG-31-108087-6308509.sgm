Had my first CA road rage or idiot episode in maybe 40 years.

Seems I was tailgated by some pickup dirver. At the fourth signal he butts
the back of the bike and begins laughing.  Not a bad bump so I let it pass.

On the freeeway here he comes again.  Tries to do the "jerky-swerve" thing
like he was gonna run me off the road (I kept my line).

Then he shoots on ahead and then cuts me off with maybe 3 feet of room.  I
decided to pass and took it up to over 120 mph and was out of there.

In retrospect I should have tried to get his plate number and turn it in
immediatley via the cell phone to 911.  Just that his plate was bent to hell
along with his hood probably from rear ending others.

No damage done to the GT bike (Thank God!).  I feel like filing a police
report, but don't know if it would do any good since I don't have a plate
number.  I've read where the California DMV can make filing against careless
driver's easier - just never done it before.

Anyone try this tactic?  (I felt like unloading a Glock into the POS but the
stupid CA laws forbid it).

When some shit tries to fuck with me like that, I make it SOP to jam on

I've done that. The cops don't care. If one of them didn't see it, they
won't arrest someone for it. They'll just tell you to pull off the road
and let the person pass. I did once report some fucks in a white Acura

If you're in a situation where you can safely pilot your motorcycle and
aim a pistol at another moving vehicle, then you're not in the kind of
danger that justifies shooting them. Besides, cops have reserved that
activity exclusively for themselves. They will not like you very much.

Since I was in the middle lane of some rush hour traffic mess, I couldn't
see getting off the bike at that moment.  No doubt if I did, the onlookers
would tell the cops "I didn't see nothing.  Don't know why the biker got off
the bike &lt;and punched the guy&gt;" etc. etc.

When it happens to you, a whole lot of crap fills your head in short order.
Just that you aren't capable of launching an effective offense on a bike
against a cager.  Heck, he could have pushed it over once I was off it and
just said "Opps.  I have no insurance!" (like 40% of Californians).

Maybe the best bet is to get the plate number, pull off the road, and file a
"Hit and run" with the cops via 911.  Let them chase the SOB.  Only drawback
is there is no visible damage to the bike.

Beware of old POS vehicles!  Another dent won't hurt them.

That's the portion I'm having problems with.  Do you drop the stand in the
middle of rush hour traffic?  I doubt if anyone around will stay to confirm
the strike.  It's a no-win situation since he could always strike the bike
and knock it over (BMW's don't like to fall down and go Boom! unless you'v
got several thousand dollars lying around for pieces).

Good point.  Never had this crap happen before.  I just need to prepare for
the next time.

Once on the freeway it was easy.  Just didn't plan on the jerk showing up
again.  In town it was a mess.

That's what I figured their response would be.  I'm sure if I had a badge
all hell would break loose on the guy's ass.  I would be tempted to say "If
you can't help me here, I guess I'll write to Commissioner Mike Brown in
Sacramento" to get them off their lazy dead asses.  I did this once with the
head of the DMV on some dumb smog hold up on car registration and it worked.
Even got a call from Sac DVM and an apology on the phone!

In retrospect, I've never have had an issue when I've been on the Harley.
Seems like all the crap starts when I'm on the BMW.  I don't know what it
is, but I've gotten yelled at by some clowns "Should'a bought a Harley!"
(Gad, also in a PU!) while looking at my map on the BMW tankbag while
stopped (like I was broken down).  I've been pressed to race people in
pickups (again!) in canyons on the BMW (tailgaters pushing you to twist it
out).  One guy did stop at an off ramp when I pulled over to allow him to
pass.  He apologized after he flagged me down saying "he was a race driver
and wanted to know how fast we were going in the canyon." Interesting.

May be some sort of envy, "He's got a BMW and I got this POS truck."  Might
be some testosterone thing among PU drivers.  Don't know.  Seems it is a
"size" thing (SUV verses compact, etc).

&gt;along with his hood probably from rear ending others.

&gt;No damage done to the GT bike (Thank God!).  I feel like filing a police
&gt;report, but don't know if it would do any good since I don't have a plate
&gt;number.  I've read where the California DMV can make filing against careless
&gt;driver's easier - just never done it before.

&gt;Anyone try this tactic?  (I felt like unloading a Glock into the POS but the

The fact that the guy wasn't finished with you after the initial
tail-gating phase supports the strategy of pulling over and stopping.

Good point. We riders have NO rights or chance against a crazed manic,
driving a 4000 Lb cage. He'd just as soon run you down and leave you to die.

This is true in this case.  The fact that this fellow was willing to hit
the OP's bike and then pretend to swerve into his lane was indicative that
he had no consideration for the OP's life.

Given that, anything which might escalate the confrontation would be a bad
idea from the get go.

1. Get off the bike at the light?  Maybe he runs over your bike while
you're off it then drives off.

2. Throw crap at his windshield?  Maybe he manages to catch you up (if you
can't get out of the way) and hits you while moving.  Or maybe he loses
control and crashes into a nearby car, killing somebody else.

Best bet given no damage...get as far away as possible as soon as you can.
Whether that means speeding up or slowing down is situationally dependent,
but don't hang around for round two, whatever that is.

It's amazing how quickly people will get out of the way once they
realize that you are human. A couple of times now, in various merges, I
was signaling but some goit just wouldn't open space. When I make the
now illegal hand sign for left turn, it was as though a light came on in
their head ... and they backed off. (The other week it was  BMW driver
who wanted to pass me on the left during the merge onto a bridge after
tollbooths. He acted like he was angry at me or something. Deliberately
or otherwise, I think he just didn't see me before I made the hand
signal.

&gt; &gt; WTF! There's no fucking excuse for anyone in a cage to ever get
&gt; &gt; within a couple of feet of you. There's no second chances with
&gt; &gt; that!

&gt; That's the portion I'm having problems with.  Do you drop the stand
&gt; in the middle of rush hour traffic?  I doubt if anyone around will
&gt; stay to confirm the strike.  It's a no-win situation since he could
&gt; always strike the bike and knock it over (BMW's don't like to fall
&gt; down and go Boom! unless you'v got several thousand dollars lying
&gt; around for pieces).
">

It depends on the situation. If it's at a red light or in slow traffic,
maybe. But after the first time, you either put a lot of distance
between you and him, or you let him put a lot of distance between you
and him.

&gt; Good point.  Never had this crap happen before.  I just need to

&gt; &gt; I've done that. The cops don't care. If one of them didn't see it,
&gt; &gt; they won't arrest someone for it. They'll just tell you to pull off
&gt; &gt; the road and let the person pass. I did once report some fucks in a
&gt; &gt; white Acura who pulled similar shit with me ... license plate and
&gt; &gt; all. The CHP didn't want it because they threw the rock at my car
&gt; &gt; on an offramp ... and then said that if I pressed charges, the
&gt; &gt; offenders would know who I was and might retaliate.

&gt; That's what I figured their response would be.  I'm sure if I had a

&gt; tempted to say &quot;If you can't help me here, I guess I'll write to
&gt; Commissioner Mike Brown in Sacramento&quot; to get them off their lazy

What kind of a BMW? I ride an R1100GS. I've got those extra red
taillights and a bar of red LEDs under the license place. All taillights
are wired into the brake light modulator, so there's no excuse for
SMIDSY. I bought two strips of that red and white reflective tape you
now see on all the big rigs and put them on my System cases (parallel to
the crease, white in front, red in back). In front I have a pair of
big-ass PIAA aux headlights, high/low, which I run bright all the time
during the day. (The other day I was running lows, and some goit who had
been ahead of me slowed down and then started a lazy-ass right lane
change. I would much rather have annoyed him and have been remembered!)

When I ride a smaller bike, it seems people get closer than I like, more
often.

True.

Never had that happen before.  Just trying to  "plan"  for the next time.

Getting off the bike will attract witnesses, but at that point it will
appear to them you were instigating something towards the driver (unless
they saw the bumper tag which I doubt).  If he was was loony and packing

Gun it on out of there seems to be the best option.

I thought something like this, too.  My experience is that that most cagers
are nominally acceptable drivers, a significant number of them are inattentive,

It's difficult to tell which are which while riding however, so they all get my

Well, let us see, now.  I have once today been guilty of taking you

my geniality.  If this is the case, then I would remind you that
your own cordiality was demonstrated when you accused Beav of being

the other hand, you are on this occasion being genuine, then I thank
you very much, sir, and hope that the pleasure of this evening is

Why, thank you, sir. I hope your week goes well, as well.
I'm riding to Las Vegas, on Friday. You see, I am in muffler hell and hope
to be risen from the depths of despair by Tony at Harley Davidson of Las
Vegas. For I have created a roaring uncontrollable monster, who cries out at
unearthly decibels, unless bound and gagged with a decrease of HP from 100
to 80. (This is not to be confused with handlebar hell or saddle hell). I
also hope to partake in one of my favorite (albeit sometimes costly)
pastimes, single and double deck Blackjack.

But, dear sir, I must admit my comment regarding your geniality was made in
sarcasm.

And, alas, I am genuinely guilty of accusing many of my brothers, at Reeky,
of being delusional, misguided and imbecilic. Not excluding myself.
Beav is a favorite target. For he rides in excess of 100 MPH on a daily
basis and admits that he rides like a twat. I am concerned for his safety.

Sincerely,

Uh-huh. Never heard about the Middle Ages or the Inquisition? (Or are you
simply so dense that you think it couldn't happen today?)

Well, here's the bad news: any religion that claims to have an exclusive
corner on *THE TRUTH* is not only capable of, but is intrinsically organized
to place people into two, and only two, categories: (a) believers, who are
"saved" and (b) non-believers, who are *not* saved, and are therefore
considered slightly sub-human when it comes right down to the crunch.

If you truly believe otherwise, then we know why you hadn't heard of the
Inquisition: you slept through your history classes.

&gt; Hey Woof,

&gt; What hand signals are illegal now?
">

Left turn, right turn, braking.

I read someplace that this stupid law recently came into being in CA.
Let me look this up.

22110.  (a) The signals required by this chapter shall be given by
signal lamp, unless a vehicle is not required to be and is not
equipped with turn signals.  Drivers of vehicles not required to be
and not equipped with turn signals shall give a hand and arm signal
when required by this chapter.
(b) In the event the signal lamps become inoperable while driving,
hand and arm signals shall be used in the manner required in this
chapter.

22111.  All required signals given by hand and arm shall be given
from the left side of a vehicle in the following manner:
(a) Left turn--hand and arm extended horizontally beyond the side
of the vehicle.
(b) Right turn--hand and arm extended upward beyond the side of
the vehicle, except that a bicyclist may extend the right hand and
arm horizontally to the right side of the bicycle.
(c) Stop or sudden decrease of speed signal--hand and arm extended
downward beyond the side of the vehicle.

Hmmm. I distinctly recall reading that hand signals are now illegal, but
I can't find the cite on the CA law page. Good.

But I look at it this way: cops don't ticket anyone for not using turn
signals. If some goit isn't letting me onto a freeway when I am
signaling with the light, and then does when I signal with my hand, a
sane cop will pull over the goit and not me.

Actually, I believe it was more of an incident than an accident.  His
behavior after the fact proved it was no accident - more likely intentional.
I still don't know about pulling over (this was the middle lane of a very
busy main street with a signal every block).  If you get off the bike at
that instant, you will be perceived by others around as the perp if they had
not seen the strike.  He could say "What's your problem?" and could have
driven off with typical lack of insurance excuse or whatever.  With no
supporting dents or scratches I would have a hard time trying to prove a hit
and run (as much as I would have liked to).

As mentioned you really want to find out if he is carrying heat as well?
His laughing left me the feeling this guy was nuts.  This town has a
shooting every night and a lot are random drive-bys.  If you have a black
car at night near one section of town, you are almost guaranteed to get shot
at.  Friend had his windows shot out while sitting at a traffic light in the
section the cops told him not to go to (after the fact).  He floored it, ran
the signal, and got out of there.  You should have seen the glass mess on
the floorboards.

Fast forward....
Sitting around watching some dumbest videos show, there are these kids
throwing rocks at vehicles on the highway from the bushes.  The dummies
video taped themselves even to the point of saying "We're not going home
until we break a windshield."  The video put them into state lockup for 5
years - not even a jury trial as the court had their video as evidence.

Maybe I need a handy ever-ready video camera like this one on a lanyard:
http://tinyurl.com/teqk7 Cell phone camera isn't so hot on video quality
and not quick enough to activate.  If this camera is one click video, it
might come in handy enough to at least get a plate number.  Memory isn't so
hot anymore and reading a dangling plate backwards in the mirror isn't easy.

Watch out for those idiots....

Well duh!

This is why Smith &amp; Wesson developed the .44 Magnum.  A Glock may hold
more ammo.  You may have gotten a .40 S&amp;W or even a .45 ACP.  But
neither of those will give you the truck stopping power of a .44
Magnum.

Of course there are those who say the .454 Casull or S&amp;W .50X are more
suitable for trucks.  I would agree if those trucks said "Peterbilt"
or "Kenworth" on the hood.

Next time though, take the plate if you can and call the fucking po po
and press charges for attempted murder.

&gt; I've done that. The cops don't care. If one of them didn't see it, they

&gt; and let the person pass. I did once report some fucks in a white Acura
&gt; who pulled similar shit with me ... license plate and all. The CHP
&gt; didn't want it because they threw the rock at my car on an offramp ...
&gt; and then said that if I pressed charges, the offenders would know who I

Well shit.  Knowing that I think I will just go straight to the .44
Magnum trumps a lawyer solution.  If the CHP aren't going to do their
fucking jobs of "protect and serve" then they will get vigilante
justice instead.

Sorry for the language, but ramming another vehicle intentionally is
assault with a deadly weapon and survival is a DNA programmed
imperative.

&gt; The best thing would be video tape of the guy doing that. But we don't

My 629 cost less than $800 by a wide margin.  I think front and rear
view cameras with digital recorders are going to cost more.

&gt; If you're in a situation where you can safely pilot your motorcycle and
&gt; aim a pistol at another moving vehicle, then you're not in the kind of
&gt; danger that justifies shooting them. Besides, cops have reserved that
&gt; activity exclusively for themselves. They will not like you very much.
">

I agree that shooting while riding is near impossible.  You can aim a
gun or aim a bike but not both.

However, if the police have already abdicated there responsibility by
not following up on a legitimate complaint, then they can dislike you
all they want.  A LSWC through the radiator into the engine block will
be so messed up that getting any kind of ballistics match will be
impossible.

You can probably tell that I'm rather pissed off at the idea that a
car would deliberatly attempt to run a bike off the road, can't you?
I guess that's because it happened to me on a bicycle as a kid.  Only
then all I could do was get the hell off the road (a rural route) and
hide.  Thank you GCA of 1968!

Of course if you choose to use a firearm on the highway, you damn well
better be ready for the consequences.

I advocate peace and good will towards all.

;-)

I prefer the stopping power of dual Brembos.
