Which god?

And by &quot;believe in&quot; do you mean
&quot;Embrace a value system&quot; e.g. &quot;I believe in democracy&quot;.
Or
&quot;I believe X is true&quot;, e.g. &quot;I don't believe in Santa Claus&quot;.

In re the title: No, I believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I agree that there is one logical answer.

There have been thousands gods worshipped by humans throughout
history. I think that Hindus alone posit billions of gods. The odds
against choosing the right one is staggering.

We know that the human mind is capable of imagining beings that do not
exist. An imaginary being can only communicate with us when the
imagination is a key element. (A hurricane is a message that we
shouldn't tolerate homosexuals or vote Democratic or that we should
worship Allah, depending on whose imagination you listen to.) A real
omnipotent being could communicate with us clearly, directly, and
unambiguously, making ancient texts merely a history rather than a
grand source of religiousity. This makes all the major religious
concepts of God completely consistent with an imaginary being. Of
course, a real omnipotent being could choose to communicate through
imagination and ancient texts but then God would be pretending to be
imaginary.

So, either God is actually imaginary or He pretends to be something He
is not. So if He exists and claims that He will give everlasting life
to all who believe in Him, He actually means that He will give
everlasting life to those who do not believe in Him.

If I am right, I will live forever. If I am wrong, my brief existance
will have been one of intellectual integrity and I will have lost
nothing.

Therefore, it is logical to answer the question with a &quot;No&quot;.

Q.E.D.

I don't believe in any gods.

That is, I do not believe that any entity described as a god has the
attributes of a god, usually considered supernatural.  People may have
more-or-less treated the sun as a god and I believe the sun exists and
our standard of living depends on its vagaries, but I believe it isn't
a god.  There are other similar examples.

You can't use &quot;odds&quot; and &quot;attatch&quot; some guiding function, where
evolution is concerned, and use &quot;pure odds&quot; when it suits you.

I think it's common sense that blowing people up becouse they don't
share your view is a no-no. That narrows the options down
considerebally in one fail swoop.

Either way, you end up with an all powerful being. If evolution is
correct, heres what happens.

Because the universe is so big, and at the same time the universe is
so small (looking from out in) evolution will evolve beings like us,
who will accellerate their own evolution and become godlike,
eventually (like monopoly) someone gets the upper hand and becomes all
powerful. (It might even be you, if you learn to extend your own
life).

If evolution is incorrect, then some all powerful being created us
anyway. The &quot;get out of infinite regress card&quot; that John likes to
play, is as useful as the &quot;get out of infinite regress card&quot; that
applies to energy. Where did all the energy come from?.

If you are wrong, you better make your case pretty damn air tight.
If it isn't it doesn't hurt to keep an open mind, that way if it is a
dillusion
you will have lost nothing and you can die in peace.

If you are right, you have lost everything, and die anyway. Either way
you will die knowing you are
going to oblivion, and that's the end of you.

Therefore, it is logical to answer the question with a &quot;Yes&quot;.

I believe there was a Flying Spaghetti Monster who emitted a pasta
burp. This burp wanted to see a reflection of itself and from this
reflection emerged an imperfect ectypal furball. This primordial
furball eventually gave rise to Maeve the Demiurgic Cat who in an
eternally recurrent manner recreates the catverse we live in every
Thursday (this cycle started Last Thursday). This is so she can
harvest our cat turd souls and fertilize her catnip garden.

The Flying Spaghetti Monster is aloof from the imperfect and evil
creation.

The best thing to do is live a life of austerity and chastity to
reduce the amount of material evil in Maeve's Catverse. If you opt not
to have kids you might help break the samsaric cycle of this vale of
tears. Or go Buddha's route and try nirvana.

I don't believe in anything that does not have valid evidence to back
its existence up (and anecdotal evidence is not valid evidence),
therefore I do not believe in any of the myriad god/desses mankind has

There are many logical answers, not just one. And at least some
in Christendom believe in God because it is absurd to believe.

I'm a Christian, so I believe in God. However, this belief is
tempered with doubt (I am Thomas, after all), and an
unwillingness to claim that what I believe is the only right way
to believe. Or that not believing in God or god or gods is wrong.

What I *do* believe in, absolutely, is that whenever the football
announcer mentions that Brett Favre has not thrown an
interception in x number of quarters, the very next Favre pass
will fall into the hands of a player not wearing Green and Gold.

That's absolutely true. I believe it without doubt or mental
reservation.

Some questions cannot be answered with a yes or no, without the risk
of misleading, being misunderstood, or being misrepresented.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; There have been thousands gods worshipped by humans throughout
&gt; &gt; history. I think that Hindus alone posit billions of gods. The odds
&gt; &gt; against choosing the right one is staggering.

&gt; You can't use &quot;odds&quot; and &quot;attatch&quot; some guiding function, where
&gt; evolution is concerned, and use &quot;pure odds&quot; when it suits you.
">

This displays nicely your empirical nihilism. You apply odds depending
on the situation. Darwin, for example, did not need much math to
arrive at his insights. Einstein did. Both brilliant minds, and each
using the tools appropriate to their area of investigation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think it's common sense that blowing people up becouse they don't
&gt; share your view is a no-no. That narrows the options down
&gt; considerebally in one fail swoop.
">

I concur. We shouldn't blow up - or otherwise kill - people because
they disagree with us. Should we punish people because of the crimes
committed by their ancestors?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Of  course, a real omnipotent being could choose to communicate through
&gt; &gt; imagination and ancient texts but then God would be pretending to be
&gt; &gt; imaginary.

Pretend to be imaginary?
He succeeded!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; So, either God is actually imaginary or He pretends to be something He

&gt; &gt; everlasting life to those who do not believe in Him.

&gt; Don't follow that one.

I concur, there are other possible consequences, given that premiss.

He is either right or wrong, therefore God?

&gt; If evolution is

&gt; Because the universe is so big, and at the same time the universe is

&gt; eventually (like monopoly) someone gets the upper hand and becomes all

False dichotomy. There are other explanations. As far as I know, no

Sometimes the correct answer is &quot;We don't know.&quot;

Or you could just accept whatever superstitions your family has handy,
and which gives you warm fuzzies. You can deny reality, desperately
try to convert others, and try your darndest to convince yourself that
you believe your mythology.

How worried are you that God prefers his name to be pronounced Allah,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Therefore, it is logical to answer the question with a &quot;Yes&quot;.

It is not honest to answer yes if you do not believe. You mean, I
suppose, that it is logical to conclude &quot;yes&quot;. You are wrong in this.
There are no arguments that have not been hashed over for centuries
now. They have long since been deomstrated to be unconvincing.

The only conceivable and persuasive reason for a rational person to
believe would be personal experiences that cannot be adequately
shared. Rational people can also follow a religious path without
asserting any mythologies as literal truth; consider the Zen Buddhist,
for example. I am not sure he should be called a &quot;believer&quot;.

The FSM is aloof. The FSM cares not a whit for anything. An accidental
burp resulted in Maeve the Demiurgic Cat who spun the catverses with
her shed fur and hairballs. She then put a cat turd sould in each and
every human to be harvested each Thursday to fertilize her catnip
garden.

We need a messiah...or a mousiah named Tom.

&gt; I am a purrfect in the Cathair sect and supreme adherent to the Dogma
&gt; of Cathairism. Will this be the Abyssinian crusade unleashed upon
&gt; those of us who modified the not quite right Dogimil doctrines?

&gt; We have now determined that Cathairism is concordant with advanced
&gt; cosmology as superstrings are merely Maeve's shed hairs.

That explains a lot about the universe, not the least selective sweeps.

No I channeled that wrong. The mousiah's name shall be Jerry. Tom will
be the assassin Maeve creates to foil Jerry's attempts to infiltrate
Maeve's lair. Jerry will be aided by his guru the Tweety Bird who has
learned well the ways of cats n his dealings with Sylvester, Maeve's
ex-lover.
