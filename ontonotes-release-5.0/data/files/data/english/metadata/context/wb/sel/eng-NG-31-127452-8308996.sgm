Hello All,

I am very unsure about making this post, as I do not want to upset any
particular person. But, in my defence, I feel I have to. I am so sick
and tired of a few people who continually come onto the Board to
slander and bad mouth a particular person, and his VERY successful
business. The man in question is Steve Kramer, and the company I refer
to is one of the LEADING photographic institutions in the vast
northern region of Thailand, and is called Photoenvisions. Upon
hearing about the continual victimization that Steve is subjected to
here, my fellow group members have implored me to post the following
comments, as some way of silencing the 2 troublemakers in particular.

I apologise Khun Steve as I know this type of public PRAISE makes you
feel a bit uncomfortable.

Margie and Thomas, Boulder CO - &quot;My husband belongs to one of the
several photography associations here in Boulder, and as such has
quite a deal of knowledge pertaining to the best photographers and
photojournalists located across many parts of the world. In
photographic circles here in the States, Steve Kramer is regarded as
the rising young star of the Asian photography scene. We couldn't pass
up the chance to meet him on our wedding anniversary
holiday in Thailand&quot;. What a life-changing experience. Thank you
Steven&quot;.

Ronnie and Barb, Albuquerque NM - &quot;We had been planning our Asian trip
for many months, and the northern Thai part of our journey was one of
the most memorable highlights. To get a close up look at the various
Hilltribe communities that reside in the Chiang Mai province was
spectacular to say the least. Without the inside knowledge of our
group leader and teacher, Mr Steve Kramer, I doubt we would have had
any chance to go where we did. I still get a chill down my spine when
I think of Steve photographing that enormous Elephant and her
calf...WOW&quot;.

Chad and Summer, Long Beach CA - &quot;Freakin' awesome man. When my girl
told me she had purchased tickets for your northern Thai tour and
location shoot, I couldn't believe it. Best.Classroom.Lecture.Ever&quot;

Kind Regards,
Khun Brian.

Dear All,

WOW....the silence here is DEAFENING isn't it. It is amazing how
particular people hide when they have been proven wrong. For years
people on this Forum Board have been subjected to the rediculous
banter of 3 people in particular. It would seem they suddenly have
nothing left to say now after the significant SUPPORT Khun Steve has
received of late from people from all across the WORLD who have come
into contact with his HIGHLY succesful business, Photoenvisions. I
feel really happy and content knowing that, for once, the good guy
WINS.

Kind Regards,
Khun Brian.

****Nobody's more surprised than me Brian. Why I thought you new
friend Pinkie would be all over you yet he says that you never met.
Surely that can't be, all those happy days trotting about the jungles
together searching for sleeping elephants.
Was it your BO or his Brian???  Pinkie is notorious for his body odour
problem, believe me I know I smelt it myself..... Poooooooooooh

Perhaps you were'nt his cup of rosie.....So to speak.
