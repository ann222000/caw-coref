As I do extensive reading in trying to select what boat will suit me
best, I realize just how much fun boating is.
And I haven't even left the basement!
Right now I'm leaning toward the MacGregor 26M.
Might be new, might be used.  It's usually called a "motor sailor"
It's a high volume boat, inexpensive, and generally frowned upon by
the "high speed" sailing crowd.  When under sail it doesn't perform as
well as dedicated sailboats, though no single keel sailboat of similar
size is exactly a speed demon.
Some of the Mac's sailing performance deficit is inherent in its dual
purpose design, and some appears to be because those who buy this Mac
are not hard core sailors, and don't lend much effort to getting the
most of its sailing capabilities.
Everybody has different preferences in what they want from a boat, and
I'm laying out some of mine here.  They might change when I get more
experience, and they are in the end a balancing act, as always.
-- Sailing area.  The boat will be used exclusively to cruise the west
coast of Florida, from the panhandle to the Keys.
-- Purpose.  Slow cruising and fishing.  Hook swinging in shallow,
sheltered areas, exploring islands.  Shallow draft (+-18") is
essential for this, and I won't bend here.  I don't dinghy.  Had
enough dinghying/whaleboating when I was in the navy.
On the fishing side it looks like the Mac cockpit is small, and
freeboard all around is high, so it's sure not the best fishing
platform, but I could fish off a jetski, so it's not a deal killer.
Cruising might be a month out from home port, and I'll cover that
under other categories.  Might get some subjects confused in a
category, but I'll do my best to keep organized.
-- Economy.  My purchase/equip budget is @30k.  But that's if ongoing
costs aren't going to eat me up.
The Mac is trailerable, so when not in use it can be stored at
relatively low cost.
Despite its detractors, the Mac can move under sail from one place to
another.  It might be tender, it might not point well, etc, etc.  No
fuel used under sail.
Under power at less than hull speed, I believe the boat is a fuel
miser compared to similar sized power boats and heavier
but similar sized sailboats.  When wind on the freeboard affects
that economy, there's probably wind to sail instead.
On the economy related new/used issue, I'll make my points under
the construction topic.
--Livability.  I just don't have the experience here, from what I've
read the Mac is as comfortable as any 26.  Since I've tented for
weeks at a time, I don't see a problem with it.  I'm not going to be
living on the boat.  Me and the wife on 2-6 week cruises, and we
are not tall, and not fat.
--Construction.  I've seen many "better" sailboats recommended by the
"real" sailors to those considering the Mac 26M.  This in order to get
a "real" used sailboat for the price of a new Mac.
When I started looking at some of the recommendations I found most
are boats 20-40 years old.  There might be a problem even getting
insurance on these.
Besides, who wants a decrepit (insert pet sailboat here),
mildew-stinking, stringer rotting, engine-dying, sail-rotting,
barnicle-embedded, crap-in-the-bilge old ill-maintained boat when you
can get a new Mac?  Some of these sailors bragging about how well
their cachet-name sailboat is maintained probably don't do anything
but shine brightwork, and leave Brasso swirls when doing that.
Besides that, some of these boats are floating supported by 1/8" of
glass over 1/4" of chopper-gun crud over a layer of poorly wetted
cloth.
From what I've read the production process used in building the Mac
has more QC than most boat builders use.  I still don't know enough
about that and other construction details to buy one, but I can find
out, even if I have to visit the plant.  No teak, plenty of minor
fit/finish complaints, light hardware, etc.
A solid boat suitable for my purposes, or so it seems.
Anyway, even an experienced surveyor can't always find the real
quality of a boat.  Somebody recommended the Parker-Dawson 26
over the Mac and when I looked for info I found owners discovering
deck cleats had not even large washers as backing.  One came adrift
because of this and he lost the boat on the rocks.
http://www.parkerdawson.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=288
Now I'm not knocking this boat, just saying even a new boat must be
gone over with a fine toothed comb, and an old boat may have well
concealed problems that won't be found without taking it apart
If they weren't questionable due to age, I'd much prefer a Dawson over
a Mac.  Of course they were 40k new in 1983, and cross oceans.
Some people are willing to buy an old boat and spend a lot of time
bringing it up to snuff.  Not only do I not have the time or
inclination, I get irritable when pulling off half-assed or unsuitable
mods.
So besides the issue of how a boat has been maintained and whether
initial construction is going to bite you, there is the "clean slate"
factor in making modifications.  This is possible even with a used
recent Mac 26, because they aren't normally used as liveaboards
and probably not much as overnighters.
From perusing the Mac site I see some have added air, gensets,
dodgers, extra fresh water, etc.  The cabin is an open design from
the factory with minimal cabinetry.
When first looking at sailers, I tended toward a small diesel for
economy when motoring.  But now I think the lost interior space and
maintenance/cost issues of the diesel in a 26' boat make me lean in
favor of a small 4-stroke on the transom.
Just as most sailboaters recommend against the Mac 26M, the owners
of the Mac 26M generally recommend max HP OB.  I'm not buying that
either, since I won't be pulling tubes or skis as many of them do, or
be in a hurry as many of them are.
I'll be looking for my balance between sailing and powering in terms
of OB weight.  Depending on tradeoffs, I'm not even sure I would get
the boat on plane, which is one of its hull-type selling points.
I had originally thought along the lines of a 24' Carolina Skiff for
mostly short fishing trips, maybe some hook swinging under a popup
which some CS owners do.  The CS is another economical, shallow draft
and highly modifiable boat.
But on a price/versatily basis the Mac has the CS beat - for me.
Anyway, I'm still learning and all ears for any comments.  But please
don't make my ears turn red.  OTOH, since I'm an old navy guy, that
might be impossible.

Well this one I have a little bit of experiance with; used boat = rip
every stitch of wire out of the boat and re run it all.
In my experiance the problems i have had on most boats have been with
wireing and standing rigging.
standing rig i usually have enough stuff to fix it on hand. but a
short or a loose wire in the bilge etc can cause things to go
gunnybags at the wrong time.  most of the electrical is coverd up so
you cannot see what is wired correctly and what is not .

Rewiring an old boat first off would be my inclination too.
20-40 year-old wire, and 20-40 years of hatchet jobs done
to the wiring by "sailors."  No thanks! .
Even on a new Mac 26M first thing you do if you intend
electrical additions is toss the stock electric panel and
get a beefier one that fits your needs.

With all due respect, that boat will get very small for two people
after a few days of cruising.  I appreciate what you are trying to do
but I hate to see you spend money on a boat that neither sails, motors

buy.

In the long run I think you'd be happier with something like a RF246
with a 4 stroke outboard on it.

Thanks.  Nice boat, but might be a bit rich for my blood.  Hadn't seen
it before even with all my browsing.  You may be right on target
though, and I take your advice to try out what I'm buying before I buy
it to heart.  You gave me another avenue to explore.
Although I'm not young, I'm still in pretty good shape, and do like
the idea of sailing, having crewed some.

Sure, sailing is great fun but it is difficult to get a boat that
sails well and cruises well, and still meets your shallow draft
requirement.  You might want to get an inexpensive day sailor just as
a fun boat.  There are lots to choose from, but one of my choices
would be a Flying Scot.

http://www.flyingscot.com/

They are good boats that sail very well and meet your specs with the
exception of cruising.  You can beach them and go tent camping of
course.  I'm guessing you could pick up a good used one with trailer
for less than $5K.

Boy, you're gonna keep me busy boating on the net for a few more days
now!  You've dead on about combining cruising/sailing/shallow draft
capabilities in one boat I can afford.  That Mac 26 comes closest
right now.
Ideally, I'd get a Flying Scot for sailing and something like the
Rosborough RF-246 for cruising, but I'm not ready to commit that much
money yet.  Too many questions to be answered, especially some
hands-on boating.  Now I want to try that Flying Scot, but I've got no
doubt it'll make the Max 26 feel like a dog under sail.
Thanks for the ideas.  Now I'll go tell the wife I changed my mind
about buying a boat.  I want at least 2 boats.

&gt; Everybody has different preferences in what they want from a boat, and
&gt; I'm laying out some of mine here.  They might change when I get more
&gt; experience, and they are in the end a balancing act, as always.
&gt; -- Sailing area.  The boat will be used exclusively to cruise the west
&gt; coast of Florida, from the panhandle to the Keys.
&gt; -- Purpose.  Slow cruising and fishing.  Hook swinging in shallow,
&gt; sheltered areas, exploring islands.  Shallow draft (+-18&quot;) is
&gt; essential for this, and I won't bend here.  I don't dinghy.  Had
&gt; enough dinghying/whaleboating when I was in the navy.
&gt; On the fishing side it looks like the Mac cockpit is small, and
&gt; freeboard all around is high, so it's sure not the best fishing
&gt; platform, but I could fish off a jetski, so it's not a deal killer.
&gt; Cruising might be a month out from home port, and I'll cover that
&gt; under other categories.  Might get some subjects confused in a
&gt; category, but I'll do my best to keep organized.
&gt; -- Economy.  My purchase/equip budget is @30k.  But that's if ongoing
&gt; costs aren't going to eat me up.
&gt; The Mac is trailerable, so when not in use it can be stored at
&gt; relatively low cost.
&gt; Despite its detractors, the Mac can move under sail from one place to
&gt; another.  It might be tender, it might not point well, etc, etc.  No
&gt; fuel used under sail.
&gt; Under power at less than hull speed, I believe the boat is a fuel
&gt; miser compared to similar sized power boats and heavier
&gt; but similar sized sailboats.  When wind on the freeboard affects
&gt; that economy, there's probably wind to sail instead.
&gt; On the economy related new/used issue, I'll make my points under
&gt; the construction topic.
&gt; --Livability.  I just don't have the experience here, from what I've
&gt; read the Mac is as comfortable as any 26.  Since I've tented for
&gt; weeks at a time, I don't see a problem with it.  I'm not going to be
&gt; living on the boat.  Me and the wife on 2-6 week cruises, and we
&gt; are not tall, and not fat.
&gt; --Construction.  I've seen many &quot;better&quot; sailboats recommended by the
&gt; &quot;real&quot; sailors to those considering the Mac 26M.  This in order to get
&gt; a &quot;real&quot; used sailboat for the price of a new Mac.
&gt; When I started looking at some of the recommendations I found most
&gt; are boats 20-40 years old.  There might be a problem even getting
&gt; insurance on these.
&gt; Besides, who wants a decrepit (insert pet sailboat here),
&gt; mildew-stinking, stringer rotting, engine-dying, sail-rotting,
&gt; barnicle-embedded, crap-in-the-bilge old ill-maintained boat when you
&gt; can get a new Mac?  Some of these sailors bragging about how well
&gt; their cachet-name sailboat is maintained probably don't do anything
&gt; but shine brightwork, and leave Brasso swirls when doing that.
&gt; Besides that, some of these boats are floating supported by 1/8&quot; of
&gt; glass over 1/4&quot; of chopper-gun crud over a layer of poorly wetted
&gt; cloth.
&gt; From what I've read the production process used in building the Mac
&gt; has more QC than most boat builders use.  I still don't know enough
&gt; about that and other construction details to buy one, but I can find
&gt; out, even if I have to visit the plant.  No teak, plenty of minor
&gt; fit/finish complaints, light hardware, etc.
&gt; A solid boat suitable for my purposes, or so it seems.
&gt; Anyway, even an experienced surveyor can't always find the real
&gt; quality of a boat.  Somebody recommended the Parker-Dawson 26
&gt; over the Mac and when I looked for info I found owners discovering
&gt; deck cleats had not even large washers as backing.  One came adrift
&gt; because of this and he lost the boat on the rocks. http://www.parkerdawson.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=288
&gt; Now I'm not knocking this boat, just saying even a new boat must be
&gt; gone over with a fine toothed comb, and an old boat may have well
&gt; concealed problems that won't be found without taking it apart
&gt; If they weren't questionable due to age, I'd much prefer a Dawson over
&gt; a Mac.  Of course they were 40k new in 1983, and cross oceans.
&gt; Some people are willing to buy an old boat and spend a lot of time
&gt; bringing it up to snuff.  Not only do I not have the time or
&gt; inclination, I get irritable when pulling off half-assed or unsuitable
&gt; mods.
&gt; So besides the issue of how a boat has been maintained and whether
&gt; initial construction is going to bite you, there is the &quot;clean slate&quot;
&gt; factor in making modifications.  This is possible even with a used
&gt; recent Mac 26, because they aren't normally used as liveaboards
&gt; and probably not much as overnighters.
&gt; From perusing the Mac site I see some have added air, gensets,
&gt; dodgers, extra fresh water, etc.  The cabin is an open design from
&gt; the factory with minimal cabinetry.
&gt; When first looking at sailers, I tended toward a small diesel for
&gt; economy when motoring.  But now I think the lost interior space and
&gt; maintenance/cost issues of the diesel in a 26' boat make me lean in
&gt; favor of a small 4-stroke on the transom.
&gt; Just as most sailboaters recommend against the Mac 26M, the owners
&gt; of the Mac 26M generally recommend max HP OB.  I'm not buying that
&gt; either, since I won't be pulling tubes or skis as many of them do, or
&gt; be in a hurry as many of them are.
&gt; I'll be looking for my balance between sailing and powering in terms
&gt; of OB weight.  Depending on tradeoffs, I'm not even sure I would get
&gt; the boat on plane, which is one of its hull-type selling points.
&gt; I had originally thought along the lines of a 24' Carolina Skiff for
&gt; mostly short fishing trips, maybe some hook swinging under a popup
&gt; which some CS owners do.  The CS is another economical, shallow draft
&gt; and highly modifiable boat.
&gt; But on a price/versatily basis the Mac has the CS beat - for me.
&gt; Anyway, I'm still learning and all ears for any comments.  But please
&gt; don't make my ears turn red.  OTOH, since I'm an old navy guy, that
&gt; might be impossible.

When you first began outlining your parameters, including the $30k
budget, it sounded to me like the MacGregor 26 made a lot of sense as
an option.

Nothing has dissuaded me from that opinion. Just about everybody will
agree that it doesn't sail "as well" as more conventional sailboats,
but it sails well enough to enjoy the experience of sailing. Most of
those sailors who feel that nobody should be seen in a boat that isn't
the finest possible technical achievement ever launched under sail
should stop criticizing your interest in the MacGregor and immediately
go scuttle whatever also-highly-compromised boat it is that they
currently own.

With a single outboard, you can realize some pretty impressive speeds
when in the "powerboat mode".

As far as interior accommodation goes- that small cockpit that
restricts your fishing room translates into about 3 times the interior
cabin room of most 26-foot powerboats.

Are there better boats out there than a MacGregor 26? Heck and
absolutely yes. But not new or nearly new for $30k, and not that will
meet most of your other qualifications in the process.

As you can see, there are certain brands of boats (usually among the
more moderately priced) where ownership comes with a steady barrage of
nasty comments from nasty people who can't wait to tell you what a
dunce you were for not buying whatever brand they happen to own. I
have to wonder how many people wind up buying a beat up old hulk with
an "acceptable" trade name on it just to avoid dealing with such
jerks?

If you have an interest in MacGregor, research the heck out of it. I'd
hang out on the MacGregor owner's group site and ask a few questions,
etc, if I were you. See if you can find somebody who is using one in
the same sort of conditions or the same general vicinity where you
plan to boat. There are those who will caution you that current owners
are a poor resource because they tend to sing the praises of their own
boat----- but what would be better? Folks who had never owned one and
were merely inventing or passing along dock gossip?

By all means, pay no attention at all to folks who feel compelled to
call names or make disparaging personal remarks when belittling your
interest in this or any other boat. If they had anything intelligent
or useful to say about the subject they would do so, rather than
publicly demonstrate their immaturity and lack of self control.

The local MacGregor dealer is all but sold out until the end of the
year. The MacGregor owners in the Pacific NW have an annual rendezous
that is extremely well attended, and the boats are very popular,
within their niche, in this corner of the country.

I still think you'd be no worse off with a new Mac 26, (given the rest
of your requirements) than you would be with a 1979 version of a
"real" sailboat (with "real" headaches) for maybe the same kind of
money.

&gt;Might be new, might be used.  It's usually called a &quot;motor sailor&quot;
&gt;It's a high volume boat, inexpensive, and generally frowned upon by

A bloke in the next slip to me, when I was in Singapore, had a brand
new MG. From talking to him it appeared that he had done considerable
sailing in the U.K. but his wife was Asian and had never been at sea.

They sailed the boat every weekend for the month or so I was there and
finally decided to sell the boat as winds in SEA are really not
reliable enough to make sailing interesting. Bought a power boat.

However, they liked the boat. Small, fast under power. A bit spartan
but fine for weekends. Not a boat for ocean voyages but nice enough
for short trips.

I would guess that if you have really, really, considered the
strengths and weaknesses of the boat and feel that the strengths
outweigh the weaknesses then it will be fine. A canoe just won;t do to
cross oceans and a 50 ft. sailing yacht isn't the thing for
gunk-holing.

Far from defending the Mac26, I will say that there are situations when it
seems to be appropriate. For example, I know a couple who have one, and they
almost exclusively explore the marshland near a community in the SF bayarea.
They don't venture out onto the bay much... perhaps 5 percent of the time
and then only in the south bay. They like bird watching and don't want to
kayak, since they stay out for a couple of days in a row. I think they do
sail it a bit, but mostly they motor very slowly hither and yon.

Good observation.

It may be regionally significant, or not. The best months for sailing
in my region are when it's pretty cold and still peeing down rain in
the spring and fall. The winds don't come up until late in the
afternoon a lot of midsummer days when the weather is warmer.

As a result, most of the sailboats in this corner of the country
operate under power most of the time. Sailing seems to be reserved for
racing, or for screwing around with for an hour or two after arriving
in the general vicinity of the ultimate daily destination. Of course
there are scattered exceptions, just enough to prove the rule. From
that respect, a MacGregor that spent most of its time in powerboat
mode wouldn't vary much from a more elite brand doing the same thing.

If I were interested in sailing, I'd consider a Mac, too. I think you'd be
happy with it: it's not expensive and it will do the job. I read a review on
it years ago, and the only thing I remember as a possible disadvantage was
the hardware not being the best or sturdiest.

Your opinion noted and respected.
I've spent considerable time reading the Mac forum and other sail
forums, including ASA.  You're right about Mac 26's being used mostly
under power, but the same is true for all cruising sailboats, Mac or
not. The Mac just powers better.
I've read post after post from non-Mac cruising sailors who hardly
ever sail!  They are frank when informal surveys are done.
Not enough wind to hoist sail.  Too windy to hoist sail. ICW
unsuitable for sailing.  Easier to just crank up the motor.  Don't
want to beat against the wind.  Prefer not to heel too much because
the drinks get spilled.  And on and on.  Others are marina or hook
sailors who seemingly *never* sail, but write posts about sailing
quite a bit, much as I'm doing and I don't even have a boat!
Just as a rough estimate from my reading, I'd say Mac owners spend
more time out in the water moving than the average sailboat owner.
Some of the Mac owners sail quite a bit and enjoy it.  Some
of them have been sailing all their lives on quicker boats but still
are happy to sail their Macs.  Since I'm not a sailing purist, and
have vowed never to be in a hurry, I have no problem with the Mac
being slow.  I'll give a friendly wave to those who pass and leave
them to feel like happy because they passed a Mac.  Since you were a
racing sailor, you may have difficulty connecting to that mindset.
Of course, maybe I'll trouble with it to when I get to sailing.
Bottom line is you want to sail, you hoist sail.  If you want to race
under sail and brag about it, don't get a Mac.
Actually, on the power cruiser side, there seems to be even less
compromise.
Like sailers, power cruisers come in many flavors.  Speed, cabin
size, fishing suitability, economy and weather handling quickly come
to mind.  The Mac is again slow to the speedster, probably doing
12-15 knots with a cruising load and 50hp.  Still faster than tugs and
trawlers at better economy.  Might get superb MPG if powered right and
kept below hull speed.  Most owners don't use it that way.
It's not a good fishing platform.  It's better in weather than an open
boat and at least equal to a similarly priced power cruiser.
The cabin space is voluminous compared to motor cruisers of the same
length, though buried below deck and not well appointed stock.
The power cruiser aspect is what got me interested in the Mac in the
first place, when I realized that if I went with the Carolina Skiff my
sense of gas economy and no need for speed would have me running
it off plane.  So in considering economical hull types I reached the
Mac, which might be called a semi-displacement hull, and has many
advantages over the Carolina Skiff in my eyes, though it's 8-10k more.
That's where I am now, compromised.  And it's fun enough.
I've worn this subject out for now, and other facts are intervening.
Was going to Punta Gorda first week of April and try out some boats,
but I've been offered a six month contract that will probably draw me
out of retirement, which is good and bad.
Bad because I don't like work, good because I can get more boat.
Since in six months I might be too old to handle sail and have more
money too, that RF246 might look sweeter yet.
If I'm stuck here  I'll call some sailing contacts and maybe crew on
Lake Michigan some weekends this summer to get a better picture.
Gosh, I hope I don't get seasick.  That'll screw things up real good.

&gt;&gt;As I do extensive reading in trying to select what boat will suit me
&gt;&gt;best, I realize just how much fun boating is.
&gt;&gt;And I haven't even left the basement!
&gt;&gt;Right now I'm leaning toward the MacGregor 26M.
&gt;&gt;Might be new, might be used.  It's usually called a &quot;motor sailor&quot;
&gt;&gt;It's a high volume boat, inexpensive, and generally frowned upon by
&gt;&gt;the &quot;high speed&quot; sailing crowd.  When under sail it doesn't perform as
&gt;&gt;well as dedicated sailboats, though no single keel sailboat of similar
&gt;&gt;size is exactly a speed demon.

&gt;A bloke in the next slip to me, when I was in Singapore, had a brand
&gt;new MG. From talking to him it appeared that he had done considerable
&gt;sailing in the U.K. but his wife was Asian and had never been at sea.

&gt;They sailed the boat every weekend for the month or so I was there and
&gt;finally decided to sell the boat as winds in SEA are really not
&gt;reliable enough to make sailing interesting. Bought a power boat.

&gt;However, they liked the boat. Small, fast under power. A bit spartan
&gt;but fine for weekends. Not a boat for ocean voyages but nice enough
&gt;for short trips.

&gt;I would guess that if you have really, really, considered the
&gt;strengths and weaknesses of the boat and feel that the strengths
&gt;outweigh the weaknesses then it will be fine. A canoe just won;t do to
&gt;cross oceans and a 50 ft. sailing yacht isn't the thing for
&gt;gunk-holing.
">

Right.  I'm not going to do an impulse buy.
Didn't realize finding sailing wind was such a problem until recently.
Here on Lake Michigan near Chicago calm is fairly rare, though it
spoils the occasional weekend day for sailors.
The times I've spent in Florida, always in the summer, there's
generally a good breeze off shore.  Maybe too much for a Mac (-:
But the vagaries of sailing weather is probably one reason Mac sells
so many of this type boat.  I think the main reason though is the
boat is versatile and inexpensive.  Though I've never cared a whit
about skiing and tubing, many families enjoy doing it with their kids.
As a value proposition the boat works well indeed.

That's excellent that you're taking your time and doing it right.
There's one moron around here by the name of JimC who claims he's a

embarrassed about his uninformed entry-level purchase. It's like I'm
sure people look at his boat and then find out he's a lawyer and they
begin to wonder how lame is this guy. Lawyers who are worth a hoot make,
what, about 500 dollars an hour so he ought to be able to afford a real
boat and a classy boat at that. Anyhow, poor JimC spent probably a
hundred hours posting things about how he was so happy with his purchase
but you could tell he was not happy at all. Somebody who's happy with
his boat doesn't spend hundreds of hours trying to convince himself how
great it is.

But, I think the dude finally got the message that everybody thought he
was pretty stupid and he got totally disrespected so he sorta slunk off
with his tail tucked. He just about quit posting on alt.sailing.asa
because he became the laughing stock of the group. If you are the type
of individual who is a bit insecure about his personal worth and has low
self-esteem and is a bit paranoid like Jonathan Ganz, for example, do
yourself a favor and consider how people will snicker behind your back
and make snide remarks about your pretend sailboat. If that sort of
thing gets to you perhaps you should reconsider and get a boat that is
more prestigious. If you don't give a crap what people think about your
choice of boat and it doesn't bother your self-esteem the Mac 26 could
be a decent choice for you.

If you're more like Scotty you won't care at all what people think.
Scotty sails a Seidelmann which has a worse reputation than even a
Mac26. He doesn't seem to care that almost everybody laughs at him
behind his back and shuns him to his face when confronted with him in
person. He's the type that probably would be very happy with a Mac26.

there's a couple of baots that doen't have any sailing rigging on

No kidding. I didn't specifically say it, but these people never sail
the boat in the marshland. They motor almost exclusively. The only
time they raise the sails is when infrequently venturing out to visit
another inlet. I don't think they turn off the engine.

It's strange, but I guess they like the idea of having sails... just
in case.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Far from defending the Mac26, I will say that there are situations when it

&gt; &gt;&gt; They don't venture out onto the bay much... perhaps 5 percent of the time
&gt; &gt;&gt; and then only in the south bay. They like bird watching and don't want to
&gt; &gt;&gt; kayak, since they stay out for a couple of days in a row. I think they do
&gt; &gt;&gt; sail it a bit, but mostly they motor very slowly hither and yon.
&gt; &gt;Not sure about a Mac26, but there's some people on my favorite lake,
&gt; &gt;that have some fairly good sized sail boats, in the 22'-27' range, and
&gt; &gt;there's a couple of baots that doen't have any sailing rigging on
&gt; &gt;them. Interesting to note, that they will come in from the St.Louis
&gt; &gt;area, in a Fri evening (especially on a holiday weekend) load
&gt; &gt;dufflebags, and coolers, into their non rigged sail boat, then power
&gt; &gt;there way out into the lake. some diesel, and some small outboard, and
&gt; &gt;will use the boat for  a weekend &quot;water camper&quot;.

&gt; &gt;they like the boat, but don't like sailing.

&gt; &gt;huh

&gt; No kidding. I didn't specifically say it, but these people never sail
&gt; the boat in the marshland. They motor almost exclusively. The only
&gt; time they raise the sails is when infrequently venturing out to visit
&gt; another inlet. I don't think they turn off the engine.

&gt; It's strange, but I guess they like the idea of having sails... just
&gt; in case.

Jim,
I wasn't aware that you knew Wilbur personally and so well.

I wouldn't get upset too much. You are quite right in your comments.
Some people regard boats as they do their cars - the newer, the more
expensive, the faster and so on, the better. There is actually no best
boat at all. There are boats better suited for cruising, for racing,
for shallow waters, for entertaining etc., A true lover of boats and
those with experience of the sea does not regard them as a status
symbol to enhance the social or other status of the owner. As there is
no "best" woman or man, there is no best boat. People choose boats for
a number of reasons, often quite illogical - rather like marriage.

I recall two boats in New Zealand that would readily incur the
ridicule of such as Wilbur. One was a 18 foot open plywood home built
dory with the name "John's Dory" painted on the sides in large
letters. Holiday makers at the wharf of the resort town where my beach
home is never gave it a second glance but stared at the large and new
power boats with dreamy eyes. The interesting thing is that John,
being retired, went out recreational fishing in his home built boat
every day and always came back with a decent catch. His little boat
was out in all weathers and was probably more seaworthy than most of
the larger power boats who were kept at home by the rough seas. They
often complained also of the lack of good fishing. John would never
take much from the sea and gave most of his catch away to older people
and others about town. A couple of times, John went out to tow in
flasher boats that had broken down. He never said much and never
responded when people scoffed at his boat. He was a much better seaman
and fisherman than they, regardless of the monetary worth of their
boats.

Another boat I met several times when we  lived aboard at Westhaven
Marina in Auckland, New Zealand. It was built after WWII of timbers
that the then owner had managed to scavenge. It was about 28 feet in
length and had rigging made of plow steel, spliced with a a Liverpool
splice and parceled. The inside was barren and in need of furniture
there being only two perfunctionary berths. The only things on that
boat that were less than 40 years old were the owner's sea boots. He
was a bricklayer who lived and worked on Great Barrier Island, a day's
sail northeast of Auckland. In essence, the little sailboat was his
car.

As the vessel was not fitted with any engine, he had become a
proficient sailor and would sail to the marina mouth, turn port 90
degrees  into the channel, starboard 90 degrees, then port 90 again
and finally another port 90  to gently brush against the pontoon of
thefinger berth. All of this under sail by himself. I doubt that I
would ever be able to perform this manouvre,  if I ever had to. As we
usually anchor out, I have to suppress feelings of panic upon entering
marinas.

What was most interesting to see was that everyone's eyes were turned
to watch this little rough boat coming in. Nobody said anything but
watched in silent appreciation of the skill displayed. People vied to
take his docklines, people whose boats were worth half a million
dollars. He never said much either, even though many of the onlookers
tried to engage him in conversation. We were fortunate that his berth
was along from ours and we would often have him to dinner with before
he set off back to the island.

In writing of these two boats, several other boats and their owners
have come to mind. One left a lasting impression upon my family. We
were anchored by ourselves overnight near the Ranger Station on Rinja
Island in Indonesia, one of the two islands that are home to the giant
Komodo Dragons. Early that morning, my wife went on deck in response
to a gentle knock on the hull and was presented with a 15 inch long,
freshly caught fish by a small old man in an outrigger canoe about 12
to 14 feet in length. At one end of the canoe was a small broken pot
on some stones where he cooked his meals. Drying in the sun were a few
three and four inch long trepang or sea slugs that he had dived for
and that he would later sell to the traders for a few cents - the
basis of his living. He had home made diving goggles carved from wood
with plastic inserts and a piece of string to hold them on his head.
His only protection from the elements was one of those ubiquitous blue
plastic tarpaulins folded neatly in the bow along with a cheap woven
plastic prayer mat.

My wife told him to wait for her to get some money but he smiled,
waved and slowly paddled off. We spoke to the rangers of him later
that morning and found that what we saw about him was all that he
owned in the world.  Cooking and eating that fish for dinner was
somewhat of a religious experience. That simple man, who had made a
present to those who had far more than he, taught us a valuable lesson
and made a great impact on the lives of the three of us. My son, who
was 9 at the time, still remembers him.

We couldn't give him money - it would have been an insult; so we later
sought him out and gave him some clothes, a diving mask and some
flippers as well as a few other items of little real value to us.

If there is one thing I have learned, it is that one should never
ridicule other people's choice of boat any more than one should
ridicule their occupation, station in life or choice of spouse.

Reminds me of my first boat;
she was a little 30' troller, out of Charlston Oregon.
An old converted log pond tug; she only had a foot of free board and a
foot of keel.

the Fella I bought her from started fishing as a boy in 1919 and his
boats had always been rigged like he learned to fish.
the Terry L had hand gurdies running tuna cord and cotton spreads.

the boat he got to replace the Terry L was almost 100 years old and 22
foot double ender he set it up the same way.
every day this 80 year old would be on his boat at 4:30 in the
morning.
all the young fishermen laughed at him heading out the jaws at 5 knots
for a day of fishing.
what they didnt see was his daily catch.
I had to learn how to use the gear on my boat; so i went fishing as
his hand for a couple years.
this man never came to port with less than a hold full of fish.
The Argus would never win a beauty contest but she sure could fish.

Dog gone Katie...  that was kind of a cold hearted admonishment
of Mr. Hendra's post much less Jim Cate.

Excluding Jim of course...  it could well be that Mr. Hendra is
not up to speed and familiar with the infamous Captain Neal and
his literary escapades (much less alias) via these news groups.

For the record... I myself found Peter Hendra's post a very inter-
esting readindeed...  and thank him for sharing.

It is a moderated forum...  with about 1800 registered users...
and very active concerning the MacGregor product...  mostly
the good...  but the bad and ugly as well.  (smile)

And yeh...  I am an owner as well...  and you are more than wel-
come to email me direct.  The email address that is shown...  is
for real.

I have made it personal policy not to discuss the attributes as well
as the shortcomings of this boat on public forums...  for obvious rea-

so.  heh heh

JimC is a natural born loser so it's to be expected he'd engage in
self-flagellation in public forums. Anybody who buys a Mac26 is a loser.
Anybody who's proud of owning one is a double loser. If you own a Mac26,
just shut up about it and use it once in a while. Try to not notice any
real sailboats because you will quickly become dissatisfied with your
choice of boats. Try not to notice any real motor boats because you will
quickly become annoyed at the lame compromise boat you ended up with.
Just stay focused on never examining the many faults of the Mac26
compared to its one or two virtues and you might remain happy with your
uninformed purchase for a season or two. But whatever you do, NEVER
claim it's a good boat because it just isn't. It's a cheap, entry level,
compromise boat that calls to immediate attention the lack of
intelligence of the owner. People who have real motorboats and people
who have real sailboats know what I'm talking about.

Well, most of the time. There's always the well-justified exception.

OTOH there's always the bitter losers who will spew their bile on any

I guess where Wilbur misses the boat is his remark that "Lawyers who
are worth make, what,  about 500 dollars an hour so he ought to be
able to afford a real boat and a classy boat", and Wilbur is probably
right.

But instead of buying a boat that meets  Wilbur's standards for a
proper boat the guy went out and bought what HE wanted. Probably what
a lot of people do -- ignore Wilbur and buy what they want....
