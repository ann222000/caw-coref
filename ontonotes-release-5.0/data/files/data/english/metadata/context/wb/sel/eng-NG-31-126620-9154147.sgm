Coconut Shrimp With Red Curry Sauce
Recipe By: Tyler Florence

Ingredients

1               Peanut or vegetable oil -- for frying
1/4     cup     cornstarch
3       large   egg whites
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2       cup     flaked coconut
1 1/2   pounds  jumbo shrimp -- peeled with tails on
Red Curry Sauce -- recipe follows
1               green onion -- white and green part, chopped
1               handful fresh mint -- hand-torn

Instructions

Heat 3 inches of oil in a large deep skillet or heavy pot to 325
degrees F.
In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch, egg whites, salt, and pepper
until foamy. Spread the coconut out in a pie dish. Dredge the shrimp
with the cornstarch/egg white mixture and shake off any excess. Press
the shrimp into the coconut flakes; turn shrimp over and press into
coconut again to coat both sides.

Deep-fry the shrimp in batches until the coconut is golden brown,
about 2 to 3 minutes. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the
shrimp to paper towels to drain. Arrange the shrimp on a platter,
serve immediately with red curry sauce and garnish with green onion
and mint.

Red Curry Sauce:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons Thai red curry paste
1 cup unsweetened coconut milk
1 lime, juiced
Place a small pot over medium heat and coat with the oil. Stir the
red curry paste into the pan and fry that up until aromatic. Slowly
pour in the coconut milk and continue to stir to incorporate. Add the
lime juice (and 1 of the squeezed out halves for added flavor) and
cook for 5 to 10 minutes to thicken. Pour the sauce into a nice
serving bowl and serve with the coconut shrimp.
Yield: 1 cup

Difficulty: Easy
Yield: About 20 shrimp

&quot;My idea of pure heaven is to spend a day in the kitchen, peeling,
chopping, and stirring while the words of a good book fill the air
around me.&quot;
