Ahmadinejad is no Hitler, and OJ Simpson is no Bush

They insist he wants to &quot;wipe Israel off the map,&quot; even though a thoroughly
documented analysis that appeared on the Information Clearing House website
in 2006 shows that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's words were severely distorted in
translation.

He was actually referring to replacing the Israeli regime, by the same
historical process that eliminated South African apartheid.

The aforementioned online article, together with the Iranian president's
plain statement during his Columbia University speech, also proves that he
actually isn't a &quot;Holocaust denier,&quot; something we've been drummed to accept
as an unquestionable verity.

Thus the two most sensational reasons for despising the dude are essentially
bogus.

That leaves the nuclear accusation.

But Iran is a compliant signer of the UN Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons, and International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors have
consistently found no violations of Iran's stated, peaceful intent.

Pakistan, India, and Israel would all flunk the criteria that Iran has had
to meet.

Yes, Iran is a reactionary state that persecutes dissidents, thwarts
equality, etc. But so do such Middle East allies of Washington as Egypt,
Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait.

Heck, so does the United States itself!

Why the double standard, if not to generate a climate conducive to war?

By the way, be assured that Iranian dissidents don't want their country to
be bombed by America, or to undergo a full US invasion.

Some claim Ahmadinejad is a maniacal anti-Semite, but it would be extremely
difficult to build a credible case that Iranian Jews suffer rights-denial
even remotely approaching that which Palestinians experience on a harsh,
daily basis in the Occupied Territories.

We need to get our blinders off.

Falling for wild contentions the last time around took us neck-deep into an
Iraqi quagmire.

Going to war with Iran now, for fraudulent reasons, would sink us completely
beneath the bubbling surface of a fresh patch of sucking quicksand.

Can you imagine what it was like to have been the Little Rock Nine?

Those young American heroes bravely got up every morning to challenge Jim
Crow in the classroom, enduring not only hateful taunts and jeers, but
pushes, shoves, scaldings in gym showers, and the routine destruction of
their books and papers in constantly violated lockers.

Plus other indignities our minds can't even fathom.

Fifty years later, they returned to the Arkansas school that would have kept
them out forever, except for federal soldiers with rifles in hand, but this
time in well-deserved honor.

Dwight Eisenhower's 1957 decision to use the 101st Airborne Division to
integrate Central High allowed nine black students to become the uniformly
poised, polished, and accomplished adults their interview on the PBS News
Hour last evening proved them to so inspiringly be.

But wait.

Those qualities had to have been there back when screaming white kids spat
in their faces.

What amazing courage!

There are tears on my keyboard, and profound thanks in my heart.

OJ Simpson may spend the rest of his life in prison for entering a hotel
room to recover his own belongings.

But George Bush will be rewarded with a nice federal pension and a
presidential library in Texas for invading Iraq to steal its oil.

Except for one guy who apparently had a heart attack, nobody got hurt in the
former incident.

In the latter, however, a new British survey estimates that 1.2 million
people have perished, a figure on a rough par with the Rawanda Massacre and
the Cambodian Killing Fields tolls.

I'm sure glad I'm not a &quot;troubled&quot; teenager, because the cockeyed absurdity
of all this would probably lead me to rebel against crazy adult hypocrisy by
getting a wicked tattoo and piercing my nose with a Hardware Hank bolt.

What if there are space aliens observing our outlandish goings on from UFOs
circling the earth?

&quot;Whoa, Zilnar! Check this out! You won't believe it, man!&quot;

I don't think it's smart for Dubya to infuriate superior beings possessing
powerful lasers and an advanced sense of justice.
