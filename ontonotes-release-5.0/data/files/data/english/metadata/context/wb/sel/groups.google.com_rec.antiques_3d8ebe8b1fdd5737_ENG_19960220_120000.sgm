In many states including Texas and Massachusetts, all convicted felons
are barred from holding auctioneer licenses.

In New Hampshire, which has in the past given the board of auctioneers
discretion in issuing licenses to felons, a proposed cleanup of laws
regarding auctioneers has led to controversy.

Details on the NH controversy can be found in the latest issue of Unravel
the Gavel. The online edition of Unravel the Gavel is found on the-forum

http://www.the-forum.com

The legislature breaks into two camps, those who feel that if the felon
hasn't stolen money, its okay to be an auctioneer and those who feel that
even a child molester or rapist should be refusedf a license.

How do you feel?

The difference between a ex-felon auctioneer and a non-felon
auctioneer is that the later has not been caught yet!

At least with an ex-felon, you know where you stand!

That's my English thoughts anyway - I 'm not sure of the law in UK
with respect to auctioneers licence - but they are very strict.

BTW: Kimble was not innocent!

"/> Your sentence is awfully long and somewhat difficult to interpret, but if
I understand you correctly you are saying that you have the power
(=right??) to misrepresent items to get them sold...

Do you actually provide a verbal description intended to mislead? Do you
lie to your buyers? Do you feel any obligation to the people who have as
much to do with making auctions successful as the sellers and auctioneer
(the buyers), or is your only obligation to the consignors?

I pretty much agree with Ms Lehman. In our society we allow fellons to
be attorneys, bankers, accountants, and anything else they want to be;
why not auctioneers too ? I don't mean to be trite but in times like
these each of us has to take responsibility for what we do/buy; it's
more or less back to the times of &quot; ... let the buyer beware ... &quot;
I don't mean by that, that I support those dishonest auctioneers. I do
mean that we have to make our own buy decisions based on what we see,
not what someone we hardly know tells us.

There's a difference, perhaps a subtle one, between caveat emptor ( let
the buyer beware ) and outright lying. You don't have to misrepresent
something. All you have to do is NOT say anything. And this business about
protecting your consignors...don't you mean protecting your commission?

By the way, where in Connecticut are you?
