In response, Behe and the [&quot;intelligent design&quot;] movement shifted
ground, first redefining I.C. in an effort to meet the flood of
negation, finally (in effect) by scanting it in favor of more general
claims. The Edge of Evolution is Behe's heroic effort to snatch victory
from the jaws of defeat.

The primary document, the original review, is a lot
more fun than that gloss you URLed; &quot;how sharper
than a serpent's tongue&quot;:

http://www.creationismstrojanhorse.com/Gross_Behe_Review_10.2007.pdf

The only &quot;bombshell,&quot; however, is the towel
thrown in on creationist convictions.  Larry
Arnhart, a political scientist and advocate
of &quot;Darwinian conservatism,&quot; writes for his
blog: &quot;[T]he most remarkable feature of the
book is [Behe's] attack on Biblical
creationism. ... Behe says that to treat the
Bible as a 'science textbook' is 'silly.'
...  In embracing Darwinian common descent,
Behe accepts the idea that human beings
evolved from primate ancestors shared with
the Chimpanzees ... so Behe agrees with
Darwin's declaration that the human species
was 'created from animals.' ... Behe also
_doubts the power and morality of the
intelligent designer_ ...&quot; (my emphasis).
The qualification seems to support Behe's
insistence that he is offering scientific,
as distinct from religious or metaphysical,
arguments.

Whee!

MICHAEL BEHE comes out directly in opposition to Ray
Martinez style brain dead biblical literalism!

Life is _so_ good.

xanthian.

Run to the rock, say, &quot;rock won't you hide me&quot;?
Rock say, &quot;treating the Bible as a 'science
textbook' is 'silly'&quot;.

Evolutionism is gonna get you Ray, yes, I believe
it will. So, does that make Michael Behe a &quot;Ray
Martinez atheist-evolutionist&quot; too? Why yes, by
all available evidence, I believe it does.

&quot;scant&quot; is used in English both as verb and as adjective. That

Apparently, scant was sometimes used as a verb in Middle English.
Unless your name is Shakespeare, you should not use it as a verb.

Nay, but grudgingly, and reserving the right to use it as a verb anyway
just as soon as I look up the correct archaic definition for 'scant' as
a verb (if there is one) because using archaic forms correctly is one of
those things that marks a harmless eccentricity, and I have scant
respect for folks who misuse archaic constructions in an effort to
appear erudite (as well as having a glorious unconcern for such
grammatical niceities as run-on sentences, though not to the extent of
Joyce and Ulysses, of course).

Do you enjoy appearing a fool in public?

Argument by assertion fails in the face of
evidence, here as ever; notice the four _separate_
gradations of meanings of &quot;scant&quot; as a verb:

Next time, before arguing vocabulary, learn
some. Notice, above, &quot;your ignorance doesn't

I just don't want the win /or/ lose to be misspelled.  It's
humiliating.  And self-undermining, really.  Of course that didn't
stop my own misspelling, but you know how that is.

I haven't done the count, but my impression is that the verb thing is
running roughly fifty-fifty, not counting the lurkers of course  :-)
Supplementary question, perhaps: of three or more verb definitions /
preserved/ in dictionaries, which do you think is intended?

How about &quot;filleted&quot;, &quot;gutted&quot;, etc. If I wanted to tease I'd say
&quot;decimated&quot;.  But I don't.

Since it has now been discovered the document was originally composed
in 1895 I will cut it some slack  :-)

&gt; &gt; Of course &quot;scant&quot; is not a verb; it is an adjective!

&gt; Overview of verb scant:

&gt; The verb scant has 3 senses (no senses from tagged texts)

&gt; 1. skimp, scant -- (work hastily or carelessly; deal with inadequately
&gt; and superficially)

&gt; 2. scant, skimp -- (limit in quality or quantity)

&gt; 3. stint, skimp, scant -- (supply sparingly and with restricted
&gt; quantities; &quot;sting with the allowance&quot;)

&gt; Overview of adj scant:

&gt; The adj scant has 1 sense (first 1 from tagged texts)

&gt; 1. (2) light, scant, short -- (less than the correct or legal or full
&gt; amount often deliberately so; &quot;a light pound&quot;; &quot;a scant cup of sugar&quot;;
&gt; &quot;regularly gives short weight&quot;)

That is _one_ dictionary's take on it. I have seen others with
4 adjectival, 2 verbal and 1 adverbial (Scots, of course!) use
cited.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Klaus

&gt; &gt; &quot;scant&quot; is used in English both as verb and as adjective. That
&gt; &gt; you may be unaware of the usage does not make it non-existent.
&gt; &gt; It is quite standard, just not particularly colloquial in
&gt; &gt; America.

&gt; Apparently, scant was sometimes used as a verb in Middle English.
&gt; Unless your name is Shakespeare, you should not use it as a verb.

&gt; http://www.answers.com/topic/scant
&gt; http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/scant
">

Middle English (or earlier, it derives from Old Norse, so I'd expect
it to have been in OE even if there is no attestation), and all
later usage. I've read it more than heard it, but it is definitely
ordinary 20th century usage, though it may by now be on the way
out. Yes, the adjective is more frequent; so? Shakespeare is hardly
the latest writer of good English who uses it!

Yea, in the most practical sense.  Irrespective of dictionaries,
my family has used it as such since my childhood.

Some uses become less common, some more, over time.  But I
certainly reject that there's any need for me to quit using a
word just because others don't use it as much as once.  Words
can revive.  Conversely, just because others do use some words
a lot is no particular reason for me to do so.

&gt; The primary document, the original review, is a lot
&gt; more fun than that gloss you URLed; &quot;how sharper
&gt; than a serpent's tongue&quot;:

&gt; http://www.creationismstrojanhorse.com/Gross_Behe_Review_10.2007.pdf

&gt;         The only &quot;bombshell,&quot; however, is the towel
&gt;         thrown in on creationist convictions.  Larry
&gt;         Arnhart, a political scientist and advocate
&gt;         of &quot;Darwinian conservatism,&quot; writes for his
&gt;         blog: &quot;[T]he most remarkable feature of the
&gt;         book is [Behe's] attack on Biblical
&gt;         creationism. ... Behe says that to treat the
&gt;         Bible as a 'science textbook' is 'silly.'
&gt;         ...  In embracing Darwinian common descent,
&gt;         Behe accepts the idea that human beings
&gt;         evolved from primate ancestors shared with
&gt;         the Chimpanzees ... so Behe agrees with
&gt;         Darwin's declaration that the human species
&gt;         was 'created from animals.' ... Behe also
&gt;         _doubts the power and morality of the
&gt;         intelligent designer_ ...&quot; (my emphasis).
&gt;         The qualification seems to support Behe's
&gt;         insistence that he is offering scientific,
&gt;         as distinct from religious or metaphysical,
&gt;         arguments.

&gt; Whee!

&gt; MICHAEL BEHE comes out directly in opposition to Ray
&gt; Martinez style brain dead biblical literalism!

&gt; Life is _so_ good.

Well, although you're probably right in counting me as a &quot;yea&quot; I'm
fairly soft as well. I was trying to be cute with the outdated
language as well as poke a little fun at those (meaning myself) who
enjoy dabbling now and then in words that are &quot;proper&quot; or a bit
&quot;olde,&quot; but reject neologisms or changes with fashion.

Like many here, I quite enjoy and respect erudite use of language. But
I have been chided often by my daughter, one of whose degrees is in
Linguistics, for being too stuffy in my resistance to language
variance and usage. She points out that where I see laziness and
sloppy communication skills what I perhaps should be recognizing is
language evolution and what I should be asking is if those who raise
my ire are actually trying to communicate with *me*.

She's probably right about much of this. I suspect I lean too heavily
on the idea that there are standards by which those who speak and
write should be measured. But what I really can't stand (and what is
probably my main motivation in seeing her side of this) is that my
initial reactions betray a frustration that I once vowed I'd never
indulge, as in: &quot;You kids these days, with your _____.&quot;

I consulted 2 dictionaries, which I cited in this thread, that claim
that the use of scant as a verb was archaic (Middle English).
However, I also admitted I was wrong, after further research.

My standard is, does it aid (or at least, not impede) communication?

A nearby store, for example, now sells &quot;business furniture solutions&quot;

Don't scant my milk.  (Don't pour me a short glass of milk.)

The sense is more typically given by using 'short' as a verb instead
of scant (Don't short my change/milk/...)

Falls in to same mental grouping (for me) as skint as well.  Though
that's more a state of being than an active word.  Or not.  Comes
to mind that my grandmother said 'Don't be skint with ...' more than
a time or two.  Wouldn't be surprising if I'd used it that way too.

Klaus's bit of fun has a real point (for me, at least).  I probably
have used in speech every word of his samples.  Not all at one go,
perhaps, but all of them.  The thing is, much is said about English
having an enormous vocabulary.  This is certainly true if you look

&gt; &gt; Argument by assertion fails in the face of

&gt; &gt; Next time, before arguing vocabulary, learn

&gt; I consulted 2 dictionaries, which I cited in this thread, that claim
&gt; that the use of scant as a verb was archaic (Middle English).
&gt; However, I also admitted I was wrong, after further research.

That's interesting.  I'd have said &quot;skint&quot; was Scots, but the Internet

Just two?

&quot;The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that
English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don't just borrow words;
on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat
them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.&quot;

Why shouldn't Cockneys be able to borrow a word if they feel like it?
Even if the word were Scots in origin, which sounds plausible, that's
no bar to it making its way into my family vocabulary.  We probably have
some Scots in the tree somewhere (one 'known' one being a pre-revolutionary
fellow on that grandmother's side of my tree).  Give a bit of language
conservatism and it makes its way down to me, a mere 2.5 centuries after
his immigration.

Even if we didn't have any Scots in our tree, we certainly have had
contact, and we have a history (at least back to this grandmother's
mother) of being word-acquisitive and -creative.

One the thing is, words make their way around with much greater
abandon than you'd ever guess by documents, or by assumptions of origins.
English speaking North Americans would be particularly good places to
find usages brought in to the language from disparate locales, and which
never made their way in to the Queen's English (whatever that winds up
being exactly).

A different one is, I think many families have usages that they seldom
use outside the family, but which are fairly common inside the group.
Certainly true of us.  While we're weird, I don't think this is a fundamental
weirdness (possibly we take it farther than most).  These words used
mostly inside the family may well show up in many families, but still
not enter written use, nor public speech.  So, while the word is
more or less common, it's invisible to dictionaries.

In addition to four adjective and adverb definitions, Dictionary.com
gives three verb definitions:

-verb (used with object)
5. to make scant; diminish.
6. to stint the supply of; withhold.
7. to treat slightly or inadequately.

also:

tr.v.   scant?ed, scant?ing, scants
1. To give an inadequate portion or allowance to: had to scant the
older children in order to nourish the newborn.
2. To limit, as in amount or share; stint: Our leisure time is
scanted by this demanding job.
3. To deal with or treat inadequately or neglectfully; slight.

So i guess the answer to your query is yes, &quot;scant&quot; is a verb.
