My main repair customer has gone hog wild buying any cheap used Grundig
he can find (usually on Ebay). He then hands them over to be
fixed/restored/recapped/evaluated...

My poor workbench is beginning to sag under the weight.. I have zero
technical literature ... bama and nostalgia don't seem to help..

These are mostly tube sets from the mid-fifties to mid-sixties..

sams has some sporadic Grundig coverage ... but seeing it listed in the
index doesn't help figuring me in figuring out where the ferrite bar
connections were..before the rubber bands broke...etc. etc.

So my question is does anyone know of a source of grundig majestic
service literature?

A cd covering many models would probably work well.. Or ... well what do
you know about. I have googled until I can hardly see and still
havent a clue.

I repair many German sets.  I have all the SAMS up to 600 in my shop, and
since most of the German sets were imported here 1957-1964, there are
probably 200+ German schematics in there for those.    IF the exact set
wasnt covered by SAMS, I  leaf around until I find the set that is most like
the one at hand.  For most restorations,  its still the same as with USA
radios... recap, recap, recap.   Test the tubes, clean and/or lube the
controls, clean the tuner, check for correct fuse, replace bad SS rectifier
bridges, bench test and align as needed.

You need to sign up at www.radiomuseum.org .  I normally only suggest this to
others.  However, with your situation is sounds like the money (I think $15
or $20 or upload a bunch of good pictures) used to register would be well
spent.  I also believe they have a deal going for those who contribute to
the web site so no money is required.  But I may be mistaken. You will have
to ask.

From the web site:
"How to have it waived:
Please read further down what members can do for RMorg. If you like what you
see, proceed as prescribed under Option 2 with the difference, that instead
of putting cash in the envelope or using PayPal you will give us a brief
written statement by postal service as to what you can and are willing to do
for RMorg. "

Follow the membership button.

If  you look at this link
( http://www.radiomuseum.org/forum/grundig_5088_usa_componant_and_align... )
or do a search on my name you will see the fantastic help that I have
received at Radiomuseum.org.

Also see http://www.ppinyot.com/Grundig5088/grundig.htm and other pages.

This is kind of how I have been dealing. Ironically before taking a 20 year
hiatus from the repair trade, I disposed of aprox. 5 file drawers full
of Sams
(heavily television oriented) I guess that was my contribution to
present day Ebay prices..

Because of personal interest I did save a few sheets that had shortwave
coverage.. includes only 4 grundig.. None of which has showed up (yet)

Thanks for the answer.

Good afternoon Erich,

I dabble a bit with old German radios occasionally, and have found a
couple of Web sites (in addition to Radio Museum) that can be of some help:

http://home.arcor.de/walter.groer/index_e.htm

http://www.oldradioworld.de

Both sites are run by Deutschers who are collectors, restorers, sources
of schematics, some parts, etc. Both sites are optionally in English
(mostly, sorta) and I have found them to be quite helpful.

Hope this is of assistance!

Jeez, gang, my apologies for the quad post! I was trying to address the
OP, whose addy was munged, and never did make it. Meanwhile, all my
attempts went to the group - groan.
