His looks nicer than mine, mine looks skinny. This is the last one I
caught a couple of weeks ago in the mouth of the CT River. As if you
didn't know;)

He was turned into fried poppers, not bad for a blue, eating wise.

I saw the same thing.   But based on his locale,  I doubt Scot would be
fishing in shorts and a t-shirt in January.  ;-)

It's not a Parker. Dunno what it is. Looks like a cheaply finished boat,

Ok, really bad video. I had a LED headlamp for light, and a handheld
cheapie camera so ya gets what you get. I was fishing near the mouth
of the CT River, probably 2:30, maybe 3am in a low transom Brockway.
Anchor fishing, chunks of bunker for bait, bottom, incoming tide,
water temp, 72F iirc. I had just finished with a big blue, pictured
above, then two sharks, all in about 15 minutes, this being the
second. I shut off the video to try to get him released. Little tricky
with my dog in the boat, but I got him in and measured him at 42
inches. Fortunately, my dog does not get curious about much and
generally does not bother with fish I pull in so he was cool, no teeth
marks. Anyway, here is a short clip and a couple of pics.

Warning, coarse language in video. The F bomb was used freely, be
advised.

You want sarcastic?

Any moron can catch a dog fish - they eat anything and hook
themselves.  [1]

There - how's that?  :&gt;)

Actually, no.  I've been dealing with imbeciles all day and I'm worn

Sometimes, Going Postal is a viable option.  :&gt;)

[1] However, they are delicious.  If you get a nice heavy one, it's
worth the time to filet.  They fry up great - nice and tender, sweet
and with a corn meal/beer batter - mmmmmm...

The English use them in their fish and chips.

Dogfish are fun to catch on really light tackle. Used to catch a dozen
of 'em a day while drift fishing off the beaches of Jacksonville. Might
have been the Spiny Dogfish variety. Averaged about 10 pounds.

it up to shore and saw the thing, screw that, have some tackle dude,
cut the line;) Me and my little trout poles, heh... And if I tell you

I'm down to five spinning and conventional fishing rods and six reels. A
buddy &quot;lost&quot; my &quot;bait rod and reel&quot; while we were fishing for spot a few
weeks ago. I was in the bow, playing around with my cast net. I have no
idea what happened. All I heard was &quot;Oh...sh*t,&quot; and when I turned
around the gear was gone in about 20' of water. This was annoying, as it
was a really nice light Star rod and Penn 4300SS, close to $250 worth of
gear. But he immediately offered to take me up to Bass Pro some crappy
day this winter and replace it... :&gt;}

Only one of my conventional outfits is even mildly &quot;heavy&quot; gear...a
trolling rod setup with a Shimano lever drag reel.

I don't anyone use my fly rods.

Well, for one thing, you haven't seen his rods.  I felt so bad for him
that I gave him one that actually had some heft to it.  :&gt;)

Secondly, I make most of my own gear and am very partial to Ugly
Sticks.  However now that you can't get their blanks, I use Loomis rod
blanks.

Third, it would seem to me that you have me confused with somebody
else.

Which figures being a cement expert, you have a head full of it.

&gt;&gt; That's because SW hates anything that isn't his, or he didn't say, or
&gt;&gt; he didn't come up with. Hell, if he doesn't like something, he even
&gt;&gt; gets a rag on if someone else DOES!

&gt; Well, for one thing, you haven't seen his rods.  I felt so bad for him
&gt; that I gave him one that actually had some heft to it.  :&gt;)

&gt; Secondly, I make most of my own gear and am very partial to Ugly
&gt; Sticks.  However now that you can't get their blanks, I use Loomis rod
&gt; blanks.

&gt; Third, it would seem to me that you have me confused with somebody
&gt; else.

My wife's fishing rod is an Ugly Stick, with a Penn 5500SS spinning
reel. She likes it and I have to admit, it has stood up to an awful lot
of female fisherperson abuse.

I like &quot;Star&quot; rods, but I've had decent luck with a couple of Shimanos.

Guy here was going to build a rod for me...don't know what happened to
him. Must be out boating with Skipper.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Wow, that was not even slightly sarcastic
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; You want sarcastic?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Any moron can catch a dog fish - they eat anything and hook

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; There - how's that?  :&gt;)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; , did we wake you up?  ;)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Actually, no.  I've been dealing with imbeciles all day and I'm worn
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; out.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes, Going Postal is a viable option.  :&gt;)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; [1] However, they are delicious.  If you get a nice heavy one, it's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; worth the time to filet.  They fry up great - nice and tender, sweet
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and with a corn meal/beer batter - mmmmmm...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The English use them in their fish and chips.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ironic ain't it? The whole teeth thing, sharks and the English;)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope you kicked some ass!

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dogfish are fun to catch on really light tackle. Used to catch a dozen
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of 'em a day while drift fishing off the beaches of Jacksonville. Might
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have been the Spiny Dogfish variety. Averaged about 10 pounds.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt;&gt; First time I caught one was when I first moved down to the shore. I
&gt; &gt;&gt; was out on Westbrook beach, way out on the rocks, alone, at night. Got
&gt; &gt;&gt; it up to shore and saw the thing, screw that, have some tackle dude,
&gt; &gt;&gt; cut the line;) Me and my little trout poles, heh... And if I tell you

I used to make rods, when I lived up north for an indoor hobby. I
don't care much for Ugly Sticks. I've got two for catfishing, there
tough as hell, I'll say that.

No, I don't have you confused. Anything anybody says here, you either
have more knowledge of, have a better one, etc. Then anything anybody
else has isn't any good. Just ask you!
