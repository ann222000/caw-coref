Real post - Stylus for 78s? (again)
</HEADLINE>

I'm grateful to Gary and Bill for their insightful answers to my post,
pre-deluge. The higher-tracking-force Stanton (500) sounds like an
excellent thought. As to the broader width of the Expert Stylus Co.
products -- that certainly seems to be part of the idea, but -- wouldn't
*any* 78-optimized stylus want to be similarly broad??

In case any other initiates, missing the earlier post, might have
comments, here's my original query:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Given the expertise present here, I thought I'd ask for help with this.

&gt; I've read that many knowledgeable listeners/transferrers of 78s get very
&gt; specialized styli from Expert Stylus Company in the UK.

&gt; However -- if my interest is in 78s not earlier than the '40s, might I do
&gt; OK with a 78 stylus from Shure or Stanton, for their respective
&gt; cartridges?

&gt; Second, I've got a spare Shure V15 Type IV cartridge, for which the
&gt; Shure N78S stylus is available -- but have read that people get better
&gt; results with the low-cost Shure M44 cartridge. Any thoughts on this?
">

[V15 usefully ruled out by Bill; I've got a good arm, but undamped]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; An elliptical 78 stylus for the M44 is available here --

&gt; http://www.esotericsound.com/CartStyli.htm

&gt; Otherwise, I've only found spherical models for that cart.

&gt; The Shure M78S cartridge is exclusively for 78s and looks like it might
&gt; be largely the same as the M44.

&gt; Any wisdom will be gratefully received. Including completely different
&gt; suggestions.

Thx,
SE.

Hello again Steve -

I do not think that the M-44 and M78S are the same.  The M78S is hard
wired mono only and explicitly designed to fill the gap of 'generic'
78 collectors playback. The M-44 is (or was) designed for both use in
LP and 78 work. For many years the M-44 was highly regarded for early
LP transfer work - a good balance between trackability and
(relatively) low stylus weight.

I went to Shure's website and was (unpleasantly) surprised that they
no longer offer the M-44. That brings into question replacement
concerns. Mike Stosich (Esoteric) offers the M-44 and a custom
elliptical 78 stylus now, but what about the future?

I want to make this clear: This in no way casts doubt on Mike's
business or product he offers. Currently I am considering the purchase
of his Rek-O-Cut transcription table and arm. And I own his Sonic Re-
equalizer and use that great product ALL the time. (Which, BTW, you
may wish to consider for your needs, as those 1940's 78 records are
all pre-RIAA equalization standard)  But how many M-44's does he have
if yours gives up the ghost, and who grinds his special elliptical
stylus?

Looking at the price differential between the Stanton and the M-44,
there is a minimal difference. So I will again lean towards the
Stanton, even with Gary's caveats noted on an earlier post.

I would suggest that you contact Mike via e-mail regarding his
elliptical styli for both the Stanton and the Shure. Looking at his
website he does not mention truncated elliptical styli. But, IMO for
your particular needs, a truncated elliptical, while desirable,  may
not warrant additional costs.

As for Expert Stylus, they are a wonderful group, dedicated to
offering the highest quality product available. They provide only
custom retipping service (you provide original stylus), or offer new
styli ground to specific criteria. But that level of expertise comes
at a hefty price, and a rather long wait.

- Bill

Bill:  I purchased the Rek-O-Cut transcription table and arm from Mike
Stosich several months ago and am enjoying this new set-up
tremendously.  I dare say that I'm enjoying this turntable more than
my Technics SP-15.  Just my $0.02

I've had neither the hefty price nor the long wait when dealing with
Expert, both when I was in the UK and since moving to France. I'd
wholeheartedly recommend phoning and talking with them about you
requirements and budget.

They've supplied me with two M-44 cartridges and about 10 stylii of
varying shapes and sizes, as well as a number of other more esoteric
products. They've always been very helpful and totally reliable!

Question... As you're providing the stylus assembly, what does Expert Stylus
do about dried-out or otherwise deteriorated damping?

You'd really need to ask them directly - I guess there are limits as to
what they can do, but as it's not a problem I've had I really don't know.

Thanks Andrew -

No knock intended against Expert superior quality. But years ago when
I had my 78 styli retipped, it took almost 3 months to get them back.
Expert must have styli ready in stock for immediate purchase. Could be
an issue of MTO vs MTS for lead times. (I forgot about their selling
cartridge bodies as well.)

As for the price, well, I am a bit of a cheap bast...ah, well, let's
not go there...

Stanton 500 vs M-44, do you have a preference for 78 work?

HERESY! :-)

Seriously, is that the Rondine 3? It looks like a fine setup. As an
alternative I was thinking of pressing my old Dual 1229 back into
service, and buying the transcriptor arm separately for 16&quot; work. The
thing is, I own no transcription discs. But you never know what can
come up!

Haven't tried the Stanton, and aside from one small problem the Shure
has been fine. It gets a lot of stylus changes and seems to cope well!
The discs are vacuum cleaned before playing and all the styli are
truncated so I don't run it heavy - it's currently set to about 2.2g. No
complaints here!

Thanks Andrew,

Nice to know that Shure is still looked on favorably by professionals.
I have been nudging people towards the Stanton cartridge (due in part
to availability concerns) even though I use Shure products myself -
Great phono products and a little 'neighborhood support'...when I was
consulting for them I could walk to their headquarters from were I
live!
