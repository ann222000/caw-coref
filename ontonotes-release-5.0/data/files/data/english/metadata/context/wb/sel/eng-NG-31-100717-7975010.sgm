&quot;What are we supposed to do with our Dead?&quot; Odds n' Ends in the War on
Terror

Part 1; Bush to Putin: &quot;Let them eat cake&quot;

Much has been made of the chummy relationship between George Bush and
Russian President Vladimir Putin. An incident, which was reported last week
in the &quot;UK Spectator&quot;, shows that this so-called &quot;man-to-man&quot; friendship is
a complete fraud created by the Washington press corps to conceal the real
issues and to perpetuate the illusion that Bush is a normal guy.

You be the judge:

&quot;Six years ago, when George W. Bush first hosted Mr Putin at his ranch in
Texas, he famously claimed to have seen into his soul. At the time he
phrased it slightly differently to an adviser, unaware that his microphone
was still live and his remarks were being broadcast over the speaker system
in the next room. 'I've got him eating out of my hand,' the President
whispered. 'You give these Russkies some cake and they'll give you their
souls.'&quot; (Fraser Nelson &quot;The Cold War is back&quot; UK Spectator)

Spoken like a true friend, eh?

Part 2; Israel's Friends on the Hill

For readers who may have missed the recent events on Capital Hill, there was
this interesting tidbit which appeared The Jerusalem Post:

&quot;The US House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution Wednesday
afternoon condemning a British call to boycott Israeli universities. The
measure, approved 414 to 0, urged the European Union and governments around
the world to reject the call by the leadership of the University and College
Union of the United Kingdom to cease cooperation with Israeli institutions&quot;.

Always nice to see diversity of opinion on these key humanitarian issues,
isn't it? Congress has been equally supportive of the punitive measures
which have prevented food and medicine from entering the Gaza Strip in clear
violation of the Geneva Conventions.

Congress has no problem approving &quot;collective punishment&quot; or any other
internationally-condemned behavior as long as it serves the greater
interests of Israel. Ironically, you would never see such unanimity on any
issue among the members of the Israeli Knesset.

Part 3; Iranian Jews would rather stay in Iran?!?

An article which appeared last week in the UK Guardian is intriguing in many
respects:&gt;

&quot;Iran's Jews have given the country a loyalty pledge in the face of cash
offers aimed at encouraging them to move to Israel, the arch-enemy of its
Islamic rulers. The incentives - ranging from £5,000 a person to £30,000 for
families - were offered from a special fund established by wealthy
expatriate Jews in an effort to prompt a mass migration to Israel from among
Iran's 25,000-strong Jewish community. The offers were made with Israel's
official blessing and were additional to the usual state packages it
provides to Jews emigrating from the Diaspora.&quot;

The treatment of Jews in Iran presents a shocking contrast to the way
Palestinians are treated in the Occupied Territories. As the Guardian notes,
there are roughly 25,000 Jews in Iran and they seem to be quite happy
despite allegations in the western press that their president is a raving
anti-Semite. Could it just be another example of the media demonizing
someone who dares to control his country's own vast resources?

Who knows? But Iranian Jews certainly have not suffered the daily brutality
that Palestinians have in the Occupied Territories.

Jewish Iranians were declared a &quot;protected minority&quot; by the late Ayatollah
Khomeini. They are not persecuted. They do not have to endure humiliating
checkpoints and they are not dragged off to prison and tortured without
charges. Their homes are not randomly bulldozed, F-16s do not fire missiles
into their civilian areas and they are not treated as second class citizens.
Compared to Gaza, Iran is Nirvana. In Tehran there are 6 kosher butcher
shops, numerous Jewish schools, and a number of temples.

For the most part, they are loyal Iranians who love their country and are
determined to stay. The worrisome implication of the Guardian's article is
that it suggests that Israel may be planning an attack on Iran ---in which
case they may be hurrying to evacuate Jews from Tehran.

Part 4; If Iran is Attacked, will anyone Help? If the United States attacks
Iran preemptively (a third carrier moved into the Gulf just last week) how
would the other nations react?

We don't know---but we do know that the signatories of the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty do have certain obligations. As Gordon Prather
points out in his article &quot;More Neocrazy Media Sycophancy&quot; (antiwar.com)

&quot;The [Sixth] Conference notes the reaffirmation by the nuclear-weapon states
of their commitment to the United Nations Security Council resolution 984
(1995) on security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon states parties to the
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons.&quot; (excerpt from the 2000
NPT Review Conference)

So, what does that mean?

As Prather says:

&quot;Well, basically Russia and China, as well as France and the United Kingdom,
will &quot;provide immediate assistance&quot; to Iran if it &quot;is a victim of an act, or
an object of a threat of, aggression in which nuclear weapons are used.&quot;

Interesting, eh? So if Bush-Cheney bomb Iran, the other NPT members are
required under international law TO DEFEND IRAN. That might be worth a
follow-up to see if they honor that commitment.

Part 5 ; Russia Redux

This week Russian President Putin suspended his country's participation in
the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, a pact which limited
military forces in Europe. Putin's withdrawal is a response to Bush's plan
to put US Missile Defense systems in Eastern Europe which poses a threat to
Russia's national security.

By repealing the treaty, Putin is free to move troops, tanks and heavy
artillery back into the de-militarized zone along Russia's western flank.
This is bound to rouse the anxieties of peace-loving Euopeons. At the same
time, Putin is threatening to place short-range nuclear missiles in
Kallingrad a small Russian-owned province just north of Poland. The EU and
NATO will now have to decide whether they want to go ahead with Washington's
provocative missile defense scheme or reestablish peaceful relations with
the nation that provides 40% of their energy supplies. That shouldn't be a
difficult choice unless the Germans and French choose to live in the dark
like Baghdadis.

Putin will continue to tighten the noose until Bush publicly abandons his
reckless plans. Realistically, the Russian president has no other option. He
cannot allow the MDS to be deployed.

On a related topic:

&quot;Putin (recently) tested a weapon deadlier than anything developed by the
Soviet Union. A missile launched from a submarine in the White Sea entered
the stratosphere and returned precisely on target 3,800 miles away in the
Russian Far East - the other side of the world. .It signaled that Russia
means business. After a hiatus of two decades, the arms race is back.
(Fraser Nelson &quot;The Cold War is back&quot; UK Spectator)

Putin has succeeded in building strong alliances with his Central Asian
neighbors through the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as well as
consolidating the vast deposits of natural gas and oil which are mainly
transported through Russian pipelines. He is no longer the &quot;junior partner&quot;
that Washington had hoped for originally. Instead, has become the &quot;Glavny
protivnik&quot;, the &quot;main enemy&quot; of the empire encroaching on the last reserves
of dwindling energy supplies in Eurasia while rebuilding his military power.

We should expect a steady escalation in the rhetoric and threats.

Part 6; Iran forces Japan to pay in yen

This week, &quot;Iran asked Japan refiners to switch to the yen to pay for all
crude oil purchases, after Iran's central bank said it is reducing its
holdings of the US dollar.&quot; (Bloomberg News) . The new arrangement will be
&quot;effective immediately&quot; leaving Japan---which is 100% dependent on foreign
imports for its oil-with no opportunity to negotiate.

Iran's move is a &quot;double whammy&quot; for the US. It puts more downward pressure
on the already-weakening dollar and it increases the value of the yen which
is vital to stock market liquidity.

This is a smart move on Iran's part. While Cheney is moving his aircraft
carriers into the Gulf and conducting guerilla operations inside Iran, the
Mullahs have concocted a plan to strike at America's most vulnerable
spot--the anemic greenback.

The Japanese have been manipulating their currency for years to increase
their exports and keep the Japanese worker in a permanent state of poverty.
The world's second biggest economy serves as Wall Street's banker providing
tens of trillions in cheap loans to keep the over-leveraged stock market
flying high. Last February, when Japan raised its rates overnight, Wall
Street plummeted 500 points in a matter of minutes. The US stock market is
addicted to regular infusions of cheap Japanese capital and can't survive
without it.

Europac's Peter Schiff sums it up like this:

&quot;The Japanese realize that if they stop the flow of global liquidity they
will destroy the dollar and the U.S. economy. To survive, the U.S. must be
able to both limitlessly exchange the dollars it prints for the goods the
rest of the world makes and then pay low rates of interest on its IOU's that
foreigners accumulate as a result.A real rate of interest on the yen would
reverse the carry trade by creating demand for Japanese assets and
diminishing demand for dollar denominated assets. Such a move would
simultaneously send U.S. interest rates and consumer prices thought the roof
and stock and real estate prices through the floor. The entire U.S. consumer
economy would collapse and Americans would experience the greatest period of
economic hardship since the Great Depression.&quot;

That's the long and short of it; if the yen goes up (causing the &quot;carry
trade&quot; to unwind) liquidity will dry up, panic will set in, and the stock
market will crash.

Iran's announcement was lost in the flurry of Iraq-related news, but it is a
serious development all the same. It adds to the growing list of problems
facing the rickety US economy. As the Bush-Paulson plan to devalue the
dollar goes into high-gear; its shortcomings are becoming more obvious. More
and more countries are trimming their USD reserves--converting to the euro
and buying gold-and its becoming clearer that the US will lose its special
role as the world's &quot;reserve currency&quot;. Soon, the $550 billion of borrowed
money which fuels the American war-machine--via the $800 billion current
account deficit--will peter out forcing the US to rebuild its hobbled
manufacturing sector to create an export-based economy. The slowdown in the
purchase of dollar-based assets has already begun. On top of that, Uncle Sam
is no longer a credit-worthy applicant.

Putin has been leading the attack on the dollar seeing it as the best way to
undermine Bush's military shenanigans. Elaine Supkis makes this illuminating
entry on her blog site &quot;Money Matters&quot;:

&quot;Russia has been examining plans to price the Urals oil export blend in
rubles to curb currency risks. The nation plans to open the Energy Stock
Exchange in St. Petersburg in the first half of next year to trade oil in
rubles.&quot;

Iran is following a similar strategy, threatening to open an oil bourse
sometime in the next year. (although the &quot;kick off&quot; date keeps changing) The
days of dollar hegemony are numbered.

Part 7; Iraqi Child Prostitution on the rise:

MSNBC has come up with a video of Iraqi women who have been forced into
prostitution to survive as refugees in Syria. Bush's &quot;Democratic Revolution&quot;
in Iraq has produced some dismal results, but the story of young girls-some
only 6 years old---being exploited takes the cake. It is both appalling and
heartbreaking. The video is served up with typical western-media
cynicism--as though America played no part in this latest horror story from
Iraq.

Part 8; Another Journalist Killed in Iraq under suspicious circumstances

In an article by veteran author Chris Floyd (&quot;One in a Million; More on the
killing of Khalid Hassan&quot;) we hear about the killing of New York Times
reporter Khalid Hassan, in Baghdad. Hassan will join the more than one
hundred other journalists who have been shot dead during the US-led
occupation.

Floyd says:

&quot;He was apparently gunned down by militiamen after his car had been diverted
into the backstreets by an American roadblock. It was a two-stage hit; he
was forced off the road by a black Mercedes and shot, but survived. As he
was calling his mother to say that he was OK, a second car came along,
carrying a gunman who shot Hassan twice more and killed him. NY Times
reporter &quot;Burns notes that Shiite extremists have been entering Hassan's
district in police uniforms, then changing into mufti to carry out their
killings. Thus they are almost certainly Iraqi policemen who have been
TRAINED, ARMED AND PAID BY AMERICAN FORCES.&quot;

'nuff said.

Part 9; Al Qaida: &quot;They're Everywhere!&quot;

In a White House speech this week, President Bush reiterated his pet fantasy
that we are fighting &quot;the same people&quot; in Iraq who attacked the Twin Towers
on September 11. This isn't a theme that Bush is likely to abandon as it
provides the last, feeble justification for the ongoing-blitz in Iraq.

There was a good article in the LA Times by Ned Parker which helps to shed
some light on the &quot;miniscule&quot; role of foreign fighters in Iraq.

Parker states: &quot;Of the 19,000 &quot;insurgents&quot; held by the US military in Iraq,
only 135 are foreigners.&quot;

In other words, al Qaida is just not a significant part of the so-called
&quot;insurgency&quot;. In fact, only 7% of detainees are foreign fighters.

The US is fighting a Sunni-led army of resistance in Iraq. They are not
allied to Bin Laden or al Qaida.

So, which country is providing most of the foreign suicide bombers?

Saudi Arabia. (Although no one in the Bush administration has called for
bombing Riyadh!)

Repeat: There is no significant cadre of foreign &quot;al-Qaeda&quot; fighters in
Iraq .&quot;Everything Bush and Cheney have said about the nature of the war and
the supposed dangers of a US withdrawal is transparent falsehood.&quot; (

Part 10; Bombs Away: Beefing up the air war

The Associated Press reported this week that the Air Force is building up
its force-capability in Iraq. According to Charles Hanley, the Air Force

&quot;sharply stepped up bombing and laid a foundation for a sustained air
campaign in support of American and Iraqi forces..Squadrons of attack planes
have been added to the in-country fleet. The air reconnaissance arm has
almost doubled since last year. The powerful B1-B bomber has been recalled
to action over Iraq.

&quot;The night before last we had 14 strikes from B-1 bombers. Last night we had
18 strikes by B-1 bombers,&quot; Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch said approvingly of air
support his 3rd Infantry Division received in a recent offensive south of
Baghdad&quot;.

This tells us everything we need to know about Bush's future plans for Iraq.
B-1 bombers are not used for pinpoint attacks on &quot;terrorist strongholds&quot;.
That's bullsh**. They are used for carpet-bombing and vast indiscriminate
destruction which invariably causes massive civilian casualties.

The statistics confirm this assertion. There's been a fivefold increase of
bombs dropped over the first half of 2006 which proves that civilian carnage
has not deterred the military from trying to &quot;pacify&quot; the Iraqi people
through vicious, unrelenting bombardment.

The article continues:

&quot;The Air Force sent a squadron of A-10 &quot;Warthog&quot; attack planes - a dozen or
more aircraft - to be based at Al-Asad Air Base in western Iraq. At the same
time it added a squadron of F-16C Fighting Falcons here at Balad.&quot; Air
operations are constant with &quot;more than 100 aircraft crisscrossing Iraqi air
space at any one time.&quot;

As Bush is forced to reduce troop deployments, the &quot;air surge&quot; will continue
into the foreseeable future---poisoning the country with depleted uranium,
killing and maiming tens of thousands of civilians, and further reducing
Iraq's infrastructure into rubble.

The Democrats fully support this bloody &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy.

Part 11; A Word from one of the Victims

Iraqi blogger and poet Layla Anwar manages to express what many of us feel
about this ghastly war, but are unable to state in words. Here is a short
passage from a recent piece called &quot;Some Thoughts on Forgiveness&quot; Layla
Anwar)

&quot;What are we supposed to do with our dead ones, our injured ones, our
memories, our lost hopes, our vanished dreams?

What are we supposed to do with our exile, our losses, our uprootedness?

Christ was crucified once. He was able to forgive.

But you are crucifying us daily. So how do I forgive?&quot;

God help us for what we have done to the Iraqi people.
