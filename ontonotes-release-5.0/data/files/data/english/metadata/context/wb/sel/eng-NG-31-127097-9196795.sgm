As some of you know, I'm new to CPAP treatment and have been using a machine
for four nights now.  I thought I was adjusting to the therapy pretty well,
since I have no trouble falling asleep with the mask on my face and have
been feeling pretty good when I wake up - like I actually *did* get some
sleep.  I've been averaging about 6 hours of usage each night.

But I feel really tired today (like I used to, before I got the machine). If
I sit in front of the TV for a few minutes, I'll nod out.  Is this just a
normal part of getting used to the therapy (i.e., newbies have good nights
and bad nights) or is it indicative that the therapy isn't working as well
as it should and something needs tweaking (i.e., a different pressure
setting or mask)?  As far as I can tell, I'm not experiencing mask leaks.

I have a very basic machine, so I have no idea what's really happening while
I'm sleeping.  I know *something* positive is occurring, since I'm not
getting up to use the bathroom anymore.  But if the therapy is working as it
should, why am I so tired?  TIA

P.S.  I tried to send this post this a.m., but it never showed up.
Apologies if it posts twice.

i was UBER tired soon after starting to use CPAP, because i then felt the
sleep debt that i had to pay back

i also started to look FORWARD to going to bed, because i COULD sleep ! ! !

it may take you a while to pay off the sleep debt

good luck

Hi, Kate, and thanks for your response..

I can definitely relate to wanting to go to bed now.  I'll cross my fingers
that I get more rest tonight and have more energy tomorrow.

Any idea how long it usually takes before before a CPAP user starts to feel
good on a consistent basis?  Or is that a very individual thing, where
everyone's experience is different?

OK, several things here that are possibilities and effects.   You may
experience some or all of them.

- Sleep debt.    Repaying years of that.   Doesn't necessarily happen
in a linear way.    Sleep pattern.   Before therapy I would be in bed
for longer and especially at weekends.   Not good quality sleep but
timings obviously skewed. I'll give you a related example.   If I do a
west to east flight across say 8 time zones, that is quite disruptive.
I'll have not had a good night's sleep and so will sleep a lot the
following night.   Thus the debt is repayed but the pattern still has
to recover.   I reckon that that takes me a further week to full
change.    East to west is less of issue.  Point is that pattern is a
variable but powerful influence.

- Improved oxygen supply to the body during the night . Lack of
arousals. The not needing bathroom visits is typical.  This is rather
more vague in terms of being able to put in precise effect and
timescale, but most organs do better with a decent oxygen supply.  You
can look up studies related to the effects of apnoea on various bodily
functions and operation.  Some will be that if there is apnoea then for
example hypertension is more likely.  Take out apnoea and the other
might improve.   So you may see some short and medium terms
improvements - the longer term ones are harder to measure obviously.

- Have a look at sleep hygiene.

In general, after a few more days, start to average the effects of what
happens on a week by week basis rather than day by day.   Even when
there is good treatment going on, there is a day to day variation.
that can be sleeping position, drinking alcohol before bed, amount of
stress or activity during the day and so on.    On CPAP equipment that
records results, comparisons of overall effectiveness are done by
medical staff using the week by week and month by month data to look
for trends or consistency.     The daily results are useful for
spotting machine and mask issues if they are occuring.

Do an Epworth Sleepiness test yourself now (honestly) and write down
the results and put them away and forget about them.    Then in a
month's time repeat.  Go back and compare.

If you feel you need to change things - e.g. sleep hygiene or perhaps
you suspect a mask issue; change one thing at a time per night and do
it for several.    otherwise you will not know whether it was an issue
or not.

Got it in one. It is very individual.

Some people have an instant and persistent improvement.

Others have a honeymoon effect and then it seems to get worse again

Yet others have a far more subtle effect over weeks and even months.

You may never get total consistency, especially after sleep debt is
repayed.   However, keep in mind that people without apnoea have
variations in sleep patterns anyway.

After a week or two's use, try to focus week by week rather than day by
day unless you notice that you have several consecutive nights of poor
results.   In that case look for why, but change only one thing at a
time.

Makes sense.  I have no idea how long I've been dealing with untreated OSA,

I think I'm sleeping on my back most of the time.  My sleep study advised
against this, but the RT at the DME said my position shouldn't matter as
long as I'm using the machine.  (I think Jim is wrong about that, though.)
I find that both of the masks I have get pushed around when I'm on my side
(they both hit my pillow), and I have to make continuous adjustments in
order to sleep in that position without leaks.  So I think I'm spending the
majority of my time on my back because I don't have to fiddle with the mask.
But I'm achy, as a result.  I'm going to sew a pocket onto the back of a
t-shirt and put a tennis ball in there to keep me from sleeping on my back.
I suppose I'll need to readjust the straps on the headgear again, too, to
make the mask a bit tighter so it can't move out of place when I sleep on my
side.

I wish the whole process was easier all the way around, but I'm grateful
that there *is* a process in the first place.  I just have to find what
works for me.

Good advice, Andy, as usual.  I really appreciate your responses, as you're

Well.... generally the pressure to resolve OSA events is higher when
you are sleeping on your back.   Jim will probably argue that the
setting is high enough to address that and it may well be true.   OTOH,
higher pressures may result in reduced comfort.

As you say, some masks perform better if you are not sleeping on your
side in that they are less likely to leak.

The tennis ball strategy is an interesting one and would be a way to
check out the position thing.

Again note the point of changing one thing at a time.  :-)

Not to worry.  This issue doesn't consume me, but I'm sure you understand
that it *is* something I'd like to resolve as quickly as possible.  I know
the therapy is helping, but I'm on my own to make the treatment work as well
as it can.  This NG is very helpful and I do appreciate the wisdom and
experience to be found here, but I'll feel a lot better when the sleep
doctor is involved in my care.  For now, the journal will help me keep tabs
on my progress (or not) with whatever alterations I make, as my memory is
still fairly useless.

The pertinent part of my sleep study says:  &quot;By the end of the study, a CPAP
pressure of 12 cm H2O appeared effective at eliminating the majority of
obstructive respiratory events and maintaining good oxygen saturation (mean
saturation at this pressure was 95.8% with a low of 88%).  Although the RDI
at 12 cm H2O was still 19.8, the majority of the residual events were
sleep-onset cental/Cheyne-Stokes in origin and occurred during a brief
period while the patient was trying to return to sleep after an arousal.
There were, however, still several scattered hypopneas seen during
supine-REM sleep at the end of the study on 12 cm H2O.  Note that a pressure
of 9 cm H2O appeared adequate in the _non-supine_ position (including brief
REM sleep).&quot;

My impression is that I'm much better off not sleeping on my back.  Maybe my
pressure could eventually be reduced if I can retrain myself to sleep on my
side all the time.  I would have a difficult time adjusting to a higher
pressure than I have now, unless I had some kind of assistance on exhale.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'm thinking about trying the Liberty mask.  Do you know (or anyone else
who's reading) if the design is such that it's more accommodating for a side
sleeper than the masks I have now (Swift II pillows and Ultra Mirage FF)?
I've only seen the Liberty online, so I don't know how it compares,
size-wise, to what I already have.  But I think I'll ask Jim to order one so
I can try it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I tried to bolster myself in bed, laying on my side with pillows and a
rolled-up heavy blanket behind me to stop me from rolling over.  But it
didn't work, as I only had to scoot over a few inches from the bolster to
roll onto my back.  I'm sure the tennis-ball-in-the-back will annoy the hell
out of me, but I'm betting it will work.  And it will still allow me to
switch sides easily, which was not the case with the bolster.

Probably the best advice of all, Andy.  It would be impossible to tell what
was working and what wasn't if several changes were made at the same time.
Do you think a week is a long enough trial period to make a solid
determination about any given change in treatment?

BB, some masks are more resistant to moving when face-smushing than
others (e.g., the ResMed Mirage Activa and the Aeiomed Headrest with the
exhaust higher than any mask with which I am familiar).

While it is true most of us require more pressure while sleeping on our
backs, that is why sleep labs set the pressure with you on your back. So
the DME who said position should not matter is correct (less correct if
you had received an auto machine where side sleeping likely requires
less pressure).

Your commitment is impressive.

Andy, if I have been following BB's posts correctly, she has a basic M
Series machine. This is a fixed pressure machine so it was likely set
for the pressure she was sleeping on her back (as was mine). IOW, at
this point, if she moves to side sleeping, it won't change her pressure
(which is fixed) unless she convinces them to upgrade to the auto M
series (IMHO, a reason for such machines and why I am trying to get one).

BB, 5 different Liberty reviews from our AWAKE Group:

Liberty Evaluations

MANUFACTURER: ResMed
PRODUCT: Liberty

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: I was impressed with the cap. I was easily
adjustable, once adjusted it stays adjusted. It does not slide down over
your ears through any kind of movement.  The nose pillows are very
comfortable, and allow for movement without having to move the rest of
the headgear. The airflow blowing out the top is a nice feature. There
was very little contact with your face (actually quite open over the
bridge of your nose)

IMPRESSIONS OVER TIME: I appreciate the fact that you can move/adjust
the air pillows without moving the rest of the headgear. This allows for
minor adjustments, scratching an itch, etc. When moving throughout the
night, the headgear never yanks on your nose (like if you get the hose
caught on something). I find this headgear can easily be used in any
circumstance away from home (doesn't need a particular head board like
we have at home).

I ESPECIALLY LIKED: Generally, I have had better experience with nose
pillows. The pet peeves I've had with other nose pillow masks are cured
with this headset. My 2 main pet peeves have been the airflow spraying
out at my partner and movement during sleep yanking on my nose. The
airflow blows out the top, which never blows towards my partner or any
part of my body. The nose pillow set up allows for minor movement, and
any major jerks by the hose doesn't transmit to my nose.

I DID NOT LIKE: I basically love this mask. It is positively the best
mask I've ever used. The only thing I found was a build up moisture
inside the pillows when in a damp setting (I was camping in a tent) I
found it easy to fix by just pulling the pillow out of my nose (without
taking off the mask) and shaking out the water.

COMPARISON TO SIMILAR PRODUCTS:  The pet peeves I was referring to above
were from the Adams pillows. This mask is way better, in no way is the
Adams pillows better.

FINAL COMMENTS ON NOISE, LEAKS, FIT, COMFORT: Noise is not a problem,
very little leaks, and easily fixable when they happen, fits great and
is very comfortable. The rubber headgear can make it a little hot and
sometimes it does leave a line across my forehead.

WOULD YOU RECOMMEND DMEs RECOMMEND THIS MASK TO OTHERS: I definitely
would recommend this mask to others (I already have)

---------------------------
FIRST IMPRESSIONS: I liked many features of this mask...  It is compact
and does not block my vision and it was comfortable.   I did struggle
the first few nights to get it fitted properly.   This mask does not
seal well unless it fits properly on the top of your chin and the straps
for the chin adjustment must be fairly tight to make it stay in it's
right place.  If you do not do this
first, then you have a problem with comfort with the nasal pillows and
it will leak.

The first night I woke up (after my usual 2 hours of sleep) and could
not swallow my mouth was so dry.  The second night, I turned up my
heater on my CPAP machine and it was better but still dry so the third
night I turned it up as far as it would go and this seemed to help a lot.

IMPRESSIONS OVER TIME: After several days, I tried to get a little more
comfort out of the mask but that did not seem to work well.  I tried to
loosen the strap on the nasal pillows to get a little more comfort and
it helped some but my husband tells me he could hear the noise from the
mask from the den.  This tells me it was leaking...  Since I was
sleeping, I do not know if I was on my side or back.

I ESPECIALLY LIKED: I especially like the headgear...  It is the best I
have used. It was comfortable and seems to stay in place...  It did not
get hot, even in this 90+ weather and it was easy to take on and off and
simply to adjust. Also, liked the fact that the mask did not block my
vision.

I DID NOT LIKE: I did not like the fact that the mask leaked when I
rolled to my side... Usually I start out sleeping on my back but then
roll to my side. I usually do not sleep with a pillow so when I rolled
to my side it pushed the mask and made it leek...  It seemed to work
best if I stayed on my back...  So I used pillows and if I rolled to my
side, I tried to stay on the pillow... Sometimes it worked and sometimes
it did not...

COMPARISON TO SIMILAR PRODUCT: I have the Mirage Activa mask, and for
size and visibility, I like the Liberty...  But the Mirage expands like
a pillow when you breathe and does not give me the feeling of being
smothered which I sometimes feel when I use a mask with the pillows....

WOULD YOU RECOMMEND DMEs RECOMMEND THIS MASK TO OTHERS: I would not
recommend this mask to anyone who did not have the heater on their CPAP
machine.... especially if they breath through their mouth.... My throat
was very dry, to the point where I woke up and could not swallow. But,
if you have the heater, this is a good mask if you can adjust to the
nose pillows and the person sleeps mostly on their back.

OTHER COMMENTS: I am still waking up in the night around 2AM no matter
which of the masks I use....  sometimes I can go back to sleep ... Other
times I rip the mask off...  I am on the list to use the test sleep
APNEA machine and I want to use this mask again to see how well it does
when I am sleeping.
-----------------------
FIRST IMPRESSIONS: The first time I tried the Liberty, I immediately
noted that the nosepieces were incredibly comfortable; they did not
irritate my nostrils and they remained in place. I also noticed that the
mouthpiece sat comfortably, but I had to tighten the straps a lot to
stop side leaking, which seemed to always be on my left side (perhaps
due to a slight asymmetrical difference in anatomy) I also noticed that
the mask made music! I could even play a tune by tapping on each side.
It was sort of funny..... at first.

IMPRESSIONS OVER TIME:  The Liberty is extremely easy to put on. It is a
real pleasure in this regard. The headpiece is very light and the side
straps sort of stand out from my face and are non -irritating and
comfortable, another feat of good engineering.

The nosepieces remained amazing technology in my opinion, soft and
non-invasive though seated comfortably. They sealed well. However, I was
awakened several times by noise that was produced when one side slipped
out and was hissing away. I tightened the headpiece to smooch the
nosepieces more tightly in place and this seemed to help.

Annoyances arose with the mouthpiece in that it complained mightily, no
longer music to my ears and this required tightening the straps even
more. However this degree of tightening produced creases in the cushion
and this produced air leaks onto my chin. An accommodation of sorts was
reached, but I wish you had used Activa technology on this part of the
mask. The Activa is a hellofa &quot;sealer.&quot;

I am a back sleeper and a side sleeper and tummy sleeper and if there
are any other positions, I'm sure that you would find me in them. The
mask remains with me! It does not go askew.

Despite all the &quot;tightening&quot; the only mark on my face in the morning is
a small, non-irritating horizontal dent above my top lip.

I am a mouth leaker, big time. It is a pleasure to have this mouthpiece
because my mouth remains sort of shut in it. By this I mean that it is
not blown open and kept open as it was in the UMFF &amp; Quattro. That
situation left me waking up with a totally dried out tongue and mouth -
a very painful situation that is not the case with the Liberty.

I wash the mask every morning with cake Ivory. I do not take it apart. I
am sort of afraid to, fearing that I might never get it back together
correctly. I am also afraid that the plastic might break. I am
especially concerned about the top strap connecters, they seem so
fragile.

I ESPECIALLY LIKED:  I love the design, it is pure genius! I have
disliked the Full Face masks, the bridge of nose dents, the sores and
dents on my cheeks, and the strange suffocating air. I have found that
the use of a chinstrap is not particularly useful as it is my tongue
that allows the air puffs, not an open mouth. I have used them with a
nasal mask/prongs and have still not gotten good results. HOWEVER I feel
that I HAVE experienced &quot;good sleep&quot; with the Liberty!!! It is light;
the pillows are great; it is minimalistic. No more nose bridge problems,
no more check squash, no more headaches from masks that cross over my
forehead sinuses. The straps that float over your checks work well and
keep the mask in place.

I DID NOT LIKE: I am frustrated by having to continue to fiddle with the
fit of the mouthpiece each night, by its moans and groans and leaks.

COMPARISON TO SIMILAR PRODUCTS:  Re: Full Face Masks..... I have used a
UMFF. I have described my impressions above.... I have used a Quattro.
It was awful!!! It is not an improvement on the UMFF, it was awful, and
it was unwearable!

FINAL COMMENTS ON NOISE, LEAKS, FIT, COMFORT: The Liberty makes noise,
the mouthpiece leaks, the nose pieces seal well, a nose piece
occasionally will pop out it if the mouthpiece is not placed high above
chin or if head straps are not tightened to a great degree, it fits
comfortably.

WOULD YOU RECOMMEND DMEs RECOMMEND THIS MASK TO OTHERS:  I would totally
recommend this mask despite the above valid observations. It is light,
comfortable and &quot;best of breed.&quot; It totally replaces

Thanks for those additional suggestions.  I've read about the Activa on the
company's website, and it's an interesting concept.  Some of the positive
comments I've read on that mask have to do with the way it moves so as to
alleviate any feeling of suffocation.  I haven't experienced that feeling of
suffocation to any real extent (yet, anyway), but I'll keep the Activa on
the back burner and will consider it further if the Liberty isn't all that I
hope for.  I haven't read anything yet about the Headrest, but I'll check it
out.

That makes sense.  I really would love to be able to reduce my pressure
setting, though, especially if I'm &quot;stuck&quot; with my current machine for the
long haul.  When I'm falling asleep and the machine is in ramp mode, I don't
even notice the pressure until it gets up to about 10, at which point it
becomes more difficult to exhale.  I hit the ramp button again to be sure
I'm asleep long before it hits 12.

Becoming a side-sleeper will be a good thing, apnea or no apnea, so I'll try
the tennis ball and hope for good results.

Microsoft re: my Outlook Express settings.  For some reason, even after I

Just wanted to thank you both for responding.  :-)

I'm a side sleeper with a full face mask. The following things have helped
'me'
achieve less leaks during the night.

Just before going to bed, I take a wash rag, dampen it with rubbing alcohol
and wipe my face area where the mask rests. Then I take the rag (alcohol
evaporating)
and gently/lightly wipe the silicon seal of my mask.

(disclaimer: not sure if rubbing alcohol deteriorates silicon, but it works,
giving me a
solid, sticking seal)

Also, I pulled out my very old &quot;Sobakawa&quot; buck wheat hull filled pillow
and placed it on top of a very flat/low ordinary pillow. When I lie down, I
punch the
lower corner of the Sabakawa so that every thing is under my ear and NOTHING
is
touching my face or mask. Believe it not, I often find myself waking up in
the same
position I fell asleep in and my machine says my leaks have vastly improved.
Again,
I attribute to sleeping soundly and deep, achieving REM, which I never did
in my study.

I still am not able to remember dreaming during the night, but I couldn't
care less
about any dreams during my night. I drive a truck during the day. Falling
asleep
behind the wheel IS my only concern!

Good luck to you and hang in there. A time comes when you do NOT mind CPAP
one iota! Just consider sleeping with CPAP the same as having a wallet in
your hip
pocket / purse-handbag on your shoulder, wearing a wrist watch, wearing a
wedding
ring, wearing glasses, etc.
After a while ... when you realize you do not have it on, you freak out and
ask yourself
&quot;where the h*ll is my _____?&quot; After a while, subconsciously you realize,
putting
this God forsaken thing on my face gives me what my body needs and desires,
and it becomes a routine ... like the other things you do, EVERY NIGHT,
before
you go to bed.

If *I* can do it ... you can too!

Sincerely, Gary (been lurking for a long time since requiring CPAP)

Exactly.    The point in the sleep study was that 9cm was enough as
long as she doesn't sleep on her back, 12 otherwise.

An auto type machine would be one way to address this for most people
with OSA as long as they don't have certain other SDBs

I think that that is a good idea, and certainly making notes for later

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Well.... generally the pressure to resolve OSA events is higher when you
&gt;&gt; are sleeping on your back.   Jim will probably argue that the setting is
&gt;&gt; high enough to address that and it may well be true.   OTOH, higher
&gt;&gt; pressures may result in reduced comfort.

&gt; The pertinent part of my sleep study says:  &quot;By the end of the study, a CPAP
&gt; pressure of 12 cm H2O appeared effective at eliminating the majority of
&gt; obstructive respiratory events and maintaining good oxygen saturation (mean
&gt; saturation at this pressure was 95.8% with a low of 88%).  Although the RDI
&gt; at 12 cm H2O was still 19.8, the majority of the residual events were
&gt; sleep-onset cental/Cheyne-Stokes in origin and occurred during a brief
&gt; period while the patient was trying to return to sleep after an arousal.
&gt; There were, however, still several scattered hypopneas seen during
&gt; supine-REM sleep at the end of the study on 12 cm H2O.  Note that a pressure
&gt; of 9 cm H2O appeared adequate in the _non-supine_ position (including brief
&gt; REM sleep).&quot;

&gt; My impression is that I'm much better off not sleeping on my back.  Maybe my
&gt; pressure could eventually be reduced if I can retrain myself to sleep on my
&gt; side all the time.  I would have a difficult time adjusting to a higher
&gt; pressure than I have now, unless I had some kind of assistance on exhale.
">

Several things here.

The 12cm pressure has been arrived at as being adequate to deal with
the majority of events in the worst case (supine) sleeping position.
RDI is a measurement of events per hour and can be looked at on an
hour by hour basis or grouped over a whole period of sleep.     The
report suggests the 19.8 figure only happened during one particular
hour and is explained.    It would be useful to know what it was for
the other hours.

With respect to pressure, it is possible that you are finding 12cm a
little uncomfortable, but that can be the effect of the muscles getting
used to working a little harder.   It won't do any harm as such.
Generally this initial effect lasts for a few days in new patients.

If after that there is still a discomfort problem, then there are other
options:

- CPAP machine with CFLEX.    This is one that backs off its pressure a
bit during exhale but doesn't do that in a precision way.

- Bilevel machine. BiPAP    These have two pressure settings and move
almost instantly between them between inhale and exhale.   They are
used when patients have additional breathing disorders than OSA or when
pressure setting is high and it's difficult for the patient.   These
are an expensive machine because the mechanics and the electronics to
operate it have to be more complex to do the fast switching between
pressures.

- Autotitrating machine. aPAP.      These measure the pressure and flow
and detect when obstructive events are about to begin.    They increase
the pressure steadily to resolve it and then gradually back it off
afterwards.  The purpose is to increase patient comfort and compliance
by not needing a high pressure the whole time.   They also deal with
variations due to sleeping position, daily variation and longer term
variation.   So in your case, might periodically go from a baseline
pressure of 4-6 cm when nothing is going on to 9cm when you are on your
side to 12cm on your back.     These cost more than a CPAP machine but
not as much as BiPAP.    Studies have shown them to be suitable for 80%
plus of patients with uncomplicated OSA and that there does seem to be
increased compliance - more mask on time - for the majority.

There are also autotitrating machines with CFLEX and recently on the
market, automatic BiPAP machines.

I wouldn't necessarily worry about looking at forcing yourself to sleep
on your side or of pressure at this stage.

For some things yes, others no.

However, I wouldn't start on anything much until the sleep debt issue
is resolved, or a couple more weeks.   At that point you will either be
at a stage where you are able to spot the more subtle things - e.g.
mask adjustments and try those or you will still have sleep patterns
all over the place and daytime sleepiness.   If that's turns out to be
the case, then check the sleep hygiene things to do (actually you could
start that any time) and then review.   If there are still issues 2-3
weeks from now with those, it's worth talking to the sleep clinic
again.   However, they could well say to try another 2-3 weeks and to
report back.

&gt; That makes sense.  I really would love to be able to reduce my pressure

Keep in mind that as you get used to using the machine, you may well
notice less effect from this.

It will do eventually.     Wipes with isopropyl alcohol are somewhat
less agressive.

A better way for the mask would be to wipe around it gently with a tiny

All I have is the four pages that the lab sent to my PCP, consisting of the

&gt; With respect to pressure, it is possible that you are finding 12cm a
&gt; little uncomfortable, but that can be the effect of the muscles getting
&gt; used to working a little harder.   It won't do any harm as such.
&gt; Generally this initial effect lasts for a few days in new patients.

Yes, I'm sure my body is just getting used to the effort needed to exhale.
I'll deal with it, but a lower pressure is something to hope for.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If after that there is still a discomfort problem, then there are other
&gt; options:

&gt; - CPAP machine with CFLEX.    This is one that backs off its pressure a
&gt; bit during exhale but doesn't do that in a precision way.

&gt; - Bilevel machine. BiPAP    These have two pressure settings and move
&gt; almost instantly between them between inhale and exhale.   They are used
&gt; when patients have additional breathing disorders than OSA or when
&gt; pressure setting is high and it's difficult for the patient.   These are
&gt; an expensive machine because the mechanics and the electronics to operate
&gt; it have to be more complex to do the fast switching between pressures.

&gt; - Autotitrating machine. aPAP.      These measure the pressure and flow
&gt; and detect when obstructive events are about to begin.    They increase
&gt; the pressure steadily to resolve it and then gradually back it off
&gt; afterwards.  The purpose is to increase patient comfort and compliance by
&gt; not needing a high pressure the whole time.   They also deal with
&gt; variations due to sleeping position, daily variation and longer term
&gt; variation.   So in your case, might periodically go from a baseline
&gt; pressure of 4-6 cm when nothing is going on to 9cm when you are on your
&gt; side to 12cm on your back.     These cost more than a CPAP machine but not
&gt; as much as BiPAP.    Studies have shown them to be suitable for 80% plus
&gt; of patients with uncomplicated OSA and that there does seem to be
&gt; increased compliance - more mask on time - for the majority.

&gt; There are also autotitrating machines with CFLEX and recently on the
&gt; market, automatic BiPAP machines.

Thanks for that easy explanation of other options, Andy.  I'm going to flag
your post for future reference.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I wouldn't necessarily worry about looking at forcing yourself to sleep on
&gt; your side or of pressure at this stage.

Well, you and Harlan are certainly more well-versed on these things, so I'll
take your advice and not worry sleeping on my back - for awhile, anyway.
(I'd still like to become a side-sleeper at some point.)  For now, I'll
focus on just getting a good night's sleep, no matter what position I'm in.
There'll be plenty of time for me to torture myself with the damned tennis

Cool.  I didn't know how long it might take to make up the sleep deficit,
but if I can reasonably hope for the process taking just a few weeks, that's
good news.

I've seen the term &quot;sleep hygiene&quot; mentioned a couple of times here in other
posts, but I didn't know what it meant.  I just searched the NG for it and
came up with a post from 2004 with a link to some good info on the subject

if anyone else can benefit from it).

As long as you have a Jim, you will always be looking for the Holy Grail.

Allow me to explain.

*I* do not have a Jim ... I'm my own DME. My insurance has a $2000
deductible,
and then it is a 80/20 contribution. So what's the use when something is low
cost?
We're not talking surgery here.

After being diagnosed with sleep apnea and having MANY hypo-apneas, I tried
the insurance road only to find road BLOCKS! So using basic math, I
determined
that purchasing the needed equipment myself was better, cheaper, and faster,
and
allowed me to obtained what *I* wanted and needed, not what I was only
allowed.

I researched everything I possibly could research and determined a full face
mask
was my only option, being a mouth breather. I found sizing charts and had my
non
qualified, untrained DME wife measure me for proper fit. Then I researched
machines
and determined which features I would need/want/use. (read: bells and
whistles)
Quite simple actually, never needing a trained individual prospering from
our high
insurance premiums.

So after purchasing everything myself, (Quite cheap also. There are ways and
means,
because there are MANY back door DME employees selling products) I was
determined to make my choices work for me, come hell or high water. I
&quot;owned&quot;
them, They were &quot;my&quot; products that I chose for myself.

My alternative is to purchase something else. Yours is to b*tch for
something else ..
and for FREE! I'm sorry if I sound surly, but that's just the way I see the
world.
No offense meant.

In other words --- give what you have time / make what you have work! It
will
if you give it a chance. No different than a new pair of shoes. Time heals
all that ails you.

Sincerely, Gary

I'd be interested to hear others' opinions on this.  I was told to just wipe

let it air-dry.  Alcohol is pretty harsh stuff, so I'd be reluctant to use
it, although the benefits you're realizing from it are appealing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jim will probably argue that the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; higher pressures may result in reduced comfort.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Andy, if I have been following BB's posts correctly, she has a basic M
&gt;&gt;&gt; Series machine. This is a fixed pressure machine so it was likely set
&gt;&gt;&gt; for the pressure she was sleeping on her back (as was mine). IOW, at
&gt;&gt;&gt; this point, if she moves to side sleeping, it won't change her pressure
&gt;&gt;&gt; (which is fixed) unless she convinces them to upgrade to the auto M
&gt;&gt;&gt; series (IMHO, a reason for such machines and why I am trying to get one).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Harlan

&gt;&gt; Exactly.    The point in the sleep study was that 9cm was enough as
&gt;&gt; long as she doesn't sleep on her back, 12 otherwise.

&gt;&gt; An auto type machine would be one way to address this for most people
&gt;&gt; with OSA as long as they don't have certain other SDBs

&gt; IIRC, she has been diagnosed with Cheyne-Stokes and central apnea?
">

That's why I made the point.

However, the  words from the report talk about that happening when just
going to sleep so it may or may not be significant.

Pretty much everybody has a few central events (OSA or not).....

&gt;&gt; The report suggests the 19.8 figure only happened during one particular
&gt;&gt; hour and is explained.    It would be useful to know what it was for the
&gt;&gt; other hours.

&gt; All I have is the four pages that the lab sent to my PCP, consisting of
&gt; the doctor's two-page written summary report and a two-page CPAP Summary
&gt; Report with graphs and charts.  Should there be a whole lot more
&gt; information included with my results?  I don't want to look like an idiot
&gt; when I go see the sleep doctor with a four-page report in my hand, if
&gt; there's supposed to be a lot more to it.

&gt;&gt; With respect to pressure, it is possible that you are finding 12cm a
&gt;&gt; little uncomfortable, but that can be the effect of the muscles getting
&gt;&gt; used to working a little harder.   It won't do any harm as such.
&gt;&gt; Generally this initial effect lasts for a few days in new patients.

&gt; Yes, I'm sure my body is just getting used to the effort needed to exhale.
&gt; I'll deal with it, but a lower pressure is something to hope for.

&gt;&gt; If after that there is still a discomfort problem, then there are other
&gt;&gt; options:

&gt;&gt; - CPAP machine with CFLEX.    This is one that backs off its pressure a
&gt;&gt; bit during exhale but doesn't do that in a precision way.

&gt;&gt; - Bilevel machine. BiPAP    These have two pressure settings and move
&gt;&gt; almost instantly between them between inhale and exhale.   They are used
&gt;&gt; when patients have additional breathing disorders than OSA or when
&gt;&gt; pressure setting is high and it's difficult for the patient.   These are
&gt;&gt; an expensive machine because the mechanics and the electronics to operate
&gt;&gt; it have to be more complex to do the fast switching between pressures.

&gt;&gt; - Autotitrating machine. aPAP.      These measure the pressure and flow
&gt;&gt; and detect when obstructive events are about to begin.    They increase
&gt;&gt; the pressure steadily to resolve it and then gradually back it off
&gt;&gt; afterwards.  The purpose is to increase patient comfort and compliance by
&gt;&gt; not needing a high pressure the whole time.   They also deal with
&gt;&gt; variations due to sleeping position, daily variation and longer term
&gt;&gt; variation.   So in your case, might periodically go from a baseline
&gt;&gt; pressure of 4-6 cm when nothing is going on to 9cm when you are on your
&gt;&gt; side to 12cm on your back.     These cost more than a CPAP machine but
&gt;&gt; not as much as BiPAP.    Studies have shown them to be suitable for 80%
&gt;&gt; plus of patients with uncomplicated OSA and that there does seem to be
&gt;&gt; increased compliance - more mask on time - for the majority.

&gt;&gt; There are also autotitrating machines with CFLEX and recently on the
&gt;&gt; market, automatic BiPAP machines.

&gt; Thanks for that easy explanation of other options, Andy.  I'm going to
&gt; flag your post for future reference.

&gt;&gt; I wouldn't necessarily worry about looking at forcing yourself to sleep
&gt;&gt; on your side or of pressure at this stage.

&gt; Well, you and Harlan are certainly more well-versed on these things, so
&gt; I'll take your advice and not worry sleeping on my back - for awhile,
&gt; anyway. (I'd still like to become a side-sleeper at some point.)  For now,
&gt; I'll focus on just getting a good night's sleep, no matter what position
&gt; I'm in. There'll be plenty of time for me to torture myself with the
&gt; damned tennis ball.  ;-)

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; However, I wouldn't start on anything much until the sleep debt issue is
&gt;&gt; resolved, or a couple more weeks.   At that point you will either be at a
&gt;&gt; stage where you are able to spot the more subtle things - e.g. mask
&gt;&gt; adjustments and try those or you will still have sleep patterns all over
&gt;&gt; the place and daytime sleepiness.   If that's turns out to be the case,
&gt;&gt; then check the sleep hygiene things to do (actually you could start that
&gt;&gt; any time) and then review.   If there are still issues 2-3 weeks from now
&gt;&gt; with those, it's worth talking to the sleep clinic again.   However, they
&gt;&gt; could well say to try another 2-3 weeks and to report back.

&gt; Cool.  I didn't know how long it might take to make up the sleep deficit,
&gt; but if I can reasonably hope for the process taking just a few weeks,
&gt; that's good news.

&gt; I've seen the term &quot;sleep hygiene&quot; mentioned a couple of times here in
&gt; other posts, but I didn't know what it meant.  I just searched the NG for
&gt; it and came up with a post from 2004 with a link to some good info on the
&gt; subject
&gt; ( http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/medicaldepartments/psychiatry/slee... ,
&gt; if anyone else can benefit from it).

&gt; Thanks, Andy. --------------------------------------------

You said earlier that you were diagnosed with Cheyne-Stokes. I'd suggest you
google CS and read up on it.  As I said earlier, a BiPaP or some other VPaP
is the usual treatment for the condition.

Your enthusiasm is great, but I really think you need to slow down a bit.
It has taken a while for your disorder to develop and you're not going to
cure it or get proper therapy for it in one fell swoop.  In my opinion,
you're trying to do too much at once. I'm afraid you'll only end up
disappointed. Have your appt with a certified sleep doc and work from there.
This is really not the time for a lot of hit and miss experimentation. You
need to realize that views here on different treatments vary and are
propelled by biases toward treatments that have worked for specific
individuals.  It's time to wait for your doctor to do his thing.

Best wishes,

Certainly.    All of these things are data points.    Those from
individuals may be based on what has worked for them.  Those from
doctors what they have found to work across a large set of patients.

Faced with all of this, I tend to score what the doctor is saying as
fairly high but not to the exclusion of the other information.   I give
some score to the experiences of others because it is practical and to
studies of new things as long as they can be substantiated.   For
example the recent Mayo stuff on Complex SA has a lot of value.   Has
it permeated to the average sleep doctor?  Not really.  Will it
eventually?  Certainly.

Given BB's current situation, yes I agree with you, one thing at a time
and give a high score to what the doctor suggests.  Do that to the
exclusion of all else? No.  and I know you're not suggesting that.

To me the mark of a good doctor is one who is confident in what he
proposes and advocates that patients research for themselves so that
they ar better informed.  This is good because it removes fear and
reinforces sound science.

If a doctor says or implies that he is the fount of all knowledge and
to ignore all else then it should ring alarm bells.  Fortunately, most
are sufficiently confident of their expertise that they can guide the
patient sensibly to what works well and be able to justify it.

I appreciate the advice, Hal, and I'm probably not making the best
impression in this NG.  An answer to one question I pose prompts another
question, and then another.  I'm getting an education, which I think is
important, but I'll try to mellow out about it.

In truth, I haven't changed anything yet.  I'm using my machine every night,
adjusting my mask as needed, and getting some sleep.  I'm grateful for that.

I know I've been asking a lot of questions, but that's because I feel like
I'm on my own re: my treatment at the moment.  This NG and other websites
are my sources for info.  I've been trying to learn as much as I can so I
can better attend to my problem until I can see the sleep doctor and get his
advice.

And on that note...  I was away in Phoenix all day today, and I came home to
a voicemail from Jim (the RT at Preferred), who said that the sleep doc's
office wants me to have a machine with a smart card in it by the end of this
month.  So I'll be using one of those machines for a couple of weeks before
I see the doc, and he'll be able to see what's going on with me in detail.
I can't tell you how much better that made me feel - like this doctor is on
the ball and is taking care of me *before* I even see him.  I'm immensely
relieved by that.  (I thought I was going to see him with just my sleep
reports in hand, wondering how he'd know what was actually happening while
I'm sleeping at home every night with my basic machine.)

I should sleep pretty well tonight, knowing I'm in such good hands now (with
both Jim and the sleep doc).  :-)
