Saw a Bald Eagle today. It was soaring at about 500 feet or so above the highway
near Zuni, Virginia (between Norfolk and Petersburg, nearer to Petersburg).
While this was not an unusual sighting, as there are more and more of them
around that general area, still it was the second eagle I've seen since I left
Kodiak Alaska back in '74. I was delighted. The beautiful clear blue sky and
fine weather helped a lot too.
Best regards
John

I still remember seeing a Bald Eagle in 1979 and thinking that it was
once in a lifetime opportunity.  Recently, I started a new job at the
City of Saginaw MI Drinking Water Treatment Plant which is located near
downtown Saginaw.  Close to the plant is a water holding pond (Lake
Linton) and about once a month an Eagle will perch in a tree above it.
I've been told it also spends time in trees by the Saginaw Children's
Zoo and  Hoyt Park which are across (east) of Washington Avenue. I
don't know where it nests Shiawassee  Game Refuge, Green Point, Nature
Center, and Crow Island State Game Area are close by.

I just got back from a week in Apopka Florida (near Orlando).  I saw
Bald Eagles every day, both adults and immatures.

They would perch in a pine tree two doors down from my sister's house.
They also fished ponds in back and in front of the house. From time to
time they'd take fish they'd caught onto the tees at the adjacent golf
course to eviscerate them.  That made for some startled golfers.

I also visited Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and Canaveral
National Seashore.  Lots of waterfowl, herons, egrets, ibises, roseate
spoonbills, gulls, terns, etc.

Here in the Hill Country of Texas, there is a huge nest estimated to
weigh 500 pounds, is visited every year by Bald Eagles.  The nesting
site is off the road by about 300 feet where people line the roads
with scopes and binoculars.

The year before last there was something very unusual, according to
the local avian experts and that was having a female and two other
Eagles caring for the eglets, feeding them, etc.  They think it was a
female and two males.  It was fun to watch.

When the two eglets fledged it was like we all gasped with happiness.
All of these birds decided to fly about at the same time and I saw a
smaller bird on the tail of one of the adult Eagle and I thought it
was a Mockingbird because that's what Mockingbirds do to the local
hawks.  Well, I guess I never fully realized how huge Eagles are, it
turns out the bird on the tail was a Red Tailed Hawk!  The whole
experience was great.

The Llano (pronounced LAN-o locally not the y sound one would expect) Eagle
Nest has been around a few years now and has always had 3 adult eagles.
Seeing them is indeed a treat.
(If you have a gps, the coordinates are N30 46.326 W98 33.055).
Several folks with really nice spotting scopes have been there when we
stopped and are happy to share the view with visitors.  Thru one I could
even see the wind ruffling the smaller feathers of the adult eagle's body.
Seeing one of the adults come in for a landing is totally awesome.
The location on TX Hwy 29 is 7 miles west of the intersection with FM1431.
The State has put up some warning signs for pedestrians and created a bit of
parking area there. (no port-a-potty though).
no commercial interest in following...just happy experiences.
Several good eating places around, (Tamale King for one) as well as a boat
tour up the nearby Colorado River north of Lake Buchanan where you can see
other eagle nests.
more info at:
http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/outdoors/01/5l...
some of the other sources erroneously reported they have always had two
eaglets, I know last year only had one.
some of the best pictures are at:

Yes, that's what I said.  "The year before last..." indicates a few
years, maybe several years.  Do you know if anyone has figured out why
three adults always return to that nest?  That is very unusual.

Yep, and swallow-tailed kites, red-shouldered hawks and hooded
mergansers, anhingas, double-crested coromorants, and lots of little
shorebirds I couldn't ID.

My mother lives right on an estuary on Long Island, NY.  She has sea
turtles laying eggs in her undeveloped back yard.  There are decks
which go around the whole house so nobody will disturb the integrity
of the area where these animals reproduce.

Also, on the estuary (Behind Smith's Point Park) are nesting boxes for
Osprey.  Another Osprey breeding ground is on the other shore beyond
the north fork on Long Island at Orient Point Beach Park.

Anyone visiting Long Island really should definitely check out the
amazing birding.
