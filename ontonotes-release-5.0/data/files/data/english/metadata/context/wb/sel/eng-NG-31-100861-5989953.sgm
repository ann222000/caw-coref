This is disgusting!  I wrote a few days ago to defend some of the HSUS
practices, but this is absolutely revolting.  Read what the Houston Humane
Society (note: Houston, not the national HSUS) is advertising as a
"Valentine's Day special" for cats (free neutering accompanied by a *reduced
rate for front paw declawing*):

"We will be neutering 300 male cats only (NO FEMALES) that day.  There will
be no general public surgery-other than the male cats.  We will be declawing
only a small amount of male cats for the normal price of $60 (front paws
only)."

The flyer also says, "Show your cat you love him on Valentine's Day by
helping him live a longer, healthier life."
In other words, they are really saying: show your cat you love him by
mutilating his front feet.

I am going to contact them and let them know exactly what I think.  You can
see the flyer advertising this "special"
here: http://www.houstonhumane.org/spay.aspx
Here is the number they listed to schedule appointment and receive
pre-operative instructions: 713-433-6421
And here is the email address they listed for support and donations:
a ... @houstonhumane.org

I don't normally cross-post, but I am including several cats' newsgroups
with this message because I think it is such an abomination for a "humane
society" to perform declawing, and I hope some of you will write or call.

disgusting that they are promoting declawing.

Once again, I let my fingers move faster than my brain.  The Houston Humane
Society is not advertising  a "special rate" on declawing.  The special is
for free neutering, but declawing can also be done at the "regular rate" of
$60.00.  If anything, though, that makes it *even worse* to think that the
Humane Society would think of declawing as a "normal" thing to do and would
even sponsor it.  I think I am going to be sick!!

Please note that the link I posted is to the Houston Humane Society.  As was
discussed in this NG earlier, local groups usually are not part of the HSUS
itself.  I went to the HSUS page and could not find anything similar.  In
fact, there are a number of links there in opposition to declawing:

Yes, it was noted that their is a free neuter day but to bunch that in with
declawing a cat as a way to promote their health is pretty disgusting. The
Arizona Humane Society from what I've recalled has commented that they don't
promote nor support declawing. Usually they try to educate people on what is
involved with declawing.

Yesterday, I was at one of the Petsmarts and a guy came in and asked Paw
Placement about adopting a cat. When the question came up on how the guy
feels about declawing, the guy said he supports it and that when adopting he
will declaw the cat in order to protect is $15,000 couch. Anyone more
worried about their couch or other object than the safety and well being of
the animal shouldn't be allowed to adopt a cat. He walked away and most
likely is going to try and find a group that will allow him mutilate the
cat. Paw Placement has an anti-declaw policy in the adoption contract and if
someone declaws a cat from their organization, they have the right to seize
the cat.

Yes, but I walked into the same trap as we discussed on this newsgroup
several days ago.  That is, I failed to differentiate between HSUS and local
Humane Societies.  In this case, the flyer comes specifically from the
Houston Humane Society.  The HSUS site discusses "Spay Day" in February, but
nothing about declawing.

Probably because he'd still behave like an un-neutered male - mating (even
thought he would be shooting blanks) and fighting. He'd have the opportunity
because an un-neutered male would be much more difficult to keep in or
around ones home as he'd be quite inclined to wander off looking for some
'action'. This would also put him at risk of meeting up with what my vet
told me is 25% of the stray population that is testing positive for feline
AIDS and/or Leukemia. From the point of actually living with him the stench
from the box would be a real joy and he'd be a bit of a lousy neighbor
because of his inclination to 'mark' the neighbors house, porch and/or
bushes while marking his territory. If his mommy and daddy displease him or
try bringing in another cat he's likely to mark every doorway in the house
while marking that territory too.

A un-spayed female wouldn't be any more of a picnic to live with. Although
she probably wouldn't do much marking the howling and yowling while rubbing
up against anything that doesn't move away fast enough could be a bit of a
distraction. Getting out of the house without little Fluffy following to see
if she could 'score' could be challenging. Her chances of developing breast
cancer is increased as are the possibility of hefty vet bills when she runs
into 'female' troubles.

Both would have shorter lives because I don't think sweet Mother Nature had
a 15 - 20 year life span in mind.

Who is this ass? Any thinking person would have figured out that I said
spaying/neutering is ok but not declawing by claiming it too is good for a
cat's health.

That's correct.  I posted a follow-up just a few minutes after the first

declawing.  The special is for free neutering, but declawing can also be
done at the "regular rate" of $60.00.  If anything, though, that makes it
*even worse* to think that the Humane Society would think of declawing as a
"normal" thing to do and would even sponsor it.  I think I am going to be

I also posted a message to make it clear that this was the Houston Humane

It doesn't? You mean you didn't see they have a $60 declaw special as a part
of this package? Obviously, you didn't read the page at all.

Well, the page says the following

"We will be neutering 300 male cats only (NO FEMALES) that day.  There will
be no general public surgery-other than the male cats.  We will be declawing
only a small amount of male cats for the normal price of $60 (front paws
only).  Each client will be allowed to bring a maximum of 5 male cats."

This shows without a shadow of a doubt they are pro-declaw and by stating
the above they are indeed advertising that they do perform declaws. Any
listing on a web site for service is an advertisement.

Of course, it's pro-declaw.  Even worse, they are *sponsoring* it --
absolutely disgusting, as I said earlier.  However, the price of $60.00 is
not a special.  It's their normal price (which makes it even worse because

&gt;&gt; So why not give the cat a vasectomy and thereby preserve the horomonal
&gt;&gt; conditions bestowed by sweet Mother Nature?

&gt;&gt; Charlie

&gt; Probably because he'd still behave like an un-neutered male - mating
&gt; (even thought he would be shooting blanks) and fighting. He'd have the
&gt; opportunity because an un-neutered male would be much more difficult to
&gt; keep in or around ones home as he'd be quite inclined to wander off
&gt; looking for some 'action'.
">

This is my point -- the neutering is done for the convenience of the
owner, as much as for any other reason.  Certainly it alters the nature of
the cat at the most basic level, substantially changing its behavior and
its temperament.

I will grant that de-sexing reduces the tendency of cats to engage in
high-risk behavior, and so it extends their lives.  But what is more
important -- quantity or quality of life?  I have followed the declawing
debate in this group a number of times.  One of the arguments
against declawing is that it deprives a cat of something fundamental to
its nature, and therefore diminishes its quality of life.  But the people
with declawed cats deny that this is the case.  They say their pets seem
happy and contented, to which the anti-declawers respond by saying it's an
illusion; cats are good at masking their suffering.  If that is true, then
how can the anti-declawers assure themselves that neutering doesn't have a
similar effect?

Which is why I posted what I did. The reason I called it a special is
because they seemingly packaged it together with the free neuter surgery.

You can do that....For over $1000 per cat. But even for that, it won't help
the cats tendency to wander a long way from home, and annoy the trailer park
neighbors down the hill, who will shoot it with their 22 rifles and BB guns,
so your $1000 investment will just end up killing the cat anyway....The
average male feral cat only lives about 5 years.......

Your argument is only valid if you are talking about spay/neuter of
stray/feral cats. It is NOT the strays who are being mutilated, but
rather the house cats.

Tania, our 7 year old female is not spay, and she has never produced
any offspring. If by some accident on OUR PART, she were to have
kittens, we would take responsibility for them; either by finding
proper homes or by making them part of the family.

Tania, our 7 year old female is not spay, and she has never produced
any offspring. If by some accident on OUR PART, she were to have
kittens, we would take responsibility for them; either by finding
proper homes or by making them part of the family.

Bob

To keep a non-neutered animal away from sexual activity when they are "in
season" is cruel and unnecessary....Why not have your female spayed?

My two females are spayed, and my male is neutered, and they are perfectly
happy, and stay close to the house, since there is no reason for them to
wander. This greatly decreases the probability that they will get run down
by a car or killed by some gun-toting teenager....We do feed a male feral
cat who isn't neutered, but he belongs to himself, and not to us. If I ever
feel that he is "mine", then I will trap him and have him neutered.

Bob, get that cat spayed. All it takes is her getting out and one encounter
to have a litter of kittens. By not having a cat spayed or neutered you will
only be adding to the overpopulation problem. Feral cats should also be
spayed and neutered as soon as possible. Last year was a record breaking cat
and kitten season with many unwanted litters being born. Many rescue groups
were overwhelmed by felines were filled to capacity. BTW, since you are
feeding the feral cat you have a responsibility to have him neutered unless
you want him spraying all over the place.

This is easy to say, but hard to do. If I were to catch Smokey and throw him
in a cat carrier, and take him to the Vet to get neutered, he might never
come to our house again. I would be happy to pay somebody else to do it for
me, so Smokey wouldn't associate his bad experience with me or my wife, but
the various "Feral cat coalitions" and other such organizations won't do
that....They just repeat things like you said above, which I know to be

Are you saying that is hard to get a trap, put food in it and then have the
cat enter it in order to get the cat? Don't you have a group in your area
that handles the trap, neuter and return option for feral cats? As for bad
experiences, I have not seen or heard of one feral cat that has had a
tramatic experience from being trapped, spayed or neutered and then
re-released back in the area they were found.

If a feral cat group says they won't come out and trap it may be because
they are overwhelmed and are hoping that the caretaker will be kind enough
to do it for them. Here in Phoenix groups like AzCATs volunteers are often
in short supply so whoever the caretaker is, they are often asked to help.

If you truly care about this cat as much as you say you do, then I'd advise
you do the humane trapping yourself and get the cat to the clinic to have
the neuter surgery done. The problem is not going to be solved by trying to
take the lazy way out and making excuses. Perhaps you should contact
Alleycat Allies for instructions on trapping. Their web addy is
www.alleycat.org .

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, it was noted that their is a free neuter day but
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to bunch that in with declawing a cat as a way to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; promote their health is pretty disgusting.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmmm.  It seems to me that cutting off a cat's nuts is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty substantial form of mutilation.  It's done to make
&gt;&gt;&gt; the animal into a more satisfactory domestic pet, right?

&gt;&gt; It's done to help reduce the sheer number of cats in the world. You do
&gt;&gt; realise that one tom can be responsible for over 20,000 descendants in a
&gt;&gt; single year, right..?

&gt;&gt; Ivor

&gt; So why not give the cat a vasectomy and thereby preserve the horomonal
&gt; conditions bestowed by sweet Mother Nature?

&gt; Charlie
">

Since you seem to be looking for reasons why neutering a pet is good for its
health, let me tell you that a vasectomy doesn't cut it (no pun intended -
but it is a good one) as it might rejoin.. also you will still need to worry
about testicular cancer... no testicles, no cancer.

And yes, neutering does make a pet more satisfactory pet.. and frankly it
seems to make the pet happier, as it no longer has to spend the rest of it's
life fighting for territory and mating rights, no longer has to spend its
days spraying and marking territory.  Doesn't need to wander around to make
sure no one else is edging in on said territory..

You want a cat that doesn't look 'mutilated' get neuticles.  That way if
your pet ever gets lost and ends up in a shelter, it will have to go through
surgery again when the shelter doesn't realize the pet is altered..

Declawing - that is a whole different kettle of fish.  There weren't any
studies for years about the negative effects of declawing a cat.  Now there
are, and they are showing it causes all kinds of health and behavioral
issues, including arthritis.    It always amazed me that declawing a cat was
perfectly acceptable, but declawing a dog was heresy.  Every time I bring it
up, people defend dogs, and say they don't do damage with their claws, but I
have seen a wide variety of damage done by dog claws on floors, on doors,
etc.

well then, that is six other kittens that won't find those homes who will be

That isn't the problem.....I have three other cats, so a trap wouldn't work.
But I don't need a trap. My wife and I can brush and touch Smokey anytime
he's here in the house, so putting him in a cat carrier and taking him to
the Vet would be no problem. The question is,would he trust us to touch him
in the future should we do that? Bear in mind that it took us about 5 years

at all......It's too bad that there isn't some chemical that one can put in

I guess it's pointless to talk to you about this one. It seems like all you
want to do is make excuses instead of doing what's needed to take care of
the issue. There is nothing worse than making recommendations and giving
instructions to someone who claims to want help but instead wants everything
done for them.

It seems every time something has been suggested you've come up with an
excuse like the cat will be traumatized by being trapped and neutered, you
have 3 other cats (what does have that to do with trapping an outdoor feral
cat?), or now wanting to put a chemical in their food to steralize them
which is not only laughable but also dangerous since a drug not prescribed
by a licensed and qualified vet could kill the animal.

Get this cat neutered. Stop making excuses and wasting the time of people
who are trying to help you.

Is there a chapter of Alley Cat Allies near you.  If you are serious about
permitting someone else to take Smokey to the vet, that would be a good
organization to contact.  They are often overwhelmed financially, but they
would probably be eager to help if you are willing to pay the vet's bill.
Another option would be for you to place Smokey in a carrier but make
arrangements for a friend to transport him to the vet.  You would need to
keep Smokey indoors (even a garage or barn) for awhile after the surgery.

&gt;&gt; subjecting them to the trauma of taking them to a vet's office. This is a
&gt;&gt; cat that will only allow two people on this entire earth to get within 20
&gt;&gt; feet of him.....Sorry..........
&gt;&gt;    If you have nothing better to do, and are really concerned about the
&gt;&gt; feral cat problem, then you might consider one of my other suggestions,
&gt;&gt; such as the sterilizing pill, or a third party trapping organization. If
&gt;&gt; not, then I suggest that you just leave it alone. We all know what,
&gt;&gt; &quot;should&quot; be done, but we are not willing to do it.

&gt; Is there a chapter of Alley Cat Allies near you.  If you are serious about
&gt; permitting someone else to take Smokey to the vet, that would be a good
&gt; organization to contact.  They are often overwhelmed financially, but they
&gt; would probably be eager to help if you are willing to pay the vet's bill.
&gt; Another option would be for you to place Smokey in a carrier but make
&gt; arrangements for a friend to transport him to the vet.  You would need to
&gt; keep Smokey indoors (even a garage or barn) for awhile after the surgery.

Now, there's an outstanding idea....After an hour or so in a carrier, he
would forget that I put him there, and when my buddy came in and got him and
took him to the vet, he probably wouldn't associate the bad experience with
either me or my wife.... I will think about that, and perhaps arrange it
with my friend from across town........

Let me see, you come here posting for help, I offered several ideas
including contacting groups like Alley Cat Allies for help and perhaps
trapping the cat and getting him to the clinic to be neutered, and you say I
didn't help? I guess I'm done on this one. It seems pretty obvious you want
everything done for you instead of following instructions. Not doing the
trapping simply because you don't want the cat to hate you or it'd be truly
a tramatic experience is not only laughable but rediculous. No feral cat
rescue will say "sorry we can't trap and have the spaying or neutering done
because the cat will hate us." They get out there, do the trapping, get the
cat to the vet, have the sugery done, and then the next day the cat is
released back to their environment. And yes, many caretakers of the cats
have helped in this procedure and the cats still came back to them for food
and water.

&gt; You have not been able to help me....I have had this problem for a long
&gt; time now, and you haven't told me anything that I did not already know.
&gt; The bottom line is that I don't want to throw Smokey in a cat carrier and
&gt; bring him to the vet, because I am afraid that I will lose him if I do
&gt; that. Even if I would do it, my wife would not let me do it. So, the
&gt; problem persists, and you can't help by telling me to do it anyway. I know
&gt; what, &quot;should&quot; be done. We just don't want to do it. And we are not
&gt; alone....There are millions of feral cats in this country, and our problem
&gt; with Smokey is repeated all across this country with millions of other
&gt; folks just like us that are afraid of alienating their cats by subjecting
&gt; them to the trauma of taking them to a vet's office. This is a cat that
&gt; will only allow two people on this entire earth to get within 20 feet of
