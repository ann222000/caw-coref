"/> Exactly, Gerald!

A few months ago, I took a very interesting metal table
with inset 12&quot; Anasazi-style clay tiles (vintage about
1950.)
One woman drove me nuts for four hours, asking me to
come down from $300 -- I had told her $225 and no lower.
She kept coming back, offering me $175.

Then finally, she said &quot;I'll be back tomorrow.&quot;

Five minutes later, it was admired by another woman,
she offered me $200 and I &quot;settled&quot; for $225 (I WANTED
to sell it quickly to prove a point to Woman #1.)

Woman #1 did come back the next day -- and almost
cried when I reported that it had sold. Then, she angrily
said &quot;I told you I was going to buy it.&quot; I said &quot;No, you
told me you'd pay $175 and that you'd be back today.&quot;

I'd have sold it to Woman #2 for $150, just to make
sure that it wasn't there when Woman #1 returned.

Overheard: dealer to customer,&quot; isn't that a 'sweet' piece,anybody else
would be asking twice as much..
This wasn't at a show but rather a mother with an 8yr. old child in
my shop last weekend.
Oohh, isn't that mahogany glass topped table lovely. How much is it? Oh,
here's a sticker on the side. I'm sorry,I knocked the sticker off. Is
that 99 or 66 ? THAT'S 66 DOLLARS. Oh,that's all? Taking her child by
the hand and saying,&quot;come on honey,let's go see if we can find one we
like better.......
Me to the wife: AAaaaaaggggghhhhhh !!!!!
Pull down the door and lock up we're going HOME.

one of my favorites was actually a response to a hackneyed cliche I used on
a shop owner in Tel Aviv. I asked, looking at an antique piece of jewelry,
&quot;Can you do any better?&quot; to which he responded, &quot;sure, I can charge you
more -- better for me!&quot;

"/> A variation is &quot;Can you do better than 10 percent? I'm a dealer.&quot; Reply: &quot;Yes,
I can mark it up 20 percent and then give you a 20 percent discount.&quot;

When people tell me they had one just like it and threw it away, I tell them
how happy I am that they did that. If we all kept everything, then none if it
would be worth anything now!

A fellow dealer told me of this exchange she had with a customer:
Customer - &quot;Oh, but it has this bit of damage....would you take less?&quot;
Dealer - &quot;Thank you for pointing that out to me, that's an excellent
sign of age, I think I'll raise the price ! &quot; ..... Personally, I think
my dealer-friend should be awarded a medal for the absolute best
comeback line ever utttered at an antique show.
Don't get me wrong. neither my friend nor I have a problem with
customers making offers. It's when they run it down first in order to
get a better price, this is what makes most dealers seethe.

Really it is that old, you won't find one in that condition, they only made a
few. It is hardly been used. I wouldn't touch that if I were you. From :
