A powerful cyclone smashed into southern Bangladesh killing at least
41 people as it uprooted trees, destroyed homes and forced thousands
to take refuge in shelters, officials said Friday.
Hurricane Sidr hit the coastal districts, particularly Khulna and
Barisal, as it started crossing the country from northern Bay of
Bengal last evening with high tidal surge and strong winds of over
200km per hour.

Exact figure of losses of lives and properties could not be known
immediately. But it was reported that one body was recovered after a
boat with 15 passengers capsized in Kholapatua river near Noabeki ghat
in Shyamnagar upazila of Satkhira. Three passengers were still missing
as of 9:30pm yesterday.

Hundreds of thousands of people, especially those living in coastal
zone, were evacuated in the last two days.

The Met office asked the Mongla Port to continue showing great danger
signal-10, under which also came adjoining 11 districts. Chittagong
and Cox's Bazar maritime ports and adjoining six districts were under
great danger signal-9.

Seven ships of Bangladesh Navy, including three frigates, were brought
to the Mongla naval base from Chittagong yesterday morning. Bangladesh
Army opened a control room for rescue operations.

Zia International Airport authorities were asked to operate flights
with caution.

Operations at Chittagong Port and Shah Amanat International Airport
were also kept suspended.

All districts and upazila administration, law enforcement agencies and
the joint forces, and offices of disaster management, relief and
rehabilitation and Red Crescent monitored the cyclone situation round
the clock.

The speed of the storm with 74km of radius was in a range between
220km and 240km. Strong winds had started lashing on the coastal zones
since yesterday afternoon, uprooting trees and ripping off roofs of
houses, our correspondents reported.

Met officials said the category-5 hurricane (on a scale of 5) made
landfall, crossing Khulna and Barisal coasts near the Baleswar river
around 7:30pm with winds of over 210km an hour. The cyclone was still
crossing land at 10:00pm and would take another few hours to
completely cross the country, according to the Met office.

Before the hurricane hit ashore, black clouds had covered the sky and
gusty wind and rain had increased in the coastal region. Overall
weather condition deteriorated while power supply and
telecommunications were disrupted in many areas, our correspondents
report.

&quot;The hurricane is strong like those in 1970 and 1991, but this time we
got a lot of time for preparations. So, we think there will not be
many casualties although minimising losses of properties will not be
possible,&quot; Met office Director Samarendra Karmakar told journalists.

The government has announced red alert in the coastal zone and taken
necessary preparations to face the disaster. Maritime ports of Mongla
and coastal districts Bhola, Barisal, Patuakhali, Barguna, Pirojpur,
Jhalakathi, Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira and Jessore and their offshore
islands and chars will remain under great danger signal-10.

Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Noakhali, Feni, Laxmipur, Chandpur and their
offshore islands were asked to hoist great danger signal-9.

Steps were taken to evacuate people from the danger zones to safer
places like cyclone shelters, high-rise buildings, public and private
houses. Food and water were supplied for them.

Chittagong office reported that the authorities evacuated around two
lakh people to 368 cyclone shelters.

Relief and rescue operation items, food, medicine, cooking and
lighting materials were also collected for emergency. Educational
institutions in these districts were closed while people's movement
was discouraged.

Tidal surges 15-20 feet above normal tide inundated the low-lying
areas, including Dublar Char, Nijhum Dwip, St Martin's Island, Shah
Pori Char, Kochikhali and Kotka, in these coastal districts. However,
all inhabitants could not be evacuated from these places.

Sources in Khulna zone police and forest department said at least
1,000 fishermen in Dublarchar did not agree to evacuate leaving their
valuables.

According to reports from Cox's Bazar, around 300 fishing trawlers
with around 1,000 fishermen remained missing as of last night. Over
100 tourists, including a foreigner, were stranded on the St Martin's
Island. Naval communications with Teknaf to St Martin's remained
snapped for the last two days.

Our correspondents from coastal districts said several hundred
thousand people were shifted to cyclone shelter centres. Nearly 10
million people live in the coastal zone which usually face cyclone
every year.

Major rivers in the region meanwhile started swelling again as water
level increased by 50cm on an average nearing the danger level.

Port authorities stopped plying of all types of vessels including
launch and ferry on 28 inner routes of Barisal, 21 routes of
Patuakhali, 13 routes of Barguna, 14 routes of Bhola and coastal
services on five Barisal-Bhola-Laxmipur-Chittagong routes.

The internal river port authorities hoisted great danger signal-4 for
the river ports. They said the triple-deck vessels that had left
Barisal port on Wednesday night were called back midway.

Operations at the river ports will not be possible to resume until the
cyclone crosses the area and weather condition improves, port
authority sources said.

Tourists left Kuakata beach as local authorities and Red Crescent
volunteers evacuated people from the coast to highland and high-rise
buildings.

Many chars and islands already went under three-four feet of water and
many people looking for shelters became panicked as they became
isolated from main land, they added.

Sources at Kuakata said tidal wave eight-10 feet higher than normal
tide hit the shore. Fishermen were asked to take safe shelter or stay
anchored.

Our Patuakhali correspondent reports: Thousands of acres of Aman paddy
fields in seven upazilas were damaged as tidal surge inundated the
fields. Lowlands in Kalapara, Galachipa, Dashmina, Baufal, Mirzaganj
were flooded with around three feet of tidal waters.

The district administration opened 210 shelters while the relief
ministry allocated 1,000 pieces of blankets, 450 tents and Tk 50,000
for Patuakhali, district relief and rehabilitation office sources
said.

Our Satkhira correspondent reports: More than 50,000 people from the
coastal zone took shelter as gusty wind with torrential rainfall
continued in the district.

A total of 116 medical teams and hundreds of Red Crescent volunteers
were working to combat the situation.

The Mongla port authorities opened three control rooms to monitor the
situation, reports our Khulna correspondent.

Reports from Bhola said inhabitants of 14 chars were evacuated as
water level in the Meghna increased by at least five feet, making the
town protection embankment vulnerable.

Several hundreds of tin-shed and thatched houses in Charfashion
upazila in Bhola were destroyed and a huge number of trees were
uprooted as the hurricane swept across the district. Tidal waves from
the Meghna entered Charmadraj breaking the protection embankment.

In a press release, World Food Programme (WFP) said they made
extensive preparations, deploying response teams in Southwest
Bangladesh to strengthen its local management. With the support of
DFID, the WFP has created an operational alliance with 38 NGOs,
including other UN agencies.

The Daily Star
Most of the casualties died when trees fell on flimsy bamboo and tin-
built homes, police in southern districts told foreign media. They
warned that the toll was expected to rise.
