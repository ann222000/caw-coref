Just how much longer is Helen Clark going to put up with political bully
Trevor Mallard for.  Not forgetting that she's already threatened to use a
police taser on him earlier in the year.

Surely Mallard should be charged by police for assault?

Anyone remember when someone attacking a well known politician who was in
court over over multi child molesting charges?

The person that assaulted that ex politician was charged with assault like
anyone else brawling would be.

Will Helen Clark be able to protect Mallard from being charged with assault?

If she does step in will it mean one law for Labour MPs and and one law for
everyone else in the country?

Whatever happen to the old saying: &quot;Do the crime do the time&quot;?

&quot;The incident occurred about 5pm while the House was debating the
Suppression of Terrorism Amendment Bill.&quot;

How suitable is that?
LOL
Politicians one minute debating a Terrorism Bill, then the next minute end
up in a fight with Trevor Mallard doing some real down to Earth Maori
bashing.
For once Willie Jackson can actually call it for what it was, nothing more
than a Maori bashing.  And Pita Shaples can now claim that relations with
Maori have now been pushed back another 100 years making it 200 years in
total with his previous claim included.

Not forgetting that meanwhile Tame Iti who has never hit a NZ poltician
remains locked up.  Does Helen Clark really believe that Trevor Mallard is a
much better person than Tame Iti is?

He's male and in her eyes that is an unpardonable crime.
I understand that Mallards marriage has fallen over and he who bought
up Brashes marriage failure suddenly had some-one pointing the fact

That's exactly what the police did after someone thumped a child molester
who happens to be an ex poliltician and that was rith outside a court.  Fair
and balanced Justice is required by all - simple as well.
The bully Mallard was seen fighting yet again and should be charged for it.

Politicians should know a damn sight better else they shouldn't be
politicians anymore.  Will Helen Clark keep protecting Mallard because he's
a Labour MP instead of being an MP of another party that knows better?

Why, because he's male, or Maori, or both ??  I sense a bit of a
double standard here. Bloody great hoo-haa over some percentage of
women being &quot;abused&quot;  while you wish to do the same to Henare. WTF?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Now, there I'd agree, he is the nasty ugly pro bully-bovver-boy after
all, and Helen Clark threatened him with restraining violence just
recently, namely, a good Tasering.  Furthermore, he would want to be
jolly careful where he wields a hammer, as he could easily get himself
shot with that sort of reputation.

Why not have a place in the Beehive where MPs can go and settle their
differences, with seconds and a proper referee to run the show?

Lady MPs or older folks who can't fight for themselves could appoint a
Champion to fight on their behalf.

At least they didn't brawl right there in Parliament like the Koreans do.

The Police do not have direct jurisdiction in the House, although the
Speaker can presumably seek Police assistance in the performance of
her duties.  The final decision would rest with the Privileges
Committee who can sanction MP's and others, and this includes
imprisonment (although this may recently have been done away with).
Presumably Parliament (via the Privileges Committee) can waive
privilege or do something similar to allow the police and Courts to
deal with the matter.

As you can see, my undrstanding of this is rusty, the outgoing Clerk
of the House wold have a far better grasp of such issues.

It is interesting to note that in 1840, the Sheriff of Middlesex was
imprisoned at Newgate Prison by the Speaker for contempt of the UK
Parliament while carrying out his lawful duties as a court officer.

There was also a NZ case in the early 1900's where Parliamentary staff
prepared a coal cellar in Parliament as a cell in case the Privileges
Committee ordered the defendant in a case they were hearing to be
imprisoned.

I never would and never will.

The very fact of its existence in law shows conclusively that the
lunatics are in charge of the asylum, where moral degeneracy and the
difference between what  is intuitively right and wrong, just or
excessive, caring or abusing, are now to be determined and prescribed
by repellent control-freaks of the fishwife sorority that comprise the
societally regressive Sue Bradford claque.

Societally, New Zealand is like a clapped out jalopy with only one
functioning gear-shift:

&gt;&gt;&gt;Geeze I've wanted to smack Tau Henare in the mouth for years

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's amazing to me Mallard  was able to restrain himself so long

&gt;&gt; Which only goes to prove how one sided the survey about abused women
&gt;&gt; really is.
&gt;&gt; You've just claimed that you would like to have done some Maori bashing
&gt;&gt; yourself.
&gt;&gt; LOL
&gt;&gt; Whatever did poor Tau Henare ever do to you to deserve that claim?

&gt;&gt; E. Scrooge
&gt; Nothing wrong with bashing that arszehole!

Bashing him would hardly prove anything except that Mallard is nothing but
an arrogant thug.
And Helen Clark is treating Mallard like a little kid by making Mallard do a
time out.

Crap edited to get your point across better.

Clark has given small minded Mallard a time out, like any 5 year old would
get.

Get a life Scrooge, for pity sake. Mallard and Henare and 2 of a kind.
Henare goaded Mallard, Mallard gave him a bit of a push or a slap or the
like. The 2 were out of order, they had a small set to, Mallard apologised,
both party leaders told them to grow up, really end of story.

Maybe if Mallard had given one of the National party gentleman a roughing up

yes, he was stupid in what he did. I can't see anyone arguing that Sue.
Mallard has admitted that himself. He may have some more apologising to do,
that could well be in order. Henare didn't wrap himself in glory either. For
the National party to try and make political capital out of it will show
just how desperate they are however. I doubt they will, I credit Key with

Mallard had a hand in the fracas. As I said, that should be the end of it.

Sue, I don't really care. I couldn't really give a tinkers. If the media or
parliament has nowt better to do than run this story for days then it is a
sorry statement on our society. Mallard &amp; Henare are as bad as each other.
They were both dumb, they should both be ashamed. If you &amp; your mob want to
try and milk this then there mustn't be much else going on for the National
party eh. I trust the Nats have more important things to get on with as does

LOL. Typical Labour shill response.

Mallard punched Henare 3 times, they then wrestled to the floor.

Mallard dished it out to Brash, Henare dishes it out to Mallard.
But Mallard, the fucking nasty shitbag commie that he is used
physical violence to get his revenge.

What a sad fucking excuse for a human being, let alone a Minister
of the Crown, who is meant to lead by example.

Dishes the shit out but can't take it back.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Just how much longer is Helen Clark going to put up with
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; political
&gt;&gt; bully
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Trevor Mallard for.  Not forgetting that she's already
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; threatened to
&gt;&gt; use a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; police taser on him earlier in the year.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Surely Mallard should be charged by police for assault?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Get a life Scrooge, for pity sake. Mallard and Henare and 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;of a kind.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Henare goaded Mallard, Mallard gave him a bit of a push or a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;slap or the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;like.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Mallard punched Henare.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The 2 were out of order, they had a small set to, Mallard
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; apologised,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;both party leaders told them to grow up, really end of story.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Maybe if Mallard had given one of the National party
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;gentleman a roughing
&gt;&gt; up
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;then it would be serious stuff. Henare gives as good as he
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;gets. Mallard
&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;stupid, Henare was stupid. Neither of them are choirboys,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;don't bother us
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;with sanctimonious bullshit &amp; we can all get on with more
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;important
&gt;&gt; things.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Only Mallard is in charge of a ministry which is running a
&gt;&gt;&gt; multimillion-dollar ad campaign with the message that violence
&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; *never* OK.

&gt;&gt; yes, he was stupid in what he did. I can't see anyone arguing
&gt;&gt; that Sue.
&gt;&gt; Mallard has admitted that himself. He may have some more
&gt;&gt; apologising to do,
&gt;&gt; that could well be in order. Henare didn't wrap himself in
&gt;&gt; glory either. For
&gt;&gt; the National party to try and make political capital out of it
&gt;&gt; will show
&gt;&gt; just how desperate they are however.

&gt;You're a fucking hyprovite. Labour made full political capital
&gt;out of lies they invented about Brash and National.

&gt;THIS is REAL!!!
">

John B this is a n incident between Heare and Mallard - what has Brash
got to do with it. I am not aware of Brash ever getting involved in
hittinh anyone - you are just trying to slur his name by association
with such an incident. And what lies anyway?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I doubt they will, I credit Key with
&gt;&gt; more common sense than that, especially given one of the Nats
&gt;&gt; equivalents of
&gt;&gt; Mallard had a hand in the fracas. As I said, that should be the
&gt;&gt; end of it.

&gt;Hope it's the end of you, condoning such violent behaviour of a
&gt;Labour Minister while trying to make Henare just as much to
&gt;blame.

&gt;You're as corrupt as they come.
">

I haven't seen anyone condone the action, and I certainly don't, but
it appears to have been settled between the two MPs, although the
stupidity of the affray will be remembered with respect to both MPs,
but particularly Mallard. I don't see any corruption here - what are
you talking about?

No you're not, but we have a very politically correct media and
opposition.  I think it was a bit of poetic justice and also evidence
of some strong emotions, but also gives to me at least the image of
two small boys in a primary school playground. I bet it really brought
a smile at least to a lot of people's faces.

Not really.

Little wonder this country has so much growing up to do.

The immature, adolescent behaviour of Mallard and Henare rightly
disgusts any civilised observer.  Since both of them are patently
intellectually impoverished, physical violence is their only recourse.
From their institutional origins both are brutish by nature.  They
know no better.

Yet that isn't the real issue, but this one is:

What kind of gullible, blinkered fools - and in their thousands - does
it take to have voted these two uncivilised clod-brained juveniles
into Parliament in the first place?  One can anly assume they must be
the kind of constituents who comfortably identify with the bonehead,
brutish likes of Mallard and Henare.

*That's* where the problem lies, and for as long as the Mallards and
the Henares continue to be voted into power as representatives of the
people, you may confidently expect New Zealand's social and cultural
development to remain hogtied.

But Henare gladly accepted Mallard's invitation to &quot;step outside&quot;.  He
was up for it, and is therefore no better and no less culpable than
Mallard.
