Milk: A Cruel and Unhealthy Product

http://www.peta.org.uk/factsheet/files/FactsheetDisplay.asp?ID=120
Cows who are allowed to roam free in pastures and care for their young
form lifelong friendships with one another. They also play games, have
a wide range of emotions and demonstrate characteristics, such as
vanity, and actions, such as holding grudges, that are generally
associated with humans.(1) But most cows raised for the milk industry
are intensively confined and are not allowed to nurse their calves –
even for one day. They are treated as little more than milk-producing
machines and are genetically manipulated and pumped full of
antibiotics that force them to produce more milk. Humans continue to
consume dairy products, despite overwhelming scientific evidence
indicating that cow’s milk is linked to heart disease, cancer,
diabetes and many other ailments.

Cows Suffer on Dairy Farms
Cows produce milk for the same reason humans do – to nourish their
young. In nature, some calves suckle from their mothers for nearly a
year.(2) One veterinary study explained that ‘during natural weaning,
there is never complete and abrupt abandonment of the calf by the cow.
In fact, the … cow and calf will maintain a lifelong relationship of
social contact and companionship …’.(3) Another study found that a
‘strong maternal bond’ develops between a cow and her calf in as
little as five minutes.(4) But calves born on dairy farms are taken
from their mothers when they are just 1 day old and fed milk replacers
(including cattle blood) so that humans can have the milk
instead.(5,6) This forced separation causes cows and calves great
stress, and cows have been known to escape enclosures and travel for
miles in an attempt to reunite with their young.(7)

Female cows are artificially inseminated shortly after their first
birthdays.(8) After giving birth, they lactate for 10 months, then
they are re-inseminated, and the cycle starts again. Some spend their
entire lives standing on concrete floors; others are crammed into
massive mud lots. Cows have a lifespan of about 25 years and can
produce milk for eight or nine years, but the stress caused by
factory-farm conditions leads to disease, lameness and reproductive
problems that render cows worthless to the dairy industry by the time
they are 4 or 5 years old, at which time they are sent to the
slaughterhouse.(9,10)

On any given day, there are more than 2 million cows living on UK
dairy farms – about 2 million fewer than there were in the 1960s.(11)
Yet milk production has continued to increase, from 12 million metric
tons per year in 1961 to more than 15 million metric tons in 2003.(12)
Although these animals would naturally make only enough milk to meet
the needs of their calves (around 7 kilograms a day), genetic
manipulation and antibiotics are used to force each cow to produce
more than 6,000 litres of milk a year (an average of 16 litres a
day).(13,14) Cows are also fed unnatural, high-protein diets, which
include dead chickens, pigs and other animals, because their natural
diet of grass would not provide the nutrients necessary for them to
produce the massive amounts of milk required by the industry.(15)

Mastitis
Painful inflammation of the mammary glands, or mastitis, is common
among cows raised for their milk and is one of the reasons most
frequently cited by dairy farmers for sending cows to slaughter. There
are about 150 bacteria that can cause the disease, one of which is E.
coli.(16) Symptoms are not always visible, so the somatic cell count
(SCC) of milk is checked to determine the presence of infection.
Somatic cells are a combination of white blood cells and skin cells
that are normally shed from the lining of the udder. Just as in
humans, white blood cells, sometimes referred to as ‘pus’, are
produced to combat infection. The SCC of healthy milk is below 100,000
cells per millilitre, but milk from British cows averages more than
170,000 cells per millilitre.(17,18)

Studies have shown that providing cows with cleaner housing, more
space and better diets, bedding and care lowers the SCC of their milk
and their incidence of mastitis.(19) A Danish study of cows subjected
to automated milking systems found ‘acutely elevated cell counts
during the first year compared with the previous year with
conventional milking. The increase came suddenly and was synchronised
with the onset of automatic milking.’(20) Yet instead of improving
conditions on factory farms or easing cows’ production burden, the
dairy industry is exploring the use of cloned cattle who have been
genetically manipulated to be resistant to mastitis.(21)

The Veal Connection
While female calves are slaughtered or added to the dairy herd, male
calves are taken from their mothers when they are as young as 1 day
old and, where export regulations allow, are sent to Europe and
chained in tiny stalls for three to 18 weeks to be raised for
veal.(22,23) They are fed a milk substitute that is designed to make
them gain nearly a kilogram per day, and their diet is purposely low
in iron so that their flesh stays pale as a result of anemia.(24) An
enzyme from their stomachs is used to produce rennet, an ingredient
used in many cheeses.(25) Calves raised for veal commonly suffer from
diarrhoea, pneumonia and lameness.

Human Bodies Fight Cow’s Milk
Besides humans (and domesticated animals who are fed by humans), no
other species drinks milk beyond infancy or drinks the milk of another
species. Cow’s milk is suited to the nutritional needs of calves, who
– unlike human infants – have four stomachs and gain 20 stone or more
in a matter of months, sometimes weighing more than 71 stone before
their second birthdays.(26) Cow’s milk also contains about three times
as much protein as human milk.(27,28)

Cow’s milk is one of the most common causes of food allergies among
children.(29) Most people begin to produce less lactase, the enzyme
that helps with the digestion of milk, when they are as young as 2
years old. This reduction can lead to lactose intolerance.(30)
Millions of Europeans are lactose intolerant, and the British
Nutrition Foundation estimates that up to 70 per cent of the world’s
population may suffer, to some degree, from this condition, which can
cause bloating, gas, cramps, vomiting, headaches, rashes and
asthma.(31) Studies have also found that autism and schizophrenia in
children may be linked to the body’s inability to digest the milk
protein casein; symptoms of these diseases diminished or disappeared
in 80 per cent of the children who were switched to milk-free
diets.(32)

A UK study showed that people who were suffering from irregular
heartbeats, asthma, headaches, fatigue and digestive problems ‘showed
marked and often complete improvements in their health after cutting
milk from their diets’.(33)

Calcium and Protein Myths
Although American women consume tremendous amounts of calcium, their
rates of osteoporosis are among the highest in the world. Conversely,
Chinese women consume half the calcium (all of it from plant sources)
and have scant incidence of the bone disease.(34) Medical studies
indicate that rather than preventing the disease, milk may actually
increase women’s risk of osteoporosis. A Harvard Nurses’ Study of more
than 77,000 women aged 34 to 59 found that those who consumed two or
more glasses of milk per day had a higher risk of broken hips and arms
than those who drank one glass or less per day.(35) T. Colin Campbell,
professor of nutritional biochemistry at Cornell University, said,
‘The association between the intake of animal protein and fracture
rates appears to be as strong as that between cigarette smoking and
lung cancer’.(36)
Consumption of excessive protein from dairy products, eggs and meat
has been linked to the formation of kidney stones and has been
associated with cancer of the colon and liver.(37, 38) It is also
suspected of putting a strain on the kidneys, which take calcium from
the bones to compensate.(39) Humans can get all the protein that they
need from a vegetarian diet – legumes, nuts, seeds, yeast, tofu and
beans are all excellent sources of protein.

What You Can Do
The best way to save cows from the misery of factory farming is to
stop buying milk and other dairy products. Discover the joy of soya!
Fortified soya and rice milks provide calcium, vitamins, iron, zinc
and protein but contain no cholesterol. Soya and rice milks are
perfect for cereal, coffee and soups and also work well in baked goods
and other recipes. Many delicious dairy alternatives – such as almond,
rice, oat or soy milk and Swedish Glace and Tofutti brand ‘ice cream’
– are available in health and grocery stores.
