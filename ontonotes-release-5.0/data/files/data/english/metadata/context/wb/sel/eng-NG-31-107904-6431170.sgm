Excerpts from http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/opinion/29shoup.html

Several studies have found that cruising for curb parking generates
about 30% of the traffic in central business districts.

In Los Angeles, we found the average cruising time was 3.3 minutes,
and the average cruising distance half a mile (about 2.5 times around
the block). This may not sound like much, but with 470 parking meters
in the district, and a turnover rate for curb parking of 17 cars per
space per day, 8,000 cars park at the curb each weekday. Even a small
amount of cruising time for each car adds up to a lot of traffic.

Over the course of a year, the search for curb parking in this
15-block district created about 950,000 excess vehicle miles of
travel. Cruising those 950,000 miles wastes 47,000 gallons of gas and
produces 730 tons of carbon dioxide.

What causes this astonishing waste? As is often the case, the prices
are wrong. A national study of downtown parking found that the average
price of curb parking is only 20% that of parking in a garage, giving
drivers a strong incentive to cruise.

Drivers often compare parking at the curb to parking in a garage and
decide that the price of garage parking is too high. But the truth is
that the price of curb parking is too low. Underpriced curb spaces are
like rent-controlled apartments - hard to find and, once you do, crazy
to give up. This increases the time costs (and therefore the
congestion and pollution costs) of cruising. And, like rent-controlled
apartments, underpriced curb spaces go to the lucky more often than
they do to the deserving.

The solution is to set the right price for curb parking.

To prevent shortages, some cities have begun to adjust their meter
rates to produce about an 85% occupancy rate for curb parking. The
prices vary by location and the time of day. Drivers can usually find
a vacant curb space near their destination, and the search time is
zero. Cities can adjust the price of curb parking in response to
demand to keep roughly one out of every eight spaces vacant throughout
the day. Right-priced curb parking can eliminate cruising.
The balance between the varying demand for parking and the fixed
supply of curb spaces is the Goldilocks Principle of parking prices -
the price is too high if too many spaces are vacant, and too low if no
spaces are vacant. But when only a few spaces are vacant, the price is
just right, and everyone will see that curb parking is both well used
and readily available.

Beyond the transportation and environmental benefits,
performance-based prices for curb parking can yield ample revenue. If
the city uses a share of this money for added public services on the
metered streets, residents and local merchants will be more willing to
support charging the right price for curb parking. These funds can be
used to clean and maintain sidewalks, plant trees, improve lighting,
remove graffiti, bury utility wires and provide other public
improvements. Returning the meter revenue generated by a district to
the district can persuade residents, merchants and property owners to
support right-priced curb parking.

If cities want to reduce congestion, clean the air, save energy,
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve neighborhoods, they should
charge the right price for curb parking, and spend the resulting
revenue to improve local public services.

Curb parking costs a hell of a lot less per space than garage parking. It
is also more risky to park on the street. (provided the garage is self
park and you keep the keys, if the garage is valet, then well I consider
it to be the bigger risk) Not to mention that garage parking usually has
a minimum that one pays for. Can't just pay for an hour or two.

what this kooky scheme will do is chase customers away to places that
are more car friendly, the end result will be the same, less cars
cruising for parking spaces, but there will be vacant storefronts
instead of vibrant businesses.

Doubtful. People aren't going to walk even a couple of extra blocks

Why? The price changed should reflect the perceived value to the

towards useful city services.

It's not congestion pricing and cost is relevant since garage owners have

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;No, unless trapped in an urban area, they'll just drive to a mall
instead. Why do you think many cities took out meters in the first place a
few decades back?

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Profits are secondary- prime purpose of parking meters is to
encourage turnover of the spaces. Hence all the laws about 3-hour max, and
special distant lots for day-shift downtown workers, and the old honored
custom of chalking tires. (now replaced by barcodes somehow, I presume.)

You're right, I was out of line, and I apologize. On a quick read, I just
assumed you were one of the folks who previously have made snobbish comments
on here, about how great bikes are, in the past. You know, the 'all
IC-powered vehicles are evil' crowd. Most bikers I know make jokes about how
riding in the city is a death-defying experience.

No, I don't feel threatened- I do try to be kind to bikers in traffic, even.
But on my usual route to work, they painted bike lanes that cause traffic
congestion by eliminating a traffic lane, which I could live with if the
bike lanes were actually used, which they do not seem to be. And since the
bike lanes on the dangerous and busy street aren't used, that gives the city
an excuse to NOT put them on other streets (like the little-used parallel
street a block over) where they might actually do some good.

Apology accepted. Riding in the city is easy. The smaller space keeps
most drivers at 30mph and under making it such that I am almost always
keeping pace with motor vehicle traffic. It's suburban riding that is
much worse. With drivers who are too lazy to even move over let alone
change lanes or put down their cellphone or slurpy. Had one this past
weekend... old lady sipping her slurpy did a near mirror scraping pass of
me on a 4 lane road where there was a clear left lane.

I am against bicycle lanes. I see them as a bicycle ghetto in all the
implementations I've seen. The only place they were even useful was on
major highways (as in the legal definition) on Maui and then only in
high-speed sections where there were no cross streets. I find bicycle
lanes to have many problems and have watched roads made more dangerous
and more difficult to ride once they were painted. The road was better
before painting a stripe on it without much thought.

I have found most roads people think are 'fast and dangerous' aren't bad to
ride in many cases. People just aren't road riders so they don't know. I
actually prefer roads with properly posted 85th percentile speed limits
as it encourages a keep-right-except-to-pass environment. What makes an
arterial bad to ride for me is often faster drivers needing to pass
someone poking along in the left lane. This puts the passing driver in
the right lane, where I am. When the speed limit is correct I am then
dealing with the driver who is poking along and not one who is frustrated
and blocked in. The slow driver will usually change lanes, pass and
return. It's much more orderly.

Of course the best solution is the wide curb lane. The right lane being
about a third to half again as wide as it would be normally for cars alone.
This makes it easy for drivers to pass while retaining all the
flexibility and safety of being in the travel lane for the bicyclist.
And unlike a bicycle lane, it doesn't gather debris as when there is no
bicycle traffic, motor vehicles sweep the debris into the gutter.

if the lane were narrower, then I could.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Curb parking costs a hell of a lot less per space than garage parking.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This isn't about cost. It's a form of congestion pricing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's not congestion pricing

&gt;&gt; Of course it is. They want to set the price high enough so that there
&gt;&gt; will always be empty spaces. They don't need the extra money; it is a
&gt;&gt; tool for congestion management.

&gt;That's why parking meters have time limits. If you're going to go

Exactly. Even in this jerk-water town I live in, downtown closes up
tight (save for a few restaurants) around 5pm or so. By 7pm it will be
deserted, save for the customers of the restaurants - almost all of
which opened in the last 5 to 10 years; before that, downtown was a
ghosttown after about 5:30pm. Now, the area around the mall is a
bustling traffic nightmare almost 24/7.....

Chicago ones were the cop hat band or a ticketbook. Then again if someone

Which is much easier (just look for the red flag on the meter - no

It would be trivial to make a newfangled meter that would be able to
detect if the space was ever empty in the last X hours too, since we are
going through the expense of high tech gaget. Actually, I think meters
that reset when the car pulls away already exist.

Aw, hell, just have the meter talk to the computer in the car, and/or the
EZpass dongle in the windshield, and/or the OnStar system, and automatically
charge the car owner for the meter time, and e-mail him the ticket
automatically when the meter expires. No need to have those expensive
unreliable humans involved at all. For scofflaws, send an override command
to the car to lock out the fuel pump, so they can't drive it away. I think

Because I believed they already existed in some form or another, as I stated
above. My memory is pretty good... but since you'll want a cite next...

A simple google search turns it up immediately:
http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB112008647932273412-wcgfanaRACA...

"In Pacific Grove, Calif., parking meters know when a car pulls out of
the spot and quickly reset to zero -- eliminating drivers' little joy of
parking for free on someone else's quarters."

"In Montreal, when cars stay past their time limit, meters send real-time
alerts to an enforcement officer's hand-held device, reducing the number
of people needed to monitor parking spaces"

So, I was not coming up with new ideas, merely stating ones I had already
heard about.

I have found bike lanes to do well in San Francisco and Philadelphia.

One bike lane that I see being heavily used is the one on Walnut St. in
Philadelphia.

I think Philly would have even more cyclists if only:

1) They get all of them to ride with traffic.  Some Phildelphians even
ride against traffic in bike lanes that have arrows.

2) Drivers would use turn signals at all, use turn signals before turning
rather than when they start turning, use turn signals before rather than
after moving onto a bike lane to make a right turn, use turn signals for
lane changes, and use turn signals before enering/exiting the parking
lane.

3) They enforce laws against double parking - which Philadelphia and a
small number of adjacent suburbs have done poorly mainly in the past 7
years or so.  And I am not talking about bothering delivery trucks with
nowhere to stop but in a traffic lane and that have a job to do.

3a) They enforce such laws heavily against lazy clods who double park
within half of a block of a parking space.

3b) They enforce sadistically such laws laws against sub-toads who double
park against an available parking space.

3c) They enforce severely and painfully laws against inconsiderate slobs
who park half in a parking space, half over a bike lane.

3d) Enforce painfully laws against blocking a traffic lane in order to sit
in front of the relevant door waiting for a passenger when the lazy clod
doing that doesn't want to wait in an available parking space or loading
zone space 50 yards or less away.

3e) Educate their citizens that occupied cars waiting for passengers in
an area where parking is prohibited but stopping is not should be doing
the waiting in the curb lane, or portion thereof not marked as a right
turn lane, and to not think that they are better off sitting still with
halves of their cars blocking the bike lane and the other halves in the
right lane of motor vehicle traffic.
Standing still in the curb lane with the driver sitting in the driver's
seat and the key in the ignition switch is legal if parking there is
prohibited but stopping there is not.  As I have been told, in my state
(PA), if the driver is in the car and the key is in the switch, the car is
not parked - the driver is operating the car!  (I also hear it helps
to have the flashers on.)  Good time to have the seatbelt on in case of
ticketing on that basis.

Side note:
If you pull over because you realized after hitting the road that you
"had 1 too many", I have been told that it helps to pull the key out of
the ignition switch.  I suspect maybe also pass out in a seat other than
the driver seat.  Should an officer in borderline jeopardy of failure to
make a ticket quota see you parked while intoxicated with the key in the
switch, that could be bad - the way I heard it, if the key is in the
switch you are operating (driving) the vehicle!

In Philadelphia, this a problem not worsened by presence of bike lanes.

Philly's "drivers" door bikers without bike lanes as badly as they do
ones with bike lanes.  For that matter, a cyclist in Philly in thwe left
portion of a bike lane gets around doors better than one squeezed between
the traffic and the parking lane - as in the portion of Chestnut St west
of 38th, as well as similarly in other streets when they used to similarly
lack bike lanes.

I see mainly in Philadelphia of wide curb lanes as high abuse areas.
I see that the abuse gets decreased (from "extra high" to "high") if the
region between the portion between properly parked cars and the adjacent
traffic lane is marked as a bike lane.

The main intersection conflict I see in bike lanes is drivers
approaching a right turn who shift onto the bike lane before any right
turn signal.  The drivers doing that BS are ticketable!  Where there is
lack of clear legal rquirement of signalling in advance by a legally
required extent such lane-shifting, I expect judges to mostly uphold
tickets for "careless driving" unless the culture even in the courtrooms
got corrupted in that area somehow.

And I see that offenses of vehicle drivers, whether targeted towards
cyclists or being more of equal-opportunity-offense against all road
users, are more common where enforcement of laws regulating use of
vehicles on roads is lower!

&gt;  Side note:
&gt;  If you pull over because you realized after hitting the road that you
&gt; &quot;had 1 too many&quot;, I have been told that it helps to pull the key out of
&gt; the ignition switch.  I suspect maybe also pass out in a seat other than
&gt; the driver seat.  Should an officer in borderline jeopardy of failure to
&gt; make a ticket quota see you parked while intoxicated with the key in the
&gt; switch, that could be bad - the way I heard it, if the key is in the
&gt; switch you are operating (driving) the vehicle!

IIRC, in countries that follow British legal tradition, they have a term
called 'incapacitated in charge', which basically means if the keys are in
your pocket, and you are in the vicinity of the vehicle, you can be nailed.
Like most things, I'm sure that varies from area to area, and how pissed off
or desperate to make their quota the cop is. Around here, I'm told, as long
as the car isn't running, and you are out of the public roadway, you are
probably okay, unless you mouth off to the cop, or look to be in clear and
present danger. Yeah, the cops here tend to park very visibly across the
street from the bars at closing time. And every year, they make examples of
a few bartenders with dram shop law, so the cutoff tends to be on the
conservative side. If a particular bar gets to be a recurring trouble spot,
the license tends to have problems come renewal time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;   I have found bike lanes to do well in San Francisco and Philadelphia.

&gt;&gt;In chicago, if you ride in them you better like getting doored or pinned

&gt;   In Philadelphia, this a problem not worsened by presence of bike lanes.

&gt;   Philly's &quot;drivers&quot; door bikers without bike lanes as badly as they do
&gt; ones with bike lanes.  For that matter, a cyclist in Philly in thwe left
&gt; portion of a bike lane gets around doors better than one squeezed between
&gt; the traffic and the parking lane - as in the portion of Chestnut St west
&gt; of 38th, as well as similarly in other streets when they used to similarly
&gt; lack bike lanes.
">

Most arterials I am familiar with in Chicago have a wide traffic lane. More
than enough for a bicyclist to remain outside the door zone and allow
traffic to safely pass. It varies, but more or less this is the case.
What daley's crews did was paint a bike lane where the left stripe is
just barely outside the door zone. Before the lanes were painted, riding
where this left stripe is or slightly left of it was fine, no conflict or
anything of the sort. Now drivers get pissed off that I am riding outside
the 'bike space' or too close to entering their space. Of course left
hand turns are an issue under this sort of condition as well.

One particular instance NB at 31st street on MLK drive the bike lane
narrows into the curb and is narrower than my handle bars. I haven't seen
this elsewhere, but if they did it once, they probably did it elsewhere
too.

The bike lanes have also become the place where people ride their
scooters of all sorts. Ped traffic has also taken a liking to them in
some instances. Then there are the wrong way riders that at least seem
more numerous.

I generally avoid streets where bike lanes have been painted because of
the worsening of condtions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Drivers would use turn signals at all, use turn signals before turning
&gt;&gt;&gt; rather than when they start turning, use turn signals before rather than
&gt;&gt;&gt; after moving onto a bike lane to make a right turn, use turn signals for
&gt;&gt;&gt; lane changes, and use turn signals before enering/exiting the parking
&gt;&gt;&gt; lane.
&gt;&gt;Wide curb lanes avoid this problem. Intersection conflict is one of the
&gt;&gt;main reasons I don't like bike lanes.
&gt;   I see mainly in Philadelphia of wide curb lanes as high abuse areas.
&gt; I see that the abuse gets decreased (from &quot;extra high&quot; to &quot;high&quot;) if the
&gt; region between the portion between properly parked cars and the adjacent
&gt; traffic lane is marked as a bike lane.
">

I have a very LOW instance of problems with wide curb lanes. The most
abuse I get is, actually on 2 and 4 lane suburban arterials. 4 lane seems
to be the most as many drivers feel I don't get to use those roads at all
and even when there is just me and one motorist for the entire road, I've
had that motorist intentionally brush pass me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are even these newfangled parking meters which actually alert
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the nearest meter maid directly (e.g. via WiFi) when they expire.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It would be trivial to make a newfangled meter that would be able to
&gt;&gt;&gt;detect if the space was ever empty in the last X hours too, since we are
&gt;&gt;&gt;going through the expense of high tech gaget. Actually, I think meters
&gt;&gt;&gt;that reset when the car pulls away already exist.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Even more trivial would be a meter that via WiFi tells the meter maid
&gt;&gt;&gt;that the meter was about to expire and just had another two hours put on
&gt;&gt;&gt;it.

&gt;&gt; Those are great ideas - why are you giving them away to the enemy? For
&gt;&gt; free, no less?

&gt;Because I believed they already existed in some form or another, as I stated
&gt;above. My memory is pretty good... but since you'll want a cite next...
">

So where did you hear about the one that WiFi's the meter maid when
someone feeds the meter?

Heck, why even accept the feeding at all? If the meter can detect that
a car has left the space, it can obviously detect that the car has NOT
left the space, and can say "sorry - this is a two-hour zone" or
somesuch when the owner comes back to put more money in. The owner
would either have to move his car or risk getting a ticket from the
meter maid (who has been alerted via her wireless PDA and is already
on her way).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah - that's why all the stores in downtown Chicago are bankrupt.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;:rolleyes:

&gt;&gt;&gt;Ever wonder why they have shorter hours that suburban stores?

&gt;&gt; From http://www.macys.com

&gt;&gt;  MACY'S STATE STREET  STORE HOURS
&gt;&gt; Friday, March 30:      10:00AM - 9:00PM
&gt;&gt; Saturday, March 31:    9:00AM - 9:00PM
&gt;&gt; Sunday, April 1:       10:00AM - 8:00PM

&gt;Scott digs for the exception and finds it.

LOL!!! That was literally the one and only search I did. Sorry that it
blows your preconceived notions out of the water.

If you like, I suppose I could look up the hours for other stores on
State Street, or stores in Water Tower Place, or stores on Michigan
Avenue. But I really don't have to, now do I? :)
