After 9 weeks of (mostly) remarkable performances, there are just 3
couples left to do two dances for the finals. They will each do a
&quot;judge's pick&quot; dance, and then a free-style of their own choice. For the
free-style there will be no holes barred, and lift are allowable. After
the fan's vote tonight, one couple will be eliminated, and the remaining
two will compete for the mirror ball trophy. They will all dance once
more tomorrow evening, in the final show for this season, but I'm not
sure if the judge's will critique, and those points count. I'm unclear
how it has gone in the previous seasons, as I would think the votes
tonight will actually decide the winner???

Their first performances tonight will be the Judge's pick...so let's get
started!
MEL &amp; MAKS begin this evening with a Cha Cha Cha, which the judges said
was crisp, clean and precise. Len said it was a great performance and
Bruno can't get over just how much she has improved since the season
started, but Carrie Ann said she was expecting more excitement. I always
find myself watching Maks more than I do Mel, and not sure that speaks
that well of HER dancing, but it sure speaks GOOD for his moves! :)
Score= 28

Their free-style was sort of &quot;hodge-podge&quot; for me, although the lifts
were great, but I thought the chair bit at the beginning did nothing for
their performance. Carrie Ann feels she is better than that, Len loved
the humor, and said it was a great performance. Bruno said it just
didn't flow, and was a bit disjointed (my sentiments exactly!) and he
didn't say it very enthusiastically. Score= 27 which I thought was
higher than it deserved?

MARIE &amp; JONATHAN'S 1st dance, chosen by the judges was the Samba, which
was the dance Marie fainted after they had finished, when they did it
awhile ago. They all thought it was entertaining, and there is no
denying that Marie always is. Bruno said she puts her heart and soul
into every performance, and that the Samba is &quot;tricky&quot;. Both Len and
Carrie Ann were critical of her technique, and said she was not the best
dancer, but...again, &quot;very entertaining&quot;. Score= 24

In their free-style dance, Marie was a doll, which I found to be cute,
but then I'm a doll collector! :o) Len said the idea just didn't work,
and Bruno said it was the loopiest dance, and not one he was able to
even critique, other than to say, it was unique, and Carrie Ann said
Marie is a risk taker, but was a odd choice. Score= 22

I noticed the judges seemed tougher tonight, and much more critical, but
I think by now, they expected them to all bring their &quot;A game&quot; to the
floor, and really deliver dazzling performances.

HELIO &amp; JULIANNE did a cute Jive for their first dance of the evening,
and I loved it, as did the audience...they got a thundering ovation from
them, at the end of that, and Carrie Ann said she agreed with the
audience..that it was exciting, but the foot work was not that great.
Len said Helio put the pedal to the metal, but it was disappointing.
Bruno said he has boundless energy, everyone loves him, the performance
was great, BUT...the footwork was not good enough. Score= 27

Their free-style was the final dance of the evening, and it was
awesome..the lifts were incredible! They are just the most adorable
couple together, and it makes me happy just to watch the way they
interact, and captivate the crowd. Not sure if it was Carrie Ann, or Len
that said he was Mr. Irresistible, and they were very difficult lifts
he'd mastered. Carrie Ann complimented them on the technique and the
entertainment value in that dance, but was a little rough around the
lifts, but Bruno said it was the BEST free-style of the night, or maybe
that was Len, that said it, but who cares?! I was just so taken with
that performance, that the judges comments were going in one ear and out
the other. I laughed when Tom said he looked like a Brazilian Power
Ranger! (LOL) Score= 29

As a side note here, Helio made it into the recent issue of People
magazine, as one of 138 guys on the &quot;Hot List&quot;!

Mel &amp; Max are on the top of the board with a 55

2nd place is Helio &amp; Julianne with 54

3rd place is Marie &amp; Jonathan with 46

I gave all my votes to Helio, as I always have (except when I would vote
a few times for Sabrina) and tonight is the first time I had a hard time
getting through, cause of busy phone lines. I hope that's a good sign?!

Who do you think the two finalists will be? I expect Helio to be one,
but of the two gals, it's anybody's guess, though I would say, even
though Mel is the better dancer of the two (my opinion) I think Marie
has a bigger fan base??

All of the season's stars will be back tomorrow night, and special
guest, Celine Dion.

Again, I keep coming back to a personal feeling that DWTS comes the
closest of all reality shows to the judges &quot;picking&quot; the winner. It's
very obvious to me, IMHO, that they want Spice Girl to win (and having
all the Spice Girls there tonight was a big promo for them and the
network).  Their scores, neatly I think, place her in first place and
they still, have one more dance to judge tomorrow.  If that is indeed
the case, then the public's scores would already be known by TPTB, not
that the judges would know them.

Once again, I do not accuse, or think, that the show is fixed in any
way.  I do think, though, that the show really steps right up to that
very fine line without crossing it.  As I've watched it with my wife,
I've lost a lot of respect for how the &quot;pros&quot; judge the performances and
just how much influence they wield.  It puts anything said about AI, way
to shame, IMHO.

Marie may have the bigger fan base, but every week she becomes more
and more unattractive, IMO, by arguing with the judges, LOUDLY talking
back to them, and constantly mentioning her dolls.  Enough, already!
Bruno had it right - there was no way to score that performance,
because it hardly had a single dance step in it.  I thought she came
across as argumentative and ugly (personality-wise).  I hope to God,
she's not one of the two finalists, because that wouldn't be fair to
the more talented Mel B.

Mel B - who knows, she's by far the better dancer of the two women
left.

Helio -he's got all my votes, every week.

All around impression:  The judges should have been this stingy with
high scores during the previous weeks, and not given such over-
inflated ones all along.  Then they could have given more realistic
scores this time without being seen as picky and fussy.

I have to agree with you Nancy - I'm a late comer to the show this
year but I really noticed last night that Marie wouldn't shut up about
the doll designer thing and sort of arguing back with the judges. It
worked against her for me as well.

Judges can't control outcome of 'Dancing'
Compared to officials in non-celeb showdowns, they're practically
powerless
By Ree Hines
MSNBC contributor
updated 9:43 a.m. ET, Mon., Nov. 26, 2007
The judges of ABC's hit show &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot; can't catch a
break. If they don't give a fan favorite a perfect score, the audience
boos them. Even if they declare one celebrity the best hoofer in the
competition, the voters can still override them.

Compared to judges in regular, non-celebrity ballroom showdowns, these
officials are practically powerless, especially when it comes to
selecting the winners of the disco-ball trophy, which happens Tuesday
night for this fifth season of the dance competition.

Then why is it Len Goodman, Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonioli get the
blame whenever controversies arise, as has happened many times this
season? They're in the business of criticism, but fans, celebs and at
least one of the pros don't want to hear it. Maybe the popular opinion
has it that judges shouldn't have unpopular opinions. Or maybe
viewers, and even some soft-shoes, don't realize how little those
score paddles count in the end.

Everybody's a critic
The first big kerfuffle of the season was Liftgate. It all started
innocently enough: Jane Seymour and Tony Dovolani completed a gorgeous
Viennese waltz and waited to hear the praise from the panel. That's
when Carrie Ann nitpicked a possible inch-high, rule-violating lift.
In Jane and Tony's defense, far more egregious lifts were ignored, but
still, a rule's a rule.

Normally that would have been the end of it, but Jane complained in
her blog and Tony took it a step further by going to the tabloids to
defend the dance. He told People, &quot;(Carrie Ann's) the inappropriate
judge to pick on the lifts.&quot; Tony added that the former Fly Girl &quot;does
not have a ballroom background.&quot;

With hardly any time for that little incident to die down, Marie
Osmond put the judges in her sights. Apparently she felt that they
were singling her and Jane out by, well, critiquing their lackluster
performances. &quot;I think they're trying to get the older chicks off the
show, and I say shame on them,&quot; Marie told OK! Magazine.

Even Jane's usually reserved spouse, James Keach, got right into the
fray when he publicly ranted that at least one of his wife's dances
deserved &quot;a much better score than it got.&quot;

Tens for everyone
Oddly enough, the one thing Len and company are guilty of, they rarely
get criticized for. Complaints pour in when they're harsh, but no one
makes a peep when they pass out overly generous scores. Marie and Mr.
Jane may wax annoying about unfair totals, but they ought to be
thankful for some of the out-of-nowhere high scores that everyone
enjoyed this season.

While the latest batch of stars are almost always referred to as &quot;the
most talented yet,&quot; they're not without flubs. But when it's time to
tell it like it is where numbers are concerned, it just doesn't
happen.

For instance, in the semifinal round last week, Bruno reviewed Marie
and Jonathan's mambo and pointed out that she lost her steps &quot;four or
five times.&quot; Ouch! Or not. See, rather than knocking off multiple
points for the infractions, he still gave her a 9. That means Helio
Castroneves' purportedly perfect fox-trot was only one point better
than all those missteps.

The trend didn't start last week, though. No, handing out high scores
like candy has gone on all season. Even the prematurely eliminated
golden girl, Sabrina Bryan, received more than her share of numerical
gifts from the judges. Just four weeks into the competition, she
enjoyed a perfect score for stomping and pushing her way through the
paso doble.

Now in the final stretch, it seems like anything below a 10 is an
insult, requiring boos from the crowd and a round of &quot;Well, I thought
we did great&quot; from the dancers. Somewhere, Cameron Mathison is still
smarting about his seven-worthy Viennese waltz earning only nines.

What's in a score?
The fact of the matter is it hardly matters how many points the judges
award the stars and their partners. Sure, their ballroom credibility's
on the line, but as far as the results go, unless they start giving
out zeros, Len, Bruno and Carrie Ann have little say.

Host Tom Bergeron always reminds the crowd in the home seats that
their votes will be tallied with the judges' scores to determine who
remains in the competition and who gets eliminated. But what he
doesn't explain is the complicated equation used to reach that
conclusion.

After any given performance night, the total scores given to all
couples are combined. Then each score is divided from that sum to
figure out the percentage of the overall scores each couple received.
That's then added to the voting percentages. Follow?

While statistically that means the votes and scores hold equal weight,
in real-world terms, not so much. The voting public isn't required to
cast a little something for everyone, as the officials do. So fans of
Marie can, and apparently do, give all of their allotted votes to
her.

That's why Abercrombie and Fitch model Albert Reed (aka &quot;Who?&quot; to the
TV-viewing masses) got the boot in Week 2, despite dancing circles
around Wayne Newton. It also explains how the dreadful Master P hung
on for four weeks in the second season without even trying to dance.
Much like &quot;American Idol&quot; before it, &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot; is
ultimately a popularity contest.

That means no one can blame the judges if their favorite fails to nab
the disco ball on Tuesday night. Blame some other celeb's massive fan
base. Maybe go in for a vote-count conspiracy. Speculate that the
mythical auto-dialers that kept ballroom billionaire Mark Cuban in the
game for five weeks are back. But as for the judges, their practically
powerless paddles won't be responsible for it.

I have to agree. She has really been kind of mouthy and obnoxious to the

Ah, but Helio is the one who is lifting; Mel B is just being lifted.
I think the lifts are more difficult for a non-pro.  We shall see.

I'm pleased to see I'm not the only one turned off by Marie's
mouthiness.  She maybe is taking her cues from having watched the
American Idol tryouts or something.  Or she's practicing, &quot;the best
defense is a good offense,&quot; trying to keep voters from focusing on her
faults.

&gt;I gave all my votes to Helio, as I always have (except when I would vote
&gt;a few times for Sabrina) and tonight is the first time I had a hard time
&gt;getting through, cause of busy phone lines. I hope that's a good sign?!

&gt;Who do you think the two finalists will be? I expect Helio to be one,
&gt;but of the two gals, it's anybody's guess, though I would say, even
&gt;though Mel is the better dancer of the two (my opinion) I think Marie
&gt;has a bigger fan base??

&gt;All of the season's stars will be back tomorrow night, and special
&gt;guest, Celine Dion.

You know it's not going to be Marie.   *gag*

&gt;Marie may have the bigger fan base, but every week she becomes more
&gt;and more unattractive, IMO, by arguing with the judges, LOUDLY talking
&gt;back to them, and constantly mentioning her dolls.  Enough, already!

Brag, brag, brag.   STHU, Marie!   Thank you for mentioning that.

&gt;Bruno had it right - there was no way to score that performance,
&gt;because it hardly had a single dance step in it.  I thought she came
&gt;across as argumentative and ugly (personality-wise).  I hope to God,
&gt;she's not one of the two finalists, because that wouldn't be fair to
&gt;the more talented Mel B.

&gt;Mel B - who knows, she's by far the better dancer of the two women
&gt;left.

&gt;Helio -he's got all my votes, every week.

&gt;All around impression:  The judges should have been this stingy with
&gt;high scores during the previous weeks, and not given such over-
&gt;inflated ones all along.  Then they could have given more realistic
&gt;scores this time without being seen as picky and fussy.

Exactly.   They gave way too many undeserved 10's, and even 9's, this season.
