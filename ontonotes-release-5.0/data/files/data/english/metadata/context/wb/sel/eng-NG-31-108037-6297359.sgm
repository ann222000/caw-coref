Hi, :-/

Maybe it's a little late for this, but anyways....

Since I could only get myself enrolled for one class this semester, that
means I have way too much free time and I'd rather not bother you guys (too
much...) with my naggings.  I think I'll turn my writing energy (probably
the wrong word) to compose some random fictional short pieces.  I wanted to
write a full-fledge novel, but since that takes a lot of dedication and
careful planning.  That's too much for a just-for-fun project, so I think
at least I could write some chapter-long incidental pieces.  I also want
them to be less personal than my current novel idea, so I can show them to
general public.

Now I have to think of the delivery medium.  Should I post my writings on a
blog?  My LiveJournal is filled with story ideas for the novel (though
public readers can't read them), and I want to be more organized and clean.
It will only contain these new parables about minute detail of life.  Since
the new collection will be totally experimental, I'll ditch my writing
principle and use an omniscent narrator for the first time for the purpose
of connecting all pieces together loosely.  I'll check if I could get a
second account with LiveJournal since most of you (who have a blog) are
there, so networking would be easier done.
