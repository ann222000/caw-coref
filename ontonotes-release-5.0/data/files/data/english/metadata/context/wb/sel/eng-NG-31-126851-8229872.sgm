OPPOSITION leader Bruce Golding has come out strongly against any
change in legislation to sanction homosexuality in Jamaica, even as
members of that community are moving for greater acceptance among
locals.

According to Golding, the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) of which he is
president, is not prepared to go against the cultural norms of the
Jamaican society, which are largely anti-same sex relationships.

&quot;Let us be very clear. There are some countries that are prepared to
overturn tradition and culture in the interest of what they regard
as individual freedoms and to do so at the instance of the
homosexual fraternity, which comprises a minority in the population.
You will find this pretty prevalent in Europe.

Police rescue three men accused of being homosexuals in Tropical
Plaza in February this year after one of them doused a woman with a
liquid substance. The woman had drawn attention to what she saw as
the men's effeminate behaviour. Psychologists say it's only a matter
of time before Jamaicans will be forced to accept the homosexual
lifestyle.

We (the JLP) are not prepared to go in that direction,&quot; he told the
Sunday Observer. &quot;We intend to uphold the laws of the country.&quot;

At the same time, he made it clear that the JLP was not prepared to
intrude on people in the privacy of their bedrooms, even as the
party sought to ensure that the laws of the land are upheld.

&quot;We don't believe that the state should be pushing down people's
bedroom doors to find what they do there, because, if you push it
down today to enforce laws that relate to sexual activity, you will
push it down tomorrow for some other purpose. So we are not going
there,&quot; he said.

&quot;We respect the privacy of people's homes and we respect the
intimacy of people's bedrooms. But in so far as providing official
sanction to that kind of activity [homosexuality], we are not going
there,&quot; Golding added.

If, however, people opt to engage in public displays of
homosexuality, then he said there was no question that they would be
made to answer for their actions.

&quot;If you walk around in your bedroom naked, that is your business.
You're in the privacy of your bedroom. But if you walk around the
streets naked, you would have violated the law,&quot; the JLP leader
said.

&quot;There is a sharp distinction between what is permissible in terms
of the public and what is permitted in your own bedroom. We are not
prepared to interfere with people's privacy, but we feel that we
must be sensitive to the culture of the country,&quot; he added.

According to Golding, individual rights must be seen within the
context of a society's culture.

&quot;There have been some amendments to laws to ensure that people's
rights and freedoms are respected, but bear in mind that individual
rights must be established within the context of the norms and
culture and moral predilection of a society and therefore, that is
our position,&quot; he said.

Golding's statements come at a time when sociologists and at least
one academic are predicting an increase in violence against people
of the same sex, who openly express affection for each other or
engage in cross-dressing.

One psychologist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
homosexuals were searching for acceptance, as evidenced by the case
of the young male cross-dresser who was beaten in Falmouth, Trelawny
on April 27 this year.

The psychologist believes, however, that their efforts are made in
futility at this stage since Jamaica is an island with a culture
that is profoundly anti-homosexual.

&quot;It is a sort of pushing and pulling. While the homosexual is being
influenced by North America, it is like the Jamaican identity is
being compromised. So you practise your homosexuality in private,
but don't you come forward because this is who we are,&quot; the
psychologist said.

Beyond that, she said Jamaica had a reputation as anti-homosexuality
to uphold so that the harder members of the gay community pushed for
acceptance, the harder the heterosexual Jamaican will resist.

&quot;But we in Jamaica have a reputation and we have a reputation to
uphold and our reputation is that we are homophobic and anybody who
come with it is going to be knocked down,&quot; she said. &quot; We perceive
ourselves as being homophobic so any sense of anybody (gay) peeping
through, don't cross the line because we have the distinction.
Jamaica is known for this so any semblance of this is going to meet
with resistance.&quot;

Psychologist Sidney McGill echoed his colleague's sentiment on the
matter, noting that homosexuals, at least at this stage, were
fighting a losing battle.

But unlike his colleague, McGill said there is clearly a thriving
homosexual community on the island. What is more, he said it is only
a matter of time before Jamaicans will have no choice, but to accept
the lifestyle.

&quot;I think that the heterosexual community in the society, in their
fear of homosexuality, are unwilling to look further than their
noses. If they were to look beyond their noses, they would see a
thriving alternate homosexual community living underground,&quot; McGill
told the Sunday Observer.

&quot;This community has intelligent professionals from almost every
field, including academia, and do carry a lot of power even if the
power is invisible. The power has been invisible and with time, it
will become visible, which is what we are now seeing more and more
of - the boldness and the courage, these courageous displays. They
meet in the night, among themselves and have their parties, etc. Now
they are meeting in the day and in public.&quot;

The island's acceptance of the US culture, he said, is such that it
will drive acceptance of homosexuality over time.

&quot;We are influenced a lot by the North American scene, it is just a
matter of time before the majority of Jamaicans will have to accept
homosexuality as a viable alternative lifestyle,&quot; McGill said.

Meanwhile, like his colleague, he said homosexuals were on a mission
for acceptance.

&quot;It is indicative of the homosexual in the community becoming
bolder, on a mission of coming out of the closet in a collective
sense. And you have homosexual communities that are attached to
gangs and they get some amount of protection from the gangs, which
allows them to come out without too much fear,&quot; said, McGill who
sees an average of three homosexuals at the family and counselling
centre of which he is boss.

Sociologist Dr Orville Taylor agreed with the psychologists that
while acceptance is perhaps inevitable, there was no question that
open affection among homosexuals would prompt violence from
Jamaicans.

&quot;You going to have a gay backlash because they are pushing a little
far and too hard, and in doing so it does appear as if they are
discriminating against people,&quot; Taylor told the Sunday Observer,
echoing his predictions of two years ago. &quot;There is a big difference
between what you call giving quality treatment toward one and
predicting that group, and in fact I think that what a number of gay
activists were seeking went a little beyond seeking equality.

And most important, when they try to take action against individuals
who have economic relationships with large groups of people.&quot;

The sociologist added a caution to members of the homosexual
community, noting that Jamaica, at this time, was not ready to
openly sanction homosexuality. Further, he said that in pushing too
hard for acceptance, they were defeating their own cause.
&quot;The majority of people in this country are not pro-gay.

The gays are fighting a losing battle. If it comes to a
confrontation, the gay community and the acceptance level is going
to be set back decades because it is a battle that people who are on
their side and in strategic positions are not willing to fight,&quot; he
said.

&quot;This is a country that is not yet ready for transvestism in public,
and bear in mind the kind of antipathies which have existed are now
open hostilities.

The gay community has taken on the dancehall culture, and when you
take on the dancehall culture you take on almost an entire
population. And it is the dancehall population that wins and loses
elections, and the politicians know this.&quot;

&quot;[T]he job of the gay community is not to deal with extremists who
would castigate us or put us on an island and drop an H-bomb on us.
The fact of the matter is that there is a small percentage of people
in America who understand the true nature of the homosexual
community. There is another small percentage who will never
understand us. Our job is not to get those people who dislike us to
love us. Nor was our aim in the civil rights movement to get
prejudiced white people to love us. Our aim was to try to create the
kind of America, legislatively, morally, and psychologically, such
that even though some whites continued to hate us, they could not
openly manifest that hate. That's our job today: to control the
extent to which people can publicly manifest antigay sentiment.&quot;
