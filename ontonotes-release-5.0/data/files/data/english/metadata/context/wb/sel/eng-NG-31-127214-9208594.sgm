Sure, start blaming the receivers for that interception.

Smith didn't have to throw it.

You have a QB now that has zero touchdowns in 3 weeks,
and the lowest total yards of offense in Football.

Yet your defense is stout.

When --if ever-- does a conversation start about benching
this borderline worthless quarterback ?

Well, here are the questions:

Is the problem Smith's consistently bad decision-making?

Or is the problem that the offense is generally outclassed by the
defense?

The int was a ball Smith shouldn't have thrown.  On the other hand, with
the exception of the second quarter and the pick, Smith has actually
looked pretty good today.  He's thrown the ball away in the face of
pressure.

We lost to a better team today.

Lastly, why on earth do you think Dilfer would be an improvement?

In the Cardinals game, Smith couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. But
that's not the problem of this game. If Smith was still looking like
that, I would agree with you that we had a quarterbacking crisis.

But he's not. He's putting the ball where he wants to on almost all of
his throws. He's - the INT. excepted - making reasonable decisions with
the ball.

I am MORE concerned by the failures of our running game - which was
supposed to be a strength - than I am by what's going on with our QB.
Gore is consistently getting hit at the line of scrimmage, and has been
in all three games.

Ug. This is getting ugly at the end here.

Well, there's a 0% chance of our getting someone better than Smith this
season. It's just not going to happen. QB's better than him are not
available.

So it doesn't make any sense to me to do anything other than continue to
evaluate him, at least until the end of this season.

I'm not throwing out the Arizona. It was abysmal. As bad as he was at
the beginning of last year.  But he's been a lot better since that game,
and he was a lot better in his previous six or seven starts. So I think
that game is probably an anomaly.

The second quarter was very disappointing, and I'm not trying to
sugarcoat that. But it's strange to me how people on this newsgroup will
jump all over Smith for every mistake, and not give him any credit for
the stuff he's doing right. And he did a lot right today.

The INT was a bad throw, as I wrote the moment it was caught.

Judging a quarterback by the result of the game is, quite frankly,
stupid.  For example, when the Niners had a second-and-ten early in the
fourth quarter, Alex Smith dropped back to pass, there was a huge rush,
and he threw it away.

That's the right play (and not a play Smith would have made early last
year). It wasn't a productive play because the o-line was overwhelmed,
but given those circumstances, what else do you expect? That's an
example of &quot;intellectualizing high speed solutions.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I mean, what now,, are  we giving A's to smith just for effort now ?
">

No.

He made a lot of good throws in this game, but it wasn't enough. You're
ignoring the first half of that sentence because of the first half.

I don't know if Alex Smith is the ultimate solution for this team. I've
never claimed that he was, and I've never said &quot;give him an 'A'.&quot; I do
think, however, that you're judging him harshly based on things that are
out of his control in this game.

I do know that, right now, our inability to run the ball is a bigger
problem than our passing game.

You might be pleasantly surprised at how much better the passing game would
get if defenses had to fear Gore again. However, they are challenging the
Niners to beat them through the air, and as long as they don't, you'll
continue to see 8 and 9 men in the box.

I don't find this argument completely compelling, because Gore was
successful in the first half of last year, when Smith was commanding
considerably less respect than he does today.

Today, the Steeler's NT was consistently bottling up two or three niner
linemen. You don't need 8 men in the box when their DL is stuffing your
offensive line.

They are interrelated.  The common thread is that the offensive line is
not playing real well through the first 3 games of this year.  That does
not excuse Alex Smith for being a mediocre QB though.

Yeah, but if you're looking to a player who has played two really bad
games as an upgrade, you're probably looking in the wrong place.  Alex
Smith has had good games in the past as well.

My point earlier is that Leinart is further along than Smith already
despite having played half as many games.

How much an upgrade it would be right now is minimal at best, but it's
hopeful he's be better down the line than Smith is now. Regardless it
isn't going to happen, so it's a moot point.

This isn't entirely clear.

Leinart played in a pro-style system in college. He had a much-smaller
adjustment to make into the pros. Smith, on the other hand, has never
had to deal with a pro offense.

Leinart was expected to be much more polished the moment he entered the
pros. Smith, everyone acknowledged, was a couple of years away.

I'm willing to be patient with Smith so long as he continues to improve.
At the end of the season, if Smith isn't finding better consistency,
then, yes, it'll make sense to start thinking about doing better.  But
to expect him to display Leinart-like polish is unrealistic, and doesn't
recognize the tremendous differences in how they were prepared for the
NFL.

Teams are loading up on the run and our passing game isn't scaring
anyone.

Today, they did do better with the protection and if Smith didn't pull a
Jittery Jeff a few plays or if the WRs didn't drop balls, they might
have made it more interesting.

Actually, that incomplete call after video review of the VD catch around
the 9 could have made a difference.

Even though he looked better than he has in the first two games, they
need to draft another QB.  Doesn't have to be some high-profile guy,
maybe a project if someone drops.  Or maybe a FA acquisition.  Again,
doesn't have to be an immediate starter but you know Dilfer isn't going

If you remember though, Smith made some big plays in the first two games
of last year at Arizona and against Rams at home.

Bryant was a home run threat which we don't seem to have this year.

That's why the conservative playcalling and the checkdowns are
frustrating.  We didn't draft a guy with the #1 pick to dink and dunk
and just manage the game or hope that your defense would win it for you.

True. While I'm not denying Smith must improve, there are
times when his receivers havent helped by dropping passes.

I would have liked for the Niners to been more aggressive
with the Cardinals and Rams. They were on to something
last season and they deviated from it at the beginning of
this season.

&gt;This isn't entirely clear.

&gt;Leinart played in a pro-style system in college. He had a much-smaller
&gt;adjustment to make into the pros. Smith, on the other hand, has never
&gt;had to deal with a pro offense.

&gt;Leinart was expected to be much more polished the moment he entered the
&gt;pros. Smith, everyone acknowledged, was a couple of years away.

&gt;I'm willing to be patient with Smith so long as he continues to improve.
&gt;At the end of the season, if Smith isn't finding better consistency,
&gt;then, yes, it'll make sense to start thinking about doing better.  But
&gt;to expect him to display Leinart-like polish is unrealistic, and doesn't
&gt;recognize the tremendous differences in how they were prepared for the
&gt;NFL.

New OC, who hasn't had any proffesional OC experience.

Chargers waited so long to fire their coach, Norv Turner was one of
the few options left and that left even fewer options for the 49ers to
replace Turner so they were kind of stuck with Hostler.  This really
sucks cause if Hostler doesn't improve then we will have to go on our

That's true about Hostler's experience at OC, but he was with
the club last season, and apparently knew enough about the
offense to say in public that he was going to add some things
to what Turner had brought in.

Although I agree that Alex hasn't been the second coming of Joe Montana, I'm
not convinced that he won't get any better. He has looked good at times,
particularly late in games. Unfortunately, it's in the beginning and middle
that he seems to struggle. I sure wish Norv had stuck around.

It might help if Gore performs better. He's been disappointing this year
too.

Hopefully, they can find a decent WR in the draft next year. Incidentally,
where the hell has Jason Hill been? Is he hurt?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; continue to see 8 and 9 men in the box.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't find this argument completely compelling, because Gore was
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; successful in the first half of last year, when Smith was commanding
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; considerably less respect than he does today.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Today, the Steeler's NT was consistently bottling up two or three niner
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; linemen. You don't need 8 men in the box when their DL is stuffing your
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; offensive line.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If you remember though, Smith made some big plays in the first two games
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;of last year at Arizona and against Rams at home.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Bryant was a home run threat which we don't seem to have this year.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Bryant wasn't much of any kind of threat.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;True. While I'm not denying Smith must improve, there are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;times when his receivers havent helped by dropping passes.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I would have liked for the Niners to been more aggressive
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;with the Cardinals and Rams. They were on to something
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;last season and they deviated from it at the beginning of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;this season.

&gt; &gt;&gt; New OC, who hasn't had any proffesional OC experience.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Chargers waited so long to fire their coach, Norv Turner was one of
&gt; &gt;&gt; the few options left and that left even fewer options for the 49ers to
&gt; &gt;&gt; replace Turner so they were kind of stuck with Hostler.  This really
&gt; &gt;&gt; sucks cause if Hostler doesn't improve then we will have to go on our
&gt; &gt;&gt; 4th OC in 4 years, unless Norv gets fired and we can grab him back.

&gt; &gt;That's true about Hostler's experience at OC, but he was with
&gt; &gt;the club last season, and apparently knew enough about the
&gt; &gt;offense to say in public that he was going to add some things
&gt; &gt;to what Turner had brought in.

&gt; What do you expect him to say, I've been thrown into the fire and have
&gt; no clue what to do.  I'm sure he knows the play book, but there is
&gt; more to calling plays then reading out of a playbook.

He was he thrown into the fire? He interviewed for
the job, and I don't think he was forced to do it.

Hostler was a candidate, along with wide receivers coach
Jerry Sullivan. And I think Nolan wanted to interview
someone on another team's staff but was denied the
chance.
