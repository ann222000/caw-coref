I've been at my first ever Arts &amp; Crafts show where I sold
my very FIRST QUILT! Woot! Elation!
And it was hothothothot. I think I drank almost an entire
gallon of water and that was just barely enough to keep
me hydrated.
I've always felt that Carmine didn't miss me as
much as he does DH because I'm not the primary feeder but tonight when I
got home after having been gone for 15 hours he was elated to see me as
usual but for the first time since he's lived with us he actually stayed
in the bathroom with me while I took a shower to sluice off some of the
sweat. But wait!
There's more!
We have a shower curtain so he poked his head in
to keep tabs on me, another first for him.
I turned my back to him and then I heard an odd noise...
Oh yeah.
There he was at the other end of the bathtub, big goofy
grin on his face, catching water from the shower head
in his mouth.
Good grief. This must be his way of catching up for
letting me have solitary bathroom time.
I think this is what they call &quot;going too far&quot;.

Love is a beautiful thing.  Love is a double-edged sword.  Want to borrow
Sammie to shut Carmine out of the bathroom for you?

He just wanted to make sure that you didn't &quot;escape&quot; again.

If it were the schnauzers - who *hate* water - it would be proof of true
love.  For a lab, I dunno, it might just be another opportunity to get wet!

We once had a beagle who would regularly jump into the shower with DH.  We
started keeping some doggy shampoo in there.  He would lather her up and
rinse her off while he was in there.  It makes for some great memories of
her!

Yes, you have gone too far. You were gone forever, abandoning your Lab
and then you wanted to keep your Lab from water? Good grief, what's
next? Feeding your Lab controlled amounts of food on a schedule?

I'm glad that I have a glass door on my shower.  While Carmine's
shower foray would make me laugh, it could get old quickly.

But it's certainly a cool next step in your relationship with

Yeah, I'm pretty sure that that, plus the type of low-end
show it was was a huge contributing factor.
The hottest (har!) selling item there was cold beer, cold
icees and those neck tie things that you get wet to
cool your neck off.
Gah!
I'm still trying to drink myself into a water stupor.

Congratulations on selling a quilt.  If I ever completed one I would
never let it go.  I made a baby quilt one time and it seemed to take me
forever...Sounds like a fun homecoming after a hot day.

It would be crazy, alright, but a very fun kind of crazy.  Just think
what the world would be like if it were run by labs and mini poodles.  To
borrow from John Lennon's vision, imagine all the people, laughing in
harmony...  You can't commit crimes when you are laughing so hard that
you have to use all your energy not to pee your pants.

Today, Sammie decided that he just had to get a drink from my glass of
water.  He wasn't dying of thirst.  The dog bowl was full.  But obviously
my water was better and he knew I wouldn't mind if he took just a little
sip.  I must have been putting it out of his reach out of absent-
mindedness.  The hijinks were hilarious, though they might not have been
had I not been careful to ensure that the glass was out of poodle reach.

Yup.  I like it.  I like it enough to ask the name of the block.  I'm
guessing you don't like it because you prefer bright colors and aren't
as big on creams and browns.  I think it would look terrific in a room
filled with natural woods and guess that the buyer was probably thinking
that too.

That particular quilt drew more men into my booth than
any other item in there. I don't know what it is about
that pattern but men seem to love it and it's not often a guy
will willingly enter a place of fabric or quilting on his own.
It's my husband's favorite quilt as well.

Would you be willing to do a commissioned quilt?  If I could get Queen
Faith worked into an Egyptian looking quilt, that would be the coolest
thing ever.  Well, maybe not as cool as the six foot tall sarcophagus
cabinet, but, way way cool.  Totally.

Email me and we'll discuss business.

Wait...why do you want a sarcophagus? I ask because previously you
mentioned not having a crate big enough for the girls AND the dogs
and I already know your capacity for evil has no boundaries.

&gt;&gt; Although I'm partiucularly enamoured of the bearclaw!!!

&gt; That particular quilt drew more men into my booth than
&gt; any other item in there. I don't know what it is about
&gt; that pattern but men seem to love it and it's not often a guy
&gt; will willingly enter a place of fabric or quilting on his own.
&gt; It's my husband's favorite quilt as well.

&gt; Well, if you think I'm going to have a baby for Carmine, GUESS AGAIN

But Carmine so WANTS you to have a baby.

Look, you never know when law enforcement might try to google up some
evidence.  All I'm gonna say is I have a 12 year old daughter.  She
wants an Egyptian themed room.  Authenticity is always good.  Mummies
can't talk back.  Wrappings cost a hell of a lot less than what
teenaged girls deem an acceptable wardrobe.  There's no reason at all
to go along with Anna's desire to have a sarcophagus in her room other
than the love that I have for my daughter and wish to see her every
dream fulfilled, of course.
