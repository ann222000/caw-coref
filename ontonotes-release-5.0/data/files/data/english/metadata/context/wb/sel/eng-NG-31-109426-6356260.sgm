Let's Live A Life Of Praise Unto
the Lord
Psa 9:2  I will be glad
and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most
High.

Quote
God
makes a promise; faith believes it, hope anticipates it, patience quietly
awaits it.

Today's Verses - KJV
John
10:7-11  Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto
you, I am the door of the sheep. All that ever came before me are thieves
and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by me if any
man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find
pasture. The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to
destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it
more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life
for the
sheep.

My Comments
There is only one door into the kingdom of God;
Jesus Christ. Those who are trying to get in another way are thieves and
robbers and will not get there. Those who do not believe in Christ are
dead in their sins. The one and only way to life is by Jesus Christ. Some
call this legalistic and narrow minded. This is what caused all the early
disciples to be ridiculed and some were put to death. The gospel is an
offense to some but it is the only way to be eternally saved. That is why
we keep telling it like it is, even though some hate us. We love the Lord
and minister to all who will let us, even if they hate us! We have met the
one who gave His life for us; so we give our all to Him and serve Him with
gladness, because He is The Way, The Truth and The Life. He who gave His
life for us will keep and protect us, if we will allow Him to. Is He your
Shepherd? Meditate on it!

Prayer
Father God, thank You for the gift of life that
is in Jesus Christ. Grant us the anointing to be more effective ministers
of the gospel. We ask, believe we receive, and give thanks in
the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Let's Live A Life Of Praise Unto

Psa 9:2  I will be glad
and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most
High.

Quote
Though Christ a
thousand times in Bethlehem be born, If he's not born in thee thy soul is
still forlorn.  ANGELUS SILESIUS
(1624–1677)

Today's Verses - KJV
John 10:14-18  I am the
good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father
knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the
sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I
must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and
one shepherd. Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my
life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it
down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it
again. This commandment have I received of my
Father.

My Comments
No one took the life of Jesus; He gave His life
for "Whosoever will". He didn't wait for us to believe, He did it so we
could believe! While He died and was buried, He didn't stay in the grave.
He came forth on the third day and is alive forever more. He ever lives to
make intercession for those who believe in Him. The next time you are
sorely tried, remember we have much more going for us than against us.
Praise the Lord! He died, not just for one group or one nation; He died
for all who would believe in Him. Christians are the only group who serve
a living Savior! Others are trusting in one who is dead and in their
grave. Meditate on it!

Prayer
Father God, thank You for the gift of salvation
through Your only begotten Son. Thank You for the gift of the Holy Ghost
who shows us Him. &lt;b style="FONT-WEIGHT: ...

Let's Live A Life Of Praise Unto
the Lord
Isa
62:9  But they that have gathered it shall eat it and praise the LORD; and they that
have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my
holiness.

Quote
Eternity will not be long
enough to learn all he is, or to praise him for all he has done, but then,
that matters not; for we shall be always with him, and we desire nothing
more.  FREDERICK WILLIAM FABER (1814–1863)

Today's Verses - KJV
John 10:27-30  My sheep hear my voice, and
I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and
they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to
pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are
one.

My
Comments
Those who belong to the Lord hear His voice and
another they will not listen to or follow. He is always leading in the
paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Those who are in Christ were
given to Him by the Father. No one is able to take us out of the hand of
Christ. Praise the Lord! No one, not even satan, has the authority or
power to remove us from Christ! The only one who can remove us, is we
ourselves. We are commanded to abide in Christ so we will bear much fruit.
He is our strength, ability, and life. It's not us that live but Christ in
us that lives! That is why it is eternal! Are we abiding and bearing the
fruit that shows we are? Are we allowing Him to live in and through us? If
we are it will be a life of holiness and righteousness in Jesus Christ.
Meditate on it!

Prayer
Father God, show us Jesus clearer than we have
seen Him before. We desire to abide in Him and bear the fruit that we are.
May the things we do and say show Christ is in us. We ask, believe we
receive and give thanks in Your Name, Lord Jesus. Amen.

Let's Live A Life Of Praise Unto
the Lord
Psa 9:14  That I may
show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy
salvation.

Quote
At
death we cross from one territory to another, but we'll have no trouble
with visas. Our representative is already there, preparing for our
arrival. As citizens of heaven, our entrance is incontestable. ERWIN
W. LUTZER (1941– )

Today's Verses - KJV
John
11:11-14  These things said he: and after that he saith unto them,
Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. Howbeit
Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of
rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is
dead.

My Comments
Everyone of us who are in Christ were, before
receiving Christ, as dead spiritually as Lazarus was naturally. God
declared all dead so He could have mercy on all who would believe in His
only begotten Son, Jesus Christ. That is grace! We had nothing and had
done nothing to merit forgiveness. Forgiveness is the gift of God. Jesus
Christ will give life to all who repent and believe in Him. Believing in
Christ requires us to find out what He says do and don't do and become
doers of that. Here is what He says about this - Luke 6:46  And why
call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? Here is what
the Holy Spirit said in - 1 John 2:3-4  And hereby we do know that
we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that saith, I know him, and
keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in
him. Are you a doer of His Word?
Are you keeping His commandments as proof that you truly know Him? Those
who don't, don't know Him!  Meditate on
it!

Psa 21:13  Be thou
exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy
power.

Quote
We can prove
our faith by our committal to it, and in no other way. Any belief that
does not command the one who holds it is not a real belief; it is a pseudo
belief only. And it might shock some of us profoundly if we were brought
suddenly face to face with our beliefs and forced to test them in the
fires of practical living.
A. W. TOZER
(1897–1963)

Today's Verses - KJV
John 11:23-26  Jesus
saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith unto him, I
know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus
said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in
me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou
this?

My Comments
Believing is much more than mouthing the words,
"I Believe." One can be in the road with a big truck bearing down on them
and say "I believe I can get out of the way" but if he doesn't start
putting one foot in front of the other he will be an item on the evening
news! Our belief must be put into action. If we truly believe in the Lord
we will find out what He says and become a doer of all He said. That is
the only way to be truly established in Him, unmovable and unshakable in
the storms we all face. We show our belief by what we say and do. If our
profession of faith, saying we believe, doesn't move us to works that show
we believe; it's not real believing! Believing will assure us of eternal
life. Jesus is The resurrection and The life. You show me you believe
without your works and I will show I believe by my works! Meditate on
it!

Jer
17:14  Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall
be saved: for thou art my praise .

Quote
The Gospels do not explain
the Resurrection; the Resurrection explains the Gospels. Belief in the
Resurrection is not an appendage to the Christian faith; it is the
Christian faith.  JOHN S. WHALE

Today's Verses - KJV
John 11:41-44  Then they took away the
stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his
eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew
that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I
said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus
had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that
was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face
was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let
him go.

My
Comments
Some seem to believe that
when a person dies that is the end of them. The Bible teaches us plainly,
that is not true. Here is what Jesus said about this in John 5:28-29  Marvel
not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the
graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done
good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto
the resurrection of damnation. There will be
a resurrection for all those who have passed on in death. They will be
bodily cast into hell or be forever with the Lord. We will have a new
body, like the Lord's body. 1 Cor
15:53  For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
must put on immortality. I will have a
body that won't need to have an artificial leg to be able to walk. I lost
my left leg in a hunting accident when I was nine years old. I am doing
great for a man that has one leg in the grave! All our aches and pains
will be gone forever. We will have a new body, Praise the Lord. Meditate
on it!

Prayer
Father God, thank You for the resurrection. Give
us Your strength and ability to live so we will be among those in the
resurrection of life, in Christ Jesus. We ask, believe we receive and give
thanks in Your Name, Lord Jesus. Amen.

PENN
Envy
is like a fly that passes all a body's sounder parts and dwells upon the
sores.
GEORGE CHAPMAN (C. 1559–1634)

Today's Verses - KJV
John
11:47-48  Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a
council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. If we let
him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and
take away both our place and
nation.

My Comments
The chief Priests and Pharisees were the church
leaders and they were envious and jealous of Jesus. He was getting more
attention than they were! They were afraid they would lose their jobs!
There are many in church who are like that in this generation. Some, when
a new convert comes in and begins to work with a zeal to do something for
the Lord, get angry with them. They accuse them of trying to show them up
and are jealous of the attention given the new convert. They believe they
should be running the church and don't welcome any help from some new
person. They have their own little click going. Some are in church, and
desire to be leaders, because it's good for their business. Beloved, this
should not be in the house of the Lord. A church like that will never grow
and be blessed of the Lord. Meditate on it!

Psa 22:22  I will
declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.

Quote
1 Cor
12:27  Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in
particular.

Today's Verses - KJV
John 12:3-5  Then took
Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet
of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with
the odour of the ointment. Then saith one of his disciples, Judas
Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, Why was not this ointment
sold for three hundred pence, and given to the
poor?

My Comments
While we may not be able, as Mary did, to bestow
a blessing on the physical body of Christ; when we minister to a brother
or sister in Christ we are ministering to Christ! What we do, good or bad,
to a member of His body; He takes it very personal. The church, made up of
true believers in Christ, are counted as His body. Sometimes we pick and
choose who we will minister to instead of letting the Lord direct us.
Being a respecter of persons is not becoming to one who loves the Lord.
Are we taking advantage of the opportunities to minister to Christ by
ministering to those we come in contact with? The more we take advantage
of those opportunities, the more opportunities we will have! Meditate on
it!

Prayer
Father God, direct us in all we do. Forgive us
when we don't be a vessel You can minister through. Give us eyes to
see others as You see them. We ask, believe we ...

Jer
20:13  Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath
delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.

Quote
1 John 2:15-17  Love
not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love
the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  For all that is in
the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride
of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth
away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for
ever.
If I walk with the world, I can't walk with God.
DWIGHT LYMAN MOODY (1837–1899)

Today's Verses - KJV
John 12:23-25  And Jesus answered them,
saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and
die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He
that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this
world shall keep it unto life eternal.

My
Comments
One who loves the world and
the things that are happening in it, the lust of the flesh, the lust of
the eyes, and the pride of life is not of the Holy Spirit but is of the
world and will not endure forever. We are to love sinners but not what
they do. Their works are of the world. We are citizens of heaven and this
world is not our home. We are just passing through. Only those who are
doing the will of God will abide forever! Praise the Lord. You may ask,
"What is the will of God"? It is clearly outlined in the Word of God. It
starts and ends with abiding in Christ and bearing the fruit that we are.
Sad, but many who claim to love the Lord are in love with the world and
are trying to have both; a love for the Lord and a love for the world.
Beloved, we cannot have both. We must turn loose of one! The question is,
which one will it be? Here is what the Word of God says - 2 Cor 6:17-18
Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord,
and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, And will be a
Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord
Almighty. The sons and daughters of
God have done this. Meditate on it!

Prayer
Father God, thank You for the new birth that
causes us to see the world and the things of the world as You see them.
Give us a heart to love the sinner and minister to him as You direct, but
to not love the deeds they do. We ask, believe we receive and give thanks
in Your Name, Lord Jesus. Amen.

Psa 22:22  I will
declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.

Quote
John 1:8-9  He was not
that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.  That was the
true Light, which lighteth every
man that cometh into the world.

Today's Verses - KJV
John
12:31-33  Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of
this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw
all men unto me. This he said, signifying what death he should
die.

My Comments
Jesus was lifted up on the cross, between the
earth and heaven, between man and God. He and He alone is the way to know
The Father, God Almighty, as our Father in heaven. There is none other
name known under heaven by which man must be saved. When we witness we are
not lifting up Christ, we are telling that He was lifted up! Beloved, it is
past tense, the work completed and whosoever will can be saved by
repenting and believing on Him, who was lifted up. That is the good news
of the gospel. Notice it says He lights every man that comes into the
world. He draws them unto Himself. As we witness we are not there by
ourselves. Christ is there drawing unto Himself! Do we know that deep
inside of every man there is a vacant spot that only Jesus Christ can
fill! Before surrendering to Christ I knew something was missing in my
life, I just didn't know what to do about it. I tried everything but
nothing filled the empty place in me. Then I repented and received Jesus
Christ as Savior and Lord. Then I found what I was looking for. I had
peace, abiding peace, in my heart for the first time. Praise the Lord! The
hardest person to reach with the gospel is one who has been given false
hope by trusting in something or someone other than Christ. Is Christ your
life? Meditate on it!
