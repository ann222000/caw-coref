My son lives in San Francisco, and would like me to re-wire some of his
house. It's pretty old and he says it has knobs and tubes wiring. What is
that, and how difficult would it be to replace whatever is there with
current outlets, and maybe upgrade his entire electrical service?

Knob-and-tube is the oldest style of wiring.  Individual wires run between
ceramic knob insulators nailed to the framing, and run through ceramic
tubes wherever a wire has to go through wood.  I don't think any house has
been built this way since the 1930's.  The only way to upgrade
knob-and-tube wiring is to abandon it and run new cable to new outlets and
fixtures.  If you have access to the attic and a basement or crawlspace,
this may be possible without ripping the walls open.  If the building
still has the original service entrance, that will have to be upgraded to
comply with the current electrical code.  That's a job for a licensed
contractor.  Think second mortgage.

It is &quot;Knob and Tube&quot;, there are no 's' at the end.  It useses single
insulated wire, hollow ceramic tubes with a ring at one end.  These are
used to pass wire through wood studs and beams.  The knobs are two piece
ceraminc insulators with grooves to hold two wires, and a nail to hold
them against a piece of wood.

All, now that I see pictures of this, yes, I've seen this in old historic
buildings.

I re-wired a good bit of our house 20 years ago, but it already had modern
hardware. I added several new circuits and replaced the circuit box. Of
course, I was much more agile then, and this might require some acrobatics
to remove all the old stuff.

I think I'll talk to a pro around here before venturing off to SF. We have
quite a few historic and just plain old buildings here. Perhaps then
following up with a pro in SF might shed some light on the situation there.
He lives in essentially row houses, that is, about 20 houses are side by
side in a block. Maybe the locals have some ideas about the matter.

I would think at a minimum his house could be helped by putting in new three
prong grounded sockets.

I live in SF too, and have seen a lot of old houses with knob and tube
wiring, and owned one, an 1892 Victorian, once. I ripped out all the
k+t and replaced it with Romex.

http://www.oldhouseweb.com/stories/Detailed/10327.shtml

Knob and tube is found almost exclusively in attics and ground-floor
garages, so most or all of it should be accessable. It's not hard to
rip it out, replace it with Romex, and install new, grounded outlet
boxes. People often leave light switches and ceiling lights alone, in
situations where the wires are inside walls and the current is low.
Just install a junction box to make the romex-to-old-stuff transition.

Longterm, k+t is hazardous, as the junctions were just twisted and
taped, not in boxes, and are not able to stand up to modern
high-current loads, so become fire hazards.

If the service entrance and fuse/breaker box are not up to modern
requirements, you're pretty much faced with hiring electricians and
getting permits.

Discount Builders, on Mission street, is a good place to buy stuff, if
you don't feel like trekking down to Home Depot.

As the knob-and-tube wiring doesn't have the green safety ground wire
run to each outlet, simply replacing the existing 2 pin outlets with
new 3 pin outlets won't do anything for safety, as there is no way to
ground the third pin.

It's certainly easy enough to run a third wire to a pipe. At worst, I can
drive copper pipe into the ground outside the house and bring it in where
needed.

Thanks for the local view on the matter.

He's on 47th Street near the zoo. Are Discount Builders anywhere near there?
I think there's a HD about 1.5 miles away on Sloat.

It's likely I'll tackle the simple stuff like putting in 3-prong outlets
where feasible. I'll provide a ground through pipes or whatever is reasonable.

It probably wouldn't hurt to do an inspection of the electrical to see if it
could now be considered hazardous. I remember years ago just before I did a
good bit of electrical work on our last house in Mtn. View that a wire had
worn thing. The lights were dimming in the kitchen. I took out the cover
from a switch, and noticed a red glow on a wire. Cute. Apparently the wire
had gotten kinked at some time in the past.

That is not acceptable per the National Electrical Code.
(See 2005 NEC 110.54 (B) )  It requires that the ground
wire (the NEC calls it the Equipment Grounding Conductor)
be run in the same metal raceway or jacketed cable (eg
Romex) that serves the circuit.  You can't ground K&amp;T
circuits per the NEC - you need to abandon the K&amp;T and
replace the wiring to properly install a grounded
circuit.  If the service is ungrounded, then it must
be replaced before installing grounded branch circuits.

Installing 3-prong receptacles in an ungrounded circuit
is another NEC &quot;no-no&quot;, but is allowed if the circuit is fed
by a GFCI and the receptacles are labeled as not grounded.

I just Googled, and found this statement, which seems contrary to your
statement (see a page or more down at
&lt; http://en.allexperts.com/q/Electrical-Wiring-Home-1734/Old-Knob-Tube.htm &gt;):

&quot;As you noted...K-N-T never had a ground..so you can NOT legally install 3
prong grounding receptacles on this wiring....to do so is a Code
violation...it creates the illusion of a grounded receptacle when there
actually is no ground....so if you are installing new receptacle
outlets...you MUST install only 2 prong non-grounding receptacles (which are
getting harder and harder to come by now-a-days...we had to special order
our last batch ) or gut out the obselete K-n-T and run all new 12/2 with
ground romex in it's place. As far as new switches...these can still be
installed on non-gounding circuits....and there will obviously be no
physical connection to the switch's green ground screw.
(NOTE: certain light fixtures - especially 2' and 4' flourescents fixtures -
may not operate well without a ground in place)

Clearly...to make this mansion electrically safe, functional and up to
date...the K-n-T MUST go...and to replace it all at once can be a rather
expensive undertaking...perhaps you can do it in small sections...a little
at a time. 12/2 w/ground romex can be bought in short 100' and 250' foot
rolls...and this may be the approach you need to take.&quot;

I would think if installed a 6' copper ground bar into the soil outside his
house, and use 3-prong outlets where the ground wire is to the copper pole,
that it would pass code.

In a lot if San Francisco, it's so rocky that you'd never get a 6'
ground rod very deep. And in most of the rest of the city, the sandy
parts, you'd be in dry sand, an excellent insulator. He's only a block
from the beach, so he's likely on sand, and it may be dry. It doesn't
rain much here, basically not at all from April through October.

Really, do it right, and don't electrocute your descendants.

The sand is certainly an interesting angle from the stand point of
conductivity. When I go down there, I will check with nearby neighbors,
electrical contractors/suppliers and the city engineers to understand what
we might be up against.

Another interesting angle on all this was brought up by another poster, or a
web site I visited was KnT fixtures may be disappearing. If so, that could
spell doom for many of the inhabitants of SF and elsewhere around the
country who might need to replace them.

I saw another article that suggests replacement of some fixtures might
require opening walls. Yikes! Well, I'll know more when I actually see what
he's got.

&gt; In a lot if San Francisco, it's so rocky that you'd never get a 6'
&gt; ground rod very deep. And in most of the rest of the city, the sandy
&gt; parts, you'd be in dry sand, an excellent insulator. He's only a block
&gt; from the beach, so he's likely on sand, and it may be dry. It doesn't
&gt; rain much here, basically not at all from April through October.

&gt; Really, do it right, and don't electrocute your descendants.

I assume the (my) statement you are referring to is:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Installing 3-prong receptacles in an ungrounded circuit
&gt;&gt;&gt; is another NEC &quot;no-no&quot;, but is allowed if the circuit is fed
&gt;&gt;&gt; by a GFCI and the receptacles are labeled as not grounded.
&gt;&gt;&gt;

I'm sure you can find all kinds of erroneous statements
with Google, but such statements are not the code.

Here is what the 2005 NEC says in 406.3 (D) (3) (c):
&quot;A non–grounding-type receptacle(s) shall be permitted to be
replaced with a grounding-type receptacle(s) where supplied
through a ground-fault circuit interrupter. Grounding-type
receptacles supplied through the ground-fault circuit interrupter
shall be marked “GFCI Protected” and “No Equipment Ground.” An
equipment grounding conductor shall not be connected between the
grounding-type receptacles.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;As you noted...K-N-T never had a ground..so you can NOT legally install
&gt; 3 prong grounding receptacles on this wiring....to do so is a Code
&gt; violation...it creates the illusion of a grounded receptacle when there
&gt; actually is no ground....so if you are installing new receptacle
&gt; outlets...you MUST install only 2 prong non-grounding receptacles (which
&gt; are getting harder and harder to come by now-a-days...we had to special
&gt; order our last batch ) or gut out the obselete K-n-T and run all new
&gt; 12/2 with ground romex in it's place. As far as new switches...these can
&gt; still be installed on non-gounding circuits....and there will obviously
&gt; be no physical connection to the switch's green ground screw.
&gt; (NOTE: certain light fixtures - especially 2' and 4' flourescents
&gt; fixtures - may not operate well without a ground in place)

&gt;  Clearly...to make this mansion electrically safe, functional and up to
&gt; date...the K-n-T MUST go...and to replace it all at once can be a rather
&gt; expensive undertaking...perhaps you can do it in small sections...a
&gt; little at a time. 12/2 w/ground romex can be bought in short 100' and
&gt; 250' foot rolls...and this may be the approach you need to take.&quot;

&gt; I would think if installed a 6' copper ground bar into the soil outside
&gt; his house, and use 3-prong outlets where the ground wire is to the
&gt; copper pole, that it would pass code.
">

Actually, it would be a glaringly obvious fail if it was
inspected.  It violates a large portion of 250.50 - 250.100
(and possibly more) as well as 110.54 (B)
That's sure to cause a problem when selling the house, if
no inspection is done earlier.

If SF is like Seattle, if you don't have a ground rod
the power panel ground is bonded to your water line.

You'll need to run the ground from the rod to your power panel where it
is hooked to the neutral line in the power drop.  Otherwise you're
relying on the random condutivity between the safety ground and the
neutral to blow the fuse if case of a fault.  You could end up with

Thanks for the tip on the round romex. In my community in the foothills of
the Sierra, it seems to be done somewhat often. I happened on a buddy who is
a contractor here, and he gave me several tips on how to repair portions.

Two things occurred yesterday that'll impact my story. I ran into a
contractor buddy who has dealt with KnT here in our small community in the
Sierra foothills. He's done this work before, and gave me some useful tips.
More importantly, I finally got to talk to my son about this. His first
message was through my wife. Ahem! He's not expecting me to rewire the whole
place. What he's doing is re-modeling the kitchen, and wants two outlets
moved, and possibly a new one put in.

My buddy, aside from providing some electrical hints, suggested if lots of
work is needed to find someone here that does such work, and hire them to go
to SF to do the work. The building market is suffering, and contractors are
looking for work where they can get it. They can probably get good money in
SF for more than here, but less than a SF contractor. We are 150 miles from SF.

In any case, I found two people here that are experienced in KnT. They
probably won't be needed now that the focus of this effort has been
substantially narrowed. I'll talk to them anyway.

I'm talking about old practice, not current code.  The code changes.
For example, they didn't use plastic pipe in the old days.

The second point is that using a seperate ground and just running that
to some outlets is a serious safety hazard.

&gt; My son lives in San Francisco, and would like me to re-wire some of his
&gt; house. It's pretty old and he says it has knobs and tubes wiring. What
&gt; is that, and how difficult would it be to replace whatever is there with
&gt; current outlets, and maybe upgrade his entire electrical service?
">

Knob and tube wiring, if it has not been abused, is not automatically
dangerous. Splices are twisted and taped, but they are also soldered. I
have seen only one K&amp;T splice fail (it was a ‘cold’ solder joint from
the start). If the wiring has been properly fused, current is no more
problem than it is for any other type of wiring. See also the last point
below.

There certainly are some virtues in replacing it, but entirely replacing
K&amp;T wiring is *very* expensive.

As ehsjr said, one code acceptable method is using GFCI protection for
grounding type outlets (could just be a GFCI outlet). The outlet has to
be marked as Ed details.

A ‘ground’ wire may be added and a grounded outlet installed. For this
purpose, the ‘ground’ wire does not have to be routed with the other wires.

In the past the added ‘ground’ wire could be connected to a metal water
pipe. That is no longer permitted. They now have to be connected to
anywhere on the ‘grounding electrode system’, which includes the panel
ground bar, the heavy conductors to the grounding electrodes, the first
5 ft of water pipe inside the building if the water pipe is used as a
grounding electrode (the service connection to the pipe should then be
in the same 5 ft.).

Water pipe, at least 10 ft buried, has been required to be used as a
grounding electrode for a very long time. More recently, because water
service pipe can be replaced with copper, a “supplemental” electrode has
been required. A ground rod is the easiest to install. A municipal metal
water system will have a much lower resistance to earth than a rod. The
code does not require old systems to add a rod unless ‘additional’ work
is done.  The code now usually requires an additional “concrete encased
electrode” for new construction.

‘Ground’ wires are not allowed to be attached only to isolated ground
rods. As Mark said, this is a major safety hazard. Assume your metal
case ‘grounded’ drill develops a short from hot to case. The ground
current flows to the ground rod. Further assume the ground rod is not
only the code acceptable 25 ohms (with 2 rods it can be any resistance)
by a very good 12 ohms. There is 10 amps added. Depending on the other
load on the circuit, the fuse/breaker will open in a little while to
never. In the meantime you are connected to the hot wire holding the drill.

A major function of the ‘ground’ wire is to cause a high current to flow
on a short to open the fuse/breaker. The path is ‘ground’ wire to
service panel, through the required neutral-ground bond, and through the
service neutral to the supply transformer. Earth is not permitted to be
a part of the path.

Some insurance companies in some areas do not insure houses with K&amp;T wiring.
Phil Munro posted 2 links on the subject:
http://www.waptac.org/sp.asp?id=7190
is a report to the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs
on adding building insulation around existing K&amp;T wiring. No record of
hazard was found in the large number of K&amp;T installations that had
insulation added around them.
The second link appears to no longer be online - was the record of a
complaint to the Maine state Bureau of Insurance by a homeowner against
an insurance company. The insurance company denied renewal of a policy
based on K&amp;T wiring. The insurance company was ordered to renew the
policy because the insurance company &quot;provided no justification for its
position that knob and tube wiring per se automatically provides grounds
for nonrenewal&quot;.
