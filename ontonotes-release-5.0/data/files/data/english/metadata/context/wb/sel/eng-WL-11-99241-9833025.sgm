The art of diplomacy....

New York Philharmonic Orchestra has arrived in North Korea on a historic trip as the most prominent American cultural institution to visit the isolated country.

Speaking to reporters Monday, after arriving at Pyongyang airport, the Philharmonic's musical director Lorin Maazel expressed his hope that the trip would improve ties between the United States and North Korea.

Maazel said he is a musician, and not a politician, but if the music moves its audience, the Philharmonic will have done what it can to bring the people of the two countries closer.

The Philharmonic's concert on Tuesday will be broadcast internationally and live on North Korea's state-run TV and radio, where events are usually carefully produced to enhance the image of leader Kim Jong Il.

Dvorak and Gershwin

The concert will include performances of Antonin Dvorak's symphony No. 9 and George Gershwin's &amp;quot;An American in Paris.&amp;quot;

It is unclear whether North Korean Dear Leader Kim Jong Il will attend the concert, which comes as the US and other countries in the six-party talks are struggling to end the North's nuclear weapons program.

Last year, North Korea agreed to end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for economic aid, but implementation of the agreement is behind schedule.

Pyongyang was supposed to to declare all of its nuclear programs by December 31 of last year, but has yet to do so. The North complains of delays in the delivery of promised fuel oil.

South Korean Pledge

In South Korea, meanwhile, the country's new President, Lee Myung-bak, got straight to diplomacy on his first afternoon in office. He promised visiting US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice he would improve on the outgoing administration's ties with the US.

His comments came within hours of Monday's inauguration ceremony, during a meeting with Rice. Lee's spokesman, Lee Dong-kwan, told VOA the president sought a new start in relations with Washington.

He said Lee told Rice the US-South Korea relationship had been lacking something over the past five years, and had even become &amp;quot;awkward.&amp;quot; The President then said things would improve under his administration, and that closer ties between the two countries would also help ties between the two Koreas.

Strained Alliance

The US has been a close ally of South Korea's since the end of the Second World War. About 28,000 troops are stationed in South Korea to deter a repeat of North Korea's 1950 invasion. The two nations are close partners in multinational efforts to end North Korea's nuclear-weapons programs.

But the alliance was strained during the administration of Lee's predecessor, Roh Moo-hyun, mainly over differences in perception of North Korea's intentions. Lee has vowed to revamp what most South Koreans regard as Roh's overly generous and uncritical policy of economic aid to Pyongyang.

Rice praised Lee's inaugural-speech pledge to fortify the US-South Korea alliance, and said the relationship between the two countries will remain strong.

&amp;quot;It is a relationship that has only deepened over the years because we share something very important. As much as we share strategic interests, we also share common values,&amp;quot; Rice said.
