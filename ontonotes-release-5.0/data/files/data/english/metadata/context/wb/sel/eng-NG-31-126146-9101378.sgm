I made a start on this model two or three months ago when it was announced on the list. It's available here........

http://guru2.karakasa.com/T_locomotive/download_e.html

Having made a start I had to put it aside for a while, but just got around to finishing it. Has anyone else got there?
It really is a fascinating model. A couple of still photos don't do it justice, I'll have to work out how to put a video film up on my site. When the model is gently pushed along, everything moves! The piston at the front moves back and forth along its runners, the connecting rods turn the flywheel on one side and a cogwheel on the other, which with the other three cogs turns the axles. (in fact, it works the other way around, but I can pretend).
I'm now thinking that there's some potential for a tiny electric motor in the boiler, to work the cogwheel which connects to the wheels.......

I'd warn that it's certainly not an easy build. I have a bit of a problem with some warped wheels, which could have been avoided with more care!

Roger,

Beautiful work and interesting item!

Looks very intense, especially the gear work.
Also likethe all-white look. Shows up the intricacy of the model.

This is very impressive! I actually live in Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales
(UK), where Trevithick's engine pulled 10 tons of Iron along the tramroad
that runs passed where I used to live. That was part of a bet with Richard
Crawshay.

I'm not a big one on historical models but this is very impressive indeed,
epscially as it originates so close to my home.

Thanks for the pics.

Very very nice work Roger! Those gears look as though they were die
cut from the stock. Also, the stock looks very thick. Did you laminate
several thicknesses of card?

Beautifully done!

Thanks for the comments.

Skip is spot on. I should have explained more. The great Richard
Trevithick was a Cornish engineer, the first to experiment with high
pressure steam, making engines much smaller and more efficient. This
one dates from 1804. It was a static engine which he built for an
ironworks in South Wales, where he had the idea of putting it on
wheels and running it on the tramway. So this was the world's first
steam railway locomotive. It worked fine, the only problem was that
the iron tracks broke under the weight of the engine, so the idea was
abandoned!

And John, the model is entirely of thin card, (except for some 3mm
wooden dowel for axles and shafts). It's a very clever design. The
gear wheels have a central wheel, around which is wrapped a rim,
slotted to fit over the teeth. Then a long strip goes around the rim,
folded to go up and over each tooth. Then the two sides are added.
There's a sample free download on the designers site of one of the
gear wheels.
