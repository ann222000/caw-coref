PS3 warranty voided by surge protector - 'great' pay up $150 say Sony

A member of the Playstation forums called up Sony regarding his four month
old PS3 which had turned into a brick, with the trouble starting back a
while ago when the system would just shut off. However, the Playstation rep
wasn't interested in all that, as soon as he heard the gamer had used a high
quality power surge protector, the rep remarked 'okay great, Sony can fix it
right up for you for $150' as the year-long warranty was voided by the surge
protector. Spread the word and DIGG THIS!!!

quote:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

So I woke up yesterday morning and saw that my PS3 was not on. You know that
little light letting you know it's getting power? That morning, no light.
This happened once before, but I was able to unplug it and plug it back in
to get power, and then it worked. I tried that yesterday morning, but nada.
Nothing would work... it was completely dead and not getting power.

So I call Sony and let them know that my less-than 4 month old PS3 was now a
brick. I tried to tell the guy that the trouble started when I first tried
to play Call of Duty 3 a while back - it would just completely shut off the
system and the only way to get it back on was to unplug it and replug it
back in. (an issue that's been well-documented now in threads such as
these.)

The service representative didn't care about any of that. Instead, he starts
asking me a bunch of questions to try and void my warranty. Things like, &quot;I
want you to check the sticker above the hard drive and tell me if it looks
damaged.&quot; I'm like, &quot;no, no, no&quot; to everything he's asking. Then he asks me
if I had a power surge recently. Again, I tell him no, that I have all my
electronics protected with a high quality power surge protector. He then
says &quot;okay, great, Sony can fix it right up for you for $150.&quot; I asked how
long the warranty was, and he said a year... but then he tells me that I
voided my warranty by plugging it in to a surge protector. I asked him if he
was kidding me, and he says nope, the PS3 is only allowed to be plugged into
the wall directly.

I'm curious: why does MS *not* recommend using a surge suppressor?

PC users who are worth their salt wouldn't dream of running a PC without a
surge suppressor, and the Xbox 360 is a special-purpose computer, so it
would stand to reason that using a surge suppressor (or UPS) with a 360
would be a *good* idea. Ditto for the PS3.

MS' recommendation makes me wonder if many of the RRoD issues were actually
caused by exposure to power spikes or surges....

Uhm, no...

PC Users who are worth their salt KNOW that a plug-in-the-wall surge
supressor will do diddly for an equipment killing surge. Instead, they
invest in a Power Conditioner (NOT a UPS).

PC NOOBs think it's a good idea because they don't know how they work.

Most surge supressors are junk and introduce power problems and aren't worth

That's interesting.

I just checked the Xbox 360 manuals (downloaded from the support section
of xbox.com), and this paragraph from the section &quot;Connect the Console to
Power&quot; may be what MS is referring to:

&quot;Do not use non-standard power sources, such as generators or inverters,
even if the voltage and frequency appear acceptable. Only use AC power
provided by a standard wall outlet.&quot;

They apparently consider surge protectors as &quot;power sources&quot; even though
they don't generate power or convert power from DC to AC.

I also checked the xbox.com user forums; some of the users posting there
have mentioned using surge protectors with no problems at all.

Whilst surfing around, I came across this article:

http://tinyurl.com/27xdfl

From the article:
&quot;Microsoft reps have apparently been informing unlucky gamers that surge
protectors may lie at the heart of their consoles' collective deaths.
It's being said that the 360 can't handle power reductions and changes to
the electrical supply result in its weak point being attacked for massive
damage. As you may have guessed, *this is the exact scenario that surge
protectors can trigger* and, according to GP's report, as many as 90% of
all slaughtered consoles have been plugged into one.

[emphasis added]

The emphasized part of the above paragraph is something I don't
understand -- how can a properly-functioning surge protector cause a
&quot;power reduction&quot; when surge protectors are designed to prevent voltage
levels from surging or spiking *above* a certain level?

Methinks this is a bit of CYA on MS' part. Many of the commentors on the
above-referenced article have &quot;called bullshit&quot; on MS, noting that many
people use surge protectors to protect expensive electronics, like TVs,
audio equipment and PCs.

BTW, can anyone look at the label on the Xbox 360 power supply brick and
tell me if there's an Underwriters Laboratories (UL) label that mentions
a &quot;transient voltage surge suppressor&quot;? TIA.

That's what I mean by a power conditioner... Something that ALWAYS provides
clean power. Most UPS's only kick in when there is a power drop. Most UPS's
don't do ANYTHING for surges either.

Well, duh. That doesn't have to do with the problems. 90% of *ALL*
electronic equipment if probably plugged into some sort of surge
protector. When you have a stereo, TV, a console, a router, and a DVD
player; what the Hell are you supposed to plug them into, a wall
outlet with 5 sockets? Here in the U.S. at least, if you have more
than two electronic or electrical components near one another, you
HAVE to use a surge protector/powerstrip. The 2-socket outlet is still
the standard here.

Then why would connecting 2 surge protectors up in serial be a bad thing?

Furthermore, all the surge protectors I've bought all came with a warranty
covering between $20k to $50k in damages if it could be shown that their
surge protector failed.  So if Microsoft is now insinuating that an
external  surge protector will damage the 360, shouldn't this be something
that the surge protector company should pay for - or at least sue
Microsoft for slandering them?

Sadly, no they wouldn't.  That honor is still held by cable and phone

My local phone company refused to deal with a disputed charge on my

to disconnect their computers to prevent further charges.  My inlaws didn't

&gt; PS3 warranty voided by surge protector - 'great' pay up $150 say Sony

&gt; A member of the Playstation forums called up Sony regarding his four
&gt; month old PS3 which had turned into a brick, with the trouble starting
&gt; back a while ago when the system would just shut off. However, the
&gt; Playstation rep wasn't interested in all that, as soon as he heard the
&gt; gamer had used a high quality power surge protector, the rep remarked
&gt; 'okay great, Sony can fix it right up for you for $150' as the year-long
&gt; warranty was voided by the surge protector. Spread the word and DIGG
&gt; THIS!!!

&gt; quote:

&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

&gt; So I woke up yesterday morning and saw that my PS3 was not on. You know
&gt; that little light letting you know it's getting power? That morning, no
&gt; light. This happened once before, but I was able to unplug it and plug
&gt; it back in to get power, and then it worked. I tried that yesterday
&gt; morning, but nada. Nothing would work... it was completely dead and not
&gt; getting power.

&gt; So I call Sony and let them know that my less-than 4 month old PS3 was
&gt; now a brick. I tried to tell the guy that the trouble started when I
&gt; first tried to play Call of Duty 3 a while back - it would just
&gt; completely shut off the system and the only way to get it back on was to
&gt; unplug it and replug it back in. (an issue that's been well-documented
&gt; now in threads such as these.)

&gt; The service representative didn't care about any of that. Instead, he
&gt; starts asking me a bunch of questions to try and void my warranty.
&gt; Things like, &quot;I want you to check the sticker above the hard drive and
&gt; tell me if it looks damaged.&quot; I'm like, &quot;no, no, no&quot; to everything he's
&gt; asking. Then he asks me if I had a power surge recently. Again, I tell
&gt; him no, that I have all my electronics protected with a high quality
&gt; power surge protector. He then says &quot;okay, great, Sony can fix it right
&gt; up for you for $150.&quot; I asked how long the warranty was, and he said a
&gt; year... but then he tells me that I voided my warranty by plugging it in
&gt; to a surge protector. I asked him if he was kidding me, and he says
&gt; nope, the PS3 is only allowed to be plugged into the wall directly.

Sony told Wired that it doesn't void you warranty, and they're
contacting the guy who was told he'd have to pay $150:

My last HDMI cable was $5.00.

I did mark a few of my disks WAAAAY back when CD players were &quot;the&quot; thing to

Sony Denies Surge Protector Voided PS3 Warranty
By Susan Arendt October 17, 2007 | 11:01:20 AMCategories: Console
Games

This post in the PlayStation forums claims that Sony Customer Service
told the owner of a bricked PS3 that plugging his console into a surge
protector had voided his warranty, and that he'd have to pay $150 to
have the unit repaired.

This sounded pretty unlikely to us, so we contacted Sony and were told
that, no, plugging your PS3 into a surge protector does not void your
warranty. Duh. Ok, they didn't actually say &quot;Duh,&quot; but it was clearly
implied.

Sony will be contacting the customer with the bricked PS3 to resolve
the matter and sort out any misunderstandings.

Or, just another case of Sony getting caught doing something stupid, and
using a convienent scapegoat.

Here is a post from a Forum that is also discussing this issue

3) A wall outlet is a supply of power (hence a power supply). Where do
you plug in your electronics to get power? Whatever the end device is
just before your electronics is the power supply.

4) A surge protector does apply technology of its own does it not? And
therefore is condiered modifying your home power supply/source and
therefore it is not an unadulterated wall outlet.

e) I said &quot;it could&quot; be interpretted by the warranty as such. I didn't
say it should or would. I was identifying that should a company wish to
get out of supporting a warrany for that, they could. All 3 vendor
warranties are the same with respect to power. Warranties are made
fairly broad and non-specific because they are ass coverage devices.
