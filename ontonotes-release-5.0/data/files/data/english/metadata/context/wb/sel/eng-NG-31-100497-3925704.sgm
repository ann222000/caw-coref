Another theoretical question. I've always had an image in mind on a non-
opening sun roof. I wouldn't even need a fabric door to cover it. Just a
glass panel tinted rather dark in the middle of the roof. I imagine yu
could seal it better and I personally don't open them anyway.

Any thoughts on how hard it would be to add a non-functional sunroof?

Easiest way would be to add a sunroof roof clip, then permanently
seal it in.

If you want a Fiero with a sunroof.  Then just buy a Fiero with the
factory sunroof.  I am pretty sure that more than half of the Fieros
ever made came from the factory with one.  They are very easy to find.
And if the one you buy doesn't have one, just go to the junk yard and
pull one (the whole roof pannel and all) off of one there, after all
about half the ones at the junk yard will have one.
