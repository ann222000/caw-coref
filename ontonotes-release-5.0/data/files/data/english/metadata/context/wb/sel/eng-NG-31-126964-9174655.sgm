After watching the fifth episode, here are my thoughts on the contestants
and game:

1.  Original Zhan Hu was so inept that it never occurred to them that they
weren't getting two free players.
2.  Original Fei Long figured it out (well, either Courtney or Amanda did,
but Todd pretended he figured it out when he spouted his usual 'I am the
smart guy' confessional).
3.  The switch all but guaranteed that players would theorize about throwing
challenges.
4.  Throwing challenges is not smart.
5.  I would rather have seen a Reward Challenge than the free food handout.
6.  Wow...somehow everyone learned to sew and made themselves some swimwear.
7.  The Immunity Challenge 'puzzle' sucked.  Other than painting Chinese
Zodiac symbols on the puzzle pieces, the puzzle seemed to be nothing more
than random cog fitting.
8.  The very best twist that could have been done in this game is if, at the
end of the IC, Probst had said 'now return to your original tribes, Sherea
and Frosti, you have Immunity tonight when your tribe goes to TC'.

Aaron:   Another person claiming to be smart while playing poorly.  His
interactions with his new tribe didn't fool anyone, but they did tip off the
other side that he needed to be the first to go.

Amanda:
Courtney:  These two sat out the Immunity Challenge.  I'd really like to
have a better understanding as to why they thought that the lunch lady would
make a better puzzle solver than either of them.  Maybe they are just
preserving their 'under the radar status'?

Denise:  Good to see she was useful around camp.  I hope the intense
Jean-Robert hatefest was simply a strategy to keep the new tribe members
confused.  Logically, with James gone, someone had to do some work.
Jean-Robert stepping up should not have been met with such derision.

Erik:  Proof that virginity is not a sign of intelligence or insight.  he
went with a losing strategy based upon being safe for three more days.  A
real man, when told by the women that they had intentionally thrown the
challenge, would have instructed the two of them to decide which of them
(Peih-Gee or Jamie) should go home.  Hint to Eric:  a strategy to vote out
all the strong guys won't benefit you later in the game.  The two women have
just explained to you that they are working together and didn't even bother
to include you in that work.  What do you suppose is going to happen to you
again and again from this point forward until they decide to dump your dead
weight?

Frosti:  The only point at which Frosti looked smart was when he all but
told his old tribemates to take a dive in the challenge.  He had already
strategized taking James and Aaron so as to vote them off.   At least he was
smart enough to see that the other tribe might have the same intentions.

Jaime:  Watching this woman slurp in the river water over and over made me
queasy.  Listening to her attempts at strategy made me laugh.

James:  So, the challenge powerhouse doesn't swim?  Way to represent.  Then,
later, he did everything short of flat out quitting.  I hope he spends the
next 3 days refusing to provide any water or food for the loser tribe rather
than sucking up to them.

Jean-Robert:  I guess that sitting at a card table doesn't provide for much
athletic conditioning.  His challenge performance had me convinced that he
was trying, at least a little to throw the challenge.  Pretty sad if that
was his best effort.

Peih-Gee:   Best case scenario is that you take a dive twice, get rid of
James and Aaron, and enter the merge with a 5-5 tie?  What sort of logic is
that?  Does she even consider the fact that 2 of her 5 will have enjoyed 6+
days of winning /bonding with new teammates and she will have gotten rid of
all of her potential new alliances?  Nope.  Then again, it didn't occur to
her that the 'take two players from the other team' bit wouldn't be mutual.

Sherea:   The very next morning after Dave is booted and everyone is sitting
up, doing nothing.  Sherea can't even manage that much.  She hopes going to
a new tribe will change people's view of her work ethic, but did we see any
effort from her to do any work?  Nope, just a hope that no one would notice.

Todd:   Not very visible this week.  Still trying to portray himself as 'the
smart one' in confessionals and in challenges by aiming himself at the
puzzles.

It is clear that Fei Long are physically stronger of the two tribes (thanks
to James) and has aleadey 7-5 advantage now. A 5-5 tie at merge improves PG
and her tribemates' game tremendously. And it seems that Zhan Hu is a tigher
tribe than Fei Long. I predict PG's strategy will work and Jean-Robert will
flop. This is how I see the season will end based on the camera time so far:

1. Jamie
2. PG
3. Erik
4. Sherea
5. Jean-Robert
6. Frosty

They will eliminate Fei Long members first, then the physically stronger
players next.

Early in the show, Jaime said, &quot;I think being a virgin makes him even

Then she showed how little trust she has in him when she excludes him
from the dumping strategy.

Same here. I want to see him eating in front of the others while they
watch.

My prediction: MB will find a way to save James.

If another twist hasn't been invented before the reward challenge,
James can throw that contest.

Oops, there I go again, forgetting to add my answer before I hit send. I

What I was going to say is:certainly it could be a hint. However, it could
be a mind game, just to watch them squirm.

I'm curious why she thinks his explanation makes him more trustworthy. It's
not like he said he was a virgin because he's honoring his commitment to his
religion and waiting for marriage, he just hadn't found the right woman to
lose his virginity to.

I don't think she really meant that he was more trustworthy in the sense
that he would honor his promises.  I think she meant it in the sense that he
was going to be a predictably gullible tool.  As someone else pointed out,
if she trusted him she would have told him in advance about throwing the
challenge.  Instead, she told him afterwards because she knows that he has
all the independence of a stray puppy and would keep following and doing as
told.

Side note:  Big Tom was a stray puppy for two seasons and a lot of people
still think he was good at this game.

At the point when the show airs, the editors do know which way things will
go.  That little comment by Probst probably would not have made it into the
show if the women were going to be successful in making it to the Final
days.  In fact, if throwing the challenge was going to work, the editing
probably would have hidden from us that the challenge ws even thrown.
Survivor is like that.

Probst made a comment.  If the end game turned out to benefit Peih-Gee and

Do you recognize any sort of problem with the statement you just made?  How
do you expect to recall it if you didn't notice it?  How do you expect to
recall it if the editing specifically hid the 'throwing' from the viewer?

In Survivor, post merge, lots of players are 'throwing' challenges.  If they
are not in danger of getting sent home, they frequently avoid doing well in
the IC just so they avoid putting a target on their backs.  As for the RCs,
same concept.  'Throw' the RC so that you don't look like a threat; happens
all the time.  Did you think it was just a gigantic coincidence that the few
players in danger of being sent home are the same few that nearly always
seem to step it up for the challenges?

I was not really considering post-merge individual challenge-throwing.
Obveeusly you never know whether an individual is trying to win or
not.  I was referring to a multi-player strategy to do it.

have been thrown that were unknown at the time and came to light at a

It depends on how many closing comments he makes at TC. It never occurred to
me before that he might make four or five and then they edit in the best
one. But since his comment covers both possible outcomes, it doesn't exactly
give away what's going to happen.

Unfortunately I don't have the excellent memories than many fans of
the show have, so I can't name a single specific instance -- but I do
remember seeing at least once when the most-recent bootee was being
interviewed on &quot;Survivor Live&quot;, and they claimed to have thrown a
challenge on purpose.

(&quot;Liar!&quot;, I thought to myself at the time, because there was no
evidence that I could see of the challenge intentionally being thrown.
I was assuming that the bootee was trying to save face.  But maybe it
was actually edited out, as suggested earlier -- that actually hadn't
occurred to me.)

I don't think the original post claimed that the throwing of challenges has
come to light at a later time.  The idea is simply that thrown challenges
won't always be revealed to the audience because it isn't a plotline that MB
would want to promote very often.  Certainly, we have seen tribes in the
past that were up several players and didn't seem too disappointed when they
found themselves at TC with a chance to get rid of the tribe annoyance.
Unless one or more players admits to throwing the challenge (not a smart
thing to admit), it may not even be possible for the video to reveal the
'throw'.

We are not talking about Jeff presenting two different scenarios.  We are
talking about the implication he made that their choice to throw the
challenge could backfire on them.  The editors chose to include that
statement in the storyline.  The only issue is whether you believe it more
likely that they included the statement to misdirect the audience or if they
included the statement to foreshadow the story.  After seeing 14 seasons of
this show, we should have a better than 50/50 guessing ability to decide
which things are foreshadowing and which things are misdirection.  If you
think the stamement made by Jeff and the context in which it was edited into
the show covered both possibilities equally, I disagree.

Maybe you need to review Jeff's statement, which was: &quot;If your assumptions
about the game hold true, could be a good play. If your assumptions are
wrong, could be trouble.&quot; Had Jeff only said, &quot;If your assumptions are
wrong, could be trouble,&quot; then your argument would be correct. But he's
making just as strong of a suggestion for it being a good play as he is for
it being a bad one so there's no way to determine at this point how it will

PG's assumption seems to be more trivial than the sort of information Jeff
has been quoted as saying he receives before TC. It's likely that either he
guessed that was her assumption based on the fact that merges usually take
place when there are 10 people or he learned of her assumption throughout
his TC questioning but that dialogue wasn't shown.

She probably mentioned it in response to a question we didn't see.

I just checked, Jeff was never specific about PG's assumptions. The

play. If your assumptions about the game hold true, could be a good
play. If your assumptions about the game are wrong, could be trouble&quot;.

In order for Pieh-Gee's strategy to work as she explained it, James will
have to go home next, followed by some sort of 5-5 tiebreaker that leaves
her original 5 in charge of the game.

So, I'll say right now that Peih-Gee's 5 won't be the final 5 in the game.
In fact, we won't see 3 of (Peih-Gee, Erik, Jamie, and Frosti) in the final
five (I didn't include Sherea because it is a joke that Peih-Gee even spoke
as if Sherea was in the alliance).  The only members of this group that will
make it to the end game are the ones that get as far away from
jamie/Peih-Gee strategy as possible.

For the contest:
I'll bet 100 chips that 3 or more of (Peih-Gee, Erik, Jamie, and Frosti)
don't make the final 5.

Clearly, what we have is a difference of opinion on what Survivor has been
doing as foreshadowing for the past 14 seasons.  Anyone that heard/saw
Probst's comment and thought it was foreshadowing that Peih-Gee's scenario
would play out has not been paying attention for the last 14 seasons as far
as I am concerned.

Nobody is stating that. Everybody but you seems to get the fact that Jeff
made an either/or statement. It's just as likely that he was foreshadowing
success as he was foreshadowing failure. You seem to be letting your
prediction of what will happen (that it will be trouble, which I agree with)
get in the way of actual evidence.

No, it is not just as likely that he was foreshadowing either way.  14
seasons of Survivor should mean something in our ability to interpret what
is 'forshadowing'.

You seem to be completely oblivious to what qualifies as foreshadowing.  It
is more than mere words.  It is the setting under which those words are
edited into the episode.  Perhaps the show should have edited in some
ominous death music at that point and then you would have 'seen' the
'foreshadow' more clearly?

I was thinking of PG's strategy success more along the lines of it
getting her further into the game.  Reasons she stated to influence
another tribe member have no bearing as it does not necessarily
indicate her true motives, which are more likely getting HERSLEF
further along.  Her success cannot be defined as having her &quot;alliance&quot;
taking control of the game.

So, I would define her strategy as successful if she gets further
along than would be likely otherwise.  If she had not thrown the
challenge, it is most likely Frosti would have been sent home and no
matter who went the second time, PG's &quot;alliance&quot; would be at a
disadvantage and she would likely be booted soon as the ringleader of
the opposition to the larger &quot;alliance&quot;, well before she got to the
final 5 or 6.

That would mean PG's stratgey would have to get HER into the final 5
or 6 to be successful, and I would wager that she will.

Your suggested wager defines PG's success in getting 75 percent of her
&quot;alliance&quot; into the final 5, but if you give me high enough odds I
would also consider taking that bet in addition.

that, I would disagree as well.  *I* was merely stating that his

Peih-Gee AND Jamie both  enacted theis plan.  It has to be looked at in

plan upon.

That is a silly bet.  First of all, Peih-Gee getting booted at F6 isn't what
I would call 'successful'.  Secondly, I don't think we can accurately claim
that she would not have made it all the way to 6th place if she hadn't

I could give you 10 to 1 odds that 3 of her 5 don't make the final 5, but
that would consume all of my chips for the rest of the game and leave me
nothing left to bet with for the next month and a half.  Not much fun or

don't you give me some 'high enough odds' of Peih Gee making F3?  You can
lock up all your chips for the rest of the game...and, of course, lose them

All of the plan and the events that followed in this episode had to do with
the idea of getting back to a 5-5tie so that her original tribe could get
