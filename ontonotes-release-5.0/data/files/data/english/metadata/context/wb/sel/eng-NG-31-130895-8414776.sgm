Hey people, just wondering what exactly you video pros do for a living? Documentaries? Weddings? Movies?

For me, video is relevant because I do computer-based VFX for a living, and I need to put demos together from time to time. I also like to do the occasional home movie and may someday want to do something a bit grander, like a short with a genuine storyline.

But you guys pay your bills from video work. So what exactly do you do with your skills?

Unfortunately (or fortunately for my sanity) I have retired from active
video production as a way of making a living. I have gone back to video
engineering, with a small broadcast hire shop. This enables me to play with
all the new camera 'toys' and try to keep up with all the new technology.
I'm still actively passing on some of my video knowledge both on and off
line. I still learn something new every day - but I now forget a good deal
more as well!  I work with a lot of young folks that are all trying to get
on to the video ladder, but it is now a very different world to the one when
I started!

Incidentally - I got to meet Adam Wilt again earlier this summer when he
visited England on holiday - he was on good form.

I met him several years ago at some DV Magazine seminars. A truly  great mind
and a nice guy.

As for what I do now, I'm pretty much retired from regularly shooting  and
editing in order to spend more time with my wife who has had a couple  of
strokes.  We still travel and of course, I have to shoot a little  video now and
then. But, I'm getting too old to schlep around the equipment to  do commercial
production.

I work on a few projects at the Community College and for the Maui Police
Department but this work is volunteer. The only thing I do at network level
anymore is to act as Technical Supervisor for ESPN's Maui Basketball  Tournament.
I also run a remote camera set up on the roof of the building  for beauty
shots of our wonderful island.  It's a hoot to step back into  the insanity of
live television sports coverage for a few days.

For you Newbies out there who haven't suffered through my many war  stories,
it all started 55 years ago at Lyndon Johnson's television station in  Austin,
Texas while I was attending UT.

I'm grateful that I can still do jobs that matter to me in this
business. The switch to DV and prosumer acceptability has been a mixed
blessing. I'm in South Africa at the moment shooting on my Z1, by
myself for a podcast about a group doing HIV/AIDS work and I love that
I breezed through customs with two bags, but get weary working alone
and knowing that I'm not able to make the best images I'm capable of,
because of the gear, because of the time alloted, because of the
miserable budgets and because not only are people not willing to pay
for better craft, they don't know what it is and don't want to take
even a moment to achieve it.

I continue to make a living and am managing to put my daughters
through college by diversifying, teaching workshops in Maine and
Uganda, teaching at the USC film school, still occasionally shooting
for the BBC or Channel 4 (UK) on the west coast (they can't afford to
fly people around any more, even with the strong pound) picking up
small jobs as they come in. My greatest satisfaction comes from making
a film or two a year for NGOs, usually on development issues, but to
be able to do that, I need to do it all in-house (ie, myself) except
for music composition and After Effects graphics work. Learning and
mastering Final Cut Pro has been probably the smartest thing I've done
since marrying my wife.

I'm living the life I've dreamed of, but it has involved working my
ass off and never stopping. I've had the greatest experiences of
anyone I know, but really can't say that I would recommend this career
any more, mostly due to the difficulty of doing great work and the
continuing decline of television.

I'm 54, shot my first film in 1976 and hope to still be shooting when
I'm 70 and beyond. Yeah, my eyes are failing and I hate it, but I
still manage (yes, the diopter is already at the end, but I seem to
remember it always being so. I haven't been able to work with a
flipout screen for two years.)

I graduated as a cultural anthropologist in 1989, 18 years after I had
entered the university... I had dropped out during my study for many
years, first part time, later completely (when I took up my study again I
had to call the University to ask where the Institute for Cultural
Anthropology had moved to...) Turmoil of life, and got film training. As a
minor at the University I did Film Art, and Visual Ethnography (theory and
film course). After my study I got a research job at the University of
Amsterdam, doing research for the Government on inland navigation (the
subject of my thesis). Then I also got a teaching job there, teaching
visual anthropology. I gave lectures on the theory and history of
documentary, esp. the anthropological films, and also taught the practice
of filmmaking (the students worked on low band U-matic at the time), on
three levels. In the mean time, I also continued to make documentaries and
informational films, esp. later, when the visual anthropology disappeared
from the UvA, due to financial mismanagement of the director of the
faculty at large. Since then I'm living as a street dog, taking a bone
here, a bread there.... Well, doing informational films (either camera, or
sound, or editing, or script and direction, or parts of it, or everything
on my own) and documentaries. Teaching semesters and courses at other
universities.

I have been the director of a documentary film festival during 6 years (up
till three years ago), it took me at least half of all my time, but it was
mainly a labor of love ( www.beeldvoorbeeld.nl ), earning me at max a few
thousand euro a year. The last years I mainly made my money working for a
consultant agency, specialized in the cultural sector and in issues on
multiculturalism. For example: now I'm doing research for a middle-sized
city in the Netherlands, where they want to get ethnic minorities more
involved in cultural affairs. I have to do research, write a masterplan,
and produce two projects as a sort of standard for the future. Apart from
that, I have been working for many years now as a writer and text editior,
mainy in the cultural and non-profit field.

But my main thing at the moment is a documentary I've been wanting to make
already for many years, about inland navigation in Europe. The new
Rhine-Main-Danube canal made it possible to sail from Rotterdam, The
Netherlands, all the way to the Black Sea, and vice versa. This has lots
of historical, political, social, economical and ecological implications.
And it's 'urgent' in the sense that the Danube ends as the border of
Rumania and Bulgary, since Jan 1 member states of the EU, and the delta at
the Black Sea, is Rumanian. And in Serbia, the bridges that were bombed by
the NATO during the Balkan war, have been restored, making naval
transportation easier again. I shot already 50 hours, with a small grant
from a Dutch Broadcaster (the best one we have, I have to say to my
luck...). When they approve this, I'll continue. I have put a lot of my
own money in it, have *very* large debts now, so trying to pay off parts
of it with my consultancy work.

I'm shooting this docu on my own, which is tough, since I'm no longer a
young man... (55 now). Have to travel alone, with Z1, rig, general luggage
etc. Started with too much gear, and doing most of the shooting with just
the camera, the DVRIG PRO and the Sanken CS01 (great mike). Sometimes
additional wireless mike etc. But dropped the DAT for general / additional
sound (it didn't function well, as well). Am considering to sell the Z1
and buy a SOny A1 (bit outdated now) or maybe even one or two consumer
camera's (Canon HV20, Sony HC7).
My main problem though is my RSI - carpal tunnel syndrome, but not as much
at my wrists but shoulders, arms, back; and having a tennis ellbow now
already for a couple of months. That's also the reason I'm considering a
lighter camera.

So, doing things I like, making not money enough at all. But I really want
to make this film, after that we will see...

Best,
Ton Guiking

Chiming in from Tokyo...

I'm about to turn 50. In college, married a girl who grew up in
Japan as the daughter of missionaries. Her dad knew a guy running
a little production company and told him about this American kid
his daughter was about to marry. Got a letter out of the blue
offering a two year job to do some photography and script writing
for an English radio program. An overseas job right out of
college ought to look good on a resume, so we went. But I really
clicked with them and with Japan, and they liked my work... so
I've been here ever since.

I went on the TV production crew when my Japanese got good
enough. We're now making a weekly program that airs in 11 'rural'
markets ('rural' for Japan, but they don't have rural the way
Americans understand it!) It's sort of a local color program,
introducing people from all walks of life. Recently we've done
shows on a custom shoe maker, bamboo weaving artisan (don't laugh
-- one of his pieces we shot has a US$20,000+ price tag on it!),
a baker, and then one guy that has about 8 businesses on his name
card -- he has a day care center for kids, an old people's home,
a group home for handicapped, and lawn and garden business to
employ handicapped, and pastors a little church. I thought I was
busy until we shot him! I'm the main cameraman, and do some
editing -- mostly finishing work, color correction, etc. We're
shooting SD, waiting for the local stations we air on to request
HD before we move in that direction.

To some degree language and customs have been problems, but all
in all it has be fascinating to work in another cultural setting,
especially in a job that gets me out to so many different places,
meeting so many different, interesting people.

Okay, that's me.... who's next?

Ha, just my luck...

After the list has been so quiet lately, I leave home for a couple of
days, for a video shoot, and come back to all this :)

I'm mostly a Wedding and Event shooter. I average around 20 weddings a
year. I shoot on a Canon GL1 and this year added a Canon HV10. Cute
little camera, I'm liking it for B-Roll stuff.

On the event stuff, I shoot things like local Ice Figure Skating
clubs, or this weekend I shot a group of kids who do Shakespeare
productions. The lady who started the club originally did it for her
own kids, then 29 years later, she's still doing it!

I recently moved from a smaller town over to Seattle, so that's been
good for business. I've had the luck to run into some good contacts,
so that's always nice.

I'd have to agree with some of the other recent posts, now with the
more stable OS and NLEs, and faster computers, things just work. I've
found myself more times lately, I'll be 3 hours into an edit, and I
realize I've not even saved the project the first time. Used to be,
I'd click something, hit Save. Click something else, Click Save.
click... SAVE... get scared, reboot just in case :)

What scares me the most lately, though, is how cheap hard drive prices
are getting. I just bought a pair of the WD 500 GB SATA drives for
something like $110 each. I needed to move a few projects off the edit
system, so I could finish something else up. Like HOLY CRAP, there's 1
TB sitting there on the shelf... Wow... I only started around 1999 or
so,  I was always under funded and broke, but my first video attempts
were done with a pair of 8.4 GB drives striped on a Promise FastTrack
controller, and a Matrox Rainbow Runner analog capture card... that
never did really work good... I've got an interesting collection of
stuff that never did work, come to think of it :)

Well, I'm not a video pro (still a student), but what I've focused on
is Socially Aware documentaries. My biggest project so far was a 30
minute documentary, Fuerza ( http://www.soluzfilms.com ) on immigration
between a town in Mexico and a town in the US. That's been shown at
several film festivals, and I've personally shown it in 3 countries.

I've also helped on a documentary on how an NGO is working with South
African churches to be an agent of change in post apartheid South
Africa, done a documentary on a group of poor coffee farmers in the
Dominican Republic ( http://www.directedbyface.com/mpconvite.php ). I
just got back from Honduras, and am currently editing a promotional
video for an NGO for my college internship.

I've also done a few shorts, and the like, but what I've really
enjoyed are the ones that involve 1) Travel, 2) Social Issues 3) Two
languages, generally Spanish/English.

I have earned a grand total of: Room and Board for 3 months, a $1500
scholarship, and a lot of travel. I have yet to see any real money
come from these projects, sadly.

James, don't worry about the money at this stage. Nothing is more
profitable than the experience, contacts etc that you've got / are getting
now by these projects. C'mon, you're still really young, not finished
college. When I was teaching documentary filmmaking at the U of Amsterdam,
I ALWAYS urged my students to pick up (after the course, that is) whatever
project came by, paid, unpaid, interesting, less interesting. It always
will pay off in the future. (Of course you should not follow me in the
sense that I'm still heavily in the red numbers at the age of 55, now
because I'm funding partly myself a documentary I am eager to make).
Good luck!

&gt; Well, I'm not a video pro (still a student), but what I've focused on
&gt; is Socially Aware documentaries. My biggest project so far was a 30
&gt; minute documentary, Fuerza ( http://www.soluzfilms.com ) on immigration
&gt; between a town in Mexico and a town in the US. That's been shown at
&gt; several film festivals, and I've personally shown it in 3 countries.

&gt; I've also helped on a documentary on how an NGO is working with South
&gt; African churches to be an agent of change in post apartheid South
&gt; Africa, done a documentary on a group of poor coffee farmers in the
&gt; Dominican Republic ( http://www.directedbyface.com/mpconvite.php ). I
&gt; just got back from Honduras, and am currently editing a promotional
&gt; video for an NGO for my college internship.

&gt; I've also done a few shorts, and the like, but what I've really
&gt; enjoyed are the ones that involve 1) Travel, 2) Social Issues 3) Two
&gt; languages, generally Spanish/English.

&gt; I have earned a grand total of: Room and Board for 3 months, a $1500
&gt; scholarship, and a lot of travel. I have yet to see any real money
&gt; come from these projects, sadly.
