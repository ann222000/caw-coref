Why do network sports &quot;talking heads&quot; hate Boston/New England teams?

Sitting at the Thanksgiving table, I posed this question to my wife's aunt,
a retired teacher and high school coach.
She proceeded to make me aware of something obvious, that I'd never thought
of.  The Red Sox and Patriots
players, coaches and usually the fans don't give the &quot;talking heads&quot; any
&quot;grist for their mill&quot;. No &quot;trash talk&quot;, no
&quot;Look at me and the &lt;insert play here&gt;  I just did&quot;, No &quot;we played a great
game and they sucked&quot;. No wife or
partner beating, on screen crotch grabbing or nose picking, No goal post
hugging, No fans lobbing &quot;D&quot; batteries,
snowballs or debris on the field, at players or officials, No poor behavior
that the &quot;talking heads&quot; can
make a big deal about. So they find it tough to say anything good about
teams that don't give them anything
&quot;newsy&quot; to yak about other than quiet &quot;get the job done&quot; professional on and
off the field performance.
That being said, I'd really like to see more &quot;professionalism&quot; out of these
&quot;talking heads&quot;, FOX Sports being
one network in particular.

Wishes for a Happy Holiday Season (and a winning one for the Pats!) to All.

Its more than just the talking heads, go anywhere outside of your little
fairyland of Boston and they are hated. They are the NEW Oakland Raiders of
the 70's. Its mostly because of their classless, egotistic attitudes that
make people hate them. Its only the Patriots....the Sox, Bruins, and Celts
are well liked.

Hmmm.. Could you please cite some examples of this? No, &quot;running up the
score&quot;
doesn't make it. First of all, this isn't &quot;schoolboy&quot; football, and second,
there's been
a long history of the Patriots being &quot;blown out&quot;, so please clarify. Yes,
we're all
aware of the video impropriety.

Thanks.

Egotistic attitudes?    You don't watch many post-game or mid-week
interviews with Pats players, do you?

As this troll shows, the biggest problem with the Patriots is jealousy.
Winning becomes &quot;being egotistic.&quot;  Playing flawlessly becomes &quot;being
classless.&quot;  Last week, every member of the Patriots heaped praise on the
Buffalo Bills, with Belichick going so far as to say that Buffalo was so
good, he was glad they got two weeks to prepare.  This week, you hear
nothing but praise for the Eagles up and down the roster.  It drives some
people crazy.  They don't understand why the Patriost aren't trash talking,
why they aren't playing up their record, why they aren't making &quot;Super Bowl
Shuffle&quot; videos.  It drives them nuts, and so they strike out with bizarre
ranting and convoluted arguments -- violation of a rule that was put in
place in place late 2006 somehow calls into question events from 2001, 2003,
and 2004, playing so well that the game is decided in the first half becomes
running up the score, etc, etc...

You have no idea how many Red Sox fans there are around the country.
I've lived in the south and west coast and everywhere I lived I ran
into Red Sox fans.
Basketball fans everywhere respected the Celtics. Even in California
there was never any hatred for them...such as I see in this group.
I don't know about the Pats because for years they weren't important
enough for anyone to worry about but I can tell you the local Hooter's
Restaurants have loyal Pats fans who sit together each week for the
games.

Look, I'm a Boston fan born and raised but honestly, I don't see any
difference between the players or fans from our teams than those of
any other. There are jerks everywhere. This is just off the top of my
head:

&quot;L-I-L-L-Y&quot;. Schilling wanting to make 50,000 Yankee fans shut up.

Manny admiring his home runs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I've heard &quot;We played a great game and they just played better&quot; and
&quot;They played poorly but we played worse&quot; (certainly sour grapes) but I
seriously can't recall any players saying anything like you've
mentioned. Even trolls generally settle for just a &quot;You guys suck.&quot; I
could certainly be wrong but do you have an example of this type of
extreme gloating?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Julio Lugo. Wil Cordero.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Papelbon pretty much every time he gets a strikeout.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Okay. I'm not sure how much goal post hugging I've actually seen. I
actually kind of enjoy modest end zone celebrations, though, and wish
the NFL hadn't cracked down so hard.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

1999 ALCS. The umpires had to order Yankee players off the field (in
their words) &quot;for their own safety.&quot; The fact that it was a bullshit
call against the Sox that triggered the event was really no excuse for
that kind of behavior, IMHO.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No poor behavior that the &quot;talking heads&quot; can make a big deal about.
">

Ortiz throwing bats from the dugout. Rioting in Boston after the 2004
and 2007 World Series'. Rodney Harrison on HGH. Belichek's videos.

I love our teams and our fans but I don't think Boston/New England
teams and fans are any better or worse than any other in terms of the
percentage of constituent jerks. The fact is that everything that one
fan base wants to lob against another is not only based on anecdotal
(and in some way always refutable) evidence but also it really pretty
much evens out at the end.

No, it is jealousy.  Especially regarding the Pats.

I think the Sox are still largely getting a pass on the jealousy thing

I had a friend was a big baseball player
back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
but all he kept talking about was

'We' spared Caractacus (sp?) just because he was cool. That should count
for something.
'We' explained bathing. It's not our fault many o'er there have
forgotten the niceties.
'We' explained roads and stuff. Much easier for chariots, I hear.
And last, but not least, 'we' gave you a whole lexicon to pin your legal
system on, thereby confusing those that didn't join the church.

&gt; Sitting at the Thanksgiving table, I posed this question to my wife's
&gt; aunt, a retired teacher and high school coach.
&gt; She proceeded to make me aware of something obvious, that I'd never
&gt; thought of.  The Red Sox and Patriots
&gt; players, coaches and usually the fans don't give the &quot;talking heads&quot; any
&gt; &quot;grist for their mill&quot;. No &quot;trash talk&quot;, no
&gt; &quot;Look at me and the &lt;insert play here&gt;  I just did&quot;, No &quot;we played a great
&gt; game and they sucked&quot;. No wife or
&gt; partner beating, on screen crotch grabbing or nose picking, No goal post
&gt; hugging, No fans lobbing &quot;D&quot; batteries,
&gt; snowballs or debris on the field, at players or officials, No poor
&gt; behavior that the &quot;talking heads&quot; can
&gt; make a big deal about. So they find it tough to say anything good about
&gt; teams that don't give them anything
&gt; &quot;newsy&quot; to yak about other than quiet &quot;get the job done&quot; professional on
&gt; and off the field performance.
&gt; That being said, I'd really like to see more &quot;professionalism&quot; out of
&gt; these &quot;talking heads&quot;, FOX Sports being
&gt; one network in particular.

&gt; Wishes for a Happy Holiday Season (and a winning one for the Pats!) to
&gt; All.

Hell, they are all based in NY. That's their big market.
On Comcast, you have to watch the MF Giants every week as the regional game.
They have been on EVERY WEEK.
You can't get around the NY sports bias in the media.
You know, Giants, Jets, New England, Dallas, Philly,
Minnesota, Giants, Jets, San Diego, Seattle...
Get it?

Bullcrap.

The problem is that Belichick and his players won't feed the media beast
and the media HATES coaches and players who don't &quot;help&quot; them do
their job, and as a result, these media jackasses attack the Patriots for
all sorts of percieved issues, when the only &quot;issue&quot; is that these media
jackasses are pissed off that the Pats' coaches and players don't do their
job for them.
